<span class="headword">Bancroft,  Thomas</span>  (1756&#150;1811), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and schoolmaster</span>, was born in Deansgate, Manchester, son of Thomas Bancroft, a thread maker. He was educated at Manchester grammar school from the age of six and at Brasenose College, Oxford, whence he matriculated on 8 April 1778, aged twenty-two. He graduated BA in 1781 and was awarded his MA in 1784. After leaving Oxford he worked briefly as assistant master at Manchester grammar school under the headmaster, Charles Lawson, before being appointed headmaster of King Henry VIII School at Chester. Little is known of his headmastership apart from the assessment of the Cheshire antiquary George Ormerod, that &#145;the school attained a considerable degree of classical celebrity&#146; under Bancroft's headship  (Ormerod, 1.366n.). He published a collection of Greek, Latin, and English exercises, written partly by his pupils, at Chester in 1788 as <span class="italic">Prolusiones poeticae</span>, described in the dedication to the bishop of Chester as &#145;the literary first-fruits of the King's School, Chester&#146;  (T. Bancroft, <span class="italic">Prolusiones poeticae</span>, 1788, dedication). Bancroft became a minor canon of Chester Cathedral and was ordained deacon at Chester on 29 June 1783. He was ordained as a priest on 28 September 1783.<br>
<br>While headmaster of King Henry VIII School, Bancroft married Elizabeth, the daughter of a Mr Bennett, wine merchant and alderman of the city of Chester. Bennett was opposed to the marriage, and after Bancroft and his fianc&eacute;e ran away to be married, Mr Bennett chased them, stabbed Bancroft in the leg with his sword, took his daughter back home, and forbade them to have any contact. However, they eloped a second time, and after they married Bennett disowned his daughter and they were never reconciled, though he did bequeath &pound;1000 to each of their two daughters, Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 6 May 1789) and Ann (<i>bap</i>. 7 May 1783).<br>
<br>In 1793 Bancroft became vicar of Bolton, where he remained until his death in 1811. He became domestic chaplain to the first Viscount Castle-Stewart, chaplain to the Bolton Volunteers in 1798, and was appointed as king's preacher for Lancashire in 1807. He also served on the Bolton magistrate's bench.<br>
<br>Bancroft was an intellectual, a frustrated academic who had missed out on the opportunity of taking his doctorate at Oxford. He published translations of Latin and Greek works but the majority of his publications concerned matters of theology and Christian duty. He was a high-church tory, and a close associate of Colonel Ralph Fletcher, a founder member of the English Orange order, and he was not above using the pulpit for the purpose of political propaganda. His published sermons testify to his vehement antagonism to civil and religious dissent, and revolutionary politics, which he associated with heathenism. He believed in the notion of a chain of being, and that each individual was allocated to a station in life by God. He also believed that England and the English protestant constitution were superior to any other system of civil government or theological doctrine. Moreover, he believed that England had a special relationship with God and that divine providence had blessed England with prosperity and liberty. Political loyalism, therefore, was a religious act, and a fundamental part of Christian duty, for, as he argued, &#145;One irregular stone in the Fabric may prejudice the firmness, as well as destroy the symmetry of the whole&#146;  (T. Bancroft, <span class="italic">Christian Zeal and Civil Obedience Earnestly Recommended to the Friends of Piety and Good Government</span>, 1800). Yet Bancroft did not write for posterity and clearly had no desire for his political preaching to survive his death. In his will he directed that his sermons be destroyed to safeguard them against passing into the hands of others or being used by others.<br>
<br>Bancroft died on 5 February 1811 and was buried at Bolton parish church.<br>
