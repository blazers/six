<span class="headword">Ferne,  Henry</span>  (1602&#150;1662), <span class="occ">bishop of Chester and controversialist</span>, was probably born at York, the eighth and youngest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9350/', "Sir John Ferne (d. 1609)")</script> of Temple Belwood in the parish of Belton within the Isle of Axholme, Lincolnshire, and Elizabeth, daughter of John Needham of Wymondley Priory, in Hertfordshire.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Shortly after Sir John's death his widow married Sir Thomas Nevill Smyth (<i>d</i>. 1636) of Holt in Leicestershire and Cressing Temple in Essex. She was his second wife, and Henry and at least one of his sisters joined their household. In 1613 Smyth, who had numerous children of his own, was obliged to mortgage his Holt estate, where he usually lived, for sixty years to Thomas, Lord Darcy, and other Essex friends, but, perhaps helped by a provision in Sir John Ferne's will, he made sure that Ferne had an extended education. After schooling locally at Uppingham he spent two years at St Mary Hall, Oxford, before being admitted in 1620 as a gentleman pensioner to Trinity College, Cambridge, where one of his stepbrothers, Clement Nevill Smyth, soon followed him. Ferne graduated BA in 1623, was elected fellow in 1624, and proceeded MA in 1626. He took his BD in 1632 and became chaplain to Thomas Morton, translated that summer from the bishopric of Lichfield to that of Durham. Trinity College subsequently bestowed on Ferne the adjacent benefices of Masham and Kirby Lazeard in the North Riding of Yorkshire. In 1639, however, his eldest stepbrother, Henry Nevill Smyth, presented him to the rectory of Medbourne, close by Holt; and in 1641, the year in which he proceeded DD at Cambridge, he became archdeacon of Leicester through the good offices of his bishop, John Williams of Lincoln.<br>
<br>Advancement within the church had come just as serious political questions were beginning to claim Ferne's attention. Shortly after publishing his <span class="italic">Answer to the Petition of the Lords and Commons</span> on 19 July 1642 while at Beverley, Charles I embarked on a brief rally southwards. Ferne preached before him at Leicester, probably on Sunday 24 July; and did so again, at Nottingham, immediately before the outbreak of war. The king so liked what he heard that he made Ferne one of his extraordinary chaplains, soon promoting him to chaplain-in-ordinary, with his waiting month in November. For a time at least he seems to have kept close to the royalist forces in Yorkshire, repaying his debt to Williams (now archbishop of York) by riding through the night of 3 October to Cawood, the archbishop's skimpily protected castle to the south of York, to warn him of the angry approach of Captain John Hotham, at the head of a parliamentarian raiding party from Hull. <h2>
<a name="WritingsandOxford"></a>Writings and Oxford</h2>Even before war started Ferne had begun actively to consider what more he might do to support the king's <span class="italic">Answer</span> of 19 July, in which Charles had, among much else, protested at the way that the petitioning Lords and Commons were encouraging hostile writing. He had singled out Henry Parker's <span class="italic">Observations upon Some of his Majesty's Late Answers and Expresses</span> (July 1642), in which Parker had bluntly, if anonymously, declared that &#145;power is originally inherent in the people&#146; and which the king condemned as &#145;against his Crown and against monarchy itself&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 2.232&#150;7, especially 235). Ferne's background had already given him, at second hand, an awareness of the threat which popular pretensions might pose to established order. Social stability was considered at length in his father's <span class="italic">The Blazon of Gentrie</span> (1586). His stepbrother Henry Nevill Smyth had been recruited in 1637 by the bishop of London's commissary, Robert Aylett, a family friend, to search the studies of dissident clergy in Essex, including John Dodd and others in his circle. But these men had the support of Robert Rich, second earl of Warwick, and when Nevill Smyth made a bold stand against Warwick's candidates in 1640 at the Essex election to the Short Parliament he suffered a bruising defeat. As he afterwards reported, &#145;it was said amongst the people that if [he] had the day they would have the gentlemen to peeces&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/449/48). The outdated 40-shilling freehold franchise had enabled Warwick and others to make freeholders for the day, drawing them from sympathetic parliamentary boroughs and encouraging them to participate violently in county hustings which were none of their business.<br>
<br>Such views and experiences may well have helped to shape Ferne's thinking. By the summer of 1642 he had come to believe that, while all might not be well with the king's government, there were no grounds for parliament to resort to force against him in the name of the people. That autumn he published his first work, <span class="italic">The resolving of conscience upon this question: Whether upon such a supposition or case, as is now usually made, [that] the king will not discharge his trust but is bent or seduced to subvert religion, lawes and liberties, subjects may take up arms and resist? And whether that case be now?</span>. It opened by denying that there was either scriptural or legal authority for armed resistance to the sovereign and firmly rejected parliament's claim to represent the people, arguing that the people's power had come from God and had long since been freely bestowed on God's anointed monarch, who had been limited thereafter by laws founded on that consent. Thus Parker was wrong to argue in his <span class="italic">Observations</span> that parliament, rather than the monarchy, was the best defender of the public interest. Published in the autumn of 1642 <span class="italic">The Resolving of Conscience</span> represented the first clear statement of the king's case from outside his inner circle, the more effective for its moderate and conservative thinking and, unlike some well-known anti-Calvinist works, for being presented in a tone which was never strident. Presses at Cambridge, York, and London encouraged its dissemination that winter, and a second edition was produced by the university printer at Oxford, Leonard Lichfield, early in 1643. Before the year was out the Commons at Westminster had resolved that the book was seditious and that its author should be sent for as a delinquent for composing and publishing it.<br>
<br>The impact of Ferne's book may be measured by the degree of criticism that it received from parliament's supporters, most notably from Charles Herle and Philip Hunton. Ferne responded in two further works, written after he had joined other royalist divines at Oxford, and both printed during 1643 at Lichfield's press: <span class="italic">Conscience Satisfied</span> in the spring and <span class="italic">A Reply unto Several Treatises Pleading for the Armes</span> later in the year. In the earlier work he addressed Charles Herle's <span class="italic">Fuller Answer to a Treatise Written by Dr Ferne</span> (1642), and clarified his own thinking on the three estates: to say they were mixed was not to regard them as equal; and while he still agreed that the estates were in some senses co-ordinate, and that they combined in law making, he now argued that the king remained supreme, with powers outside the reach of the two houses, such as &#145;the power of the sword and the defending of arms&#146;. Even so, he accepted that the king was still restrained by the laws of the constitution, and hoped that it might be possible to reach a compromise between the contending parties without an outright victory by either. In his <span class="italic">Reply</span> he was prepared to concede that conquest could be a legitimate means of taking a throne, but emphasized that it never could be when there was an heir apparent in waiting; and, as he told Hunton, it was always preferable to bear with the arbitrary actions of a legitimate king than to resort to violent action.<br>
<br>Taken together Ferne's three earliest works established him as a peaceably inclined and lucid contributor on the royalist side to the debate about the fundamental nature of sovereignty within the state; and he was soon to show himself a stout supporter of the Church of England. In all he was to have eleven books or pamphlets and two sermons published between 1642 and 1660, some in more than one edition. Until 1644 his printer continued to be Leonard Lichfield, but later publications, from 1647 onwards, when he was at a distance from Oxford, were invariably printed by or for Richard Royston, who had a press at Oxford but who had acquired a reputation for publishing what the parliamentary side regarded as scandalous books and papers in London. While still at Oxford Charles I promised Ferne the mastership of his old college, Trinity College, Cambridge, when it became available. Meanwhile Ferne proved himself to be a frequent preacher, and a sermon at St Mary's, Oxford, before the Commons at a public fast on 12 April 1644, subsequently published, confirmed his commitment to a peaceful outcome of the war. He was one of the learned clergy, led by Richard Steward, who attended the peace negotiations at Uxbridge in 1644&#150;5, during which he wrote <span class="italic">Episcopacy and Presbytery Considered</span> (1644), which arguably contributed more to the defence of the Church of England than it did to Charles's efforts to draw closer to the Scots.<h2>
<a name="Yorkshireandcontroversialwritingsofthe1650s"></a>Yorkshire and controversial writings of the 1650s</h2>In May 1645 Ferne accompanied the king when he left Oxford for the siege of Leicester, perhaps in hope of recovering his old living at Medbourne. He went from Leicester to Naseby in June and subsequently was quartered at the garrison at Newark until it was ordered by the king to surrender in May 1646. He had been finally replaced at Medbourne only on 19 March, when Thomas Doughty was instituted by order of the Lords, a week before the parish was ransacked by a party of royalist horse. Ferne retired to his native Yorkshire, where he remained with friends until parliament gave him and five other divines permission late in 1648 to attend the king on the Isle of Wight; they arrived on 17 November. He was chosen to preach on 29 November 1648 at Carisbrooke the last sermon Charles heard before his trial, taking his text from <span class="roman">Habukkuk</span> 2: 3. It was published in 1649, after the king's death.<br>
<br>In the 1650s Ferne seems again to have turned to his Yorkshire roots, spending much of his time peaceably enough with friends and relatives in an area between Doncaster, where his family had held local office in the late sixteenth century, and York, where there is evidence that he had a claim, relinquished in 1660, to the precentorship of the minster, and in various houses in the West Riding and beyond, several of them in the vicinity of Temple Belwood. It was helpful that Trinity College had a number of Yorkshire livings, and in addition to Masham, Ferne held the vicarage of Whitkirk near Leeds, which he surrendered at the Restoration; he had clergy friends in other Trinity vicarages in the county. The Nevill Smyths, too, had northern interests, having in 1631 bought property in Leeds, as well as associations with the duchy of Lancaster, notably through Henry Nevill Smyth's marriage to the daughter of Sir John Dacombe. One of Henry Ferne's kinsmen was schoolmaster at Tickhill, close to Sandbeck, where in August 1659 he made his will, preparatory to his journey to London to wait on the turn of events.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Ferne continued to protect the interests of the Church of England with his pen. With Henry Hammond and John Bramhall he engaged with continental Catholic commentators intent on presenting its current plight as a judgement of God on a schismatical people, a contention they hoped might draw the young Charles Stuart into the Church of Rome. In the early 1650s Ferne published three widely read works: <span class="italic">Of the Division between the English and the Romish Church</span> (1652), <span class="italic">Certain Considerations of Present Concernment Touching the Reformed Church of England</span> (1653), which pays tribute to Henry Hammond's defence of episcopacy, and <span class="italic">A Compendious Discourse</span> (1655). Between them they drove home the message that there was neither licence nor infallibility in the Church of England, but a willingness to allow its members to use their own minds and powers of reasoning in much the same way as Christ and his apostles had done. Carefully, Ferne also maintained that the protestant sects did not have the same justification for abandoning the Church of England as the Church of England had had in breaking away from Rome. Soon afterwards he found himself entangled with the republican James Harrington, after Harrington's sister had sent him an early copy of <span class="italic">Oceana</span> (1656). So restrained was his criticism, however, that Harrington, desperate to stir a reaction to his work, was goaded into publishing their exchange of letters in <span class="italic">Pian Piano</span> (1656), accompanied by what Brian Duppa subsequently condemned as a proud and insolent commentary directed against Ferne.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears16601662"></a>Final years, 1660&#150;1662</h2>As the Restoration approached Ferne joined an expectant group of leading divines in London. John Evelyn dined with them one night in December 1659, and later noted that most had since become bishops. Ferne was thought to be in line for the see of Bristol, but he evidently preferred the mastership of Trinity College, Cambridge. Backed by Charles I's promise in 1643, he petitioned Charles II while he was still at Breda; and, despite an understandable reluctance to make grants until he reached England, the new king proved ready to honour his father's undertaking. Ferne was granted the mastership of Trinity on 29 April 1660; but the going soon turned out to be hard. As late as July 1660 a group of its fellows petitioned enthusiastically for the retention of the popular John Wilkins, who had been appointed less than a year earlier, commending his &#145;prudent government and sweet conversation&#146;, and it was not until 3 August that Wilkins vacated his post  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1660&#150;61</i>, 101). Even then a hard core of interregnum appointees survived among the fellows. Ferne did what he could to restore the old order to the college, his task made easier when he became vice-chancellor, finding time that September to preach what Samuel Pepys thought &#145;a good honest sermon&#146; before Charles II in the chapel of Whitehall Palace  (Pepys, 1.237). Rivalries were everywhere apparent, however, and, as vice-chancellor, on 9 March 1661 he made the quickest return of any constituency in England and Wales of the candidates his university elected to the Cavalier Parliament. So swift was it that one of them, Sir Richard Fanshawe, had not been aware of his participation until Ferne wrote belatedly to congratulate him. Fanshawe, a client of Edward Hyde, who had been at Breda and quite possibly helped Ferne to secure the mastership, was surprised but gratified at an election that had cost him no more than &#145;a letter of thanks, a brace of bucks and twenty broad pieces of gold to buy [his electors] wine&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1660&#150;90</span>, 1.149).<br>
<br>Ferne served as prolocutor for the province of Canterbury in the lower house of convocation in 1661, and during the Savoy conference was in touch with the committee investigating the possibility of a compromise settlement with Richard Baxter, compiling a useful account of its dealings that July. He had been installed as dean of Ely on 12 March 1661, and on 3 December was nominated to the see of Chester, vacant on the death of Brian Walton five days earlier, shortly after he had paid it his first visit. Ferne was given leave to hold the mastership and bishopric <i>in commendam</i> for at least a year, and was consecrated in London on 9 February 1662, but he never reached his diocese, dying on 16 March 1662 at the house of one of his Nevill Smyth kinsmen in St Paul's Churchyard. As a mark of the Stuarts' gratitude his funeral was held in Westminster Abbey on 25 March, with the king represented, as Sir John Ferne might have allowed, by two of his heralds. He was buried in St Edmund's Chapel alongside relatives of kings and queens, and above his tomb a memorial brass displayed his family's arms and recorded his loyal service.<h2>
<a name="Legacy"></a>Legacy</h2>Ferne had never been well funded in his younger days, and he died too soon after the Restoration to have much improved his substance. His will, which he had not changed since 1659, revealed how limited were his means at the end of his life. He had never married, and left no landed estate. Apart from his books there were numerous small monetary bequests to friends and family. His sole executor, his stepbrother Thomas Nevill Smyth, a London draper, may have had difficulty in fulfilling them, and as late as November 1664 was granted exemption from supplying the usual gifts to the king made by executors of a bishop of Chester. Ferne's sole bequest to Trinity College was of &pound;10, which was to be unattributable, &#145;by way of restitution, rather fearing I did not discharge those petty Stewardshipps which I sometimes bore there soe faythfullie as I should&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/311, fol. 96<i>r</i>). Yet despite several changes of location during the 1640s and 1650s he had evidently managed to keep track of his books and their whereabouts. The bulk of them went to another stepbrother, Clement Nevill Smyth, for many years a fellow of Trinity; but to George Barry, his successor at Medbourne in 1661 and another fellow of Trinity, he left his copies of David Paraeus's works, which in their student days had suffered public burnings at Paul's Cross, Oxford, and Cambridge after a misplaced bout of Arminian indignation at their supposed support of resistance in the cause of religion.<br>
<br>Ferne was not a man to get heated or to take extreme positions. His value to the king's cause in the war years rested largely on his readiness to state, and then defend, a conventional case reasonably, readably, and with moderation. No original thinker, he became a prominent contributor to contemporary debate as his quickness into print made him a familiar target for critics as varied as Herle and Hunton, Sir Robert Filmer and Edward Gee, Henry Parker and James Harrington. Like other royalists he failed to dispose of the awkward proposition that if the king was supreme and parliament had no right to rebel against him, then it followed that in a context where parliament was none the less opposing him, the king's supremacy, as expressed in his right to determine public policy, mattered very little without legislative power. But although too few of the king's subjects were persuaded to think as he did, Ferne's aim was always to look towards a lasting settlement. To that end he played his part, after Charles I's execution, in maintaining the integrity of the reformed Church of England against opportunist attacks from continental Catholics and over twenty years he proved himself to be a resolute exponent of constitutional royalism.<br>
