<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hughes,  Emlyn Walter</span>  (1947&#150;2004), <span class="occ">footballer and television sports personality</span>, was born on 28 August 1947 in Risedale Maternity Hospital, Barrow in Furness. He was the second of three brothers, the son of (William) Frederick Hughes, known as Ginger, and his wife, Anne Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clarke. His father was a self-employed tarmacadam contractor and a semi-professional rugby league player for Barrow, Workington, Wales, and the British Rugby League Lions. Emlyn came from prime sporting stock&#151;his aunt played hockey for England. Ginger Hughes, a larger-than-life character and occasional unlicensed bookmaker at nearby Cartmel races, was from Llanelli in south Wales. He was an enormous influence on his middle son, whetting his early appetite for racing and sport with tall tales about the uncompromising northern rugby league star Gus Risman.<br>
<br>Hughes's older brother, David, eventually followed his father by playing rugby league, for Barrow and Blackpool Borough. Emlyn also delighted Fred Hughes by playing rugby league for Barrow Boys while at Risedale secondary modern school. But after turning to football Emlyn was rejected at fifteen by Barrow FC for being too small, and he briefly became an apprentice garage mechanic. It was Ginger Hughes who convinced his friend the Blackpool FC boss Ron Suart to give his middle son a football trial. The first division club eventually agreed to the signing, but only on condition that the scrawny boy be &#145;bulked up&#146; at home on protein-rich foods.<br>
<br>After eighteen months in the Blackpool A and B teams Hughes was offered a professional contract by Suart on &pound;8 per week. Soon after, the club's reserve left back Johnny Prentis broke his leg and the predominantly right-footed Hughes was promoted into a position that became his own. In the spring of 1966 he made his Blackpool first team d&eacute;but, at Blackburn Rovers, typically enraging the Ewood Park regulars with his rough treatment of the veteran local hero Bryan Douglas. The raw-edged youngster had arrived as a professional footballer. In the 1966&#150;7 season Hughes played twenty-eight times for a Blackpool side facing relegation.<br>
<br>Hughes was now being tracked by a number of top managers, including Liverpool's Bill Shankly. Shankly was especially impressed by the physical presence, sheer competitiveness, and cold-eyed nerve of the young defender. He offered &pound;25,000 for Hughes immediately after his Blackpool d&eacute;but. It was rejected. Under Shankly's gaze Hughes later accidentally broke the leg of the Chelsea star Peter Osgood during a lively FA cup tie at Stamford Bridge. A hostile crowd and intimidation from the Chelsea players and manager, Tommy Docherty, left Hughes undisturbed. The Liverpool boss had seen enough: in March 1967 he agreed to pay &pound;65,000 for the full-back. That night Shankly scolded a traffic police officer who foolishly stopped his car ferrying the new signing back to Merseyside. What was he doing, holding up a &#145;future captain of England&#146;? Hughes was nineteen years old.<br>
<br>Shankly was slowly rebuilding the great Liverpool team of the early 1960s, with Hughes replacing the graceful Willie Stevenson on the left side of midfield. His leadership, boyish enthusiasm, and immense power made Hughes an instant favourite of the crowd at Anfield and eventually a great Liverpool player. Early on he revealed his rugby league roots at his new club by hauling down Newcastle United's Albert Bennett in a bear hug as the flying winger threatened to get the better of him. For this, and for his arm-flapping, head-down, all-action running style, the amused Liverpool crowd affectionately christened Hughes Crazy Horse, a label that stuck throughout his career and was the title of his autobiography, published in 1980.<br>
<br>With this young tyro as its heartbeat Liverpool won the league title in 1973 (the first of four at Liverpool for Hughes) and also the UEFA cup in the same year, the club's first European trophy. Hughes's England career, which had begun against the Netherlands in 1969, eventually produced sixty-two caps (fifty-nine while at Liverpool) though he was only a squad member at the 1970 world cup finals and was later mysteriously ignored for eighteen months by the England manager Don Revie. His England service&#151;mainly at left back and with twenty-three caps as captain&#151;coincided with a poor period for the national team. But it was the regular experience in Europe for both Liverpool and England that led Shankly and later Bob Paisley to use Hughes more in a centre back role for his club. Success in European football required mobile, ball playing centre halves rather than the lumbering giants that were still dominant in the English game.<br>
<br>In 1973 the ambitious Hughes urged Shankly to replace the Liverpool captain, Tommy Smith, with someone younger: Shanks took note. So in 1974 it was Hughes, not Smith, who lifted the FA cup for Liverpool after a Wembley rout of Newcastle United. Smith never forgave Hughes for this act of personal treachery and often during matches the Liverpool hard man happily urged opponents to &#145;get stuck into&#146; his centre back partner. The incorrigible Hughes could also irk others in the Liverpool dressing room&#151;and even later some devoted fans&#151;with his outspoken opinions and especially his pro-monarchist and publicly expressed right-of-centre political leanings. His later celebrity persona and support of Margaret Thatcher also went down poorly in many parts of Liverpool in the 1980s. On 1 July 1972 Hughes married Barbara, daughter of Leslie Dixon; they had two children, Emlyn and Emma.<br>
<br>After Bill Shankly retired in 1974 Liverpool, now under Bob Paisley, tightened their grip on the league, winning further titles in 1976, 1977, and 1979. Under Hughes's captaincy Liverpool also won the UEFA cup in 1976 and consecutive European cups, in 1977 and 1978. These achievements, and a footballer of the year award in 1977, were the crowning moments of Hughes's football career. A serious knee injury and the emergence of Alan Hansen as a rival for his place in the team finally signalled the beginning of the end at Anfield for Hughes, after 665 appearances and forty-eight goals. But he did manage to convince Paisley to select him for one last major match for Liverpool: at left back in a 1979 FA cup semi-final against Manchester United. It was a typical piece of Hughes self-confidence, but an uncharacteristically sentimental misjudgement by Paisley. The defender was blamed for United's winning goal in a replay. It was his last appearance for the Merseyside club.<br>
<br>In August 1979 Hughes moved to Wolverhampton Wanderers for &pound;90,000 and in his first season he steered his new club to a league cup triumph&#151;ironically a trophy he had failed to win at Liverpool. Appointed an OBE in 1980, Hughes left Wolves in July 1981 to work as player&#150;manager at second-division Rotherham United, hauling the modest south Yorkshire club close to promotion to the top flight in his first season in charge. But by the spring of 1983 Hughes had been sacked and become disillusioned with football management. He moved on to play briefly for Hull City and for his old Liverpool ally John Toshack at Swansea City, before retiring in November 1983.<br>
<br>After leaving football Hughes found a comfortable niche as a television sports personality, notably as a team captain on BBC's popular quiz show <span class="italic">A Question of Sport</span>. In 1987 he invited his adored equestrian &#145;friend&#146; Princess Anne to be one of his panel members: 17 million viewers tuned in, agog, to see him praise his royal guest: &#145;Well done mate, you can come back again&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 10 Nov 2004). Hughes's TV work eventually dried up, but he kept up his personal and after-dinner appearances, local radio work, his involvement in horseracing, and a range of business interests. Typically, even after undergoing surgery for a brain tumour in 2003, the former England captain could be found bravely and provocatively addressing audiences of England football fans at public events organized by the FA. Hughes began treatment for cancer in February 2004, and died from a brain tumour at his home, 13A Whirlow Park Road, Whirlow, Sheffield, on 9 November that year. Crazy Horse was survived by his wife, Barbara, and their two children. In April 2008 a statue of Hughes was unveiled in Barrow in Furness; it stands on Abbey Road, outside a new office complex, Emlyn Hughes House.<br>
