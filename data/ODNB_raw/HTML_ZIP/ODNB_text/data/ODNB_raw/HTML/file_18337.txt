<span class="headword">Matilda</span> <span class="st"> [Matilda of Boulogne]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1103&#150;1152), <span class="occ">queen of England, consort of King Stephen</span>, was the only legitimate child and heir of Eustace (III), count of Boulogne and one of the wealthiest landholders in England. Her mother, Mary, was the younger daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18044/', "Queen Margaret")</script> and<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17859/', "Malcolm III, king of Scots")</script>, whose elder daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18336/', "Matilda")</script>, had married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12948/', "Henry I of England")</script>. Boulogne, with the port of Wissant, controlled one of the most important channel crossings to England, and the extensive properties of the honour of Boulogne in England, particularly in Essex and the south-east, made the marriage of its heir of paramount importance to King Henry. He approved her union with his favourite nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26365/', "Stephen")</script>, already count of Mortain. In 1125, after the marriage, Count Eustace abdicated to retire to a Cluniac monastery, and Matilda became countess of Boulogne in her own right.<br>
<br>The granddaughter on one side of Margaret of Scotland and on the other of Ida, countess of Bouillon, Matilda was a woman of strong and pious character, and her upbringing prepared her for the tasks of government. When in 1135 Henry I died, and Matilda's husband Stephen seized the English throne in defiance of the claims of Henry's daughter, the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18338/', "Empress Matilda")</script>, the new queen (as she was always styled, though there is no evidence of a formal coronation) proved an invaluable help and support to her husband. She used her knowledge of continental politics, and her control of an effective fleet and an important stretch of the channel coast round Boulogne, to the best advantage. She was also instrumental in securing the support of a strong and ruthless troop of Flemish mercenaries, led by her kinsman William of Ypres. Her kinship network was valuable in her work as a negotiator and peacemaker, though, since her cousin and rival the empress shared some close family contacts with her, the advantage was not always on the queen's side in the long run.<br>
<br>Hostilities between Stephen and the empress (aided by her second husband, Geoffrey, count of Anjou) began immediately; but it was when widespread resistance broke out in England in 1138 that Matilda's practical help was needed. She brought up a land force to besiege Dover, held for the empress by Walchelin Maminot, and sent word to her friends and kinsmen and vassals in Boulogne to blockade the port by sea, so reducing the garrison to surrender. Her next direct interventions in the struggle were through diplomacy. According to Richard of Hexham, she played a leading part in securing peace with her uncle, David, king of Scots, who, though defeated in the battle of the Standard in August 1138, remained a threat to the north of England. The outcome of the negotiations was the peace of Carlisle (9 April 1139), which (as Richard of Hexham notes) was opposed by some English magnates, and (according to Orderic Vitalis) seen by some of King David's counsellors to be to the advantage of the Scots. David was heavily bribed with territory in the north of England, and his son Henry was betrothed to Ada de Warenne, daughter of the earl of Surrey.<br>
<br>After completing the negotiations Matilda accompanied Henry south to Nottingham, to join Stephen's court for the confirmation of the treaty. Next, relying on her continental connections, she set about brokering the marriage of her son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46704/', "Eustace")</script> with Constance, sister of Louis VII of France. After the empress came to England in 1139 and established a centre of resistance with her half-brother, Robert, earl of Gloucester, the importance of France as a bulwark against Geoffrey of Anjou's attacks on Normandy became clearer than ever. Stephen had already taken Eustace on his one visit to Normandy in 1137, and had persuaded Louis to receive Eustace's homage for the duchy. In February 1140 Matilda took her son overseas for betrothal to Constance, and brought his bride back to England. At Whitsuntide she assisted the papal legate, Henry, bishop of Winchester, in an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a peace between the two contending parties. But it was during the ensuing period of open war, and near disaster for Stephen, that she played her most important role in government.<br>
<br>After Stephen's defeat and capture at the battle of Lincoln (2 February 1141) and the temporary defection of Henry of Winchester to the side of the empress, the queen acted as regent and kept up the struggle on behalf of her husband. Appeals for his release fell on deaf ears, and she turned her attention to raising troops and working tirelessly by persuasion and purchase to win back Geoffrey de Mandeville and other magnates who had gone over to the empress. By bringing William of Ypres and his Flemish mercenaries to threaten London, she induced the Londoners, already disillusioned by the intransigence of the empress, to rise against her and prevent her coronation. At Guildford the queen met Henry of Winchester, already wavering in his support of the Angevins, and secured his return to the king's cause. When he was besieged by the empress in his cathedral city of Winchester, she brought up her Flemish troops and a strong band of Londoners, as well as the magnates loyal to her, and besieged the besiegers. In the ensuing rout Robert of Gloucester was captured and brought to her castle of Rochester, to be kept in honourable captivity until he could be exchanged for the king. At Christmas 1141 Matilda wore her crown beside Stephen in Canterbury Cathedral.<br>
<br>In the later stages of the civil war Matilda played an important, if less dramatic part, watching the continental alliances and trying to smooth relations between Stephen and the church, so as to secure the coronation of their son Eustace. When a quarrel between Stephen and Archbishop Theobald in 1148 led to the expulsion of the latter from England, she provided a refuge for him in St Omer until peace could be re-established. Her influence was not strong enough to persuade the pope to permit the coronation of Eustace. But her courage and determination was decisive in enabling Stephen to retain the throne as long as he lived.<br>
<br>Much of Matilda's energy in her last years went into pious works. Her great wealth had made donations to religious foundations possible from an early age. She had a close friendship with Gervase, abbot of Arrouaise, whom she had known at her father's court, and it was probably she who encouraged the settlement of the first Arrouaisian canons in England. She gave generously to the templars to found the preceptories of Temple Cowley (Oxfordshire) and Cressing (Essex), both in 1136. Perhaps her most important new foundation, made jointly with her husband, was at Faversham, an abbey first colonized by Cluniac monks from Bermondsey, but (like Henry I's abbey at Reading) thereafter freed from dependence on any other Cluniac house; in 1148&#150;9 she spent some time in Canterbury, at St Augustine's, to supervise its foundation. She also established a nunnery at Lillechurch (later known as Higham), to provide for her daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54455/', "Mary of Blois")</script>, who had been placed as a child in Stratford Priory, but was now made prioress of the new house at Lillechurch. Matilda also founded the hospital of St Katharine by the Tower in London, dependent on Holy Trinity, Aldgate. Support for the Cistercians was shown in her foundation, with her husband, of Coggeshall Abbey in 1140, and in her donations to Mortemer before Normandy was captured by the Angevins. In April 1152 she fell ill at Castle Hedingham, Essex, where she died on 3 May, three days after sending for her confessor, Ralph, prior of Holy Trinity, Aldgate. She was buried at Faversham Abbey.<br>
<br>Two of her children, Baldwin and Matilda, predeceased her. Eustace, who had assumed the title of count of Boulogne in 1146, died in 1153, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46707/', "William")</script>, who was count of Boulogne from 1153, died during the Toulouse campaign of 1159. Her daughter Mary was then made to return to the world and marry, in order to preserve the Boulogne inheritance.<br>
