<span class="headword">Baillie,  John</span>  (1741&#150;1806), <span class="occ">minister of the Secession church</span>, was trained for the ministry by John Swanston of Kinross and became minister to the Carliol Street congregation in Newcastle upon Tyne about 1769. He was a popular preacher, but his convivial habits resulted in behaviour inappropriate for a minister and led eventually to his suspension in 1784. He drifted into debtor's prison but managed to escape to Scotland, where from 1786 to 1789 he was minister at the Crief Relief Presbyterian Chapel. He married about 1776, but nothing is known of his wife.<br>
<br>After clearing his debts and returning to Newcastle in 1789, Baillie for a short time assisted William Tinwell, the author of a treatise on arithmetic, in running a school in the Dog Bank. Afterwards he returned to preaching, first in a schoolroom in St Nicholas's churchyard at Newcastle, then at Malling's Rigg Chapel, Sunderland (1791&#150;6), and from 1797 at the old Postern Chapel, Newcastle, which his friends had refurbished for his use.<br>
<br>During his second period in Newcastle, Baillie was obliged to supplement his ministerial income by writing and by assisting his daughter, Frances, who kept a school in Pilgrim Street, Newcastle, and later at Gateshead. Among his published works are several religious treatises and sermons, including one occasioned by the death of Frances in 1801. He also wrote several historical works, such as <span class="italic">An Impartial History of the Town and County of Newcastle-upon-Tyne</span> (1801) and <span class="italic">A History of the French Wars</span> (1802). He was considered to be a scholar of some ability and was a member of the prestigious Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Society. Baillie died at Gateshead on 12 December 1806 and was buried in the nonconformist necropolis at Ballast Hills, Newcastle.<br>
