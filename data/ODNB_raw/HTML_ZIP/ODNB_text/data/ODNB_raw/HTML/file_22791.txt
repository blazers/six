<span class="headword">Priestman,  John</span>  (1805&#150;1866), <span class="occ">manufacturer of worsted goods and peace campaigner</span>, son of Joshua and Hannah Priestman, was born at Thornton, near Pickering, Yorkshire, where his ancestors had lived for more than 200 years. He is believed to have been educated at the Society of Friends' school at Ackworth, Yorkshire, and apprenticed to an uncle, a tanner at York, but at nineteen he joined his brother-in-law James Ellis in the Old Corn Mill, Bradford. Together they founded the first ragged school in Bradford, in a room at the top of one of their mills. Priestman was one of the founders in 1832 of the Friends' Provident Institution, a society whose conspicuous success was due to economic management and the temperate habits of the members, and he remained on the board of directors until his death.<br>
<br>In early life Priestman became a free-trader, and he represented Bradford at many of the conferences called by the Anti-Corn Law League. A staunch Liberal, he was twice invited, and twice declined, to stand as a parliamentary candidate for Bradford. Priestman and his partner Ellis actively resisted the collection of church rates. For refusal to pay the rate for 1835 they were summoned before the magistrates; and, partly because of the publicity surrounding their case, the rate was not levied again in their parish.<br>
<br>Chiefly from a desire to utilize the surplus power of machinery in his mills, Priestman in 1838 commenced manufacturing worsted goods in an upper room. He removed to larger premises in Preston Place in 1845, and in 1855 he abandoned corn milling altogether. His treatment of the millhands, chiefly women and girls, was sympathetic and enlightened, and they grew so refined that his works became known as &#145;Lady Mills&#146;. He successfully introduced a system of profit sharing with part of his workforce.<br>
<br>Much of Priestman's time and money was devoted to the causes of peace and temperance. From 1834, when the Preston &#145;teetotallers&#146; first visited Bradford, he adopted total abstinence. At the same time he and his partner relinquished malt crushing, a process in the manufacture of beer, which was the most profitable part of their milling business. He was one of the few supporters of Richard Cobden in his condemnation of the Crimean War and he seconded the unpopular anti-war resolution proposed by Cobden at a great meeting at Leeds in 1854. In 1855 he was elected a town councillor, but resigned before taking his seat.<br>
<br>Priestman married on 28 November 1833 Sarah, daughter of Joseph Burgess of Beaumont Lodge, Leicester, who died in 1849, leaving two sons and a daughter. In 1852 he married Mary, daughter of Thomas Smith, miller, of Uxbridge, Middlesex, who survived him; they had two sons.<br>
<br>A stern adherent to Quaker principles through life, after three months of illness Priestman died suddenly while dressing at his home at Whetley Hill, Bradford, on 29 October 1866; he was buried on 2 November in the Undercliffe cemetery, Bradford; 1100 of his workpeople attended the funeral.<br>
