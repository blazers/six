<span class="headword">Closs,  August Max</span>  (1898&#150;1990), <span class="occ">German scholar</span>, was born on 9 August 1898 at Neumarkt, Styria, Austria, the son of Alois Closs (1852&#150;1909), an official at the local law court, and his wife, Rosa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Halm (1872&#150;1960). After schooling at the F&uuml;rstbisch&ouml;fliches Gymnasium, Graz, from 1906 to 1916, he served in the Austrian army until 1918, when he was taken prisoner by the Italians. After his release he studied German and English at the University of Graz from 1919 to 1923, writing his doctoral thesis on the poet and dramatist Arno Holz under Bernhard Seuffert. After obtaining a teaching qualification at the University of Vienna in 1924 he taught at a school there for five years.<br>
<br>In 1929 Closs moved to England, first working with Leonard Willoughby as assistant lecturer in German at the University of Sheffield, then moving to University College, London, in 1930, where he came under the spell of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98340/', "Robert Priebsch")</script>, the professor of German. On 20 June 1931, at Hampstead register office, he married Priebsch's daughter, <a href="#cosubject_101135">Hannah [<i>see below</i>]</a>. They had one daughter, (Olwen Eleanor) Elizabeth (who, as Elizabeth Closs Traugott, became professor of linguistics and English at Stanford University, teaching there from 1970 to 2003).<br>
<br>In 1931 Closs was appointed lecturer and head of the department of German at the University of Bristol, being promoted to reader in 1936 and professor in 1948. Before and after his retirement in 1964 he spent periods as visiting professor at universities in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the USA, Canada, and even India, where he advised Nehru on the reform of Indian universities. He received the grand cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, the cross of honour <i>litteris et artibus</i> from Austria, and honorary doctorates from the Technical University of Hannover and the University of Bristol.<br>
<br>Something of Closs's character is caught in the bronze busts of him sculpted by the Bristol artist Ernest Pascoe. A gracious, charming man in an old-fashioned Austrian manner, he seemed in later life almost the archetypal professor of popular imagination, with straggly white hair, wayward handwriting, and an infectious enthusiasm for anything that caught his attention. Like Goethe he believed that literature could have an effect on individuals and mould them into world citizens. As a teacher he had a rare ability to bring poetry alive, and published on it prolifically. His best-known book, <span class="italic">The Genius of the German Lyric</span> (1938, revised 1962), an investigation into the formal and metaphysical values of German lyric poetry, was remarkable for its breadth of reference and was warmly received by reviewers, though Closs's London colleague Jethro Bithell, unimpressed by his idiosyncratic approach, told a friend he had submitted &#145;a voluminous and withering report&#146; on it to a publisher; likewise, Bithell said he could not &#145;imagine how a Swiss publisher found it possible to accept&#146; Closs's <span class="italic">Die freien Rhythmen in der deutschen Lyrik</span> (1947, dedicated to Priebsch's memory)  (Bithell to R. Majut, 6 Aug 1948, Bithell papers, Institute of Germanic and Romance Studies, University of London). Closs's later books included a collection of essays focusing on the theme of reality and poetic symbol in German poetry from the middle ages to post-1945, published as <span class="italic">Medusa's Mirror</span> (1957, dedicated to the memory of his wife); he edited a four-volume <span class="italic">Introduction to German Literature</span> (1967&#150;71), as well as several medieval texts and anthologies of German verse, and contributed articles to many German and British scholarly journals and reference works. His enduring admiration for the scholarly work of his father-in-law expressed itself in his editing of some of Priebsch's unpublished work, notably his <span class="italic">Letter from Heaven</span> (1936, repr. 1975) and <span class="italic">Christi Leiden in einer Vision geschaut</span> (1936), as well as of an absorbing selection from Priebsch's scholarly correspondence with the German philologist Elias von Steinmeyer between 1892 and 1922 (1979).<br>
<br>Closs's home was an elegant early eighteenth-century house, hidden behind mysterious yews and an enormous mulberry tree, at 40 Stoke Hill, Stoke Bishop, Bristol. Living in an aesthetic, poetic world, seemingly oblivious of all that was mundane or garish, he lovingly tended his fine assemblage of artistic treasures and the valuable library he and his wife had inherited from Priebsch. The integrity of this collection of medieval manuscripts, incunabula, and other early printed books, with many first editions of German classicism and romanticism, as well as early German translations of Shakespeare, and notable holdings of translations of plays from and into German, was compromised already in 1969 when 273 sixteenth-century items were purchased by Princeton University. The substantial remainder went to form the core of the Priebsch&#150;Closs collection at the Institute of Germanic and Romance Studies of the University of London, which was augmented after his death by further books and papers, including his extensive correspondence with colleagues and authors, among them J. R. R. Tolkien, Thomas Mann, and E. M. Forster, as well as 120 letters from L. P. Hartley which Closs had proposed to publish.<br>
<br>Despite his apparent unworldliness Closs played a major role in the town-twinning movement through his initiative to re-establish cultural relations with Germany after the Second World War. In 1947, with special permission of the Foreign Office, he led five &#145;men of goodwill&#146; from Bristol city council, the university, and the chamber of commerce to Hannover &#145;to explore the possibility of establishing useful contacts between the two famous cities, both of which had suffered serious war damage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Times</span>, 24 Feb 2004). There were no previous links of note between the cities; the people behind the partnership were motivated primarily by their awareness of the strong historical links between Hannover and Great Britain, through the royal family. This &#145;expedition&#146; (as it was officially described) was to concern itself only with aid and cultural matters. Subsequently a working committee was established in Bristol to support and develop contacts with Hannover in five main fields: relief, education, church contacts, youth exchanges, and music. In recognition of the part Closs played he was awarded honorary citizenship of Hannover in 1987.<br>
<br>Closs died at Ham Green Hospital, Pill, Bristol, on 21 June 1990, of heart failure. A magnificent memorial service, framed with the music of Mozart, was held at St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, on 2 November 1990, in which the <i>Oberb&uuml;rgermeister</i> of Hannover took an active part.<br>
<br>Closs's wife, <a name="cosubject_101135"></a><span class="headword">Hannah Margaret Mary Closs <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Priebsch]</span></span>  (1905&#150;1953), <span class="occ">art critic and novelist</span>, was born at 29 Haverstock Hill, Hampstead, London, on 6 December 1905, the daughter of Robert Priebsch (1866&#150;1935), German scholar, and his wife, Ada Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rademacher (also known as Radmar). Her <span class="italic">Art and Life</span> (1936), on aesthetics, won an award from the Eugene Field Society in the United States, and her re-working of the Tristan story (1940) also won plaudits. She wrote a trilogy of novels involving the Albigensians, <span class="italic">High are the Mountains</span> (1945), <span class="italic">And Sombre are the Valleys</span> (1949, reissued in 1960 as <span class="italic">Deep are the Valleys</span>), and the posthumously published <span class="italic">The Silent Tarn</span> (1955). She was described by W. E. Collinson, a student of her father, as &#145;singularly gifted and charming&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 15 Oct 1953). She died of toxaemia at Bristol General Hospital on 8 October 1953. Her three novels were re-published as the <span class="roman">Tarn Trilogy</span> in 1978.<br>
