<span class="headword">Baines,  Thomas</span>  (1806&#150;1881), <span class="occ">journalist, newspaper proprietor, and local historian</span>, was born in Leeds, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1089/', "Edward Baines (1774&#150;1848)")</script> and Charlotte Talbot, and younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1092/', "Matthew Talbot Baines")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1090/', "Sir Edward Baines")</script>. Both his father and brother represented Leeds in parliament, and Baines was a liberal in the family tradition, although he was no friend of advanced radicalism. On moving to Liverpool he acquired and transformed <span class="italic">Billinge's Advertiser</span> into the <span class="italic">Liverpool Times</span>, a paper he was to edit for nearly thirty years until 1858, when it finally fell victim to the competition of the new cheap daily press. Having married Fanny Higgins, daughter of councillor Vincent Higgins, Baines developed good local political connections: two of his daughters were to marry prominent members of the council, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37799/', "Edmund Knowles Muspratt")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38693/', "Arthur Bower Forwood")</script>. Encouraged by local support, Baines hoped to assume personal responsibility for the Liverpool office in London, an important channel of communication between the booming port and its MPs, proposing to run the office as an independent organization to which individuals, associations, and companies would subscribe. As it was, he was appointed to the vacant secretaryship of the office in 1858 as the paid servant of the corporation of Liverpool and the mercantile associations, and also found himself required to serve as personal secretary for the Liverpool MPs. No other municipality had a London office, a reflection of Liverpool's commercial pre-eminence in the mid-nineteenth century and its aspirations to the status of second metropolis, motifs which informed Baines's encyclopaedic studies <span class="italic">History of the Commerce and Town of Liverpool</span> (1852) and <span class="italic">Liverpool in 1859</span> (1859). Along with his other main works of local history, <span class="italic">Lancashire and Cheshire Past and Present</span> (1868&#150;9) and <span class="italic">Yorkshire Past and Present</span> (1875), Baines's writings, as the <span class="italic">Liverpool Daily Courier</span> obituary notice aptly commented, were &#145;more marked by minuteness of research than for tact in compilation&#146;. His liberalism is perhaps most apparent in his response to the flood of Irish immigration into Liverpool. Concern at the costly burden on local poor relief resources was balanced by sympathy for the destitute famine migrants. Irish landlords were taken to task in his study <span class="italic">Agricultural Resources of Great Britain, Ireland and the Colonies</span> (1847), which called for Irish poor-law reform and government assistance for overseas emigration. In journalism he had a particular aptitude for reporting military matters with both expert knowledge and clarity. The &#145;obliged friend and servant&#146; of the corporation of Liverpool and the commercial associations of the port, Baines continued to work for the Liverpool office until his sudden death on 31 October 1881 at Seaforth Hall, near Liverpool, the residence of one of his daughters, Mrs E. K. Muspratt. He was survived by six of his seven children.<br>
