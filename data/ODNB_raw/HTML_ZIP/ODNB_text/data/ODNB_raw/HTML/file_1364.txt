<span class="headword">Bardwell,  Thomas</span>  (1704&#150;1767), <span class="occ">painter and writer</span>, lived most of his life in East Anglia and was probably born there. Talley gives three possible ancestral sources: he was probably connected to the Bardwells associated with Woodton Hall in Norfolk, but there are also claims for the Bardwells of Southwold in Suffolk; there is a possibility that his parents were James Bardwell and Dorothy Hacon, who married at Ditchingham, Norfolk, on 26 November 1702  (Talley, 93&#150;5).<br>
<br>Bardwell started in the 1720s as a decorative painter in Norfolk, and by 1732 had a thriving business in Bungay, employing at least one apprentice. In 1738 he handed over the decorative painting to his younger brother, Robert, in order to develop his career as a portraitist in oils. His first known dated painting is a conversation piece from 1736, the <span class="italic">Brewster Family</span>  (Talley, no. 114, 15d). Thereafter he established a good local clientele and may also have worked in London; in 1740&#150;41 he produced the portraits <span class="italic">John Campbell, Duke of Argyll</span>, and <span class="italic">David Garrick</span>, newly acclaimed as Richard III at Goodman's Fields (respectively NPG and Russell-Cotes Art Gallery, Bournemouth). In 1752 he journeyed to Scotland, via Yorkshire, painting a number of portraits and some decorative work. He was back in the south by the end of 1753 and from 1759 to the end of his life thrived as a portraitist in Norwich.<br>
<br>Bardwell was probably self-taught as an artist, though Talley speculates whether he might have come into contact with the Norfolk portraitists D. Heins and Thomas Page, and the London painters J.-B. Van Loo and Joseph Van Aken. Stylistically his work is in the manner of Thomas Hudson, London's most successful portraitist during the 1740s, but there are also compositional references to Van Dyck. In addition, many sitters wear the shiny &#145;Van Dyck&#146; costume which was fashionable for portraiture at the time. Formats range from portrait busts to life-size full lengths. A notebook containing drawings after finished portraits has been confidently attributed to Bardwell by Ellen Miles.<br>
<br>By the early nineteenth century Bardwell was remembered more as a copyist of paintings than as a portraitist (<span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, after Edwards), and he might be little known as a painter, had it not been for his book, <span class="italic">The Practice of Painting and Perspective Made Easy</span>. Published in London in 1756 after a royal licence, it was dedicated to the earl of Rochford, whose <span class="italic">Portrait with Horse and Groom</span> he had painted in 1741 (Brodick Castle, Arran). &#145;the Works of <i>Van Dyck</i> and <i>Rembrandt</i> are the surest Guides to Nature&#146;, wrote Bardwell in the introduction, while describing how the book arose from a private attempt to recapture the lost art of great colouring. &#145;It is out of these most excellent Masters, that I have established my Method: &hellip; From them I have learned the Virgin Teints, and finishing Secrets; tho' I have always applied them to practice from Nature.&#146; He drew on many earlier authors, principally the French theorists Roger de Piles and C.-A. Du Fresnoy, but for all that it is an original thesis: the practical instructions, though presented in a traditional format, resulted from genuine study of seventeenth-century paintings in East Anglian collections, combining what he believed to be their technique with his own experience as a painter. Talley and Groen, and White, have established through analysis that he applied most of the methods to his own work. Despite a disastrous contemporary review, the book went into two pirated editions in 1795 and 1840. Edwards noted its impact on youthful painters in its day, though he doubted the validity of the section on perspective.<br>
<br>Bardwell died a widower on 9 September 1767 and was buried on 11 September in the church of St Mary at Bungay. Most of his paintings remain in private collections. Public collections not cited above include the Castle Museum, Norwich; the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; and the Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne.<br>
