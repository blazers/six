<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Oppenheimer, Sir  Francis Charles</span>  (1870&#150;1961), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 17 December 1870 at 1a Russell Square, Bloomsbury, London, the oldest of seven children of Sir Charles Oppenheimer (1836&#150;1900), City merchant and later British consul-general at Frankfurt am Main, and Bertha (<i>d</i>. 1919), daughter of Leopold Goldbeck, a Frankfurt cloth merchant. Francis Oppenheimer (he adopted the middle name Charles on being baptized into the Church of England in November 1892) was educated at the <i>Gymnasium</i> at Frankfurt, to which city his father had returned in 1875 for health reasons. In 1890 he went to Balliol College, Oxford, graduating with a second-class degree in jurisprudence in 1893. He was then articled to the chambers of Rufus Isaacs, later the marquess of Reading, and was called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1895, though he never intended to pursue a legal career. From 1896 he spent four years in Paris as a painter.<br>
<br>On his father's death in June 1900, Oppenheimer succeeded him to the unsalaried post of consul-general for the Prussian provinces of Hesse-Nassau and the grand duchy of Hesse and by Rhine, residing at Frankfurt. Between 1905 and 1912 he established for himself, through his commercial reports, a niche within the consular service which enabled him ultimately to transfer to the more prestigious diplomatic service. His friendship with his Oxford contemporary Arthur Ponsonby, then private secretary to the prime minister, and Sir Eyre Crowe, the Foreign Office's leading expert on German affairs, opened to him a direct channel of communication with Whitehall. The link with Crowe was particularly important for Oppenheimer's further career. The former appreciated the potential value of commercial reporting and the bearing of economic developments on politics. Having established a direct channel to the senior officials in Whitehall, it was the wide range and quality of the assiduously culled &#145;hard&#146; data in his commercial reports, skilfully combined with political and diplomatic gossip, that established Oppenheimer's high reputation. Though largely and ostensibly concerned with economic, commercial, and financial matters, these reports were remarkable because of the link that Oppenheimer was able to make between economic developments and German domestic and foreign politics&#151;and their diplomatic and strategic implications for Britain. In September 1909, in response to an Admiralty enquiry, he submitted a lengthy memorandum on the efficacy of a naval blockade of the German coastline in a war with Germany, which reinforced the recommendation of the committee of imperial defence to dispatch an expeditionary force to France rather than to rely on blockading the enemy. He also reported on German preparations for financial mobilization for war and concluded with the strong recommendation that Britain should be equally well prepared.<br>
<br>In the period between 1905 and 1912 Oppenheimer became known to a wider public. His printed commercial reports were frequently quoted in the press and in parliament; and David Lloyd George drew on Oppenheimer's memoranda on German social legislation when framing his own national insurance scheme. In October 1911 he praised Oppenheimer as &#145;one of the ablest consuls of the British empire&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 16 Oct 1911). Nevertheless, it was also during this period that Oppenheimer found himself the target of a press campaign against Britain's representatives in Germany, whose loyalty was impugned because of their German names. Although he was born a British subject, to many of his contemporaries Oppenheimer cut a somewhat &#145;outlandish&#146; figure and his German education had &#145;tinged [his] speech with a foreign accent&#146;  (Oppenheimer, 72). He took the unusual step of defending himself in a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span>:<blockquote>As I was born in London, took my degrees at Oxford, and am a member of the English bar, it is hardly correct to count me among &#145;the foreigners&#146;. If my family name does not sound English, I need hardly remind you that I share this disadvantage with a large proportion of the oldest families in England. (<span class="italic">Times Commercial Supplement</span>, 23 Oct 1908)</blockquote>His German-Jewish name was indeed a profound handicap for Oppenheimer. In 1911 the Foreign Office refrained from appointing him to the Paris consul-generalship for this very reason. These were ominous signs of what lay ahead of him.<br>
<br>In January 1912 Oppenheimer unprecedentedly secured promotion to a post in the diplomatic service with his appointment as commercial attach&eacute; for north-western Europe, with the rank of counsellor at the Berlin embassy. The outbreak of war in August 1914 marked a turning point in his career, cutting him off from the sources of information upon which his authority on German affairs had rested. In October 1914 he was sent as commercial attach&eacute; to The Hague. It was symptomatic of his ambiguous position in the wartime diplomatic service that he was posted to the Dutch capital without any specific instructions. He decided to devise a system to disrupt the flow of contraband goods through the Netherlands to the central powers. His initiative led to the establishment in November 1914 of the Netherlands Overseas Trust, an ostensibly private company which, in the course of the war, became one of the cornerstones of Britain's blockade policy. In early 1915 he was transferred to Bern, where he helped to establish the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Suisse de Surveillance &Eacute;conomique on similar lines. By November 1915 Oppenheimer was back at The Hague, where he spent the remainder of the war.<br>
<br>If in previous years Oppenheimer was sensitive about his German-Jewish family background, he now had good reason to be so. Throughout the war, and from January 1917 with increasing frequency, the Northcliffe press poured its vitriol over Britain's &#145;German&#146; representative in the Netherlands, apparently with the connivance of some members of the diplomatic service. Lord Robert Cecil's defence of the beleaguered Oppenheimer as &#145;a public official who had served this country during the war with great efficiency and experience&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 9 Nov 1917) helped to put an end to internal intrigues, but it could not silence the Northcliffe press. Lord Hardinge, the permanent under-secretary, evidently intimidated by the press campaign, used a minor dispute between Oppenheimer and the Dutch government as a pretext for his recall in September 1918. On his return to London he was told that in view of the growing prejudice against &#145;persons in the service with German names or German parentage&#146; it had been decided to send him on extended leave  (diary, 21 Oct 1918, Oppenheimer MSS, box 5). He was now only occasionally employed. A special mission to Vienna in 1919 to investigate the financial position of Austria provided a rare break from his involuntary indolence. Symptomatically, his recommendation of lenient financial terms to be imposed upon Austria was disregarded. The economic turmoil into which the Austrian republic was consequently thrown vindicated Oppenheimer. But by that time he had already decided to leave the diplomatic service. In his final interview with Lord Curzon he made no secret of the fact that &#145;in the service I had always been made to feel &hellip; an outsider&#146;  (memorandum, 15 Oct 1919, Oppenheimer MSS, box 6/2). In February 1920 Oppenheimer finally tendered his resignation, thus bringing to an end his short but notable diplomatic career.<br>
<br>Oppenheimer spent the remainder of his life entirely devoted to artistic pursuits, although he was actively involved in helping German-Jewish refugees to resettle in England in the 1930s. He had been knighted in 1907, and in 1919 he was also created KCMG. On 2 September 1931 he married Jane Shillaber, second daughter of Colonel Cunliffe Martin of the Bengal lancers, and divorcee of Sir Ernest Burford Horlick, second baronet. She had three children from her previous marriage; there were no children from her marriage to Oppenheimer. The latter published his memoirs, <span class="italic">Stranger Within</span>, in 1960. He died at his London home, 20 Lowndes Square, on 25 June 1961.<br>
