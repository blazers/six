<span class="headword">Fenton,  Henry John Horstman</span>  (1854&#150;1929), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 18 February 1854 in Ealing, the son of John Fenton, gentleman. He was educated at Magdalen College School, Oxford, and then entered King's College, London, to study chemistry under C. L. Bloxam. In 1875 he was awarded an exhibition in physical science from the Clothworkers' Company, and the following year he was awarded an entrance scholarship at Christ's College, Cambridge. He took the natural sciences tripos in 1877 with first-class honours, and was appointed an assistant demonstrator and shortly afterwards university demonstrator in chemistry. In 1904 he was given the title and status of university lecturer. With his fellow demonstrator he was jointly responsible for teaching in the university chemical laboratory, with increasing responsibilities as the old college laboratories began to close.<br>
<br>Although Fenton was active in research he made no great discoveries. He is remembered, however, in the context of Fenton's reagent&#151;hydrogen peroxide containing a trace of ferrous salt, used to convert &#945;-hydroxy acids to &#945;-keto acids. But it is as a superb teacher over some forty years that Fenton made his name. He took immense trouble in preparing his lectures and the experimental demonstrations that accompanied them. His striking appearance&#151;dark complexion, black hair, and athletic figure&#151;compelled attention and his air of languid weariness when lecturing was a pose which concealed an exceptionally acute mind. He avoided dogmatism and presented his subject as one open to debate. His mordant humour appealed to students, and it was by no means unusual for him to continue a lecture for half an hour in informal discussion with them. He paid equal attention to devising his courses of laboratory work, to which his <span class="italic">Notes on Qualitative Analysis</span> (1883) was a valuable accompaniment.<br>
<br>Although outspoken about others, Fenton was naturally shy and very sensitive to criticism of himself. He could be uncompromising in his opinions, persisting in his views even when in a minority of one. This trait sometimes created difficulties when he served on university bodies. At the same time he could be gentle with students; a thoughtless question would be sympathetically answered.<br>
<br>Fenton was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1899, serving on its council in 1913&#150;16, and he became an honorary fellow of Christ's College in 1911. On 6 December 1892 he married Edith Isabelle (<i>b</i>. 1870/71), daughter of George Ferguson of Richmond; they had no children. At seventy he retired to Hove, but his last years were greatly clouded by mental degeneration. He died on 13 January 1929 in Camberwell House, a London nursing home, survived by his wife.<br>
