<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gabo, Sir  Naum</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Neyemiya Borisovich Pevzner]</span>  (1890?&#150;1977), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 5 August, probably in 1890 and also probably in Klimovichi, Mogilev, in provincial south-west Russia (now in Belorussia), the seventh of the eight children of Boris Grigoryevich Pevzner (<i>c</i>.1850&#150;<i>c</i>.1929), the owner of a foundry in nearby Bryansk which produced alloys and machinery, and his wife, Fanny Borisovna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ozerskaya (<i>c</i>.1855&#150;<i>c</i>.1930). His parents, who were both Jewish, may have amended his year of birth in order that he might later avoid military service. The privileges which accompanied the flourishing of the Pevzner business meant that, when he was aged about eight, the entire family was able to join the father in the industrial town of Bryansk, outside the pale of settlement to which Russian Jews were normally confined. His father seems to have preserved a sense of his Jewish roots and religion in private, but Neyemiya Pevzner had a Russian Orthodox nanny and was baptized, a common practice among assimilated families.<h2>
<a name="YouthandearlycareerinRussia"></a>Youth and early career in Russia</h2>Pevzner seems to have been a rebellious youth. He was expelled from two local schools, and then was sent to Tomsk in Siberia, where his eldest brother, Mark, was studying. Between 1907 and 1910 he attended the <i>Gymnasium</i> in Kursk, south-east of Bryansk, where his principal love was literature. In his teens he developed a strong commitment to radical politics, especially after the failed 1905 revolution. He was particularly attracted to Peter Kropotkin's <span class="italic">Mutual Aid</span> (1902), a key text of communist anarchism. His interest in art was inspired by his elder brother Antoine Pevsner (Natan Pevzner), then an art student in Kiev, and his early drawings were mainly influenced by the work of the Russian symbolist painter Mikhail Vrubel.<br>
<br>Pevzner was under strong family pressure to pursue a career in medicine and in 1910 he enrolled at Munich University, where he attended courses in anatomy, physics, and chemistry. Although he remained fascinated with science, in 1912 he changed his registration to philosophy, and began to study logic and the ideas of Kant. He also started following courses in civil engineering at the Technische Hochschule in Munich (though he may not have been officially enrolled) and studying art history at the university, notably with Heinrich W&ouml;lfflin, under whose guidance he visited Italy in the summer of 1913. He also discovered avant-garde art and theory. He read Wilhelm Worringer's <span class="italic">Abstraktion und Einf&uuml;hlung</span> (1908) and Kandinsky's <span class="italic">&Uuml;ber das Geistige in der Kunst</span> (1912), and had opportunities to view the latest art in Munich, home of the Blaue Reiter group, and in Paris, which he visited in 1912 and 1913 to stay with Antoine.<br>
<br>The outbreak of the First World War compelled Pevzner to leave Germany without graduating. He and his younger brother Alexei settled in Christiania, where they were subsequently joined by Antoine. In these relatively tranquil circumstances he began experimenting with figurative sculptures which were constructed by joining together flat planar elements (initially of cardboard, later of wood and metal) so that form is permeated by space (such as <span class="italic">Constructed Head No. 1</span>, <i>c</i>.1916&#150;17, St&auml;delsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt am Main), in contrast to the solid volumes produced by the traditional methods of carving and modelling. His early works reflected the artistic examples of cubism and Russian icon painting, but also ideas of open-work structure and the separation of material strength from mass which were implicit in modern engineering structures. As a sign of his new sense of identity as a sculptor, he coined the pseudonym Gabo, to distinguish himself from his artist brother Antoine.<br>
<br>The brothers returned to Russia in the spring of 1917, after the February revolution. They settled in Moscow, and Gabo, like many avant-garde artists, was seized by enthusiasm for the new political order. In August 1920 he organized a small group exhibition in a bandstand on Tverskoy bulvar, which included more permanent realizations of the sculptures which he had begun to develop in Norway, such as the <span class="italic">Head No. 2</span> (iron, <i>c</i>.1916&#150;20, priv. coll.). To accompany the show he wrote <span class="italic">The Realistic Manifesto</span>, a polemical justification of his art, which was printed in the form of a poster and pasted up all over Moscow. He argued that the cubists and futurists had laid the foundations for a new art but had failed to convey the essence of the &#145;new age&#146;, whereas his works offered a distillation of the modern scientific world-view:<blockquote>With a plumb line in the hand, with eyes as precise as a ruler, with a spirit as taut as a compass, we build them in the same way as the universe builds its own creations, as the engineer his bridges, as the mathematician his formulae of the orbits. (<span class="italic">Gabo</span>, 1957, 151)</blockquote>Gabo proclaimed that art should be based on &#145;kinetic rhythms&#146; rather than static form. As an experiment in this direction, he produced <span class="italic">Kinetic Construction: Standing Wave</span> (1920, Tate collection), comprising a thin metal rod which is caused to vibrate by a motor, and through its oscillations describes a virtual volume or wave form in space. He also declared that art should be placed in the &#145;squares and streets&#146;, communicating progressive values to a mass audience. This attitude underlay a subsequent series of highly architectonic constructions, built up from geometrical elements, which he hoped would eventually be enlarged to a monumental scale and sited in the modern urban environment (for example, <span class="italic">Column</span>, <i>c</i>.1923, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York).<br>
<br>All Gabo's subsequent work was affected by the idealistic ethos of revolutionary Russia, and by the experimentation with purely abstract styles which he had encountered in the work of Russian avant-garde artists such as Kazimir Malevich and Vladimir Tatlin. By 1922, however, he was becoming disillusioned with the increasingly authoritarian character of the Soviet regime, the government's growing preference for realism in art, the erosion of avant-garde influence over artistic affairs, and the trend towards practical design, at the expense of art, among hardline Marxist artists such as Aleksandr Rodchenko. Gabo had been involved in artistic administration, and his contacts enabled him to leave Russia for Berlin in the spring of 1922, to help organize the &#145;Erste Russische Kunstausstellung&#146; (first Russian art exhibition) which opened that October. He settled in Berlin, where he encountered a sympathetic circle of artists and critics, and had ready access to modern materials such as glass, plastic, and metals, which had been hard to obtain in Moscow. He also met Elisabeth Richter (<i>c</i>.1900&#150;1929), the estranged wife of the artist Hans Richter, with whom he lived until her tragic death in childbirth in 1929.<h2>
<a name="YearsinGermany"></a>Years in Germany</h2>In the West Gabo became a leading representative of constructivism. The term suggested an art in tune with social, political, and scientific progress, as expressed by precise impersonal techniques, and geometric forms and materials more redolent of engineering structures, machinery, or scientific laboratories than the traditional artist's studio. By 1924 his work had been widely reproduced in avant-garde journals, and he had exhibited at the Galerie Percier in Paris alongside his brother Antoine, who had moved to Paris in 1923. In 1928 Gabo wrote an article for <span class="italic">Bauhaus</span> magazine denouncing the growing assimilation and vulgarization of constructivism by the worlds of fashion and design. His first one-man show, at the Kestner-Gesellschaft in Hanover in 1930, displayed the extensive body of sculpture which he produced in the 1920s, including <span class="italic">Construction in Space with Balance on Two Points</span> (<i>c</i>.1925, Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, Connecticut) and <span class="italic">Construction in Space: Soaring</span> (<i>c</i>.1929&#150;30, reassembled 1985, Leeds City Art Gallery).<br>
<br>Gabo's ambitions extended beyond the traditional sculptural object. In 1927, assisted by Antoine, he created the highly successful set and costumes for Serge Diaghilev's production of the ballet <span class="italic">La chatte</span>. The design was notable for its purely abstract forms and its use of transparent, reflective plastics, the visual impact of which was enhanced by dark backdrops and strong lighting. In 1931 he submitted an architectural design to the competition in Moscow for a new Palace of the Soviets (Shchusev Architectural Museum, Moscow). This reflected his long-standing interest in architecture, but also his continuing commitment to the Soviet experiment and his desire at this stage to establish an artistic reputation in his homeland.<h2>
<a name="FranceBritainandtheUnitedStates"></a>France, Britain, and the United States</h2>After the Nazis came to power in 1933, Gabo decided that it was imperative for him to leave Germany, and he subsequently spent three years in Paris, in conditions of profound poverty and depression, during which time he produced very little work. His career and spirits revived when he moved to London in the spring of 1936. He soon met and married Miriam Franklin, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Israels (1907&#150;1993), with whom he lived very happily for the rest of his life. Moreover, England was currently a principal centre of the modern movement in art and design. Gabo encountered other &eacute;migr&eacute;s from Germany and also became good friends with the critic Herbert Read, abstract artists such as Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth, and the architect Leslie Martin. In England he was able to exhibit and sell a significant number of sculptures, and with Nicholson and Martin he embarked upon the creation of <span class="italic">Circle</span>, a book-length celebration of the international &#145;constructive spirit&#146; which underpinned progressive architecture, painting, and sculpture, and foreshadowed the enlightened cultural values of society in the future. His opening essay, &#145;The constructive idea in art&#146;, indicated his prestigious position within the <span class="italic">Circle</span> grouping. He asserted the fundamental affinity between art and science, as explorations of the &#145;hidden forces of nature&#146;. In &#145;Sculpture: carving and construction in space&#146;, which introduced the sculpture section for which he was responsible, he emphasized his fundamental aim of heightening the viewer's sensation of space:<blockquote>Our task is to penetrate deeper into its substance and bring it closer to our consciousness; so that the sensation of space will become for us a more elementary and everyday emotion the same as the sensation of light or the sensation of sound. (Martin, Nicholson, and Gabo, 107)</blockquote>Gabo's English constructions, such as <span class="italic">Spheric Theme</span> (1937&#150;8, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York) and <span class="italic">Construction in Space: Crystalline Centre</span> (1938, Tate collection), revealed a new transparency and curvilinearity. Both effects depended upon his discovery and aesthetic exploitation of the recently marketed type of plastic known in Britain as perspex, which was less brittle and so more easily malleable than its predecessors.<br>
<br>In 1938 Gabo spent six months in the United States. Thereafter he was constantly thinking about moving across the Atlantic, to escape a war which was first imminent and then actual, but he ultimately stayed in England until November 1946. He spent the years of the Second World War in the relatively peaceful surroundings of Carbis Bay, Cornwall, in close proximity to Nicholson, Hepworth, the critic Adrian Stokes, and the studio potter Bernard Leach. Younger artists such as Peter Lanyon and John Wells were drawn to this grouping, which formed the basis of the post-war St Ives school. Gabo was frequently tormented by events in the wider world, especially during the German invasion of western Russia where he had grown up. He wrote several articles, kept a diary, produced an interesting group of paintings (for example, <span class="italic">Construction in Depths</span>, 1944, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York), and in 1944&#150;5 devoted considerable energy to designing a new car for the Jowett company, a project which eventually collapsed. His major sculptural innovation, announced by <span class="italic">Linear Construction in Space No. 1</span> (1942&#150;3, Kettle's Yard, Cambridge), was the introduction of closely spaced threads of nylon filament (another brand-new form of plastic) which he wound around a framework to create the illusion of curving planes permeated by space. The technique of stringing, recurrent in his subsequent work (such as <span class="italic">Linear Construction in Space No. 4</span>, 1958&#150;9, Art Institute of Chicago), was probably inspired by the mathematical models which he had encountered as a student in Munich, and in the Science Museum in London.<br>
<br>Gabo's career in the United States was never quite as successful as he had hoped, partly because the pristine forms and optimistic message of constructivism lost some of their resonance in the gloomy aftermath of the war. He and Miriam settled in Woodbury, Connecticut, and moved to nearby Middlebury in 1953. He exhibited and sold works, lectured widely, and executed a commission for a large-scale stairwell sculpture in the Baltimore Museum of Art (1950&#150;51). His greatest public project stemmed, however, from his first return visit to Europe in 1954, when he was commissioned to produce an outdoor sculpture for Marcel Breuer's austere Bijenkorf department store in Rotterdam. The 85 foot construction was unveiled in 1957. The soaring verticality of the form provided an effective and accessible visual metaphor for the rebirth of Rotterdam, destroyed by Nazi bombing, while the materials and structure evoked the cranes which were so vital to the economic life of the city, and which littered the docks just a few minutes' walk away. The spatial openness of Gabo's design produced a structure which was relatively lightweight in relation to its spatial volume, while the twist of the planes through 90 degrees served to prevent any dangerous build-up of wind pressure.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>Gabo's fame was at its height in the years that followed. A major monograph appeared in 1957, illustrating his work to date and reprinting some of his major theoretical texts. In 1959 he delivered the prestigious A. W. Mellon lectures at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, which were subsequently published as <span class="italic">Of Divers Arts</span> (1962). A string of prizes and official honours culminated in Gabo becoming KBE in 1971. Major retrospectives of his work were mounted in both Europe and the United States. Whereas he had been a relatively marginal figure during his initial ten years in the United States, which coincided with the heyday of abstract expressionism, his critical reputation from the 1960s onward benefited from the emergence of kinetic art and a more geometric idiom of abstract art, as well as from the increasing interest in the Russian avant-garde, of which he was one of the few surviving witnesses.<br>
<br>Gabo's late constructions were frequently large, and employed as material various kinds of metal, in the form of both sheets and linear springs (for example, <span class="italic">Vertical Construction No. 2</span>, 1965&#150;6, Julia A. Whitney Foundation, Connecticut). The boom in the market for contemporary art produced a degree of financial security which enabled Gabo to use these more lasting materials and to employ studio assistants from the early 1960s onward. Assistance was essential for executing the commissions for public sculptures he regularly began to receive. The most impressive of these was the fountain, unveiled in 1976, installed in the grounds of St Thomas's Hospital, London, directly across the Thames from the houses of parliament. The form was adapted from <span class="italic">Torsion</span> (<i>c</i>.1929, Berlinische Galerie, Berlin), but the incorporation of a rotating movement and of linear jets of water, evoking diaphanous planes curving through space, served to dematerialize the steel structure.<br>
<br>When presenting a group of small works to the Tate Gallery in 1977, Gabo explained his continuing affection for the country he had left thirty years earlier:<blockquote>I have lived in England through the most tragic years of her history and the most glorious period in the life of her people and I have learned to know and to love that country.<br>
<br>I have found a spirit of humanity in England which I carry with me in spite of my having to take citizenship in another country due to circumstances&#151;but I never, in my heart, lost my attachment to England.<br>
<br>I have acquired more personal friends in England than anywhere and any time in the wandering years of my life. (Gabo to Lord Bullock, 14 April 1977, New Haven, Connecticut, Yale University, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Gabo MSS)</blockquote>Gabo's health slowly declined, and in his final years he was mainly confined to working on wood engravings, a medium he had first taken up in 1950. On 23 August 1977 he died in Waterbury Hospital, Waterbury, Connecticut. Following cremation, his ashes were scattered in front of his studio in Middlebury. He was survived by his wife and daughter.<br>
