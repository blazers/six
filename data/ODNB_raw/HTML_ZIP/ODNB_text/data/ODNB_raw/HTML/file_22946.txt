<span class="headword">Quarles,  John</span>  (1624/5&#150;1665), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22945/', "Francis Quarles (1592&#150;1644)")</script>, author of the celebrated <span class="italic">Emblemes</span> (1635), and his wife, Ursula Woodgate (<i>b</i>. 1601). Of the eighteen children born to them, John was the eldest son to survive infancy. Francis Quarles belonged to an Essex family that was prosperous and well connected. At the time of John Quarles's birth his parents were apparently still living in Foster Lane, London, where they had resided since their marriage in 1618. About 1626 Francis Quarles became secretary to James Ussher, archbishop of Armagh, primate of Ireland. Archbishop Ussher preferred to reside at Drogheda, rather than in his palace at Armagh, and it is clear that the Quarles family lived with him. In an elegy on Ussher which John Quarles wrote in 1656 he recalls that he received his education from Ussher alone and that:<blockquote>
<div>the example of his life did every day<br>
</div>
<div>Afford me Lectures.<br>
</div> (J. Quarles, <span class="italic">An Elegie on &hellip; James Usher</span>, 1656, 21)</blockquote>By 1633 the Quarles family had returned to England and were living at Roxwell in Essex, although, within six years, Francis Quarles, no longer prosperous, had moved to a different part of the county and was residing at Ridley Hall, Terling. On 9 February 1643 John Quarles matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford, where, according to Anthony Wood, he was a batteler. By 1643 the king had made Oxford his headquarters, and Quarles is believed to have been a captain in one of his armies and to have served in the Oxford garrison. Presumably military duties curtailed Quarles's university career, and there is no record of his taking a degree.<br>
<br>Quarles was launched on his career as poet at a comparatively early age. He produced twelve or more works&#151;broadsides, pamphlets, and books&#151;which appeared in at least twenty-seven editions and reissues over a period of nearly thirty years. His first substantial publication was <span class="italic">Fons lachrymarum</span> (1648). When it appeared, Quarles was living in Flanders whither he had been banished, and his &#145;Farewell to England&#146; of the following year perhaps suggests that he anticipated a lengthy stay. Neither his movements over the next few years nor the date of his eventual return to London have been established. His next considerable work, <span class="italic">Regale lectum miseriae</span> (1649), which included his &#145;Farewell&#146;, was principally a lament for Charles I. It was his most successful publication, and had reappeared a further six times by 1679. Perhaps only his <span class="italic">God's Love and Mans Unworthiness</span> (1651), <span class="italic">Divine Meditations</span> (published with <span class="italic">God's Love</span> in 1655), and <span class="italic">The Historie of the most Vile Dimagoras</span> (1658), a continuation of his father's immensely popular heroic romance, <span class="italic">Argalus and Parthenia</span>, have comparable merit.<br>
<br>In common with a number of writers of the time, Francis Quarles freely acknowledged his indebtedness to Edward Benlowes (1602&#150;1676); John Quarles was to follow in his father's footsteps by dedicating to Benlowes, as his &#145;much-honoured and Esteemed Friend&#146;, <span class="italic">Gods Love and Mans Unworthiness</span>. Inevitably John Quarles's work was compared with that of his father. In the lines appended to William Marshall's portrait frontispiece to <span class="italic">Fons lachrymarum</span> it is declared that but for the portrait the work would clearly have been taken for that of &#145;<i>old smooth</i> Quarles <i>himself</i>&#146;. While Richard Love, who, as vice-chancellor of Cambridge University, had written an imprimatur in verse for <span class="italic">Emblemes</span> (1635), remarked in the commendatory verse he contributed to <span class="italic">Fons lachrymarum</span> that:<blockquote>
<div>
<i>The</i> Son <i>begins to rise, the</i> Father<i>'s set</i>:<br>
</div>
<div>
<i>Heav'n took away one</i> light, <i>and pleas'd to le</i>t<br>
</div>
<div>
<i>Another rise</i>.<br>
</div> (J. Quarles, <span class="italic">Fons lachrymarum</span>, sig. A8<i>r</i>)</blockquote>Love's sentiments were to be echoed even by those personally unacquainted with John Quarles. Samuel Sheppard, for instance &#145;consecrated&#146; an epigram to him, hailing him as heir to his father's genius  (S. Sheppard, <span class="italic">Epigrams</span>, 1651, 161).<br>
<br>Quarles died in London of the plague in 1665. Winstanley believed that he might have been saved had he gone to live with his kinsman William Holgate at Saffron Walden, Essex. Quarles's place of burial has not been traced. He has been confused with John Quarles (1631&#150;1674), fellow of Peterhouse, Cambridge, and John Quarles (1596&#150;1647), merchant of Delft and Rotterdam.<br>
