<span class="headword">FitzRoy <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Palmer]</span>,  Henry</span>, first duke of Grafton  (1663&#150;1690), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, the second illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5144/', "Charles II (1630&#150;1685)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28285/', "Barbara Palmer, n&#233;e Villiers, countess of Castlemaine and later duchess of Cleveland (bap. 1640, d. 1709)")</script>, was born at his mother's house in King Street, next to Whitehall Palace. The date is usually said to have been 20 September 1663 but it may have been some weeks earlier. By early 1664 he had moved with his mother into apartments in Whitehall. There were at first doubts as to his paternity and the king did not acknowledge him along with his brothers in 1670. By 1672, however, Charles II could evidently see a family resemblance. On 1 August 1672 Henry was pre-contracted in marriage to the five-year-old Lady Isabella (1667&#150;1723), daughter and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2104/', "Henry Bennet, earl of Arlington")</script>. Sixteen days later he was, in a patent which named him Henry FitzRoy, made earl of Euston, the name of Arlington's house in Suffolk, and on 11 September 1675 he was made duke of Grafton.<br>
<br>In 1676&#150;7 Grafton and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9633/', "George FitzRoy, earl of Northumberland")</script>, went to Paris with their mother to receive part of their education, a sojourn that cost some &pound;2500. On his return his mother attempted to break the Arlington marriage in order to obtain for him the far more lucrative hand of Lady Percy, heir of the previous earl of Northumberland, but Charles insisted on the fulfilment of the original contract. On 6 November 1679, therefore, Evelyn witnessed the marriage of the duke and Isabella: &#145;the sweetest, hopefulest, most beautiful child, &amp; most virtuous too, was sacrific'd to a boy that had been rudely bred&#146;, although he hoped that Grafton would &#145;emerge a plaine, usefull, robust officer, &amp; were he polish'd, a tolerable person, for he is exceedingly handsome, by far surpassing any of the King's other naturall issue&#146;  (Evelyn, 4.184&#150;5). According to Luttrell, they first &#145;bedded&#146; in April 1681  (Luttrell, 1.77).<br>
<br>Evelyn's reference to Grafton as an &#145;officer&#146; indicates the king's intention for his son to enter the navy. In 1678&#150;9 he had served in the Mediterranean aboard the <i>Happy Return</i> under Sir William Poole. In January 1680 he was entrusted to Sir John Berry, another veteran officer, and returned to the Mediterranean in the <i>Leopard</i>. He visited Tangier, Izmir, Alicante, and Malaga before leaving the ship in the Downs on 23 December. During his absence he had been created a knight of the Garter (30 September). He was made colonel of the 1st foot guards in 1681, and served as master of Trinity House in 1682&#150;3. On 13 January 1683 he became vice-admiral of England in succession to Prince Rupert; on 24 April he was appointed admiral and commander-in-chief in the narrow seas, taking command in July of the new third-rate named <i>Grafton</i> in his honour. However, to the fury of both Grafton and his mother, he was suddenly recalled at the end of July and replaced by Lord Dartmouth, who then took the fleet to Tangier to evacuate the colony. In April 1684 Grafton went to France, met Louis XIV, and served at the siege of Luxembourg, leaving Paris on 26 July to return home. In December 1684 the actor Cardell Goodman, who was engaged in an affair with the duchess of Cleveland, was found guilty of a conspiracy to poison both Grafton and his brother Northumberland, and was fined &pound;1000. Goodman may have been the victim of a plot by Grafton and his brother to end his affair with their mother.<br>
<br>Despite the death of his father, Grafton seemed to continue in high favour when James II acceded, and displayed conspicuous loyalty to the new monarch. He acted as lord high chamberlain at the coronation on 23 April 1685, and played a prominent part in the Sedgemoor campaign: on 27 June he led 500 musketeers on a dangerous reconnaissance to Norton St Philip, where they came under heavy fire and escaped only by charging with fixed bayonets. He then fought at the battle of Sedgemoor itself. Grafton first took his seat in the House of Lords on 19 November 1685. At Chelsea on 2 February 1686 he fought a fatal duel against John Talbot, brother of the earl of Shrewsbury, who had offered him &#145;an almost insufferable provocation&#146; the night before  (Evelyn, 4.501): Talbot's sword struck Grafton's buckle and wounded his hand, but the duke's blow killed him outright. Grafton was pardoned almost immediately, but a few days later was involved in another controversial incident when he helped Northumberland to install the latter's wife in a Ghent convent. Northumberland's secret marriage had been suddenly revealed and caused great annoyance to the king. Grafton appears to have seen the &#145;abduction&#146; as a way to separate his brother permanently from an unsuitable wife, but after complaints from her family the king ordered her return. On 3 July 1687 the duke escorted the papal envoy, d'Adda, to Whitehall. Two days later he left London to take command of the fleet intended to transport Maria Sophia of Newburg, the new queen of Portugal, to her kingdom. Flying his flag in the <i>Anne</i>, he embarked the queen at Den Brielle on 12 July and arrived at Lisbon on 1 August. The fleet sailed on 13 August, and after a visit to Gibraltar, arrived off Algiers on 17 September. Grafton successively renewed England's treaties with Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli before anchoring at Malta on 19 November, where he was made a knight of St John. The fleet returned to the Downs on 19 March 1688, and Grafton left for London a week later.<br>
<br>Grafton was the obvious candidate&#151;in his own mind, at least&#151;to command the fleet set out later in 1688 to guard against William of Orange's invasion force. In September, though, James not only appointed Dartmouth over his head once again, but also abolished the office of vice-admiral of England altogether, a move that one observer in the fleet correctly regarded as &#145;a wile to be rid of the duke&#146;  (Davies, &#145;James II&#146;, 88). Grafton was strenuously opposed to the promotion of Catholics in both army and navy, and to the king's Francophile foreign policy, and had told James this to his face. The duke had been a close friend of John Churchill since the Sedgemoor campaign at least, and had many other contacts in the burgeoning army conspiracy. He almost immediately paid a surreptitious visit to William in the Netherlands; this was discovered by James's agents and reported to the king, who took no action. Grafton then went to the fleet at least once, ostensibly as a volunteer, and at some point, probably in late October, was intended by a shadowy conspiracy in the fleet to be installed as admiral in succession to Dartmouth, who was to be kidnapped while dining aboard the ship commanded by Anthony Hastings (who also held a commission in Grafton's regiment). Even so, the duke joined James's army, swearing that he would fight and die for the king; but when suspicions of his part in the conspiracy grew, he defected with Churchill at Axminster on 24 November. On 14 December, the day after he returned to London, Grafton was shot at by a soldier near Somerset House; the man's pistol misfired, but he was immediately shot dead by the duke's men.<br>
<br>Grafton voted for a regency in 1689 but carried the orb at the coronation of William and Mary. He was soon out of favour, however, and lost all his offices, including the governorship of Portsmouth, in March 1689, and was not employed again at sea as a flag officer. Nevertheless, he accepted a commission as a private captain in the navy in 1690, and commanded his eponymous warship at the battle of Beachy Head; his conduct there, where he was prominent in helping damaged Dutch warships to get clear, earned him a warm letter of praise from William. After returning from the battle, Grafton spent a fortnight at Euston with his duchess before joining Churchill's force intended for the campaign in Ireland. He arrived at Cork on 20 August, and three days later led the assault on Passage West. Advancing under heavy fire, Grafton was hit by a musket ball which broke two ribs. He lingered until his death in Cork on 9 October. Following a funeral service at Westminster Abbey, he was interred in the new church of St Genevieve at Euston. His young widow was the chief beneficiary of his will, made on 8 July 1687 with a codicil dated 27 October 1688, and by which the earl of Lichfield and Lord Godolphin were appointed executors and guardians of his son and successor, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/93055/', "Charles FitzRoy, second duke of Grafton (1683&#150;1757)")</script>. The duchess later married Sir Thomas Hanmer, and died on 7 February 1723.<br>
<br>Grafton's death was widely and genuinely mourned, prompting a number of eulogies of variable quality. Handsome, heroic, plainly spoken, and one of the most popular of Charles II's children, Grafton always retained (or affected) the lack of education that Evelyn had commented upon at his marriage. His personality and idiosyncratic grasp of written English are both well summed up in a letter he wrote to the earl of Nottingham after the battle of Beachy Head, when he condemned &#145;all the damned contrivanses that has bein made euse of above to sett us in faction here&#146;  (<span class="italic">Finch MSS</span>, 2.386). Nottingham had been a close friend of the duke's since the early 1680s, and wrote of him, &#145;[he was] a very gallant man, and extremely beloved by the seamen, with whom he was very familiar and often joined them in their rough sports, and had he lived, would have deserved to have been Lord Admiral&#146;  (Finch, political papers, 148, fol. 7).<br>
