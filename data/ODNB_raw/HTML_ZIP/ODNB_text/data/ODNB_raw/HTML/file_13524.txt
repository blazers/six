<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Holland,  Henry</span>  (1745&#150;1806), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in Church Row, Fulham, on 20 July 1745, the eldest son of Henry Holland (1712&#150;1785) and his wife, Mary (1716&#150;1783), third child and only daughter of William Byrom of Fulham. Master of the Tylers' and Bricklayers' Company in 1772&#150;3, Henry Holland senior was a prosperous Georgian builder who executed much of the architectural work of the celebrated landscape gardener Lancelot (Capability) Brown. After a modest architectural training, probably in his father's yard in Fulham, Holland entered into an informal but profitable partnership in 1771 with Brown, who lived not far away at Hampton Court. Gradually assuming responsibility for the architectural side of Brown's practice, Holland made the acquaintance of Brown's extensive and influential clientele. These contacts were particularly valuable for a young architect who had received the benefit of neither professional pupillage nor foreign travel.<h2>
<a name="PartnershipwithLancelotBrownandmarriage"></a>Partnership with Lancelot Brown and marriage</h2>The first product of the partnership between Holland and Brown was the prestigious Claremont House, Esher, Surrey, built in 1771&#150;4 for Robert Clive, first Baron Clive of Plassey, following his final return from India in 1767. Claremont is a very large Palladian house with a giant Corinthian portico, but somewhat spartan interiors with minimal classical trim. Representing a deliberate rejection of the elaborate ornament associated with the Adam brothers, this style was to reappear in Holland's later work. On 11 February 1773, while work was going forward on Claremont, Holland cemented the partnership with Brown by marrying his elder daughter, Bridget (1744&#150;1828). They took up residence at 17 Hertford Street, Mayfair, recently built by Holland and his father. When Brown made his will in 1779, he named his son-in-law as one of his executors, and it was in the Hertford Street house that he died four years later.<br>
<br>Claremont was followed by a second collaboration between Brown and Holland, Benham Place, Berkshire (1774&#150;5), for the sixth Baron Craven. Benham has a more interesting plan than Claremont, boasting a circular vestibule or tribune, two-storeyed and galleried, rising to a shallow dome containing a circular glazed lantern. Presumably contributed by Holland, this remarkable space made an impression on John Soane, who had indeed worked with Holland on the entrance hall at Claremont in 1772. Holland and Brown continued their collaboration at Cadland (1775&#150;8), a modest &#145;marine villa&#146; in the Palladian style overlooking the sea near Southampton. Holland's surviving sketches for interior decoration at Cadland are important because he noted the illustrated books on classical archaeology on which he drew for inspiration: Bernard de Montfaucon's <span class="italic">Antiquit&eacute; expliqu&eacute;e</span> (1719&#150;24), and <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Athens</span> by James Stuart and Nicholas Revett (vol. 1, 1762), a book to which Capability Brown was a subscriber.<h2>
<a name="EstablishinghimselfindependentlyBrookssClubHansTownandPlaceandSloanePlace"></a>Establishing himself independently: Brooks's Club, Hans Town and Place, and Sloane Place</h2>The first important work which Holland undertook independently was Brooks's Club, St James's Street, London (1776&#150;8), a club fashionable with the whig aristocrats who were to become his principal patrons; through them Holland met the prince of Wales who, in 1783, joined the club and appointed him as his architect. Behind a Palladian fa&ccedil;ade of pale yellow brick with stone dressings, like one of his country houses, Holland provided a suite of three first-floor rooms, the great subscription room, the small drawing-room, and the coffee (that is, dining) room, now the card room. With its segmental vaulted ceiling decorated with bands of guilloche ornament and chaste swags of husks, the great subscription room is one of the finest eighteenth-century rooms in London.<br>
<br>Holland was the obvious choice of architect for Brooks's, for not only did he own the site on which it was to be built, but his father had built the house in Pall Mall which the club had originally occupied. Like many eighteenth-century architects, Holland had taken to speculative building, purchasing in 1771 with money lent by his father a lease of 89 acres in Chelsea from Lord Cadogan. Here, from 1777 to <i>c</i>.1797, he built what was known as Hans Town, consisting of Sloane Street, Cadogan Place, and Hans Place. This urban development of simple terraced houses of stock brick, now largely demolished, immediately proved popular with the upper middle and professional classes for whom it was planned. As a piece of planned residential speculation, it found many imitators in London, though few as fashionable.<br>
<br>The octagonal Hans Place was left open at its south end to allow for an impressive view of a handsome detached villa with a large garden, the site of which is now partly occupied by Cadogan Square. Known as Sloane Place, this delectable residence was built by Holland for his own occupation between <i>c</i>.1782 and <i>c</i>.1789 as a public demonstration of his taste and professional success, in which role it is said to have attracted the favourable attention of the prince of Wales. Faced with the yellowish-white, thin imitation bricks known as mathematical tiles, it was U-shaped in plan with a colonnade of coupled Ionic columns along the south front. Behind this was a 113 foot enfilade of five intercommunicating rooms: drawing-room, dining-room, lobby, library, and music room, in which Holland displayed his collection of antique marbles and casts.<br>
<br>The miniature landscaped park at Sloane Place included a 16 acre meadow, formal flowers beds laid out in the French fashion, and an island containing a Gothic ice house. It was one of the very few detached mansions built in London in the second half of the eighteenth century with its own entrance courtyard and garden, an essentially Parisian form. It is known that Holland visited Paris in autumn 1785, but even before this he could have derived knowledge of contemporary French architecture and decoration from publications by Jacques Gondoin, Marie-Joseph Peyre, Pierre Patte, and Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois de Neufforge. It was partly Holland's Gallic tastes which made him sympathetic to his many whig clients, among whom it was fashionable to show some sympathy with the ideals of revolutionary France. The whig prince of Wales&#151;to the annoyance of his father, George III&#151;was a close friend of the duc de Chartres, who succeeded as duc d'Orl&eacute;ans in 1785; during the French Revolution, Orl&eacute;ans became known as Philippe Egalit&eacute;. He was a frequent visitor to London, where he was a member of Brooks's.<h2>
<a name="RoyalcommissionsCarltonHouseBrightonandYorkHouse"></a>Royal commissions: Carlton House, Brighton, and York House</h2>In 1783 the prince of Wales employed Holland to rebuild his London residence, Carlton House, in Pall Mall. Holland brilliantly remodelled the rambling buildings which then occupied the site, creating a coherent fa&ccedil;ade of emphatically channelled rustication in the French manner with a central <i>porte-coch&egrave;re</i>, the first in England. He screened the entrance court from Pall Mall by a low open colonnade of Ionic columns, a feature directly inspired by the colonnade which Peyre had proposed in 1763 for the H&ocirc;tel de Cond&eacute;, and which Pierre Rousseau had built in 1782&#150;5 at the H&ocirc;tel de Salm (now the L&eacute;gion d'Honneur). These were a product of the opposition of French neo-classical theorists to the high, solid walls which had traditionally concealed aristocratic town mansions from the public gaze in both Paris and London.<br>
<br>By the end of 1783 Holland had engaged as draughtsmen and interior decorators two French &eacute;migr&eacute;s, Guillaume Gaubert, who stayed until 1787, and J.-P. Tr&eacute;court. They were soon joined by others, including Louis Delabri&egrave;re and, about 1786, Dominique Daguerre, who remained until 1795. The interiors which, with their help, Holland created at Carlton House from 1783 to 1796 were among the most sophisticated in planning, design, furnishings, and craftsmanship ever created in England. The complicated plan of smallish interlocking rooms was French in origin, as at the Palais Bourbon in Paris, though the central octagonal tribune on which the whole complex plan pivoted may have been indebted to that proposed by Robert Adam in 1766 for Lord Bute at Luton Hoo. Holland's oval, top-lit staircase, one of the most dramatic in eighteenth-century England, was a baroque <i>tour de force</i> equalled only by William Kent's at 44 Berkeley Square (1742&#150;4).<br>
<br>Carlton House was tragically demolished in 1826&#150;7 by its creator (by then George IV), who by that date had turned his attention to the remodelling of Buckingham House and Windsor Castle. Something of its quality can be appreciated at Berrington Hall, Herefordshire (1778&#150;81), built by Holland for the Hon. Thomas Harley, who was a tory, unlike most of his clients. The ambitious staircase incorporates coffered arches, free-standing columns on the first-floor gallery, and a tall glazed dome. The entrance front of Berrington shows Holland in a starker mood: a giant Ionic portico of startling abruptness carries a pediment pierced unconventionally by a Diocletian window.<br>
<br>In 1786 the prince of Wales acquired a farmhouse at Brighton, and employed Holland to expand it into a &#145;marine pavilion&#146;. Holland gave it a Gallic flavour with a curved, domed bow, surrounded by engaged columns, as in the H&ocirc;tel de Salm in Paris. Faced with mathematical tiles, Holland's work was carried out in 1786&#150;7, but was subsequently submerged by Nash's remodelling of the building as Brighton Pavilion in 1815&#150;22.<br>
<br>In 1787&#150;8 Holland rebuilt York (previously Featherstonhaugh, later Melbourne, and now Dover) House, Whitehall, for Frederick, duke of York, younger brother of the prince of Wales. Holland filled in the courtyard of the existing house, built in the 1750s, with a circular, galleried vestibule, 40 feet in diameter, a disposition inspired by French plans such as that for a town house published in Neufforge's <span class="italic">Recueil &eacute;l&eacute;mentaire d'architecture</span> (vol. 3, 1767). The vestibule is lit by a lantern above a shallow dome, and surrounded by eight pink scagliola columns. Holland added an entrance portico in Whitehall, featuring columns of the Greek Ionic order of the temple on the River Ilissus in Athens, as illustrated in <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Athens</span> (1762). This is set into a rusticated screen wall inspired by the library of Hadrian in Athens, again from a plate in the same volume of the <span class="italic">Antiquities</span>, where it is described as a &#145;Stoa or portico&#146;.<h2>
<a name="CommissionsfromthewhigliteAlthorpWoburnAbbeyandSouthill"></a>Commissions from the whig &eacute;lite: Althorp, Woburn Abbey, and Southill</h2>In December 1786 Holland was commissioned to remodel Althorp, Northamptonshire, by the second Earl Spencer, one of the whig grandees who was a prominent member of Brooks's. Holland's handsome library is divided by two screens of his favourite Greek Ionic columns. The most exquisite room, however, is Lady Spencer's dressing-room with neo-classical painted pilasters and panels executed in 1790&#150;91 by T. H. Pernotin. For Lord Spencer, Holland also remodelled Wimbledon Park House in 1799, adding a striking Tuscan portico with broadly projecting eaves, inspired by Inigo Jones's at St Paul's, Covent Garden.<br>
<br>While work at Althorp proceeded, Holland received a commission in 1787 from another whig nobleman, Francis Russell, the 21-year-old fifth duke of Bedford, to modernize Woburn Abbey, Bedfordshire. As at Althorp, Holland provided a fine tripartite library, divided with screens of columns. He also remodelled the east front, turning it into the main entrance front, which he marked by a deep <i>porte-coch&egrave;re</i> in a version of Tuscan which borders closely on Greek Doric. At the same time he added the Chinese dairy, overlooking the pool to the north-east of the abbey. The pretty lantern with its finials is based on plates in Chambers's <span class="italic">Designs of Chinese Buildings</span> (1757), from which source Holland also drew inspiration for the interior decoration.<br>
<br>In 1789 Holland built a handsome greenhouse at Woburn with a Venetian window flanked by Louis XVI medallions and wreaths, carved in 1790 by Le Maison, who described himself on his bill as &#145;of Paris and London&#146;. The duke subsequently decided to turn this building into a sculpture gallery, and commissioned Holland to set up the temple of liberty at one end in 1801. This was built to house busts of the duke's favourite political heroes, notably Nollekens's bust of Charles James Fox, who also presides over Brooks's Club and the prince of Wales's octagonal tribune at Carlton House. Holland's temple of liberty is an exceptionally refined creation with details based on two Athenian monuments, as recorded by Stuart and Revett: the Greek Ionic order from the Ilissus temple, and the frieze adorned with wreaths from the choragic monument of Thrasyllus in Athens. In 1788&#150;92 the second Viscount Palmerston commissioned Holland to provide a handsome new Ionic portico in antis on the east front of Broadlands, Hampshire, as well as interior decoration; Brown had already worked on the house and park for the same client in 1766&#150;8.<br>
<br>Holland's last major domestic commission came in 1796 from Samuel Whitbread, the wealthy brewer, for the remodelling of Southill House, Bedfordshire, where the grounds had been landscaped for a previous owner by Capability Brown. Holland's exteriors at Southill were understated, almost to the point of gracelessness, but he provided a series of varied but always exquisite astylar interiors, which are the climax of his personal style. Mrs Whitbread's room and boudoir, finished in April 1800, were the most French, with decorative painting in a Pompeian manner by A. L. Delabri&egrave;re. The drawing-room has an almost sensuous beauty with its crimson silk wall panels, while the library has antique panels of griffins and candelabra.<h2>
<a name="Furtherworks"></a>Further works</h2>Both the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and the Covent Garden Theatre stood on land owned by the duke of Bedford, so that Holland was the obvious choice of architect in the 1790s to rebuild the former, and to make alterations to the latter. Turning for inspiration to recent publications on French theatre design by Pierre Patte and &Eacute;tienne Dumont, Holland provided the Theatre Royal with chastely classical interior decoration and rich furnishing. Both theatres were burnt to the ground in 1808&#150;9.<br>
<br>An unusual commission came in 1803 to remodel Melbourne House, Piccadilly, as residential chambers, and to add two ranges of apartments in the garden on the north. Built by Sir William Chambers for Lord Melbourne in 1771&#150;4, the house had been the residence of the duke of York from 1792, and the decision to turn an aristocratic, and now royal, mansion into residential apartments, named the Albany, was highly unconventional. This commission involved the destruction of Chambers's magnificent staircase, but the two long ranges which Holland added were elegant and convenient, and serve the same purpose today as that for which they were erected. They flank an attractive covered way, known as the Ropewalk, which has a tent-shaped roof of narrow boarding with a faintly Chinese flavour.<h2>
<a name="Hollandasacollector"></a>Holland as a collector</h2>Holland's collection of antiquities, its arrangement and display, was an important part of his presentation of himself to the world as a man of taste; in this he followed the example of Adam as well as setting a precedent for Soane. In 1776 Holland made his first important purchase of casts from the antique, which were acquired for him in Italy by Christopher Ebdon, a former pupil of James Paine. In 1794 Holland sent his talented draughtsman Charles Heathcote Tatham to Rome to pursue his own studies and to collect for Holland decorative pieces such as fragments from antique altars, carved pilasters, and candelabra, as well as cinerary urns. For these services Holland made him an allowance of &pound;60 a year, plus expenses. Holland thus made a vital contribution to the development of neo-classical taste in England: first, because Tatham's subsequent publications, beginning with <span class="italic">Etchings of Ancient Ornamental Architecture</span> (1799&#150;1800), were to be influential on architects and furniture designers, and, second, because in 1816 Soane purchased the marbles which Tatham had acquired for Holland. He mounted them on the walls of the study at 13 Lincoln's Inn Fields, where they can be seen today.<br>
<br>Holland's brother John, who also spent much time in Italy, acquired further antique fragments for him. A sufficient quantity of objects were installed in Sloane Place by early 1796 for Holland to show them to experts, such as Charles Townley, who supported his election as a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in December 1796. Holland offered them to the trustees of the British Museum who declined them, so they remained in his collection, passing on his death to his nephew.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsanddeath"></a>Last years and death</h2>In 1799 Holland became surveyor to the East India Company, in which capacity he built the long neo-Palladian fa&ccedil;ade of East India House, Leadenhall Street (1799&#150;1800), with interiors designed by his predecessor as surveyor Richard Jupp. His other official appointments included clerk of the works at the Royal Mews at Charing Cross (1775&#150;82) and surveyor to the Bridewell and Bethlem hospitals (1782&#150;93); he was appointed a JP for Middlesex in 1778. He acquired from Lord Spencer, seemingly in payment of debts, an estate at Okehampton, Devon, which was a political borough and a whig stronghold where the duke of Bedford played an important role. A committed whig, Holland secured the Okehampton seat in the House of Commons for his son Henry in 1802. He died in his London house, Sloane Place, on 17 June 1806, and was buried below the simple family tomb which he had designed for his parents in the churchyard of All Saints', Fulham. He left two sons, Henry and Lancelot, and five daughters. His drawings and papers seem to have been destroyed after his death by his nephew and executor, Henry Rowles.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>It is hard to guess at Holland's personality for he was of a retiring disposition, and carefully avoided public notice. He chose not to exhibit his work at the Royal Academy, though he did take an active part in founding the Architects' Club in 1791 with George Dance, S. P. Cockerell, and James Wyatt. He took a practical interest in new materials and methods of construction for buildings of all types, such as mathematical tiles, fireproofing, Hartley's &#145;fire-plate&#146;, and <i>pis&eacute;</i> (rammed earth construction on brick or rubble foundations). He published papers in 1793 on the problems of fire prevention, and in 1797 on agricultural cottages and on <i>pis&eacute;</i>. His use of <i>pis&eacute;</i>, as in estate cottages supposedly built at Woburn in the early 1790s, was part of his admiration for France, for he was indebted to a publication on the subject by A. M. Cointereaux of Paris in 1791. The caustic Soane, who began his architectural career as an assistant in Holland's office, dismissed him, privately, as &#145;a bricklayer architect&#146;  (D. Watkin, <span class="italic">Sir John Soane: Enlightenment Thought and the Royal Academy Lectures</span>, 1996, 230).<br>
<br>Holland's principal stylistic debt was probably to Sir William Chambers, whose restrained Gallic tastes he echoed, though with the introduction of neo-Greek detail of which Chambers would have disapproved. It must also have been galling for Chambers to see Holland replace or succeed him at Melbourne House, Carlton House, and Woburn Abbey, while he was still in professional practice himself. But, as a whig, Holland was more acceptable to some patrons than the tory Chambers. Holland's opposite numbers as royal architects in France, Claude-Nicolas Ledoux and Richard Mique, were, respectively, imprisoned during the terror and guillotined, fates Holland would have been unlikely to have escaped had he too been French.<br>
