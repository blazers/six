<span class="headword">Brayne,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1654), <span class="occ">clergyman and Seeker</span>, was settled by parliament as minister of St John's, in the Soke, Winchester, from the late 1640s until his death. His fame rests on the flurry of tracts he published in his last years, and little is known of his background. He may have come from Somerset: one tract was dedicated to his kinsman Thomas Churchey of Wincanton, and he may be identical with the John Brayne of Crewkerne, a gentleman's son who entered New Inn Hall, Oxford, in 1636, aged twenty-two. He was certainly fluent in the classical languages and Hebrew, and was once described as &#145;Dr Brayne&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1654</i>, 289).<br>
<br>By the later 1640s Brayne had developed radical political and religious ideas. In September 1647 he had a vision of the impending downfall of monarchy in England, France, and Spain, heralding the reign of Christ on earth. He sent this prophecy to the MP John Lisle, and it circulated in the army. In 1649 he revealed that General Thomas Fairfax (&#145;and none else&#146;; Brayne, <span class="italic">The Gospel-Pattern</span>, sig. A2) was the avenging angel of <span class="roman">Revelation</span> 14: 16, and that God would use the army to restore the true church, paving the way for the calling of the Jews. In the same year he welcomed news from France of the overthrow of Cardinal Mazarin, &#145;the first of the foolish virgins&#146;  (Brayne, <span class="italic">Babels Fall</span>, 19), and predicted an English invasion of Scotland to root out presbyterianism. This prophecy too was sent to Lisle. Other works reveal connections with the members of the Rump Parliament John Pyne and William Sydenham, and with the millenarian polymath John Sadler, &#145;a dear and faithful friend&#146;  (Brayne, <span class="italic">An Exposition</span>, sig. A2).<br>
<br>Brayne's primary interest lay in the nature of the church. He regarded all existing churches as false, believing that the true church would emerge only at the end of the 1260 years in the wilderness (<span class="roman">Revelation</span> 12: 6), which would be in 1666. There were, however, some true ministers, typified by the two witnesses of <span class="roman">Revelation</span> 20, and it was in this sense that he described himself as &#145;an unworthy witness&#146; of the Lord  (Brayne, <span class="italic">The New Earth</span>, title page). Such ministers were to preach the gospel (as Brayne did four or five times a week), but should not administer the sacraments. He devoted much thought to the shape of the future church. In 1648 he wrote to the Westminster assembly, criticizing the presbyterian system it had devised, but the only result was the suspension of his augmentation at Winchester. His own studies led him towards a much modified congregationalism, with a threefold ministry of evangelists, pastors, and teachers. Church members would observe the seventh-day sabbath and practise adult baptism; all others would continue to keep the first-day sabbath, and would be barred from the sacraments. Brayne also held idiosyncratic views on the hereafter. His version of mortalism distinguished between the soul, remaining with the body until the last judgment, and the spirit, which God quickened only in the elect and which returned straight to heaven. Those with such an awakened spirit might be blessed in this life with divine dreams and revelations. His views on predestination and the Trinity were remarkably conventional.<br>
<br>Like the Fifth Monarchists, Brayne saw the judicial laws of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> as an essential part of Christ's reign. He supported parliament's measures against blasphemy and the <span class="roman">Adultery Act</span> of 1650, though he regarded them as inadequate and insufficiently close to scripture. He also advocated sweeping changes in education. He attacked Latin authors as profane, wanted schools to use only biblical and early Christian writings in teaching Greek, and urged greater study of Hebrew. Existing translations of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> were so faulty, he complained, that they should be called in. Astrology was condemned as the doctrine of demons. Brayne had considerable influence on other millenarian and spiritual writers. His polemical tracts drew replies from, among others, John Gadbury, the astrologer, and the Baptist Peter Chamberlen (1601&#150;1683). Brayne was buried in Winchester on 20 February 1654. He had died in poverty, and in August of that same year the council of state settled a pension of &pound;30 on his widow, Dorcas, and their eight small children.<br>
