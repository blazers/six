<span class="headword">Dowdeswell,  William</span>  (1760&#150;1828), <span class="occ">army officer and art collector</span>, was born on 27 February 1760, the third son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7959/', "Right Hon. William Dowdeswell (1721&#150;1775)")</script> of Pull Court, near Upton upon Severn, Worcestershire, and his wife, Bridget (<i>d</i>. 1818), youngest daughter of Sir William Codrington, first baronet, of Dodington, Gloucestershire, and aunt of Sir Edward Codrington, the admiral. Educated partly at Westminster School (1770), Dowdeswell entered the army as ensign in the 1st or Grenadier Guards on 6 May 1780 and acted as aide-de-camp to the third duke of Portland, lord lieutenant of Ireland, who had befriended him. In 1782 he was promoted lieutenant and on 4 May 1785 captain.<br>
<br>Dowdeswell was elected MP for Tewkesbury, about 4 miles from Pull Court, where the Dowdeswells had long possessed much property and parliamentary influence, on 19 March 1792. In 1793 at the close of the session he joined the brigade of guards, under Gerard Lake, at Tournai, and served throughout the 1793 campaign, being present at the affair of Lincelles, the siege of Valenciennes, and the battles before Dunkirk. He returned to England in the winter, and was promoted captain and lieutenant-colonel on 8 February 1794, but he did not again go to the Netherlands. Portland procured Dowdeswell's appointment as governor of the Bahamas, so he vacated his parliamentary seat in November 1797, and was succeeded as MP by his cousin, Christopher Bethell Codrington. Dowdeswell was governor of the Bahamas from 1797 to 1801. He was promoted colonel on 25 June 1797, and after acting for a short time as commander of a battalion of the 60th regiment, he went to India in 1802 as private secretary to Portland's son, Lord William Henry Cavendish-Bentinck, governor of Madras.<br>
<br>On 25 September 1803 Dowdeswell was promoted major-general, and in 1804 he was requested to take command of a division of Lord Lake's army, then engaged in a trying campaign with the Maratha chieftain, Jeswant R&aacute;o Holkar. He joined the army on 31 December 1804, and commanded a division during Lake's unsuccessful operations against Bharatpur, and in the field until the start of the hot weather. In October 1805, on the opening of the new campaign, Dowdeswell was detached with a division of 8000 men to protect the Doab; he remained there until Lord Cornwallis made peace with Holkar, and then took command of the Cawnpore division, a position which he held until February 1807, when he temporarily succeeded Lake as commander-in-chief in India. Soon afterwards he was compelled to leave India on account of his health. He received the thanks of the government and of the directors of the East India Company, and was promoted lieutenant-general on 25 July 1810.<br>
<br>In 1811 Dowdeswell retired from the army (with full rank, but no pay), on inheriting the family estates after the death of his elder brother, Thomas. He then devoted himself to collecting prints, especially by old English engravers, and his collection was sold by auction in 1820, 1821, and 1828; some items were later acquired by the British Museum. He was one of the first collectors to make a speciality of &#145;grangerizing&#146;, and the most important item in the 1820 sale was his copy of Gough's <span class="italic">British Topography</span>, enlarged by him from two to fourteen volumes by the insertion of more than 4000 views and portraits. In 1821 his unequalled collection of Hollars was sold, realizing &pound;505 16<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. He was promoted general in 1821.<br>
<br>Dowdeswell died at his residence, Pull Court, on 1 December 1828, and was interred in the family vault at Bushley, Worcestershire, on 8 December. As he never married his Worcestershire estates devolved on his brother, John Edward Dowdeswell (1772&#150;1851), MP and master in chancery, and his Lincolnshire estates on the Revd Dr Edward Christopher Dowdeswell (<i>c</i>.1765&#150;1849), canon of Christ Church, Oxford.<br>
