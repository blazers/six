<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ball, Sir  Alexander John</span>, baronet  (1756&#150;1809), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician in Malta</span>, was born on 22 July 1756 at Ebworth Park, Painswick, Gloucestershire, the son of Robert Ball (1714/15&#150;1766), high sheriff of that county, and Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dickinson. He attended Market House School in Stroud and entered the navy on completion of his education. From the late 1770s Ball served, initially as a lieutenant, on the North American and Newfoundland stations, and then in the West Indies in the flagships of Sir George Rodney. He was with Rodney in the <i>Formidable</i> at the battle of the Saints (1782), which secured British control of the West Indies. Ball received his commander's commission and thereafter served in other stations, including the Newfoundland for a second time. In 1783 in order to learn French he spent time on half pay in France which is where, at St Omer, he first came to the attention of Horatio Nelson.<br>
<br>Having returned to Gloucester in 1784, Ball remained on half pay until July 1790 when he was appointed to the frigate <i>Nemesis</i> (28 guns) in which he remained until moving to the <i>Cleopatra</i> (32 guns) in 1793 and serving on the Newfoundland station under Vice-Admiral Sir Richard King. In May 1798, two years after he had been appointed to the <i>Alexander</i> (74 guns) and after short stints off Brest and Cadiz, Ball was sent into the Mediterranean under Nelson's orders. Later that month, after sailing from Gibraltar, the <i>Alexander</i> came to the rescue of Nelson's flagship, <i>Vanguard</i>, which had been dismasted in a violent gale (21 May). It is clear from Nelson's dispatches that Ball's action may have saved the rear-admiral's life; certainly it earned Ball Nelson's lifelong friendship and also made possible the continuation of Nelson's command of the British fleet at a crucial time, two months before the battle of Abu Qir Bay on 1 August 1798 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96379', "Nelson's band of brothers")</script>].<br>
<br>Ball's association with Malta, for which he is now best known, began in October 1798 when he was ordered to the island to institute a naval blockade to support the islanders' recent insurrection against French rule. His involvement in Maltese affairs may be divided into three phases. The first dates from the start of the blockade which soon led to his coming ashore and his assumption of the presidency of the Maltese &#145;national congress&#146; until the French capitulation in September 1800. In this role he acted as a go-between for the sometimes feuding Maltese leaders and military commanders. He also pleaded for reinforcements and ensured that foodstuffs, especially grain, reached islanders simultaneously engaged in anti-French resistance and afflicted with epidemic. However, when after a bitter two-year struggle the French surrendered they did so not to Ball, who was left out of negotiations, but to a newly arrived British army and naval officer. Ball, who had hoped to become the island's governor and who described himself as the &#145;father&#146; of the Maltese, was rightly aggrieved at Britain's handling of the transfer and left the island in April 1801.<br>
<br>Ball's second period in Malta began in June 1802 when he returned to the island as the minister-plenipotentiary to the order of St John. Ball's return followed the signing of the peace of Amiens with the French in which Malta was to be returned to the order and would thereafter remain neutral, her independence being guaranteed through the agreement of Britain, France, Austria, Spain, Russia, and Prussia. Ball, along with the Maltese leadership, remained highly doubtful as to whether the provisions of the treaty could be enforced and sceptical of the merits of restoring the order of St John. Ball was secretly advised to play for time and to delay welcoming back the order's grand master, a tactic which ended with Britain's decision to retain the island and their signing of the third coalition against Napoleon.<br>
<br>Ball's final, and longest, period of involvement in Maltese affairs centred on his work as the island's civil commissioner and <i>de facto</i> governor from 1803 until his death. If his powers in this office were considerable then so too were the problems he faced. Discontent quickly arose over the lack of financial assistance for members of the disbanded Maltese &#145;congresso&#146;, and was exacerbated by the arrival of large numbers of Sicilians, Albanians, Genoese, and Jewish Gibraltarians&#151;prompting demonstrations in 1805. The situation was eased during the period of the continental blockade, with Malta prominent in the Mediterranean contraband trade. Ball's period of rule also witnessed the establishment of a civil service and banking and insurance systems, together with significant improvements to the island's infrastructure. One of his final initiatives was the appointment of the first Maltese bishop, Ferdinando Mattei, a move which confirmed British control while ensuring good relations with the Vatican and the Sicilian monarchy. Ball was not only a fine seaman and an efficient captain but (what was rarer in his profession) a man of wide culture, humanity, and judgement: qualities he fully displayed in his demanding position in Malta and for which he was praised by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, his one-time secretary on the island.<br>
<br>In 1800 Ball had been created a baronet following the British take-over of the island. In 1805 he was made a rear-admiral, though he did not hoist his flag. He died at Sant' Anton Palace, Attard, Malta, on 25 October 1809 and was buried on 31 October at Fort St Elmo, Valletta. He was survived by his wife, Mary, who died on 27 September 1832. Following his death the Maltese readily subscribed to a monument to Ball which still stands in Valletta's Lower Barracca Gardens.<br>
