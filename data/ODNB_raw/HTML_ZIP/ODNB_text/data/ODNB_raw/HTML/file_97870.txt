<span class="headword">Smith,  John</span>  (1824&#150;1879), <span class="occ">brewer</span>, was baptized on 14 April 1824 at St Peter's Church, Leeds, Yorkshire, the eldest of the five children of Samuel Smith, variously described as butcher and tanner, and his wife, Sarah Naylor, who had married at St Peter's seven years earlier. Samuel's business clearly did well. The 1851 census records him living at Brunswick House, Brunswick Place, Leeds, with two servants. Certainly his success had allowed John, the eldest of his three sons, to buy at the age of twenty-three, in 1847, the old-established (1758) brewery of Backhouse and Hartley attached to a coaching inn in nearby Tadcaster. To most observers its prospects must have seemed confined: the days of coaching inns in the railway age were numbered; the brewery, like those of the thousands of other publican brewers, was small. In 1861 John Smith still employed only eight men in his brewing and malting enterprise. But the prosperity of the 1850s and 1860s associated with the coming of the railways opened up new vistas for forward-looking young brewers like John Smith.<br>
<br>Nationally the consumption of beer enjoyed a rapid spurt in the two decades after the mid-1850s; agriculture enjoyed a celebrated &#145;golden age&#146; in the same years. Tadcaster's abundant supplies of hard water, not dissimilar to the celebrated ones of Burton upon Trent, were well suited to the production of those sharper, lighter beers the Victorian drinker increasingly demanded. Moreover, John Smith was fortunate that he could exploit the free-trade beer market in Leeds, one of the great burgeoning cities of Victorian England, no more than a dozen miles away. He also farmed extensively: the 1861 census records him employing eight men and three boys on his 301 acres. And in addition he had an interest in the limestone quarries on the edge of Tadcaster. John Smith was a typical country brewer of the early Victorian period: from a modest start he laid the foundations of the firm's later success, and with growing wealth, he was able to farm on an extensive scale during the prosperous years of &#145;high farming&#146;. He died at Tadcaster on 9 September 1879 leaving an estate valued at under &pound;45,000.<br>
<br>John Smith was unmarried, and his brewing and farming interests were jointly inherited for their lives by his two brothers, Samuel Smith (<i>b</i>. 1831) and <a name="cosubject_97869"></a><span class="headword">William Smith</span>  (1829&#150;1886)<span class="occ"></span>, who was baptized at St Peter's, Leeds, on 17 September 1829. Since he was also unmarried, the brewery was entailed to Samuel's heirs. But William, who according to the census of 1871 had carried on his father's tanning business, introduced his two Riley nephews&#151;Henry Herbert [<i>see below</i>] and Frank [<i>see below</i>]&#151;into the brewery after John's death. There they were given a sound training in every aspect of brewery management. They were the only children of Henry Wilkinson Riley (1837&#150;1898), a woollen cloth merchant in Leeds who had married John Smith's only sister, Sarah.<br>
<br>William Smith bought Samuel's share of his brother's personal estate, but since the brewery was destined to pass to Samuel's sons (who continued to brew at the old brewery) he took the bold step of building a state-of-the-art new brewery for his nephews in 1883&#150;4. Erected on a greenfield site in fine local limestone from the Smith quarries for the enormous cost of &pound;130,000, it was immediately lauded as the finest brewery in the north of England. It demonstrated, much more than the value of John Smith's estate, the distance the Smiths had come (William was now farming 1500 acres and employing 300 men), the profitability of brewing, and Tadcaster's growing reputation as a brewing centre of repute&#151;the Burton of the north, in the journalese of the industry's press. William Smith died at The Grange, Tadcaster, on 12 September 1886, leaving an estate valued at &pound;53,470.<br>
<br>The firm continued the headlong expansion that William Smith had initiated under the direction of his two young Riley nephews, henceforth known as Riley-Smith under the terms of his will. Growth in the 1880s was achieved by generous discounts of 20 per cent plus to the free trade, the establishment of twenty-two agencies and sixteen offices across the north of England, and the firm's reputation for good beer. When the Riley-Smiths floated their brewery as a public company in 1892 the details of the prospectus&#151;not overblown, unlike those of some other brewing companies, famously Allsopps&#151;revealed the happiest state of affairs, a condition Alfred Barnard had already enthusiastically outlined in his <span class="italic">Noted Breweries</span> two years earlier. The Riley-Smiths retained entire ownership of the &pound;300,000 ordinary shares and raised &pound;750,000 in four debenture issues in the next decade to fund the purchase of one of the largest tied-house estates of any English brewing company. Profits surged. In the four years 1899&#150;1902 they averaged &pound;81,728. Dividends of 27 per cent were paid on the ordinary shares. With a healthy &pound;25,000 allotted to reserves each year, the brewery was one of the best-run in Britain, a byword for first-class management.<br>
<br>The Riley-Smiths enjoyed their success to the full. <a name="cosubject_97870"></a><span class="headword">Henry Herbert  Riley-Smith</span>  (1863&#150;1911)<span class="occ"></span>, the more competent of the two brothers, was born at 2 Hillary Place, Leeds, on 23 March 1863, and was educated at Leeds grammar school. He lived at Toulston Lodge, Tadcaster, and on 21 December 1886 married Annie (<i>d</i>. 1899), daughter of Ralph Heaton of Edgbaston, manufacturer. In charge of a flourishing brewery at the age of twenty-three, he combined its management with hunting, golfing, and office in the principal trade organizations of the brewing industry. Genial and a good speaker, as early as 1896 he was reputed to have presided at more dinners and spoken at more meetings of the trade than anyone else in Yorkshire. Chairman of the Country Brewers Society in 1896 and of the Institute of Brewing in 1910, he was one of the foremost defenders of the brewing industry when it came under increasing attack from the temperance movement and the Liberal Party. Serving on the royal commission on the licensing laws in 1896&#150;9, and called to the bar in 1897, he was a county councillor and a member of the court of the University of Leeds, and unsuccessfully contested York as a Conservative at the election of January 1910. He died at Toulston Lodge on 19 May 1911. He was buried at Newton Kyme, Yorkshire. His estate was valued at &pound;500,000. He left two daughters and one son. The latter, William Riley-Smith (1890&#150;1954), who was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, became chairman of the company and a high sheriff of Yorkshire; a keen promoter of polo, he created grounds for the sport at Toulston and also, in 1934, made a large donation for a students' union building at Leeds University.<br>
<br>Henry Herbert Riley-Smith's younger brother, <a name="cosubject_97871"></a><span class="headword">Frank  Riley-Smith</span>  (1865&#150;1912)<span class="occ"></span>, born at Hillary Place, Leeds, on 16 December 1865, was less prominent in the affairs of the industry, and was said to have been more concerned with the practical side of the brewing operations. Resident at Kirkgate House, Tadcaster, he married, on 3 September 1890, Mary Mortimer, daughter of John Addinell Bromet, solicitor. Like his brother a keen volunteer, serving in the west Yorkshire rifles, he was also a vigorous devotee of the chase. In the late 1890s he settled in Suffolk, where he rented Barton Hall, near Bury St Edmunds, from the Bunburys and hunted various packs of hounds in the county between 1900 and his death. After succeeding his brother as chairman of the brewery he died at Barton Hall on 20 March 1912. His will was proved at &pound;540,000.<br>
<br>These great half-million pound estates of the Riley-Smiths revealed the fortunes that could be made by first-rank country brewers in the high feather days of public house acquisition between 1885 and 1902. And for well-managed companies like John Smiths the prosperous times continued. Within a generation the Riley-Smiths were enjoying incomes and lifestyles that only the very wealthiest members of the traditional landed class could match.<br>
