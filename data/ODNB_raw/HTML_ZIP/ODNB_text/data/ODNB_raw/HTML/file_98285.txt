<span class="headword">Hare,  Richard Gilbert</span>  (1907&#150;1966), <span class="occ">Russian scholar</span>, was born on 5 September 1907 in London, the second son and second child in the family of four sons and two daughters of Richard Granville Hare, Viscount Ennismore, later fourth earl of Listowel (1866&#150;1931), and his wife, Freda (1885&#150;1968), younger daughter of Francis Vanden-Bempde-Johnstone, second Baron Derwent. His brothers all enjoyed notable careers: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65196/', "William Francis Hare, later fifth earl of Listowel (1906&#150;1997)")</script>, as a Labour politician and colonial governor, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31197/', "John Hugh Hare, later first Viscount Blakenham (1911&#150;1982)")</script>, as a Conservative politician, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75537/', "Alan Victor Hare (1919&#150;1995)")</script> as an intelligence officer and chairman of the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>.<br>
<br>The Listowel family estates included Convamore, Ballyhooly, co. Cork (which was burnt down by Sinn F&eacute;in in 1921), the Oxton estate in Devon, Kingston House at 3 Knightsbridge, London, and the houses in Ennismore Gardens, London, but Hare's childhood was largely spent at 14 Bryanston Square and with his maternal grandparents in the holidays at Hackness Hall, near Scarborough. A sensitive and shy child, he was sent to Rugby School to toughen him up. Not given to sports, he was unhappy there, but found encouragement from William Wymar Vaughan, the headmaster, who recognized the academic potential of his young pupil. Vaughan's wife, Margaret, had been a close friend of Virginia Woolf, and as a frequent visitor to the Vaughan household it was through their daughter, Janet (later Dame Janet Vaughan, the haematologist) and her fianc&eacute;, David Gourlay, that Hare met the younger members of the Bloomsbury set in London in the late 1920s, and his future wife, the sculptor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64479/', "Dora Gordine (1895&#150;1991)")</script>.<br>
<br>In 1925 Hare went to Balliol College, Oxford, to study philosophy, politics, and economics, and graduated with a first-class degree in 1929. There followed a period at the Sorbonne and Berlin University as a Laming travelling fellow. He entered the diplomatic service in 1930 and served as third secretary at the British embassy in Paris and then from 1932 at the Foreign Office. In November 1931 his father died, leaving the family property to the two younger brothers, John and Alan. However, Hare did receive an amount sufficient to give him independent means, allow him to travel to the exotic locations then fashionable in artistic circles, and enable him to resign his post at the Foreign Office in 1933. In 1934 he was writing from the Hotel Satrya, Denpasar, Bali, to Godfrey Samuel, the modernist architect, praising the beauty of &#145;this remarkable place&#146; and complaining that &#145;it will probably soon be spoilt by Europeans&#146;  (Hare to Samuel, 7 April 1934, British Architectural Library, SaG/8/1). He also visited Dora Gordine and her first husband, G. H. Garlick (physician to the sultan of Johore), in Johore Bahru, Malaya. On his return to the UK he undertook the commissioning of a new studio house for Gordine from Samuel, on a plot in Hampstead. By June 1935 planning permission for the new house had been refused, Gordine's first marriage had failed, and she had returned to Europe. In 1935&#150;6 Hare financed and project-managed without an architect the building of Dorich House (in Kingston Vale, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, on the edge of Richmond Park) for Gordine, to her own remarkable design. He and Gordine were married at Chelsea register office on 6 November 1936 and lived in Dorich House until their deaths in 1966 and 1991 respectively.<br>
<br>Hare's Russian was excellent, leading to wartime service initially in the publicity department of the Anglo-Soviet relations division of the Ministry of Information. In 1944 he succeeded the spy Peter Smollett as director of the division. It was during this time that he decided to begin his collection of imperial Russian art. Berthe Malnick, who worked with him during the war and then as a colleague at the University of London, later wrote that Hare's &#145;work at the Ministry convinced him that the English public needed insight into Russia as much as Russians needed knowledge of Britain&#146;  (Malnick, 271).<br>
<br>After the war Hare was invited to return to the Foreign Office, but decided instead to further his interest in Russian literature, art, and culture by translating <span class="italic">Fathers and Children</span>, <span class="italic">A Nobleman's Nest</span>, and <span class="italic">Rudin</span> by Ivan Turgenev, one of his favourite authors, for Hutchinson (1947). Another translation undertaken in 1949 for John Lehman was <span class="italic">Dark Avenues and Other Stories</span> by Ivan Bunin. Hare wrote in the foreword &#145;These stories &hellip; are mainly centred in erotic episodes, which provide vivid and disquieting glimpses into the recent Russian past and into a state of mind which seemed to accept the disintegration of Russian culture as a decree of fate.&#146; In 1947&#150;8 Hare was a Rockefeller Foundation fellow at the Hoover Institute, Stanford University, the premier resource at that time for Russian studies, and in 1949 he joined the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, University of London, as a lecturer. He became a reader in 1960 and holder of the first chair of Russian literature in 1962. In 1959 he was a visiting lecturer in Russian literature at the University of Indiana.<br>
<br>Hare's first book, <span class="italic">Russian Literature from Pushkin to the Present Day</span> (1947), was an introduction to Russian literature for a public that was newly interested in Russian culture after the wartime alliance. Other publications included <span class="italic">Pioneers of Russian Social Thought</span> (1951), <span class="italic">Portraits of Russian Personalities between Reform and Revolution</span> (1959), and <span class="italic">Maxim Gorky: Romantic Realist and Conservative Revolutionary</span> (1962). Hare's affection for and sometimes exasperation with the Russian psyche shone through his very personal considerations of the work of Russian writers. His books received mixed reviews for their restrained but opinionated tone, but there was general acknowledgement of the breadth of his scholarship, drawn from material that had not previously been published in English. His last book, <span class="italic">The Art and Artists of Russia</span> (1965), was a beautifully illustrated survey of porcelain, silver, icons, portraits, and other art in Russia before the revolution, and included many examples from his own by now extensive collection at Dorich House. It was panned as serious scholarship by Vera K. Ostoia in the <span class="italic">Slavic Review</span>, but well received by others and recommended by <span class="italic">The Times</span> as a challenge to popular generalizations of Russian nineteenth-century art, and for its &#145;exceptionally clear and fine&#146; illustrations  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 22 April 1965). Hare also wrote numerous articles for journals and other publications, including the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, <span class="italic">The Connoisseur</span>, the <span class="italic">Russian Review</span>, the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>, and the <span class="italic">Royal Society of Arts Journal</span>. He regularly contributed articles to the <span class="italic">Slavonic and East European Review</span>, and was on its editorial board for some years.<br>
<br>Hare was a sceptic and a committed modernist. A shy, gentle person, he lived chiefly for beauty, art, and his writing. He found in his wife, Dora, a lifelong companion who understood and admired his quiet personality, which provided a perfect foil to her energetic artistic zeal and exuberance. The name of their home, Dorich, was a conflation of their two names, and their life there was spent entertaining friends and collecting and making art. He died at Dorich House of a heart attack on 14 September 1966, without an heir and with a sense of estrangement from his family, leaving his widow to fulfil his wishes to leave Dorich House and his collection of imperial Russian art for the enjoyment of the British nation.<br>
