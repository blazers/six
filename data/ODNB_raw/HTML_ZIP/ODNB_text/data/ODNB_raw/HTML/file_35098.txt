<span class="headword">Moresby,  John</span>  (1830&#150;1922), <span class="occ">naval officer and explorer</span>, was born at Allerton, Somerset, on 15 March 1830, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19204/', "Admiral of the Fleet Sir Fairfax Moresby (1786/7&#150;1877)")</script> and his wife, Eliza Louisa, the youngest daughter of John Williams, of Bakewell, Derbyshire. He was educated at a private school until the age of twelve, when he joined the Royal Navy in the <i>Caledonia</i>, then the port flagship at Devonport. In 1845 he sailed as a midshipman in the frigate <i>America</i> for the Pacific via Cape Horn. The <i>America</i> returned to England the following year, and Moresby next served with the Channel Fleet. He was in the paddle frigate <i>Odin</i> at Palermo during the 1848 rising. In 1849 he joined the <i>Excellent</i> for gunnery instruction, and was then appointed gunnery mate of the frigate <i>Amphitrite</i>. In 1850 he sailed for the west coast of South America. Shortly afterwards he was transferred to the frigate <i>Thetis</i> as gunnery lieutenant, and in 1853 commanded a punitive expedition against the natives of Vancouver Island. After returning home on promotion, Moresby joined the paddle sloop <i>Driver</i> as first lieutenant in 1854, on the eve of war with Russia. For two summers he was on reconnaissance work in the Baltic, and participated in the taking of the Bomarsund forts and the abortive attack on Riga.<br>
<br>On the conclusion of peace with Russia, Moresby was appointed flag lieutenant to the admiral in command of the Irish station and was given leave to accompany his father to Austria when Sir Fairfax Moresby represented the British navy at the centenary of the order of Maria Theresa.<br>
<br>In 1858 Moresby became commander. The following year he married Jane Willis (<i>d</i>. 1876), the eldest daughter of Philip Scott JP, of Queenstown (later Cobh), Ireland; they had one son and four daughters. In 1861 he was appointed to command the gun vessel <i>Snake</i> on the China station, where he took part in the suppression of the Taiping uprising and saw action at Shanghai. The <i>Snake</i> was later engaged in suppressing piracy on the coasts of southern China and in safeguarding the rights of British ships trading in opium. In the sloop <i>Argus</i>, of which he took command in 1863, Moresby went to Japan and took part in the international attack on the Shimonoseki forts in 1864 and in the subsequent naval demonstration in Japanese waters.<br>
<br>In 1865 Moresby was promoted captain and went on half pay until 1871, when he was given command of the paddle sloop <i>Basilisk</i> for service on the Australian station. The <i>Basilisk</i> was not a surveying vessel and carried no officers specially trained for such work, but the opportunities for exploration in her cruising area led Moresby to apply for a small outfit of surveying instruments. Between 1872 and 1874, except for two cruises to New Zealand and among the south sea islands respectively, the ship was in Torres Strait and along the coasts of New Guinea. Although primarily concerned with the suppression of the kidnapping of native labour, she carried out a series of important explorations, charting much coastline hitherto very imperfectly known.<br>
<br>In the last year of Moresby's work the hydrographer sent him a surveying officer, but otherwise he received scant encouragement until, at the end of her commission, the <i>Basilisk</i> was ordered to return home round to the north of New Guinea in order that the survey work might be continued. The south-east coast of New Guinea was then scarcely known. (The work of Luis Vaes de Torres in 1606 at the eastern end of the island was revealed only in 1878 by the discovery of his map in Madrid.) Moresby surveyed, on the south coast, Hall Sound and Redscar Bay, and discovered Port Moresby, Fairfax harbour (which he named after his father), and Discovery Bay, as well as charting their approaches and various islets and reefs in Torres Strait. By Hilda and Ethel rivers he tried to penetrate the unknown interior. He next surveyed at the east end Hayter, Basilisk, and Moresby islands and China and Fortescue Strait, and took possession of the islands in the name of Queen Victoria (1873). Of the eastern part of the north coast nothing was known at the time except a few vague landfalls of J. A. B. d'Entrecasteaux in 1793. Moresby charted the whole coast westward to Astrolabe Bay as well as the islands of the d'Entrecasteaux group&#151;Normanby, Ferguson, and Goodenough. In all, his surveys covered 1200 miles of unknown coastline and about a hundred islands.<br>
<br>Moresby returned home at the end of 1874 to find that, while geographers realized the value of his work, the hydrographer had become strangely indifferent and the government of the day had no anxiety to establish a British claim to eastern New Guinea. It was not until 1884 that the hand of the government was forced by the action of Queensland, and a British protectorate, with its capital at Port Moresby, was proclaimed in the south-east of the island. The greater part of Moresby's discoveries eventually fell into German hands, but on 17 September 1914 Kaiser Wilhelm Land, as the territory had been called, surrendered to an Australian force; it was administered by Australia from 1920 until it gained independence as a part of Papua New Guinea in 1975.<br>
<br>After a short spell in charge of the coastguards between Cromer and St Abb's Head, Moresby was senior naval officer in charge of the Bermuda Dockyard from 1878 to 1881; there he effected many improvements. In 1881 he became rear-admiral and was appointed assessor to the Board of Trade. He retired in 1888 with the rank of vice-admiral and became admiral on the retired list in 1893. In 1909 he published an autobiography, <span class="italic">Two Admirals</span>, which included an account of his father's career. In recognition of his discoveries in New Guinea he enjoyed the distinction of having his name bestowed on a destroyer built in 1916. He died at 9 Lindon Grove, Alverstoke, Hampshire, on 12 July 1922.<br>
