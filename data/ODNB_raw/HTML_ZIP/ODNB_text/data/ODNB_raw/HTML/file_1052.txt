<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bailey,  John</span>  (1644&#150;1697), <span class="occ">nonconformist minister</span>, was born on 24 February 1644, probably at Altham, near Blackburn, Lancashire, the son of Thomas Bailey (<i>d</i>. 1673). His father was notorious for his drunkenness and profligacy but the young Bailey acquired both his mother's piety and her strength of character. An Independent congregation led by the Revd Thomas Jolly met at Altham; its churchbook recorded in 1657 that Bailey was &#145;a wonderful child for a spirit of prayer, experimental discourse, and being the occasion of good to his father and a school-fellow&#146;. Cotton Mather reported independently that by this time the boy was already conducting family worship; either out of admiration or humiliation, Thomas Bailey abandoned his old habits and became a reformed character, and joined Jolly's congregation. John attended Blackburn grammar school, then under the mastership of Charles Sagar (1636&#150;1698). Later he studied theology under Dr Thomas Harrison, a nonconformist minister at Chester.<br>
<br>John Bailey began his career as a lay preacher at the age of twenty-two. In February 1665 he was arrested with Thomas Jolly and imprisoned, perhaps not for the last time, in Lancaster gaol. He was released after three months, perhaps following intervention by the Houghton family of Houghton Cross; it seems, however, that he lost the favour of Sarah, Lady Houghton after criticizing the breach between herself and her husband, Sir Richard. In 1670 Bailey was &#145;formally set apart for the ministry&#146;, but later in the year he emigrated to Dublin, and there married his first wife, Lydia (<i>d</i>. 1690). In Dublin too, despite his own dislike of the ceremony, he appears to have undergone formal presbyterian ordination with the laying on of hands; as he later wrote to his congregation in Limerick: &#145;For you (tho it was a great act of self denial) I was ordained&#146;  (Bailey, <span class="italic">Man's Chief End</span>, 2nd pagination, 2). At Limerick there was among Bailey's auditory a relation of the duke of Ormond. When this came to the notice of the bishop he protested to the duke against the impunity which his connection thus encouraged among dissenters. Ormond's response was to invite Bailey to be his chaplain; but neither this, nor the offers of a deanery, or even the next vacant Irish bishopric, which reputedly followed, were sufficient to induce him to conform. Later Bailey's preaching activities led to his arraignment. It is reported that he protested before the judges of assize that:<blockquote>If I had been drinking, gaming and carousing at a tavern, with company, my lords, I presume that I would not have procured my being thus treated as an offender. Must prayers to God and preaching Christ with a company of Christians who are peaceable, inoffensive, and serviceable to his majesty and the government, as any of his subjects&#151;must this be considered a greater crime?</blockquote>to which the answer came that it was  (Palmer, 1.331). He was imprisoned, and was released on promising to leave Ireland within a specified period without making further contact with his congregation, which he had by now served for twelve years.<br>
<br>Bailey emigrated to New England, probably in the spring of 1684, for it was surely not long after his arrival in Boston that he framed a letter, dated 8 May, to his congregation in Limerick. Nathaniel Mather thought Bailey had been encouraged to undertake the voyage by Samuel Willard, the minister at the Old South Church in Boston, and indeed the newcomer was soon appointed as his assistant; on 2 March 1685, Samuel Sewall recorded that Bailey &#145;preached from <span class="roman">Amos</span> 4.12 and Mr Willard from <span class="roman">2 Cor</span> &hellip; both sermons and prayers excellent&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Samuel Sewall</span>, 59). Soon after the Independent congregation at Watertown, Connecticut, invited Bailey to fill the vacancy caused by the death of its pastor, John Sherman; Bailey accepted, preaching his farewell sermon in Boston on 25 July 1686, and leaving the town in the same week. As he records, &#145;Upon the 6<sup>th</sup> October 1686 I was solemnly set apart for the pastoral work at Watertown without the imposition of hands&#146;  (Francis, 51). Sewall recorded that on &#145;Wednesday Oct 6: Mr Bayly is ordained at Watertown but not as congregational men are&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Samuel Sewall</span>, 123). It seems clear that Bailey accepted the need to be &#145;set apart&#146; to his new pastorate, but that he retained his dislike (shared by many Independents) of the ceremony to which he had reluctantly submitted in 1670.<br>
<br>Within a month or so of Bailey's ordination Thomas, his younger brother, was appointed as his assistant. It seems that John was already in poor health, for on 25 March 1686, before his departure for Watertown, Sewall recorded that &#145;Mr Willard exerciseth all day, Mr Bayly being constrained to keep house by reason of the gout&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Samuel Sewall</span>, 101). Thomas Bailey died on 31 January 1689 aged only thirty-five; the church's anxiety to secure the services of a new assistant (Henry Gibbs) must surely reflect the continued ill health of their pastor. John Bailey's illness was compounded by bouts of depression, perhaps exacerbated by sadness at the death on 12 April 1690 of his wife, Lydia. Bailey for many years kept a diary, using it to keep an account of his lonely spiritual struggles. Later, Cotton Mather published extensive extracts, in which the demands of his conscience sometimes appear almost comically excessive&#151;&#145;I was too forgetful of God, and exceeding in tobacco. The Lord pardon that, and all other sins, and heal this nature, and humble this heart&#146;&#151;and in which the author occasionally approaches despair at his own weakness: &#145;I am oppressed unto death, and filled with the angry arrows of God: it ariseth not from any particular cause, but the sense of my woeful estate in general&#146;  (Mather, 234, 236).<br>
<br>In 1692 Bailey resigned his charge at Watertown and bid farewell to the town, its churches, and people:<blockquote>saints but sinners also, old but young also, all my children which grieved me most, friends and foes, the sweet singers of Israel, all widows and fatherless families, all moralized persons, all that heard me not now, the pulpit, pew seats and galleries (the cushion I left as a token of my love), all my administrations, him that digs the graves, neighbouring towns and churches. (Sprague, 1.203)</blockquote>He returned to Boston, where in July 1693 he was accepted as an assistant to the pastor of the First Church. There on 26 December 1695 he married Susannah Wilkins (who on 28 December 1699, after Bailey's death, became the wife of the Revd Peter Thatcher). It was Burgess's practice to preach at the First Church once a month and at the Old South Church every other Sunday. But on Sunday 12 December 1697 &#145;about 3 am just the time he should have stood up to preach for Mr Willard, Mr John Bayly dieth, after much pain and illness by the Gout and other distempers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Samuel Sewall</span>, 384). According to Francis, he &#145;was honourably interred on the 16<sup>th</sup> day in the tomb of Mr Thomas Deane&#146; in Boston  (Francis, 52). Cotton Mather preached his funeral sermon. An oil painting, representing his &#145;pensive and somewhat feminine face and long flowing hair&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) is in the possession of the Massachusetts Historical Society.<br>
