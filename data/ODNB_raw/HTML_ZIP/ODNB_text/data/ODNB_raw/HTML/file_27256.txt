<span class="headword">Thompson,  Benjamin</span>  (1775/6&#150;1816), <span class="occ">playwright and translator</span>, was the son of Benjamin Blaydes Thompson, a merchant and magistrate of Kingston upon Hull and Eastdale, Yorkshire, and his wife, Deborah Walter. Having &#145;received a liberal education&#146;  (&#145;Some account&#146;, 4), he was intended for the law, but, finding it uncongenial, went instead to Hamburg as his father's agent. His leisure hours were spent translating August Kotzebue, whose vogue in England was just beginning and whom he came to know personally. Thompson's translation of <span class="italic">Menschenhass und Reue</span> (&#145;Misanthropy and repentance&#146;) as <span class="italic">The Stranger</span> was selected for Drury Lane. Revised by R. B. Sheridan&#151;who improved Thompson's stagecraft and contributed the songs&#151;it was performed with John Philip Kemble in the title role on 24 March 1798. The third most successful hit of the season, it became a staple ingredient of the stage throughout London and the provinces for at least the next fifty years. When the play was first printed in 1800, Thompson was obliged to defend it from imputations that translations of <span class="italic">The Stranger</span> by competitors Schink and Papendick (both published 1798) were the basis of the stage production. After Thompson's death Sheridan, with less than justice, reportedly claimed <span class="italic">The Stranger</span>, &#145;as it is acted&#146;, as essentially his work, not Thompson's  (<span class="italic">Journal of Thomas Moore</span>, 2.754). It was reprinted, correctly under Thompson's name, in virtually every play series of the century; and its overwhelming success earned him the sobriquet &#145;Stranger Thompson&#146;. None of Thompson's other translations of Kotzebue was ever performed, but they were printed collectively (3 vols., 1801) and also issued, with unacted translations of Schiller, Babo, Goethe, Iffland, Lessing, Reitzenstein, and Schroeder, as <span class="italic">The German Theatre</span> (6 vols., 1801 etc.). The melodrama <span class="italic">Rokeby, or, The Buccaneer's Revenge</span>, based on Scott's poem, was printed in Dublin (1814).<br>
<br>After Thompson's marriage at Chesterfield on 23 May 1799 to Jane (<i>bap</i>. 1775), the youngest daughter of the Revd John Bourne, rector of Sutton-cum-Duckworth and South Wingfield, Derbyshire, the couple settled in Arnold, Nottingham. In the summer of 1808 Thompson's theatrical friends Tom Dibdin and Charles Farley visited and spent &#145;a most delightful week among some of the leading families of the town and neighbourhood&#146;  (Dibdin, 1.419). At this time Thompson published his only novel, <span class="italic">The Florentines</span> (1808). About 1810 Thompson and his family settled in London, where he supplemented his income by editing and theatrical reviewing. At his death he was negotiating to assist Dibdin in his new management venture at the Surrey Theatre.<br>
<br>Outside literature Thompson had a keen interest in agriculture (in which he speculated unwisely), especially sheep-farming. For a short period, until ill health forced his retirement, he was secretary to the Merino Society and translated, from the French of C. P. Lasteyrie, a treatise on the introduction of merinos into Europe and the Cape of Good Hope (1810).<br>
<br>Thompson's two other dramas, performed at Drury Lane, failed badly: an operatic drama, <span class="italic">Godolphin, or, The Lion of the North</span> (12 October 1812), a historical piece set in Nottingham, and the romance, <span class="italic">Oberon's Oath</span> (21 May 1816), adapted from Christophe-Martin Wieland. Despite Thompson's high hopes for the latter, it fell victim to an organized claque. According to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, &#145;a violent, and, as it appears to us, a most unprovoked and offensive effort, was made by some party, who were scattered through the house, to damn this unpretending production, without the least regard to its actual merits&#146;  (23 May). This disappointment, coupled with depression resulting from an earlier illness, is said to have caused Thompson's death from an apoplectic fit at his house in Blackfriars Road, London, on 26 May 1816; he was buried on the 31st. Immediately a public appeal was launched by means of printed bills beseeching &#145;the benevolence of the public&#146;  (Royal Literary Fund archive) towards his distressed widow and six children, the youngest, a girl aged three, being nearly blind. Jane Thompson's application to the Literary Fund, supported by a recommendation from the bookseller&#150;publisher Henry Colburn, produced &pound;25; and a subscription edition of <span class="italic">Oberon's Oath</span> attracted over 350 subscribers, including Lady Caroline Lamb and old friends like Tom and Charles Dibdin, Grimaldi, and Edmund Kean. In the prefatory memoir Thompson is described as strict in manners but &#145;an affectionate husband, and a tender father; sincere in his friendship, and scrupulously honourable in all his engagements&#146;  (&#145;Some account&#146;, 12).<br>
