<span class="headword">Paslew,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1537), <span class="occ">abbot of Whalley</span>, was probably from the Paslew family of Wiswell in Whalley, Lancashire. He became a Cistercian monk, but nothing is known of him until he was elected abbot in 1507, when he was apparently in his late thirties. Surprisingly, he was not ordained priest until 1518. Whalley was in the second rank of Cistercian houses: not one of the greatest, but large, fairly well endowed, and successful. Paslew was ambitious for himself and for the abbey. He rebuilt the abbot's lodgings, added a lady chapel to the church, and probably built the north-east gateway. He travelled widely across the north and to London; he assumed a mitre, was summoned to the Canterbury convocation in 1529, and acted as a collector of clerical taxation in 1532. But Paslew's achievements had a price, and in 1530 he began to sell abbey plate, and to pursue tithes and fees more aggressively in the appropriated parishes, that is, those where the monastery appointed the vicar and received the most valuable tithes.<br>
<br>Paslew's pride was to be followed by a dramatic fall. With a gross annual revenue of &pound;541 and twenty-seven monks, the abbey was outside the terms of the 1536 <span class="roman">Act of Suppression</span>, which was directed against the smaller monasteries, and seemed safe: paradoxically, it was brought down by the Pilgrimage of Grace, the movement which aimed to save the monasteries. In the autumn of 1536 Paslew and his monks were caught between the northern insurgents and a force raised for the king by the earl of Derby. The earl planned a muster at Whalley on 30 October, but rebels from Yorkshire had got there first. On 23 October, after a brief and perhaps token resistance, the abbey opened its gates to the rebels and Paslew and eight of his monks took the rebel oath to protect the church and the commons. Paslew was summoned by the rebel leadership to conferences at York and Pontefract, but did not attend and seems to have taken no further part in the rebellion. Nevertheless, and despite a general pardon, after the failure of the rising he was tried for treason by royal commissioners at Lancaster. Old, ill, and apparently in despair, Paslew seems to have expected fulfilment of a dream that he would die in 1536&#150;7: he pleaded guilty to five counts, and was executed at Lancaster on 10 March 1537. The precise grounds for his conviction are not known, but the crown used it as a pretext for closing the abbey. A month after Paslew's execution his monks were ejected and his house was no more.<br>
