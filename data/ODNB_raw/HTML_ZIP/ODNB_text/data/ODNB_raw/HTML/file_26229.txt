<span class="headword">Standish,  Arthur</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1552&#150;1615), <span class="occ">writer on agriculture</span>, was, on his own assertion, a descendant of the Standish family, of Standish, near Wigan, Lancashire, and was plainly familiar with the layout of Standish Hall and grounds. Northamptonshire, Huntingdonshire, or Cambridgeshire are most likely candidates for his home county. His place of residence remains unknown, though his writing shows an acquaintance with the East Anglian fens. Other Standishes in his or the next generation were connected with Peterborough and Brixworth, Northamptonshire, Conington in north Huntingdonshire, and west Cambridgeshire, and several Standishes attended Cambridge University. In the will, dated 1552, of Dr Richard Standish (<i>d</i>. 1553), rector of Standish, Arthur shared with a brother and three sisters a bequest of &pound;50. They were named as the children of Thomas Standish, one of the two feoffees who instituted Richard as rector on 19 May 1541, but the precise relationship was not disclosed.<br>
<br>The midland revolt in 1607 had troubled Standish deeply, and it is noteworthy that three of the rebel villages in Northamptonshire were Pytchley, Rushton, and Haselbech, close to Brixworth, where one Standish branch held the manor. In a search for measures to reduce discontent among the common people, Standish made a four-year journey through the kingdom in search of answers. He was seemingly a curious, gregarious, and sociable enquirer, questioning all he encountered, including surveyors, husbandmen, and working men. The resulting essay, <span class="italic">The Commons Complaint</span>, was personally approved by James I. Henry Peacham wrote in praise of the author in the 1611 edition. Eight versions are known, four of 1611, and four more of 1612, 1613, 1614, and 1615. The texts of each edition were changed to accommodate new knowledge, and the last three were much abbreviated, given another title, <span class="italic">New Directions of Experience to the Commons Complaint</span>, and focused on one only of the four &#145;complaints&#146; with which he started.<br>
<br>Central to Standish's concerns was the destruction of woods, leading to high fuel and food prices, which, he said, had risen faster since 1605 than in the previous twenty years. His remedies for fuel shortages were the planting of more trees, and, to increase food supplies, the planting of fruit trees, the destruction of vermin, the breeding of wildfowl and poultry, and the reduction of dovecotes, since pigeons consumed much grain.<br>
<br>Standish gave practical instructions on tree-planting, especially of fruit trees&#151;notably apples, wardens, pears, walnuts, and chestnuts&#151;either in hedgerows or in orchards, where he insisted on regular planting in rows and on cereals being grown for some years between the rows. He urged attention to soils and the use of lime as a fertilizer, gave measured distances for the trees, and expected the better feeding of livestock, including pigs fed on mast, and more cider and perry for households and for sale. Combating vermin meant reducing rooks, crows, sparrows, buzzards, kites, and other birds of prey. He was alone among his contemporaries in recommending fowl and poultry plots. These were to be hedged enclosures, for taming and breeding wildfowl such as ducks and mallards, and for the keeping of hens. His scheme was inspired by his observations in St James's Park in London and at Standish, but it benefited from knowledge of practices in the East Anglian fens, where local people regularly collected wild birds' eggs in spring. The details on breeding, feeding, housing, and killing the birds were precise and practical, with estimates of costs and profits. A clear illustration of a hedged and moated wildfowl or poultry plot appeared in editions of 1611 and 1612. In the texts of 1613, 1614, and 1615 the poultry&#150;wildfowl project was omitted; it had evidently not evoked public interest, though a not dissimilar scheme for wildfowl decoys did succeed. The revised text dealt only with the replanting of woodlands. Current concerns had shifted the weight of different arguments, and prominence was now given to human greed for profit, the needs of the iron and glass industries for fuel, and a fear that coal near the coast, though easily shipped, might not prove a sufficient substitute. Nothing is known of Standish's later life, nor of the date or circumstances of his death.<br>
