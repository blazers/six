<span class="headword">Simson,  William</span>  (<em>b. </em>1562, <em>d.</em> in or after 1623), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and Hebraist</span>, was born on 13 August 1562 in Perth, probably the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25601/', "Andrew Simson (c.1526&#150;1591?)")</script>, rector of Perth grammar school, and Violet, daughter of Patrick Adamson, a Perth baker, and sister of Patrick Adamson (1537&#150;1592). Among his six brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25605/', "Patrick Simson (1556&#150;1618)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25603/', "Archibald Simson (1564&#150;1628)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25600/', "Alexander Simson (1570&#150;1639)")</script>. He matriculated at St Andrews in 1577 and graduated MA in 1581. Thereafter his movements are elusive. He probably fled to England with other presbyterians after the pro-episcopal black acts of May 1584, perhaps with James Carmichael (<i>c</i>.1543&#150;1628), who married his sister Violet. Simson contributed a Latin and Greek verse eulogy to Carmichael's <span class="italic">Grammaticae Latinae</span>, published at Cambridge in 1587.<br>
<br>In 1593 Simson attended the general assembly at Dundee, probably as an elder, since he was named among those about to enter the ministry. By 1597 he was serving as minister of Burntisland, Fife. Its historic church had been built by the town in 1592, but no provision made for stipend. The assembly of March 1600 therefore agreed that Simson should get a share of stipend for assisting at Ceres in Fife, but also gave him liberty to seek a fresh charge. His attendance at the assembly which convened in Burntisland on 12 May 1601 is not recorded. On 23 June that year he was presented by James VI to Dumbarton. He remained opposed to episcopacy and in July 1607 withdrew from the synod of Clydesdale when it accepted a bishop&#151;John Spottiswoode&#151;as moderator. The same year he was chosen master of Dumbarton's grammar school, and in August 1608 was admitted a burgess by the town council. John Skene's <span class="italic">Regiam majestatem Scotiae</span> (Edinburgh, 1609) contained a Latin verse tribute by Simson (not in the English version of the same year).<br>
<br>By October 1614 the Dumbarton council was seeking a replacement minister because of Simson's absence in England, and by the autumn of 1616 William Blair had succeeded him. Meanwhile, on 22 December 1615 Glasgow commissary court issued letters of &#145;horneing and poynding&#146; against Simson for non-payment of &pound;66 9<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. to a Glasgow tailor. His presence in England is confirmed by his book <span class="italic">De accentibus Hebraicis</span>, published in London in 1617, the earliest treatise on Hebrew by a Scot. Its preface, dated 1 September 1617, has a dedication to Sir Christopher Hatton (<i>c</i>.1581&#150;1619), known for other literary and musical patronage, and was written &#145;ex Musaeo nostro Vanstedano&#146;, which must refer to Wanstead, perhaps to Wanstead House, near Barking, but may possibly indicate Hatton's residence at Clay Hall. It also mentions other Hebrew writings&#151;an etymological table and a grammatical analysis of <span class="roman">Genesis</span> 1&#151;which scarcity of Hebrew type left unpublished.<br>
<br>Further details of Simson's English sojourns remain to be uncovered. He may have married Alice Wakeman, whose name appears English. He is last sighted writing a preface, &#145;To the Christian Reader&#146;, in the second edition of <span class="italic">The Christian Synagogue</span> by John Wemyss (<i>d</i>. 1636), another Scottish ministerial Hebraist, published at London in 1623. An alleged sighting of him in Edinburgh in November 1624  (Couper, 128) is a case of mistaken identity. It is not known when Simson died.<br>
