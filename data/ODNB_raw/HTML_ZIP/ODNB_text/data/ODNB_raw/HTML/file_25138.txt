<span class="headword">Seward,  William Wenman</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1805/6), <span class="occ">writer on Irish politics and topography</span>, may have been born in Dublin. He entered King's Inns, Dublin, and was admitted as an attorney in May 1776. He practised in the Irish court of common pleas from an address in Prussia Street, Dublin, from 1781 until 1804. Briefly, in 1805, he shared premises at 151 James's Street. His death&#151;which probably occurred in Dublin&#151;was reported in <span class="italic">Walker's Hibernian Magazine</span> for February 1806.<br>
<br>Seward was the author of a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The rights of the people asserted and the necessity of a more equal representation in parliament stated and proved</span> (1783), which extolled the Irish volunteer movement (to which he belonged) and advocated parliamentary reform in Ireland. His second publication, <span class="italic">The Hibernian gazetteer; being a description of the &hellip; towns in Ireland alphabetically arranged</span> (1789), was a compilation of information on the towns and villages of Ireland derived from other published sources (among them the studies of certain Irish counties by Charles Smith). It was novel for its alphabetical arrangement of place names. Such was its success that Seward revised and expanded it into a quarto volume containing some 6000 entries: <span class="italic">Topographia Hibernica, or, The topography of Ireland ancient and modern giving a complete view of the civil and ecclesiastical state of that kingdom</span> (1795; repr., 1797). The new work included entries on lakes, canals, harbours, caves, heaths, and so on, and, like its predecessor, was remarkable for its thoroughness and precision. An interleaved copy in the British Library has extensive manuscript notes by the author. Seward wrote his final work, a contemporary history entitled <span class="italic">Collectanea politica, or, The political transactions of Ireland from the accession of his majesty King George the III</span> (3 vols., 1801&#150;4), at a time of strong passions and prejudices in Ireland engendered by the rebellion of 1798. Largely a compilation of contemporary documents, it was remarkable for the author's unwillingness to be judgemental and was justifiably described by Seward as &#145;a plain and impartial narrative&#146;.<br>
<br>Nothing is known for certain of William Wenman Seward's lineage, but it seems likely that he belonged to the same family as John Seward, the Dublin mathematical instrument maker, who was born about 1701 and was still flourishing about 1750. He was presumably the father, or an uncle, of Thomas Seward, the attorney with whom he shared premises in 1805, whose name appeared in the Dublin directories from 1800 until 1846, and who acted as the duke of Devonshire's Irish law agent in 1816. He is not to be confused with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25137/', "William Seward (1747&#150;1799) FRS")</script>.<br>
