<span class="headword">Thomas,  Edward</span>  (1813&#150;1886), <span class="occ">scholar of Indian history and numismatics</span>, was born on 31 December 1813 in Brixton, Surrey, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27221/', "Honoratus Leigh Thomas (1769&#150;1846)")</script>, surgeon, and his wife, a daughter of the anatomist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6846/', "William Cumberland Cruikshank")</script>. Thomas was educated at the East India College at Haileybury, and went to India in 1832 as a &#145;writer&#146; in the Bengal service of the company. Illness interfered with his duties and compelled several absences in England on sick leave. When Lord Dalhousie, impressed by his abilities, offered him in 1852 the post of foreign secretary to the government of India, Thomas was reluctantly obliged to decline it on health grounds. After acting for a short time as judge at Delhi, he was appointed superintending judge of the Saugor and Nerbudda territory. He retired on a pension in 1857, and spent the rest of his life in scholarly pursuits, attending the meetings of learned societies and writing numerous essays and articles on oriental archaeology.<br>
<br>By breaking ground in a dozen hitherto obscure subjects&#151;such as Bactrian, Indo-Scythian, and Sassanian coins, Indian metrology, Persian gems and inscriptions&#151;Thomas rendered important services to science. These were recognized by his election as a fellow of the Royal Society on 8 June 1871, as correspondent of the Institut de France in January 1873, and as honorary member of the Russian Academy, and by his decoration as companion of the Indian Empire. His chief published volumes were his <span class="italic">Chronicles of the Pathan Kings of Delhi</span> (1847; 2nd enlarged edn, 1871), and his edition of James Prinsep's <span class="italic">Essays on Indian Antiquities</span> and <span class="italic">Useful Tables</span> (2 vols., 1858), which he enriched with valuable notes, and rendered indispensable as a work of reference for oriental archaeologists. Other noteworthy publications were <span class="italic">Coins of the Kings of Ghazni</span> (1847&#150;58), <span class="italic">Initial Coinage of Bengal</span> (1866, 1873), <span class="italic">Early Sassanian Inscriptions</span> (1868), <span class="italic">Ancient Indian Weights</span> (1874, being part 1 of the new <span class="italic">Numismata orientalia</span> which he edited for the publisher Nicholas Tr&uuml;bner), and <span class="italic">The Revenue of the Mughal Empire</span> (1871&#150;82). His numerous short papers in the transactions of learned societies, albeit often avowedly premature and containing tentative views which later study caused him to modify or abandon, not only bore the marks of a fine gift for palaeography, numismatics, and a wide command of archaeology, but gave impetus to further studies in these fields. Many of these papers appeared in the <span class="italic">Numismatic Chronicle</span> between 1847 and 1883, but the greater number were contributed to the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society</span> of which society he was a member for forty years and treasurer for twenty-five, and in which his influence and advice were deeply felt and valued. A list of his principal writings is appended to the biographical note in its annual report (May 1886). His findings in numismatics are still referred to in standard works of Indian history. Thomas died at his home, 47 Victoria Road, Kensington, London, on 10 February 1886 and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
