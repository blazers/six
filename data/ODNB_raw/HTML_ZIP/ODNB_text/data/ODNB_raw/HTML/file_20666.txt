<span class="headword">Okey,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1606, <em>d.</em> 1662), <span class="occ">parliamentarian soldier and regicide</span>, was the sixth child and second son of William Okey of St Giles-in-the-Fields, London, and his wife, Margaret Wetherley. The Okey family owned property in London and possessed a coat of arms. John was baptized on 24 August 1606 at St Giles-in-the-Fields, and he married Susanna Pearson in the same church on 21 January 1630. By 1640 he was the proprietor of a ships' chandler's business near the Tower of London and, according to the republican writer Edmund Ludlow, was a citizen of London. The Oxford antiquarian Anthony Wood, who suggested he was employed as a humble drayman and stoker before the civil war, almost certainly underestimated his social origins. After the death of his first wife Okey married in 1658 Mary (1629&#150;1697), the widow of John Blackwell. Okey possessed a radical religious outlook, and worshipped as both a Baptist and a Congregationalist.<br>
<br>At the start of the civil war Okey enlisted in the earl of Essex's parliamentarian army and served first as a quartermaster and then as a captain of horse. He was later a major in Hesilrige's regiment and in April 1643 he took part in the defence of Lichfield. On the formation of the New Model Army in 1645 he was appointed colonel of a regiment of dragoons formerly commanded by John Lilburne. Later that year he fought at the battle of Naseby, where he saved the day for John Butler's cavalry regiment, which was in danger of being routed by Prince Rupert's cavalry. In a communication written after the battle he declared that the parliamentarians &#145;should magnifie the name of our God that did remember a poore handfull of dispised men, whom they had thought to have swallowed up before them&#146;  (Tibbutt, 11). Later in 1645 he fought at Burroughbridge and Bath in Somerset and at the siege of Bristol, where he was captured by the royalist garrison but released after the city's surrender. He was later present at the siege of Exeter.<br>
<br>During the upsurge of political activism in the New Model Army following its victory in the first civil war, Okey's regiment was not one of the conspicuous centres of radicalism. While it did elect agitators in June 1647 it declined to appoint &#145;new agents&#146; a few months later and in December a number of the troops presented a loyal address to the commander of the army, Thomas Fairfax. During the second civil war in 1648 Okey and his regiment served in south Wales and took part in the battle of St Fagans and the siege of Pembroke Castle. At the end of that year he entered London with Thomas Fairfax. Okey was named one of the commissioners for Charles I's trial; subsequently he attended most of the court's sittings and signed the king's death warrant [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. He was one of the army officers charged with overseeing the arrangements for the subsequent execution.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1649 Okey and his regiment were among the soldiers loyal to the high command who pursued the mutinying Leveller troops through the Thames valley before defeating them at Burford in Oxfordshire. Okey was subsequently awarded an honorary MA degree by Oxford University for his part in their suppression. The same year he attempted to remove from his regiment one of his captains, Francis Freeman, whom he believed upheld Ranter beliefs and whom he accused of singing bawdy songs. Freeman's men backed their captain and the matter was eventually brought before Cromwell, who prevailed upon Freeman to resign his commission. Freeman subsequently outlined his version of events in the pamphlet <span class="italic">Light Vanquishing Darkness</span>.<br>
<br>Okey travelled to Scotland in 1650 and remained in service there under first Cromwell and later Monck until the end of 1651. In August 1651 he arrested several Scottish commissioners who were raising forces near Glasgow and he subsequently took part in the siege of Stirling, the storming of Dundee, and the occupation of Aberdeen. He returned to England in late 1651 or early 1652 and in February 1652 presented a petition to parliament calling for a number of religious reforms, including measures to propagate the gospel and reform the parochial ministry. The following August he was one of the officers who presented to the Rump Parliament the army petition which called upon it to proceed quickly with a range of constitutional and legal reforms. When Cromwell forcibly expelled the Rump in April 1653 Okey's regiment subscribed to the army <span class="italic">Remonstrance</span> supporting the action, but Okey himself was critical of the methods used by the lord general and from that point on he became increasingly suspicious of him. At the end of 1653 he firmly opposed the &#145;Instrument of government&#146; which established the protectorate, and throughout the remainder of the 1650s he displayed a consistent republican outlook, resisting all efforts to impose a more conservative, monarchical constitution upon the country.<br>
<br>Okey returned to Scotland in the spring of 1654 and subsequently accompanied Monck on his sweep through the highlands the following summer. In September 1654 he was returned to the first protectorate parliament as MP for Linlithgow, Queens Ferry, Perth, Culross, and Stirling. He refused, however, to take the engagement to the &#145;Instrument of government&#146; which was imposed upon the members by Cromwell a few days after the opening of parliament, and as a consequence was prevented from sitting. He began instead to attend secret meetings of those opposed to the instrument, and in October 1654 he helped to draw up <span class="italic">The Humble Petition of Several Colonels of the Army</span>, a document which was highly critical of Cromwell and the protectorate and called for the summoning of a free parliament. For this breach of army discipline he was arrested in November 1654, tried by court martial, and condemned to death. His sentence, however, was commuted by Cromwell, and he was instead cashiered from the army.<br>
<br>Okey retired to Bedfordshire, where he had acquired substantial crown property during the early 1650s, including the honour of Ampthill, the manor of Millbrook, Brogborough Park and Lodge, and lands at Leighton Buzzard. He also owned a share of Newmarket House, Cambridgeshire. The combined value of the properties was about &pound;8000. As the Long Parliament had settled upon him lands in Scotland worth &pound;300 per annum, he was by now a wealthy man. He also owned a residence known as Barbers Barn at Hackney in Middlesex, as well as the lease of a number of tenements in Old Street, London, belonging to St Bartholomew's Hospital, of which he was a governor. He lived both at Hackney and at Brogborough Round House in Bedfordshire during the 1650s, and was active as a JP in both Bedfordshire and Middlesex, and as an ejector of scandalous ministers in the former county. He was also probably involved in the establishment of John Bunyan's Baptist church in Bedford in 1653.<br>
<br>In July 1656 Okey was summoned before the council and questioned about his attendance at secret meetings in London called by the government's Fifth Monarchist and republican opponents. He was released with a warning and the following month was decisively defeated in the poll in Somerset for the second protectorate parliament. In early 1657 he strongly opposed parliament's plan to make Cromwell king and signed <span class="italic">The Humble and Serious Testimony of Many Hundreds of Godly People in the County of Bedford</span>, a petition against the move organized by the Bedfordshire gathered churches. During 1657 he attended a number of the republican meetings convened by John Wildman at The Nonsuch inn in Bow Street, London, and in April of that year was again arrested and held for several days after the government discovered that Thomas Venner and his Fifth Monarchist followers were planning an armed insurrection.<br>
<br>Following the death of Oliver Cromwell in 1658 Okey was elected to Richard Cromwell's parliament for Bedfordshire. After Richard Cromwell's resignation and the fall of the protectorate, the republican members of the returned Rump reappointed him to the command of a regiment. At the end of 1659 he supported the Rump in its quarrel with Lambert and Fleetwood, but his new regiment refused to follow him against them and he was subsequently dismissed from his post by the council of army officers. He remained opposed to the army leadership and in early December was involved in a failed attempt to seize control of the Tower of London, after which he took refuge with the fleet. When the Rump was recalled for a second time later that month, Okey once more recovered his commission and on 26 December he was appointed one of the seven parliamentarian commissioners responsible for the running of the army. The following day he attempted forcibly to prevent the readmission of the secluded members to parliament, an action for which he and several other officers were subsequently charged with assault. In February 1660 Monck again dismissed him from the army, handing his regiment over to Colonel Rossiter. The following month a scurrilous ballad, <span class="italic">Colonel Okie's Lamentation, or, A Rumper Cashiered</span>, was published and circulated in London. Fearing that Monck intended to bring about the return of the Stuarts, Okey settled his differences with Lambert and joined him in his attempted <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>. He was with Lambert when he was captured at Daventry but managed to escape himself.<br>
<br>At the Restoration Okey fled to Germany with Sir John Barkstead. In 1661, however, he travelled to the Netherlands where, along with Barkstead and Miles Corbet, he was arrested by the English ambassador, Sir George Downing, and sent back to England. Downing's action was widely regarded as treacherous, as he was a former associate of Okey and had acted as a chaplain to his dragoons. Following a brief trial Okey was executed on 19 April 1662. Three of his letters from prison and his scaffold speech and prayers were published that year in <span class="italic">The Speeches, Discourses and Prayers of Colonel John Barkstead, Colonel John Okey and Mr Miles Corbet</span>. He died professing his belief in the rightness of his actions and his commitment to Congregationalism, and declared that he was confident that<blockquote>that cause which we first took up the sword for, which was for righteousness and for justice and for the advancement of a godly magistracy and a godly ministry (however some men turned [it] about for their own ends), shall yet revive again. (<span class="italic">Speeches, Discourses and Prayers</span>)</blockquote>On the grounds that Okey had shown remorse for his involvement in the death of Charles I, and had advised those attending his own execution to submit peaceably to the Stuarts, Charles II initially agreed that Okey's mutilated corpse could be returned to his widow, Mary, for burial. The funeral was to have taken place at St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney, but when the government learned that a large crowd was expected to attend, it changed its mind and Okey was interred instead within the Tower of London.<br>
