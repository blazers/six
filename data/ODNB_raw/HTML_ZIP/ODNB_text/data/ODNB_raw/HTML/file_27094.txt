<span class="headword">Taylor,  William Cooke</span>  (1800&#150;1849), <span class="occ">historian and journalist</span>, born at Youghal, co. Cork, on 16 April 1800, was the son of Richard Taylor, a manufacturer, and a member of a family resident at Youghal from the time of the settlement by Oliver Cromwell. His mother was Mary Cooke, a descendant of John Cook, the regicide. He was educated by Robert Bell DD, at a school in Youghal, and then went to Trinity College, Dublin, which he entered on 13 January 1817. At the beginning of 1820 he removed his name from the lists, but replaced it in June 1821 to stand for a scholarship. He was unsuccessful in the competition, and returned to Youghal as an assistant at his old school.<br>
<br>After a short time Taylor returned to the university, and graduated BA in 1825. While at college he won prizes for compositions in prose and poetry, and in 1825 and 1826 he won several of the primate's prizes for Hebrew. His first essays in print were some contributions, carefully concealed in later years, to a newspaper in Cork. His first book was <span class="italic">A Classical Geography for Use of Youghal School</span>. He then edited several of the catechisms of William Pinnock and the various histories that had been compiled by Oliver Goldsmith.<br>
<br>In 1829 Taylor settled in Camden Town, London, and set up as a writer. His considerable energy and wide knowledge equipped him well for his role, and he was much more than the mere journeyman author that his list of publications at first glance suggests.<br>
<br>Taylor, unusually for his time, combined the writing of substantial histories with astute social and economic observation of the contemporary scene, which remains of interest and importance. Unfortunately, the sharp analytical approach of his observation of factory life in Manchester is largely absent from his histories, in which analytical intentions are blurred by narrative.<br>
<br>Between 1829 and his death Taylor wrote sixteen historical works, many of them in several volumes. Although holding a generally whiggish view of progress, he was especially interested in interruptions to it, as is shown in his <span class="italic">History of the Civil Wars in Ireland</span> (2 vols., 1831; Taylor believed that civil war was the constant feature of Irish history until 1800, when, he thought, the union abolished it) and <span class="italic">The Revolutions, Insurrections, and Conspiracies of Europe</span> (2 vols., 1843). His work often discussed what he considered to be the disruptive force of Islam, and his <span class="italic">History of Mohammedanism</span> (1834) went into several editions and was translated into German in 1837. His manuals for students on ancient history (1836) and modern history (1838) were standard works, the latter revised by C. D. Yonge and G. W. Cox and still used at the end of the century. Taylor stressed the historical significance of geography: <span class="italic">The World as it is</span> (3 vols., 1849&#150;53), whose compilation Charles Mackay assisted, was an attempt at a new and comprehensive system of modern geography. Taylor supplemented this sturdy output with works on India (1842), the fall of the Roman empire (1836), <span class="italic">Memoirs of the House of Orleans</span> (3 vols., 1849)&#151;a work that irritated Louis-Philippe&#151;and many editions of classical and modern texts, including Homer, Cicero, Plutarch, Swift, and Bacon. Among many other works, Taylor published <span class="italic">The National Portrait Gallery</span> (4 vols., 1846&#150;8).<br>
<br>Taylor wrote for <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> from 1829 until his death. On the foundation of the British Association in 1831, he became one of its leading members and was often on its statistical committee. He was interested in inventions and wrote <span class="italic">An Account of the Electro-Magnet Engine</span> (1841). He quite frequently returned to Ireland and became friendly with Richard Whately, archbishop of Dublin, to whom several of his works are dedicated and who often quoted them, especially Taylor's anonymous letters published as <span class="italic">The Bishop</span> (1841). Having toured a number of French schools in 1846, he supported Whately's educational policy in his <span class="italic">Notes of a Visit to the Model Schools in Dublin</span> (1847).<br>
<br>Taylor was a strong free-trader. Prompted by Richard Cobden, he travelled in the industrial north and concluded that great industrial cities were the pattern of the future, not a passing aberration. He strongly opposed factory regulation and believed urban destitution was the result not of low wages but of rural incompetents who over-optimistically came to the towns. An early member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42282', "Anti-Corn Law League")</script>, he edited its newspaper, <span class="italic">The League</span>, from its move to London in 1843. His articles gave the paper a historical dimension, with comments, for example, on the Roman corn laws. He published several pamphlets which are important accounts of the &#145;factory system&#146; (as he called it). His book <span class="italic">Notes of a Tour in the Manufacturing Districts of Lancashire: Letters to the Archbishop of Dublin</span> (1842) was secretly financed by the league. Taylor's <span class="italic">Life and Times of Sir Robert Peel</span> (3 vols., 1846&#150;8) is an interesting presentation of Peel from the league's point of view and the first of the various substantial studies of that prime minister.<br>
<br>Some expected Taylor to be the first president of Queen's College, Cork, but he was not. After the repeal of the corn laws in 1846, C. P. Villiers, the prominent free-trader, got his brother Lord Clarendon, lord lieutenant of Ireland in the whig government, to give Taylor a post as statistical writer to the Irish government. He also wrote for the government's Dublin paper, the <span class="italic">Evening Post</span>, and wrote pseudonymous tracts, including <span class="italic">Reminiscences of Daniel O'Connell. By a Munster Farmer</span>. In the late 1840s he was involved in agitating for the further extension of the franchise.<br>
<br>Taylor's ability was recognized in his LLD from Trinity College, Dublin, conferred on 7 July 1835. In September 1836 he married, at Cork, Marianne, only daughter of John Taylor of Youghal. He died of cholera at 20 Herbert Street, Dublin, on 12 September 1849 and was buried at Mount Jerome cemetery. He was survived by his wife, three daughters, and a son, Richard Whately Cooke-Taylor of Glasgow.<br>
