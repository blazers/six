<span class="headword">Wilford,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1706&#150;1747), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was apparently the stationer apprenticed for seven years to the London bookseller George Sawbridge, on 4 February 1706; this might locate his birth date about 1689. Wilfords are well represented in the seventeenth-century book trade, but John's precise family connections remain obscure. He opened a shop at the Three Flower de Luces in Little Britain about 1715, the year in which he entered <span class="italic">The Memorial of the Church of England</span> in the Stationers' Company's register, but his earliest surviving imprint dates only from 1719. It seems that he began as a retail bookseller and only later turned to publishing. All three titles in an advertisement of &#145;Books sold by John Wilford&#146; at the end of Clarendon's <span class="italic">History of the Rebellion &hellip; in Ireland</span> (1720) were printed for others, including two for George Sawbridge.<br>
<br>Wilford's most original production was the <span class="italic">Monthly catalogue, or, General register of books &hellip; printed or reprinted either at London or the two universities</span> (March 1723&#150;December 1729). Previous registers of new titles had been chiefly devoted to promoting the properties of the advertisers (like the <span class="italic">Term Catalogues</span>, 1668&#150;1711) or the publisher (like Bernard Lintot's <span class="italic">Monthly Catalogue</span>, 1714&#150;17), whereas Wilford's compilation is truly general, indiscriminate, and disinterested&#151;if not, inevitably, exhaustive. In 1730 the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> imitated the scheme in a regular monthly department and, to meet this competition, Wilford continued his catalogue as a department of the newly founded rival <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> (1731&#150;80). Wilford's <span class="italic">Monthly Catalogue</span> remains an indispensable bibliographical guide to the books of its period.<br>
<br>Beside the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, Wilford published or co-published other important periodicals: the <span class="italic">Daily Post Boy</span> (1728&#150;35), the <span class="italic">Grub Street Journal</span> (1730&#150;37), and <span class="italic">Fog's Weekly Journal</span> (1728&#150;37). These occasionally brought him into conflict with government authority&#151;particularly <span class="italic">Fog's Journal</span> and the foreign news reports featured in the <span class="italic">Daily Post Boy</span>. Other libels for which he was arrested were Swift's reflections on &#145;Sir <i>R[ober]t Brass</i>&#146; (that is, Walpole) and &#145;the Hirelings of St <i>S[tephen]s</i>&#146; in his <span class="italic">Epistle to a Lady who Desired the Author to Make Verses on her in the Heroic Style</span> (1734), and an advertisement of Pope's <span class="italic">Letters</span> (May 1735), naming the poet's titled correspondents (considered a breach of privilege).<br>
<br>A list of Wilford's publications may be found in the <span class="italic">Daily Courant</span> (7 January 1734). From 1731 to 1741 he published a number of titles in parts by subscription, of which the most interesting are two duodecimo volumes of <span class="italic">Select Trials &hellip; at the Sessions-House in the Old Bailey</span> (1734), covering some &#145;hair-raising varieties of crime&#146;  (Wiles, 207). This is the first <span class="italic">Newgate Calendar</span> and reprints or condenses not only the usual sessions paper and ordinary's account, but also some scarce ephemera. The emphasis is on the sensational and bizarre, but the facts are reliably reported; a reprint with two more volumes (not by Wilford) of a continuation appeared in 1742.<br>
<br>Wilford's last serial publication was <span class="italic">Memorials and characters, together with the lives of divers eminent and worthy persons (1600&#150;1740)</span>, published in twenty-six irregular monthly folio numbers from 1739 to 1741. It contains about 240 lives, one-third of them women's, compiled by the clergyman John Jones (<i>c</i>.1700&#150;1770) and others, chiefly from funeral sermons. The title-page announces that the compilers drew on &#145;above 150 different Authors, several scarce Pieces, and some original Manuscripts&#146;; there is an appendix of monumental inscriptions.<br>
<br>Wilford declared bankruptcy in 1735 and, though he continued business in Little Britain, published relatively little thereafter. His last imprint is dated 1747, and possibly he died soon afterwards. He is probably not the John Wilford of Southampton Street who died on 2 January 1764.<br>
