<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Massingberd, Sir  Archibald Armar  Montgomery-</span>  (1871&#150;1947), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born Archibald Armar Montgomery on 6 December 1871 in London, the second son of Hugh de Fellenberg Montgomery (1844&#150;1924), landowner and politician, of Blessingbourne, Fivemiletown, co. Tyrone, and his wife, Mary Sophia Juliana (May) (<i>d</i>. 1928), daughter of the Revd John Charles Maude, rector of Inniskillen and son of the first Viscount Hawarden. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64475/', "Hugh Maude de Fellenberg Montgomery")</script> was his brother. He added the name Massingberd to his own in 1926 when his wife, Diana Massingberd (1872&#150;1963), daughter of Edmund Langton, whom he married on 2 April 1896, inherited through her mother the Massingberd estates in Lincolnshire.<br>
<br>During his education at Charterhouse School and at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, Montgomery did not prove outstanding in any activity except horsemanship, to which he had a lifelong devotion. Yet he was from a &#145;good&#146; family background: tall, good-looking, charming, articulate, and persuasive. These characteristics stood him in good stead during his military career. He was commissioned into the Royal Field Artillery in November 1891 and served with it for most of the South African War of 1899&#150;1902, though he had a staff job in Cape Town for the last few months. He was present both at the British defeat at Magersfontein and at the Boer surrender at Paardeburg. During his war service Montgomery developed a strong reputation for being resilient in the face of adversity and a good improviser. His natural charm and careful diplomacy made him especially skilled in the handling of his superiors.<br>
<br>Montgomery's early war service seems to have inspired him to take a more serious, studious attitude to his profession. According to his own account it was reading, at this period in his life, the celebrated study of Stonewall Jackson by the military historian G. F. R. Henderson which inspired him to seek entry to the Staff College at Camberley. He joined that institution in January 1905. While there he formed a firm friendship with the commandant, Sir Henry Rawlinson. Rawlinson reported very favourably on Montgomery and the latter gained a series of staff appointments most beneficial to the advancement of his career. Their future careers were to be intimately connected.<br>
<br>In August 1914 Montgomery was an instructor at the Staff College. Shortly after the outbreak of war he was appointed a staff officer with the 4th division. Rawlinson took over this division on 23 September 1914, the previous commander having been injured during the battle of the Marne, and by then Montgomery was acting as its principal staff officer. A partnership between commander and his chief of staff was forged which, most unusually, was carried through several levels of command and lasted from this early stage in the war virtually to its end. When Rawlinson was promoted to command the 4th corps in October 1914, he managed to have Montgomery appointed his chief of staff, and Montgomery remained Rawlinson's principal staff officer when the latter was appointed to command the newly formed Fourth Army in February 1916. The chief of staff of an army was a job which carried the rank of major-general. After being an acting major-general for nearly a year, Montgomery was made substantive in that rank in January 1917, having risen from major to major-general in two-and-a-half years. It was a rate of promotion made all the more remarkable by the fact that Montgomery never held a field command in the First World War.<br>
<br>The Rawlinson&#150;Montgomery partnership was certainly close. Montgomery, however, was generally very discreet, content to remain a grey eminence. It is rarely possible to delineate with any clarity his particular role in planning and executing Rawlinson's military operations. Fourth Army's record in the Somme campaign of 1916 considered as a whole was very mixed and no senior officer serving in that headquarters can escape a share of responsibility for the catastrophe of 1 July 1916 with which it opened. But there is evidence that Montgomery had favoured a much more limited and cautious sort of attack than that which, under pressure from Haig and general headquarters, was finally adopted. Fourth Army did not play a major role in the operations of 1917. Its heyday was the final campaign of 8 August to 11 November 1918 in which, commencing with the battle of Amiens, it won a series of stunning victories, playing a greater role than any other allied army in forcing the Germans to sign the humiliating armistice of 11 November. Montgomery wrote a detailed account of these last battles, <span class="italic">The Story of the Fourth Army in the Battles of the Hundred Days</span> (1919), which some astute observers considered to be one of the finest works of military history to be produced in the immediate aftermath of the war.<br>
<br>After the armistice Montgomery served as chief of staff with the British army of occupation on the Rhine and subsequently became deputy chief of staff to Rawlinson while the latter was commander-in-chief in India. On his return from India he successively commanded the Welsh territorial division and the 1st division at Aldershot. As a lieutenant-general, in the late 1920s, he was in charge of southern command which included the Salisbury Plain area where pioneering exercises with mechanized forces were being held. Montgomery's temperament was conservative and he was somewhat sceptical about the ambition of radical officers in the Royal Tank Corps (RTC) to effect a revolution in the army's structure. In 1928 his influence helped terminate one series of experiments, though it was a series which had in any case largely run its course. He incurred during this period the deep and lasting hostility of the influential military journalist Basil Liddell Hart. Montgomery's historical reputation has suffered massively from Liddell Hart's distinctly prejudiced, exaggerated, and unfair portrayal of him, in influential books, as an archetypal military reactionary. Montgomery, however, continued to impress his superiors. He was promoted full general in 1930 and appointed adjutant-general in March 1931, becoming an army council member. In February 1933 he became chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) and in 1935 he was promoted field marshal. He never held a field command in war, and his role as Rawlinson's chief of staff in the Fourth Army (1916&#150;18) was, for the most part, exercised too discreetly to enable his role in decision making to be discerned. It is, therefore, on his performance as CIGS in the critical period 1933&#150;6 that his reputation must depend.<br>
<br>Although not an early advocate of independent armoured forces, Montgomery-Massingberd seems to have become a convert by the time he became CIGS, or very shortly afterwards. At this period he enjoyed good relations with the two most important advocates of armoured formations in the RTC: George Lindsay and Percy Hobart. He took the decision, in November 1933, to establish the 1st tank brigade as a permanent formation and gave great encouragement to its work, gaining glowing praise from Hobart, its commander. He followed this up in late 1934 with a decision to form the British army's 1st armoured division (initially called the mobile division) though this decision could not be implemented until after his retirement. He played a major part in the early planning of rearmament and was a strong proponent of making the British army ready to fight alongside the French against the Germans. Montgomery-Massingberd seems to have been a Francophile and strongly advocated maintaining close relations with the French general staff. Regarded by at least one reputable observer as the best CIGS of the inter-war period at putting the general staff's case in committee, he gained the agreement of the chiefs of staff and of Stanley Baldwin's government to prepare the regular army for a continental campaign, though the Territorial Army was not so lucky.<br>
<br>In a memorandum on the future organization of the British army completed on 9 September 1935, he advocated the preparation of a regular field force to be sent to the continent on the outbreak of war which would include four infantry divisions plus the mobile division, to be reinforced at intervals by rearmed divisions of the Territorial Army. The field force was to be very highly mechanized by the standards of the time, having enough lorries to lift an entire infantry division if required, as well as a large amount of armour. In addition to the mobile division, it was to have a light tank battalion attached to each infantry division for reconnaissance and screening. There were also to be army tank battalions (one per infantry division) consisting of heavily armoured tanks to assist the infantry in the assault. In the same document Montgomery-Massingberd demonstrated a good grasp of German operational methods, especially the use of airpower to facilitate deep penetration by a highly mobile land force.<br>
<br>Having, in his own view, laid a foundation for the army's rearmament, Montgomery-Massingberd decided to retire early in the spring of 1936 in order to make room for a younger man to execute the programme. He had been appointed CB (1918), KCMG (1919), KCB (1925), and GCB (1934). In retirement he resided at his country house at Gunby Hall, Spilsby, Lincolnshire. During the Second World War the lord lieutenant of Lincolnshire, who was attached to the Air Ministry, asked Montgomery-Massingberd to take charge of organizing and recruiting the Home Guard in Lincolnshire, work he undertook for nine months, at the end of which the lord lieutenant returned to the county and personally took command. Montgomery-Massingberd died on 13 October 1947, at Gunby Hall, leaving no children.<br>
