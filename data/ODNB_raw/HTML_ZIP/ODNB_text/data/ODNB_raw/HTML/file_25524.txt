<a name="IntheshadowofPhilipSidney"></a>In the shadow of Philip Sidney</h2>Robert Sidney received a first-rate humanist education. He attended Christ Church, Oxford, from 1575 to 1579, without graduating; he then departed on a tour of the continent that lasted&#151;with one interruption&#151;from 1579 to 1582. While he was travelling his brother Philip wrote him two famous letters of advice concerning his studies and activities. His primary base while he was abroad was Strasbourg, where Hubert Languet arranged for him to lodge with the famous pedagogue Johannes Sturm. But he also journeyed to the Low Countries, Germany, Prague, and Paris, making the acquaintance of many political leaders and scholars along the way.<br>
<br>On 23 September 1584 Sidney married Barbara Gamage (<i>c</i>.1559&#150;1621) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67993/', "Sidney, Barbara, countess of Leicester")</script>], the much-sought-after heir of the recently deceased John Gamage of Coety, Glamorgan. Forewarned by Sir Francis Walsingham that the queen was sending a message forbidding Barbara's marriage without royal approval, Sidney's friends hastily arranged a wedding ceremony that concluded only hours before the command arrived. His marriage to Barbara proved close and supportive, and produced eleven children, five of whom survived him, including the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30082/', "Lady Mary Wroth")</script>.<br>
<br>Sidney's father urged him to imitate his elder brother in all things, and Philip became a major influence on Robert Sidney's outlook and aspirations. The Sidneys aligned themselves with those at court, led by Leicester and Walsingham, who favoured an active English role abroad against Spain and Catholicism. In 1585 Elizabeth finally authorized armed intervention on behalf of the Dutch rebels and named Leicester the general of the English forces. Sidney accompanied the army as a captain and served in the Low Countries throughout 1586. He fought at the battle of Zutphen (22 September 1586), where Philip received the wound that eventually led to his death. On 7 October Leicester knighted Sidney for his bravery at Zutphen. Ten days later he was at his brother's bedside during his final hours, where Fulke Greville describes Robert as shedding abundant tears.<br>
<br>Philip's death made Robert the head of the Sidney family, their father having died six months earlier. Sidney inherited extensive properties but also extensive debts, and his need to advance his political career increased accordingly. Following Philip's death Sidney returned to England to settle the complicated family estate. During the Armada crisis in 1588 he attended the queen at Tilbury. As the Armada approached Elizabeth dispatched Sidney on an urgent mission to James VI to ensure Scotland's support against Spain. Although he had to disavow some promises made by the previous envoy, Sidney brought the mission to a successful conclusion. His charm and handsome appearance made a lasting impression on James, who thanked Elizabeth for sending him &#145;so rare a gentleman&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, ed. Bruce, 54). In 1589 Elizabeth named Sidney the governor of Flushing (Vlissingen), one of the cautionary towns the Dutch had granted England as security for the large loan Elizabeth had provided.<h2>
<a name="Flushingtheprotestantcauseandthecourt"></a>Flushing, the protestant cause, and the court</h2>This appointment seemed to launch Sidney on the first steps of a potentially glittering political career. In the event, however, the 1590s turned out to be a difficult and frustrating decade for him. The governorship of Flushing was a responsible position. The port had strategic military importance, and the town provided a useful listening post on the continent. But Sidney's duties in Flushing kept him away from the centre of power at the royal court. He campaigned relentlessly to obtain leaves from his post to return to England, but his political rivals tried just as vigorously to convince the queen that he needed to stay in the Low Countries. Sidney spent about half of the time between 1589 and the end of Elizabeth's reign in honourable isolation in Flushing, which significantly impeded his hopes of political advancement.<br>
<br>In addition the deaths of Leicester in 1588 and Walsingham in 1590 deprived the protestant internationalists of their leading champions. Sidney, along with many others in this camp, gravitated towards Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, and looked to his leadership; already in April 1588 Sidney had been created MA at Oxford alongside Essex and other members of his circle. Essex's patronage proved a dubious benefit to Sidney, however. Essex rose in Elizabeth's favour, but the rival faction around the Cecils was able to block significant promotions for most of Essex's friends and followers. In 1597 Sidney, who had already served in parliament for Glamorgan in 1584 and 1593, had the satisfaction of being elected senior knight of the shire for Kent over Sir William Brooke, the younger brother of his bitter enemy Henry Brooke, eleventh Baron Cobham. But other political successes were elusive. In 1597&#150;8 Essex tried energetically to gain Sidney a number of posts and promotions, including warden of the cinque ports, vice chamberlain, and promotion to a barony. But Essex's efforts all proved fruitless, and Sidney became increasingly despondent as the 1590s progressed.<br>
<br>During the periods when he was in Flushing Sidney administered the garrison, provided intelligence reports, and maintained relations with Dutch officials. In early 1594 Sidney went on an embassy to Henri IV of France, whose recent conversion to Catholicism had raised concerns in England. Sidney was able to gain reassurances from Henri about his intentions, and won the warm personal regard of the king. Sidney also developed a close friendship with Count Maurice of Nassau and sometimes joined him in the field against the Spanish, playing a significant role in the battle of Turnhout (24 January 1598).<br>
<br>Sidney's correspondence from the 1590s is a rich source for the period. When Sidney was in Flushing he received regular letters from his man-of-business Rowland Whyte, who provided vivid reports on developments at court and his activities on behalf of his master. Factional manoeuvring frequently produced situations rife with tension. As Whyte commented, &#145;It is a very hard matter to know who are frends now a daies&#146;  (Collins, 2.37). Sidney's own letters&#151;and those of his lieutenants, when he had permission to return to England&#151;depict the tedium and alarms of the protracted struggles in the Low Countries and France. Sidney emerges from this correspondence as a man who was well aware of the Machiavellian nature of court politics and was willing to fish in those waters, but who was also a dedicated and effective administrator. In addition he possessed a strong streak of personal honour&#151;for example, he indignantly refused a suggestion from the privy council that he offer a suspected Catholic spy a safe conduct in order to lure him to Flushing and then seize him, saying that such deceit would be unworthy of him.<h2>
<a name="TheEssexrebellionandJacobeanfortunes"></a>The Essex rebellion and Jacobean fortunes</h2>The same prudence and discretion that made Sidney a successful ambassador helped him survive the treacherous cross-currents at court towards the end of Elizabeth's reign. By the late 1590s Sidney was growing disillusioned about Essex's ability to help him. His position as Flushing's governor made it his duty to correspond regularly with Lord Burghley and Sir Robert Cecil, and he used this opportunity to stay on reasonably good terms with them. After Essex went to Ireland in 1599 Sidney distanced himself further from the earl and his circle. This proved fortunate, for it kept him from being implicated in Essex's disgrace after he returned without authorization from Ireland in September 1599. Sidney was at court on leave when Essex launched a desperate uprising on 8 February 1601. Sidney joined the hastily mustered forces that surrounded Essex House after the rising collapsed. As one of the few individuals who were trusted and respected by both sides, Sidney played a crucial role in preventing what could have been a bloody finale. He parleyed with Southampton and Essex, who addressed him as &#145;brother&#146; (Essex had married Philip's widow), and finally the two earls agreed to surrender. Even this service brought Sidney no significant reward, however.<br>
<br>When James VI of Scotland succeeded to the throne of England as James I in 1603 Sidney's fortunes finally began to change. James was sympathetic to former Essexians and still remembered Sidney's visit of fifteen years earlier. By this time, however, Sidney was forty years old, and he had already begun to focus his aspirations on status rather than political power. As early as 1598 Sidney had told Essex that if it came to a choice between the vice-chamberlainship and a barony, he would prefer the barony. No evidence exists that he campaigned vigorously for high office after James became king. On 13 May 1603 Sidney received the title of Baron Sidney of Penshurst, and shortly afterwards James named him lord chamberlain of the queen's household and surveyor of the queen's revenues. Because the queen's lord steward, Sir Robert Cecil, normally attended the king, Sidney was usually the presiding official at the queen's court, which limited his opportunities to influence the king. Sidney continued as governor of Flushing, but since he now rarely left England, his lieutenant executed those duties.<br>
<br>On 4 May 1605 James granted Sidney the title of Viscount Lisle. In 1613 Lisle joined the magnificent entourage that accompanied James's daughter Elizabeth, newly married to the elector palatine, to her new home in Germany. When financial exigencies led James to return Flushing to the Dutch in 1616 Lisle received an annuity of &pound;1200 per annum to compensate him for the loss of his governorship, and James also named him a knight of the Garter (he was installed on 7 July 1616). Lisle maintained his staunchly protestant and anti-Spanish outlook, and with his nephew William Herbert, third earl of Pembroke, and others who shared these views, he supported George Villiers as a counterweight against the Howards and Somerset. In 1618 he finally achieved one of his long-standing ambitions when James created him earl of Leicester, a title Lisle had long claimed as the closest legitimate heir of Robert Dudley. Leicester called his new title &#145;[the queen's] worck&#146;  (<span class="italic">De L'Isle and Dudley MSS</span>, 5.416), and he apparently did not pay for it. The timing&#151;only a few days after the earl of Suffolk's fall&#151;suggests that Villiers may have played a role too.<h2>
<a name="PoetryandPenshurst"></a>Poetry and Penshurst</h2>Leicester also had literary and scholarly interests. In the second half of the 1590s, when his political frustrations were at their greatest, he worked on a collection of poetry that included sonnets as well as other poems in a variety of metrical forms. The notebook containing them is the longest autograph manuscript by an Elizabethan poet that still survives and allows one to see the revisions and reorderings that he made in the sequence. An edition of these poems appeared in 1984. The collection has some resemblances to <span class="italic">Astrophel and Stella</span>, though the quality of the verse is uneven: the sonnets tend to be stiff, but some of the songs are lively and engaging. Starting around 1600 Leicester also began compiling several commonplace books on political topics, in which he organized episodes drawn from history into politically meaningful categories. These commonplace books, which give considerable attention to the problems that can afflict monarchies, form a link in the anti-absolutist political tradition of the Sidney family.<br>
<br>Leicester carried out major building projects at Penshurst, including a fashionable long gallery. He also maintained the stately aristocratic lifestyle there that Ben Jonson idealized in &#145;To Penshurst&#146;. Household accounts and an inventory of 1623 reveal the lavishness of the family's wardrobe and furnishings. As a result, while Leicester's income increased during James's reign, so did his expenditure, leaving him in chronic financial straits. In 1607 Leicester wrote despairingly to his wife, &#145;If my ill-willers should know in what state I were, it were subject enough for them to laugh at mee for ever&#146;  (<span class="italic">De L'Isle and Dudley MSS</span>, 3.432). In the end, however, he managed to avoid financial disaster, as he had avoided political disaster earlier.<br>
<br>In May 1621 Leicester's wife, Barbara, died. Early in 1626 he married Sarah Smythe, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Blount (<i>d</i>. 1655), the recently widowed third wife of Sir Thomas Smythe (<i>d</i>. 1625). Leicester died barely six months afterwards, at Penshurst Place on 13 July 1626, after falling suddenly ill in London. He was buried at Penshurst three days later. He died intestate, and was succeeded by his only surviving son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25525/', "Robert Sidney")</script>, who became second earl of Leicester.<br>
