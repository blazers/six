<span class="headword">Higgs,  Griffith <span class="st"> [Griffin]</span></span>  (<em>bap. </em>1589, <em>d.</em> 1659), <span class="occ">dean of Lichfield and book collector</span>, was born at Barre Place, Stoke Abbas, Oxfordshire, and baptized at St Andrew's Church, Stoke Abbas, on 28 October 1589. He was the third child and second son of Griffith Higgs (<i>d</i>. 1608), yeoman farmer, and of Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1602), daughter of Robert Paine of Caversham, near Reading. Higgs attended Reading School. William Laud, who had also been a pupil, was a fellow of St John's College, Oxford, when Higgs went there in 1606. While at St John's, Higgs gained a reputation as an orator and writer of Latin verses, including a manuscript verse biography of the college's founder, Thomas White  (St John's College, Oxford, MS L11, fols. 1&#150;25). He graduated in June 1610 and in 1611 was elected probationer fellow of Merton College, becoming MA in 1615. He was the college praelector in Greek and after his MA produced three theses (&#145;variations&#146;) in philosophy, philology, and ancient history. In 1620 he was awarded the college's Bickley exhibition, worth &pound;4 annually. During the period 1616 to 1625 he occupied in turn several college positions as tutor, bursar, dean, and senior proctor, &#145;tho' of little stature&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.481). In March 1625 the college offered him the living of Gamlingay in Cambridgeshire. Higgs spent some time there but had three sub-lessees; he resigned in 1630, officially because of his collation to the &#145;rich church&#146; of Cliffe-at-Hoo in Kent  (ibid.), but in fact he was then already in the Netherlands, as in 1627 the privy council had issued a passport to him.<br>
<br>In 1627 Laud was bishop of Bath and Wells but in touch with Oxford affairs, and Merton College also had connections with the court, which probably accounts for Higgs's name being put forward as chaplain to Elizabeth of Bohemia. While at The Hague, Higgs obtained his DD from Leiden, his work for the degree being published as <span class="italic">Problemata theologica</span> (1630), and he continued to study and teach, to maintain an academic correspondence, and to keep diaries, of which those for 1630, 1632, 1637, and 1638 survive. He also continued his undergraduate interest in amateur theatricals, an interest which he shared with Elizabeth of Bohemia. During this time he collected an extensive library. The court in The Hague had little to offer financially, but Elizabeth could use her influence to obtain preferment for her chaplain; probably by that means Laud (who had been bishop of St David's until 1626) gave Higgs the precentorship of that cathedral in 1631. In 1638 the queen wrote to Laud, following which Higgs secured the deanery of Lichfield and returned to England. His Netherlands diary ends on 20 September, when he was presumably already back in England, since he had a passport to return to the Netherlands in 1639 to collect his books. On Charles I's command Higgs became a chaplain-in-extraordinary in November 1638 and a chaplain-in-ordinary in July 1639. His precise ecclesiological position is uncertain. While Laud at his trial labelled Higgs a Calvinist, John Earle the essayist described a clergyman who was probably Higgs as a &#145;Protestant out of judgement not faction&#146;, and Higgs probably regarded himself as among &#145;conformable men of learning, and good life and moderation&#146;  (Morrish, 139).<br>
<br>Almost all the Lichfield records were lost during the civil war and it is difficult to discover how much time Higgs spent there, but a visitation by Archbishop Laud suggests that he had been sent to put in order a very unhappy state of affairs. In 1643 there were two sieges of Lichfield, of which a Latin account by Higgs survives, implying that he was in the close at the time. With it is a tribute to Prince Rupert as liberator of the cathedral close, and a note, &#145;Authore D. Griff. Higgs etc. Decano&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1646 Higgs was in Oxford when it surrendered to Fairfax. Later, he returned to Stoke Abbas, and died there, at Barre Place, unmarried, on 16 December 1659. He was buried in the chancel of St Andrew's Church, Stoke Abbas, on 19 December, and a mural tablet surmounted by a portrait bust and Higgs's coat of arms was erected there. The large inscription was written mostly by himself. In spite of sequestration by parliament Higgs died a rich man and in his will he gave benefactions to the church and poor of South Stoke, and &pound;600 for the maintenance of a schoolmaster there. In addition to bequests concerning gifts from the royal family at The Hague, he left money to buy books for the Bodleian Library and the libraries of Merton and St John's, and to fund both the librarianship and a divinity lecture at Merton. His own books, including the &#145;fair English <span class="roman">Bible</span> presented to him by the &#147;Winter Queen&#148;&#146;  (Morrish, 156), he left to Merton, where they became an important part of the college library. The books were to be collected from no fewer than eight different sources, and there proved to be more than 650 titles. His document outlining the duties of a librarian, accompanying his gift to Merton, was one of the first attempts to define the post in English, and important both for the college and for the development of the librarianship.<br>
