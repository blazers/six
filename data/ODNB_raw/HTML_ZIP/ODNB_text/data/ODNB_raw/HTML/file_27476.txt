<span class="headword">Tisdall,  William</span>  (1669&#150;1735), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland clergyman</span>, was born in Dublin, the son of William Tisdall, sheriff of Carrickfergus, and his wife, Anna. He entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 16 August 1688, where his tutor was Edward Smith, later bishop of Down and Connor. He became scholar in 1692, fellow in 1696, and obtained the degree of DD in 1707. Tisdall seems to have made the acquaintance of Jonathan Swift as early as 1695&#150;6, while the latter was at Kilroot, co. Antrim, during one of his estrangements from Sir William Temple. Swift sympathized with Tisdall's arrogant churchmanship and hatred of Presbyterians, and thought a good deal of his capacity as a preacher. He and Tisdall corresponded too on political questions, and were in agreement as to the desirability of passing a bill against occasional conformity by dissenters. These relations were abruptly changed in 1704, when Tisdall announced to his friend that he had designs upon the hand of Swift's companion, Esther Johnson (Stella). Swift replied in a letter dated 20 April 1704, in which rage and irony are apparent enough beneath the studied calmness which he affected. The episode was very soon over but Swift never got over his grudge against the &#145;interloper&#146;. When he wanted a contemptuous epithet for Richard Steele he called him a &#145;Tisdall fellow&#146;. Tisdall consoled himself by marrying, on 16 May 1706, Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1736), daughter of Hugh Morgan of Cottlestown, co. Sligo.<br>
<br>In 1706 Tisdall became vicar of Kerry and Ruavan, co. Antrim. He was appointed rector of Drumcree, co. Armagh, on 29 November 1711, and was admitted vicar of Belfast in the following year. His reputation as a controversialist was already considerable in the north of Ireland. His ironical <span class="italic">A Sample of True-Blew Presbyterian Loyalty, in All Changes and Turns of Government</span> appeared in 1709; this was followed, in 1712, by his vigorous <span class="italic">Conduct of the Dissenters in Ireland</span>. Tisdall declared in jest (though the joke was not relished by Swift) that he had saved Ireland by this work, as Swift had saved England by his <span class="italic">Conduct of the Allies</span>. John McBride retorted in <span class="italic">A Sample of Jet-Black Prelatic Calumny</span>. Tisdall published two other small tracts before the dominion of the whigs was definitely established in 1715. After this he was silent. His relations with Swift became closer again after Stella's death, and he was a witness to Swift's will. Tisdall died on 8 June 1735 and was survived for just a year and a day by his wife. A son, William, became vicar of St James's, Dublin. He married Lady Mary, daughter of Chambre Brabazon, fifth earl of Meath.<br>
