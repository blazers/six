<span class="headword">Boyd,  Hugh  Macaulay</span>  (1746&#150;1794), <span class="occ">writer on politics</span>, was born Hugh Macaulay on 16 April 1746 in Ballycastle, co. Antrim, the younger son of Alexander Macaulay (<i>d</i>. 1766), barrister and member of the Irish parliament, and his wife, formerly Miss Boyd (<i>d</i>. 1782). After attending the Revd Thomas Ball's school in Dublin, in 1760, at the age of fourteen, he began his studies at Trinity College, Dublin, and completed them in 1765. At some point in the later 1760s, following the death of his maternal grandfather Boyd in 1765, Hugh Macaulay changed his surname to that of this grandfather and received a small bequest. In 1766 his father died intestate and his estate passed to his eldest son, leaving Boyd without an income. This lack of money reputedly led him to abandon his hopes of an army career and to opt instead for a legal training. He moved to London, but instead of pursuing a place at the bar, he appears to have concentrated on his social life, quickly becoming immersed in the fashionable society of the capital, where his chess and conversation skills made him popular. He was soon able to count Edmund Burke, Catharine Macaulay, David Garrick, John Wilkes, and Joshua Reynolds among his wide circle of acquaintances. Boyd also frequently attended parliamentary debates, and was noted for his ability to memorize speeches. In December 1767, already experiencing the financial difficulties that were to dog him throughout his life, he was fortunate enough to marry a young woman with money, Frances Morphy. His career as a political writer took off in 1776, when he returned to Ireland and published an address to the electors of Antrim from &#145;a Freeholder&#146;. Back in London, Boyd produced an edition of the earl of Chatham's speeches, and continued to write anonymous political material. In 1777 and 1778 he wrote pieces for the London newspapers in support of the nabob of Arcot, presumably hoping to secure his patronage. Writing on more general political matters, he sent letters to the <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span> signed &#145;Democrates&#146; and wrote for the <span class="italic">London Courant</span> as &#145;The Whig&#146; in 1779 and 1780.<br>
<br>At this point in his life, whether due to foolish generosity or an extravagant lifestyle, Boyd had spent his wife's fortune, and was forced to seek employment abroad. In 1781 he travelled to Madras in order to work for the East India Company under Lord Macartney. The following year he travelled to Ceylon on a diplomatic mission to the king of Candy. He met with little success in his negotiations, and was subsequently captured by the French on his journey back to Madras. Once freed, he returned to India and embarked again on a journalistic career, running the <span class="italic">Madras Courier</span> during 1792, and launching the <span class="italic">Indian Observer</span> and the <span class="italic">Hircarrah</span> in 1793. However, his activities were cut short in the following year, and he died in Madras, apparently penniless, on 19 October 1794, survived by his wife, a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3106/', "Hugh Stuart Boyd")</script>, and a daughter.<br>
<br>Hugh Boyd did not become famous until after his death, when a number of publications claimed that he was Junius, the pseudonymous writer of a series of letters to the <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span> between 1769 and 1772 that was highly critical of the government. The secrecy surrounding Junius's identity, and the vitriolic nature of the attacks, made unmasking the author a source of great interest among the British public, even as late as the early nineteenth century. In 1800 Lawrence Dundas Campbell, an associate of Boyd, published an edition of his works which identified Hugh Boyd as Junius. John Almon, who had edited the <span class="italic">London Courant</span> when it published Boyd's letters under the pseudonym of The Whig, agreed with Campbell, and claimed to have recognized Boyd's handwriting when reading original manuscripts of Junius's letters. However, despite the certainty of men like Campbell, Almon, and others, modern scholarship does not attribute much weight to their claims.<br>
