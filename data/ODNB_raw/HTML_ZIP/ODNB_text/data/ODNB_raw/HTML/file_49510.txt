<span class="headword">Denison,  William</span>  (1713/14&#150;1782), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, born in Leeds, was the eldest son of John Denison of Old Hall, Great Woodhouse, near Leeds. He was a member of a prolific cloth-making and merchanting clan which produced four of the wealthiest commercial dynasties in late Georgian Yorkshire. Indeed the Denisons were so numerous in Leeds that compilers of genealogies and biographical notes thoroughly confused their origins and relationships. Taylor wrote despairingly (although it induced little caution): &#145;even to the present time the name of Denison is nearly as common about Leeds, as Smith in London, or Jones in Wales, or Campbell in Scotland, though it is rarely met with in other parts of her Majesty's dominions&#146;  (Taylor, 231). William and his two brothers, Robert (1719/20&#150;1785) and Matthew (1725&#150;1758), also merchants in Leeds, were the descendants of a long line of Great Woodhouse cloth makers, although their father had probably become a merchant. Certainly they boasted more prosperous kinsmen: Sir Thomas Denison (1699&#150;1765), justice of the king's bench, and the merchant brothers Thomas (1687&#150;1757) and Robert Denison (1689&#150;1766), the latter mayor of Leeds in 1727 and 1737.<br>
<br>Almost all the evidence about William Denison's extraordinary success in becoming the senior partner of the largest and most prosperous merchant house in Georgian Leeds comes from the end of his life and is derived from two letter-books covering the years 1779&#150;81 and the testamentary papers of him and his brothers. His schooling and early career are obscure. He was probably educated at Leeds grammar school and doubtless served an apprenticeship in the Leeds cloth trade. He first came to prominence in the 1750s, when he refused to serve the office of mayor of Leeds on no fewer than four occasions (he had been elected to the corporation in 1750). The corporation brought a case at York assizes in 1759, settled on condition that Denison agree to pay its costs and his brother Robert act in his place. The correspondence of his last years reveal him to have been an awkward, outspoken, and influential man, immensely shrewd, immensely proud of his vast wealth and northernness. His fortune, largely self-made, appears to have been based on the export of Yorkshire cloth primarily to the Italian market. Clearly it was already substantial by the late 1750s, when he began to buy land on a large scale, a passion which by the 1770s left him with many thousands of acres scattered across Yorkshire, Durham, Lincolnshire, and Nottinghamshire.<br>
<br>Certainly Denison's interests were never confined to the cloth export trade. A reference in the <span class="italic">Leeds Intelligencer</span> (3 October 1773) suggests he joined Sir George Colebrooke, the well-known London banker, MP, and chairman of the East India Company, along with Josiah Smith, in a city merchant partnership. However, since Colebrooke was on the verge of bankruptcy, his affairs stretched by well-published raw material speculations, it seems unlikely that Denison would have been unwise enough to make any attempt to rescue him. If he did join him in 1773, he emerged unscathed. By the end of the 1770s, when the Mediterranean trade was at a standstill, he was dealing extensively (and unprofitably) in annuities for some of the more extravagant members of the aristocracy, buying government stock (grumbling mightily about Lord North and those government insiders who scaled down his sizeable applications&#151;&pound;12,000 in 1780, &pound;20,000 in the following year), and threatening to sell some of his landed property because the returns on it were inferior to those he could make in the funds.<br>
<br>In 1779 Denison served office as high sheriff of Nottinghamshire with great reluctance, claiming he never spent more than a fortnight a year on his Ossington estate. On all his properties he was an exacting landlord and a keen agricultural improver, revealing a good knowledge of up-to-date farming practices and woodland management. Although he appears to have visited them each year, he was firmly based in Kirkgate, Leeds, in a house surrounded by the bustle of an industrial town, with his work and packing shops crowded into the yard behind. Short on public spirit, he was generous to the poor. In the winter of 1775&#150;6 he provided the poor of Kirkgate with thirty loads of corn and 400 corves of coal.<br>
<br>Denison's brother Robert seems to have possessed a more civilized veneer. He furnished Ossington from the best London cabinet-makers; he entertained smart shooting parties there; he was painted by Francis Coates for a life-size portrait. Neither William nor Robert Denison married, and when the latter died in 1785 their enormous fortunes&#151;the Leeds newspapers estimated William's to have been in the range of &pound;500,000&#150;&pound;700,000&#151;passed principally to their young nephew John Wilkinson, the son of their only sister, Anne. Her husband, also John, is variously described as a dyer, packer, and London factor. His direct involvement in the Leeds firm is unclear, although he clearly benefited enormously from the fortunes of his Denison brothers-in-law, and sat to Gainsborough for a full-length portrait. The younger John Wilkinson happily changed his name to Denison in 1785, settled at Ossington, brought up a large family, and sent his nine sons to Eton. They were a byword in Victorian England for their achievements&#151;a speaker of the House of Commons (Viscount Ossington), a bishop of Salisbury, a governor-general of Australia (Sir William Thomas Denison), and &#145;three others, first-class men at Oxford&#146;  (Taylor, 230).<br>
<br>William Denison died at Bath on 11 April 1782 and was buried at Ossington. Under the terms of his brother's will, two superb life-size statues of them both were erected in Ossington church (built by Robert to John Carr's designs). They were carved by England's leading sculptor, John Nollekens, at the enormous cost of &pound;921. The base of William's statue is a fine relief with a ship, wool bales, and sheep&#151;a fitting allusion to his life and riches.<br>
