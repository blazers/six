<span class="headword">Fitzgibbon,  Edmund  fitz John</span>, eleventh white knight  (<em>c.</em>1550&#150;1608), <span class="occ">chieftain and rebel</span>, was the second of three children of John Oge Fitzgerald, or Fitzgibbon, tenth white knight (<i>d</i>. 1569), and Ellen (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1579), daughter of Patrick Condon. He was born in Mitchelstown, co. Cork. Having spent many years abroad, Fitzgibbon returned to Clangibbon upon news of his father's death. He played a prominent role in James fitz Maurice's rebellion (1569&#150;73), however, and was attainted. With his ancestral lands declared forfeit, the white knight fled to France with fitz Maurice in March 1575, accompanied by his wife, Joan Tobyn, daughter of the lord of Cumshionagh, co. Tipperary. Yet he did not intend permanently to remain in exile and urged Thomas Butler, tenth earl of Ormond, &#145;to write in my favour to the queen, requiring her grace to accept me into her grace and to restore my country&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/50/21 (ii)).<br>
<br>The white knight was pardoned in May 1575 and, upon his return in July, received a lease of the preponderance of his father's lands. Some of these lands, however, were subsequently leased to James Roche, the landless and bastard son of Viscount Roche of Fermoy. This development aggravated the historic enmity that existed between the two families and contributed to James Roche's killing. The white knight was pardoned for Roche's death in January 1581 and had, following his mother's death, received a lease of his lands formerly leased to Roche. Yet his legacy was threatened by the reversion of his lease to Englishmen upon its expiration. Thus, while not playing a prominent role in the rebellion of Gerald Fitzgerald, fourteenth earl of Desmond, he doubtless winked at rebel activity until the outcome became clear. Following Desmond's death he accompanied Sir John Perrot, the new lord deputy, to Ulster on his expedition against Sorley Boy MacDonnell in 1584. Despite this most tangible demonstration of his loyalty he remained suspect and was arrested in April 1587 and imprisoned in Dublin. Government officials like Sir Henry Wallop, not content to wait for the white knight's lease to expire, moved to have him executed so that his lands might be distributed among English planters.<br>
<br>The white knight was spared execution, but remained a prisoner until the summer of 1590, when he received a warrant from the English privy council permitting him to travel to court. He pledged his loyalty to Elizabeth I and, in return, received a grant in tail male of all his lands held on lease. In practice the grant reversed his father's attainder and legitimized his position. He consolidated his power through the ruthless persecution of cadet branches and the marriage of his two sons, Maurice and John Fitzgibbon, and four daughters into prominent neighbouring families. He was appointed sheriff of co. Cork in 1596, achieving a notable success in defending the county from the MacSheehy clan. The white knight reluctantly surrendered the position in 1597 but was drawn into rebellion as violence swept across Munster the following year. Hugh O'Neill, second earl of Tyrone, dispatched a letter to him and deemed him to be his greatest ally in Munster after James fitz Thomas Fitzgerald, the <i>s&uacute;g&aacute;n</i> earl of Desmond. Yet the white knight's support for the rebellion was contingent on its success: the first display of English power saw him submit unconditionally to Sir George Thornton in May 1600. This behaviour did not go unnoticed; Sir George Carew noted before his submission, &#145;a more faithless man never lived upon the earth&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/207/6). Nevertheless the white knight, privy to the rebels' actions, proved a vital component in the uprising's suppression.<br>
<br>In May 1601 the <i>s&uacute;g&aacute;n</i> earl escaped into Clangibbon, co. Cork. The white knight's failure to apprehend Desmond earned him a sharp rebuke from Sir George Carew, the president of Munster, and gave his enemies leverage in their complaints against him. Threatened with expropriation, he quickly captured Desmond, who was hidden in a mountainous cave. Concerning Desmond's capture, Carew wrote that the white knight &#145;performed the same more in respect of his duty to her Majesty than for the benefit of the &pound;400 head money &hellip;; and for the doing whereof he was not ignorant to purchase himself the general malice of the province&#146;  (Brewer and Bullen, 1601&#150;3, no. 79).<br>
<br>The white knight's earlier involvement in the rebellion&#151;ironically confirmed by Desmond's confession&#151;was forgotten and on 12 December 1601 the queen declared her intention to restore him to his lineage. By this time he had married Joan MacCarthy, daughter of the lord of Muskerry, with whom he had two sons, who died young. James I conferred on him the title of baron of Clangibbon in July 1604, but no parliament met and this was not confirmed. The white knight died, probably at Old Castletown on 23 April 1608, perhaps of disease. He was buried in a tomb in Kilmallock, co. Limerick, on 30 April with his eldest son, Maurice, who had died the previous day. His grandson Maurice Fitzgibbon succeeded, but he died in adolescence and his estate passed to his sister Margaret and through her to her husband Sir William Fenton.<br>
