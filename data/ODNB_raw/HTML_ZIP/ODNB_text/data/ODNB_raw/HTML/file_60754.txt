<span class="headword">Ponsonby, Sir  Henry Frederick</span>  (1825&#150;1895), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the eldest son of the six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22493/', "Major-General Sir Frederic Cavendish Ponsonby (1783&#150;1837)")</script> and his wife, Lady Emily Charlotte, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bathurst (<i>d</i>. 1877), and was born on 10 December 1825 on the island of Corfu while his father was inspecting field officer there. He was educated by a tutor in Geneva and then at a school in Coombe Wood, Kingston. He was at Sandhurst from 1839 to 1841. At the age of fifteen he attended the annual Waterloo banquet and he was from an early age well connected in London society. He became ensign in the 49th foot in December 1842 and lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards in February 1844. In 1846 he became aide-de-camp to his uncle, Lord Bessborough, lord lieutenant of Ireland. His calm and discreet nature equipped him well for attendant duties and he stayed in Ireland in the same post with lords Clarendon and Eglington; he was also private secretary to Clarendon and to lords St Germans and Carlisle. He fought in the Crimea with the Grenadier Guards, commanding his men in trench warfare and being promoted lieutenant-colonel on 31 May 1855. Ponsonby held strong reforming views about the army and in army circles was regarded as a radical. In December 1856 he was appointed Prince Albert's equerry (perhaps as a result of their meeting during Albert's visit to Dublin in 1853), in which position he served until Albert's death in 1861. Though he had few duties beyond routine attendance he picked up Albert's reforming tendencies.<br>
<br>On 30 April 1861 Ponsonby married one of Queen Victoria's maids of honour, <a href="#cosubject_60754">Mary Elizabeth Bulteel [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Their marriage was exceptionally affectionate&#151;they wrote daily when apart&#151;and produced five children, including the author <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58450/', "Frederick Edward Grey Ponsonby")</script>. Ponsonby and his wife wrote jointly for the press, particularly the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, and he wrote on military matters as Sebastian; from 1869 he wrote for the <span class="italic">Naval and Military Gazette</span> as Major Quill, and for other periodicals.<br>
<br>Despite being made extra equerry to the queen when Albert died, Ponsonby's position in the 1860s was uncertain: he was partly at court, partly with his regiment (in Canada 1862&#150;3 and commanding its 1st battalion from 1864). This uncertainty was not resolved until he was appointed private secretary to the queen on 8 April 1870, a post he held almost until his death. He succeeded General Charles Grey, his wife's uncle. His appointment was controversial in court circles and was opposed by the duke of Cambridge, for Ponsonby was well known as an army reformer and a Liberal in politics. From 1878 he was also keeper of the privy purse and responsible for most aspects of the royal finances. He became KCB in 1879, GCB in 1887, and was sworn of the privy council in 1880 (on Disraeli's recommendation). He declined various other honours, including a peerage in 1880, offered him by the queen to match the ennoblement of Disraeli's secretary, Montagu Corry.<br>
<br>Ponsonby became private secretary just when the queen became unpopular. His early years in the post were spent working with W. E. Gladstone, as prime minister, to persuade her to be more visible to her subjects and more conveniently available to her ministers, an endeavour in which they had only modest success. As Victoria grew older she became, especially after 1874, predominantly and often openly Conservative in her politics and isolated and lonely in her life at court. Ponsonby became an indispensable link both with prime ministers (except Disraeli, whose letters went directly to the queen) and with the queen's children, who used Ponsonby as an intermediary on the many subjects on which they were too frightened to approach their mother directly. He worked well with all the queen's prime ministers after 1870, though his closest relationship was with Gladstone, who wrote to him on retiring in 1894: &#145;you are &#147;to the manner born&#148; and such a combination of tact and temper with loyalty, intelligence and truth I cannot expect to see again&#146;  (Gladstone, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 5 March 1894). He disliked many of Disraeli's politics, both foreign and domestic, but their personal relations were cordial; Disraeli commented: &#145;Perhaps I am a gainer by his Whiggishness as it makes him more scrupulously on his guard to be always absolutely fair and lucid&#146;  (Monypenny &amp; Buckle, 5.210).<br>
<br>Politically, Ponsonby's chief contribution was to filter the queen's correspondence with Gladstone, which during the latter's four premierships became, on her side, increasingly intemperate. Ponsonby, Gladstone, and Lord Granville co-operated to prevent other members of the Liberal cabinet knowing the full extent of Victoria's anti-Liberal vehemence. Ponsonby's phlegmatic character and dry wit were ideal for this exercise in damage limitation. His role was to serve, but on occasion Ponsonby acted on his own, notably in January 1886 when&#151;the queen's efforts to engineer a coalition led by G. J. Goschen faltering&#151;he cut the knot by visiting Gladstone at bedtime and verbally conveying the queen's commission to form a government. This was, however, a rare initiative. For the most part, Ponsonby saw his task as that of defending the queen from herself. He was also looked to by the rest of the court and the royal family to limit the influence of John Brown, the queen's increasingly drunken highland servant, and, after Brown's death, the Munshi Hafiz Abdul Karim, the queen's Indian servant. With Randall Davidson and Lord Rowton, he was successful in persuading Victoria not to publish the memoir of Brown which she drafted after his death in 1883; Ponsonby destroyed the memoir and Brown's diaries. In his later years he was helped by Sir James Reid, the queen's physician, who shared many of his views (Reid later married Susan Baring, Mary Ponsonby's niece).<br>
<br>Ponsonby received few thanks at court for what Arthur Bigge called his &#145;entire effacement of <i>self</i>&#146;. Victoria complained to him of his lack of enthusiasm for Conservatism, and members of the court used him as something of a political whipping boy, especially during the Eastern question in the late 1870s (on which Ponsonby was strongly Gladstonian and during which the prince of Wales tried to persuade the queen to replace Ponsonby with Montagu Corry) and home rule for Ireland in the mid-1880s (on which Ponsonby was mildly Liberal Unionist in inclination). His family was a vital source of sustenance to him in a job aspects of which he strongly disliked, especially the long spells at Balmoral (sometimes six months in the year), where Ponsonby had to co-ordinate a quarrelsome household, which at times of friction communicated almost entirely by letter, most of the correspondence going via the queen's secretary. He disliked highland sports and on return from another residence wrote &#145;Every private house strikes me as so comfortable after the severe dreariness of our palatial rooms here&#146;  (<span class="italic">Henry Ponsonby</span>, 116).<br>
<br>Despite his difficulties and his wife's increasingly odd position at court, Ponsonby never seems to have considered alternative employment or retirement. He derived satisfaction from the flow of business and from serving the aged queen. He and his family lived in the Norman Tower at Windsor, with apartments in or cottages near Osborne House and Balmoral. He had a stroke at Osborne Cottage, Isle of Wight, on 6 January 1895, resigned as private secretary in May, and died there on 21 November 1895. He was buried at Whippingham church, near Osborne, the duke of Connaught representing the queen. In his last years he was assisted as secretary by his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58450/', "Frederick Edward Grey Ponsonby (1867&#150;1935)")</script>, later created Baron Sysonby and a secretary of Edward VII.<br>
<br>Ponsonby was a tall, striking man with blue eyes, a beard, a slight stoop, and a deep voice. He was known for scruffy dressing&#151;the queen and the prince of Wales both complaining about his ugly trousers&#151;and it was often found that his uniform was in some respect incorrect. His casual appearance emphasized sartorially his more general difference from most other members of the court. Whether Ponsonby's careful disguising of the true character of the Victorian court was in the long run a service to the monarchy is hard to judge. He and Gladstone tried but failed to persuade the queen to integrate the prince of Wales into governmental procedures, and Ponsonby had little success in guiding the monarch in the direction he would have preferred. But he enabled the queen almost to complete her reign without a major scandal and he was influential in helping to train a new generation of royal secretaries, notably Arthur Bigge. His biography, by his son Arthur, is one of the best accounts of the Victorian court.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_60754"></a><span class="headword">Mary Elizabeth Ponsonby <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bulteel]</span></span>, Lady Ponsonby  (1832&#150;1916), <span class="occ">courtier and advocate of women's advancement</span>, was born at Yealmpton, Devon, where she was baptized on 19 October 1832, the second child and eldest of three daughters of John Crocker Bulteel (1793&#150;1843), squire and master of foxhounds at Flete, Devon, who sat as whig MP for South Devon from 1832 to 1835, and Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Grey (1797/8&#150;1880), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11526/', "Charles Grey, second Earl Grey")</script> and prime minister. She was linked to whiggery in her youth by her mother's family. Intensely religious as a young woman, she was friendly with Pauline Craven, a prominent Roman Catholic, but remained a member of the Church of England, within which she was initially strongly of a high-church inclination, even contemplating joining a sisterhood. In later life her religious opinions broadened, and she was accused of freethought and atheism. She was appointed a maid of honour to the queen on 17 March 1853, retaining the post until her marriage to Henry Ponsonby in 1861 (she broke a previous year-long engagement to William Vernon Harcourt in October 1854).<br>
<br>Mary Ponsonby was a member of the committee which from 1863 planned the foundation of Girton College, Cambridge, and was a member of the college from 1872 until her death. A prize there was given in her memory by her family. Throughout her life she supported the advancement of women, especially in the professions, and was active with Jessie Boucherett on one of the committees for the employment of women which flourished in the 1870s. Her political opinions, informed by wide reading in philosophy, became increasingly liberal; her younger daughter, Magdalen, described her as becoming &#145;a disciple of George Eliot and Herbert Spencer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mary Ponsonby</span>, xviii). She wrote extensively for <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span> and other periodicals. Her liberalism&#151;more pronounced and more publicized than her husband's&#151;made her position at court uneasy: Victoria suspected her (rightly) of both &#145;cleverness&#146; and &#145;advanced views&#146;, and (wrongly) of unduly influencing her husband's opinions, but none the less appointed her an extra woman of the bedchamber after her husband's death. Mary Ponsonby found a more sympathetic character and friend in the queen's eldest daughter, the Empress Frederick of Germany, who shared her intellectual interests. In later years, her close friends included the composer Ethel Smyth and A. C. Benson. Her progressive views were a profound influence on her children, particularly <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35566/', "Arthur Ponsonby")</script>, who was later a Labour MP, and her daughter Magdalen. She died at her home, Gilmuire, Ascot, on 16 October 1916.<br>
