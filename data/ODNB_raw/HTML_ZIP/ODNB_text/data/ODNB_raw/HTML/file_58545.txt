<span class="headword">Gilchrist,  (Andrew) Rae</span>  (1899&#150;1995), <span class="occ">physician and cardiologist</span>, was born on 7 July 1899 at the manse, Holywood, co. Down, Northern Ireland, the only son of Andrew Gilchrist (1871&#150;1954), Presbyterian minister, and his wife, Catherine Hill, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Witherow (1879&#150;1955). His parents were Scottish. He was educated at George Watson's Boys' College in Edinburgh, Campbell College in Belfast (1913&#150;16), and the University of Edinburgh (1917&#150;21), where he qualified in medicine. He became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh when only thirty, and received a gold medal for his MD thesis in 1933.<br>
<br>After junior appointments at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, the Princess Elizabeth Hospital for Children, London, and a year at the Rockefeller Hospital in New York, Gilchrist was appointed to the consultant staff of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh in 1930 at the early age of thirty-one. In those days this was the ultimate aim for an ambitious young clinician. Gilchrist always said that he was lucky because three more senior physicians had died before the age of fifty. This early security permitted him to develop his lifelong interest in heart disease, leading to the establishment of a dedicated department of cardiology in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh in 1953. His particular interest was in cardiac arrhythmias, heart block, paediatric cardiology, and cardiac problems associated with pregnancy. He published many papers on these subjects.<br>
<br>In 1930 Gilchrist reported in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Medical Journal</span> the first seven cases of coronary thrombosis recorded in Europe. As an alert young physician, working in acute medical wards of the Royal Infirmary, this was his total experience of the previous four years. It was a seminal report, ignored by almost all his seniors&#151;most of whom had not heard of the condition or did not believe that it was compatible with survival. Recognizing that his contemporaries were excellent physicians and that it was unlikely that they would fail to make the correct diagnosis, Gilchrist was firmly of the view years later that coronary heart attacks (first described in 1911) were a new disease.<br>
<br>Gilchrist was the founder of cardiology in Scotland. During and after the Second World War, the Edinburgh clinical school of medicine was particularly strong, and possibly the leading teaching centre in Britain. Together with Sir Stanley Davidson, professor of medicine, and Sir Derrick Dunlop, professor of therapeutics, Gilchrist influenced the learning and clinical judgement of medical students and young graduates for more than thirty years. As a teacher he would brook no equivocation. An ambiguous answer, even if it concealed real doubt, to one of his commanding bedside questions would be met by scorn. This bred a discipline and orderliness of mind in his students, undergraduate or postgraduate, that few other teachers achieved. It also bred an extraordinary loyalty and respect from all who worked closely with him. He was a large and formidable figure, but magnanimity and humour were never far away.<br>
<br>Gilchrist was a founder member in 1959 of the British Heart Foundation. He recognized that the amount of money available for research into heart and circulatory diseases from official sources was very limited&#151;the Medical Research Council budget totalled about two-thirds of one per cent of the whole cost of the National Health Service, and the amount spent on heart and vascular disease did not exceed about &pound;50,000 a year. For these reasons the British Heart Foundation made an appeal directly to the public, and in the 1990s the sums accumulated allowed the expenditure of up to &pound;50 million per year on support for research into heart disease, with most directed towards coronary disease. One outcome of this was the establishment in 1986, with the University of Edinburgh, of the Duke of Edinburgh chair of cardiology.<br>
<br>Gilchrist welcomed new advances, though always with appropriate critical appraisal, and always with the question, &#145;Will this help my patients?&#146; He encouraged his young staff to develop new ideas, while strict in his assessments of their contributions: to be prolix was fatal, to vacillate was nearly as bad, and to dissemble in any way was unacceptable. However, when new ideas were being developed he was excited and gave all his considerable influence to their study. Although clinically oriented, Gilchrist recognized the need to encourage studies of clinical physiology and biochemistry, particularly into the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.<br>
<br>Gilchrist was president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh from 1957 to 1960 and was made an honorary fellow in 1990. He was also a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, London, from 1944. He was appointed CBE in 1961 and received many other honours worldwide. He retired in 1964, ironically after a major coronary thrombosis, but survived another thirty years&#151;an unusually long survival, which Gilchrist himself had thought impossible when he was in active consultant service. He was married twice: first, on 16 September 1931, to Emily Faulds Slater (1906&#150;1967), younger daughter of W. Work Slater, of Edinburgh and Innerleithen, Peeblesshire, with whom he had one son and one daughter; and secondly, on 27 September 1975, to Elspeth Martin Wightman, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Scott (1904&#150;1995), widow of his colleague Arthur Wightman. He died at his home, 16 Winton Terrace, Fairmilehead, Edinburgh, on 1 March 1995, and was cremated at Mortonhall crematorium, Edinburgh, on 4 March. He was survived by his son and daughter, and by his second wife, who died on 27 June 1995.<br>
