<span class="headword">Milward, Sir  Anthony Horace</span>  (1905&#150;1981), <span class="occ">airline executive</span>, was born in Feckenham, near Worcester, on 2 March 1905, the son of Henry Tomson Milward, a needle manufacturer, and his wife, Elsie Newton. He was educated at Rugby School and at Clare College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>After leaving university, Milward joined the Manchester textile merchants Glazebrook Steel &amp; Co. in 1926, instead of entering the family firm, Milward Needles of Redditch. In 1927 he was sent to India and worked for a year in Calcutta, with shorter spells in Madras, Bombay, and Karachi. In 1929 he returned to Manchester, and became a director of Glazebrook Steel in 1930. He married Frieda Elizabeth Anne (<i>d</i>. 1984), daughter of the merchant Gustav Adolf von der Becke in 1931. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Milward learned to fly under the Civil Air Guard scheme and acquired his &#145;A&#146; pilot's licence in 1939. In 1940, at the age of thirty-five, he joined the Fleet Air Arm. He remained on flying duties throughout the Second World War, serving in Trinidad on anti-submarine and convoy protection sorties. In 1943 he was made lieutenant-commander, and was given command of the naval section of the radar experimental airfield at Defford in Worcestershire, testing airborne radar and night-flying equipment. In 1945 he was made an OBE.<br>
<br>At the end of the war, with a successful business career and wartime flying experience behind him, Milward relinquished his interests in the textile industry, and began a new career in civil aviation. After a brief period at the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), in April 1946 he joined the state-owned British European Airways (BEA), as general services manager, and became general manager of continental services shortly afterwards. In 1952 he became controller of operations at BEA, and in 1956 was appointed chief executive by the chairman, Lord Douglas of Kirtleside. Finally, in 1964 he succeeded Lord Douglas as BEA's chairman, a position he held until his retirement in 1970. He was made a CBE in 1960 and knighted in 1966.<br>
<br>Milward devoted twenty-five years' service to BEA, and although he was not as well known as his predecessor, Lord Douglas, he must be credited with a large share of the responsibility for BEA's success as an effective, and largely profitable, European flag-carrier. His business experience, combined with his technical background, was of great value in the management of the corporation, as was his quiet determination, and sense of leadership.<br>
<br>Convinced that BEA should make profits, and that nationalized industries should be commercial enterprises in public ownership, Milward spent a considerable amount of time battling with ministers and officials in the 1960s, a period when the nationalized industries were experiencing a high degree of government involvement. He was less inclined to continue Lord Douglas's rigid preference for British-built aircraft, and showed greater concern for the operating economics of new types acquired by BEA. A notable instance occurred in 1966 when BEA sought to abandon its British-only procurement policy, and buy the American Boeing 727 aircraft. The government refused to allow this purchase, and its insistence that BEA use the inferior Hawker Siddeley Trident Three instead, led to the payment of substantial compensation to the airline. On other occasions, however, Milward did seek to encourage the British aircraft industry. With the move to wide-bodied aircraft, he pleaded unsuccessfully for the development of the British Aircraft Corporation Three-Eleven jet, warning in 1969 that failure to do so would mean the demise of a major civil aircraft manufacturing industry in Britain; it is ironic that a very similar project to the Three-Eleven later reached fruition as the European Airbus A-300.<br>
<br>After his retirement from BEA, Milward was chairman of the London Tourist Board from 1971 until 1976, and thereafter its president. He died at Moore Cottage Hospital, Bourton on the Water, on 12 May 1981.<br>
