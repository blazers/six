<span class="headword">Harpur,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1577), <span class="occ">judge and law reporter</span>, was the son or grandson of Henry Harpur of Rushall, Staffordshire, son of the MP John Harpur (<i>d</i>. 1464). He came to the attention of Sir John Port (<i>d</i>. 1540), justice of the king's bench, at whose instance he was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1537 from Barnard's Inn. Not long after Port's death he married Jane, daughter of Sir George Fynderne and Elizabeth Port (the judge's daughter), and thereby acquired estates in Derbyshire, where he settled at Swarkestone. He was closely associated with the younger John Port in various transactions, and referred to him in his will as &#145;my deare frend&#146;.<br>
<br>Harpur's vacation practice was chiefly in Derbyshire and Staffordshire, though he was also connected with Port's native city of Chester and became an alderman there. In 1543 he acquired the clerkship of assize on the Oxford circuit in succession to John Port the younger, and held that office until he took the coif. He was elected a bencher of the Inner Temple in 1552, and two years later autumn reader, becoming a serjeant-at-law at the first general call of Elizabeth I's reign in April 1559. He was well known as a reporter of cases in the common pleas from at least the 1550s until the 1570s, and his reports survive in numerous manuscripts. The texts associated with Harpur commonly begin in 1546, though with respect to the first twelve years or so it has proved difficult to separate his work from that of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7025/', "William Dalison (d. 1559)")</script>.<br>
<br>On 18 May 1567 Harpur was appointed a judge of the common pleas in succession to Sir Anthony Browne, and he also followed Browne on the northern circuit. He made his will on 9 July 1576. After ten years as a judge, he died on 29 January 1577; he was buried in accordance with his testamentary wishes in Swarkestone church, where there is a full-length recumbent alabaster effigy in judicial robes and collar of SS&#151;a distinction apparently still sometimes worn by puisne justices&#151;with his wife lying beside him, and a ribbon between their hands inscribed &#145;Cogita mori&#146; (&#145;Think on dying&#146;), the motto of his mourning rings. Besides Swarkestone Harpur left a farm at Milton and extensive estates in Derbyshire and neighbouring counties. His libraries at Swarkestone and Serjeants' Inn were divided between his sons John and Richard. John (<i>d</i>. 1622), the eldest, was member of parliament for Derbyshire in 1597 and 1604, and knighted in 1603; John's son Henry was created a baronet in 1626. The seventh baronet assumed the additional surname of Crewe.<br>
