<span class="headword">Wrottesley,  George</span>  (1827&#150;1909), <span class="occ">army officer and antiquary</span>, born at 5 Powys Place, London, on 15 June 1827, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30089/', "John Wrottesley, second Baron Wrottesley (1798&#150;1867)")</script>, a landowner and astronomer, and Sophia Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1880), third daughter of Thomas Giffard of Chillington Hall, Staffordshire. He was educated at the Blackheath proprietary school. After entering the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in 1842, he obtained a commission in the Royal Engineers in 1845. He was ordered almost immediately to Ireland to assist with famine relief work, and in 1847 was transferred to Gibraltar, where he remained until 1849. In 1852 he joined the Ordnance Survey. He took part in the Crimean War, and sailed for the Dardanelles on survey work in January 1854. On the 7th of the same month he had married Margaret Anne, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4014/', "Sir John Fox Burgoyne")</script>. With Sir John, he went on a mission to the Turkish general Omar Pasha. He afterwards became aide-de-camp to General T. B. Tylden, the officer commanding Royal Engineers in Turkey, and in this capacity he accompanied Lord Raglan to Varna. He was engaged at Varna on plans and reports on the Turkish lines of retreat from the Danube, when he was struck down by dysentery and fever, which later caused complete deafness. In October 1854 he was invalided home and promoted to captain. On Sir John Burgoyne's return from the Crimea to the War Office in 1855 as inspector-general of fortifications, Wrottesley was appointed his aide-de-camp, and he stayed with the field marshal, acting continually as his secretary on commissions and confidential adviser until Burgoyne's retirement in 1868. He was secretary of the defence committee of the War Office from 1856 to 1860; secretary of the committee on the influence of rifled artillery on works of defence in 1859; and secretary of the committee on the storage of gun powder in magazines in 1865. In 1863, being then a major, he presided over the committee on army signalling which introduced the use of Morse code. He was made lieutenant-colonel in 1868, and on Burgoyne's retirement took over the command of the engineers at Shorncliffe. In 1872 he commanded at Greenwich, and in 1875 became officer commanding Royal Engineers at Woolwich, before retiring from the army in 1881 with the honorary rank of major-general.<br>
<br>Wrottesley collected and edited <span class="italic">The Military Opinions of General Sir J. F. Burgoyne</span> in 1859 and published <span class="italic">The Life and Correspondence of Field Marshal Sir J. Burgoyne, Bart.</span> (2 vols.) in 1873. But his principal literary interest lay in the history of his ancestral county, Staffordshire, and, more especially, in the genealogies of its principal landed families. He was active in the campaign that led to the establishment in 1872 of the William Salt Library at Stafford to house the antiquarian collections of William Salt. In 1879 he founded with Robert William Eyton and others the William Salt Archaeological Society, now the Staffordshire Record Society; its principal aim was &#145;the editing and printing of original documents relating to the county of Stafford&#146;. Wrottesley was honorary secretary from 1879 until his death. He contributed prolifically to the society's volumes, its <span class="roman">Collections for a History of Staffordshire</span>. Five of his contributions, including full-scale histories of the families of Bagot, Giffard, Okeover, and Wrottesley, were republished separately. In his <span class="italic">Pedigrees from the Plea Rolls</span> (1905) he reprinted material he had previously published in <span class="italic">The Genealogist</span> and <span class="italic">The Reliquary and Antiquary</span>.<br>
<br>Wrottesley was one of the founders of the modern school of genealogy, basing family histories firmly on record evidence, exploding long-held genealogical myths, and using the legal and financial records of central government systematically to explore genealogical and political connections and personal motives unmentioned by narrative sources. John Horace Round, a great admirer and correspondent of Wrottesley, whom he remembered fondly as &#145;the Nestor of genealogists&#146;, said of him in an obituary notice &#145;no genealogist, perhaps, could claim with better reason that he placed truth foremost&#146;. Wrottesley had, too, that other virtue of the new school, the ability to use family history and political history to illustrate each other. After Wrottesley's first wife died childless on 3 May 1883 he married, on 21 February 1889, Nina Margaret, daughter of John William Philips of Heybridge, Staffordshire. Wrottesley died at his home, 75 Cadogan Gardens, London, on 4 March 1909, and was buried in the Wrottesley vault in Tettenhall church, Staffordshire, on 8 March. His second wife, who survived him, was also childless.<br>
