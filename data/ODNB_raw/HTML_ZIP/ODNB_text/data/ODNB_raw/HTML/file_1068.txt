<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Baillie,  Robert, of Jerviswood</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1684), <span class="occ">conspirator</span>, was the son of George Baillie of St John's Kirk, Lanarkshire, of the Lamington Baillies, and the nephew of the covenanter leader, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14933/', "Archibald Johnston of Wariston")</script>. Of presbyterian principles, he was, according to his cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4061/', "Gilbert Burnet")</script>, &#145;a man of great piety and virtue, learned in the law, in mathematics, and in languages&#146;  (Burnet, 2.354). He married Wariston's daughter, Rachel Johnston, with whom he had nine children. He was first in trouble with the Scottish authorities in June 1676, when he was found guilty of riot for helping his brother-in-law, the presbyterian field preacher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15679/', "James Kirkton")</script>, escape arrest. An informer named Captain William Carstairs had accosted Kirkton in the High Street in Edinburgh and requested that he go back to Carstairs's lodgings to visit a sick person who had asked to see him. Once Carstairs had Kirkton in his custody, however, he informed his victim he had a warrant against him which he would execute if he did not give him money. When Carstairs proved unable to produce the warrant a scuffle ensued, upon which Baillie and some others, who had heard about the minister's plight and had come to see if they could be of assistance, burst through the door and made Carstairs release his prisoner. The next day, however, Carstairs managed to procure a back-dated warrant, which he then produced when the case came before the council board. Baillie was fined &pound;500 sterling and remanded in custody until payment was made. A review of his case led to his release in December and a remittal of the unpaid portion of the fine, although Carstairs had already managed to collect 3000 merks (&pound;105) from Baillie as his informer's reward.<br>
<br>Baillie ran foul of the Scottish authorities again following his refusal to take the bond of 1677, requiring all landlords and masters to guarantee that their tenants and servants would not attend conventicles. He was subsequently charged with lawborrows (that is, required to take out a bond himself to keep the peace), and was put to the horn in March 1678 when he refused to comply. Charles II's decision to cancel the bond and lawborrows in April, however, meant that no further action was taken.<br>
<br>Concern for the security of the people's &#145;Laws, Liberties, and the Protestant Religion&#146;  (Sprat, 93) led to Baillie getting mixed up in the so-called Rye House plot of 1683, the alleged conspiracy involving malcontents in England, Scotland, and Ireland either to assassinate the king and the Catholic heir (the future James II) or to launch an insurrection to force Charles II to accede to their demands. Baillie was among a group of Scottish dissidents who went to London in April 1683, ostensibly to discuss setting up a Scottish colony in Carolina, but in reality to lay plans for co-ordinated uprisings in England and Scotland, to be led by the duke of Monmouth and the earl of Argyll respectively. Burnet recalls that Baillie told him that he believed &#145;the obligation between prince and subject was so equally mutual, that upon breach on the one side the other was free&#146;, and that the recent injustices in London, culminating in the <i>quo warranto</i> proceedings against the charter, were enough to set the people &#145;at liberty to look for themselves&#146;, although he supposedly &#145;confessed things were not ripe enough yet&#146;  (Burnet, 2.354). Nevertheless, he appears to have begun negotiating with the English dissidents for funding for Argyll's invasion force, asking initially for &pound;30,000, though agreeing to the &pound;10,000 which the English claimed was the most they could raise. In the end, no money materialized, and Baillie grew disillusioned by the foot-dragging of the English, exclaiming at a meeting with his fellow Scottish conspirators that they had &#145;too long been the dupes of a set of men who could do nothing but talk&#146;, but that this &#145;was no reason why the Scots should desist&#146;, adding that &#145;if they were successful, it would not be the first time that England owed its liberty to the imposition of the Scots&#146;  (M'Cormick, 14). The consensus of the meeting, however, was that they should tell the English that they would not act in concert with them unless they showed more vigour, and at the same time inform their friends in Scotland to stop any further steps being taken towards an insurrection.<br>
<br>Baillie was arrested in London on 26 June 1683, following Josiah Keeling's disclosure of the Rye House plot. When examined by the English authorities, Baillie protested his ignorance of any assassination plot, though he refused to answer questions about the insurrection. He was kept in irons in the Gatehouse and grew so physically incapacitated that he was barely able to move. His wife petitioned Charles II to allow him to be released on bail on account of ill health, though to no avail, and at the end of October the king ordered Baillie to be sent to Scotland, where he languished in prison for several more months. When Baillie at last received a citation to appear before the Scottish council in September 1684 to answer charges against him, he protested that he was too sick to be moved, so the clerk-register was sent with a list of questions to put to Baillie on oath in his prison cell. Baillie refused to answer on the grounds that &#145;he was not bound to accuse himselfe&#146;  (Roger Morrice ent'ring book, p. 441) and was fined &pound;6000. As Baillie's health continued to deteriorate, the Scottish authorities deemed it desirable to establish his guilt before he died in custody, and so brought him to trial on 23 December on charges of treason. His conviction was secured only after a confession, which was wrought from William Carstares under torture and should therefore have been inadmissible as evidence, was read in court; the prosecution claimed the confession was read as an &#145;adminicle of proof&#146;, that is, not to serve as evidence against the accused, but merely to convince the jury that the testimony of the witnesses against the accused could be believed. Baillie was sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered the following day, 24 December. Sir John Lauder of Fountainhall, one of the lawyers for the prosecution, recalled that Baillie &#145;carried all this with much calmenes and composure of mind&#146;, only complaining that &#145;the tyme they had given him to prepare himselfe for death was too short&#146; and huffing a little that he should be thought &#145;guilty of any designe against the life of the King, or his Brother&#146; or the monarchical government; he failed to purge himself, however, of that part of the indictment relating to the planned uprising, which &#145;looked like a tacit confession and acknowledgement theirof&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historical Notices</span>, 593). Baillie's estate, worth some 8000&#150;9000 merks per year and unencumbered by any debts, was forfeited to the crown, but subsequently transferred by act of parliament in June 1686 to the duke of Gordon (whose predecessors had previously owned the lands in question). Baillie's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64094/', "George Baillie (1664&#150;1738)")</script> fled to the Netherlands following his father's execution, only to return with William of Orange in 1688. He was restored to the family estates following the revolution.<br>
