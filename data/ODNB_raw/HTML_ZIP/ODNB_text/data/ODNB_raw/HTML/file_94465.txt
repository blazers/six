<span class="headword">Turri,  Nicholas  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1270/71), <span class="occ">justice</span>, came from Dorset, where his family's principal estates were at Berwick and Starthill, both between Abbotsbury and Bridport. His parentage is not entirely clear. His father may have been the Gregory de Turri recorded in 1225 as holding half a hide of land in the manor of Swyre, Dorset, where nearly twenty years later Nicholas himself acquired half a hide and 2 acres of meadow. But although Gregory is known to have married a woman named Emma, a papal dispensation in 1258 shows that Nicholas was illegitimate. Consequently his exact relationship with John de Turri, described as his brother, and with Alice, said to have been his sister (and married to James of Dover), also remains unclear.<br>
<br>The dispensation of 1258 shows that at an unrecorded date Turri took orders, but the course of his career is recorded almost entirely in secular terms, as a royal servant. It has been suggested that because he later held land and acquired connections in Cambridgeshire, he may have owed his start in the king's service to Jeremy of Caxton, sheriff of Cambridgeshire (1232&#150;6) and later a justice <i>coram rege</i>. But this is far from proven, and he may also have had links to Hugh de Turri, the buyer for the royal wardrobe under Henry III. Nicholas is first recorded in early 1241, acting as an attorney in the court <i>coram rege</i>, and he is possibly to be identified with the &#145;N. the clerk&#146; who was serving as an official of that court at Michaelmas 1243. By mid-1245 he was certainly employed there as the king's attorney in a dispute concerning land in Hampshire. However it is not until the later 1240s that he becomes regularly visible. In 1248&#150;9 he was commissioned to hear assizes in Essex and Middlesex in association with Henry of Wingham; and although the first explicit reference to him as a king's clerk dates only from March 1252, he probably enjoyed that status by August 1250, when he was granted &pound;10 to maintain himself in royal service. In January 1252 he was granted an annual salary of &pound;40, after becoming a puisne justice in the court <i>coram rege</i> in the previous autumn. He continued to sit there throughout the 1250s, alongside such illustrious colleagues as Gilbert of Seagrave, Henry of Bratton, and Henry of Bath, and also took numerous assizes. In March 1256 he was appointed with Roger of Thirkleby to investigate the death of Hugh of Lincoln, the alleged child-victim of ritual murder by Jews in the previous year.<br>
<br>The wording and the date (10 October 1258) of the papal dispensation from illegitimacy, which was specifically granted to Turri &#145;that he may receive and hold a bishopric&#146;  (<span class="italic">CEPR letters, 1198&#150;1304</span>, 360), strongly suggest that Henry III planned to reward Turri's services through ecclesiastical promotion, and that the see in the king's mind was probably Lincoln, whose bishop, Henry of Lexinton, had died on 8 August. But by the time the indult was issued the canons of Lincoln had already elected Richard of Gravesend, and it may be a sign of King Henry's political weakness in the late summer of 1258 that he made no recorded effort to press the claims of his own candidate. As it was, Bishop Gravesend proved to be a staunch Montfortian. The fact that Turri appears to have fallen ill about this time may have been another reason for his failure to secure a diocese. However, he had recovered sufficiently by early 1260 to hold sessions in Oxfordshire and Berkshire of the special eyre set up after the crisis of 1258&#150;9 to redress grievances throughout the kingdom.<br>
<br>The death of Henry of Bath in November 1260 left Turri as the only justice sitting in the court <i>coram rege</i>. Between 1261 and 1263 he also served on nine eyres in central and eastern England, while in August 1262 he is recorded as one of the justices for the Jews. In April 1265, during the period of Simon de Montfort's ascendancy, Turri was still acting as a justice in the court <i>coram rege</i>; indeed, he and his colleague Ralph of Braham appear to have been responsible for keeping the court going in the turbulent months between the battles of Lewes and Evesham (May 1264 &#150; August 1265). He then served as senior justice <i>coram rege</i> from Michaelmas 1265 until Hilary 1268, prompting the comment that Turri was &#145;instrumental &hellip; in re-establishing the King's Bench after the troubles of the previous years&#146;, and that he has &#145;a better claim to be considered the first chief justice [<i>coram rege</i>] than his successor Robert Brywes, even though the title was never used of him&#146;  (Meekings, <span class="italic">Justices</span>). He presided as chief justice over another three eyres in 1268&#150;9, in Wiltshire, Norfolk, and Suffolk, as part of the last great visitation of Henry III's reign, but his death prevented his completing the circuit prescribed for him. He may have died late in 1270, and was certainly dead by 26 February 1271, when Simon of Coleshill, one of his executors, brought Turri's eyre rolls into the exchequer.<br>
<br>In addition to his family lands in Dorset, Turri had property in Essex, Cambridgeshire, Devon, and Hertfordshire. He had been building up his estates at least from the early 1240s, notably at Aythorpe Roding in Essex, where he began acquiring land early in 1244. And some time in the later 1260s he became rector of the Glastonbury living of Grittleton near Chippenham in Wiltshire, valued at &pound;10 per annum. Turri's heir was his putative brother John.<br>
