<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Geoffrey fitz Peter</span>, fourth earl of Essex  (<em>d.</em> 1213), <span class="occ">justiciar</span>, was the son of Peter, forester of Ludgershall, Wiltshire, under Henry II, and the younger brother of Simon, Henry II's sheriff of Northamptonshire, Buckinghamshire, and Bedfordshire. His mother's name was Matilda or Maud. The family was one of local royal officials who were minor landholders. In the survey of 1166 Geoffrey held lands of mesne lords: of Girard Giffard a knight's fee at Cherhill in Wiltshire, and, together with Hugh de Diva, another knight's fee of the countess of Clare, and a third of a knight's fee with the wife of Adam son of John son of Guy, held of Walter of Beck.<h2>
<a name="Royalservice"></a>Royal service</h2>Geoffrey made his way in royal service. In 1184 he accounted for the farm of Kinver before the itinerant justices in Oxfordshire. A year later he was sheriff and local justiciar of Northamptonshire, and he heard the pleas of the forest in an extensive circuit, while being custodian of Robert fitz Bernard's land at Newton in Berkshire and of Herbert fitz Herbert's manors in Surrey. He may have achieved this emergence into some prominence as the clerk of the royal justice Thomas fitz Bernard, whom he succeeded as guardian of the heir of Gilbert de Monte in the two hundreds of Sutton, Northamptonshire. At the same time he held the custodies of the land and heir of William de Chauz at Elton in Buckinghamshire and of Burton, Norfolk, which Roger Caperon held of Hugh, earl of Chester. More importantly, he was given custody of Saham in Norfolk which had belonged to William de Say, with the wardship of his two daughters. William's father had married Beatrice de Say, sister of Geoffrey de Mandeville, earl of Essex, and her granddaughter, another Beatrice, was the ward whom Geoffrey fitz Peter married in 1184 or 1185. She was coheir to the Mandeville barony, an extensive complex of lands across the East Anglian counties of Essex, Suffolk, and Cambridge, the neighbouring counties of Hertfordshire, Northamptonshire, and Buckinghamshire, and the counties of Surrey, Middlesex, Berkshire, and Warwickshire. The Mandeville honour owed the service of 113 knights in Henry II's time. Earl William de Mandeville was one of the justiciars whom Richard I appointed to rule England during his absence on crusade in 1189, but he died before the end of that year, leaving no children.<br>
<br>Geoffrey fitz Peter then claimed the barony in the right of his wife against her uncle Geoffrey de Say. The justiciar, William de Longchamp, at the wish of Say's grandmother Beatrice, awarded the barony to him for a relief of 7000 marks, which he failed to pay. For 3000 marks Geoffrey fitz Peter was then given the barony. He paid only &pound;200 at once, but received seisin of the lands and the third penny of the county of Essex, although not the title of earl. His wife died before April 1197 and was buried at Chicksand, later being transferred to Shouldham Priory, which Geoffrey fitz Peter founded as holder of the barony. He had become a great magnate in 1190, though he had already been rewarded for his service by Henry II with a knight's fee at Cherhill, the house of Master Thomas Brown in Winchester, four knights' fees that a previous justiciar, Richard de Lucy, had held of the honour of Boulogne, and four held of Earl Roger.<h2>
<a name="Asjusticiar"></a>As justiciar</h2>When Richard I became king in 1189, Geoffrey fitz Peter had taken a vow of crusade, but in the arrangements the king made in 1190 for the government of England Geoffrey was one of the named colleagues of the justiciar, as a baron of the exchequer and a royal justice. Consequently he was one of those whom the king, by papal permission, released from his vow. By 1190 he had sufficient administrative experience, and by his marriage baronial status, to be a prominent figure, side by side with William Brewer, Hugh Bardolf, and William (I) Marshal, among those left to serve as colleagues of the justiciar. He was one of those excommunicated for his part in removing Longchamp in 1191, but he became a colleague of the new justiciar, Archbishop Walter de Coutances, and he remained sheriff of Essex and Hertfordshire where many of his own lands lay. He was also an important colleague of Archbishop Hubert Walter, who became justiciar in 1193, and under whom royal administration showed marked innovation.<br>
<br>Under Hubert Walter's justiciarship Geoffrey's name appeared at the head of the justices before whom final concords were made at Westminster. With Hubert Walter he went on circuit in the midlands and East Anglia. Together they tallaged Norwich in 1198. He accompanied the justiciar on his Welsh expedition in the same year. And when Hubert resigned the justiciarship in July 1198, the king appointed Geoffrey as his successor, for by then he was a justice of considerable experience, who had begun his career in the days of Glanville when Henry II's assizes were being worked out. Indeed, he, as well as Hubert Walter, has been suggested as the author of the treatise on the laws which bears Glanville's name. Geoffrey had had similarly long experience as a baron of the exchequer, and as a local royal officer. Like William Marshal he had become a great magnate by marriage. When, on Richard I's death, there was discussion, and perhaps doubt, about the succession, Geoffrey was said to have secured the barons' allegiance for John at a council at Northampton in 1199; and at John's coronation feast he was girded with the sword of earl.<br>
<br>As justiciar Geoffrey fitz Peter was at first in the shadow of Hubert Walter who, although archbishop of Canterbury, became the new king's chancellor at the beginning of the reign. Nevertheless, when John was in France, before the loss of Normandy in 1204, and when he was in Ireland in 1210, government ran in Geoffrey fitz Peter's name as regent. He presided over the exchequer, and was the authority to whom the barons looked for instruction even when the king was in England. From 1200 a scutage was levied almost annually, and in 1202 and 1203 the money raised by tallages, and the profits of justice, went through the exchequer audit in the same year, which suggests that he was making a determined attempt to collect and deliver as much as he could as quickly as possible. In 1204 he was himself sheriff of seven counties, with other curial officers holding other shrievalties, which points to a reorganization of the exchequer machinery, under the justiciar's supervision.<br>
<br>As a justice Geoffrey was no less active. He organized three eyres in the later summer and early autumn of 1199, and himself led the justices who visited Warwickshire, Leicestershire, and Northamptonshire. In 1202 there was a general eyre, as extensive as those of 1194 and 1198, and he led the justices in Surrey, Kent, Berkshire, Wiltshire, Hampshire, and Sussex. He regularly presided over the bench at Westminster, and in his absence pleas were adjourned for consultation with him, even though there had emerged a group of regular and experienced justices who could maintain the legal fiction of the justiciar's presence.<br>
<br>While Hubert Walter remained chancellor until 1205, it is not certain how much he or Geoffrey fitz Peter was the driving force behind royal administration. Some scholars have spoken of Walter's &#145;genius&#146; as distinct from Geoffrey's &#145;competence&#146;. Matthew Paris uses the same unreliable story of both men at their deaths. Of Geoffrey he has the king say: &#145;when he arrives in Hell, let him greet there Hubert Walter, whom no doubt he will find&#146;  (Paris, <span class="italic">Chron</span>., 2.559); but in another work he transfers his sentiment to Hubert Walter: &#145;by God's feet, now at last I am king and lord of England&#146;  (Paris, <span class="italic">Historia Anglorum</span>, 2.104). There is no evidence that Geoffrey was anything other than a loyal servant who furthered the king's interests in the administration of justice and finance, and also served him as a soldier, when he campaigned against the Welsh in 1206 and 1210. The king's presence in England after the loss of Normandy, the disappearance of chancery enrolments between 1210 and 1212, and the cessation of pleadings in the bench after 1210, give the appearance of a diminished role for the justiciar, but there is no evidence of royal distrust of him, nor of a breach between them. The justiciar could always have been dismissed, but Geoffrey held his office until his death.<h2>
<a name="Wealthanddeath"></a>Wealth and death</h2>After the loss of Normandy he had, indeed, been rewarded by the king. He was granted the castle and honour of Berkhamsted at a fee farm of &pound;100 p.a. in May 1205, its income being &pound;400 p.a., with the right of succession to the children of Geoffrey and his second wife, Aveline. The honour included twenty-two knights' fees held of the honour of Mortain. Geoffrey had married Aveline before 29 May 1205; she was the widow of William de Munchensi; of Swanscomb, Kent, and Gooderstone, Norfolk, and a daughter of Roger de Clare, earl of Hertford. Geoffrey also received from the king a significant part of the lands forfeited by Normans, being granted those of Robert fitz Ernis which included the manors of Hatfield Peverel and Depden in Essex, and other land in Norfolk and Suffolk, in all worth over &pound;100 p.a. In 1208 he was given Queenhithe, and fairs and markets at his manors of Kimbolton and Morton, and in the same year he had custody of the land and heir of Werresius de Valognes. In 1211 his offerings to the king of 30 marks and two Norwegian hawks for the land of Jordan de Ros, and of 20 marks and a palfrey for the land and heir of William of Streetly, were accepted. The only indication of any strained relations with King John comes from 1212, when the king allowed Geoffrey de Say to claim the Mandeville barony in his court, but the case was not determined. Two of the sons of Geoffrey fitz Peter and Beatrice de Say were married to the two daughters of Robert Fitzwalter, who was prominent among the king's baronial enemies, but the Mandeville barony descended in turn to both Geoffrey and his brother William as earls of Essex in succession to their father, both of them dying without heirs. Geoffrey fitz Peter's third son of his first marriage, Henry, was a clerk, while his daughter Maud married Henry de Bohun, earl of Hereford. With his second wife, Aveline, who survived to a date between 22 November 1220 and 4 June 1225, Geoffrey had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38271/', "John fitz Geoffrey")</script>, who succeeded to Berkhamsted. Geoffrey himself died on 2 October 1213, but his burial place is unknown, though he had founded Shouldham Priory, Norfolk, before 15 June 1198, and a hospital at Sutton de la Hone, Kent, and was a benefactor of the hospital of St Thomas of Acre in London.<br>
