<span class="headword">Corbett,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1751), <span class="occ">secretary of the Admiralty board</span>, was the eldest son of William Corbett (<i>d</i>. 1699), a barrister at the Middle Temple, London, and Eleanor Jones, third daughter of Colonel John Jones of Nanteos, near Aberystwyth. After attending Westminster School he is recorded on 24 March 1704 as serving unofficially as an ordinary seaman on board the <i>Ranelagh</i>, the flagship of Rear-Admiral George Byng. This was the start of a close association with Byng that was to take Corbett to the secretaryship of the Admiralty board. The <i>Ranelagh</i> was part of the allied fleet in the Mediterranean during 1704 and was present at the successful attack on Gibraltar and the battle of Malaga (13 August). On 14 December Corbett was rated as Byng's clerk and four days later moved with Byng to the <i>Barfleur</i>. Corbett continued to move with Byng as his clerk and on 29 December 1705 he was appointed his secretary. On 8 November 1709 Byng was appointed to the Admiralty and on 6 December Corbett became Admiral Matthew Aylmer's secretary on board the <i>Royal Sovereign</i>, where he remained until 19 October 1710. Corbett resumed his career with Sir George Byng, now admiral of the white, when the latter took over command in the channel in July 1711, and joined him as his secretary on board the <i>Cumberland</i> on 22 July.<br>
<br>Byng returned to shore in September 1711 and Corbett was discharged on 28 December. Early in 1712 Corbett went to Utrecht to try to obtain a post among the diplomats who were gathering for the preliminary peace negotiations. A particular opportunity arose in March, with rumours of a vacancy of secretary to Thomas Wentworth, third earl of Strafford, the chief English plenipotentiary for the peace negotiations, but by August, Corbett was disappointed. All the while he reported his progress back to Byng. The disappointment was made worse on 30 September 1712 when Strafford became first lord of the Admiralty and, as the political crisis around the succession mounted, Byng was dismissed from the Admiralty commission on 19 January 1714.<br>
<br>After the Hanoverian succession Byng returned to the Admiralty on 14 October 1714 and Corbett was appointed a clerk to the board on 17 January 1715. Corbett maintained a close attachment to Byng. In a fulsome dedication to his translation of Michelet's <span class="italic">Mediterranean Pilot</span>, published in 1715, Corbett called Byng &#145;the best of friends&#146; and he accompanied the admiral on the summer operations during the Jacobite rising. In 1716 Corbett was appointed secretary of Greenwich Hospital. Byng, who after 1718 was styled Viscount Torrington, left the Admiralty on 30 September 1721, but Corbett kept his post. Torrington was treasurer to the navy and probably played an important role in advancing Corbett to the post of chief clerk on 15 March 1723, despite the general convention of seniority. After the accession of George II, Torrington returned to the Admiralty in the commission appointed on 2 August 1727. The post of deputy secretary was revived for Corbett on 27 July 1728, probably reflecting the fact that the secretary, Josiah Burchett, at the age of sixty-two, was beginning to feel the strain of service.<br>
<br>It may be assumed that Corbett's role became more significant after his appointment as deputy secretary. The administrative records are not clear on this, but there are circumstantial indicators to suggest that Corbett possessed both the social status and professional expertise to make him a valued member of the Admiralty office. The twenty-one volumes of precedents that currently bear his name, some of which have annotations that appear in the hand of Torrington's successor, Sir Charles Wager, are testimony to his grasp of Admiralty affairs. He was confident enough to address both Torrington and George Anson as friends. When the duke of Bedford was brought into government as first lord of the Admiralty on 27 December 1744, his parliamentary supporters quickly came to appreciate Corbett's professionalism. Henry Legge, writing to Bedford on 17 August 1745, wrote of Corbett,<blockquote>We go on very lovingly and comfortably with our monocular secretary: when one comes to be better acquainted with him, he is not as bad as he looks for. It is true he has but one eye, but then he takes more exact aim at the matters in question with the remaining one. (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.37)</blockquote>In the 1734 election, Corbett became member for Saltash in Cornwall, a borough controlled by the Admiralty, which he represented until April 1750. In the House of Commons, Corbett spoke for the ministry on a number of occasions. Six years after Torrington's death he published <span class="italic">An Account of the Expedition of the British Fleet to Sicily</span> (1739), including the victory at Cape Passaro which had earned Byng his title. The work, which was partly based on personal papers provided by the second Viscount Torrington, reflects Corbett's closeness to his patron. In the year following publication of his book Corbett married Mary Lloyd of Duke Street, London; they had one daughter.<br>
<br>With Burchett ailing and under pressure from the demands of the war that broke out with Spain in 1739 Corbett was appointed joint secretary with him on 29 April 1741, thereby reviving the practice that had periodically existed in wartime until it had been abolished in 1705. Burchett could not continue long and retired on 14 October 1742, leaving Corbett as sole secretary. Corbett retained the office until his death, but his declining health led to the establishment of a new post of second secretary, given to John Clevland, on 1 August 1746 to assist with the expanding workload. Corbett held the office of secretary to the Admiralty board for a shorter period of time than his distinguished eighteenth-century colleagues, Burchett, Clevland, and Philip Stephens, but his service to the board stretched over thirty-six years and his knowledge was clearly valued by the commissioners. He died on 30 April 1751.<br>
