<span class="headword">Lorimer,  John Henry</span>  (1856&#150;1936), <span class="occ">genre and portrait painter</span>, was born at 22 Hill Street, Edinburgh, on 12 August 1856, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17016/', "James Lorimer (1818&#150;1890)")</script>, professor of public law at the University of Edinburgh, and his wife, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stodart (1835&#150;1916). The architect <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34600/', "Sir Robert Stodart Lorimer")</script> was his younger brother. Brought up in an Edinburgh family with scholarly and artistic proclivities, he was educated at the Edinburgh Academy and attended Edinburgh University for a short time before embarking on an artistic career. His professional training began in the School of Art on the Mound, Edinburgh, where he was grounded in the South Kensington system, but he soon graduated into the life school of the Royal Scottish Academy, where he encountered George Paul Chalmers and William McTaggart, deemed a pioneer of impressionism before it was so labelled. Lorimer was wealthy enough to travel extensively, visiting Spain (1877), Italy (1882), and Algiers (1891). During a stay of six months in Venice he copied the old masters as well as sketching from life. Like many of his generation he was drawn to the paintings of Tintoretto and Bellini in Venice and Velasquez in Madrid, which resulted in an interest in &#145;tone&#146;, the effect of light and shade on colour; <span class="italic">Wintry Gloamin</span> was his first exhibit at the Royal Scottish Academy, in 1873.<br>
<br>Lorimer was no artistic rebel; he was elected an associate of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1882 and made a full academician in 1900; he showed 123 works at the academy and forty-three works at the Royal Academy in London. The artist and critic Robert Alan Mowbray Stevenson concluded &#145;Lorimer is a moderate man, a conscientious artist and anything but a charlatan and yet he has won respectful consideration, not only from the public, but from the profession, not only from England, but from the Continent&#146;  (Stevenson, 322). Lorimer's works were well received in Paris; <span class="italic">The Eleventh Hour</span>, retitled <span class="italic">Marriage de convenance</span>, won second medal at the Paris Salon of 1896 and took the gold medal at the International Exhibition of 1900, being subsequently purchased by Philadelphia Art Gallery. Previously it had &#145;hung on the line&#146; at the Royal Academy in 1894, receiving the ultimate accolade, a private royal viewing at Windsor. The French authorities bought <span class="italic">Grandmother's Birthday&#151;Saying Grace</span> (1893) and <span class="italic">Colonel Anstruther Thomson</span> for the Luxembourg Gallery. <span class="italic">Lullabye</span>, having secured honours at the Paris Salon of 1902, was purchased for the Victoria National Gallery, Melbourne. A corresponding member of the Institut de France, Lorimer was obliged to decline the Legion d'honneur owing to Foreign Office regulations.<br>
<br>Undoubtedly &#145;conservative&#146;, Lorimer's &#145;quiet style&#146; was &#145;neither particularly novel nor particularly clever and audacious&#146;  (Stevenson, 322). Despite this he was linked in the public's mind with the progressive Glasgow school, which included James Guthrie and John Lavery, owing to his luminosity, the &#145;flooding effect of real light&#146;  (ibid., 323) and his handling of tonal values. These features of his style came from studying in 1884 at the Paris atelier of the successful society portraitist Charles Auguste &Eacute;mile Durand, known as Carolus-Duran. By this time it was considered necessary to complete an art education in Paris, to acquire the &#145;practical knowledge of those French methods of teaching and working which had long exercised a potential influence on all Continental art and were beginning to affect the insular independence of English painting&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 5 Nov 1936, 11). Yet although coeval with the emergence of impressionism, Lorimer &#145;scarcely struck out towards innovation&#146;, and resisted painting with &#145;a French accent&#146;  (Stevenson, 322&#150;4).<br>
<br>Lorimer's atelier training can be seen in his audaciously lit compositions, the light emanating from various sources. But he was not seduced by Jules Bastien-Lepage's rural naturalism, instead winning distinction by observing the cultivated life of the middle classes and offering &#145;delightful glimpses of life as it passes in many a Scottish home&#146;  (Caw, 421). Lorimer favoured anecdote: <span class="italic">The Flight of the Swallows</span> (1907; Edinburgh City Art Centre), for instance, depicted a charming Edwardian mother and her three pretty daughters, one in tears, watching the flight of swallows at the end of summer. He knew &#145;how to concentrate the composition in such a way that it shows immediately the connection between the people, things and phenomena&#146;  (De Soissons, 114); no great effort is needed to understand his intent. <span class="italic">The Eleventh Hour / Marriage de covenance</span> (1894; Kende Gallery, New York) could be classed a &#145;psychological drama&#146;, showing a woman caught in a marital dilemma. Such understated emotion proved Lorimer an &#145;able psychologist&#146;, who knew &#145;how to play on the human soul&#146;  (ibid., 123).<br>
<br>Following in the footsteps of his fellow Scots Sir William Quiller Orchardson and John Pettie, who found fame and fortune painting sentimental melodramas, Lorimer favoured modern Scottish domesticity. <span class="italic">Lullabye</span> (1889; Victoria National Gallery, Melbourne), with its low toned lighting and intimacy, is reminiscent of the conscientious realism of the Dutch masters; Sir James Caw even likened Lorimer to Vermeer. Lorimer's interiors were not considered fanciful or &#145;cold compilations of archaic research, as commercial combinations of fantasy, bric-a-brac and the odd corners of a furniture shop&#146;, rather &#145;they are natural, habitable, intimate &hellip; the inevitable home of the figures that people their dainty seclusion&#146;  (Stevenson, 324). Lorimer fabricated this &#145;dainty seclusion&#146; at Kellie Castle, Pittenweem, Fife, built in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and in his &#145;pleasant old house&#146; in Edwardes Square, Kensington, London, which was &#145;fitted up after the fashion of the old castle&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Ordination of Elders in a Scottish Kirk</span> (1891; NG Scot.), praised by Caw as &#145;one of the most national pictures ever painted &hellip; [touching] the very heart of Scottish piety and reverence&#146;  (Caw, 421&#150;2), has become, through copious reproductions, an emblem of the sober-minded Scottish temperament. It treats in a &#145;sympathetic and satisfactory way&#146; one of the few ceremonials allowed by the presbyterians; &#145;An Ordination of Elders by a well-beloved minister is a solemn and touching event, held in the greatest honour by a naturally religious people&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 1893, 308). Despite its being &#145;a little hard&#146;, Stevenson recognized its chief quality as the &#145;sympathy with which several marked types of Scottish faces have been &hellip; rendered&#146;  (Stevenson, 324).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Ordination</span> demonstrates Lorimer's skilful handling of light, which emanates from a number of sources, while also revealing his ability as a portraitist. He established his reputation with a portrait of his father &#145;hung on the line&#146; at the Royal Academy in 1879. Praised by Sir Frederick Leighton, president of the academy, and John Everett Millais, the leading portrait painter of the day, Lorimer found himself an overnight sensation. After he was propelled into London's artistic &eacute;lite commissions came thick and fast; some ninety portraits have been identified, now mostly residing in private collections. Portraits of illustrious sitters included <span class="italic">Sir David Chalmers, Chief Justice of British Guiana</span> (1882), <span class="italic">Lord Reay, Governor of Bombay, Lord Rector of St Andrew's University</span>, and <span class="italic">Sir Joseph Lister, Bart</span> (1896). But it was observed that his &#145;over precision frequently gave a hard and rather grim look to his sitters&#146;  (Caw, 422). Lorimer retained the primary interest in character that was the chief concern of the &#145;older school&#146;. But in <span class="italic">Mrs Edward Salvesen and her Children</span> (1898) Lorimer proved he could &#145;catch people in the freedom of their home surroundings, amidst the objects they love and in an unconstrained attitude&#146;  (De Soissons, 124). Lorimer's &#145;quiet&#146; style shows the cautious approach adopted by British artists to French painting, maintaining his &#145;personal view and his English flavour&#146; while fortifying and broadening his art &#145;by an impressionism modified to his own use&#146;  (Stevenson, 323).<br>
<br>Lorimer, who was unmarried, lived at Kellie Castle, initially a family summer home, for over sixty years; its walls are still hung with the fruits of his labour. In retirement he contented himself by capturing the gardens surrounding the castle, as in <span class="italic">September</span>, in which &#145;the ordered profusion of wealth in the flower-lover's garden is happily realised&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Studio</span>, 68, 1916, 15). He died at Gyles House, Pittenweem, Fife, on 4 November 1936.<br>
