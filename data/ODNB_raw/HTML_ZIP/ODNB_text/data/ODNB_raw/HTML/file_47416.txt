<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Debenham, Sir  Ernest Ridley</span>, first baronet  (1865&#150;1952), <span class="occ">department store owner</span>, was born on 26 May 1865 at 42 Wigmore Street, Marylebone, London, the son of <a name="cosubject_61551"></a><span class="headword">Frank Debenham</span>  (1837&#150;1917), <span class="occ">silk mercer and draper</span>, and his wife, Emma Folkard Ridley.<br>
<br>Frank Debenham inherited a thriving business in Wigmore Street from his father, William Debenham (<i>d</i>. 1863). In addition to expanding retail sales, he also developed a considerable wholesale and export trade. A wholesale millinery department was instituted and a factory opened at Luton, as well as departments devoted to costumes, silks, gloves, ribbons, and tulles. Expansion also took place through the acquisition of a number of specialist retailers and manufacturers of fabrics and draperies. From 1851 the firm was known as Debenham and Freebody, the latter being the maiden name of William's wife, Caroline. In 1900 it became Debenham &amp; Co.<br>
<br>The idea of selling small amounts of fabrics to dressmakers was first introduced by Frank Debenham, and almost all the fashionable dressmakers flocked to his store. By the 1850s Debenhams had become the fashionable fabric business; and many of the dresses and hats for royal garden parties and presentations were supplied by it.<br>
<br>As befitted a fashionable London retailer, Frank and Emma Debenham sent their eldest son Ernest to Marlborough College and Trinity College, Cambridge (1883&#150;6). At the age of twenty-seven Ernest joined the family business and brought with him a fresh perspective to the running of the department store. His time at Cambridge had also given him a wide circle of friends which he used to good effect in his business dealings.<br>
<br>At that time Debenhams was developing a lucrative business in the bulk supply of dresses, a factor which was to give it strong buying power with suppliers. However, competition was increasing among London department stores and Ernest reasoned that if Debenhams was to maintain its position it would be necessary to restructure operations and refurbish the London store. In his quest to achieve these ends he was greatly helped by his friend Frederick Oliver, an extremely able barrister, whom he had met at Cambridge. Debenham persuaded Oliver to join the firm and his rapid grasp of business practice proved invaluable.<br>
<br>Ernest, aided by Frederick Oliver, oversaw a number of significant developments in the fortunes of Debenhams. Two separate limited companies were registered in 1905, as the retail and manufacturing operations were split: Debenhams Ltd was formed to own Debenham and Freebody (retailers), along with Debenham &amp; Co. (wholesalers, manufacturers, and shippers). The London store was rebuilt after the architects William Wallace and James Gibson designed a grand new store in 1906. Frank Debenham was chairman until his retirement in 1912. Ernest then took over, with Oliver as his deputy. Frank Debenham died on 15 January 1917 at 1 Fitzjohn's Avenue, Hampstead, London.<br>
<br>The First World War had great impact on the department store trade, especially the fall in the so-called &#145;luxury&#146; trade. By 1916 a working relationship was established with another London retailer, Marshall and Snelgrove, with the idea of preserving retail operations in the war economy. Such a relationship was to become a basis for a full merger in 1919 when Marshall and Snelgrove were experiencing financial difficulties. In May 1919 Ernest successfully concluded the merger, arguing that competition between Debenhams and Marshall and Snelgrove had been wasteful. Later that year he also began talks with the eighty-year-old Harvey Nichols store which led to a take-over in 1920. Ernest's final years with Debenhams were marked by increasingly complex financial deals. These culminated with his retirement in 1927 when he sold off the bulk of his shares in the company for over &pound;1.8m, effectively ending the family connections.<br>
<br>Ernest Debenham was a paternalistic chairman whose policies materially benefited the working lives of his employees. The firm had for some time run benevolent societies for staff welfare, and in 1921 it went further and pioneered a low-cost dental service. It also established a school for employees. Ernest enlisted help from the Shop Assistants' Union to encourage his staff to participate in further education, and he also sent female employees to working women's colleges. Sadly, not all his activities were so well judged. His letters to his former employees serving at the front in the First World War are illustrative of his insensitive nature. He wrote informing the men that they would be required to have a medical examination on their return before they could be reinstated for work.<br>
<br>In 1892 Debenham married Cecily, daughter of the ironfounder William Kenrick, and they had three sons and four daughters. The family home in London was a fine house in Addison Road, Kensington. Complete with a grand mosaic dome, this had been designed by his friend Halsey Ricardo. Debenham served on the London county council from 1912 to 1919. Away from business, however, his greatest interest was his farm in Dorset. To this he applied the same tireless energy he gave to his business, developing new methods for the intensive production of milk. He also initiated the method of marketing milk in disposable, sealed cartons.<br>
<br>An alert and receptive businessman, Debenham oversaw the transformation of a fashionable London millinery business into a firm composed of a number of large (and still semi-autonomous) department stores. He made the most of his connections, and was created a baronet in 1931. Sir Ernest died on 25 December 1952 at Moor Lane House, Braintspuddle, Dorset. He was succeeded as baronet by his eldest son, Sir Piers Kenrick Debenham.<br>
