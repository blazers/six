<span class="headword">Carstairs,  George Morrison <span class="st"> [Morris]</span></span>  (1916&#150;1991), <span class="occ">psychiatrist</span>, was born on 18 June 1916, the son of the Revd Dr George Carstairs, a distinguished, dedicated Church of Scotland missionary stationed in Mussooree, India, and his wife, Elizabeth Huntley Young. Son and father shared a passion for their adopted country, and from childhood onwards Morris (as the son was known) became fluent in both English and Hindi. Perhaps deliberately, he never lost that trace of Hindi which flavoured his soft Edinburgh English.<br>
<br>At the age of ten Carstairs returned to his ancestral city, Edinburgh, to be schooled at George Watson College and, later, to study medicine at Edinburgh University, from which he graduated MB and ChB in 1941. His career thereafter was somewhat unusual. His upbringing in India had exposed him to the widespread suffering of the underprivileged, which had in turn engendered compassion for the underdog. He became acutely aware of the inadequacies of his traditional medical education: it had given him only the vaguest insight into the causes of, and even less on how to mitigate, the social problems that plagued his conscience. His ignorance prompted him to take a course in anthropology at Cambridge and later in New York, where he worked for a time with the world-famous anthropologist Margaret Mead. He was an apt student, and his early book <span class="italic">The Twice Born</span> (1957), a study of the Brahmans, won praise from Mead herself. On 14 December 1950 Carstairs married Vera Dorris Lilian Hunt (<i>b</i>. 1924/5), an anthropologist, and he and his young wife began a study of an Indian village, Sujarupa, where they lived and shared the primitive life of the inhabitants. The study assumed marathon proportions and was completed only after twelve separate visits to India; it was finally published thirty-two years after it had begun, under the title <span class="italic">The Death of a Witch</span> (1983).<br>
<br>So launched, Carstairs was firmly committed to combining the profession of anthropology (with allied interests) with that of medicine and psychiatry. After graduating in medicine he worked as an assistant physician at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital, then from 1942 to 1946 served in the RAF as a medical officer. After demobilization he was elected a Commonwealth fellow to work in the USA from 1948 to 1949, then spent a further year there as a Rockefeller research fellow (1950&#150;51). Having returned to the UK, he was appointed in 1953 a senior registrar at the Maudsley Hospital, London, the Mecca of British psychiatry. Here he worked under Professor Sir Aubrey Lewis. The relationship between master and pupil was not entirely harmonious, although each respected the other's talents. Nevertheless, Lewis, being aware of Carstairs's particular interest and expertise, gave him the opportunity to study a quite different disadvantaged population much nearer to home than India&#151;namely, those suffering chronic psychoses, in the main, chronic schizophrenia.<br>
<br>In 1960 Carstairs was given his own Medical Research Council unit at University College, London, designated for the study of psychiatric epidemiology. In the following year, 1961, he was elected to the chair of psychological medicine (psychiatry) in the University of Edinburgh, with the proviso that he take his unit with him. This was agreed.<br>
<br>Of all the many achievements Carstairs crammed into his life, the tenure of the chair in Edinburgh was without doubt his most successful. He collected around him distinguished colleagues, both academics and clinicians working in neighbouring National Health Service hospitals. With this spread of talents, Carstairs built his department into a centre of excellence for research and for teaching graduate and undergraduate students. But above all he continued to focus on his primary interest: the psychiatric concomitants of anthropology and sociology.<br>
<br>To add to his insatiable appetite for hard work, Carstairs travelled widely, particularly in India, on behalf of the plans of the World Health Organization for the development of psychiatric facilities in under-developed countries. About the same time (1967&#150;71) he presided over the World Mental Health Organization. At a different level he achieved fame, or infamy, as the result of his highly controversial Reith lectures of 1962, &#145;This island now&#146;, where he argued that chastity was not the supreme moral virtue. The views he put forward were, in certain quarters, deemed the more outrageous because they were held by the son of a distinguished Scots cleric.<br>
<br>Carstairs's exemplary success in Edinburgh, coupled with his prominent role on the royal commission on medical education, prompted an invitation in 1973 to accept the vice-chancellorship of York University. He agreed; but what should have been a triumph turned out to be something akin to disaster. The time and place were wrong, and he missed the ambience of the medical school and the company of medical colleagues. Additionally, he found himself having to cope with the unpleasantness of the student protest movement, rampant at that time, and with the anti-authority atmosphere it created, which was incompatible with the role of the guru to which he had become accustomed.<br>
<br>After five years Carstairs shed the trappings of a vice-chancellor and returned to what was to him by far the more congenial work in India, where he completed a major report for the World Health Organization together with an update of earlier psychiatric and anthropological studies. The final touches of this work were completed during a year as fellow of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. Carstairs then returned to London and finally to his last resting place, Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Carstairs was self-evidently a complex man, yet his personal tastes were simple, verging on the ascetic: he preferred the shabby but culturally rich International Centre in Delhi to the grandeur of the vice-chancellor's house in York. He was not, by the same token, an establishment man: in 1971 he declined the invitation to stand for election as president of the newly established Royal College of Psychiatrists, a post which he might well have won. A man of absolute integrity, Carstairs refused to be intimidated no matter what. For example, he must have known how much outrage the forthright opinions he expressed in his Reith lectures of 1962 would generate. Similarly, he knew full well that he was swimming against the tide when he fearlessly attacked R. D. Laing and his cohorts, the leaders of the zany anti-psychiatrists, when they were at the peak of their popularity in the 1970s. Towards the end of his life Carstairs, who was divorced from his first wife, contracted a brief second marriage to Nancy Shields Hardin.<br>
<br>Carstairs was a great human being, an exemplary teacher, a born leader, and an outstanding doctor, all attributes that serve to highlight the tragedy of his decline into senile dementia. He died at his home, 12 Hermitage Gardens, Edinburgh, on 17 April 1991, supported to the end by his former wife, Vera, and their three children.<br>
