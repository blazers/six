<span class="headword">Montagu,  Helen Margaret</span>  (1929&#150;2004), <span class="occ">theatre producer</span>, was born on 21 April 1929 in Sydney, Australia; her father was a banker. She studied English literature at Sydney University, where she met Russell Alan Willett, a psychologist, whom she married in 1953. After spending their honeymoon in Italy, where she fell in love with Italian food, the couple decided to move to Britain; they later had three daughters and a son.<br>
<br>In London Montagu initially trained as an actress at the Central School of Speech and Drama but in 1964 was offered the job of casting director at the Royal Court Theatre under the auspices of the actor and director George Devine. Following Devine's death in 1966, Montagu was appointed general manager of the English Stage Company by the theatre's new artistic director, William Gaskill. During the late 1960s and early 1970s the Royal Court was at the forefront of exciting modern drama and many of its innovative productions transferred to the West End. Among the notable productions on which Montagu worked were Edward Bond's <span class="italic">Saved</span> (1965)&#151;with its controversial scene in which a baby is stoned to death in its pram&#151;Sir Alec Guinness and Simone Signoret's <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> (1966), David Storey's <span class="italic">Home</span> (1970, starring Sir John Gielgud and Sir Ralph Richardson, and directed by Lindsay Anderson), and the first flowering of new playwrights like Christopher Hampton (<span class="italic">The Philanthropist</span>, 1970). Montagu often came into conflict with the Lord Chamberlain's Office which, until the <span class="roman">Theatres Act</span> (1968), was responsible for licensing plays and took particular objection to some of the works staged at the Royal Court. For her part Montagu hugely relished her battles with the lord chamberlain in his attempts at censorship. Her growing popularity in theatre circles owed much to her irreverently straightforward manner, which was a refreshing alternative to the old-fashioned ways of the theatrical establishment in the 1960s. It was rare for a woman to be successful as a producer at this time and her achievements and talents were soon noticed in the West End.<br>
<br>After seven years Montagu left the English Stage Company. Following the birth of her third child she was invited by the American producer Arthur Cantor to revive the fortunes of his recently acquired H. M. Tennent Ltd. Formerly Britain's most successful commercial theatre production company, Tennent's had been co-founded by the legendary, and recently deceased, Hugh (Binkie) Beaumont. Many would have been daunted to step into Beaumont's shoes, but Montagu seized the opportunity. As well as presenting star productions, such as Peter O'Toole in <span class="italic">Dead Eye Dicks</span> and Paul Scofield in <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> (both 1975), she brought many new ideas and talents to the West End. One of these was the return of a modern repertory company at the Lyric Theatre, Shaftesbury Avenue, prompted by her invitation to Ben Travers&#151;the grand old man of farce&#151;to write what became a very popular new comedy, <span class="italic">The Bed Before Yesterday</span>, which alternated with <span class="italic">The Seagull</span>, both plays being directed by Lindsay Anderson and starring Helen Mirren and Joan Plowright.<br>
<br>In 1976, on the advice of Arthur Cantor, Montagu teamed up with Cameron Mackintosh on the revue <span class="italic">Side by Side by Sondheim</span>, which brought Stephen Sondheim's work to the attention of a wider British public. The show proved a huge success, due in part to Montagu's decision to stage it at London's Mermaid Theatre. She also brought her considerable sense of fun to the production, as well as her experience of first-night parties&#151;prescribing for her young co-producer her favourite hangover remedy, a &#145;bullshot&#146; made from chilled beef bouillon and vodka. Like any West End producer she had failures as well as successes, but these never dented her enthusiasm and her theatrical ambitions were rarely hindered by the practicalities of cost. This is possibly why her plans for a particularly sumptuous production of the Italian comedy <span class="italic">Filumena</span>, directed by Franco Zeffirelli, caused her to part company with H. M. Tennent in 1977 to set up Backstage Productions. Later, with Peter Sibley as its general manager, she formed her own company, Helen Montagu Productions.<br>
<br>Between 1984 and 1988 Montagu worked as the executive producer on the London version of the musical <span class="italic">42nd Street</span>. Throughout her career she displayed a talent for never losing her composure and for acting as a calming influence backstage. It was this ability that prompted the American producer David Merrick&#151;a notoriously prickly man and by then severely disabled by a stroke&#151;to entrust the London and later Australian productions of the musical to her. Uncannily she seemed to be the only person able to interpret Merrick's speech and wishes correctly. Montagu hated pretentiousness and during her career presented, with equal enthusiasm, nearly every kind of theatrical entertainment&#151;from modern classics to the rock musical <span class="italic">Tommy</span> (1993) and an outrageously camp <span class="italic">Prisoner of Cell Block H</span> (1995), starring Paul O'Grady (stage name Lily Savage). Other notable, if not always successful, productions included <span class="italic">Driving Miss Daisy</span> (Apollo Theatre, 1988, with Dame Wendy Hiller), the musicals <span class="italic">Gigi</span> (Lyric Theatre, 1985) and <span class="italic">Hot Shoe Shuffle</span> (Queen's Theatre, 1994), and in Australia Ronald Harwood's <span class="italic">The Dresser</span> (with Warren Mitchell) and Robyn Archer's <span class="italic">A Star is Torn</span>, which she also produced in London.<br>
<br>Helen Montagu never did things by halves. Characteristically in the 1980s she changed her hair colour overnight from a stylish jet black to a glamorous ash blonde. She knew all the best restaurants, the best designers, and the best shops to acquire the necessities of life, which included glamorous clothes and her favourite Cristal champagne. She loved parties and was a terrific, if frenzied, cook. She was also an excellent first-night guest and could be relied on to manufacture an appreciative and loud laugh (even when a show was not that funny) to galvanize the audience into applause. To many of her friends she was La Montagu because there could only be one of her; she invariably greeted friends with the cry of &#145;Daaahling&#146; across a crowded bar or theatre lobby. She died on 1 January 2004 at St Mary's Hospital, Praed Street, Westminster, following a stroke. She was survived by her husband and their three children.<br>
