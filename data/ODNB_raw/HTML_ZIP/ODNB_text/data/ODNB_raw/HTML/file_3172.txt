<span class="headword">Braddon,  Laurence</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1724), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was the second son of William Braddon of Treworgy, in St Genny's, Cornwall. He was admitted to the Middle Temple on 20 November 1677.<br>
<br>When Arthur Capel, earl of Essex, sent to the Tower of London for his part in the Rye House plot of 1682, was found dead in the Tower on 13 July 1683, Braddon decided that he had been murdered, and began to collect evidence to prove this. He was soon arrested, and on 7 February 1684 he and Hugh Speke were tried before the court of king's bench, accused of a conspiracy to spread the belief that the earl of Essex was murdered by his keepers, on the order of the court, and of attempting to suborn witnesses to testify to this. Braddon was found guilty on all the counts, was fined &pound;2000, and kept in prison until William III landed in 1688. He was called to the bar on 24 November 1693, and in February 1695 he was appointed solicitor to the wine licence office at a salary of &pound;100 a year.<br>
<br>Most of Braddon's works concern the death of the earl of Essex. <span class="italic">Enquiry into and Detection of the Barbarous Murther of the Late Earl of Essex</span> (1689) was probably written by him, and he was the author of <span class="italic">Essex's Innocency and Honour Vindicated</span> (1690), <span class="italic">Murther will out</span> (1692), <span class="italic">True and Impartial Narrative of the Murder of Arthur, Earl of Essex</span> (1729), and <span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's Late History Charg'd with Great Partiality and Misrepresentation</span> (1724), which claimed that Burnet's history was full of misrepresentations to make people believe that Essex committed suicide. Braddon also published <span class="italic">The Constitutions of the Company of Watermen and Lightermen</span> (1708), and an <span class="italic">Abstract of the Rules, Orders, and Constitutions</span> of the same company (1708). In <span class="italic">The Miseries of the Poor are a National Sin, Shame, and Danger</span> (1717) he argued for the establishment of guardians of the poor and inspectors for the encouragement of arts and manufactures. In 1721 he brought out <span class="italic">Particular Answers to the most Material Objections Made to the Proposal for Relieving the Poor</span>. Braddon died on 29 November 1724.<br>
