<span class="headword">Ferguson,  Patrick</span>  (1744&#150;1780), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the second son of James Ferguson (1700&#150;1777) of Pitfour, a senator of the college of justice and lords commissioners of justiciary in Scotland, and Anne Murray (<i>d</i>. 2 Jan 1793), daughter of Alexander Murray, fourth Baron Elibank. He attended a private military academy in London and was gazetted cornet in the Royal North British Dragoons on 12 July 1759. After one campaign in Germany he was struck down by sickness which kept him from the service between 1762 and 1768. Gazetted captain in the 70th regiment of foot on 1 September 1768, his whereabouts in the early 1770s cannot be confirmed, although a number of writers state that, before being invalided home, he served in the West Indies and participated with a detachment of the 70th in putting down the Carib uprising on St Vincent in 1772&#150;3.<br>
<br>Tradition has it that Ferguson was experimenting with various designs of breech-loading rifles in the years prior to the outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1775. He did submit a design for such a rifle to the adjutant-general in March 1776, and after the design had been considered by the Board of Ordnance Ferguson was allowed to patent it, being granted patent number 1139 on 2 December 1776. There was nothing new in Ferguson's design, nothing which had not been produced by a number of other English and continental gunmakers as far back as the late seventeenth century; in fact, the basic feature of Ferguson's system, a double-start rapid-pitch threaded cylindrical breechplug, had been patented by the French engineer (and subsequent Huguenot &eacute;migr&eacute;) Isaac de la Chaumette in France in 1704 and in England under patent number 434 of 12 August 1721.<br>
<br>It was decided to form an experimental rifle corps for service in North America, to be armed exclusively with Ferguson's breech-loading rifle and commanded by Ferguson. One hundred rifles were manufactured to Ferguson's design, under his occasional supervision, by four Birmingham ordnance gunmakers during the summer and autumn of 1776, the same firms who had previously produced 800 muzzle-loading rifles for the Ordnance. Selected recruits from the 6th, 14th, 16th, and 25th regiments of foot were trained by Ferguson in the use of the new weapon and in light infantry tactics. By January 1776 the unit was being trained in marksmanship at Chatham barracks. After sailing from Portsmouth, Ferguson and his men, with only a portion of their rifles, arrived in New York on 24 May 1777. They received their baptism of fire just a month later, on 23 June, at Short Hills, New Jersey, in a minor skirmish. Shortly afterwards Ferguson's corps (also referred to as &#145;Ferguson's riflemen&#146; and &#145;the British rifle men&#146;) embarked as part of Howe's Philadelphia campaign, and landed at Turkey Point, Maryland, on 24 August 1777. By then they wore green uniforms, the conventional colour for rifle companies on the continent. The 100-man unit acted with the British light infantry and Hessian riflemen in the march which culminated in the battle of Brandywine and the British occupation of Philadelphia. There were minor skirmishes throughout the move towards Philadelphia, and Ferguson's men were particularly active in those at Iron Hill and Christiana Bridge. Ferguson's corps formed part of the right wing of the British forces under General Wilhelm von Knyphausen, which crossed Chadd's Ford of Brandywine Creek late in the afternoon of 11 September 1777. Ferguson was commended in Knyphausen's report of the battle to General Howe. Ferguson described how, during the battle, he had in his sights an officer subsequently identified as Washington, and how he felt it would be unsporting and ungentlemanly to shoot at such a simple target. Ferguson also mentioned that during the battle: &#145;I had only 28 men with me, a few have been disabled by the Enemy and the rest from fatigue&#146;  (Peckham, 2.300), so it would appear that, by Ferguson's own statement only days after the event, of the 100 rifles only 28 were used during the battle of Brandywine. The balance of his men were with the baggage train. During the battle Ferguson's right arm was shattered, and he never recovered full use of it; he later received &pound;182 10<i>s</i>. compensation. On the day after the battle Ferguson's corps was officially disbanded, the men returning to their parent regiments; their weapons were recalled to the ordnance stores of New York in the summer of 1778.<br>
<br>Ferguson's arm took a long time to heal, and until the Carolina campaign in early 1780 he was employed as an intelligence-gathering agent by General Sir Henry Clinton, with whom he became perhaps as much a favourite as Major John Andr&eacute;. He also occasionally commanded small <i>ad hoc</i> units (generally composed of detachments of the 71st regiment) in small-scale harassing raids against rebel targets such as the Little Egg Harbour (New Jersey) raid in October 1778. From July to November 1779 he served as military governor of the fortifications at Stony Point, on the Hudson River above New York city.<br>
<br>Ferguson was gazetted major in the 71st regiment of foot on 25 October 1779, and given rank as lieutenant-colonel in America effective only from 1 December 1779. The 71st was the most active British regiment to serve in America and was widely employed in company strength and in light infantry detachments for special services. Late in 1779, possibly while still stationed at Stony Point, Ferguson began to recruit for a unit of his own, sometimes referred to as &#145;Ferguson's Scottish corps&#146; or more generally as the &#145;American volunteers&#146;. Composed of 150 loyalist volunteers, the corps accompanied Ferguson on the Carolina campaign, arriving outside Charleston, South Carolina, on 11 January 1780; they operated with the light infantry, the 71st, German riflemen, Tarleton's British Legion, and the New York volunteers, under the command of General James Paterson. On 22 May 1780 Clinton appointed Ferguson inspector of militia in North and South Carolina and Georgia, with orders to enlist as many men as possible in the British interest. Some 4000 men rallied to the colours. It is likely that men from the American volunteers were used as a training cadre for these recruits. Some time before the end of May 1780 Ferguson's southern militia unit (also confusingly referred to as Ferguson's corps) was armed with 300 captured French muskets and bayonets, and 50 swords, all issued to them from the ordnance stores in Charles Town.<br>
<br>When General Earl Cornwallis, commander of the British forces in the south after the return of the commander-in-chief, Sir Henry Clinton, to New York, began his northward march towards Virginia in September 1780, Ferguson commanded a detachment composed of his American volunteers, and about 800 loyalist militia. In allowing his command to become isolated and beyond effective reach of the rest of Cornwallis's force in the foothills of South Carolina, Ferguson was probably influenced by his own enthusiasm and dedication, by his contempt for the fighting capabilities of the rebel militias he had encountered, his rivalry with Banastre Tarleton, and his misplaced belief that succour was readily available. There is evidence to suggest that the favouritism shown by Clinton to Ferguson and the antagonism between Clinton and Cornwallis may have caused Cornwallis to withhold aid from Ferguson until it was too late, and that in rendering such aid Tarleton may not have moved as quickly as was his wont. There is also some doubt whether Ferguson was fully aware of the nature and number of the &#145;over-mountain men&#146; who moved against him, and against whom he made his stand on the South Carolina side of King's Mountain on the border of the Carolinas, on 5 October 1780. In the action, which lasted sixty-five minutes, and which resulted in Ferguson's death, his men charged the surrounding rebel militia with their bayoneted muskets several times. After all the lessons which the British army had learned in five years of war in America, it is ironic that the position chosen by Ferguson, atop a nearly bald-topped eminence surrounded with tree- and boulder-covered slopes, forced on him a European linear formation while his woods-wise attackers, firing individually from behind cover, were able to employ their conventional form of Indian fighting. After his wounding at Brandywine in 1777 Ferguson was unable to use a long arm, which is presumably why he was armed with a pair of pistols and a knife when he died.<br>
<br>From his correspondence Ferguson comes across as intelligent, considerate, humane, and totally dedicated to the cause of his king and country. Contemporaries in age and rank considered him one of the best officers in the army and several of his superiors thought highly of him; he was well liked by his commander-in-chief, Sir Henry Clinton, who described him as &#145;a very zealous, active, intelligent officer&#146;  (<span class="italic">American Rebellion</span>, 175&#150;6). Clinton's predecessor, Sir William Howe, seems to have had some reservations, but these appear to have had more to do with his not having been consulted on the use of Ferguson's experimental corps.<br>
<br>Much has been written about how the American War of Independence might have evolved if a weapon such as Ferguson's breech-loader had been the standard British weapon. In fact, the design of Ferguson's rifle made it useless as a military weapon. The moving part of the breech mechanism, which rendered it supposedly rapid-loading and reloadable from cover, was completely exposed to the deposits created by the burning of the gunpowder and became inoperable after fewer than ten shots. Deposits also accumulated at the front of the area in which the ball and powder were contained, which progressively prevented the ball from seating in the same position as for the previous shot: therefore the point of impact of the bullet would vary with each shot, and the shooting become increasingly inaccurate. The mechanism was mounted in the stock such that much wood was removed and the stock was made very fragile for a military weapon. All of the known surviving examples of the military rifle are broken and crudely repaired at this point. Finally, and by no means least, there would have had to be a complete revolution in military attitudes towards weapons technology and the need for a weapon with the supposed attributes of the Ferguson rifle. That revolution did not take place until after the self-contained metallic cartridge had been successfully introduced during the last quarter of the nineteenth century.<br>
