<span class="headword">Luard,  Henry Richards</span>  (1825&#150;1891), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and university administrator</span>, eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47804/', "Henry Luard (1792&#150;1860)")</script>, London banker, and his wife, Jane Richards, was born in London on 17 August 1825. His uncle was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17117/', "John Luard")</script>. He was educated at Cheam School under Charles Mayo, and between 1841 and 1843 at King's College, London. He took up residence at Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1843. In 1846 he obtained a college scholarship, and in 1847 graduated BA. He was fourteenth in the first class of the mathematical tripos, lower than expected, but he was later said to have been in bad health at the time of the examination. In 1849 he was elected to a fellowship at Trinity College. He proceeded MA in 1850, BD in 1875, and DD in 1878. He was for a short time mathematical lecturer in Trinity College, and was junior bursar from 1853 to 1862. In 1855 he was ordained deacon and priest, and from 1860 to 1887 he was vicar of Great St Mary's, Cambridge. In January 1862 he was elected registrary of the university, in succession to Joseph Romilly, and on 19 June in the same year he married Louisa Calthorpe, youngest daughter of George Hodson, archdeacon of Stafford and canon of Lichfield; they had one son, who died in June 1891. In 1875 he was elected honorary fellow of King's College, London.<br>
<br>Luard was a pre-Tractarian high-churchman opposed to ritualism, but tolerant of those who differed from him. He was an energetic parish clergyman, an active parish visitor and an eloquent preacher. During his incumbency much of Great St Mary's was restored. He found the church still encumbered by the eastern gallery, nicknamed Golgotha, in which the vice-chancellor and heads of colleges sat; but he persuaded the senate to accept a plan which included the removal of both eastern and western galleries, and the reseating of the nave and chancel. These works were carried out in 1863, and the church was reopened for services on 2 February 1864.<br>
<br>Although he took his degree in mathematics, Luard was a good classical scholar, with a particular interest in the English critics of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Among these his hero was Richard Porson, whose work he began to collect and edit even as an undergraduate. He contributed a &#145;Life of Porson&#146; to the <span class="italic">Cambridge Essays</span> (1857), and to the ninth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, and he bequeathed his extensive collection of Porsoniana to the library of Trinity College. It had been anticipated that he would collaborate with W. G. Clark in editing the <span class="roman">Cambridge Shakespeare</span> (1863&#150;6), but his appointment as university registrary prevented more than a preliminary edition of Act I of <span class="italic">Richard II</span> (1860). As registrary of the university he was accurate and industrious. With the help of his clerk he rearranged the documents under his charge, binding each group in a volume, with a separate index. These indices were afterwards united so as to form a comprehensive guide to the whole body of records. In 1870 he published <span class="italic">A chronological list of the graces, documents, and other papers in the university registry which concern the university library</span>. He took a close interest in the university library, sharing in the printed catalogues of manuscripts (1856&#150;67) and of adversaria (1864). Luard was by temperament and conviction a conservative, and he was opposed to most of the changes during his lifetime in the university and in Trinity College: he wrote several flysheets and short pamphlets on the subject.<br>
<br>In addition to his university duties and influenced by S. R. Maitland, Luard edited for the <span class="roman">Master of the Rolls</span> series a long list of works, upon which his reputation as a historian chiefly rests. He approached his task with scrupulous care, and compiled the indices with precision, but at the same time the introductions are distinguished by wide historical knowledge. The first of these, <span class="italic">Lives of Edward the Confessor</span>, was published in 1858, when Luard, still a novice, was much helped by J. E. B. Mayor. The principal piece in the volume is a metrical life of the saint in old French (Cambridge UL, MS Ee.3.59), to which Luard appended a translation and glossary. Sixteen years afterwards Robert Atkinson of Dublin published &#145;Strictures on Mr. Luard's edition of a French poem on the life of Edward the Confessor&#146; in <span class="italic">Hermathena</span> (1, 1&#150;81). Undoubtedly Luard had made mistakes but the attack was ill-tempered and tardy, especially in view of Luard's fine record as a <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span> editor: his <span class="italic">Annales monastici</span> (1864&#150;9) is still the standard and unchallenged edition of this text. Luard made no reply to Atkinson but it was well known that the attack affected him greatly, and probably contributed to the illness which he suffered between 1877 and 1880. During those years he was obliged to go abroad and to ask the university to appoint a deputy registrary. Returning in better health, he continued to work for the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span> on Matthew Paris's <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> (1872&#150;83), one of the best editions in the series. He also contributed articles to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. His recovery was, however, followed in 1889 by the death of his wife, to whom he was much attached; other symptoms appeared, and he died, after a long period of weakness and suffering, on 1 May 1891 at his home, 4 St Peter's Terrace, Cambridge. He is buried with his wife in St Giles's cemetery, Cambridge.<br>
