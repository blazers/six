<span class="headword">Deare,  John</span>  (1759&#150;1798), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born in Liverpool on 26 October 1759, the son of Thomas Deare (<i>fl</i>. 1757&#150;1789), a jeweller and artist in hair of Liverpool, and Esther Molyneaux. He was apprenticed in 1776 to Thomas Carter, a successful London carver, particularly of chimneypieces. The next year he enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools, and in 1780 he won a gold medal for his model on a subject from Milton. After completing his apprenticeship in 1783 he worked freelance, modelling for other sculptors, notably John Bacon (whom he admired), John Cheere, and Carter. His independent commissions included a plaster relief, <span class="italic">The War of Jupiter and the Titans</span>, for the pediment of Whitton Park, Hounslow (1783), a relief entitled <span class="italic">The Good Samaritan</span> (after 1782) for the Liverpool Dispensary designed by the Liverpool architect John Foster, and a fireplace for a Manchester patron for &pound;63. Contemporary artists, especially Joseph Nollekens, admired his skill. The figures manufactured in ceramic by Derby to decorate clocks by Benjamin Vulliamy&#151;Deare's only surviving early work&#151;are dexterously modelled and derive stylistically from Bacon's decorative neo-classicism and the popular <i>putti</i> of Duquesnoy.<br>
<br>In 1785 Deare went to Rome on a three-year pension from the Royal Academy; he remained there until his death. Intoxicated by life in that city, he studied and drew with passion the great collections of antique sculpture in the Villa Albani, Capitoline Museum, and elsewhere. Warm-hearted but quick-tempered, he became the leader of a circle which included the painters Robert Fagan, Charles Grignion, and Samuel Woodforde, and the writer George Cumberland. To discharge his obligation as an academy pensioner&#151;to send a work to the annual exhibition&#151;Deare modelled the largest relief undertaken by a British sculptor in the eighteenth century, <span class="italic">The Judgment of Jupiter</span>. More than twenty figures of different physical types, in various levels of relief, are woven into a composition emulating contemporary history painting. Owing to a dispute with the academy over its size, the plaster was not sent to London. A marble version (1.48 m &times; 2.97 m) was commissioned in 1788 by Sir Richard Worsley for &pound;470 (Los Angeles County Museum of Art). For the subject of his next relief, <span class="italic">Edward and Eleanor</span> (1786), Deare looked to James Thomson's play on this British legend and transposed it from medieval Acre to ancient Greece. Eleanor (modelled in high relief) sucks the poison from her husband's wound&#151;a supreme act of wifely devotion&#151;while he (modelled in shallow relief) sleeps. The marble version (1790, priv. coll.), for Sir Corbet Corbet, dazzles the viewer with its virtuoso carving.<br>
<br>In the marble relief <span class="italic">Marine Venus</span>, purchased in 1787 by Sir Cecil Bisshop for Parham Park, Sussex, a sensuously carved goddess is borne along by an exuberant sea monster; here Deare blends his devotion to the antique with a new enthusiasm for sixteenth-century mannerist sculpture. He evolves this pictorial style further in the marble <span class="italic">Cupid and Psyche</span> (1791) for Thomas Hope of Deepdene (plaster version, Lyons House, co. Kildare), and especially in <span class="italic">The Landing of Julius Caesar in Britain</span> (1791&#150;4; Stoke Manor, Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire) for John Penn, who had chosen the subject.<br>
<br>Although Deare attracted the patronage of collectors buying from adventurous sculptors such as John Flaxman (Thomas Hope and the earl of Bristol) and Antonio Canova (Henry Blundell and John Latouche), his livelihood, when his academy pension expired, depended on a practical approach to his craft. As in London, he combined the roles of artisan and fine artist. Like many of his contemporaries, he and his workshop carved copies of celebrated antiques for British visitors. Prominent among these were his <span class="italic">Apollo Belvedere</span>, commissioned in 1792 for Attingham by Lord Berwick (for whom he also restored some antiquities), <span class="italic">Faun with a Kid</span> (Prado Museum, Madrid), acquired by Lord Cloncurry (priv. coll.), and a bust, <span class="italic">Ariadne</span> (<i>c</i>.1789, now in the Capitoline Museum, Rome), for John Latouche. Deare continued to make chimneypieces; the prince of Wales purchased one carved stylishly with masks and festoons (Frogmore House, Windsor). Sometimes Deare employed architects such as Joseph Gandy on chimneypiece design. He also carved a small number of portrait busts, including that of John Penn (Eton College).<br>
<br>Deare, who had married at some time before 3 October 1796, died in Rome on 17 August 1798, apparently from a chill caught while sleeping on a block of marble in the hope of inspiration&#151;not out of character for a man who probably belonged to the Adamiani sect, which held that God should be worshipped naked. He was buried within three days in the protestant cemetery, Rome. Friends including Vincenzo Pacetti and Christopher Hewetson organized the disposal of the contents of his studio for the benefit of his Italian wife and children. Having died young without substantial output, Deare was soon almost forgotten. The high esteem in which his contemporaries held him as a designer and carver of reliefs is well deserved.<br>
<br>John Deare's nephew <a name="cosubject_7395"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Deare</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1803, <em>d.</em> 1835), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was baptized on 27 May 1803 at the church of St Nicholas, Liverpool, the son of Edward Deare, an attorney, and Margaret Wattleworth of Liverpool. He entered the Royal Academy Schools in London in 1822, and won silver medals in 1823 and 1825, and a gold medal in 1825 for his model <span class="italic">David and Goliath</span>, which he showed at the Royal Academy in 1826 (the model, formerly at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, is now destroyed). He also twice won the silver Isis medal of the Royal Society of Arts, for his model entitled <span class="italic">Bacchus</span> in 1823 and a relief the following year.<br>
<br>Deare stayed on in London, exhibiting at the Royal Academy in 1826 and from 1828 to 1832, but from about 1833 he worked also in Liverpool. He exhibited portrait busts, often of local celebrities, such as <span class="italic">Dr Stewart Trail</span>, at the Liverpool Academy in 1832 and 1834, and posthumously in 1836. He died on 5 August 1835 following an accident while climbing a wall to get into his Liverpool studio. The only work certainly by him traced to date is a sketchbook of portrait studies in Liverpool Public Library.<br>
