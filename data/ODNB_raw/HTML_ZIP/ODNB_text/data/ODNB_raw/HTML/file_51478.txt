<span class="headword">Chisholm,  George Goudie</span>  (1850&#150;1930), <span class="occ">geographer</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 1 May 1850, the second child and first son of David Chisholm, actuary with the North British Insurance Company, and Anne Goudie. The family were strong United Presbyterians. After attending preparatory school, in 1860 or 1861 Chisholm entered Edinburgh high school, leaving as dux in 1865. In 1867 he matriculated at the University of Edinburgh, graduating MA in 1871. That year he joined the editorial department of W. G. Blackie &amp; Sons, of Glasgow, where he compiled reference books, probably under the guidance of Dr W. G. Blackie, the middle son, who admired the German system of education and who corresponded with many notable German geographers. While working there Chisholm published <span class="italic">The Two Hemispheres</span> (1881), a world geography which showed his interest in the economic, rather than the physical side of the subject. Realizing, none the less, the importance of natural science to geography, he returned to Edinburgh to take a BSc in natural science in 1883.<br>
<br>In 1884 Chisholm married (Victoria) Florence Bright, the youngest daughter of Samuel Jones, a Manchester businessman. They moved to London, probably in the early 1880s, and lived happily there. Elected fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1884 and of the Royal Statistical Society in 1888, and a member of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, he earned a comfortable living from his numerous, meticulously researched geographical articles, school textbooks, and reference works, as well as his <span class="italic">Handbook of Commercial Geography</span> (1889), which ran to many editions. His writings show his interest in school geography, following the Keltie report on geographical education in 1885, and his high estimation of German geography (his <span class="italic">Longman's School Geography</span>, 1886, for example, was modelled on Kirchoff's <span class="italic">Schulgeographie</span>). He began to lecture at the University of London extension courses and to the Geographical Association, hoping&#151;though the hope was sometimes frustrated&#151;to convey to his students the importance of finding causal links to give meaning to seemingly endless lists of facts. Through the Royal Geographical Society and many examination boards, he worked to raise standards of geographical teaching.<br>
<br>Chisholm was appointed lecturer in geography at the University of Edinburgh in 1908, the first such appointment at a Scottish university at a time when reformers were pressing for a broader curriculum and the inclusion of more vocational subjects. Geography teaching expanded and he was made reader in 1920. From 1910 he was secretary of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, then particularly active and successful. He retired in 1923 but continued to work, though he relinquished responsibility for revising his <span class="italic">Handbook</span> which had become something of a burden. He was particularly interested in how economic development might be harnessed to solve population problems and promote peace and democracy, interests which rested on his strong Unitarian beliefs. Two mild strokes in 1928 preceded his sudden death on a tramcar coming home from church on 9 February 1930.<br>
<br>Although many geographers did not share his passion for commercial geography (Rudmose Brown once commented that he was more concerned about the price of currants than the conquest of Everest), Chisholm's stress on the importance of economic power as the basis for political power proved prescient, and his contribution to the teaching of geography considerable.<br>
