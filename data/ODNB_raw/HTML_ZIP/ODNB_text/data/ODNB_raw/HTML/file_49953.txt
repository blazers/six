<span class="headword">Perry <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Pery]</span>,  Micaiah</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1641, <em>d.</em> 1721), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born in New Haven, in what was to become Connecticut, where he was baptized at the First Church on 31 October 1641. His grandfather Richard Pery (1580&#150;1650), from a family of small merchants in Exeter, settled in 1615 in London, where he invested in the Virginia Company and, after its dissolution, traded privately to the colony. He participated in many ultra-puritan activities, culminating in his being named an &#145;assistant&#146; (director) in the charter of the Massachusetts Bay Company. But, when the other officers emigrated with the charter to the planned colony, he remained in London, sending his eldest son, Richard, in his place. This Richard Pery settled provisionally at Charlestown, near Boston, but, dissatisfied, soon joined the group around John Davenport and Theophilus Eaton, which left in 1639 to found the colony of New Haven on Long Island Sound. About the time of the move, Richard Pery married Mary, daughter of Richard Malbon, a ship's captain and a kinsman of Eaton and original member of the Davenport&#150;Eaton group. The register of the First Church in New Haven records the baptisms of five children of Richard and Mary Pery between 1640 and 1649.<br>
<br>The triumph of the parliamentary cause gave some of the New England settlers reason to reconsider their abandonment of England, and a considerable number of them returned, including Richard Malbon, about 1648 or 1649, and Richard Pery and family, about 1651 or 1652. Many of the returning New Englanders were rewarded by the Cromwellian regime, Richard Pery becoming collector of customs and excise in Glasgow and &#145;messenger itinerant for the country accompts&#146; in Scotland. He lost these places about the time of Cromwell's death and withdrew to Ireland, where he became a merchant and cattle grazier near Clonmel in co. Tipperary. Before this last move, however, his eldest son, Micaiah, was apprenticed in 1656 in London to a merchant member of the Haberdashers' Company. Immediately following the end of his apprenticeship in 1663, Micaiah Perry (as he now spelt his name) married on 20 October Ann Owen (<i>d</i>. 1689), daughter of Dr Richard Owen, the recently restored rector of St Swithin, London, and prebendary of St Paul's Cathedral. This Anglican-royalist marriage suggests that Perry was consciously turning his back on a major part of his own family's deep puritan commitments.<br>
<br>Once out of his apprenticeship Perry began to trade on his own to Virginia, whither his grandfather Richard Pery had traded before 1640. By about 1670 he had formed a partnership in this trade with Thomas Lane, who was from a Northamptonshire minor gentry family. It is likely that in the early years of the firm both Perry and Lane would have visited Virginia. From twelfth in 1676 they were by 1686 to become the second largest London firm importing tobacco. Following the death in 1688 of their great rival John Jeffreys, they moved into first place, a rank which Perry retained, even after Lane's death in 1710, until his own demise in 1721. Given the importance of tobacco in British&#150;American trade, his leadership in this trade made Perry the most important British merchant trading to North America in the period between 1689 and 1720.<br>
<br>The success of Perry and Lane owed much to its efficiency, dependability, and adaptability. In most areas of the Chesapeake, it began by trading directly with small and middling planters through factors acting for them on commission. As the number of indigenous merchants in the Chesapeake increased, many of the greatest preferred dealing with the Perry house. A class of larger planters also emerged towards the end of the seventeenth century who found it in their interest to deal directly with merchants in England. Many of this element preferred Perry and Lane, which then had a relatively good reputation for acting in its correspondents' interest in selling tobacco, buying return goods, and avoiding long delays in shipping. (In 1719 the firm imported tobacco in space chartered on fifty different vessels.) To support its Chesapeake business, the firm also had some Madeira, West Indies, and North Carolina trade and occasionally ventured on the servant and slave trades. In the 1680s Perry contracted with the Royal African Company for slave deliveries to Virginia and in 1707 he attempted one slaving voyage on his own.<br>
<br>Perry's success in attracting business from the largest planters made it inevitable that he would also be asked to perform political tasks, including solicitation for places in the gift of the crown and for desired legislation and orders. He acted as both political and financial agent for the colony of Virginia and sometimes represented Maryland as well. He and Robert Carter of Virginia managed the &#145;northern neck&#146; of that colony for the proprietor, Lady Fairfax. He also handled the London business of Governor Francis Nicholson and of the College of William and Mary. His more charitable activities included raising funds for the college and for the refugees in the 1690s from the war-ravaged Palatinate; he was employed too by the archbishop of Canterbury to remit funds to America for the relief of Huguenot refugees there. He appears with striking frequency in the minutes of the Treasury and the Board of Trade. The board consulted him (more than fifty times between 1704 and 1713) about such matters as convoys and American conditions. In the City of London, however, he avoided all participation in municipal or guild affairs until 1708, when he was named to the lieutenancy (militia) commission.<br>
<br>Perry and his wife appear to have had two sons only. The younger, Micaiah, died in 1693 at the age of twenty-two. The elder, Richard, in 1694 married Sarah Richards, daughter and ultimate heir of the recently deceased merchant George Richards, a major competitor in the Chesapeake trade. By this marriage the Perrys in effect took over the Richards business. Perry was a commissioner for taking the &pound;2 million subscription that led to the creation of the new East India Company, but did not himself invest in that venture. Richard Perry, his son and partner, who had acquired some wealth with his wife, bought shares in the Bank of England and became a director, in 1699&#150;1701. But the family, like many others, came to prefer safer investments in real property, including the manor of Little Stanbridge in Essex. In London their realty holdings included large storage warehouses and two of the three quays along the Thames between the Tower of London and the Customs House. In Ireland Perry helped his brother John acquire a substantial estate near Clonmel during the forced sales of the 1690s. Perry's son Richard predeceased him in 1720 and he himself died at Leadenhall Street, London, on 1 October 1721. His business as the leading tobacco-importing firm in Britain passed to his grandsons, Richard's sons <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49955/', "Micajah Perry")</script> and Philip. They also inherited most of the family's other property though their mother and sisters were provided for. Perry was buried on 10 October 1721 at St Botolph without Bishopsgate.<br>
<br>Perry is a striking example of the fairly numerous cohort of merchants from nonconformist backgrounds who found it possible to reach a considerable level of commercial success after 1660&#151;particularly in the American trades&#151;without conspicuous political participation and concomitant government contracts.<br>
