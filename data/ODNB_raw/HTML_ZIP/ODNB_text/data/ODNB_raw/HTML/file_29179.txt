<span class="headword">Whatton,  William Robert</span>  (1790&#150;1835), <span class="occ">surgeon and antiquary</span>, born at Loughborough, Leicestershire, on 17 February 1790, was the son of Henry Whatton and Elizabeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Watkinson). Whatton was very proud to belong to a family which could trace its descent back more than 900 years. In 1804 he was apprenticed to a surgeon and apothecary, Bernard Maddock of Nottingham. Soon after qualifying as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, in London, in March 1810, he left for Portugal, where he served as a surgeon in the Peninsular War. He gained wide experience of the treatment of wounds working at the De Graca Hospital, Lisbon.<br>
<br>Following the end of hostilities in 1815 Whatton moved to Manchester, where he was appointed resident surgeon to the Manchester poorhouse. He resigned in 1817 and entered private practice. Whatton was moderately successful and was remembered by one of his pupils as a well-mannered, rather stout gentleman with a dignified military bearing. In 1822 he joined the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society. Whatton was interested in local history and published in 1828 <span class="italic">The History of the Manchester Grammar School</span>. His <span class="italic">History of Chetham's Hospital and Library</span> appeared in 1833. Together these formed the third volume of S. Hibbert-Ware's series, <span class="italic">Foundations in Manchester</span>. In 1829 Whatton published two pamphlets suggesting that a university should be established in Manchester as part of the Royal Institution, which had been founded in 1816. Nothing came of the proposal, though a similar scheme was again put forward in 1836 by Henry Longueville Jones.<br>
<br>Whatton married Harriet Sophia Seddon of Eccles in 1822. Their son, Arundel Blount Whatton (1827&#150;1862), became a clergyman. They also had a daughter. Whatton is best remembered as one of the surgeons who attended the politician William Huskisson after an accident at the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway on 15 September 1830. Huskisson was knocked over by a train near Newton-le-Willows, seriously injuring his leg. While on the journey back to Manchester, his condition worsened and his companions stopped the train at Eccles and sent for Whatton and John Ransome, honorary surgeon to the Manchester Infirmary. Had Huskisson been a younger and more robust patient, the surgeons would have undoubtedly amputated the leg. However, they decided that the 60-year-old politician was too weak to undergo such trauma and, later that evening, Huskisson died. Whatton and Ransome were subsequently criticized for not taking more decisive action to save their patient. Both surgeons defended themselves vigorously. Huskisson's wife, Emily, was entirely satisfied that her husband had received the best possible care; she thanked Whatton warmly and presented him with an engraved gold snuff-box.<br>
<br>Three years later Whatton himself was elected honorary surgeon to the infirmary ahead of Joseph Jordan, one of Manchester's leading medical teachers. While on the infirmary staff he published the papers <span class="italic">Spinal and Spino-Ganglial Irritation</span>, and <span class="italic">An Address to the Pupils of the Manchester Royal Infirmary</span>, offering advice on a successful career. He performed a number of operations, including a partial amputation of the foot, which he described to the anatomy section of the British Association.<br>
<br>Whatton died suddenly in Manchester on 5 December 1835, aged forty-five, after contracting meningitis. His colleagues were shocked at losing a surgeon of talent at a relatively early stage in his career.<br>
