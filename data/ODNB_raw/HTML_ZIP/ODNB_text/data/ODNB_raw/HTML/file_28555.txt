<span class="headword">Waller,  Augustus Volney</span>  (1816&#150;1870), <span class="occ">physiologist</span>, was one of the seven children of William Waller (<i>d</i>. 1829) and his wife, Jessie (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Eagle), of Elverton Farm, near Faversham, Kent. An entry in the parish records of Preston church, near Faversham, gives the date of Waller's baptism as 11 December 1833, with a note appended stating, on the authority of the surgeon in attendance, that he was born on 9 November 1816. This date also appears on his University of Paris diploma and may be taken as correct. His baptism at the age of seventeen is consistent with the belief that soon after his birth the family emigrated to Nice, where his father died in 1829. Waller returned to England with his mother, who later remarried, and he is believed to have been brought up by a friend of his father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15930/', "William Lambe")</script>, a medical practitioner in London, and later with his son Lacon Lambe (1797&#150;1871), a medical practitioner in Herefordshire. The elder Lambe was a vegetarian who wrote on the subject, and Waller followed the same diet until he left his adopted home to study in Paris. He matriculated <i>bachelier &egrave;s lettres</i> in 1834 and went on to study medicine. In 1840 he obtained his MD with a thesis on indirect percussion, returned to England to qualify as a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries, and established himself in practice at St Mary Abbott's Terrace, Kensington, London. Waller married on 6 January 1844 Matilda Margaret Walls (1815&#150;1888), daughter of John Walls, solicitor, of Fulham. They had one daughter, Matilda Amelia (1845&#150;1908), and one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38099/', "Augustus D&#233;sir&#233; Waller (1856&#150;1922)")</script>, later professor of physiology in the University of London.<br>
<br>Between 1840 and 1850 Waller combined medicine with private scientific research, in which he had a deep interest. His first published work was on microscopical observations of hailstones, but he soon turned to what became his main interest, the physiology of nerves, which secured him an enduring reputation. In 1851 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society at the early age of thirty-five, having published two papers in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>. The first, in 1849, was on the histology of the frog's tongue. The second, in 1850, was on the changes undergone by nerve fibres following bisection: this was his seminal contribution to physiology.<br>
<br>Waller relinquished his medical practice in 1851 to move to the University of Bonn, where he worked with the ophthalmologist J. L. Budge. His papers, mainly in French, on the pathways of the cervical autonomic nerves, were well received and he and Budge were jointly awarded the Monthyon prize of the French Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences in 1852. He left Bonn for Paris in 1856 to work in M. J. P. Flourens's laboratory at the Jardin des Plantes. In 1856 he was awarded a second Monthyon prize, this time in his sole name, but he left for England soon after, owing to ill health. Waller applied, unsuccessfully, for a teaching post at University College, London, under William Sharpey, but in 1858, with improving health, he was appointed professor of physiology at Queen's College medical school, Birmingham.<br>
<br>This offered Waller a permanent academic post with time for research, which was his m&eacute;tier; but he also kept in touch with clinical work by taking the additional post of physician to Queen's College Hospital, and obtaining his membership of the Royal College of Physicians. Birmingham did not suit him; the two medical schools in the city were active rivals (until their merger in 1868), and after failing to obtain the newly created Linacre chair of anatomy and physiology at Oxford in 1859, he resigned to live at St Leonards, Sussex. He kept in touch with science and in 1860 he was awarded a gold medal by the Royal Society, in recognition of the importance of his physiological researches. In 1862 he went to live abroad again, first in Bruges and then in the canton of Vaud, Switzerland. He was in medical practice, but still drawn to scientific investigations, and he received some support from the Royal Society. In 1868 he moved to Geneva, where he undertook clinical investigations and also physiological experiments at the university. In May 1870 he went to London to deliver the Croonian lecture to the Royal Society, but soon after his return he fell ill again and died of &#145;angina pectoris&#146; (coronary heart disease) at his home, 4 rue du Mont-Blanc, Geneva, on 18 September 1870. He was buried at the Cimeti&egrave;re de Plainpalais, Geneva, on 21 September, but his grave can no longer be traced.<br>
<br>Waller's principal technique was microscopy, which he learned as a medical student under Alfred Donn&eacute;, the pioneer French histologist. He made no technical advances in the subject, beyond introducing the frog tongue for the examination of the capillary circulation, but he devised simple, yet crucial, experiments based on the bisection of nerves supplying the eye, tongue, and blood vessels and observing changes in the function and appearance of these organs. The pathways between brain and body organ were traced by following the degenerative changes which took place below the point of bisection distal to the nerve-cell body. Thus the nerve was effectively stained by its own chemistry in a manner analogous to the tracing of blood vessels by injected dyes. These histological changes became known as &#145;Wallerian degeneration&#146;. Their importance in physiology lies in their use in mapping the course of nerve fibres within nerve trunks and in the central nervous system: this has been called the Wallerian method. By its use Waller and Budge were able to demonstrate that the sympathetic nerve to the eye has its motor roots in the cervical spinal cord, the cilio-spinal centre. From his work on degenerating nerve Waller came to understand the essential nutritive function of the cell body, at a time when the connection between nerve cell and nerve fibre was not clearly established. Cut off from the cell, the fibre withers and dies.<br>
<br>The discovery of vasomotor nerves was made by the combined but independent work of Claude Bernard, C. E. Brown-Sequard, and Waller in 1852&#150;3. Waller's contribution was an elegant experiment on the action of the sympathetic nerve on blood flow in the ear, and he appreciated, more than the others, the importance of vascular control throughout the body.<br>
<br>Another discovery for which Waller can claim priority is that of diapedesis, the process by which white blood cells can move across the capillary wall into the interstitial space without the leakage of other blood components. This observation was made in 1846 in London, but he never explored it further and the subject is now usually associated with Julius Cohnheim, whose work did not appear until 1867.<br>
<br>Waller was always aware of the problems of clinical medicine, and throughout his career he undertook investigations which might have had some practical application. Thus he examined cooling as a form of local anaesthesia and the use of what he termed vagal compression in the treatment of migraine and seasickness. He was always prepared to carry out these procedures on himself, but they were never widely adopted.<br>
