<span class="headword">Stuart,  James</span>  (1868&#150;1942), <span class="occ">magistrate and historian in South Africa</span>, was born in Pietermaritzburg, Natal, on 30 January 1868, the eldest of the six children (four sons and two daughters, one of whom died in infancy) of Martinus Stuart (1841&#150;1881), Natal magistrate, and his wife, Mary (1846&#150;1918), daughter of David Taylor, trader, of George, Cape Colony, and his wife, Sophia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Moodie. Stuart's great-great-grandfather had fled from Scotland to Holland in 1688 to escape religious persecution. His grandfather, Jacobus Stuart, was a civil servant and merchant who left Amsterdam in 1851 to look for business opportunities in Natal and the Transvaal, and eventually settled in Natal. Stuart grew up in the villages of Greytown and Ixopo, and attended Hilton College near Pietermaritzburg, the capital of the colony. After the death of his father in the Anglo-Transvaal War of 1880&#150;81 his mother arranged for him to be educated at St John's College in Hurstpierpoint, Sussex.<br>
<br>Stuart returned to Natal in 1886. In February 1888 he was appointed a clerk in the post office in Pietermaritzburg. On 26 May 1888 he took up a position as clerk and interpreter in Zulu to the resident magistrate at Eshowe, the administrative centre of the recently annexed colony of Zululand, and on 1 February 1889 was appointed clerk and interpreter to the resident commissioner and chief magistrate of Zululand.<br>
<br>In March 1894 Stuart was sent to act as interpreter to the British representative on the provisional government committee in the Swazi kingdom, and in October 1894 he travelled to London as interpreter with a deputation of Swazi leaders. From March to August 1895 he was acting British consul in Swaziland. On 1 September 1895 he was appointed as resident magistrate in Ingwavuma in recently annexed Tongaland. Towards the end of 1897 he suffered a nervous breakdown, and was given leave to return to Natal. From October 1898 to April 1899 he once again acted as British consul in Swaziland. For the next two years he held brief appointments as acting magistrate in a number of centres in Natal before taking up a position as assistant magistrate in Durban, the colony's largest town, in March 1901.<br>
<br>By this time Stuart had become deeply involved in developing a long-term project, which he called his &#145;Idea&#146;, to conduct detailed research into the history and customs of the African population of Natal, and to make his findings public. Over the next twenty years he spent much of his spare time seeking out knowledgeable African informants, most of them elderly men closely connected to chiefly families, and making detailed notes of his conversations with them. He was a fluent Zulu linguist, and became well known in colonial circles through his lectures and publications on Zulu history.<br>
<br>As an acknowledged expert on native affairs, Stuart was seconded to do intelligence work for the colonial forces in the Natal rebellion of 1906 and its aftermath. From September 1906 to June 1907 he was secretary to the Natal native affairs commission, which was set up to investigate the causes of the rebellion and make recommendations for reform of native administration in the colony. On 1 July 1909 he was appointed assistant secretary for native affairs in Natal. After Natal was incorporated into the Union of South Africa in 1910 he was transferred to the Pretoria office of the new native affairs department, but found he had little useful work to do and decided to retire on the pension which became due to him in June 1912.<br>
<br>Stuart returned to Pietermaritzburg and resumed work on the history of the rebellion of 1906 which he had been commissioned to write by the Natal colonial government but which he had made his private project when the union government withdrew support for it. At the end of 1912 he travelled to London to finish work on the book, and the following year it was published by Macmillan &amp; Co. under the title <span class="italic">A History of the Zulu Rebellion, 1906</span>. It remained the standard work on its subject until the 1960s.<br>
<br>In April 1914 Stuart accompanied Sir Henry Rider Haggard on a tour of Zululand, and later in the year, after the outbreak of the First World War, went to London as cultural adviser for the play <span class="italic">Mameena</span>. This was based on Haggard's novel <span class="italic">Child of Storm</span> (1913), which he had dedicated to Stuart. Stuart seems to have remained in London during the early stages of the war, but by early 1916 he was back in Natal. Later that year he assisted in an official drive in Zululand to recruit men for the South African Native Labour Contingent, and in February 1917 he sailed for France with a detachment of the contingent. He held the rank of captain, but virtually nothing is known of his service record. He returned to South Africa in December 1917 and the following year settled in Hilton outside Pietermaritzburg with his wife, Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith, a missionary worker whom he had married in Ladysmith in 1916. For the next four years he was actively engaged in interviewing African informants to collect historical and cultural information for a series of Zulu readers that he was planning. In 1922 he left Natal with his family and settled in London.<br>
<br>Between 1923 and 1927 Longmans, Green &amp; Co. published seven Zulu readers written by Stuart for use as textbooks in black schools in Natal. He lectured widely on topics in Zulu history, assisted in the Zulu section of the Empire Exhibition held in Wembley in 1924, and in 1927 and 1930 made recordings of praises of the Zulu kings for the Zonophone company. Very little is known of the last dozen years of his life. He died at his home, 142 Croydon Road, Anerley, London, on 8 March 1942 from bronchitis contracted while he was engaged in duties as an air raid warden. He had two sons, Robert Coltness and Walter Francis, who was killed in Italy in the Second World War.<br>
<br>In 1949 Stuart's widow sold his collection of papers to Killie Campbell, owner of a large private library in Durban. From the 1970s the value of his research work became widely known in academic circles through the publication by the University of Natal Press of selections of his notes in a series of volumes entitled <span class="italic">The James Stuart Archive</span>.<br>
