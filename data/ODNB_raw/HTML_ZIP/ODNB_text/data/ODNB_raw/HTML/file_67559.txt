<span class="headword">Collier,  Thomas</span>  (1840&#150;1891), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born on 12 November 1840 at Howardtown, Glossop, Derbyshire, one of four children of Thomas Collier (1796/7&#150;1859), clockmaker and tea dealer, and of Martha Siddall (1800/01&#150;1857). Nothing is known of his childhood or schooling but he attended Manchester School of Art in the early 1860s. By 1864, following in the footsteps of David Cox, he had established himself in one of his favourite milieux, Betws-y-coed in north Wales. In 1863 he exhibited his first watercolour at the Society of British Artists, from a Manchester address, the home of his future wife, Hermione Beatrice Holdstock (1839&#150;1879), whom he married on 28 December 1865.<br>
<br>Until about 1869 Collier painted in north Wales and occasionally in the Lake District; three Cumbrian subjects were hung at the Royal Academy in 1870. He then moved to London and began to explore the Sussex downs and the byways of rural Surrey. Having been rejected in his efforts to join the Society of Painters in Water Colours, he was elected associate of the Institute of Painters in Water Colours in 1870 and a full member in 1872, the year of a single trip to Scotland. In 1876 he began to work in East Anglia, a favoured sketching ground, and in 1878 he was made chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur for a watercolour of Arundel Park, which was shown at the Paris Universal Exhibition. A year later, on 20 December 1879, his wife, tragically, died, just before the completion of their permanent Hampstead home, a residence of substance and good taste, where Collier lived for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Inspired by the naturalist tradition of Constable, Cox, and DeWint, Collier eschewed the contemporary Victorian taste for highly finished pictures. He was much the most distinguished of a group of landscape painters in the institute who admired the rougher, wilder, freer late work of Cox and the breadth of early English watercolours. In Collier's case this inspiration sprang not from nostalgia but from conviction, a passionate response to nature. Working in pure watercolour with a restricted palette, and <i>en plein air</i> in all weathers, his work always had the freshness and breadth of a great sketcher. The brooding, overpowering skies of his early work were later, like Constable's, suffused with light. Even in those early years occasional landscapes and beach scenes anticipate this development. His rare figures merge seamlessly with their surroundings as do uncommon and often lonely buildings; almost always these are seen as mere punctuation marks in the vast harmony of nature. Above all his sky painting and feeling for space characterize his work, from tiny sketches to large studio pieces. His few, small-scale, oil paintings earned him election to the Institute of Painters in Oil Colours in 1883.<br>
<br>Collier's means enabled him to paint how he pleased, without dependence on pupil or public, although his work sold readily enough. The only known photographs of him suggest a sensitive, shy, even melancholy man. He entertained a small circle of artist friends but preferred not to involve himself in art politics. After his wife's death, on 2 July 1881 he married her friend Jessie Ida Tawell (1856&#150;1937), who brought up the two children of his first marriage. Never robust in health Collier struggled with consumption throughout his later years. He died at his home, Etherow, 9 Hampstead Hill Gardens, London, on 14 May 1891 and was buried in the family grave in Highgate cemetery, as were his first wife, his son, his daughter, and eventually his second wife. Substantial collections of his work can be found in the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.<br>
