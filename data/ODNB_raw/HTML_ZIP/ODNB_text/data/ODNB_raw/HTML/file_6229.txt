<span class="headword">Cooper,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1517&#150;1594), <span class="occ">theologian and bishop of Winchester</span>, was born in Catte Street, Oxford, to poor parents; his father is said to have been a tailor.<h2>
<a name="Schoolingandearlycareer"></a>Schooling and early career</h2>Cooper rose from being a menial servant at Magdalen College, Oxford, to admission to the college school as a chorister in 1530&#150;31, when he was over twelve. Nothing is known of his childhood except that it was hard and he was diligent. Taught grammar by Thomas Robertson, he was bright enough to proceed to a training in rhetoric and in 1539 to a probationary fellowship at Magdalen, which, when he graduated BA, became permanent in 1540. By 1543 he had proceeded MA. But fellows were required to be ordained and Cooper was neither in sympathy with the theology of the time nor happy to commit himself to a life of celibacy. Like his friend and near contemporary the martyrologist John Foxe, he resigned his fellowship in 1545 and took on the task, with considerable misgivings, of revising Thomas Elyot's dictionary, which contrived to put into English the words, phrases, and technical terms encountered in classical Latin. Cooper doubted his skill, but Thomas Berthelet, the printer of the dictionary, reassured him that no one else was up to the task. By 1548 he had completed and published his first revision with the addition &#145;augmented and inriched with above xxxiii thousand words and phrases, very nedeful for the knowlage of the latin tonge&#146;  (Starnes, 69).<br>
<br>About 1546 Cooper married a woman named Amy (possibly Royse) and in 1549 set about completing Thomas Lanquet's unfinished <span class="italic">Chronicle</span>&#151;a universal history from the beginning of the world. At just this moment in his career, when he might have become no more than a hack author, he was offered the mastership of the school at Magdalen which provided a salary and some status. However, Edward VI's privy council raised radical proposals about whether the colleges of the university should support schools. Cooper and thirty-one fellows vigorously resisted these and enlisted the help of Cranmer and the city of Oxford. It was the first of many occasions in Cooper's career on which he had to promote the case for good learning.<br>
<br>At this time Cooper also faced personal problems which became the gossip of Oxford. His wife seems to have had affairs with at least two men which provoked ribald verses directed at her and a remarkable tribute by Sir John Harington to him. Cooper refused to divorce his wife, and Harington, observing that Amy Cooper was &#145;too light for his gravitie&#146;, added that &#145;His lyfe in Oxford was very commendable and in some sort saint-lyke; for if it be saintlike to live unreproachable, to bear a cross patientlie, to forgive injuries freely this man's example is sampleless in this age&#146;  (Harington, 2.88&#150;9).<br>
<br>Cooper certainly needed patience. His wife threw into the fire the early drafts of his own dictionary, the <span class="italic">Thesaurus</span>, eventually published in 1565, and his position as headmaster was also imperilled by the accession of Queen Mary. He recognized that he must either go abroad, as many of his contemporaries had done, or else support his family in other ways. In 1556 he supplicated for the degree of bachelor of medicine and was given leave by the university to practise as a doctor. He thus became part of a small but important group of Elizabethan bishops &#145;in waiting&#146; who experienced the Tudor church only from within and were not disposed to judge it or reform it to the patterns of the continent.<br>
<br>Following the accession of Elizabeth, Cooper was reappointed to the headship of Magdalen College School in 1559. His skills as a teacher were praised by William Camden, who acknowledged the debt he owed to Cooper &#145;in whose school I both confesse and rejoice that I received education&#146;  (Camden, 540). His second edition of Lanquet's <span class="italic">Chronicle</span>, which took the history to the reign of Queen Elizabeth&#151;now called Cooper's <span class="italic">Chronicle</span>&#151;appeared in 1560. He was probably ordained by this time, but no record survives. Could he now catch the eye of the Elizabethan establishment and move from his native city?<h2>
<a name="ElevationtoLincoln"></a>Elevation to Lincoln</h2>Cooper wrote in defence of Bishop Jewel on the sacrament in 1562, and published his own <span class="italic">Thesaurus</span> in 1565. When the queen visited Oxford in 1566 she heard and enjoyed not only a Latin oration from Cooper but also disputations on theological subjects which he had arranged for her. He recognized her interest in theology, and shortly afterwards himself proceeded to the degrees of BTh and DTh, both on 18 March 1567. In that year he was also elected vice-chancellor (against the wishes of the earl of Leicester, who was chancellor) and introduced popular celebrations, mainly of feasting and bell-ringing, to celebrate the queen's accession day. Also in 1567 he became dean of Christ Church and was tutor to Sir Philip Sidney; surviving accounts show that Sidney lived in his house until midsummer 1570. In 1569 Parker and Grindal recommended Cooper for the deanery of Gloucester, which was &#145;not so far distant from Oxford, so he may very well have due regard to both charges&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pepys MSS</span>, 161). In the event Cooper had hardly been appointed&#151;there is no record that he was ever installed&#151;when the see of Lincoln became vacant. His elevation was swift. He was elected on 4 February 1571, and consecrated on the 24th. Installed by proxy in the cathedral in March, he was installed in person on 28 June.<br>
<br>The diocese of Lincoln was vast, stretching from Lincolnshire to Hertfordshire; Cooper chose to live for most of his tenure of the see at Buckden, near Huntingdon, which was conveniently situated on the Great North Road. The immense task before him was essentially that of converting both priests and people to the peculiarly English form of protestantism and liturgy enacted by statute. This tested his skill as a teacher to the uttermost. Characteristically, he set about his task by preaching both nationally and in his diocese, by publishing easily comprehensible books, and by attempting to organize the clergy into group exercises in scriptural exegesis which were intended to promote better and more obviously biblical preaching.<br>
<br>Cooper preached at St Paul's Cross in 1572, and was accused by an adversary of maintaining an ignorant ministry, of defending the &#145;unjust lordship of bishops&#146;, of &#145;magnifying&#146; the prayer book, and of misusing the scriptures by &#145;wringing&#146; them from &#145;their natural sense and meaning&#146;. All this was attributed to Cooper's ignorance of the church in Europe because, his critic suggested, &#145;I have heard you were never yet out of this realm&#146;  (Strype, 2.287&#150;302). Undaunted, Cooper forged ahead, publishing in 1573 <span class="italic">A Briefe Exposition of such Chapters of the Old Testament as Usually are Redde in Church</span> (STC 5684). As the title suggests, the book gives an exposition of the text for each Sunday of the Christian year &#145;whereby the unlearned reader may not only the sooner attaine to the true sense and meaning of the holy ghost, the author of the scriptures but also learne some godly instruction of the same&#146;  (Cooper, <span class="italic">A Briefe Exposition</span>, preface). Parker wrote to Burghley asking that it be commended by the council: &#145;It would doe well. The rather for that the simplier [<i>sic</i>] the doctrine is to the people the sooner they may be edified and in obedience reposed&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 19, no. 9).<h2>
<a name="Diocesanreformer"></a>Diocesan reformer</h2>In the wake of his primary visitation of 1574 Cooper ordered the clergy who were not graduates to meet on alternate Thursday mornings for carefully regulated exposition of scripture, keeping closely to the text, with specially selected moderators judging the performance and correcting errors, noting absentees, and inquiring into the lives of participants. His orders were precise and survive for both Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire. These exercises (often known as &#145;prophesyings&#146;) were later commended by Archbishop Grindal, but were condemned by the queen on the ground that they could move out of the control of the bishops and be used to promote presbyterianism. Instructed to have them repressed in Welwyn, Cooper wrote a very careful reply, pointing out that he had asked the shire gentlemen and those ministers he trusted to report to him about them. Neither they nor the JPs had heard &#145;of any disorder there but that it was in all parts both moderately and godly us'd&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 29546, fol. 41<i>v</i>). His remonstrations fell on deaf ears and he was forced to dissolve all exercises in the south of his diocese except at Aylesbury. He was nevertheless apprehensive that reports of disorderly exercises might come from the northern parts of the diocese, not least because those in favour at court &#145;not only by their well doings but by the discrediting of others well doings&#146; were a hazard. He remained vigilant for those who &#145;made means to publish fantasticall opinions&#146;  (ibid., fol. 42<i>v</i>), especially in Leicester, and particularly criticized laity who attended exercises but who would not come to sermons.<br>
<br>It was Archdeacon John Aylmer who cast doubt on Cooper's sanguine report on prophesyings. The bishop himself was probably all too aware of the indifferent standard of education among his clergy. The battle not just for a passive assent but also for an active understanding of the Elizabethan settlement required all Cooper's energy and pedagogic skills. His injunctions following his visitation in 1577 required records to be kept of the number of sermons preached in every parish, and he insisted on the celebration of communion four times a year. Children over six were to be catechized for an hour before evensong. Ministers were to apply themselves to the study of scripture and to note &#145;wholesome sentences&#146; for use in preaching  (Kennedy, 2.46).<br>
<br>Cooper had a hard time with his cathedral chapter. It had been reformed under his predecessor, Bullingham, and looked as though it might become a centre of evangelism. John Whitgift was dean, John Aylmer was archdeacon of Lincoln, and Michael Reniger was subdean and chancellor. All three were learned and enthusiastic reformers and were for a time in residence. But Cooper was quick to spot that there was no divinity lecturer as there had been in Bishop Longland's time, and that the senior residentiaries were greedy for the perquisites of residence and the more lucrative prebends: Aylmer received Corringham, Whitgift Nassington, both worth considerably more than that given to Cooper's son-in-law, Dr John Belley, now his vicar-general. Aylmer was also in dispute with the bishop about the share of each in judicial fees which was eventually settled by a return to the practice of the fifteenth century. For Cooper this was just an irksome distraction from the real business: how could he prevent a slipping back to the old ways of the Church of Rome?<br>
<br>Cooper saw Catholics as those who &#145;winke with both eyes, and without offence suffer the Clergy of Rome, shameless Simony, incontinence, drunkeness, Dice playing, hunting, Necromancie, ambition, bribery&#146;, and much else that he utterly abhorred (Cooper, <span class="italic">Certaine Sermons</span>, 47; STC 5685). His visitation of his diocese in 1577 uncovered a number of recusants: the women of Bedfordshire were a difficult bunch, and the wife of William Mordaunt he described as &#145;a verie obstinate woman&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/117, no. 13). In Huntingdonshire a JP had his house in Cooper's diocese but his parish church in that of Peterborough so he could dodge both bishops. In Lincolnshire the bishop was not convinced of the sincerity of another JP who went to church &#145;starkly and seldom&#146; and used the convenient excuse of sickness  (ibid.). In 1580 the council congratulated him on &#145;how discretlie he hath travaled in discovering the offences of the principall Recusants&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1580&#150;81</i>, 106).<br>
<br>Cooper's vigour in promoting reform and suppressing dissent clearly marked him out for further promotion. Under his rule the diocese of Lincoln saw an increase in ordinations and a marked improvement in the learning of the clergy. In June 1579 he declined translation to Norwich on the ground that such a move would bring him neither an appreciable increase in stipend nor a less demanding cure. A more advantageous translation became a possibility with the death of John Watson of Winchester in 1584.<h2>
<a name="TranslationtoWinchester"></a>Translation to Winchester</h2>Cooper's passage to the diocese of Winchester was unusually speedy: he was translated from Lincoln on 12 March 1584 and confirmed in his new see by Archbishop Whitgift on the 23rd. His were trusted hands, and the state of the Winchester diocese was in need of them. Writing to Lord Burghley in January 1584 Robert Bennet, master of St Thomas's Hospital in Winchester, pleaded that the diocese required:<blockquote>a man full of wisdome, faithefulness and spirit in his calling, that maie as in his place soo in giftes of diligence, zeale, wisdome, government, and hospitalitie strive before the rest and that the vacation be not longe, lest the insolence of recusantes growe to too great an height of pride. (BL, Lansdowne MS 40, no. 23)</blockquote>In April 1584 Cooper became the prelate to the Order of the Garter, a perquisite of the holder of the see, and was invested with the appropriate robes. It was a long way for a poor tailor's son to have come.<br>
<br>The task facing Cooper was daunting. The diocese, which comprised Hampshire, Surrey, and the Channel Islands, presented problems different from those of Lincoln. The inadequacy of incumbents was common to both sees, but in Winchester the central problem was that of the recusants who could turn traitor with disastrous consequences in a diocese that bordered on the channel. In May 1584 Cooper told Burghley that his archdeacon reported at least 400 obstinate recusants in Hampshire alone, and a single parish had forty or fifty. The slackness of the churchwardens meant that this was an underestimate. Cooper asked for increased powers to deal with them, and suggested names for ecclesiastical commissioners.<br>
<br>In 1587 Cooper conducted a personal visitation of his diocese: he was at pains to see that preachers who were deemed satisfactory were well deployed and helped by clergy of &#145;the inferior sort&#146; who were to catechize and read homilies. They were to attend to their &#145;exercises&#146; with a view to public preaching, and those whose university degree exempted them from exercises were &#145;to beware of innovation in their ministry&#146; and see that holy communion was celebrated at least three times a year. They were also required to wear the surplice &#145;not from any holiness therein but for obedience and reverence&#146;  (Hants. RO, MS 21 M65/B1/18). The same orders were repeated throughout Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. All ministers were forbidden to frequent fairs, markets, taverns, and ale houses, and were ordered to &#145;abstain from filthy drunkenness&#146;  (ibid.). In 1590 he isolated four sorts of minister for special blame: the ignorant, those whose lives were in contradiction to the gospel, those who were negligent in their duties, and those who executed their duties &#145;perversely or frowardly&#146;  (Hants. RO, MS 21 M65/B1/19).<br>
<br>What Cooper might find perverse or froward others might not. In 1586 John Udall, the puritan lecturer in Kingston, Surrey, was accused of holding conventicles and was tried and condemned to death, though pardoned in 1592 at Whitgift's request. The sheriff of Surrey, Sir William More of Loseley, brought a petition to parliament from the inhabitants of South Farnham lamenting the failings of the ministry there; yet it was Cooper who complained to More about the vicar of Farnham's insufficiency in 1589 and noted the failure of his parishioners to attend church in 1591. Nor was More above presenting to the parish of Compton a cleric whom the bishop judged to be of insufficient learning and thus no preacher.<br>
<br>The real anxiety for Cooper, however, was the problem posed by recusants who were by 1585 harbouring priests from Douai and Rome to minister to the Catholics of the land and who were smuggled in along the channel coastline. The Hampshire prisons were full of recusants whom Cooper treated with little mercy. He would not allow them burial in church ground and even suggested that the able should be sent to swell the earl of Leicester's army in the Low Countries. Jesuits were known to avoid Winchester, but neither the death penalty, severe fines, nor imprisonment deterred the Catholics. Cooper, an ecclesiastical commissioner, examined and handed over to the secular authorities for execution two priests from Rheims and a labourer who had assisted them, and others were sent to London for trial. In 1587 there were more than 100 in the common prison for Surrey; Cooper wrote desperately in 1589 &#145;that the people do fall away in Religion by the evil example of such Recusants as have liberty&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1589&#150;90</i>, 124).<br>
<br>Part of Cooper's anxiety lay in the assumption that as the Armada approached, English Catholics would support the Spaniards. In this he was wrong, but that did not stop him pressing hard on his clergy to make sure they all contributed in money or in kind to the defence of the realm. For this he was held up as an example to other diocesans. Behind Cooper's energetic involvement in national defence lay his fervent loyalty to the queen: he was asked to write a prayer for use in the army, while in 1589 he was also engaged in writing <span class="italic">An Admonition to the People of England</span>. This, however, was not directed against papists but against the parallel threat, as he saw it, from extreme puritans.<h2>
<a name="TargetforMarprelate"></a>Target for Marprelate</h2>Though seditious books were under severe penalty after 1586, there were a number of illegal attacks on the church, which senior churchmen attempted to answer. The deaths in 1588 of both John Field and the earl of Leicester goaded a weakened but committed puritan party into producing a series of tracts under the pseudonym of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73908/', "Martin Marprelate")</script>, beginning with two of the most important: the <span class="italic">Epistle</span> in October 1588 and the <span class="italic">Epitome</span> in the following month. It is probable that from the first Cooper intended his <span class="italic">Admonition</span> to constitute a broad defence of the Elizabethan settlement, and that he subsequently added a preliminary section to it specifically dealing with the issues raised by the Marprelate tracts. The result was that he became embroiled in a dispute in which his opponent showed all the wit and personal insult of the street-pamphleteer, while Cooper laboured under the self-imposed handicap of neither descending to personal detail nor lowering his tone to match that of his adversary.<br>
<br>Cooper knew that his <span class="italic">Admonition</span>, presented as the work of &#145;T. C.&#146;&#151;the bishop's own initials but taken by others (who had clearly not read the book) for Thomas Cartwright&#151;would have little effect against Marprelate's wit: &#145;The dartes, I confess, of deceitfull and slanderous tongues, are very sharpe, and the burning of woundes made by them, will as hardly in the hearts of many bee quenched, as the coales of juniper&#146;  (Cooper, <span class="italic">Admonition</span>, 4). His primary argument is that the government of the church is not laid down by scripture but is expedient to the government of the land. Contrasting the different arrangements for European protestant churches, he observes:<blockquote>I doubt not but &hellip; directed by the spirite of God to retain this liberty, that in external government and other outward orders they might choose such as they thought in wisedome and godlinesse to bee most convenient for the state of the Countrey and disposition of the people. (ibid., 64&#150;5)</blockquote>In England to be without bishops would be &#145;not just Mar-prelate, but Mar-prince, Mar-state, Mar-law, Mar-magistrate&#146;  (ibid., 31). He defends his episcopal colleagues from the charges against them and repeats often that &#145;Men are fraile, and in danger to sinne though they have otherwise great graces&#146;  (ibid., 20). Bishops, however, have no monopoly of frailty, and to bring them into &#145;contempt&#146; at a time when the enemies of the realm have lately been defeated shows an ingratitude for &#145;the mightie workes of God and his marvellous mercies&#146;  (ibid., 29). He argues that bishops have experience and learning that many of their critics do not, and he condemns &#145;our hasty divines that in three yeeres study think &hellip; to have more learning then all the Bishops in England&#146;  (ibid., 54).<br>
<br>Cooper's argument was moderate. He claimed no divine right through apostolic succession for the bishops, nor did he deny their fallibility. But he was convinced that the church had improved under Elizabeth, and that such improvement was put at risk by extremists who quibbled over details (such as the sign of the cross in baptism) and who refused in consequence to enrich the church with their teaching or other abilities. They also made legitimate reforms seem unwise since they were asking for so many changes at a time when the Spaniards threatened far more decisively the whole fabric of English protestantism, of which both presbyterianism and episcopalianism were a part. Moderation after this fashion was to be reasserted by Richard Hooker, possibly a pupil of Cooper at Magdalen.<br>
<br>Within three months of the appearance of the <span class="italic">Admonition</span> Marprelate replied to it with <span class="italic">Hay any Worke for Cooper</span> (published on 23 March 1589). Not only did the pamphleteer revel in the publicity that the bishop had given to his tracts, but he also took the opportunity to hurl personal abuse at the bishop. Cooper was said to be &#145;very choleric and peevish&#146;  (Marprelate, 20); the old matter (though significantly no new matters) of his wife's infidelity was brought to public attention; he was accused of ignorance, and of being addicted to card-playing and gambling. It all pained Cooper. He was an old man by 1590, and by 1592 was beginning to have to absent himself from committees and the House of Lords (which he had previously attended regularly) seemingly on health grounds. Marprelate's taunts were savage precisely because Cooper was a formidable adversary. He was a strong defender of that peculiarly English form of protestantism, eventually to be designated Anglicanism, even before it existed. Writing in 1583, he displayed his heart on his sleeve when he wrote:<blockquote>For this I dare saye that synce the very age of the Apostles unto this tyme we lyve in, there was never any Churche upon thearthe that had so perfecte trewthe of doctryne nor so synceare admynystratyon of Sacraments without supersticyon, as thanked be God, the Churche of Engeland now hathe. Thearfore the dangerusnes of these latter daies consydered, we should raythur yelde most hearty thankes to god for the greate blessings that we have, then to murmur at some smale blemyshes or imperfectyons that remayne. (BL, Stowe MS 159, fol. 153<i>v</i>)</blockquote>In sum, much of Cooper's support for the English church lay in his conviction that scripture should not be interpreted literally, but rather with a view to restoring the usage of the early church. With this went a profound respect and love for the service of holy communion. As a diocesan he ordered its celebration three or four times a year, as a visitor to his old college he rebuked the fellows for the carelessness and the irreverence shown to it. In his sermons he could write more warmly: &#145;For in deede wee teach I believe that it is one of the sweetest and most excellent comfortes that Christ at his departure left unto his people&#146;  (Cooper, <span class="italic">Certaine Sermons</span>, 33). In his utter certainty that faith and the fruits of belief were a seamless robe, neither existing without the other, Cooper was at one with his adversaries.<br>
<br>Marprelate did not, however, confine his attack on Cooper to the <span class="italic">Admonition</span>. The bishop was a lexicographer, initially in his adapting Elyot's <span class="italic">Dictionary</span>, and then in compiling his own <span class="italic">Thesaurus</span>. Marprelate accused him of plagiarism, and also implied both that he had failed to acknowledge Elyot's original contribution and that he had lifted much of the <span class="italic">Thesaurus</span> from the French dictionary of Robert Stephanus (1552) and the German dictionary of John Frisius (1556). It is certainly true that Cooper borrowed widely and used, for instance, William Turner's herbal dictionary and those of others. It has been observed that Cooper's &#145;contemporaries and successors were inclined to judge him by a higher standard than they applied to the average&#146;  (Starnes, 98). The subtlety of Cooper's English usage and the fact that he gave a large number of English words that might translate the Latin not only served to enrich English, but made for a more accurate understanding of Latin. Thus &#145;Salve multum&#146;  (Plautus) is given by Cooper as &#145;God speed you heartily, God give you an hundred good tomorrows&#146;  (Redhead, 54).<h2>
<a name="Financialmatters"></a>Financial matters</h2>More telling still was Marprelate's gibe that Cooper was a &#145;petty pope&#146;  (Marprelate, 23). The people of Leicestershire had noticed a certain lordliness in his demeanour and wished that he would come to them without any entourage and pomp. Yet it is difficult to find evidence that before his last years in Winchester Cooper conducted himself like a wealthy man. His wife may have had property and he may have made some money as a physician, but the diocese of Lincoln yielded an income of less than &pound;900. The expenses of servants and travel were heavy, which no doubt explains why the bishop used his son-in-law as his deputy: it kept the money in the family.<br>
<br>Winchester was two or three times the value of Lincoln. On his translation to Winchester Cooper was granted the temporalities, calculated at &pound;2793, retrospectively from Michaelmas 1583. This was a generous restitution but Cooper claimed that, not being &#145;riche in myself&#146; and not having any other office <i>in commendam</i>, he would &#145;hardlie be hable to live&#146; unless he was allowed to pay his first fruits over a period of five years at the rate of &pound;500 per annum  (BL, Egerton MS 1693, fol. 115<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). His petition was granted, and Cooper also asked for, and received, &pound;530 from the executors of his predecessor, John Watson. By 1587, however, he was at full stretch financially. He evaded the expense and responsibility of a projected queen's progress in 1586. He was complaining as late as 1590 to William More that litigation pending on his estate over fishing and other rights was making a heavy demand on him:<blockquote>I could not but make this complaint unto you, being at this time more troubled with quarrelous matters than I have [been] in all my life to stand the charges in all things I shall not be able to beare it, unless I give over housekeeping cleane. (Redhead, 193)</blockquote>Yet the bishop did not die a pauper; indeed his successor excused his own payments for the defence of the realm on the grounds that he was not as rich as Cooper. Cooper's will shows that by the time of his death he was hardly short of housekeeping money. He had accumulated much silver gilt; his collection of armour (for his contribution to the defence of the realm) included 72 pikes, 6 cases of pistols, 29 daggers, and considerable ammunition. At Farnham he had 12 geldings and 5 &#145;stone&#146; horses, and at Waltham at least 7 other horses. All those may have been the necessary perquisites of an active bishop. More remarkable was Cooper's note &#145;of such ready money as I have in possession this 9 April 1594&#146;. It included &#145;one bagge &pound;150; in one other bagge &pound;140, in one other bagge &pound;160&#146;, and &pound;480 in further bags  (Foster, <span class="italic">Lincoln Episcopal Records</span>, 343). What he did not have&#151;and he defended episcopal wealth for this reason&#151;were estates or even a house for his widow. But there was a little. He mentions &#145;graunts, assignmentes and assurances&#146; made to himself and his wife by his brother-in-law Robert Royse &#145;of and in twoe meadowes parcell of the Ferme of Mydly by Oxford&#146;  (ibid., 339).<br>
<br>As he lay dying in 1594 Cooper was careful to double-check his last arrangements, adding codicils to his will: his wife was to enjoy most of his wealth, but the remainder was to go to his grandchildren through his sons-in-law. His will also recognizes the claim of old and infirm servants and gives a glimpse of his love for the son-in-law who had served him so well; Cooper's devotion to learning was apparent in the gift of his books to Winchester Cathedral Library.<h2>
<a name="CooperandtheElizabethanchurch"></a>Cooper and the Elizabethan church</h2>Cooper was one of a number of Elizabethan bishops whose learning, hard work, and pastoral involvement shaped the church in England in the late sixteenth century&#151;one of those whose &#145;wainscoted face&#146;  (Marprelate, 71) may have expressed the strain of a long life often lived against the grain. He had withstood the onslaughts of Mary's reign, come to terms with a termagant wife, and devoted much of his life to sheer hard work. He served the University of Oxford well, but the church established in England in Elizabeth's reign was his real love. He served it in his writing and by his sermons, but above all by his ability to teach his clergy as he had initially taught his Magdalen pupils. There is a suspicion that his so-called grandeur was the shyness of a man unused to the heights to which he had been raised. He served his country not only by sitting on commissions and in the Lords, but also in the meticulous way in which he answered enquiries, whether about his &#145;exercises&#146; or about defence or recusants. Though Marprelate sought to smear him, his rigorous pastoral care and the quality of his writings and sermons suggest that the smear was unjustified.<br>
<br>Cooper died at Winchester on 29 April 1594. He was buried on the south side of the cathedral with an inscription, now removed, but whose words survive and suggest the profound respect in which he was held. His exercise of the office of a bishop commanded superlatives for learning, generosity, and vigilance. The conclusion to his pithy but elegant Latin obituary may be translated as proclaiming that &#145;the earth has covered his body but his spirit is above the stars, Heavenly souls enjoy a heavenly peace&#146;  (Foster, <span class="italic">Lincoln Episcopal Records</span>, xix). Cooper would have liked that.<br>
