<span class="headword">Phillips,  (Israel) Watts</span>  (1825&#150;1874), <span class="occ">playwright and designer</span>, of Irish extraction, was born on 16 November 1825 at Robert Street, Hoxton, Middlesex, the second son of Thomas Phillips (<i>d</i>. 1850), upholsterer and timber merchant, and his wife, Esther Ann Watts (<i>b</i>. 1800). He had an older brother, Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1834), four younger brothers, William Charles, Frederick William, Reginald (<i>d</i>. 1837), and Alfred Reginald, and two younger sisters, Esther Ann 
    (Annie; 1830&#150;1916)
   and Emma Watts (1837&#150;1922), a writer, and her brother's biographer. Possessing some knowledge of the Elizabethan dramatists, and knowing John Baldwin Buckstone, Louisa Cranstoun Nisbett, and other actors quite well, Watts Phillips, as he was always known, thought he would go on the stage, and chose Edinburgh as the scene of his d&eacute;but. He had shown, however, a predilection for caricature, and eventually persuaded by his father became, in 1837, one of the very few pupils of George Cruikshank, with whom he always maintained a firm friendship. He supported and counselled Cruikshank in his disputes with Dickens and the novelist Harrison Ainsworth over the artist's roles in various co-productions with them. Even in his own last years Phillips helped with fund-raising campaigns on Cruikshank's behalf.<br>
<br>While Phillips was being tutored by Cruikshank he was also getting to know the playwright and journalist Douglas Jerrold, Mark Lemon, editor of <span class="italic">Punch</span>, and Augustus Mayhew. By 1844 Phillips was helping Samuel Phelps to prepare the texts for a revival of <span class="italic">The Fatal Dowry</span>, <span class="italic">Rule a Wife and Have a Wife</span>, and <span class="italic">The City Madam</span> for productions at Sadler's Wells. Encouraged by his development as an artist under Cruikshank, Phillips went to Paris, where he rented a studio, took lessons, and tried to sell his sketches. The revolution of 1848 drove him to Brussels, and then to England in 1849. For the publisher David Bogue he designed <span class="italic">The History of an Accommodation Bill</span> (1850?), <span class="italic">How We Commenced Housekeeping</span>, <span class="italic">The Bloomers</span>, and <span class="italic">A Suit in Chancery</span>, which were all comic sketches with an accompanying story caption. He returned to Paris and became friends with many noted French artists and writers, and also acquired a knowledge of the French stage which afterwards stood him in good stead.<br>
<br>On the death of his father in 1850 Phillips returned to live in England permanently. On 7 June 1851, at St Matthew, City Road, Middlesex, he married Mary Elizabeth, daughter of William Mariner, a stockbroker&#151;presumably the Elizabeth mentioned unfavourably in his will of 1862. By the time he had drafted this will in Paris he was living with Caroline Huskisson (<i>b</i>. 1842/3), a novelist, daughter of John William Huskisson. They had four children: Gordon Watts (1859/60&#150;1900), Mary Roland (1860&#150;1929), Fairfax Balfour (<i>b</i>. 1861/2), and Leslie Latimer. His will aimed to protect Caroline and their children,<blockquote>and to prevent any portion of [his property] falling into the hands of the woman Elizabeth Phillips known as Lilly Phillips and of her child Basil of whom I am not the father and also of any other children she has had or may have by other men.</blockquote>Phillips stressed that he had no &#145;vindictive motive&#146;, but wanted to &#145;protect my property from the hands of one who when I lived with her made my life a misery on account of her ungovernable and most wicked temper&#146;  (will, 24 Dec 1862). He had married Caroline by the time of the census of 1871.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Watts Phillips was making his name in the arts. To <span class="italic">Diogenes</span> (1853&#150;4), a not very long-lived rival of <span class="italic">Punch</span>, he supplied many cartoons, writing in it under the signature &#145;The Ragged Philosopher&#146;. He also wrote <span class="italic">The Wild Tribes of London</span> (1855), an account of London slums and their inhabitants. Dramatized by Travers, it was staged at the City of London Theatre. In 1857 his play <span class="italic">Joseph Chavigny</span> was accepted by Benjamin Webster, and produced at the Adelphi in May, with Webster and Madame Celeste in the leading roles. Phillips's obituarist in <span class="italic">The Times</span> noted that <span class="italic">Chavigny</span> was &#145;remarkable for the high degree of cynicism which prevailed more or less through all his writings&#146;. Neither this piece nor <span class="italic">The Poor Strollers</span>, which followed, was very popular, though both were well received by critics.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Dead Heart</span>, produced at the Adelphi on 10 November 1859, with Webster, Mr Toole, David Fisher, and Mrs Alfred Mellon in the principal characters, was, however, a complete success. Some critics commented on how much <span class="italic">The Dead Heart</span> owed to <span class="italic">A Tale of Two Cities</span> and other works. If anything Dickens was indebted to Phillips's play for some crucial features of his novel, most notably a last-minute heroic substitution of one character for another at the guillotine during the French Revolution. Webster, who played the first Robert Landry, had read the play to Dickens during a visit by the novelist to Brighton early in 1857. The play held its own, and was revived by Henry Irving, who also took the part of Landry, at the Lyceum in 1893.<br>
<br>Phillips's <span class="italic">Paper Wings</span>, a comedy of city life, was played at the Adelphi by Mr and Mrs Alfred Wigan on 29 February 1860. <span class="italic">The Story of the '45</span>, with Webster, Toole, and Paul Bedford, followed at Drury Lane on 12 November. <span class="italic">His Last Victory</span>, a comedy, premi&egrave;red at the St James's on 21 June 1862. <span class="italic">Camilla's Husband</span> opened on 10 November 1862 at the Olympic, and was noteworthy as the last piece in which T. F. Robson, who played Dogbriar, appeared. Dickens saw the play in the days before Christmas of that year, calling it a &#145;very good play &hellip; very well played&#146; and noting &#145;real merit&#146; in the acting of Mr Neville and Miss Saville. <span class="italic">Paul's Return</span>, a domestic comedy, opened at the Princess's on 15 February 1864, prompting a critic in <span class="italic">The Times</span> to speculate in an otherwise favourable review that Phillips might have been borrowing without acknowledgement from a French source. Phillips, then in Paris, firmly denied any such foreign source in a letter to the editor that appeared on 20 February.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">A Woman in Mauve</span> was produced by Sothern at the Haymarket on 18 March 1865; this was followed by <span class="italic">Theodora, Actress and Temptress</span> at the Surrey on 9 April 1866, and <span class="italic">The Huguenot Captain</span> at the Princess's with Miss Neilson as the heroine on 2 July. The same actress also appeared in <span class="italic">Lost in London</span> on 16 March 1867 (a production of which was being performed at the Princess's at the time of Phillips's death). <span class="italic">Nobody's Child</span> appeared at the Surrey on 15 September, <span class="italic">Maud's Peril</span> at the Adelphi on 23 October, <span class="italic">Land Rats and Water Rats</span> at the Surrey on 8 September 1868, and <span class="italic">Amos Clark</span> at the Queen's in October 1872. Phillips also wrote <span class="italic">The Ticket-of-Leave Man</span> (not the drama of that name, but a farce played at the Adelphi), and several other plays, some of them not produced, written for and purchased by Webster. <span class="italic">Marlborough</span>, by which he set great store, was staged at Brighton on 21 October 1872. His dramas show both invention and command of dialogue.<br>
<br>Phillips's work as an illustrator had long been sacrificed to his occupation as writer. As a draughtsman he was remembered for the delicate designs with which he illustrated letters sent to friends. Many of these were reproduced in the biography written by his sister. Phillips also wrote for the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>. To <span class="italic">Town Talk</span> he contributed a novel, <span class="italic">The Honour of the Family</span>, afterwards issued as <span class="italic">Amos Clark</span> (1862), which became the play of the same name. Innumerable novels by him also appeared in the <span class="italic">Family Herald</span> and other periodicals. After visiting Edinburgh, where he supplied illustrations to Charles Mackay's <span class="italic">Whiskey Demon</span> (1860), he returned to Paris, where he frequently lived&#151;principally, it would seem, because of financial difficulties. Watts Phillips was a skilled mimic and dinner table raconteur, but was somewhat improvident. In October 1869, then living at Edenbridge, Kent, he filed for bankruptcy. On 2 December &#145;an order of discharge was granted without opposition &hellip; the debts were &pound;1,978; property in the hands of creditors stated at &pound;200&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 Dec 1869).<br>
<br>Phillips was ill for many months, died on 2 December 1874 at his home at 45 Redcliffe Road, Brompton, London, and was buried in Brompton cemetery on 8 December. Most of his plays were printed in Lacy's <span class="italic">Acting Edition of Plays</span> or in <span class="italic">Dicks' Standard Plays</span>.<br>
