<span class="headword">Logue,  Lionel George</span>  (1880&#150;1953), <span class="occ">speech therapist</span>, was born on 26 February 1880 in College Town, Adelaide, South Australia, the eldest of three children of George Edward Logue, clerk, and his wife, Lavinia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rankin. Logue was educated at Prince Alfred College, Adelaide, between 1889 and 1896, and studied elocution with Edward Reeves. As a Christian Scientist, Logue was dedicated to healing and had originally wanted to train as a doctor but soon realized that he did not like the sight of blood. Instead, in 1902, he became secretary and assistant teacher to Edward Reeves and also studied at the Elder Conservatorium of Music. For a while Logue's career changed direction and he moved to Western Australia to work with an electrical engineering firm at a goldmine in Kalgoorlie.<br>
<br>With the capital that he amassed from his engineering work Logue was able to return to his previous interest and he set up a school of elocution in Perth, where he taught elocution, public speaking, and acting. He enjoyed plays and reciting Shakespeare at concerts and founded a public speaking club. Logue also taught part time at the Young Men's Christian Association and later at Perth Technical School. It was during his residence in Perth that, on 20 March 1907 at St George's Anglican Cathedral, Logue married Myrtle Gruenert, a 21-year-old clerk, the eldest daughter of Francis Gruenert. They had three sons.<br>
<br>Logue came to speech therapy, like many other of his professional peers, during the First World War. He treated soldiers returned from fighting who were afflicted with a number of speech disorders as a result of shell-shock. Logue found that he had a special talent for the treatment of stammering and was said to have effected &#145;dramatic cures&#146;  (Judd, 97) on these soldiers. Logue's approach to the treatment of stammering was twofold, tackling both the psychological and physical aspects of the condition. He recognized the importance of building the patient's confidence and was always keen to stress that a cure could only be effected by the stammerers themselves. He used exercises to relax muscle tension, taught correct breathing, and also slowed the patient's rate of speech considerably.<br>
<br>In 1924 Logue and his family visited England for what was intended as a holiday. However, while staying in London he saw the possibilities of establishing a speech therapy practice in the capital and rented rooms at 146 Harley Street. Logue had no medical qualifications and, initially, little capital but he built up his practice steadily. The fees paid him by wealthier clients enabled him to treat poorer patients without charge.<br>
<br>Logue's association with his most famous client began in October 1925; he was present when the duke of York (later George VI) gave his closing speech as president of the British Empire Exhibition in which he stammered badly throughout. Logue is reported to have said to his son that he was sure that he could &#145;very nearly &hellip; manage a complete cure&#146;  (Bradford, 122). The duke was put in touch with Logue by Eileen Macleod, an eminent speech therapist, who when approached concerning treatment felt that a male therapist might be more effective. The first consultation took place on 19 October 1926 in Logue's rooms; despite an initial reluctance to attempt further therapy following several previous failures, the duke was deeply impressed by Logue's confidence and sincerity saying of him &#145;I wish I could have found him before, as now I know the right way to breathe my fear of talking will vanish&#146;  (Wheeler-Bennett, 214). He attended sessions almost daily for about two and a half months and strictly adhered to the exercises given to him by Logue which included intoning vowels by an open window and gargling with warm water. The treatment produced an almost instant improvement and while the duke still spoke slowly and deliberately his speech showed only occasional hesitations.<br>
<br>Logue was invaluable in preparing George VI for all his major speeches, using tongue twisters to aid practice and changing difficult words where necessary. He coached him in his responses for the coronation service on 12 May 1937, which he watched from a specially chosen seat in Westminster Abbey, and prepared the king for the live broadcast that evening and during which George VI did not stammer at all. During the Second World War, Logue frequently attended the king before most of his speech making engagements and broadcasts and it was often noted that his slow and measured pace while speaking added to the impact of his delivery. He continued to advise the king until the latter's death in February 1952. The only formal recognition of Logue's service to George VI was the ribbon of the Royal Victorian Order (elevated to CVO in 1944) presented to him by the king on the evening before his coronation. His friendship with George VI was said to be &#145;the greatest pleasure of Logue's life&#146;  (<span class="italic">AusDB</span>, 117).<br>
<br>Logue's contribution to the speech therapy profession was significant. He was a pioneer of work with shell-shocked soldiers, many of whom stammered as a result of their trauma. He was also active in the founding of the College of Speech Therapists, which was formed in 1945 when the British Society of Speech Therapists, of which Logue was a founder in 1935, and the Association of Speech Therapists were unified. Logue became a fellow enrolled on foundation and indeed it was he who, in 1948, wrote to George VI requesting his royal patronage, which was duly granted.<br>
<br>Logue was a freemason and was speech therapist to the Royal Masonic School in Bushey. His practice shrank during the Second World War and during the war he regularly acted as an air-raid warden. Logue's wife died in 1945 and he took up spiritualism. He retained his love of music and the theatre and also enjoyed gardening and walking.<br>
<br>Logue died of pneumonia on 12 April 1953 at his home, 68 Princes Court, Brompton Road, London, following a prolonged illness and was cremated. He was survived by his three sons.<br>
