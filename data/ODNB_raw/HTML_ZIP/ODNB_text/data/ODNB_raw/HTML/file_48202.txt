<span class="headword">Spagnoletti,  Charles Ernest Paolo  della Diana</span>  (1832&#150;1915), <span class="occ">electrical inventor</span>, was born at Brompton, London, on 12 July 1832, the eldest son of Ernesto Spagnoletti, a musician, and his wife, Charlotte, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stohwasser (1809&#150;1901). The family was descended from the ancient Italian noble house of della Diana. The surname Spagnoletti originated as a variant of Spagnoletto, a nickname bestowed on one of his ancestors. Charles attended Blemmell House School, Brompton, until the age of fourteen, when he left to take up a post in the National Debt Office. After a few months he became a pupil of the electrical and telegraph engineer Alexander Bain. In 1847 Spagnoletti joined the Electric Telegraph Company, and in 1855 became telegraph superintendent of the Great Western Railway (GWR) at a salary of &pound;100 per annum. His main achievement there was to introduce the block system whereby train movements were controlled by electric telegraph. Following a serious illness, he retired from the GWR in 1892, but remained consulting electrical engineer to the company. Spagnoletti made many electrical inventions. Besides signalling and telegraph equipment, he designed bells, bridges, clocks, and a fire alarm, all worked by electricity. He installed the first electric light at several London termini, and advised on the use of electricity at the Crystal Palace. For Ascot racecourse he designed a board to show the starters, winners, and prices. In 1890 the City and South London Railway, acting on Spagnoletti's advice, became Britain's first electric underground railway. He was also consultant to the London Electrical Omnibus Company, and invented a new system of road building, using pre-cast concrete blocks, which was widely used by the London county council.<br>
<br>After leaving the GWR, Spagnoletti became managing director of the Phonophore Company, and worked on telephone development. Following the act of 1868 to nationalize the telegraph system, Spagnoletti had advised the government on the compensation to be paid. In 1872 he became a founder member of the Society of Telegraph Engineers, served on its council from 1874 to 1880, and as its vice-president from 1880 to 1884. Meanwhile the title had been changed to the Society of Telegraph Engineers and Electricians, and it was of that body that Spagnoletti became president in 1885. In 1912 he was made an honorary member of the society's successor, the Institution of Electrical Engineers. He had become a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1875, and belonged to several other scientific bodies. In 1884 he was elected president of the Conference of Railway Companies' Telegraph Superintendents. From 1878, when he served as a member of the international jury on electrical exhibits at the Paris Universal Exhibition, he was much involved in work of this type.<br>
<br>Spagnoletti continued the musical interests of his father and grandfather. He wrote and composed many songs, and had a good tenor voice. When Sir William Preece showed the first Edison phonograph at a meeting of the Society of Telegraph Engineers in 1878, Spagnoletti sang the national anthem into it. He was one of the first supporters of the Electro-Harmonic Society. As &#145;Mr Sprigalilly&#146; he appears in Simmons's <span class="italic">Memoirs of a Station Master</span>. The portrait is vivid and malicious, but not necessarily accurate. In 1853 Spagnoletti married a widow, Caroline Charlotte Duffield (1829&#150;1903), daughter of Robert Vincent Dawson, a veterinary surgeon. They had two sons and three daughters. Spagnoletti died of pneumonia on 28 June 1915 at 16 Frognal Lane, Hampstead, where he had lived for more than ten years. He was buried on 2 July at Hampstead cemetery. At least four other members of the family made careers in electricity. They were Charles's son, James, his brother, Hylton, his great-nephew, Philip, and Philip's son, Robert. When in 1907, James transformed his business into a private company, he gave &pound;2000 worth of shares from his own allocation to his father, who thus became the second largest shareholder.<br>
