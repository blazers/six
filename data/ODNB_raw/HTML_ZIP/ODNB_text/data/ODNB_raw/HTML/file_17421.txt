<span class="headword">Macdonald,  Alexander, of Glencoe</span> <span class="st"> [Alasdair Maciain; <em>called </em>Alasdair Ruaidh]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1692), <span class="occ">clan chief and victim of massacre</span>, was probably born in Glencoe between the early 1620s and early 1630s, the son of Alexander Macdonald 
    (Alasdair Maciain; <i>d</i>. in or after 1657)
  , who by 1627 was chief (reputedly eleventh chief) of a branch of the clan Donald inhabiting Glencoe in Lorn, Argyll. Tradition asserts that he was educated in Paris, one of several indications that the clan were Roman Catholics, although it has also been suggested that they were episcopalians. Since the mid-sixteenth century Glencoe had been owned by the Campbells, earls of Argyll, whose policy was to prevent the Macdonalds from gaining legally secure rights to their lands. During the civil wars the latter were among the clans which rose unsuccessfully under the marquess of Montrose against the Campbells, but they avoided vengeance afterwards. The later tradition of a constant Macdonald&#150;Campbell feud is groundless. Between local and national crises, they linked themselves by bonds of manrent (clientage), friendship, business, and marriage. Similarly, the glen was not the inaccessible robbers' nest of myth. Like other clans in the area the Glencoe Macdonalds were notorious for cattle raiding and robbery, but Argyll was still able to use its rents for security in deeds and peacefully lease out its woods. The scale of violence decreased until, in the later seventeenth century, except in time of wars, cattle raiding was perpetrated by small groups of displaced caterans (marauders) and chiefs could profit (perhaps not always honestly) from supplying the watches against them.<br>
<br>Alexander Macdonald (sometimes called Alasdair Ruaidh on account of his red hair, but most usually known as Maciain) succeeded his father as putative twelfth chief some time after January 1657, when the two men signed a bond of friendship with Sir John Campbell of Glenorchy and his eldest son, John Campbell (1635&#150;1716). Intended to guard against repetition of heavy gentry casualties such as the Campbells had sustained in the 1640s, the bond agreed that there would be mutual warning of impending danger. By the early 1660s Maciain had married: clan tradition that his wife was the daughter of Archibald Gillespie (<i>d</i>. 1683), chief of the Macdonalds of Keppoch, seems implausible owing to the youth of the latter's sons when he died, and no plausible alternative has been advanced. At any rate, Maciain and his wife had two sons, John (Iain) and Alexander (Alasdair) Og, who were serving soldiers in 1685 and married by 1692.<br>
<br>In 1665 Maciain, who of the two hundred or so families in the clan could send about one hundred men to war, dispatched a contingent to support Ewen Cameron of Lochiel in his confrontation over lands with Lauchlan Mackintosh of Torcastle; this dispute was settled peaceably. East highland cattle raiding by some of the inhabitants of Glencoe rendered Argyll, as owner, and John Campbell, as temporary lessee, liable to pay the resulting penalties and in 1673 Argyll sold on the glen to Sir James Campbell of Lawers. That year Maciain, still an established local figure, was able to visit the Inveraray justice eyre even after substituting the wrong defendant in one trial. However, soon after, and probably not for the only time, he murdered two of his own clansmen, according to tradition because they had informed on a cattle raid. However bad the affair, he could have disposed of opponents with a veneer of legality had he possessed the judicial rights enjoyed by many other chiefs. Since he lacked them, it was probably for this crime that Argyll imprisoned him at Inveraray, but he escaped, and in April 1674 the privy council reported that he had committed several murders and robberies since. The affair was soon lost in the greater disruption caused by Argyll's campaign to dispossess the Maclean chiefs of their estate and the Maclean&#150;Macdonald resistance, but Edinburgh lawyers dwelt on the worst highland atrocities to justify extending their cumbersome and costly system there in all matters. One of them, Sir John Dalrymple, remembered the story: he still referred to &#145;the murderer McIain&#146; in 1692  (NL Scot., MS 7014, fol. 8).<br>
<br>The Maclean&#150;Macdonald coalition's struggle of 1674&#150;80 against Argyll ended in defeat, but in the meantime it had enabled an adroit chief like Maciain and his clan to profit considerably through offering protection to some of the Campbells. The clan's raiding against other Campbells increased so enormously that Argyll determined to buy back the glen from Lawers, evict the clan (who, he believed, neglected farming for robbery), and plant it with honest tenants; but he lacked the money. Meanwhile, on the other side, many Glencoe men served for pay in John Campbell's highland company, and some fought for him against the Caithness Sinclairs in 1680. If a letter printed in 1817 is genuine, a large contingent also accompanied the highland host in plundering the richer lowland west: they were not John Campbell's men, but he dared not leave them behind near his undefended estates.<br>
<br>In 1680 Maciain was one of two men who acted as executors to Angus (Aeneas), Lord Macdonell and Aros, an officially recognized position of trust. A formidable figure, well over 6 feet high, he was still strong and active in old age, with his beard curled in horns. A contemporary's description, &#145;much loved by his neighbours &hellip; a person of great integrity, honour, good-nature and courage&#146;  (MacKnight, 321), is corroborated by the bards' praise for him as a wise chief and counsellor, although the context was the edge of legality. A peaceful period was broken in 1685 by Argyll's rebellion, during which Maciain and both his sons served on the government side. Like many others from the general down, they plundered widely and fairly indiscriminately. Glencoe was sold in 1687 to the Tutor of Appin, chief of the Stewarts, Glencoe's western neighbours. He wanted their fighting men as vassals, to make the Stewarts a powerful clan. This gave greater practical security of tenure. Maciain in 1688 sent sixty men who, with other clan contingents, joined Macdonald of Keppoch in opposing his oppressive landlord, Mackintosh, in the last private clan battle, Mulroy.<br>
<br>When the Jacobite rising of John Graham, Viscount Dundee, broke out in 1689, Maciain joined it, serving with the Stewarts. During Dundee's abortive Strathspey campaign, he plundered Williamite enemies, but he tried to restrain a Maclean contingent which had begun plundering friendly inhabitants&#151;until a second-sighted man warned him of the dragoons about to attack the Macleans, and he retired. The Appin and Glencoe men were not at Killiecrankie, since a force under the tenth earl of Argyll was advancing towards their country. It fled at the news, and Maciain and his men joined the highland army, commanded after Dundee's death by Major-General Cannon, for an uninspired campaign and the defeat at Dunkeld. He was one of the chiefs who on 24 August, before they dispersed, signed a bond promising to reassemble.<br>
<br>In October Glencoe men were in one party sent out by Cannon to destroy the castle at Achallader of John Campbell, by this time earl of Breadalbane, in order to prevent the government from establishing a garrison, and in another which ravaged Glenlyon, thus preventing the laird, Robert Campbell, from redeeming his estates from the marquess of Atholl. Victorian writers deduced that this made Breadalbane and Glenlyon specially vindictive against the Macdonalds of Glencoe. In reality, Breadalbane knew they had acted under orders; in November, he privately praised Maciain's forbearance towards Campbells on a spectacular raid down Loch Lomond. Glenlyon blamed Atholl.<br>
<br>In February 1690 Maciain was among the chiefs who signed a letter to King James promising to fight on following the arrival of a new Jacobite commander, Major-General Thomas Buchan. His second son, Alasdair Og, became a captain in Buchan's new regiment, and took part in the spring campaign which ended disastrously at Cromdale. That autumn, the enemy closed in. A force under Argyll captured the Stewarts' castle, and would next have overrun Glencoe had a crisis not diverted it to Mull. Most ordinary Glencoe clansmen submitted to Colonel John Hill, the honest governor of the new Fort William; by May 1691 Maciain was considering it.<br>
<br>The next month, as part of a government initiative to end the war, Breadalbane offered the chiefs, gathered at Achallader, money to buy out troublesome feudal superiorities over them, in return for taking the oaths to King William before the sheriffs in the shire towns by a deadline finally extended to 1 January 1692. The Glencoe men had previously helped Breadalbane frighten away an intruding presbyterian minister, but when Maciain attended at Achallader, the earl quarrelled with him and threatened him over stolen cattle; Maciain later said that he feared a mischief from nobody so much. Yet Breadalbane obtained for him the promise of &pound;150 to buy the superiority of Glencoe and pardon for the murder. The earl's selfish but constructive plans, for a huge highland militia with himself as general (and including a Glencoe contingent camouflaged under the Tutor's name), depended on a total and genuine pacification.<br>
<br>However, Breadalbane's political enemies subsequently tempted the major chiefs into posturing about fighting on with insincere promises of larger rewards: Alasdair Macdonell of Glengarry was the most extreme, and Maciain probably followed him blindly, distracted by talk of the Catholic chiefs going abroad rather than taking the oaths. He failed to check the procedure, though the second-sighted man's prophecy that he would be killed in his own house frightened him. In the event, more because of fear of a government campaign of repression than because of King James's belated authorization, just before the deadline, the chiefs rushed to submit. On 31 December 1691 Maciain appeared at Fort William, wrongly supposing that Hill was entitled to administer the oath. Hill sent him off to Inveraray with a recommendation. Immediately afterwards, Glengarry offered terms for surrender, which, verbal mention but not the document made clear, were intended to protect Maciain also. Maciain hurried southwards through the snow. He encountered Argyll's regiment marching to Fort William, and Captain Thomas Drummond briefly detained him. Only on 6 January 1692, after desperate pleading, did he take the oath before sheriff-depute Sir Colin Campbell of Ardkinglass. Returning, he found that Argyll's regiment had stayed one night in Glencoe without harming it.<br>
<br>However, news of Maciain's belated submission did not reach secretary of state Sir John Dalrymple. A false report that he had submitted on time was corrected by Argyll, but not superseded by the truth. When Dalrymple realized that Glengarry, having a castle, might defeat a midwinter attack, and that his surrender should therefore be accepted, he selected as an alternative scapegoat Maciain, whom he saw as a murderer, at the head of people who were cattle thieves and papists. Therefore, instructions to Hill (duplicated to Major-General Sir Thomas Livingstone) on the surrender terms, drafted by Dalrymple and signed by William on 16 January, included the observation that &#145;it will be a proper vindication of public justice to extirpate that sect [sept] of thieves&#146;  (Gordon, 65). Dalrymple's covering letters, demanding that for &#145;a just example of vengeance&#146; they should &#145;be rooted out in earnest&#146;  (ibid., 66), made clear his personal enthusiasm.<br>
<br>Hill, himself politically vulnerable, knew that the Glencoe men had submitted and had rights to protection, but dared not oppose Dalrymple openly. Livingstone, in the same position, also hated the Glencoe men and despised Hill. On 23 January 1692 he sent an order for the attack to Hill's scheming lieutenant-colonel, James Hamilton. Hill, while passively hoping for a countermand, let Hamilton and Major Robert Duncanson, commanding Argyll's regiment, plan the attack. They introduced the outrageous idea that troops quartered on the inhabitants should slaughter their hosts. On 1 February 1692 two companies under Captain Campbell of Glenlyon, who did not know the plan, and Captain Drummond, who probably did, entered Glencoe, reassured the Macdonalds, and were quartered among the settlements&#151;technically a penalty for unpaid taxes, but they were treated, and behaved, as guests. Maciain had a dozen in his house. He sent away the unmarried girls and, fearing a disarmament, hid the clan's weapons elsewhere; otherwise, the mutual duties highland hospitality traditionally imposed seemed sufficient protection.<br>
<br>On 12 February Hamilton arranged a rendezvous in Glencoe at 7 a.m. the next day with Duncanson, quartered nearby. Duncanson wrote secretly that evening to Glenlyon, ordering him at 5 a.m. &#145;to fall upon the Rebells, the McDonalds of Glenco, and putt all to the sword under seventy. you are to have a speciall care that the old Fox and his sones doe upon no account escape your hands &hellip;&#146;  (NL Scot., Adv. MS 23.6.24). Threatened with dismissal and ruin, Glenlyon decided to obey and dissembled, accepting Maciain's invitation to dinner the next day. A blizzard arose.<br>
<br>Between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. on 13 February Lieutenant John Lindsay, Ensign Lundie, and soldiers from Glenlyon's company arrived at Maciain's house, in Polveig. As he rose from his bed to greet them, they shot him in the back, killing him, pulled the body outside by the heels and left it lying naked. His wife tried to dress and escape, but the soldiers stripped her naked and pulled her rings off her fingers with their teeth. Her sons found her, but, like other Glencoe women, she died of exposure and ill treatment that day or the next. Several of the clan gentry were also murdered; perhaps thirty-eight men and half a dozen women and children in all. Maciain's sons and their families, warned by suspicious servants, escaped. Duncanson's two-hour anticipation of Hamilton's arrival, other changes in his order, and the raging blizzard allowed the inhabitants to escape through the unguarded passes out of the glen, though an unknown number, especially women and children, died of exposure. The troops burnt the houses and departed with all the clan's livestock and moveable property. When they dared return, the survivors buried Maciain in Eilean Munde, their burial isle in the glen's sea loch.<br>
<br>The news hastened the submissions of other chiefs. Breadalbane, almost alone, was shocked enough to declare his innocence, but this merely increased suspicions of his guilt. Hill, recovering his courage, began applying for permission to resettle the survivors in Glencoe, but even when Dalrymple heard the full truth, he suggested sending them to Ireland, the plantations, or anywhere else in Scotland. Hill applied elsewhere, and in August 1692 received permission to allow them back.<br>
<br>Although totally impoverished, the clan, under Maciain's son John Macdonald (<i>d</i>. after 1710) as chief, remained quiet. In 1695, he and other survivors testified before the parliamentary inquiry into the massacre, but their appeal for compensation had almost no result. Some prosperity probably returned about 1706. In 1711, ownership of the glen was transferred to the Stewart chief, Appin. Argyll was still the latter's superior, but Stewart ownership created a protective buffer. Indeed, the Argyll family by then were treating their rebel vassals more mildly than the state did Jacobite landowners. Alexander Macdonald, John's son and successor, who joined the 1715 rising but submitted early, fairly soon regained practical control of the glen; and it was not long lost to the family even after he also joined Prince Charles Edward in 1745. A member of the prince's council, he was afterwards imprisoned until 1749.<br>
