<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Townsend,  Charles Harrison</span>  (1851&#150;1928), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 13 May 1851 in Birkenhead, Cheshire, the son of Jackson Townsend, solicitor, and his wife, Pauline, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14653/', "Felix Yaniewicz")</script>, a well-known Polish violinist; he had five brothers and one sister. After attending Birkenhead School, he was articled to the architect Walter Scott of Liverpool from 1867 to 1872. From 1873 to 1875 he was a draughtsman in the office of Charles Barry, and in 1875 he joined Edward Robert Robson's office at the recently formed London school board. In the same year he made the first of many visits to Europe, to which he returned throughout his life, especially to northern Italy, where he developed a lifelong interest in architectural mosaics.<br>
<br>In 1877 Townsend started practice on his own in London, and between 1884 and 1886 was in partnership with Thomas Lewis Banks. When the partnership was dissolved he moved his office to 29 Great George Street, Westminster, where it remained for the rest of his life. In 1888 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects. He also designed furniture and wallpaper and was elected, also in 1888, to the Art-Workers' Guild, of which he was to be an enthusiastic and devoted member, and which provided his main circle of friends; he was elected master of the guild for the year 1903.<br>
<br>Until 1892 Townsend's practice was made up of minor domestic and ecclesiastical work, but in that year he won the competition for the design of the Bishopsgate Institute, the first of the three outstanding public buildings that were to make his reputation. In 1897 he was commissioned to design the Whitechapel Art Gallery and the Horniman Museum in Lewisham, south London, both of which were completed in 1901. These were exceptionally original buildings, and belonged to no recognizable architectural tradition. Writing in 1900, the German architect and critic Hermann Muthesius identified as one of the most significant developments in European architecture the tendency of certain British architects towards what he described as a &#145;modern&#146; style, which referred to no tradition, and created a new architectural language of space and mass. Foremost among the representatives of this new school he placed Townsend, whom, next to Charles Voysey, he regarded as one of &#145;the prophets of the new style&#146;  (H. Muthesius, <span class="italic">Die englische Baukunst der Gegenwart</span>, 1, 1900, 30).<br>
<br>Although the unquestionable and striking originality, particularly of the last two buildings, made this a valid assessment in 1900, Townsend never again produced anything of equal quality. After 1901 his practice was limited to relatively uninteresting private houses in southern England. Why he did not sustain the promise of the works of the 1890s is not clear, though it is certainly connected with the change to a much more conservative and less experimental architectural climate in Britain in the 1900s, when there was a revival of baroque and French Renaissance architecture; it may also be to do with Townsend's own equivocal and confused attitude towards the value of architectural traditions.<br>
<br>In 1915 Townsend was appointed assistant director of the London county council's civic survey, a scheme to employ architects deprived of work by the war in the collection of social and physical data on the structure of the city. In 1917 he was employed as a Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve lieutenant in Avonmouth on the dazzle-painting of ships. In 1918 he virtually ceased to practise, and in the early 1920s moved to live with his sister in Northwood, Middlesex, where he died, at his house, 30 Murray Road, on 26 December 1928. He never married and had no children. He is said to have been convivial, widely knowledgeable, with a fertile imagination and a whimsical sense of humour. His most regular companions were artists, several of whom, such as Walter Crane, Sir George Frampton, and Robert Anning Bell, collaborated with him on his buildings.<br>
