<span class="headword">Colville,  James</span>, first Lord Colville of Culross  (<em>c.</em>1551&#150;1629), <span class="occ">soldier and diplomat</span>, was the first son of Sir James Colville, (<i>b</i>. 1532?, <i>d</i>. in or before 1562), laird of Easter Wemyss, and his wife, Janet, daughter of Sir Robert Douglas of Lochleven. He was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6010/', "Sir James Colville")</script> of Ochiltree and Easter Wemyss (<i>d</i>. 1540). Like many of the Fife gentry at this time Colville was a committed Calvinist and spent his younger years fighting for the Reformation in Scotland and France. In 1567 he reportedly accompanied the earl of Moray to France, where he attached himself to the Huguenot cause, subsequently becoming a lifelong friend of the future Henri IV. By 1569 he had returned to Scotland to fight as a staunch supporter of the king's men in the civil war. In 1570 he married Isabel, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24372/', "Patrick Ruthven, third Lord Ruthven (c.1520&#150;1566)")</script>, and his first wife, Jean or Janet Douglas; they had two sons. In 1572 Colville participated in the Leith convention that conferred the regency on James Douglas, earl of Morton.<br>
<br>Colville spent time in both Scotland and France during the following years, returning from France on 27 July 1582 with letters from Henri and the prince de Cond&eacute; which, among other things, apparently warned against Esm&eacute; Stewart and other crypto-Catholics who then dominated the young James VI and his government. A month later Colville participated in the Calvinist <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> that would subsequently be known as the Ruthven raid. The counter-revolution that followed in June 1583 prompted Colville to flee to France, but by September he had returned, made his peace with the king, and obtained pardon. By 1586 he had earned the king's confidence sufficiently to be sent on an embassy to France &#145;and other places beyond the sea&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 4.127). In 1589 he went as ambassador to England, and James's description of him as &#145;my trusty and familiar servant&#146; was doubtless more than simply formulaic  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 13.408). Still, his efforts to achieve the grand promises made by Elizabeth at the height of the armada crisis, his prime charge, were unsuccessful, and the mission was generally regarded as having &#145;wrought little good&#146;&#151;a circumstance that caused him considerable political embarrassment in Scotland  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 10.72). Despite this failure Colville again served as Scottish ambassador to England and also to France in 1594, a mission successful at least in its French objectives. A further mission to France was mooted in 1597 and again in 1598 but probably did not take place. Colville was generally recognized as the key figure in Scottish-French relations, and the individual who restored Scotland's &#145;ancient&#146; privileges there.<br>
<br>In spite of his abiding French connections Colville was rightly perceived by contemporaries as one of the most resolute members of the English party in Scotland. He was constantly in touch with the English court, especially with Francis Walsingham, at one point suggesting to Walsingham that he would &#145;be les suspectit&#146; if he travelled from Paris directly to Scotland rather than via England  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 7.210). His strenuous opposition to James's Danish match actually placed him in physical danger from the Edinburgh merchants. On his return to Scotland in 1589 he began raising troops for Henri's service, and eventually joined the king with a force of some 1500 Scottish soldiers. He served briefly as the military governor of St Val&eacute;ry. Yet in December 1595, with the prospect of a second armada invasion, he also offered to help Elizabeth defend England with &#145;a band of gentlemen his friends of good action&#146;  (ibid., 12.74). Immediately after the 1589 mission to England, Colville had written a memorandum in which he claimed, &#145;I shal insist withe his majestie for the ferm unioun of the realmes&#146;  (ibid., 10.72). Colville's commitment to both England and France (and to a French marriage for James) did not strike him or his contemporaries as in any way incompatible. Still less did they appear inconsistent with his Scottish identity. The Reformation gave coherence to all of these endeavours and Colville's ideological priorities are beyond doubt&#151;steadily worsening his financial circumstances to a point verging on catastrophe by 1601. Meanwhile, his first wife having died, Colville had married some time before 1599 Helen Schaw, widow of Robert Mowbray of Barnbougle. His younger, but by 1595 only surviving son from his first marriage, Robert Colville (<i>d</i>. 1614), married after 24 September 1603 Christian Bruce; it was their son James Colville (1604&#150;1654) who was to be Colville's eventual heir.<br>
<br>Colville's best opportunity to press for a &#145;ferm unioun&#146; between England and Scotland came with the 1603 union of crowns. Made Lord Colville in 1604 and an occasional participant on the Scottish privy council, he played arguably his most important, if least documented, role as a promoter of King James's British vision. In 1607 and 1608 the government orchestrated a famous test case intended to establish the right of Scots born after the regnal union to inherit property in England. Such right of inheritance was claimed for Colville's three-year-old grandson James, and it is impossible that Colville was other than instrumental in the government's strategy. Raising the case had proved no easy matter, for the English approached the question only with great reluctance, and contemporaries at court spoke of &#145;all the difficulties in reducing [the issue] &hellip; to a public judgement&#146;&#151;&#145;the judges misliked any fiction to be used in a case of such consequence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 19.275). The government faced a real problem, and Colville's part in its solution cannot have been incidental or trivial. The case&#151;known in English legal records as <i>Robert Calvin's case</i> (Calvin being a corruption of Colvil or Colvin, and Robert a conflation of the child with his father)&#151;assumed major importance for three reasons: it raised fundamental constitutional issues about the connection between the person of the king and the fabric of the law, and it defined British citizenship for the next two centuries; but, for the king and Colville, it was virtually the last direct effort to create a genuinely British polity.<br>
<br>Subsequently, Colville attended the parliaments of 1609 and 1612, the 1625 convention, and, it seems, the 1618 Perth assembly. He also sought to maintain the coherence and privileges of the Scots guards in France, making trips there for that purpose in 1611 and 1623. Colville is said to have died at his home in Tillicoultry, Clackmannanshire, from a fall, in September 1629. His widow was living in August 1630.<br>
