<span class="headword">Hatton,  Denys George  Finch-</span>  (1887&#150;1931), <span class="occ">settler in Kenya and lover of Karen Blixen</span>, was born on 24 April 1887 at 22 Prince of Wales Terrace, Kensington, London, the younger son of Henry Stormont Finch-Hatton, thirteenth earl of Winchilsea (1852&#150;1927) and Annie Jane (<i>d</i>. 1924), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5797/', "Sir Henry John Codrington KCB (1808&#150;1877)")</script>, admiral of the fleet, and his first wife, Helen Jane Smith. His father's brother was Harold Heneage Finch-Hatton. With his parents, elder sister, and brother he lived in a dower house on the Haverholme estate, near Sleaford, Lincolnshire, when family finances permitted. At Eton College (1900&#150;06) he gained a reputation for charm and easy success in sport and music, but he failed to gain the scholarship to Balliol which he expected, and went up instead to Brasenose, from where he graduated BA in 1910 with a fourth-class degree in modern history and a golf blue.<br>
<br>In the same year Finch-Hatton sailed for British East Africa, reaching Nairobi in 1911. With uncertain finances and no experience of business or farming his aims were unclear, but he was immediately fascinated by the country and its people. He bought farmland at Sosiani (later Eldoret) and Naivasha and traded on a small scale, but his plans, such as they were, were disrupted by the First World War. He joined the East Africa Protectorate forces in 1914 as a temporary captain and saw action in the guerrilla war against General von Lettow-Vorbeck's troops with the force raised by his close friend Berkeley Cole known as Cole's Scouts. He served with distinction, being mentioned in dispatches and awarded the Military Cross. He was later ordered to Mesopotamia where in 1918 he joined the Royal Flying Corps and qualified as a pilot before returning to Kenya after the end of the war.<br>
<br>In 1918 Finch-Hatton first met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63464/', "Karen Blixen (1885&#150;1962)")</script>, then the wife of Baron Bror von Blixen-Finecke and a struggling coffee farmer; later she became a famous writer under various names including Isak Dinesen. They quite openly became lovers before the Blixens formally separated: indeed at one point the two men used the same bedroom in the Blixen house between safaris. After her husband's departure Finch-Hatton moved his possessions into her house, which he regarded as his home. Suggestions that theirs was a companionate relationship, fostered by Blixen's great discretion in her writings, are refuted by Blixen's manuscripts, which show that she twice thought herself pregnant by Finch-Hatton  (Thurman, 174, 208). To her disappointment, but not his, her expectations ended in miscarriage or the realization that she had been mistaken, and both died childless. Many of their circle expected them to marry after Blixen's divorce was finalized in 1925, but the marriage never took place. From about 1924 Finch-Hatton increasingly turned to leading safaris for a living. His talents for meticulous organization and hunting itself were widely admired, and in 1928 and 1930 he led the prince of Wales on highly successful safaris. His success as a guide enhanced his own reputation, but strained his relationship with Blixen as it prolonged his absences from her farm and cut her off from his life, particularly when, as with the prince of Wales's safaris, he worked with her former husband and his new wife, or when he led parties interested principally in photography. She shared his enthusiasm for hunting, but not photography. Their affair ended in a bitter quarrel in 1931 shortly before his death and her departure for Denmark.<br>
<br>Though a friend of Lord Delamere (they shared a bungalow after the war) Finch-Hatton took little part in the debate surrounding east Africa's destiny as a white settler or an African colony. His own rather desultory efforts at farming suggest he was little moved by the notion of a settler colony. He was more concerned with the great expansion of hunting. He condemned the indiscriminate slaughter practised by many hunters (for example in an article in <span class="italic">The Times</span> of 21 January 1928), but it was the excess, not the killing <i>per se</i> which he disliked. He advocated shooting with the camera as a means of combining the excitement of hunting while conserving game stocks, though such photographic hunts still involved considerable slaughter.<br>
<br>In 1930 Finch-Hatton took out from England a Gipsy Moth aircraft, partly for the sheer enjoyment, but also to locate animals for his safaris, a practice employed by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40688/', "Beryl Markham (1902&#150;1986)")</script>, the pioneer aviator with whom he was having an affair and who might have been carrying his child  (Wheeler, 234). He and his passenger, his African servant, died when his aircraft crashed at Voi on 14 May 1931 shortly after taking off. He was buried later that month high in the Ngong hills, a place chosen earlier by him and Blixen as their graves. Finch-Hatton's brother later erected an obelisk on the spot. A stone bridge designed by Lutyens was erected in his memory by his school contemporaries at Eton.<br>
<br>Finch-Hatton is best known through Karen Blixen's <span class="italic">Out of Africa</span> (1st edn 1937) and <span class="italic">Shadows on the Grass</span> (1960) and especially in the film version of the former (1985, script Kurt Luedtke, direction Sydney Pollack), in which Robert Redford played Finch-Hatton to Meryl Streep's Blixen. In her book Blixen portrays their relationship as one of equals: he shares her home and hospitality, and in return reveals the landscape to her on safari and from the air. They share equally in the triumphs of hunting and simultaneously appreciate the pleasures of European civilization and empathize with Africa and its people. He teaches her Latin and to read the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and the Greek poets, and she describes how he knew great parts of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> by heart and how he had the <span class="roman">Bible</span> with him on all his journeys. He reveals to her pleasure in music and fine wine: she provides stories, and fine china, food, and glass. The film script and Errol Trzebinski's <span class="italic">Silence will Speak</span>, on which it is based, are less sympathetic. Finch-Hatton dictates the nature of their relationship, appearing when it suits him, but rejecting the more permanent ties she seeks after her estrangement from her husband. Blixen is a social climber whose jealousy ultimately drives away Finch-Hatton. Subsequent archival research has revealed how far her farm, to which she clung desperately, depended on his financial support. He was universally thought captivating, both physically (he was tall, slim, and handsome, though his blond hair fell out prematurely, leading him to adopt a characteristic blue bowler hat to hide his baldness) and in personality (his taste and cultivation set him apart from most of his contemporaries). Blixen describes him and his companion Berkeley Cole as outcasts:<blockquote>It was not a society that had thrown them out, and not any place in the world either, but time had done it, they did not belong to their century. No other nation than the English could have produced them, but they were examples of atavism, and theirs was an earlier England, a world which no longer existed. In the present epoch they had no home, but had got to wander here and there &hellip; He did cut a figure &hellip; but it did not quite fit in anywhere. (Blixen, 184, 186)</blockquote>She captures the contradictions of a man who continues to arouse sympathetic curiosity, despite having left few marks.<br>
