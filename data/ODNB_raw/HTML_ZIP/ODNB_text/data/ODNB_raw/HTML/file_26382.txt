<span class="headword">Stephens,  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1799, <em>d.</em> 1851), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born in Chelsea, London, and baptized at St Luke's, Chelsea, on 2 January 1799. He was the son of Hugh Stephens and his wife, Anne. Although he evidently had some education, nothing is known of his early life, except that he evinced an interest in writing, especially dramatic composition, from late boyhood. His earliest publication, an unacted tragedy entitled <span class="italic">The Vampire</span> (1821), was written in association with Hugo John Belfour, under the pseudonym St John Dorset. This was followed by a further collaboration in the same terms, <span class="italic">Montezuma, a Tragedy in Five Acts, and other Poems</span> (1822), the second edition of which was dedicated to William Charles Macready.<br>
<br>In 1835 Stephens's three-volume romance <span class="italic">The Manuscripts of Erd&eacute;ly</span> attracted some attention for its imaginative qualities and erudition, but his second novel, <span class="italic">P&egrave;re la Chaise, or, The Confessor</span> (1840), was a comparative failure. Stephens's main aspiration was to be a dramatist. Although self-characterized as of a retiring disposition, he was keen to be introduced to leading playwrights of the day. William Charles Macready, whom Stephens liked to think of as a friend, introduced him to Thomas Talfourd in 1837, and he also made the acquaintance of James Sheridan Knowles, Robert Browning, and Bulwer Lytton. His first solo tragedy, <span class="italic">Gertrude and Beatrice, or, The Queen of Hungary</span> (3 editions, 1839), set in thirteenth-century Buda, was heavily Elizabethanized in style and difficult to penetrate. Macready, whose opinion was solicited on its suitability for stage production, commented: &#145;Went through [the play] with some attention, though I <i>could</i> not read word for word &hellip; This gentleman, in my mind, with very superior abilities, has a warp in his mind or taste, which nullifies his best efforts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 1.498). According to the preface to the published play, Macready opined that the love intrigue in Act 4 between Count Rodna and Beatrice, sister of the queen, &#145;must be fatal&#146; to the possibility of representation. Stephens's belief that the episode could be easily &#145;&#147;expurgated&#148; to any required degree of decorum, without in the least affecting the development of the plot&#146; failed to recognize that the real problem was that the play was undramatic. Its more or less inevitable rejection in 1840 by all three patent theatre managements left Stephens &#145;very sore upon it&#151;as all authors are&#146;  (ibid., 2.98).<br>
<br>Stephens's only publicly performed play, <span class="italic">Martinuzzi, or, The Hungarian Daughter</span> (2 editions, 1841), was a version of his dramatic poem of the subtitle (also 1841). It was staged at the Lyceum Theatre twice in 1841: in May as <span class="italic">Martinuzzi, or, The Patriot</span> and in special circumstances on 26 August, under the title as published. On both occasions Samuel Phelps and Mary Warner took the leading roles. Sponsored by the ponderously styled &#145;Council of the Dramatic Authors Theatre established for the full enfranchisement of English Living Authors&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 27 Aug 1841), the revival formed a key element in the campaign against the theatrical monopoly (eventually abolished by act of parliament in 1843) which restricted the performance of the legitimate drama in London to the three patent houses. Converted into a music drama or burletta by the simple addition of songs, Stephens's tragedy evaded the law while demonstrating the absurdity of it. Despite inadequate rehearsal, there was much goodwill towards the play and the curtain fell, according to <span class="italic">The Era</span>, &#145;amid stentorian cheers, sufficient to have unroofed the theatre&#146;  (&#145;Remarks upon the presentation of the tragedy of <i>Martinuzzi</i>&#146;, Stephens, 2.400). However, the old faults of over-writing and opacity persisted and <span class="italic">The Times</span> declared that Stephens's &#145;fervent and beautiful poetry&#146; was overshadowed by &#145;his inordinate predilection for metaphors &hellip; We sigh through whole scenes for a single natural expression&#146;  (27 Aug 1841). Critical opinion could hardly have been more divided: <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span> bracketed it with &#145;&#147;Damned&#148; Tragedies&#146;  (May 1842), while <span class="italic">The Monthly</span> made immoderate comparisons with Aeschylus. After twenty-seven performances the run ended on 25 September 1841, the theatre being required for promenade concerts. A revised and longer version of the play appeared as <span class="italic">The Patriot</span> in 1849.<br>
<br>Stephens's aspirations as an acted dramatist were never fulfilled. In the &#145;Advertisement&#146; to his privately printed <span class="italic">Dramas for the Stage</span> (2 vols., 1846), the bitterness of failure through the constant rebuffs of the managers is evident. Each of the eight plays (a mixture of contemporary and historical, comedy and tragedy, verse and prose) is dedicated to contemporaries such as Macready, Knowles, and Talfourd; and the comedy <span class="italic">Rebecca and her Daughters</span> is &#145;respectfully inscribed&#146; to Dickens. Set in south Wales in 1843 at the height of the assaults on toll-gates in the name of &#145;Rebecca&#146;, it advocates harmony between the classes and asserts that property brings obligations as well as rights: the first duty is to cherish<blockquote>
<div>England's [<i>sic</i>] bold peasantry, their country's pride,<br>
</div>
<div>who, once destroyed, can never be supplied.<br>
</div> (Stephens, 2.259)</blockquote>As with the rest, there was no expectation of performance; but the play's treatment of sensitive political issues would probably have guaranteed the censor's veto.Stephens believed that the stage was second only to the pulpit &#145;for bettering nations and individuals&#146;  (Stephens, vi); and a proportion of his other writing was of a religious or theological nature, notably the introduction to the <span class="italic">Church of England Quarterly Review</span>  (1, 1837, 1&#150;34) and a compilation entitled <span class="italic">The Voice of the Pulpit, being Sermons on Various Subjects</span> (1839). The significant political dimension in Stephens's work includes not only some of the plays but a late ethical piece, &#145;The justification of war as the medium of civilisation&#146; (1850), and his most successful work in print, <span class="italic">Political Prophecy Fulfilled, or, &#145;Ireland&#146;</span> (6 editions, 1839). More intense than most, his concerns for the state of Ireland were animated by direct connections with the country through his Irish-born wife, Ellen (1810/11&#150;1866).<br>
<br>Stephens appears to have had no paid work except that of author. At various periods he resided in Hertfordshire and Essex but returned to London after about 1846, having suffered a decline in health and fortune. He had acquaintances in the dramatic world, but no close friends. He died from dysentery at 25 College Street, Camden Town, London, on 15 October 1851. He was survived by his wife and a son and daughter.<br>
