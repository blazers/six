<span class="headword">Holland <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Beaufort]</span>,  Margaret</span>, duchess of Clarence  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1388, <em>d.</em> 1439), <span class="occ">wealthy widow and monastic patron</span>, was born before 17 April 1388  (<span class="italic">CIPM</span>, 22), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13544/', "Thomas Holland, fifth earl of Kent (1350&#150;1397)")</script>, and Alice Fitzalan (<i>c</i>.1350&#150;1416), daughter of Richard (II) Fitzalan, earl of Arundel. Her father's family enjoyed increasing prestige and wealth through the favour of Richard II, but suffered considerably after the usurpation of Henry Bolingbroke in 1399. Her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13545/', "Thomas Holland")</script>, who succeeded his father as earl of Kent in 1397, and her uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13529/', "John Holland, first earl of Huntingdon")</script>, were both executed in January 1400 for their involvement in a plot to seize Henry IV and his sons at Windsor. Margaret's own fortunes were at first also closely linked to those of the Ricardian regime, but ultimately turned out much better than those of her male relatives. She married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1861/', "John Beaufort (c.1371&#150;1410)")</script>, the eldest bastard son of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, and Katherine Swynford, at some point before he became marquess of Dorset and Somerset on 28 September 1397, most likely about the time of his legitimation&#151;papal authorization was issued on 1 September 1396, and confirmed by royal patent on 9 February 1397. The legitimation of the Beauforts constituted part of a <i>rapprochement</i> between Richard II and his powerful uncle, and for the latter's children facilitated a rapid rise to prominence that was underlined by John Beaufort's acquiring first the title of earl of Somerset, and then the new dignity of marquess. But although he showed his support for Richard II in September 1397 by bringing formal accusations of treason against Gloucester, Warwick, and Arundel, three of the lords appellant of 1387, Margaret's husband also prospered following the Lancastrian coup&#151;he had the advantage of being a half-brother of Henry IV, and was perhaps more politically astute than his wife's Holland relatives. He remained an earl and served on the royal council, anticipating the political and military power later enjoyed by the second and fourth of the sons born to Margaret and himself, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1862/', "John Beaufort (1404&#150;1444)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1855/', "Edmund Beaufort (c.1406&#150;1455)")</script>, who also consecutively inherited their father's title of Somerset.<br>
<br>The death of John Beaufort on 16 March 1410 only served to enhance the standing of his widow. The vicissitudes of Margaret's life had already made her wealthy; the deaths of her eldest brother John in 1400 and then that of her only surviving brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13518/', "Edmund Holland, seventh earl of Kent")</script>, in 1408, left her with a fifth of the revenues of the Kent inheritance. Now the passing of Beaufort left her with almost all his estates, and even after his eldest son, Henry, attained his majority she still retained a third of them. Unsurprisingly, her wealth appears to have been an important factor in her second marriage, to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27198/', "Thomas of Lancaster (1387&#150;1421)")</script>, second son of Henry IV. Before this union Thomas had received no title of his own and had been relatively poor for a king's son; indeed, so obvious was the mismatch of wealth that Margaret's brother-in-law, Bishop Henry Beaufort, fearing that the inheritance of his nephews might be siphoned off by Thomas, intervened to delay the marriage by nearly two years. The first papal bull authorizing the marriage was issued on 16 August 1410 but the wedding only took place in May 1412. Thomas was made duke of Clarence on 9 July 1412, but his income remained insignificant compared with that enjoyed by Margaret&#151;the latter amounted to about &pound;1500 per annum in 1418&#150;21, compared with the &pound;300 or so that her husband received from his own estates. When Margaret travelled to France to join Thomas in November 1419 she was accompanied by a retinue of 143 people, including nineteen knights, ten priests, eleven sumptermen to oversee her baggage train, and four choristers. It was as a great lady that Margaret attended the ratification of the treaty of Troyes on 21 May 1420, and attended Catherine of Valois, then newly married to Henry V, in Paris at the end of the year.<br>
<br>Thomas died at the battle of Baug&eacute; on 22 March 1421, at which Margaret's sons John and Thomas Beaufort were captured. She had had no children from her marriage to Clarence, but remained a widow (about 1427 she undertook not to remarry) of stature and wealth for the rest of her life, with a landed income that at her death was estimated at nearly &pound;1000 per annum. If Margaret's attitudes, interests, and influence are entirely unknown during her youth and married life, it is at least possible to discern something of her personality as a middle-aged and then elderly widow (she was reported to be at least thirty-six in 1424). A picture emerges of a woman who, in the wake of the family tragedy of Baug&eacute;, wished to avoid loneliness, and also to find new purpose in her final years. She may well have enjoyed the friendship of Clarence's hostage, the young Jean, count of Angoul&ecirc;me, who was most often held at Maxey Castle, Northamptonshire, where she spent a considerable amount of time. Friendship did not, however, prevent her hindering the count's attempts to secure his freedom, since she hoped to use him as a bargaining chip to obtain the release of her son John Beaufort from French captivity.<br>
<br>Of greater significance, however, is Margaret's attachment to the Bridgettine monastery of Syon near Isleworth, founded in 1415 by Henry V. By 30 September 1428, when she received papal permission to receive the priests of the house in her own residence, Margaret was evidently spending much of her time living close to the house, and as its patron she bought at least seven books for the monastery, including a fine <span class="roman">Bible</span>. This bond with her brother-in-law's prestigious foundation, very much a symbol of Lancastrian monarchy, demonstrated her commitment to the dynasty into which she had married. But in addition to these secular considerations, her relationship with the Bridgettine priests, especially Simon Wynter, suggests a desire for guidance and, beyond this, for religious friendship, as she approached death. Wynter dedicated his <span class="italic">Life of St Jerome</span> to her and focused its content on the protection the saint provided for his devotees in the passage to the afterlife, while Margaret repaid this solicitude by obtaining a papal licence (granted on 30 November 1429) for him to leave Syon on account of his infirmity, and instead to take up residence at St Albans Abbey, with its less rigorous Benedictine observance. She was herself admitted to the fraternity of the abbey during that year.<br>
<br>Margaret died in the vicinity of Syon, probably on 31 December 1439, and was buried in Canterbury Cathedral, in a chapel dedicated initially to St Anne, but subsequently to St Michael, that she had had built at the east end of the south-west transept. Its glazing, filled with heraldic glass stressing her own dynastic significance, was completed at least a year before she died. In the centre of the chapel a marble tomb chest supports three superb alabaster effigies, representing Margaret between her two husbands, Beaufort on her left and Clarence on her right. It is not known how far, if at all, the design and furnishings of the chapel reflected her personal taste, but in its visible magnificence it undeniably provided an appropriate resting place for a great lady.<br>
