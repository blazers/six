<span class="headword">Blaikie,  William Garden</span>  (1820&#150;1899), <span class="occ">Free Church of Scotland minister and writer</span>, was born in Aberdeen on 5 February 1820, one of ten children and the second son of James Blaikie (1786&#150;1836) of Craigiebuckler and his wife, Jane Garden (<i>d</i>. 1857). His father, an advocate, was lord provost of Aberdeen at the time of his death. Educated at Aberdeen grammar school and Marischal College, Aberdeen, Blaikie proceeded to the study of divinity, during which he spent a session (1839&#150;40) at Edinburgh University. Licensed to preach by the presbytery of Aberdeen, he was presented to the parish of Drumblade, Aberdeenshire, by the earl of Kintore, a family friend, and was ordained on 22 September 1842. He adhered to the Free Church at the Disruption the following May and remained in Drumblade until he accepted a call to a new congregation at Pilrig in Edinburgh, to which he was admitted on 1 March 1844.<br>
<br>Social conditions in Pilrig prompted Blaikie to become involved in both the erection of model buildings for rent to workmen, and also in temperance issues. On 20 May 1845 Blaikie married Margaret Catherine Biggar (<i>d</i>. 1915) with whom he had fourteen children, though three of them were stillborn, and three more died in infancy. Among those to survive into adulthood was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37198/', "Walter Biggar Blaikie")</script>, civil engineer and publisher. William Blaikie's wife shared in his work and ran a children's home for some twenty years, from which many children emigrated to Canada. Blaikie's <span class="italic">Six Lectures to the Working Classes on the Improvement of their Temporal Condition</span> (1849), re-issued in 1863 as <span class="italic">Better Days for Working People</span>, sold 80,000 copies, and brought him to public attention. It prompted a less successful sequel which looked at employers, <span class="italic">Heads and Hands in the World of Labour</span> (1865). A new church was also built during his ministry.<br>
<br>In 1868 Blaikie was appointed professor of apologetics and pastoral theology at New College, Edinburgh. The presence of another professor and near-namesake in Edinburgh, John Stuart Blackie, proved an embarrassment to Blaikie in that, among other confusions, many of Blackie's eccentricities were attributed to him. This caused him to stress the Garden element of his name thereafter. A student dining-hall was instituted at New College on his initiative, and he promoted the work of the New College settlement. He was honoured with the degree of DD by Edinburgh University in 1864, and that of LLD by Aberdeen University in 1871. From 1874 to 1878 he was convener of the Home Mission committee of the Free Church: during the visit of the American evangelists Moody and Sankey in 1873&#150;4, the Blaikies housed the Moody family, an act typical of a couple who were never too busy to take on another commitment. In 1888 Blaikie was Cunningham lecturer, and in 1892 served as moderator of the Free Church general assembly, the last of the pre-Disruption ministers to do so. He was greatly interested in foreign churches and was one of the founders of the Pan-Presbyterian Alliance, of which he was president from 1888 to 1892, as well as helping to raise money for the Waldenses.<br>
<br>Literary work made constant claims on Blaikie, beginning with the <span class="italic">Free Church Magazine</span>, which he edited from 1849 to 1853. He also edited the <span class="italic">North British Review</span> (1860&#150;63), which he gave up on health grounds, though soon after he assisted Thomas Guthrie with the <span class="italic">Sunday Magazine</span>, briefly assuming sole editorship on Guthrie's death. He edited the <span class="italic">Catholic Presbyterian</span> (1879&#150;83) and kept up a steady output of books. The most famous of several biographies was <span class="italic">The Personal Life of David Livingstone</span> (1880), and Blaikie contributed to the early volumes of the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>.<br>
<br>Increasing deafness led Blaikie to resign his chair in 1897 but he remained active and was only prevented from attendance at the Free Church general assembly by a paralytic seizure from which he died at his home, 2 Tantallon Terrace, North Berwick, on 11 June 1899. Blaikie showed great catholicity of interest while at the same time remaining true to the conservative religious tradition in which he had been raised. Although not a leader of his church in any conventional sense, he was certainly one of its ornaments.<br>
