<span class="headword">Stafford, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1655), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, is thought to have been the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4628/', "George Carew, earl of Totnes (1555&#150;1629)")</script>, president of Munster  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.448). Carew bestowed favours in life and legacies in death upon Stafford, and the two lived together for many years. Nothing is known of Stafford's early life, which may have been spent in Ireland. He is probably not the Thomas Stafford of Devon, gentleman, who matriculated to Exeter College, Oxford, on 27 April 1610 aged eighteen and graduated BA on 12 November 1613.<br>
<br>Stafford's first appearance in the historical record occurred on 6 October 1611 when he was knighted in Ireland by the lord deputy, Arthur Chichester. In 1624 Carew recommended him for a company in Ireland as a reward for his long service. Although Stafford was given a troop of horse, it was, he complained in 1625, &#145;the meanest in Ireland&#146; being only twenty-five in number  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1623&#150;5</i>, 316, 454, 478). About this time he was appointed gentleman usher to the new queen, Henrietta Maria. In 1629, during Carew's final months, Stafford deputized for him as master of the ordnance, and expected to continue as deputy for the new master, Lord Vere. Shortly after Carew's death this arrangement was abandoned by the king, and Stafford was deprived of his troop of horse. He sought recompense for his costs in raising and maintaining the company for two years, in the form of a pension in Ireland.<br>
<br>By his will, dated 30 November 1625 and proved 29 May 1629, Carew bequeathed his manuscripts to Stafford. Thirty-nine of these volumes, today preserved at Lambeth Palace Library, remain a seminal collection for Irish history in the Elizabethan period and earlier. The presence of four volumes among the Laudian collection at the Bodleian Library suggests that Stafford may have had some contact with Archbishop Laud. Drawing on these documents, Stafford edited and published <span class="italic">Pacata Hibernia: Ireland appeased and reduced, or, An historie of the late warres of Ireland, especially within the province of Mounster, under the government of Sir George Carew, knight</span> (1633). Stafford claimed the book had been written three decades earlier by Carew himself, but &#145;out of his retyred Modestie, the rather by him held backe from the Stage of Publication&#146;. Once the manuscript was found by Stafford, he showed it to the &#145;view and censure of divers learned and judicious persons&#146; by whom it was &#145;esteemed worthy the view of the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pacata Hibernia</span>, foreword). It would seem that Stafford himself was the author, however, compiling a somewhat tedious series of documents, interspersed with seventeen maps tracing the progress of different campaigns between 1599 and 1603. For reasons unknown, part of the proceeds of <span class="italic">Pacata Hibernia</span> were to be given to the children of the late John Mynshew, perhaps a relation. According to Wood, Stafford was also &#145;master of many choice originals of charters of English nobility&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.448).<br>
<br>Stafford appears to have settled at the Savoy, London, possibly at his master's old residence. Some time in or after 1633 he married Mary, Lady Killigrew (<i>d</i>. 1656), widow of Sir Robert Killigrew (<i>d</i>. 1633) and daughter of Sir Henry Wodehouse of Kimberley, Norfolk. The marriage produced no surviving children. Stafford's stepson, Sir William Killigrew, was probably responsible for inducing Stafford to take out one of eighteen shares in the Lincolnshire fen-drainage ventures from 1635 to 1639. In the 1630s he was patron of at least two churches, Tottenhoe, Buckinghamshire, and West Ham, Essex, and held various minor offices. He died early in 1655 and was buried with his patron at Stratford upon Avon, Warwickshire, as requested by his will  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/247, sig. 243). His Latin epitaph on the Carew monument recalled him as &#145;an energetic commander of soldiers in Ireland&#146;, dear to the early Stuart monarchs &#145;by reason of his fidelity and superior work among their households&#146;, one who &#145;lived intimately for a long while&#146; with Carew. His widow sold the Carew manuscripts and died in 1656, requesting burial &#145;in my owne chappell within my house att the Savoy Ch., the Strand&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/260, sig. 439).<br>
