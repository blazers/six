<span class="headword">Browne,  John  Collis</span>  (1819&#150;1884), <span class="occ">physician and manufacturer of patent medicine</span>, was born on 18 June 1819 at Maidstone in Kent, and baptized at the church of All Saints with St Philip in that town. His parents were Captain William Browne of the 13th light dragoons and Clara (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Collis). &#145;Chlorodyne Browne&#146;, as he came to be known in later life&#151;or &#145;J. C. B.&#146; for short&#151;was educated from 1834 to 1836 at Bromsgrove School in Worcestershire. With him were his two brothers, one of whom became dean of Worcester College, Oxford.<br>
<br>Browne began his career by &#145;walking the hospitals&#146; in London, and in 1842 qualified as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, while living at the new resort of Weston-super-Mare, Somerset. In 1845 he became an extra-licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of London and then joined the Army Medical Service as an assistant surgeon. He was posted to the 98th regiment of foot, then stationed under Sir Colin Campbell at the port of Chushan in China. Soon after his arrival the 98th were transferred to Calcutta and in 1847 to Dinapore, near Patna, at a time when there was a &#145;desperate visitation of cholera&#146;. They then marched north-westwards to Meerut (where the Sepoy mutiny began nine years later) and to Ambala on the confines of the Punjab. It was here, in 1848, that Browne &#145;realized&#146; the compound of chloroform and morphine which, under the name of &#145;J. Collis Browne's mixture&#146;, was still being stocked in chemists' shops 150 years later (in a modified form) as a palliative for diarrhoea and other stomach disorders.<br>
<br>Following the end of the Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849, the 98th moved against the Afridi tribesmen of the Kohat Pass, where two men were wounded. Browne, therefore, became one of the first regimental surgeons to practise his skills on the north-west frontier of India. In October 1851, he left for six months in Cape Colony as assistant staff surgeon, but then returned to England on half-pay. He was asked to go to the village of Trimdon in co. Durham to fight an outbreak of cholera. So successful was he in treating his patients that the villagers presented him with a gold medal inscribed &#145;As a Testimonial to his Humanity, Skills and Ability, during the Visitation of Cholera, 1854&#146;. Further praise came from the General Board of Health in London: &#145;we cannot too forcibly urge the necessity of generally adopting it [Browne's mixture] in all cases of cholera&#146;; and from Earl Russell (addressing the College of Physicians in 1864): &#145;the only remedy of any service [in Manila] was &#147;Chlorodyne&#148;&#146;. During the Crimean War, Browne returned to full pay at Fort Pitt, Chatham. In 1856 he left the army and went into partnership with John Thistlewood Davenport, chemist, of 33 Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury, whose firm was to manufacture Browne's remedy until the 1980s when the licence was released to another company.<br>
<br>Apart from medicine, which brought him a fortune, Browne had an inventive turn of mind in many other directions, as shown by patents he took out between 1852 and 1879. These ranged from improvements in building ships to magazines for storing explosives and &#145;means and apparatus for raising vessels and other sunken bodies&#146;. He was also an advocate of beards for reasons of health, publishing a pamphlet on the subject and wearing one himself. Having retired to Ramsgate, Browne spent his remaining years as the proud owner of a 36 ton schooner, the <i>Kalafish</i>.<br>
<br>Browne died of hepatitis on 30 August 1884, at Mount Albion House, 22 Victoria Road, Ramsgate, and was interred at the church of St Laurence in Thanet.<br>
<br>Browne left his entire estate of &pound;4789 to his widow, Harriet, with the request that his friend, Captain Berkeley, would &#145;aid and assist her in the development of my several patents&#146;. He was also survived by a stepson, Ernest E. B. Skinner. In 1973 a mural tablet in his memory was erected on Mount Albion House. Although he was often referred to as Dr Browne, and the inscription on his gravestone included the letters MD, it is unlikely that he was so qualified.<br>
