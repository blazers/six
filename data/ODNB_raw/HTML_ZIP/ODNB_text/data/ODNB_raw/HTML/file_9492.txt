<span class="headword">Fisher,  David Nunn</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>David Fisher]</span>  (1816&#150;1887), <span class="occ">actor and musician</span>, was born in July 1816 at East Dereham, Norfolk, the first child and only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9491/', "David Fisher (1788&#150;1858)")</script>, actor, musician, and painter, and his first wife, F. B. Bane, (1788/9&#150;1818). He grew up on circuit in the family company, the Norfolk and Suffolk Company of Comedians, in which, at the age of seven, he made his &#145;first appearance on any stage&#146; in a solo hornpipe at his father's benefit. As a boy performer he acted, danced, and played the violin in the company's orchestra. He himself later recorded what then followed:<blockquote>When my father left the stage in 1831, I, a boy, went with him to teach music. I studied the violin; played solos in St Andrew's Hall, Norwich; played in the orchestra under Benedict, Spohr, etc. An accident, by which I broke my leg, seemed to banish me from the stage, but on recovery I joined Glover at Glasgow. (<span class="italic">The Theatre</span>, 1 April 1880)</blockquote>Meanwhile he had proved himself an outstanding violinist (comparable, said the press, to Paganini) and, with his father, had established a respected school of music and dancing. During this period he had also married, his wife's family name being Batchelder. She died while still young, however, and he then married a second Miss Batchelder, who was stated to have been his late wife's sister; if so, their union was not at that time sanctioned by English law. Few details are recorded of the births of Fisher's children, but his family eventually included at least three sons and four daughters, born probably between 1841 and 1859.<br>
<br>By 1849 Fisher's leg had healed, though he never lost a slight lameness, and he returned to the stage in Glasgow, before an audience with no preconceptions regarding the name David Fisher. &#145;We have been taken by surprise&#146;, wrote the <span class="italic">Glasgow Citizen</span> in November 1849, &#145;by the acting of a Mr Fisher,&#146; adding: &#145;we have no hesitation in pronouncing him a decided acquisition to Mr Glover's clever company&#146;. Others agreed, dubbing him the best light comedian they had seen, apart from Charles Mathews. Reporting his first benefit on 20 March 1850, the <span class="italic">Glasgow Advertiser</span> described him as &#145;uproariously entertaining and original&#146;. He had appeared in the play, been cheered in the farce (which he had written himself), sung a duet &#145;in excellent style&#146;, and then &#145;electrified the house by his performance on the violin&#146;. Furthermore, he was unanimously agreed to be &#145;gentlemanly&#146;. The critics predicted his early departure for the metropolis; but it was only after what he termed &#145;four years constant study before the footlights of Glasgow&#146;  (<span class="italic">Northern British Daily Mail</span>, 25 Aug 1854) that he accepted a London offer and joined Charles Kean at the Princess's Theatre.<br>
<br>Fisher made his London d&eacute;but on 1 November 1853, in the part of Victor de Courcy in <span class="italic">The Lancers</span>, to measured approval from the press. Queen Victoria, endorsing Glasgow opinion, told Kean that his new performer was &#145;the most gentleman-like actor&#146; she had ever seen  (<span class="italic">Suffolk Chronicle</span>, 4 March 1854). His second part, Windsor Brown in the afterpiece <span class="italic">Away with Melancholy</span>, gave scope to his comic and vocal gifts, confirming <span class="italic">The Sun</span> (15 March) in the view that he did indeed rank next to Charles Mathews as a light comedian. During the rest of the season he was well received as Faust in <span class="italic">Faust and Marguerite</span>; as a coarse peasant, Krootz, in <span class="italic">From Village to Court</span>; and as a &#145;dandy robber&#146; in <span class="italic">The Courier of Lyons</span>. In the five further years that he remained at the Princess's, playing also in court performances at Windsor, he established himself as a superb light comedian and versatile character actor. He also gained recognition for his musical virtuosity, turned to entertaining account in parts he wrote for himself, like the eccentric violin-playing Poppleton Pertinax in his <span class="italic">Music Hath Charms</span> of June 1858.<br>
<br>In 1859 Fisher moved to the Adelphi, under Benjamin Webster, acting in more powerful roles, notably that of the villainous Abb&eacute; Latour in <span class="italic">The Dead Heart</span> by Watts Phillips, which won him great acclaim from the critics, some of whom contended that this was his true m&eacute;tier, and for a while he did in fact appear in heavier parts, such as Hulks in <span class="italic">The Willow Copse</span> and Kyrle Daly in <span class="italic">The Colleen Bawn</span>. But his greatest successes were always to be in eccentric comedy, to which his small but elegant stature, expressive features, and incisive delivery were particularly well suited, and which gave full scope to his unerring sense of character&#151;and of the ridiculous.<br>
<br>In March 1862, after a disagreement with the management, Fisher left the Adelphi and spent the rest of the year in the provinces. When, in the following April, he reappeared in London, it was at the Hanover Square Rooms, in an &#145;entertainment&#146; entitled <span class="italic">Facts and Fancies, Musically and Dramatically Illustrated</span>, a non-stop succession of burlesques, songs, and character sketches, in which he kept packed audiences laughing, as the <span class="italic">Morning Star</span> (20 April) put it, &#145;to the extreme point of endurance&#146;. It was hailed by an astonished press as the event of the season. By the winter, however, he was back on course at the Princess's, with George Vining, playing parts as diverse as the scoundrel Abel Honeydew in Watts Phillips's <span class="italic">Paul's Return</span> and the fiddler Mozart Smith in his own <span class="italic">Heart Strings and Fiddle Strings</span>.<br>
<br>In 1865 Fisher was very appropriately cast in the leading part of <span class="italic">Orpheus in the Haymarket</span>, J. R. Planch&eacute;'s adaptation of Offenbach's opera. According to Planch&eacute; himself: &#145;He played Orpheus with intelligence and &#147;the fiddle like an angel&#148;&#146;  (Planch&eacute;, 249). He spent most of the next two years as stage manager and celebrity performer with H. J. Byron in Liverpool, returning to London for the opening of the new Globe Theatre on 28 November 1868, when he played Major Treherne in Byron's new play, <span class="italic">Cyril's Success</span>. After the first night, the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> expressed the hope that he would not again leave London. Nor, for some time, did he do so, but appeared at various theatres in a succession of mainly new plays, his most brilliant performance being in the role of the rou&eacute; and gamester Major Jorum, in Boucicault's <span class="italic">Formosa</span> at Drury Lane, on 5 August 1869.<br>
<br>With his intelligence and versatility, he was much in demand by playwrights such as Dion Boucicault, H. J. Byron, Watts Phillips, Tom Taylor, J. B. Buckstone, and W. S. Gilbert, who made a point of engaging him for principal parts in his comedies. Yet some of his richest characterizations were in classical comedy roles such as Sir Peter Teazle, Sir Harcourt Courtly, Autolycus, and Polonius, some of them being first seen out of London. Though a London star, he took the country theatres seriously and, throughout his career, kept in touch with his own provincial roots. He returned often to Glasgow, which had nursed his talents, and to East Anglia, performing, as when a boy, in theatres that his grandfather had built. After 1876 he worked mostly in the provinces, his last London appearance being in a lively performance of Sir Toby Belch in the Lyceum production of <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span>, in July 1884.<br>
<br>Fisher's health was now beginning to fail, however, and he became unable to undertake more than occasional concerts of dramatic readings and music. What was probably the last of these took place at the Camden Athenaeum on 24 January 1887, when his powers were said to have been undiminished. On 4 October of the same year, after an illness lasting nine weeks, he died at his home, 6 St Augustine's Road, Camden Town, and four days later was buried in Highgate cemetery, his quiet funeral unattended by the profession. The press paid tribute to a remarkable career. His death, wrote <span class="italic">The Times</span>, had &#145;deprived the stage of one of its best and most artistic comedians&#146;.<br>
<br>Fisher's third son, <a name="cosubject_65966"></a><span class="headword">Walter David Fisher</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>David Fisher]</span>  (1845&#150;1889)<span class="occ"></span>, was born in Norwich. Trained by his father, he made his first professional appearance in Manchester in 1862, and his London d&eacute;but in 1875, establishing himself in both classical and contemporary roles. In 1880 he was engaged by D'Oyly Carte to play Major-General Stanley on the first tour of the Gilbert and Sullivan opera <span class="italic">The Pirates of Penzance</span>. It was perhaps no coincidence that he was the son and pupil of the actor &#145;specially chosen&#146; by W. S. Gilbert for leading comedy parts in his earlier plays.<br>
<br>Fisher's major-general was a notable comic achievement, a blend of true characterization and sure-fire comedy which, during the next nine years, became the hallmark of his successive interpretations of: Sir Joseph Porter (<span class="italic">HMS Pinafore</span>), King Gama (<span class="italic">Princess Ida</span>), John Wellington Wells (<span class="italic">The Sorcerer</span>), Koko (<span class="italic">The Mikado</span>), Bunthorne (<span class="italic">Patience</span>), and Wilfred Shadbolt (<span class="italic">The Yeomen of the Guard</span>). In May 1889, while playing Shadbolt at Liverpool, he was suddenly taken ill during a performance and died ten days later on 25 May, aged forty-four. The <span class="italic">Liverpool Daily Post</span> of 27 May said of him: &#145;As a comedian he displayed a deep knowledge of character, and a high command of the expressions.&#146; It has been observed that these qualities marked the Gilbertian tradition for a further generation, notably in the performances of Henry Lytton, who acknowledged his debt to Fisher in a letter to the latter's widow, Caroline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hinton, in 1932. &#145;Looking back&#146;, he wrote:<blockquote>It was good to have been your husband's understudy in &#145;Princess Ida&#146;&#151;he was a fine actor&#151;and watching his fine work, put me on the right road&#151;I shall ever be thankful that fate brought me in touch with so great an artist.</blockquote>
