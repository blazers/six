<span class="headword">Rawlins,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1460&#150;1536), <span class="occ">college head and bishop of St David's</span>, was elected bachelor of Merton College in 1480. In 1484 he incepted MA and became a fellow, subsequently serving as the college's almoner, dean, and (in 1492) king of the beans, master of the Christmas revels. He was admitted BTh in 1493 and had his doctorate by 1495. On 1 March 1488 Rawlins was ordained acolyte to the title of his fellowship in the chapel of Durham College, the Oxford house of the Benedictines of Durham Priory; he became deacon on 19 December 1489 and was priested on 6 March 1490. He then embarked on a lucrative clerical career centred on London and the court. Admitted rector of St Mary Woolnoth in 1494, Rawlins became a canon of St Paul's (with the prebend of Willesdon) in 1499 and vicar of Hendon in 1504. He collected several further benefices, including canonries both of Howden, Yorkshire (presented 1506), and St George's Chapel, Windsor (appointed 1508). As chaplain to the king, Rawlins attended Henry VII's funeral and distributed several hundred pounds' worth of alms. He preached at the funeral of the infant Prince Henry in 1511, and was among those who received 20<i>s</i>. for preaching in 1521; his fellow royal chaplain and immediate successor as warden of Merton, Rowland Philipps, appears as vicar of Croydon in the same list.<br>
<br>On 17 February 1509 Rawlins was admitted warden of Merton, his return to college celebrated with a service in chapel, a play in the hall, and drinking and part songs. Judging by the theologically conservative standards of Richard Fitzjames, warden between 1483 and 1507, Richard Rawlins was a cautious reformer. But he maintained good relations with Fitzjames, by now bishop of London, lending him two censers and other plate from his own household in 1516. Rawlins's impact as warden is best measured by the college fabric. He presented a 1505 Venetian edition of Euclid's <span class="italic">Elementa</span> to the library, and constructed the bridge from the hall to the sacristy tower which still bears his punning rebus, the letters &#145;RAW&#146; with some lines carved beneath. New heraldic windows were installed in the hall on Richard Nele's benefaction in 1517; one of these &#145;glasyngs&#146;, the arms of the see of Rochester impaling those invented for Walter de Merton, survives in the chapel. The following year Katherine of Aragon visited the college during her pilgrimage to the shrine of St Frideswide, prompting a rather gushing speech from Rawlins comparing the queen to Juno and Minerva. He was well known to the king, accompanying Henry VIII to France in 1513 and again in 1520. Perhaps this familiarity provoked envy among the fellows; certainly they resented his periods of absence from college. In winter 1520&#150;21 Rawlins was accused of misappropriating revenues and alienating land. He had evidently struck a private deal with Bishop Richard Fox of Winchester, whose new foundation of Corpus Christi was arising on Merton property next to the college in return for an annual rent of &pound;4 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. (a sum still paid to Merton each Lady day). Rawlins also, the fellows added peevishly, kept three unauthorized horses in his stables. The warden blustered, refused to co-operate with the archbishop's commissary who had been sent to investigate, and was finally deposed by Warham in his capacity as the college visitor on 19 September 1521.<br>
<br>His Oxford career over, Rawlins was forced to look further afield for a position of equivalent rank. He found it in St David's, the largest of the Welsh sees: its cathedral housed the shrine of the national saint and drew in many pilgrims. Rawlins was consecrated bishop of St David's at Lambeth on 26 April 1523. He was now in advancing years, and any earlier interest in the cause of reform had deserted him. Although Rawlins took the 1534 oath renouncing papal jurisdiction, he resented the imposition of the evangelical zealot William Barlow as prior of Haverfordwest that same summer. Bishop Rawlins's resistance to the protestant prior's anti-papal good news goaded Barlow into a general denunciation of the &#145;enormous vices, fraudulent exactions, misordered living and heathen idolatry&#146; of the diocese  (Williams, 64). Worse was to come in 1535, when Cromwell appointed Barlow as suffragan bishop. Rawlins found himself forced to define his opinion on the fate of souls: while &#145;not minding to revive again a popish purgatory&#146; of candles and paternosters before altars, he restated his belief that it was meet to pray for the souls of the dead  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 10, no. 225). The final indignity came after Rawlins's death on 15 February 1536: William Barlow was his successor at St David's.<br>
<br>The British Library catalogue attributes one letter to Richard Rawlins. Addressed to Warham and dated 14 June 1527, it refers approvingly to the archbishop's recent campaign to buy up &#145;all the bokes of the newe testamente translated into Englisshe and prynted beyonde the see&#146;  (<span class="italic">BL cat.</span>), principally William Tyndale's 1526 Worms edition, in order to destroy them. The writer, certainly a bishop, subscribed 10 marks to offset Warham's expenses of &pound;66 9<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. and sent a note of congratulation: &#145;Surely in myn opynion you have done therin a graciouse and a blessed dede and god I doubt not shall highly rewarde you therfore&#146;  (BL, Cotton Vitellius B.ix., fol. 131). The signature is indistinct, but bears similarities to that of Richard Nix, bishop of Norwich (<i>d</i>. 1535). Nix was a staunch opponent of Lollardy; the source of the letter (Hoxne in north Suffolk, where Nix had his palace and from which he addressed most of his correspondence in his last years) confirms that he, and not Rawlins, was Warham's correspondent.<br>
