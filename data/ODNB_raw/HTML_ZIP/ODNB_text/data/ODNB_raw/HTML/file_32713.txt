<span class="headword">D'Arcy,  Charles Frederick</span>  (1859&#150;1938), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland archbishop of Armagh</span>, was born at Rehobeth House, Dublin, on 2 January 1859, the eldest son of John Charles D'Arcy, assistant cashier in the Great Southern and Western Railway Company's service, and Henrietta Anna, daughter of Thomas Brierly. He was descended from John Darcy, lord justice of Ireland in the reign of Edward III. D'Arcy's childhood and youth were passed in Dublin. He attended the high school, and in 1877 entered Trinity College, where he spent seven years, studying chiefly mathematics, philosophy, and divinity, and graduating with a senior moderatorship in logics and ethics. In 1884 he was ordained for St Thomas's Church, Belfast. There he remained for six years. He married on 12 August 1889 Harriet le Byrtt (<i>d</i>. 1932), elder daughter of Richard Lewis, of Comrie, co. Down; they had one son and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1890 D'Arcy was appointed to the country parish of Billy, near the Giant's Causeway, moving in 1893 to the industrial town of Ballymena, co. Antrim. Here he laid the foundation of his career and reputation, publishing <span class="italic">A Short Study of Ethics</span> (1895), which went through two editions and was reprinted in 1912. In 1899 he published his first set of Donnellan lectures (delivered at Trinity College in 1897&#150;8) under the title <span class="italic">Idealism and Theology</span>. In it he argued that the current idealism could not bridge the gulf between the self and society, that idealism, if it were to survive, must transcend itself and mere theism, and must accept substance, at once personal and supra-personal, that is the Christian Trinity.<br>
<br>D'Arcy was now recognized as a leading religious thinker of his country, and preferment came his way every three or four years. He returned to Belfast in 1900 as vicar of the city and dean of the newly founded St Anne's Cathedral; three years later he was raised to the bench as bishop of Clogher. In 1907 he was translated to the southern see of Ossory, Ferns, and Leighlin. In 1911 he returned to the north to preside over the populous see of Down, Connor, and Dromore. The home-rule movement was at its height, and the clouds of civil war were gathering. Some indication of D'Arcy's strength of feeling as a unionist is given by the remark attributed to him that there were worse things than civil war. D'Arcy after some hesitation took his stand openly with Sir Edward Carson, and the Ulster Unionist Council, and signed the Ulster covenant (28 September 1912). The bishop called for special services in the churches of his diocese on that day, to the embarrassment of other northern bishops, whom he had not consulted. By the Larne gun-running on 24 April 1914 the Ulster Volunteer Force secured arms; but in August the First World War broke out, and civil war was averted.<br>
<br>D'Arcy's political views were strongly unionist, and he had taken a firm line in the crisis. He also understood well the feelings of southern protestants, and was <i>persona grata</i> with members of his church in both north and south. When in 1919 the archbishopric of Dublin fell vacant, he was elected to fill the see; but he was not to serve for long in his native city, for in the following year he was called to the highest office in the Church of Ireland, becoming archbishop of Armagh and primate of all Ireland.<br>
<br>D'Arcy's eighteen years' tenure of the primacy was outwardly uneventful; he was not confronted with any acute crisis, nor called upon to take any far-reaching decision; but the problem of preserving an undivided Church of Ireland in a divided Ireland was present and urgent, if in the background. D'Arcy was an enthusiast for church reunion, especially with the Presbyterian church, though his attitude to Roman Catholicism was one of caution and courteous disapproval. He avoided word or act which might accentuate the acute division of political sentiment consequent on the recent partition of the country. His successor in Armagh, John A. F. Gregg, had immense respect for D'Arcy's intellect but not (according to Gregg's biographer) for his capacity as an administrator.<br>
<br>As primate, D'Arcy soon became well known in England both in ecclesiastical circles and in the learned societies. He was prominent at the Lambeth conferences of 1920 and 1930, and at the Lausanne conference of 1927. In 1927 also he was elected a fellow of the British Academy. In 1936 he was chosen to represent the Anglican communion at the centenary of the consecration of W. G. Broughton as first Anglican bishop of Australia. In the summer of 1937 his health began to fail, and he had thoughts of resignation, but he remained primate to the day of his death, which occurred at the palace, Armagh, on 1 February 1938. He was buried on 3 February in Armagh Cathedral.<br>
<br>D'Arcy's writings fall into two periods. In his younger days he was the metaphysician and moralist, seeking along academic lines to harmonize faith and reason in the spheres of thought and practice. Later in life science in its theoretical aspects occupied his attention, and in a series of books, <span class="italic">Science and Creation</span> (1925), <span class="italic">The Christian Outlook in the Modern World</span> (1929), and <span class="italic">God in Science</span> (1931), he endeavoured to reconcile the doctrine of evolution with Christian faith and practice. His views found their best expression in his last serious work, <span class="italic">Providence and the World-Order</span> (1932, Alexander Robertson lectures delivered at Glasgow University in that year); here he argued that what to God is creation, to man is evolution, and that the ascending orders of reality&#151;physical, biological, psychical, and so on&#151;constitute &#145;the splendid epic of creation&#146;.<br>
