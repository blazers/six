<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Macdonald,  Lawrence</span>  (1799&#150;1878), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 15 February 1799 at Bonnyview, Findo Gask, Perthshire, a younger son of Alexander Macdonald, a village violinist who was blind (or partially sighted), and his wife, Margaret Morison, a nurse. He was apprenticed to a Perth mason, Thomas Gibson, and in 1822 moved to Edinburgh where he worked as an ornamental carver. He entered the Trustees' Academy there on 26 February 1822; seven months later he left for Rome in the company of his patrons, the Oliphants of Gask.<br>
<br>Macdonald set up as a sculptor of portrait busts in Rome, and in 1822&#150;3 he was one of the founder members of the British Academy of Arts in the city. Macdonald, together with John Gibson and Richard James Wyatt, the leading British sculptors working in the neo-classical style in the nineteenth century, were to form the nucleus of the &#145;Anglo-Roman&#146; school active in the mid-Victorian period.<br>
<br>In 1826 Macdonald returned to Edinburgh. He exhibited at the (Royal) Scottish Academy in its early years and at the Royal Academy. His work was enthusiastically promoted by Scottish patrons and the press. In 1829 he held a special exhibition at the Royal Institution in Edinburgh of his colossal plaster group, <span class="italic">Ajax and Patroclus</span>, which was engraved on the front page of <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> (31 October 1829). A second private exhibition followed in 1830, when the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Literary Journal</span> described him as &#145;our Canova&#146;. In the early 1820s he was made an associate of the Royal Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland (RIEFAS). In 1829 he became academician of the Royal Scottish Academy but resigned in 1858 and was elected an honorary member.<br>
<br>In 1832 Macdonald returned to Rome and settled there permanently. He moved into the sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen's former studio in the piazza Barberini in 1844, by which time he had established himself as the leading bust portraitist for British visitors to Rome. According to the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, his studio was filled with &#145;the peerage done into marble, a plaster galaxy of rank and fashion&#146;  (Florentia, 351), and his sitters included the earls of Yarborough, the politician Sidney Herbert, the Liverpool merchant John Gladstone, the author Walter Scott, and the actress Fanny Kemble. He was assisted in the studio by John Macdonald, his older brother, and, from the 1860s, by Alexander Macdonald (<i>b</i>. 1847), his son.<br>
<br>Macdonald continued to make ideal statues. Examples included <span class="italic">Eurydice</span> for the sixth Viscount Powerscourt (1837; National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin) and <span class="italic">Hyacinthus</span> (1852; Royal Collection) for Prince Albert. Perhaps his finest work is the reclining figure of the countess of Winchilsea (1850; Victoria and Albert Museum, London), formerly in Eastwell church, Kent.<br>
<br>Macdonald's work was assured, carefully executed, and adherent to neo-classical principles of idealized form and high finish. His portrait busts were conventional and decorative rather than strongly individualized, combining the imagery of antique Roman portraiture with contemporary dress and hair-styling. He was described by Peter Robert Drummond as &#145;somewhat impassioned and self-asserting&#146; in his youth, but later became &#145;an enthusiastic artist and genial companion&#146;  (Drummond, 112). In 1853 he wore a &#145;long brown beard, of orthodox Italian cut &hellip; His fingers were bedizened with gems, the gifts of his admirers; and his air was that of a man who moved amongst the upper ten thousand&#146;  (ibid., 126). Lawrence Macdonald died in Rome on 4 March 1878 and was buried in the protestant cemetery there; his son Alexander carved the marble medallion portrait on his tombstone. A marble bust of Macdonald, also by Alexander, is in the collection of the Accademia Nazionale di San Luca, Rome, and another (exh. RSA 1861) by John Hutchison is in the Royal Scottish Academy, Edinburgh.<br>
