<span class="headword">Cockayne, Dame  Elizabeth</span>  (1894&#150;1988), <span class="occ">nursing administrator and teacher</span>, was born on 29 October 1894 in Burton upon Trent, the youngest in the family of two daughters and three sons of William Cockayne, brewer's traveller and licensed victualler, and his wife, Alice Bailey. One of her brothers was killed in the First World War, the second died of tuberculosis, and the third died in 1943. Her father died when she was five. These distressing experiences sharpened Elizabeth Cockayne's deep commitment to Christianity and sense of duty to others. She went to Guild Street Girls' School in Burton upon Trent. After contracting smallpox as a child, she contemplated a career in nursing. In 1912 she embarked upon a two-year training in fever nursing at the Borough Hospital, Plymouth. Although asked by the matron to stay on the staff after her training was completed, she decided to leave Plymouth in 1915.<br>
<br>Cockayne had four years' training at Sheffield Royal Infirmary, which gave her a dual qualification. She was rapidly promoted to the post of ward sister in 1919 and then night sister, a post in which she oversaw the administration of the 500-bed hospital. While she was on night duty she undertook a course in hygiene and sanitary science offered by the local education authority. Much against the wishes of her employers, she left Sheffield to undertake midwifery training at Birmingham Maternity Hospital (1920&#150;21). She impressed her supervisors with her intelligence and judgement, and took charge of caring for premature babies. Her mother died at this time. She left Birmingham to become a peripatetic nurse&#150;tutor, travelling between the Gloucester and Cheltenham general hospitals. As her headmistress had noted earlier, she had a natural flair for teaching. Throughout her life she maintained a keen commitment to her own education as well as that of others. Although happy in Gloucester, she moved to London to be near her sister, a schoolmistress, who had fallen ill. She joined the West London Hospital as one of the first nurses to occupy a combined post as assistant matron and sister tutor. She excelled in her new position, and by the age of twenty-nine was appointed to a matron's post first at the West London, then at the St Charles, and finally at the Royal Free Hospital. She was at the Royal Free from 1936 to 1948, having succeeded the formidable Rachael Cox-Davies as matron. She displayed calmness and courage after the outbreak of the Second World War, when the hospital was bombed and she was buried in the rubble. At the same time she was invited by the matron-in-chief of the London county council to act as an examiner to training schools, and to review the policy on the length of the working week for nurses and domestics. She inspected work in training schools and factories, supervising the health of munitions workers during the Second World War. She had a continued interest in the effects of fatigue and strain on nurses' health and performance. She was honorary secretary of the Association of Hospital Matrons between 1937 and 1948, occupying one of the premier positions in nursing policy and politics. As a founding member of the sister&#150;tutor section of the Royal College of Nursing, she recognized the prejudice faced by tutors, who were regarded as superfluous and a luxury in training schools.<br>
<br>In 1945 Elizabeth Cockayne was appointed a member of the working party (chaired by Sir Robert Wood) on the recruitment and training of nurses, which reported in 1947. It aimed to improve the intellectual calibre of nurse training by reducing the repetitive and routine nature of practical nursing experience and stripping the nursing role of its domestic functions. It reported (HMSO, 1947) that this could only be achieved by radically reducing the jurisdiction of the matron-dominated General Nursing Council over nurse training and substituting it with regional nursing boards. These recommendations made Elizabeth Cockayne unpopular with her fellow matrons. In 1948 she was appointed the first chief nursing officer in the National Health Service, where she remained until her retirement in 1958.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Cockayne was of slender build, with striking features, a kindly face, and keen intelligent eyes. An enlightened, energetic, and progressive leader, she had charisma, charm, a generous nature, humanitarian values, and an understanding of the various groups whose differences often clashed in the sectarian politics of health care. A shrewd but subtle strategist, she determined that the nursing voice should be heard at the highest levels of policy-making. She was gifted with the rare capacity to influence without alienating, and to assume multiple roles without undermining her integrity. She was committed to nurses' welfare and high standards of patient care. After her retirement she was a member of the South-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board (1959&#150;65), and an adviser to the World Health Organization during the 1950s. In later life she cared for many old people near her home in Cobham, Surrey, some of whom were younger than herself. She lived alone in her cottage after the death of her sister in 1982. She received the jubilee medal (1935), the Coronation Medal (1953), and the Florence Nightingale medal of the International Red Cross committee in Geneva. She was appointed DBE in 1955. She was unmarried, and died on 4 July 1988 at her home, Rushett Cottage, Little Heath Lane, Cobham, Surrey.<br>
