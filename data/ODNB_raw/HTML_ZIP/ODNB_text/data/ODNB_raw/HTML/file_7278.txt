<span class="headword">Davis,  David Daniel</span>  (1777&#150;1841), <span class="occ">physician</span>, the son of Daniel Davies, was born on 15 June 1777 at Llandyfaelog, Carmarthenshire. He was educated at Carmarthen grammar school, and at Northampton under John Horsey. Born David Davies, he later altered his surname and added his father's Christian name to his own. He entered the University of Glasgow in 1797, and graduated MD there in 1801. In 1802 he was in Mansfield where he acted as a minister to a nonconformist congregation. He settled in practice at Sheffield in 1803, where he was physician to the infirmary from 1804 to 1813. He was also an active lay preacher in the city and a founder of the Sheffield Literary and Philosophical Society which flourished between 1804 and 1806. During his time in the city he also contributed to the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>. On 5 April 1806 he married Catherine, daughter of Henry Hall, a merchant.<br>
<br>Davis moved to London in 1813, was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians on 25 June 1813, and practised midwifery. In January 1814 he was appointed physician to Queen Charlotte's Lying-in Hospital, and became physician accoucheur to the Royal Maternity Charity in 1816. As was then customary, he delivered lectures on midwifery, which proved popular, at his house, 4 Fitzroy Street, London. He attended the duchess of Kent at the birth of Queen Victoria but, contrary to later legend, did not take an active part. He was professor of midwifery and diseases of women and children in London University (University College since 1836) from 1828 to 1841 and obstetric physician to University College Hospital from 1834 to 1841. While in London Davis became a member of radical medical circles. He was a friend of Thomas Wakley and was a member of the original committee of the London College of Medicine, formed to oppose the existing &#145;corrupt&#146; medical colleges.<br>
<br>Davis's first publication, in 1806, was a translation, the <span class="italic">Treatise on Insanity</span> by Phillipe Pinel (1745&#150;1826), with an introduction by himself, compiled from standard authors. Davis's interest in obstetrics seems to have arisen following the birth of his son Henry Hall Davis in 1807. The child was harmed by the instruments used in the delivery and died in infancy. Davis then set out to improve the design of the obstetric forceps by enlarging the blades and altering the curve. He published his ideas on the subject in his <span class="italic">Elements of Midwifery</span> (1825). He was also aware of the risk of contagion in cases of childbed fever and insisted that his pupils changed their clothes after dealing with such cases. His most important book, <span class="italic">The principles and practice of obstetric medicine, in a series of systematic dissertations on midwifery and on the diseases of women and children</span> (2 vols., 1836), was a work of compilation rather than original research but was well done and widely read. In 1840 Davis published <span class="italic">Acute hydrocephalus</span>. His cures for the condition were large doses of mercury, emetics, and bleeding, but amid many pages of quotation he describes only four cases seen by himself. After a short illness Davis died at his home, 17 Russell Place, Fitzroy Square, London, on 6 December 1841.<br>
<br>Davis had a son, John Hall Davis (1811&#150;1884), who studied medicine under his father at University College and acted as a clinical assistant to his father, before developing a successful career in obstetrics and gynaecology.<br>
