<span class="headword">Marshall,  Arthur Milnes</span>  (1852&#150;1893), <span class="occ">zoologist</span>, was born on 8 June 1852 at 54 New Hall Street, Birmingham, the second son of William Prime Marshall, secretary of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and his wife, Laura (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Stark). He went to school in Birmingham where in 1870 he sat and passed the examinations for the London University (external) BA degree. The following year he entered St John's College, Cambridge, to read for the natural science tripos. As a boy he had shared his father's enthusiasm for natural history; as an undergraduate he pursued this interest through laboratory courses, learning the techniques which were beginning to transform biology into a more experimentally based discipline. He attended the courses of Michael Foster, Trinity College's new praelector of physiology, whose elementary biology classes closely resembled T. H. Huxley's courses in London, introducing students to &#145;type&#146; specimens, emphasizing the relationships between species and groups of animals. Foster actively encouraged senior students to embark upon experimental research and Marshall took advantage of this by joining a distinguished group of enthusiastic and talented young biologists who were to establish an impressive reputation for Foster's laboratory.<br>
<br>In 1874 Marshall was placed in the senior position of the first-class list of the natural science tripos. Shortly after graduating he secured a place at Cambridge University's research table at the new Stazione Zoologica at Naples, accompanying the brilliant embryologist Francis Balfour (1851&#150;1882), who had graduated the previous year. Balfour had become a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Foster, who had encouraged his interest in embryology and had assisted him to publish research papers while still an undergraduate. Balfour in turn encouraged Marshall. The two continued to work closely together on their return from Naples in the summer of 1875. In the autumn of that year Marshall assisted Balfour in teaching laboratory courses in embryology and animal morphology. Marshall was elected fellow of St John's College in 1877.<br>
<br>In the 1870s there were still few career opportunities in experimental research, even for those who showed Marshall's promise. Consequently, in 1877, he left Cambridge to train as a medical doctor at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. However, in 1879, before he had begun to practise as a doctor, he was appointed to the newly created chair of zoology at Owens College, Manchester. Although he completed his medical training by taking the Cambridge MB degree the following year, he was able to devote his whole time in Manchester to teaching and research in zoology.<br>
<br>Owens College had been founded in 1851 under the terms of the will of a wealthy local hatter, John Owen. After a fairly dismal start, the college had been transformed during the 1860s into the nucleus of a science-based university on the German model, largely through the efforts and energy of its charismatic professor of chemistry, Henry Enfield Roscoe. Teaching in zoology had been part of the duties of the professor of natural history, W. C. Williamson, but in 1877 the college council decided to divide Williamson's chair. Williamson was asked to continue to teach botany, a subject for which he had established a distinguished reputation, and Marshall was invited to teach zoology with the assistance of a demonstrator, Marcus Hartog. The college authorities clearly hoped that a zoologist with Marshall's background in experimental research would establish in Manchester a biological research school to complement Roscoe's highly successful chemistry department.<br>
<br>Marshall had begun his research career at Cambridge with investigations on the vertebrate nervous system. He had been educated in the Darwinian tradition of comparative embryology and at Owens College he continued to investigate the development of the nervous system, concentrating particularly on cranial morphology. His published research papers were considered influential and in 1885 he was elected fellow of the Royal Society. His address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1890 as president of the biological section provided an outline of contemporary theories in embryology.<br>
<br>In Manchester most of Marshall's time and energy as professor of zoology were devoted to teaching and administration. He organized lecture and laboratory courses and assisted in the development of the zoology collections of the Manchester Museum. He was highly regarded as a teacher&#151;he was able to communicate enthusiasm for zoology, capturing the attention and imagination of his students. His textbook, <span class="italic">The Frog</span>, first published in 1882, became a popular introduction to elementary zoology, running into five editions during Marshall's lifetime. He produced two further textbooks, a junior course on practical zoology (1887) and one on vertebrate embryology (1893), both of which proved popular. However, although Marshall conducted a number of original investigations as professor, his laboratory did not become a major centre for zoological research during the 1880s. Most of his students were studying for medical degrees and very few availed themselves of the opportunities it offered for original research.<br>
<br>Marshall was a gifted administrator and played an important role in the development of Owens College into the Victoria University, established by royal charter in 1882 with Owens its sole constituent college. Marshall served first as secretary and later as chairman of its board of studies, establishing regulations for the university's degrees. He was secretary of the extension movement, which encouraged lecturers to give popular courses on their subjects to the general public. He also played a prominent role in Manchester life, as an active member of the Literary and Philosophical Society and as president of the Manchester Microscopical Society for many years.<br>
<br>Marshall's main recreation was mountain climbing. His enthusiasm had been temporarily dimmed by the death of Balfour in a climbing accident in the Swiss Alps in 1882, but while professor in Manchester he spent part of many winter vacations climbing in Wales or the Lake District and most summers included a visit to the Swiss Alps. On 31 December 1893 he was climbing with a party of friends on Scafell in the English Lake District when a rock gave way beneath him and he fell. He died instantly. His death aged only forty-one shocked colleagues, who mourned the loss of such a promising academic. Marshall never married.<br>
