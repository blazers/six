<span class="headword">Gow,  Andrew Sydenham Farrar</span>  (1886&#150;1978), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born on 27 August 1886 at 100 Gower Street, London, the eldest of the three sons (there were no daughters) of the Revd Dr James Gow (1854&#150;1923), who, after being a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, was headmaster of Nottingham high school and later of Westminster School, and his wife, Gertrude Sydenham Everett-Green (<i>b</i>. 1855). He was the grandson of the historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11395/', "Mary Anne Everett Green")</script>, and the nephew of the novelist Evelyn Ward Everett-Green. He was educated at Nottingham high school, at Rugby School, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained first classes in both parts of the classical tripos (1908 and 1909), in part two specializing in archaeology, and won several classical prizes.<br>
<br>In 1911 Gow won a Trinity prize fellowship with a dissertation consisting of a miscellany of papers, several of which were later expanded into valuable articles. He applied four times for permanent posts in Cambridge, but was each time unsuccessful; it was feared that he would alarm and discourage his pupils, particularly the weaker sort. Indeed Gow's appearance was formidable, an uncompromisingly Scottish kind of countenance being set off by bushy eyebrows and side-whiskers, and anything like conceit or pretentiousness on the part of a pupil might provoke a wounding sarcasm. In 1914 he became a master at Eton College, where he remained during the First World War, a heart murmur having disqualified him for military service. Some pupils were indeed alienated by his dryness and his caustic wit; his frequent comment on an exercise shown up to him was &#145;Oh, death, boy!&#146;, and his highest expression of praise was &#145;Not wholly bad!&#146; But some of the boys appreciated his solid scholarship and the great pains he took to help them, and the nickname Granny Gow was bestowed upon him not without affection.<br>
<br>In 1925 Gow returned to Cambridge as a teaching fellow of Trinity. He was better placed in a university than in a school, and enjoyed more than he could have done in any other society the life of that great college, which was to be his home for the remainder of his life. He was a congenial colleague to A. E. Housman, and in 1936, the year of Housman's death, brought out a brief memoir which, though mainly concerned with Housman's scholarship, throws more light upon him than almost any of the studies by literary persons. Gow acted as Housman's literary executor, and supervised a reprint of his edition of Manilius.<br>
<br>Gow lectured effectively, particularly on Theocritus, and used the material collected for his lectures to compose a number of articles, all of solid merit. He sacrificed precious time by taking on the onerous administrative post of tutor, which he held from 1929 to 1942, and also the pious labour of bringing out volume two of the posthumously published <span class="italic">Early Age of Greece</span> (1931) of Sir William Ridgeway. In 1943 he became a fellow of the British Academy, and in 1947 Brereton reader in classics in Cambridge. He had honorary degrees from the universities of Durham (DLitt) and Edinburgh (LLD).<br>
<br>In 1950, a year before his retirement from the latter post, Gow published a memorable edition of Theocritus, a second edition following three years later. The editor's massive learning, unusual accuracy, and sober judgement render this book indispensable to scholars. In 1952 Gow followed the Theocritus with an admirable edition of the Greek bucolic poets in the series of <span class="roman">Oxford Classical Texts</span>, and a year later he brought out a valuable translation of these writers with a useful introduction. The year 1953 saw also the appearance of an edition of the difficult Hellenistic didactic poet Nicander, in which Gow collaborated with A. F. Scholfield.<br>
<br>Gow next began work on the Hellenistic epigrams contained in the Greek anthology. A monograph called <span class="italic">The Greek Anthology: Sources and Ascriptions</span> appeared in 1958, and in 1965 it was followed by the two-volume <span class="italic">Hellenistic Epigrams: the Garland of Meleager</span>, in which Gow collaborated with Denys Page, Page being primarily responsible for the poems of Meleager and Gow for all the rest. The same year saw the appearance of Gow's edition, with commentary, of the fragments of the Alexandrian iambic poet Machon; none of his productions makes more entertaining reading than his edition of this scurrilous but amusing author. In 1968 Gow and Page followed up their first volume by bringing out <span class="italic">Hellenistic Epigrams: the Garland of Philip</span>, again in two volumes; this time Gow was primarily responsible for the 650 epigrams which were either attributed to Antipater of Thessalonica or left over as being either his work or that of Antipater of Sidon. Gow's work on Hellenistic epigrams has the same qualities as his <span class="italic">Theocritus</span>, and like that book will remain an essential instrument of scholarship.<br>
<br>The fears expressed early in Gow's career regarding the possible effects of his teaching did not prove entirely vain; his dryness and severity antagonized a number of his pupils, and the austerity of the regime at Trinity encouraged alarming departures from that quality by lesser scholars in certain other places. But pupils of the more pertinacious sort profited greatly from his teaching and his company. During the Second World War he regularly sent to pupils who were on active service a circular newsletter of a highly characteristic kind; these letters were published in 1945 in a book called <span class="italic">Letters from Cambridge</span>.<br>
<br>Gow also did much to interest undergraduates in art, a subject by no means popular among the Cambridge dons of his generation. Several members of his family had been artists or lovers of art, and Gow himself became no mean collector and connoisseur. From about 1909 he was a friend of John Beazley, with whom he once combined to buy a Sienese picture they had discovered in a dealer's; and he often travelled in Italy to look at pictures, sometimes in the company of his friend Scholfield. Although in theory Gow disapproved of all art later than 1500 except for Rembrandt, Vel&aacute;zquez, and, with some reservations, Rubens, he left to the Fitzwilliam Museum, of which he had been a syndic from 1934 to 1957, twenty-four works by Degas and six each by Rodin and Forain. From 1947 to 1953 he served as a trustee of the National Gallery, to which he left a fine collection of photographs of paintings which he had often used to stimulate a love of art in undergraduates. They were accustomed to drop in on him between ten and eleven in the evening, when he could be an agreeable companion; and he, who had spent so little of his life with women, surprised his colleagues by making friends with the celebrated actress Dorothy Tutin.<br>
<br>In his last years Gow's health became impaired, and in 1965 he left his rooms in Nevile's Court, with a fine Athena for a door knocker, for a set in the King's Hostel, where there was a lift. After breaking a thigh in 1973 he moved to the Evelyn Nursing Home, where he died on 2 February 1978. He was unmarried.<br>
