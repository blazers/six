<span class="headword">Bosa</span> <span class="st"> [St Bosa]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 706), <span class="occ">bishop of York</span>, was trained in the religious life at the monastery of &#145;Strean&aelig;shalch&#146; (Whitby) under Abbess Hild. In 678 or 679 he was intruded into the much reduced see of York, in place of Wilfrid, at the instance of King Ecgfrith and Archbishop Theodore. It was perhaps then that Acca, later one of Wilfrid's leading followers, became a member of his household. When Wilfrid was reinstated, in 686 or 687, Bosa was expelled from York. What became of him then is unknown; with Wilfrid's second expulsion, <i>c</i>.691, he was, however, restored, remaining at York until his death. Although commanded by the pope in 704 to attend the council convoked to settle Wilfrid's claims to a diocese covering the whole of Northumbria, it is not certain that he was present at the synod eventually held by the River Nidd in 706; he was probably already a sick man, for he died that year, shortly afterwards.<br>
<br>Bede, who presumably heard about Bosa from Acca, writes of him very warmly, praising his great holiness and humility. The bishop was also remembered with affection at York, where in the time of Alcuin (<i>d</i>. 804) he was reputed a &#145;staunch and upright teacher&#146;, who endowed the fabric and caused his clergy to live apart from the common people.<br>
<br>Bosa was commemorated in the late eighth-century metrical calendar of York on 2 October. Later, his feast day was 9 March.<br>
