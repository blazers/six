<span class="headword">O'Connor,  John</span>  (1830&#150;1889), <span class="occ">scene-painter and topographical painter</span>, was born on 12 August 1830 in co. Londonderry, the third son of Francis O'Connor and his wife, Rose Cunningham; both his parents worked in the theatrical business. He was educated at the Church Educational Society's school in Dublin. Orphaned by 1842, he supported himself and his grandfather, Francis O'Connor, up to the latter's death in 1845. His mother's brother was lessee of the Belfast and Liverpool theatres and O'Connor assisted with scene painting and acted as call-boy at the Dublin theatre. In 1845 he joined a travelling group of actors as scene-painter but, to make a better living, he returned to Dublin and made silhouettes with the pantograph. In 1844 he painted scenery for Sir E. Tierney and in 1847 for the earl of Bective. On 2 April 1848 he arrived in London, having brought introductions to scene-painters, and afterwards worked at the Drury Lane Theatre. In October he became one of the scene-painters at the Haymarket Theatre, where John Baldwin Buckstone was manager and playwright between 1853 and 1878; he was principal scene-painter here from 1863 to 1878.<br>
<br>O'Connor returned to Ireland in the summer of 1849 to paint scenes for the moving diorama of the visit of Queen Victoria to that country. The diorama was shown by Philip Phillips in 1850 at the Chinese Gallery at Hyde Park Corner, London, where O'Connor lived for over a year until the exhibition closed. In 1864 he painted the scenery for the Shakespeare tercentenary performances at Stratford upon Avon; he also designed tableaux vivants held at Cromwell House and elsewhere, including Shakespearian scenes (1874), <span class="italic">The Tale of Troy</span> (1883), <span class="italic">The Dream of Fair Women</span> (1884), the <span class="italic">Masque of Painters</span> (1886), and the <span class="italic">Masque of Flowers</span> (1887). At Cambridge, as a member of the Cambridge Amateur Dramatic Club, he painted scenery for productions of Greek dramas, including <span class="italic">Ajax</span> (1882), <span class="italic">The Birds</span> (1883), <span class="italic">The Eumenides</span> (1886), and <span class="italic">Oedipus tyrannus</span> (1887). He also produced scenery for private theatrical performances and had many patrons in London society. By the 1870s he had gained the reputation of being a most talented scene-painter, with few equals as a master of architectural design, and an admirable colourist. In 1878 he resigned from his post at the Haymarket Theatre in order to concentrate on conventional painting, though he later painted act-drops for Sadler's Wells Theatre and St James's Theatre and the &#145;Minuet&#146; act-drop for the Haymarket Theatre.<br>
<br>From 1853 to 1888 O'Connor exhibited oils and watercolours of architectural subjects at the Society of British Artists (twenty-six works), the British Institution (six works), and the New Watercolour Society (twelve works). He showed at the Royal Academy for the first time in 1857 and thereafter in most years, especially in the 1870s and 1880s, up to 1888. In 1855 he made the first of many visits to the continent, where he made studies for future pictures. He later travelled to France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Algeria, and the majority of his exhibited works were of continental, mainly architectural, subjects. From 1855 to 1858 he was drawing-master at the London and South-Western Literary and Scientific Institution. During the Franco-Prussian War he was in Sedan; he published a first-hand description, &#145;Three days in Sedan&#146;, in <span class="italic">The Dark Blue</span> in July 1871. During the Prussian occupation of Paris, he visited that city several times with the son of the duke of Sutherland, Lord Ronald Gower, a sculptor; in 1872 he took a studio with Gower at 47 Leicester Square, in the house formerly occupied by Sir Joshua Reynolds. In 1874 O'Connor was commissioned by the first duke of Westminster to decorate rooms at Eaton Hall with three large oil paintings (only two were apparently completed), and eight smaller views of Cliveden, Trentham, and Dunrobin for the first duchess's sitting-room (unrecorded in inventories in the 1920s, and untraced). Probably through his contacts with the Westminster and Sutherland families, he was commissioned to paint watercolours for Queen Victoria, <span class="italic">The Marriage Procession of Princess Louise, 1871</span> and <span class="italic">Queen Victoria Driving out of Buckingham Palace with the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, 1874</span> (both Royal Collection). He was among the artists who contributed to the decoration of Lawrence Alma-Tadema's house in St John's Wood, London. In 1878 he built a house and studio at 28 Abercorn Place, St John's Wood, where he lived until his health failed; in 1888 he went to live at Yateley, Hampshire. He became an associate of the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1883 and a member of the Royal Institute of Painters in Watercolour in 1887. O'Connor was married twice and had two sons from each marriage. He travelled to India to see the two younger ones, but soon after his return he died of paralysis on 23 May 1889 at his home, Heath Croft, in Yateley; he was buried in Finchley cemetery, Middlesex. Lord Ronald Gower wrote that &#145;he was not only a good artist, but a thoroughly good fellow, which is a much scarcer quality than the former&#146;  (Gower, 92).<br>
