<span class="headword">Mary</span>, princess royal  (1631&#150;1660), <span class="occ">princess of Orange, consort of William II</span>, was born at St James's Palace on 4 November 1631, the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5143/', "King Charles I (1600&#150;1649)")</script> and his queen, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12947/', "Henrietta Maria (1609&#150;1669)")</script>. Since at first it seemed unlikely she would survive, she was baptized in a sober ceremony by William Laud, bishop of London, on the same day. Her childhood was spent under the tuition of Jean Ker, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Drummond, countess of Roxburghe, and she and her siblings lived alternately at Richmond and in London.<h2>
<a name="ThemarriagetoWilliamofOrange1641"></a>The marriage to William of Orange, 1641</h2>On 2 May 1641, only nine years old, Mary was married to William II (1626&#150;1650), son of Frederick Henry, prince of Orange. The tentative overtures between the English and Spanish in the late 1630s caused much alarm in the Dutch republic, as it was feared this would greatly jeopardize Dutch trade at sea. In 1639 an ambassador was sent from The Hague to England to discuss a possible treaty between England and the United Provinces, and in January 1640 another Dutch envoy, Johan Polyander van Kerckhoven, Lord Heenvliet, arrived in London to negotiate a match between William and Mary. Should Charles accept this marriage, it was reasoned, the Spanish king Philip IV, set on a match between his son and Mary, would certainly not be satisfied with Charles's second daughter Elizabeth as an alternative. Charles, however, proposed not Mary but Elizabeth as William's future wife, and after some deliberation this proposal was approved both by the Dutch authorities and Frederick Henry, as well as by the English parliament. Another Dutch embassy crossed the North Sea in order to discuss the conditions of the marriage treaty, but once in London it appeared Charles had changed his mind. The English&#150;Spanish negotiations having failed, and Spain backing out because of troubles in Portugal and Catalonia, he now offered his eldest daughter to William, on the condition of a political alliance with the Dutch republic. This, however, was not accepted by the Dutch, who feared they might become implicated in the troubles between king and parliament, and in the end Charles had to succumb. His wish that Mary should stay in England until she had reached the age of twelve, when, according to English marriage laws, she officially had to agree to the match, was granted by the Dutch. The marriage articles stipulated that Mary's dowry from England should be &pound;40,000, while the prince of Orange agreed that Mary and members of her court were allowed to exercise religion according to the rites of the Church of England; that she would keep all her English servants while any vacant post would be filled from England; that all household expenses would be paid for by her husband; that in addition she would receive &pound;1500 per annum and that her Dutch dower would be &pound;10,000 a year with two residences, were her husband to die. Prince William and his entourage of 250 people arrived in Gravesend on 19 April 1641, and some days later he was received in Whitehall Palace, presenting members of the royal party with diamonds, pearls, and other jewellery, worth almost &pound;23,000. The couple were married by the bishop of Ely in the Chapel Royal at Whitehall Palace on 2 May. The groom, wearing a suit of crimson velvet, was accompanied by the Dutch ambassadors, while Mary, dressed in a silver robe, her train borne by sixteen ladies dressed in white satin, was led in by her brothers Charles, prince of Wales (later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5144/', "Charles II")</script>), and James, duke of York (the future <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14593/', "James II")</script>). A Roman Catholic, Henrietta Maria did not attend the Anglican ceremony, but watched the wedding from an upstairs gallery. Afterwards, the party dined, and later in the evening William was led to Mary's bedchamber, where the royal family had assembled. For an hour and a half, the young couple lay beside each other on the bed, the princess wrapped from head to toe in a sheet, and then the prince was taken back to his own quarters. A few days later he dutifully reported to his parents that &#145;although we were at first very solemn towards each other, now we feel more at ease; I find her to be more beautiful than the painting&#146;&#151;a Van Dyck portrait of the princess that had been sent to Holland before&#151;&#145;I love her very much and I believe she loves me too&#146;  (Groen van Prinsterer, 2nd ser., 3.460). On 29 May <span class="smallcap">OS</span> (8 June <span class="smallcap">NS</span>) William returned to the Netherlands.<h2>
<a name="PrincessroyalintheDutchrepublic16421650"></a>Princess royal in the Dutch republic, 1642&#150;1650</h2>Less than a year later, in March 1642, Mary followed her husband. She was brought over by Henrietta Maria, who, under the pretext of accompanying her daughter, was bringing large quantities of jewels and plate, planning to trade them in the Netherlands for money and weapons for Charles's campaigns. Mary, Henrietta Maria, and their train of almost 400 courtiers were received with great pomp. They were met by Prince William, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8638/', "Elizabeth")</script>, the exiled queen of Bohemia, and some of her children, and escorted into The Hague, where cannon were fired and all the streets were richly decorated. In the following weeks they travelled to various Dutch towns and cities, and in every one of them they were entertained on a grandiose scale.<br>
<br>In February 1644 Mary was officially installed in her conjugal position, fulfilling from that moment onwards all functions of state, and in March 1647, after Frederick Henry had died and William had succeeded his father as stadholder of the main provinces of the republic, she became princess of Orange. With her father-in-law, the prince of Orange, Mary had stood on good terms, while her aunt Elizabeth of Bohemia quickly became one of her greatest friends and allies in The Hague, but with her mother-in-law, Amalia van Solms, relations were strained from the beginning.<br>
<br>Mary's royal status gave her precedence over members of the house of Orange, which on several occasions caused friction at the court. Also, Amalia bitterly complained about the sumptuous lifestyle of her son and his wife, and Mary's ladies had been overheard saying that &#145;it was time the princess should run the country&#146;, because Amalia had done so long enough  (Visser, 431). The &#145;English&#146; match was often discussed, and greatly regretted, by members of the Orange entourage, and in 1648 Amalia was reported to be &#145;hateful of all things English&#146;  (ibid., 540). When, in 1648, and again in 1649, the prince of Wales and the duke of York came to The Hague to seek support for the royalist cause, William not only lent them large sums of money, but also paid for all their expenses, which led Amalia and others to object that supporting four households would certainly bankrupt the house of Orange.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, the fact that Mary did not get pregnant was another worrisome matter. Her relationship with her husband was never cordial, and the couple did not spend much time together. After a miscarriage in October 1647, it was rumoured she could not conceive again, and in 1649 one of Mary's servants was dismissed because she had given the princess something &#145;to prevent her from having children&#146;  (Visser, 700). However, when on her nineteenth birthday, on 14 November 1650 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, Mary gave birth to a son, there was not much ground for celebration. Eight days before, on 6 November, her husband had died of smallpox.<h2>
<a name="Widowandmother16501660"></a>Widow and mother, 1650&#150;1660</h2>On 15 January 1651 <span class="smallcap">NS</span> the young prince was baptized in the Great Church of The Hague, his mother being absent from the ceremony. Only a few days after his birth discord had risen between Mary and Amalia, his mother preferring to name the baby Charles, and his grandmother intent on naming him William&#151;which name eventually was decided upon [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29450/', "William III and II (1650&#150;1702)")</script>]. The &#145;royal&#146; character of the baptism was frowned upon by some, who did not take well the fact that &#145;halberdiers were riding on the side of the Prince's coach, and also that the Child was dressed in fur, black on white&#146;  (Royal Archives, The Hague, account of the baptism 1651, inv. A-16-I-3).<br>
<br>Other disputes arose soon after the burial of Mary's husband on 8 March 1651 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>. First, it had to be decided whether William should be elected as stadholder, succeeding his father, but the states general, despite petitions from both Amalia and Mary, decided against this and resolved to take over all offices themselves. Second, the guardianship over the young prince proved to be a cause of such conflict that it took the supreme court to settle the matter in August 1651. The court decided upon the appointment of three guardians: Mary, with one vote, on one side, and Amalia and the elector of Brandenburg, sharing one vote, on the other side. Under supervision of these guardians, the administration of William's estate would be executed by the Nassau estates council. Not only was Mary thought too young and too ignorant of national affairs to become sole guardian, but Amalia in particular suspected that &#145;her Daughter-in-law &hellip; will spend all his estate upon her family and party; that shee and they have undone her son&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Politicus</span>, 37, 603).<br>
<br>Although after 1651 the support for the English royalist exiles in Holland had diminished and it was thought that the &#145;great disbanding of the English [should] be attributed to the death of the Prince of Orange, whose onely study and indeavor was to win the hearts of the strangers wholly to himself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Politicus</span>, 38, 616), Mary tried to assist them financially whenever she could. She was supported by her faithful courtiers, staunch royalists and Anglicans themselves, such as her personal chaplain Thomas Browne, who would never allow Mary to attend services in the English Reformed church in The Hague. Especially the dominating influence of Catherine Stanhope (later countess of Chesterfield), first lady of honour, and her Dutch husband, Lord Heenvliet, superintendent of Mary's household, was greatly feared, by both the Dutch and the English. Sir Edward Hyde, chancellor to Charles II, despaired in 1653 that the princess would not take counsel from anyone but &#145;subjects herself solely to Henfleet and his lady&#146;  (<span class="italic">Clarendon State Papers</span>, 2.169), and Mary indeed preferred staying at their country house in Teylingen over her own residence in The Hague.<br>
<br>Cromwell's spies reported that royalists were plotting against him at The Hague, &#145;which is a nest of malignant vypers. The princess royall's and queen of Bohemia's court nourishes those creatures&#146;  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 2.344). The outbreak of the First Anglo-Dutch War in 1652 temporarily roused Dutch sympathy for the royalist party, but the peace treaty of May 1654 stipulated that enemies of England would not be tolerated in Holland. Having hosted her brothers, Charles II, James, duke of York, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12962/', "Henry, duke of Gloucester")</script>, on several occasions in The Hague, Teylingen, and her own country estates during the early 1650s and in 1654 (and as she was to again in 1657), Mary was now officially forbidden to receive them on Dutch territory. From that moment onwards she travelled extensively in France, Germany, and the Spanish Netherlands to meet her brothers and the exiled English court whenever she could. During these travels rumours circulated in Europe about a possible marriage between Mary and several candidates, among whom were the king of Sweden, George Villiers, second duke of Buckingham, the dukes of Savoy and Brunswick, and Prince Radziwill of Poland. Her everyday movements were duly reported in newspapers and in intelligence sent to Cromwell, informing him that she had gone, for example, in July 1654, to take the waters at Spa, where she was to meet Charles, and that she then would travel with him to Aachen and Cologne. In the summer of 1655 she visited her brother at his Cologne residence, staying until November, and in January 1656 she was royally received in Paris by her mother and the French court: &#145;On the 16th [February] the grand Balet, called <i>Psyche</i> or the Power of Love, was danced at the Louvre, in presence of the Queen, the Princess of Orange &hellip; with many great Lords and Ladies&#146;  (L. Hotson, <span class="italic">The Commonwealth and Restoration Stage</span>, 1928, 137). She returned to The Hague in February 1657, almost a year later.<br>
<br>By that time the conflict between Mary and her mother-in-law had flared up again, focusing on Mary's claims to the regency over the princedom of Orange in the south of France. William II had died without an official will, but in a sealed letter of 24 February 1649 <span class="smallcap">NS</span> to Count Dohna, governor of Orange, he had left instructions that, in case of his death, only Mary's orders should be followed. Dohna&#151;a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Amalia's&#151;had ignored the instructions, pledging loyalty instead to young Prince William, while Mary had found a copy of the letter when she opened a chest containing her husband's papers, which had been sealed immediately after his death. Defending her rights, and firmly opposing Dohna's position, she had assented in August 1651 to submit the case to the court of Holland and the supreme court, which, in February 1652, dismissed her claims. During her visit to Paris in 1656 she asked Louis XIV to intervene; he denounced Dohna and his followers as rebels, and on 24 August 1658 <span class="smallcap">NS</span> the <i>parlement</i> of Orange declared Mary sole regent, which position she formally accepted in October. When, in 1659, and again in 1660, Louis XIV sent troops to Orange, the states general forced Mary to recall the French intervention, but she was too late, for in March 1660 Orange capitulated to Louis's troops. The conflict would continue after Mary's death, resulting ultimately in the loss of Orange to France.<h2>
<a name="Deathandaftermath"></a>Death and aftermath</h2>On 14 May 1660 <span class="smallcap">NS</span> Mary notified the Dutch government that the English parliament had invited her brother to the throne of England. Together with her young son and her brothers she took part in the celebrations in Breda and The Hague, and witnessed Charles's embarkation for England from Scheveningen. The Restoration placed both Mary and her son&#151;now fifth in succession to the throne of England&#151;in a completely different position in the Dutch republic. In the following weeks they were officially received and entertained in several Dutch cities, and in Amsterdam allegorical pageants were staged, representing the tragedies and triumphs of the house of Stuart. Encouraged by the change in attitude towards her, Mary once again asked the Dutch states to consider reinstating her son in his father's dignities, referring to a similar request of her brother to the state pensionary of Holland. Although some provinces looked upon her demands favourably, Holland required time for deliberation. Meanwhile, Mary made plans to travel to England, confessing to Charles that to stay in the Netherlands would be &#145;the greatest punishment of this world&#146;  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 1.662), but when she left in September 1660, only the education of the young prince had been officially settled. Even before arriving, she learned that her brother Henry, duke of Gloucester, had suddenly died of smallpox, and thus her visit was deeply coloured by mourning. Her only public act was the recognition of &pound;10,000 presented to her by parliament in November, while in the same month Charles appointed a committee to investigate her claims to the yet unpaid dower of &pound;40,000.<br>
<br>A Dutch embassy, sent over to congratulate Charles on his restoration and to renew the alliance between England and the Dutch republic, sought Mary's assistance when some difficulties over the treaty arose in late November. However, she was already feeling ill, and when it became clear that she was suffering from either measles or smallpox, court physicians started to bleed her frequently, causing her to take a turn for the worse. Anxious to settle her affairs, Mary dictated her will to her secretary Nicolas Oudaert on 24 December 1660 <span class="smallcap">OS</span> (3 January 1661 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>). Asked repeatedly what she wanted with regard to her son, she answered that she trusted her brother and mother completely with his well-being: &#145;My greatest pain is to depart from him. Oh my child, give him my blessing&#146;  (Royal Archives, The Hague, report Oudaert 1661, inv. G1-6II-H, fol. 41). The same evening, after one last blood-letting incision, according to an eyewitness, &#145;her eyes did look so dim that it was obvious to all she was dying. After that, she had no signs of great pain, but every instant did visibly decay, till she lost her senses&#146;  (Green, 6.328). She was buried, as she had wished, near her brother Henry, in Henry VII's chapel, Westminster Abbey, on 29 December 1660. In the same year a double biography of Mary and Henry was published by Thomas Manley, who lamented their untimely death:<blockquote>
<div>What raging Seas of dangers, and what storms,<br>
</div>
<div>What foaming billows of Tempestuous harmes:<br>
</div>
<div>The royal Issue has escap'd! Then ar'<br>
</div>
<div>The <i>Fates</i> more cruel in their Peace, than <i>War</i>!<br>
</div> (Manley, 114)</blockquote>Immediately after her death Oudaert started settling Mary's estate, discovering that already many valuables had disappeared: Lady Stanhope had taken all jewellery, plate, and linen from the bedchamber, while the duchess of York was seen wearing Mary's pearls. His first concern was to separate Mary's own possessions&#151;to be inherited by her brother and mother&#151;from jewellery that had once belonged to her husband, because &#145;my Sonnes Jewels, being those I found in his Fathers Cabinet expressed in a note of them to be delivered to him&#146; should be returned to Holland  (Royal Archives, The Hague, will of princess royal, inv. A15-XIII-1). He drew up a detailed &#145;Representation of estates, concerns and debts&#146;, including payment due to all Mary's servants  (TNA: PRO, SP 84/164, fols. 118&#150;24), and specified all moneys borrowed by her father and brother from the prince of Orange in the 1640s, as well as the outstanding dower, to be restituted with interest. In 1667 these affairs were still not settled. Although in her will Mary had named Charles II as guardian over her son William, this was accepted neither by the other guardians nor by the states of Holland, who feared the English influence over the Dutch prince. After long, and often bitter, deliberations, it was decided in September 1661 that Amalia van Solms would have custody over the young prince.<br>
<br>Dutch historians, in particular those writing from a republican point of view, have, for the most part, evaluated Mary's significance in history in rather negative terms. Her marriage to William II in 1641 caused the involuntary involvement of the princes of Orange and the Dutch republic in the English troubles of the 1640s. This put a heavy strain on the finances of the house of Orange, while the interference of Mary and her English councillors in Dutch politics of the 1650s is generally considered to have had disastrous consequences, as in the case of Orange. Her Dutch contemporaries judged her for her &#145;royal&#146; arrogance, her obstinacy to accept anything Dutch, and her refusal to learn the language, and after her death state pensionary John de Witt was appalled by the fact she had not named her son universal heir, leaving him &#145;not even a stiver&#146;  (Geyl, 133). On the other hand, her English contemporaries and biographers praised her continuous support to the royalist case of her brother, and it was said that her love and zeal in this respect &#145;deserved to be engraved with a diamond pen upon tablets of brass, that its memory might never pass away&#146;  (Green, 6.188). As she died before the age of thirty, her most important accomplishment came posthumously when, in 1689, her son became William III of England.<br>
