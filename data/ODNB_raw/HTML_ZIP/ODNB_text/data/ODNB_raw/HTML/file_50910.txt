<span class="headword">Miller,  John</span>  (1805&#150;1883), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born on 26 July 1805 at Ayr, son of James Miller, builder, and his wife, Margaret Caldwell. He had at least one brother; their father is presumed to have been Scottish. John Miller was educated at Ayr Academy. Alternative accounts state that at the age of twelve and a half he entered the office of C. D. Gairdner, solicitor and estate factor, or that he was apprenticed to the town clerk of Ayr with a view to becoming a lawyer: one appointment may have succeeded the other. In 1823, however, he moved to Edinburgh and was employed in the office of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11237/', "Thomas Grainger")</script>, who had been in business as a surveyor and civil engineer since 1816. In 1825 Grainger took Miller into partnership.<br>
<br>Several authorities state that Miller attended Edinburgh University, without specifying dates. He cannot be clearly identified from surviving university records, but he might have been the John Miller who matriculated in law in 1823, or more probably he was one of two John Millers who matriculated in arts (which included engineering) in 1826.<br>
<br>John Miller's introduction to railway engineering came with the construction of the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway between 1823 and 1826; this was followed by the Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway, opened in 1831. Subsequently, Grainger and Miller worked individually on separate projects, though the partnership was dissolved only in 1845. John Miller became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1832. He married on 1 December 1834 Isabella (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1802), daughter of Duncan Ogilvie of Perth, a merchant. They had at least five children&#151;four daughters and a son, also called John.<br>
<br>Miller was engineer to the Dundee and Arbroath Railway, built between 1836 and 1838 and, more importantly, to the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock, and Ayr Railway (GPKA), built between 1837 and 1843. More importantly still, he was engineer for the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, authorized in 1838 and opened in 1842: this was a line very much in the Stephenson tradition, with extensive engineering works to provide a near-level route.<br>
<br>By then Miller was the leading railway engineer in Scotland, and he thus found himself immensely busy during the railway mania of the mid-1840s. In 1845 alone he deposited plans before parliament for more than 1500 miles of railway. He successfully completed the North British Railway (Edinburgh&#150;Berwick), the Edinburgh and Hawick Railway, the Glasgow, Dumfries, and Carlisle Railway (in effect an extension of the GPKA), the Dundee and Perth Railway, the Stirling Midland Junction Railway (a short but important link from Polmont to Larbert), and several lesser lines. He was also engineer to the proposed Direct Northern Railway, one of several contenders for the route from London to York.<br>
<br>Exhausted, perhaps, and with his fortune certainly made, John Miller retired in 1850 at the age of forty-five. He was said to have been arrogant and his estimates always low; nevertheless, some of his railways remained of vital importance 150 years later. His great viaducts continued to carry trains, notably the 26 arch Avon Viaduct and the curving 36 arch Almond Viaduct on the Edinburgh and Glasgow line. His Ballochmyle Viaduct, south of Kilmarnock, had a central, semicircular masonry arch of 181 feet in diameter, the largest in Britain&#151;though Miller himself considered his greatest work to be the nearby Lugar, or Templand, Viaduct, with its 14 arches carrying the railway 150 feet above the Lugar water.<br>
<br>Miller had been elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1841. By 1865 he had left the established Church of Scotland to support the Free Church. He stood unsuccessfully for parliament in 1852 and 1865, but was a Liberal MP for the city of Edinburgh from 1868 until 1874. Much of his time was devoted to running the extensive estates he had bought: Leithenhopes in Peeblesshire and Drumlithie in Kincardineshire. He became a JP and a deputy lieutenant. He died a widower, after a short illness, on 8 May 1883, at his residence, 2 Melville Crescent, Edinburgh.<br>
