<span class="headword">Seagrave,  Robert</span>  (<em>b. </em>1693, <em>d.</em> in or after 1755), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and writer</span>, was born on 22 November 1693 at Twyford, Leicestershire, second son of Robert Seagrave, vicar of Twyford from 1687 to 1720, and his wife, Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Moore), of Morton, Nottinghamshire. He was educated at Oakham School, Rutland&#151;where &#145;Orator&#146; Henley (the eccentric London preacher John Henley) was two years his senior&#151;and matriculated at Cambridge in 1711, having entered as sub-sizar and Leeds scholar at Clare College on 8 November 1710, the year in which he was also a Johnson exhibitioner. He became BA in 1714 and MA in 1718. Seagrave was made deacon on the title of Loseby, Leicestershire, in the diocese of Lincoln, on 26 February 1716; and it is known that from 1720 to 1726 one Robert Seagrave, himself or possibly his father, was rector of Cold Overton, Leicestershire.<br>
<br>Thus Seagrave was already ordained well before the eighteenth-century evangelical movement had effectively started. In 1731 he began publishing tracts (at least ten by 1755) advocating evangelical beliefs, the first of which won the appreciation of William Grimshaw in Yorkshire soon after his conversion. By 1731 Seagrave had apparently moved to London, and by 1738 he is said to have withdrawn from the established church; but like John Wesley and other leaders better known, he may well not have done so. He became, however, a supporter of George Whitefield, and when Dr Joseph Trapp, vicar of Christ Church Greyfriars, London, preached against Whitefield, on the undesirability of being righteous overmuch, in 1739 Seagrave published an <span class="italic">Answer</span>, to which Trapp replied, an exchange of views noticed at some length in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 9.418&#150;20, 476).<br>
<br>In the same year Seagrave began to officiate at regular Sunday evening preaching in Loriners' Hall, London Wall, Basinghall Street, London, later adding Tuesday and Thursday lectures, and &#145;for some years preached with much success&#146;  (Tyerman, 1.212). It was now that his aptitude for writing hymns came to the fore. Seagrave's <span class="italic">Hymns for Christian Worship</span> (1742; 4th edn, 1748) included thirty of his own. Two of these, &#145;Now may the Spirit's holy fire&#146; and &#145;Rise my soul and stretch thy wings&#146;, were still in use in 1892. Seagrave was also among those associated with the erection of Whitefield's Tabernacle (1741); and in 1744 he took charge during the temporary absence of its regular ministers. John Griffith, subsequently an independent minister, was converted (<i>c</i>.1743) by Seagrave's preaching at Loriners' Hall. Seagrave was apparently associated with a small body of English Calvinistic methodists about whose activities there is relatively little record.<br>
<br>In 1749 Seagrave gave up his ministry at Loriners' Hall. In 1751 a fourth edition of his tract addressed to the University of Cambridge appeared. By 1753 he was preaching at a chapel in Bull and Mouth Street, off St Martin's-le-Grand, London, and he contributed to Whitefield's <span class="italic">Hymns for Social Worship</span> (1753). His last tract was published in 1755. No reference to later activities has been found; but Seagrave was still remembered with appreciation 100 years later. In 1860 Daniel Sedgwick appealed in <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> for additional information. A biographical introduction to Sedgwick's edition of Seagrave's hymns appeared without further details. In 1884 an American author, E. F. Hatfield, included Seagrave in his <span class="italic">Poets of the Church</span>, published both in New York and in London, but with little more detail. An anonymous writer in the <span class="italic">Evangelical Magazine</span> said of Seagrave &#145;He was a good minister of Jesus Christ, a workman who needed not to be ashamed. He was a man of eminent piety, great humility, and remarkable zeal and diligence&#146;  (1814, 304). It is not known whether or not he married.<br>
