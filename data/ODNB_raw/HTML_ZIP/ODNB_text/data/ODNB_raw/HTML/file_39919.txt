<span class="headword">White,  Arnold Henry</span>  (1848&#150;1925), <span class="occ">journalist and publicist</span>, was born at Chapel House, All Saints, Hereford, on 1 February 1848, the third child and second son of Edward White (1819&#150;1898), a Congregational minister in Hereford and then Camden Town, and his wife, Rachael Ainsley, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Aldersey (<i>d</i>. 1864). As a young man he was employed by the P. &amp; O. shipping company; he then became a coffee planter in Ceylon. In the late 1870s this venture failed, and White returned to London, taking up residence in Hampstead. For a while he served as manager of the Edison Electric Light Company, only to find himself unemployed when Edison merged with the rival Swan Company. Heavily in debt, White was obliged to seek another career: he opted for the life of a political agitator.<br>
<br>From 1884 onwards White helped to organize a number of colonizing schemes, in the course of which he visited South Africa, Canada, Australia, and the United States of America. He also began &#145;exploring&#146; the East End of London to study the social question. This gave him the material for his first book, <span class="italic">The Problems of a Great City</span> (1886), and led to an invitation to fight the Mile End constituency in the Liberal interest, which he did unsuccessfully in the 1886 general election. Eighteen months later White broke with the Liberals in protest over Gladstone's refusal to condemn the Irish Plan of Campaign. He then stood as the Liberal Unionist candidate for Tyneside in 1892 and 1895, suffering defeat on both occasions.<br>
<br>Frustrated in his parliamentary ambitions, White enjoyed some success as a polemical journalist. His articles were soon appearing in a variety of newspapers and periodicals. Many of them dealt with the question of alien immigration, for White was an ardent &#145;restrictionist&#146;, anxious to check the entry into the United Kingdom of &#145;destitute&#146; Jews from eastern Europe, a subject on which he gave evidence before several official inquiries. During the 1890s, acting as the agent of the Baron de Hirsch, he also paid a number of visits to Russia in the hope of persuading the tsar's government to establish a colony in Argentina for poor Russian Jews. From the mid-1890s White increasingly turned his attention to the state of the British navy. He served for several years on the executive council of the Navy League and probably drafted some of its more inflammatory manifestos. During the summer of 1900 White visited the Mediterranean Fleet, as the guest of Admiral Charles Beresford, and in June of the following year achieved notoriety when he sent the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> a private letter of Beresford's, complaining about the fleet's deficiencies. Meanwhile, White was forming a firm friendship with the man who shortly emerged as Beresford's bitterest enemy within the service, Admiral Sir John Fisher. Both men were obsessed with the danger posed by the recently founded German high fleet. Indeed, White favoured the sudden and unheralded destruction of the German warships in harbour before they could seriously threaten Britain's naval hegemony. An article to this effect, written in late 1904, annoyed the prime minister, Arthur Balfour, and the Kaiser was so angered by it that, when a party of English journalists visited Germany on a goodwill mission in April 1907, he insisted on White's exclusion.<br>
<br>White landed himself in another scrape in the course of his campaign to bring the crooked company promoter Whitaker Wright to justice; in August 1903 an outspoken article in <span class="italic">The Sun</span>, while the case was <i>sub judice</i>, resulted in his committal to Brixton Prison for contempt of court. This episode reveals White in his favourite role, that of &#145;tribune of the people&#146; crusading against &#145;decadence&#146; in high places&#151;a role that he had recently performed with <i>brio</i> in <span class="italic">Efficiency and Empire</span> (1901), the book by which he is perhaps best remembered. White was also a fearless critic of all forms of political ineptitude and misconduct, from whichever party they emanated.<br>
<br>During the 1906 general election White made his final attempt to get into parliament, unavailingly contesting Londonderry North as an independent. From 1907 onwards he supplied a regular column to the popular weekly <span class="italic">The Referee</span> under the pseudonym Vanoc. White had always taken an interest in eugenics and sat for a while on the council of the Eugenics Education Society. He was also a zealous supporter of compulsory military service, a cause which brought him into contact with the duke of Bedford, who thereafter acted as his patron.<br>
<br>White's political convictions were those commonly found among the Edwardian radical right: he sang the praises of empire and national defence, and fiercely lambasted Irish home rule, socialism, cosmopolitan pacifism, and the corruption engendered by the secret party funds. Many of his contemporaries thought him foolish and hot-tempered, but few questioned his honesty or his patriotism. During the First World War, White's Germanophobia became even more extreme; his book <span class="italic">The Hidden Hand</span> (1917) purported to uncover a sinister, long-standing conspiracy to &#145;Germanize&#146; all aspects of British life. These xenophobic views drew him into an association with the demagogue Noel Pemberton Billing. But military victory, when it came, did not bring White peace of mind; he spent his final years raging impotently against Bolsheviks, Germans, Sinn F&eacute;iners, and international Jewry.<br>
<br>In private life White took an interest in climbing, travel, shooting, golf, chess, and gardening. In 1879 he married Helen Constance (1849&#150;1918), only daughter of Lowell Price of Farnham Royal, Buckinghamshire; they had one son. White died, a widower, at his home at Farnham Common, Buckinghamshire, on 5 February 1925, aged seventy-seven. In his will he asked to be commemorated by a simple wooden cross, inscribed only with his name, the date of his death, and the words, &#145;for England&#146;.<br>
