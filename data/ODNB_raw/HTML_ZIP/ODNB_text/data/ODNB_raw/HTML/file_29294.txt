</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Whitehead,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1715, <em>d.</em> 1785), <span class="occ">poet and playwright</span>, was baptized on 12 February 1715 at St Botolph's Church, Cambridge, younger son of Richard Whitehead (<i>bap</i>. 1673, <i>d</i>. 1730), baker, of Cambridge and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1742). His father had aspirations beyond his means, including a good education for William, and with the patronage of Henry Bromley, Cambridgeshire MP (later Lord Montfort), William entered Winchester College in 1728. This was the first of several acts of patronage to benefit Whitehead, who inherited his father's social aspirations without his incapacity to manage his finances. His father died in debt before William had completed two years at Winchester. It was only through his mother's determination to sustain the bakery business that he was able to continue his education.<br>
<br>At Winchester, Whitehead demonstrated an early interest in theatre and poetry. He acted in school productions, started writing verse, and in 1733 won a prize of 1 guinea from Lord Peterborough, for a poem on Peterborough himself, the subject set by Peterborough's friend Pope when they visited Winchester together. Pope was sufficiently impressed to employ Whitehead to translate the first epistle of <span class="italic">Essay on Man</span> into Latin verse. It seems likely that Whitehead's admiration of Pope was enhanced, greatly influencing his own poetic style, which favoured the polished couplet and wit. By mid-century, when he was poet laureate, this dependence on the style of the past made Whitehead seem old-fashioned.<br>
<br>Whitehead hoped to gain a place at New Hall, Oxford. When he failed to do so, he returned to Cambridge in 1735, and successfully applied for a Pyke scholarship to Clare College. This was a scholarship founded by Thomas Pyke (a baker) in 1720, funding orphan sons of Cambridge bakers for two places at Clare. Whitehead entered the college with a reputation as a poet and social skills well beyond his humble origins. He readily made friends with members of noble families, such as Charles Townshend (1728&#150;1810), and contributed verse to university publications, including the congratulatory verses printed in 1736 on the prince of Wales's marriage. He graduated BA in 1739 and was made a fellow in July 1742, taking his MA in the following year. Whitehead's first independent publication was <span class="italic">The Danger of Writing Verse</span> (1741), reportedly &#145;highly approved by Mr Pope&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 3.34). The piece reflects something of Whitehead's philosophy, which allowed him to accept patronage very readily:<blockquote>
<div>Say, can the bard attempt what's truly great,<br>
</div>
<div>Who pants in secret for his future fate?<br>
</div>
<div>Him serious toils, and humble arts engage,<br>
</div>
<div>To make youth easy and provide for age;<br>
</div>
<div>While lost in silence hangs his useless lyre,<br>
</div>
<div>And though from Heav'n came, fast dies the sacred fire.<br>
</div> (ibid., <span class="italic">Poems</span>, 2.57)</blockquote>During his fellowship Whitehead published <span class="italic">An Essay on Ridicule</span>; <span class="italic">Ann Boleyn to Henry VIII</span> (1743); <span class="italic">Atys and Adrastus</span>; and &#145;On Nobility&#146; (1744). Already his dependence on classical and other literary sources is evident, and always acknowledged by Whitehead. <span class="italic">Ann Boleyn</span> was based on her letters to Henry published in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> (no. 397); <span class="italic">Atys and Adrastus</span> was modelled on a story from Herodotus' <span class="italic">History</span>. Whitehead was studying at this time for the church, following the example of his elder brother John, when in 1745 he was recommended to the earl of Jersey as tutor to his son, George Bussy Villiers (1735&#150;1805). Whitehead accepted the post, which involved also teaching a young friend of the family, Humphry Stephens, and moved to the earl's London home. By the following year he decided against the church, and thus had to resign his fellowship at Clare, which required him to become a clergyman.<br>
<br>Once settled in London, Whitehead started writing plays. His first major piece was <span class="italic">The Roman Father</span>, a tragedy based on Corneille's <span class="italic">Horace</span>, performed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, on 24 February 1750. The play was a tremendous commercial success: it was reprinted frequently after its first publication in 1750, adapted by Whitehead for revival in 1767, and even translated into French; and it brought Whitehead into contact with Garrick (though he had already written a flattering poem to the actor on his appointment as patentee at Drury Lane), who played the leading role. This was the beginning of an association lasting over twenty years. Most commentators have, however, preferred Whitehead's second tragedy, <span class="italic">Creusa</span> (1754), dedicated to George Bussy Villiers, although it was less popular on stage. This play was based on the <span class="italic">Ion</span> of Euripides. Horace Walpole claimed: &#145;it is the only new tragedy that I ever saw and really liked&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 35.79). Again Garrick took a leading role, and Robert Dodsley, who published all Whitehead's earlier work, on the strength of <span class="italic">The Roman Father</span>'s success paid him 100 guineas for sole rights. In 1754 Whitehead published <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span>, in which he included <span class="italic">The Roman Father</span> and an interesting blank verse piece, &#145;The Sweepers&#146;, which reflects a concern for the socially dispossessed who sweep the streets of London.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1754 Whitehead was required to accompany his pupil and a friend (George Harcourt, Viscount Nuneham) on a tour of Germany and Italy. He returned to England in 1756, and published <span class="italic">Epistles</span> (1757), inspired by his travels. The continental tour had been his last office as tutor to Lord Jersey's son, but the family wished to ensure his continued comfort. Lady Jersey had used her influence while Whitehead was abroad to gain for him in 1755 the salaried positions of secretary and registrar to the Order of the Bath. Whitehead was also invited to live with the Jerseys as a companion. He accepted this offer, feeling he served a useful role looking after Lady Jersey whose health was failing. She died in 1762, the earl seven years later, at which point Whitehead insisted on moving to lodgings in London, remaining a constant visitor to both Middleton (the family's country seat in Oxfordshire) and Nuneham (the country home of Lord Harcourt), as well as a welcome guest on a daily basis in the Jerseys' London home.<br>
<br>In 1757 Whitehead, rather by default, was appointed poet laureate. On the death of Cibber the position was offered as a sinecure to Thomas Gray, who declined it, believing it to be a demeaning role. Whitehead's terms of employment required two odes annually, one for the new year and one for the king's birthday. He was paid &pound;100, a significant sum, but, when set beside the &pound;200 paid to the composer who set them to music, a reflection of the inferior status accorded the laureate. In a contemporary judgement William Rider asserted that: &#145;with regard to the <span class="italic">Birthday Odes</span> &hellip; it seems probable that they will never reach posterity&#146;  (Rider, 23). They did not. However, Whitehead does shine by contrast with his immediate predecessors and he was not without admirers among his contemporaries, including Mason, Gray, and Horace Walpole. Whitehead brought to the odes a genuinely patriotic spirit rather than a sycophantic attitude. He loved his nation and respected the king as a symbol of that nation. His verses are seldom banal, usually dignified, and often written with assurance. They reflect the national desire for peace in the face of strife in Europe and rebellion in the American colonies.<br>
<br>In 1758 Whitehead published <span class="italic">Verses to the People of England</span>, in his laureate vein, seeing the role of the poet to &#145;wake with verse the hardy deed&#146;. His next major piece for the theatre was to move in a different direction: romantic comedy. <span class="italic">The School for Lovers</span> was produced at the Theatre Royal on 11 February 1762. Again Whitehead is derivative, drawing on a prose work by De Fontanelle. He Anglicizes the setting and characters, and obviously had to accept some suggestions of Garrick, as the play was published with Whitehead's prologue &#145;as it was intended&#146; in which he comments that &#145;He shifts no scenes to dazzle and surprise&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 1.207), alongside the prologue &#145;as spoken by Mr Garrick&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>Change you shall have; so set your hearts at ease;<br>
</div>
<div>Write as he will, we'll act it as you please.<br>
</div> (ibid., 1.209)</blockquote>Although this might suggest tensions between them, Garrick and Whitehead remained on the best of terms. Garrick's opinion of the play was &#145;Humbug for Nine Nights&#146;&#151;a comment made in a letter written on the ninth night of the performance while he was offstage between the prologue and act II  (<span class="italic">Letters of David Garrick</span>, 1.355). However, he recognized Whitehead's dramatic potential, and trusted his judgement enough to make him his reader of new plays. Garrick was also to come to Whitehead's defence when he was attacked by Charles Churchill: &#145;still I cannot get it into my Mind that Your Attack upon <i>him</i>, is a justifiable one&#146;  (ibid., 2.366). Churchill had been bitterly satirical at Whitehead's expense in <span class="italic">The Ghost</span>, book 3:<blockquote>
<div>
<i>Dullness</i> and <i>Method</i> still are one,<br>
</div>
<div>And <i>Whitehead</i> is their darling Son<br>
</div>
</blockquote>and in later pieces. This was in reaction to Whitehead's <span class="italic">A Charge to the Poets</span> (1762), in which he pompously speaks to his fellow poets &#145;As bishops to their clergy give their charge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 2.292), urging them to avoid contention among themselves; to write only when inspired, not for profit; and to remain immune to extremes of criticism or praise. In &#145;A Pathetic Apology for All Laureats&#146;, written for private circulation and published posthumously by Mason, Whitehead allows a little of his well-controlled irritation to become apparent:<blockquote>
<div>Each evening post and magazine,<br>
</div>
<div>
<i>Gratis</i> adopts the lay <i>serene</i>.<br>
</div>
<div>On their frail barks his praise or blame<br>
</div>
<div>Floats for an hour and sinks with them;<br>
</div>
<div>Sure without envy you might see<br>
</div>
<div>Such floundering immortality.<br>
</div> (ibid., 3.97)</blockquote>Although Garrick defended Whitehead, he was wary of the publicity, and Whitehead's last major play, <span class="italic">A Trip to Scotland</span> (1770), was dedicated to Garrick (who did not take a part) and published anonymously. Whitehead describes the work very aptly as a &#145;whimsical trifle&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 2.3). In 1774 Whitehead acknowledged authorship when he published <span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span> in two volumes. This collection did not reproduce all of Whitehead's laureate pieces, several of which were added in a third volume (1788) containing Mason's memoir, which forms half of this volume. Whitehead continued to produce his laureate odes each year until his death, and he also published anonymously two separate moralistic fables, <span class="italic">Variety</span> (1776), &#145;a tale for married people&#146;, and <span class="italic">The Goat's Beard</span> (1777). Both went through several editions. His last ode, in response to the recent peace treaty with America, was to offer a &#145;prophetic truth&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>Trust the Muse: her eye commands<br>
</div>
<div>Distant times and distant lands:<br>
</div>
<div>Through bursting clouds, in opening skies,<br>
</div>
<div>Sees from discord union rise;<br>
</div>
<div>And friendship bind unwilling foes<br>
</div>
<div>In firmer ties than duty knows.<br>
</div> (ibid., 3.110)</blockquote>Whitehead never married. In this matter he demonstrated his characteristic practicality, admitting in a letter to Lord Nuneham in 1763 that, although he desired marriage, &#145;a moderate precarious income has but little allurement &hellip; it would be madness to think of raising a family without a prospect of at least a tolerable provision&#146;  (Harcourt, 7.240). Whitehead had used the profits from his plays to discharge his father's debts. He lived instead for the families he had given his life to serving, as mentor and friend. He died at his home in Charles Street, off Berkeley Square, London, on 14 April 1785 after a short illness brought on by a cold. In his will he left his books to one former pupil, Lord Jersey, and the rest of his estate to his executor, the other pupil, Humphry Stephens (later General Stephens). He was buried in South Audley Street Chapel on 20 April.<br>
<br>Whitehead is essentially of minor status as a writer, but he is marked out from many of his fellows for his moderation and good taste, his easy humour, and his common sense. He rose considerably in society, but never forgot his origins:<blockquote>
<div>My education rose above my birth,<br>
</div>
<div>Thanks to those parent shades, on whose cold clay<br>
</div>
<div>Fall fast my tears, and lightly lie the earth.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 2.172)</blockquote>
