<span class="headword">Murray,  Maurice</span>, earl of Strathearn  (<em>d.</em> 1346), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was probably the eldest son of Sir John Murray (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1333) of Drumsargard in Lanarkshire, who supported Robert Bruce's seizure of the Scottish kingship as early as 1306. Maurice's mother is unknown, but by about 1320 Mary, daughter of Malise, seventh earl of Strathearn, was probably his stepmother, and her father at that time gave Maurice's father minor Tayside lands. Although he was a relatively unimportant noble, the second phase of Scotland's wars of independence gave Maurice the opportunity to enhance his local and national position by service to the Bruce cause. He may have been old enough to fight for the infant David II against Edward Balliol's English-backed invasion at Dupplin (1332) and Halidon Hill (1333). But he first appears on record, of age and in his father's lands, after David had taken refuge in France in May 1334, serving as sheriff of Lanark by October 1334 and supporting Andrew Murray (guardian for David II from 1335 to 1338) in his rejection of English peace terms at Berwick in August 1335. The Lanercost chronicler alleges that in 1335 Maurice killed Sir Godfrey Ros, the pro-Balliol sheriff of Ayr and Lanark, in revenge for Ros's murder of Maurice's (unnamed) brother. In fact Ros appears to have been alive in 1336, though Murray's ability to lead an armed following from Lanarkshire for the Bruce cause undoubtedly gave him standing there, so that the fifteenth-century chronicler Walter Bower styled him &#145;Lord of Clydesdale&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1339 Murray led a division at the successful siege of Perth organized by Robert the Steward (guardian in 1338&#150;41). But it was after David II's return from France in June 1341 that Murray's career took off and he became a royal favourite, useful both in recovering ground lost to English occupation and in acting as a restraint on the king's ostensible supporters who had increased their regional power in the king's absence, in particular Robert the Steward. In November 1341 Maurice helped his kinsman Sir William Murray of Tullibardine recover his lands from Sir William More of Abercorn, a kinsman of the Steward's wife. Among several royal grants to Maurice between 1341 and 1346 was custody of Stirling Castle in July 1342, shortly after its recovery in a siege whose success the chroniclers attribute to the Steward's leadership. In the same year David also gave Maurice the large baronies of Strathaven in Lanarkshire and Sprouston and Hawick in Roxburghshire. David no doubt looked to Murray to act as a counter-weight to the regional influence of the Steward in Clydesdale and of William Douglas in Liddesdale and the border marches&#151;the relations of both these men with the crown had rapidly deteriorated after 1341.<br>
<br>On 31 October 1343 David granted Murray and his male heirs the vacant earldom of Strathearn. Murray may have sought confirmation of his claim to this title in the right of his wife. Yet the grant surely prompted a challenge by the Steward (long-time lord of Methven and, by 1342, earl of neighbouring Atholl) and other lords with ambitions in central Scotland. In a tense parliament at Scone in June 1344 David had to direct a reassertion of the crown's effective forfeiture of Malise, eighth earl of Strathearn (who was represented there by his son-in-law William, earl of Ross); the Steward as guardian had originally seen Malise cleared of treason at a parliament at Perth in 1339, despite his surrender of his earldom to Edward Balliol. Strathearn was reconfirmed to Murray; in the same parliament he was named among the cautioners (securities) for the followers of the murdered Alexander Ramsay in their feud with Douglas of Liddesdale, whose cautioners included the Steward.<br>
<br>Murray was a regular royal charter witness and itinerant household retainer between 1341 and 1346. Towards the end of that period he was created a justiciar, perhaps north of the Forth, and he would undoubtedly have become a key figure in David II's regime had he not been killed, along with many of the king's closest supporters, in the battle of Nevilles Cross, outside Durham, on 17 October 1346; with David captured, the Steward fled the field and had secured Strathearn for himself by 1357.<br>
<br>Murray had a papal dispensation dated 10 July 1339 to marry Joanna Menteith (<i>d</i>. after 1364), widow successively of (remarkably) Malise, seventh earl of Strathearn (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1325), for a time Murray's stepgrandfather, and John Campbell, earl of Atholl (<i>d</i>. 1333), with whom Murray was related within the third degree. Murray is not recorded as having had legitimate issue, although he may have had a bastard, Maurice, to whom David granted lands near Edinburgh in 1358. His widow married William, earl of Sutherland (another royal favourite), in 1347. Their daughter, Joanna, married first Thomas Murray of Bothwell (<i>d</i>. 1361) and second, about 1362, Archibald Douglas, later lord of Bothwell and Galloway and third earl of Douglas; his possession of Drumsargard (but not of Hawick, Sprouston, Strathaven, and other lands) was briefly challenged by Maurice Murray's younger brother, Alexander.<br>
