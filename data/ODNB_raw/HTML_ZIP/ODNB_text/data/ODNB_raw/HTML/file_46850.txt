<span class="headword">Crawford, Sir  William</span>  (1840&#150;1922), <span class="occ">industrialist and philanthropist</span>, was born on 19 May 1840 at Maine Mount, Randalstown, co. Antrim in Ulster, the youngest of the ten children of the Revd Alexander Crawford (1790&#150;1856), missionary and Presbyterian clergyman, and his wife, Anna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gardner (1803&#150;1882). His parents were both Scottish, but settled in Ireland in 1836, after spending seven years in India, where Alexander was a missionary, and a further four years in England. Alexander took up the position of minister of the First Randalstown Presbyterian Church in January 1837.<br>
<br>Crawford was educated privately and at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution. In 1856, the year his father died, he began work as an apprentice at the York Street Flax Spinning Company Ltd in Belfast, the world's leading linen producer at that time. He remained with this firm for the rest of his working life. During his apprenticeship Crawford showed exceptional aptitude, initiative, and diligence, so much so that in 1862, when he was just twenty-two, he was given the task of reorganizing the Paris branch of the firm. Having successfully completed this task, he remained in Paris as the firm's representative there until 1887, when he was appointed as a managing director of the company. During his period in Paris, Crawford was elected president of the Paris British chamber of commerce in two consecutive years. In 1866 he married Annie Coulson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Glasgow, daughter of a Presbyterian missionary to India. They had four sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>On his return to Belfast to take up his new position of managing director of the York Street firm, William Crawford made his home at Mount Randal, off the Malone Road. He remained managing director of the York Street Flax Spinning Company Ltd for thirty years. In carrying out his duties he not only exhibited &#145;great business ability&#146; and a &#145;unique knowledge of the linen trade&#146; but also worked with &#145;untiring energy and perseverance&#146;. He was renowned for working long hours, being at the York Street Mill early and late. Furthermore, in all his business dealings he acted with transparent honesty and uprightness of character. As one commentator pointed out, &#145;Everyone who knew him realised that his word was as good as his bond&#146;  (<span class="italic">Belfast News-Letter</span>, and <span class="italic">Northern Whig</span>, 13 May 1922). On the death of R. H. Reade, the chairman of the company, in 1913, Crawford was appointed chairman. He retained this position until 1918, when poor health forced him to retire.<br>
<br>Throughout his working life Crawford had been an active member of many of the commercial associations connected with the linen industry and had held office in the Linen Merchants' Association, the Flax Supply Association, and the linen section of the Textile Institute. In 1910 he was the president of the Belfast chamber of commerce. In that year he published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Irish Linen and some Features of its Production</span>, in which he warned of the increasing threat of cotton to the linen industry and emphasized the need to develop new uses for linen. He himself suggested that it could be used in mesh underwear.<br>
<br>As well as being a very busy and effective businessman, William Crawford was a particularly active supporter of the Presbyterian church and held office on numerous church committees. He was particularly interested in the home and foreign missions and supported them liberally. He was also one of the founders and first chairman of the Central Presbyterian Association and was a member of the general assembly.<br>
<br>However, perhaps Crawford's greatest contribution to society, and the reason for his knighthood in 1906, was his involvement in the development of the new Belfast Royal Victoria Hospital. He had a long and prominent association with the old hospital in Frederick Street, and was very active in promoting the building of the new hospital on the Grosvenor Road. It was &#145;one of the largest and best equipped hospitals of its kind&#146; at the time  (<span class="italic">Belfast News-Letter</span>, 13 May 1922).<br>
<br>Crawford's health deteriorated after 1918 and he died at his home, Mount Randal, Malone Road, Belfast, on 12 May 1922, a week before his eighty-second birthday. He was buried in the city cemetery in Belfast.<br>
