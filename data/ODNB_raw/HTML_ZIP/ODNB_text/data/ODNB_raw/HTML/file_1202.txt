<span class="headword">Balguy,  Thomas</span>  (1716&#150;1795), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 27 September 1716 at Cox Close, Lamesley, co. Durham, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1201/', "John Balguy (1686&#150;1748)")</script>, Church of England clergyman and moral philosopher, and his wife, Sarah Broomhead (<i>bap</i>. 1686). He was educated at the free school, Ripon, Yorkshire, under Mr Stephens, and on 28 May 1734 was admitted as pensioner to St John's College, Cambridge. He graduated BA in 1738, proceeded MA in 1741, and on 17 March 1741 was elected to a Platt Fellowship, which he held until 1748. He was ordained deacon (21 September 1740) and priest (21 December) by the bishop of Lincoln, and on 9 April 1741 he was collated rector of North Stoke, Lincolnshire, by Potter, archbishop of Canterbury, his father's right of presentation having lapsed. He was instituted rector of Hagworthingham, Lincolnshire, on 26 July 1746, having resigned North Stoke; he petitioned the archbishop of Canterbury and received dispensation on 21 November 1746 to hold the two livings together (worth respectively &pound;95 and &pound;55), and was reinstituted to North Stoke (once more in the gift of his father) on 16 December 1746.<br>
<br>From the early 1740s to 1760 Balguy was active in Cambridge. In 1744 he became assistant tutor to his friend William Samuel Powell (afterwards master of St John's), who had just been promoted principal tutor, and for 16 years he read lectures in moral philosophy and the evidences of natural and revealed religion in St John's. In 1743 he was deputy public orator under James Tunstall, who was acting as chaplain to Potter at Lambeth. In 1758 he took the degree of BD. His closest friends in Cambridge were Powell and Richard Hurd. When Powell died in 1775 Balguy edited his <span class="italic">Discourses on Various Subjects</span> (1776), with a brief life of Powell, and it was thought that he had a chance of succeeding him as master. His friendship with Hurd can be traced through Hurd's letters to him over a period of almost 50 years. Other members of his Cambridge circle were Thomas Gray and William Mason; Gray refers affectionately to Mason's former tutor as &#145;your Uncle Balguy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.574). Hurd introduced Balguy to Warburton, who valued his friendship and welcomed his criticisms: the long appendix added to volume 2 of the <span class="italic">Divine Legation</span> is indebted to some of Balguy's remarks. Samuel Parr regretted that Balguy did not write Warburton's biography.<br>
<br>Balguy said he owed all his clerical preferments to the favour and friendship of Bishop Hoadly, also his father's patron. He was for a time Hoadly's chaplain. In 1748 he was collated (31 May) and installed (16 July) to a prebend in Lincoln Cathedral; on 1 November 1757 he was collated to a prebend in Winchester Cathedral; and on 23 July 1759 Hoadly appointed him archdeacon of Winchester. In 1760 he gave up his connection with St John's and moved to Winchester, his cousin Sarah Drake joining him to keep house. On 19 September 1771 he was instituted vicar of Alton, Hampshire, on the presentation of the dean and chapter of Winchester, whereupon he ceded his two benefices in Lincolnshire; he held the vicarage of Alton, the archdeaconry of Winchester, and the two prebends until his death.<br>
<br>Balguy was greatly esteemed by churchmen like Warburton and Hurd, who were anxious to defend the established church from the attacks of dissenters, modernizers, and sceptics. He published little, but he kept these enemies firmly in view. He took a very conservative view of the need for subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, claiming in a sermon &#145;On church authority&#146;, preached at the consecration of Bishop Shipley of Llandaff and published by order of the archbishop of Canterbury (1769), that &#145;A religion founded on Reason willingly submits to human authority in all points not essential to the cause of Piety and Virtue&#146;  (T. Balguy, <span class="italic">Discourses</span>, 1.94). This was answered by Priestley in <span class="italic">Considerations on Church-Authority</span> (1769). Another sermon on the same subject, preached at the consecration of bishops Hurd of Lichfield and John Moore of Bangor and similarly published by order, was answered by John Disney in <span class="italic">Remarks on Dr Balguy's Sermon</span> (1775); Disney took particular exception to Balguy's argument that subjection to authority is the invariable duty of a Christian. On the publication of Hume's <span class="italic">Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion</span> (1779) Hurd set about persuading Balguy to &#145;obviate&#146; Hume's &#145;destructive impiety&#146;  (Kilvert, 135&#150;7). Balguy had long been interested in the subject of Hume's attack; as an undergraduate he published a Latin poem entitled &#145;Divina bonitas demonstrari potest a posteriori&#146; (&#145;The divine goodness is capable of proof from its effects&#146;; see <span class="italic">GM</span>, 94/2, 1824, 596&#150;8). In response to Hurd's urging he published <span class="italic">Divine Benevolence Asserted; and Vindicated from the Objections of Ancient and Modern Sceptics</span> (1781). Hume's name is not mentioned, but the context can readily be inferred: in the preface Balguy describes it as a specimen of a larger work on natural religion, &#145;why published at this time, will be too easily conjectured&#146;  (Balguy, <span class="italic">Divine Benevolence Asserted</span>, iii). It is interesting as an illustration of what he was lecturing on at St John's in the 1740s and 1750s (his arguments are mainly drawn from Cicero and Butler), but disappointing as an answer to Hume. An oddity of the work is his enthusiasm for Hutcheson, his father's <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i>. He never completed it.<br>
<br>At one stage Balguy must have been ambitious for high office: Gray refers to him in a doggerel poem to Mason as &#145;<i>Balguy</i> with a Bishop in his belly!&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.993). In 1781 George III, who thought him &#145;the first Man in point of reputation in the Republic of Letters of either University&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, ed. Hurd, xxiii), offered him the see of Gloucester, but he refused on the grounds of ill health. In 1785 he published his <span class="italic">Discourses on Various Subjects</span> with a dedication to the king; they were reissued in 1822 with a second volume of unpublished manuscripts by his relation James Drake. Balguy died on 19 January 1795 at Winchester, and on 26 January was buried in the cathedral, where a tablet commemorates him as &#145;a strenuous and able defender of the Christian Religion and of the Church of England&#146;.<br>
