<span class="headword">Theed,  William, the younger</span>  (1804&#150;1891), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born at Trentham, Staffordshire, on 21 March 1804, the son of the <span class="occ">sculptor and painter</span> <a name="cosubject_27161"></a><span class="headword">William Theed the elder</span>  (1764&#150;1817) and his wife, Frances. William Theed the elder entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1786 and began his career as a painter showing classical subjects and portraits at the Royal Academy exhibitions from 1789. In 1790 he went to Italy, and from 1791 he was working in Rome, where his close friends were the artists John Frearson and Henry Howard. He is said to have married a French woman, Mlle Rougeot, in Naples which he visited in 1795. After returning to England in 1796 he worked as a modeller for the Staffordshire firm of Wedgwood (1800&#150;1804) and afterwards as a designer for the silversmiths Rundell and Bridge (1804&#150;17). His sculptures include <span class="italic">Thetis Returning from Vulcan with Arms for Achilles</span> (exh. RA, 1812; Royal Collection) and the relief on the monument to Thomas Westfaling (1817) in St Mary's Church, Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire. He was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1811 and Royal Academician in 1813.<br>
<br>After receiving some instruction in art from his father, the younger Theed worked for several years in the studio of the sculptor E. H. Baily. On 15 January 1820 he was admitted as a student to the Royal Academy Schools, where he won a silver medal in 1822. He also won a silver palette from the Society of Arts in 1820 for a figure of Hercules, and two years later he gained its silver Isis medal. In 1826 Theed went to Rome, where he is said to have studied under the Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen and the Italian Pietro Tenerani, as well as with John Gibson and R. J. Wyatt. He developed a close friendship with Gibson and later acted as a contact between Gibson and some of his patrons in England. Theed worked in a studio at 9 via degli Incurabili, near the piazza del Popolo, where he executed some classicizing ideal works&#151;such as <span class="italic">A Nymph Preparing her Bow for the Chase</span> (marble, 1837; priv. coll.)&#151;and many portrait busts, including those of the duke of Lucca and the prince and princess of Capua (all exh. RA, 1839). In 1844&#150;5, after nearly twenty years in Rome, he received the commission which marked a turning point in his career, when Prince Albert, the prince consort, asked Gibson to send designs by sculptors working in Rome for statues to be placed in Osborne House, Isle of Wight. Two designs by Theed were accepted, <span class="italic">Narcissus at the Fountain</span> and <span class="italic">Psyche Lamenting the Loss of Cupid</span> (both marble, 1847; Royal Collection).<br>
<br>Theed returned to London in 1848 and soon established a highly successful professional practice. He had married, in London in 1839, Mary Ann Arnett (1814&#150;1894), with whom he had at least three sons and two daughters. At the Great Exhibition of 1851 he showed three works, the <span class="italic">Narcissus</span>, <span class="italic">Prometheus</span> (marble, 1851; priv. coll.), and <span class="italic">The Prodigal's Return</span> (marble version, 1850; Usher Gallery, Lincoln), the last a life-size elaborately carved narrative group, which heralded Theed's mature style as a sculptor of naturalistic set pieces. He made further works for the prince consort, notably <span class="italic">Sappho</span> (marble, 1851; Royal Collection), some busts after the antique, and a series of mythological reliefs for the reception rooms of Buckingham Palace. His <span class="italic">The Bard</span> (marble, 1858; Mansion House, London), a subject from Thomas Gray's poem of the same name, was one of sixteen statues by leading sculptors commissioned by the corporation of London for the Egyptian Hall in the Mansion House. In the mid-1850s Theed made a series of twelve bas-reliefs illustrating scenes from Tudor history (bronze, cast by Elkingtons, <i>c</i>.1852&#150;8) for the prince's chamber in the Palace of Westminster.<br>
<br>The mainstay of Theed's production, however, lay in the field of portraiture, and he received commissions for many major commemorative statues during his career. They included James Watt (bronze, 1857; Piccadilly Gardens, Manchester, after Chantrey), Sir Isaac Newton (bronze, 1858; St Peter's Hill, Grantham), and Edmund Burke (marble, 1858; St Stephen's Hall, Palace of Westminster, London). For St George's Hall, Liverpool, he made the statues of Edward Stanley, fourteenth earl of Derby (marble, 1869) and Henry Booth (marble, <i>c</i>.1874), and for Manchester town hall Charles Pelham Villiers (marble, 1876), John Bright (marble, 1878), and William Ewart Gladstone (marble, 1879). His principal church monuments were those to Sir James Mackintosh (marble, 1855) and Sir Herbert Benjamin Edwardes (marble, 1868) in Westminster Abbey and to Henry Hallam (marble, 1862) in St Paul's Cathedral, and the memorial to the seventeenth-century benefactor Humphrey Chetham (marble, 1853) in Manchester Cathedral. This last, a richly carved seated figure, portraying the subject in Jacobean dress, was reproduced in Parian ware ceramics with several other designs by the sculptor. Theed's portrait busts included those of John Gibson (marble, 1852; Conwy parish church, north Wales; replicas, <i>c</i>.1868, RA and NPG), Sir Henry Holland (marble, 1873; NPG), Victoria Mary Louisa, duchess of Kent (marble, 1861), Queen Victoria (bronze, 1864), and Prince Albert (marble, 1862) (the last three all Royal Collection, several versions).<br>
<br>As Theed was one of the sculptors most favoured by the prince consort, it was appropriate that he should be chosen by Queen Victoria in 1861 to take the death mask of the prince. In the following years Theed executed several notable memorial statues of Prince Albert, including those at Balmoral Castle (marble, 1863; bronze replica, 1867) and Coburg, Bavaria (bronze, 1865), and replicas for Sydney, Australia (bronze, 1866), Grimsby (bronze, 1879), and Bishop's Waltham (Royal Albert Infirmary) (terracotta replica made by J. M. Blashfield, 1865; destroyed). In 1868 he completed for the queen a romantic double portrait statue representing the royal couple in Anglo-Saxon costume (marble, 1863&#150;7; Royal Collection). Also known as <span class="italic">The Parting</span>, the group, which symbolizes Anglo-German ties and the royal couple's future reunion, again displays the bravura handling of historical costume in which Theed came to excel. The sculptor's crowning achievement was his group <span class="italic">Africa</span> (marble, 1865&#150;71), one of four colossal allegories of continents placed on the outer corners of the Albert Memorial in Hyde Park. Centred on a figure of an Egyptian queen seated on a camel, the work consists of a variety of figures representing the different African peoples together with symbols of African culture and history.<br>
<br>Despite his early immersion in the studios of the neo-classical sculptors in Rome, Theed developed into a versatile and eclectic sculptor who was equally at ease with classicizing ideal works, historical realism, and modern life portraiture. His successful practice and large output&#151;he showed more than eighty works at the Royal Academy between 1824 and 1885&#151;was underpinned by the extensive patronage of the English royal family. He died of old age on 9 September 1891, at his home, Campden Lodge, Campden Hill, Kensington, London, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
