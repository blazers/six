<span class="headword">Pritchett,  Robert Taylor</span>  (1828&#150;1907), <span class="occ">gun maker and landscape painter</span>, was born, probably in London, on 24 February 1828, the son of Richard Ellis Pritchett (<i>c</i>.1782&#150;1866), and his wife, Ann Dumbleton. His father was head of the firm of Enfield gun makers, which supplied arms to the East India Company and to the Board of Ordnance. Educated at King's College School, London, he entered his father's firm, taking charge&#151;at an early age&#151;of the royal small arms factory at Enfield. He was made free of the Gunmakers' Company by patrimony and took livery in 1849, and he was gun maker at 86 St James's St, London, from 1856 to 1862. By 1852 Pritchett was working with William Ellis Metford; they invented the Pritchett rifle bullet with &#145;a hollow and unplugged base which did much to counteract the eccentricity of the Enfield Rifle&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 20 June 1907). The invention brought Pritchett fame, the nickname the Father of the Enfield Rifle, and an award of &pound;1000 from the government on its adoption by the small-arms committee. He married Louisa Kezia McRae (<i>d</i>. 1899) on 22 September 1857; they had a son and a daughter. His wife and both children predeceased him.<br>
<br>With the abolition of the East India Company in 1858, Pritchett's firm lost its principal customer and he made a new career for himself as an artist. However, he continued to lecture on gunlocks and rifles, remaining a lifelong liveryman of the Gunmakers' Company; he was also an original member of the Victoria Rifles. As an artist he retained, as his device, an ancient harquebusier and his gun&#151;an allusion to his early trade&#151;and he drew the illustrations for Sir Sibbald Scott's <span class="italic">The British Army</span> (1868). Pritchett helped to establish the London Working Men's College, and in 1851, 1852, 1869, and 1871 he exhibited at the Royal Academy. In the 1860s, probably through his friendship with John Tenniel, Pritchett joined the staff of <span class="italic">Punch</span>, made some twenty-six drawings for publication, and became a close friend of Charles Keene, John Leech, and Myles Birket Foster. He travelled in Britain and abroad and exhibited views of the continent. In 1868, while in the Netherlands, he met the painter Jozef Isra&euml;ls and dined at the palace of Het Loo with the Belgian king Leopold II. In the same year and in 1870 he exhibited views of Scheveningen at the Royal Academy and in 1871 he published <span class="italic">Brush Notes in Holland</span>; other publications included <span class="italic">Smokiana: Historical and Ethnographical, etc</span>, published in facsimile by photochromolithography in 1890. In 1874&#150;5 he visited Norway and subsequently published <span class="italic">Gamle Norge</span> (1878), and he illustrated twenty-four articles on Norway in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> in 1877&#150;8.<br>
<br>In March 1868 Queen Victoria bought two of Pritchett's watercolours of Scotland, perhaps through the duchess of Atholl. This signalled the beginning of sustained royal patronage of the artist. A sketch of Skye was shown at Agnew's in 1868 and two exhibitions of Pritchett's views of the Netherlands were held there in 1869; more were shown in later years. Princess Louise visited an exhibition in 1869 and, in 1870, she and Lord Lorne visited the artist's house, the New Lodge, at Esher, Surrey. In June 1868 Pritchett had requested permission to sketch at Claremont near by, and in 1870 he showed his work to Queen Victoria, who acquired sketches of Esher. The prince of Wales bought two views of Denmark; in November 1871 he saw Pritchett's drawings of Paris during the Franco-Prussian War, published as <span class="italic">Paris 1871: under the Reign of the Commune</span>.<br>
<br>A keen and expert yachtsman, by 1899 Pritchett had been made marine painter to the Royal Thames yacht club. Between 1880 and 1882 he went round the world with Joseph Lambert and his wife on their yacht and illustrated their book <span class="italic">The Voyage of the &#145;Wanderer&#146;</span> (1883). In 1883 and 1885 he travelled as artist on the journeys of Sir Thomas and Lady Brassey on the <i>Sunbeam</i>. His illustrations appear in Lady Brassey's <span class="italic">In the Trades, the Tropics and the Roaring Forties</span> (1885) and <span class="italic">The Last Voyage of the &#145;Sunbeam&#146;</span> (1889). Pritchett lectured about his travels and exhibited his work in London between 1884 and 1890. His illustrations appear in the 1890 edition of Charles Darwin's <span class="italic">Voyage of the &#145;Beagle&#146;</span> and in the <span class="roman">Badminton Volumes</span> on <span class="italic">Yachting</span> (1894) and <span class="italic">Sea Fishing</span> (1895). He also published <span class="italic">Pen and Pencil Sketches: Shipping and Craft All Round the World</span> (1899).<br>
<br>From 1872 Queen Victoria commissioned from Pritchett over eighty watercolours of ceremonies relating to her golden and diamond jubilees and scenes of family events; these are now in the Royal Collection. She was delighted to have found an artist able to record on a small scale, and at small expense, the many events of her later years. Pritchett was also prepared to accept criticism and, at her request, to make corrections to his watercolours. He attended many ceremonies, anxious to be commissioned to paint the scenes for his royal patron. On 7 September 1898 he suggested publishing a book containing thirty sketches made for the queen, for &#145;without the Queen's favour the Sketches are things of the past, with it they will be Kings of the Future&#146;  (Windsor Castle, Royal Archives, PP Vic 1209), but the scheme was never carried out. Queen Victoria's death in 1901 was a great blow to Pritchett, &#145;depriving him as it did of a <i>quasi</i> right of <i>entr&eacute;e</i> on grand occasions&#146; and &#145;closing one of the principal sources of his slender income&#146;  (<span class="italic">Catalogue</span>, 7).<br>
<br>Pritchett died, after months of illness, on 16 June 1907 at Burghfield, Berkshire, the village where he lived. He was buried in the churchyard at Burghfield. The sale of his memorabilia, books, and watercolours, held by Haslam &amp; Son at Reading on 30&#150;31 October 1907, contained many of his own versions of watercolours painted for the queen; some were purchased by Edward VII. Pritchett's works fetched low prices; his obituarist in <span class="italic">The Times</span> (20 June 1907) rightly described him as &#145;a man of strangely varied talent who had in some measure outlived his fame&#146;.<br>
