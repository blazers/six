<span class="headword">Cates,  Arthur</span>  (1829&#150;1901), <span class="occ">surveyor</span>, was born on 29 April 1829 at 38 Alfred Street, Bedford Square, London, the son of James Cates and his wife, Susan, daughter of John Rose. After education at King's College School, London, he joined the office of Sydney Smirke RA as a pupil in 1846. From 1852 to 1859 he was an assistant to Sir James Pennethorne, and in 1870 succeeded him as architect to the land revenues of the crown under the commissioners of woods and forests, a position he held until 1898. This gave him considerable artistic control over the architecture of the crown estates in London. His temperament ideally suited him to this position. Cates's friends described him as pugnacious but professional, though sometimes &#145;a little too prone to show and use his strength&#146;. Cates saw himself as a drill sergeant, and was never happier than when in charge  (<span class="italic">RIBA Journal</span>, 353&#150;4). His own architectural works were few but included St Mary, Cowes, Isle of Wight (1867), and a number of houses and commercial buildings in London. In 1887 as surveyor to the Honourable Society of the Inner Temple he designed the archway and gatehouse that lead from Tudor Street to King's Bench Walk.<br>
<br>Cates joined the Architectural Association in 1847, and became an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1856, a fellow in 1874, and a member of the council in 1879; he served as vice-president from 1888 to 1892. He was important in pressing for a systematic course of training for architects, with the particular aim of improving their practical knowledge. From 1882 to 1896 he was chairman of the institute's board of examiners, and under his guidance a system of progressive examinations (preliminary, intermediate, and final) was established. He was also a fellow of the Surveyors' Institution. From 1858 to 1892 Cates was honorary secretary of the Architectural Publication Society, and contributed to its six-volume <span class="italic">Dictionary of Architecture</span> (1852&#150;92), edited by his friend Wyatt Papworth. He was first chairman of the tribunal of appeal under the <span class="roman">London Building Act</span> from 1894 until his death.<br>
<br>In 1881 Cates married Rosa, daughter of William Rose. They had no children. He died at his home, 12 York Terrace, Regent's Park, London, on 15 May 1901, and was cremated at Woking on 18 May. His wife survived him. He left an estate valued at over &pound;197,000.<br>
