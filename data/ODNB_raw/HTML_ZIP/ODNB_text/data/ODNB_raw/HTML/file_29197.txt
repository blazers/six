<span class="headword">Whethamstede <span class="st"> [Bostock]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1392&#150;1465), <span class="occ">scholar and abbot of St Albans</span>, was probably born at Wheathampstead, Hertfordshire, <i>c</i>.1392&#151;in 1442 he was described as being &#145;in about his fiftieth year&#146;  (<span class="italic">CEPR letters</span>, 9.266). His father, Hugh Bostock (<i>c</i>.1360&#150;<i>c</i>.1430), was a landowner originally from the west midlands who had settled at Wheathampstead following his marriage to Margaret (<i>c</i>.1370&#150;<i>c</i>.1420), daughter of Sir Thomas Makery. This and other fortunate marriages seem to have raised the Bostocks from the ranks of the lesser gentry, so that in old age John could claim kinship with local nobles like Elizabeth, Lady Sudeley. John was the eldest child and only son, and as a result he appears to have retained control of the family estates and manors despite his later monastic career.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareerandpromotion"></a>Early career and promotion</h2>According to a family memoir, Whethamstede attended a local grammar school &#145;at a young age&#146; (<i>ad annos dociles</i>), and proved himself a proficient scholar (<i>multum proficiens</i>; BL, Harley MS 139 fol. 91<i>r</i>). Before he was sixteen, however, between <i>c</i>.1405 and <i>c</i>.1408, he had entered St Albans as a novice. His unusually early admission, though probably a testimony to his promise as a scholar, must also have been a product of close family ties with the monastery: his uncle, William Whethamstede, had been a distinguished prior of the St Albans cell at Tynemouth, where his cousin John had also been a monk. Following his profession Whethamstede was sent to study at Gloucester College, the Benedictine studium in Oxford. Making rapid progress there, as early as 1414 he served as the college's <i>prior studentium</i>, and in 1417, after less than a decade of study, he incepted as doctor of theology.<br>
<br>Whethamstede probably returned to St Albans in the same year or shortly after, and on 2 September 1420 was elected abbot. His election was exceptional for a monk so young, and again reflected his reputation as a man of considerable intellectual capabilities. The expectation that attended his election might explain the fact that within the first months of his administration he was drawn into national ecclesiastical and political affairs. In May 1421 he was selected, together with five other more senior abbots, to represent the Benedictines before the king's commissioners at the Council of Westminster. Henry V had convened the council to examine the case for monastic reform, a case vigorously rejected by the monks. Although the youngest of the negotiators, Whethamstede emerged as his order's most able spokesman, and it was he who compiled and presented the proposals that eventually sealed an agreement between the parties. His compromise recommendations for reform were adopted throughout the English communities and also formed the basis of his own internal reforms which he introduced during visitations at St Albans and its cells in 1422&#150;3.<br>
<br>Whethamstede was again called upon to represent his order in spring 1423, as a delegate at the Council of Pavia. His journey to Italy took him through much of Germany, and he remained for some time at Ulm and Worms. During the council Whethamstede fell into a bitter dispute with Richard Flemming, bishop of Lincoln, from whose episcopal jurisdiction the St Albans monks claimed complete exemption. Flemming appears to have threatened to raise the question of St Albans' status before the pope, but the bishop's health collapsed, and when he did reach Rome some time later he was reconciled to the abbot. Whethamstede followed the council when it removed to Siena, and then travelled to Rome for his own audience with Martin V to secure confirmation of St Albans' most important privileges. Before he could complete his suit he was taken ill with dysentery, and was later said to have survived only through the intercession of St Alban himself, and following a vision in which St Bernard appeared and reassured him that he would live. Following his recovery he successfully concluded an agreement with the pope which provided both recognition of the abbey's existing privileges and also a number of important new dispensations.<h2>
<a name="Thefirstabbacy"></a>The first abbacy</h2>Whethamstede returned to St Albans in February 1424. He devoted much of the rest of the 1420s and 1430s to internal reforms, and to reviving the material condition of the community. From 1425 to 1426 he conducted a thorough visitation of the dependent cells. He dissolved the priory at Beadlow entirely, and devised reform constitutions for the communities at Redbourne and Tynemouth. He embarked on an extensive programme of rebuilding, spending &pound;2334 on fabric and furnishings, including &pound;641 on plate and vestments alone. He expended a further &pound;2000 on conventual properties outside the abbey, including a large contribution to the new buildings at Gloucester College. He also reorganized the abbey's financial administration, spending more than &pound;1000 on the acquisition of new properties, and creating a new office of &#145;master of works&#146; to supervise the distribution of resources. In the later 1420s and 1430s Whethamstede also made renewed efforts through litigation and negotiation to defend the abbey's endowments and extend its exemptions and other privileges. In 1428 he won a case against the abbot of Westminster over claims to certain manors. He also worked to establish new guarantees for the abbey's long-standing claims of independence from episcopal and secular authorities. In 1425 he negotiated royal recognition of the exemptions and privileges recently confirmed by the pope. Between 1431 and 1433 he also successfully challenged efforts by William Alnwick, bishop of Norwich, to subject the cell at Binham, Norfolk, to episcopal visitation. Whethamstede's monks regarded these battles over properties and privileges as among their abbot's most significant achievements: when his portrait was added to the <span class="italic">Liber benefactorum</span> after his death he was depicted proudly clutching bulls and charters to his chest.<br>
<br>In pursuing these cases Whethamstede benefited from the support of a number of distinguished allies among the senior clergy, the nobility, and the court circle. He appears to have cultivated friendships with such figures as Cardinal Henry Beaufort, Thomas Beckington, dean of the court of arches, Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick, and John, duke of Bedford. However, his closest relationship was with the protector, Humphrey, duke of Gloucester. Gloucester was a frequent visitor to St Albans and in 1423 Whethamstede granted him, his wife, and his retinue rights of confraternity. Their friendship seems to have been based on mutual intellectual interests, focused in particular on the work of Italian classical scholars. However there was also a political dimension to the alliance: Gloucester was Beaufort's rival for influence over the king and in the 1430s and 1440s an early focus of opposition towards Henry VI and his advisers. In the 1420s Whethamstede seems to have used his connection with the duke as a defence against Beaufort, who showed some hostility towards St Albans. But when the king declared his majority in 1437 and Gloucester was reduced to an isolated and increasingly suspect figure, Whethamstede became more openly partisan. When the duke died in captivity in 1447 the abbot sued for custody of his remains, and had them interred in the abbey church in a chantry he may have originally prepared for himself.<h2>
<a name="Resignationandsecondabbacy"></a>Resignation and second abbacy</h2>By the end of the 1430s Whethamstede's work of reconstruction and reform had placed considerable strain on conventual resources and his continuous disputes had damaged his own public reputation, leaving him physically exhausted, and even allowing dissension to emerge within the community. In November 1440 he resigned the abbacy and retired to his own manor at Wheathampstead. The abbot himself seems to have blamed his difficulties on his external and internal opponents, although he also recognized that his public image had been tarnished, confessing that he found himself increasingly awkward in confrontations and was &#145;given to excessive blushing&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annales &hellip; Amundesham</span>, 2.234). His monks, however, attributed his failure to his own inflated ambitions, which had led to almost unrestrained prodigality with conventual resources. Whethamstede seems to have left St Albans precipitately, leaving books and other personal items behind which he never recovered. His activities during his retirement remain obscure: it seems likely he spent much of the time pursuing his scholarly interests, although he may have returned to St Albans briefly in 1447 to supervise the burial of Humphrey of Gloucester. Following the death of Abbot John Stoke in January 1452, Whethamstede was persuaded to return to St Albans and on 16 January was re-elected abbot. Stoke's administration had proved disastrous and there seems to have been a small but vocal minority that had been working to secure Whethamstede's return since the late 1440s. Even so, his re-election appears to have been an eleventh-hour decision, coming only after other candidates had withdrawn. The townspeople were said to have rejoiced at Whethamstede's re-election, describing it as a miracle comparable to Saul's transformation on the road to Damascus.<br>
<br>Whethamstede's second administration was undoubtedly more troubled than his first, but none the less he continued to make significant improvements to the fabric and fortunes of the abbey. In an address following his election he outlined a wide-ranging programme for reform, with a particular emphasis on reviving the intellectual activities of the monks: the number of monks attending the universities was to be increased and teachers and preachers were to be provided to direct the studies of the monks in the cloister. He also launched a detailed review of the administration of his obedientiaries: the audit for 1452 had revealed a significant fall in conventual income despite the abundant harvests and rising prices that had prevailed throughout the 1440s. The review revealed serious maladministration on the part of the bursar and official-general, William Wallingford, and further evidence of corruption emerged in 1454. Whethamstede was unable to pursue charges against Wallingford because of the latter's powerful position within the community, but he did succeed in dismissing some corrupt lesser officials, including his own secretary, who was known to be a habitual frequenter of taverns.<br>
<br>Whethamstede also resumed his efforts to defend and extend the abbey's properties and privileges in the face of royal and seigneurial intervention. He initiated litigation against a number of local lords, and entered into a protracted dispute with the royal exchequer over infringements of the abbey's rights during Stoke's rule. He recovered a loan of &pound;600 from Henry VI, and in 1456 successfully petitioned for confirmation and resumption of all gifts and grants made to the abbey since the beginning of the reign, including the significant privilege of a remission of &pound;20 on all clerical tenths levied by the crown. Whethamstede also continued to make improvements to the abbey buildings. He constructed a self-contained library building to provide a new focus for the studies of the monks, he glazed the cloister windows, and rebuilt the parochial chapel of St Andrew.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsanddeath"></a>Last years and death</h2>Despite his advancing age, throughout his second administration Whethamstede continued to be drawn into public affairs. In the late 1450s he was involved in discussions over the planned crusade against the Turks: two Hungarian clerics visited St Albans in 1457 to discuss the matter, and in 1459 he also met the papal legate to consider the issue. He also seems to have become involved in the case against Reginald Pecock, bishop of Chichester, whose writings were condemned as heretical in 1459: Whethamstede's register is filled with detailed notes on Pecock's conclusions. In the political struggles between Henry VI and his opponents, Whethamstede seems at first to have strongly opposed the king and his followers, and in the early 1450s he supported parliamentary demands for the posthumous exoneration of Humphrey of Gloucester from accusations of treason. But after military conflict began he became less partisan: following the first battle of St Albans, on 22 May 1455, he demanded that the duke of York make proper provision for the burial of the dead, and himself offered, and subsequently provided, burial places in the abbey church for the bodies of Beaufort, Clifford, and Percy. After two decades of poor relations, he also made new overtures to the king, and as late as 1458 invited Henry VI to spend Easter at St Albans. According to his register, as the political crisis intensified after 1460 Whethamstede became increasingly depressed, and following the second battle of St Albans in February 1461 he recommended that the community be temporarily dispersed, and himself probably withdrew to his family manor, there to pursue the contemplative life.<br>
<br>From the mid-1450s Whethamstede suffered increasing infirmity, and he was forced to delegate daily administration to his officials. Too ill to attend the Coventry parliament in 1459, in 1460 he was forced to cede the direction of a lawsuit against Lord Sudeley to his archdeacon because of his sickness. Shortly afterwards he appears to have retired from active life at St Albans and returned to Wheathampstead: an abbatial document dated 1464 was issued &#145;from our house of solitary residence at Makery End&#146;  (Riley, 2.23). He died, probably at Wheathampstead, on 20 January 1465 and was buried in the abbey church, in the chantry chapel which he himself had constructed, before the 25th. His death does not seem to have been marked with great ceremony at St Albans, an indication perhaps that he had few supporters remaining in the community, and it is significant that within a decade William Wallingford, the monk whose fraud he exposed in the 1450s, was himself elected abbot.<br>
<br>Whethamstede was the leading Benedictine of his time, a defender of traditional monastic interests, but also a champion of monastic reform. In addition to his involvement in the council of 1421 he served three times as president of the Benedictine general chapter, and also organized the Benedictine delegation to the Council of Basel in 1440. He was especially energetic in his promotion of the monastic studia at Oxford and Cambridge, and in his later years became Gloucester College's most important benefactor, funding the construction of both its chapel and library. Through his extensive and lively correspondence he also encouraged other abbots to adopt his devotional and educational reforms in their own communities. These achievements notwithstanding, Whethamstede probably never fulfilled his full potential as a prelate: increasingly his public role was undermined by arrogance, litigiousness, and ill-advised political alliances.<h2>
<a name="Scholarandmanofletters"></a>Scholar and man of letters</h2>Indeed, Whethamstede's most significant achievements were not as an abbot but as an educationist, a scholar, and writer. Regarding intellectual activities as being at the heart of the monastic life, he devoted considerable effort and expense, during both his administrations, to make better provision for the studies of his monks. He had a large number of new books produced for the conventual library, which he himself described as &#145;the best in the whole country&#146;  (BL, Egerton MS 646 fol. 105<i>r</i>). He also commissioned new works for the use of the monks, including an English life of St Alban and St Amphibalus from John Lydgate, and a St Alban motet from the composer John Dunstaple. His own intellectual interests were very broad: although trained as a theologian he also studied and wrote on astronomy, grammar, history, philosophy, poetry, and politics. His surviving notebooks reveal him to have been an almost compulsive writer, their pages filled with a diverse range of letters, verses, and other scribbles. He was also an accomplished scribe and several of the extant St Albans books are copied in his own hand. Many of his own compositions were intended as aids to his studies, for instance, an analytical index to John of Salisbury's <span class="italic">Policraticus</span>. He also composed numerous commemorative verses relating to his own life, such as his defeat of his episcopal opponents in the 1420s and 1430s, and the construction of his library in the 1450s, and wrote several epitaphs. In the 1450s he also compiled and edited his own collection of letters.<br>
<br>Whethamstede's principal intellectual interests, however, were in classical scholarship and the new work of the Italian humanists, interests he had developed during his time in Oxford and as a result of his travels in Italy. He collected copies of classical and humanist texts and cultivated the friendship of Italian scholars. He was probably the first English scholar to cite Leonardo Bruni's translation of Aristotle's <span class="italic">Politics</span> and he also owned early copies of translations of Plato and of the Latin Plutarch. He sustained a brief correspondence with Piero da Monte, and according to Amundsham also met with other unidentified Italian scholars while at Florence in 1423. He also composed his own works in which he developed his interest in poetry and philosophy, ancient history, and mythography. His largest and most important work was the <span class="italic">Granarium</span> (its title was a deliberate pun on his own name), which combined material on a diverse range of historical and literary topics. Three of its four parts survive  (BL, Cotton MSS Nero C.vi; Tiberius D.v; Add. MS 26764). He also compiled a number of collections based on the work of classical and high-medieval writers: three of these, the <span class="italic">Palearium poetarum</span>, the <span class="italic">Pabularium poetarum</span>, and the <span class="italic">Manipularium doctorum</span>, survive in incomplete texts, while three more, the <span class="italic">Floriarium</span>, the <span class="italic">Propinarium</span>, and the <span class="italic">Proverbiarium</span>, have been lost.<br>
<br>These writings were compilations of extracts rather than self-contained commentaries, and are less important for the insights into the subject that they offer than for the wide range of sources from which they were drawn. Whethamstede demonstrated a remarkably wide knowledge of Latin and Greek classical texts, including Quintilian's <span class="italic">Institutes</span> and Cicero's <span class="italic">De oratore</span>, which had only recently been discovered. It would be mistaken, however, to suggest that Whethamstede's own work was comparable to that of the Italians: he cannot be described as a &#145;humanist&#146;. But he was among the first English scholars to promote the writings and values at the heart of the European classical revival in England, and his own compilations did play an important role in the transmission and reception of classical and humanist texts in English learned communities from the second half of the fifteenth century. Humphrey of Gloucester included a three-volume edition of Whethamstede's <span class="italic">Granarium</span> among the books he donated to Oxford University in 1437, and even in the early sixteenth century, under the nickname Frumentarius, his work continued to attract a considerable following.<br>
