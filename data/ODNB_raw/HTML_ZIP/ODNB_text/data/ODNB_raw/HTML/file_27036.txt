<span class="headword">Taylor,  James</span>  (1753&#150;1825), <span class="occ">naval engineer and potter</span>, was born on 3 May 1753 at Leadhills, Lanarkshire, the son of John Taylor, the overseer of the earl of Hopetoun's mines there. He was educated at Wallacehall School, Closeburn, Dumfriesshire, and then at Edinburgh University where he was a student from 1775 to 1781, studying medicine, mathematics, and natural philosophy. Sponsored by Hopetoun, he was destined for the ministry or medicine, but while in Edinburgh he became interested in a career &#145;where his love of chemistry, mechanics, and mineralogy could be put to good use&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ayr Advertiser</span>, 22 Sept 1825). After he left Edinburgh he seems to have set up a foundry and engineering works in Ayr in partnership with his brother John. Through his friendship with Alexander Fegusson of Craigendarroch, also in Dumfriesshire, Taylor was appointed tutor in 1785 to the children of Patrick Miller, who had newly acquired the Dalswinton estate. At the time Miller was devoting much of his time to experiments with the mechanical propulsion of ships on the Forth and almost certainly recruited Taylor to assist him as well as to teach his children. Taylor quickly suggested that the obvious solution was to replace hand-turned windlasses with a James Watt steam engine modified to drive paddle wheels. Through his father he introduced Miller to the engineer William Symington, and this led to the famous trials of a steamboat at Dalswinton in 1788 and on the Forth in 1789.<br>
<br>By this time Taylor had come to the notice of Margaret, countess of Dumfries, who was full of misplaced enthusiasm for introducing industrial practices to the family's Ayrshire estates, leaving behind a trail of half-completed projects and disappointed artisans. The countess, convinced that coalmining and iron-working were the road to wealth, commissioned Taylor in 1790 to carry out a mineral survey of the estate. In the following year the earl appointed him manager &#145;of the lime works, coal works, black lead or wadd works, ironstone, clays, leads and whole works or operations regarding every kind that are discovered or should be thereafter discovered&#146;  (Quail, 9). This was an ambitious prospectus which was never to be realized. Taylor's first project was to reopen the flooded black lead Craigman mine. When it was found that the quality was not good enough for pencils the countess turned her attention to making foundry crucibles and then to establishing a pottery. Her imagination quickly ran away with her and she conceived a sizeable venture with no consideration of whether her china would survive a journey across the bumpy roads of Ayrshire. It was James Taylor's misfortune to be given the task of supervising the establishment of the pottery at Cumnock, the nearest village to Dumfries House, in 1794. Nothing went well; the Glasgow potters, who were responsible for the day-to-day management, left within two years without producing a pot and debts mounted. In order to avoid bankruptcy Taylor, who was a partner in the business, had no alternative but to begin production. For almost twenty years he struggled to keep it going, making an attractive domestic creamware from local clays along with crucibles. In some years the pottery remained closed due to lack of demand, adding to Taylor's difficulties. Although Taylor managed the earl's coal mines efficiently the price of coal was depressed and local competition intense. He resigned in 1815, but continued to operate the pottery with rising debts which could be largely attributed to the terms of his lease.<br>
<br>In 1822 Taylor looked for some relief from the campaign to reward those who had been involved with the development of the steamboat. At first he took issue with the now dissolute William Symington about his role in this, and then after a meeting they came, as he thought, to an understanding. Early in 1823 he took out a patent (no. 4751) for the construction of ships' bottoms and the positioning of pumps to prevent damage to the cargo, and declared that he was engaged in other important developments. At the end of his tether, he petitioned parliament for a pension in April 1824. He died at Cumnock on 18 September 1825 before a decision was reached. Soon after his death Symington and his supporters attacked the accuracy of Taylor's claim to have contributed to the development of the steamboat and dismissed him simply as a schoolteacher. After a long struggle against the continuing attacks from Symington (himself desperate for money), Taylor's widow was granted a pension of &pound;50 p.a. and his surviving daughters were awarded a bounty of &pound;50 apiece. Taylor was included in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> along with all those who had been associated with the beginnings of steam propulsion; but in reality he deserved inclusion as a representative of all those men and women who nurtured small enterprise often at considerable cost to themselves during the first phase of industrialization and by so doing laid the foundation of Britain's later prosperity.<br>
