<span class="headword">Smith, Sir  (Charles) Aubrey</span>  (1863&#150;1948), <span class="occ">actor and cricketer</span>, was born on 21 July 1863 at 9 Finsbury Place South, London, the son of Charles John Smith, a doctor, and his wife, Sarah Ann Clode. He was educated at Charterhouse School and St John's College, Cambridge (1881&#150;4), where he studied medicine. Smith earned a great reputation as a cricketer, captaining the university eleven and, on graduating from Cambridge, becoming captain of the Sussex county team in 1886 and subsequently captain of the England eleven on tour in Australia and South Africa.<br>
<br>Aubrey Smith first appeared on the professional stage with A. B. Tapping's company at Hastings in 1892. In 1894 he played Aubrey Tanqueray on tour with Mrs Patrick Campbell's company in Arthur Wing Pinero's <span class="italic">The Second Mrs Tanqueray</span>; and first appeared on the London stage on 13 March 1895, playing the Revd Amos Winterfield in another Pinero play, <span class="italic">The Notorious Mrs Ebbsmith</span>. He rapidly became a well-known leading actor, appearing with John Hare, George Alexander, Fred Terry, Mrs Patrick Campbell, Johnston Forbes-Robertson, and other famous actor&#150;managers. On 15 August 1896 he married Isabella Mary Scott (<i>b</i>. 1871/2), daughter of Major Alexander Wood.<br>
<br>Between 1898 and 1900 Aubrey Smith was the business manager of the St James's Theatre but returned to acting in 1900. From 1904 onward he began to accept engagements in the United States as well as in London. There was no year, indeed, between 1900 and 1930, when he did not appear in a new production (sometimes of a new play, sometimes of a revival) in either London or New York, his first appearance in the latter city being in 1911. In the pursuit of this international acting career he is said to have crossed the Atlantic over a hundred times&#151;in an age when each journey took five or six days each way.<br>
<br>From 1915 onward Aubrey Smith appeared in numerous silent films and successfully negotiated the tricky transformation to sound films in the 1930s. From then on he became better known as a film actor than a stage actor; he was never a &#145;film star&#146; but was a very sound and reliable player of supporting &#145;character&#146; roles, specializing in upper-class English gentlemen, and being seen in dozens of films. These included <span class="italic">Lives of a Bengal Lancer</span> (1934) and <span class="italic">Clive of India</span> (1934). Aubrey Smith made his home in the USA during the 1930s and 1940s, where he resided in Beverly Hills, close to Hollywood.<br>
<br>As a stage actor Aubrey Smith was most at ease in light, popular &#145;entertainment&#146; plays. Unlike his near-contemporary Robert Loraine, who enjoyed and rose to the challenge of playing Strindberg and Shakespeare, he very rarely undertook plays of any very serious import. However, he did once play a Shakespearian role (as Frederick in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> in 1896) and he appeared in <span class="italic">Votes for Women!</span> by Elizabeth Robins at the Court Theatre, under Harley Granville Barker's direction, in April and May 1907. He also played the lead in the first production of Clemence Dane's <span class="italic">A Bill of Divorcement</span> at the St Martin's Theatre in 1921. St John Ervine, the theatre critic for <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, noted that he managed in this &#145;to do what was almost impossible, retain sympathy for a sympathetic character at a moment when that character is behaving in an incomprehensible and unsympathetic fashion&#146;  (20 March 1921). The play was something of a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>. Among the better-known popular plays of the day in which Aubrey Smith also played leading parts were <span class="italic">The Liars</span> by Henry Arthur Jones (1916), A. A. Milne's <span class="italic">Mr Pim Passes By</span> (1922), W. Somerset Maugham's <span class="italic">The Constant Wife</span> (1926, in New York), and J. Galsworthy's <span class="italic">Old English</span> (1941 and 1943, in San Francisco and on tour in America).<br>
<br>Aubrey Smith was never a great actor, but he was a very popular performer of great charm, technical proficiency, energy, and industry. Early in his career, Max Beerbohm, then a distinguished theatre critic, was struck by his limitations, which sprang from a certain over-solemnity and a trivializing lack of inner seriousness. Reviewing one of his early performances, in <span class="italic">The Finding of Nancy</span> (1902) by Netta Syrett, Beerbohm wrote that &#145;Smith, in manner and costume, was more like a cavalry officer than an obscure journalist. He came amiss in the milieu of the play. But he did his best&#146;  (Beerbohm, <span class="italic">More Theatres</span>, 467). Beerbohm was equally critical of his role in Oscar Wilde's <span class="italic">Lady Windermere's Fan</span> in 1904. As Lord Darlington, Smith had to say &#145;the extravagant and silly things&#146; for which Lady Windermere reproves him. Unfortunately, Beerbohm considered that he spoke &#145;with all the portentousness of an eminent physician examining an invalid&#146;  (ibid., 103&#150;4). In 1905 Aubrey Smith played Colonel Gray in the first production of J. M. Barrie's <span class="italic">Alice Sit-by-the-Fire</span>. Beerbohm commented that he &#145;might surely manage to behave rather more like an amiable and quite ordinary colonel who is glad to be home among his family, and rather less like a distinguished general whose career has just been blasted by failure in a crucial campaign. He might, in fact, play lightlier&#146;  (ibid., 155&#150;6).<br>
<br>Even in 1905 Aubrey Smith was an old-fashioned actor: tall, handsome, deft, and assured, he was as immune from the uneasy influence of the new drama of Ibsen, Shaw, Strindberg, Chekhov, Hauptmann, and Schnitzler as he was from the new theatre practices of Antoine, Stanislavsky, Copeau, Craig, and Meyerhold. Sensibly, he recognized his own m&eacute;tier. With the help of his agreeable personality and his abundant native energy he made a busy and successful career, especially in the USA. <span class="italic">Who's Who in the Theatre</span> lists no fewer than eighteen plays, between 1902 and 1943, in which Aubrey Smith played the part of a titled gentleman. His roles included Lord Darlington, Colonel Gray, Sir Marcus Ordeyne, the Marquis of Tallemont, the Hon. Geoffrey Stoner, Sir Philip Lilley, Sir Christopher Deering, Sir George Knowsley, Sir Theodore Frome, Sir Basil Winterton, and Sir Thomas Ryecroft. Finally, in 1944, he was himself knighted &#145;for services to the theatre&#146;.<br>
<br>Sir Aubrey Smith died at his home, 629 North Rexford Drive, Beverly Hills, California, on 20 December 1948 at the age of eighty-five. He was survived by his wife and a daughter.<br>
