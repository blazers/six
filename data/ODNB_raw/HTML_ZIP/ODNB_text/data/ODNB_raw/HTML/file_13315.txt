<span class="headword">Hill,  William</span>  (1618&#150;1667), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was the son of Blackleech Hill, an attorney of Hemlingford hundred in Warwickshire. He was born at Cudworth, Warwickshire, and matriculated at Merton College, Oxford, on 21 November 1634. By December 1638 he had received his BA degree, and he became a fellow of the college in 1639 owing to his proficiency in Greek, Latin, and physics. Shortly after his election as fellow he moved to Sutton Coldfield, to take the post of master of the free school there, where he proved to be as successful a schoolmaster as he had been a scholar. His marriage to a rich wife  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, vol. 3, col. 800) proved short-lived, his wife dying by 1641, the year when Hill received his MA degree from Oxford. Perhaps the death of his wife, to whom he was very much attached, was the reason why he decided to leave Warwickshire and travel to London to start a career as a physician.<br>
<br>Having made his name there Hill married again, this time to the daughter of another physician who had links to Sutton Coldfield. This latter marriage did not prove as happy as his first one, as a result of the scandal caused by the birth of a son seven months after the marriage. Hill tried in vain to convince his medical colleagues that the boy was conceived within the marriage, even going so far as to write a manuscript treatise on the subject. In the later 1640s he may have been at Oxford, where his name is included in the lists of those who submitted to the parliamentary visitation. Certainly he had leave to graduate BM and DM from Oxford on 8 June 1649. His dedication of his popular <span class="italic"><i>Dionysion oikoumen&#275;s peri&#275;g&#275;sis</i>: Dionysii orbis descriptio commentario critico et geographico &hellip; ac tabulis illustrata a Guilielmo Hill</span> (1658) to Henry Cromwell may account for his subsequent move to Ireland, where he became chief master of the cathedral school of St Patrick's, Dublin. However, on the Restoration he was forced out of this position and moved to Finglas, where he tutored privately. His only other work was an (unpublished) epitome of the physician Lazarus Riverius. Before his death he is reputed to have been given an honorary doctorate by Trinity College, Dublin. Hill died at Finglas as a result of a fever and was buried on 29 November 1667 in Finglas church. Little is known of his family save that the fever which killed him also killed &#145;most of his family&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, vol. 3, col. 801).<br>
<br>This William Hill is often confused with another <a name="cosubject_13314"></a><span class="headword">William Hill</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1647&#150;1662)<span class="occ"></span>, who likewise was a student of Merton College. The latter Hill was the son of a nonconformist of Herefordshire and followed his father's tendencies in this regard. He attended Merton from 1647 onwards. While it is unclear whether it was he or the former William who submitted to the parliamentary visitation on 12 May 1648, it seems more likely that it was the younger Hill. Wood's description of him as &#145;a tale-bearer to the parliamentarian visitors&#146; and &#145;a factious person&#146; substantiates this view  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, vol. 3, col. 801). On his departure from the university he became a parson, but because of his parliamentary sympathies lost his benefice on the Restoration. However, two years later, in 1662, he received &#145;a considerable benefice&#146; in Gloucestershire  (ibid., col. 802). The reason for this lies in the murky Tong plot. Hill seemingly heard of a plot among his former associates against the king. Whether Hill turned state's evidence or was a double agent is unclear, but his own relation of his role in his <span class="italic">Narrative of the Said Plot</span>, attached to the 1662 publication <span class="italic">A brief narrative of that stupendious tragedy, late intended to be acted by the satanical saints of these reforming times, humbly presented to the king's majesty</span>, depicts his involvement in a favourable light. He did not live to enjoy his benefice, dying a few years later.<br>
