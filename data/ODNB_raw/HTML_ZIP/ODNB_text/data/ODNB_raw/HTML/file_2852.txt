<span class="headword">Bonney,  Henry Kaye</span>  (1780&#150;1862), <span class="occ">dean of Stamford</span>, was born at Tansor, Northamptonshire, of which parish his father was then curate, on 22 May 1780, the son of Henry Kaye (or Key) Bonney, later rector of King's Cliffe and prebendary of Lincoln. His father's family friend Lord Westmorland procured for him a foundation scholarship at Charterhouse School, where he obtained an exhibition, and he went to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1798. Having been elected to a Tancred divinity studentship, he migrated to Christ's College in December 1798. He graduated BA in 1802, MA in 1805, and DD in 1824. He was ordained deacon in 1803, when he was licensed curate to his father at King's Cliffe, and was curate of Ketton and Tixover in Rutland, and Duddington in Northamptonshire from 1804 to 1807. Ordained priest in 1804, he was presented by his father to the perpetual curacy of Thurlby in Lincolnshire, which he held from 1804 to 1823. He was collated by Bishop Tomline on 8 January 1807 to the prebend of Nassington in Lincoln Cathedral.<br>
<br>Bonney was presented by the earl of Westmorland to the rectory of King's Cliffe in succession to his father, who died of paralysis on 20 March 1810. He published in 1815, with a dedication to the earl of Westmorland, the <span class="italic">Life of the Right Reverend Father in God, Jeremy Taylor, DD</span>. In 1821 Bonney dedicated to Lady Cicely Georgiana Fane his <span class="italic">Historic Notices in Reference to Fotheringay. Illustrated by Engravings</span> (done by his own hand). In 1820 he was appointed examining chaplain to George Pelham, the new bishop of Lincoln, and was collated by the same prelate on 10 December 1821 to the archdeaconry of Bedford. (An order in council, dated 19 April 1837, transferred the archdeaconry from the diocese of Lincoln to the diocese of Ely.) Bonney published the <span class="italic">Sermons and charges by the Right Reverend Father in God, Thomas Fanshaw Middleton, DD, late lord bishop of Calcutta. With memoirs of his life</span> in 1824. On 15 May 1827 he married Charlotte, the fourth daughter of John Perry, of Blackwall and of Moor Hall, Essex.<br>
<br>In 1827 Bonney was appointed to the deanery of Stamford by his close friend John Kaye, then recently translated from the see of Bristol to that of Lincoln, and was advanced by him, on 22 February 1845, from the archdeaconry of Bedford to that of Lincoln. Soon after his appointment he made a parochial visitation, recording each church's affairs and showing a nice sense of a visitation's purpose (see N. S. Harding, ed., <span class="italic">Bonney's Church Notes</span>, 1937). He shared Kaye's high-church sympathies. As an archdeacon Bonney was indefatigable. In the early part of 1858 he was seized with paralysis, and never entirely recovered. He died at the rectory, King's Cliffe, on 24 December 1862, and was buried in the churchyard of King's Cliffe with his wife, who had died childless on 26 December 1850 at King's Cliffe. Shortly before his death he had contributed &pound;500 to the restoration of the church at King's Cliffe.<br>
<br>Bonney published his charges to the clergy of the archdeaconry of Bedford for the years 1823, 1843, and 1844, and the various charges delivered to the clergy and churchwardens of the archdeaconry of Lincoln at the visitations of 1850, 1854, and 1856. He also contributed a sermon to the third volume of <span class="italic">Practical sermons by dignitaries and other clergymen of the united church of England and Ireland</span> (1846).<br>
