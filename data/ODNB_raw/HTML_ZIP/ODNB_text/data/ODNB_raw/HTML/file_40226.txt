<span class="headword">Skelton,  (Archibald) Noel</span>  (1880&#150;1935), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 1 July 1880 in Edinburgh, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25662/', "Sir John Skelton (1831&#150;1897)")</script>, advocate, author, and civil servant, and his wife, Anne Adair Lawrie (<i>b</i>. 1846/7, <i>d</i>. in or after 1897). He was educated at Trinity College, Glenalmond, the University of Edinburgh, and Christ Church, Oxford, where he took a second in history in 1903. From 1906 he was an advocate in the Scottish bar. He became a rising figure in Unionist Party politics, one friend recalling  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 Nov 1935) that he did much &#145;to make Toryism a live creed in Scotland and to shake the rooted Scottish political traditions&#146;. He stood unsuccessfully as parliamentary candidate for East Perthshire at the December 1910 general election. During the First World War he served with the Scottish Horse, a yeomanry regiment, reaching the rank of captain. Elected as MP for Perth at the 1922 election, he was defeated in 1923 but re-elected at the 1924 and 1929 elections. In the 1931 general election he was returned unopposed for the Combined Scottish Universities. He never married.<br>
<br>During the early 1920s Skelton's pre-war Unionist activism against Liberal predominance in Scotland turned into belief that a progressive Conservatism was needed to defeat the new &#145;socialist&#146; challenge throughout Britain. Here, for a back-bench MP, he had an unusual and enduring influence. In four articles in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> in April and May 1923, republished during the first Labour government in 1924 as a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Constructive Conservatism</span>, he coined the pregnant phrase &#145;a property-owning democracy&#146;. In truth, encouraging possession of private property among the working population was an obvious strategy against socialist collectivism and was already entering the rhetoric of Conservative leaders, although Baldwin used the precise phrase only in 1931. Nevertheless, in Skelton's presentation the concept was a fresh and radical restatement of Conservative &#145;philosophy&#146; appropriate for a &#145;new era&#146;: it would stabilize democracy, give wage-earners an economic status commensurate with their political enfranchisement, &#145;bridge the economic gulf &hellip; between Labour and Capital&#146;, and be the &#145;vehicle for the moral and economic progress of the individual&#146;  (<span class="italic">Constructive Conservatism</span>, 7, 24). His ideas appealed strongly to a loose group of younger, idealistic Conservatives in the 1924 parliament, known as the &#145;YMCA&#146;, who supported the progressive elements in Baldwin's Conservative government against what they regarded as the party's reactionary business members. Skelton took a leading part in the lobbying and journalistic activities of the group, his contributions including an article entitled &#145;Labour in the new era&#146;  (<span class="italic">QR</span>, 244, 1925). Several of the group's members&#151;Oliver Stanley, Walter Elliott, Robert Boothby, and Harold Macmillan&#151;and another friend, Anthony Eden, later became important figures, and through them Skelton unwittingly helped inspire interventionist Conservative &#145;middle way&#146; thinking from the 1930s. By a &#145;property-owning democracy&#146; he himself had meant a reinforcement of individualism through industrial profit sharing, agricultural smallholdings, and co-operative schemes. But after Eden revived the phrase at the 1946 Conservative conference and made it a leading party slogan, it became chiefly associated, particularly by Macmillan during the early 1950s, with state promotion of house ownership.<br>
<br>In their memoirs, Skelton's friends recalled him as &#145;thought-provoking&#146;, a &#145;great political teacher&#146;, and a &#145;superlative talker, with a tremendous vitality and zest for life&#146; (Eden, 12; Macmillan, 177&#150;8; Boothby, 138). But these qualities were imperfectly communicated to wider audiences. While younger associates received early and rapid ministerial promotion, only under the National Government in September 1931 did he become parliamentary under-secretary for Scotland. Here he supervised health, housing, and educational policies, but without striking departures. He served also on the Empire Marketing Board and on the government delegation to the League of Nations. He had one last, curious effect on public life. He stood again for the Combined Scottish Universities at the next general election, but died at 25 Belgrave Crescent, Edinburgh, on 22 November 1935, after the poll but before the declaration of the result&#151;creating the first modern case of a parliamentary candidate elected posthumously. The consequent by-election in January 1936 was notable for being used to secure a parliamentary seat for the former prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald, embarrassingly defeated in Seaham at the general election.<br>
