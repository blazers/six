<span class="headword">Scudder,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1652), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was probably born in Horton Kirby, Kent, in the mid-1580s, one of at least three sons of Henry Scudder and his wife, Elizabeth. Having been admitted to Christ's College, Cambridge, he probably graduated BA early in 1603; he proceeded MA in 1606. A near-contemporary at college was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29178/', "William Whately (1583&#150;1639)")</script>, who became lecturer and from 1610 vicar of Banbury, Oxfordshire. On 7 June 1608 Scudder married, at Banbury, Whately's sister-in-law Bridgett, daughter of George Hunt (1551/2&#150;1633), rector of Collingbourne Ducis, Wiltshire. At some date he acquired the living of Drayton, Oxfordshire; he had resigned it by 22 September 1619. He had joined the local combination of ministers led by John Dod, whose members included Whately, Robert Cleaver, and Robert Harris, and it was perhaps through it, and its lay patrons, that he managed to survive without a parish. His first publication, <span class="italic">A Key of Heaven</span> (1620), an application of the Lord's prayer, was dedicated to Thomas Crewe of Steane, the godly lawyer and Northamptonshire gentleman, in thankfulness for &#145;the many kindnesses you have shewed me&#146;  (sig. A4).<br>
<br>Following the death of his father-in-law, on 28 May 1633 Scudder was presented by the king to the rectory of Collingbourne Ducis. His most celebrated work, <span class="italic">The Christians Daily Walk with God</span>, had first appeared two years previously. In 1635 it reached its sixth edition, which contained an epistle written by the leading minister John Davenport. A German translation by Theodore Haak appeared in Frankfurt in 1636. There were at least nine further editions; the recommendations by John Owen and Richard Baxter in the 1674 edition are testimonies to the importance of this book to the religious and devotional life of the protestant community and its appeal to a broad range of presbyterian and congregational readers. As Baxter observed, the book is &#145;so prudent and spiritual, apt and savory the Directions, and all so fully suited to our ordinary cases and conditions, that I heartily wish no family might be without it&#146;  (Scudder, <span class="italic">The Christians Daily Walk in Holy Security and Peace</span>, 1674 edn, A4<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>As a literary executor with Edward Leigh to Whately, who died in 1639, Scudder brought to publication Whately's <span class="italic">Prototypes, or, The Primarie Presidents out of the Book of Genesis</span> (1640), and wrote the accompanying life of the author. On 5 May 1642 he was sanctioned by parliament as a lecturer for Warminster and in June of that year he joined the Westminster assembly. He was an active participant in its affairs, reviewing the proofs of the Westminster confession of faith and acting as a member of the committee for scriptures. His name appears at regular intervals in the minutes, but he was often recorded as absent. Preaching before parliament in October 1644 a sermon published as <span class="italic">Gods Warning to England by the Voyce of his Rod</span> (1644), Scudder called on members to repent their sins and lead a strictly devotional life to avert God's impending judgments on the nation. That year he also published an edition of Caleb Grantham's <span class="italic">The Godly Mans Choice</span>, a manual on marriage to which Scudder added his own &#145;profitable directions how persons should live as becometh Christians in the married state&#146;.<br>
<br>On 10 May 1645 Scudder was admitted as interim rector of St Mildred Poultry, London, and from there signed that year the petition addressed to the common council of the City by ministers who were dissatisfied with the proposed presbyterian organization of London parishes. By 1647 he had spent a brief period at St Andrew by the Wardrobe, but within a short time he seems to have returned to Wiltshire. He was at Collingbourne Ducis when he drew up his will on 12 February 1652. By this time his first wife had died and he had married Joyce, whose other name is unknown. Evidently a fairly prosperous man, he left land in Hurstbourne Tarrant, Hampshire and in Horton Kirby to his three married daughters&#151;Jane, wife of Richard Russell, Martha, wife of Thomas Jacob, and Bridgett, wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11360/', "John Grayle (1613/14&#150;1651/2)")</script> (who may have ministered at Collingbourne Ducis during Scudder's absence in London before moving to Tidworth in the same county). Legacies also went to his granddaughter Elizabeth, daughter of Elizabeth Scudder and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27505/', "John Tombes (1602&#150;1676)")</script>, the anti-paedobaptist minister, and to a number of relatives who had moved to New England, including his brother Thomas. He lived long enough to make a codicil on 20 March 1652, but died before 31 May when his will was proved, and was buried at Collingbourne.<br>
