<span class="headword">Mariner,  William Charles</span>  (1791&#150;1853), <span class="occ">traveller</span>, was born on 10 September 1791 at Highbury Place, Highbury, Middlesex, the son of Magnus Mariner (1742/3&#150;1823), who had followed a sea-going career, and his wife, Theodosia. At the age of thirteen, living at Wapping, he joined the privateer and whaler <i>Port-au-Prince</i>, about to sail to the Pacific Ocean. After an adventurous voyage the ship arrived at the Tonga (or Friendly) Islands in poor condition, hoping to carry out repairs. The crew met with a hostile reception and many of them were massacred. Mariner, however, was taken under the protection of the principal chief, Finau Ulukalala, who bestowed on him the name of one of his deceased sons, Toki Ukamea, and appointed one of his wives to be Mariner's adopted mother.<br>
<br>Mariner's residence in Tonga, mainly on the island of Vava'u, lasted for four years. During this time he became thoroughly conversant with the language and customs of this Polynesian people and he was on friendly terms with many of the chiefs, especially with Finau's son and successor. Using the guns from the <i>Port-au-Prince</i>, and helped by his surviving companions, he took a full and often decisive part in his protector's warlike campaigns against other islands. Eventually times became more peaceful and Toki attained the status of a chief, living on his own cultivated plantations.<br>
<br>When, towards the end of 1810, the brig <i>Favourite</i>, under Captain Fisk, from Port Jackson, arrived in Tongan waters Mariner, now nineteen, went aboard and worked his passage to Macau in China. From there he again worked a passage on the ship <i>Cuffnells</i>, on charter to the East India Company, and arrived at Gravesend in June 1811. Mariner undertook a further voyage, to the West Indies, of which no details are known, and returned to England the following year.<br>
<br>Mariner's account of the voyage on the <i>Port-au-Prince</i>, of his life in Tonga, together with the history, customs, and grammar and vocabulary of the language, was written by Dr John Martin, to whom Mariner had recounted his experiences. It was published in 1817 as <span class="italic">An Account of the Natives of the Tonga Islands</span>. Other editions followed and there were translations into French and German. The book was well reviewed, particularly by the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> (April 1817), and remained for many years the principal account of the Tonga Islands.<br>
<br>Mariner spent the remainder of his life in business in the City of London and became a stockbroker. He was involved in the exchequer bill affair of 1836&#150;41 when large sums of money in loans were raised on the security of bills later found to have been forgeries. The investigating commission was not able to decide whether Mariner had realized that the bills passing through his hands were forged. He sought to clear his name in the City by publishing a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Exchequer Bills Forgery: a Statement</span>, in 1843, which ran to two editions.<br>
<br>In his latter years Mariner lived at Gravesend, the port of departure and of arrival of his early voyages. On 3 May 1818 he had married Margaret Roberts (1796&#150;1871), daughter of Peter Roberts, banker, of Aberystwyth; they had eleven children. Mariner died on 20 October 1853, when he was found drowned in the Grand Surrey Canal at Camberwell. He was buried five days later in Gravesend cemetery.<br>
