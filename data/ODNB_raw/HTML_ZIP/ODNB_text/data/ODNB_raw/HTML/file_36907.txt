<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilks, Sir  Samuel</span>, baronet  (1824&#150;1911), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at Camberwell on 2 June 1824, the second son of Joseph Barber Wilks, treasurer at East India House, and his wife, Susannah Edwards, daughter of William Bennett of Southborough, Kent. He was educated first in Camberwell Green and in 1835 was placed with the Revd Dr Spyers, later headmaster of Aldenham grammar school, Herts. After three years at Aldenham and one year at University College School, Wilks was apprenticed to the family doctor, Richard Prior MRCS of Newington, Surrey. He learned to prepare medicines, to vaccinate, bleed, and draw teeth. He attended an anatomy course given by Bransby Cooper at Guy's Hospital and in 1842 entered Guy's as a medical student. In 1847 he became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. Prior died in December 1847 and Wilks oversaw the sale of the practice. He graduated MB at the University of London in 1848 and MD (with the gold medal) in 1850; in the following year he became a member of the Royal College of Physicians. In 1853, as physician to the Surrey Dispensary, he studied typhus, in Britain first distinguished from typhoid by Sir William Jenner in 1849; Wilks confirmed Jenner's observations.<br>
<br>On 25 July 1854 Wilks married Elizabeth Ann Prior, daughter of Henry Mockett of Seaford, Sussex, and widow of Richard Prior. There were no children and she predeceased him. Between 1854 and 1865 Wilks was one of the editors of <span class="italic">Guy's Hospital Reports</span>, to which he contributed some important papers. These reports, the first published by any London hospital, increased Guy's fame as a centre of teaching, research, and scientific medicine. In 1856, elected FRCP, Wilks became assistant physician, conducting post-mortem examinations and lecturing on pathology for ten years until 1865. He was also curator of the museum. In the 1850s the post-mortem merely identified the cause of death, but Wilks studied morbid anatomy as a science and showed that good clinical practice depended on a knowledge of morbid anatomy. He was one of the first to study visceral syphilis, observing that the internal organs were affected in the same way as the surface of the body. Wilks's lectures on morbid anatomy, delivered in 1858&#150;9, were published in 1859 and <span class="italic">Pathological Anatomy</span>, his most important work, became a standard text. A second edition, edited by Walter Moxon, was published in 1875 and a third, revised by Wilks himself, appeared in 1887.<br>
<br>In 1865 Wilks exchanged the lectureship in pathology for that in medicine; he became physician at Guy's in 1867 and held the post until 1885 when he retired from active practice and became consulting physician. As a clinician he paid special attention to nervous diseases and in 1878 he published <span class="italic">Diseases of the Nervous System</span>, another important work developed from lectures published in the <span class="italic">Medical Times and Gazette</span> in 1868. In 1897 Wilks was awarded the Moxon gold medal of the Royal College of Physicians in recognition of his observations and research in clinical medicine. Closely associated with Guy's all his life Wilks collaborated with G. T. Bettany in a <span class="italic">Biographical History of Guy's Hospital</span>, published in 1892. An accurate record of the history of the hospital and its personnel, this is a valuable contribution to the history of an important London hospital. Wilks always showed scrupulous fairness, giving credit without flattery to his colleagues. It was largely through him that the diseases associated with the names of Bright, Addison, and Hodgkin achieved their due place in English medicine.<br>
<br>Wilks received many honours and held high offices in the medical profession. Elected FRS in 1870 he was awarded an honorary LLD by Edinburgh University in 1884. He was examiner in medicine at the University of London and at the Royal College of Surgeons. President of the Pathological Society, 1881&#150;3, he was also a member of the senate of London University in 1885, and of the General Medical Council in 1887. At the Royal College of Physicians he was Harveian orator in 1879, vice-president in 1890, and president, 1896&#150;9. He was created baronet in 1897 and became physician-extraordinary to Queen Victoria. He had been physician to the duke and duchess of Connaught since 1879.<br>
<br>Wilks had a large private practice. Yet it was not a &#145;fashionable&#146; practice, probably because of his directness and habit of speaking his mind. His character was marked by individuality, independence, and a whimsical sense of humour. Well informed on scientific, literary, and political matters he had a lively interest in every aspect of life; he was in great demand by medical colleagues as a consultant. In 1901 he retired to Hampstead, where he became an active member of the Hampstead Scientific Society.<br>
<br>On 5 February 1904 Wilks was taken seriously ill with acute appendicitis and an emergency operation was performed. For some days his condition was critical. He recovered but in 1907 a second operation on an enlarged prostate gland became necessary and for the remainder of his life he was more or less an invalid. He became paralysed in the lower limbs and from May 1911 he was confined to bed. Yet he retained all his faculties and interest in intellectual developments, occupying himself with writing his <span class="italic">Biographical Reminiscences</span> in which he described the medical advances he had witnessed during his lifetime. He died peacefully at his home, 8 Prince Arthur Road, Hampstead, on 8 November 1911; he was cremated at Golders Green on 11 November and a funeral service was held at Hampstead parish church. His ashes were interred at Hampstead cemetery.<br>
