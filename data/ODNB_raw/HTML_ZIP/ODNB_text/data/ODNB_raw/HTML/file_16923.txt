<span class="headword">Lodge,  Thomas</span>  (1558&#150;1625), <span class="occ">author and physician</span>, was born in London, the second surviving son and third of seven surviving children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16922/', "Sir Thomas Lodge (1509/10&#150;1585)")</script>, lord mayor of London, and his third wife, Anne 
    (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Loddington; 1528&#150;1579)
  . The elder Thomas Lodge moved to London from Shropshire, was apprenticed to a grocer, and prospered. Anne was a stepdaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16214/', "William Laxton")</script>, a grocer and former mayor of London, and the widow of William Lane, also a grocer, who brought both money and land to the marriage. Like other men of his time and position, Sir Thomas invested in overseas trading ventures and real estate. In 1563, the final year of his mayoralty, Sir Thomas went bankrupt, a scandal Stow records. Both the land his wife brought to the marriage and the properties he purchased survived the bankruptcy, as attested by lawsuits that continued throughout the lives of his sons, many of which have been traced by Charles Sisson.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlyworks"></a>Education and early works</h2>Five years old at the time of his father's bankruptcy, Lodge spent some portion of his childhood in the household of Henry Stanley, earl of Derby, a circumstance Lodge acknowledges with gratitude in the dedication to <span class="italic">A Fig for Momus</span> (1595). The first definitive record of Lodge's education is his matriculation at the Merchant Taylors' School in 1571 as a &#145;poore scholar&#146;. Three years later he went up to Trinity College, Oxford, where he received the BA in 1577. In the dedication to <span class="italic">Rosalynde</span> (1590), Lodge states that Edward Hoby was his tutor and names Edmund and Robert Carey, sons of the earl of Hunsdon, among his Oxford friends. In 1578 Lodge entered Lincoln's Inn. There is no evidence that he ever practised law, his perennial involvement in lawsuits notwithstanding. The provisions of his mother's will, drawn in 1579, suggest that Lodge's disinclination to the profession was evident early on: if he does not continue a good student at Lincoln's Inn, the will states, his portion is to be divided among his brothers. Evidence does suggest that Lodge continued a social and probably a residential relation to Lincoln's Inn for some years; <span class="italic">An Alarum Against Usurers</span> (1584) and <span class="italic">Scillaes Metamorphosis</span> (1589) both include dedications to the gentlemen of the inns of court and as late as <span class="italic">A Fig for Momus</span> (1595) the title-page advertises Lodge as &#145;of Lincolns Inne, Gentleman&#146;.<br>
<br>Lodge first entered print in 1579. &#145;An Epitaph on Lady Anne Lodge&#146; was entered on the Stationers' register in December by Edward White, who had married Lodge's half-sister, Sara Lodge. A reply to Stephen Gosson's <span class="italic">School of Abuse</span> (1579) survives in two copies, both lacking title-pages. Variously titled by others&#151;<span class="italic">Honest Excuses</span>, <span class="italic">A Defense of Poetry</span>, <span class="italic">Reply to Gosson</span>&#151;the importance of Lodge's pamphlet arises less from its intrinsic merits than from its position as the first defence of poetry in the long series of exchanges focused on drama and the theatre. Gosson replied to Lodge's pamphlet in <span class="italic">Plays Confuted</span> (1582) and Lodge to Gosson in the prefatory matter of <span class="italic">An Alarum Against Usurers</span> (1584). From these exchanges it appears that licence to publish Lodge's initial pamphlet was denied, and it was privately printed and circulated. One may read in the <span class="italic">Reply to Gosson</span> a sense of vocation when Lodge writes &#145;I affirme that poetry is a heavenly gift, then which I know not greater pleasure&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.19).<h2>
<a name="EarlyCatholicism"></a>Early Catholicism</h2>In 1581 Lodge's supplication for the MA at Oxford was initially accepted and then, later that year, denied. In the interim a Thomas Lodge, gentleman, was called before the privy council to answer &#145;certain matters&#146; and a Thomas Lodge was imprisoned at the king's bench, according to the confession of an anti-Catholic informant. The coincidence between these records and the appearance of a Lodge (and a Loddington, potentially a cousin on Lady Lodge's side) on a list of recusants living in Paris in 1580, together with clear evidence of Lodge's Catholicism later in life, has led biographers to speculate that matters of faith underwrote the refusal of the MA, the privy council matter, and the imprisonment. It is also possible, as Charles Sisson argues, that the privy council interest in Lodge, if indeed he is the same Lodge, concerns his entry into the controversy about the stage. The stronger circumstantial argument, however, rests on the premise of Lodge's Catholicism, especially given that both Trinity College and Lincoln's Inn were sites resistant to the Reformation and hospitable to recusants. This circumstantial argument acquires greater force for biographers because it also helps to explain the omission of Thomas Lodge from his father's will in 1583.<br>
<br>Elaine Cuvelier's doctoral study of Lodge makes the strongest possible case for Lodge's early Catholicism and its determining impact on his life and writing. Arthur Kinney's discussion of Lodge's literary <i>&#339;uvre</i> makes the contrasting case for a more general &#145;Christian humanism&#146;. Lodge's Catholicism later in life is undisputed; after 1611 it also ceased to matter in significant practical ways, for &#145;Thomas Lodge, Dr. of Physike&#146; was protected from prosecution for recusancy by order of the privy council. Assessment of the import of Lodge's Catholicism awaits both more extensive critical discussion of the work and a revisionist social history of the varieties of English Catholicism in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The poets and writers among Lodge's contemporaries, whether of protestant or Catholic sympathy themselves, do not remark on Lodge's religion.<br>
<br>Sir Thomas Lodge died in 1585, the year after Thomas Lodge's <span class="italic">An Alarum Against Usurers</span> appeared. The exclusion of Lodge from his father's will may have been the obvious strategy of a man of Sir Thomas's diminished financial standing who had other children to consider, for Thomas had received land as well as money by his mother's will, albeit under the control of executors, or it may have been a silent expression of disapproval for his son's life, or both. In any case, Thomas Lodge never came into the lands his mother left him, having granted them to his brother William in 1583 for ready money and in acknowledgement of debts already paid on his behalf by William. Lawsuits involving Thomas Lodge reveal that he was repeatedly in need of ready money and of sufficient credit to get it, and that allegations of unpaid debt to various tradesmen pursued him for thirty years.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">An Alarum Against Usurers</span> offers an account of the practices by which a gentleman in need of ready money may be ruined and, in the event, forced into partnership with the usurer who ruined him. Although the correlation between Lodge's narrative and his life is obvious and tempting, the tone is reportorial rather than autobiographical even at those moments when the text approaches confession: &#145;truly gentlemen this that I write is true, I myselfe know the paymaster, naie more, I myselfe know certainly, that by name I can reckon among you some that have been bitten&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.18). The volume in which <span class="italic">An Alarum Against Usurers</span> appeared also included a pastoral romance, &#145;The Delectable Historie of Forbonius and Prisceria&#146;, and a verse satire, &#145;Truth's Complaint over England&#146;. The volume as a whole is dedicated to Philip Sidney and &#145;Forbonius and Prisceria&#146; is obviously indebted to both Sidney's <span class="italic">Old Arcadia</span> and Lyly's <span class="italic">Euphues</span> in theme, style, and integration of verse into the narrative. Although most critics have treated the volume as a miscellany, Arthur Kinney argues that it forms a deliberate triadic structure, the circumstantial fiction of <span class="italic">Alarum</span> contrasted by the marvellous in &#145;Forbonius&#146; and the contrast itself enclosed by the experientially focused satire of &#145;Truth's Complaint&#146;, written in the tradition of Chaucer, Skelton, Wyatt, and Gascoigne.<br>
<br>Between 1584 and 1589 Lodge wrote two plays, one in collaboration with Robert Greene, and made a sea voyage. In the dedication to <span class="italic">Rosalynde</span> Lodge refers to a voyage made &#145;with Captain Clarke &hellip; to the islands of Terceres and the Canaries&#146;. Scholars have offered various possible voyages: a sailing in 1586 of the <span class="italic">Gold Noble</span>; a voyage in 1585 on the <span class="italic">Roebuck</span>; and a voyage in 1590 on the <span class="italic">Galleon Dudley</span>. Of these, the voyages made in 1585 or 1586 are most likely, but neither consensus nor any other evidence of Lodge's presence on any of the voyages has emerged. Lodge's play, <span class="italic">The Wounds of Civil War</span>, was, according to its title-page, performed by the Lord Admiral's Men. Both <span class="italic">Wounds</span> and the play Lodge wrote with Greene, <span class="italic">A Looking Glass for London and England</span>, were printed in 1594. <span class="italic">A Looking Glass</span> was first performed by either the Queen's Men or Lord Strange's Men; according to Henslowe's diary, it was revived by Lord Strange's Men and performed at the Rose in 1591 and 1592. Ferdinando Stanley, Lord Strange, was the son of Henry Stanley, the earl of Derby with whom Lodge spent some of his childhood. Charles Howard, the lord admiral, was uncle to Edmund and Robert Carey, Lodge's Oxford friends.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Wounds</span> tells the story of the Roman civil wars between Marius and Sulla. Drawn from the accounts of Appian and Plutarch, it is the earliest surviving example of a Roman history play from the Elizabethan repertory. Scholars have debated the question of Lodge's indebtedness to Marlowe or Marlowe's indebtedness to Lodge. Given the stiffness of the verse in <span class="italic">Wounds</span>, and the clumsiness of the plot, the current critical consensus is that Lodge's play predates <span class="italic">Tamberlaine</span> and <span class="italic">Edward II</span>, owing debts to <span class="italic">Gorboduc</span> by Thomas Norton and Thomas Sackville and to Gascoigne's plays, rather than to Marlowe's. <span class="italic">Looking Glass</span> seems to have been a greater success. Not only was it revived on stage, but the quarto was reprinted five times between 1594 and 1617. The plot is drawn from the biblical story of Ninevah and Jonah, but London is the clear allegorical referent and the scenes of the sub-plot feature satirical representations of contemporary urban life. In <span class="italic">Palladis tamia</span> (1598) Francis Meres named Lodge among &#145;the best for comedy&#146; but no other plays survive.<h2>
<a name="Poetryandnarrativefictions"></a>Poetry and narrative fictions</h2>Lodge's position in the canon of English literature rests on the works published after 1589, particularly on his poetry and his narrative fictions. A volume called <span class="italic">Scillaes Metamorphosis</span> (1589) contains a long verse narrative, <span class="italic">Historie of Glaucus and Scilla</span>, a 100-line poem, &#145;The Discontented Satyre&#146;, and fifteen &#145;sonnets&#146; or short poems. <span class="italic">Glaucus and Scilla</span> is an early and noteworthy example of the Ovidian minor epic poetry that was to become fashionable in the 1590s. Written in the six-line stanzas Shakespeare later used in <span class="italic">Venus and Adonis</span>, the story of Glaucus's unrequited love for Scilla and Scilla's belated response is told by a melancholy narrator whose presence in the poem lends it an ironic and arguably comic effect. The remaining poems in the volume are a mix of Horatian satires and &#145;sundrie sweet sonnets&#146; that draw on French and Italian contemporaries and show Lodge experimenting with the possibilities of form, metre, and style. The volume seems to have sold slowly and was reissued with a new title, <span class="italic">A Pleasant Historie of Glaucus and Scilla</span>, in 1610.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Rosalynde: Euphues Golden Legacie</span>, the best-known of Lodge's narrative fictions, was first published in 1590 and, by the time Shakespeare used it for <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, had gone through four editions. Circumstantial evidence from the dedication to Lord Hunsdon suggests that it may have been written several years before and scholars have speculated that Robert Greene may have seen it through the press while Lodge was at sea. In any case, the pastoral romance with lyrics integrated into the narrative brings the formal work begun by &#145;Forbonius and Prisceria&#146; to its full development. Arthur Kinney argues that the contrast achieved by the juxtaposition of the tract against usury and the romance of &#145;Forbonius&#146; in the <span class="italic">Alarum</span> volume is fully integrated in the narrative of <span class="italic">Rosalynde</span> through its contrast between the cynical courtly world of Bordeaux and the pastoral forest of Arden. Lodge drew <span class="italic">Rosalynde</span>'s initial situation of the conflict between brothers upon their father's death and the wrestling match that eventually results in the exile of the second son from the fourteenth-century <span class="italic">Tale of Gamelyn</span>, but he developed the story away from bloody heroic revenge toward pastoral romance and euphuistic debate. The story is well-known from Shakespeare's use of it in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>. Alan Brissenden provides an extensive discussion of that use in the Oxford edition of the play. Donald Beecher's introduction to the annotated text published by the Barnabe Riche Society discusses <span class="italic">Rosalynde</span>'s relation to contemporary texts in terms of genre, style, poetics, theme, and character. Of all Lodge's works, <span class="italic">Rosalynde</span> has attracted the most extensive critical attention, most of it focused through the lens of Shakespeare's play or through synthetic surveys of Elizabethan prose fiction. This critical attention shows how woven Lodge's work is into the literary culture of its time and how much work remains to be done tracing its affiliations (see, for example, <span class="italic">Modern Philology</span>, 95, 1998, 291&#150;315).<br>
<br>Between 1590 and 1596 Lodge published four more prose fictions: <span class="italic">The Famous, True and Historical Life of Robert, Second Duke of Normandy</span> (1591), <span class="italic">Euphues Shadow</span> (1592), <span class="italic">The Life and Death of William Longbeard</span> (1593), and <span class="italic">A Margarite of America</span> (1596). <span class="italic">Euphues Shadow</span> clearly imitates Lyly's two <span class="italic">Euphues</span> volumes, some twelve years after their completed publication. <span class="italic">Robert, Duke of Normandy</span> (also known as <span class="italic">Robin the Devil</span>), <span class="italic">William Longbeard</span>, and <span class="italic">Margarite of America</span> all develop a sensational and often violent vision out of romance conventions, tempered, if at all, by an improbable spirituality or the presence of a hermit figure somewhat removed from violence. In <span class="italic">Robert, Duke of Normandy</span>, the title character spends his youth hurting, raping, and killing those he meets only to undergo a penitential conversion after receiving a mortal wound and being healed by a hermit. In <span class="italic">William Longbeard</span> William's vicious career ends with his hanging, and in <span class="italic">Margarite</span> the protagonist kills ten people, including himself. With the exception of <span class="italic">Margarite</span>, these fictions, if not dismissed altogether, have received little critical attention. One school of criticism suggests that in these late fictions Lodge is turning toward realism, either a psychological realism or a historiographical verisimilitude, an approach that positions the fictions in relation to the later development of the novel. A second line of argument sees an increasing preoccupation with problems of spirituality inflected by Lodge's Catholicism.<br>
<br>In 1591 Lodge sailed from England in one of five ships under the command of Sir Thomas Cavendish who had successfully circumnavigated the globe three years earlier. Although all five ships reached Brazil and stayed there for two months, Cavendish's second voyage was a disaster. Many men, including Cavendish, and at least two of the ships, were lost and those men and ships that returned gained no wealth from the voyage. In the prefatory material to <span class="italic">A Margarite of America</span> Lodge claims to have drawn the story from a Spanish manuscript found in a Jesuit library in Brazil and to have written it while &#145;at sea with M. Cavendish (whose memorie if I repent not, I lament not)&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.3). However plausible either claim, the prefatory material is signed &#145;from my house the 4 Maie 1596&#146;, three years after Lodge's return. Arguably Lodge's most interesting fiction, <span class="italic">A Margarite of America</span>, is set in the New World and tells the story of a diplomatic marriage intended to avert war between Mosco and Cusco. Margarite is a chaste, innocent princess blindly trusting her father's arrangements and her intended husband, the Cuscan prince, Arsachadus, an unregenerately Machiavellian figure well versed in impeccable courtly appearances. The Petrarchan and pastoral conventions of Lodge's earlier romances are integrated into a story of unrelenting depravity and violence that anticipates the world of Jacobean tragedies. Claudette Pollack has drawn attention to the text's indebtedness to Castiglione's <span class="italic">Book of the Courtier</span> and Machiavelli's <span class="italic">The Prince</span> and <span class="italic">Discourses</span>  (&#145;Lodge's <i>A Margarite of America</i>: An Elizabethan medley&#146;, <span class="italic">Renaissance and Reformation</span>, 12, 1976, 1&#150;11); Josephine Roberts argues that <span class="italic">A Margarite</span> presents a dystopian vision of the New World,  (&#145;Lodge's <i>A Margarite of America</i>: a dystopian vision of the New World&#146;, <span class="italic">Studies in Short Fiction</span>, 17, 1980, 407&#150;15); and Joan Pong Linton locates the text in relation to the &#145;romance of empire&#146; explored by Spenser and Ralegh, arguing that Margarite is figured in ironic relation to Spenser's Una and Elizabeth I's investments in the politics and rhetoric of empire  (<span class="italic">The Romance of the New World</span>, 1998, 39&#150;61).<br>
<br>Between 1590 and 1596 Lodge also published four other prose works and two volumes of poetry. <span class="italic">Catharos</span> (1591), <span class="italic">The Devil Conjured</span> (1596), and <span class="italic">Wits Miserie, or, The Worlds Madness</span> (1596) are all moral-philosophical writings: <span class="italic">Catharos</span> a dialogue featuring Diogenes and two interlocutors, <span class="italic">The Devil Conjured</span> a dialogue in which a Christian hermit counsels three young men, and <span class="italic">Wits Miserie</span> a satirical treatment of the seven deadly sins. The fourth prose piece, <span class="italic">Prosopopeia &hellip; the Teares &hellip; of Marie</span> (1596) explicitly declares its Catholic sympathies, using the figure of Mary to meditate on the sins of the world. <span class="italic">Phillis</span> (1593) is a volume of short lyrics, mostly sonnets, some of which also appeared in the Elizabethan verse miscellanies <span class="italic">Phoenix Nest</span> (1593), <span class="italic">Englands Helicon</span> (1600), <span class="italic">Belvedere</span> (1600), and <span class="italic">Englands Parnassus</span> (1600). The verse miscellanies also contained poems from Lodge's prose romances and poems Lodge had not printed elsewhere. <span class="italic">A Fig for Momus</span> (1596), Lodge's last volume of poetry, is a collection of epistles, satires, and eclogues modelled on the Roman satirists, especially Horace and Juvenal. Lodge's inclusion in the verse miscellanies attests to contemporary recognition of his accomplishments as a poet. Like the early Ovidian poem, <span class="italic">Glaucus and Scilla</span>, the late satiric collection, <span class="italic">A Fig for Momus</span>, has greater literary historical significance because it is an innovative exemplar. The poems of <span class="italic">A Fig for Momus</span> develop the heroic couplet and anticipate the satires of the late 1590s. Although Lodge's satires were imitated by John Marston and Edward Guilpin, the compression of his line and the detached quality of his persona bring his poems closer to those of his Augustan successors than those of his contemporaries.<h2>
<a name="Medicalpracticeandtranslation"></a>Medical practice and translation</h2>In 1597 Lodge left England for France where he received a medical degree from the University of Avignon in 1598. In 1602 his medical degree was recognized by Oxford, though his application for a licence from the College of Physicians was denied. Between 1598 and 1610 Lodge practised medicine, at times in London and at times in the Low Countries and France. At some point within a few years of receiving his medical degree Lodge married Joan Aldred, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ferneley (<i>b</i>. 1546, <i>d</i>. in or after 1625), widow of Simon Aldred. Simon Aldred had been an agent for both the pope and Francis Walsingham, but Joan Aldred evidently remained a constant Catholic, serving in the household of the countess of Arundel after separating from her husband. Lodge's shifting between the continent and England during this period, together with his marriage to a known Catholic, leads biographers to assume that his intermittent exile and the denial of a licence to practise from the College of Physicians resulted from his Catholicism and possible participation in Counter-Reformation activities. The intervention of Sir Thomas Edmondes, ambassador to France, made it possible for Lodge to resume permanent English residence. In 1610 Lodge was admitted to the College of Physicians and the next year he swore an oath of allegiance and the privy council issued the order effectively protecting him from prosecution for recusancy. Although his name appears on a list of recusants in 1618, there is no evidence that Lodge's Catholicism caused him trouble after 1611. Indeed, the biographical assumption is that he established a viable medical practice in London in part because he attracted Catholic patients.<br>
<br>Lodge continued to write and publish alongside his medical practice. His later literary reputation rests on two monumental translations, a folio volume of the works of the Jewish historian Josephus, and a folio volume of the prose works of Seneca. First published in 1602, <span class="italic">The Famous and Memorable Workes of Josephus</span> was reprinted at least nine times in the seventeenth century. Late sixteenth-century interest in Josephus's history of the Jews and its later redactions is well attested; a copy entry for a translation of Josephus was first made in the Stationers' register in 1591 and both Thomas Nashe's <span class="italic">Christs Teares Over Jerusalem</span> (1593) and Thomas Deloney's <span class="italic">Canaans Calamitie</span> (1598) use the fall of Jerusalem as a cautionary allegory for contemporary London. Lodge seeks, he says in his introduction to the reader, to make history available for study:<blockquote>it is the most exact and chiefest interest of historie to awaken mans idleness, and arme them against casualities, and the whole bent of example hath no other issue &hellip; For as life, so Historie (the image of life) is fraught with pleasure, and displeasure; and onely in the use of life, the wisdome of life consisteth. (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 4.25, 27)</blockquote>Whether Lodge was the intended translator in 1591 or entered upon the task after the transfer of copy in 1598 is not known. The translation of Seneca also responded to an already established interest and occupied many years. An initial entry for the copy is dated 1600 and in a letter to Sir Thomas Edmondes in 1610 Lodge writes as though the translation were almost completed. The first edition of <span class="italic">The Workes both Morall and Naturall of Lucius Annaeus Seneca</span> appeared in 1614. Lodge prepared a revised edition, published in 1620, that was to become a standard translation until the twentieth century, and the basis of selection and redaction by others, beginning with Roger L'Estrange's <span class="italic">Seneca's &#145;Morals&#146;</span> (1679).<br>
<br>While practising medicine and translating Josephus and Seneca, Lodge also published other smaller works. In 1601 he translated selections of Catholic devotional writings by Luis of Granada, <span class="italic">The Flowers of Lodowick of Granada</span>. Two years later a quarto volume, <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Plague</span>, reflects Lodge's vocational reading, his immediate practice as a physician, and his interest in making knowledge available to readers. Another text of popularized medical knowledge, &#145;The poore mans talentt&#146;, circulated in manuscript, the original dedicated to and evidently prepared for the countess of Arundel as an aid to her &#145;charitie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 4.3). Lodge's final published work, a translation of Simon Goulart's commentary on the poetry of Du Bartas, the French Huguenot poet, is contemporaneous with his revision of the Seneca translation. English poets had been interested in Du Bartas's poetry since the 1580s; Philip Sidney worked on a translation before his death in 1586 and Joshua Sylvester's translation of the complete works appeared in 1605. <span class="italic">A Learned Summary upon the Famous Poeme of &hellip; Du Bartas</span> was first published in 1621 and went through four editions before 1640.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsandreputation"></a>Final years and reputation</h2>The last years of Lodge's life might have been lived in financial comfort. In 1612 the last of his brothers died and Lodge inherited an estate of enough value that a portion was leased for &pound;200 a year. But as both Charles Sisson and Alice Walker have shown, Lodge continued to be embroiled in lawsuits over financial matters involving both debts and obligations that he owed and claims that he made upon the land of others. In any case, Lodge continued to practise medicine. In 1625 the London aldermen named Lodge as a physician who might be employed in relation to the plague. Early in the autumn of 1625 Lodge died, presumably of the plague. He died intestate; the administration of his estate was granted to his wife on 12 October 1625.<br>
<br>Although Lodge was occasionally recognized by his contemporaries, his name occurs less frequently than might be expected from the range of his work and the length of his life. Some of the mentions, moreover, are not easily understandable in relation to what is taken to be Lodge's <i>&#339;uvre</i>. Francis Meres's naming Lodge as among &#145;the best for comedy&#146; is one such example; Edmund Howe's listing him among the &#145;Latin poets&#146; in his continuation of Stow's <span class="italic">Annales</span> is another. <span class="italic">The Returne from Parnassus</span> notes that Lodge has &#145;his oare in every paper boat&#146; and &#145;turns over Galen every day&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Three Parnassus Plays</span>, ed. J. B. Leishman, 1949, 239). Lodge's dedications and direct or indirect autobiographical statements suggest personal friendships, some of long standing, but no permanent intellectual circle. The aristocratic Howard, Carey, and Strange families, the poets Spenser, Daniel, and Drayton, the professional writers Robert Greene and Barnabe Riche, the stationers Edward White and John Busbie, the professional secretaries and scribes Ralph Crane and Peter Bale may well have known each other, but they do not form any coherent social grouping.<br>
<br>Lodge's later reputation, the long life of <span class="italic">Rosalynde</span> and his translations of Josephus and Seneca notwithstanding, is eclipsed by that of his contemporaries, especially Shakespeare whose use of <span class="italic">Rosalynde</span> kept Lodge's name current even as critical comparisons inevitably slighted Lodge. In the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> Sidney Lee wrote that Lodge should be remembered primarily as a lyric poet. Edmund Gosse's edition, <span class="italic">The Complete Works of Thomas Lodge</span> (not including any of the translations), had been printed only ten years before Lee wrote. While Lodge's poetry still features in anthologies of Elizabethan verse, critical attention has turned toward the fictions in the century since Lee's comment and Gosse's edition. The convergence of literary and historical investigations at the end of the twentieth century suggests that Lodge merits continued and renewed attention for some of the very reasons that may have inhibited earlier recognition: the length of his active life as a writer, the range of his writing activity, his Catholic affinity or affiliation, as well as for the undisputed literary accomplishment of his best work.<br>
