<span class="headword">Thomas,  Hugh Owen</span>  (1834&#150;1891), <span class="occ">orthopaedic surgeon</span>, was born on 23 August 1834 in Bodedern, Anglesey, the eldest child in the family of five sons and two daughters of Evan Thomas (1804&#150;1884), a bone-setter, of Liverpool, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Owen. His father was seventh in a line of bone-setters descended from a farming family in Anglesey, but by the middle of the nineteenth century medical opinion was becoming increasingly hostile to these unqualified practitioners, and Evan Thomas sent all of his five sons to study medicine at Edinburgh University. Hugh Thomas lived with his grandparents in Rhoscolyn, Anglesey, until he was thirteen, attending the local school, and then went to Dr Poggi's school in New Brighton, Cheshire. In 1851 he began four years' apprenticeship with his uncle, Dr Owen Roberts, of St Asaph, doctor at the Liverpool workhouse infirmary, who prepared him for Edinburgh University, where he studied medicine from 1854 until 1857. He then spent time at University College, London, becoming MRCS in 1857. He spent a short time in Paris, studying French surgical methods, and then returned to Liverpool and joined his father's practice in 1858.<br>
<br>After a year Thomas set up his own practice at 24 Hardy Street, in the heart of the Liverpool docklands. In 1864 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Jones, an architect and builder, of Rhyl, Wales. They had no children, and in 1873 they invited Elizabeth's nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34237/', "Robert Jones")</script>, to live with them so that he could study at the Liverpool school of medicine. In 1866 Thomas moved to 11 Nelson Street, Liverpool, where he remained until his death; he later turned 24 Hardy Street into a private nursing home. Although he became critical of the methods of the old bone-setters, and especially of their views on diseases of the joints, he had learned from watching his father's manipulative practices; and in his workshop he followed their practice of making their own splints, constantly experimenting with new designs. He offered to supply his splints to the French army during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, but this was rejected. His patients were mainly Merseyside dockers and shipyard workers, and seamen injured at sea, and he had to deal with many severe accident cases. His free Sunday clinics at 11 Nelson Street from 1870 onwards became famous, and patients arrived in handcarts, wheelbarrows, and donkey carts. He went on his daily rounds in a scarlet phaeton designed by himself, pulled by two black horses, with his wife beside him.<br>
<br>Because Thomas held neither hospital nor university appointments, his work was slow to gain recognition, but in 1875 he published <span class="italic">Diseases of the Hip, Knee, and Ankle Joints, with their Deformities</span>, which reached a third edition in 1878. He was elected a member of the Liverpool Medical Institution in 1876, and his splints were praised at the International Medical Congress in 1881. He lectured to the Harveian Society of London in 1887. He published a series of eight <span class="roman">Contributions to Surgery and Medicine</span> (1883&#150;90), many of which were polemical, and he made enemies among English surgeons whom he attacked in print, including Sir Frederick Treves. However, he had a wide following in the United States, and several American orthopaedic surgeons visited him, one of whom, John Ridlon, a founder of the American Orthopaedic Association, who first visited him in 1887, became his leading American supporter. In 1890 he received the honorary degree of MD from the University of St Louis.<br>
<br>Thomas was very small, with a brusque, hectoring manner, and his only relaxation was playing his flute, which he had modified in his workshop. He was an agnostic, and a friend of Charles Bradlaugh. Thomas died of pneumonia on 6 January 1891 at his residence at 11 Nelson Street, Liverpool, and was survived by his wife; thousands of Liverpool poor followed the hearse and crowded the church at his funeral.<br>
<br>After his death Thomas's work was largely forgotten, until the First World War, when Robert Jones became director of orthopaedic surgery for the British army. Thanks to his efforts the Army Medical Service introduced the Thomas splint for compound fractures of the lower limbs, and it was in general use from the end of 1915 for the transport of stretcher cases from the front to casualty stations, and in base hospitals, greatly reducing the mortality rate. Thomas made an important contribution to the treatment of fractures. He strongly opposed surgical intervention, especially amputation, and believed in the principle of enforced rest and immobilization of the fractured limb. He felt that the less the surgeon interfered with nature the better.<br>
