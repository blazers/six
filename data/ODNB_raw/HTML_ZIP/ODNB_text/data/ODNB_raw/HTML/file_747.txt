<span class="headword">Ashe,  John</span>  (1672&#150;1735), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and religious writer</span>, was born at Malcoff, Derbyshire, on 11 February 1672, the son of Edward Ashe, grocer and mercer of Tideswell, and his wife, Susannah, who was the widow of William Barber of Chapel-en-le-Frith, daughter of William Bagshaw of Litton, and sister of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1046/', "Revd William Bagshaw (1628&#150;1702), the Apostle of the Peak")</script>.<br>
<br>Ashe was educated at Mr Foxlow's school in Chesterfield and at Samuel Ogden's school at Wirksworth before being admitted on 7 May 1688 to Richard Frankland's academy, then located at Attercliffe, near Sheffield. He completed his ministerial training at the home in Ford, Derbyshire, of his uncle, William Bagshaw. His first ministerial appointment was in 1692 as chaplain to Lady Sarah Houghton of Houghton Towers, Lancashire. In the following year he returned to the Peak District to become minister to the nonconformist congregation at Ashford and was ordained at Malcoff on 21 June 1696. He also ministered to congregations at Hucklow, Bradwell, Chelmorton, and Stony Middleton, and in addition to these duties gave occasional lectures or sermons at Tideswell and Litton. In return for these exertions he received a stipend of only &pound;20 per annum, paid in part from a grant from the Presbyterian Fund and from a share in the charitable bequest of Philip, Lord Wharton.<br>
<br>Ashe married Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1709), daughter of the Revd Thomas Swetnam of Turnditch, Derbyshire, at Carsington on 6 May 1703. They had two daughters, Elizabeth and Sarah, and a son, but in February 1709 Ashe suffered the double loss of both his wife and son. He married again in December 1716. His second wife was Martha Halstead of Worley, near Halifax, who &#145;was to him a very valuable companion and friend through the remainder of his life&#146;  (&#145;Memoirs&#146;, 5.407).<br>
<br>Ashe was a popular and devoted minister. As his congregations were composed of mainly uneducated country people he endeavoured to ensure that his preaching was plain and simple and did not contain terms which would not be understood. He visited the sick and old and gave generously to the poor even though he was not a rich man. He was much respected not only by fellow nonconformists but by the clergy and laity of the Church of England. It was written of him: &#145;Few ministers had a more ardent concern for the salvation of the people committed to their care&#146;  (&#145;Memoirs&#146;, 5.409). According to his colleague and great friend James Clegg, Ashe was an &#145;unwearied reader&#146;, reading even when travelling on foot or on horseback around the Peak District, with the result that &#145;he frequently lost his way and was hard put to find it again&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 3.946). He appears to have been orthodox in his theological views. In politics he was a whig and staunch supporter of the Hanoverian succession, sentiments which caused the destruction of his meeting-house at Bradwell by Jacobite sympathizers in 1715. He was the author of a number of religious and biographical works, the most important of which was his <span class="italic">Short Account of the Life and Character of the Rev. William Bagshaw</span> (1704). He also published several single sermons and a preface to Bagshaw's <span class="italic">Essay on Union with Christ</span> (1702).<br>
<br>Ashe was blessed with a robust constitution, but by the beginning of 1731 his health began to deteriorate. He complained increasingly of a &#145;dizziness in the head&#146;  (&#145;Memoirs&#146;, 5.408), which prevented him from travelling and obliged him to resign his care of Bradwell and Hucklow and confine his duties chiefly to Ashford. His illness grew worse and he died, apparently as a result of a stroke, at Ashford on 2 October 1735. He was buried in the churchyard at Ashford, and his funeral sermon was preached by Revd James Clegg, minister at Chapel-en-le-Frith.<br>
