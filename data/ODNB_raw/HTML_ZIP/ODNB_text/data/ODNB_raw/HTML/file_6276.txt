<span class="headword">Copping <span class="st"> [Coppin]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1583), <span class="occ">shoemaker and religious radical</span>, is of unknown origins. By 1576 he was living in Bury St Edmunds where, with his companions Elias Thacker, a tailor, and one Tyler, he proved a thorn in the side of the ecclesiastical authorities in the diocese of Norwich. Well before the radical separatist Robert Browne came to Bury, and as early as 1576, Thacker had been imprisoned by the bishop's commissary, John Dey, for &#145;his disobedyence to the ecclesiasticall lawes of this royalme&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 27, fols. 52<i>r</i>&#150;53<i>v</i>). He refused to allow his child born in August 1578 to be baptized by any minister &#145;except he be a preacher and then also without godfathers and godmothers&#146;  (ibid.) and was reported to the privy council for asserting that the queen was perjured. Copping appears to have been in and out of Bury gaol from 1576 until his execution in 1583. Sir Robert Jermyn and Sir John Heigham confessed that they had sought to have Copping and his associates released from prison so long as there was some hope of persuading them out of their radical opinions, but once they realized that this policy had failed they &#145;gave them up to their froward wylls&#146; and became &#145;ernest suters&#146; to Edmund Freake, bishop of Norwich, and the assize judges to have them removed from the gaol in Bury &#145;for feare of infectyng others&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 37, fol. 59<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Given the increasingly antagonistic relationship between Bishop Freake and the godly Suffolk gentry, the presence and radical critique by such laymen of the established church proved an acute embarrassment for the close alliance of godly magistracy and ministry within Bury St Edmunds, already sensitive to the charge levelled at them by their conformist opponents that they had truncated the required services to little more than Genevan psalms and sermons. The presence and preaching of Robert Browne in Bury by the summer of 1581 undoubtedly made this critique more pointed and powerful. Between 1581 and 1583 there appears to have been considerable support for the Brownist cause in Bury St Edmunds. In 1581 Freake reported that some inhabitants gathered &#145;to the number of an hundred at a tyme in privat howses and conventicles&#146; to hear Browne preach, &#145;not without danger of some ill event&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 33, fol. 26<i>r</i>). Freake's fears were realized in the following year when, thanks to some careful detective work by Richard Bancroft, the future archbishop, it was discovered that some of the more radical inhabitants had organized the effort to paint the first part of the scriptural warning of the angel to the church at Thyatira (<span class="roman">Revelation</span> 2: 19) around the queen's arms in the parish church of St Mary, with its covert implication that, for all Elizabeth's works and love and service and faith, she was a Jezebel who caused her servants to commit fornication and eat meat sacrificed to idols.<br>
<br>This scandalous caption seems to have proved the last straw for the authorities and matters came to a head at the summer assizes held in Bury in 1583. On 30 June Elizabeth issued a proclamation declaring &#145;sundry seditious, schismatical and erroneous printed books &hellip; set forth by Robert Browne and Richard [Robert] Harrison&#146; to be called in and &#145;burned or utterly defaced&#146; and that those that were &#145;so hardy as to put in print or writing, sell, set forth, receive, give out, or distribute any more of the same or such like seditious books it libels&#146; would &#145;answer for the contrary at their uttermost perils&#146;  (Hughes and Larkin, 2.501&#150;2). The exemplary punishments meted out at the assizes held in Bury over the next few days followed swiftly. Both Copping and Thacker were indicted and convicted for &#145;dispersinge of Browne's bookes and Harrisons bookes&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 38, fols. 162<i>r</i>&#150;163<i>v</i>), and while the assizes were still in session both men were executed, Thacker on Thursday 4 July and Copping on Friday 5 July. Small bonfires to the number of forty books were made at both executions. The severity of the penalties was entirely in keeping with the fierce temper of Sir Edward Anderson, chief justice of the common pleas, who saved a copy of one of Robert Harrison's <span class="italic">Three Formes of Catechismes</span> (1583) from the flames and presented the same to Bancroft, who attended the assizes and had been instrumental in revealing the extent of radical sentiment in the town. The other assize judge, Lord Chief Justice Sir Christopher Wray, wrote a full account to Lord Burghley of the proceedings in Bury in which he apologized for troubling &#145;your Lordship with a tedious matter&#146; and expressed the hope that the &#145;example of this assizes&#146; would bring an end to the separatist movement in and around Bury  (BL, Lansdowne MS 38, fols. 162<i>r</i>&#150;163<i>v</i>). However, probate evidence, and in particular a number of bequests to the widows Copping, Thacker, and Tyler made by some Bury testators as late as 1589, seems to indicate that the movement managed to survive in some form.<br>
