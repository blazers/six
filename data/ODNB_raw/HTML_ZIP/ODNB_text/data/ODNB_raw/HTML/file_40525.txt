<span class="headword">Stephens,  Joanna</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1774), <span class="occ">medical practitioner</span>, was reputedly born in Berkshire. She flourished in London society after the publication in 1738 of <span class="italic">Ten Cases of Persons who have Taken Mrs. Stephens's Medicines for the Stone</span>, by the physician and philosopher David Hartley, who also published <span class="italic">A View of the Present Evidence for and against Mrs Stephens's Medicines</span> (1739) and <span class="italic">De lithontriptico a Joanna Stephens</span> (1741). Contemporary accounts suggest that bladder stones were one of the most distressing ailments of the eighteenth century. Descriptions abound of the various methods proffered for curing the stone, either by extirpation or dissolution. Despite the self-promotion of several well-known lithotomists (&#145;cutters&#146; for the stone), the public appears not to have shared their enthusiasm for the knife. Nearly all domestic manuals, as well as most comprehensive medical handbooks, recommended some type of lithontriptic remedy to ease the pain of the stone.<br>
<br>In his 1738 publication Hartley announced that Mrs Stephens had proposed to make her medicine known to the public for the benefit of all who suffered from &#145;this wrath&#146;  (Wilson, 58). In exchange for this benevolence to her compatriots, Stephens demanded &pound;5000 for disclosing her remedy. She advertised her intentions in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> between April and December 1738. By December, 189 people had contributed a total of &pound;1356. Short of the remaining amount Stephens petitioned parliament in March 1739 for the full &pound;5000. A parliamentary vote of 105 to 62 prompted the formation of a committee to consider her petition. The committee approved her request on 10 April 1739, agreeing to pay the whole sum if her remedy proved to be as efficacious as she claimed. In June 1739 Stephens delivered the secret recipe to the archbishop of Canterbury, who, in turn, presented it to the other twenty-eight trustees appointed by parliament for this investigation. The recipe was also sent to the editors of the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, where it was published in its entirety on 16 June 1739.<br>
<br>The medicine consisted of a powder, a decoction, and pills. The powder consisted of calcined egg shells and snails; the decoction was prepared by boiling herbs with soap, &#145;Swines-Cresses burnt to a Blackness&#146;, honey, and water; and the pills consisted of calcined snails. The remedy was prepared by medical and surgical members of the trustees and administered to four sufferers of the stone for a year. On 5 March 1740 the four patients were called to the House of Lords and their medical case histories presented to the trustees. The patients claimed that their symptoms had been completely alleviated and no bladder stones were detected. Upon considering the evidence all but two of the parliamentary trustees signed a certificate verifying the efficacy of the medicine. Parliament approved the financial award on 12 March 1740. Stephens received her &pound;5000 on 17 March 1740 and was never heard from again.<br>
<br>This &#145;cure for the stone&#146; was highly sought after by the public, and it provoked much comparative and competitive experimentation among physicians and natural philosophers. Stephens's remedy was frequently discussed in the periodical press, in domestic manuals, and in medical pamphlets and monographs. Notable accounts of these experiments include H. Bracken's <span class="italic">Lithiasis Anglicana, or, A philosophical enquiry into the nature and origin of the stone and gravel in human bodies</span> (1739), S. Hales's <span class="italic">Account of some Experiments and Observations on Mrs. Stephens's Medicines</span> (1740), and Dennis de Coetlogon's <span class="italic">Full Examination and Impartial Account of All Relating to Mrs. Stephens's Cure</span> (1740). One physician, S. F. Morand, advertised Stephens's claims internationally when he took his own experiments with this medicine before the Academie Royale des Sciences, in France. He presented his account in &#145;Examen des rem&egrave;des de Mad'lle Stephens, pour la pierre&#146;, in <span class="italic">Histoire Academie Royale des Sciences</span> (1740, 1742, 177&#150;200). Stephens died at her house in Brook Green, Hammersmith, in 1774.<br>
