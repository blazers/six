<span class="headword">Percy,  Hugh</span>  (1784&#150;1856), <span class="occ">bishop of Carlisle</span>, the third son of Algernon Percy, first earl of Beverley (1750&#150;1830), and Isabella Susannah (1750&#150;1812), second daughter of Peter Burrell and sister of Lord Gwydyr, was born in London on 29 January 1784. His mother was sister to Frances Julia Burrell, who married Hugh Percy, second duke of Northumberland. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21941/', "Henry Percy")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21949/', "Josceline Percy")</script> were his brothers. He was educated at Eton College and St John's College, Cambridge, where he was admitted in December 1802, graduating MA in 1805 and DD in 1825; he was admitted <i>ad eundem</i> at Oxford in 1834. Having taken holy orders, he married, on 19 May 1806, Mary, eldest daughter of Mary and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17964/', "Charles Manners Sutton")</script>, archbishop of Canterbury, by whom in 1809 he was collated to the benefices of Bishopsbourne and Ivychurch, Kent. In 1810 he was appointed chancellor and prebendary of Exeter, which appointments he held until 1816. On 21 December 1812 he was installed chancellor of Salisbury Cathedral. In 1816 he was collated by his father-in-law to a prebendal stall at Canterbury Cathedral, and in the same year he received the enormously rich stall of Finsbury at St Paul's, which he held until his death. The income from these livings and stalls was over &pound;6000 p.a. In 1822 he was made archdeacon of Canterbury, and in 1825, on the death of Gerrard Andrewes, he was raised to the deanery. Two years later (15 July 1827), on the death of Walker King, he was consecrated bishop of Rochester, from which see, after a few months' tenure, he was translated, on the death of Samuel Goodenough, to that of Carlisle. This was just before his father-in-law's death. This bishopric he held until his death.<br>
<br>While dean of Canterbury Percy promoted the repair of the interior of the cathedral, &#145;clearing off the whitewash and removing modern incongruities&#146;, personally superintending the work. As a bishop, he was an opponent of the ecclesiastical commission's attempts to reform the church. He became a public enemy of the commissioners when in 1846 they reduced his subsidy from &pound;2000 to &pound;1500 p.a. Despite pressure, he refused to resign his chancellorship or his prebend. Geoffrey Best sees him as one of the &#145;conspicuous episcopal survivals from the prehistoric Hanoverian church&#146;  (Best, 404). Within his diocese Percy was less reactionary, though he was not popular; during the Chartist period bricks were thrown at him in Carlisle and his effigy burned. In 1838 he established a clergy aid society, and in 1855 a diocesan education society. He built thirteen new churches or chapels and rebuilt eighteen. He was first president of the Cumberland Infirmary, on which he spent much effort (a ward in the infirmary was named after him). He found Rose Castle, the episcopal residence, much dilapidated and deformed with incongruous additions. Determined to make it worthy of the see, he called in the Quaker architect Thomas Rickman, under whose directions the house was entirely remodelled without any detriment to its medieval character. The main cost was defrayed out of the episcopal revenues, but Percy is stated to have spent &pound;40,000 of his own money on the gardens, grounds, and outbuildings. A rosary, in which he delighted, was laid out by Sir Joseph Paxton, who also formed the terraced gardens. Percy was a high-churchman, and disliked Tractarians and evangelicals. He &#145;set not his affection on mediaeval frippery&#146;  (<span class="italic">Carlisle Patriot</span>, 9 Feb 1856). He was, Ellen Goodwin recalled,<blockquote>a great farmer; he was reputed the best judge of a horse in all the district. &hellip; He used to drive his own four horses all the way to London and to say there was no such hill as &#145;Rose Brow&#146; in all the distance. (Bouch, 387)</blockquote>Dictatorial and distant from his clergy, he had by the end of his life become a noted local character.Percy's first wife, with whom he had a large family of three sons and eight daughters, died in September 1831. He married, second, on 3 February 1840, Mary, the daughter of Sir William Hope Johnstone. His eldest son, Algernon, married Emily, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12853/', "Bishop Reginald Heber")</script> and heir of her uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12854/', "Richard Heber")</script>, and assumed the name of Heber in addition to his own. Percy died at Rose Castle on 5 February 1856, and was buried in the parish churchyard of Dalston.<br>
