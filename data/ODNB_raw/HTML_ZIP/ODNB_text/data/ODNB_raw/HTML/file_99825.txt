<span class="headword">Court,  Hazel Marjorie</span>  (1926&#150;2008), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born Margery Hazel Court at 134 Heathfield Road, Handsworth, Birmingham, on 10 February 1926, the younger daughter of George William Court, a stores clerk, and former professional cricketer with Durham County Cricket Club, and his wife, Mary Magdalene (Madge), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Blockley. When she was ten months old the family went to live at Eastern Road, Wylde Green, where her father worked for the United Yeast Company. His brief was to create a sports ground and club for the company's workers. By her own account Hazel enjoyed an idyllic childhood, entering fully into the seasonal delights of her environment. From a very early age she was drawn to acting, loved dressing up and performing in church shows, and was powerfully attracted to the great movie stars of the period, acting out their roles after leaving the cinema. The Second World War intervened when she was a teenager, and when her elder sister Audrey's husband was killed she went to live with her in Ealing. By happy chance Audrey showed the producer Norman Loudon and the director Anthony Asquith a photograph of the eighteen-year-old Hazel, which led to her first film role&#151;a one-line assignment in Ealing's valentine to the music-hall heyday, <span class="italic">Champagne Charlie</span> (1944). It also led to an affair of several years with Loudon, who was more than twice her age. In the early 1940s she had some stage experience with the Birmingham Alexander Theatre, appearing in <span class="italic">School for Scandal</span>, and studied acting at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.<br>
<br>In the immediate post-war period Court appeared mainly in modest movies made with largely domestic consumption in mind, but she made the most of the limited opportunities they offered her. She had the female lead opposite the popular comedians Flanagan and Allen in <span class="italic">Dreaming</span> (1945), a farce that gave her the chance to appear in several guises and a bizarre range of costumes. Her pert prettiness and shapeliness ensured a steady stream of films, with <span class="italic">Holiday Camp</span> (1947) perhaps the highlight from this period. In this hymn to post-war egalitarianism she played sympathetically a young war widow with a baby who finds romance at the eponymous venue. She had supporting roles to such 1940s stars as Sally Gray in the romance <span class="italic">Carnival</span> (1946), Phyllis Calvert in the feebly feminist <span class="italic">The Root of All Evil</span> (1947), Greta Gynt in the thriller <span class="italic">Dear Murderer</span> (1947), and Jean Kent in <span class="italic">Bond Street</span> (1948). In the latter she was the bride whose wedding dress gives rise to a multi-storied plot, but a demure Court could hardly compete with Kent in full cry as a tough prostitute. Court had leads in the minor period comedy <span class="italic">Meet Me at Dawn</span> (1947), in the dim thriller <span class="italic">My Sister and I</span> (1948), and in the surprisingly robust <i>film noir</i> <span class="italic">Forbidden</span> (1949), in which her purposeful heroine takes the sexual initiative in ways uncommon among her more genteel compeers. However, busy and often effective as she was in the 1940s, she never quite took her place with the major female stars of the decade, perhaps as a result of starting a little later than they had.<br>
<br>Court's co-star in <span class="italic">My Sister and I</span> was another Rank hopeful, (James Patrick) Dermot Walsh (1924&#150;2002), whom she married on 2 July 1949 and with whom she had a daughter, Sally. They appeared together in three above-average B movies: the semi-supernatural thriller <span class="italic">Ghost Ship</span> (1952), the oddly suburban <span class="italic">Counterspy</span> (1953), and <span class="italic">A Woman of Mystery</span> (1958), a Danziger Productions mystery in which she played a tediously subservient girlfriend. There were several other B movies in the often-anodyne 1950s, including two trim thrillers, <span class="italic">Behind the Headlines</span> and <span class="italic">The Narrowing Circle</span> (both 1956), in which she enjoyably sparred with the Canadian actor Paul Carpenter. The 1954 release <span class="italic">Devil Girl from Mars</span> became a camp classic among the cheeseparing science-fiction films of the decade, but Court's role was inevitably overshadowed by the showier types involved, especially Patricia Laffan, the titular visitor in search of virile male earthlings.<br>
<br>Hammer Studio's first venture into Technicolor horror revealed Court in all her red-haired, green-eyed, ample-bosomed glory as she was exposed to the danger of <span class="italic">The Curse of Frankenstein</span> (1957), which launched the studio's hugely profitable horror cycle and her career as Hammer's &#145;scream queen&#146;. At roughly the same time she came to wider notice in the television series <span class="italic">Dick and the Duchess</span> (1957&#150;8), opposite the American actor Patrick O'Neal. The rest of her career reflected her success in both horror and television. She made three well-regarded period shockers for the American director Roger Corman, <span class="italic">The Premature Burial</span> (1962), <span class="italic">The Raven</span> (1963; co-starring Vincent Price, Boris Karloff, and Peter Lorre), and <span class="italic">The Masque of the Red Death</span> (1964), all derived from Edgar Allan Poe. She was also a frequent guest star on American television from the late 1950s, including appearances in <span class="italic">Alfred Hitchcock Presents</span>, one episode of which was directed by the former actor Don Taylor (1920&#150;1998), whom she married on 25 March 1964, having divorced Dermot Walsh the previous year.<br>
<br>Apart from an uncredited cameo in <span class="italic">The Final Conflict</span> (1981), directed by Taylor, Hazel Court retired from acting in the early 1970s, and took up painting and sculpture, for which she trained in Italy. She settled permanently in the USA on her second marriage, which produced two further children, Courtney and Jonathan. After Taylor's death in December 1998 she went to live in their cabin at Lake Tahoe, California, in the High Sierras, where she died on 15 April 2008. Her autobiography, <span class="italic">Hazel Court: Horror Queen</span>, was published a week after her death. It is a somewhat fulsome account but, in refusing to dish dirt on colleagues, she emerges as a likeable enthusiast. She was survived by her three children.<br>
