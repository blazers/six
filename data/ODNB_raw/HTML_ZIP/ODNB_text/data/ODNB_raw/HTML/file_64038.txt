<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hammond, Dame  Joan Hood</span>  (1912&#150;1996), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born on 24 May 1912 in Christchurch, New Zealand, the daughter of Samuel Hood Hammond (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1875&#150;1950) and his wife, Hilda May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Blandford (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1885&#150;1955). Her parents were British, and when she was a few months old the family moved to Sydney, Australia. She was educated at the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Pymble, New South Wales, where from an early age she showed a natural aptitude for music and for sport. In 1928 she entered the New South Wales Conservatorium of Music to study violin, piano, and singing. She originally intended to be a violinist, but a bicycle accident at the age of twelve had left one arm shorter than the other, so she concentrated on singing. At the same time she played a great deal of golf, and at the age of seventeen she won the junior state championship.<br>
<br>In 1932 the Williamson Imperial Grand Opera Company gave a season in Australia, visiting Sydney, Melbourne, and other cities. The principal singers were Italian, but the chorus and minor roles were recruited locally. Hammond secured an engagement with the company as a mezzo-soprano, appearing in <span class="italic">Aida</span>, <span class="italic">Pagliacci</span>, and <span class="italic">Madama Butterfly</span>, as Giovanna in <span class="italic">Rigoletto</span>, and as Siebel in <span class="italic">Faust</span>. She obtained leave of absence to play in the ladies' state golf championship, which she won. The following year she was runner-up in the Australian open championship. She became golf correspondent for the <span class="italic">Sydney Telegraph</span>, meanwhile singing whenever and wherever she could, for music clubs, in cinemas, and even in department stores.<br>
<br>Another season of grand opera was presented in Sydney by Sir Benjamin Fuller in 1935. The singer taking the part of Venus in <span class="italic">Tannh&auml;user</span> dropped out, and Hammond sang the role at short notice. She also sang Helmwige in <span class="italic">Die Walk&uuml;re</span>. A fund of &pound;2000 was raised so that she could travel to Europe to study further. After a final concert in Sydney she sailed on 6 April 1936 in the Norwegian freighter <i>Dagfred</i>, arriving in Genoa six weeks later. She went first to Vienna, where she remained a year, though she did not care for her teacher. Then she went to London, where she studied with the Italian tenor Dino Borgioli, an excellent teacher. Now a soprano, she returned to Vienna in 1938 to sing at the Volksoper, as Nedda in <span class="italic">Pagliacci</span>, in the title role of <span class="italic">Martha</span>, and as Konstanze in <span class="italic">Die Entf&uuml;hrung aus dem Serail</span>. She made her London d&eacute;but that autumn, giving a recital at the Aeolian Hall and singing in <span class="italic">Messiah</span> under Sir Thomas Beecham at the Queen's Hall. Early in 1939 she returned to Vienna, to sing Mimi in <span class="italic">La Boh&egrave;me</span> and Violetta in <span class="italic">La traviata</span>, this time at the State Opera. She also prepared the roles of Elisabeth in <span class="italic">Tannh&auml;user</span> and Donna Elvira in <span class="italic">Don Giovanni</span>. Meanwhile the political situation was growing worse by the day. Hammond went back to London in August to sing at a Henry Wood Promenade Concert and did not return to Austria.<br>
<br>After war was declared Hammond volunteered as an ambulance driver, and sang for the BBC and with the Entertainments National Service Association to entertain the troops. In January 1940 she was asked to sing Mimi and Tosca at La Scala. With great difficulty she managed to get to Milan, and even started rehearsals, but Italy was about to enter the war on the side of the Germans, and she had to leave. For two years her operatic career, which had begun with such promise, was in abeyance. However, she was kept extremely busy in the concert hall and the recording studio. Her first recording paired the Bach-Gounod <span class="italic">Ave Maria</span> and Mendelssohn's &#145;On wings of song&#146;. This was followed by a number of operatic arias, including &#145;O my beloved father&#146; from <span class="italic">Gianni Schicchi</span>. In 1942 Hammond joined the Carl Rosa Opera Company, which had just began to operate again, making her British stage d&eacute;but in Glasgow as Madam Butterfly and touring the country for three years, singing Violetta, Marguerite in <span class="italic">Faust</span>, Leonora in <span class="italic">Il trovatore</span>, Mimi, and Tosca, as well as the Marschallin in <span class="italic">Der Rosenkavalier</span> in concert.<br>
<br>After the war Hammond toured Germany with Sadler's Wells, singing Butterfly, and in 1946 returned to Australia for a four-month concert tour. In 1947 she went back to Vienna to sing Mimi, Tosca, Butterfly, and Violetta. The State Opera was in ruins, and performances were given at the old Theater an der Wien. After a tour of South Africa, in 1948 Hammond made her Covent Garden d&eacute;but as Leonora in <span class="italic">Il trovatore</span>, and she returned there during the next three seasons as Leonore in <span class="italic">Fidelio</span>, as Aida, and as Butterfly. She toured the USA in 1949, and also appeared with the New York City Opera as Butterfly, Aida, and Tosca. During the Verdi celebrations in 1951, the fiftieth anniversary of his death, Hammond sang Elisabeth de Valois in <span class="italic">Don Carlos</span> at Sadler's Wells. She also took part in several performances of the Verdi <span class="roman">Requiem</span>, music that she particularly liked.<br>
<br>In the 1950s Hammond travelled widely, touring Scandinavia, east and central Africa, India, the Far East, Canada, the USA, Australia, and the Soviet Union, where she sang Aida and Tatyana in <span class="italic">Eugene Onegin</span> (in Russian) at Leningrad and Moscow. She also sang Tatyana and Fevronia in Rimsky-Korsakov's <span class="italic">The Invisible City of Kitesh</span> at Barcelona. One of her most popular recordings was &#145;O silver moon&#146; from Dvo&#345;&aacute;k's <span class="italic">Rusalka</span>; perhaps mistakenly, she sang Rusalka in the British stage premi&egrave;re of the opera at Sadler's Wells in 1959, which was not a great success. For the Elizabethan Opera Trust in Australia she performed Tosca and two new roles, Desdemona in <span class="italic">Otello</span> and Strauss's Salome. She broadcast several operas for the BBC, including <span class="italic">La forza del destino</span>, <span class="italic">Turandot</span>, Massenet's <span class="italic">Thais</span>, <span class="italic">Guillaume Tell</span>, and Rimsky-Korsakov's <span class="italic">Mlada</span>, as well as two contemporary works, Alan Bush's <span class="italic">Wat Tyler</span> and Dennis ApIvor's <span class="italic">Yerma</span>.<br>
<br>In November 1965 Hammond suffered a coronary attack and was forced to retire. Her many records continued to sell and in 1969 she was awarded a golden disc for &#145;O my beloved father&#146;, originally used to back Tosca's &#145;Vissi d'arte&#146;. She published her autobiography, <span class="italic">A Voice, a Life</span>, in 1970. Having been appointed OBE in 1953, CBE in 1963, and CMG in 1972, she was appointed DBE in 1974. Her home in Australia, together with her golfing trophies and all the souvenirs of her singing career, was destroyed by a bush fire in 1983. Music lovers all over the world sent replacements for her lost treasures. She died at Bowral, New South Wales, on 26 November 1996.<br>
