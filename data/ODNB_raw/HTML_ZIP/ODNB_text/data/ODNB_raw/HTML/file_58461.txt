<span class="headword">Headrick,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1759, <em>d.</em> 1841), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister, agronomist, and geologist</span>, was baptized in the Stirlingshire parish of Logie on 25 March 1759, second of eight children of John Headrick (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1730), farmer, and Isabel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Neilson (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1735). The family was believed to descend from two German brothers, Cromwellian soldiers settled in Scotland. Educated at the parish school and in Dunblane, Headrick matriculated at Glasgow University in 1774. He did not graduate, though he &#145;took many prizes&#146;  (Lowson and Young, 82), and proceeded to study for the ministry. Licensed by Hamilton presbytery on 25 April 1786, Headrick preached occasionally and evidently did some schoolteaching. He also pursued a lifelong interest in the natural sciences, joining a Glasgow chemical society in the late 1780s. In the 1790s he found employment in the atelier of Sir John Sinclair, probably working on <span class="italic">The Statistical Account of Scotland</span> and certainly on tasks for the board of agriculture and internal improvement under Sinclair's presidency. Headrick's <span class="italic">Essay on Manures</span> was published by the board in 1796.<br>
<br>By then Headrick was embroiled, as became almost habitual with him, in controversy. Following the death, in January 1796, of John Anderson (whose student he had doubtless been), Headrick was a candidate for the Glasgow University chair of natural philosophy, with the support (he believed) of William McDowall MP, then rector of the university, and of Henry Dundas, secretary of state for war. Defeated by canvassing on behalf of a rival, Headrick (who later nursed the delusion that he had been appointed to the chair and arbitrarily ejected from it) published, pseudonymously, a scurrilous verse lampoon on the university establishment: <span class="italic">A Peep into the Convent of Clutha</span> (1797). Having failed likewise to secure appointment as professor in the new institute set up under John Anderson's will, Headrick looked elsewhere for advancement. With the backing of Sir John Dalrymple of Cranston, he wrote to the first lord of the Admiralty (Earl Spencer) and to Dundas with elaborate accounts of weapons designed to facilitate operations (especially at sea) against France.<br>
<br>Neither these (often importunate) approaches nor an attempt in 1798 to secure presentation as minister of Slamannan having borne fruit, Headrick returned to work for Sinclair and others, surveying agrarian and other resources in the Scottish highlands and islands. His travels between 1797 and 1801 took him as far north as Loch Broom on the mainland and to the island of Lewis. On this basis Headrick published an article on the advantages of what became the Caledonian Canal (<span class="italic">Prize Essays and Transactions of the Highland Society</span>, 1799), and an essay on the improvement of waste lands (1801). In 1802&#150;3 he was in Caithness, surveying mineral resources for the Scottish exchequer chamber and engaging in a somewhat Pickwickian quarrel, with assault threatened and a duel in the offing. He also pre-contracted marriage with Katharine Macbeth (1787&#150;1856), the daughter, not yet sixteen, of a local farmer. The marriage was allegedly solemnized in Edinburgh on 3 September 1804 (though there is some dubiety as to the record of this). Still pursuing preferment, Headrick spent some time in London &#145;dancing attendance on my Lords of the Admiralty&#146;  (Lowson and Young, 89), but with no greater success than his letters had yielded. In the latter part of 1806 he was travelling again&#151;to Skye, to Fort Augustus, and especially to Arran. In 1807 his substantial <span class="italic">View of the Mineralogy, Manufactures, and Fisheries of the Island of Arran</span>, dedicated to Sir Joseph Banks, was published by Constable.<br>
<br>By then Headrick was at last receiving his long-sought preferment. Through the patronage of George Dempster of Dunnichen, he obtained crown presentation to that Forfarshire parish. He was ordained on 12 August 1807 as assistant and successor to the septuagenarian minister Thomas Masson, who died two years later. Headrick's troubles, however, were far from over. Not only did he find the manse dilapidated, even his stipend was threatened by claims from his predecessor's family. Neither problem had been resolved when Headrick completed his second major work, <span class="italic">A General View of the Agriculture of the County of Angus</span> (1813). As he neared his sixties, he still cherished hopes of further advancement: in 1817 he tried, but failed, to secure presentation to the parish of Dunblane, where he had been at school.<br>
<br>Dunnichen, however, and the county town of Forfar were, for the rest of his long life, to be Headrick's sphere, or rather, perhaps, his arena. Age did not wither his taste for hot water. In 1827, his <span class="italic">Lecture on geology &hellip; to shew, that the Mosaic account of creation is perfectly consistent with the best ascertained facts concerning the mineral structure of our globe</span> (1828), together with an earlier lecture on the physical sciences, both delivered in Forfar, evoked a vigorous complaint by the minister of the town. Two years later Headrick incurred the Forfar presbytery's censure for having made the Dunnichen pulpit available to James Hawkins, a local landowner who was &#145;neither a licentiate nor a member of the Church of Scotland&#146;  (Forfar presbytery minutes, 21 Oct 1829), and who became an adherent of the &#145;Row heresy&#146;. Relations between the two, however, were soured when Hawkins, principal heritor of the parish, supported efforts to have an assistant to the ageing Headrick appointed. Both published pamphlets in the course of the controversy. Eventually, in 1837, Headrick was induced to accept an assistant with right of succession. His later years had brought private as well as public troubles. Two of his five sons figure in the kirk session records of the parish as a result of having fathered illegitimate children. Both predeceased their father, who died at the manse of Dunnichen on 31 March 1841, and was buried in an unmarked grave in Dunnichen churchyard.<br>
<br>Headrick was a man of varied talents, though these were doubtless often misapplied. The &#145;vice or mole of nature&#146; in his case seems to have been a paranoid tendency to see conspiracy rather than his own inflated expectations as the bar to his fulfilment. Yet he deserves to be remembered, not only as a notable eccentric but as a late representative of the moderate churchmanship which had been a far from negligible factor in the making of the Scottish Enlightenment.<br>
