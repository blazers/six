<span class="headword">Toothill, Sir  John Norman</span>  (1908&#150;1986), <span class="occ">industrial manager and government adviser</span>, was born at 13 Trafford Road, Leicester, on 11 November 1908, the only son of John Harold Toothill, an engineer's fitter, and his wife, Helena Gibbins. He was educated at Beaminster grammar school, Dorset, following which he undertook an engineering apprenticeship, initially at Tilling, Stevens Ltd and later at Harris Lebus Ltd, the furniture manufacturer. During this apprenticeship he also undertook a course in cost (or management) accounting, qualifying as a cost accountant at the same time as he became an engineer. This dual expertise proved useful in a career that involved managing highly innovative engineering projects. While resident at Perivale, Middlesex, he married, on 4 May 1935, Ethel Amelia, the daughter of George Arthur Stannard, an engineer.<br>
<br>In 1935 Toothill was recruited to become chief cost accountant at Ferranti Ltd. Founded by Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti in 1882, this firm wanted to improve the efficiency of its radio factory at Moston, near Manchester. Given his engineering background, Jack Toothill proved to be highly suitable. He consequently moved to Moston to take up this challenging role.<br>
<br>Although Toothill started at Ferranti Ltd as chief cost accountant, it was as general manager of the firm's Scottish division that he made his biggest contribution. Early in 1943 the decision to produce gyro-gunsights (GGS) in quantity for D-day was made, and as Ferranti had made several prototypes for the Royal Aircraft Establishment they secured a large contract. Moston, however, was already overloaded with contracts, but as Edinburgh had a good pool of female labour Toothill was sent to report on the suitability of available premises. He reported to Stafford Cripps at the Ministry of Aircraft Production that none was suitable, resulting in a campaign to build a new factory. Working twenty-four hours a day, the factory at Crewe Toll, Edinburgh, was built using funds supplied by the Ministry of Aircraft Production and first started production deliveries later in 1943. Crucially, the chairman chose Jack Toothill to run the new operation, giving him permission to recruit sufficient engineering and managerial staff from the instrument and fuze departments in Moston.<br>
<br>By the time the war ended, the Crewe Toll team had become very proficient in this respect, manufacturing 9594 GGS units for the RAF. This also provided the basis of a business that over the following decades became a highly successful supplier of avionic equipment to air forces and civil airlines around the world. With the slump in defence orders after 1945, however, Vincent de Ferranti wanted to repatriate all outlying operations to the main factory, placing an enormous question mark over the Crewe Toll activity. Toothill, on the other hand, was so keen to stay in Scotland and make a great success of his burgeoning avionics business that he lobbied hard for a stay of execution. He also devised a strategy aimed at combining precision engineering with advanced electronics technologies, opening up four laboratories (radar, instruments, vacuum physics, and applications) to develop a viable product range. This was accompanied by the recruitment of a highly talented engineering team, using his contacts in government laboratories to ensure a steady supply of innovative thinkers. Some have claimed that his love of sporting activities like fishing and golf was the key reason why Toothill wanted to stay in Scotland; whatever the case, neither Ferranti Ltd nor Edinburgh regretted the decision to allow Crewe Toll to flourish.<br>
<br>While the late 1940s proved to be highly challenging, given the limited demand for military avionics, once the Korean War had started in 1950 and Britain participated in the rearmament of that decade, driven by the cold war, Crewe Toll generated a substantial business. The most successful product was the AI23 monopulse radar that originated in the instrument and fire-control department, while inertial navigation equipment was also developed as another long-term business. Jack Toothill was often able to secure contracts for this advanced equipment because he committed a lot of effort to meeting with people in the defence world, frequently at cocktail parties and trade fairs.<br>
<br>The shortage of skilled labour in Edinburgh also prompted the work on numerical control, another technology in which Crewe Toll developed a prominent position. Toothill always remained confident that his engineering team could take on any project in their chosen areas, a reflection of which was the rapid growth of Crewe Toll's order book. Indeed, by 1958 Crewe Toll had reported its first profit in excess of &pound;1 million, on a turnover of &pound;5.6 million. This growth also continued over the next thirty years, making the Scottish group the most important division within the expanding Ferranti empire. As a reward for this work Toothill was elevated to the main board of Ferranti Ltd in 1958.<br>
<br>Apart from establishing and building a highly successful avionics business in Edinburgh, another major aspect of Toothill's work was his vision for Scottish industry's future development. In the first place, he established a training school at Crewe Toll that was renowned across Scotland, starting the first Scottish higher national certificate in electronics. He also wanted to encourage further diversification away from traditional industries like coal and heavy engineering. After he was invited in 1949 to join the executive committee of the Scottish Council (Development and Industry), an advisory body on economic development, Toothill proposed in 1951 the construction of a central laboratory at Crewe Toll that would act as a core facility for other Scottish electronics firms in need of development facilities. The Ministry of Supply accepted this plan and provided &pound;513,000 for the new facility opened by the duke of Edinburgh in 1954.<br>
<br>In addition to his work for the Scottish Council, for which he was appointed CBE in 1955, Toothill also sat on the National Economic Development Council, after its formation in 1962, as a representative of Scottish interests. This appointment was prompted by the impact of the Toothill report on the Scottish economy (1961), in which he argued for greater government support for diversification and regeneration. This led to a knighthood in 1964, as well as a host of directorships at Scottish firms like AI Welders Ltd, Fochabers, Moray, the Edinburgh Investment Trust, and Brand-Rex Ltd. By the 1960s Sir John had become a leading Scottish figure in the industrial world, reflecting both the enormous growth of his Crewe Toll operation and his work on behalf of the Scottish economy. Other honorary awards were an LLD from Aberdeen University (1966) and a DSc from Heriot-Watt University (1968).<br>
<br>In 1968 Toothill's health deteriorated to such an extent that he was obliged to retire as general manager of the Crewe Toll division and pass on the reins to his highly successful successor, Sir Donald McCallum. He remained a director of Ferranti Ltd for another seven years, eventually retiring from business in 1975, spending his retirement in his beloved bungalow at Ordiequish overlooking the River Spey at Fochabers, Moray. He died in Spynie Hospital, Elgin, on 5 July 1986. By that time, the Scottish electronics industry had become a major player on the European scene, building dynamically on the foundations Sir John had laid at Crewe Toll.<br>
