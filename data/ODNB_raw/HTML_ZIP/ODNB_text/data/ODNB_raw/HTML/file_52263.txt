<span class="headword">Ottley,  Alice</span>  (1840&#150;1912), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was born on 23 March 1840 at Acton, Suffolk, the fourth of the sixteen children (of whom two died in infancy, two when young) of Lawrence Ottley (1808&#150;1861), vicar of Acton, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1902), daughter of the Revd John Bickersteth. In 1850 her father became rector of Richmond, North Riding of Yorkshire, holding a canonry from 1859. The family life was profoundly religious in the evangelical tradition and Alice was educated at home until after the death of her nearest sister, Bessie, in 1854, when she was sent away with two other sisters to a school in London kept by a former governess to the family. Unhappy there, she returned to Richmond in 1856 and devoted herself to her younger siblings, who included Henry Bickersteth Ottley (1850&#150;1932), a clergyman prominent in sabbatarian organizations, Edward Bickersteth Ottley (1853&#150;1910), canon of Rochester, Robert Lawrence Ottley (1856&#150;1935), regius professor of moral and pastoral theology at Oxford, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35343/', "Charles Langdale Ottley (1858&#150;1932)")</script>, a rear-admiral.<br>
<br>Lawrence Ottley died in 1861, leaving twelve children, the youngest a boy of eighteen months. The family went south and settled in Hampstead, where Mrs Ottley took in pupils, and to these and to her family Alice gave up her next twenty years in the self-abnegating spirit that was always characteristic of her. In the 1870s she began attending lectures organized by the London Ladies' Educational Association at University College (doing much of the necessary reading on the bus since there was so little time at home), including those in English language and literature given by Henry Morley. In 1876 she gained her honours certificate in the Cambridge higher local exam. In 1877 she deputized for a few weeks for Ada Benson, first headmistress of Oxford high school, and enjoyed the experience, though at this stage she was not in favour of girls' day schools; they did not, she thought, provide enough scope for the character training that to her was the main aim of education.<br>
<br>Mrs Ottley gave up her school in 1880, and Alice, the following February, went to teach at the school in Warrington Crescent, Maida Vale, run by Miss Margaret Clarke, whom she had met through her association with the Revd William Henry Cleaver, curate of St Mary Magdalene, Paddington. Her religious sympathies were now high-church (even when she was a child her father had described her as a little Puseyite), and she assisted Miss Clarke in the foundation (1872) of the Society of the Holy Name, an association for church teachers. In 1899 she became superior of the society, which held retreats for teachers. In 1883 Canon W. J. Butler (1818&#150;1894), looking for a headmistress for a new high school in Worcester run on Church of England lines, was told by the head of Oxford high school that Alice Ottley would be the ideal choice, and Miss Clarke herself persuaded her to leave Warrington Crescent to take up the appointment.<br>
<br>The school opened on 21 June 1883 in Britannia House, a fine early Georgian building, with ten children aged from ten to fifteen (later joined by one other) who were known as the First Brood. Two years later there were 125 pupils, whom she treated in those early days as an intimate family group and for whom she devised delightful treats. The school badge was a lily, the motto &#145;the white flower of a blameless life&#146;, and religious education and the spiritual development of the girls was Miss Ottley's paramount concern; she herself prepared them for confirmation. &#145;You are princesses in the Court of Heaven, and must behave as such&#146;, she told them  (James, 70), and she insisted on very high standards of deportment and speech. Like Charlotte Yonge (though a generation junior to her) she upheld the ideals of a past generation, which wanted girls to be selfless home-daughters without personal ambition, ministering to their parents and family; the regime of the school was more like that of a convent than the ordinary high school. She became regarded as legendary in Worcester, though some thought her standards too high and her ideas visionary and unpractical. The school council, however, knew that she had a strong will and practical ambitions&#151;such as the wish to put the science teaching on a satisfactory footing and to change the school's constitution so that it was no longer a commercial enterprise. (This was achieved the year after her death.)<br>
<br>Tiny, frail, exquisitely neat, white-haired, with an ivory white complexion, Alice Ottley had amazing powers of physical endurance despite poor health. She performed many good works outside the school, interesting herself in the Girls' Friendly Society, conducting <span class="roman">Bible</span> classes, caring one summer for the inmates of an almshouse, and lavishing hospitality not only on old members of the school but on the factory girls whom she entertained every Christmas. In 1884 she was elected a member of the Association of Head Mistresses, becoming vice-president in 1896 and representing the association on Worcestershire education authority after 1902. She became a member of the archbishops' central church council on secondary education in 1899.<br>
<br>Though dreading retirement, Miss Ottley had several times suggested to the school council that it was time she should go, but had always been persuaded to stay on. In 1912, however, after the opening of the summer term, she at last had to give in, exhausted and prematurely aged. Nevertheless, she helped appoint her successor, initiated her into the school's ways, and interviewed every member of the staff individually. Some she asked to stay on; others she advised to find new situations. She was not even well enough to attend the school's twenty-ninth birthday celebrations, though she sent lacrosse equipment as her present. She died at 47 Albany Street, London, of bronchial pneumonia on 18 September 1912, and was buried at Astwood cemetery, Worcester. On 7 February 1914 it was decided that the school's name should be changed to the Alice Ottley School. Two Alice Ottley scholarships, tenable by former pupils at the school, were established at St Hugh's College, Oxford.<br>
