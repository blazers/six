<span class="headword">Seddon,  Thomas</span>  (1821&#150;1856), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born on 28 August 1821 at 150 Aldersgate Street, London, the eldest of the nine children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39355/', "Thomas Seddon (bap. 1793, d. 1864)")</script>, cabinet-maker [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67865/', "Seddon family")</script>], and his wife, Frances Nelson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thomas (1800&#150;1880). After indulging his passion for drawing at a boarding-school in Epsom, Surrey (later removed to Stanmore, Middlesex), which he attended from 1828 for about ten years, parental opposition to the professional pursuit of fine art led him to enter his father's firm, Seddon &amp; Sons; in 1841&#150;2 he studied ornamental art in Paris. He returned to Seddon &amp; Sons and began to design furniture, and to attend life classes at Charles Lucy's studios at Tudor Lodge in Mornington Crescent, London; there he met Ford Madox Brown, who was to become his artistic mentor. From about 1848 to about 1852 he took classes at the Artists' Society in Clipstone Street.<br>
<br>Seddon's first landscape sketches date from the summer of 1849, during a visit to Betws-y-coed in Caernarvonshire, Wales, where he was already asserting the value of painstakingly transcribing nature. In 1852, a year after taking up painting professionally, his first oil, <span class="italic">Penelope</span> (priv. coll.), was shown at the Royal Academy. The earliest of his landscapes to be traced, <span class="italic">L&eacute;hon, from Mont Parnasse</span> (exh. RA, 1854; Museo de Arte de Ponce, Ponce, Puerto Rico), was executed in Brittany in the summer of 1853. By this date Seddon and William Holman Hunt&#151;an equally devout Christian&#151;were planning a trip to the East.<br>
<br>Seddon landed in Egypt on 6 December 1853, met the explorer Richard Burton, and executed a watercolour of him, <span class="italic">An Arab Shakyh in his Travelling Dress</span> (exh. Art Gallery and Museum, Brighton, 1983; priv. coll.). Hunt arrived in January 1854; although reliant on Seddon's gifts as a linguist, he took exception to his adoption of Arab costume and propensity for practical jokes. In the following month the artists encamped close to the pyramids, which Seddon painted at sunset (retouched 1855; exh. 14 Berners Street, London, 1855, and the Fine Art Society, London, 1978; priv. coll.). Their first sight of Jerusalem, on 3 June 1854, was, for both artists, a deeply moving religious experience: Seddon camped at Aceldama and for five months worked on <span class="italic">Jerusalem and the Valley of Jehoshaphat from the Hill of Evil Counsel</span> (1854&#150;5; exh. 14 Berners Street, London, 1855; Tate collection).<br>
<br>On 19 October 1854 Seddon left Syria for Dinan in France, where he became engaged to Emmeline Bulford; they married in Paris on 30 June 1855, and a daughter was born to them in 1856. On his return to London in January 1855, Madox Brown observed that Seddon's pictures &#145;present quantities of drawing and truthfulness seldom surpassed but no beauty, nothing to make the bosom tingle. Could I but have seen them in progress&#151;I will do all I can to make him improve them yet&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 117). From 17 March to 3 June nine of these works were exhibited at Seddon's studio at 14 Berners Street, including <span class="italic">Dromedary and Arab at the City of the Dead, Cairo</span> (priv. coll.) and the watercolours <span class="italic">The Great Sphinx at the Pyramids of Gizeh</span> (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford) and <span class="italic">Interior of a Deewan, Formerly Belonging to the Copt Patriarch, Near the Esbekeeyah, Cairo</span> (also exh. RA, 1856; priv. coll.), all of which are dated 1854. A larger one-man show was held at 52 Conduit Street in May and June of 1856.<br>
<br>Although Seddon completed many of his orientalist pictures in Europe, where he also painted replicas and new compositions such as <span class="italic">Arabs Return to their Tents on the Border of the Egyptian Desert</span> (exh. Society of Arts, 1857; priv. coll.), which was commissioned by William Marshall of Preston in 1856 and which was Seddon's last finished painting, he was passionately committed to painting in the East and thus returned to Cairo in October 1856. He died there of dysentery on 23 November and was interred in the protestant burial-ground in the city. His tragic demise galvanized the Pre-Raphaelites into organizing a subscription to buy <span class="italic">Jerusalem</span> for presentation to the National Gallery. It formed the centrepiece of an exhibition of over one hundred of Seddon's works at the Society of Arts in London on 6 May 1857, which John Ruskin opened with a memorable speech sealing the artist's reputation as the quintessential &#145;prosaic&#146; Pre-Raphaelite, committed to faithful transcription of historic landscape  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Society of Arts</span>, 360&#150;62).<br>
