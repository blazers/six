</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Meagher,  Thomas Francis</span>  (1823&#150;1867), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist and soldier</span>, was born in the city of Waterford, at what is now the Granville Hotel, Meagher Quay, on 3 August 1823. Little is known of his mother apart from the fact that she was a member of the Quan family of Waterford. His father, Thomas Meagher (1796&#150;1874), was, however, quite prominent. A prosperous merchant engaged in the Newfoundland provision trade, he was elected mayor of Waterford in 1843 and 1844, and later represented the city in the British House of Commons, 1847&#150;57. The marriage produced two other children, Henry Meagher JP (<i>d</i>. 1875) and Mary Agnes Meagher, who became a nun.<br>
<br>The Meaghers were a prominent family who had long held lands in the barony of Irrekin, Tipperary. They were gradually dispossessed, and the process was escalated after their open support for James II in 1689. Following the treaty of Limerick, 1691, many Meaghers left Ireland for service in Catholic Europe and distinguished among these was <a name="cosubject_18482"></a><span class="headword">Thaddeus <span class="st"> [Thad&eacute;e]</span>  de Meagher</span>  (1690&#150;1765). Sometimes referred to as Chevalier de Maar, he served in the French army and in 1734 was commissioned in the Saxon lifeguards of Frederick Augustus II, king of Poland and elector of Saxony. Appointed the king's chamberlain in 1739, he was promoted to colonel, 1740, appointed captain-proprietor of the Swiss guards, 1742, and advanced to the rank of major-general, 1744, and later lieutenant-general, May 1752, in the Polish army. At the beginning of the Seven Years' War, 1756, Frederick the Great of Prussia invaded Saxony, and de Meagher was dispatched to Wilsdruf to negotiate Saxony's neutrality with Frederick. General de Meagher died in Dresden on 22 May 1765.<br>
<br>Educated by the Jesuits at Clongowes Wood College, co. Kildare (1833&#150;9), Thomas Francis Meagher later attended their college at Stonyhurst, Lancashire (1839&#150;43). He returned to Waterford in 1843 with a lisping English upper-class accent, affected manners, and a taste for fine clothes. In 1844 he was sent to Queen's Inn, Dublin, to study law but quickly abandoned his studies for politics. He attached himself to the radicals of the Repeal Association, Young Ireland, who advocated a physical force solution to end the union with Britain. At an emotional meeting in Conciliation Hall, Dublin, on 28 July 1846, he made an impassioned speech asking the members not to &#145;abhor the sword&#146; nor &#145;stigmatize the sword&#146; but to view it as an instrument of liberation. When moderate members called for his expulsion from the association, he and other radicals left the meeting and the organization. William Makepeace Thackeray sarcastically labelled him Meagher of the Sword, a name Meagher proudly used for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>In January 1847 Meagher was a founder member of the Irish Confederation, a new organization dedicated to raising revolution in Ireland. In February 1848 he unsuccessfully contested, much to his father's annoyance, a by-election in the city of Waterford and in the following March made a violent speech which attracted the attention of the authorities. Arrested for sedition, he travelled to Paris while on bail to congratulate the new French provisional government on its own successful revolution. The day before his trial, 15 April 1848, he presented the citizens of Dublin with a new Irish tricolour. Arraigned before Lord Chief Justice Blackburne on 16 April 1848, he was later released when the jury failed to agree on a verdict.<br>
<br>As a member of the Irish Confederation's war directory, Meagher toured Ireland in the summer of 1848 attempting to stir up rebellion. The activity of Meagher and his confederates so alarmed the government in Dublin that in July 1848 a warrant and a reward were posted for his arrest. Following a somewhat pathetic clash with the police in Ballingarry, co. Tipperary, Meagher and others were taken into custody. In October 1848 he was tried before a special commission headed by Lord Chief Justice Blackburne in Clonmel. He was found guilty of high treason and sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered, but his sentence, because of his youth, was reduced to penal servitude and exile for life in Tasmania. He was transported in July 1849.<br>
<br>Allowed a considerable liberty upon a ticket of leave, Meagher farmed, and in February 1851 married Catherine Bennett (1832&#150;1854), the daughter of another Irish political exile. The marriage produced two sons but only the younger, Thomas junior, survived; in 1872 he became a US army cadet at West Point. Thomas senior planned his escape. On 3 January 1852 he notified the magistrate at Campbelltown that he intended to break his parole, rode to the coast, and by pre-arrangement was picked up by Captain Betts of the <i>Elizabeth Thompson</i>. Transferred to the <i>Acorn</i>, he arrived in New York on 26 May 1852. His revolutionary reputation, good looks, and daring escape made him an instant hero among the Irish Catholic population of New York. In 1853 he published his <span class="italic">Speeches on the Legislative Independence of Ireland</span>. But he proved as restless in the United States as he had in Ireland. Having become an American citizen, and a popular public lecturer, he helped to create the <span class="italic">Citizen</span> newspaper in 1854; he studied law and was called to the New York bar in September 1855. In November, following the death of his first wife the previous year, he married Elizabeth Townsend, daughter of Peter Townsend, a successful New York businessman. In April 1856 he was a co-founder of the <span class="italic">Irish News</span>, a New York newspaper which became noticeably pro-southern, toured Central America in 1857, and became a strong supporter of the Democratic Party. Regarding the slavery issue, Meagher identified with the south, and even after the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter, April 1861, he initially remained pro-southern. However, following President Lincoln's call for volunteers, Meagher decided to fight for the union.<br>
<br>Meagher raised a company of Irish zouaves, which became company K of the Irish 69th New York volunteers, and became its captain. With the regiment, he fought at the first battle of Manassas, 21 July 1861, where he had his horse shot from under him. Responding to nativist attacks on the bravery of the Catholic Irish, he published <span class="italic">The Last Days of the 69th in Virginia</span> (New York, 1861). When the regiment, a thirty-day militia unit, volunteered for the duration of the war, it became the nucleus for an American Irish brigade seen by Meagher as a unit he hoped would emulate the eighteenth-century &#145;wild geese&#146; brigades in European armies. Elected the colonel of the brigade's first regiment, Meagher proved tireless in raising the command, and when James Shields, an Irish-born veteran of the Mexican War, refused command, Meagher was commissioned the unit's first brigadier-general, 3 February 1862. He proved to be a courageous commander who helped shape the brigade into one of the army of the Potomac's finest combat units.<br>
<br>The brigade distinguished itself during the seven days' campaign in Virginia, 25 June to 1 July 1862, and during the battle of Antietam, September 1862, where it launched a heroic charge against a strong Confederate position known as the Bloody Angle. During the battle of Fredericksburg, 13 December 1862, Meagher led an even more heroic, but hopeless, charge against Mary's Heights. Decimated by this action, the brigade was little more than a skeleton command during the battle of Chancellorsville, May 1863. When he was refused permission to return to New York to raise new volunteers for the brigade, he resigned his commission, which was accepted on 14 May 1863. As a democrat, Meagher had made political enemies who suggested the high casualty rate among his command was due to his heavy drinking. Returning to New York, he was accorded another hero's welcome. Frustrated by inactivity, he petitioned constantly for reappointment. Political reasons led to his being recommissioned a brigadier-general in December 1864. Ordered to Nashville, he was placed in command of the military district of Etowah. When directed to transport his command to Savannah, January 1865, to support General Sherman's Georgia campaign, he so mismanaged the transportation&#151;due, so his critics believed, to his heavy drinking&#151;that he was relieved by General Grant and ordered home to await orders. Inactive, he resigned his commission on 12 May 1865.<br>
<br>Political reasons led to Meagher's appointment by President Andrew Johnson as secretary to the territory of Montana. Arriving in the territory in September 1865, he became <i>de facto</i> governor in September 1866. Faced with disorder and the hostility of the Sioux under Red Cloud, Meagher raised a militia unit, the Montana Volunteers. While awaiting a shipment of arms for the unit at Fort Benton, he fell off the deck of the <i>G. A. Thompson</i> into the Missouri River and drowned on 1 July 1867. His body was never recovered, nor his death adequately explained.<br>
<br>If considered by some, such as Thackeray, as an impulsive and reckless Irishman, Meagher was none the less a brave soldier and was considered a national hero by both the Irish and Irish-Americans alike. In Waterford he is remembered by a plaque outside the Granville Hotel, and a fine equestrian statue outside the Montana state capital in Helena. He was survived by his second wife, Elizabeth, who presented his ceremonial swords and portrait of him in his federal uniform to the city corporation of Waterford in 1886.<br>
