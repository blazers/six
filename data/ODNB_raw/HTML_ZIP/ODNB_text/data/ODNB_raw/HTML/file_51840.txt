<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Donaldson,  Arthur William</span>  (1901&#150;1993), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 13 December 1901 at 27 Rosefield Street, Dundee, the third and youngest son of George Donaldson (1859&#150;1909), yarn dresser, and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kerr (<i>b</i>. 1860). He was educated at Harris Academy, Dundee, where he gained five higher leaving certificate passes in 1917. His first job was as assistant registrar of births, marriages, and deaths in Dundee, but in 1919 he began a career in journalism as a reporter with the Dundee <span class="italic">Courier</span>. In 1923 he pursued new career opportunities in the USA. Employed at first in the motor industry in Detroit, he rose to become assistant secretary in the Chrysler Corporation's public procurement division, responsible for dealing with the department of defense in Washington. On 24 September 1932, in Gates' Mill, Ohio, he married Violet Glenday Bruce (<i>b</i>. 1907), from Forfar, who, like him, had come to work in America. They had one son and one daughter. In 1928, though resident in the United States, he joined the newly formed National Party of Scotland, which sought full Scottish independence to be achieved through the contesting of parliamentary elections by this party which was to be wholly free of any other political affiliations. Although these commitments were on occasion challenged, as in 1934 and 1942, Donaldson was always loyal to the original principles.<br>
<br>In 1937 Donaldson returned to Scotland, where he became a poultry farmer in Lugton, Ayrshire. At the same time he began to write articles presenting the nationalist view on such topics as finance, resources, land use, and economic issues in general. He revealed as himself an informed authority upon whom his colleagues relied for guidance. As war threatened he argued, first, for Scottish neutrality, and then against the imposition of conscription, in both cases because Scots had no government democratically empowered to take such decisions affecting them. These activities no doubt caused his detention under section 18B of the defence regulations in May 1941, until petitions to the secretary of state for Scotland secured his release. Donaldson's stance on the war and on conscription was shared by Douglas Young, elected in 1942 chairman of the Scottish National Party (SNP), as the National Party of Scotland had become, following its merger with the Scottish Party in 1934, and when Young contested a by-election in Kirkcaldy in 1944, Donaldson acted as his agent. In 1945 he himself was SNP candidate in Dundee. In 1948 he moved to Forfar, where he soon became editor of the <span class="italic">Forfar Dispatch</span>. He became active in municipal affairs and for some years served as a councillor and as burgh treasurer. These commitments meant that he was not active in the elections of 1950, 1951, and 1955, but in 1959 he fought the Kinross and West Perthshire constituency and he contested the same seat in a by-election in 1963.<br>
<br>In 1960 Donaldson became chairman of the SNP, bringing to the job exactly the qualities then required. An inspirational speaker, he enthused supporters and impressed the uncommitted. He toured branches and constituencies, and the party's growth in membership, branches, and votes throughout the decade was phenomenal. He led from the front, being a candidate in the general elections of 1964, 1966, and 1970, contesting West Perth, Moray and Nairnshire, and finally Galloway. Significantly all these areas were subsequently won by his party. He was replaced as chairman in 1969, not because he was the target of any dislike or criticism, but rather because a new generation was ready to take office. He remained active at branch, constituency, and national level well into his eighties.<br>
<br>A wiry and agile man, even in his later years, Donaldson's body language told of his indomitable dedication. He entered any company briskly and with a spring in his step, and his bright eyes and strong features marked him for the good-humoured but determined warrior which he was. He died of bronchopneumonia on 18 January 1993 in Forfar, and was cremated on 23 January in Dundee. He was survived by his wife and by his son, Arthur, his daughter, Beth, having predeceased him.<br>
