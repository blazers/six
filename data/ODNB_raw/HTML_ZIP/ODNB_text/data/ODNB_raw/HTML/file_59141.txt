<span class="headword">Fisher <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Smiles; <em>other married name </em>Ford]</span>,  Patricia</span>, Lady Fisher  (1921&#150;1995), <span class="occ">politician and charity worker</span>, was born on 5 April 1921, the only child of Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Walter Dorling Smiles (1883&#150;1953) of Portavo Point, Donaghadee, co. Down, politician, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Heighway, of Manchester. She was the great-granddaughter of Samuel Smiles, author of <span class="italic">Self-Help</span>, and her great-aunt was Isabella Beeton, the cookery writer. Walter Smiles's career exporting tea took the family to Assam in the 1920s before he returned to Britain and entered parliament as Conservative MP for Blackburn (1931&#150;45), then Ulster Unionist MP for County Down (1945&#150;50) and North Down (1950&#150;53). Her education was completed in London at Bangor collegiate school and Glendower School, and over a two-year period in Florence, Lausanne, Munich, and Paris, where she learned the local languages. During the war she worked at London's Ulster Canteen and at a children's hospital in Northern Ireland. While working there she met Captain Neville Montagu Ford (1906&#150;2000), a professional cricket player and son of the Revd Dr Lionel Ford, headmaster of Harrow School and dean of York. They married on 22 February 1941 in the presence of the prime minister of Northern Ireland.<br>
<br>Patsie Ford, as she was known, lived in Cheshire with her husband and two daughters, but after her father drowned on the <i>Princess Victoria</i> in January 1953 she was nominated as the Unionist candidate for his constituency of North Down. Her unopposed return made her Northern Ireland's first woman MP. Few women had succeeded in the martial world of Northern Irish politics and it was unsurprising that its first woman MP was chosen in succession to a male relative. She had worked on her father's campaigns but was an inexperienced public speaker and so took lessons. Unfortunately in her maiden speech to the house she had to apologize for her <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span> article on an all-night sitting, which mentioned finding Bessie Braddock and Edith Summerskill napping on two beds in the lady members' room and snoring. The matter was referred to the committee of privileges, which decided that new members deserved latitude, and her apology sufficed.<br>
<br>Patricia Ford's later speeches focused on Northern Irish issues, such as pensions for Royal Irish Constabulary widows, and she strongly supported equal pay. In 1954 she and three other women MPs rode suffrage-era horse-drawn carriages to parliament and delivered a massive equal pay petition. She joined the House of Commons Yacht Club and pursued the pastime that she had begun at Donaghadee. A keen sportswoman who enjoyed golf, tennis, skiing, and skating, she was at nearly 6 feet the tallest woman MP. Her public-speaking instructor praised her musical voice, and she was known for her vivacity, free spirit, and irreverent sense of humour. With this temperament she may have found parliament uncongenial, particularly after her inauspicious d&eacute;but, and she disliked the juvenile incivility of many male MPs. She stood down in May 1955 but remained politically connected by marrying the Conservative MP <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63306/', "Nigel Thomas Loveridge Fisher (1913&#150;1996)")</script> on 28 August 1956, shortly after her first marriage had been dissolved.<br>
<br>Nigel Fisher belonged to the Conservative Party's liberal wing and Patricia Fisher was of similar outlook. Her open-mindedness in attending a wedding at Brompton Oratory in 1962 prompted a highly publicized expulsion from the Loyal Orange lodge women's section, yet this willingness to reach across the sectarian divide enabled her to contribute more to society than she had done in politics. After visiting the devastated Catholic neighbourhood of Ballymurphy, west Belfast, in 1972 and seeing the dangers that mothers faced in raising their children she founded the Women Caring Trust to improve children's lives in areas racked by violence. Funding came partly from a national appeal, a charity shop in her husband's constituency of Surbiton, and an annual Lords versus Commons swimming contest. The trust supported mobile playbuses, integrated schools, youth clubs, holiday homes, and various classes for mothers and teenagers from both sides of the community. Noting that men had failed to resolve the Irish problem, Patricia Fisher hoped that women could succeed as peacemakers, and her own legacy was not only to brighten young lives but to foster tolerance and understanding among those who were to shape Northern Ireland's future. She served as co-chairman of the trust for nineteen years (sharing the duties with Catholic women) and was president from 1991 until her death, on 23 May 1995. She was survived by her husband, Sir Nigel Fisher, the two daughters of her first marriage, a stepson, and a stepdaughter.<br>
