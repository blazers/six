</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Heylyn,  Peter</span>  (1599&#150;1662), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and historian</span>, was born in Burford, Oxfordshire, on 29 November 1599, the second son of Henry Heylyn (<i>d</i>. 1622), a minor country gentleman, and his wife, Elizabeth Clampard (<i>d</i>. 1616). He was educated at Burford grammar school and was admitted initially to Hart Hall, Oxford, in 1614, but was then elected a demy of Magdalen College in 1615; he matriculated on 19 January 1616.<h2>
<a name="Oxfordandearlyinfluences"></a>Oxford and early influences</h2>Heylyn soon clashed with other members of the college: such was his diligence in the office of &#145;impositor of the Hall&#146; that, as he later reported, he was dubbed &#145;the perpetual dictator&#146;, and the &#145;heart burning&#146; of both the other demies and the senior fellows towards him &#145;break out into whipping and other base usuage&#146;  (Heylyn, xiv). He gained early renown for his geographical works. After graduating BA in October 1617 he began to lecture on historical geography in the college, and was elected a fellow of Magdalen in the following year. After proceeding MA in 1620 he published his lectures as <span class="italic">Microcosmos: a Little Description of the Great World</span> (1621) and secured its presentation to its dedicatee, Prince Charles, at Theobalds. This proved his most popular work, going through no fewer than eight editions by 1639. From his early years Heylyn was also active as a poet. At a later age he recollected his early poems with pleasure, and continued writing them into the early 1630s, when he dedicated poems to Charles I and William Laud. He had a particular taste for satire, enthusiastically translating epigrams by Martial as well as composing a Latin comedy, <span class="italic">Theomachia</span>, and a derisory poem against Barten Holyday entitled &#145;Whoop Holiday&#146;, and in 1625 he composed a lengthy satirical account of his trip to France, which went through several editions in the 1650s.<br>
<br>Heylyn's background was not that of a straightforward divine. Moreover, despite his later association with the Laudian movement, there is no obvious indication of early associations with such ideas. On the contrary his earlier connections would seem to have been with figures more linked to puritanism. One of his kinsmen was the famous puritan sheriff of London and member of the feoffees for impropriations, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13172/', "Rowland Heylyn")</script>; his early schoolteacher, Edward Davys, retained his living during the protectorate; he studied at the godly inclined Magdalen College; one of his tutors was the &#145;verie zealous and pragmaticall Puritan&#146;  (Heylyn, <span class="italic">Memorial</span>, xii) Walter Newberry; and he received early patronage from the puritanically inclined earl of Danby, and support from the Calvinist dean of Winchester, John Young. The religious views apparent in the early editions of the <span class="italic">Microcosmos</span> are those of a conventional anti-Catholic Calvinist, and include many opinions that he would later condemn, including the claim that the pope was Antichrist, that continental iconoclasm was praiseworthy, and that the Albigensians were worthy predecessors of English protestants.<h2>
<a name="Pursuitofpatronageandactivitiesasanapologist"></a>Pursuit of patronage and activities as an apologist</h2>Heylyn's progress seems to have been disrupted by a disputation at the divinity schools in Oxford in 1627, where he incurred the wrath of the regius professor of divinity, John Prideaux. While Heylyn later sought to present this conflict as an ideological clash, this seems to be a profitable gloss on what seems more to have been a combination of misunderstanding and personal animosity. The most important consequence of this event is that it may have first brought Heylyn to the attention of his later patron William Laud, whose patronage he was actively soliciting by 1629, the year he proceeded BD. Heylyn had in the meantime been ordained in 1624 and married, on 28 October 1628, Letitia, daughter of Thomas Highgate of Hayes, Middlesex, whose elder sister had already married Heylyn's elder brother. He continued to hold his fellowship for a year after the marriage, leading to later charges that he had married clandestinely. Heylyn's anxious search for preferment in the wake of his marriage led to a trip to the Channel Islands in 1629 as chaplain to the earl of Danby, but he used the opportunity to send an expos&eacute; of the disorders of Guernsey presbyterianism to Laud (undoubtedly against Danby's wishes). His search for public employment under Laud continued in 1630, when he prompted the government's attack upon the feoffees for impropriations in a very public and highly provocative sermon in Oxford, a copy of which he sent, bound in vellum, to Laud. Again, Heylyn demonstrated his ability to discern puritan subversion where others had not thought to find it, and condemned his kinsman Rowland Heylyn in the process.<br>
<br>Heylyn also sought to appeal to the king, to whom he became a chaplain-in-ordinary in 1630. As well as publishing anonymously a curious work&#151;<span class="italic">Augustus</span>&#151;which described how Augustus Caesar used devious methods to establish an absolute monarchy, Heylyn adopted a more direct and less controversial route in the form of his <span class="italic">History of St George</span> (1631) with an eye to Charles's particular and well-known enthusiasm for the Order of the Garter (the work was presented to the king by Laud in February 1631). Heylyn was soon put to work as a hitman against the regime's opponents. In 1632 he was charged in the king's name with reviewing William Prynne's <span class="italic">Histriomastix</span>, and came up in record time with a vitriolic review which secured Prynne's prosecution for sedition. In the previous year Heylyn had been presented to a prebendal stall in Westminster Abbey (as well as a living in Hemingford Abbots) clearly with the intention that he should dig up information on Laud's opponent, the dean, John Williams. Within seven months he was already offering to secretary of state Sir John Coke information against Williams which he had wheedled out of the civil lawyer Dr William Spicer. Two years later he again played a prominent role in the drawing up of thirty-six articles of complaint against the dean by the prebendaries. At the hearing of the commission into the grievances in February 1636 Williams commented prophetically &#145;If your Lordships will hear that young fellow prate, he will presently persuade you that I am no Dean of Westminster&#146;. Just a matter of months after this hearing Heylyn embarked on a pamphlet battle with Williams over the government's altar policy, in the course of which he composed what were the principal defences of this Laudian policy, <span class="italic">A Coale from the Altar</span> (1636) and <span class="italic">Antidotum Lincolniense</span> (1637).<br>
<br>Heylyn also levelled his guns at Laud's opponent and his own nemesis, the Oxford regius professor of divinity John Prideaux. Having himself proceeded DD on 13 April 1633 and been licensed to preach, he accused Prideaux of heterodoxy after the act that summer, and the following year he mischievously published in translation an earlier lecture that Prideaux had given on sabbatarianism. Heylyn supplied his own preface to the work and presented the lecture as if it defended the newly reissued <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span>. His own substantial defence of the <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span>&#151;<span class="italic">History of the Sabbath</span>&#151;was submitted to the press the following year, to be followed by a general defence of the policies of the personal rule in 1637, the <span class="italic">Briefe and Moderate Answer</span>: each was an officially sponsored apologetic work, the former designed to complement the work of Bishop Francis White, the latter the published speech of Archbishop Laud. He also made a substantial contribution to Laud's judgment in the case of Henry Burton, John Bastwick, and William Prynne.<br>
<br>In career terms these various pieces of hatchet work and polemical writing paid major dividends. Further crown appointments followed: Heylyn was presented to the rich benefice of Houghton in Durham in 1633, which he substituted for that of Alresford, Hampshire, allegedly on the specific instructions of the king, so that he would be nearer to court to do his bidding. Here he substantially expanded the parsonage house and built a new chapel.<br>
<br>After the imprisonment of Williams, Heylyn was appointed treasurer of the Westminster chapter in December 1637, and was soon afterwards appointed to the parsonage of Islip, which he exchanged for the rectory of South Warnborough, Hampshire (a living in the gift of St John's College, Oxford, and the exchange therefore conceivably aided by Laud's intervention). Soon afterwards, however, he and his family at Alresford fell seriously ill. On Heylyn's recovery he immersed himself in researching the history of the Church of England. It was presumably about this time that he made substantial notes on proceedings of convocation, copies of which survive at Lambeth Palace Library. He also contributed materials to Laud's revised and expanded version of his <span class="italic">Conference with Fisher</span>. Like other Laudians he did not write official defences of royal policy during the Scots crisis, as the defence of episcopacy fell to Joseph Hall, although he contributed his own <span class="italic">The History of Episcopacie</span> (1642) under the pseudonym of Theophilus Churchman.<h2>
<a name="Crisisof16401642andthecivilwar"></a>Crisis of 1640&#150;1642 and the civil war</h2>Heylyn attended the notorious convocation of 1640, where he seems to have played an important role in proposing and drawing up a standard set of visitation articles to be adopted for the whole country and in proposing the canon calling for greater observance of the king's accession day, as well as providing the necessary precedent of 1586 to justify the continued sitting of convocation after the dissolution of parliament.<br>
<br>The assembling of the Long Parliament in November 1640 made it likely that Heylyn, like other supporters of the Laudian regime, would be called to account for his actions. He was confronted first by John Williams, the released dean of Westminster, who dramatically interrupted a sermon that Heylyn was giving in the abbey by knocking on the pulpit with his staff and exclaiming &#145;No more of that point&#146;. Heylyn's account of their subsequent exchanges claims that they reached a cautious cease-fire. At the same time Heylyn found himself cross-examined before a committee investigating Prynne's prosecution, which found him guilty as a delinquent, although the failure to prosecute Heylyn any further may have been partly due to his pointed reminder to Charles of &#145;how much it doth concerne the king in honour to justifie the intimacion of his owne commands&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/476/97). After composing a paper justifying the right of the bishops to take part in the trial of the earl of Strafford, Heylyn retired to Alresford.<br>
<br>It was there, late in 1642, that Heylyn found his house attacked by the troops of Sir William Waller, who had orders to bring him a prisoner to Portsmouth. Heylyn escaped and joined the king at Oxford, where he was instructed to remain and to write on the king's behalf. He was the first editor of the royalist newsbook <span class="italic">Mercurius Aulicus</span>, which began with Heylyn's characteristic claim to be seeking to deliver the dispassionate and objective truth. He was reportedly happy to pass the work on to Sir John Berkenhead when this was recommended by Sir Kenelm Digby in September 1643, although he returned to work on it for a few weeks in June 1644 during Berkenhead's absence. Later in 1643 Heylyn wrote <span class="italic">The Rebells Catechism</span>, as well as <span class="italic">The Stumbling Block of Schisme</span>, although the latter work was not published until the 1650s. He responded to news of Laud's execution with a heartfelt <span class="italic">Briefe Relation of the Death and Sufferings of &hellip; L. Archbishop of Canterbury</span> (1645) which celebrated him in verse as a martyr. In the meantime Heylyn was declared a delinquent by the Commons in 1644, was sequestrated from Alresford in 1644 and from South Warnborough in 1645, and had his estates and goods seized, and his books carried away to Portsmouth. In early May 1645 Heylyn gained the king's leave to retire to Winchester, although he soon had to flee to stay with friends in Wiltshire, before settling at Minster Lovell, Oxfordshire, in 1648 the seat of his deceased elder brother, which he farmed of his nephew for several years.<h2>
<a name="Writingsofthe1650s"></a>Writings of the 1650s</h2>There Heylyn resumed his writing. He published the strongly clericalist <span class="italic">The Undeceiving of the People in the Point of Tithes</span>, his substantial commentary on the creed (<span class="italic">Theologia veterum</span>), and perhaps his most famous work, the <span class="italic">Cosmographie</span>. Published in 1652 this was an enormous and highly popular expansion of his earlier <span class="italic">Microcosmos</span> into a folio volume of nearly a thousand pages, and was sufficiently well regarded that the council of state saw fit to obtain a copy for their better instruction. In the meantime Heylyn had compounded for his sequestrated estate in December 1646, and contrived to live sufficiently well (in comparison with other deprived clergy, and despite the complaints of his successor at Alresford) to purchase, in 1653, Lacy's Court, near Abingdon, Berkshire, within convenient distance of Oxford. Here he built a small private chapel in which prayer book services were conducted and he also became occupied in local affairs, successfully intervening with the courts to prevent the demolition of the church of St Nicholas, Abingdon. He was less fortunate in his attempts to avoid the decimation tax, however.<br>
<br>Heylyn's taste for combat also began to emerge once more in his published work as he became involved in a number of controversial exchanges with several authors, picking over the bones of the religious and political history of the pre-war period, and sometimes defending his own actions. His anonymous <span class="italic">Observations on Mr Hamon L'Estrange's Life of Charles I</span> (1656) were attacked in their turn, and further defended in Heylyn's <span class="italic">Extraneus vapulans</span> (1656). Another opponent was Nicholas Bernard, who had published an exposition of the late Archbishop James Ussher's views on the sabbath, which opposed the work of Heylyn (among others). Heylyn replied with his <span class="italic">Respondet Petrus</span>, which the council ruled should be burnt for its attack on the morality of the fourth commandment, although Heylyn claimed that this sentence was not in fact carried out by the London authorities to whom it was entrusted. The <span class="italic">Respondet Petrus</span> also contained attacks on another historian, William Sanderson, whose <span class="italic">History of Charles I</span> Heylyn also attacked in a further work, <span class="italic">Examen historicum</span>. It was in this latter work that Heylyn also famously took up the cudgels against Thomas Fuller's <span class="italic">Church History</span>, accusing him of pro-puritan bias. Other opponents whom Heylyn confronted in these works included Henry Hickman, Richard Baxter, and John Harrington. In every case Heylyn showed himself to be an unapologetic defender of the ecclesiastical policies of the personal rule and an implacable critic of its puritan opponents, whom he considered to be directly responsible for the calamities that had overtaken the country.<br>
<br>It would be misleading, however, to imply that Heylyn had retreated into a scholarly shell, wedded to discredited ideas and apathetic to the prevailing political situation. His <span class="italic">Ecclesia vindicata</span> of 1657 suggests a more intriguing agenda. A collection of a number of works published in the 1640s, along with almost all his previously unpublished works, it is a compendium of defences of the Church of England as Heylyn saw it. Despite its uncompromising tone, however, it is not presented as a simple rant in the wilderness. It is dedicated, curiously, to his old (and hitherto neglected) Burford schoolmaster, perhaps singled out because he was the only acquaintance of Heylyn's who had retained a living in the interregnum church. A copy of the work in the Bodleian Library (Bodl. Oxf., 4&deg; Rawlinson 152) contains a further remarkable manuscript dedication by Heylyn to no less a figure than Oliver Cromwell. Doubtless buoyed up by hopes that Cromwell would accept the crown Heylyn argued that a re-establishment of the Church of England would provide the most effective support and accompaniment to a civil settlement. A presentation copy of his <span class="italic">Examen historicum</span> also survives bearing an unsigned manuscript dedication to Richard Cromwell, although, like the <span class="italic">Ecclesia vindicata</span>, the text provides an unapologetic endorsement of Laudian policies. <span class="italic">The Stumbling-Block of Disobedience</span> (1657) had initially been intended for the royalist cause, but Heylyn published it as a warning to the leaders of the Commonwealth not to trust popular spirits. In other works, such as the <span class="italic">Observations</span>, Heylyn also demonstrated a less than wholehearted dedication to the Stuart monarchs (and Charles in particular), in contrast to his consistent devotion to Laud's memory. Charles might have died for the Church of England, but Heylyn was not convinced that the Church of England should die for the Stuart dynasty (although he was shrewd enough to present another copy of the <span class="italic">Ecclesia vindicata</span> to Charles II with a completely different manuscript dedication, as well as contributing historical introductions to two collections of Charles I's works in the period immediately prior to the Restoration).<h2>
<a name="Restoration"></a>Restoration</h2>With the restoration of Charles II in 1660 Heylyn was restored to his livings, but did not receive any further promotion, despite his undoubted expectations. As subdean of Westminster he presented the royal sceptre to the king at the coronation, but this constituted the limit of his role in the Restoration. Many reasons may lie behind his lack of promotion: his blindness (the <span class="italic">Cosmographie</span> of 1652 was the last book which he completed with his own hand, and by 1660, while he could discern shapes, he was unable to read or write); his lack of obvious patrons at court; his &#145;very mean port and presence&#146; and lack of courtly graces (according to Anthony Wood); or perhaps his inflexible nature at a time when compromises needed to be sought with presbyterians. Despite his acid remark &#145;Much good may it do the new Bishops: I do not envy them&#146;  (Barnard, clxxxii), Heylyn did what he could to ensure that the political power of the church was re-established: in correspondence with the earl of Clarendon he urged the calling of convocation so that the church would be re-established on a proper footing rather than re-emerging from the Savoy conference; he advised on the organization of the convocation itself (although he did not participate as a member); and in a sermon commemorating the Restoration in 1661 he warned of the urgent need to ensure that churchmen were present on the privy council.<br>
<br>Heylyn's most important contribution to the Restoration church, however, came in the form of the trilogy of historical works that he completed during these final years. Principal among these was <span class="italic">Ecclesia restaurata</span>, his history of the English Reformation, which he had first begun to research in the late 1630s. It provides an emphatically Laudian view of the Reformation, withering in its attacks on the excesses of the Edwardian reformation, and presenting a settlement that was essentially complete by 1560, although threatened by the emerging puritan movement, whose advent looms over the final pages of the work. His <span class="italic">Aerius redivivus</span> (published posthumously) took this account of the misdeeds of the presbyterian movement forward in a European context, and presented the upheavals of the civil war and interregnum as the culmination of a puritan plot that could be traced back to the earliest days of the vestiarian controversy; Calvinism was presented as the natural ally of civil unrest. The final and most famous part of the trilogy was Heylyn's biography of Laud, <span class="italic">Cyprianus Anglicus</span>. Not only a sustained apology for the life and policies of the archbishop this work also provides a historical defence of the Laudian church itself. It is prefaced by an account of the English Reformation which emphasizes its moderate Melancthonian nature, so that both the Arminian doctrine and the ceremonial policies of Laud and his followers can be represented as a heroic and rearguard defence of the historical orthodoxies of the English Reformation in the face of puritan sabotage. Heylyn did not live to see the publication of these final two works, however: he died in Westminster on 8 May 1662 and was buried under the subdean's seat in Westminster Abbey. His wife survived him, dying about March 1667.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>The polarized view of the Church of England that Heylyn propounded has meant that he has been alternately praised and vilified by succeeding generations of scholars and churchmen. His works found their most enthusiastic audiences in the midst of the polarized religious politics of the 1670s and 1680s. His major works were regularly reprinted in the 1670s, and in 1681 a substantial collected volume of his previous works was published, followed by two biographies. He was attacked by John Locke and Algernon Sidney, and his monument in the abbey was defaced, but he was eulogized by many tories. His <span class="italic">Ecclesia restaurata</span>, with its condemnation of the excesses of the Reformation, was alleged by Gilbert Burnet to have played a role in converting the future James II to Catholicism. In the eighteenth century his <span class="italic">Historia quinquarticularis</span> was translated into Dutch and praised by the Arminian party, and acted as a focus for contemptuous attacks on his reputation by Augustus Toplady and others during the controversies over the Calvinism of the Church of England. In the nineteenth century he was listed as an authority in John Keble's <span class="italic">Tract 78</span>, and his <span class="italic">Ecclesia restaurata</span> was published by the Ecclesiastical History Society in 1849, but the Anglo-Catholic movement seems to have had mixed feelings about him. He was listed as a divine whose works were intended to be included in the <span class="roman">Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology</span>, but these volumes never appeared.<br>
<br>While there has been no shortage of writers ready to accept Heylyn's view of the lineage of high-church Anglicanism, it has also been common to treat him as merely an unscrupulous polemicist. It would be unfair, however, simply to disregard Heylyn's scholarly pretensions. He was certainly no theologian, but he did regard himself as a historian, and in this guise he devoted himself to the service of the church and state. His works display an increasing obsession with the view that all disputes could ultimately be reduced to matters of historical fact, and, for all his distortions, he usually deployed a more assured command of much greater bodies of materials than did his rivals. His conviction that scholarship should serve direct political purposes was in step with the convictions of the time. The fact that he is so often presented by historians as a uniquely cynical and untrustworthy scholar, rather than one among many in a tumultuous age, may perhaps be explained by the fact that his rendering of events has become so influential. Heylyn's partisan view of the Church of England and her Reformation has proved so persistently attractive and influential among high-church Anglican groups that the need to focus on his shortcomings and distortions has always seemed an urgent task.<br>
