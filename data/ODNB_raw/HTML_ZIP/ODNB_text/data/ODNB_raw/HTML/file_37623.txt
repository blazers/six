<span class="headword">Karno,  Fred</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Frederick John Westcott]</span>  (1866&#150;1941), <span class="occ">comedian</span>, was born on 26 March 1866 at Paul Street, Exeter, the eldest of the six sons and the seven children of John Westcott, cabinet-maker and french polisher of Exeter, and his wife, Emily Bowden, also of Exeter. He had a perfunctory elementary education in Exeter and Nottingham. He began as a circus acrobat and gymnast as one of the Three Carnoes with Bob Sewell and Ted Tysall. This became the Karno Trio, from which he took his stage name in the 1880s. By the 1890s he had developed his flair for low comedy, and established himself as an entrepreneur of often &#145;speechless&#146; sketches. From Karno's Fun Factory in Camberwell he sent forth teams of comedians to perform his endless series of slapstick mini-shows as set pieces on music-hall bills. He had an early success with &#145;Jail Birds&#146;, while other favourites were &#145;The Football Match&#146;, starring Harry Weldon as Stiffy the goalkeeper, and &#145;Karno's Komics&#146;. However, the cameo which won everlasting fame was &#145;Mumming Birds&#146;, first performed in 1904 at the Star Music Hall, Bermondsey. This is reputed to be the funniest burlesque of music-hall there has been, and, with its stage within a stage, it ran in one form or another for thirty years.<br>
<br>In 1913 Karno expended a huge part of the fortune he had gathered on buying Tagg's Island on the Thames in Hampton and there built his &#145;Karsino&#146; at a cost of &pound;70,000. The outbreak of the First World War ruined all chance of its success&#151;he had hoped to sell it after two years to the Lyons company&#151;and he never quite recovered financially or professionally. He ran an off-licence in the latter part of his life.<br>
<br>Karno's &#145;army&#146; gave either a solid start or valuable experience to dozens of comedians. Charles Chaplin was spotted as a film prospect when with a Karno company, while other famous names associated with him include Stan Jefferson (Laurel, of Laurel and Hardy), Fred Kitchen (of the famous catchphrase, &#145;Meredith, we're in&#146;) Will Hay, Sandy Powell, Wee Georgie Wood, and Max Miller. Immortalized by the soldiery in the First World War, Fred Karno's army lives on as a descriptor of chaotic organization. To a famous hymn tune the troops irreverently sang: &#145;We are Fred Karno's army, Fred Karno's infantry; we cannot fight, we cannot shoot, so what damn good are we?&#146;<br>
<br>Karno married Edith (1867/8&#150;1926/7), theatre assistant and daughter of John Cuthbert, journeyman rope manufacturer of Stockport, in Lambeth, on 15 January 1889. They had eight children, of whom six died in extreme infancy and only two sons, Frederick Arthur and Leslie, survived. On 16 June 1927, after the death of his first wife, whom he had treated with some cruelty, he married his long-time mistress, Marie Theresa Laura, daughter of Thomas William Moore of London, theatrical manager and co-founder of the Moore and Burgess Minstrels. Fred Karno died on 17 September 1941 at his home, 24 Wharfedale Road, Parkstone, Dorset.<br>
