<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cudlipp,  Hubert Kinsman <span class="st"> [Hugh]</span></span>, Baron Cudlipp  (1913&#150;1998), <span class="occ">journalist and publishing executive</span>, was born at 118 Lisvane Street, Cardiff, on 28 August 1913, the youngest son in the family of three sons and one daughter of William Christopher Cudlipp, commercial traveller for a provision merchant, and his wife, Bessie Amelia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kinsman. Named Hubert on his birth certificate, he decided while still a schoolboy that the name Hugh had a better ring to it, and adopted it for life. He was so successful both in choosing and using this sobriquet that very few of his adult friends ever realized that it was not his actual birth name.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Along with his two older brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32658/', "Percival Cudlipp")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94859/', "Reginald Cudlipp")</script>, both of whom also became Fleet Street editors, Hugh Cudlipp was educated first at Gladstone elementary school and then at Howard Gardens secondary school, both in Cardiff. Leaving school, with relief, at the age of fourteen, he was fortunate enough to follow Reginald onto a local weekly paper, the <span class="italic">Penarth News</span>, published in a dormitory seaside suburb of Cardiff. It was not in fact much of a job: the paper was run on a shoestring and the two younger Cudlipp brothers comprised its entire editorial staff. They were officially apprentices serving their indentures but, with no premiums being paid, salaries in any normal sense were not either. For years afterwards Hugh Cudlipp kept in his possession a letter recording the arrangement made with his father that he was to be paid 5<i>s</i>. a week for his first year, 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. for his second, and the princely sum of 10<i>s</i>. for his third. The paper, however, folded well before even the first proposed modest increase could come into effect. Cudlipp found himself equally thwarted in his next job. After the collapse of the <span class="italic">Penarth News</span> he secured a junior reporter's post on the second of the two evening papers that Cardiff then boasted, only to see it disappear in a matter of months through a merger with its more prosperous rival. Not yet sixteen, he shrewdly resolved that his journalistic future did not lie in south Wales, and made for Manchester, in those days second only to Fleet Street in terms of newspaper production.<br>
<br>Cudlipp's career prospered in Manchester. He joined Lord Kemsley's <span class="italic">Manchester Evening Chronicle</span> and particularly enjoyed his time as a district reporter working in Blackpool. (He later wrote that he found the experience of observing the British working class on holiday &#145;more instructive than a year at a university&#146; Cudlipp, <span class="italic">Walking on the Water</span>, 45.)) He also benefited from a solid grounding in the sub-editor's trade. But, although only nineteen, he already knew enough to realize that he would never achieve his ambitions in journalism unless he went to London. In 1932 he did just that, transferring to Fleet Street and to another Kemsley title, the <span class="italic">Sunday Chronicle</span>, where he became an astonishingly young features editor. It was in these early days in Fleet Street that he made his first marriage, on 8 April 1936, to Edith Elizabeth Gertrude (Bunny) Parnell, (1912/13&#150;1938), a journalist and daughter of Frederick Robert Parnell, master upholsterer. Ever afterwards he enigmatically referred to her as &#145;the channel swimmer&#146;. (In truth it was the Bristol, not the English, channel that she had swum&#151;though as a dutiful fianc&eacute; he did follow her in a dinghy.) Everything else about this youthful first marriage he tended to keep to himself, perhaps because it failed long before it was formally ended, in 1938, by her death in childbirth (he was not the father of the baby, who also died).<h2>
<a name="TheSundayPictorial"></a>The Sunday Pictorial</h2>Cudlipp's decisive career break came just three years after he had arrived in London. He noticed&#151;and was encouraged by his eldest brother, Percy (already editor of Lord Beaverbrook's <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>), to follow up&#151;a classified advertisement in the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> for &#145;a bright assistant features editor with ideas, able to take charge&#146;  (Cudlipp, <span class="italic">Walking on the Water</span>, 49). No indication was given as to the paper concerned and, when Cudlipp learned that it was the then limping tabloid the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, he almost withdrew his application. The reluctance, however, on the part of Lord Kemsley to offer him more than a 10<i>s</i>. a week increase in order to keep him&#151;&#145;I would have been prepared to stay for an extra quid&#146;&#151;made up his mind for him. On 3 August 1935, when not quite twenty-two, he joined the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>&#151;where, with two gaps, he remained for the rest of his active journalistic career.<br>
<br>Within six months Cudlipp had been promoted to features editor, and two years later, in September 1937, he found himself transferred&#151;this time as editor&#151;to the <span class="italic">Mirror</span>'s stable companion, the <span class="italic">Sunday Pictorial</span>. There he formed what was easily the most influential professional association of his life: his alliance with that paper's newly appointed editorial director, Cecil Harmsworth King. It was he who asked Cudlipp to come over from the <span class="italic">Mirror</span>, thereby earning for both of them the undying enmity of Harry Guy Bartholomew, the <span class="italic">Mirror</span>'s editorial director. An aloof and taciturn old Wykehamist (who happened, in <span class="italic">Mirror</span> terms, to be &#145;founder's kin&#146;: he was nephew to both Northcliffe and Rothermere), King was the polar opposite to Cudlipp. Olympian in his judgements and cold in his manner, King prided himself on being a strategist, once remarking: &#145;I have a greater gift of foresight than anyone I have ever met&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>). For his part Cudlipp, far more of a natural leader with his dynamic diction and raffish good looks, saw himself simply as a communicator. Between them they created a daring, contemporary version of the <span class="italic">Sunday Pictorial</span> based on a dashing use of pictures, modern American-style typography, and, above all, political nous of an entirely new kind in a popular paper. The paper's always trenchant anti-appeasement articles were written by Cudlipp himself under the pseudonym of Charles Wilberforce, a device that enabled him to combine his gift for invective with King's knowledge of the workings of the political system.<br>
<br>The editor's chair of the <span class="italic">Sunday Pictorial</span> proved the only one that Cudlipp ever occupied, and even then his period in it was interrupted by the war years. Through its criticism of Neville Chamberlain the paper had attracted some opprobrium in right-wing circles, and towards the end of 1940 a question was asked in the House of Commons as to why its editor, only twenty-seven, was not already in uniform. This was an unfair aspersion on Cudlipp's patriotism: he had done his best to get his &#145;reserved occupation&#146; classification lifted, and was only too keen to take part in the war effort. In December 1940 he enlisted in the Royal Sussex regiment, was soon sent to Sandhurst, and, having arrived as a subaltern in Egypt in time for the battle of El Alamein, was from 1943 to 1946 head of the army newspaper unit for the Mediterranean. In this capacity he founded and launched the British forces' paper, <span class="italic">Union Jack</span>, the title intended as a conscious riposte to the US army's publication, <span class="italic">Stars and Stripes</span>. On 31 October 1945 he married a former <span class="italic">Mirror</span> journalist and future <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> columnist, Eileen Mary Ascroft (1914&#150;1962), with whom he had been in love since before the war. She was the daughter of Robert William Ascroft, of independent means, and the divorced wife of the film director Alexander Mackendrick. Cudlipp was appointed OBE (military) in 1945, and the following year was demobilized, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel.<h2>
<a name="CudlippandCecilKing"></a>Cudlipp and Cecil King</h2>Back in Geraldine House, off Fetter Lane, the headquarters both of the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> and of the <span class="italic">Sunday Pictorial</span>, Cudlipp once again found himself facing the abiding animosity of his former boss Bartholomew. It seems implausible that his original defection could still have been held against him; more probably what Bartholomew now recognized in Cudlipp was a threat to his own job. Certainly Bartholomew seems to have wanted him out of the way, and in 1949&#151;with Cecil King temporarily absent in Nigeria, looking after the company's interests there&#151;he succeeded in attaining his objective. It was, however, a short-lived triumph: within two years (Cudlipp spent the intervening period none too happily as managing editor of Lord Beaverbrook's <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span>) King mounted a counter-putsch, and this time it was Bartholomew who was out. The invitation to Cudlipp to return followed at once, although this time no longer merely as editor of the <span class="italic">Sunday Pictorial</span> but&#151;now that King had moved up to being board chairman&#151;as editorial director of both papers.<br>
<br>For the next seventeen years King and Cudlipp, two very different individuals&#151;as distinct in their backgrounds as they were disparate in their interests&#151;worked harmoniously together. This was partly because King concentrated on extending the company's commercial base, acquiring the Amalgamated Press in 1958, and following that up with the takeover of the Odhams Group in 1962, bringing two further national newspapers (the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span> and <span class="italic">The People</span>) into <span class="roman">Mirror</span> ownership. With a typical touch of hauteur the nephew of Lord Northcliffe declared himself, the following year, the first chairman of the International Publishing Corporation (IPC), a title that eventually passed, somewhat inauspiciously, to Cudlipp. There were, of course, occasional policy disagreements. It was no secret, for example, that in 1956 King thought that the <span class="italic">Mirror</span> should support Sir Anthony Eden in his attempt to recover the Suez Canal from Colonel Nasser. King may on this occasion have had his finger closer on the working-class pulse than did Cudlipp but the latter argued forcefully that to support &#145;Eden's war&#146; would be to wreck the paper's traditional relationship not merely with the Labour Party but with all progressive opinion.<br>
<br>Next to journalism, politics had always been Cudlipp's consuming passion and, although he recognized that little or nothing could be done for the Labour Party at the general election of 1955&#151;he eventually came up with the clever, if defeatist, headline &#145;Keep the tories tame&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, 24 May 1955)&#151;he pulled out all the stops on its behalf in 1959. That year's election result, in which the Conservatives under Harold Macmillan increased their majority from 60 to 100, came as a crushing blow to Cudlipp. Feeling that he had misread the nation's mood, he immediately declared &#145;a holiday from politics&#146;, even removing the traditional slogan &#145;Forward with the people&#146; from the paper's masthead and ending the twice-weekly political column that had been contributed for the previous four years by the Labour MP Richard Crossman. Instead <span class="italic">Mirror</span> readers in the week immediately following the election were regaled by the sad tale of Ferdinand the Bull, a creature so gentle that he refused even to do the duty expected of him.<br>
<br>It was not Cudlipp's finest hour. But he soon found a new cause. In the long years of argument over British entry into Europe (or the Common Market, as it was then known) the <span class="italic">Mirror</span> was always stalwart in making the positive case. The freshly re-elected Conservative government had every reason to feel grateful to it; indeed a Conservative cabinet minister at the time of the initial application in 1961 was heard to murmur &#145;We should be all right with the <span class="italic">Mirror</span> behind us&#146;&#151;meaning that the support of the <span class="italic">Mirror</span> ought to enable the government to win the battle of public opinion  (Windlesham, 157). Of course this new alignment put some strain on the paper's time-honoured relationship with the Labour Party, made worse when, at the party conference of 1962, its leader Hugh Gaitskell came out strongly against British entry. Gaitskell's premature death three months later, and the emergence of Harold Wilson as his successor served, however, to ease matters, and by 1964 the <span class="italic">Mirror</span> was back firmly in Labour's corner (though not perhaps quite as vociferously as in 1959). It may nevertheless have been significant that Cudlipp chose to use the election campaign as the background for relaunching the old working-class <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span> as a paper now called <span class="italic">The Sun</span>, &#145;born of the age we live in&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>). It was one of Cudlipp's few flops, and the unlucky broadsheet was never to prosper until it was bought for a song by Rupert Murdoch and turned into a tabloid in 1969 (something that Cudlipp had always felt inhibited from doing, for fear of creating a rival to the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>).<h2>
<a name="SucceedingCecilKing"></a>Succeeding Cecil King</h2>The early 1960s were not easy years for Cudlipp. His second wife, Eileen Ascroft, died of carbitral poisoning in a tragic accident at their home in Strand on the Green, Chiswick, on 29 April 1962. Nevertheless Cudlipp recovered his normal good spirits with his marriage, on 1 March 1963, to the then editor of the <span class="italic">Woman's Mirror</span>, Joan Latimer (Jodi) Hyland, daughter of David Jones, solicitor's clerk. This proved easily the longest lasting of his three marriages and brought him both calm and contentment. There was not, however, much sign of those qualities in his professional life. He agonized over the failure of <span class="italic">The Sun</span> (which, the unkind alleged, meant that he had lost his popular touch), he mourned the fact that the Wilson government was not economically more successful, but above all he had to deal with the increasingly alarming megalomaniac tendencies of his own chairman, Cecil King. Unlike Cudlipp, who had never allowed himself to be bowled over by Wilson, King had great expectations of the new prime minister. Like his uncle Northcliffe in his relationship with Lloyd George, these tended to focus on the part that he would find himself playing as the power behind the throne. Things therefore got off to a bad start when, on forming his government in 1964, Wilson offered King merely a life peerage (rather than the hereditary viscountcy that he had expected), together with a rather humdrum post as minister of state at the Board of Trade. King angrily turned both offers down. He allowed his sense of grievance to fester, and his grand office suite in IPC's new headquarters at Holborn Circus became a gathering place for all the malcontents of Wilson's Labour Party.<br>
<br>How far Cudlipp initially went along with King's disillusioned views is difficult to establish but there seems no question that some kind of Rubicon was crossed at a meeting that Cudlipp personally was asked to set up between King and Earl Mountbatten of Burma, the former chief of the defence staff. At this meeting, held on 8 May 1968 at Lord Mountbatten's Westminster home in the presence not only of Cudlipp but also of Sir Solly Zuckerman, scientific adviser to the government, King recklessly made the suggestion that Mountbatten should hold himself in readiness to take charge of the emergency government that would no doubt be needed after the inevitable military overthrow of the Wilson administration. For Cudlipp the sheer lunacy of this proposal (immediately refused by Mountbatten and branded as &#145;treachery&#146; by Zuckerman) appears to have brought matters to a head. Two days later, with Cudlipp's encouragement, King's notorious, signed, personal assault on the Wilson government, headed &#145;Enough is enough&#146;, appeared on the front page of the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>. It was always Cudlipp's defence that he thought this course was preferable to the paper officially endorsing its chairman's line, but he also must have realized what the likely consequences would be. They did not take long to materialize. Three weeks later King was deposed by his own colleagues on the IPC board, and Cudlipp was unanimously chosen as chairman in his place.<br>
<br>Cudlipp never felt entirely happy about wearing King's mantle; his natural habitat was the newsroom, not the sumptuous chairman's quarters on the ninth floor of the new Holborn Circus skyscraper. It was King himself who somewhat patronizingly announced on the day of his dismissal that his old subordinate was &#145;a first violin rather than a conductor&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>)&#151;and there may have been a germ of truth in that gibe. Certainly it was with some relief that, a year later, Cudlipp allowed IPC to merge with, and become a subdivision of, Reed International (which had traditionally supplied it with its newsprint). This meant that he was no longer responsible for the central commercial strategy of the company and could return to what he did best&#151;inspiring other journalists and lending his own flair to the business of producing mass-circulation newspapers. He did not, however, continue to do so for very long. In October 1971 he announced his impending retirement, which took effect on 31 December 1973. Knighted by Edward Heath in 1973, for his services to the European cause, he was created a life peer, as Baron Cudlipp of Aldingbourne, in the county of Sussex, on the nomination of Harold Wilson in the following year.<h2>
<a name="Retirement"></a>Retirement</h2>In retirement at Chichester, Sussex, Cudlipp scrupulously observed Stanley Baldwin's injunction against speaking to the man at the wheel or spitting on the deck, and made only one tactical error, when he briefly made a return to what was by then called Mirror Group Newspapers, as a &#145;consultant&#146; to Robert Maxwell, after those papers had passed into his greedy hands in 1984. His salary from Maxwell was a mere &pound;10,000&#151;and Cudlipp, soon realizing his mistake, ended the arrangement after a single year. Otherwise he concentrated his energies on the cultural life of Chichester, taking particular interest in the Festival Theatre there and becoming, in 1975, founder chairman of the city's annual festivities of music, arts, and fun. He also found time to write: both his autobiography, <span class="italic">Walking on the Water</span> (1976), and his reflections on the newspaper trade, <span class="italic">The Prerogative of the Harlot</span> (1980), were written in retirement, although two earlier (rumoured to be &#145;ghosted&#146;) works&#151;<span class="italic">At your Peril</span> (1962) and <span class="italic">Publish and be Damned</span> (1955)&#151;had appeared in his active, Fleet Street years. He made occasional speeches in the House of Lords, where he began by taking the Labour whip before, in 1981, joining the short-lived Social Democratic Party. A born raconteur, he was for twenty-five years a highly popular member of the Garrick Club. He died at his home, 14 Tollhouse Close, Avenue de Chartres, Chichester, of lung cancer, on 17 May 1998. He was survived by his wife, Jodi. He had no children.<br>
