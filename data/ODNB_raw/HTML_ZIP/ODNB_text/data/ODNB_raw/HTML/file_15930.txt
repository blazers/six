<span class="headword">Lambe,  William</span>  (1765&#150;1847), <span class="occ">physician and vegetarian</span>, one of the four children of Lacon Lambe, an attorney, and his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of John Berington and sister of the Catholic divine Joseph Berington (1746&#150;1827), was born in St Peter's parish, Hereford, on 26 February 1765. He was educated at Hereford grammar school and St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1786, MB in 1789, and MD in 1802. He became a fellow of his college on 11 March 1788.<br>
<br>In 1794 Lambe married Harriet Mary (<i>d</i>. 1804), daughter of Captain John Walsh. They had six children: Harriet (<i>b</i>. 1794); Mary (<i>b</i>. 1796), who married the lawyer Saxe Bannister (1790&#150;1877); Lacon William (1797&#150;1871), who became a physician; Anne (<i>b</i>. 1800); Augusta (<i>b</i>. 1801); and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1804). After his wife's death from scarlet fever Lambe married in 1809 Sophia Ann (<i>c</i>.1772&#150;1815), daughter of Arthur Saunders, a physician; they had a daughter, Catherine (1810&#150;1860).<br>
<br>Following his marriage in 1794, Lambe gave up his fellowship at Cambridge and moved to Warwick, where he succeeded to the practice of a friend, Walter Landor (father of the poet Walter Savage Landor). Here he also became friendly with Samuel Parr and William Roughead, and he soon published his analyses of the Leamington spring water. The results of further chemical examination of these waters were published by him in the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the Philosophical Society of Manchester and formed the basis of several later books.<br>
<br>Lambe moved to London shortly after 1803, and became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 22 December 1804. He held both the censorship and Croonian lectureship on several occasions between 1806 and 1828, and he was Harveian orator in 1818. His London practice was neither very large nor remunerative. Lambe lived in Kentish Town, but kept a consulting room in 2 King's Road (later 14 Theobald's Road), Bedford Row, where he attended his patients three times a week. Many of them were poor people, from whom he would accept no fees. He also taught botany at the Aldersgate Street school of medicine, and was appointed physician to its dispensary in 1810.<br>
<br>Lambe's ill health led him to become a vegetarian at the age of forty-one. He also preferred to drink only distilled water. In 1813 he wrote that his only regret about such a regimen was that it had not been adopted much earlier in his life  (Wyndham, 9). He published <span class="italic">A medical and experimental enquiry into the origin, symptoms, and cure of constitutional diseases</span> (1805) and <span class="italic">Reports of the effects of a peculiar regimen on schirrhous tumours and cancerous ulcers</span> (1809). Lambe's ideas were supported by Shelley, with whom, along with Keats, he was acquainted. Later in life Lambe became somewhat rigid in his vegetarianism. It is said that &#145;he carried his convictions about vegetable diet to such an extent that it well-nigh became a religious belief and he its despotic high priest&#146;  (ibid., 23). One of Lambe's grandsons later recalled:<blockquote>the old man's sudden appearance at the garden gate while the family were breakfasting off (among other things), a ham, great commotion was caused, the ham being thrust into a cupboard and all stray pieces heaped on the plate of a carnivorous governess, who, being ignorant of the reason, looked on in bewildered amazement. (Wyndham, 24)</blockquote>Shelley's biographer, Jefferson Hogg, wrote that the last time he met Lambe &#145;he told me he had breakfasted on one cauliflower and was just about to dine on another&#146;  (Wyndham, 27).<br>
<br>Lambe retired from practice about 1840, and died at Henwood, Dilwyn, Herefordshire, on 11 June 1847. He was buried in the family vault in the churchyard of that parish.<br>
