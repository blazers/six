<span class="headword">Bannister,  John</span>  (1760&#150;1836), <span class="occ">actor</span>, born at Deptford on 12 May 1760, was the son of the actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1315/', "Charles Bannister (bap. 1741, d. 1804)")</script> and his wife Sarah. In 1777 he became a student at the Royal Academy, where he had for associate and friend the caricaturist Thomas Rowlandson, but his theatrical bent led to his abandoning painting and adopting the stage as a profession. Before leaving the academy he called on David Garrick, who, two years previously, in 1776, had retired from the stage. Bannister's account of an interview which, though formidable, was not wholly discouraging, is preserved in the diary used by his biographer, J. Adolphus.<br>
<br>Bannister's first appearance took place at the Haymarket, for his father's benefit on 27 August 1778, as Dick in Murphy's farce <span class="italic">The Apprentice</span>. He recited on this occasion a prologue by Garrick, and wound up his share in the entertainment by giving imitations of well-known actors. The following season (1778&#150;9) saw Bannister engaged with his father as a stock actor at Drury Lane; he made his d&eacute;but on 11 November 1778 in the character of Zaphna in James Miller's version of Voltaire's <span class="italic">Mahomet</span>, playing opposite Perdita Robinson. He had been coached intensively in this part by Garrick. He appeared, again in Voltaire, as Dorislas in a version by Aaron Hill of <span class="italic">M&eacute;rope</span>. In February 1779 at Covent Garden he played Achmet in Brown's tragedy <span class="italic">Barbarossa</span>. His only other appearance that season was for his benefit at Covent Garden in April 1779, when he acted the Prince of Wales in <span class="italic">1 Henry IV</span> and Shift in Samuel Foote's comedy <span class="italic">The Minor</span>, and gave his imitations. While Drury Lane was shut, Bannister joined Mattocks's company at Birmingham, playing such characters as Macduff, Orlando, Edgar Lothario in Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">The Fair Penitent</span>, and Simon Pure in Susannah Centlivre's <span class="italic">A Bold Stroke for a Wife</span>.<br>
<br>His first &#145;creation&#146; of importance appears to have been Don Ferolo Whiskerandos in Sheridan's <span class="italic">The Critic</span>, which was produced at Drury Lane in October 1779, and in which he later played Sir Fretful Plagiary. An unremarkable appearance in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> followed, and whatever capacity Bannister possessed in tragedy had shortly to yield to the growing fame of John Philip Kemble. Happier efforts were made in the comic roles of Charles Surface and Parolles.<br>
<br>On 26 January 1783 Bannister married Elizabeth Harper (1757&#150;1849) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53230/', "Bannister, Elizabeth")</script>], an actress and singer at the Haymarket; the first of their family of four daughters and two sons was baptized the following January. By 1787 Bannister's social and professional position was established. His repertory continued to increase, with Brisk in Congreve's <span class="italic">The Double Dealer</span>, Sir David Dunder in Colman's <span class="italic">Ways and Means</span>, Ben in Congreve's <span class="italic">Love for Love</span>, Brass in <span class="italic">The Confederacy</span>, Scrub in Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Beaux' Stratagem</span>, Trappanti in Cibber's <span class="italic">She Would and She Would Not</span>, and Speed in <span class="italic">The Two Gentlemen of Verona</span> among the parts that prepared the way for his conspicuous success as Sir Anthony Absolute and Tony Lumpkin, characters in which he was received with pleasure to the end of his career. He retained, in the height of his success, his taste for painting, and Rowlandson, George Morland, and Gainsborough were his close friends. From this time forward his career was an unbroken triumph. The principal comic parts in the old drama fell to him, and his acceptance of a role in a new piece was considered a favourable augury. Bob Acres in <span class="italic">The Rivals</span>, Job Thornbury in <span class="italic">John Bull</span>, Marplot in <span class="italic">The Busybody</span>, Dr Ollapod in <span class="italic">The Poor Gentleman</span>, and Dr Pangloss in <span class="italic">The Heir-at-Law</span> were among his greatest performances; Mercutio was the only comic character of importance that seemed outside his range. In 1802&#150;3 he succeeded Kemble as acting manager at Drury Lane.<br>
<br>In 1809 Bannister took a monologue entertainment with songs, entitled <span class="italic">Bannister's Budget</span>, on a tour of the provinces and Ireland; it opened in London in Lent 1810, and was a financial, popular, and critical success. On 1 June 1815 Bannister retired from the stage, at Drury Lane, playing Echo in Kenney's comedy <span class="italic">The World</span>, a character created by him and which afforded room for a display of his mimetic gifts, and Walter in Thomas Morton's <span class="italic">Children in the Wood</span>. His career had been connected with Drury Lane for thirty-seven years, but no less celebrated were his regular summer engagements at the Haymarket and his frequent and extensive provincial tours. He died at his house, 65 Gower Street, on 7 November 1836, at 2 a.m., and was buried on the 14th in the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields in a vault with his father.<br>
<br>An extremely sociable man and a practising Christian, Bannister counted aristocrats, painters, and writers among his friends, as well as members of his own profession; all acknowledged his charm, while his acting obtained the high praise of the acutest judges. Of the galaxy of comic actors which marked the close of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century, he was one of the brightest stars.<br>
