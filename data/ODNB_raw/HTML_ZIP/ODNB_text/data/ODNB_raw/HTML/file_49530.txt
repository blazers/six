<span class="headword">Simpson,  William Douglas</span>  (1896&#150;1968), <span class="occ">archaeologist and historian</span>, was born at 80 Hamilton Place, Aberdeen, on 2 August 1896, the younger son of Henry Fyfe Morland Simpson (1859?&#150;1920), rector of Aberdeen grammar school, and his wife, Jenny Fridericke Simpson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dohm (1866?&#150;1949). He was educated at the grammar school and at Aberdeen University, where his studies were interrupted by the First World War. Having been discharged from the army for medical reasons, he spent his war service on coast-watching duties and in work for the Ministry of National Service. He then completed his degree with first-class honours in history, being awarded the Caithness prize and Forbes gold medal.<br>
<br>For a year after graduation in 1919 Simpson was assistant to Charles Sanford Terry, professor of history, and then became lecturer in history at Aberdeen University. In 1926 he was appointed university librarian, a post he held until 1966. His interest in the archaeology of castles was already well developed, and over the next thirty years he directed excavations at Kildrummy, Coull, Kindrochit, Esslemont, Dundarg, and Finavon castles, and at the Doune of Invernochty. He published a succession of books, papers, and guides, including many for the office of works and its successors, on these sites and many others in Scotland, England, and Wales. For his book <span class="italic">The Castle of Kildrummy</span> (1923) the university awarded him the degree of DLitt.<br>
<br>Other books dealt with wider questions of archaeology and history. <span class="italic">The Province of Mar</span> (1943) and <span class="italic">The Earldom of Mar</span> (1949) pursued Simpson's studies of north-east Scotland. <span class="italic">The Castle of Bergen and the Bishop's Palace at Kirkwall</span> (1961), together with his edition of the proceedings of the Viking Congress held at Lerwick in 1950 (1954) and a series of papers on castles of the Teutonic knights in East Prussia, extended his interests further afield. He edited <span class="italic">The Fusion of 1860</span> (1963)&#151;the volume which commemorated the centenary of the union of King's and Marischal colleges, Aberdeen&#151;and as secretary of the Third Spalding Club supervised the publication of its numerous volumes. The Lincoln Record Society's <span class="italic">Building Accounts of Tattershall Castle</span> (1960) was published under remarkable difficulties, the manuscript being badly damaged by a monkey which made its way into the editor's house after escaping from a travelling circus. Of his numerous books intended for the general reader, the most widely known was <span class="italic">The Ancient Stones of Scotland</span> (1965).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Origins of Christianity in Aberdeenshire</span> (1925), <span class="italic">The Historical St Columba</span> (1927), <span class="italic">The Celtic Church in Scotland</span> (1935), and <span class="italic">St Ninian and the Origins of the Christian Church in Scotland</span> (1940) were regarded by Simpson as an important part of his work. His methodology, however, and the conclusions which he drew from the archaeological evidence, were criticized from the start, and later opinion appears to have agreed that the criticisms were well founded.<br>
<br>Many developments took place in Aberdeen University Library during the forty years in which Simpson was its librarian. Some of his far-sighted proposals were not accepted; even so strong a personality as Simpson had less influence in the university than certain members of his library committee, and he was never a member of senate. In his later years, as his health deteriorated, much of the library's administration and development was handled by others.<br>
<br>When Simpson began his work on Scottish history, the subject tended to be professionally neglected; he was therefore a pioneer. Much of the practical excavation of his sites was done by his faithful boy scouts; he himself was not a trained archaeologist. Some of his conclusions have not stood the test of time, for example those concerning &#145;bastard feudalism&#146; and the design of later medieval castles. His lasting achievement is to be found in his detailed studies of individual buildings, and the widespread interest in the archaeology and history of Scotland which he generated through his books and lectures. His enthusiasm, fluent delivery, and ebullient personality made him an immensely successful lecturer both in the lecture room and in the field. For many years his extramural classes were crowded with students of all ages and from all walks of life; his successors in the university library long continued to receive enquiries from Scottish exiles on topics of local history and archaeology.<br>
<br>Simpson married on 12 August 1935 Ellen Dorothy Mason (1901&#150;1984), a bank clerk of Dundee, daughter of Joseph Reed Mason, a house furnishing buyer, and Emily Annie Mason of Dundee. They had one daughter. Simpson was appointed OBE in 1954, and CBE in 1962. He was chairman of the Ancient Monuments Board for Scotland, a member of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland, and president of the Scottish History Society. For most of his life he was an enthusiastic scout and he was a lay reader of the Episcopal Church of Scotland. He died of a coronary thrombosis in King's College Library, Aberdeen, on 9 October 1968, and was buried in Springbank cemetery, Aberdeen, on 12 October.<br>
