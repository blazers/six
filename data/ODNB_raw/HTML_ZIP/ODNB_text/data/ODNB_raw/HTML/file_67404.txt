<span class="headword">Gibb,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1720?), <span class="occ">founder of the Sweet Singers or Gibbite sect</span>, was born and raised in Borrowstounness (modern day Bo'ness) in Linlithgowshire, Scotland. There he learned to sail, and was in time appointed to be the purser and master of the merchantman <i>The John</i>, which operated out of that port on regular trading voyages to the Low Countries. A strong opponent of the prelacy, Gibb was initially extremely useful to the ejected ministers of the Church of Scotland, ferrying secret correspondence and illegally printed pamphlets between the covenanter rebels and their exiled brethren in the Netherlands under the guise of conducting legitimate trading ventures on behalf of his wealthy patrons. It is entirely probable that during his frequent visits to the Low Countries he had contact with Dutch religious radicals and imbibed the Anabaptist doctrines which were so profoundly to affect the subsequent development of his own spirituality and to shape the conception of his own intensely personal, and idiosyncratic, theology. Certainly by the winter of 1680 his activities had come to the attention of the Scottish privy council, who were determined to seize both his person and his &#145;seditious books&#146;. However Gibb was warned of his impending arrest, and in November 1680 jumped ship shortly before his vessel returned to port. While he headed inland, <i>The John</i> was impounded and left to rot on the shore, to the dismay and the near ruin of his former employers who went to great pains to persuade the council that Gibb was only their &#145;servant&#146; and &#145;neither hath nor had [any] interest in the shipe&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 6.570, 571, 575).<br>
<br>Gibb now broke with Donald Cargill and the Society People, among whose ranks he had previously been numbered. He strongly believed that Cargill had broken his sacred bond of trust with the Scottish people upon his seeking the safety of a temporary exile in northern England, and moved quickly to assert his own authority over those conventicles left leaderless by this apparent desertion and by the death in action of Richard Cameron during the previous summer. Possessing a formidable charisma and a strong sexual magnetism Gibb, in the early months of 1681, built up a sizeable local following around the neighbourhood of Borrowstounness, and won over &#145;Twenty six Women and three Men&#146; who were regarded, even by his enemies within the covenanter movement, as being for &#145;the greater Part &hellip; serious, exercised, tender, zealous [and] gracious souls&#146;  (Walker, 17). This nucleus served as the foundation of a new sect, known variously as Gibbites, after their acknowledged leader, or as Sweet Singers on account of their tearful singing of <span class="roman">Psalms</span> 74, 79, 80, 83, and 117, paralleling the fate of <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> Israel with the sufferings of the Scottish church. In April 1681 the development of the sect took a wholly new and unexpected turn, as Gibb led his followers away from their homes and families in an utter rejection of private property and all worldly authority. One group went up into the Pentland hills to wait for the imminent delivery of God's judgment, in the form of fire and tempest, upon the sinful population and city of Edinburgh; while Gibb and his closest friends sought an urgent meeting with Cargill near Clydesdale, in an attempt to gain the support of that influential preacher for their cause.<br>
<br>However, no agreement could be reached between the two parties and the situation was made even worse when Gibb and his companion, David Jamie, drew pistols upon a group of distraught men who had journeyed to their camp in order to beg for the return of their estranged wives. With the breach between Gibb and Cargill now complete, he was vehemently denounced as the devil incarnate by all of those field preachers still active in the south-west and took refuge, along with his followers, in the wastelands between Lothian and Tweeddale. Removed from the major centres of population, the Sweet Singers implemented a strict regime of prayer, fasting, and mourning, with both sexes preaching extemporary sermons and refusing to do any manual labour on the grounds that work and all &#145;mechaniks&#146; were the very &#145;limbs of [the] AntiChrist&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 7.704). Having taken to styling himself as King Solomon and rechristening his followers with similar names, such as &#145;Isaac &hellip; Rheoboam, Deborah, Lidiah [and] the Queen of Sheba&#146;, drawn from the pages of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, Gibb also reiterated the excommunications and abjurations of King Charles II and the duke of York which had first been issued by Cameron and Cargill in the Sanquhar and Torwood declarations of the previous year  (ibid., 7.704&#150;5). Posing a clear threat to the established social and political order, troops were dispatched to effect Gibb's arrest, and at the beginning of May 1681 a troop of dragoons swooped upon his encampment at Woodhill Craigs, capturing him and all of his adherents without a struggle, and bringing the first period of his ministry to an abrupt and premature end. Brought to Edinburgh under guard, his followers were separated from one another, according to their gender. The women were incarcerated in the correction house, where several were bailed upon the intercession of their husbands and families, while the men were confined to the Tolbooth to await examination by the members of the Scottish privy council.<br>
<br>Although Gibb initially failed to impress his interrogators, his case did arouse the interest of James, duke of York, who had recently been appointed viceroy in Scotland. The duke was keen to exploit splits within the covenanter movement and, having convinced himself that the Sweet Singers presented no military threat to his regime, spoke of them as deserving a bedlam rather than a gallows. Indeed, Patrick Walker was to allege that Gibb had received substantial sums of money from the duke of York as bribes, and that as a result he dedicated a &#145;most blasphemous Paper&#146; to his new royal patron  (Walker, 22). While no copies of this publication appear to be extant, it does indeed seem as though Gibb's attitude towards the monarchy and temporal authority underwent a profound change, for he was set free from the Tolbooth on 2 August 1681, having renounced those &#145;disloyall principalls&#146; which he had once held  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 7.177).<br>
<br>Thereafter, Gibb's career and actions become far more erratic, and harder to chart owing to the overt prejudice of mainstream Scottish presbyterian writers, while his underlying motivations are almost entirely open to conjecture. The most likely explanation for his subsequent conduct is that, during his imprisonment, he had experienced some form of nervous breakdown which led him to wilder delusions and, finally, to an utter rejection of his belief in God. Travelling west with a band of followers dramatically reduced to just three men and two women, he now railed against both the metrical psalms and the <span class="roman">Bible</span> itself as being no more than human inventions, and consigned his own <span class="roman">Bible</span>&#151;along with those of his companions&#151;to the flames of a bonfire raised upon the borders of Airth and Stirling. Upon his re-arrest, Gibb was once again incarcerated in the Tolbooth at Edinburgh. However, his weekly cycle of fasting, followed by sudden and violent periods of bingeing, further weakened his powers of reason and did little to endear him to the other political prisoners held alongside him. Walker writes at length of his demented howlings and ravings, which disturbed his cell mates while they were at public worship and which provoked George Jackson, a Cameronian, to physically assault him and to dash his head repeatedly against the prison wall. It was feared that this attack had killed Gibb outright, but his powerful build and enormous physical strength&#151;which had previously earned him the nickname Meikle John&#151;saved him, though ever afterwards he assumed the aspect of a broken and cowed man, hiding away from his fellow prisoners and stuffing his mouth with rags in order to silence his involuntary cries. Sentenced to be transported to America, on 17 May 1684 he sailed across the Atlantic in a ship chartered by merchants from Edinburgh and New York colony. Several of Gibb's erstwhile followers, transported alongside him, later found well-paid employment in the colony and it is likely that he himself spent the rest of his life in New York even after his period of indentured service had come to an end. However, his zest for preaching and prophecy had not entirely left him, and he won a great reputation for his spiritual powers among the local Native American peoples, leading them in sacrifices and ritual celebrations. It is not known if he ever married, but one of his many female followers, Isobel Bon, was described as his constant companion. Given that Gibb styled himself as King Solomon it is conceivable that the woman known as the Queen of Sheba acted as his consort, and perhaps this particular follower was synonymous with Bon. Gibb was believed to have died in 1720 and, though universally excoriated by the overwhelming majority of Scots&#151;whether episcopalian or presbyterian&#151;the legacy of his short-lived sect and the persuasiveness of his message continued to reinforce those eighteenth-century sectaries, such as Arden Burnell and the Muggletonians, who championed the validity of personal revelation and held that they themselves had the power to bless or damn at will.<br>
