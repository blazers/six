<span class="headword">Davys,  George</span>  (1780&#150;1864), <span class="occ">bishop of Peterborough</span>, son of John Davys of Rempstone, Nottinghamshire, and his wife, Sophia, daughter of the Revd B. Wigley of Sawley, Derbyshire, was born at Loughborough, Leicestershire, on 1 October 1780. In 1799 he entered as a sizar at Christ's College, Cambridge, and came out tenth wrangler in 1803. He was elected a fellow of his college in 1806, and in the same year proceeded MA, and became curate, first of Littlebury, Essex, then of Chesterford to 1817, and afterwards of Swaffham Priory. He vacated his fellowship in 1814 on his marriage to Marianne (1789&#150;1858), daughter of the Revd Edmund Mapletoft, rector of Anstye, Hertfordshire. In 1811 he was presented on his own petition to the small vicarage of Willoughby on the Wolds, Lincolnshire, which he held until 1829.<br>
<br>Davys produced a number of theological works for the instruction of a rustic readership in the principal tenets of the established church. A ninth edition of his <span class="italic">Village Conversations on the Liturgy of the Church of England</span> (1820) was called for in 1831, while his <span class="italic">Village Conversations on the Principal Offices of the Church</span> (1824) reached a second edition in 1849. His exposition of the virtues of thrift, <span class="italic">On Savings' Banks</span> (1824), also adopted the didactic conversational form, in which the prudent Will Wise urged upon his feckless friend Ralph Ragged the benefits of temperance and regular saving.<br>
<br>Davys's simple piety commended him to the duchess of Kent, who in 1827 appointed him tutor to the Princess Victoria, the future queen. Resident at Kensington Palace, he remained the princess's principal master until her accession in 1837, charged particularly with her religious education within the Church of England. She found him a rather monotonous and soporific preacher. In April 1829 he was presented by the crown to the rectory of Allhallows-on-the-Wall, London, which he continued to hold until his elevation to the episcopal bench. He was appointed dean of Chester on 10 January 1831, and at the following commencement at Cambridge was created DD.<br>
<br>On 7 May 1839 Davys was advanced to the bishopric of Peterborough on the recommendation of Lord Melbourne, who was tardy in honouring the custom that the tutor to the reigning sovereign should be raised to the episcopate. Davys's lack of distinction and likely tory sympathies told against him, and Melbourne's reluctance to prefer him was overcome only by pressure from the press and the reflection that the queen would thereby be saved the necessity of paying him a pension. As a bishop he took no active part either in politics or religious controversy, though he was identified as a member of the evangelical wing of the church. He was considered to be fair and liberal towards all religious creeds in his diocese, but was noticed to show a preference towards his relations when making appointments to canonries. Publications of an instructive kind continued to flow from his pen, including <span class="italic">Letters between a Father and his Son on the Roman History</span> (1848) and <span class="italic">A Plain and Short History of England, for Children</span> (13th edn, 1859) which also used the epistolary device. He contributed anonymously to the <span class="italic">Cottagers' Monthly Visitor</span> and the <span class="italic">National School Magazine</span>. Davys died of bronchitis at the palace, Peterborough, on 18 April 1864, and was buried in the graveyard of the cathedral on 23 April. He was survived by two sons, both clergymen, his eldest son and heir having died in 1836 from the effects of an accident while playing cricket. Davys's career received an ambiguous tribute in <span class="italic">The Times</span> (19 April 1864, 14): &#145;His ambition through life was rather to be good than great. Higher praise it is impossible to bestow.&#146;<br>
