<span class="headword">Anderson,  David</span>  (1751&#150;1825), <span class="occ">East India Company servant</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 10 February 1751, the second of the eight children of David Anderson (1707&#150;1786), writer to the signet, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1781), daughter of John Mitchelson of Middleton, Edinburghshire.<br>
<br>After attending the high school in Edinburgh, Anderson secured a writership in the East India Company in 1766, arriving in India in July 1767. He was employed for three years in Calcutta before moving to Murshidabad, where the nawab of Bengal and his court resided. The appointment of Warren Hastings as governor of Bengal in 1772 with instructions to reform the administration and to take over the management of the revenues from the nawab's officials found Anderson well placed to catch the governor's eye. The <i>diwan</i>, the office for revenue administration, was transferred from Murshidabad to Calcutta, but Hastings also assumed responsibility for the criminal and police administration, the <i>nizamat</i>. As assistant to the resident at Murshidabad, Anderson was directly concerned in this reorganization; in particular he was commissioned by Hastings to offer Muhammad Reza Khan, the nawab's deposed chief minister, continuance in offices other than the management of the nawab's household if he promised not to intrigue against Hastings, an offer that was rejected. By 1776 Anderson was fourth in council at Murshidabad but about to become one of Hastings's most trusted agents.<br>
<br>The revenue settlement of 1772 was due to expire in 1777 and Hastings, by now governor-general, convinced that the information available to the supreme council on revenue matters was nowhere near adequate for it to do its job properly, set up a commission in November 1776 to collect and present statistics and other data relating to land values in order to provide the raw material for a new settlement. The business of the commission, or <i>amini</i> office as it was termed, was co-ordinated by three company officials chosen by Hastings, of whom Anderson was one. The <i>amini</i> scheme was opposed by General Clavering and Philip Francis in the supreme council and by their followers in the country, and Anderson's selection for the commission was an indication of the confidence that Hastings had come to repose in him. The commission presented its report in March 1778, in which year Anderson was named a supernumerary member of council at Patna.<br>
<br>Now acknowledged as a revenue expert, Anderson became president of the Calcutta revenue committee in 1781. Its purpose was to act as a focal point for the entire administration of the revenue, replacing the dispersed provincial councils. However, Anderson was called away from revenue matters to undertake a diplomatic mission to the Marathas, although during his absence he drew a salary for his original office in addition to his new one. He was dispatched with plenipotentiary powers to represent Hastings at the court of Mahadji Sindhia, one of the principal Maratha leaders, to seek an end to the war that had dragged on since 1775. The component states in the Maratha confederacy were diverse in their aims, disunited, and erratic. With Sindhia as intermediary, who himself had difficulty in reconciling the various Maratha factions, Anderson, after months of negotiation punctuated by long periods of waiting, secured the treaty of Salbai in May 1782 which ended the First Anglo-Maratha War. Even then the treaty was not finally ratified until the following year. Hastings's regard for Anderson is illustrated in his correspondence. On 15 March 1782 he wrote to Anderson that &#145;our confidence in you &hellip; is unbounded&#146;  (Gleig, 2.532), while on 28 March 1783 he informed the court of directors that the treaty had been gained by &#145;the peculiar talents and wariness of Mr. David Anderson&#146;  (ibid., 3.84).<br>
<br>Anderson returned to Britain with Hastings in the <i>Berrington</i>. He landed at Plymouth on 13 June 1785 and reached Edinburgh nine days later, where he was made a freeman of the city. At the age of thirty-four he settled down to pass the next forty years as a Scottish country gentleman. He was able to do so thanks to the proceeds of private financial and trading ventures while in India, abetted latterly by Hastings's generosity regarding his emoluments. Aspirations to &#145;a small estate in a pleasant part of Scotland&#146; expressed in a letter to his father  (11 Jan 1778, BL, Add. MS 45438, fol. 141) were amply realized in 1782, when Anderson purchased St Germains, near Tranent and some 10 miles north-east of Edinburgh. On the point of leaving India, in a letter to his brother James, he reckoned that &#145;my whole Fortune is about &pound;50,000&#146;  (4 Feb 1785, BL, Add. MS 45437, fol. 17). Anderson married Christian (<i>d</i>. 1824), the daughter of Robert Findlay of Drummore, on 14 August 1788. They had three sons, one of whom was named after Hastings, and two daughters. Anderson was also the father of at least one natural child born in India: a daughter christened Mary at Monghyr on 8 April 1775.<br>
<br>As an executor of Hastings's policies and as a particular friend, Anderson was drawn into the impeachment proceedings. He contributed to Hastings's speech at the bar of the house and dealt coolly with hostile questioning before a Commons committee of the whole house in March 1787. He gave evidence in two appearances at Hastings's trial in May 1790. The two exchanged visits and corresponded regularly until Hastings's death in 1818.<br>
<br>Anderson's portrait, painted by Sir Henry Raeburn in 1790, shows a slender, well-preserved, earnest man of about forty. His uneventful retirement was briefly disturbed in 1797 when, as deputy lieutenant of East Lothian, he took a small part in suppressing an anti-militia riot in Tranent. Anderson died at St Germains on 2 August 1825.<br>
