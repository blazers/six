<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Seyer,  Samuel</span>  (1757&#150;1831), <span class="occ">antiquary and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Bristol, the son of the Revd Samuel Seyer (1719?&#150;1776) and his wife, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1809). His father was master of Bristol grammar school and in 1764 became rector of St Michael's, Bristol. Seyer entered Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in 1772, and graduated BA in 1776 and MA in 1780. He was ordained in 1780 and became curate of Westbury-on-Trym in south Gloucestershire. On 18 April 1781 he married Elizabeth Turner (<i>d</i>. 1819), of Wraxall, Somerset. He became master of the Royal Fort School in Bristol in 1790, where he acquired a reputation for harsh discipline. From 1790 to 1813 he lived in the gatehouse of the Royal Fort, with his wife and their two daughters, Sybilla and Mary. In 1813 he became perpetual curate of Holy Trinity, Horfield, near Bristol. By this time he had already purchased several small properties in Bristol, among them an inn called the Blue Bell, and had invested in various Bristol companies including Bristol Dock Company, Bristol and Clifton Oil Gas Company, and the New Crown Fire Office. A surviving notebook also contains references to financial dealings in Jamaica. In 1813 he purchased a large house in the recently built Berkeley Square, Clifton, where he lived for the rest of his life. He purchased the advowson of Filton in south Gloucestershire in 1824 and became rector there, resigning the living of Horfield in 1825. His wife, Elizabeth, died in 1819 and was buried at nearby Shirehampton where their unmarried daughter, Mary, lived. The elder daughter, Sybilla, had married the Revd Abel London and lived at Totteridge, Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Seyer devoted himself to the study of Bristol history, following the example of his friend William Barrett, the Bristol surgeon, whose <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of Bristol</span> was published in 1789. Seyer's work is distinguished by his detailed study of the available documentary sources. In 1812 he published <span class="italic">Charters and Letters Patent Granted to the Town and City of Bristol</span>, which provides an English translation of the Latin originals. Bristol city councillors, fearing that the publication of their records would provoke a challenge to some of their privileges and town dues, refused to grant him access to the charters in Bristol and he was obliged to work from transcripts in the Bodleian Library.<br>
<br>In 1821 and 1823 Seyer published the two volumes of his <span class="italic">Memoirs, Historical and Topographical, of Bristol and its Neighbourhood</span>, with illustrations by Edward Blore. For this work Seyer was allowed unrestricted access to the city records, and throughout the two volumes he based his statements firmly on original sources which he quoted accurately and at length. This was by far the most detailed and reliable history of Bristol which had been published, and it remains a rich source of reliable information. In addition to his historical publications he also published <span class="italic">The Principles of Christianity</span> (1796), <span class="italic">The Syntax of Latin Verbs</span> (1798), <span class="italic">Observations on the Causes of Clerical Non-Residence</span> (1808), <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Modern Use of the Latin Language</span> (1808), and occasional sermons. Seyer died at his home on 25 August 1831 and was buried beside his wife at Shirehampton.<br>
