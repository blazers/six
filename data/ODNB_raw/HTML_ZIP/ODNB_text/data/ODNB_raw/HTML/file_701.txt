<span class="headword">Arrowsmith,  John</span>  (1790&#150;1873), <span class="occ">cartographer and map publisher</span>, was born on 23 April 1790 on a farm in Winston, co. Durham, the son of Thomas Arrowsmith of an old-established family. With limited education, he arrived in London on 14 February 1810 where he learnt map making, engraving, and printing under his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/698/', "Aaron Arrowsmith the elder")</script>. He set up in business on his own account about 1824 at 33 East Street, Red Lion Square, moving later the same year to 35 Essex Street, Strand. He established his reputation with his <span class="italic">London Atlas</span> (1834) in fifty plates before buying at auction in December 1839 the plates, manuscripts, and copyrights of the business of his cousins Aaron and Samuel, and their house at 10 Soho Square. His cartographic skills outstripped those of his cousins and rivalled those of his uncle. In 1830 he was a founder fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and he took a particular interest in the exploration and discovery of the time. He knew many explorers and was responsible for converting their rough sketch maps and surveys into accurate maps on which was consolidated all the available information. The explorers showed their appreciation of his work by naming after him mountains, plains, and lakes in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. At least 181 of his maps appeared in the Royal Geographical Society's publications and he persuaded the society to use copper-engraving instead of the cheaper but inferior lithography; this was typical of his search for perfection in both the content and presentation of his maps. His high standards were followed, under his influence, by the cartographers who took over his work for the society. Arrowsmith was a member of the council of the Royal Geographical Society from 1851 to 1868 and for his contributions to geography he was awarded the society's patron's medal in 1862, although he was too shy to attend the meeting at which it was awarded. He retired from business in 1861 to his house at 35 Hereford Square, South Kensington, from where he continued to work&#151;in particular to help his friend David Livingstone, the explorer and missionary&#151;until his death, at home, on 2 May 1873. In July 1874 the assets of the Arrowsmith firm were sold at auction to Edward Stanford, who was then rising to pre-eminence in the map trade, but they were destroyed by bombing in the Second World War. Arrowsmith never married. It was said that he laboured over his maps &#145;quite irrespective of any pecuniary profit&#146;  (Markham, 94) and this is probably true of his maps of newly explored areas whose discoverers were in many instances personal friends. None the less, after a frugal life he left a substantial fortune settled at &pound;22,000 after suits in chancery.<br>
