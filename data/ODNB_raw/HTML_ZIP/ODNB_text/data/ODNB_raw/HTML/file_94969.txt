<span class="headword">Taylor,  John Eldred</span>  (<em>c.</em>1880&#150;1924), <span class="occ">journalist and pan-Africanist</span>, was born in Sierra Leone, the son of John Eldred Taylor (<i>d</i>. 1892), an assistant colonial chaplain. His grandfather had been active with the Church Missionary Society and Taylor was born into a respected Krio family. Such English-speaking Africans took leading roles in west African commerce and culture, forging links with the British and Britain, where many&#151;possibly including Taylor&#151;received some or all of their education. The <span class="italic">Sierra Leone Weekly News</span> reported in 1905 that Taylor was the proprietor of a laundry and the author of a report into the possibilities for jute growing in the colony, and in 1908 that he was managing director of Sierra Leone Deep Sea Fishing and Industries Ltd, which brought a steam trawler to the colony in 1912. He ceased involvement in the fishing enterprise and (in the Gold Coast) the Volta River Coconut and Produce Co. Ltd in 1913, the year his wife, Adeline Rosamund, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Farmer (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1881), died.<br>
<br>Taylor's income from his business dealings enabled him to settle in London, where in 1911 he protested to the Colonial Office over the authorities' attitude to the <span class="italic">Nigerian Times</span>. The African-edited press of British west Africa informed resident and travelling Africans of local events and reported matters their editors believed to deserve action, and in their fight for colonial justice black residents and white radicals in Britain were useful contacts. But Taylor also saw the need for a London-based African publication. With the actor and author Dus&eacute; Mohamed Ali he decided to revive the nineteenth-century London monthly the <span class="italic">African Times</span>, and in July 1912 the first issue of the <span class="italic">African Times and Orient Review</span> was published. Taylor had been ousted by the time the August issue appeared, when more financially secure west Africans owned the venture. Nevertheless Taylor remained active in black affairs in London, for instance attending the funeral in September 1912 of the composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor (whose father was from Sierra Leone), along with the Trinidad-born John Alcindor and the South African educator Davidson Jabavu.<br>
<br>In 1914 Taylor established the <span class="italic">African Telegraph</span>, again published in London. In December 1918 he published an article that brought a charge of libel. The <span class="italic">African Telegraph</span> reported that in July 1914, in Northern Nigeria, Joseph Fitzpatrick, the district officer in charge of Bauchi, had ordered the public flogging of two naked women. The <span class="italic">Gold Coast Leader</span> had published details but it was Taylor's London reprint which led Fitzpatrick (with official support) to sue. Taylor's defence was that he had reported the truth, and he mentioned other flogging incidents in Nigeria. However, the legal system in Northern Nigeria was officially dispensed through &#145;native courts&#146; with men like Fitzpatrick acting as guides, theoretically advising independent Africans whose positions were within the structures of the traditional social system. The fact that he had chased and caught the two women and handed them to the local African court, and that (as the proconsul, Sir Frederick Lugard, testified in court) he had both the authority and duty to influence the African court did not prove that Fitzpatrick had &#145;ordered&#146; the flogging. The London jury's decision led to Taylor being fined &pound;400; but it added that the flogging of women should cease.<br>
<br>Though Taylor had lost the case, he was seen as a hero by black people in Britain and Africa, and the case (and the publicity surrounding it) enabled Taylor and his fellow African journalists to spread information on the realities of British rule in west Africa. Through <span class="italic">Crisis</span> (the monthly publication of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) news of his actions reached thousands in America. His fame extended also to South Africa, for Taylor was with a South African &#145;native&#146; delegation to the prime minister, Lloyd George, in November 1919. That year Taylor posed in the garden of his London home (23 Highbury Crescent) with eighteen other male Sierra Leoneans for a photograph that was published in the <span class="italic">African Telegraph</span>; the group included teachers, businessmen, churchmen, doctors, an army officer, journalists, and a dentist. Taylor participated in other political and social events in Britain, including the pan-African congress of 1921, led by the editor of <span class="italic">Crisis</span>, W. E. B. Du Bois, and John Alcindor. He died on 7 December 1924 at his home in Highbury Crescent. His affairs were left with the merchant Samuel Adole Hughes, who also appeared in the photograph of 1919 and at Coleridge-Taylor's funeral.<br>
