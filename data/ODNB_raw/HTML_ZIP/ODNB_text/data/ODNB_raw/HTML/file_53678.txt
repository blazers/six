<span class="headword">Dawson,  Agnes</span>  (1873&#150;1953), <span class="occ">feminist and headteacher</span>, was born on 7 March 1873 at 121 East Surrey Grove, Peckham, London, the daughter of Isaac Dawson, a journeyman carpenter and later master builder, and his wife, Sarah, formerly Burford. On leaving elementary school in Peckham she became a pupil teacher and then trained at Saffron Walden College. She taught first at a school for &#145;mentally defective&#146; children in east London and then at the John Ruskin School for Physically Disabled Children in Walworth. In 1913 she became headteacher of St Paul's Road infants' school in east London, transferring to Crawford Street infants' school in Camberwell in 1917. She was an enthusiastic supporter of Montessori active education for young children. She called for nursery schools to be built wherever there was a demand to assist working-class women  (A. Dawson, <span class="italic">Nursery Schools</span>, n.d.). She helped establish the Parents' National Educational Union to involve parents in educational matters.<br>
<br>Agnes Dawson was active in the National Federation of Women Teachers (NFWT), a pressure group inside the National Union of Teachers (NUT) before the First World War. Within the NUT she campaigned for the union to support women's suffrage and equal pay, and to oppose mixed elementary schools, since women would be denied status and promotion in male-dominated mixed schools. She was a member of the London Teachers' Association general committee and a regular delegate to the NUT conference. By 1912 she was vice-president of the East Lambeth NUT Association and a member of the London Teachers' Association women's subcommittee and education committee. She stood for the national executive of the NUT unsuccessfully in 1916 and 1917. In 1912 she became the first president of the Women Teachers' Franchise Union. She was a constitutional suffragist, and stated that the only militant act she ever undertook was to sit up all night at a friend's house during census night 1911  (Dawson, &#145;President, 1919&#146;, 3).<br>
<br>Agnes was a member of the central council of the National Federation (later Union) of Women Teachers from 1914 to 1937. She was president of the NFWT in 1919 and helped lead the campaign for the federation to leave the NUT and become an autonomous union, the National Union of Women Teachers. Although a Labour Party member she dissuaded the central council of the NFWT from affiliating, believing that women in the Labour Party would be &#145;swamped&#146;  (Minutes of the central council of the NFWT, 15 Jan 1921). In 1925 she resigned her teaching post and stood successfully for the London county council (LCC) as a Labour Party candidate for North Camberwell. She undertook this post full-time, sustained by money from National Union of Women Teachers' members. She had a difficult time on the LCC, receiving little support from men who were supposed to be representing education  (Miss Froud to Miss Turner, 7 May 1925, cited in Kean, 93). She served on the management committee of nursery schools, the special services subcommittee, and the teaching subcommittee of the education committee. She became senior whip of the Labour group, and in 1932 deputy chair of the council. When Labour gained control of the council for the first time in 1934 Agnes became chair of the powerful finance and general purposes subcommittee. After much campaigning she persuaded Herbert Morrison to remove the marriage bar on women teachers in 1935.<br>
<br>In 1937 Agnes left her advisory post with the National Union of Women Teachers, resigned as a joint trustee of the union, and did not stand again for the LCC. She retired to Newport, Essex, where she continued public work as a JP and stood unsuccessfully in 1946 for the parish council. From 1925 she lived with Anne Munns, a former teacher at Crawford Street School, whom she called her &#145;pal and partner&#146;, until Anne's death in 1952  (Dawson to Muriel Pierotti, 13 Dec 1952, National Union of Women Teachers archive, box 112, file 81). She was nevertheless critical of a school atmosphere dominated by celibate teachers  ([A. Dawson], &#145;Married women teachers&#146;, <span class="italic">Times Educational Supplement</span>, 20 July 1935, 257), and this was reflected in her sustained campaign against the marriage bar for women teachers. As a founder member of the NFWT she was a pioneer who evoked not only the admiration but the affection of many people  (M. Pierotti to Mrs Tidswell, 28 April 1953, NUWT archive, box 112, file 81). Agnes Dawson died at her home, The Hut, Wicken Road, Newport, Essex, on 20 April 1953, and was cremated at Camberwell.<br>
