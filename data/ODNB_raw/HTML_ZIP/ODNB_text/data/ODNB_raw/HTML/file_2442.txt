<span class="headword">Bird,  Charles Smith</span>  (1795&#150;1862), <span class="occ">theological writer</span>, was the last but one of six children, born in Union Street, Liverpool, on 28 May 1795, the son of Charles Smith Bird, a West Indian merchant. His father was strongly evangelical to the point of forbidding his children to read Shakespeare. After attending several private schools, Bird was articled to a firm of conveyancing solicitors at Liverpool in 1812. His leisure time was spent at the Athenaeum reading-room in the study of theology. He returned to school at Dr Davies's, of Macclesfield, in 1815, and from there went to Trinity College, Cambridge, matriculating in 1816. As an undergraduate, he chose only fellow Christians as companions, and he was, throughout his adult life, a strong protestant. He became a scholar of Trinity in 1818, was third wrangler in 1820, and elected a fellow of his college.<br>
<br>Bird was then ordained and became curate of Burghfield, 6 miles from Reading. He took a house at Culverlands, near Burghfield, in 1823. He added to his income by taking pupils, a practice he continued for twenty years. One of them was T. B. Macaulay. On 24 June 1823 he married Margaret Wrangham, of Bowdon, Cheshire. He now frequently sent contributions to the <span class="italic">Christian Observer</span>. It was against the Irish educational measures that he wrote his &#145;Call to the protestants of England&#146;, later published with his poems. In 1839 Bird edited a strongly protestant monthly periodical, the <span class="italic">Reading Church Guardian</span>; the publication languished for a year and then died. In 1840 Bird became a sort of Sunday curate to a Mr Briscoe at Sulhamstead. Having given up his house at Burghfield, he was glad to accept the curacy of Fawley, some 3 miles from Henley-on-Thames.<br>
<br>In 1843 Bird became vicar of Gainsborough, to which was attached a prebendal stall of Lincoln. In this old-fashioned market town Bird passed many happy years. His course of life was regular and tranquil. Occasionally he lectured at the Gainsborough Literary and Mechanics' Institute on natural history, English literature, and other subjects of interest. In the summer of 1844 he went to Scotland, and in the next year preached before Cambridge University four sermons on the parable of the sower. About this time the proposal for the admission of Jews into parliament aroused Bird's indignation. His &#145;Call to Britain to remember the fate of Jerusalem&#146;, one of his longer poems, may be read with interest. In 1849 cholera ravaged Gainsborough, and Bird assiduously and bravely administered to the wants of the sufferers.<br>
<br>In 1852 Bird himself suffered a severe illness. In 1859 he was appointed chancellor of the cathedral of Lincoln, and left Gainsborough. He died at the chancery, aged sixty-seven, on 9 November 1862, his wife surviving him. Friends at Gainsborough decorated the church with a painted window in his memory. He was buried in the country churchyard of Riseholme.<br>
<br>Bird was an ardent entomologist, and had managed to satisfy himself that insects were almost, if not entirely, devoid of feeling; yet he would not allow any to be killed by his children until he was convinced of their rarity. He became a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1828. There is an article of his in the <span class="italic">Entomological Magazine</span> for August 1833, and the Liverpool feather-horned <i>Tinea</i>, or <i>Lepidocera Birdella</i>, was honoured by John Curtis with his name.<br>
<br>Bird published many theological pamphlets, often attacking Tractarianism and defending the Reformation. He was cautious about the revival of convocation. He also published poems and left an autobiography, edited by his son, the Revd Claude Smith Bird.<br>
