</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kerrich,  Thomas</span>  (1748&#150;1828), <span class="occ">artist and antiquary</span>, was born at the vicarage, Dersingham, Norfolk, on 4 February 1748, the only son of Samuel Kerrich (1696&#150;1768), vicar of Dersingham and rector of Wolferton and West Newton, Norfolk, and his second wife, Barbara (1706&#150;1762), elder daughter of Matthew Postlethwayte, archdeacon of Norwich. Educated at Dersingham school, he soon demonstrated his precocious artistic talents. In 1766, following in his father's footsteps, he had begun a series of studies of the early fourteenth-century knight's effigy in his father's church of Banham, carefully recording evidence of colour and patterning on the monument. His parents had applied to William Hogarth for advice but he, in praising a &#145;pretty performance&#146;, dissuaded them from letting their son take up art for a living on the grounds that the profession was overcrowded. Accordingly Kerrich was educated at Magdalene College, Cambridge, whence he graduated BA in 1771 as second senior optime. He was elected to a Wort's travelling scholarship and set out for a four-year tour of the continent in the company of his pupil, Daniel Pettiward, of Trinity College, Cambridge. Throughout his grand tour Kerrich drew medieval monuments. He travelled first to the Netherlands where he fell in love with the work of Rubens and Heemskerk. He was awarded a silver medal for his drawing by the Academy of Painting at Antwerp. He travelled to France, where he spent much of 1772&#150;3 in Paris. Either on this visit, or on his next visit in 1784, he drew in Le Mans, in Cambrai, and the monument to Philippe le Hardi then still reposing in the Chartreuse at Dijon. He spent a year in Rome where he drew classical antiquities as well recording the monuments of medieval knights in Modena, Milan, Siena, Florence, Pisa, Lucca, Bologna, and Civita Castellana; he also gained a deep understanding of Italian medieval architecture.<br>
<br>By 1775 Kerrich had returned to Cambridge where he gained his MA and was elected a fellow of Magdalene. In spite of William Cole's attempt to persuade him to become a portrait painter Kerrich entered the Church of England and was ordained priest at Peterborough on 20 May 1784. He returned to France that year where he gained access to the Cabinet des Dessins and recorded medieval tombs later destroyed in the Revolution. From 1789 to 1796 he served as president of Magdalene, then dominated by the evangelical party. Kerrich was no friend to the evangelicals, whose influence waned during his presidency. In 1793 he acted as taxor of the university and in 1796 he resigned as president. Two years later, on 13 September 1798, he married Sophia (1762&#150;1835), the fourth daughter of the Cambridge physician Richard Hayles, at St Botolph's, Cambridge. They had one son, Richard (1801&#150;1872), and two daughters, the younger of whom, Frances Margaretta, married the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12504/', "Revd Charles Henry Hartshorne")</script>, an antiquary. In 1798 Kerrich became a prebendary of Lincoln Cathedral and in 1812 of Wells.<br>
<br>On 21 September 1797 Kerrich became Cambridge's protobibliothecarius and in the same year was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. His record as principal librarian of the university has not always been admired. He inherited a position where the problems of copyright were largely resolved and where four cataloguers had been recently appointed. A proper author and subject catalogue was put in hand in 1818. Edward Clarke was a sympathetic sub-librarian and under his influence Kerrich concentrated on acquiring, like his predecessor Richard Farmer, older European publications to complement works of art then in the library.<br>
<br>Kerrich, who was a keen but discerning collector, was involved in many of the great projects of the infant discipline of art history: Horace Walpole's and James Essex's outline for a history of English architecture; Richard Gough's <span class="italic">Sepulchral Monuments</span>; William Ottley's proposed history of early English painting; John Boydell's Shakspeare Gallery; Sir John Fenn's edition of the Paston letters, which he illustrated with his own lithographs of his portraits; and Sir William Musgrave's undertaking to acquire a complete list of all the pictures in country houses. A skilled and diligent recorder of ancient monuments, he was admired by Charles Stothard, who attributed his achievements to Kerrich's guidance.<br>
<br>Kerrich published four scholarly papers on Gothic buildings and monuments in <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, which were accompanied by his own illustrations. The last of these, &#145;Observations on the use of the mysterious figure called Vesica Piscis in the architecture of the Middle Ages, and in Gothic architecture&#146;, expresses a correct interpretation of the proportions of the ground-plan of Old St Peter's, Rome, although it did not convince all its readers at the time. Kerrich's <span class="italic">Catalogue of the prints which have been engraved after Martin Heemskerk, or, rather, An essay towards such a catalogue</span>, which was published posthumously in 1829, stands today as the best study of its subject. It is disputed whether he or Robert Masters was the author of an anonymous &#145;Catalogue of portraits in Cambridge colleges&#146; printed about 1790. William Musgrave's copy, in the British Library, is inscribed in his hand &#145;Masters&#146;, yet most scholars believe it to be Kerrich's work. His own copy is heavily annotated.<br>
<br>Kerrich saw himself as unpopular but he was a friend to most of the antiquaries and artists of his time. He knew well John Flaxman, Joseph Nollekens, Henry Fuseli, Francis Douce, Samuel Lysons, and many of his father's generation, such as Thomas Martin of Palgrave. In 1778 he exchanged portrait prints with Horace Walpole. The brothers Facius engraved Kerrich's portrait drawings of numerous contemporaries. Kerrich was painted in turn in 1815 by Henry Perronet Briggs at the behest of his close friend, Edward Balme. In 1823 he became coheir, with Francis Douce, of the bulk of Nollekens's estate.<br>
<br>Kerrich died at his house in Free School Lane, Cambridge, on 10 May 1828 and was buried in the chancel of Dersingham church. To the university he gave the twelfth-century leper chapel at Barnwell, near Cambridge, which he had bought and restored in 1816. To the university library he gave the portrait of the Lucasian professor, Nicholas Saunderson, by John Vanderbank, and to the Society of Antiquaries he bequeathed his remarkable collection of fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century English and European paintings. After his son's death the Fitzwilliam Museum acquired the best of his sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Netherlandish pictures, notably Rubens's sketches for a set of tapestries depicting the Triumph of the Eucharist, commissioned in 1623 by the Infanta Isabella for the convent of Descalzas Reales in Madrid, and Rubens's design for a title-page, published in 1641.<br>
