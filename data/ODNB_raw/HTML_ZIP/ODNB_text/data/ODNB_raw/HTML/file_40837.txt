<span class="headword">Montagu,  Lilian Helen <span class="st"> [Lily]</span></span>  (1873&#150;1963), <span class="occ">feminist and social worker</span>, was born at 96 Lancaster Gate, London, on 22 December 1873, the sixth of the ten children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35076/', "Samuel Montagu, first Baron Swaythling (1832&#150;1911)")</script>, and his wife, Ellen Cohen (1848&#150;1919). Her father, Liberal MP for Whitechapel (1885&#150;1900), was a staunchly Orthodox Jew, uncompromising in his beliefs and in his religious practices, which he expected all members of his household to follow without question. The oppressive atmosphere that this engendered reacted upon his children in different ways. Louis, his eldest son, inherited his title but not his religious beliefs, while <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35074/', "Edwin Montagu")</script>, as a member of Lloyd George's wartime cabinet, did his best to sabotage the Zionist movement. Lily, as she was known, was without doubt the most spiritual and religious of all Samuel's offspring: her reaction took the form of a rebellion against what she perceived to be her father's callous disregard of and contempt for those Jews who were not as religious as him. &#145;My father&#146;, she recalled in a speech in 1950, &#145;saw all around him the lax Jews, and considered them as dead leaves &hellip; I began to worry about the dead leaves&#146;  (Alderman, 202). Her sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53683/', "Henrietta Franklin")</script> was of a like mind.<br>
<br>Lilian Montagu was privately educated. At the age of fifteen she appears to have suffered a mental crisis, from which she emerged convinced that her destiny was to minister to her fellow Jews. Within Jewish Orthodoxy it is not possible for a Jewess to become a rabbi (that is the religious leader of a congregation). Montagu turned instead to social work in the Jewish East End of London; in 1893 she established the West Central Jewish Girls' Club as a place where young Jewish girls from the East End could meet in a friendly and supportive girls-only atmosphere. Meanwhile, at the fashionable New West End Synagogue she began conducting a children's service based upon an English liturgy. Now in her mid-twenties, this excessively plain, nominally Orthodox Jewess was drawn to the personality and the pronouncements of the handsome Claude Goldsmid Montefiore, the gentleman scholar who was in the process of inventing a new form of Judaism, denationalized and devoid of ritual; on 1 February 1896 Montefiore proclaimed the tenets of Liberal Judaism from the pulpit of the West London Reform Synagogue. In the January 1899 issue of the <span class="italic">Jewish Quarterly Review</span> (of which Montefiore was co-editor), Montagu published an essay condemning the &#145;materialism and spiritual lethargy&#146; into which Anglo-Jewry had lapsed, and calling for a new form of Judaism in which &#145;all that was valuable and lovely in the ancient faith&#146; would be preserved, but in &#145;forms acceptable to emancipated minds&#146;  (Alderman, 204).<br>
<br>It is clear that Montagu had formed an emotional attachment to Montefiore (then a widower); it is equally clear that this affection was not reciprocated. Montagu spent the better part of the next three years persuading Claude to agree to become president of the Jewish Religious Union (JRU), established on her initiative in February 1902 as a vehicle for energizing debate about the future of Jewish Orthodoxy in Britain. Montagu's amorous advances were rebuffed (Montefiore married his first wife's former tutor at Girton College, Cambridge). But Montefiore agreed to accept the headship of the JRU, with Lily as one of its vice-presidents.<br>
<br>To begin with, the JRU had leading members of the nominally Orthodox United Synagogue on its governing body&#151;for example Rabbi Simeon Singer&#151;thus signalling that its existence was not meant to be schismatic. It began holding Saturday afternoon services at the premises of the West London Synagogue, but rejected a set of conditions demanded by the West London, including the recitation of a number of Hebrew prayers, a prohibition on the employment of hymns not composed by Jews, and the strict separation of sexes. Underlying the insistence of the JRU on the equality of the sexes at prayer, Lily Montagu and Claude Montefiore nurtured a passionate belief in the part that the JRU could play in the emancipation of the Jewish woman. Chief Rabbi Hermann Adler issued a condemnation of the JRU, and was joined in this condemnation by Samuel Montagu, who became estranged from Lily and from her sister Marian, who had joined in her venture. In his will Montagu stipulated that each daughter was to lose three-quarters of her share of his estate should she persist in the promotion of &#145;a movement known as &#147;Liberal Judaism&#148; the objects of which I strongly disapprove&#146;  (Alderman, 207). It is a tribute to the sincerity of Lily and Marian that neither of them capitulated to this threat.<br>
<br>In 1909 the JRU became the Jewish Religious Union for the Advancement of Liberal Judaism. Members of Orthodox congregations who had identified with it were induced to resign after Hermann Adler had condemned its form of religious services as contrary to Jewish law. The JRU acquired a former chapel in Hill Street, Marylebone, as its place of worship, and the Liberal Jewish Synagogue, as it was called, came into being in 1911, when it acquired its first minister, Israel Mattuck. Some parts of the service were in Hebrew, but for the most part English was used. A few verses were chanted from the <span class="roman">Torah</span> scroll: no one was &#145;called&#146; to the reading of the law, as in Orthodox synagogues. There was an organ and a mixed-sex choir. Men and women sat together&#151;of course. Two years later the West Central Club was reorganized as a section of the JRU. In due course affiliate congregations of the JRU were established in other parts of London and in the provinces. Meanwhile, Lily began preaching at the Hill Street place of worship; in 1925 the congregation moved to larger premises in St John's Wood Road, and in 1944 she was formally ordained there as a lay minister.<br>
<br>Side by side with her work for Liberal Judaism, both in England and worldwide, Lily Montagu pursued a career as a social worker. She was one of the first women to be made a justice of the peace, becoming in time chair of the Westminster magistrates. In 1937 she was appointed OBE. In spite of her many acts of open and proud rebellion against Jewish Orthodoxy, Montagu remained in some respects a remarkably Orthodox Jewess. She adhered throughout her life to the Orthodox dietary laws and recited (at the New West End Synagogue) the memorial prayer for her parents. She died on 22 January 1963 at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London, and was buried, in strict accordance with Orthodox Jewish practice, beside her parents at the Edmonton cemetery of the Federation of Synagogues, Middlesex. She never married.<br>
