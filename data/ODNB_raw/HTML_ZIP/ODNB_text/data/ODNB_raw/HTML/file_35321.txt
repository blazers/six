<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Oppenheimer, Sir  Ernest</span>  (1880&#150;1957), <span class="occ">diamond merchant and financier</span>, was born in Friedberg, Germany, on 22 May 1880, the fifth son and eighth child of Eduard Oppenheimer (1841&#150;1924), cigar merchant, and his wife, Nanny Hirschhorn (1841&#150;1912). From the age of ten he was educated in French and classics at the Augustinerschule in Friedberg, before following his brothers Bernard and Louis in 1896 into a clerkship with the London diamond merchants A. Dunkelsbuhler &amp; Co.<br>
<br>Oppenheimer's apprenticeship gave him a detailed insight into the valuation and marketing of diamonds through the London diamond syndicate which handled the bulk of world production, as well as valuable contacts through relatives and friends with many of the leading investors in South African mining. After naturalization as a British subject in 1901, he was sent to Kimberley as Dunkelsbuhlers's representative and served on the De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd diamond committee which negotiated sales and contracts with the London syndicate&#151;an exceptional position of trust for a young man still in his twenties. His business status was complemented socially by his marriage on 19 June 1906 to Mary Lina (1890&#150;1934), daughter of Joseph Pollack, a wealthy London stockbroker. Her sister married Oppenheimer's brother Louis. From that date Oppenheimer became resident in South Africa on behalf of his firm and immersed himself in Kimberley local government following his election to its town council in 1908 and appointment as mayor (1912&#150;15).<br>
<br>In 1914, with the manager of De Beers, Oppenheimer made a detailed survey of the diamond mines of South-West Africa. When these assets came under South African control during the military occupation of the German colony, Oppenheimer was well informed on their value and production potential. Despite his own contribution to this campaign by helping to raise the Kimberley regiment and organizing a labour force to construct a strategic railway, he resigned his position as mayor in the face of anti-German demonstrations in South Africa. He returned temporarily to Dunkelsbuhlers in London in 1915 to learn the business of gold-mining finance in his firm's subsidiary Consolidated Mines Selection Company (CMS), directed by his brother Louis and the American mining engineer William Lincoln Honnold.<br>
<br>By acquiring mining property rights in Far East Rand as a basis for a contract with CMS, Oppenheimer became effectively a co-partner and used this position to found and capitalize a new mining house backed by Honnold and American trusts. With the blessing of General J. C. Smuts, the Anglo American Corporation was registered on 25 September 1917 and Oppenheimer ceded his contract with CMS to the new corporation and became its chairman. From this base Oppenheimer was in a position to organize financial backing for the acquisition of South-West African diamond companies from a Cape Town syndicate which had bought out German owners in early September 1919. The formation of Consolidated Diamond Mines of South West Africa Ltd (CDM) by Anglo satisfied the Smuts&#150;Botha government's concern to keep these assets under South African control and Oppenheimer's personal ambition to secure for Anglo a significant quota of sales through the London diamond syndicate. The coup also boosted Oppenheimer's standing with Smuts, who had come to appreciate his qualities in the south-western mine negotiations and at the Versailles peace conference, at which Oppenheimer was an observer. For his wartime services behind the scenes he was created a knight bachelor on 31 December 1920. Oppenheimer remained a supporter of the South African Party and at Smuts's behest represented Kimberley as a member of the house of assembly from 1924 to 1938 in a safe seat supported by mining interests.<br>
<br>As relations between diamond producers, the department of mines, and the Nationalist government deteriorated in the 1920s, Oppenheimer exploited CDM's participation in the system of contracts by offering in January 1925 to set up an alternative sales outlet for South-West African production on very favourable terms. This, he intimated, would head off the threat of government legislation for greater state control, assure revenue for South-West Africa, and manage through other contracts production by &#145;outside&#146; producers in Angola, the Congo, west Africa, and British Guiana. For this initiative Anglo and Dunkelsbuhlers were expelled from the existing syndicate and, with government approval, became the nucleus for a rival purchasing organization which was financially strong enough to guarantee production quotas at a period of falling demand. Oppenheimer's triumph in forcing this reorganization on De Beers and other companies was marked by his chairmanship of the De Beers board from 1929.<br>
<br>By then, far greater problems of world recession and over-production from uncontrolled claims in South Africa had to be faced in co-operation with government by purchase of alluvial sites to hold in reserve, by deploying funds to buy up diamonds produced by alluvial diggers, by control of production in Nama Land, and, ultimately, by totally restructuring the syndicate to meet its obligations to producers. This was achieved by ensuring high levels of producer investment in the Diamond Corporation which replaced the old syndicate in 1930, and by setting new quotas which guaranteed a share of sales to state alluvial diggings in Nama Land. To further restore confidence, De Beers mines were closed for a period, while &#145;outside&#146; production in Africa continued. Oppenheimer accepted the creation by government of a statutory body of miners and officials&#151;the Diamond Producers' Association&#151;in 1934 to oversee all contracts and quotas.<br>
<br>As sales of rough diamonds recovered in the late 1930s, Oppenheimer refined the classification and resale mechanisms of the &#145;central selling organisation&#146; in London and South Africa, invested in the technology and marketing of industrial diamonds, and centralized the joint ownership of the Diamond Corporation and its subsidiaries under Anglo and De Beers who increased their share earnings and reinvested in other areas of South African industry and agriculture. By 1939 Oppenheimer was sufficiently confident of the continued viability of the worldwide diamond cartel to plan for shifting stocks and sales from London to the United States, closer to the main market for cut and industrial stones, a move which was stopped by wartime controls and the British Board of Trade. A further part of his plan to centre classification in Johannesburg and Kimberley was, however, implemented in the 1950s and 1960s, when government and diamond interests co-operated actively for tax advantages and investment in South African industrial expansion.<br>
<br>The innovative techniques of group organization with common financial and technical services which characterized Oppenheimer's restructuring of diamond mining in South Africa owed much to his experience of gold mining through Anglo's investments in Far East Rand which were developed more profitably after 1932 and expanded into Orange Free State goldfields, as deep-level methods were applied. Less successfully, Anglo acquired interests in the Rhodesian copperbelt in 1924, consolidating them as Rhodesian Anglo American in 1928 and acting as consultants to the British South Africa Company. By co-operation with American financial interests centred on A. Chester Beatty's Selection Trust, Oppenheimer safeguarded Anglo and BSA concessions and weathered the 1930s fall in metal prices into more prosperous expansion and support for Northern Rhodesian power supplies, railways, and mining through Rhodesia Anglo Services Ltd (1952) and the incorporation of Bancroft Mines Ltd in 1953.<br>
<br>Similarly in post-war South Africa, Oppenheimer worked for industrial and manufacturing investment on the basis of mineral wealth and improved the country's financial services by founding a finance corporation, a merchant bank, and a discount house. By the 1950s, therefore, his contribution to the economic development of South Africa and Rhodesia rested on his restructuring and relocation of the diamond cartel in South African hands, his successful long-term investment in deep-level gold mining, and his spread of holdings in manufacturing and services. His firmly paternalistic view of the social and political advancement of African employees allowed considerable scope for the improvement of workers' housing and training, but little for political representation.<br>
<br>Like Cecil Rhodes, philanthropy rather than social or political reform provided an outlet for Oppenheimer's keen sense of the innovative power of great wealth. Unlike Rhodes, Oppenheimer's bequests had no commanding focus and included chairs in international affairs, Portuguese studies at the University of the Witwatersrand, a faculty of engineering at Stellenbosch and grants for medical research, Commonwealth studies at Oxford, and a science laboratory at Cambridge. Nevertheless, for his generous bequests and in recognition of his contribution to South African and Rhodesian development he was awarded the honorary degree of DCL at Oxford University in 1952. His benefactions were continued after his death through the Ernest Oppenheimer Memorial Trust.<br>
<br>With an acerbic and forceful side to his public character, Oppenheimer was most at his ease among family and friends. He handled business rivals and political enemies with subtlety and ruthlessness, but was capable of enduring loyalties. He narrowly escaped death on the <span class="italic">Galway Castle</span>, sunk by torpedo on 12 September 1918, and he suffered the loss of his first wife, Mary, in 1934, followed by his younger son's death by drowning in 1935. He drew comfort from deep religious convictions, marked by his baptism in the Christian faith on 18 April 1935; and he found personal strength in his second marriage, to Caroline Magdalen (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Harvey), Lady Oppenheimer (1899&#150;1971), the widow of his nephew Sir Michael Oppenheimer, whom he married on 1 June 1935. The future of Oppenheimer's business empire was secured by the ability of his second son, Harry Frederick, to take up the management of his complex estate with its core family company, E. Oppenheimer &amp; Son, created in 1935 to hold a personal fortune and help finance the founder's public companies.<br>
<br>When Oppenheimer died in Johannesburg on 25 November 1957 there was national mourning and flags were flown at half-mast on all government buildings throughout South Africa. He was buried three days later at St George's Church, Parktown.<br>
