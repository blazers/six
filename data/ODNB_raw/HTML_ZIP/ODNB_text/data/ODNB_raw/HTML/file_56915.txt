<span class="headword">Ryan,  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1770&#150;1847), <span class="occ">mining engineer and inventor</span>, was born in Ireland. His early years are obscure but he had &#145;from a youth, a powerful predilection for the study of minerals, and their various geological character and position&#146;  (J. Ryan, &#145;Address to coal owners of Tyne and Wear&#146;, 15 Nov 1843, 2). By 1800 he was employed as &#145;mineral surveyor&#146; to the Grand Canal Company of Ireland. In 1803, the company became involved in establishing the Doonane collieries at Castlecomer, in the hope of building up trade on the canal. By late April 1804 Ryan was based at these collieries, the site of the first Newcomen and Watt steam engines in Ireland. About this time Ryan was also involved with north Welsh collieries, including that at Bagillt, Flintshire. His involvement in mining seems to have inspired his invention of a new mine-boring apparatus, first reported at a meeting of the Dublin Society on 19 April 1804. The device brought up cores from potential mining sites using a cylindrical trepanning cutter. With the encouragement of the Dublin Society and a loan from the Grand Canal Company (to which he was now named engineer), Ryan obtained an English patent for his corer on 28 February 1805. The device was used for mineral exploration near Clonmel and Wexford in Ireland, but after a report on their Doonane collieries, the Grand Canal Company decided it had no further use for Ryan's services.<br>
<br>Ryan moved to mainland Britain where his invention was demonstrated to the board of agriculture and the British Mineralogical Society in 1807, and to members of both the Royal Society and the Geological Society of London in 1808. All these groups reported favourably on its novelty. The 1808 demonstration to the Geological Society was arranged by James Sowerby (1757&#150;1822), an early advocate of the importance of William Smith's stratigraphic discoveries. This introduced Ryan to Smith's methods, and Ryan sent stratigraphically arranged suites of geological specimens both to Sowerby, for use in his <span class="italic">Mineral Conchology</span> project, and to the Geological Society from 1808. In this same year Ryan's device was used in exploratory borings for Richard Trevithick's Thames Tunnel project.<br>
<br>In 1806 Richard Lovell Edgeworth had noted that Ryan's invention could be used in boring special wide passages to improve mine ventilation. This application was soon put into practice in the particularly dangerous south Staffordshire coalfield, and Ryan lectured on his new methods at the Royal Institution in 1810. With the foundation of the Society for Preventing Accidents in Coal Mines in 1813, mine ventilation became a highly political matter. Views were polarized as to whether better illumination (with the Davy and Stephenson &#145;safety&#146; lamps) or better ventilation (as encouraged by Ryan) was more needed. The Royal Society and Royal Institution favoured the first, while the Society of Arts favoured the second, awarding Ryan 100 guineas with a gold medal in 1816.<br>
<br>In 1818 Ryan moved to Montgomeryshire to mine lead and then feldspar for the Staffordshire pottery industry. This involvement was to cause Ryan major financial embarrassment, and litigation was still continuing in 1840. Nevertheless, Ryan had by 1831 erected a school there for instructing &#145;young men in my System of mining&#146;  (Wedgwood MS 21874). This was the first such purpose-built school in Britain. Ryan's last years were spent continuing to promote his scheme of mine ventilation. In 1840 this had drawn praise from a Belgian director of mines and the 1842 <span class="italic">Report of the South Shields Committee</span> was also very favourable. Yet another disaster, in a poorly ventilated mine at Haswell, Durham, in 1844, inspired a commission of inquiry under Charles Lyell and Michael Faraday. Ryan was not allowed to speak at the inquest but Faraday noted that Ryan's &#145;principle seems very beautiful&#146;  (M. Faraday, &#145;The ventilation of mines&#146;, <span class="italic">Civil Engineer and Architects' Journal</span>, 8, April 1845, 118).<br>
<br>Ryan died on 21 July 1847 at the house of Mr Brooke, Wolverhampton Street, Dudley, the town which he had made his home since 1808. He was buried on 25 July at St Thomas's, Dudley. He had latterly been receiving an annual pension of &pound;50 from the revenues of Lord Ward's mines, whose safety he had so much promoted. He had married in or before 1811 (his wife's name was Mary), and, following his death, his only child, Mary Jane, was allowed a reduced pension of 10<i>s</i>. a week. Ryan's last moments none the less were &#145;comparatively those of a pauper&#146;  (Johnson, 194), his reward for developing a mine system which was more expensive than the one it should have replaced and, perhaps, for being Irish.<br>
