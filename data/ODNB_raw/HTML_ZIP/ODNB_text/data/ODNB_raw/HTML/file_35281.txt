</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">O'Brien,  William</span>  (1852&#150;1928), <span class="occ">journalist and Irish nationalist</span>, was born in Mallow, co. Cork, on 2 October 1852. He was the second son of James O'Brien, a solicitor's clerk, and his wife, Kate, daughter of James Nagle, a local shopkeeper. On his mother's side he was descended from an old and distinguished local family, of which Edmund Burke's mother had been a member, although that family no longer enjoyed either the status or prosperity it once had. O'Brien received his secondary education at the local Anglican school, Cloyne Diocesan College, and was brought up in an environment generally noted for its religious tolerance. From an early age he appears to have greatly valued this climate, and to have attached great importance to the need for such tolerance in Irish national life.<h2>
<a name="Earlyjournalismandpoliticalideas"></a>Early journalism and political ideas</h2>In 1868 financial misfortune caused O'Brien's family to move to Cork, where he began to write, in the hope that this might earn him an income. At Queen's College, Cork&#151;an institution indicted by the Catholic hierarchy as a &#145;godless college&#146;&#151;he studied law, one of the few courses not discountenanced by the church. The death of his father in 1869, and the illness of his elder brother and younger brother and sister, meant that he had to turn his attention at an early age to the financial support of his mother and siblings, and thus he never graduated. However, he retained a lifelong attachment to the institution which, later in his life, was to become University College, Cork, and it is there that one of the finest portraits of him hangs and the major part of his private papers is deposited. The habit of prolific writing, which was to remain with him for the rest of his life, began early, and by 1869 it had earned him a job as a reporter on the Cork <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span>. This established him in what was to be his primary career, and it was as a journalist that he first attracted attention as a public figure.<br>
<br>As with so many of his contemporaries in the nationalist movement, O'Brien's political ideas were largely shaped by two influences, the Fenian movement and the plight of the Irish tenant farmers. Although he was himself too young to be a participant in the abortive rebellion of 1867, his elder brother did take part and O'Brien shared much of the excitement of those around him. Afterwards he became actively involved himself in the Fenian brotherhood, but resigned in the mid-1870s because of what he later described as &#145;the gloom of inevitable failure and horrible punishment inseparable from any attempt at separation by force of arms&#146; and &#145;the miserable mire of recrimination in which beaten movements in Ireland &hellip; are sure to end&#146;  (O'Brien, <span class="italic">Evening Memories</span>, 443&#150;4). His attention as a journalist had, in any case, turned to the sufferings of tenant farmers, especially the poorest and most miserable of them. In particular, over Christmas 1877, O'Brien&#151;now on the staff of the <span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span>&#151;toured the Buckley estate in the Galtee Mountains, where the impoverished tenants were threatened with eviction. The articles he wrote describing their conditions were subsequently published in pamphlet form under the title <span class="italic">Christmas on the Galtees</span> (1878). It is here that O'Brien first revealed his belief that parliamentary reform, the secret ballot, and the new power of press and public opinion had opened up the prospect of pursuing Irish issues through constitutional and open political activity. In this he was, with so many, responding to the hope that the new home-rule movement associated with Isaac Butt might marshall Irish opinion around a linking of political and agrarian reform.<h2>
<a name="EditorofUnitedIrelandandMP"></a>Editor of United Ireland and MP</h2>It was the dominance of Charles Stewart Parnell that raised O'Brien to the first rank of Irish nationalist politicians of the new generation. Parnell, recognizing his exceptional talent as a writer and journalist, appointed him in 1881 to be the editor of the new weekly Land League newspaper <span class="italic">United Ireland</span>. While imprisoned in Kilmainham gaol with the other nationalist leaders between October 1881 and April 1882, O'Brien drafted the famous &#145;No rent&#146; manifesto which escalated the conflict between the Land League and Gladstone's government. Through his editorship of <span class="italic">United Ireland</span> during the 1880s, O'Brien made a major contribution to the consolidation under Parnell of a confident and aggressive nationalist political culture, encompassing the aspirations of widely diverse elements of nationalist Ireland.<br>
<br>O'Brien was first elected to parliament in 1883, at a by-election for the seat of Mallow, where he secured a significant victory, a product both of his own local standing and of the new political power of Parnellism. This was to mark the beginning of a long and significant parliamentary career, though one characterized throughout by a strong disinclination for the parliamentary role as distinct from political activity in Ireland itself. He foreshadowed this at his Mallow victory with the declaration that &#145;to be a member of the English Parliament is to me a matter of repugnance rather than of joy&#146;  (Warwick-Haller, 63). Despite this, he was a member of the House of Commons almost continuously until the general election of 1918, there being only three periods of absence: in 1886&#150;7, between 1895 and 1900, and for eight months in 1904. As a member he added considerable colour to the house, often providing highly theatrical representations of occurrences in Ireland. During one of his imprisonments, when his refusal to wear prison clothes resulted in his being left without clothing, a Blarney tweed suit was smuggled into him; he later wore this much publicized apparel for his parliamentary confrontation with his incarcerator, Arthur Balfour. Apart from Mallow (1883&#150;5), he was also member for Tyrone South (1886), North East Cork (1887&#150;92), and Cork City (1892&#150;5 and 1901&#150;18).<h2>
<a name="MarriageandthesplitintheIrishparty18901891"></a>Marriage and the split in the Irish party, 1890&#150;1891</h2>The year 1890 marked a major turning point in O'Brien's personal and political life. On 11 June of that year he married Sophie Raffalovich [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55178/', "O'Brien, Sophie (1860&#150;1960)")</script>], the daughter of a Russian Jewish banker, Hermann Raffalovich, domiciled in Paris. His wife brought to the marriage very considerable wealth, which was to enable O'Brien thereafter to act more independently in politics and to back his judgement with the necessary financial resources, to the point even of being able to establish his own newspapers. He also received from his wife very substantial moral and emotional support for his political pursuits; the correspondence between them attests to her deep commitment to his public life. In addition, their marriage began what was for O'Brien to be a deep and abiding love of France and interest in its affairs and politics. Their wedding had another less auspicious significance: it was the last occasion on which virtually the whole of the Irish Parliamentary Party was gathered together before its disruption by the O'Shea divorce case.<br>
<br>The ensuing split in the party and the death of Parnell in 1891 were to affect O'Brien with particular force. Together with his leading colleagues he was now to be thrust into primary responsibility for the party's affairs, but unlike most of them he found peculiar difficulty in reconciling himself to either side of the chasm which had opened over the issue of Parnell's continued leadership. Remaining personally and emotionally loyal to Parnell, he none the less took the view that Parnell's actions were insupportable politically. Having failed in negotiations at Boulogne to persuade Parnell to withdraw from the leadership, he returned to the United Kingdom, where he and John Dillon gave themselves up to the prison sentence for conspiracy which they had been evading in the United States and in France, and in the relative calm of Galway gaol he began to consider his political future. Unlike Dillon, he thought they should remain aloof from any alignment, preserving themselves as a &#145;dispassionate tribunal&#146;  (O'Brien, <span class="italic">Olive Branch</span>, 54) to which other nationalists might turn as the fratricidal strife receded. However, he subordinated his judgement to that of Dillon, who saw the weight of political strength on the anti-Parnellite side, rather than risk an open split with one with whom he was so closely identified personally and politically.<h2>
<a name="PoliticsafterParnell"></a>Politics after Parnell</h2>O'Brien was never comfortable in the anti-Parnellite party. He worked hard in the negotiations leading to the 1893 <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span>, but with its defeat in the House of Lords and with Gladstone's retirement he was face to face with what he saw as the irrelevance of the party, both at Westminster and in Ireland. On the one hand, he thought that it was now essential for Irish nationalism to re-establish its independence of the Liberal Party, but he was also hostile to the solely parliamentary strategy which was being pursued. His own views had been shaped by the &#145;new departure&#146; in the 1870s, when the combination of Fenian, agrarian, and parliamentary elements had given a new vitality to nationalist action. Whereas Parnell had appeared to think that the extra-constitutional dimension of the movement could be allowed to fall into abeyance once his immediate objectives had been secured, O'Brien saw such agitational politics as a necessary means both of preserving the attachment of more extreme nationalists to constitutionalism and of maximizing pressure on British parties at Westminster. For this reason, in 1886 he and others had launched the Plan of Campaign in the face of opposition from Parnell. In the mid-1890s he saw the necessity of a similar mobilization, but resistance now came from the leaders of all the nationalist factions.<br>
<br>In 1895 O'Brien gained his freedom from a political involvement that he found increasingly intolerable. Threatened with bankruptcy on account of debts incurred politically and for which he was being held personally responsible, he seized the excuse this gave him to withdraw from parliament. He and his wife settled, for the first period of relative domesticity since their marriage, at Mallow Cottage, beautifully located between Croagh Patrick and Clew Bay, near Westport, co. Mayo, where he also established connections with the tenant farmers of that area and began to articulate their political aspirations. From these origins he established a new agrarian and political organization, the United Irish League, founded in January 1898. Exploiting the centenary of the United Irishmen's rebellion, as well as agrarian discontent and disenchantment with the factionalism of national politics, this new body proved extremely popular and had, by 1900, extended its network of branches over most of the country. While O'Brien's objective was the achievement of national unity through organized popular opinion, the effect of the league's success was to stimulate a largely defensive reunion by the discredited parliamentary factions. This unity, achieved in January 1900, was a disappointment to O'Brien, for it prevented the league from using its control of selection of candidates to remove from the parliamentary party its less effective members, most of whom were re-elected in the general election of 1900. Recognizing the impossibility of openly opposing reunion, O'Brien hoped that the vitality and relative autonomy of the United Irish League would serve as a stimulant to a more active and imaginative political strategy.<h2>
<a name="Irishpoliticsafter1900"></a>Irish politics after 1900</h2>With the reunion of the Irish Parliamentary Party and the dominance of the United Irish League as the national organization, O'Brien became the most influential figure within the nationalist movement, although not formally its leader. His initial strategy was to intensify agitation for completion of land purchase by the tenant farmers, pressuring the government to use powers of compulsory purchase to buy out the landlords. Instead, the major effect of the agitation was an initiative by moderate landlords for a conference of landlords and tenants to reach a settlement by agreement. As a result of its success, and the consequent Wyndham <span class="roman">Land Act</span> of 1903, O'Brien guided the official nationalist movement into endorsement of a new policy of conciliation, designed to remove the sharp polarization between the erstwhile landlord and tenant classes and to allow for a broadening of the basis of nationalism. To O'Brien this was the logical outcome of the abolition of landlordism. He also saw in this new approach, which he labelled &#145;Conference, Conciliation, Consent&#146;, the potential to bridge some of the divisions along religious and ethnic lines which had been so marked an attribute of Irish politics since 1886. He already foresaw that, unless this could be done, nationalist objectives would be frustrated, and he lived to see the realization of his worst fears in the partition of Ireland. For many of his colleagues, however, the adoption of a conciliatory approach to the &#145;hereditary enemy&#146; involved too sharp a deviation from the political and cultural habits of a lifetime, and&#151;led by John Dillon, Michael Davitt, and Thomas Sexton&#151;a campaign was launched against that policy. Faced with the failure of the party's leader, John Redmond, to discipline the opponents of the new policy, O'Brien resigned in November 1903 from his positions of leadership in the movement, hoping thereby to shock the party and public opinion into realizing the need for adherence to policy. The effect of his action, however, was to secure for his opponents control of the party and its organization and effectively to exclude him thereafter from influence within the movement which he had played the principal part in reconstructing.<br>
<br>From 1903 to 1916 O'Brien's contribution to Irish political life took three forms. First, he assumed the role of principal critic of the strategy being pursued by his former colleagues, warning against the increasingly sectarian basis of nationalist action, condemning the refusal to reciprocate the co-operative attitude of more moderate members of the landlord class, and predicting the resurgence of revolutionary nationalism. Secondly, despite initial inclinations to withdraw from active political life, he became the parliamentary leader of a small group of dissident nationalists, known from 1909 onwards as the All-for-Ireland League, which had its principal basis of support in the anti-sectarianism of county Cork. While never holding more than ten seats in the House of Commons, this group was able to keep alive a broader concept of nationalism and deny to the party of John Redmond a universality of representation to which it thought itself entitled. Thirdly, during these years O'Brien applied himself to writing both general literary works and autobiographical and other accounts of the events in which he had been a participant. His robust and colourful language, together with the distinctiveness of his point of view on political events, made his works popular in Ireland. While out of accord with the dominant political strategy of the Irish party, they stand the test of time extremely well, embodying a view of Irish politics more able than the established historiography to accommodate events since his death. All told, his publications comprise: two novels, evocative in their own way of the periods in which they were set and both written during terms of imprisonment; about ten substantial literary, autobiographical or historical volumes; approximately ten pamphlets, some of them embodying his speeches; and more than twenty articles in contemporary journals. His editorship, proprietorship, and sponsorship of newspapers must also be added to this body of writing: <span class="italic">United Ireland</span> in the 1880s; the <span class="italic">Irish People</span> from 1899 to 1909; the <span class="italic">Cork Accent</span> in 1910; and the <span class="italic">Cork Free Press</span> from 1910 to 1916.<h2>
<a name="Retirementdeathandassessment"></a>Retirement, death, and assessment</h2>In 1918 O'Brien finally withdrew himself and his small party from active political life, believing that Sinn F&eacute;in had earned the right to represent the nationalist interest. Many of his own supporters in the All-for-Ireland League had already transferred their allegiance to the revolutionary movement, and by the time of the Irish Free State election of 1927 O'Brien had publicly committed himself to the republican side, more on account of his opposition to partition than for support of republicanism.<br>
<br>To O'Brien the unity of Ireland was to be preserved at all costs. His alienation after 1903 from many of his lifelong friends and colleagues was attributable to his belief that by their attachment to older habits of conflict they would stereotype sectarian divisions and make the ideals of national autonomy and unity impossible of achievement. &#145;Any price for a United Ireland, but partition never&#146;  (MacDonagh, 224) was his view, and he would have preferred the indefinite deferral of national independence to one based on the establishment of two confessional states. It was a perspective to which subsequent events have given more substance than most of his contemporaries were prepared to acknowledge.<br>
<br>O'Brien died suddenly of heart failure on 25 February 1928 at the Belgravia Hotel, Grosvenor Gardens, Victoria, while on a visit to London with his wife. A requiem mass at Westminster Cathedral, where he had often worshipped while in London as a member of parliament, preceded the return of his body to Ireland, for burial in the churchyard at Mallow. His wife later returned to live in Paris, where she lived into the 1950s. They had no children. Both O'Brien's parents, and his three siblings, had all died before he was thirty.<br>
