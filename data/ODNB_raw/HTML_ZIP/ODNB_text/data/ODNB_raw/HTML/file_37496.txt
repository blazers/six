<span class="headword">Gurle <span class="st"> [Garrle]</span>,  Leonard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1621&#150;1685), <span class="occ">gardener and nurseryman</span>, had one of the earliest general nursery gardens in London from the early 1640s, when he moved from Southwark to a 12 acre site in east London between Brick Lane and Greatorex Street, north of Old Montagu Street. During the 1660s and 1670s his nursery was the largest in London, and he was famous as a supplier of fruit trees in particular, though he sold ornamental trees and shrubs and seeds as well. Leonard Meager in <span class="italic">The English Gardener</span> (1670) printed &#145;a Catalogue of divers sorts of Fruit, which I had of my very Loving friend Captain Garrle&#146;, containing over 300 varieties, many of them from France  (Meager, 82). By 1661 Gurle had raised the hardy nectarine &#145;Elruge&#146; and given it his own name reversed, with an extra &#145;e&#146; for euphony.<br>
<br>In 1672 Gurle sold pear and other fruit trees, cypresses, spruces, and other forest trees, jasmine, and honeysuckles, with a box of seeds, to Sir Roger Pratt, for his garden at Ryston Hall, near Downham, Norfolk. Late in 1674 he supplied fruit trees to Sir Richard Temple at Stowe, and to William Russell, first duke of Bedford, at Woburn Abbey. The Woburn order included dwarf plums and cherries, French pears, an Elruge nectarine, and other fruit, with more young trees &#145;to make good those that died last year&#146; in accordance with Gurle's guarantee to supply &#145;the best of every sort in case any fail or die&#146;  (Thomson, 251). After the death of John Rose in 1677, Gurle succeeded him as the king's gardener at St James's Palace, with &pound;320 a year to maintain the garden and another &pound;240 a year as his own salary. There he had an official residence, but he continued to run his Whitechapel nursery, with another in London Fields.<br>
<br>Gurle died in the spring of 1685, before 2 April, and was buried in Woodham Walter, near Maldon, Essex, which may have been his place of birth. His widow, Joyce, was his second wife, whom he had married in 1676, and a son, William, was given the power to administer his estate. Two other sons, Martin and Joseph, baptized in 1641 and 1644, and three daughters, Rebecca, Margaret, and Jane, survived their father. The area occupied by the nursery was called Gurle's Ground for some time after Gurle's death; in 1719 part of it was still occupied by a Martin Girle, possibly the nurseryman's eldest son or a grandson.<br>
