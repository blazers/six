<span class="headword">Veil, Sir  Thomas  de</span>  (1684&#150;1746), <span class="occ">magistrate</span>, is a figure whose early life is obscure. According to his contemporary biographer  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life and Times of Sir Thomas Deveil</span>, 5&#150;6) he was born in St Paul's Churchyard, London, in 1684 and was the son of the Revd Dr Hans de Veil, a Church of England clergyman. This de Veil later became, thanks to the patronage of Bishop John Tillotson, librarian at Lambeth Palace.<br>
<br>Only the place and date of birth may, however, be correct. For although the registers of St Augustine, Watling Street, London, record the birth of a Thomas de Veil in the parish on 21 November 1684, this man was the son of Lewis de Compi&egrave;gne de Veil and his wife, Anne. De Veil is said to have been apprenticed to a mercer near Cheapside and then, when his master's business failed, to have become a soldier. Certainly, upon the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession, he enlisted as a volunteer and served with distinction. He fought at Cadiz and Vigo in 1702 and at Almanza in 1707, and by 1713, when the war ended and he was retired on half pay, had attained the rank of captain of dragoons.<br>
<br>Little is known about de Veil's family life. He married his first wife, Anne Hancock, on 27 January 1704 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster. After her death he married three times, but none of his wives survived him. His third wife was called Kingsman; the names of the others are not known. He is said to have fathered twenty-five children. De Veil was appointed to the commissions of the peace for Middlesex and Westminster in 1729, and opened his first office in Leicester Fields (Leicester Square). From there he moved to Thrift Street, Soho, and thence, in 1739 or 1740, to Bow Street. Ambitious, courageous, and active, he did much to prosecute crime and maintain public order in the metropolis. In 1735 he was instrumental in breaking the formidable gang of robbers led by William Wreathock, a Hatton Garden attorney; in 1736&#150;7 he bravely attempted to enforce Sir Robert Walpole's ill-conceived <span class="roman">Gin Act</span>; and in 1741 his efforts secured the conviction of James Hall, who murdered his master, John Penny, principal of Clement's Inn. Hall was executed. Such was his zeal that the government turned to de Veil whenever it needed a magistrate's services. In this capacity he acted as a &#145;court justice&#146; and although this was not an official appointment he was rewarded by Treasury grants, by an appointment as inspector-general of exports and imports (with a salary of &pound;500 per annum) in 1738, and by a knighthood in 1744.<br>
<br>De Veil's stern enforcement of the penal code may not have endeared him to the poor, however, and his exertions in the interests of the powerful frequently incurred popular resentment. Thus, in 1744, at the behest of &#145;great people&#146;, de Veil attempted to prevent a meeting of footmen protesting at the employment of foreign servants. The footmen marched upon his house in Bow Street; he arrested three of their number, but the others stormed the house and released the men. By 1746 de Veil had become the leading metropolitan magistrate, was a colonel in the Westminster militia, and sat on the commissions of the peace for Essex, Surrey, and Hertfordshire. On 6 October 1746, after examining a prisoner at Bow Street, he suffered an apoplectic stroke. He died the next morning and was buried at Denham, Buckinghamshire, on the 11th. His treatise, <span class="italic">Observations on the Practice of a Justice of the Peace</span> (1747), was published posthumously.<br>
<br>De Veil is sometimes cited as a classic example of the venal trading justice, but this is an extreme view. No clear evidence of corruption has ever been adduced against him and, although he lived magnificently, he possessed income other than that derived from fees as a magistrate. His eminence established Bow Street as an important centre of magisterial activity. Two years after his death his house there was occupied by Henry Fielding and thus became the birthplace of the Bow Street runners.<br>
