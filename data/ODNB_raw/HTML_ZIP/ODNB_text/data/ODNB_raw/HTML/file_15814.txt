<span class="headword">Kyd,  Robert</span>  (1746&#150;1793), <span class="occ">botanist and army officer</span>, was born in Forfarshire. Little is known of his family and early life. He may have studied medicine at Edinburgh. In 1764 he obtained a cadetship and was appointed ensign in the Bengal Engineers. The following year he was promoted to lieutenant. He became captain on 3 April 1768, major on 29 May 1780, and lieutenant-colonel on 7 December 1782. On the latter date he was appointed secretary to the military department of inspection in Bengal, a post he seems to have held until his death. He was a man of cultivated tastes, fond of botany, and had amassed a fine collection of plants at his home near Calcutta.<br>
<br>In April 1786 Kyd proposed to the government of Bengal the establishment of a garden to grow nutritious plants such as certain palms, the sago from Malaya, and the Persian date. He suggested that these should be propagated and then distributed throughout British India as alternative sources of food in times of famine. Encouraged by a favourable response, he submitted a more ambitious plan a few months later, greatly extending the range of crops to be grown, and, for the first time, calling his project a &#145;botanical garden&#146;. However, he made it quite clear that he did not envisage a traditional botanical garden but rather a nursery raising &#145;stock for disseminating such articles as may prove beneficial to the inhabitants, as well as to the natives of Great Britain, and which ultimately may tend to the extension of the national commerce and riches&#146;  (Kyd to governor-general, 1 June 1786, Natural History Museum, London, Dawson Turner collection, 7, fols. 57&#150;67). That summer a site for the garden was chosen on the west bank of the River Hooghly a few miles from Calcutta. With Kyd in charge of operations, the ground was cleared, plants were acquired from overseas and from other parts of the Indian subcontinent. Kyd was made honorary superintendent in May 1787. By 1790 about 4000 plants were in cultivation. Kyd was disappointed by the poor response to his appeal for plants useful in horticulture. Nevertheless, during the six years he was in charge he laid the foundations of what was eventually to be the premier botanical garden in Asia. When the young Joseph Hooker visited it in 1848, he declared that it had &#145;contributed more useful and ornamental tropical plants to the public and private gardens of the world than any other establishment before or since&#146;  (J. D. Hooker, <span class="italic">Himalayan Journals</span> 1, 1854, 3&#150;4).<br>
<br>Kyd died at Calcutta on 26 May 1793, and was buried in the South Park Street cemetery there. A memorial urn, executed by the sculptor Thomas Banks, was put up in 1795 on a site selected by William Roxburgh in the botanical garden. <i>Kydia</i>, a genus of the plant family Malvaceae in Sikkim and south-east Asia was named after him by Roxburgh.<br>
