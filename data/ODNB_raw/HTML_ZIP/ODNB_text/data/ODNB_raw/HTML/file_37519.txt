<span class="headword">Hathaway <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Collings]</span>, Dame  Sibyl Mary</span>  (1884&#150;1974), <span class="occ">dame of Sark</span>, was born on 13 January 1884 in Guernsey at the house once owned by her privateer great-great-grandfather, John Allaire, whose business dealings led to the seigniory of Sark passing into her family. The elder daughter (there were no sons) of William Frederick Collings, twenty-first seigneur of Sark, and his Canadian wife, Sophia Wallace (daughter of George Moffat of Montreal), she grew up on Sark to become a lively, intelligent, and headstrong young woman, encouraged by her eccentric father to ignore her congenital lameness and follow many physically demanding pursuits. With the rest of the household she also had to contend with his uncertain temper and even wilder moments during occasional drinking bouts. Few of her governesses stayed for long and, with the exception of two terms at a French convent near Tours, she had little formal education.<br>
<br>She met Dudley John Beaumont, son of Captain William Spencer Beaumont, of the 14th King's hussars, in the spring of 1899 when he visited Sark and painted her portrait. Two years later, following a fierce argument with her father, she fled to England and married Beaumont in London. The marriage produced four sons and three daughters, the youngest of whom was born seven months after her husband's death at the age of forty-one in the influenza epidemic of 1918.<br>
<br>From 1921 to 1923 Sibyl Beaumont lived with her family in Cologne, helped run YMCA canteens, and learned the German which twenty years later was to prove so useful to her. On her father's death in June 1927 she succeeded to the seigniory and became dame of Sark, determined from the outset to bring improvements to the island without sacrificing its unusual charms. After a brief engagement to a man later convicted for bigamy and fraud, in 1929 she married American-born Robert Woodward Hathaway (second of three sons of Charles Hathaway, a Wall Street banker). According to Sark law, by her marriage her estate, including the seigniory, passed to her husband, but she had no intention of relinquishing her hold on island affairs and, although he then became the official seigneur, she sat beside him at meetings of the chief pleas (Sark's governing body), prompting his actions and continuing, albeit illegally, to give voice to her own opinions.<br>
<br>It was during the Second World War that Sibyl Hathaway faced her greatest challenge, when Sark, with the other Channel Islands, was occupied by the Germans in July 1940. She managed throughout the following years to maintain a front of firmness and dignity, earning the respect of the Germans and at the same time extracting the best terms she could for Sark and its people, with whom she shared the hunger and other privations of occupation, the anxieties engendered by two unsuccessful British commando raids, and the pain of separation when many islanders, including her husband, were deported to German prison camps. Liberation finally came on 10 May 1945.<br>
<br>When Robert Hathaway died in December 1954 she regained her full status as dame of Sark and, despite many stormy passages with her islanders, continued to be treated by the majority with the greatest respect, if not always with affection. Through her travels and writings (which included a novel, <span class="italic">Maid of Sark</span>, in 1939 and an autobiography, <span class="italic">Dame of Sark</span>, 1961) and television, radio, and press interviews, her island became known worldwide and its subsequent prosperity owed much to her determination to retain its unique laws and peaceful atmosphere, unpolluted by cars or aeroplanes. She was appointed OBE (1949) and DBE (1965). She died on 14 July 1974 on Sark, having outlived five of her children. Her eldest son was killed in an air raid on Liverpool in 1941, the second died in Australia in 1973, the third (aged nine months) in 1909, and two of her daughters in 1948 and 1967 respectively. Her grandson (John) Michael Beaumont succeeded her to the seigniory.<br>
