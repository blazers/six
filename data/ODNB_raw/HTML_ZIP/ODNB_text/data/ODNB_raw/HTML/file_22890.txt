<span class="headword">Pulton <span class="st"> [Poulton]</span>,  Andrew</span>  (1654&#150;1710), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born on 20 January 1654 in Northamptonshire, the second son of Ferdinand or Ferdinando Pulton of Desborough and his wife, Mary Giffard. His younger brother, Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1668), also became a Jesuit, and the legal writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22891/', "Ferdinando Pulton")</script> was probably related. He was educated at St Omer in 1669&#150;74 and entered the Society of Jesus on 31 October 1674. He studied at Watten (1674&#150;5), Li&egrave;ge (1676&#150;9), and St Omer (1680&#150;83), and again at Li&egrave;ge (1684&#150;6), and was ordained priest on 3 May 1685. In 1682 he apparently converted Charles, the son of John Manners, the first duke of Rutland, to Catholicism.<br>
<br>Pulton was sent to London at Whitsuntide 1687 to teach at the college the Jesuits had established in the Savoy. On 29 September he held a debate with the rector of St Martin-in-the-Fields (and later archbishop of Canterbury), Dr Thomas Tenison. According to <span class="italic">A true and full account of a conference held about religion between Dr Tho. Tenison and A. Pulton</span> (1687) Pulton had not intended to publish an account, but was forced to do so when Tenison printed his own favourable description of the event. Tenison had mocked Pulton's poor command of English; Pulton responded by claiming that:<blockquote>having been Eighteen years out of his own Country, pretends not yet to any Perfection of the <i>English</i> Expression or Orthography; wherefore for the future he will crave the favour of treating with the <i>Dr.</i> in <i>Latine</i> or <i>Greek</i>, since the <i>Dr.</i> finds fault with his <i>English</i>. (<span class="italic">A True and Full Account</span>, sig. A1<i>v</i>)</blockquote>(&#145;Send Pulton to be lashed at Busby's school / That he in print no longer play the fool&#146; declared a contemporary satire over Pulton's linguistic errors; Gillow, <span class="italic">Lit. biog. hist.</span>, 5.351.) Further printed exchanges followed over the following months, drawing in Edward Meredith in support of Pulton as well as a number of others taking Tenison's part. During this time Pulton also published <span class="italic">A Full and Clear Exposition of the Protestant Rule of Faith</span>, a critique of the Anglican church.<br>
<br>Following the destruction of the college by a protestant mob during the events of late 1688 Pulton fled London but was arrested at Canterbury on 11 December <i>en route</i> for the continent. He was released the following year, and was at the college at St Omer in 1689. He rejoined the exiled Stuart court at St Germain and became socius to John Warner, confessor to James II. Pulton accompanied James to Ireland in 1690 as an army chaplain. After his return Pulton remained at St Germain until his death there on 5 August 1710. A court sermon of his was included in <span class="italic">A Select Collection of Catholick Sermons, Preach'd before their Majesties King James II</span> (1741).<br>
