<span class="headword">Kennedy,  Patrick</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1760), <span class="occ">numismatist</span>, was of Scottish birth and may have come from Aberdeen, where he had an uncle. By profession a physician, he was generally known as Dr Kennedy, and he has been referred to as John, not Patrick, apparently erroneously. According to John Nichols he resided for some time at Smyrna but by 1736 he was in London, collecting ancient coins and corresponding with others at home and abroad on numismatics. His collection, augmented by a purchase from Richard Mead, was strong in the coinage of the Hellenistic kingdoms but it was with Roman imperials that Kennedy particularly concerned himself. A special interest in the issues of the third-century British usurper emperors Carausius and Allectus, about which he corresponded with William Stukeley, George North, and others, led him into a rather ridiculous controversy. Kennedy maintained that the female figure named Oriuna on a billon coin of Carausius in Paris was the usurper's patron goddess; Stukeley held her to be his wife. Neither had actually seen the coin in question, relying instead on an engraving; in fact it was a poorly preserved specimen, reading not Oriuna but Fortuna and showing the anodyne image of the goddess Fortune. The debate did however draw attention to the unusually rich imagery of the Carausian coinage, and Kennedy's two principal contributions&#151;<span class="italic">A Dissertation upon Oriuna</span> (1751) and <span class="italic">Further Observations upon Carausius</span> (1756)&#151;are still of interest. He also produced a sixpenny <span class="italic">Letter to Dr Stukeley</span> and an engraved plate of some of his coins of the two usurpers.<br>
<br>Kennedy died &#145;at an advanced age&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 5.451) on 26 February 1760 in the Strand, London, leaving as heirs a sister, her daughters, and two cousins. His will, a highly eccentric document, is chiefly concerned with the disposition of his coins, suggesting that the first pick of his Carausian pieces be given to English buyers, though they would be &#145;greatly valued abroad by all the powers who collect, as France, Spain, a curious pontiff &amp;c&#146;. The collection was sold by Prestage on 8 and 9 May 1760; the 256 coins of Carausius and 89 of Allectus were purchased by P. C. Webb for &pound;86 10<i>s</i>. and afterwards passed into the collection of William Hunter. Kennedy's books and a collection of about 200 pictures, including two portraits of himself by Keysing, had been sold on 30 April.<br>
