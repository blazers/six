<span class="headword">Poore,  George Vivian</span>  (1843&#150;1904), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at Andover on 23 September 1843, the youngest of ten children of Commander John Poore RN (retired) and Martha Midlane. In his early days he was destined to follow his father's profession, and after education at home was sent at the age of ten to the Royal Naval School at New Cross, where he stayed until he was nearly seventeen. Here he gained a medal for good conduct but, having determined to enter the medical profession, he declined a marine cadetship.<br>
<br>Poore began his medical training with an apprenticeship at Broughton, near Winchester, to Luther Fox, father of the dermatologist William Tilbury Fox. On leaving Dr Fox he matriculated at the University of London and entered as a student at University College Hospital, qualifying MRCS in 1866. During the same year he acted as ship's surgeon to the <i>Great Eastern</i> while it was employed in the laying of the Atlantic cable. Poore graduated MB and BS at the University of London in 1868, and took his doctorate in 1871. In 1870 he was admitted a member of the Royal College of Physicians and in 1877 he was elected a fellow.<br>
<br>During 1870 and 1871 Poore travelled as medical attendant with Prince Leopold, duke of Albany, and he remained in charge of his health until 1877. In 1872 he was chosen by Queen Victoria to accompany the prince of Wales during his convalescence in the south of France, after his severe attack of typhoid fever. In the same year, Poore became lecturer in medical jurisprudence at Charing Cross Hospital, and gave a course of lectures entitled &#145;Medical uses of electricity&#146;, the study of which was then in its infancy. In 1876 he was elected assistant physician to University College Hospital and professor of medical jurisprudence and clinical medicine. Among his colleagues were Sir William Jenner, Sir John Russell Reynolds, Sir John Erichsen, Tilbury Fox, Grailly Hewett, and Sir Henry Thompson. In 1876 he also published his <span class="italic">Text Book of Electricity in Medicine and Surgery</span>; at that time this was the most complete and useful English work on the subject.<br>
<br>Poore was recognized by his contemporaries as a highly competent lecturer. His lectures on medical jurisprudence were published as <span class="italic">A Treatise on Medical Jurisprudence</span> (1901; 2nd edn, 1902). In 1883 he was elected full physician to the hospital, and he held this post with his professorship until May 1903, when failing health forced his retirement to his country house at Andover.<br>
<br>Outside his purely medical work Poore was well known both to the medical profession and to the public as an ardent sanitarian. In 1891 he was general secretary of the sanitary congress. In his garden at Andover he proved that living humus had a powerful disinfecting property. Poore put forward this idea with a characteristic charm of style and a wealth of illustration in &#145;The living earth&#146;, the fourth chapter of his <span class="italic">Essays on Rural Hygiene</span> (1893). He dealt with sanitation and with the wastefulness of the carriage of sewage by water in his Milroy lectures for 1899, <span class="italic">The Earth in Relation to the Destruction and Preservation of Contagia</span> (1902, with appendix of public addresses), and in <span class="italic">The Dwelling House</span> (2nd edn, 1898). His views were regarded by many sanitary authorities as heretical, but he proved their practical value as far as the rural dwelling was concerned. Along with many contributions to medical journals, largely on dietetic and sanitary matters, Poore also published works on subjects as diverse as the diseases of the throat, mouth, and nose, and nervous diseases of the hand. Poore died at Andover on 23 November 1904 from cardiac failure due to aortic disease. He was unmarried.<br>
