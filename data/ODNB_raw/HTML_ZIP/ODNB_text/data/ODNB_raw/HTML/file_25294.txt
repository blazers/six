<span class="headword">Sheffield,  Edmund</span>, second earl of Mulgrave  (1611&#150;1658), <span class="occ">parliamentarian nobleman</span>, was born about December 1611, the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25293/', "Edmund Sheffield, first earl of Mulgrave (1565&#150;1646)")</script>. His father, Sir John Sheffield, who drowned in the Humber in 1614, had married Grizel, daughter of Sir Edmund Anderson, chief justice of the common pleas. In May 1617 Edmund was not expected to survive head injuries received after falling downstairs. He married Elizabeth Cranfield (1607/8&#150;1672), daughter of the financier Lionel Cranfield, earl of Middlesex, by licence dated April 1631, with a dowry of &pound;2000. Difficulties over money long soured his relationship with his father-in-law. His unorthodox religious beliefs are indicated by the fact that at some date in the 1630s the dean of the arches, Dr John Lambe, cited him for commissioning a translation of &#145;that cursed book&#146;, the medieval spiritual work <span class="italic">Theologia Germanica</span>. The effort and risk involved implies intense interest in or sympathy with its mysticism. Lord Sheffield since his grandfather assumed the earldom in 1626, he succeeded as second earl of Mulgrave on 6 October 1646 and took his seat in the House of Lords on 20 October.<br>
<br>Acquiring a London residence, the sequestrated Kirke House in Spring Gardens, for &pound;50 rent in October 1645, Mulgrave was appointed vice-admiral of Yorkshire in succession to his grandfather (13 November 1646) by the Long Parliament. In August 1647 he signed the engagement to stand by Fairfax and the army for the restoration of the freedom of parliament. He was named as one of the commissioners for compounding on 8 February 1647 and for the navy and customs on 17 December 1647, and on 1 June 1648 he was added to the parliamentarian executive Derby House committee. He also appealed successfully to the Lords to cancel the monopoly on the manufacture and sale of alum granted to Sir John Gibson, in order to utilize the alum works he owned in Yorkshire. On 14 February 1649 he was appointed a member of the council of state of the Commonwealth, but declined to accept the post from dissatisfaction at the execution of the king and the abolition of the House of Lords. In August 1649 he accepted John Lisle's invitation to lodge with him and Bulstrode Whitelocke at Sion House, Middlesex, unaware that Whitelocke had invited Lisle alone. In February 1653 Mulgrave petitioned the council of state for compensation for parliament's partial demolition of Mulgrave Castle in 1647. The recommendation of the Irish and Scots affairs committee for the payment of &pound;1200 was not implemented due to the dissolution of the Rump Parliament, but on 3 February 1654 Cromwell agreed to take the matter on. His council voted &pound;1000 to Mulgrave though the order for payment by the exchequer had to be transferred to the treasury commissioners in March 1655.<br>
<br>Mulgrave had been considered reliable enough to be recommended to Cromwell as an additional councillor on 19 June 1654. He took his place on the protectorate council on 30 June and was in regular attendance for some years. He took particular responsibility for the preservation of game in the former royal forests in Lincolnshire, but his attendance at the council declined, possibly owing to poor health; in 1656 he was absent from 22 May until 16 September and only then returned on orders. In December 1657 the protector summoned him to his new House of Lords, but Mulgrave never took his seat; disapproval is less likely than illness. He died &#145;by the way&#146; on 24 August 1658 <i>en route</i> for London in response to a summons to attend the upper house, and was buried at Normanby church, Yorkshire. One of the few peers to have adhered to Cromwell, he was succeeded by his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25297/', "John Sheffield, afterwards first duke of Buckingham and Normanby")</script>.<br>
