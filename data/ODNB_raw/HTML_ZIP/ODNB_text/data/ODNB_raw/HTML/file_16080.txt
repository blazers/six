<span class="headword">Lascelles,  Thomas</span>  (1669/70&#150;1751), <span class="occ">military engineer</span>, was probably the Thomas Lascelles baptized at Leake, Yorkshire, on 16 May 1670, the son of Thomas Lascelles. He seems to have been a member of the Lascelles family who owned the small estate of Ganthorne in the North Riding of Yorkshire, but it is unclear whether he inherited any property. He served as a volunteer in Ireland from 1689 to 1691 and distinguished himself at the battle of the Boyne. He also served in the expedition led by Sir George Rooke in 1702 to Cadiz and the destruction of the plate fleet in Vigo, as a gentleman of the 2nd troop of guards volunteers. He obtained his first commission in the regular army in 1704, sharing the pay of an engineer (&pound;100 p.a.) with John Armstrong. He served throughout Marlborough's campaigns in the Low Countries, being present at nearly all the battles and sieges. Lascelles was seriously wounded at the battle of Blenheim in 1704. When Queen Anne distributed &pound;65,000 to the members of Marlborough's army, in recognition of their gallant services, Lascelles received &pound;33 as his share.<br>
<br>Following the treaty of Utrecht in 1713 Thomas Lascelles and John Armstrong were appointed to superintend the demolition of fortifications and the razing of the harbour works at Dunkirk. Lascelles remained on this duty until 1716. He and Armstrong were initially paid 20<i>s</i>. per day, which was double the ordinary allowance. Later the Board of Ordnance had this sum increased by 10<i>s</i>. per day. Having been appointed deputy quartermaster-general in 1715, Lascelles was re-employed at Dunkirk between 1718 and 1725. Lascelles's mission (shared with Armstrong for the early part of 1718) was as much diplomatic as technical. The scheme agreed at the treaty of Utrecht was opposed by the inhabitants, who considered the closed-off old harbour a health risk, and by the merchant interest more specifically, who consistently sought ways of opening up the waterways around Dunkirk to restore their trade. Lascelles sympathized with the aspirations of the merchants and did not object to their being allowed an indirect connection with the English Channel by canal. However, his mission required him to ensure that the direct route to the sea, the old harbour, remained closed to commercial and military traffic while allowing sufficient water to pass through the barrier to prevent the harbour becoming stagnant. The situation demanded constant scrutiny of local politics as well as continual reassessment of the engineering practicalities. Exhausted, Lascelles returned to Britain in 1725.<br>
<br>Lascelles had been promoted director of engineers on 1 April 1722, following the death of Lewis Petit des Etans in 1720, and deputized for Armstrong as surveyor of the ordnance during Armstrong's absences abroad. Lascelles was ordered to return to Dunkirk in March 1730, where he found repairs to the port and fortifications well advanced. Sustained pressure from Lascelles and from the British embassy at Paris achieved the reduction of the new quays and jetties to ground level, but this time local grievances were more closely aligned with the aspiration of the French government to strengthen its offensive capability on its northern coast. Following a series of fruitless negotiations on this issue Lascelles left for Britain in May 1733, leaving the affair in the hands of his nephew and deputy, Joseph Day.<br>
<br>Britain's return to European conflict placed further pressure upon Lascelles. In 1740 he was appointed chief engineer of the train of artillery in the expedition to Cartagena led by Charles, eighth Lord Cathcart; however, by then his services were in such great demand at home that Jonas Moore had to be substituted for him. As a consequence in November 1741 Lascelles was directed to fill the office of surveyor-general of the ordnance during the illness of Major-General John Armstrong. In April 1742 he was directed to become master-surveyor of the ordnance at the Tower of London. Lascelles was further appointed assistant and deputy to the lieutenant-general of the ordnance in May 1742 and to perform the duties of that office for as long as the post remained vacant. On 1 July 1742, following Armstrong's death, he was appointed chief engineer. Lascelles visited Ostend in 1744 to report on the armament and ammunition which was to be sent there and to arrange for the repair and augmentation of the fortifications. He was further promoted inspector-general of artillery and represented the British government at The Hague for the purpose of carrying out the terms of a convention, dated 5 May 1745, between the states general of the United Provinces and George II. Lascelles was further able to determine the balance due from Great Britain to the states general for artillery and ammunition which was required to be supplied by Great Britain in the Low Countries.<br>
<br>Lascelles resigned from the service on 1 March 1750. In April he was granted &pound;200 per annum for life for his long and faithful services. The same year he retired on a pension of &pound;200 per annum; it is unclear whether or not this was an additional sum. Lascelles moved back to his native Yorkshire; in his will, dated 23 November 1750, he is described as &#145;of Pontefract&#146; and possessed estates at Hunton and Scotton, which he left to his nephew Francis Lascelles, in addition to &pound;10,000 p.a. Further legacies were distributed to other members of his family. He died on 1 November 1751, aged eighty-one; he had served through twenty-one campaigns and been present in thirty-six engagements.<br>
