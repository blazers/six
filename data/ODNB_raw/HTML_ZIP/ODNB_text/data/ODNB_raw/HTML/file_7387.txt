<span class="headword">Deane,  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1440&#150;1503), <span class="occ">administrator and archbishop of Canterbury</span>, is first recorded in 1457 as a canon of Llanthony by Gloucester and a young student there. That he later pursued his studies at Oxford is indicated both by his reference in a letter, years afterwards, to that university as his &#145;most gracious mother&#146;  (Anstey, 675&#150;7), and by the fact that in 1473 and 1488 he is recorded as renting rooms from Exeter College. His parentage and early life are totally obscure, but it is likely that his family came from the Forest of Dean, in Gloucestershire; the subsequent progress of his career suggests that he was born <i>c</i>.1440.<br>
<br>In 1467 Deane was elected prior of his community, an office he was to retain, despite his elevation to the episcopate, until 1501. In 1477 he is described, unusually for a religious, as a royal chaplain, and in 1481 he received a papal indult in common form to hold any other benefice with the priory. He proved to be an excellent monastic administrator. In 1481 he obtained from Edward IV, for a fine of 300 marks, the union and subordination to his own community of its ancient mother house of Llanthony Prima in Monmouthshire, where liturgical observance and financial management had sunk to a low ebb. At his own monastery he embarked upon a building programme, of which only the gatehouse survives, decorated (characteristically in this age) with his own arms, a chevron between three birds.<br>
<br>Marks of favour from Henry VII came soon after the king's accession, in the form of grants and confirmations to the priory from December 1485. It is possible that Deane's rise to much greater prominence was through contact with his diocesan Robert Morton (<i>d</i>. 1497), from late 1486 bishop of Worcester, and through him with the latter's uncle John Morton (<i>d</i>. 1500), archbishop of Canterbury and chancellor. Deane, whose knowledge of the common law is suggested by his admission to the society of Lincoln's Inn on 30 October 1489, served as a royal councillor, and on 13 September 1494 was appointed chancellor of Ireland (where Llanthony had substantial possessions), to serve under Sir Edward Poynings (<i>d</i>. 1521), the deputy governor acting for Prince Henry. It was Deane who gave the opening speech at the Drogheda parliament of December 1494, where Poynings' law, and other legislation designed to bring Ireland more firmly under the English crown, was enacted. He was in effective control of Irish administration for much of 1495 while Poynings was on campaign further south, and his regime drew forth a protest from the bishop and clergy of Meath. On Poynings' recall in January 1496 Deane was appointed deputy governor and justiciar of Ireland, and engaged in the strengthening of the boundaries of the pale. Soon however, in August 1496, reversion to a policy of government through Anglo-Irish nobles brought about his replacement.<br>
<br>Before his departure from Ireland, Deane had on 13 April 1494 been granted custody of the temporalities of the bishopric of Bangor, to which he was papally provided on 4 July following. The temporalities were restored on 6 October 1496. The diocese was still suffering from the ravages of Owain Glyn D&#373;r's rebellion, at the beginning of the century, in which both cathedral and bishop's palace had been severely damaged. Deane inaugurated a process of reconstruction which was completed after his translation. His determined reassertion of episcopal rights is illustrated by his recovery of the bishop's fisheries in the Skerries, now claimed by William Gruffudd. Deane personally led a fishing expedition, successfully repulsed armed resistance, and ultimately re-established the see's control over this lucrative right.<br>
<br>Within less than five years Henry VII signalled his intention of securing ecclesiastical preferment for his &#145;faithful counsellor&#146; by granting Deane, on 7 December 1499, custody of the vacant see of Salisbury, to which he was provided by the pope on 8 January 1500. Later that year, on 13 October, after the death of Archbishop John Morton, the chancellor, he was appointed keeper of the great seal, an office he held until 27 July 1502. Thomas Langton, bishop of Winchester, was elected to succeed Morton at Canterbury, but died on 27 January 1501, and Deane was in turn elected to the primatial see on 26 April 1501 and translated on 26 May. When Henry VII restored the temporalities of the archbishopric on 2 August, that parsimonious monarch signalled his &#145;special favour and sincere love&#146;  (Rymer, <span class="italic">Foedera</span>, 2.773&#150;5) by granting Deane the proceeds of the lordship of Canterbury since Morton's death. He was the first religious to be elevated to Canterbury for 135 years, and he was, of course, the last.<br>
<br>The surviving fragments of Deane's Canterbury register provide information only on routine matters. In his sacramental duties he was represented, as at Salisbury, by John Bell, bishop of Mayo. It appears that there was conflict with the University of Oxford over an unspecified jurisdictional issue. Deane's enthusiasm for architectural refurbishment, so characteristic of late fifteenth-century prelates, was manifested in his rebuilding of the archiepiscopal manor of Otford. On a wider national stage he was chief commissioner in the negotiations that resulted, in January 1502, in the contract of marriage between Henry VII's daughter Margaret and James IV, king of Scots, and in a treaty of perpetual peace between the two kingdoms. The showpiece of his pontificate was his celebration on 14 November 1501, assisted by nineteen bishops, of the marriage between Prince Arthur and Katherine of Aragon.<br>
<br>The extravagance of the royal marriage was matched by that of Deane's own funeral after his death at Lambeth Palace on 15 February 1503. The arrangements specified in his last testament provide an excellent illustration of the late medieval desire for conspicuous commemoration (to be organized in this case by, among others, the archbishop's young chaplain, Thomas Wolsey). Deane's coffin, surmounted by his effigy, was transported by barge from Lambeth to Faversham and thence to Canterbury, surrounded all the way by tapers, accompanied by river-men in mourning livery and on the final stages by an escort of gentlemen tenants. On 24 February he was buried in Canterbury Cathedral near to the site of Thomas Becket's martyrdom, and to the saint's tomb he bequeathed a valuable image of St John the Evangelist. His grave was marked by a monumental brass in the martyrdom (the north-west transept), where mass was to be celebrated for his soul for twenty years. A memorandum in a cathedral priory register suggests that his last wishes were not fulfilled, and that he did not even have his month's mind because of financial exigencies, but that he was betrayed by his executors (of whom the foremost was Sir Reginald Bray). In material terms this alleged neglect is paralleled by the losses of his registers as prior of Llanthony and bishop of Bangor and Salisbury. Because of these lacunae, and because the voices of Henry VII's individual councillors are muted, Deane remains a remarkably obscure figure, whose certain distinction can be illustrated far more often by inference than by evidence. He was obviously an able administrator, in both ecclesiastical and secular spheres, while his probity is surely attested by the plaudit delivered by John Fisher (<i>d</i>. 1535) at the funeral of Queen Elizabeth, the day before Deane's own burial, where the loss of the archbishop is equated with that of the queen and Prince Arthur. However anonymously he was certainly one of the pillars of Henry VII's regime, and at the same time a conscientious prelate.<br>
