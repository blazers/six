<span class="headword">Banner, Sir  John Sutherland  Harmood-</span>, first baronet  (1847&#150;1927), <span class="occ">accountant and steel maker</span>, was born at Dingle Mount, Toxteth Park, Liverpool, on 8 September 1847, the second son of Harmood Walcot Banner (1814&#150;1878), an accountant, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sutherland. The family were prosperous members of the Lancashire business community: his paternal grandfather was involved in the founding of the Liverpool stock exchange; and his father left &pound;160,000 when he died, the rewards from his accountancy business.<br>
<br>From 1856 to 1864 Harmood-Banner (as he was known during his adult life) was educated at Radley College and then joined his father's firm in 1865, becoming a partner in 1870. In 1875 he married Elizabeth (1850&#150;1903), the daughter and coheir of the leading Wigan industrialist and MP, Thomas Knowles. They had four sons and two daughters. This marriage was an important influence on his later career, as his father-in-law chaired Pearson and Knowles, a coal and iron conglomerate based in Warrington. He joined the board of this company and became deputy chairman after Knowles's death in 1883.<br>
<br>Harmood-Banner's main career in the 1880s and 1890s was in accountancy. The work was varied and he advised several firms that were in financial difficulties. In 1912&#150;13 he helped in the reconstruction of Samuel Allsopp &amp; Son, brewers in Burton upon Trent. In 1916 Spiers and Ponds, the hotel owners, went into liquidation, and under Harmood-Banner's chairmanship new managers and directors had to be appointed. For many years he was also the auditor of the Bank of Liverpool and the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. In 1904&#150;5 he was president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants. This career as an accountant evidently presented him with opportunities as an adviser and investor in a number of other, mainly Liverpool-based, businesses. These included insurance companies (such as the Liverpool Reversionary Company), speculative gold-mining ventures (notably the Spes Bona Mining Company in the Transvaal), similar operations in South America (for example, the Anglo-Chilian Nitrate and Railway Company), and property companies (Canadian City and Town Properties, formed in 1910, of which he was chairman). On 11 March 1908 he married, in Marylebone, London, his second wife, Ella Wilstone (1881/2&#150;1954), a widow, daughter of John Ernest Herbert Linford.<br>
<br>Harmood-Banner combined his accountancy and advisory work with a political career, having followed his father into Liverpool city council in 1895. His civic career flourished: he was a justice of the peace and deputy lieutenant for Cheshire, mayor of Liverpool in 1912, and alderman two years later. In 1905 he was elected Unionist MP for Everton, launching a parliamentary career that was to last until 1924. A &#145;tory democrat&#146;, he denounced ritualism in the church, supported Ulster protestants, and based his support in Liverpool on sectarianism. In the House of Commons he became a spokesman for Lancashire businesses, particularly the liquor trade with which he had the closest links: in 1915 he served on a cabinet committee which reported on liquor trade restrictions; and between 1922 and 1926 he was chairman of Robert Cain &amp; Sons, brewers in Liverpool.<br>
<br>With Harmood-Banner as its deputy chairman, Pearson and Knowles continued to expand. By 1907 it had acquired the wire making firm of Rylands, which gave the parent company the opportunity to supply its new subsidiary with semi-manufactured steel. This was to be done by the Partington Steel Company, formed in 1910 with a capital of &pound;700,000 and built on a 90 acre site on the banks of the River Irlam near Warrington. With its 3000 ton capacity for the production of billets, rails, and joists, the Partington Company was fully operational by 1913. It has been described as the largest single investment in the steel industry during Edwardian times. Three new blast furnaces were added during the massive expansion of the First World War, a period which also saw Pearson and Knowles set record output levels. Like most steel firms, however, the group had overexpanded, and the post-war legacy was obsolescent plant, debt, and falling orders. By 1920 Pearson and Knowles had been sold to Armstrong Whitworth, at which time Harmood-Banner lost his seat on the board.<br>
<br>In his latter years Harmood-Banner still had several major interests. He was deputy chairman of British Insulated and Helsby Cables, and held directorships on the boards of several electric supply, telegraph, and oil companies, both in Britain and overseas. He was, for example, chairman of Black Sea Amalgamated Oilfields, which was part of the Anglo-Maikop group. In 1921 he became chairman of the Imperial and Finance Corporation, and in the same year joined the board of a London foreign-banking firm. He also served on several government committees, such as that on the luxuries tax in 1918, the royal commission on income tax in 1919, and the railway rates tribunal in 1921&#150;2. He was knighted in 1913 and created a baronet in 1924.<br>
<br>Harmood-Banner retired due to ill health about 1925. He died on 24 February 1927 at his home, Ingmire Hall, Sedbergh, Yorkshire, after a highly successful and varied business career. His eldest son, Harmood Harmood-Banner, succeeded to the baronetcy.<br>
