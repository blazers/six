<span class="headword">Gray,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1388&#150;1436), <span class="occ">diplomat and bishop of Lincoln</span>, obtained letters dimissory for the priesthood in 1414, and was therefore probably born about 1388 or shortly thereafter. The papal registers describe him as &#145;by both parents of a noble race of earls and barons&#146;  (<span class="italic">CEPR letters</span>, 7.283). However, his precise origins have been disputed, there being a number of baronial families of that name. One possibility was the Greys of Ruthin, notably represented by Sir Reynold [iii] Grey, who in 1410 successfully concluded a lengthy lawsuit in the court of chivalry that established his right to bear the arms of the Hastings family. Confusingly, one of William's earliest benefices was Bedale in Yorkshire, where in 1388 Robert Grey of Rotherfield, Oxfordshire, died seized of a moiety of the manor. However, his nephew and namesake <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11567/', "William Grey")</script>, or Gray, bishop of Ely (1454&#150;78), once thought to be a Gray of Codnor, is now known to have been a son of Sir Thomas Grey or Gray of Heaton, Northumberland, who did have noble and royal antecedents.<br>
<br>Gray studied at Oxford, and was a bachelor of civil law by 1414 and of civil and canon law in the following year. By 1421 he had incepted as DCL and is recorded as having rented Deep Hall in High Street. As an unbeneficed king's clerk he was awarded a pension from Whitby Abbey in November 1413. Two years later he was at the Council of Siena with Richard Fleming, whom he was to succeed as bishop of Lincoln. Fleming dispatched him to Pope Martin V to explain the difficulties he was encountering in support of the papal position. Gray was still abroad in November during the second session of the council. Consequently, being by then dean of York, he was absent from the chapter for the disputed election of Philip Morgan early in 1424, following the death of Archbishop Bowet the previous October.<br>
<br>Meanwhile he had acquired a number of benefices, among them Swanscombe in Kent and Pimperne in Dorset, and received papal dispensation to farm their fruits while engaged in study, resident in the Roman curia or in the deanery of York, to which he had been elected in December 1420 and admitted on 4 April following. He held the deanery until his promotion to the episcopate, with the prebend of Botevant and for a brief time, by royal grant, that of Ulleskelf. Martin V, who had reserved the bishopric of London, provided him to that see by a bull of 20 July 1425. This was one of a series of promotions arising from compromise between the English council and the pope. In the following January Henry VI formally licensed his acceptance, and the temporalities were restored on 6 May 1426. Consecration by Archbishop Chichele followed on the 26th at Newarke College, Leicester, and the next day he made his profession of obedience to pope and archbishop. Gray's London register comprises a mere ninety-nine folios, over half of which record ordinations and institutions to benefices. Out of some twenty-three ordinations, nine were undertaken by his suffragan the Benedictine bishop of Dromore, John Chourles. In August 1427 Archbishop John Kemp of York claimed that during the recent vacancy Gray, as dean of York, together with the chapter, had applied certain issues to their own use that they subsequently refused to surrender. Conceivably this included income from the Ulleskelf prebend, which he may have held until his temporalities were restored.<br>
<br>In common with other bishops of London at this time, Gray regularly served on commissions of the peace in counties neighbouring the city, as well as being a conservator of the River Lea between Ware and its confluence with the Thames. He carried out a visitation of St Mary's Hospital in Bishopsgate, and in 1431 was responsible for the transfer of endowments from the impoverished college of Thele or Stanstead St Margaret's, Hertfordshire, to St Mary within Cripplegate, London, commonly known as Elsing Spital. He attended the convocation of 1428&#150;9 at St Paul's, London, which considered a papal plea for a subsidy to finance a crusade against the Bohemians, various cases of heresy, and a royal request for money. He was there on 6 July, but on the 13th was deputed as an envoy to the papal curia. He was still abroad in December. His task was to arrange alliances with the king of Aragon, Alfonso V, and with Sigismund, king of the Romans. During his absence five criminous clerks escaped from his prison at Bishop's Stortford, taking their gaoler with them. For this he was amerced of a total of &pound;426 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., but in April 1429 the king respited payment for ten years. Early in 1431 Gray was again at a convocation in St Paul's, partly concerned with the examination of the heretical opinions held by Thomas Bagley, whom he had earlier caused to be arrested. Shortly thereafter he was translated to Lincoln by a bull of 30 April 1431, his temporalities being restored on 4 August.<br>
<br>Gray's Lincoln register, comprising some 221 folios, is understandably much more informative than his London register. He held a visitation of his cathedral chapter on 28 April 1432 and there are sporadic details of his having followed this up. Certainly his register includes a notable series of visitation injunctions for religious houses, which throw considerable light on the state of monastic observance at the time. To what extent this is an indication of particular diligence on his part is a matter of opinion, since the bulk of the work was carried out by commissaries. He attended the provincial convocation of 1432, which among other matters considered an increase in the delegation to be sent to the council at Basel, the support that should be given to voting there by &#145;nations&#146; rather than by &#145;deputations&#146;, and the raising of a subsidy for the English delegates. He was also at the following year's convocation, which debated the dissension between Pope Eugenius IV and the Council of Basel. The convocation of 1434 was adjourned due to the plague in London, where, on 19 October, Gray was one of four bishops who assented to the celebration throughout the province, with nine lessons according to the Sarum use, of the feast of St Frideswide, the particular patron of Oxford University.<br>
<br>At Lincoln Gray was again personally involved with cases of heresy arising from the spread of Lollard opinions as well as with monastic apostasy. In addition there was a long-standing quarrel between the residentiary canons of Lincoln and the arrogant and largely non-resident dean, John Mackworth, which despite efforts by Bishop Fleming had remained unresolved. The canons presented forty-one <i>gravamina</i> for Gray's mediation. His award required the dean to amend his defaults. But on 28 July, the eve of the feast of St Peter in whose honour the cathedral was dedicated, Mackworth arrived at vespers with a band of armed men who attacked the chancellor, Peter Partwich. Before he could deal with this outrage the bishop had died. In the following year Mackworth avoided further repercussions by exchanging the deanery for Tredington rectory in Worcester diocese. It may be an indication of Gray's expertise and trustworthiness that Philip Morgan, bishop of Ely, who made his will in October 1435, named him first among his executors.<br>
<br>Gray's own will is dated 11 February 1436 from his bed of sickness in the great chamber of his manor of Buckden, Huntingdonshire. He must have died shortly afterwards, since the latest entry in his register is dated 14 February. Probate ensued on 9 March. His wish was to be buried in the lady chapel of his cathedral church, between the entry and the great lectern. To that church he bequeathed a large frontal with an image of the Virgin, his patron, in its centre, together with a small one emblazoned with his own arms. These and other ecclesiastical ornaments and vestments were to be distributed in accordance with the discretion of his executors. Legacies of &pound;20 each were allotted to William Bothe, a canon of Lincoln, his chancellor Richard Moresby, and Thomas Dunkan, in compensation for their labours on his behalf. His residual legatee was his brother, Henry.<br>
<br>Politically a supporter of John, duke of Bedford, and of Cardinal Henry Beaufort, Gray was a regular member of the king's council&#151;at the end of 1433, at a time of financial crisis, he and two other bishops were persuaded to attend without payment during term-time&#151;and also sometimes went on embassies, for instance to Scotland in 1427. In 1433 he was one of a number of councillors who crossed to Calais for discussions of the situation in France. But, perhaps partly because he was frequently absent on royal business, it cannot be said that Gray was particularly distinguished as a diocesan bishop. Indeed, like many fifteenth-century bishops, his character is hard to determine. A. H. Thompson, in the course of editing the Lincoln visitations, concluded that his episcopate marked &#145;no important era in the history of the see&#146; of Lincoln  (Thompson, <span class="italic">Visitations</span>, 1.xvii).<br>
