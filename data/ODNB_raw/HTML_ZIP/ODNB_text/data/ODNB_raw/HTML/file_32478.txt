<span class="headword">Cohen, Sir  Andrew Benjamin</span>  (1909&#150;1968), <span class="occ">civil servant and colonial governor</span>, was born on 7 October 1909 at Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, the twin son of Walter Samuel Cohen (1870&#150;1960), financier and company director, and his wife, Lucy Margaret Cobb (1877&#150;1942). On his father's side he stemmed from a wealthy Jewish business family, and on his mother's, from a radical Unitarian family; the two strains combined in the son to produce an &eacute;litist with a social conscience. His elder sister Ruth Louisa was principal of Newnham College, Cambridge, from 1954 to 1972. He won a scholarship to Malvern College, and another to Trinity College, Cambridge, where, although his spiritual home was King's, he obtained a double first in the classical tripos (1930&#150;31). In 1932 he entered the civil service, where he spent a year as an assistant principal at the Board of Inland Revenue, before transferring to the Colonial Office to join the other classical scholars under Charles Jeffries.<br>
<br>For the next few years Cohen inhaled trusteeship with the dust on the African files; and he came to sympathize with the black African rather than the white settler. Contemptuous of colour bars, he was shocked by how little the colonial trustees seemed to him to have done for Africans in Rhodesia. For a time he was private secretary to Sir John Maffey, the permanent under-secretary; and he also visited central Africa as secretary to a financial commission. As an acting principal in 1939, he was chosen for a Commonwealth Fund fellowship to visit America, but his schedule was cut short by the outbreak of the Second World War. In 1940 he was sent to organize supplies during the siege of Malta, deputizing at times for the lieutenant-governor. It was his first taste of power (for which he was voracious), in an embattled government organizing a society to meet an emergency; the experience left him with a Fabian socialist's view of the state's duty to reorganize the social order. In 1943 he returned to the Colonial Office as an assistant secretary, to take part in post-war African planning.<br>
<br>By 1947, when he was appointed assistant under-secretary of state for the Colonial Office's African division, Cohen's vision for Africa was sharply defined. It seemed to him vital, in the interests of both Britain and Africa, to turn the colonies into self-governing nations within &#145;the next generation&#146;. As head of the division and <i>alter ego</i> of his minister, Arthur Creech Jones, he helped to prepare a report for tropical Africa, in which he was able to give this meaning to the colonial shibboleths of the Labour Party. There were many in the euphoria of peace who wished to make colonies into modern welfare states and bring them into production to repair the ravaged United Kingdom economy. Cohen was one of the few who realized that colonial rule would have to be nationalized if those aims were to be fulfilled. Alien officials could never do so, he insisted, through petty chiefs; to achieve them, the excluded but educated African who understood modern ideas must be brought into partnership, and his price would be the most rapid possible transfer of power. As a realist, Cohen discerned that the age of empire was ended; as a moralist, he resolved to end it constructively.<br>
<br>African nationalists seemed a derisory band at the time, and some governors objected bitterly to the new course; to educate the colonial civil service there, Creech Jones and Cohen began the <span class="italic">Journal of African Administration</span>, and the annual conferences at Cambridge. They were prepared to concede power to progressive nationalist movements, but as a result of the Accra riots of 1948, the ballot box and a quasi-ministerial system were introduced in the Gold Coast earlier than intended; the extreme nationalists won the election and Kwame Nkrumah left gaol to become leader of government. What had been conceded in Ghana could not then be denied to Nigeria, and a &#145;domino effect&#146; spread throughout British west Africa. Thus Cohen's plan, designed to educate the national movements gradually into responsibility, provoked them into swift action. By 1951 west Africa at least was set on course to self-government, although fifteen years later, contemplating the one-party states and military coups, Cohen was depressed by the outcome. Like many of Africa's friends, he had overestimated the power of the nationalists to transcend ethnic divisions and behave democratically in the Westminster tradition.<br>
<br>For central Africa, Cohen's construct in 1948&#150;51 was more realistic if the outcome was less fortunate. Fearful of a white unilateral declaration of independence, and of apartheid spreading from South Africa, he advocated a confederation of the Rhodesias and Nyasaland: power was to be transferred to the white minority on condition that it was shared with the African majority. A version of the plan was carried out in 1953 after he had left the Colonial Office; but the offer of &#145;half a loaf&#146; so angered Africans that Kenneth Kaunda and Hastings Banda could organize nationalist movements strong enough to break the association ten years later and achieve majority rule, save in Southern Rhodesia.<br>
<br>In September 1951, after James Griffiths had replaced Creech Jones as colonial secretary following the general election of 1950, Cohen was appointed governor of Uganda and sworn in early in 1952. Although he disliked the ceremonial, he gladly practised in the field what he had preached in Whitehall; Africans and Asians were invited to Government House and advanced in central government; Makerere was developed into a university to strengthen the educated cadre; local authorities were made more democratic, which encouraged political parties and national consciousness. But in underestimating the strength of traditional loyalty and deporting the <i>kabaka</i> of Buganda in 1953, only to restore him later on constitutional conditions, Cohen was strongly criticized on all sides, although when he finally left Uganda early in 1957 the foundations for independence were securely laid, and indeed the Ugandans themselves petitioned for his term of office to be extended.<br>
<br>Disappointed in his hope of a Labour seat in parliament, and despite being an unlikely choice as a diplomat, Cohen was appointed permanent representative (1957&#150;60) on the Trusteeship Council at the United Nations. But he seemed to have been put on the shelf, and he did not always find it easy to square the representations which the Foreign Office instructed him to make with his personal convictions. In 1959 he published <span class="italic">British Policy in Changing Africa</span>, and, given his natural affinity with liberal Americans and his candid and widespread working relations with African and Asian leaders, he discovered another way to serve African independence: the idea of international and Commonwealth co-operation in aid of modernizing Africa captured his mind. In helping to link American aid to British schemes for developing east Africa, especially in university education, he took up the concepts of the United Nations &#145;development decade&#146;. It was fitting, therefore, that he was recalled to Whitehall in 1961 to set up a department of technical co-operation, which took over most of the old Colonial Office's non-political functions. In 1964 the department was transformed into a Ministry of Overseas Development, with Cohen as its permanent secretary; he carried out the organization of first one establishment and then the other with his usual dynamic enthusiasm.<br>
<br>In 1949 Cohen married Mrs Helen Phoebe Donington (<i>d</i>. 1978) JP, commander of the order of St John of Jerusalem, only daughter of George Hope Stevenson, praelector in ancient history at University College, Oxford (1907&#150;49); Cohen was as affectionate towards his three stepchildren as towards their own son (born in 1950). His marriage brought him closer to Bloomsbury and the political left. He was appointed OBE in 1942, CMG in 1948, and was advanced to KCMG in 1952; he was also appointed KCVO (1954), and received the honorary degree of LLD from the Queen's University, Belfast, in 1960.<br>
<br>Cohen was cut out to be a planner, even a philosopher king, and if reading lyric verse on an antique Mediterranean island may have been his private Elysium, he admired intellect most; arrogantly intellectual, and avid for original ideas, if they were to engage his excellent mind they had to be practical in shaping better things to come. With a heroic image of himself as idea in action&#151;compounded of Carlyle and Euripides&#151;Cambridge and Malta combined to make him unflinchingly realistic in finding means to achieve a passionately speculative vision of ultimate ends. Of giant stature, appetite, and energy, boyish in charm and enthusiasm, the intellectual dreamer of the Colonial Office was one of the most anti-colonial and unofficial of the imperial officials who finally dismantled the tropical African empire. In one way or another his measures helped to awaken the slumbering genius of African nationalism, and, wittingly or unwittingly, he did more to bring about the fall of empire and the rise of the nationalists than most African politicians were able to achieve between them. Not for nothing did his biographer dub him &#145;The proconsul of African nationalism&#146;  (Robinson, &#145;Sir Andrew Cohen&#146;).<br>
<br>Cohen died suddenly at his home, 44 Blomfield Road, Maida Vale, London, on 17 June 1968.<br>
