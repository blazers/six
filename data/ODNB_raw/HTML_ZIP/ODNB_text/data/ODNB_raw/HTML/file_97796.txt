<span class="headword">Orr,  Robert Kemsley <span class="st"> [Robin]</span></span>  (1909&#150;2006), <span class="occ">composer and musical administrator</span>, was born on 2 June 1909 at Glebe House, Trinity Road, Brechin, Forfarshire, the elder child of Robert Workman Orr, linen manufacturer, and his wife, Florence Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kemsley, who came from a farming family in Essex. His sister Kirsteen was born in 1911. Both his parents were amateur musicians and Orr's first taste of music was in regular family musical evenings in the home. After a few years at Brechin high school he was sent to a preparatory school, Hurst Grange, in Stirling. There he was taught music by J. W. Kinnear, who encouraged his first attempts at composition. From Stirling he went to Loretto School, on the outskirts of Edinburgh. At that time there was little to encourage the young musician there, so he left early and studied privately before entering the Royal College of Music, in London, at the age of sixteen. There he studied organ with Walter Alcock, piano with Arthur Benjamin, and composition with Henry Moule. In 1929 he became organ scholar at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he came under the influence of Cyril Rootham and Edward Dent. Later he studied with Alfredo Casella in Siena and with Nadia Boulanger in Paris. From 1933 to 1936 he was director of music at Sidcot School in Somerset. He was then an assistant lecturer in music at the University of Leeds (1936&#150;8) before becoming organist and director of studies in music at St John's College, Cambridge. On 29 December 1937 he had married Margaret Ellen Mace, the 24-year-old daughter of the Egyptologist Arthur Cruttenden Mace. They had three children, twins, Alison and David (<i>b</i>. 1940), and Jean Kirsteen (<i>b</i>. 1945).<br>
<br>During the Second World War Orr served as a photographic intelligence officer in the RAF. On demobilization with the rank of flight lieutenant in 1945 he returned to Cambridge, where he was appointed university lecturer in music (1947&#150;56) and became a fellow of St John's in 1948. It was during those post-war years that he began to devote more of his time to serious composition. Professorships followed at the Royal College of Music (1950&#150;56), at the University of Glasgow (1956&#150;65), and at Cambridge (1965&#150;76). He was also founder chairman of Scottish Opera (1962&#150;76), director of the Cambridge Arts Theatre (1970&#150;75), and a director of Welsh National Opera (1977&#150;83). He was elected to honorary fellowships at St John's and Pembroke colleges, Cambridge, and was appointed CBE in 1972. His first marriage ended in divorce in 1979, and on 14 July the same year he married Doris Ruth Winny-Meyer, a 56-year-old art historian from Switzerland, and daughter of Leo Meyer, watch manufacturer.<br>
<br>Notwithstanding Orr's gifts as a musical administrator and the consequent demands on his time and energies, he still found time to produce a formidable output of interesting and assured works in a language very much his own. Although marked by a passing resemblance to other composers, which makes his music quite difficult to categorize, there is an innate sense of lyricism and Scottish grittiness that runs through many of his important works. He had a certain success with his first orchestral venture, the overture <span class="italic">The Prospect of Whitby</span> (1948), but the orchestral work that brought him into prominence was the <span class="italic">Symphony in One Movement</span> (1963) which, although modelled on Sibelius's seventh symphony, was in no way a mere shadow of this work. It has drama and a lucid compactness which appealed to audiences of the time. Championed by Sir Alexander Gibson and the Scottish National Orchestra (as were so many of Orr's orchestral works) it had several performances by this orchestra. Two more symphonies were to follow, also both in one movement, in 1970 and 1978.<br>
<br>Orr's first opera, <span class="italic">Full Circle</span>, in one act, to a libretto in Scottish dialogue by Sydney Goodsir Smith, was commissioned by Scottish Television and premi&egrave;red by Scottish Opera in 1968. It shared a double bill with Stravinsky's <span class="italic">The Soldier's Tale</span>, and had a similar sparse orchestration. It also broke new ground by being set in the Scots vernacular, which few composers had attempted before. A more ambitious three-act opera, <span class="italic">Hermiston</span>, followed in 1975. The libretto was by Bill Bryden, after Robert Louis Stevenson's <span class="italic">The Weir of Hermiston</span>, and it was premi&egrave;red at the Edinburgh international festival. Its bleak drama and scenes of a hanging, rape, murder, madness, and suicide, probably contributed to its failure to find a regular place in the repertoire. Nevertheless it showed Orr's growing mastery of the operatic genre. His next opera, an adaptation of Tom Stoppard's comic <span class="italic">On the Razzle</span> (1988), was brilliantly produced by the students of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow, and enjoyed a greater success.<br>
<br>Orr excelled in music for the church, much of it written for St John's College. For its 450th anniversary he wrote a fine anthem &#145;Come and let yourselves be built&#146; (1961). In addition there were songs and chamber and instrumental music, as well as a <span class="italic">Rhapsody</span> (1956) for string orchestra, and a delightful song cycle, <span class="italic">From the Book of Philip Sparrow</span> (1969), for mezzo-soprano and strings, which was premi&egrave;red by Janet Baker and the Scottish National Orchestra.<br>
<br>Orr's approach to teaching and administration was the opposite of didactic. His generous nature and open-mindedness made him much sought after as a champion of new music and as someone who could get things done. During his nine years in Glasgow he teamed up with the young Alexander Gibson, who had just taken over as musical director of the Scottish National Orchestra, and assisted him with his Musica Viva concerts. These concerts brought Stockhausen, Sch&ouml;nberg, Stravinsky, and several Scottish composers including Iain Hamilton, Thea Musgrave, and Orr himself into prominence with the Scottish public. When Gibson approached him for support with the formation of Scottish Opera in 1960, Orr enthusiastically agreed. The company became highly successful and at the time of his death, in spite of government cuts, was still one of the most successful of British opera companies.<br>
<br>Robin Orr was a man who had time for many other interests besides music. After an article he wrote for the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> concerning a visit to the Wexford festival, and mentioning at length its gastronomic and liquid delights, he was invited by the editor to write a weekly food column. This was followed by other invitations from gastronomical journals eager to share his knowledge and experience. His reputation as a bon vivant was legendary and he endeared himself to many as a perfect and generous host, as well as a delightful raconteur. To those who didn't know him well, he often gave the impression of being a little vague, but beneath this he was the shrewdest of men who had a rare gift for dealing quite quickly with the poseur and the bore. In later life he enjoyed walking in the Swiss Alps (he took Swiss nationality in 1995) near his second home in Klosters. There he composed his last orchestral work, <span class="italic">Sinfonietta Helvetica</span> (1990), to mark the 700th anniversary of the Swiss confederation. His musical autobiography, <span class="italic">Musical Chairs</span>, was published in 1998. He died at the Cambridge Nursing Centre, 5 High Street, Chesterton, Cambridge, on 9 April 2006, of a urinary tract infection, and was survived by his wife, Doris, and the three children of his first marriage. Orr's funeral was held at Pembroke College, Cambridge, and a memorial service took place at St John's College, Cambridge, on 4 November 2006.<br>
