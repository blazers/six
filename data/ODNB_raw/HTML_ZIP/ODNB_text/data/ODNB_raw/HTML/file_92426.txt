<span class="headword">Sackville <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Curzon]</span>,  Mary</span>, countess of Dorset  (<em>bap. </em>1586, <em>d.</em> 1645), <span class="occ">royal governess</span>, was baptized at Trentham, Staffordshire, on 11 December 1586, the daughter and heir of Sir George Curzon of Croxhall, Derbyshire, and Mary Leveson. On 20 May 1606 her father transacted a marriage agreement with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24450/', "Thomas Sackville, first earl of Dorset")</script>, by which she was betrothed to his grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24444/', "Edward Sackville, from 1624 fourth earl of Dorset (1590&#150;1652)")</script>. The marriage had taken place by 2 March 1612.<br>
<br>The fourth earl was lord chamberlain of Queen Henrietta Maria's household from July 1628, and in July 1630 the countess of Dorset was appointed governess to the prince of Wales, replacing <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70617/', "Jane Ker, countess of Roxburghe")</script>, whose Catholicism had disqualified her for the office. On 10 July 1630 John Flower reported to Viscount Scudamore that the countess of Dorset had &#145;seldome beene a courtier before, but allwaies soe much honoured for her virtues, as everie one is glad that she is in her place&#146;  (TNA: PRO, C 115/M31/8126). The countess quickly &#145;settled into hir charge&#146;  (17 July 1630, ibid.), yet the king reverted to Lady Roxburgh as governess to Princess Mary in November 1631. It seems that the appointment of a Catholic governess was thought acceptable for royal daughters, but not for sons. Thus in October 1633 the infant duke of York was also entrusted to the countess of Dorset, and she and her husband led the guests at his baptism in November. Provisions delivered to the countess for the two boys included &#145;a cradle of crimson damasque with gold and silver fringe&#146;, and &#145;six payre of fine Holland sheets each payre containing twenty-four elles and six payre of pillowbeeres&#146;  (TNA: PRO, LC 5/134, pp. 152, 246).<br>
<br>Much of the countess's daily business throughout the 1630s stemmed from her role as governess. For example, on 1 August 1637 she wrote to Sir Thomas Wentworth in Ireland, requesting that one of the duke of York's servants be excused &#145;from coming over into Ireland untill&#146; the following spring, on the grounds that the duke had so few servants that &#145;he cannot well be spared&#146;  (countess of Dorset to Wentworth, 1 August 1637, Strafford papers, 17/146). The countess was also able to exercise some degree of patronage: in April 1638, for instance, she procured a letter missive under the signet granting George Worley &#145;a scholar's place&#146; at Sutton's Hospital  (TNA: PRO, SO 3/11, April 1638). She apparently enjoyed a high personal reputation, and a manuscript libel of 1636, while alleging that the earl of Dorset &#145;gives his soule for a whore&#146;, claimed that the countess &#145;of gravity hath store&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 6383, fol. 49<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Although in 1642 the earl of Dorset joined the king at York and then at Oxford, along with the prince of Wales and the duke of York, the countess remained in London, and in July 1643 the houses of parliament confirmed her appointment as governess to the younger royal children, Henry, duke of Gloucester, and Princess Elizabeth. This position secured her a maintenance well above the fifth part automatically granted to the wives and children of royalist &#145;delinquents&#146;. On 17 May 1644 the House of Lords heard a petition from the countess &#145;desiring that the sequestration of [the earl of Dorset's] lands in Sussex may be taken off, out of which she is to have maintenance&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 6.556). The Lords sent the petition to the Commons, who in turn referred it to the committee for the king's revenue and then, on 18 March 1645, to the committee for the king's children. On 14 April the latter committee reported to the Lords, conceiving it<blockquote>fitting that the Countesse of Dorsett in consideracon of hir service to his Ma[jes]t[ie]s children the Duke of Gloucester and Princesse Elizabeth, and for hir future maintenance, shall enjoy the Earle of Dorsetts estate in the Countie of Sussex &hellip; provided that if it appeare the profitts of the said lands doe exceed the summe of six hundred pounds per ann[um] then the overplus thereof shall bee paid to the use of the Parliament.</blockquote>The countess was also to enjoy Dorset House in London and Knole in Kent, and the goods in them  (ibid., 7.317). Since the total income from Dorset's Sussex estates was about &pound;2000 per annum, this was a discretionary grant, well above the mandatory fifth. Such an arrangement, whereby a royalist's estates were safeguarded during the period of his wife's employment under parliament's aegis, appears to have been unique.<br>
<br>The countess died shortly afterwards, on 16 May 1645. The Commons ordered that &pound;600 &#145;be paid out of the arrears of the Earl of Dorset's estate in Sussex&#146; for her funeral  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 4.211, 227). This took place with great pomp in Westminster Abbey on 3 September 1645, and the countess was afterwards buried in the Sackville family crypt in the Dorset chapel at Withyam in Sussex.<br>
