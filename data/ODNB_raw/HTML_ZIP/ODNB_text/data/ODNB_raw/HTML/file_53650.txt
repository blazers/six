<span class="headword">Sharpe,  Sam</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1832), <span class="occ">rebel slave leader</span>, was born in Jamaica. He officially belonged to Croydon estate in St James parish, but worked as a domestic slave in Montego Bay, the second largest town in the island. Literate and intelligent, he was also a passionate and charismatic speaker. Sharpe became a class leader in the Montego Bay Baptist Church; his duties included helping the British missionary Thomas Burchell with the supervision of membership classes. At the same time, Sharpe was a &#145;Daddy&#146; or &#145;ruler&#146; among the independent black-led Native Baptists.<br>
<br>From his reading of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, Sharpe became convinced that slavery was morally wrong. He helped to spread the view that the crown had already freed the slaves and that the local white people were withholding that freedom. Accordingly, Sharpe planned a campaign of passive resistance for the period just after Christmas in 1831: the slaves would simply cease work until their owners paid their wages and thereby conceded that the slaves were free. However, Sharpe developed an alternative strategy of armed rebellion in case passive resistance failed. His chief allies included other &eacute;lite slaves, many of whom were also Baptists and Native Baptists.<br>
<br>The rebellion which broke out on 27 December 1831 was massive: it involved 20,000 slaves and spread over 750 square miles of the richest sugar-growing area of Jamaica. Although the slaves enjoyed some initial successes, the rebellion was quickly and ferociously suppressed. At least 540 slaves were killed, while fourteen white inhabitants lost their lives. By the end of January 1832 Sharpe was in custody; he was tried on 19 April and hanged on 23 May. A missionary who interviewed him in gaol described Sharpe as &#145;certainly the most intelligent and most remarkable slave [he] ever met with&#146;  (Bleby, 115). Before his death Sharpe declared that he &#145;would rather die upon yonder gallows than live in slavery&#146;  (ibid., 116). Although Sharpe did not live to see the end of slavery, the rebellion had a significant effect in promoting the cause of emancipation. One week after Sharpe's death, the House of Commons established a committee to look into the best means of abolishing slavery.<br>
