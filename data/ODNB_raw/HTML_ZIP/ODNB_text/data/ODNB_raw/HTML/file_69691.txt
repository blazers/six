<span class="headword">Strang <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Carr]</span>,  Barbara Mary Hope</span>, Lady Strang  (1925&#150;1982), <span class="occ">English language scholar</span>, born on 20 April 1925 at 18 Belvedere Road, Penge, London, was the only child of Frederick Albert Carr, of Wimbledon, and his wife, Amy Maud Wood. Her father was an engineer who suffered unemployment in the 1930s. She grew up in Shirley in Surrey, and was educated at Coloma Convent of the Ladies of Mary, Croydon, which early in the war was evacuated to Wales. She entered King's College, London, in 1942, and spent a year in Bristol until the college returned to the Strand. At King's she was introduced to the Anglican liturgy, which had a lasting influence. She obtained her BA degree in 1945, and then her MA in 1947 with an extended study of the historic Kentish dialects, under the direction of Professor C. L. Wrenn.<br>
<br>Barbara Carr was assistant lecturer at Westfield College, University of London, from 1947 to 1950, and then lecturer at King's College, Newcastle (then part of the University of Durham), from 1950 to 1963. There she met Colin Strang (<i>b</i>. 1922), then a lecturer in philosophy, whom she married on 21 April 1955. He was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31729/', "Sir William Strang")</script>, head of the Foreign Office, who had been created Baron Strang of Stonesfield in 1954, and on his death in 1978 Colin inherited the title as second Baron Strang. They had one child, a daughter, Caroline Jane (<i>b</i>. 1957).<br>
<br>Strang's first major publication was <span class="italic">Modern English Structure</span> (1962), which showed her &#145;unique integration of descriptive and historical approaches&#146;  (Nixon and Honey, xii). It rapidly became a standard work, and met its declared aim of being &#145;useful to elementary students without offending against the standards of professional linguists&#146;  (Strang, <span class="italic">Modern English Structure</span>, introduction) and communicating with &#145;students whose central interests lie elsewhere&#146;  (ibid.). Compared with older works it is less narrowly restricted to phonology and morphology, and does justice to new developments in the study of sentence patterns, the noun and verb phrase, &#145;kernel&#146; structures, and transformations. It is based on copious examples of actual usage, insists on the primacy of speech, and brings out the role of language in everyday life. It effectively succeeds in its intention of cultivating &#145;humane, sensible and scholarly attitudes to language&#146;  (ibid., conclusion).<br>
<br>In 1964 Strang was appointed professor of English language and general linguistics at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, the first chair of its kind in England, just as she was one of the first women to hold such a post. In her inaugural lecture, &#145;Metaphors and models&#146;, she noted that &#145;in linguistics the nineteenth century was dominantly concerned with the study of history, characteristically advanced by the study of metaphors&#146;, whereas &#145;the twentieth century has been dominantly concerned with the study of structure, increasingly advanced by means of models&#146;. Her own scholarship combined these two approaches and, in a period marked by many new developments in linguistics, she and her department quickly gained an international reputation and attracted visitors from far afield. One of her closest associates was Professor Randolph Quirk, who had known her since they were students together.<br>
<br>Strang next published <span class="italic">A History of English</span> (1970), the fruit of twenty years' deep learning. This took account of the international spread of English and adopted the novel procedure of working back from contemporary English, with its advantage of being within the reader's experience, to the older periods of the language. Her later research topics included the linguistic analysis of such writers as Swift, Spenser, Shakespeare, and John Clare, and she was instrumental in forming the Tyneside Linguistic Survey. She contributed to, among other periodicals, <span class="italic">Transactions of the Philological Society</span>, <span class="italic">Durham</span>, <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>, <span class="italic">English Studies Today</span>, and <span class="italic">Lingua</span>.<br>
<br>Strang was also active in administration and was a member of the University Grants Committee (1947&#150;50), and the Hong Kong university and polytechnic grants committee from 1981. Colleagues found her always helpful, and many students benefited from postgraduate funding privately supported by herself and her husband. Her recreations included horsemanship, which replaced her childhood liking for ballet. On 11 April 1982 she was suddenly struck down by a cerebral haemorrhage, and died the next day, aged fifty-six, at her home, Station House, Angerton, Morpeth. The funeral was at the West Road crematorium, Newcastle upon Tyne. Her husband and daughter survived her.<br>
<br>Randolph Quirk, who knew her for thirty-five years, wrote of her that &#145;she combined a rare and precious set of qualities. Sparkling intellect and originality. Profound moral strength. Unshakable dedication to the most demanding standards of scholarship. Generosity. Loyalty. And sense of fun&#146;  (Nixon and Honey, foreword).<br>
