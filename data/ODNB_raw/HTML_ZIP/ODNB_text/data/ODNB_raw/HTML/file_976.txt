<span class="headword">Babington, Sir  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1370&#150;1454), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was from an ancient Northumberland family, whose members had, by the mid-fourteenth century, abandoned their interests there in favour first of Cambridgeshire and then of Nottinghamshire, where they had long held a manor at Rolleston near Newark. His father, John, married a Cambridgeshire bride but was buried in the Nottinghamshire church of East Bridgford. William's marriage to Margery, heir of the Martels of Chilwell, confirmed the shift of the family's interests, for she brought to the family the manors of Chilwell and Ruddington near Nottingham. Of age by 1395, William pursued a highly successful legal career, which enabled him to extend these landholdings greatly. By 1408 he was retained as an apprentice-at-law by the duchy of Lancaster; in January 1414 he was appointed king's attorney; and in June 1415 he became deputy chief steward of the northern parts of the duchy. In the following month he and others were called by the crown to take up the degree of serjeant-at-law. Their refusal, on grounds that are unclear, led to their appearance in parliament in November 1417, where they were obliged to accept the honour.<br>
<br>Thereafter Babington's promotion was rapid. A year's service as king's serjeant was followed, in November 1419, by appointment as chief baron of the exchequer, and, in June 1420, by elevation to a seat on the common bench. Three years later, in May 1423, he became the chief justice of that court, a position he held until his retirement in February 1436, and, at the dubbing of Henry VI on Whitsunday 1426, he received the further honour of the Order of the Bath. He exploited his success not only to extend his estates through the purchase of several manors in Bedfordshire, Nottinghamshire, and Derbyshire, but also to find a remarkable series of wealthy brides for his sons and his younger brothers. The most noteworthy of these marriages was that of his son John to Maud, granddaughter of Eleanor, heir of the barony of St Amand, and hence, on the death of Maud's father, Gerard Braybrooke, in 1422, one of the three coheiresses of that barony. Only the couple's childless death prevented a further substantial addition to the Babington lands. The chief justice's influence probably also explains the marriage of his brother Thomas to one of the two daughters and coheirs of Robert Dethick of Dethick in Derbyshire. The Catholic conspirator, Sir Anthony Babington (<i>d</i>. 1586), was a direct descendant of this marriage in the male line.<br>
<br>On William's retirement from the bench in 1436, he was probably in his early sixties, and advanced age explains why little is known of him in the last years of his life. A comparison of the tax returns of 1436 and 1451 shows that, before the latter date, he had made over the bulk of his estates to his son and heir, William: in 1436 he was assessed on an annual income of &pound;160 but by 1451 his assessment had fallen to &pound;40 p.a., while that of his son had risen from &pound;37 to &pound;100 p.a. He drew up a short and uninformative will on 3 October 1454, directing burial in the newly built chapel of St Mary in the church of the monastery of Lenton, and died a few days later (his will was proved on 10 October but the jurors in his inquisition <i>post mortem</i> give his date of death as 13 October). His money and goods to the value of 600 marks were employed by his executors in the foundation of a chantry in the church of Flawford (demolished in 1773) in the parish of Ruddington.<br>
