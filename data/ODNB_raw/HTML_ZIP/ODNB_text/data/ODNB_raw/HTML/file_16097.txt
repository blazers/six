<span class="headword">Lathbury,  Thomas</span>  (1798&#150;1865), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and ecclesiastical historian</span>, was born at Brackley, Northamptonshire, the only son of Henry Lathbury. On 7 April 1821 he matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, graduating BA in 1824 and MA in 1827. Having taken holy orders, he held curacies at Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, Bath, and Wootton, Northamptonshire. In 1831 he was appointed curate at Mangotsfield, Gloucestershire, and in 1838 curate at the abbey church, Bath. In 1848 he was presented by the bishop of Gloucester and Bristol to the perpetual curacy of St Simon and St Jude, Bristol.<br>
<br>A liturgical scholar and antiquarian collector of printed service books, Lathbury was the author of numerous works of both ecclesiastical and liturgical history and of more popular polemic. Some of his writings were learned treatises or editions of older texts, and reflected his antiquarian and liturgical interests and historical sympathies. This category of his writings included such works as an edition of the nonjuror Jeremy Collier's <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical History of Great Britain</span>, with a life of the author (1852) and <span class="italic">A History of the Book of Common Prayer</span> (1858). Lathbury's more popular works consisted of anti-Catholic polemic, including the best-selling <span class="italic">Protestantism the Old Religion, Popery the New</span> (1838), <span class="italic">Guy Fawkes, or, A Complete History of the Gunpowder Plot</span> (1839; 2nd edn, 1840), and <span class="italic">The Spanish armada, <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 1588, or, The attempt of Philip II and Pope Sixtus V to re-establish popery in England</span> (1840).<br>
<br>As a writer, Lathbury suffered from apprehensions over defects in his literary skills. He could be meticulous in attention to detail but lacked originality, and a reviewer in the <span class="italic">British Critic</span> considered that his <span class="italic">History of English Episcopacy</span> (1836), his most significant work, exhibited &#145;no great power of writing&#146;, although he also commended the work as a perspicacious and dispassionate account of its subject. Lathbury's <span class="italic">History of the Nonjurors: their Controversies and Writings</span> (1845) represents his most accomplished work. Based on wide reading and knowledge of the sources, its particular value lies in its exposition of nonjuring political thought. It has been considered one of the most accurate and informative histories of the nonjurors.<br>
<br>Lathbury was a non-party, moderate, and not untypical protestant churchman of his generation. His <span class="italic">History of English Episcopacy</span> was praised in the Irish Anglican evangelical journal the <span class="italic">Christian Examiner</span> (February 1837, 129) because of its adherence to the &#145;moderate principles of Ecclesiastical polity &hellip; Preserving a due medium between the Latitudinarians on the one side, and the Altitudinarians on the other &hellip; and attached to the constitutional doctrines of the old Revolution Whigs&#146;. Suspicious of the Oxford Movement, he in 1838 wrote warmly in defence of the proposed protestant Martyr's Memorial in Oxford against its Tractarian critics. Alarm at what he regarded as the rise of popery in the 1830s prompted his numerous works of anti-Catholic polemic. Although orthodox and not latitudinarian in his churchmanship, Lathbury's <span class="italic">History of English Episcopacy</span> was criticized by its high-church <span class="italic">British Critic</span> reviewer for exhibiting a &#145;rationalising&#146; tendency. The features of the work which earned the <span class="italic">Christian Examiner's</span> praise, such as his regarding Laud's notions of divine-right episcopacy as a &#145;novelty&#146; and his apparent over-indulgence of continental protestant churches, caused offence to the high-church reviewer  (<span class="italic">British Critic</span>, 1836, 342&#150;3). Lathbury himself offered an article on various works concerning church reform and unity to the then editor of the <span class="italic">British Critic</span>, J. S. Boone, but it was not published. Despite his misgivings about the Tractarians, Lathbury offered another article, a review of Thomas Price's <span class="italic">History of Protestant Nonconformity</span> (1836&#150;8) to J. H. Newman as editor in February 1838. Newman commended the article for its style and learning, but rejected it because of &#145;the general line of opinion&#146; manifested in it. He explained the main ground of his difference&#151;that he [Newman] viewed &#145;the church less in the light of an Establishment&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Diaries</span>, 6.199).<br>
<br>Lathbury's moderate high-church credentials, however, were demonstrated in his cautious sympathy for the nonjurors (<span class="italic">History of the Nonjurors</span>), and in the attack on the protestant nonconformist attempt to make capital out of the bicentenary of the St Bartholomew's day ejections of nonconformist ministers in 1662 contained in his <span class="italic">Facts and Fictions of the Bicentenary: a Sketch from 1640 to 1662</span> (1862). He followed this up with another anti-dissenting polemic, <span class="italic">Oliver Cromwell, or, The old and new dissenters, with strictures on the lectures of N. Haycroft and H. Quick</span> (1862). Lathbury's firm churchmanship found its most practical expression in his championship of the church congress held at Bristol in September 1864.<br>
<br>Lathbury died at his residence, 3 Cave Street, Portland Square, Bristol, on 11 February 1865. His stipend at the time of his death amounted to little more than &pound;150 per annum. He left a widow and four children, three of them sons. The eldest son, Daniel Connor Lathbury, became a barrister and journalist, and was the editor of <span class="italic">Correspondence on Church and Religion of William Ewart Gladstone</span> (1910).<br>
