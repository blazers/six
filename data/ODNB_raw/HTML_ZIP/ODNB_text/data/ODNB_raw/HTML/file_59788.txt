<span class="headword">Brock,  (Arthur) Guy  Clutton-</span>  (1906&#150;1995), <span class="occ">agriculturist and political activist</span>, was born on 5 April 1906 at Lake View, Green Lane, Ruislip, Middlesex, the son of Henry Alan Clutton-Brock, stockbroker, and his wife, Rosa Gertrude Eleanor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bowles. He was educated at Rugby School and, from 1924 to 1927, at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he read history. At one point he contemplated ordination and went briefly to Ripon Hall, Oxford, but he took up boys' club work instead, first at Cambridge House and then at Rugby House. He entered the borstal service in 1933, and in 1936 became principal probation officer for the Metropolitan Police court district. Meanwhile, on 14 April 1934 he married Francys Mary (Molly) Allen (1912&#150;2013), daughter of John Nelson Allen, merchant. They had one daughter, Sarah (Sally).<br>
<br>A convinced pacifist, Clutton-Brock worked during the Second World War as head of the Oxford House settlement in Bethnal Green, establishing a training community centre. In 1944 he was appointed by the Allied Control Commission for Germany to direct relief for starving and homeless young people, and in 1946 he continued this work with Christian Reconstruction in Europe. He became convinced that the young needed direct contact with the land. He returned to England in 1947 to work as an agricultural labourer and market gardener.<br>
<br>In 1949 Clutton-Brock was invited to go to St Faith's Mission, near Rusape, Southern Rhodesia, where the Anglican mission farm was run down and threatened with a government take-over. His experience of agriculture had been as a labourer rather than as a manager. He did not run St Faith's farm as an agri-business. Instead he set up a non-racial co-operative farm. He summoned the men back from migrant labour in the towns. One of them, John Mutasa, became the farm manager. Much to the horror of the district commissioner and local white people, Clutton-Brock and his wife became part of a vibrant non-racial community. She set up a clinic for disabled children. He organized a debating society and invited politicians, chiefs, bishops, and professors to address weekend conferences. Ideas bubbled at St Faith's, and the young leaders of the emerging African nationalist movement came to the conferences and stayed on to talk with Clutton-Brock. He helped draft the constitution of the Southern Rhodesian African National Congress (ANC) and joined it when it was established in September 1957.<br>
<br>Clutton-Brock's personality was very attractive to young nationalists such as George Nyandoro, Robert Chikerema, and Robert Mugabe. He was wise rather than clever; humble but sure of what he believed; supportive without ever wanting to take a lead. He was absolutely trusted, respected, and revered. The Rhodesian regime, however, could not understand the motives of anyone who worked with Africans on terms of equality. In March 1959 the ANC was banned and 500 of its leaders and members were detained, Guy Clutton-Brock among them. He spent a month in prison, and on release became chairman of the Southern Rhodesia Detainees Legal Aid and Welfare Committee. Also in 1959 he published <span class="italic">Dawn in Nyasaland</span> and <span class="italic">Facing 1960 in Central Africa</span>, in both of which he set out his belief in multi-racialism.<br>
<br>In 1960, supported by the African Development Trust, Clutton-Brock went to Botswana and began a co-operative there. He also helped in the establishment of the Bamangwato Development Association. But Southern Rhodesia had become his home and he returned in 1964. By this time the nationalist parties had been banned and leaders like Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo were in prison or restriction. Clutton-Brock kept the spirit of collaborative nationalism alive by inspiring another co-operative at Cold Comfort Farm, in a designated &#145;European&#146; area only 8 miles from the Rhodesian capital, Salisbury. Young nationalists like Didymus Mutasa&#151;later speaker of the Zimbabwe parliament&#151;gained leadership experience at Cold Comfort. The daughter co-operative farm at Nyafaru on the north-eastern border with Mozambique brought Clutton-Brock into contact with Chief Rekayi Tangwena and his people, who were resisting eviction from their land. He became a major supporter and publicist for the Tangwena, publishing <span class="italic">Rekayi Tangwena: Let Tangwena be</span> in 1969. (Later, in 1975, Robert Mugabe escaped into Mozambique to join the guerrilla war by way of the Nyafaru co-operative.)<br>
<br>These activities became intolerable to the Smith regime and in January 1971 the Cold Comfort Society was declared illegal. Didymus Mutasa was imprisoned, and spent two years in detention without trial. Clutton-Brock was declared a prohibited immigrant. He and his wife were deported to Britain, where they settled in a farm labourer's cottage in north Wales. They led a simple life there but Clutton-Brock maintained a vast correspondence with Rhodesians both inside the country and in Mozambique. The leaders of all Rhodesia's many nationalist parties trusted him. He lobbied the British government and raised funds for relief in Mozambique. After Rhodesia's independence in 1980 as Zimbabwe the Clutton-Brocks decided not to return, other than for a brief visit, believing that they were now too old to be able to contribute. But Clutton-Brock continued to command respect from Zimbabwe's new leaders, and he became president of the Britain&#150;Zimbabwe Society. He died on 29 January 1995 at Wynne's Parc Nursing Home, Brookhouse Road, Denbigh, of bronchopneumonia, and was survived by his wife and daughter. He was rapidly declared a Zimbabwean national hero and after cremation his ashes were taken to Harare and scattered at Heroes Acre (making him the only white man so honoured). The Zimbabwean government also honoured him by instituting the Guy Clutton-Brock scholarship, for a Zimbabwean student studying at Magdalene College, Cambridge.<br>
