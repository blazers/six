<span class="headword">Proctor,  Richard Anthony</span>  (1837&#150;1888), <span class="occ">astronomer and science writer</span>, was born on 23 March 1837 in Cheyne Row, Chelsea, London, the youngest of two sons and two daughters of William Proctor (<i>d</i>. 1850), a successful solicitor, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1857). A delicate child, Richard was educated by his mother and &#145;lived much in his father's library&#146; until his father's death when he was thirteen  (Willard, 319). Proctor spent 1855 at King's College, London, graduating in 1856 with a BA in theology. He entered St John's College, Cambridge, as a pensioner in 1856, won a scholarship in 1857, and read mathematics and theology. Shortly after his mother's death during his second year there he met Mary Mills (<i>d</i>. 1879), from near Dublin, and on 26 March 1860 they married in the parish church of St Mary Magdalene, Richmond. This was held responsible for his graduating below prediction as twenty-third wrangler that year.<br>
<br>From soon after his marriage, for some years Proctor practised Roman Catholicism, but in 1875 he publicly declared that religion was irreconcilable with scientific facts. Meanwhile he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn. However, it was the life (and death) of his eldest son that shaped Proctor's career. J. P. Nichols's <span class="italic">Architecture of the Heavens</span> and O. M. Mitchell's <span class="italic">Popular Astronomy</span> had inspired him to equip himself to teach his son mathematics and astronomy and, in 1863, distraught at his son's death, Proctor abandoned law and immersed himself in astronomy. He made his own 3.5 inch refracting telescope, and in 1865 his first article was published. At his own expense he published <span class="italic">Saturn and its System</span>, an exhaustive monograph that had taken four years' work. Although commercially unsuccessful, those publications immediately established his reputation in astronomy. Then in 1866 he lost all his savings and incurred &pound;13,000 of debt in the failure of a New Zealand bank, which left him dependent upon writing and teaching mathematics to support his family of three children. It took five years of grim struggle and entrepreneurial publishing risks to establish himself as a writer.<br>
<br>Proctor had concluded that the only way to interest the public in astronomical research was to link the latter to their curiosity regarding the broader religious and intellectual debate about the plurality of life upon other worlds. His first major success was <span class="italic">Other Worlds than Ours</span> (1870) which went to twenty-nine editions by 1909. This and subsequent works discussed the probability that the mixture of familiar and unfamiliar conditions and temperatures revealed by spectroscopic observations of planets and stars, and hence upon myriad unseen worlds, could support many forms of life. By 1875 he believed that life was much scarcer, as worlds evolved or depleted with time. Two lecture tours in America consolidated his success and influence.<br>
<br>The death of Proctor's wife in 1879 left him with six children. Returning through America from a lecture tour of Australia and New Zealand, in 1881 Proctor met and married Sallie Duffield Crawley, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thompson (1856&#150;1941), the widow of Robert J. Crawley of Missouri, and keenly interested in astronomy, who had two young daughters. They lived at Kew until 1884, but lost their two infant sons. While living in Kew, in 1881 Proctor established a scientific weekly periodical, <span class="italic">Knowledge and Illustrated Scientific News</span>.<br>
<br>A man of unbounded energy and wide interests, Proctor's gifts of vivid clarity, lecturing style, and scientific exactness in writing on many subjects gained him renown. He wrote at least 500 essays, 83 technical astronomy papers, and 57 books. His <span class="italic">Old and New Astronomy</span>, a systematic work embodying his studies over a quarter century, was completed by his friend Arthur Cowper Ranyard in 1892. Between 1870 and 1914 &#145;the impact of his publications was immense; thousands were introduced to astronomy by them&#146;  (Crowe, 548).<br>
<br>Proctor was held in high esteem by contemporaries as an original investigator. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1866, to its council in 1868, was a secretary in 1872, and was a prolific contributor to its <span class="italic">Monthly Notices</span>. Among papers on the distribution of stars and nebulae, perhaps his greatest scientific work resulted from the 400 hours copying Argelander's 324,198 stars on to an equal surface chart. By this, and well illustrated papers in <span class="italic">Monthly Notices</span>, contemporaries credited him with demolishing Sir William Herschel's theory of the stellar universe. Proctor showed that the aggregation of stars in the Milky Way was real, not merely optical. He urged others to study structure by observing small areas to fainter magnitudes, a precursor of Jacob Kapteyn's later work. In 1869 he was among the first to advocate the theory of the solar corona and inner solar envelope, although the trajectory of prominences which he explained by a resisting medium or ether is now known to be due to magnetic fields. His research deriving the rotation period of Mars within an error of 0.005 seconds was highly regarded, and is within 0.25 seconds of what later became the accepted value. Adept at charting, in 1870 he discovered the phenomenon of star drift. Proctor rightly dismissed the canals of Mars as an optical effect. Although prone to speculate, his wide knowledge and exact investigations gained him influence.<br>
<br>Contemporary obituarists barely hinted that Proctor was one of several activists seeking reform of the Royal Astronomical Society council. He could not abide dogmatists, and was &#145;determined to oppose all cliquery and jobbery&#146;  (<span class="italic">Astronomical Register</span>, 1873, 98). He made bitter enemies of Colonel Alexander Strange and J. Norman Lockyer by siding in 1872 with the astronomer royal George Airy in opposing their manoeuvres for a solar observatory at government expense. In November Lockyer resigned from council rather than sit at the same table as Proctor, who constantly attacked him in journals. Proctor had no hand in his own nomination in December 1873 for the society's gold medal, perhaps made partly to block Lockyer's third nomination. Despite his having obtained a simple majority of six to four council votes, Proctor bore Airy no animosity for vetoing him in January. In 1869 Proctor had questioned arrangements for the December 1874 transit of Venus. Lacking Airy's reply, in February 1873 Proctor used an article in the <span class="italic">Spectator</span> and a letter in <span class="italic">The Times</span> to criticize arrangements. Airy's reply to the Admiralty, printed in <span class="italic">Monthly Notices</span> (1873), conceded nothing. In the same issue Proctor's exact calculations and clear charts in <span class="italic">Monthly Notices</span> exposed errors, omissions, and neglect by Airy, the new KCB and president of the Royal Society, in planning for the transit. The Admiralty hydrographer supported Airy in <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Unfortunately Proctor responded witheringly in a supplementary <span class="italic">Monthly Notices</span>&#151;of which he was temporarily editor. Airy criticized him, and council viewed it as misuse of office. Proctor resigned his secretaryship in order to lecture in America. Through zeal and politics he had overreached himself. On his return, in May 1874, Proctor read a semi-apology to the society while Airy was in the chair. Proctor took no further active part in the society, but in 1880 did not hesitate to support the group led by William Noble in opposing Airy's nomination of William Huggins for the society medal; he ended a scathing attack in the <span class="italic">Newcastle Weekly Chronicle</span> with &#145;to do the bidding of the Astronomer Royal is not the purpose for which the Astronomical Society has been established&#146;  (<span class="italic">Newcastle Weekly Chronicle</span>, 28 Feb 1880). In 1887 Proctor predicted that the 36 inch Lick refractor was likely to prove a disappointment. Unwisely, the new director, E. S. Holden, extended his defence to a personal attack. Proctor exposed Holden's observing mistakes in Washington, with lasting damage to his reputation.<br>
<br>A family man with many friends, Proctor in 1884 moved to Orange Lake, Florida, but isolation motivated the family's return to London. While travelling from Florida to England to give a lecture tour, on 10 September 1888 Proctor booked into a New York hotel. Suddenly taken violently ill, he was diagnosed as having yellow fever, then epidemic in Florida, and for fear of contagion he was removed on a windy and wet night. Twelve hours later, on the evening of 12 September 1888, Proctor died alone and unconscious at the Willard Parker Hospital. His friends later asserted that he had received little attention and had died of malarial fever compounded by a cold. Proctor was buried in an unmarked and unkept part of the undertaker's lot in Greenwood cemetery, Brooklyn. He had been unable to leave provision for his family. In 1893 a benefactor helped the family re-inter Proctor in the same cemetery, with a memorial.<br>
<br>On hearing of her husband's death Sallie Proctor hurried to New York. She courageously fulfilled his English tour by reading his lectures to such effect that by the influence of many scientists she was awarded a civil-list pension of &pound;100. Proctor was survived by two daughters and three sons.<br>

<a name="cosubject_59855"></a><span class="headword">Mary Proctor</span>  (1862&#150;1957)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 1 April 1862 at Dublin. As a teenager she was a constant companion of her father, fascinated by the mythology of the stars; she arranged his library and proof-read for him. After his second marriage he taught her the craft of commercial writing. After her graduation from Columbia University and his death in 1888 she made a career popularizing astronomy. Mary Proctor was elected a member of the American Association of Astronomical Societies in 1898, and was a member of several American, Mexican, and British astronomical societies. She visited observatories, and was supplied with material and illustrations by leading astronomers. She attended the total solar eclipses at Bodo, Norway (1896); Virginia (1900); Burgos (1905), where she drew the corona; from an aeroplane in England (1927); in Canada (1932); and in the Mediterranean (1936). Her articles were published in <span class="italic">Science</span>, her father's magazine <span class="italic">Knowledge</span>, <span class="italic">Scientific American</span>, and after 1897 in <span class="italic">Popular Astronomy</span>. An acclaimed lecture in 1893 at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago led to popular engagements, a contract with the New York board of education, and lecture tours in the USA, Canada, England (1908&#150;9), Australia, and New Zealand; she was equally comfortable addressing children, working men's institutes, or literary and scientific societies.<br>
<br>Sometimes known as the children's astronomer, Mary Proctor did little observing, but gained lasting reputation by her books  (Creese, 238). From 1894 until about 1920 she lived in New York. Her first book, <span class="italic">Stories of Starland</span> (1898), was used as a reader in New York schools; two more books followed in 1906 and 1911. Living in London after the First World War, she lectured and published thirteen books between 1922 and 1939. From January 1916 women were eligible for election as fellows of the RAS. Proctor was elected in February and her stepmother Sallie in May 1916. Proctor was also a fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society. She died at Nazareth House, East End Road, Finchley, Middlesex, on 11 September 1957 aged ninety-six; a crater on the moon bears her name.<br>
