<span class="headword">Assheton,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1642, <em>d.</em> 1711), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was baptized on 17 July 1642 at Middleton, Lancashire, the son of William Assheton (<i>d</i>. 1659), the rector there, and his wife, Ellenor Brook. The rector's family connections lay among the puritan gentry of Lancashire: his brother Ralph and his wife's brother-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66520/', "Thomas Birch")</script> were both leading local supporters of the parliamentarian cause. He himself was, however, no more than lukewarm about the county's presbyterian settlement, dragging his feet over the appointment of elders in his parish and making no attempt to restrict access to communion to the godly. The church survey of 1650 complained that he supplied &#145;the cure at Middleton very weakly, and gives no satisfaction to the congregation, neyther expounds any chapter or psalme nor catechise the youth of the said parish&#146;. To Adam Martindale the rector was &#145;an honest humble man, considering his high birth, but accounted an exceeding mean preacher&#146;  (Shaw, 2.209&#150;10).<br>
<br>The younger William Assheton was educated at a private country school before admission to, and matriculation at, Brasenose College, Oxford, in July 1658. Although Anthony Wood claims that he had a presbyterian tutor Assheton dedicated his life to defending Anglicanism. He graduated BA in 1662, became a fellow of Brasenose in 1663, and proceeded MA in January 1665. By about 1670 he was a frequent preacher in Oxford. He proceeded BD in 1672 and the next year became first chaplain to James Butler, duke of Ormond, chancellor of the university. Soon after proceeding DD in January 1674 he became vicar of Knaresborough, Yorkshire, and a prebendary of York. But he followed Ormond to Ireland and to London, where he was appointed to the united parishes of St Antholin, Budge Row, and St John, Walbrook, in May 1674. He resigned the living in 1677 to become rector first of Fyfield, Hampshire, and then, through Ormond's influence with the St John family, of Beckenham, Kent, which living he held for the rest of his life. He was in some demand as a preacher in court and city, and several of his occasional sermons&#151;before the mayor and aldermen of London (1673), the queen (1696), the sons of the clergy (1700), and the natives of Kent (1700)&#151;have been printed. He was frequently chosen proctor for Rochester in convocation.<br>
<br>Assheton's fame rests on a myriad of original writings and collections of the work of others, many of which he had published in cheap editions for charitable or evangelical distribution. Just how many he wrote is difficult to gauge because of his habit of changing works slightly and retitling them for new editions. His first works, from the 1660s through the early 1680s, were works of controversy attacking nonconformists for threatening state and church government. <span class="italic">Evangelium armatum</span> (1663, new edition with revised title 1682) collected selections from Richard Baxter, Edmund Calamy, and others in order to prove that their pretended purity of religion led to the cutting of throats. In the 1670s <span class="italic">Toleration Disapprov'd and Condemn'd by the Authority</span> (1670), <span class="italic">The Danger of Hypocrisie</span> (1673), and <span class="italic">The Cases of Scandal and Persecution</span> (1674) condemned any relaxation of penal laws for dissenters, and he expanded the first in 1705 to condemn occasional conformity. <span class="italic">A Seasonable Apology for the Honours and Revenues of the Clergy</span> (1676) quotes <span class="italic">Eikon basilike</span> approvingly for condemning &#145;the abasing of Episcopacy into Presbytery and the robbing of the Church of its Lands and Revenues&#146;  (Assheton, <span class="italic">Seasonable</span>, sig. A6<i>v</i>). After the exposure of the Rye House plot he lambasted &#145;the Brethren of the Association&#146;  (Assheton, <span class="italic">Royal Apology</span>, sig. A3) by publishing <span class="italic">The Cry of Royal Innocent Blood, Heard and Answered</span> (1683), <span class="italic">The Parallel: Doleman / Bradshaw / Sidney</span> (1684), and <span class="italic">The Royal Apology, or, An Answer to the Rebels Plea</span> (1684) in quick succession. Under James II he turned his attention to the Catholic threat in <span class="italic">The Plain-Mans Reply to the Catholick Missionaries</span> (1686), followed by <span class="italic">A defence of &#145;The Plain-Man's Reply&#146;</span> (1688), and <span class="italic">The Country Parsons Admonition to his Parishioners. Perswading them to continue in the protestant religion</span> (1687), followed by <span class="italic">A Defence of the Country Parson's Admonition</span> in the same year.<br>
<br>Assheton increasingly devoted his energies to producing short pamphlets of practical divinity for the common lay person, including: a dialogue on atheism (1690, revised 1694), four discourses against blasphemy, drunkenness, swearing, and debauchery (1691&#150;3), a defence of infant baptism (1694, revised as <span class="italic">A Conference with an Anabaptist</span>, 1695), <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning a Death-Bed Repentance</span> (1696), <span class="italic">A Method of Daily Devotion. Fitted to the Meanest Capacities</span> (1697), <span class="italic">The Plain Man's Devotion</span> (1698), methods of devotion for sick and dying persons (1698? and 1706), <span class="italic">Directions for Prayer</span> (1702), <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Immortality of the Soul</span> (1703), and <span class="italic">A Brief Exhortation of the Holy Communion</span> (1705). Several of these he dedicated to his Beckenham parishioners, a couple were translated into Welsh, and many were reprinted throughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. He often appended a price list of &#145;these little Two-penny Books&#146;  (Watts, 60) to his works, adding that they were &#145;cheaper to those who are so Charitable to give away Numbers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Account</span>). Assheton's biographer Thomas Watts suggests that he had printed thousands of his tracts just before the king's proclamation for the reformation of manners, and Queen Mary had his tracts distributed to soldiers and seamen. Likewise he contributed a number of his tracts to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.<br>
<br>Assheton also published collected writings of Edward Stillingfleet (1710), and of John Tillotson and Stillingfleet (1697), and Isaac Barrow against Socinians (1698), as well as a collection, <span class="italic">Occasional Prayers</span>, from bishops Jeremy Taylor, John Cosin, and Thomas Kenn (1708). Finally Assheton contributed to the origins of life insurance with his <span class="italic">An account of Dr Assheton's proposal &hellip; for the benefit of widows of clergymen and others; by settling joyntures and annuities at the rate of thirty per cent</span> (1699). He first proposed this scheme for providing maintenance for clergymen's widows and others to the corporation of the clergy and then to the Bank of England, both of whom declined, before finding acceptance from the Mercers' Company. Rich dissenters, including his friend Mr Papillon, contributed to this scheme. And, although the scheme almost immediately foundered because of faulty computations, it was revised and continued until the company petitioned parliament for assistance in 1747.<br>
<br>Beckenham, according to Assheton, was beset by Unitarians (&#145;[t]hey have been scattering their pamphlets &hellip; in my parish&#146;; DWL, 201.38, fol. 13) and Baptists (&#145;[t]here being several Antipaedobaptists &hellip; in this Parish&#146;; Assheton, <span class="italic">Exposition</span>, sig. A3). But even the latter he viewed as &#145;very kind and loving Parishioners&#146;  (Assheton, <span class="italic">Conference</span>, vi&#150;vii). And his tracts stirred controversy more than his ministry. A Baptist preacher published <span class="italic">Jerub-Baal. Being, a Three-Penny Answer to a Twelve-Penny Book. Written by William Assheton</span> (1697) and Baxter refuted the arguments of Assheton and others in <span class="italic">The Nonconformists Plea for Peace</span> (1679). Baxter later noted Assheton's attack on nonconformists' motives as &#145;words, so false and impudent, beseeming the Devil himself were the speaker&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, 2.206). Assheton continued single for many years and his household was managed by his sister. He built a large personal library of divinity and shipped duplicates to Wales and the Scottish highlands. On 16 May 1689 he took out a licence to marry Anne Peache, a widow of Rotherhithe, although there seems to have been no issue from the union and Assheton buried her at Rotherhithe among her family. A few years before his death he was offered the headship of Brasenose, but he declined because of age. In September 1711 he developed a fever for about ten days and died at Beckenham. He was buried on 17 September in the chancel of his church there.<br>
