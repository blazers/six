<span class="headword">Voerst,  Robert  van</span>  (1597&#150;1636), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born in Deventer, Holland, on 8 September 1597. He was taught engraving by Crispijn de Passe the elder in Utrecht, and was a fellow pupil with Joachim von Sandrart in the Utrecht Academy in 1625&#150;6. He had arrived in London by 1627, when he engraved a portrait of the earl of Lindsey, after a painting by Georg Geldorp. Since all his early English prints are after Geldorp, it is reasonable to conclude that it was Geldorp, whose father had been a close associate of de Passe in Cologne, who brought him to London.<br>
<br>By 1630 Voerst had begun to work for the London publisher William Webb, for whom he made a series of at least five plates, including one of Philip Herbert, the future fourth earl of Pembroke. His breakthrough came the following year, when Charles I commissioned him to engrave Gerrit van Honthorst's portrait of his sister Elizabeth of Bohemia; the link was probably through Pembroke. The success of this led to a sequence of important commissions. For Pembroke he engraved a large plate of the third earl, his recently deceased brother, while for Charles he engraved the emperor Otho, one of the set of the twelve Caesars by Titian that had been purchased from Mantua in 1628. The plates of this and of Elizabeth are both recorded in van der Doort's inventory of Charles's collection.<br>
<br>Voerst's greatest work followed in 1634, when he engraved on a large scale the double portrait of Charles and Henrietta Maria painted two years earlier, shortly after Van Dyck's arrival in London. This is a masterpiece, and explains why Voerst was the only engraver working in London with whom Van Dyck was willing to collaborate; none of the numerous other painted portraits of English sitters was engraved in London during Van Dyck's lifetime. The plate was published by Voerst himself with a royal privilege, and must be linked with his appointment as engraver to the king, a position that was newly created for him, probably in 1635. Voerst was working on another large plate after a marble bust of Charles when he died, a victim of the plague of 1636.<br>
<br>About thirty plates by Voerst are known, all made in London and all portraits, as well as a set of twenty-one animal pattern sheets that was posthumously reissued by Crispijn de Passe. At least seven plates were made for Van Dyck, and were intended to form part of the series of portraits now known as the <span class="italic">Iconography</span> (<i>c</i>.1632&#150;1644), although only four were in fact included in the first edition. Among them was Voerst's own portrait, showing him holding a rolled-up sheet of paper, engraved after a drawing by Van Dyck that is now in the Louvre. In 1635 the eighteen-year-old Gerard ter Borch, his sister's stepson, came to work in Voerst's studio in London, and made a portrait drawing of the engraver that is now in the Rijksmuseum.<br>
