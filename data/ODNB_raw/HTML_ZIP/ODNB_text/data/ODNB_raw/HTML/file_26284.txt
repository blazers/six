<span class="headword">Stanley,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1647, <em>d.</em> 1731), <span class="occ">dean of St Asaph</span>, was baptized on 22 August 1647 at Hinckley, Leicestershire, the son of William Stanley (<i>bap</i>. 1618, <i>d</i>. 1648) and his wife, Lucy (<i>bap</i>. 1629), daughter of William Beveridge DD, vicar of Barrow upon Soar, Leicestershire, and hence the sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2321/', "Bishop William Beveridge")</script>. Stanley was educated at Ashley, Lancashire, at a school kept by Jeremy Crompton. He was admitted on 4 July 1663 to St John's College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1667, and following his election as a fellow of Corpus Christi College in 1669 he proceeded MA in 1670. He was ordained a priest by Henry Compton, bishop of London, on 22 September 1672, and became a university preacher in 1676. He proceeded BD in 1678 and, following an appointment as curate of Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, he became chaplain to the earl of Essex, who presented him on 20 October 1681 to the rectory of Rayne, Essex. He then moved to St Mary Magdalen, Old Fish Street, London, on 30 October 1682. On 18 September 1684 he became prebendary of Codington Major in St Paul's Cathedral.<br>
<br>Stanley was created DD by Archbishop Sancroft on 12 November 1685 preparatory to his journey into the Netherlands as chaplain of Princess Mary (later Mary II). One of the works he took with him was <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning the Devotions of the Church of Rome</span> (1685), of which he was reputed to be the author. It may well have come in useful as much of Stanley's time at The Hague was spent supporting the princess against the efforts of her father, James II, to convert her to Catholicism by sending her religious works, and reporting on this and the activities of the exiled Gilbert Burnet at the Orange court to Bishop Compton. Another work, <span class="italic">The Faith and Practice of a Church of England-Man</span> (1688), may also have been inspired by his chaplaincy duties. He remained with the princess, with one trip to England, until she returned after the revolution. Thereafter Stanley was named the new queen's clerk of the closet. He became a canon residentiary at St Paul's, and on 30 November 1689 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, serving on the council for several years in the 1690s. Bishop Compton collated him to the rectory of Much Hadham on 13 August 1690, and Stanley retained the benefice until he handed over to his son in 1723. He preached the sermon on 19 January 1692 at the consecration of Tenison as bishop of Lincoln, and duly succeeded Tenison as archdeacon of London on 5 March 1692. He was chosen master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, on 13 July 1693, remaining so until 1698, and serving as vice-chancellor in 1693&#150;4. On 9 November 1693 he married Mary (1672/3&#150;1758), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21821/', "Sir Francis Pemberton")</script>, lord chief justice. They had three sons. In 1695 he was living in the parish of St Martin Ludgate.<br>
<br>Stanley was collated dean of St Asaph on 7 December 1706, and installed on 1 March 1707. He preached a sermon on 20 February 1708 before the Society for Propagating the Gospel in Foreign Parts, which he described in his will as &#145;that truly religious society &hellip; I had the happiness to be the beginner&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/648, fol. 56<i>v</i>). His loud voice attracted the criticism of <span class="italic">The Tatler</span> in 1709 which complained that &#145;Stentor&#146; was &#145;accustomed to roar and bellow so terribly loud in the responses&#146;, and that he &#145;drowns the harmony of every hymn and anthem&#146;  (Bond, 1.381&#150;2). In the 1714 parliamentary session he provided the financial backing for the act abolishing mortuaries in Welsh dioceses (13 Anne c. 6), which was extended from St Asaph to cover the other Welsh dioceses. Stanley was active in the commission for building fifty new churches in London, attending over sixty meetings between 1711 and 1727. In 1722 he published a catalogue of the manuscripts in Corpus Christi College, which Thomas Hearne described as a &#145;useful thing&#146;, although he thought the author &#145;very poor&#146;. He continued &#145;Doctor Stanley hath a great income, and is a very rich man, but has no very great character&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 342&#150;3). Stanley died at Much Hadham on 9 October 1731, and was buried in St Paul's on 15 October. His will referred to landed property in Hertfordshire and Lincolnshire and to his house at Much Hadham &#145;which I lately rebuilt&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/648, fol. 55<i>v</i>), as well as to his many books there and at Amen Corner in Berkshire.<br>
