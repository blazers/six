<span class="headword">Macclesfield <span class="st"> [Maxfield]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (1585&#150;1616), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and martyr</span>, was probably born at Chesterton Hall in Staffordshire, the seventh of the eleven children of William Macclesfield (<i>c</i>.1553&#150;1610), gentleman, of Chesterton and Maer, Staffordshire, and his wife, Ursula (<i>c</i>.1557&#150;<i>c</i>.1607), daughter of Francis Roos of Laxton, Nottinghamshire, and Chapel Chorlton parish, Swineshead, Staffordshire. An elder son, Simon, also became a priest. The family's two main residences were Chesterton Hall, Chesterton, in the parish of Wolstanton, and Maer Hall, Maer, the family seat. The estate at Maer Hall consisted of land comprising some 3000 acres. Thomas Macclesfield's father, William, &#145;was Catholike, a man of worthy pietie &hellip; and who under the reign of two princes was much renowned for his patient sufferance of a long imprisonment, confiscation of all his goods&#146;  (<span class="italic">Miscellanea</span>, 33). In July 1587 he was condemned to death with Erasmus Wolseley of Wolseley Hall and other gentlemen at Stafford assizes for aiding a recusant priest, Robert Sutton. They were also caught attending mass in gaol. The judge reprieved them. William Macclesfield was convicted at least nine times for recusancy, and is said to have spent nineteen years in prison in total.<br>
<br>Thomas Macclesfield &#145;was nurst and brought into the world, both parents being in prison&#146;  (<span class="italic">Miscellanea</span>, 33). He attended a Staffordshire grammar school. On 16 March 1603 he entered the English College, Douai, with his elder brother Simon. They adopted the alias Field. Thomas also used the alias John Cleaton, probably emanating from the Clayton family of Maer. However, he was sent home for health reasons in 1610. In 1612 he was readmitted to the English College, Douai, and ordained at Arras on 29 March 1614. He was sent to England on 17 July 1615. On arrival he took lodgings in the Strand and went to visit Father Harries, a friend, at the Gatehouse prison in Westminster where he celebrated his first mass in England. He carried out missionary work for three months and was then arrested. He confessed to being a priest and was put in the Gatehouse prison. On 14 June 1616 &#145;a barr of the windowe being broken, he attempted to escape, but alas, whilst he was descending &hellip; by a rope &hellip; a fellow caught him&#146;  (ibid., 33). On recapture he was put in a tiny cell in such a position that he could not stand upright, lie down, or turn over. On 17 June he was moved to Newgate prison. As a result of converting two of his fellow prisoners to his religion, he was put with other recusants.<br>
<br>At the Old Bailey, Macclesfield was indicted under the statute of 27 Elizabeth for having been ordained overseas and acting as a priest in England. At the trial he was convicted of high treason and condemned to death, &#145;yet had his pardon offer'd, if he would submit to the oath of allegiance, which he &hellip; refused&#146;  (Dodd, 2.378). In prison he was visited by many persons of distinction and by his mother, his brother Peter, and his sisters. His letters to some of them and to Matthew Kellison were preserved and later given to St Edmund's College, Ware. Despite the intercession of the Spanish ambassador, the count of Gondomar, with James I, he was executed at Tyburn on 1 July 1616. On the night before his execution people decorated the gallows with flowers. When, at his execution, he tried to explain that seminary priests were not traitors, he was silenced and the cart was drawn from under him. He was then hanged, drawn, and quartered. After his death his bones were taken to Spain, where they were venerated as those of a martyr in the family chapel of the count of Gondomar in Galicia. The relics are currently at Downside Abbey, Somerset. An engraving dated 1621, with a Spanish inscription, shows him with the attributes of martyrdom. Thomas Macclesfield was one of the 136 martyrs beatified by the pope in 1929. He was beatified as Thomas Maxfield.<br>
