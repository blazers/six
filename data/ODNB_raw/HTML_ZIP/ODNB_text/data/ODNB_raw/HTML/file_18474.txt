<span class="headword">Meadows,  Alfred</span>  (1833&#150;1887), <span class="occ">obstetric physician</span>, was born at Ipswich on 2 June 1833, the fourth child of Charles Meadows. After attending Ipswich grammar school Meadows began his medical career as an apprentice to Mr William Elliston, of Ipswich. In 1853 he matriculated at the University of London and entered King's College medical school, where he was first associate, and then fellow. In 1856 he became MRCS and LRCP; he also obtained the midwifery licence of the Royal College of Surgeons. In 1857 he graduated MB of the University of London; he became MD in 1858, MRCP in 1862 and FRCP in 1873. On 29 April 1858 he married Sara Stirling Davidson (<i>b</i>. 1832/3), daughter of Major James Davidson; they had one daughter.<br>
<br>On qualifying Meadows was appointed to the posts of house physician and resident midwifery assistant at King's College Hospital, and he spent the winter of 1857 in Paris. He subsequently held a large number of appointments, achieving a degree of celebrity which earned for him a long list of honorary memberships of foreign societies. The more important appointments were at King's College Hospital, where he was elected assistant physician for diseases of women and children in 1860, and at the Hospital for Women, Soho Square, to which he was physician from 1865 until his resignations in 1874; he was also physician accoucheur to the General Lying-in Hospital. His career reached its zenith in 1871, when he was elected physician accoucheur and lecturer on the diseases of women and children at St Mary's Hospital; he held this post until his death.<br>
<br>Meadows was an active fellow of the Obstetrical Society of London: he held several of the various appointments on council and won general praise for his work as secretary. However, he left the society after failing to be elected president in 1884 as a result of his belief that ovariotomies ought to be performed by obstetricians rather than left to general surgeons. Meadows considered that the removal of healthy ovaries was a useful sterilization procedure in cases where childbirth would endanger a woman's life. He also thought it preferable to mechanical methods of contraception. The dispute over ovariotomy led to the establishment of the British Gynaecological Society in December 1884, and Meadows was elected its first president. He was also corresponding member of the German, Swedish, and Boston gynaecological societies. In 1878 he attended the crown prince of Sweden while he visited England: in recognition of his services, the king of Sweden in 1881 made him a commander of the second class of the order of Vasa.<br>
<br>Meadows was the author of the <span class="italic">Prescriber's Companion</span> (1864), a work that went through many editions, and of a <span class="italic">Manual of Midwifery</span> (1870), well known to a generation of students and teachers; the second edition of this text was translated in 1875 into Japanese. He revised and enlarged Thomas Hawkes Tanner's <span class="italic">Practical Treatise on the Diseases of Infancy and Childhood</span> (1870) and published <span class="italic">Clinical Memoirs on the Diseases of Women</span> (2 vols., 1866&#150;7), translated for the New Sydenham Society from the work by Gustave Bernutz and Ernest Goupil, thus making accessible to the British profession one of the most important contemporary works on inflammatory and other diseases of the pelvic peritoneum in women. He also founded and edited the short-lived <span class="italic">London Medical Review</span> in 1860.<br>
<br>Meadows was a skilful practitioner and had a kindly nature, and was much respected by patients and colleagues alike. His personal and professional qualities ensured his professional success, and he built up a lucrative private practice. A Conservative in politics, he held his religious beliefs with conviction and actively promoted the Guild of St Luke, of which he was provost. He was JP for Buckinghamshire, where he owned a house, Poyle Manor, near Colnbrook. A well-known and energetic freemason, Meadows took a leading part in founding the University of London lodge and was an officer of the grand lodge of England, of which he became master.<br>
<br>Meadows died suddenly on 19 April 1887, of enteritis, at his home, 27 George Street, Hanover Square, London, and was buried at Colnbrook on 23 April. He was survived by his wife.<br>
