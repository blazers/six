<span class="headword">Eadgyth</span>  (<em>c.</em>911&#150;946), <span class="occ">queen of the East Franks, consort of Otto I</span>, was born in Wessex, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8514/', "Edward the Elder (870s?&#150;924)")</script>, king of the Anglo-Saxons, and his second wife, &AElig;lffl&aelig;d. She was thus half-sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/833/', "&#198;thelstan, king of England (893/4&#150;939)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8501/', "Edmund, king of England (920/21&#150;946)")</script>, and full sister of Eadgifu (I) (<i>d</i>. in or after 951), who became queen of the West Franks. By 919 &AElig;lffl&aelig;d was either dead, divorced, or repudiated, and Edward had been married a third time, to Eadgifu (<i>d</i>. in or after 966).<br>
<br>Archaeology has recently confirmed the identification of Eadgyth's remains, excavated in Magdeburg Cathedral in 2008, and provided details of her early life. It reveals a woman who was aged between thirty and forty at her death, and thus born between about 906 and 916. She had been raised in southern England and enjoyed a high-status lifestyle, including a diet rich in protein, especially fish: this may indicate a period spent in a nunnery with her mother at the end of the latter's life, and Eadgyth's diet seems to have changed when she was about nine years old. Stress-markers in her bones are less likely to indicate malnutrition than to have resulted from infectious illness at some stage between the ages of ten and fourteen.<br>
<br>In late 929 or early 930 Eadgyth married Otto (912&#150;973), later known as the Great, the eldest son of Henry I (<i>d</i>. 936) of the Saxon Liudolfing family, who had become king of the East Franks in 919. After Henry sent an embassy to England, Eadgyth and her younger sister, another Eadgifu (II), were dispatched to the continent in the company of Bishop Cenwald of Worcester in the autumn of 929. The marriage has been seen both as part of &AElig;thelstan's ambitious foreign policy and as Henry's quest for legitimation through an ethnically Saxon bride from an old-established dynasty who would set his son apart from his noble rivals. But an understanding of its significance has been obscured by the fact that almost all comment on the marriage, as on Eadgyth herself, post-dates her death, her husband Otto's second marriage to Adelaide, daughter of Rudolf II of Burgundy, and the coronation of Otto as emperor in 962.<br>
<br>Seen in the context of the politics of late Carolingian Europe, what matters is that Eadgyth was the third of Edward's daughters and &AElig;thelstan's half-sisters to marry a continental European ruler: Eadgifu (I) had married Charles III; Eadhild, Hugh the Great, duke of Francia. The aims and knowledge of Eadgifu (II) were arguably as important as those of &AElig;thelstan or Henry in the making of this match. Hrotsvitha of Gandersheim, and later &AElig;thelweard, speak of a choice given to Otto, the sending of two princesses in a sort of bride-show. Otto chose Eadgyth, and her sister married a brother of Rudolf II of Burgundy. A double marriage may have been envisaged from the outset. Burgundy mattered more in tenth-century politics than modern French and German nationalist historiographies might suggest. &AElig;thelstan had his own motives, which probably included the safe parking of West Saxon royal blood outside England, as well as kinship obligations to Eadgifu (I) and her son. Any dynastic prestige in 929 was likely to accrue to Henry, though legitimation may not have been the prime motivation of a king with two earlier Carolingian marriages in the family. Otto's accession in 936 was soon followed by the death of Rudolf II, who left an infant heir, and a grown brother, married to Eadgyth's sister. The child was brought to Otto's and Eadgyth's court. The network of English royal sisters was a factor in mid-tenth-century European politics.<br>
<br>Eadgyth arrived with unspecified treasures, gifts, and followers. Little is known of her activities from 929 to 936, though she secured her future with the birth of a son, Liudolf (930&#150;957), and a daughter, Liudgard (931&#150;953). The marriage looked outwards and west; the young couple's initial perambulation was through the Rhineland. But internally it was the culmination of Henry's protracted &#145;house ordering&#146; of 927&#150;9, which included the designation of Otto as his sole heir. Eadgyth thus arrived at a turning point in Liudolfing family politics, made fraught by the apparent failure of her husband's designation to secure wider noble support. It is noteworthy that she and Otto disappear from the surviving sources until Henry's death in 936, and that her relations with her mother-in-law, Mathilda, were strained thereafter. If Eadgyth was consecrated queen in 936, the unconsecrated Mathilda may have resented it. But the tension probably originated in Mathilda's unhappiness with the implications of 927&#150;9 for her younger son, Henry. The pattern of Eadgyth's interventions in charters often shadows Mathilda's own networks: rivalry, proffered friendship, or some more complex assertion of power and patronage could all explain this. Mathilda disappeared into retirement soon after 936. Although Eadgyth played a role in the reconciliation of her husband to his mother, perhaps in 941, Mathilda did not reappear at court until a few days after Eadgyth's death.<br>
<br>Eadgyth was an outsider queen, a difficult position: when Otto later designated their son, Liudolf, he chose a bride for him within East Francia. Nevertheless Eadgyth's role as mother of an heir was central. Her charter interventions were early and few, but often made with her son, and it was later claimed that the loss of his mother was a political blow to Liudolf. There is no evidence that his grandmother supported him, and he was increasingly both cause of and participant in the internal tensions and rebellions that rent the family in the 930s and 940s. It was probably at that time that Eadgyth's public persona was developed. The fullest account of her is that of the Gandersheim nun, Hrotsvitha, written in the mid-960s. It represents Eadgyth's mother as an &#145;illustrious sharer in royal power&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gesta Ottonis</span>, l. 80), superior to the mother of her half-brother, &AElig;thelstan. Although this was clearly elaborated in East Francia, it is in fact consistent with later English stories of &AElig;thelstan's birth. Hrotsvitha is also the sole source for Eadgyth's alleged saintly ancestry, linked to St Oswald of Northumbria. She connects this to the choice of Eadgyth as Otto's bride, but Oswald's cult only became strong after 929, at places that included Essen, where Eadgyth's granddaughter became abbess. Such claims could have been intended to counter the Saxon identity increasingly stressed for Mathilda.<br>
<br>Eadgyth was actively involved in propagating the notion that the Liudolfings had enjoyed a new dynastic beginning in 936. Her possession of Magdeburg as her dower gave her a footing in East Frankish politics, and she and Otto developed it as a mausoleum and new centre of family memory. Some of the relics of St Maurice, with which it was endowed, may have been among the treasures that Eadgyth brought in 929, while relics of St Innocentius were promised to her and Otto by Rudolf II and later claimed by them from him. Meanwhile her links with England and her English half-brothers remained important, though details are scarce. The Ottonian court played a role in English ecclesiastical politics, and a second English marriage after Eadgyth's death may have been mooted. But her brother Edmund's death later in 946 was a turning point. Tenth-century politics continued to provide a central role for women, but the lateral bonds of the Anglo-Saxon sororal network had largely played out.<br>
<br>Eadgyth died on 26 January 946. Otto buried her at Magdeburg Cathedral, which he designated for his own burial. Her memory remained strong in the 960s, especially in the great Saxon nunneries of Quedlinburg and Gandersheim. In the shifting context of Liudolfing family politics Liudolf, and Eadgyth as his mother, remained important figures. Her memory was strong in England too. Her granddaughter Mathilda, abbess of Essen, was in touch with Ealdorman &AElig;thelweard in the 980s or 990s. By then Eadgyth represented imperial connections, which impressed &AElig;thelweard and continued to be remembered in England into the twelfth century. In his writings &AElig;thelweard stressed the common ancestry of English and German Saxons, but tenth-century Ottonian sources did not do so. Eadgyth's son, Liudolf, died before his father. Her name disappeared from the family name stock, and although her great-grandson became emperor as Conrad II (<i>r</i>. 1024&#150;39), his descent from Eadgyth was never emphasized. She was remembered at Magdeburg, however, with some significant ritual commemoration and the development of a popular cult.<br>
