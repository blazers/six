</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Robertson, Sir  Dennis Holme</span>  (1890&#150;1963), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born on 23 May 1890 at Lowestoft, Suffolk, the youngest of six children (he had three brothers and two sisters) of James Robertson (1836&#150;1903), classical scholar, schoolmaster, and clergyman, and his wife, Constance Elizabeth Wilson (1857&#150;1935). He was of mixed Scottish and English (Liverpool) ancestry.<br>
<br>Robertson was born at a time of sudden decline in the family's fortunes. His father had been compelled to resign as master of Haileybury College, following a lawsuit brought by the parents of a boy who had been expelled for stealing, and the family were waiting anxiously for a suitable living to be found. Thus Robertson grew up the son of a poor country parson, at Whittlesford near Cambridge. The experience left him with an abiding fear of poverty, together with a reputation for economy in his scale of hospitality. Robertson was educated at home until aged twelve but then won a scholarship to Eton College. Here he flourished, winning many prizes, including the Newcastle prize for classics, as well as writing verse, editing the <span class="italic">Eton College Chronicle</span>, and rising to become the captain of the school.<br>
<br>In 1908 Robertson won a major scholarship in classics to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he pursued a dazzlingly successful undergraduate career. He was placed in the first division of the first class in part one of the classical tripos in 1910 and then read for part two of the economics tripos, in which he achieved another first in 1912. Along the way he was awarded both the Porson and the Craven (university) scholarships, the latter during his <i>annus mirabilis</i> in 1911, in which he also won the chancellor's medal for English verse for the third time and was president of the union society, the Liberal club, and the amateur dramatic club. He was an accomplished actor and retained a lifelong interest in the amateur stage. Research at Cambridge on the causes of the trade cycle followed. This brought him the Cobden prize in 1913 and a fellowship of Trinity College the following year. His dissertation was published as <span class="italic">A Study of Industrial Fluctuation</span> (1915), a classic text that laid the foundations for all his subsequent work in the field.<br>
<br>Robertson had trained with the university cavalry squadron and though opposed to the war he joined up immediately in August 1914. He served as a transport officer with the territorials in Egypt and Palestine and in the occupation of Constantinople. For his gallantry in maintaining vital supplies to the front line in the first battle of Gaza in 1917 he was awarded the military cross.<br>
<br>Robertson returned to Cambridge in 1919 and apart from five years (1939&#150;44) at London University and in the Treasury, spent his professional life there. He was a fellow of Trinity College from 1914 to 1938 and from 1944 to 1963, and successively university lecturer (1924), Girdlers' lecturer (1928), and reader in economics (1930); in 1944 he succeeded A. C. Pigou as professor of political economy, and held the chair until his retirement in 1957. In 1926&#150;7 he obtained leave of absence to undertake an eight-month tour of Asia and the Far East, travelling out via Russia and the Trans-Siberian Railway and returning by way of India and Egypt. He was elected to the exclusive Cambridge Apostles in 1926. During the 1920s he was among the admirers of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71832/', "George &#145;Dadie&#146; Rylands (1902&#150;1999)")</script>, with whom he had a protracted intimate relationship: he never married.<br>
<br>Robertson rapidly established an international reputation as an economist. He published prolifically and was always in demand as a lecturer and book reviewer. He took part in the Clapham (British Association) inquiry into the gold standard (1921), gave evidence to the Macmillan committee on finance and industry (1930), and carried out, with A. L. Bowley, a survey on behalf of the Indian government of the provision of statistical and other economic data in India (1933&#150;4). In 1935 he was a member of a sub-committee, on the trend of unemployment, of the committee on economic information (a standing committee of the Economic Advisory Council) and served on the committee itself between 1936 and 1939. Also in 1939 he was a member of the Treasury (Phillips) committee on the control of savings and investment. It was a measure of his reputation that between 1936 and 1938 he was adviser to the financial section of the League of Nations, especially with regard to Jan Tinbergen's econometric testing of Gottfried Haberler's trade-cycle hypotheses.<br>
<br>Robertson made contributions in several areas of economics but chiefly to the study of the relationship between money, the trade cycle, and economic growth. In the <span class="italic">Study of Industrial Fluctuation</span>, he used historical evidence to argue that economic cycles had real (that is, related to investment and saving) as opposed to monetary or psychological causes and that some degree of fluctuation was a necessary part of the growth process. It was a thesis that challenged orthodox thinking in Britain and established Robertson as a possible precursor of real business cycle theory.<br>
<br>Money was woven into the theoretical scheme in 1926 after Robertson had worked out the economic implications of fractional reserve banking in his Cambridge handbook <span class="italic">Money</span> (1922). In <span class="italic">Banking Policy and the Price Level</span> (1926), the most innovative of his works, he developed a theory of forced or involuntary saving which anticipated the work of the Austrian school in the following decade. By this process banks were given the power to regulate investment and saving&#151;and hence cycles and economic growth&#151;through manipulation of money and the price level. The book was also remarkable for its extensive use of neologism, amounting almost to a private language, which greatly reduced its appeal.<br>
<br>From this basic position Robertson never departed, though he did, in the 1930s, spell out a dynamic, period-analysis of saving, based on the concept of the Robertsonian &#145;day&#146;, and re-cast his theory in Wicksellian, interest-rate, terms following initiatives by J. M. Keynes and F. A. Hayek.<br>
<br>Robertson was known as a literary economist. Much of his writing is witty, elegant, and charming and he peppered his books and essays with literary allusions and quotations, especially from Lewis Carroll's &#145;Alice&#146; books, which became a characteristic feature. It was an approach partly dictated by his lack of facility in mathematics and his aversion to statistical modelling of economic phenomena but also because he found economics aesthetically arid. It won him many faithful admirers but repelled many others and in some quarters led to his capacities being underestimated.<br>
<br>For much of the 1920s Robertson worked in close collaboration with J. M. Keynes, fellow of King's College, Cambridge (he had been Keynes's pupil as an undergraduate and his postgraduate supervisee), and it was Robertson who was in some ways the more innovative in striking out on new lines of development. But with his deeply conservative temperament, Robertson sought always to build on established and, in particular, Marshallian, foundations. When Keynes, less inhibited, began to question old certainties in the 1930s, Robertson could not follow. The erstwhile collaborator became a formidable and increasingly embittered critic of Keynes's new economics. Their differences centred ultimately on the nature of saving and, therefore, the relationship between investment, saving, money, and the rate of interest, with the Robertson and Keynes positions represented by the loanable funds and liquidity preference theories respectively.<br>
<br>In January 1939 Robertson took up the Sir Ernest Cassel chair (of money and banking) at the London School of Economics, where he could work among like-minded colleagues. Within a year, however, Britain was at war and from the end of August 1939 Robertson was seconded to the Treasury as economic adviser to Sir Frederick Phillips, initially helping to manage the balance of payments. He was employed, first in London and then in Washington, on tasks&#151;principally arithmetical computations&#151;which some believed were below his capacities. During his period in Washington, however, he was involved in work relating to the Anglo-American monetary discussions, and Keynes was persuaded to include him in the British delegation to the Bretton Woods conference of 1944. Robertson proved himself an invaluable lieutenant and earned Keynes's highest praise. A reconciliation then seemed possible but an unfortunate misunderstanding during the negotiations in June and July 1944 led to a rebuff that scarred Robertson for the remainder of his life. Their breach set the tone for the next two decades as Robertson took up the chair at Cambridge. Though Keynes was soon dead, his influence lived on and continued to shadow Robertson's declining years.<br>
<br>During his tenure of the Cambridge chair, Robertson's writing lacked the originality of the earlier years but he continued to produce volumes of highly polished essays on current topics and, all too often, exposures of Keynesian &#145;error&#146;. The definitive Robertson position is to be found in his <span class="italic">Lectures on Economic Principles</span> (1957&#150;9), published after he retired.<br>
<br>Robertson served on the royal commission on equal pay (1944&#150;6) and together with Sir Harold Howitt was a member of the Council on Prices, Productivity and Incomes chaired by Lord Cohen (dubbed The Three Wise Men, 1957&#150;8). Robertson's ideas influenced the deflationary policy pursued by Peter Thorneycroft during the latter's brief period as chancellor of the exchequer (1957&#150;8). He was also called upon to give evidence to expert inquiries, including the committee on the rating of site values (1948) and the Canadian royal commission on banking and finance (1962).<br>
<br>Robertson received ample public recognition of his achievements: fellow of the British Academy (1932), CMG (1944), fellow of Eton College (1948&#150;57), president of the Royal Economic Society (1948&#150;50), knighthood (1953). Honorary degrees were conferred by universities at home (London, Manchester, Durham, and Sheffield) and abroad (Harvard, Columbia, Amsterdam, and Louvain).<br>
<br>Robertson exercised his right to delay retirement until the age of sixty-seven and continued working almost to the end. He became ill shortly after returning from Canada in 1962 and entered the Evelyn Nursing Home, Cambridge, where he died on 21 April 1963. The funeral was at the Cambridge crematorium on 24 April.<br>
