<span class="headword">Langley,  Francis</span>  (1548&#150;1602), <span class="occ">businessman and moneylender</span>, was born near Althorpe, Lincolnshire, one of the seven children of Thomas Langley, a tenant farmer, and his wife, Agnes. Orphaned at the age of eight, Francis and his younger brother Thomas were brought up by their uncle John Langley, a prosperous London goldsmith who later became prime warden of his company, sheriff, alderman, and lord mayor (1576&#150;7). A country youth suddenly in a prosperous household in a new urban environment, Francis soon developed a taste for the perquisites of power and affluence. Having been apprenticed to a draper, he was before long censured for taking inappropriate liberties and was finally turned out by his master. By unknown means Langley did secure his freedom in the Company of Drapers many years later, along with a reversion to the office of alnager, or searcher and sealer of woollen cloths, for the City. He took up this office in 1585 and was promptly embroiled in lawsuits charging him with extortion and fraud.<br>
<br>During these same years Langley also learned how the City money market worked and began a long career as a moneylender. He soon became quite adept at using loans to ensnare gullible borrowers, to their loss and his gain. When Thomas Cure defaulted on one such series of loans in the late 1580s, Langley acquired from him the lordship and manor of Paris Garden, a 100 acre tract on the south side of the Thames across from London. Langley built rental tenements on the western edge of this property, and in 1594&#150;5 erected the Swan playhouse on its eastern edge, near the manorial millpond and the Falcon landing stairs on the riverside.<br>
<br>The Swan was the fifth playhouse in the environs of London and the second on the Bankside; it joined its neighbour the Rose, built almost a decade earlier by Philip Henslowe, and the two Shoreditch playhouses, the Theatre and the Curtain, built in 1576&#150;7. (The fifth playhouse, at Newington Butts, was being dismantled even as the Swan was being built.) A year or so after its erection the Swan was described by the Dutch traveller Johannes de Witt as the largest and most magnificent of London's playhouses. But its success as a business venture never matched its opulence, and the reason for this failing lay most probably in the personality of its owner. Langley was an ambitious entrepreneur and speculator, not at all a patron of drama. His chief ambition was to be wealthy and respected; he pursued wealth on many fronts, moneylending chief among them. The ownership of a playhouse was but one move&#151;and by no means the best move&#151;towards his goal.<br>
<br>The Swan playhouse was itself built on speculation. In London at the time there were three or four companies of stage players for every available playhouse, and the imminent prohibition of inn yards as places of performance was soon to make the shortage of playing space even more acute. Langley was certain that if he built a playhouse he would attract companies of players wishing to become tenants, and he appears, initially at least, to have been right. The Swan was occupied almost immediately, though the identity of its occupants during its first year or two is unknown. Speculation has suggested that Shakespeare's company, the Lord Chamberlain's players, may have used the Swan for a time in 1596 as a way of testing out a Bankside location for their own anticipated move from Shoreditch. Indeed, Langley's name is curiously joined with Shakespeare's in a writ of attachment sworn out in 1596 by one William Wayte against &#145;Willelmum Shakspere Franciscum Langley&#146; and two otherwise unknown women; Wayte claimed that these four people constituted a threat to his life and safety. Nothing further is known about this teasing claim.<br>
<br>The first occupants of the Swan of whom we have any record, the earl of Pembroke's players, became a topic of controversy in July and August 1597 for having performed a play called <span class="italic">The Isle of Dogs</span> that was reported to the privy council as being seditious. The charge resulted in the arrests of Gabriel Spencer, Robert Shaa, and Ben Jonson&#151;all players in the Pembroke company, and one a playwright as well&#151;and in the hasty flight from London of Thomas Nashe, one of the play's authors. After a few weeks the arrested players were released and the matter was quietly dropped, suggesting that the charge of sedition had been found baseless. As the play itself has not survived, there is only circumstantial evidence and the testimony of self-interested witnesses to go on. But there is strong evidence that during 1596 and 1597 Langley himself had fallen into disfavour and had incurred the enmity of Robert Cecil. Given those circumstances, the Swan was perceived from that point onwards as an undesirable playhouse, and its tenants tended more towards the transient than the stable. It was used by the Masters of Defence for exhibitions of sword-fighting from time to time and was the site of Richard Vennar's fraudulent non-performance of <span class="italic">England's Joy</span> in 1602. Before long the Swan fell into decay.<br>
<br>Robert Cecil's animosity towards Langley had begun when Langley became implicated in the theft of an enormous diamond from a Spanish carrack, the <i>Madre de Dios</i>, captured by English seamen in 1592. Most of the ship's cargo was plundered by its captors, and the diamond, a special prize, soon came into Langley's hands. Cecil pursued Langley for many years in an effort to recover the stone in the queen's name (the harassment at the Swan over <span class="italic">The Isle of Dogs</span> in 1597 may have been part of this pursuit). But Langley managed somehow to stay just beyond Cecil's grasp, though his evasiveness contributed to his eventual impoverishment and also destroyed the career of his brother-in-law Anthony Ashley, one of the clerks of the privy council.<br>
<br>Langley overreached himself in other arenas as well. After fourteen years of disgraceful performance in his post as City alnager, marked by numerous lawsuits, he was ejected from the office in 1599 by the court of aldermen. By the following year his financial adventurism had brought him into serious debt, and he was forced to sell the manor of Paris Garden, with its playhouse, to Hugh Browker, a perennially hostile neighbour.<br>
<br>Langley was by now in his early fifties and on the verge of bankruptcy. His final failed adventure was in Cardiganshire, where he nourished hopes of extracting silver from an abandoned lead mine which he believed he had acquired. But he was ill, and his old shrewdness was gone. Sir Lewis Lewkenor got the better of him in this scheme, and at the age of fifty-four Langley died penniless, leaving his widow, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ashley (<i>d</i>. after 1608), with six children and a swarm of lawsuits to contend with. He was buried on 9 July 1602 in St Saviour's Church (now Southwark Cathedral).<br>
