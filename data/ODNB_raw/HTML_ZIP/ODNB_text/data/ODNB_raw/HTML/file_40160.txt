<span class="headword">Hopkinson, Sir  (Henry) Thomas</span>  (1905&#150;1990), <span class="occ">journalist and magazine editor</span>, was born on 19 April 1905 in Victoria Park, Manchester, the second child and second son in the family of four sons and one daughter of John Henry Hopkinson (son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33980/', "Sir Alfred Hopkinson")</script>), lecturer in classical archaeology at the University of Manchester, who soon took holy orders and eventually became archdeacon of Westmorland, and his wife, Evelyn Mary, schoolteacher, daughter of the Revd Henry Thomas Fountaine, vicar of Sutton Bridge, Lincolnshire. Hopkinson went to St Edward's School, Oxford, with the financial assistance of a wealthy uncle, Austin Hopkinson MP, and then won a classical scholarship to Pembroke College, Oxford, where he obtained a second class in classical honour moderations (1925) and a third in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1927).<br>
<br>For seven years Hopkinson lived in London by freelance journalism and copywriting in Crawford's advertising agency. After the publication of his first book, <span class="italic">A Strong Hand at the Helm</span> (1933), an acerbic commentary on the failings of Ramsay MacDonald's government, Hopkinson transferred in 1934 to Odhams Press, where he became assistant editor of <span class="italic">The Clarion</span>, a weekly that combined cycling news with Labour youth propaganda. In the same year this was incorporated into <span class="italic">Weekly Illustrated</span>, which Stefan Lorant, a gifted Hungarian refugee, had persuaded Odhams to launch. When in the summer of 1938 Lorant achieved the backing of Edward Hulton in launching <span class="italic">Picture Post</span>, Hopkinson joined as assistant editor, taking over as editor when Lorant, fearing a German invasion, emigrated to the USA in July 1940. The magazine had been expected to sell 250,000 copies at most; soon it was selling more than 1,500,000 a week.<br>
<br>Lorant was an outstanding photojournalist and trained Hopkinson to use pictures with equal flair. Hopkinson added a campaigning streak of his own, often contrasting the lives of the rich with the reality of poverty and deprivation, picturing, he hoped, the lives of ordinary people with the eye of a Rembrandt. Hopkinson was an excellent caption writer and always stressed the need for words to reinforce the message of his pictures. He gained the affection and devotion of his staff, displaying an almost donnish approach to their work and a total lack of pretension. His cool professional judgement contrasted with some turbulence in his emotional life, just as a remarkably tidy office contrasted with the turmoil and tension needed to bring out a weekly magazine. His slightly enigmatic personality and ability to adapt to people masked his true political convictions. He certainly attempted to encapsulate the socialist dream of a more just society. As the Second World War progressed, he paid particular attention to the problems that would arise when peace finally arrived. With a talented team of photographers and reporters, hand-picked by Hopkinson, <span class="italic">Picture Post</span> became immensely influential in setting the mood of the country and may well have made a contribution to the Labour victory in the 1945 election.<br>
<br>Growing tension between Hulton, who was a Conservative, and Hopkinson finally came to a head in October 1950 over a powerful picture story, from photographer Bert Hardy and journalist James Cameron, highlighting the appalling plight of so-called political prisoners in Korea, some of them children, under the western-backed regime of Syngman Rhee. Hulton refused to allow the magazine to print it and, with the support of a pliant board including his second wife, Nika, sacked Hopkinson. Without his inspired editorship <span class="italic">Picture Post</span> soon lost its way and was closed in 1957. After freelancing for a few years Hopkinson joined the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> in 1954. He resigned two years later because he believed the paper was destroying itself. In 1957 he was asked to edit <span class="italic">Drum</span>, the African picture magazine based in Johannesburg, and he took up the post early in 1958. However, the magazine did not offer quite the same opportunities and eventually he fell out with the proprietor, resigning in 1961, after three and a half years. In March 1963 he launched the International Press Institute's training centre for black journalists in Nairobi, Kenya, staying there as director until 1966. He then moved on to the academic training of journalists, becoming senior fellow in press studies at the University of Sussex (1967&#150;9). Finally, in 1970 he became the first director of the centre for journalism studies at University College, Cardiff, a post he held until 1975. Eventually he became the virtual godfather of photojournalism and did much to increase the standing of photographers in their profession. Hopkinson was also fairly successful as a writer of short stories and novels. As a writer he was a perfectionist, sometimes staying up all night to find the right word. He was appointed CBE in 1967 and knighted in 1978. He was an honorary fellow of the Royal Photographic Society (1976) and won its silver progress medal (1984), and had an honorary degree of LittD from Wales (1990).<br>
<br>Hopkinson was always beautifully dressed, a neat composed figure with a rather florid face, which gave him the air of a countryman. In 1930 he married the novelist Antonia White (<i>d</i>. 1980) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38276/', "Hopkinson, Eirene Adeline")</script>], daughter of Cecil George Botting, senior classics master at St Paul's School. She became increasingly unbalanced and they were divorced in 1938. In October 1938 he married Gerti Deutsch, an Austrian photographer, whose father Victor Deutsch was a rope manufacturer. The marriage was dissolved in 1953 and in the same year he married Dorothy, daughter of Thomas Vernon, musician, and widow of Hugh Kingsmill. Hopkinson had one daughter from his first marriage and two from his second. Towards the end of his life he came to believe in reincarnation. He died of cancer on 20 June 1990, in Oxford, where his home was 26 Boulter Street, St Clements.<br>
