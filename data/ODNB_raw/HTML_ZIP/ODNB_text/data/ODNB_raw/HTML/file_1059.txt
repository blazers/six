<span class="headword">Baillie,  Charles</span>, Lord Jerviswoode  (1804&#150;1879), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born at Mellerstain, Berwickshire, on 3 November 1804, the second son of George Baillie of Mellerstain, Berwickshire, and of Jerviswoode, Lanarkshire, and his wife, Mary, the youngest daughter of Sir James Pringle, baronet, of Stichill, Roxburghshire. He studied at St Andrews University, matriculating in 1823, and at Edinburgh University from 1826. Baillie married the Hon. Anne Hepburn Scott (<i>d</i>. 1880), daughter of the fourth Baron Polwarth, on 27 December 1831. They had a son and two daughters who survived to maturity.<br>
<br>Baillie was admitted as an advocate to the Scottish bar in 1830 and the influence of his family connections now helped secure his rapid rise in his chosen profession. One of his sisters was marchioness of Breadalbane, another was countess of Aberdeen, a third was Lady Polwarth, and a fourth was countess of Ashburton. Baillie was described as linked more completely to the Scottish nobility than any other lawyer of his generation.<br>
<br>Baillie was advocate-depute from 1844 to 1846, in Sir Robert Peel's second ministry, and again in 1852 in Lord Derby's short-lived first administration. He was appointed sheriff of Stirlingshire, on the recommendation of Lord Advocate James Moncreiff, a political opponent, on 2 March 1853, and he acted in that capacity until, on the re-accession of Lord Derby to power, he was made solicitor-general for Scotland in February 1858. Later, in July of that year, he was appointed lord advocate of Scotland in succession to John Inglis, who had been raised to the bench. This necessitated finding a seat in the House of Commons and Baillie was returned unopposed as Conservative member for Linlithgowshire in early February 1859. He had, however, represented this constituency for little more than two months when, in April 1859, he also was raised to the Scottish bench as a judge of the court of session. He held this position, under the courtesy title of Lord Jerviswoode, for the following fifteen years, from 1872 serving in the first division of the court. For twelve of these years he also sat in the supreme criminal court, having been appointed, in June 1862, a lord of justiciary.<br>
<br>As a counsel, Baillie had a fair but quiet practice. He was distinguished more for his deliberation than for his forensic ability, and he discouraged lengthy, contentious litigation. As a judge he had a reputation for courtesy, sagacity, patient and painstaking investigation, competent learning, and probity. He was held, however, to lack originality and to be so habitually laconic in his explanations that one commentator described him as &#145;deficient in the arts of expression&#146;. In 1859 his elder brother, George, became tenth earl of Haddington. Together with his two younger brothers, Baillie was raised at the same time by royal warrant to the rank and precedence of an earl's son.<br>
<br>Jerviswoode officiated as convenor of the acting committee of the Wallace monument, a symbol of the mid-century revival of interest in Scottish national identity, erected on the Abbey Craig, Stirling. In 1861 he was elected assessor of the University of St Andrews. He was a trustee of the Board of Manufactures of Scotland. For a number of years he was the president of the Edinburgh Border Counties Association and in that capacity took an active part in the movements to celebrate the centenary of the birth of Sir Walter Scott.<br>
<br>Owing to ill health, in 1874 Jerviswoode retired with a pension from the bench and from public life to his country residence, Dryburgh House, near St Boswells, Roxburghshire. Here he lived in some seclusion until his death on 23 July 1879. His wife died the following summer.<br>
<br>Jerviswoode's more general significance as a political and judicial figure lies in his being one of a number of Scottish tories whose political careers were very much limited by the dominance of the Liberal Party in Scottish politics at this time, but who found an alternative prominence and influence on the Scottish bench. David Mure, whose career Jerviswoode's closely parallels, was another such figure, as were John Inglis and, from a slightly older generation, Duncan McNeill and John Hope.<br>
