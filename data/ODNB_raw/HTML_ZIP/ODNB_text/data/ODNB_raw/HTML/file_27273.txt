<span class="headword">Thompson,  John Vaughan</span>  (1779&#150;1847), <span class="occ">surgeon and naturalist</span>, was born on 19 November 1779, in Berwick, the son of John Thompson and his wife, Jane Hall, both of Berwick. That he had an early interest in the natural history of the area is demonstrated by the preparation, before he left Berwick and England, of his <span class="italic">Catalogue of Plants Growing in the Vicinity of Berwick upon Tweed</span> (1807). His skill as a botanist is revealed in this work, which, according to Britten (1912), exhibited &#145;a very complete knowledge of the plants of that region and of the literature of the period&#146; and the talent of &#145;a capable artist&#146;. The <span class="italic">Catalogue</span> also refers to the botanical guidance given to Thompson by William Percival Pickford of Edinburgh, presumably when he was a medical student in that city in 1797 and 1798. In addition to botany Thompson studied chemistry, anatomy, midwifery, and surgery, presumably with some distinction, as at the age of twenty he was appointed as assistant surgeon to the Prince of Wales's fencibles.<br>
<br>In December 1799 Thompson sailed with the 37th regiment for Gibraltar, and three months later accompanied it to the West Indies and Guiana where British troops were engaged in fierce fighting against the Dutch. Thompson was in the Caribbean for nine years, rising in rank to full surgeon in 1803. While there he continued his interests in natural history, describing a new species of pouched rat from Jamaica, and observing the spawning behaviour of land crabs. Towards the end of 1809 Thompson returned to England and was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society on 6 February 1810. In 1812 he sailed for the Indian Ocean, where he spent four years attached to the garrisons of Madagascar and Mauritius. Given the title of government agent for Madagascar, he undertook important political duties in addition to his medical practice. He also spent considerable time exploring the natural history of the two islands. He discovered in Madagascar a plant for which Robert Brown erected the genus <i>Thompsonia</i> (now <i>Deidamia</i>) and researched the island's extinct birds, eventually writing an article on the dodo for the <span class="italic">Magazine of Natural History</span> (1829). Thompson also produced <span class="italic">A Catalogue of the Exotic Plants Cultivated in the Mauritius</span> (1816), the first list of the island's plants.<br>
<br>Thompson returned to Britain in 1816 and was posted to Cork in southern Ireland as surgeon to the forces. By 1830 he had attained the senior rank of deputy inspector-general of hospitals, an appointment he held at Cork until 1835. In that year he was posted as medical officer in charge of the convict settlements of New South Wales, and never returned to Europe.<br>
<br>Although his publications reveal an early interest in marine bioluminescence (he later wrote vividly about the phenomenon he witnessed first off Gibraltar about 1810) it was on the voyage home from the Mascarene Islands in 1816 that Thompson first used a fine-meshed net to try and capture the organisms that caused it. Writing about the experience he stated<blockquote>Individually I feel under great obligations to this beautiful little animal, which by its splendid appearance in the water induced me to commence the use of a muslin hoop-net, which when it failed to procure me a specimen, brought up such a profusion of other marine animals altogether invisible while in the sea, as to induce a continued use of it on every favourable opportunity.</blockquote>The &#145;beautiful animal&#146;  (J. V. Thompson, <span class="italic">Zoological Researches and Illustrations, 1828&#150;1834</span>, 1968, 47) was a copepod (Crustacea) that he later named <i>Sapphirina indicator</i>. Thompson not only mastered the use of a fine-meshed net from a moving vessel, but also developed the ingenious method of fastening the net over the spout of the ship's sea water pumps&#151;arguably the first use of a continuous plankton sampler.<br>
<br>In terms of his scientific work, Thompson's years at Cork were those of his most productive research, through which he:<blockquote>secured a permanent place in zoological literature through his discoveries of the nature and life histories of the feather star &hellip;, the polyzoa, the cirripedes (or barnacles) and several divisions of the crustacea. Our present conceptions of the structure of these forms, of their zoological position, and of the metamorphoses which they undergo, date from Thompson's papers. (<span class="italic">DNB</span>)</blockquote>Thompson's privately printed series of memoirs on marine biology, his <span class="italic">Zoological researches and illustrations, or, Natural history of nondescript or imperfectly known animals</span> was conceived either in 1826 or early in 1827. This series of six memoirs (in five numbers) appeared between 1828 and 1834.<br>
<br>Thompson published his <span class="italic">Memoir on the Pentacrinus europeaus</span> in 1827 and an erratum slip for this paper issued in May 1827 announced his intention to publish <span class="italic">Zoological Researches</span>. This paper was more fully developed in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh New Philosophical Transactions</span> in 1836, and its startling conclusions&#151;that crinoids were echinoderms and that the <i>Pentacrinus</i> was a young stage of the feather star <i>Antedon</i>&#151;attracted the notice of zoologists throughout Europe. However, the <span class="italic">Zoological Researches</span> became the principal vehicle for Thompson's discoveries. His skill with the plankton net&#151;developed on the voyage from Mauritius&#151;was used to good effect in the waters off Cork, and the majority of the papers published in the <span class="italic">Researches</span> relate to the metamorphosis of marine animals (mainly Crustacea) that he found in the plankton. These were remarkable and original discoveries. Thompson's observation of the metamorphosis of the <i>Zoea</i> larva of the edible crab (then regarded as a species in its own right) into an adult led to his suggestion that larval stages and metamorphosis were universal in decapod Crustacea. This view was criticized by N. A. Vigors, editor of the <span class="italic">Zoological Journal</span>, who felt that this was a sweeping conclusion, and Thompson's opinions remained controversial.<br>
<br>Thompson's discoveries of metamorphosis in barnacles enabled him to place the cirripedes within the Crustacea, rather than one of the classes of Mollusca, a major zoological achievement. It was in light of Thompson's major re-evaluation of barnacles as Crustacea&#151;not molluscs as had previously been thought&#151;that Darwin was able definitively to monograph the group in the early 1850s. More controversially, Thompson erected the name Polyzoa at the same time as Ehrenberg proposed the name Bryozoa for the same group of small colonial invertebrates. This caused confusion and controversy for many years, resolved only as late as 1947. However, Thompson's work on this group of animals was as meticulous as all his previous research, and his dissections and figures of them were a major contribution to understanding their structure, classification, and relationships. Thompson died in Sydney on 21 January 1847.<br>
<br>Thompson's studies in marine biology, published in a relatively short period between 1823 and 1836, revolutionized some aspects of zoological thought. His name is unfamiliar however, even to marine zoologists, partly because of the general absorption of his discoveries and the waning of the controversies his research caused. He has not escaped recognition entirely, however, with distinguished naturalists including Charles Darwin, E. R. Lankester, T. R. R. Stebbing, C. M. Yonge, and Sir Sidney Harmer recognizing and paying tribute to his genius. The reproduction of a facsimile of the <span class="italic">Zoological Researches</span> in 1968 has also enabled his contribution to science to be better appreciated.<br>
