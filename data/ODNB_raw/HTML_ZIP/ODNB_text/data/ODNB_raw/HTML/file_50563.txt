<span class="headword">Beale, Sir  Samuel Richard</span>  (1881&#150;1964), <span class="occ">engineer and industrialist</span>, was born in Birmingham on 7 February 1881, one of two sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49726/', "James Samuel Beale (1840&#150;1912)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49729/', "Beale family")</script>], solicitor and company director, and his wife, Margaret Field. He was educated at Marlborough College, and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he achieved an engineering degree and a rowing blue. In 1908 he married Sylvia Constance Bell (<i>d</i>. 1953); they had three sons.<br>
<br>Beale's father had been chairman of L. Sterne &amp; Co. Ltd, a Glasgow-based engineering firm, since 1882; and in 1903 Beale took up an apprenticeship with the company. His father had built up its traditional products of railway springs, emery wheels, and grinding machines, and he had also diversified into refrigerating equipment so that, when his son joined the company, refrigeration was the largest single element in the firm's turnover.<br>
<br>Beale began his training in the pattern shop at the company's headquarters&#151;the Crown ironworks in North Woodside Road, Glasgow. He soon saw that the works were in need of reorganization and that the management had become very conservative. Profits were, consequently, less than they had been in earlier years. His opportunity to improve matters came very quickly, in 1905, only two years after he had joined the firm, when John Guthrie, the commercial manager, became ill and Beale was asked to take over the role. His authority, however, seems to have extended beyond the normal tasks associated with his job title. Despite resistance from his father, and in the face of complaints from Guthrie, he had a new machine shop built for the manufacturing of emery wheels, and new machinery, including radial drills, installed, all of which added greatly to the cost competitiveness of the firm. Improvements in the manufacture of springs met with modest success, but Beale was particularly interested in the refrigeration side of the business. Accordingly, Louis Sterne, the founder of the company, and chairman from 1912, brought back some small refrigerators from one of his frequent trips to the United States. One of the machines which found its way to the Crown ironworks was a Remington refrigerator, which Beale set about improving.<br>
<br>It was not just domestic refrigeration in which Beale was interested, however, for in the early years of the twentieth century the iron industry was involved in a dry-blasting process for pig-iron manufacture which necessitated refrigeration installations of 200&#150;300 tons capacity. Beale senior, encouraged by his son, obtained a contract from Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds (GKN), in which he had an interest, to build the necessary equipment in south Wales. The Commercial Bank of Scotland lent &pound;10,000 to L. Sterne &amp; Co. for the purpose, but GKN eventually decided that the method was not economical and abandoned it. Experiences such as this doubtless confirmed the company in its rather cautious policy.<br>
<br>When Beale's father died in 1912, Sterne became chairman and Beale joined the board as general manager. Under his direction large projects were not neglected, despite the earlier experience with the iron industry. In 1915 the firm obtained a contract, for sizeable cold stores, from the Port of London Authority and several years later similar work was undertaken for the Clyde Cold Storage Company. Other large land-based products included a very large number of ice rinks, including those at Earls Court and Wembley, London. It was not until the First World War that Beale decided to enter the marine refrigeration business.<br>
<br>In the inter-war years Beale pursued a policy of rationalization. Many firms did likewise in these difficult years and achieved only a contraction in their business; but Beale was more successful and his well-judged policies resulted in an expansion of the company. He was the first Englishman to become president of the Glasgow chamber of commerce (1929) and several years later he served as president of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. In politics he was an active Unionist and served for a time as president of the St Rollox Unionist Association.<br>
<br>In 1924 Sterne died and Beale's brother, Sir John F. Beale (1874&#150;1935), was brought in as chairman, leaving Samuel as managing director. The death of Sir John in 1935 led to Samuel replacing him as chairman of L. Sterne &amp; Co., though in a non-executive capacity. At the same time he succeeded his brother as chairman of GKN. Apart from his interests in L. Sterne &amp; Co. and its associated and subsidiary companies, he was also a director of other leading engineering firms such as Glenfield and Kennedy Ltd and Mavor and Coulson Ltd. None of these firms specialized in GKN's main lines of business, but with extensive managerial experience and also being &#145;Ambitious and able, Beale was an obvious candidate for the chairmanship&#146;  (Jones, 2.283).<br>
<br>Just before going to England, Beale sent his nephew Peter Brown to North America to identify a firm that produced a small automatic type of refrigerator. Brown found what he was looking for in Ontario, where the Universal Cooler Company had developed just such a machine. L. Sterne &amp; Co. acquired the patent rights, and the Sternette, perhaps the firm's most famous product, came into being with the minimum of development costs. Variants of this machine were produced for domestic use to meet the growing consumer demand for household refrigerators.<br>
<br>The Second World War broke out before Beale could make much of a contribution to GKN, and the firm was then turned over to war production. In 1940 he became a member of the Export Council, which worked to promote exports to help fund the war effort and to allocate scarce industrial materials sensibly, and for a time he served as chairman of this committee. In addition he also served on the consultative council appointed to advise the Treasury on financial problems arising from war conditions. In 1942 he was made a KBE.<br>
<br>Beale retired as chairman of GKN in 1947 but remained a director until 1951. Retirement allowed him to join the boards of Thomas Cook &amp; Son and the Scottish Amicable Life Assurance Society. He also continued to sit on the board of the Union Bank of Scotland&#151;a connection which was maintained after that bank's merger with the Bank of Scotland in 1955. In 1950 he was a director of some nineteen companies. He retired in 1960 and was succeeded as chairman of L. Sterne &amp; Co. by his nephew, Peter Brown.<br>
<br>&#145;A man with a sense of humour, Beale adopted an uncomplicated lifestyle and had the ability to make quick decisions&#146;  (Jones, 2.283). During his retirement his interests included shooting, and he divided his time between his London residence at Campden Hill and his Scottish country home, Drumlamford, at Barrhill, Ayrshire. He died at Drumlamford on 10 October 1964.<br>
