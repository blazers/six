<span class="headword">Brand, Sir  David</span>  (1837&#150;1908), <span class="occ">advocate and local politician</span>, was born in Glasgow on 27 December 1837, the eldest son of Robert Brand, a linen merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Thomson. He was educated at Glasgow Academy and the universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh before studying at Heidelberg where he graduated doctor of jurisprudence. He was admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates in 1864. In 1877 he married Elizabeth Findlay, daughter of Robert Findlay Dalziel of Paisley. A Liberal in politics, Brand was active in the registration courts in the interest of that party. He was involved in Gladstone's successful Midlothian election campaign (1880) and was rewarded with a position of advocate-depute in the Liberal government from 1880 to 1885. In 1885 he was appointed sheriff of the county of Ayr.<br>
<br>Brand was appointed chairman of the Crofters' Commission established by the <span class="roman">Crofters' Holdings (Scotland) Act</span> of 1886. The commission&#151;consisting of Brand and two colleagues&#151;was established to review rents and arrears, evaluate compensation for improvements, and administer common grazings regulations in the seven crofting counties of the north of Scotland. The first two years of the commission's work were a period of intense land agitation in the highlands. The commission acted as a peripatetic land court and its presence in the areas of unrest, its uncomplicated procedure, willingness to hear evidence in Gaelic, and a quickly established reputation for fairness, played a major role in helping to quell the agitation. Brand's part in this achievement was crucial. The fact that he assumed the chairmanship of the commission without any previous involvement in highland affairs worked in his favour, as he was able to approach issues with an open mind and an unblemished reputation. The workload of the commission in its early years was massive: between 1886 and 1893 the commission made decisions on the rents of over 14,000 crofts. On average they reduced crofting rents by about one third and cancelled about two thirds of the arrears which had arisen during the years of agitation since 1882.<br>
<br>Brand's legal expertise was important in the work of the commission, which was, essentially, a court of law. The difficulties were enormous; crofting was an entirely novel legal code and a radical departure from established land law in Scotland. The commission had to establish a body of precedence in this difficult area; the fact that very few of its decisions were the subjects of appeals is testimony to Brand's sure touch.<br>
<br>In the early 1890s the workload of the commission was decreasing and Brand chaired the royal commission (highlands and islands) in 1892. This body had the remit of identifying land being used for grazing or sport which could be transferred to crofters. Brand's political skills were taxed by the job of chairing a fractious and unpopular royal commission. The commission's report was greeted with derision and the government showed no signs of wishing to implement its recommendations before losing office in 1895.<br>
<br>Brand was also a member of the congested districts board, established in 1897 to implement the Conservative policy of land purchase in the highlands. This body was underfunded and found highland crofters to be lukewarm towards the notion of land purchase. Brand was one of the authors of the report of the Crofters' Commission &#145;on the social condition of the people of Lewis in 1901, as compared with twenty years ago&#146;, published as a parliamentary paper in 1902 and retaining a permanent value as a survey of crofting life in the Hebrides. In June 1907 he was knighted. By then his health was failing and for the last two years of his life he played little active role in the Crofters' Commission or on the congested districts board. Brand died at his home, 42 Coates Gardens, Edinburgh, on 22 January 1908 and was buried at Dean cemetery, Edinburgh on 25 January. He was survived by his wife, son, and three daughters.<br>
