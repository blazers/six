<span class="headword">Adams, Sir  Grantley Herbert</span>  (1898&#150;1971), <span class="occ">prime minister of the Federation of the West Indies</span>, was born on 28 April 1898 in Bridgetown, Barbados, the second of six sons (there was also a daughter) of Fitzherbert Adams, a primary school headmaster, and his wife, Rosa Frances Turner. Education mattered in his family and Adams won a scholarship to Harrison College and then the coveted Barbados scholarship. He entered St Catherine's Society, Oxford, in 1918, took part in undergraduate Liberal politics, played much cricket, and was president of the junior common room. He obtained third classes in classical honour moderations in 1921 and jurisprudence in 1923.<br>
<br>After being called to the bar (Gray's Inn) in 1923, Adams returned home where he built a reputation as a shrewd, forceful barrister. He was also a leader writer for the conservative <span class="italic">Agricultural Reporter</span>, but as the West Indies sank ever deeper into the depression of the 1930s, his politics became more radical as he took up the cause of the Barbadian working man. In 1934 he was elected a member of the house of assembly for St Joseph, surprisingly beating a white planter; he soon proved to be as adept at politics as he was at the bar. After serious riots in July 1937, the radicals sent Adams to London to press for a royal commission to examine West Indian conditions. In 1939 the Moyne commission went to the Caribbean.<br>
<br>This London visit had important consequences for Adams. He became friends with Labour Party members who were interested in the colonies, such as Sir R. Stafford Cripps, Arthur Creech Jones, and Rita Hinden; his vague but deeply felt radicalism was channelled into Fabian socialism. He also saw the need for a political party backed by a trade union. On his return he helped to found the Barbados Progressive League in 1938, from which were soon to spring the Barbados Workers' Union and the Barbados Labour Party which was led by Adams.<br>
<br>Adams was appointed by the governor to the executive committee in 1942, and made leader of the house of assembly when the Barbados Labour Party won nine seats, a bare majority, in 1946. In 1954 Adams, who had become QC (Barbados) in 1953 and who was by then a respected Caribbean statesman, became premier. Yet when Barbados became independent in 1966, Adams and his party were in opposition after a defeat by the Democratic Labour Party.<br>
<br>Despite his Barbadian preoccupations, Adams played his part in the wider world of cold war diplomacy in the immediate post-war years, the most successful of his life. He was in the British delegation at the first meeting of the United Nations in 1948 when he eloquently defended the British colonial record; he was appointed to the committee of experts of the International Labour Organization in 1949; he was president of the Caribbean Labour Congress and vice-chairman of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions when these bodies were fighting against communist domination.<br>
<br>Even before the war Adams believed that the solution to the problems of the Caribbean colonies lay in a federation. After the war he played a leading part in the planning conferences at Montego Bay in 1947 and London in 1953 and 1956. He became leader of the new Federal Labour Party and the first and, as it turned out, the only prime minister of the Federation of the West Indies in 1958. For various reasons Jamaica and Trinidad, the most powerful members, dropped out, leaving behind the fatally weakened rump of the small islands and Barbados. The federation staggered on until 1962, and a frustrated and bitterly disappointed Adams returned to the parochial world of leading the opposition in Barbados. After increasing illness he resigned his seat in 1970.<br>
<br>Adams belonged to that generation of English-educated nationalist politicians such as Norman Manley of Jamaica and Eric Williams of Trinidad who led their countries towards independence and ensured that they followed the Westminster model afterwards. In Barbados he broke the planter domination of society, encouraged economic diversification, and laid the foundations for a welfare state.<br>
<br>In private life Adams was amiable and witty and he delighted in the post-war flowering of West Indian cricket. He married Grace Thorne, who was from a white planter family, in 1929; this was in itself a portent of social change. Their only child, Tom (1931&#150;1985) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30749/', "Adams, John Michael Geoffrey Manningham")</script>], was a prime minister of Barbados in the 1970s.<br>
<br>Adams was appointed CMG in 1952 and knighted in 1957. In 1958 he received an honorary DLitt from Mount Allison. He died at Bridgetown on 28 November 1971.<br>
