<span class="headword">Somerset, Lord  (Robert) Edward Henry</span>  (1776&#150;1842), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, usually known as Lord Edward Somerset, was born on 19 December 1776, the fourth surviving son of the thirteen children (nine boys and four girls) of Henry Somerset, fifth duke of Beaufort (1744&#150;1803), and his wife, Elizabeth (1747&#150;1828), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2931/', "Admiral Edward Boscawen")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37992/', "Lord Charles Henry Somerset")</script> was his elder brother; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26007/', "Lord FitzRoy James Henry Somerset, first Baron Raglan")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47305/', "Lord John Thomas Henry Somerset")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26007/', "Somerset, FitzRoy James Henry")</script>] were his younger brothers. Following his education at Westminster School, on 4 February 1793 he became a cornet in the 10th light dragoons, advancing to lieutenant in December 1793 and captain on 28 August 1794. After having been made aide-de-camp to the duke of York, commander of the expedition to the Helder peninsula, he took part in actions on 19 September and 2 and 6 October 1799. On 21 November 1799 Somerset was promoted major in the 12th light dragoons, and the following year moved to the 28th light dragoons. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel on 25 December 1800, and transferred to the 4th dragoons in that rank on 3 September 1801. He sat as MP for Monmouth (1799&#150;1802) and Gloucestershire (1803&#150;29), and defended his brother Lord Charles Henry in the House of Commons in 1826 and 1827 against charges of professional misconduct as governor of the Cape of Good Hope. Two years later, after initially opposing it, he supported Roman Catholic emancipation.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, the 4th dragoons had gone to Portugal in April 1809, where Somerset commanded it at Talavera (27&#150;8 July 1809) and Busaco (27 September 1810), having been promoted colonel and appointed aide-de-camp to the king on 25 July 1810. At Usagre (25 May 1811) the 4th dragoons, with the 3rd dragoon guards, rode down two French cavalry regiments, causing 170 casualties and taking ninety-five prisoners. Somerset led the regiment in the charge of Le Marchant's heavy brigade at Salamanca (22 July 1812), breaking through three columns of infantry and capturing five guns, for which he earned special mention in Wellington's victory dispatch.<br>
<br>On 4 June 1813, on Wellington's recommendation, Somerset was promoted major-general and presented with a sword of honour by the officers of his regiment. He was given command of the hussar brigade (7th, 10th, and 15th), with which he fought at Vitoria (21 June 1813), the Pyrenees (28&#150;30 July 1813), Orthez (27 February 1814), and Toulouse (10 April 1814). At Orthez his brigade decisively charged the retreating French infantry, securing a large number of prisoners, and once more he was praised in Wellington's post-battle dispatch. He received the thanks of parliament (26 June 1814) and the Peninsular gold cross with one clasp for his services at Talavera, Salamanca, Vitoria, Orthez, and Toulouse. He was also made KCB in January 1815.<br>
<br>At the battle of Waterloo Somerset commanded the household brigade of cavalry, consisting of the 1st and 2nd Life Guards, the Royal Horse Guards (Blue), and the 1st dragoon guards, totalling 1135 rank and file. Shortly after 2 p.m., led by Lord Uxbridge, the brigade charged downhill against d'Erlon's corps of massed infantry, which had attacked Wellington's left, east of the Charleroi&#150;Brussels road. It swept through Dubois's brigade of Milhaud's cuirassiers, which was on d'Erlon's left, but, imprudently, pursued the broken enemy across the valley until attacked by lancers and by a fresh brigade of cuirassiers, losing heavily as it retired. Somerset had a horse killed under him and a flap of his collar struck by a cannon ball, but he was otherwise unscathed. Despite incurring heavy loss in this action, the brigade acquitted itself well later that afternoon as French cavalry and infantry probed in strength west of the Brussels road. During the early evening it was joined by the Union brigade, which had charged d'Erlon on Somerset's left and suffered even more severely, and guarded the part of the British line immediately to the west of La Haye-Sainte. Here the two brigades suffered such further loss from the enemy's fire that their seven regiments ultimately formed only one squadron of about fifty files. The fire was so severe that Uxbridge, the overall cavalry commander, urged Somerset to withdraw his men, who were extended in single rank to show a larger front; but Somerset feared that, if he moved, the Dutch cavalry behind him would not stand firm.<br>
<br>To his brother Beaufort, Somerset referred to &#145;so dreadful a battle&#146;, adding that &#145;fine alarm and confusion&#146; had reigned in Brussels on 18 June with many families fleeing to Antwerp. Lord FitzRoy, who had lost his right arm, was &#145;doing as well as possible&#146;  (Badminton Muniments, Fm 3/4/1), and he solicitously informed his mother that her youngest son &#145;mends wonderfully&#146;  (Raglan MSS, RPP 1/28). In his dispatch Wellington recommended Somerset's &#145;highly distinguished&#146; conduct for the prince regent's &#145;approbation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dispatches</span>, 12.482&#150;3); Somerset received the thanks of parliament (29 April 1816) as well as the orders of Maria Theresa (Austria), St Vladimir (Russia), and the Tower and Sword (Portugal).<br>
<br>Somerset was appointed to command the 1st brigade of cavalry in the army of occupation in France on 30 November 1815, and he held this command until the army was withdrawn at the end of 1818. He afterwards held the post of inspecting-general of cavalry until his promotion to the rank of lieutenant-general on 27 May 1825. Having been appointed colonel of the 21st light dragoons on 15 January 1818, on its disbandment he became colonel of the 17th lancers (9 September 1822), then of the 1st dragoons (23 November 1829). On 31 March 1836 he was appointed colonel of his old regiment, now the 4th light dragoons. He served as lieutenant-general of the ordnance in 1829&#150;30 and as surveyor-general of the ordnance for a short time in 1835. Somerset was made GCB in 1834 and became general on 23 November 1841. He died in London on 1 September 1842 from a long-standing heart complaint after a recent &#145;violent&#146; attack in Geneva, and was buried a week later, on 8 September. He had married, on 17 October 1805, Louisa Augusta (<i>d</i>. 1823), the twelfth daughter of William, second Viscount Courtenay. They had two sons, Edward Arthur and Augustus Charles Stapleton, both commissioned into the army, and five daughters, three of whom were unmarried at their father's death.<br>
