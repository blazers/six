<span class="headword">Spencer,  George</span>, fourth duke of Marlborough  (1739&#150;1817), <span class="occ">politician</span>, born on 26 January 1739, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26118/', "Charles Spencer, third duke of Marlborough and fifth earl of Sunderland (1706&#150;1758)")</script>, and his wife, Elizabeth Trevor (<i>d</i>. 1761), the daughter of Thomas Trevor, second Baron Trevor. The artist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1848/', "Lady Diana Beauclerk")</script> was his sister. Following education at Eton College he obtained an ensigncy on 14 June 1755 in the Coldstream Guards, and on 12 June 1756 was gazetted captain of the 20th foot. On succeeding to the peerage two years later he left the army.<br>
<br>In politics, Marlborough shook off the influence of his father's leader, Henry Fox, and &#145;flung himself totally on Lord Harcourt to direct his conduct in the County of Oxford&#146;  (<span class="italic">Grenville Papers</span>, 1.297&#150;8), of which he was named lord lieutenant on 21 March 1760. At the coronation of George III, on 22 September 1761, he was bearer of the sceptre and cross. On 22 November the following year he was appointed lord chamberlain and sworn of the privy council. On 23 August 1762 he married Lady Caroline Russell (1743&#150;1811), the only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24320/', "John Russell, fourth duke of Bedford")</script>, and his second wife, Gertrude Leveson-Gower. They had three sons and five daughters. Marlborough's marriage ensured that he was an important member of the Bedford faction, and in the Grenville ministry, though still under thirty, he held office as lord privy seal from April 1763 to July 1765. On 27 July, after some delay occasioned by George III's attempts to induce them to stay in&#151;a delay which was thought &#145;rather extraordinary&#146;&#151;he and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26119/', "Lord Charles Spencer")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26118/', "Spencer, Charles, third duke of Marlborough")</script>] resigned their offices. In November 1766 he assured his uncle and father-in-law, the duke of Bedford, that he should &#145;not join Lord Temple to oppose your grace&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of John, Fourth Duke of Bedford</span>, 3.357), and for the present did not desire office. He was, however, ambitious of obtaining the Garter, and Bedford obtained from Chatham the promise of it on the next vacancy. But Cumberland was given the next Garter&#151;in order to spite the Bedfords, according to Horace Walpole&#151;and Marlborough did not obtain the coveted honour until 12 December 1768 and was not installed until 25 July 1771.<br>
<br>On 29 January 1779 Walpole wrote to Horace Mann that Marlborough and Lord Pembroke had declared against &#145;the First Lord of the Admiralty&#146; (the earl of Sandwich) in the celebrated politico-naval dispute that followed Admiral Keppel's action off Ushant. Marlborough even forbade his brother Lord Charles Spencer to attend parliament during Keppel's trial  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Journal</span>, 2.325&#150;6). Marlborough took relatively little part in political affairs after his early years, and for the most part lived quietly at Blenheim, although he remained a figure of some importance in electoral terms on account of his influence in the boroughs of Woodstock, Oxford, and Heytesbury and in the county of Oxfordshire. In 1762 he had purchased most of Zanetti's gems at Venice. From 1764 to 1774 he employed Capability Brown to remodel the grounds at Blenheim. He was created DCL of Oxford University on 6 July 1763 and high steward of Oxford on 23 November 1779. He presented to the university a large reflecting telescope made by James Short in 1742 and fine copies of Raphael's cartoons. In 1766 he was made high steward of Woodstock. He became an elder brother of Trinity House in 1768 and master on 22 May 1769. He was also ranger of Wychwood forest, a governor of the Charterhouse, and FRS (1786), his chief scientific interest being astronomy. He continued the income given by his father to the classical scholar Jacob Bryant. Marlborough was found dead in bed at Blenheim on 29 January 1817, and was buried there on 7 February. On his death Marlborough House, St James's, reverted to the crown, according to the terms of the original grant.<br>
<br>Of Marlborough's five daughters, Lady Caroline (1763&#150;1813) married Henry, second Lord Mendip; Anne (1773&#150;1865), the Hon. Cropley Ashley, the brother of Lord Shaftesbury; Amelia (1785&#150;1829), Henry Pytches Boyce; Elizabeth (1764&#150;1812), her cousin the Hon. John Spencer; and Charlotte (1769&#150;1802), Edward Nares, regius professor of modern history at Oxford.<br>
<br>His eldest son, <a name="cosubject_26124"></a><span class="headword">George  Spencer-Churchill</span>, fifth duke of Marlborough  (1766&#150;1840), <span class="occ">politician and book collector</span>, born George Spencer on 6 March 1766, took the additional name of Churchill by royal licence in May 1817. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, graduating MA on 9 December 1786 and DCL on 20 June 1792. He was MP for Oxfordshire from 1790 to 1796 and for Tregony from 1802 to 1804, and during the second ministry of William Pitt the younger he was a lord of the Treasury (from 7 August 1804 until 11 February 1806). On 12 March 1806 he was called to the upper house as Baron Spencer of Wormleighton. He married, on 15 September 1791, Lady Susan Stewart (1767&#150;1841), the second daughter of John Stewart, seventh earl of Galloway, and his wife, Anne Dashwood. They had four sons and two daughters; in addition he had a further six children with Matilda Glover (<i>c</i>.1802&#150;1876) and one with Mary Anne Sturt (1768&#150;1854). He spent great sums on his gardens and his library at White Knights, near Reading. In 1812 he gave &pound;2260 for Valdarfer's edition of the <span class="italic">Decameron</span> at the duke of Roxburghe's sale, and in 1815 he bought from the library of James Edwards the celebrated Bedford missal. Most of his collections were dispersed during his lifetime, and his extravagance compelled his retirement during his later years. He died at Blenheim on 5 March 1840 and was buried there on 13 March. He was succeeded as sixth duke of Marlborough by his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55618/', "George Spencer-Churchill (1793&#150;1857)")</script>.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_26129"></a><span class="headword">Lord Henry John Spencer</span>  (1770&#150;1795), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, the second son of the fourth duke, was born on 20 December 1770 and educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, where he gave great promise. He entered public life in April 1790, before he came of age, as secretary to Lord Auckland, ambassador at The Hague. He was left from September 1791 to May 1792 in sole charge of the embassy at a critical period, and established so high a reputation for discretion and vigour that he was again appointed minister-plenipotentiary to the Netherlands in May 1793. In July 1793 he went to Sweden as envoy-extraordinary. In 1795 he was appointed envoy-extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Prussia, but he died of fever at Berlin on 3 July, in his twenty-fifth year.<br>
<br>Marlborough's youngest son, <a name="cosubject_26121"></a><span class="headword">Francis Almeric Spencer</span>, first Baron Churchill of Wychwood  (1779&#150;1845), <span class="occ">politician</span>, born on 26 December 1779, was MP for Oxfordshire from 1801 to 1815, and, during the ministry of Spencer Perceval, a member of the Board of Control (from 13 November 1809 to July 1810), although he was never sworn in. In August 1815 he was created a peer as Baron Churchill of Wychwood. He married, on 25 November 1801, Lady Frances Fitzroy (<i>d</i>. 1866), the fifth daughter of Augustus Henry Fitzroy, third duke of Grafton. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26115/', "Sir Augustus Almeric Spencer")</script> was their third son. He died in Brighton on 10 March 1845.<br>
