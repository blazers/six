<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Finzi,  Gerald Raphael</span>  (1901&#150;1956), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 14 July 1901 at 53 (now 93) Hamilton Terrace, St John's Wood, London, the fifth and last child of John Abraham Finzi, known as Jack (1860&#150;1909), founder of a shipbroking company, and his wife, Eliza Emma Leverson, known as Lizzie (1865&#150;1955), daughter of Montague Richard Leverson. The family was prosperous, and both parents were musical. All seemed set fair. But just before Gerald's eighth birthday his father died of cancer. The London house was sold, and the widow moved to Camberley, where the boy attended Kingswood School. Here he was a misfit; this fostered his lifelong distrust of academic education. He made up his mind to become a composer, and faked illness to be taken away. A year in Switzerland&#151;almost his only time out of England&#151;came before the outbreak of war, when the family settled in Harrogate.<br>
<br>There Finzi studied music privately, first (1915&#150;16) with the young composer Ernest Farrar, then (1917&#150;22), when Farrar was called up, with the fine disciplinarian E. C. Bairstow, the organist of York Minster. Farrar was killed in 1918, by which time Finzi's three elder brothers had died; together with his father's death, such bereavement might have blighted Finzi's nature. Indeed, he became introspective and solitary, turning to the English poets for sustenance; but he also became single-minded and fiercely principled.<br>
<br>After the war Finzi attended two of Rutland Boughton's Glastonbury festivals in the west country, then in 1922 settled with his adoring but ineffectual mother at Painswick in Gloucestershire. Here he came to know the family of the Arts and Crafts architect Detmar Blow. Gradually Finzi was absorbing influences that shaped his life: love of England, rural beauty, simple honest craftsmanship, the importance of the amateur. Here he composed a non-liturgical <span class="italic">Requiem da camera</span> in memory of artists who died young. His early vocal compositions are notable for their poetic affiliations: settings of Henry Vaughan, Thomas Traherne, and&#151;in <span class="italic">By Footpath and Stile</span>, his first song cycle to be performed (1923) and published (1925)&#151;Thomas Hardy. His orchestral <span class="italic">Severn Rhapsody</span> won a Carnegie award, and so publication (1924).<br>
<br>In 1926 Finzi moved to London and studied counterpoint with R. O. Morris, who fostered the young composer's friendships with Gustav Holst and Ralph Vaughan Williams, already influences on his own music. Finzi also made younger lifelong friends, among them Arthur Bliss, Edmund Rubbra, and in particular Howard Ferguson. His curly blue-black hair, his intense gaze, his earnest commitment, marked him out as a personality. He eagerly grasped everything he could from London, attending concerts, opera, theatre, and exhibitions. He heard all the metropolis could offer, including Igor Stravinsky and Arnold Schoenberg, and if his own style remained conservative it was through choice and not ignorance.<br>
<br>A violin concerto composed for Sybil Eaton and conducted by Vaughan Williams was not well received (London, 1928) and had no further performances until the late 1990s. For a time Finzi kept to the songs which made his name, always publishing them in sets, such as <span class="italic">A Young Man's Exhortation</span> (1933). He worked slowly, with much revision, and would put a piece aside for years before completing it (dates given here are of first performance). Part of his <span class="italic">Grand Fantasia and Toccata</span> for piano and orchestra was drafted in the 1920s, but the toccata was not finished until 1953.<br>
<br>In 1928 Finzi had to spend three months in Midhurst Sanatorium with suspected tuberculosis, which turned out to be pleurisy. From 1930 to 1933 he taught for one day a week at the Royal Academy of Music. In 1931 he met the beautiful and talented Joy Black [<a name="cosubject_60527"></a><span class="headword">Joyce Amy <span class="st"> [Joy]</span> Finzi</span>  (1907&#150;1991)], <span class="occ">artist and poet</span>. She was born on 3 March 1907 in Hampstead, London, the elder daughter of Ernest Harry Black (<i>d</i>. 1926), East India merchant, and his wife, Amy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whitehorn (<i>d</i>. 1932); she grew up in Eastbourne, and attended Moira House School there. After some doubts about whether matrimony would hinder his composition, Finzi proposed, and they married on 16 September 1933; Ralph and Adeline Vaughan Williams were witnesses. After their marriage the Finzis lived in Hampstead, then in 1935 moved to Aldbourne in Wiltshire. Christopher was born in 1934 and Nigel in 1936, and with nannies and servants the Finzis lived an agreeable life, supported by Joy's money and unobtrusive practicality. Finzi was however always conscious of those less fortunate. As Bairstow's pupil he had been overwhelmed by Ivor Gurney's setting of John Fletcher's &#145;Sleep&#146;, and began to repay his debt to this poet and composer, now in an asylum. He enlisted Edmund Blunden's help, and was responsible for the Gurney number of <span class="italic">Music and Letters</span> (1938) and for the publication of <span class="italic">Poems by Ivor Gurney</span> (1954). With Ferguson's collaboration, he edited four volumes of Gurney's songs. He also championed Parry, gathering his autographs safely into the Bodleian Library.<br>
<br>In the late 1930s the Finzis built a house at Ashmansworth on a 16 acre site on the Hampshire downs near Newbury. They moved in just before war was declared. An agnostic who never admitted his Jewish descent, Finzi was by nature a pacifist, and found himself tortured by events in Europe. Their beautiful new home became filled with refugees, and from 1941 to 1945 Finzi worked in London in the Ministry of War Transport. His real war work lay in founding (1940) and conducting the mainly amateur Newbury String Players, who gave concerts in chilly village churches and halls, so bringing live music to audiences starved by wartime restrictions. The little orchestra became Finzi's &#145;instrument&#146;, for he was never a good executant; as time passed he expanded its repertory with contemporary works and eighteenth-century revivals.<br>
<br>The outbreak of war meant the cancellation of Finzi's first major premi&egrave;re, of the cantata for high voice and strings <span class="italic">Dies natalis</span> at the Three Choirs Festival. This was given in London in 1940, and at the Three Choirs in 1946. From then on Finzi became a Three Choirs composer. <span class="italic">Dies natalis</span> formed one strand in his character, for the words he selected from Traherne's <span class="italic">Centuries</span> celebrate the rapturous beauty of the world as seen by a new-born child. Among Finzi's many strong convictions were those on bringing up children; he sent his sons to the progressive school Bedales.<br>
<br>Another strand in Finzi's thinking was the belief that no words were too famous or too self-contained for a composer to use. Critics had chided him in 1936 for his two Milton sonnets. He foresaw further trouble for his setting of Wordsworth's great <span class="italic">Intimations of Immortality</span>, but insisted on the composer's right to identify with what moved him. At the first performance (Gloucester, 1950) the climate of opinion was against his post-Brahmsian work, which was heard by some as largely derived from Elgar, Vaughan Williams, and Walton. As time passes, influences recede, and Finzi's voice sounds clear. <span class="italic">Intimations</span> has its structural flaws, but these are far outweighed by stretches of vision and beauty. At the centenary performance of 2001 the Barbican Hall in London was packed, and the silence before the applause began was a tribute to the melancholy grandeur of Wordsworth&#150;Finzi. Finzi was a wide reader and a prolific, sometimes provocative, letter writer, and eventually gathered his thoughts into the three Crees lectures, &#145;The composer's use of words&#146;, given at the Royal College of Music in 1955.<br>
<br>Life at Ashmansworth after the war could have been self-indulgent, had it not been for Finzi's urgent sense of duty. Gerald's and Joy's shared enthusiasms attracted artists and musicians, young performers and composers, and researchers. They delighted in the home-grown vegetarian food, in Gerald's large library, and in his apple orchards, in which he lovingly rescued almost forgotten varieties, as in his study he rescued minor eighteenth-century worthies such as Charles Avison and William Felton. Impatient with uncreative people, Gerald was devoted to cherishing young and emerging talent. Joy's hospitality became legendary. Her eye for shape and texture had given the house its atmosphere; she also (when the demanding Gerald gave her time) began the remarkable series of portrait drawings, incidentally revealing how distinguished was her circle of friends, eventually published as <span class="italic">In That Place</span> (1987). By then she had also published two volumes of poetry, <span class="italic">A Point of Departure</span> (1967) and <span class="italic">Twelve Months of the Year</span> (1981).<br>
<br>During the war Finzi's popular Shakespeare songs, <span class="italic">Let us Garlands Bring</span> (1942), and clarinet and piano bagatelles (1943) reached performance. For St Matthew's, Northampton, he composed his brooding, devotional anthem to Richard Crashaw's words <span class="italic">Lo, the Full, Final Sacrifice</span> (1946). Then collaboration with a living poet, Blunden, produced the ceremonial ode <span class="italic">For St Cecilia</span> (1947) and also the detailed, amicable letters showing how poet and composer worked together. All the time Finzi was composing songs: <span class="italic">Earth and Air and Rain</span> (published in 1936) and <span class="italic">Before and After Summer</span> (1949), both to Hardy's poems. His affinity with Hardy shows the more sombre, fatalistic side of his character, and the songs themselves prove that within his limited idiom he was capable of a wide range, from an apparently simple ditty to the tremendous <span class="italic">Channel Firing</span> (1940). His one-note-to-a-syllable word-setting, his flexible distinctive melodic line, brilliantly convey&#151;even clarify&#151;the sense of Hardy's sometimes packed, crusty verses. Led always by the words, Finzi devised unconventional but convincing structures that enhance the emotional power of each poem. A new venture was his composing incidental music for a broadcast of <span class="italic">Love's Labour's Lost</span> (1946), which he later expanded for a suite (1955).<br>
<br>In 1951 Finzi was diagnosed as suffering from leukaemia (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), and was given at most ten years to live. Keeping the verdict within his family, he seemed to increase his workload; he combined radiotherapy treatment in Oxford with research at the Bodleian. By now he was in demand as a lecturer, an external examiner for St Andrews University, an adjudicator, and a county adviser&#151;this, as well as his composition, running the Newbury String Players, and finding repertory for them. Fruit of his research came with volume 13 in the series <span class="roman">Musica Britannica</span>, consisting of Boyce overtures. His editions of unpublished and neglected works by John Stanley, William Boyce, Richard Mudge, John Garth, Capel Bond, and Charles Wesley were an important part of his post-war output.<br>
<br>From the sunny days of 1949 came the concerto for clarinet and strings. The more turbulent cello concerto (1955) dates from Finzi's final years, and something of their pressure and desperation inform it. It sadly suggests the possibility of further expansion, had he lived longer. For <span class="italic">In terra pax</span> (1954) he enclosed St Luke's message &#145;Fear not&#146; within Robert Bridges' poem &#145;Noel&#146;, and composed a luminous Christmas scene which perfectly conveys his longing for peace and his acceptance of the artist's solitude. It had been inspired in 1925 when he stood at night on Chosen Hill near Gloucester listening to church bells. At the 1956 Three Choirs Festival the Finzis took the Vaughan Williamses back to Chosen; there Finzi developed shingles which led to his death in the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, on 27 September 1956.<br>
<br>Finzi was cremated privately on 2 October 1956; then there was a memorial concert in London in 1957, when both his sons played in the orchestra. His ashes were scattered on May Hill, Gloucestershire, in 1973. Finzi left enough unpublished songs for Joy and Howard Ferguson to make into four sets, two of Hardy, two of mixed poets. They gave his autographs to the Bodleian. Finzi had gathered a fine private collection of eighteenth-century English music, which was bought in 1965 by Cedric Thorpe Davie, Finzi's friend and fellow enthusiast, on behalf of St Andrews University. In 1974 Joy gave her husband's library of English literature to Reading University, where it is housed in the Finzi book room, with furniture and pictures from his study  (P. Dingley, <span class="italic">The Finzi Book Room</span>, 1981). In 1969 this indomitable woman also formed a trust from his royalties to further his varied interests. She remained actively involved in its affairs until her death on 14 June 1991 at Church Farm, the house she and Gerald had built at Ashmansworth; she was survived by their two sons. In his quiet determined way Finzi composed a distinguished body of lyrical but intense music and by his probity and zest influenced the many people who think of him with gratitude.<br>
