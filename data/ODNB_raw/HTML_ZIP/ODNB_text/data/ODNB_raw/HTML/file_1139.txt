<span class="headword">Baker, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1771?&#150;1845), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, of an old Kentish family, was a descendant, direct or collateral, of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1125/', "Vice-Admiral John Baker (1660&#150;1716)")</script>. He entered the navy in August 1781 on the storeship <i>Dromedary</i> and was on her books until 1785. He was then three years in the East India Company service, but in 1788 he returned to the navy. After serving on the home, Halifax, and East India stations, he was promoted lieutenant on 13 October 1792. In 1793 he commanded the cutter <i>Lion</i>, in 1794 the lugger <i>Valiant</i>, and on 24 November 1795 he was promoted commander for good service in carrying dispatches to the West Indies. In 1796&#150;7 he commanded the sloop <i>Fairy</i> in the North Sea, and on 13 June 1797 he reached captain's rank, commanding the <i>Princess Royal</i>.<br>
<br>In January 1799 Baker was appointed to the 28-gun frigate <i>Nemesis</i> in which, on 25 July 1800, when in command of a small squadron off Ostend, he met a number of Danish merchant vessels under convoy of the frigate <i>Freya</i>. Neutral powers argued that the convoy of a ship of war was a guarantee that none of the vessels carried contraband, and that they were therefore exempt from search. This the British government had never admitted, and in accordance with his instructions Baker insisted on searching the Danish ships. The <i>Freya</i> resisted but was quickly overpowered, and together with her convoy was brought into the Downs. After some negotiations the affair seemed to be amicably arranged, and the <i>Freya</i> and her convoy were restored; but the tsar of Russia made it a pretext for renewing the &#145;armed neutrality&#146;, which he induced Denmark to join. This led to the dispatch of the fleet under Sir Hyde Parker, and the battle of Copenhagen. Baker's conduct was approved by the Admiralty, and in January 1801 he was appointed to the 36-gun frigate <i>Phoebe</i>, which he commanded on the Irish station until the peace of Amiens in October 1801.<br>
<br>On the renewal of the war in 1803 Baker commissioned the <i>Phoenix</i> (42 guns), attached to the Channel Fleet under William Cornwallis off Ushant and in the Bay of Biscay. On 10 August 1805, being then to the north-west of Cape Finisterre, he fell in with and, after a brilliant and well-fought action of rather more than three hours' duration, captured the French 46-gun frigate <i>Didon</i>. The <i>Didon</i> had been sent off from Ferrol on the 6th with important dispatches from Villeneuve to Admiral Allemand, who was on his way to join him with five sail of the line. In consequence of this capture, Allemand never joined Villeneuve, and his ships had no further part in the campaign. On 14 August the <i>Phoenix</i> with her prize joined the British 74-gun <i>Dragon</i>, and the next day the three ships were sighted by Villeneuve, who took for granted that they were a part of the British fleet under Cornwallis looking for him. Not caring to risk an encounter, he turned south to Cadiz, and the fate that befell him off Cape Trafalgar. Baker in the mean-time took his prize to Plymouth and, returning to his former station, on 2 November sighted the French squadron of four ships of the line under Dumanoir, escaping from Trafalgar. Knowing that Sir Richard John Strachan was off Ferrol, he at once sailed thither, and the same night joined Strachan, to whom he gave the news which directly led to the capture of the four French ships on 4 November, the <i>Phoenix</i> with the other frigates having an important part in the action. In the space of four months Baker had the opportunity, and ability, to exercise a major influence on the naval campaign of 1805. His performance was exemplary.<br>
<br>A fortnight later Baker was appointed to the <i>Didon</i> from which, in May 1806, he was moved to the <i>Tribune</i>, which he commanded for the next two years in the Bay of Biscay with distinguished success. In May 1808 he joined the <i>Vanguard</i> as flag-captain to Rear-Admiral Thomas Bertie in the Baltic. On leaving her in 1811, he spent some time in Sweden, where he married the daughter of Count Routh, a Swedish noble; they had several children. From 1812 to 1815 he commanded the 74-gun <i>Cumberland</i> in the West Indies, in the North Sea, and in charge of a convoy of East Indiamen to the Cape. In 1814 the prince of Orange conferred on him the order of William of the Netherlands, and on 4 June 1815 he was made a CB. He was appointed colonel of marines on 12 August 1819, was promoted rear-admiral on 19 July 1821, and was commander-in-chief on the coast of South America from 1829 to 1833. He was nominated KCB on 8 January 1831, became vice-admiral on 10 January 1837, and was awarded a good-service pension of &pound;300 a year on 19 February 1842. He died at his residence, The Shrubbery, Walmer, Kent, on 26 February 1845. His second son, Horace Mann Baker, died a lieutenant, RN, in 1848.<br>
