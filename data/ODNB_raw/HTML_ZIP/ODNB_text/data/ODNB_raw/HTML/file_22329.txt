<span class="headword">Pitt,  Ann</span>  (<em>c.</em>1720&#150;1799), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born in London. Her career on the London stage spanned over fifty years, most of it spent playing comic roles and spinsters with the company at Covent Garden. Her father, John Pitt, was a fishmonger and a warden of old London Bridge, and her mother was probably called Elizabeth; they were possibly but not certainly the John Pitts and Elizabeth Baird who married at St Katharine by the Tower on 21 February 1716. While there are no church documents which refer to Ann Pitt's birth or baptism, there is a record of her brother Cecil's being baptized in the church of St Magnus the Martyr in London. In his autobiography Thomas Dibdin refers to this Cecil Pitt, who boasted that he had &#145;never paid to see a play in his life&#146;  (Dibdin, 1.24) and who became a wealthy dry-goods merchant in London. Ann Pitt also had two stepbrothers, James and John Pitt.<br>
<br>Ann Pitt's virtuosity lay in comedy and song; once established on the London stage, she was hardly ever cast in tragedy. She first appears in the playbills of Drury Lane in 1745, where, on 30 March of that year, she enacted the part of the Nurse in Owen Swiny's <span class="italic">The Quacks, or, Love's the Physician</span>. She acted in Dublin's Smock Alley Theatre and also in Richmond, Surrey (playing in <span class="italic">The Beggars' Opera</span>), in 1747&#150;8. In 1748 she returned to London and Drury Lane, where she played the Nurse in John Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Relapse</span>, Lady Loverule in <span class="italic">The Devil to Pay</span>, by Charles Coffey, and Dame Pliant in Jonson's <span class="italic">The Alchemist</span> (opposite Garrick's Abel Drugger). She joined the acting company at Covent Garden in 1752 and appeared as Jacinta in Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The False Friend</span> on 28 January. Among her famous roles, during the thirty-nine winters she spent at Covent Garden, were Mistress Quickly in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>, Deborah Woodcock in <span class="italic">Love in a Village</span>, by Isaac Bickerstaff, Widow Loveit in Samuel Foote's <span class="italic">The Commissary</span>, Dorcas in Frances Brooke's <span class="italic">Rosina</span>, and the Nurse in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>. In Hugh Kelly's <span class="italic">Thespis</span> her talents are commemorated in verse:<blockquote>
<div>PITT in those fond, intolerable wives,<br>
</div>
<div>Who quite through love embitter all our lives,<br>
</div>
<div>With too much softness poison every breath,<br>
</div>
<div>Through care still murder, and caress to death;<br>
</div>
<div>There PITT, O matchless SYCAMORE! has shined<br>
</div>
<div>Severely soft, and turbulently kind.<br>
</div> (Kelly, 392&#150;3)</blockquote>Anthony Pasquin offered a more flippant view of the actress's career, writing in 1786:<blockquote>
<div>Her Quickly, her Dorcas, old spinsters, and nurse<br>
</div>
<div>Are parts, when she dies, should be laid in her hearse.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">DNB</span>)</blockquote>Thomas Dibdin quotes an obituarist from a London morning paper, who wrote in 1799 that Ann Pitt's acting &#145;bore the stamp of genuine merit and originality&#146;  (Dibdin, 1.265).<br>
<br>Ann Pitt was the mother of at least two illegitimate children. When the prompter at Drury Lane, Richard Cross, wrote in his diary, &#145;Miss Pitt went to play in <span class="roman">Beg: Opera</span> for Mr Usher at Richmond &amp; was deliver'd of a fine Girl&#151;N.B.: She was a Virgin&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 12.14), he was likely referring to the birth of <a href="#cosubject_22329">Harriet Pitt [<i>see below</i>]</a>. There is little evidence to explain who the father of the infant was; the record of her baptism names a Henry Pitt, but he was in all likelihood fictitious. Ann Pitt gave birth to a second illegitimate daughter, Mary Ann, baptized on 22 October 1759 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, whose father was the scene-painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23535/', "John Inigo Richards (1730/31?&#150;1810)")</script>. Richards married Elizabeth Wignell on 28 September 1769 in Orpington, Kent, but he acknowledged in his will his &#145;dear daughter Mary Ann Ritchards by Mrs Ann Pitt deceased&#146;  (ibid.), and left her, among other items, a snuff-box with a picture of Ann Pitt in the lid. In <span class="italic">The Secret History of the Green Rooms</span> (1790) J. Haslewood writes uncharitably of Ann Pitt that &#145;no theatric dame has given greater scope to her passions, or has been more frequently concerned in amours&#146;  (Haslewood, 99).<br>
<br>Ann Pitt's last appearance on the Covent Garden stage probably occurred on 2 June 1792, when she played the Spanish Lady in Frederic Pilon's <span class="italic">Barataria</span>. Thomas Dibdin also remembers her, about 1792, singing &#145;I tremble at seventy-two&#146; in Garrick's <span class="italic">Cymon</span> at Covent Garden. She retired to the household of her daughter Harriet in Islington, London. Ann Pitt died of natural causes in London on 18 December 1799 and was buried in the family plot of Charles Isaac Mungo Dibdin at St James's Chapel in Pentonville.<br>
<br>An undated oil portrait, sometimes attributed to Hogarth, of Ann Pitt is exhibited in the Garrick Club (number 229), and Walker's engraved portrait of her, in the part of Lady Wishfort, was published in Lowndes's <span class="italic">New English Theatre</span> in 1776. While the portrait in oils emphasizes her youthful slenderness, the Walker engraving reveals her in her mid-fifties to have been an imposing, corpulent figure.<br>
<br>Ann Pitt's daughter <a name="cosubject_22329"></a><span class="headword">Harriet Pitt</span>  (1748?&#150;1814), <span class="occ">actress and dancer</span>, played secondary roles at Drury Lane and Covent Garden. She accompanied her mother on several theatrical expeditions to the provinces and began acting at an early age. On 25 August 1758, at Bristol's Jacob's Wells Theatre, she spoke an epilogue &#145;in the Character of one of the boys of the School at St. Augustine's-Back&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 12.17). She became a dancer at Covent Garden in 1762 and appeared as one of the three graces in <span class="italic">The Arcadian Nuptials</span> on 20 January 1764. Her eldest child was the future musician George Cecil Pitt (<i>bap</i>. 1767, <i>d</i>. 1820), whose father was George Anderson, not, as previously thought, the singer and theatre manager George Mattocks. She also bore two illegitimate sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7586/', "Charles Isaac Mungo Dibdin")</script> in 1768 and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7589/', "Thomas John Dibdin")</script> in 1771, and an illegitimate daughter, Harriet (<i>b</i>. 1770), known as Harriet Pitt, whose father was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7585/', "Charles Dibdin the elder (bap. 1745, d. 1814)")</script>. Dibdin abandoned Pitt when their children were very young, and the family relied on the support of David Garrick, godfather to Thomas. After a brief respite from the stage, Harriet Pitt acted at Drury Lane in 1775 and between 1778 and 1780, in the latter seasons using the name Mrs Davenett. She returned to the company at Covent Garden in the early 1780s, still as Mrs Davenett, and appeared regularly there until her retirement in 1793. Having suffered from a debilitating nervous condition, Harriet Pitt died on 10 December 1814 and was buried beside her mother.<br>
