<span class="headword">Webbe,  Edward</span>  (<em>b. </em>1553/4), <span class="occ">soldier and adventurer</span>, son of Richard Webbe, &#145;master gunner of England&#146;  (Webbe, <span class="italic">Travailes</span>, 17), was born at St Katharine by the Tower, London. Nothing is known of his mother. &#145;A simple man voide of learning&#146;  (ibid., 29), at the age of twelve Webbe was placed by his father in the service of Captain Anthony Jenkinson, ambassador to Russia, who sailed from England on his third voyage to that region on 4 May 1566. As Jenkinson's personal attendant, Webbe served in and about Moscow, eventually returning with him to England in 1568.<br>
<br>In 1570 Webbe sailed in the <i>Hart</i>, under Captain William Borough, for Narva, in the Gulf of Finland and was in Moscow on 24 May 1571, when it was burnt by the Crimean Tartars. Though he escaped, he was subsequently captured by the Tartars and enslaved. With seven other Englishmen Webbe was transported to Caffa in the Crimea. According to his <span class="italic">Rare and most wonderful thinges which Edward Webbe an Englishman borne, hath seene and passed in his troublesome travailes</span>, he was held there for five years before being ransomed for the sum of 300 crowns. However, this seems to have been something of an exaggeration, for he also claims to have been at Tunis in October 1572, when it was taken from the Turks. He was then serving under Don John of Austria, and it is while in the forces of the Christian commander that he is first described as being of the rank of master gunner.<br>
<br>Some months later Webbe, on board the <i>Henry</i>, was captured by the Turks off the coast of Leghorn. Transported to Constantinople, Webbe became a galley slave, in which capacity he says he served for six years. Eventually, &#145;constrained for want of victualles&#146;  (Webbe, <span class="italic">Travailes</span>, 20), he fought for the Turks as a gunner and accompanied the Turkish army on their campaign to Persia. Though the balance of Webbe's travels during his period as a slave cannot be independently confirmed, he states that he was in Calabria, Damascus, Cairo, Goa, Bethlehem, Jerusalem, and in a place which he identifies as &#145;the land of Prester John&#146;  (ibid., 24). According to Webbe, this was a place located within 18&deg; (1080 miles) of the equator. Given the rest of his itinerary, it is not likely that this was Ethiopia, the site more usually associated with this semi-legendary potentate in the sixteenth century. Finally, though, Webbe returned to Constantinople, where in 1588 he was one of twenty captives ransomed through the intercession of William Harborne, the English ambassador.<br>
<br>On his way back to England, Webbe was arrested and tried as a heretic through the machinations of an unidentified English friar resident in Padua. But, he records, the charge was not substantiated and he was freed. For reasons which are unclear, Webbe turned south from Padua to Rome, where he fell foul of the English cardinal William Allen. Though he was examined many times and abused by the English college of the city, Webbe records that the pope intervened directly and set him at liberty.<br>
<br>Continuing to Naples, Webbe was denounced as an English spy by a Genoese. Confined to a dark dungeon, enduring periodic torture for twenty-five days, he refused to implicate himself. As a result, he languished in gaol for another seven months before the viceroy, upon instruction from the king of Spain, recommended that Webbe be made a gunner and given an allowance of 35 crowns a month. A short time after this, he was able to escape in the <i>Grace</i> with the collusion of its captain, Nicholas Nottingham. However, while Webbe notes that in May 1589 he set foot in England for the first time in thirteen years, this again may be something of an exaggeration, for on 8 April 1587 one Mr Webbe was consulted by John Popham, the attorney-general, about the market for English cloth in Muscovy and the possibility of expanding English trade in that region.<br>
<br>In November 1589 Webbe journeyed to France and was made chief master gunner by Henri IV, in whose service he fought at the battle of Ivry on 14 March 1590. However, Webbe records that some French gunners, jealous of his skill, tried to poison him. He was pulled back from the brink of death only by the intervention of the king's physician, who cured him with a potion made from unicorn's horn. After his return to England a short time later, he took lodgings at Blackwall, where on 19 May 1590 he completed his account of his travails. On 14 January 1592 Webbe was made a cannonier for life, receiving a fee of 10<i>s</i>. per diem. Nothing further is known of his life.<br>
