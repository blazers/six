<span class="headword">Lantfred</span>  (<em>fl. </em>974&#150;984), <span class="occ">monk and author</span>, belonged to the Benedictine community at the Old Minster, Winchester, and wrote the earliest account of the miracles that took place following the translation of the relics of Bishop Swithun there on 15 July 971. Very little is known of Lantfred's career. A contemporary Winchester author, &AElig;lfric, describes him as &#145;the foreigner&#146; (<i>se ofers&aelig;wisca</i>); and the spelling of his name as he gives it in his account of St Swithun, the <span class="italic">Translatio et miracula Sancti Swithuni</span> (&#145;Translation and miracles of St Swithun&#146;), implies an origin in Francia, probably West Francia (a German spelling of the same name would be Lantfrid). A Frankish origin for Lantfred is confirmed by the occurrence of various Latinized Old French words in his <span class="italic">Translatio</span>, as well as by a letter (datable to 974&#150;84) addressed to Archbishop Dunstan by an author who signs himself as &#145;.L.&#146;; on stylistic grounds, the letter is unambiguously the work of the author of the <span class="italic">Translatio</span>. In this letter Lantfred reports to Dunstan that he has returned to Fleury, but, as a result of a fire there, has need of various books which he left in England in the possession of Osgar, a former Winchester monk who later became abbot of Abingdon. That Lantfred came to Winchester from Fleury at the invitation of Bishop &AElig;thelwold (<i>d</i>. 984) is implied by the fact that &AElig;thelwold, in the preface to his <span class="italic">Regularis concordia</span>, records his gratitude for advice on monastic customs given to him by monks from continental houses including Fleury&#151;a reference, perhaps, to advice given by Lantfred.<br>
<br>Lantfred's <span class="italic">Translatio et miracula Sancti Swithuni</span> is one of the most polished pieces of Latin prose composed in England between the time of Aldhelm (<i>d</i>. 709/10) and the Norman conquest. From references in the text it is evident that it was composed within a few years of the translation of St Swithun in 971; Lantfred describes himself as an eyewitness for many of the miracles. The persuasive nature of Lantfred's work helped to establish the cult of St Swithun, a fact reflected in the number of manuscripts and later redactions of the work. The <span class="italic">Translatio</span> is not only a valuable account of the origin and early development of an Anglo-Saxon saint's cult, but a precious (and firsthand) witness to various aspects of Anglo-Saxon life, including pilgrimage, travel, slavery, medicine, law enforcement, capital punishment, and trial by ordeal. It is composed in extremely flamboyant Latin prose, being the earliest attested Anglo-Latin example of rhyming prose, and bristles with learned words of various kinds, including archaisms and Graecisms, mostly derived from the Greek <span class="roman">New Testament</span> (though, to judge from errors in declension, it is most unlikely that Lantfred himself knew any Greek). Lantfred's Latin prose is also characterized by the use of poeticisms, and of Virgilian diction in particular. Although (with the exception of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>) the number of works quoted in the <span class="italic">Translatio</span> is limited, Lantfred was clearly a scholar of considerable learning.<br>
<br>A manuscript now in Cambridge  (CUL, Kk.5.34), which was written at Winchester in the late tenth century, contains three Latin poems under the rubric &#145;Versus .L. de quodam superbo&#146;, and there is reason to think that the &#145;.L.&#146; in question is Lantfred. The first two poems are conceived as high-spirited (and frequently vitriolic) master&#150;student debate poems; the third is a sophisticated meditation of the problems of predestination and free will, which has as its nuclear image Boethius's metaphor of God observing the human race from a watch-tower. The poems share many features of diction with Lantfred's <span class="italic">Translatio</span>, and reveal that he was an accomplished poet as well as a master of Latin prose.<br>
