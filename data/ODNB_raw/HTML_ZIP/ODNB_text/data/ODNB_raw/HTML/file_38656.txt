<span class="headword">Hilton,  Harold Horsfall</span>  (1869&#150;1942), <span class="occ">golfer and journalist</span>, was born on 14 January 1869 at West Kirby, Cheshire, the son of Benjamin Holden Hilton, manager of the Crown Assurance Company, and his wife, Eliza Eleanor Pugh. As a child Harold was good at most sports but rapidly excelled at golf. Educated at Norfolk county school, Elmham, he did not go on to university and was for a while employed by his father. He concentrated, though, on his golf, and had the great good fortune to learn the game on one of the finest and most demanding courses in the world, the links of the Royal Liverpool Golf Club, Hoylake. At that time the Royal Liverpool club could have challenged any national side anywhere with reasonable confidence, with the great John Ball and any number of distinguished champions among the members. But Hilton himself probably owed most to Willie More, a former Hoylake member, subsequently a professional, who taught him the value of a serious, scientific approach to both the golf swing and the game as a whole.<br>
<br>Hilton remained a top amateur golfer for almost a quarter of a century, from the early 1890s to the First World War. Only three amateurs have won the open championship and Hilton did it twice&#151;in 1892 at Muirfield, the first championship to be played over seventy-two holes, and five years later on his home links at Hoylake. He lost three amateur championship finals in the 1890s, but at last carried off the title at Royal St George's in 1900, when he convincingly beat James Robb by eight and seven. He repeated this feat the following year, this time by defeating John Low by the much narrower margin of one hole. Hilton also won the Irish open amateur championship in three consecutive years from 1900, as well as the Irish open in the first two of those years. In 1911, perhaps his greatest year, Hilton's putt to tie for the open championship shaved the hole, but he went on to complete what was then a unique double of victories in the amateur championship and in the United States amateur championship. At Prestwick, Hilton defeated E. A. Lassen comfortably, four and three, but in the American championship at Apawasis, north of New York, he defeated his opponent Fred Herreshoff only at the thirty-seventh hole, having been at one time six up with fifteen to play. Hilton remains the only British golfer ever to win the United States amateur championship. He won his fourth and final amateur championship in 1913 at St Andrews.<br>
<br>Only 5 feet 7 inches, Hilton used an unusually short-shafted putter to compensate for his height, but he was well built, with an energetic swing that often caused him to lose the cap that he habitually wore. His long game, with fairway woods and punched irons, was the strongest feature of his game, but he was a shotmaker with most clubs. Not only could he hit the ball a long way in a straight line but he could also fade and draw the ball when necessary, an unusual skill for an amateur player. Hilton was an inveterate smoker, who could consume fifty cigarettes during a round of golf.<br>
<br>A prolific writer on outdoor sports, particularly on golf but also extensively on cricket and tennis, Hilton became in 1911 the first editor of <span class="italic">Golf Monthly</span>, a post he held until 1914. He also edited <span class="italic">Golf Illustrated</span> after the death of Garden Smith in 1913. As well as <span class="italic">My Golfing Reminiscences</span> (published in 1907, when his fortunes as a player were at a low ebb), he edited with Garden Smith <span class="italic">The Royal and Ancient Game of Golf</span> (1912) and contributed instructional and historical chapters to a number of golfing books, including Horace Hutchinson's <span class="italic">The Book of Golf and Golfers</span> (1899) and George Beldam's <span class="italic">Great Golfers: their Methods at a Glance</span> (1904). He played a significant role in establishing the Professional Golfers' Association when a conversation with J. H. Taylor at a sporting function early in 1901 prompted a leading article in <span class="italic">Golf Illustrated</span> on &#145;The professional's lot&#146; that appealed for better treatment of their professional by golf clubs. The ensuing correspondence signalled to Taylor that his fellow professionals wanted him to take the lead in building an organization to protect their interests. Hilton used the journals to air his views on golfing issues, and, in the opinion of Bernard Darwin, was the most interesting and stimulating talker of golfing &#145;shop&#146; that ever lived, with a truly encyclopaedic knowledge of the game. In 1902 Hilton joined the debate on the new rubber-cored Haskell ball versus the traditional one made from gutta-percha, suggesting that only the shorter drivers would gain much yardage from the Haskell, and that putting was more difficult because it would not run uniformly. The average club golfer did not care: the Haskell ball may have been twice as expensive as the &#145;gutty&#146;; they may have been harder to control on the greens; but, as Hilton put it in the <span class="italic">Golf Illustrated</span> on 4 July 1902, &#145;no power on earth, except perhaps the police, will deter men from using a ball that will add to the length of their drive&#146;. In 1904 a discussion arose about whether the open championship should include an element of match play: Hilton noted tellingly that those who wished to change the format of the championship were those who had never won it.<br>
<br>Hilton represented the gentlemen in a match against the players in 1894, an event which was dominated by the professionals and despite his own triumphs in the open championship, he believed that professionals would generally be better golfers than the leading amateurs. Writing in 1909, Hilton considered that economic dependence upon success on the links meant that the professional had constantly &#145;to think everything out, particularly in relation to his own game. He knows his own game, its strengths and its weaknesses, and had invariably some antidote for his shortcomings&#146;. Essentially the professional puts in more practice than the amateur, who is &#145;content to obtain as much amusement and pleasure as he can out of the game and leave the hard labour alone&#146;  (Lewis, 37). This was not the case with Hilton himself, whose constant practice and experimentation enabled him to make shots with any club. His weakness was an occasional unwillingness to play the simple stroke, and instead to invent a shot for the challenge of the situation. An extrovert, Hilton loved playing before large crowds. In October 1910 he played a seventy-two hole match, arranged by the <span class="italic">Ladies' Field</span>, against the nineteen-year-old Cecil Leitch, subsequently a ladies' champion, whose victory (two and one) against her older, male opponent was much publicized in the context of the campaign for women's suffrage.<br>
<br>Hilton was for a time secretary of the West Lancashire and the Ashford Manor golf clubs. His later years were not easy, and he died on 5 May 1942 at his home, Bethlehem Westcote, near Kingham, Stow on the Wold, Gloucestershire, of cardiac failure and paralysis agitans, survived by his widow, Frances Cooper Hilton.<br>
