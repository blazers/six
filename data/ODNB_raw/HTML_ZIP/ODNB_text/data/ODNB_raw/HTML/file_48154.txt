<span class="headword">Rootes, Sir  Reginald Claud</span>  (1896&#150;1977), <span class="occ">motor vehicle manufacturer</span>, was born in Goudhurst, Kent, on 20 October 1896, the younger son of William Rootes (1869&#150;1955), a cycle and motor engineer, and his wife, Jane Catt. He was educated at Cranbrook School, where, unlike his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35825/', "William Edward Rootes")</script>, he excelled in academic studies and sports. After passing the intermediate civil service examination he joined the Admiralty in early 1915. In 1919 he was persuaded to leave the civil service to join his brother as joint managing director of Rootes Ltd, a motor distributor in Maidstone. For nearly fifty years he was a very active partner in the direction and management of the company.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1920s as the motor distribution business was expanding, Rootes's main activity was in administering the company, for which his earlier experience in accounting was a valuable asset. The head office was moved to Long Acre, London, and then to the new Devonshire House in Piccadilly in 1926. The first-floor offices of the Rootes brothers, later known as the &#145;Green Belt&#146; from the sage colour of the Wilton carpet, became the centre of a growing business empire. In 1929, with the backing of the Prudential Assurance Company, Rootes bought out the Humber group of companies, makers of Humber and Hillman cars and Commer trucks.<br>
<br>From this time Rootes devoted much of his effort to the manufacturing arm of what became the Rootes Group. He made several visits to the United States, gleaning ideas of modern production methods at Ford and Chrysler in Detroit and purchasing machine tools and equipment for the British factories. By the late 1930s he had largely achieved the goal of integration by developing common components, creating a more identifiable &#145;house style&#146; of vehicles and linking dispersed factories more closely. The acquisition of the Sunbeam group in 1935 and British Light Steel Pressings in Acton, Middlesex, in 1937 extended the range of vehicles and added some body-making capability. Under Rootes's management the output of the Rootes Group was increased from 9000 vehicles in 1929&#150;30 to 20,000 in 1933&#150;4 and 41,000 in 1937&#150;9. By the late 1930s the company was clearly one of the &#145;big six&#146; British vehicle manufacturers, with about 12 per cent of national production.<br>
<br>As part of the rearmament programme Rootes was influential in the development of &#145;shadow&#146; factories for airframe and aero-engine production. Speke, Liverpool, was selected as the site for a large bomber assembly plant in 1937 and new engine factories were built on the outskirts of Coventry. When William Rootes was seconded to work with the Ministry of Supply early in the Second World War, Reginald Rootes took over full direction of the firm. The Rootes contribution to the war effort was substantial&#151;50,000 aero-engines, 4447 bombers, and tens of thousands of military vehicles. Rootes's war work earned him a knighthood in 1946.<br>
<br>The post-war expansion of the company required a great deal of attention to the details of new designs of cars and trucks, retooling of factories, and the organization of supply systems to produce and then distribute finished vehicles. Production of cars and trucks was increased from 42,000 in 1946&#150;7 to 90,000 in 1949&#150;50. Rootes was very active in the export drive, especially in North America where a network of dealers supported by parts depots was established. Although William Rootes was the more visible world traveller, promoting Rootes in particular and British exports more generally, Reginald Rootes also made extended visits on behalf of the company. In early 1953 he made a 40,000 mile trip visiting sales and assembly organizations. The Melbourne assembly plant was an important stop on the Australian part of the journey. Also in 1953 an agreement with Isuzu Motors was significant for the export of British components and launching the Japanese firm as an independent vehicle manufacturer a decade later. During the 1950s Rootes continued to expand, acquiring other manufacturers such as Tilling Stevens in 1950, and Singer Motors in 1955. Production in 1960 reached 192,000 vehicles.<br>
<br>The market success of the BMC Mini car launched in 1959 was a factor in the decision of Rootes to manufacture a small car, later named the Imp. Unlike all previous cars designed and manufactured by the company, the Imp had a rear engine and the engine block was made from aluminium in place of the standard form of cast iron. Government policy of decentralizing the motor industry to areas of high unemployment forced Rootes to build a new factory in Scotland. The assembly plant, with an annual capacity of 150,000 cars, never fulfilled the expectations. Sales of the Imp peaked at 50,000 in 1964, the year after opening, and over the next few years rarely exceeded one fifth of the designed capacity of the plant.<br>
<br>A more competitive world environment, the cost of a prolonged strike in 1961, and the expenses of the new car resulted in a collapse of the firm's profitability and losses were made in 1962 and 1963. Rootes was compelled to seek new sources of capital. In June 1964 it was announced that Chrysler, then in a phase of world expansion, was taking a &pound;12.3 million interest in Rootes. At this time Chrysler acquired 30 per cent of the ordinary (voting) shares and 50 per cent of the non-voting shares. Following the death of his brother later in the year, Reginald Rootes continued as a member of the board until he retired from Rootes Motors at the age of seventy. The transfer of control from the family to Chrysler took place in 1967, when Chrysler acquired additional shares and the new corporate symbol of the &#145;Pentastar&#146; appeared on the vehicles and properties of the company. In 1970 Chrysler United Kingdom Ltd moved out of Devonshire House to a new office block in Knightsbridge.<br>
<br>Rootes played a part in the wider activities of the British motor industry. Elected a vice-president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders in 1943, he became president in 1945&#150;6 and served as deputy president until 1950. In 1952&#150;3 he was president of the Motor Industry Research Association, which had recently opened a proving ground and laboratories at Lindley, near Nuneaton. Rootes also served as a vice-president of the Engineering and Allied Employers Federation in the 1950s. He always kept in touch with his old school at Cranbrook and in later years served as chairman of the board of governors. In 1969 he opened the Rootes block (for science) as a memorial to his brother.<br>
<br>As the close business partner of his brother, Rootes played an important role in the family firm and in the industry. In physical characteristics and personality, he complemented William&#151;slightly taller, he had a quieter temperament and a discreet personality. Although the less visible partner in the Rootes Group, he was always involved in major decisions and was the key figure in its successful administration. He was aptly described as providing the &#145;steering and braking system to Sir William's power unit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Coventry Standard</span>, 29 June 1956).<br>
<br>Rootes was always interested in farming and maintained country residences in Kent, earlier at Rumwood Court, Langley, near Maidstone, and from the late 1950s at Polla House, Hothfield, near Ashford. He was married twice; first in 1922 to Ruth Joyce, daughter of William Harding Bensted, a stone merchant, whom he divorced in 1938, and then to Nancy Norris Beadle. A son of the first marriage, Timothy David (<i>b</i>. 1925), who was educated at Harrow, was also active in the Rootes Group from 1947 until his retirement from the board twenty years later. Rootes was a wealthy man with substantial holdings in Rootes Motors. He died of a stroke in King Edward VII Hospital, Easebourne, Midhurst, Sussex, on 20 December 1977.<br>
