<span class="headword">Williams,  William Crwysfab</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Crwys]</span>  (1875&#150;1968), <span class="occ">poet and Congregational minister</span>, was born on 4 January 1875, the first son of the eleven children of John Williams and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davies at 9 Fagwr Road, Craig-cefn-parc, in the parish of Llangyfelach, Swansea valley, Glamorgan. His father was a shoemaker and employed four others, including his own brother, J. Williams (Ap Llewellyn), who taught his nephew the intricacies of the strict metre. William was educated at Pencelyn primary school in Craig-cefn-parc, as well as through the activities of the Independent chapel of Pant-y-Crwys. He left school to follow the family trade, but he began preaching in 1892 and was accepted into Gwynfryn School, the seminary for preachers at Ammanford, Carmarthenshire.<br>
<br>On 3 October 1894 he became a student at the University College of North Wales, Bangor, though he resided at the Bala-Bangor Congregationalist college, where he mixed with a notable generation of students who contributed immensely to the cultural and religious life of Wales. As a student Williams had adopted as his middle name Crwysfab (the basis of his later bardic name), and he also won his first eisteddfodic chair at the Hope Hall, Liverpool. He worshipped as a hero John Morris Jones, whose lectures he attended, and also greatly admired E. Herber Evans, the principal. It was at the University College that Williams met his future wife, Grace Harriet Jones (1876/7&#150;1937), daughter of Robert Charles Jones, a Calvinistic Methodist minister. He married Grace, who later became a teacher, at Menai Bridge, Anglesey, on 16 August 1899; the couple had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Having been ordained in 1898 at Rehoboth, Bryn-mawr, an industrial town then in Brecknockshire, Williams, as a young minister, soon made an impact. At the national eisteddfod of Wales in Merthyr Tudful in 1901, he was accepted into the bardic circle as Crwys and began a long association, winning the national eisteddfod crowns at Colwyn Bay (1910), Carmarthen (1911), and Corwen (1919). In 1938 he was elected as the archdruid and served for eight years, accepting Princess Elizabeth as an honorary member of the Gorsedd y Beirdd in 1946. He visited the bardic circles of Cornwall and Brittany and was in the delegation in 1947 led by W. J. Gruffydd to study the Breton language.<br>
<br>Williams left Bryn-mawr in 1915 after involving himself for six years as a councillor on the Brecknockshire county council as well as writing a history of the church. There were two reasons that he left: he wanted an itinerant ministry and he recognized the decline of the Welsh language in Blaenau Gwent. So in 1915 he moved to Swansea as the south Wales representative of the Bible Society, and for the next twenty-five years he combined his duties as a travelling secretary with his own lecturing, preaching, and adjudicating at eisteddfodau, as well as selling volumes of his own poetry. His first collection, <span class="italic">Cerddi Crwys</span> (1920), went into six editions, and the next three volumes, <span class="italic">Cerddi newydd Crwys</span> (1924), <span class="italic">Trydydd cerddi Crwys</span> (1935), and <span class="italic">Cerddi Crwys: y pedwerydd llyfr</span> (1944), were also best-sellers. An anthology of his well-known lyrics later appeared under the title <span class="italic">Cerddi Crwys: detholiad</span> (1955; repr. 1965).<br>
<br>Williams's lyrics became popular, such as &#145;Melin Trefin&#146;, the poems to the mill in Pembrokeshire; &#145;Dysgub y dail&#146;, to the road sweeper in autumn; and &#145;Y border bach&#146;, to the cottage flower beds. Three of his poems were included in the <span class="italic">Oxford Book of Welsh Verse</span> (1962) and the editor, Thomas Parry, regarded Williams's &#145;San Malo&#146; as one of the finest lyrics in the language. In prose he wrote of his life and travels in <span class="italic">Mynd a dod</span> (1940) and <span class="italic">Pedair pennod</span> (1950).<br>
<br>In retirement Williams led an extremely active life, in great demand as a preacher and as an after-dinner speaker. His anecdotes and retentive memory made his performances very appealing. Between 1946 and 1953 he ministered at Rhydings English Congregationalist Chapel, Swansea, and he carried on preaching into his ninety-second year. He died of heart failure on 13 January 1968 at Mount Pleasant Hospital, Swansea, and was buried at Pant-y-Crwys cemetery in the Swansea valley on 16 January.<br>
