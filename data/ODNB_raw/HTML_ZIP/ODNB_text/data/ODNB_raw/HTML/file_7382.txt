<span class="headword">Dealtry,  William</span>  (1775&#150;1847), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Whitgift, Yorkshire, on 20 July 1775, the son of William Dealtry, a small landowner of Swinefleet, Yorkshire. He attended a village school in Swinefleet before going to Hull grammar school (1790&#150;92), where he was one of a number of distinguished pupils during the headmastership of Revd Joseph Milner, a noted evangelical. He was admitted a sizar at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, in 1792, migrating in the following year to Trinity College. He was elected to a scholarship and graduated BA as second wrangler in the mathematical tripos and second Smith's prizeman in 1796. He spent a year in Clapham as tutor to the sons of Charles Grant, meeting the leading figures in the Clapham Sect. Elected a fellow of Trinity in 1798, he proceeded MA in 1799, and later BD in 1812 and DD in 1829. After his ordination in 1799 he served as curate to Robert Jarratt, rector of Wellington, Somerset, and also a former pupil of Hull grammar school. In 1801 he returned to Cambridge as a college tutor at Trinity, where he became identified as a supporter of Charles Simeon (whose obituary sermon he later delivered). He was an early promoter of the Church Missionary Society, and from 1805 contributed to the <span class="italic">Christian Observer</span>, an evangelical periodical.<br>
<br>Dealtry was appointed professor of mathematics at the East India College, Haileybury, in 1805, and was among the original members of staff when the college opened early in 1806. There he became a friend of Malthus. Remembered as an effective teacher, he published <span class="italic">The Principles of Fluxions</span> (1810), which was characteristic of the textbooks produced by Cambridge mathematicians to prepare students for examinations in the period before the adoption of continental differential notation. He laid stress upon developing his pupils' powers of reasoning. He was revered by evangelicals for his courageous pamphlets defending the British and Foreign Bible Society against the criticisms of influential high-churchmen. He published replies to objections by Christopher Wordsworth (1810), Herbert Marsh (1812), and H. H. Norris (1815). His anniversary sermon to the Church Missionary Society in 1813, answering the political objections to missionary activity in India, was published and circulated to members of parliament. He was also active in the anti-slavery movement.<br>
<br>In July 1813, on Simeon's recommendation, the trustees of the rectory of Clapham, Surrey, presented Dealtry to the living made vacant by the death of John Venn. A year later he married Harriet, daughter of Richard Stainforth, with whom he had a son and three daughters. Relinquishing his Trinity College fellowship, he held the college living of Hatfield Broadoak, Essex, from 1814 to 1816. In 1817 his former pupil Abel Smith, the banker and MP, presented him to the rectory of Watton, Hertfordshire, where he occasionally resided. At Clapham he presided over the building of new churches and promoted parochial visitations among the sick and poor. His sermons delivered there, published in 1827, were neither profoundly theological nor particularly spiritual, but of a more practical tone, giving &#145;clear statements of scriptural truth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Christian Observer</span>, Feb 1848, 135). As a preacher he was noted for the clarity of his exposition. In November 1819, in the period of unrest following Peterloo, he preached a sermon entitled &#145;The dispositions and conduct required of Christians towards their rulers&#146;, drawing a connection between irreligion and disloyalty towards the secular power. During the 1820s he was a correspondent of Thomas Chalmers, whose ideas he disseminated among his Clapham parishioners. His support for church establishments, reiterated in sermons delivered in the early 1830s in response to the campaigns of dissenters against the Church of England's temporal privileges, increasingly aligned him with more orthodox Anglican churchmen. The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, of which he became a committee member, published his <span class="italic">Religious Establishments Tried by the Word of God</span> (1833); membership of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel also signalled his attachment to the Anglican establishment.<br>
<br>On 25 February 1830 Dealtry was appointed by Charles Sumner, bishop of Winchester, chancellor of the diocese of Winchester with a canonry in the cathedral; he resigned his living at Watton (though he retained Clapham until his death). Energetic in persuading churchwardens to extend accommodation and restore the fabric of churches, he was credited with achieving a general improvement in the decorousness of church interiors in Hampshire. He was appointed archdeacon of Surrey in 1845 and was chosen by Lord John Russell to deliver the sermon to both houses of parliament on the day of national penitence and fasting observed on 24 March 1847 in response to the famines in Ireland and Scotland. By then he was severely ill. Dealtry died at Brighton on 15 October 1847, survived by his wife and three children. Contemporaries knew him as a cheerful man, with a ready wit allied to a natural humility of character. He gave generously to charity in his lifetime with the result that his accumulated wealth was said to amount to no more than the equivalent of a year's income.<br>
