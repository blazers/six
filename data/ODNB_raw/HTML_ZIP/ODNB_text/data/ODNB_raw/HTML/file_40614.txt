<span class="headword">Smith, Sir  Clement</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1552), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the second son of Thomas Smith, gentleman, of Rivenhall, Essex, and Isabel, daughter and heir of William Foster of Little Baddow, Essex. He began his career as the dependant of his prosperous elder brother, John (<i>d</i>. 1545), of Cressing Temple, Essex, and Wootton Wawen, Warwickshire, who in 1513 became lord treasurer's remembrancer in the exchequer through the intervention of the incumbent, Edmund Denny. On 4 December 1539 John Smith was advanced to second baron of the exchequer, and subsequently knighted. Clement Smith was granted the office of lord treasurer's remembrancer for life in survivorship with his brother on 2 December 1539. He occupied the office until his death on 26 August 1552. The remembrancer headed one of the principal divisions of the exchequer of audit, responsible for important aspects of accounting and debt collection. Smith had already been active in the exchequer from at least 1531 as a clerk and attorney in the exchequer of pleas.<br>
<br>At some time before 1536, probably during the first half of the decade, Smith married Dorothy Seymour, the youngest daughter of Sir John Seymour (<i>d</i>. 1536) of Wolf Hall, Wiltshire. The marriage of his sister-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68051/', "Jane Seymour")</script>, to Henry VIII on 30 May 1536 thrust Smith towards the centre of court life. The circumstances that produced Smith's marriage are obscure, but his connection to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25159/', "Sir Edward Seymour")</script>, Jane's eldest brother, dated back to 1531, if not earlier, and Smith remembered his long-deceased father-in-law fondly in his will of 1552. The marriage produced three sons and four daughters, including his son and heir <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25832/', "Sir John Smythe (1533/4&#150;1607)")</script> of Little Baddow, the diplomat and military writer.<br>
<br>In 1536 Smith began the acquisition of a landed estate in Essex through a combination of private purchases, crown leases, and, in 1544, the purchase of Bourchiers Hall, Coggeshall, Essex, from the court of augmentations. By 1543 he had attained the standing of esquire and was on the Essex commission of the peace. Smith was assessed for the subsidy of 1545 on lands and fees in London valued at &pound;100 per annum (of which two-thirds was his exchequer salary) and another &pound;50 per annum in Essex properties. He continued making purchases in Essex up to 1550, mostly from private individuals but including a favourable exchange of lands with the crown in August 1547. He was knighted by Edward VI on 22 February 1547. Smith sat in the parliaments of 1545 and 1547 for Maldon, Essex; no record of his activity survives. His likely patron for these elections was the Parr family. Smith leased Bradwell Manor from Queen Katherine Parr and was her farmer for the profits of Great Baddow, Essex; his cousin John Smith was a receiver of the queen's lands.<br>
<br>Smith's Roman Catholicism was evident both in his lifetime and in the devout personal language of his last will and testament. In 1550&#150;51, as part of the government's attack on Princess Mary's religion, several prominent court Catholics were singled out for official displeasure, Smith included. He suffered a brief imprisonment in the Fleet in 1550, and was &#145;chidden&#146; by the king on 24 March 1551. He appears to have been protected earlier by the regime of Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset, and Smith remained a supporter of the disgraced lord protector. In April 1550 he exploited his exchequer office to issue legal proceedings against John Dudley, earl of Warwick, for substantial unpaid taxes. Dudley brought the issue to the privy council and Smith was reprimanded for excess zeal, in what had clearly been a partisan manoeuvre.<br>
<br>Smith wrote his will on 13 July 1551, with a codicil of 10 August 1552. He died at Little Baddow on 26 August 1552. His two younger sons, Bennet and Clement, were assigned life annuities and were to be apprenticed to learned auditors or other officers of the law courts. His heir, John Smith, began immediately in 1553 to sell portions of his inheritance to finance his voluntary exile abroad as a Catholic soldier of fortune. His widow, Dame Dorothy, had already been the recipient of royal munificence, including a lease of the site of the monastery of Coggeshall, Essex, in 1550. She married Thomas Leventhorpe in 1553. On 8 February 1553 she was awarded an annuity of &pound;66 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. to raise her niece Lady Elizabeth Seymour, one of Protector Somerset's four daughters. In his lifetime Smith had been well connected among the mercantile and legal &eacute;lites of London, and counted two lord mayors&#151;Sir William Bowyer and Sir Thomas White&#151;among his close friends. His executors included the court Catholics John Ryther, cofferer of the household, and Robert Rochester, comptroller of Princess Mary's household.<br>
