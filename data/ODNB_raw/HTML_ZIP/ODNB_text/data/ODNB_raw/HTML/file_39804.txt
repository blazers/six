<span class="headword">Beer,  Esmond Samuel  de</span>  (1895&#150;1990), <span class="occ">historian and benefactor</span>, was born on 15 September 1895 in Dunedin, South Island, New Zealand, the second son and fourth and youngest child of Isidore Samuel de Beer (1860&#150;1934), merchant, and his wife, Emily (1864&#150;1930), daughter of Bendix Hallenstein. His family on both sides was Jewish (though his maternal grandmother came of Lincolnshire farming stock) and had reached New Zealand from Germany, by way of Australia, during the 1860s, in his grandfather's generation. The continuing success of Hallensteins, the family clothing chain, gave him ample means for a life of private research in England, where he lived from his schooldays onward; it was never necessary for him to hold a salaried post. After early schooling in Dunedin he attended Mill Hill School, London, from 1910 to 1914, in which year he went up to New College, Oxford, to read history. After army service, first in the ranks of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire light infantry and then as a lieutenant in the 2nd battalion 35th Sikh regiment of the Indian army (1916&#150;19), he returned to Oxford, taking a special wartime BA in 1920 (MA 1925). He then studied at University College, London, and in 1923 received a London MA for a thesis on political parties during the ministry of Thomas Osborne, first earl of Danby (1631&#150;1712).<br>
<br>The later seventeenth century remained de Beer's lifelong intellectual centre. As he wrote of his mentor, Sir Charles Firth, whose assistant he became, he was at home there and almost on terms of friendship with its men and women. He built up a large private library, most of which was dispersed by gift, chiefly to the University of Otago in Dunedin, in the 1980s, when he could himself no longer use it. An omnivorous reader, he retained so well what he read that, in his last bedridden years when his sight had failed, he could pass time by recalling it verbatim. Together with his sisters, Mary (1890&#150;1981) and Dora (1891&#150;1982), his companions in a succession of London houses, he acquired a small but well-chosen art collection, which he gave to the Dunedin Public Art Gallery in 1982. He and his sisters had already given Iolo A. Williams's library of eighteenth-century English literature to the university and made a succession of other substantial gifts to the Dunedin Public Art Gallery and the Otago Museum.<br>
<br>De Beer's scholarly reputation derived from his editions of the diary of John Evelyn and the correspondence of John Locke. They were carried through virtually single-handed, despite the impression given by the punctilio of his acknowledgements. Taken together, they provide a remarkable overview of the cultural and intellectual milieu of their time, being marked by an easy mastery of bibliographical, biographical, literary, and historical skills as well as of the circumstances of living in and out of seventeenth-century England. Their editor's curiosity and his conviction that the treatment of any topic should be complete, as far as its carefully weighed merits allowed, exactly balance his feeling for conciseness and his passion for eliminating the otiose. He began work on Evelyn in the late 1920s by revising an existing transcript. Early in the 1930s he was formally invited by the Clarendon Press to prepare their edition. As published in 1955 the six volumes are the first satisfactory rendering of the diary and its author: a full and scrupulous text, sustained by an introduction and appendices and by some 12,000 footnotes, the whole made accessible by a large and exemplary index. Separately published by-products were magisterial essays on the origin and diffusion of the term &#145;Gothic&#146;, the development of the European guidebook, and the early history of London street lighting.<br>
<br>In 1956, after the task had been refused by another scholar, de Beer began the second great instalment of his life's work, his Clarendon Press edition of Locke's correspondence. He himself brought together much of the material. When its first two volumes appeared in 1976 he was already past eighty, but he followed them punctually with five more before his health began seriously to decline in 1982. The eighth, completing the record of some 3650 items, came out in 1989.<br>
<br>De Beer's direct services to scholarship were supplemented by unstinting generosity to institutions, societies, and individuals, for preference through intermediaries, in his lifetime and by bequest. He gave generous and judicious support to the Bodleian, British, and London libraries, where he was a regular reader; his subsidies ensured the publication of John Cawte Beaglehole's edition of the journals of Captain James Cook and the Anglo-Australian edition of Cook's charts and views. He was both benefactor and practical helper of the Royal Historical Society, the Historical Association, the Bibliographical Society, and the London Topographical Society. Two London University institutes engaged his special loyalty: he was honorary librarian at the Institute of Historical Research (1940&#150;45), and he and his sisters established at the Warburg Institute a fund in memory of Fritz Saxl. He was an honorary fellow of New College, Oxford (1959), and the Warburg (1978), and a fellow of the Royal Historical Society (1927), the Society of Antiquaries (1942), the Royal Society of Literature (1958), and University College, London (1967), as well as being vice-president (1966) and president (1972&#150;8) of the Hakluyt Society and vice-president of the Cromwell Association (1980). He held honorary doctorates from the universities of Durham (1956), Oxford (1957), and Otago (1963), and he was a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery (1959&#150;67) and a member of the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art (1965&#150;70). In 1965 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy and in 1969 was appointed CBE.<br>
<br>De Beer valued such recognitions. He prized more highly, however, the private, individual state which allowed him freedom personally and vicariously to advance learning. By disposition bookish, shy, and a little stiff, mildly pedantic, and deliberate and precise in manner and speech, he was also courteous, friendly, and humorous. He had a knowledgeable love of comfort, food, wine, and travel, especially in Italy. His physical stamina matched his scholarly tenacity. A tireless walker and a climber, he took special pleasure in the far south of the South Island of New Zealand and the island of Raasay near Skye in Scotland, where he spent summer holidays in company with his sisters and others. He had a wide acquaintance with literature, particularly drama, Shakespeare and Ibsen being two of his heroes, and with music, principally opera. In adult life he neither practised the Jewish religion nor adopted another. De Beer's aspect was dapper and benevolent: he had a small moustache and wore spectacles. Of middle height, he was broad-shouldered but thinnish in build, with a large and powerful head. A confirmed and lifelong bachelor, he died on 3 October 1990 in Stoke House, a residential home for the aged in Stoke Hammond, near Milton Keynes, north Buckinghamshire.<br>
