<span class="headword">Tappe,  Eric Ditmar</span>  (1910&#150;1992), <span class="occ">Romanian scholar</span>, was born on 8 July 1910 at Homelands, Haringey Park, London, the son of Adolph Robert Tappe, a bank clerk of German extraction, and his wife, Winifred, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davis. At the time of his birth registration his parents lived at 47 Queens Road, Finsbury Park. He attended Sir Roger Cholmeley's School at Highgate as a foundation scholar and in 1928 won an open scholarship in classics to Oriel College, Oxford. He was awarded a second in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1932, following which he was appointed sixth-form classics master at Brighton College. Four years later he moved to a similar post at King Edward VII School in Sheffield. One of his pupils, Harold Guite, later recalled that of ten students in his class, eight won scholarships to Oxford or Cambridge, one to London, and one to Sheffield: &#145;Without any overt pressure or haste he had us devouring Greek and Latin so fast that we had read some 30 texts before we went to university&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 28 May 1992).<br>
<br>In October 1940 Tappe was called up and commissioned in the Royal Signals. After service in Northern Ireland he was posted in April 1942 to Oxford to organize the signals unit of the university senior training corps. Seeking a more adventurous role, in March 1944 he answered a call for volunteers to learn Romanian. While following a crash course in the language taught by Grigore Nandris at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, University of London, he received orders to undergo parachute training for a drop into Romania, where it was intended that he would link up with the anti-German resistance. King Michael's coup against Marshal Antonescu and Romania's <i>volte-face</i> in August 1944 pre-empted this mission and he was assigned instead&#151;after arriving more conventionally by plane in Bucharest&#151;to the British military mission that was sent that autumn as part of the Allied Control Commission to supervise the implementation of the armistice agreement between the allies and Romania. He served with the mission chiefly as a staff officer, but with occasional duties as an interpreter.<br>
<br>While serving in Romania, from October 1944 to February 1946, Tappe witnessed the imposition of communist rule and the heavy-handed behaviour of the Soviet authorities towards the Romanians, among whom he made several friends. Whenever he could he used his official position to protect them; while off duty he would pin union jacks to Romanian-owned cars to prevent their being commandeered by Soviet officers. One night, as the senior officer on duty at the headquarters of the British mission, he foiled an attempt by Soviet troops to kidnap General Nicolae R&#259;descu, the former Romanian prime minister, who had taken refuge there to escape arrest, by firing warning shots over the heads of the advancing soldiers.<br>
<br>After his demobilization in 1946 Tappe resumed his position at King Edward VII School, but in April 1948 he was appointed to a lectureship in Romanian language and literature at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies. He remained there until his retirement in 1978. For the first decade his main teaching duties involved giving army officers instruction in elementary Romanian. At the same time he set himself the task of raising the study of Romanian language and literature to the level of other language degrees at London University. In 1954 he devised a syllabus and courses for a BA degree in Romanian, the first of its kind offered at a British university. He taught all aspects of the degree single-handed until 1969, when he was finally given an assistant. He was promoted to a personal chair in Romanian studies in 1974, the first such chair in the English-speaking world.<br>
<br>Tappe's publications reflected his efforts both to make Romanian literature accessible to the Anglophone public and to provide teaching materials for his students. An anthology entitled <span class="italic">Romanian Prose and Verse</span> (1956) was followed by <span class="italic">Documents Concerning Romanian History, 1427&#150;1621</span> (1964), meticulously researched and transcribed from British archives. His sensitivity as a translator was reflected in <span class="italic">Fantastic Tales by Mircea Eliade and Mihai Niculescu</span> (1969; he corresponded occasionally with Eliade) and <span class="italic">Sketches and Stories by I. L. Caragiale</span> (1979). Caragiale was also the subject of a monograph, published in Twayne's <span class="roman">World Authors Series</span> in 1974.<br>
<br>Tappe's distaste for the communist authorities in Romania made him a keen supporter, academically and financially, of &eacute;migr&eacute; Romanian scholarly journals. He never forgot the friends he had made in Romania. Despite being banned from the country until 1962 (when he did return he was placed under permanent surveillance) he maintained discreet links with some of his friends and worked to obtain the release from prison of others who had been jailed. In 1962 he personally paid the bulk of the &#145;ransom&#146; demanded by the Romanian authorities for the release of a former employee of the British military mission in Bucharest, Maria Golescu, who after thirteen years' imprisonment was allowed to travel to Britain with her aged mother. With further assistance from Tappe both Golescus lived out the rest of their lives in Eastbourne.<br>
<br>Tappe was among the most influential champions of Romanian studies in the English-speaking world in the latter half of the twentieth century. As a teacher he had a gift for inspiring enthusiasm. He brought a sense of humour to his classes, which matched the sense of the absurd in Romanian literature. Tall and portly, and a man of exceptional kindness and warmth, he was an avuncular figure to his students, with many of whom he maintained close contact after their graduation. As a colleague he was always willing to give advice when asked and was generous with his time. After his retirement many were beneficiaries of his hospitality at his home in Markwick Terrace, St Leonard's, Sussex, among them several of his Romanian friends. His last years were clouded by the onset of Parkinson's disease, and he spent his final months in a nursing home, Queen Mary's Lodge, St Leonard's, where he died, unmarried, on 13 May 1992 of bronchopneumonia. He was cremated at St Leonard's crematorium.<br>
