<span class="headword">Shippen,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1673, <em>d.</em> 1743), <span class="occ">politician and Jacobite sympathizer</span>, was baptized at Prestbury, Cheshire, on 30 July 1673, the second son of the parish priest, William Shippen. Educated first under Roger Dale at Stockport grammar school, on 16 July 1687, aged fourteen, he entered Brasenose College, Oxford, as a commoner. Barely a year after his matriculation, however, he moved from the university to be elected a king's scholar at Westminster, where he came under the influence of Richard Busby. He was admitted a pensioner at Trinity College, Cambridge, on 26 June 1691 and became a scholar there in 1692 before going to the Middle Temple in 1693. He graduated BA in 1694 and was called to the bar in 1699.<br>
<br>The early years of Queen Anne's reign witnessed a growing polarization of the English political nation and saw Shippen working hard to establish his reputation as a tory polemicist. His first literary effort, a verse satire published in 1704 with the title <span class="italic">Faction Display'd</span>, depicted the junto lords as the traitorous Catiline conspirators. This jibe won the accolade of a paragraph-by-paragraph rebuttal from whig hacks, prompting Shippen to follow up his success with a second poem, <span class="italic">Moderation Display'd</span>. Both pamphlets ran into several editions and marked their author out as a promising candidate for political advancement. His literary output was not sustained, but in 1732 he did publish a defence of Charles I's conduct in which he sought to vindicate Clarendon's <span class="italic">History of the Rebellion</span>. Shippen first entered parliament as the tory member for Bramber in Sussex, which he represented from 1707 to 1713 on the interest of Lord Plymouth, whose son, Dixie Windsor, later became his brother-in-law. Although he possessed little patrimony of his own, on 17 July 1712 he married Frances Stote (<i>d</i>. 1747), the daughter and coheir of Sir Richard Stote of Jesmond Hall, Northumberland, with whom he acquired a fortune of &pound;70,000. In the following year he was returned on the Buller-Carew interest at Saltash in Cornwall, but, being hard pressed by the duke of Wharton's interest there, in 1715 he prevailed upon another brother-in-law, the nonjuring Peter Legh of Lyme, to be returned at his Lancashire pocket borough of Newton, which he represented at Westminster for the remainder of his life.<br>
<br>In the House of Commons, Shippen became identified as a zealous party man and useful speaker on contentious issues. Following establishment of the tory ministry in 1710 he emerged as a prominent member of the October Club, and a year later he was elected one of the seven commissioners of public accounts set up to discredit the previous whig administration by means of an inquiry into the alleged financial irregularities of the duke of Marlborough. He was a strong proponent of the occasional conformity and schism bills, and in August 1714 stood out brazenly against the offer of a reward for the Pretender's capture. By the time of the queen's death later that month the tory party had become deeply divided; but in the short term, far from resorting to the standard of &#145;King James&#146;, most of its representatives in parliament competed fiercely with their whig enemies to pass &#145;loyal and lucrative legislation on behalf of her Hanoverian successor&#146;  (Colley, 26). Shippen, for example, seconded a motion by Horace Walpole for the payment of arrears to the Hanoverian troops who had fought in the War of the Spanish Succession, offering the ingenuous admission that &#145;he had opposed that payment in the late reign, but &hellip; was for it now&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>But such dalliance with the new regime was to be short-lived. As early as April 1715 Shippen was warning his patron Legh that &#145;all our Letters are opened in defyance of an Act of Parliament&#146;  (Shippen to Legh, 13 April 1715, JRL, Legh of Lyme MSS). Following the arrest of Edward Harvey in September on charges of treasonable correspondence, and the latter's attempted suicide while in prison, a report began circulating in London that Shippen himself had &#145;given Information at the Secret Office ag[ains]t several Persons, s[ai]d to be concerned in a Plot &amp; an intended Invasion from abroad&#146; obliging him to post a personal denial at the Royal Exchange  (&#145;Declaration of William Shippen&#146;). Thereafter, a combination of the earl of Oxford's arrest and committal to the Tower, the flights of Bolingbroke and Ormond to St Germain, the sweeping governmental victories at the general election of 1715, and the proscription of rank-and-file tories from both national and local office following the failure of the Jacobite rising did much to harden partisan attitudes and determine future dynastic loyalties.<br>
<br>Shippen's own reaction to these events was to identify himself unequivocally with the small band of those prepared to work actively for a second Stuart restoration. Although he was ready to write whips soliciting the attendance of tory colleagues at Westminster and to raise funds for the Jacobite cause, his main value was as a parliamentary performer. While not a first-rate orator by reason of his low voice and a tendency to cover his mouth with his glove, for more than a quarter of a century &#145;honest Shippen&#146; raked and harried successive whig ministries with his sometimes intemperately anti-Hanoverian rhetoric, thereby emerging as principal spokesman for the motley crew of parliamentary Jacobites who continued to oppose Hanoverian rule. He was forthright in his opposition to the <span class="roman">Septennial Bill</span> and the <span class="roman">Mutiny Bill</span>, spoke vehemently against repeal of the <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity and Schism Acts</span>, and on 4 December 1717 was committed to the Tower for a provocative speech in a committee on the <span class="roman">Army Supply Bill</span>, the house resolving that he had used words which were &#145;highly dishonourable to, and unjustly reflecting on, his Majesty's Person &amp; Government&#146;. He was charged with having referred to the king's speech as &#145;rather &hellip; calculated for the Meridian of Germany, then for Great Britain&#146;, and to King George himself as &#145;a Stranger to our Language and Constitution&#146;  (&#145;Mr Shippen's case&#146;). Despite being implicated also in the ill-starred Gyllenborg plot, he was soon at large once more, subdued but in unrepentant mood. By March 1718 he was assuring the Pretender that all of his commands would be obeyed &#145;with the utmost pleasure as well as fidelity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Stuart Papers</span>, 6.260). In fact, throughout the whig schism of 1717 to 1720, and the South Sea fiasco which brought it to an end, he worked diligently to prevent the emergence of a mixed ministry of the type that had been common in the two preceding reigns. Indeed, his services in this regard, so the Pretender was informed, could &#145;never be sufficiently acknowledged&#146;  (ibid., 5.558).<br>
<br>Shippen was also persuaded to act as the main channel of communication between the English and Scottish Jacobites, and in the late summer of 1721 he met with George Lockhart in Newcastle to work out the logistics of their correspondence. The two men further discussed the approaches lately made by Lord Sunderland to the English tories, who, according to Shippen, had resolved &#145;to enter into no concert with any of the two contending powers at Court, but to stick together and wait till it pleased God some event might occurr, that would give them occasion to doe [King James] and the country service&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of George Lockhart</span>, 161&#150;6). In the event, Sunderland's premature death and Robert Walpole's emergence as first minister temporarily reunited most of the whigs in parliament, eliminated whatever slim chance there might have been for a parliamentary restoration, and set the scene for another round of plotting and intrigue.<br>
<br>In the longer term, however, scarcely veiled attacks on the king and his ministers combined with a principled hostility to political compromise were bound to prove a self-defeating strategy&#151;one that played increasingly into the hands of Walpole and his associates who used Shippen's all-too-public displays of disaffection to damn all tories as Jacobites and foment mistrust between the whig and tory elements of the patriot opposition beginning to emerge in parliament. Temporary truces between Jacobites and Hanoverian tories were occasionally possible. For example, with a major row brewing at the prospect of a tobacco excise, the 1733 session opened with an attack on the king's address by all members of the opposition as part of a concerted thrust against the ministry. Typically forthright, Shippen's speech of 16 January made ominous references to &#145;Jealousies and Suspicions without Doors&#146;. There was, he told the house, such a general spirit abroad that it could not:<blockquote>be ascribed to any one Set of Men: They cannot be branded with the Name of Jacobites or of Republicans. No; the whole People of <i>England</i> seem to be united in this Spirit of Jealousy and Opposition; and it ought not to be entirely neglected. (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 3, 1733, 393)</blockquote>In 1734 Shippen again distinguished himself, speaking forcefully in debates on the address, the Seville treaty, the army, and the <span class="roman">Septennial Act</span>; but, with the excise crisis and general elections passed, he showed himself determined once more to prize open fissures within the opposition's ranks. In February 1737 he was among forty-five tory MPs who absented themselves from the division on Pulteney's motion to increase Prince Frederick's allowance, as much perhaps from a distrust of the prince and an unwillingness to be seen coercing the Hanoverian monarchy as from any explicit motives of Jacobitism. Yet, despite the libertarian rhetoric which he frequently used in debates, it would be wrong to view Shippen as either a &#145;pioneer of constitutional opposition&#146; or as a proto-democrat. His purpose throughout was to advance the Stuart cause by any means that seemed likely to prove effective.<br>
<br>As an associate of Francis Atterbury, the Jacobite bishop of Rochester, Shippen was perhaps fortunate not to be taken up in 1722 for complicity in the Atterbury plot. This, together with his sojourn in the Tower in 1717, may well explain his reluctance to commit himself when approached to engage in real business by the Pretender's emissary, who came to England in 1740 to canvass support for a rising of English Jacobites backed by French troops. The agent found King James's friends &#145;more timorous and backward than heretofore, and yet as full of good inclinations as ever&#146;. It was, he reported, &#145;impossible to form any plan of business with them; they shudder at the thought of an attempt when they find it can be compass'd, and yet wish it, and even seem to long for it&#146;. While some remained hearty enough, Shippen in particular, he noted, &#145;trembles, and infuses his fears into the gentlemen to whom the King [that is, James Stuart] wrote&#146; (Sempil to James Stuart, 28 March 1740, <span class="roman">Stuart Papers</span>, 221/109). Consequently, he would be left out of future consultations altogether.<br>
<br>In February 1741 Shippen was among the tory members who quit the house rather than vote for Samuel Sandys's motion addressing the king for Walpole's removal, and afterwards could scarcely conceal his contempt for the patriot whigs: &#145;Robin and I are two honest men, he is for King George and I for King James; but those men with the long cravats [meaning Sandys and his associates] only desire places either under King George or King James&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>). He would not, he asserted, &#145;pull down Robin on republican principles&#146;  (ibid.). His last recorded speech in the House of Commons was in February 1742 against the army estimates which were adopted without a division, &#145;Shippen alone&#146;, as Horace Walpole observed, &#145;unchanged and opposing&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Shippen died, childless, at his Norfolk Street home on 1 May 1743, leaving his small estate to be divided between his brothers Robert and John. He was buried at St Andrew's, Holborn, on 7 May. His misanthropic widow lived separately at Richmond and died on 22 August 1747.<br>
<br>William's eldest surviving brother was <a name="cosubject_25418"></a><span class="headword">Robert Shippen</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1675, <em>d.</em> 1745), <span class="occ">college head</span>, who was baptized at Prestbury, Cheshire, on 27 July 1675. He was educated at Stockport grammar school, matriculated from Merton College, Oxford, on 6 April 1693, and graduated BA in 1696. He then became a fellow of Brasenose, from where, having served as a tutor for several years and proceeded MA in 1699, he was elected professor of music at Gresham College in 1705 and fellow of the Royal Society a year later. In 1710 he returned to Brasenose as principal, resigning his professorship in favour of his brother Edward (1671&#150;1724), and was created DD. In the same year he married Frances, Lady Clerke (<i>d</i>. 1728), the widowed daughter of Richard Legh of Lyme. He was presented successively to the rectories of Great Billing, Northamptonshire (1710), Whitechapel, London (1716), and Amersham, Buckinghamshire (1744). Allegedly chosen head of house by a body of slothful fellows anxious to avoid disruptive change, he became &#145;well known as an overbearing tyrant within the walls of his college&#146;  (Bennett, 149), and was soon embroiled in university politics, being engaged as an ally by Atterbury, then dean of Christ Church, in his bid to break the dominance of William Lancaster, the provost of Queen's. He was vice-chancellor from 1718 to 1723 and died on 24 November 1745 at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he was buried.<br>
