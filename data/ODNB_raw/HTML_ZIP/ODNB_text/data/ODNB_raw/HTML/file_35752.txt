<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ridgeway, Sir  William</span>  (1858&#150;1926), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born on 6 August 1858, the youngest son of the Revd John Henry Ridgeway of Ballydermot, King's county, and Marianna, only daughter of Samuel Ridgeway of Aghanvilla, King's county. Ridgeway's forebears were from Devon, but settled in Ulster under James I. There they intermarried with Cromwellian settlers in King's county&#151;&#145;all first-class fighting men&#146; in Ridgeway's words&#151;and with Huguenot families round Portarlington. He belonged, therefore, to &#145;the pale&#146;, and believed that he had &#145;not a drop of Gaelic blood in his veins&#146;. But from his earliest years he was surrounded by those who had plenty, and they contributed much to his personality and outlook. He was educated at Portarlington School and at Trinity College, Dublin, where he won all the chief classical prizes, studied Sanskrit, and graduated as senior moderator in both classics and modern literature. From Dublin he proceeded in 1876 to Peterhouse, Cambridge, migrating from there in 1878 to Gonville and Caius College, where he was subsequently elected a scholar. He was bracketed fifth in the classical tripos of 1880, and was elected a fellow of his college in the same year. That year he also married Lucy, eldest daughter of Arthur Samuels of Kingstown and sister of Arthur Warren Samuels, judge of the High Court of Justice in Ireland; they had one daughter. In 1881 a vacancy occurred on the classical staff of the college, but Ridgeway was not chosen. His disappointment was severe, and the partisan feeling then engendered delayed the recognition of his originality.<br>
<br>In 1883 Ridgeway was appointed to the chair of Greek at University College, Cork. This left him free to spend five months of every year in Cambridge. He published essays on the historical interpretation of Aristotle, on the size of the Homeric horse, and on the origin of the mathematical element in the teaching of Pythagoras. He was among the first British scholars to recognize the new scientific school of comparative philology in Germany, in marked contrast with the attitude prevailing at Cambridge as late as 1890. But he was deeply indebted to the Cambridge Philological Society and to the encouragement of Dr Henry Jackson. His discoveries, fiercely resisted, passed quickly into currency, and his fearless enquiry emancipated classical study in England from an unintelligent orthodoxy.<br>
<br>The turning point of Ridgeway's career was his appointment in 1892, after the publication of his first substantial book, to the Disney chair of archaeology at Cambridge and his re-election to a fellowship at his own college. Although the Disney chair was then poorly endowed, he resigned his chair at Cork, in which he had rendered important services to Irish education. But his appointment in 1907 to the Brereton readership in classics established his position in Cambridge. The university was then passing through a period of dissension, and Ridgeway's affection for the Anglican church and for the traditions of Cambridge scholarship limited his enthusiasm for reform. The bitter struggle about women's degrees separated him from some of his oldest friends. In the controversy on compulsory Greek he was again one of the opponents of change, but after the end of the First World War he was clear-sighted enough to discourage further resistance.<br>
<br>Ridgeway's first book, <span class="italic">The Origin of Metallic Currency and Weight Standards</span> (1892), attacked current theories of the purely religious origin of Greek coin types, and threw a flood of light on the early life of the Mediterranean lands: it identified the tuna fish, plant silphium, and ox (on early Athenian issues) not as objects of some unknown worship, but as recognized tokens of local commerce. In the first volume of his <span class="italic">Early Age of Greece</span> (1901) he drew a fundamental distinction between the Myceneans, associated by contemporary authors with bronze weapons, figure-of-eight shields, and southern ways of life, and the Achaeans of Homer, whom he proposed to identify with warrior immigrants of the early Iron Age who brought with them the round shields and long iron swords of central Europe and the sterner morals of the north. This work was never completed; of the second volume, parts already in type at his death (dealing with kinship and ancestor-worship in early Europe, and with Ireland in the heroic age) were published by friends in 1931, with an introduction exhibiting later developments of Ridgeway's doctrine. This book is Ridgeway's chief contribution to history. Its main doctrine secured wide acceptance, even among those who attacked it in detail. But the bitterness of the controversy took a tragic colour in Ridgeway's memory, and he retained the conviction that in certain quarters he would never be fairly treated.<br>
<br>In strict logic Ridgeway was weak. In support of a theory, of the truth of which he was convinced, he would use all kinds of evidence, strong and weak alike. Nor did he always give enough consideration to difficulties. But, to quote his pupil Professor D. S. Robertson:<blockquote>his mind's eye surveyed so vast a range of facts that he saw in a flash the great lines of their connexion, and his lively knowledge of human nature kept him always within the limits of reasonableness and good sense &hellip; His words had a rough splendour that stamped them imperishably on his listeners' minds. He did not like formal lecturing; but round a table, with half a dozen students, he was incomparable. His vivid imagination, his width of view, his unbroken contact with reality kept one spellbound, as gems, coins, axeheads, totem-spoons tumbled on to the table from his inexhaustible pockets. He must always have had sensitive fingers, and as his sight failed he depended more and more upon touch. And he knew at once from the way in which new pupils handled and spoke of the stuff which he passed round the table, whether or no they had the makings of real archaeologists. (Quoted in <span class="italic">DNB</span>)</blockquote>In <span class="italic">The Origin and Influence of the Thoroughbred Horse</span> (1905) Ridgeway showed the development of the horse from its small Homeric ancestor through admixture of zebraic blood by the horse-breeding Greeks of north Africa and their Muslim successors. This conclusion he reached almost simultaneously with, and independently of, the zoologists J. C. Ewart and H. F. Osborn, completing their zoological results by his historical study. His British Academy paper, <span class="italic">Who were the Romans?</span> (1907), revived by fresh evidence Schwegler's view of the racial distinction between the Sabine or patrician element in Rome, and the Latin or plebeian  (cf. <span class="italic">Cambridge Ancient History</span>, 4, 1926, chap. 13). In <span class="italic">The Origin of Tragedy, with Special Reference to Greek Tragedians</span> (1910) Ridgeway argued that tragedy arose from the commemoration of local heroes at their tombs, the representations being later drawn into the ritual of Dionysus and combined with the satyric plays. In <span class="italic">Dramas and Dramatic Dances of Non-European Races</span> (1915) he confirmed his theory by comprehensive induction from China to Bolivia and Japan, from Australia and central Africa to Alaska. Other interests of his were represented by his studies of <span class="italic">Cuchulain</span> (1905 and 1907), and unpublished papers on the (Danish) origin of the Scots and on the origin of ballads in the praises of popular heroes (lecture delivered in 1926).<br>
<br>In later years Ridgeway was a frequent and valued correspondent of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, remarkable both for range of subject and vigour of style. To the last his enthusiasm for the great social ends of classical study remained unabated, and none of the honours that fell to him gave him more pleasure than his election as president of the Classical Association for 1914. The establishment of the Cambridge school of anthropology was a monument to another side of his influence. The general recognition of his work was marked on his sixtieth birthday (1913) by the presentation of a volume of <span class="italic">Essays and Studies</span> in his honour. Ridgeway was elected FBA in 1904, was president of the Royal Anthropological Institute from 1908 to 1910, and received honorary doctorates from the universities of Dublin (1902), Manchester (1906), Aberdeen (1908), and Edinburgh (1921). He was knighted in 1919.<br>
<br>No picture of Ridgeway's life would be complete which did not indicate the extraordinary stimulus which he exerted upon others, and his untiring interest in the research and the prospects of younger men. His home at Fen Ditton, about 4 miles from Cambridge, with its pleasant garden, was the constant resort of scholars engaged in many kinds of research, not merely in classical or antiquarian learning. Such intercourse was only a part of his cordial acquaintance with all sorts and conditions of men.<br>
<br>The last months of Ridgeway's life were darkened by the sudden death of his wife in May 1926. His companion almost since his boyhood, she shared his ideals and was hardly less interested than he was in his work. His own death occurred suddenly at Fen Ditton on 12 August 1926, not quite three months after that of his wife.<br>
<br>Later developments in Ridgeway's two main fields, anthropology and the classics, have shown him to have been a less central figure than his contemporaries thought. He was, especially in his later work, too idiosyncratic and too much a prisoner of his time with his recurrent appeals to the image of &#145;tall, fair-haired men&#146;, to make seminal and lasting contributions. Reading with hindsight his exchanges with such figures as Malinowski, one is continually struck by the originality and learning behind his individual insights, yet uncomfortably aware of being in the presence of an isolated stream of thought.<br>
