<span class="headword">Longmuir,  John</span>  (1803&#150;1883), <span class="occ">poet and lexicographer</span>, was born on 13 November 1803 near Stonehaven, Kincardineshire, the son of John Longmuir and his wife, Christian Paterson. In 1814 his parents moved to Aberdeen, where he was educated at the grammar school, and at Marischal College. After graduating MA he completed divinity studies. In 1825 he published <span class="italic">The College and other Poems</span>, the title poem of which criticizes the academic system of the time.<br>
<br>After leaving university Longmuir taught for some years in schools at Stonehaven and Forres. In July 1833 he was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Forres. On 2 January 1835 he married Lillias, daughter of Alexander Milne, a bookseller in Forres. He was appointed evening lecturer at Trinity Chapel, Aberdeen, in 1837, and in September 1840 was ordained minister to the city's Mariner's Church. At the Disruption of 1843 he went over with most of his congregation to the Free Church of Scotland. For some years he was lecturer on geology at King's College, Aberdeen. His first wife having died, he married, second, Dorothy Hawthorn Dixon in 1857. On retiring from lecturing in 1859 he was granted the degree of LLD.<br>
<br>Longmuir published three further collections of verse, <span class="italic">Bible Lays</span> (1838), <span class="italic">Ocean Lays</span> (1854), and <span class="italic">Lays for the Lambs</span> (1860). He produced a popular guidebook to Dunnottar Castle in 1835, and one to Speyside in 1860. He also published a volume on a local monolith, <span class="italic">The Maiden Stone of Bennachie</span> (1869), <span class="italic">A Run through the Land of Burns and the Covenanters</span> (1872), and an edition of Alexander Ross's <span class="italic">Helenore</span> (1866).<br>
<br>In addition to his other accomplishments Longmuir was a noted lexicographer. He edited a dictionary combining the work of Walker and Webster in 1864, and revised Walker's <span class="italic">Rhyming Dictionary</span> in 1865. His revision of Jamieson's <span class="italic">Scottish Dictionary</span> appeared in an abridged edition in 1867 and in four volumes between 1879 and 1912, and is probably his most important work. As a preacher Longmuir was noted for his conversational style, and several of his sermons were published. He was popular as a platform speaker, particularly in the cause of temperance. He died at 5 Dee Place, Aberdeen, on 7 May 1883, survived by his wife and at least one son, A. D. Longmuir.<br>
