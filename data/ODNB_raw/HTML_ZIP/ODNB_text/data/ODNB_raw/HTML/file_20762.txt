<span class="headword">O'More,  Rory</span> <span class="st"> [Roger Moore]</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1592, <em>d.</em> in or after 1666), <span class="occ">conspirator</span>, was the son of Calvach O'More (<i>d</i>. 1618) and Margaret Sherlock or Scurlog. Calvach's father had been recognized by the Tudors as chieftain of Laois, but the territory was subsequently shired as Queen's county, and planted with an English colony. In 1567 Queen Elizabeth granted Calvach, in partial recompense, escheated lands amounting to 1078 acres in the barony of Carbury, in the north-west corner of co. Kildare, and former church lands in the parish of Kilmainham Wood in the north of co. Meath. During the plantation of Ulster (1609&#150;10) James I granted him about 7000 acres, in south-east co. Armagh, originally assigned to Art Mac Baron O'Neill, the father of Owen Roe O'Neill.<br>
<br>Rory O'More inherited these scattered estates on the death of his father in 1618. According to a family memoir, he sold the Kilmainham Wood estate because of scruples about owning land which originally belonged to the church, and bought, rather than inherited, the Armagh estate with the proceeds. By 1641 he had married a daughter of Sir Patrick Barnewall, of whom little is known.<br>
<br>In February 1641 O'More approached Conor, Lord Maguire, then attending the parliament in Dublin. He urged that the Anglo-Scottish crisis offered the Irish a chance to regain lost estates by force. He also drew attention to Maguire's own debts and claimed to have secured support for his plan in Leinster and Connaught. The latter claim, while probably untrue, was doubtless given credence by O'More's marital connections to some of the leading families of the pale, including Viscount Gormanstown, the earl of Fingall, and Luke Netterville, the three individuals who would ultimately assume local leadership of the insurgency. When parliament resumed sitting in May, O'More had a second meeting with Maguire and other Ulster conspirators drawn in by the latter. O'More's motives for plotting are not as clear-cut as those of Maguire and Phelim O'Neill, both of whom were deeply in debt. O'More either borrowed heavily or was, in fact, quite wealthy, to judge from the dowries, amounting in aggregate to &pound;4000, that he paid to marry off his daughters. The most likely explanation for his involvement was not immediate financial pressure but that he was &#145;Piqued by the loss of his ancient patrimony&#146; in co. Laois  (Plunkett, fol. 5). That he may have seen himself as the leader of a revived O'More clan is suggested by his recall of the &#145;several septs that were banished from Leix&#146; to serve him as soldiers  (&#145;Examination of Lewis O'Moore&#146;, fol. 128).<br>
<br>Having initiated the plot, O'More played a subordinate role as it was transformed from vague scheming into a purposeful movement based on confident and reasonably effective planning. In September 1641 the conspirators decided on a two-pronged rising, involving the seizure of Dublin Castle on 23 October in concert with an uprising in Ulster. O'More was one of the leaders entrusted with taking the castle. The plot was, however, betrayed by Owen O'Connolly on the night of 22 October. O'More, suspicious of O'Connolly, had changed his lodgings that night: he evaded arrest and was ferried upriver towards Lucan, where he took shelter with his daughter and her husband, Patrick Sarsfield of co. Dublin, the parents of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24671/', "Patrick Sarsfield")</script>, the Jacobite leader in the 1689&#150;91 war.<br>
<br>As the insurgents reached the limits of their territorial gains in Ulster it was to the south that the momentum of the insurgency was maintained. O'More probably played a role in this strategic reorientation. At any rate he was one of the three leaders of an insurgent column that routed government forces at Julianstown on 29 November 1641, and cut off Drogheda from the south. Some 500 government soldiers were killed in this demoralizing reverse which, if not &#145;very considerable&#146;  (Plunkett, fol. 5), hastened the alliance of the pale nobility with the Ulster insurgents.<br>
<br>While the alliance would probably have been forced on the pale nobility by government hostility, it was certainly facilitated by &#145;the trust they reposed in Roger Moore, who by his marriage to Sir Patrick Barnwall's daughter, was allied to most of them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Confederation</span>, ed. Gilbert, 1.34&#150;5). In early December they met the insurgents at Knockcrofty, where they were asked &#145;wherefore they came armed into the pale&#146;  (ibid., 36). O'More's masterful reply played on the palesmen's grievances, fears, and aspirations: &#145;We are the sole subjects, who, being much the more numerous and powerful, are made incapable of raising our fortunes by serving our King in any place of honour, profit or trust, in that country wherein we were born&#146;. He reminded them that the English parliament and the Scottish covenanters would not discriminate between Old English and Gaelic Irish Catholics: &#145;you are marked forth for destruction as well as we&#146;. He concluded with a powerful appeal to the nascent sense of common Irish identity: &#145;We are of the same religion and the same nation; our interest and our sufferings are the same; the bonds of friendship and alliance are mutual between us; and, from the highest to the lowest, we affect you dearly&#146;  (ibid., 36). On this showing O'More has been justifiably called &#145;the most skilful politician among the Irish leaders&#146;  (Perceval-Maxwell, 245).<br>
<br>The period from December 1641 to March 1642 saw the insurgents besiege Drogheda, while trying to prevent relief from Dublin by encircling the capital with insurgent encampments. Shortly after the Knockcrofty meeting in early December, O'More set about instigating an insurgent military organization in co. Kildare. Here, as elsewhere, the original <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> was in danger of being subsumed within a popular revolt characterized by attacks on British civilians. O'More's directions that &#145;no man should be wronged in goods or body&#146;  (&#145;Deposition of William Pilsworth&#146;, TCD, MS 813, fol. 3) were typical of the attempts by the insurgent leadership to rein in their followers. This policy was only moderately successful, as evidenced by his followers' killing three household servants after capturing Castle Carbury.<br>
<br>O'More was nominated as one of seven colonels raised from co. Kildare, and served with his regiment at Newcastle, west of Dublin, in January 1642. The following month this force was pushed back from Dublin, and he shifted his attention to the north of Dublin and to Drogheda. In early March 1642 O'More met with Viscount Gormanstown, the leader of the pale nobility, to compose an appeal for help to Mountgarret, the insurgent leader in south Leinster, and to adopt a draft national &#145;model of government&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Confederation</span>, ed. Gilbert, 1.36&#150;7). The plan for a national government ultimately came to fruition in June 1642 with the creation of the supreme council of the confederate Catholics. However, Mountgarret did not respond to the appeal and, shortly afterwards, Ormond relieved Drogheda.<br>
<br>During the spring of 1642, with government forces launching attacks deep into Catholic territory, O'More was placed in command of King's county and the adjacent half of Queen's county. On 15 April the insurgents attempted to intercept the royalist governor, Ormond, on his return march from Athy towards Dublin at Kilrush in co. Kildare. In the subsequent battle O'More, commanding one of the three Irish divisions, repulsed the initial cavalry charge. A subsequent charge, however, scattered the entire insurgent army.<br>
<br>Between July and September 1642 &#145;General Moore&#146; commanded the unsuccessful siege of Birr, King's county  (<span class="italic">Irish Confederation</span>, ed. Gilbert, 1.lxxvii&#150;lxxix). In a letter written from Wexford on 20 September 1642 he complained of the &#145;troublesome charge of generalship cast on me in upper Leinster&#146;  (Meehan, 334). He styled himself Ruri de O'Mora and expressed his intention to set up a school of Irish and acquire a printing press in Irish type. Soon afterwards he was relieved of this &#145;troublesome charge&#146;, being among several officers cashiered during the pruning and reorganization of the Leinster army into six field infantry regiments on regular lines. However, on 14 January 1643 O'More assisted Thomas Preston, the newly appointed general of Leinster, in capturing Birr, using recently acquired siege artillery.<br>
<br>Thereafter, O'More was a marginal figure in the Catholic confederation. In May 1644 he embroiled himself in attempts by Randal Mac Donnell, earl of Antrim, to wrest command of expeditionary forces to attack the Scottish covenanters in Ulster and in Scotland. Antrim had secured the support of many of the cashiered officers. The supreme council, baulking at confronting Antrim, instead arrested O'More and Philip Mac Maolmhuire O'Reilly for inciting the earl. The council described them as &#145;men of their own disposition turbulent and much taken &hellip; with the condition of troublesome times&#146;  (cited in Ohlmeyer, 141).<br>
<br>There is a gap in the record of O'More's activities for the years 1645&#150;7, which, intriguingly, corresponds to the service of the confederate Catholic expeditionary force in Scotland, led by Alasdair Mac Colla Mac Donnell. O'More offered to lead a regiment of 1500 men to Scotland, but his name is not included in the list of officers who embarked.<br>
<br>By 1648 the confederate Catholics had split into opposing Ormondist and clericalist parties, supporting and opposing, respectively, a royalist alliance. Owen Roe O'Neill opposed the alliance and employed O'More on his &#145;cabinet council&#146;  (Gilbert, 2.21) and as an envoy. In early 1649 O'More fell out of favour with O'Neill after acting as an intermediary with Ormond. According to the rabidly clericalist author of the <span class="italic">Aphorismical Discovery</span>, O'More, &#145;a well spoken gentleman &hellip; though no martial man&#146;  (ibid.), seized the opportunity to curry favour with Ormond by giving unfounded assurances to both parties of the other's willingness to seek an accommodation.<br>
<br>In August 1650 the Catholic synod of Jamestown repudiated royalist authority and attempted to reassert control over the faltering Irish resistance to the Cromwellian reconquest. O'More was chosen as one of three Leinster representatives on a proposed new Catholic confederation, and also served as a colonel in the reconstituted Leinster army. In June 1651 the army moved to Connaught belatedly to defend the Shannon line. Between November and December 1652 O'More was serving in one of the last royalist outposts, Inishbofin. He escaped to co. Donegal before the final surrender of the island early in 1653.<br>
<br>O'More was exempted from pardon for life or estate by the 1652 Cromwellian <span class="roman">Act of Settlement</span>, and, if apprehended, he would certainly have been executed. However, the authorities believed that he had escaped abroad and died. According to a family memoir, he worked in co. Donegal as a herd for a time, under an assumed identity, until his employer caught him reading a book behind a hedge and dismissed him, saying that he needed a herd, not a scholar. From there he moved to south co. Armagh. Corroboration that he lived for some years afterwards comes from the affidavits of two Irishmen in Madrid in September and October 1666, when Daniel O'Neill (husband of O'More's daughter Leonor) was made knight of the military order of Calatrava. The later of the two affidavits stated that the deponent &#145;receives letters regularly from Leonor's father, Rory O Moore, who is at present living in Ireland&#146;  (Walsh, 137). After the Restoration, Rory O'More's eldest son, Charles, recovered most of the Carbury estate through the court of claims.<br>
