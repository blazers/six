<span class="headword">Beverley,  Robert</span>  (1667/8&#150;1722), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born in Middlesex county, Virginia, the son of Major Robert Beverley (1635&#150;1687), planter, and his second wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Keeble (1637&#150;1678). He was educated in England, probably at Beverley grammar school, Yorkshire. In 1696 he married Ursula Byrd (1680?&#150;1698), the sister of the landowner and diarist, William Byrd. The couple had one son, William (1695/6&#150;1760), before Ursula's early death. Both his father and his older half-brother, Peter Beverley (1687&#150;1729), had served as clerk of the Virginia house of burgesses, a position Robert achieved in 1696. When, two years later, the statehouse was consumed by fire, Beverley saved many of its records, which he transcribed and arranged. He sailed to England in 1703 to appeal to the privy council against a legal decision. He lost the appeal, but spent his time writing <span class="italic">The History and Present State of Virginia</span> which was published anonymously &#145;by an Indian&#146; in London in 1705. Though he claimed in the preface to the second edition that he was inspired to write the <span class="italic">History</span> to correct the numerous errors in the account of Virginia in John Oldmixon's <span class="italic">British Colonies in America</span>, Beverley may have planned to write a history and probably brought materials with him, perhaps spending some time writing on the voyage to England. In the same preface he also identified the ignorance of and prejudice against America that he encountered in England as a motive behind the <span class="italic">History</span>. In truth, his father probably prejudiced him against the English authorities after the privy council barred him from office in 1678; the elder Robert Beverley had none the less fulfilled various government roles until 1 August 1686, when James II commanded that he be barred from all civil offices.<br>
<br>Beverley's <span class="italic">History &hellip; of Virginia</span>, one of the most outspoken books of Americanism before the War of Independence, satirized the &#145;Rapacious and Arbitrary&#146; English governors and objected to the &#145;heavy Impositions&#146; put upon the American colonies by the English. Throughout his study Beverley celebrated Virginia's history and laws, featuring stories of early Virginia&#151;among them the Lost Colony, Pocahontas saving Captain John Smith, Virginia's settlement by cavaliers, and the laziness of the ordinary southerner&#151;which became standard features of American history. In his personal life, he eschewed English material culture. Visiting Beverley's plantation on 14 July 1715, the Revd John Fontaine marvelled that he had &#145;no curtains&#146; on the windows and that &#145;instead of cane chairs he hath stools made of wood, and lives upon the product of his land&#146;, which included his own vineyards and wine.<br>
<br>In addition to criticizing English culture, Beverley also celebrated American nature. Virginian planters continuously have<blockquote>their Eyes &hellip; ravished with the Beauties of naked Nature. Their Ears are Serenaded with the perpetual murmur of Brooks, and the thorow-base which the Wind plays, when it wantons through the Trees; the merry Birds too, join their pleasing Notes to this rural Consort, especially the Mock-birds. (Beverley, 298)</blockquote>Despite the originality and sincerity of its sentiments, large parts of the <span class="italic">History</span> derived from existing sources. Much of Beverley's supposedly first-hand information concerning Native Americans actually comes from Captain John Smith, most of his technical detail on Virginia's natural history was taken from John Banister, while a good deal of material on the government and present state of the colony comes from a manuscript by three Virginians, published later also as <span class="italic">The History and Present State of Virginia</span> (1727); and some information probably came from a manuscript history of Virginia by his brother-in-law, William Byrd of Westover. Nevertheless, Beverley's prose made his <span class="italic">History</span> enjoyable and he often gave even the borrowed material his own interpretation. Thus, in a series of chapters devoted to the Virginia Indians, he obliquely advanced the merits of deism. Moreover, the <span class="italic">History</span> proved popular, with four French printings between 1707 and 1718 and a second English edition in 1722.<br>
<br>In 1716 Beverley accompanied the Virginian lieutenant-governor, Alexander Spotswood, on the fabled 63-man exploration over the Blue Ridge Mountains to the Shenandoah. He also served in the Virginia house of burgesses. In 1722 Beverley brought out <span class="italic">An Abridgement of the Public Laws of Virginia</span> (2nd edn, 1728), which celebrated Spotswood in the dedication. He died on 21 April 1722, aged fifty-four, at his plantation, Beverley Park, King and Queen county, Virginia, and was survived by his son, William.<br>
