<span class="headword">Byng,  John</span>, fifth Viscount Torrington  (1743&#150;1813), <span class="occ">diarist</span>, was born on 18 February 1743, the younger son (there were no daughters) of George Byng, third Viscount Torrington (<i>bap</i>. 1701, <i>d</i>. 1750), of Southill, Bedfordshire, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1759), daughter of Lyonel Daniel of Clapham, Surrey. Both his parents died while he was still young. He was nephew to the unfortunate Admiral John Byng (1704&#150;1757), who was executed in 1757. Byng followed his brother, George, to Westminster School, but was, as he wrote, primarily &#145;Train'd up to glory&#146;  (<span class="italic">Torrington Diaries</span>, 1.344), that is, to follow his grandfather, father, and uncle in some form of military or naval career. He was page of honour to George II; from January 1760 cornet of the Royal Horse Guards; from March 1762 captain of the 58th foot (a nominal appointment, this regiment then being in America); then, from August of that year, lieutenant and captain of the 1st foot guards (Grenadier Guards). He served with both horse and foot in Germany during the Seven Years' War, an experience to which he often subsequently referred.<br>
<br>In 1776 Byng was made lieutenant-colonel. Not being detached for service in America, he probably spent most of the next few years in London. Financial troubles marred these years: fear of arrest for debt probably motivated his flight to the continent in November 1777; his resignation from the army in May 1780 may likewise have been prompted by such troubles. He accepted minor administrative office under Lord North's ministry, then from 1782 to 1799 served as a commissioner of stamps. He succeeded his brother, George, as viscount on 14 December 1812, but held the title for only a few weeks before his own death.<br>
<br>In his lifetime an obscure figure (he was ignored by contemporary obituarists), Byng became known in the twentieth century through the publication of his <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, journals of horseback tours through England and Wales. Byng did not chronicle his earlier travels; it is known from the diary of William Windham that he and Byng toured the midlands and north in 1774. Only in 1780 was Byng &#145;first seized with this journalizing frenzy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Torrington Diaries</span>, 1.104). His writings fill twenty-four manuscript volumes, spanning the years 1781&#150;94. Byng wrote partly to enhance and prolong his pleasure in &#145;tourism&#146;, but also to preserve details of &#145;the manners of our travelling, the rates of our provisions; and of castles, churches and houses&#146;  (ibid., 1.249). His diaries&#151;particularly the manuscript originals, which are scattered with engraved prints (the picture postcards of the day)&#151;do serve this function, but are most valuable as a record of individual sensibility. Byng pertinaciously sought out ruined castles and abbeys&#151;relics, in his view, of an age in which spiritual and temporal lords had accepted duties of stewardship they had since abnegated. Though generally critical of his own era, Byng none the less extended qualified sympathy to developments that served ends he valued: to Methodism, inasmuch as it instilled &#145;wholesome morals&#146;  (ibid., 1.141), and to spreading industry, inasmuch as it provided employment, though he worried that, like religion, which had &#145;overstretch'd her power &hellip; and was blown up &hellip; the cotton trade &hellip; may crack!&#146;  (ibid., 3.114).<br>
<br>On 3 March 1767 Byng married Bridget (<i>bap</i>. 1748, <i>d</i>. 1823), daughter of Commodore Arthur Forrest (<i>d</i>. 1770) and his wife, Frederica. The marriage produced five sons and eight daughters, one of whom died young. Three of the sons followed military or naval careers, with two attaining the rank of admiral. Their youngest son was known to Regency society by the sobriquet Poodle Byng.<br>
<br>Although sometimes morose and tetchy, particularly when subjected to the formalities and <i>longueurs</i> of polite society, or when contemplating his reduced fortunes, Byng had yet a fund of good spirits, and endeavoured &#145;to be pleased with the world, and content with its comforts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Torrington Diaries</span>, 1.205). He wrote of himself that he had a &#145;heart full of blood &amp; quick of impression&#146;  (ibid., 1.115), was &#145;hasty of determination&#146;, and &#145;leaky of secrets&#146;  (ibid., 1.135). According to his wife, he had generally &#145;a pleased or lively look&#146;  (ibid., 1.xxxviii). John Byng died on 8 January 1813 at Tenterden Street, Hanover Square, London.<br>
