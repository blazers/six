</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Collier,  Jeremy</span>  (1650&#150;1726), <span class="occ">anti-theatrical polemicist and bishop of the nonjuring Church of England</span>, was born on 23 September 1650 at Stow-cum-Quy, Cambridgeshire, son of Jeremy Collier, a fellow of St John's College, Cambridge, under the Commonwealth, and at the time of Collier's birth master of Aldenham School, Hertfordshire, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith, of Stow-cum-Quy. He was educated at the free school at Ipswich, where his father became master in 1663. He was admitted sizar at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, on 6 June 1666 and again on 10 April 1669, where he graduated BA in 1673 and MA in 1676. He was ordained deacon on 24 September 1676 and priest on 24 February 1678. He was chaplain to Mary Sackville, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bagot, countess of Dorset, at Knole House in Kent from 1677 to 1679 and rector of Ampton, in Suffolk, from 1679 to 1685. In 1685 he resigned his benefice and moved to London. There, according to the entry in the <span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span>, believed to be based on notes by Collier, he obtained a lecturer's appointment at Gray's Inn, but there is no record at the inn of his having held the post. If he did he was displaced in 1689 when he failed to swear allegiance to William III and Mary II on the ground that his oaths to James II were still valid.<h2>
<a name="Anonjuringcontroversialist"></a>A nonjuring controversialist</h2>Collier had already published two of his sermons in 1686 and 1687 and he now began to publish pamphlets and tracts on political issues, especially on the question of the validity of the succession of William and Mary to the throne. In his <span class="italic">The Desertion Discussed. In a Letter to a Country Gentleman</span> he controverted arguments published by Gilbert Burnet in <span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Present State of Affairs</span>. Collier's pamphlet advanced a favourite argument of the supporters of James II in 1689, that since the king had left London under duress and in fear of his life his departure should not be construed as an abdication and that, therefore, though the king was temporarily absent, the throne was not vacant. William was consequently, in Collier's view, a usurper and his landing at Torbay constituted an armed rebellion against the civil power, which violated the Restoration Anglican doctrine of non-resistance. Collier was seized by the government and committed to several months' imprisonment in Newgate. He was, however, finally released without trial and during the next three years wrote several further pamphlets opposing the revolution settlement in church and state, including <span class="italic">Vindiciae juris regii</span>, published in 1689, where he argued that security in the kingdom could come only from divine hereditary right, and <span class="italic">Dr Sherlock's &#145;Case of Allegiance&#146; Considered with some Remarks on his Vindication</span>, in 1691, replying to William Sherlock's justification of his decision to abandon the nonjuror position and take the oaths to William and Mary in 1690. Other pamphlets discussed the nature of a <i>de facto</i> monarch and the duties of clergy towards bishops who occupied the sees of nonjurors. Collier's writings argued that the Church of England was in schism from the true church, represented by the nonjurors, who in Collier's view came as close as possible to the practices of the early church and maintained the independence of the spiritual order and its representatives from the state. The civil order was an expression of the divine will; in collaborating with the revolution of 1688 and concurring in the removal of James II churchmen were rejecting the structure of Christian society and opening the doors to moral as well as political disorder.<br>
<br>In 1692 Collier was again briefly imprisoned on allegations that he and another nonjuring clergyman, George Newton, had visited Romney Marsh with the intention of opening communications with James II. They were interrogated by Daniel Finch, second earl of Nottingham, secretary of state, but no solid evidence could be produced and the two clergymen were released on bail. Collier then surrendered to the authorities, as giving bail implied his acceptance of the authority of William and Mary's courts. During his brief imprisonment in the king's bench that ensued, he wrote another pamphlet justifying his position, entitled <span class="italic">The Case of Giving Bail to a Pretended Authority</span>. Collier was released from the king's bench on the application of his friends. His early pamphlets had been written on the assumption that the revolution, as a rebellion against divine authority, would lead to the collapse of civil order, which would swiftly lead to the restoration of James II as the only means of guaranteeing social stability, but <span class="italic">A Perswasive to Consideration</span>, published in 1693, accepted that William's rule was probably permanent and called on James's supporters to &#145;glory in Persecutions and despise Contempt&#146;  (Hopes, 161). In 1694 and 1695 he published his <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span>, which in later editions from 1697 was called <span class="italic">Essays upon Several Moral Subjects</span>. One of the essays, &#145;Upon the office of a chaplain&#146;, demonstrated Collier's pugnacious sense of his own independence and of the proper independence of the church. The essay was probably influenced by Collier's experience as a chaplain at Knole. In it he inveighs against the attitude of members of the aristocracy who treated their chaplains as domestic servants. He intended to enhance the self-respect of chaplains as well as remind their employers that churchmen should not be expected to be servile.<br>
<br>On 3 April 1696, when Sir John Friend and Sir William Parkyns were to be executed for their parts in the assassination plot against William III, Collier, with two other nonjuring clergymen, Shadrach Cook and William Snatt, accompanied them to Tyburn and gave them absolution by laying on of hands, as Collier argued was the practice of the early church. Since neither Friend nor Parkyns had publicly repented of their roles in the plan to murder the king, the clear implication of the absolution ceremony was that the two prisoners were being absolved of the general human sins of a lifetime, of which their plot against the king was not part. Collier and his colleagues thereby gave their tacit approval to the plot by demonstrating that they did not consider it sinful. Collier, to avoid possible arrest, was compelled to go into hiding. His house in London was raided by the authorities on 6 April and papers and documents were seized. This did not, however, prevent him from publishing <span class="italic">Defence of the Absolution</span> on 9 April. On 25 April he published a second pamphlet replying to a published declaration signed by Thomas Tenison, archbishop of Canterbury, and John Sharp, archbishop of York, and twelve bishops, that Collier and his two colleagues offered &#145;an open affront to the Laws both of Church and State&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Declaration</span>, 11). Cook and Snatt were tried on a charge of absolving traitors on 2 July, were found guilty, and released. Collier evaded arrest and was outlawed. For six or seven months he remained in hiding, but gradually during 1697 he drifted back into normal life without any further punitive measures being taken against him, although he remained an outlaw for the rest of his life.<h2>
<a name="Colliersattacksonthetheatre"></a>Collier's attacks on the theatre</h2>Collier's concern for the threat posed to the moral order of society was widely shared by churchmen influenced like Collier by late seventeenth-century study of the primitive church. The religious societies, the first initiated by Anthony Horneck in London in 1678, and the societies for the reformation of manners, which sprang up in London during the 1690s, sought to provide the moral discipline which many high-churchmen felt the church should be empowered to enforce upon the laity. The involvement of dissenters in the societies for the reformation of manners showed that concern about the decline of moral standards was not limited to churchmen anxious to demonstrate the Church of England's proximity to the ideals of the primitive church. However, the movement was a divided one, as high-churchmen remained suspicious of the involvement of dissenters in the societies for the reformation of manners, and disagreed about whether the societies existed to thank God for his mercy in delivering England from Catholicism in 1688, or (as would have been consistent with Collier's point of view) to combat the collapse of the moral order consequent upon William's invasion. Outside the clergy and the religious societies there was widespread anxiety about profane speech and scandalous behaviour, which included criticism of the stage for providing examples of immoral conduct. The government of William III indicated that it accepted this argument when in 1697 the lord chamberlain issued orders against the &#145;Prophaneness and Immorality&#146; of the theatre.<br>
<br>For Collier the condition of the stage provided the most telling example of the moral anarchy that he had predicted would follow the rejection of James II and the establishment of a government that, as it was founded upon rebellion against the civil and moral order, was constitutionally incapable of guaranteeing such order. Collier must have been aware that his campaign against the stage was one with which a larger number of readers would identify compared to his intellectual advocacy of the restoration of James II. In his anti-theatre writings there is a vigour, a verbal resilience, a clarity and directness of invective which is absent from his other moralizing, solemn pieces. This is clearest in his justly famous first contribution on the subject, <span class="italic">A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage, together with the Sense of Antiquity upon this Argument</span>, which appeared in 1698. Its thunderous periods ring with a sense of the joy of battle. Altogether, between 1698 and 1708 Collier published six pieces of writing on this theme: some of them (such as <span class="italic">A Letter to a Lady Concerning the New Playhouse</span>, 1708) are only a few pages long, whereas the original <span class="italic">Short View</span> ran to 268 pages and his <span class="italic">A Second Defence of the &#145;Short View&#146;</span> (1700) is 142 pages long.<br>
<br>Collier claimed in <span class="italic">A Short View</span> that his objections were not to the theatre itself, but to particular practical matters of behaviour, such as obscene language, oaths, blasphemy, and sexual innuendo. He regarded these as corrupting, whether or not they were actually intended to corrupt, although he implied that there was malicious intent in many cases. Each chapter dealt with a particular concern: the first was headed &#145;The immodesty of the stage&#146;, the second, &#145;The profaneness of the stage&#146;, the third &#145;The clergy abused by the stage&#146;, and the fourth &#145;The stage-poets make their principal persons vicious and reward them at the end of the play&#146;. About all these matters of social and religious observance he went into great detail, quoting multiple examples from many contemporary plays to illustrate the various offences about which he complained, and here and there excusing himself from giving chapter and verse because of the &#145;smuttiness&#146; of the language used in that particular passage. At the opening of the book he proposed:<blockquote>The business of Plays is to recommend Virtue and discountenance Vice; to shew the Uncertainty of humane greatness, the suddain Turns of Fate, and the Unhappy Conclusions of Violence and Injustice: 'Tis to expose the Singularities of Pride and Fancy, to make Folly and Falsehood contemptible and to bring every thing that is Ill Under Infamy and Neglect. (Collier, <span class="italic">A Short View</span>, 1)</blockquote>The playwrights, Collier argued, were setting out to turn this purpose against itself. God had intended women for modesty but instead female characters were frequently depicted as aggressive and lewd, particularly those of high social status. Noblemen were presented as competing in debauchery when their place in the civil order demanded that they be presented as virtuous and responsible. Collier found that deceitful characters often triumphed, being rewarded with material prosperity and promotion in the social hierarchy, when drama that reflected moral truth should have cast them low. He thought the language of the stage was lewd and blasphemous, alluding to sexual acts and casually invoking heaven and hell, reducing people to the level of ignorant beasts. He was also aggrieved by dramatic portrayals of the clergy, who too frequently appeared as fools when they should be worthy of respect as the maintainers of religion and virtue. To Collier it was essential that the stage should portray a society that respected the alliance between social rank and virtue in both the civil and religious spheres. If it could not then it was questionable whether the theatre should continue.<h2>
<a name="CollierversusDryden"></a>Collier versus Dryden</h2>Although there were several contemporary dramatists whose works presented Collier with examples of immorality John Dryden in particular articulated a creed that called all Collier's principles into question. Collier's opposition to Dryden underlies his general dislike of the theatre. Dryden had, thirty years before Collier wrote <span class="italic">A Short View</span>, expressed in its most perfect form in <span class="italic">An Essay of Dramatick Poesie</span> and <span class="italic">A Defence of an Essay</span>, both published in 1668, the essence of the aesthetic dilemma which the single-minded Collier resolved by overlooking. Including but not confining his definition to stage poetry, Dryden, in the &#145;Defence&#146;, wrote: &#145;I am satisfied if it cause delight: for delight is the chief, if not the only end of Poesie: instruction can be admitted but in the second place, for Poesie only instructs as it delights&#146;  (Dryden, &#145;A Defence&#146;, 5&#150;6). Collier argued of Dryden's work:<blockquote>The strength of his Defence lies in this choice maxim, that the Chief End of Comedy is Delight. He Questions whether Instruction has any thing to do in Comedy; If it has, he is sure 'tis no more than its secondary end; For the business of the Poet is to make you laugh. (Collier, <span class="italic">A Short View</span>, 156)</blockquote>Collier was paraphrasing from Dryden's preface to &#145;An Evening's Love&#146;, published in 1671, where Dryden argued that &#145;Comedy is not so much oblig'd to the punishment of the faults which it represents, as Tragedy&#146;  (Dryden, preface to &#145;An Evening's Love&#146;, 209) on the ground that &#145;the faults and vices are but the sallies of youth, and the frailties of human nature, and not premeditated crimes&#146;  (ibid.). For Collier youthful folly was not an excuse, and theatre existed to correct, not indulge, human weakness. Dryden, introducing the concept of delight as aesthetic appreciation in the &#145;Defence&#146; was concerned with the particular kind of writing best suited to tragedy, and not comedy. Collier conflated the argument taken from the &#145;Defence&#146; with that from the preface to &#145;An Evening's Love&#146; and equated delight with laughter (a connection Dryden never made) and therefore in Collier's estimation with frivolity and triviality. Nevertheless, though he misunderstands&#151;or pretends to&#151;Collier, reading Dryden's <span class="italic">A Defence of an Essay</span>, recognizes a most dangerous opponent&#151;a man whose life is guided by a God who is to Collier a total stranger. For Dryden:<blockquote>The employment of a Poet, is like that of a curious Gunsmith, or Watchmaker: the Iron or Silver is not his own; but they are the least part of that which gives the value: the price lyes wholly in the workmanship. (Dryden, preface to &#145;An Evening's Love&#146;, 212)</blockquote>The extent to which the workmanship matches, measures up to, and enhances the intrinsic beauty of the iron or the silver is the gauge by which aesthetic delight is judged, said Dryden. But Collier regarded words, however or wherever deployed, as instruments by which to tell people what they should believe and how they should behave.<h2>
<a name="CriticsofColliersShortView"></a>Critics of Collier's Short View</h2>Dryden never published a pamphlet of rebuttal or recrimination against Collier, but did occasionally refer ironically to him in other places. In an epilogue that Dryden wrote for a revival of John Vanbrugh's adaptation of Francis Beaumont's and John Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Pilgrim</span>, in 1700, Dryden managed to get in a sly comment on Collier's allegiance to the cause of divine right monarchy and his assumption that the restoration of James II would improve society's morals:<blockquote>
<div>Perhaps the Parson stretch'd a point too far<br>
</div>
<div>When with our Theatres he wag'd a war.<br>
</div>
<div>He tells you, That this very Moral Age<br>
</div>
<div>Receiv'd the first Infection from the Stage.<br>
</div>
<div>But sure, a banisht Court, with Lewdness fraught,<br>
</div>
<div>The Seeds of open Vice returning brought.<br>
</div> (Dryden, epilogue to <span class="italic">The Pilgrim</span>, 265)</blockquote>And in the opening passage of &#145;Cymon and Iphigenia&#146; Dryden wrote:<blockquote>
<div>The World will think that what we loosely write,<br>
</div>
<div>Tho' now arraign'd, he read with some delight;<br>
</div>
<div>Because he seems to chew the Cud again<br>
</div>
<div>When his broad comment makes the Text too plain<br>
</div>
<div>And teaches more in one explaining page<br>
</div>
<div>Than all the double Meanings of the Stage.<br>
</div>
<div> 
<br>
</div>
<div>What needs he Paraphrase on what we mean?<br>
</div>
<div>We were at worst but Wanton; he's Obscene.<br>
</div> (Dryden, &#145;Cymon and Iphigenia&#146;, 513)</blockquote>The <span class="italic">Short View</span> provoked immediate replies from four of the playwrights whom Collier had attacked: William Congreve, John Vanbrugh, Thomas D'Urfey, and John Dennis, all of whom published pamphlets before the end of 1698 defending their own plays and ridiculing Collier's arguments. Of these the first three tended to be petulant and to rely on scorn and a tone of broad mockery. Dennis, however, in <span class="italic">The Usefulness of the Stage to the Happiness of Mankind, to Government, and to Religion</span>, took Collier's statements one by one and suggested that their passionate pronouncements often failed to take historical and social fact into account. Dennis argued that it was not the theatre that had corrupted society but, as Dryden would imply in his epilogue to <span class="italic">The Pilgrim</span>, the licentious court of Charles II. Theatre educated the public against superstition and the pretensions of priests.<br>
<br>Another critic, the journalist George Ridpath, took an opposite path, extending Collier's argument to suggest that the stage was wholly evil and had always been so. Ridpath's <span class="italic">The Stage Condemn'd</span>, which also appeared in 1698, gave a complete history of the stage from earliest times, purporting to show that the most responsible opinion in every age was always against all theatrical representations. He also included the entire text of Inigo Jones's and William Davenant's court masque <span class="italic">Britannia triumphans</span>, performed before Charles I on twelfth night, 1637, which fell on a Sunday, so the reader &#145;might see what sort of Religion or Evening Sermons, it was that the Court and Laud's Faction of the Church then aimed at&#146;  (Ridpath, 30) and question the reputed piety of Charles I. Ridpath both articulated a wider objection to and condemnation of the stage than Collier, and implicated Collier, a nonjuror and Jacobite, as part of the movement that encouraged the immorality of the stage in the first place.<br>
<br>Collier replied to his critics with <span class="italic">A Defence of the &#145;Short View of the Profaneness and Immorality of the English Stage&#146;</span>, which appeared in 1699. In the following year Collier published <span class="italic">A Second Defence of the &#145;Short View of the Profaneness and Immorality of the English Stage&#146;</span>, in reply to James Drake's <span class="italic">Antient and Modern Stages Survey'd</span> (1699). The <span class="italic">Second Defence</span> introduced no new arguments against the stage, but sought to discredit Drake by finding flaws in Drake's history and his translations from Latin and Greek authors.<br>
<br>Perhaps the most reasonable, logical, and best argued refutation of Collier was Edward Filmer's <span class="italic">A Defence of Plays, or, The Stage Vindicated</span>, published in 1707 but written at some point before Filmer's death in 1703. Filmer's book refutes Collier chapter by chapter; his concluding statements condemn Collier's methods and intentions, alleging that he had manipulated the controversy to keep it alive, and always intended to destroy, not reform, the theatre. Apparently unaware that Filmer was dead, Collier replied in 1708 with <span class="italic">A Further Vindication of the &#145;Short View&#146; &hellip; in which the Objections of &#145;A Defence of Plays&#146; are Considered</span>, which offered no new ideas but forcefully reiterated his original case.<h2>
<a name="InfluenceofAShortView"></a>Influence of A Short View</h2>
<span class="italic">A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage</span> was widely approved and immensely influential in and beyond Collier's lifetime. Even Filmer conceded that it was &#145;A Piece! That has been receiv'd by the World with a general Applause, and stood the Shock of some of the greatest Wits of the Age&#146;  (Filmer, 1&#150;2). A presbyterian alderman of London and MP for Reading, Sir Owen Buckingham, gave Collier 20 guineas as a reward for the book. Collier was aware that he had found an audience, and his defences of <span class="italic">A Short View</span> were usually shorter and more pointed summaries of his arguments that could be easily digested by his readership. Collier's warnings seemed confirmed when new productions of <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> and <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> in 1703 were followed by the great storm of 26&#150;7 November that year. Collier published <span class="italic">Mr Collier's Dissuasive from the Playhouse, in a Letter to a Person of Quality</span>, in the wake of the storm. The Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge established a committee to supervise the regulation of the playhouses and draw up reasons to recommend their suspension. They also bought 200 copies of the <span class="italic">Dissuasive</span> for distribution outside churches.<br>
<br>Before the end of the first decade of the eighteenth century both Richard Steele and Colley Cibber had publicly declared that they approved of Collier's attack and both of them claimed that their own plays were influenced by Collier's views. Steele went so far as to say of <span class="italic">The Lying Lover</span>, of 1703,<blockquote>Mr. Collier had, about the time Wherein this was published, written against the Immorality of the Stage. I was (as far as I durst for fear of witty Men, upon whom he had been too severe) a great Admirer of his Work and took it into my head to write a Comedy in the Severity he required. (Steele, &#145;Mr Steele's apology for himself and his writings&#146;, 311)</blockquote>There can be no doubt that Collier's expressed views influenced the emergence of the sentimental or genteel comedy which, with a few exceptions, dominated English theatre writing until well into the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Collier clinches his argument, from his point of view, by making it clear that he intends to be no respecter of persons: &#145;As for Shakespear, he is too guilty to make an Evidence: But I think he gains not much by his Misbehaviour; He has commonly Plautus's Fate, where there is most Smut there is least Sense&#146;  (Collier, <span class="italic">A Short View</span>, 50). Here again Collier's fingerprints can be discerned on the eighteenth-century adaptations of Shakespeare by Colley Cibber, Nahum Tate, and others.<h2>
<a name="Laterworks"></a>Later works</h2>Collier's publications subsequent to <span class="italic">A Short View</span> that were not part of his campaign against the stage were designed both to furnish him with income and to further his case for the independence of the church's authority from that of the civil power, as well as to emphasize the perfection of the early church as an ideal. <span class="italic">The Great Historical, Geographical, Genealogical and Poetical Dictionary</span> appeared in 1701; a supplement followed in 1705 and an appendix in 1721. The <span class="italic">Dictionary</span> was translated largely from Louis Mor&eacute;ri's <span class="italic">Grand dictionnaire historique</span>, first published in Lyons in 1674 and revised in Amsterdam by Jean Le Clerc in 1691, but it contained new material on English and church history from Collier. He did not write entries dealing with events after 1688, presumably because his Jacobite sympathies would conflict with the interest of the publisher. Thomas Hearne dismissed the work as inaccurate, but it sold well. Meanwhile Collier also published <span class="italic">An Ecclesiastical History of Great Britain</span> in two volumes published in 1708 and 1714. This was better regarded by Hearne and by other scholars and was still thought of as a valuable church history by William Hunt in his entry on Collier for the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> in 1887. The <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical History</span> derived its constitutional history from the work of Robert Brady, who had been master of Gonville and Caius when Collier was an undergraduate, and who had argued that the English constitution was not handed down from the Anglo-Saxon period or earlier, but instead rested on the conquest of William I. Collier sought to demonstrate, in contrast to the comparatively recent origins of the civil power, &#145;the continued existence in England of the bearers of the divine commission, free both from papal and royal interference&#146;  (Hopes, 171). The nonjurors were presented as the representatives of an unchanging ecclesiastical tradition handed down from the early church. The <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical History</span> brought accusations that Collier was a Roman Catholic sympathizer from Gilbert Burnet and others, but Collier never sought union with the Church of Rome, and continued to reject its doctrine and claim to supremacy.<h2>
<a name="Nonjuringbishop"></a>Nonjuring bishop</h2>By the second decade of the eighteenth century Collier seems to have become established officiating to a small congregation in an upper room in Broad Street, London, perhaps assisted by Samuel Carte, brother of the historian Thomas Carte. He rejected approaches during Anne's reign that encouraged him to take the oaths and rejoin the established church, and supported the continuation of the nonjuring episcopate. On 14 May 1713 he was consecrated a bishop of the nonjuring Church of England, alongside Nathaniel Spinckes and Samuel Hawes, by George Hickes, nonjuring bishop of Thetford, and the Scottish episcopalian bishops James Gadderar and Archibald Campbell. Collier and his colleagues were &#145;catholic bishops&#146;, ministering to nonjurors without regard to diocesan borders. Hickes died in December 1715, and on 23 July 1716 Collier was elected his successor as primus of the nonjuring communion. By this time he had probably married Cecelia Deacon (<i>fl</i>. 1697&#150;1733), widow of William Deacon (<i>d</i>. 1706), a mariner, sometime housekeeper to Hickes, and mother of the nonjuring churchman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7379/', "Thomas Deacon (1697&#150;1753)")</script>, whom Collier had ordained in March. A letter from Archibald Campbell on Collier's death reveals that Collier had been married before, but no details of his first wife are known.<br>
<br>A project of the nonjurors that Collier took forward from 1716 was the scheme for union with the Eastern Orthodox churches in the hope that this would further perfect the nonjuring Church of England as the descendant of the primitive church. A concordat was prepared in consultation with Arsenius, archbishop of Thebais, a representative of the Egyptian church. The Russian emperor, Peter the Great, acted as an intermediary between the English nonjurors and the Greek, Russian, and Egyptian Orthodox churches. The nonjurors were willing to accept patriarchal authority, with Jerusalem as their mother see, thereby avoiding recognition of Rome as the patriarchate of the West, but were reluctant to accept transubstantiation and the invocation of the saints. Following the death of Peter the Great in 1725, negotiations ceased. By this time the nonjurors were themselves divided by an internal schism.<br>
<br>Collier had shared with Hickes a preference for the eucharist as prescribed by the 1549 prayer book over that of 1662. Collier sought to introduce a revised form of this service influenced by his study of early Christian writers. The new liturgy would have introduced four usages not known in the 1662 prayer book; water was to be mixed with communion wine, prayers for the church were to encompass the faithful departed as well as the church militant on earth, a prayer was to be said for the descent of the holy ghost on the consecrated elements, and a further prayer would offer the consecrated elements to God as symbols of Christ's body and blood. Despite opposition from most of the nonjuring clergy, who were supported in exile by James Stuart, the Old Pretender, whom most nonjurors regarded as the rightful King James III, Collier imposed what he referred to as &#145;Primitive and Catholic Usages&#146;  (Overton, 294) on 20 December 1717, and from then on he regarded those nonjurors who adhered to the prayer book of 1662, the non-usagers, as schismatic. Collier led a pamphlet war with his critics: <span class="italic">Reasons for Restoring Some Prayers and Directions as they Stood in the First English Reformed Liturgy</span> appeared in 1717 and reached its fourth edition the next year, when Collier also published a new service book for the use of his division of the nonjurors. The usagers came to predominate among the nonjurors, helped by respect for Collier and his scholarship, which was superior to that of the leader of the non-usagers, Nathaniel Spinckes.<br>
<br>Collier continued to publish despite declining health, and from about 1718 the nonjuring scholar Samuel Jebb served as his librarian. <span class="italic">Several Discourses upon Practical Subjects</span> appeared in 1725 and <span class="italic">God not the Author of Evil</span> in 1726. He was reported in 1725 to be &#145;very poor in his old age&#146;  (Self, 11), a condition blamed on the demands of Mrs Collier, who was alleged to aspire to govern the nonjuring church. Collier remained passionately sincere and unwaveringly true to his principles. Dogma and doctrine he held, but, in the last analysis, not wisdom. Worn down by gall-bladder disease, he died in London on 26 April 1726 and was buried in the churchyard of St Pancras, London, on 29 April; he was survived by his widow and stepson.<br>
