<span class="headword">Wensley,  Frederick Porter</span>  (1865&#150;1949), <span class="occ">police officer</span>, was born at The Pigmarket, Taunton, Somerset, on 28 March 1865, the son of George Wensley, journeyman shoemaker, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Porter. By 1881 the family had moved to London where, aged sixteen, he worked as a telegraph messenger. He joined the Metropolitan Police as a constable on 16 January 1888. After a brief, rudimentary training, he was posted to the L (Lambeth) division and then in 1891 to the H (Whitechapel) division. While a constable in Whitechapel he married, on 3 August 1893, Laura Elizabeth (1869&#150;1943), daughter of William Martin, fruiterer; they had a daughter and two sons. Baulked initially by the local detective inspector, who refused to recommend him, Wensley was not admitted to the CID as a detective constable until October 1895. When the normal rule was for those promoted to be transferred to another division, Wensley stayed at Whitechapel not only on promotion to detective sergeant but also to detective inspector and detective chief inspector. In a career materially helped (following a chance meeting at Leman Street police station) by the patronage of Melville Macnaghten, an Etonian parachuted into the force at senior level in 1888 who became assistant commissioner (crime), Wensley acquired an encyclopaedic knowledge of criminal life in one of the most impoverished, cosmopolitan, and violent areas of London.<br>
<br>An intelligent and determined officer whose underworld nickname was the Weasel, Wensley became increasingly noticed not only at Scotland Yard but also among the legal profession and the press in London. His career coincided with the rise for the first time of a mass circulation popular press for which crime stories were a staple of its inherent sensationalism, and murder cases with the threat of the death penalty the acme of fascination. His working life also saw the consolidation of the crime novel genre, for which his career offered a real-life epitome noticed even in the USA on his retirement. Dramatic early cases included a roof-top fight with and arrest of a man (Seaman) subsequently convicted of a double murder, the arrest and conviction of two brothers (Reuben) for the robbery and murder of a sailor, and later the pursuit of the Houndsditch murderers to the conclusion of the Sidney Street siege in January 1911.<br>
<br>Apart perhaps from the last case, Wensley first came prominently to national attention in 1911 in the case of Stinie Morrison, accused of the murder on Clapham Common of Leon Beron. Formally Wensley was not in charge of the case, for which his colleague Detective Inspector Alfred Ward at W (Wandsworth) division was responsible. Wensley became associated with the investigation when it was realized that the victim's normal habitat was Whitechapel, and was known to Wensley. It was Wensley who guessed who the particularly tall, good-looking suspect might be. Employing informants to track down the suspect&#151;Morrison&#151;and keeping observation on an address, Wensley arrested the man initially for failing to report a change of address after the recent completion of a sentence of penal servitude. This course was taken because there was then insufficient evidence to arrest Morrison for murder, yet he was known to carry arms. According to Wensley and other officers, Morrison, in an oral exchange initiated by him after his arrest, incriminated himself by assuming, without being told, that he was a murder suspect. Although there was other evidence pointing to Morrison's guilt and the jury did not take long to convict, doubts were cast on whether Morrison had not in fact been told he was a murder suspect. The police evidence was attacked, especially by a sensational late witness for the defence, a policeman who claimed his colleagues had lied. An inquiry into the police evidence by George Cave, a king's counsel and member of parliament, discredited the policeman and exonerated his colleagues. On the other hand, the feeling that the prosecution had not uncovered the whole story (the perpetrator had almost certainly acted with an accomplice), and that an error by the defence counsel that permitted Morrison's unsavoury criminal history to be disclosed might have influenced the jury, contributed to a court of criminal appeal's unenthusiastic dismissal of the appeal against conviction and sentence. In the face of doubts about Morrison's guilt or the extent of it, the home secretary, Winston Churchill, commuted Morrison's sentence to life imprisonment. An extraordinarily refractory prisoner, Morrison died in prison in 1921.<br>
<br>None of this impeded Wensley's rise in the service. According to his biographers, the Old Bailey prosecutor Richard Muir &#145;looked upon Wensley as one of the greatest detectives of all time&#146;  (Felstead, 306). Travers Humphreys, first a prosecutor and later a judge at the Old Bailey, had a similarly high opinion. Promoted detective chief inspector in 1912, Wensley was moved in 1916 to what was still a small CID headquarters at Scotland Yard. It was as a result of his proposals that force-wide detective supervision was increased by the creation from 1919 of four area detective superintendents supervising detectives throughout the four districts into which the Metropolitan Police was divided above divisional level. Along with Francis Carlin, Albert Hawkins, and Arthur Neil, Wensley was among the initial appointees to the &#145;big four&#146;, and was responsible for the whole of the East End and beyond. He was also associated with the establishment of the &#145;flying squad&#146;, a group of officers with special vehicles and a remit to pursue crime across divisional boundaries in response to the greater mobility and sophistication of criminals. In 1924 his pre-eminence was marked by his appointment (the first detective from the ranks since the 1880s) as a chief constable, the rank still then mostly reserved for men of superior social status appointed from outside the Metropolitan (or indeed any other) police service.<br>
<br>Despite his undoubted professional success Wensley has not been above criticism. His own memoirs fail directly to mention his appearance before the royal commission on the Metropolitan Police of 1908. There the petty crook Arthur Harding alleged that Wensley had sought to bring false charges against him. Wensley was cleared by the commission but his initial prevarication during examination about how well he knew Harding did not gain him credit. Harding's much later allegations that Wensley was in the pay of gamblers were never substantiated, nor were John Syme's similar insinuations made in the course of his relentless campaigns to overturn his own dismissal from the force. Against these points there is the fact that it was to Wensley that management turned in 1929 to root out racketeering in the Public Carriage Office. Assistant Commissioner Elliot had had his suspicions of the office confirmed when, during a visit, a licence applicant mistaking Elliot's role had sought to press a florin into his hand. Wensley mounted an operation that cleaned up the enterprise with cauterizing speed. He was also associated with the investigations that finally brought the corrupt Sergeant George Goddard to book earlier the same year in circumstances that suggested the existence of a much wider network of systematic corruption, in relation to which senior management had shown culpable complacency, and that too little had been done to challenge the unacceptable side of police <i>esprit de corps</i>.<br>
<br>Some criticism has fastened on Wensley's conduct of the Thompson and Bywaters case in 1922, partly perhaps because of a modern abhorrence of the death penalty. Edith Thompson's husband was stabbed to death by her much younger lover, Frederick Bywaters, when the husband and wife were walking home from a night out at the theatre. Wensley arranged for Edith (not knowing that Bywaters had been arrested) to see Bywaters as if by chance at the police station to which she had been taken. Taken by surprise, her exclamation on realizing that her lover had been arrested for the murder was alleged to show her complicity in the crime. With Bywaters she was convicted of murder and hanged in circumstances that have remained controversial because of the use of her exclaimed remarks against her and the prosecution's deployment of her passionate letters to Bywaters. To her supporters she was in effect hanged for adultery rather than murder, where her complicity was not satisfactorily established. In his autobiography, written when the case remained controversial, Wensley described the murder at some length, stressing its premeditated character, the relative youth of the victim, his wife's failure to assist him, and her later prevarications and lies.<br>
<br>Concentrating retrospectively on possible blemishes almost certainly does Wensley an injustice. He had to work within the standards of his times. In that context Wensley deserves every credit for epitomizing the growing professionalization of the police service in general and of the CID in particular. His generation had little forensic scientific support and no reliable system of identification (among other things to prove previous convictions) until Henry devised a practicable fingerprint technology in the early 1900s. Investigation was a painstaking procedure that required alertness, resourcefulness, experience, and intelligence. The Gerard case of 1917, where the investigation started from a headless and limbless female torso dumped over some Bloomsbury railings with a laundry mark on underclothes as the sole clue, is a classic of its kind. In a few days Wensley's pertinacity had found a target and, as the result of a clever interrogation, trapped the perpetrator and his accomplice.<br>
<br>Wensley retired in 1929 and wrote his memoirs, which were published in 1931. He died at his home, Lucholm, 76 Powys Lane, Palmers Green, London, on 4 December 1949, and was buried in Southgate cemetery. His sons died in the First World War: Frederic Martin was killed in action in 1916 and Harold William died from influenza four days after the armistice of 1918. His daughter survived him.<br>
