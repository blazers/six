<span class="headword">Bird,  James</span>  (1788&#150;1839), <span class="occ">poet and playwright</span>, was born on 10 November 1788 at Deerbolt's Hall, Earl Stonham, Suffolk, the eighth of the nine children of Samuel Bird (1749&#150;1826), farmer, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wink (1748&#150;1837). He was educated at the local village day school, and briefly at Needham Market grammar school, after which he was apprenticed to a miller for three years. A romantic story is told from his youth, that when the fame of John Kemble, the actor, reached Earl Stonham, Bird journeyed to London to witness his performance, returning on foot and penniless. About 1814 he was in a position to hire two windmills at Yoxford, but after five years of little success as a miller he abandoned the trade and began work early in 1820 as a bookseller, stationer, and druggist. He was married in 1816 to Emma (1792&#150;1872), daughter of George Hardacre, a bookseller from Hadleigh. They had sixteen children, of whom thirteen survived infancy.<br>
<br>Before Bird was sixteen years old he had written poetry, and later he contributed some of his early poems to the <span class="italic">Suffolk Chronicle</span>, whose editor, Thomas Harral, became a close friend. In 1819 he published his first long poem, <span class="italic">The Vale of Slaughden</span>, a story of the invasion of East Anglia by the Danes. It was first issued by subscription, but its success induced a London publisher, three months after its appearance, to undertake an edition for the public. In 1820 Nathan Drake in his <span class="italic">Winter Nights</span> (2.184&#150;244) reviewed it at length, and claimed for Bird the same rank in literature as that attained by Robert Bloomfield. Bird's second publication was a mock-heroic poem entitled <span class="italic">The White Hats</span> (1819), in which he humorously attacked the radical reformers. This was shortly followed by <span class="italic">Machin, or, The Discovery of Madeira</span> (1821). In 1823 he published <span class="italic">Poetical Memoirs: the Exile</span>, set in Scandinavia, the first part of which formed a spirited imitation of Byron's <span class="italic">Don Juan</span>; a second edition appeared in 1824. His edition of D. E. Davy's <span class="italic">A Short Account of Leiston Abbey</span> was printed in 1823, and next appeared <span class="italic">Dunwich: a Tale of the Splendid City</span> (1828) and <span class="italic">Framlingham: a Narrative of the Castle</span> (1831). <span class="italic">The Emigrant's Tale</span> (1833) was published in a volume with some &#145;metropolitan sketches&#146;, and other shorter miscellaneous poems. His last volume was <span class="italic">Francis Abbott, the Recluse of Niagara</span> (1837), founded on Sir James Alexander's <span class="italic">Transatlantic Sketches</span>. This final work also contained a second series of urban sketches. Much of Bird's early poetry indicates an intimate acquaintance with Dryden and Pope, and demonstrates the influence of Byron and Campbell, but his later work is in a more original style.<br>
<br>Bird also wrote two dramas, entitled <span class="italic">Cosmo, Duke of Tuscany: a Tragedy</span>, published in 1822, and <span class="italic">The Smuggler's Daughter</span>, published in 1836. The first was performed several times at small London theatres, but the managers of the chief playhouses refused to examine it. The second was successfully produced at Sadler's Wells in October 1835.<br>
<br>Bird died of consumption at Yoxford on 26 March 1839 and was buried in the village churchyard. The following year Harral published selections from his poems, which Bird himself had begun, with a memoir. His eldest child, Dr George Hardacre Bird, was married in 1842 to Mary Ann, youngest daughter of the poet Edwin Atherstone.<br>
