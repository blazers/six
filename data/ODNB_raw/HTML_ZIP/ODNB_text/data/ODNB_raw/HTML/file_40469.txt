<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Leighton,  Margaret</span>  (1922&#150;1976), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 26 February 1922 at Barnt Green, Worcestershire, the elder of two daughters in a family of three children of Augustus George Leighton, businessman in the cotton trade, and his wife, Doris Isabel Evans. She was educated at the Church of England College, Edgbaston, Birmingham, and began work as an assistant deputy stage manager at Barry Jackson's Birmingham Repertory Theatre, making her first appearance on stage in 1938, aged sixteen, as a cockney girl in <span class="italic">Laugh With Me</span>.<br>
<br>For the next few years Leighton played innumerable parts with Basil Langton's Travelling Repertory Theatre, rejoining Barry Jackson in December 1942. Leighton was something of a prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of Jackson and his &#145;adjutant&#146;, the South African-born director H. K. Ayliff. Her contemporary Paul Scofield commented that &#145;hers was a formidable combination of talent and beauty &hellip; she assimilated from H. K. a kind of female version of his towering qualities and his authority&#146;  (O'Connor, 147).<br>
<br>In 1944 Laurence Olivier, Ralph Richardson, and John Burrell came to see her perform and asked her to join their newly formed Old Vic company. For &pound;17 a week she made her London d&eacute;but as the Troll King's Daughter in Ibsen's <span class="italic">Peer Gynt</span>. She remained with this historic company for three years, playing other parts including Yelena in Chekhov's <span class="italic">Uncle Vanya</span>, Regan to Olivier's Lear, Roxane to Richardson's Cyrano, and the Queen to Alec Guinness's Richard II.<br>
<br>On 16 August 1947 Leighton married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/77404/', "Max Reinhardt (1915&#150;2002)")</script>, the publisher, living in some style in Albany, Piccadilly, and in a country house near Guildford. A year later she entered films, appearing as Flora MacDonald in <span class="italic">Bonnie Prince Charlie</span> for Alexander Korda's London films, and as the daughter in <span class="italic">The Winslow Boy</span> by Terence Rattigan with Robert Donat. Under contract to Korda, she was in great demand on both stage and screen, although she never perhaps achieved the success in films that might have been expected. She was divorced from Reinhardt in 1955.<br>
<br>In the theatre Leighton continued to thrive, playing a &#145;deeply touching&#146; Celia in T. S. Eliot's <span class="italic">The Cocktail Party</span> (1950), and Masha in an all-star <span class="italic">Three Sisters</span> by Chekhov (1951) which reunited her with Ralph Richardson. They appeared together at Stratford upon Avon the following year as the Macbeths and as Prospero and Ariel. It was thought that Richardson had fallen in love with her during the Old Vic season, but Leighton was also playing a delightful Rosalind (although Kenneth Tynan found her &#145;rather like a popular head girl&#146;) opposite <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61045/', "Laurence Harvey (1928&#150;1973)")</script>, and was falling in love herself. Born Hirsch Moses Skikne in Lithuania, Harvey was making a name for himself in films. They married, on a ship moored off Gibraltar, in 1957; passionate and tempestuous, they were very much the celebrity couple, playing their private lives in public.<br>
<br>Leighton was enjoying huge and glamorous success in theatres on both sides of the Atlantic. At the Haymarket in 1953 she played Orinthia in G. B. Shaw's <span class="italic">The Apple Cart</span>, starring with No&euml;l Coward. They also made some sparkling recordings together of his plays and poetry, and he considered her to be a peerless interpreter of his work. In 1954 she began a long run (nearly four years in London and New York) as Anne Shankland and Sybil Railton-Bell in the double bill of Terence Rattigan's <span class="italic">Separate Tables</span>, co-starring with Eric Portman and winning a Tony award as best actress. In <span class="italic">Variations on a Theme</span> (1958) Rattigan provided her with a role whose inspiration lay in Leighton's marriage to Harvey. The play was not a success.<br>
<br>Leighton was a radiant Beatrice to Sir John Gielgud's Benedick in New York (1959), and then scored another US triumph as Hannah Jelkes in Tennessee Williams's <span class="italic">The Night of the Iguana</span> (1962), playing with Bette Davis and winning a second Tony award. Her marriage to Harvey now over, she at last found happiness and stability with the actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57321/', "Michael Wilding (1912&#150;1979)")</script>, the son of Henry Wilding and his wife, Ethel Thompson. They were married in 1964; it was Wilding's fourth marriage&#151;his second wife had been Elizabeth Taylor with whom he had two sons.<br>
<br>Apart from an acclaimed Cleopatra at Chichester in 1969, for which she was the Variety Club's best actress, Leighton's later stage performances did not really match the achievements of earlier years. She had continued to work extensively in both film and television. On film she appeared in John Ford's <span class="italic">Seven Women</span> (1966) and was querulous and dotty in <span class="italic">The Madwoman of Chaillot</span> (1969) and chilling as the mother in <span class="italic">The Go-Between</span> (1970), for which she was Oscar nominated and won the British equivalent. Leighton had made her first appearance on television in 1955 in <span class="italic">A Month in the Country</span> by Turgenev; later appearances included <span class="italic">Gaslight</span> (1960), <span class="italic">The Vortex</span> (1968), and Gertrude to the Hamlet of Richard Chamberlain&#151;television's Dr Kildare&#151;in 1970, for which she won an Emmy.<br>
<br>Leighton made her last appearance on stage in 1975, in an adaptation of Ivy Compton-Burnett's <span class="italic">A Family and a Fortune</span> with her friend Alec Guinness, acting her role in a wheelchair. She had in fact been ill for some years with multiple sclerosis, the crippling effects of which she bore with great bravery. Always a wildly social figure (Coward and Rattigan both adored her, she adorned their arms at many a function, and Rattigan's house in Brighton included a permanent bedroom for Leighton), she lived with Wilding in a cottage near Chichester known locally as Vodka Villa. Tall, sometimes painfully thin, with sorrowful blue eyes, she had beauty, grace, intelligence, wit, and &#145;cheerful vulgarity&#146;  (Stephens, 122). The writer Enid Bagnold spoke of her as &#145;an extraordinary and shining woman, made of moonshine and talent and deep self-distrust, astonished at success&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 14 Jan 1976). Appointed CBE in 1974, she died on 13 January 1976 in Chichester.<br>
