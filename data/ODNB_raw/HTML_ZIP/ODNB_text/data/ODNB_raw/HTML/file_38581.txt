<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sammons,  Albert Edward</span>  (1886&#150;1957), <span class="occ">violinist and composer</span>, was born on 23 February 1886 in Fulham, London, the son of Thomas Sammons (<i>b</i>. 1863), a street musician, and his wife, Annie Jackson (<i>b</i>. 1875). He attended the Edinburgh Road School, Barlby Road, London. Without academic training, his only violin lessons were from his father (an amateur violinist) in childhood, and from two orchestral colleagues early in his career. He played in restaurants and theatres from the age of twelve, and in 1909 was heard playing at the Waldorf Hotel by Thomas Beecham, who offered him a place in the Beecham orchestra. A few months later he became leader, and he subsequently learned the symphonic, opera, and ballet repertory as he went along. In later years the conductor commented that Sammons was the finest leader he ever had. Sammons married Laura Molly Tomkins on 31 October 1907; the marriage ended in divorce in 1920, and on 5 December 1921 he married Olive Hobday.<br>
<br>Sammons founded the London String Quartet and led it from 1910 to 1919, but it was a performance of Elgar's violin concerto in 1914 that launched his solo career. The composer avowed that no other violinist could match his performances: &#145;Sammons gets to the heart of it&#146;  (private information). In 1915 Sammons began a musical partnership with the Australian pianist William Murdoch which lasted until the latter's death in 1942, and together they made many fine recordings of the classical repertory and of English music.<br>
<br>Always keen to encourage British composers, Sammons gave first performances of, and recorded, chamber works by Ralph Vaughan Williams, Frank Bridge, John Ireland, Elgar, Delius, Herbert Howells, Granville Bantock, Eugene Goossens, and Edmund Rubbra, and concertos by Delius and George Dyson. Notable performances included the premi&egrave;re of John Ireland's second sonata in March 1917; and he also took part in the first performance of Elgar's piano quintet in 1919. Delius dedicated his violin concerto to Sammons, who also made the first complete recording of Elgar's violin concerto in 1929, with Sir Henry Wood.<br>
<br>In 1919 Sammons formed the Chamber Music Players, a group of flexible instrumentation that could perform programmes containing anything from three to seven players. This, together with a sonata repertory with Murdoch and concerto playing, was the basis of a career that lasted until the onset of Parkinson's disease in 1946. Sammons was appointed professor of violin at the Royal College of Music in 1939 and was remembered with affection by the many pupils who entered the musical profession after his careful guidance. At the same time he would joke that he himself had never received a prize for violin playing. He was the composer of a number of light pieces for violin and piano, written mostly during his early career as a caf&eacute; musician. They show an instinctive grasp of musical structure in spite of his total lack of tuition in any branch of musical theory. More significantly, he won the Cobbett prize in 1915 with a &#145;Phantasy&#146; quartet. He also published sets of violin studies.<br>
<br>Sammons had a modest, friendly, and humorous personality which endeared him to his pupils, and his magnificent tone, astonishing technique, and faultless intonation never ceased to be a wonder to them. Sammons was obliged to give up concert work by 1948 as his illness progressed, and finally gave up teaching in 1954, by which time he could walk only with difficulty. A benefit concert was given in his honour at the Albert Hall in December 1954; he attended it confined to a wheelchair. He was appointed CBE in 1944 and died at Middleton-on-Sea, Sussex, on 24 August 1957; he was cremated in Brighton.<br>
<br>Sammons's good humour and resilience never left him. While attending a rehearsal of the BBC Symphony Orchestra in his final years, on walking in the break with great difficulty to the canteen with an acquaintance, he held up his left hand, now shaking in the manner characteristic of Parkinson's disease, and said with a smile, &#145;Look Harry, I've got the best vibrato in the world now&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Sammons was one of the finest of English violinists, though his fame was limited by circumstances. He was shy, diffident, and because of a fear of flying always refused offers of work abroad. Nevertheless, his performances and recordings were held in high esteem by violinists the world over. J. Heifetz, F. Kreisler, J. Szigeti, and Mischa Elman were friends and devotees, and younger players as diverse as I. Perlman, P. Zukerman, and Nigel Kennedy have acknowledged their debt to his recorded performances.<br>
