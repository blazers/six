<span class="headword">Warkworth,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1425&#150;1500), <span class="occ">ecclesiastic, college head, and supposed chronicler</span>, is thought to have been a native of the diocese of Durham, named from the Northumberland village of Warkworth. He was elected bachelor of Merton College, Oxford in 1446, admitted as bachelor fellow <i>c</i>.1447 and was a fellow by <i>c</i>.1448. He still held that position in 1456. He was also second bursar there in 1451&#150;3 and 1455&#150;6. He graduated MA at Oxford in 1449, and at about that time was one of the fellows of Merton admitted to the confraternity of the English Hospital of the Holy Trinity and St Thomas the Martyr at Rome. He was appointed an auditor of university library accounts in 1449 and of the proctor's accounts in 1455. He was ordained acolyte at St Frideswide's Priory, Oxford, in 1450. The next year he became principal of Bull Hall, and in 1453 of Neville's Inn, both belonging to Merton College. He was appointed keeper of the Turville chest in December 1455. Some time after 1454 he became domestic chaplain to William Grey, bishop of Ely (<i>d</i>. 1478), after which he received various livings in Cambridgeshire: he was rector of Cottenham (1458&#150;72); vicar of Wisbech St Peter (1472&#150;3); and rector of Leverington (1473&#150;90). He was also vicar of Latton, Essex (1460), and canon of Southwell and prebendary of Sacrista (1475&#150;98). Cambridge permitted him to incept as doctor of theology in 1462&#150;3. He was appointed in 1471 one of thirteen feoffees of whom Elizabeth Howard, dowager countess of Oxford, entrusted her lands; with six of his colleagues he later opposed turning the property over to Richard, duke of Gloucester, until Richard in 1474 successfully brought suit against them. In 1473 Bishop Grey appointed him master of Peterhouse, Cambridge.<br>
<br>Warkworth donated an astrolabe and fifty-five books to the library of Peterhouse in 1481, not 1483 as some have written. He also contributed 100 <i>s</i>. for the erection of Grove Wall on the west side of Peterhouse. About 1485 Cambridge granted Warkworth a grace, presumably on the grounds of ill health, so that he was not required to attend funeral rites of graduates, or meetings of congregations or convocations, unless he was specifically named. His first will was dated 31 December 1485, and a second was written on 28 May 1498. In the latter he requested burial in the chantry chapel that he had built and endowed in 1487 on the south side of the nave of St Mary-the-Less, Cambridge. He bequeathed a <span class="roman">Bible</span> to Merton College and made bequests to Peterhouse, the churches of St Mary-the-Less, Leverington, and Cottenham, and the monasteries of Ely, Crowland, and Barnwell. He also made bequests for masses for his own soul and for those of his parents and Bishop Grey. Peterhouse has a portrait of him as a cleric holding an open book. The date 1498 on the picture was added by a later hand. He remained master of Peterhouse until his death in October or November 1500. His will was proved on 17 November 1500. He is not to be confused with another John Warkworth of Durham, who was ordained acolyte by William Grey in 1468 and was a fellow of Peterhouse from 1468 to 1479.<br>
<br>One of Warkworth's books, a manuscript written in English, <span class="italic">Liber cronicorum in Anglicis</span> (Cambridge, Peterhouse, MS 190), contains one of the two known texts of Warkworth's chronicle, which covers the first thirteen years (1461&#150;74) of Edward IV's reign. This work's emphasis on events in northern England has led some to believe that Warkworth was the author of it, but there is no proof of this. A Latin note records that the book was given to Peterhouse by Warkworth, who may simply have commissioned its transcription. According to Lister Matheson, earlier scholars were incorrect in assuming that the first part of Peterhouse 190 is a copy of Caxton's 1482 edition of the <span class="italic">Chronicles of England</span>; it is instead a different <span class="italic">Brut</span> text, to which a second hand has added a continuation from 1419 to 1461 based upon one of Caxton's two editions of the <span class="italic">Chronicles of England</span> and his 1482 edition of Trevisa's translation of the <span class="italic">Polychronicon</span>. Warkworth's chronicle, covering the years 1461&#150;74, was added to this continuation in the Peterhouse manuscript. The Peterhouse manuscript refers to another copy of Warkworth's continuation, the location of which was for many years unknown. Matheson, however, found a copy in University of Glasgow Library, Hunterian MS 83, and has argued that this is the text from which the Peterhouse version of Warkworth's chronicle was copied. Since the continuation of the <span class="italic">Brut</span> to 1461 in the Peterhouse manuscript could not have been written until after the publication of Caxton's <span class="italic">Polychronicon</span> in 1482, and since part of the Hunterian manuscript was copied from the St Albans edition of the <span class="italic">Chronicles of England</span> (<i>c</i>.1483), the two manuscripts of Warkworth's chronicle could not have been copied before <i>c</i>.1484, after Warkworth had donated his books to the library. Matheson believes that another fellow of Peterhouse, either Roger Lancaster or Thomas Metcalf, probably wrote the chronicle attributed to Warkworth.<br>
<br>The chronicle has some pro-Lancastrian bias, such as sympathy for the deposed Henry VI, and criticism of Edward IV for failing to establish peace and end the hardships caused by war. Nevertheless, the tone is generally moderate and reasonably objective. Scholars have valued it for the information it gives about events in the north, such as Edward IV's subjugation of Northumberland, Henry VI's capture of Lancaster (1465), the rebellion in Lincolnshire (1470), and the battle of Tewkesbury (1471). Written in 1484, after Richard III had become king, it does not include charges against Richard found in Tudor works, such as his being involved with the murder of Henry VI. At some points it confirms statements found in less objective accounts like the Yorkist <span class="italic">Chronicle of the Rebellion in Lincolnshire</span>. Known to Leland in the sixteenth century, Warkworth's chronicle was first published by the Camden Society in 1839, in an edition by J. O. Halliwell, and by the Boydell Press in 1999, in an edition by L. Matheson.<br>
