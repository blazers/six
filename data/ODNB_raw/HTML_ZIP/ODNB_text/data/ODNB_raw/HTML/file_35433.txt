<span class="headword">Pearce, Sir  George Foster</span>  (1870&#150;1952), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Mount Barker, South Australia, on 13 January 1870, the fourth son of ten children of English emigrants James Pearce (<i>d</i>. 1919), blacksmith, born at Altarnun, Cornwall, and his wife, Jane Foster (<i>d</i>. 1880), born in London. He attended Redhill public school until the age of eleven, which provided him with his only formal education. When his father moved to Maitland on Yorke peninsula he worked for three years on a farm and then, after serving an apprenticeship as a carpenter, gained employment at Port Adelaide, where he witnessed at first hand the great national maritime strike of 1891. In the ensuing depression he was laid off and decided to try his luck in Western Australia. There, following a brief adventure on the Coolgardie goldfields, he became foreman at Whittaker Brothers' joinery at Subiaco. Simultaneously he had taken a key role in the burgeoning labour movement; by 1899 he was president of the Carpenters' Union and the Trades and Labour Council and was a leading figure in the newly established Labor Party. In all these activities the qualities which marked his subsequent political career were already apparent.<br>
<br>On 23 April 1897 Pearce married Eliza Maude (<i>d</i>. 1947), daughter of Richard Barnett, a french polisher, of Perth, Western Australia; they had two sons and two daughters. Neatly handsome, somewhat reserved and a lifelong teetotaller, Pearce was in public life conscientious, industrious, even-tempered, and pragmatic. He was a sound administrator and served four prime ministers in high cabinet office loyally and competently. He was brought up a Congregationalist, but in later life worshipped at Presbyterian churches.<br>
<br>A strong advocate of federation, Pearce was elected as a Western Australian senator to the first commonwealth parliament, a seat he held through various political vicissitudes until 1937. He initially supported free trade, favoured moderate social reform, opposed militarism and the South African War, and stood unequivocally for a &#145;white Australia&#146;. Of all these the most important and enduring was the last. In speaking to the 1901 <span class="roman">Immigration Restriction Bill</span> he stated that his &#145;chief objection [to] coloured [peoples was] entirely racial&#146;  (<span class="italic">Commonwealth Parliamentary Debates</span>, 5, 7160, 13 Nov 1901). With Japan's defeat of Russia in 1905 Pearce, even more than most Australian political leaders, came to fear not only a migratory but also a military invasion from the north. Consequently, it was his view that Labor's ideals could only be attained if Australians were willing to fight for them: &#145;We have that danger to face. I allude to the rise of Japan, the possibility of aggression by that power, and of her expansion in the Pacific&#146;  (ibid., 31, 635, 22 June 1906). Neither the Anglo-Japanese alliance nor the British navy, anchored in the North Sea to ward off the German threat, could be depended upon. Thus as minister of defence in Andrew Fisher's Labor governments of 1908&#150;9 and 1910&#150;13 Pearce extended the compulsory military training of youths aged between fourteen and twenty-five, backed the move to establish an Australian navy, created a munitions industry, and founded an officer training college and a central flying school.<br>
<br>Pearce was minister of defence in Fisher's government elected to office in September 1914, in W. M. Hughes's Labor government of 1915&#150;16, and in the successive Hughes National Party governments, 1917&#150;21. While remaining anxious about Japan's intentions, he endorsed Australia's giving all aid to the mother country for both sentimental and national interests reasons: &#145;The <span class="roman">White Australia Act</span> would not have been worth a snap of the finger but for the might of the British Navy &hellip; the shortest way to Australia's safety was to win this war as speedily as possible&#146;  (<span class="italic">West Australian</span>, 25 Oct 1916). Holding this view, Pearce backed Hughes's call in 1916 for conscription to reinforce the Australian Imperial Force on the western front, which resulted in Hughes and his followers, including Pearce, being forced out of the Labor Party and into government with the Liberals. Pearce represented Australia at the Washington conference in 1921&#150;2 which encouraged him to believe that Japan was no longer a threat. It was in presiding over the raising, training, transporting, and demobilizing of the 350,000 strong Australian Imperial Force that Pearce made his greatest contribution to national life.<br>
<br>From 1923 to 1937, with the brief exception of 1929&#150;31, when Labor was in office, Pearce held portfolios in conservative administrations, as minister for home and territories (1923&#150;6) and vice-president of the executive council (1926&#150;9) in S. M. Bruce's National-Country Party government and as minister of defence (1931&#150;4) and minister for external affairs (1934&#150;7) in J. B. Lyons's United Australia Party government. Following Japan's military seizure of Manchuria and the rise of the Nazis to power in Germany Pearce recognized that the British empire might have to fight a war on two fronts and in this case Australia would once again be vulnerable. To meet this crisis he made a rather muddled effort to build up Australia's defence forces, which had been greatly reduced in the previous decade, and he moved cautiously to prepare Australia for a more active role in foreign affairs. Amid the great depression Western Australia, disillusioned with a remote Canberra-based and eastern-dominated federal government, had in April 1933 voted overwhelmingly for secession from the commonwealth and in the 1937 election the secessionists urged voters to &#145;Put Pearce last&#146; and he was defeated. On retirement he was appointed to directorships on the Commonwealth Grants Commission and during the Second World War on the Board of Business Administration, where both conservative and Labor governments drew upon his valuable experience.<br>
<br>Pearce was sworn of the privy council in 1921 and created KCVO in 1927. He died at his home in Elwood, Melbourne, on 24 June 1952 and was given a state funeral, the service for which was held at John Knox Presbyterian Church, Gardenvale.<br>
