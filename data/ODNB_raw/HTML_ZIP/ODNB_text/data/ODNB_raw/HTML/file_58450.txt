<span class="headword">Ponsonby,  Frederick Edward Grey</span>, first Baron Sysonby  (1867&#150;1935), <span class="occ">courtier and author</span>, was born on 16 September 1867 at 6 Cloisters, Windsor Castle, the fourth of five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22497/', "Sir Henry Frederick Ponsonby (1825&#150;1895)")</script>, private secretary to Queen Victoria, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60754/', "Mary Elizabeth Ponsonby (1832&#150;1916)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22497/', "Ponsonby, Sir Henry Frederick")</script>], daughter of John Crocker Bulteel, landowner and MP of Flete, Devon, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth, daughter of Charles, second Earl Grey, the prime minister. Both Ponsonby's parents came from prominent whig families and this aided their introduction to court. However, both parents had talent as well as connections. In 1870 Queen Victoria selected Henry Ponsonby to be her private secretary, and later made him keeper of the privy purse as well. Under his long tenure in office, these two posts became the most important household positions. Ponsonby's mother served as maid of honour to the queen before her marriage to Henry Ponsonby in 1861. Afterwards, she took an active interest in promoting women's education and civil rights, and was on the committee that founded and raised funds for Girton College, Cambridge. She had friends among prominent feminists and intellectuals, for example Ethel Smyth and George Eliot. Both she and her husband were Liberal in their politics. The family enjoyed a keen sense of the absurd. Their dinner table in the Norman Tower at Windsor was a disorderly mixture of argument, in-jokes, and helpless laughter.<br>
<br>As a boy Fritz Ponsonby, as he was generally known, attended Hawtrey's School, Slough, and subsequently Eton College (1880&#150;86). From there he followed in his father's footsteps from Sandhurst to a commission in the Grenadier Guards. Unlike his father, he collected gambling debts and grew to be a Conservative in politics. As a way of saving money he accepted an invitation to go to India as aide-de-camp to the viceroy, Lord Elgin, in 1893. He was there for only a short time before Queen Victoria invited him, as a mark of honour to his father, to fill a vacant equerryship in her household. He reluctantly accepted and returned to England.<br>
<br>In his first waiting at court Ponsonby gave deep offence to the queen. She had asked him to enquire, while still in India, about the relatives of Abdul Karim, her munshi, or Indian secretary. She was mildly infatuated with Karim, an awkward but harmless attachment. Karim had claimed to be the son of a doctor; Ponsonby flatly denied this and told the queen, truthfully but tactlessly, that Karim's father was merely druggist to the gaol in Agra. She refused to speak to Ponsonby afterwards and arranged his waitings so as to have as little contact with him as possible. The contrast with his father's tolerance and discretion could not have been greater.<br>
<br>Fritz Ponsonby survived the queen's fury, and with the increased work during the diamond jubilee (1897) she gave him his first full-time appointment at court. He became assistant private secretary to Sir Arthur Bigge and assistant keeper of the privy purse to Sir Fleetwood Edwards. He hoped ultimately to fill both his father's old offices, but failed partly because of office politics and partly because of his own obstreperousness. When Queen Victoria died, King Edward VII brought with him to the throne his own private secretary, Sir Francis Knollys. There had always been friction between the queen's staff and Knollys, in which can be found echoes of the difficult relations between Hanoverian sovereigns and their eldest sons. Knollys reduced Ponsonby's position to half pay by adding a second assistant. Ponsonby stayed on with reduced wages and responsibilities, possibly because he got on well with the new king. Both were sticklers for proper dress, liked arranging ceremonies, and enjoyed the plutocratic extravagance of their day.<br>
<br>Ponsonby prided himself on not being a flatterer, and towards the king's son and heir he adopted a more hectoring stance. When King George V came to the throne he regarded Ponsonby as a perpetual critic, but put up with him from a sense of filial duty. In 1914 the king brought him back from France, where he was serving with the guards, to be keeper of the privy purse. In this office Ponsonby supervised draconian reductions in household expenditure necessitated by the First World War. The duke of Windsor recalled him as a quintessential figure of the court establishment: Ponsonby had upbraided the then prince of Wales in 1919 for making himself too accessible to the public, and would brook no argument with his assertion that &#145;The Monarchy must always retain an element of mystery&#146;  (Edward VIII, 132).<br>
<br>In the 1920s, when his duties at court had become routine, Ponsonby had turned to writing. In 1929 he published <span class="italic">Letters of the Empress Frederick</span> (Queen Victoria's eldest daughter, and mother of Kaiser Wilhelm II), who was Ponsonby's godmother. The papers had come to him under extraordinary circumstances. The Empress Frederick, on her deathbed and highly sedated with morphine, asked him to take them for safe keeping to England. The Kaiser regarded this as theft and tried to prevent the publication of the letters, especially as they revealed how poorly he had treated his mother. Ponsonby defied the Kaiser and ignored George V's misgivings. The book received good reviews and bolstered the evidence, as seen from England, of the Kaiser's wickedness.<br>
<br>Next, from among his father's papers Ponsonby published <span class="italic">Sidelights on Queen Victoria</span> (1930), which juxtaposed laughably trivial stories with letters illustrating the court's involvement in important questions of policy. For example, an early chapter showed the court obsessed with whether the queen's German secretary should be allowed to ride a pony at Balmoral. A later chapter examined the negotiations conducted on behalf of the queen during the passage of the third <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>. The book lacked the historical perspective which his younger brother, Arthur, Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede, brought to the same subject in <span class="italic">Henry Ponsonby</span>, his 1942 biography of their father. However, it contained inside stories of court life, which tended to diminish Queen Victoria's stature as a goddess, though the odd combination of high politics and low comedy augmented the legendary aura of her court.<br>
<br>Fritz Ponsonby's masterpiece was <span class="italic">Recollections of Three Reigns</span> (1951), published posthumously. Here he deployed the family sense of the absurd to superb effect. Ponsonby arranged his <span class="italic">Recollections</span> in a series of anecdotes suitable for after-dinner hilarity. Nancy Mitford told Evelyn Waugh there was &#145;a shriek on every page&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of &hellip; Mitford and &hellip; Waugh</span>, 254).<br>
<br>Ponsonby had married, on 17 May 1899, Victoria Lily (known as Ria) Hegan Kennard (<i>d</i>. 1955), the daughter of Colonel Hegan Kennard and his wife, Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hegan. They had two children, Edward Gaspard, later second Lord Sysonby, and Loelia, who achieved notoriety by her marriage to (1930) and subsequent divorce (1947) from Hugh, second duke of Westminster. The Ponsonbys lived in St James's Palace, as well as at Great Tangley Manor, Guildford, yet they were never particularly well off. Their daughter had at one point to be withdrawn from her boarding-school because they were unable to pay her fees; Lady Sysonby had financial worries as a widow.<br>
<br>Fritz Ponsonby was created Lord Sysonby of Wonersh, Surrey, on 24 June 1935, and died at a nursing home at 20 Devonshire Place, Marylebone, London, on 20 October the same year. His funeral was at the Chapel Royal, St James's, and his body was then taken to Golders Green for cremation (22 October). Although he could be punctilious and overbearing, his books were authentic and entertaining. They contain valuable lessons about the court's being at its most attractive when alive to both the dignity and ridiculousness of ceremonial, as well as when its political powers are circumscribed by democratic traditions.<br>
