<span class="headword">Wight,  (Robert James) Martin</span>  (1913&#150;1972), <span class="occ">historian and expert on international affairs</span>, was born on 26 November 1913 at 9 Bath Square, Brighton, Sussex, the second of the three children, all sons, of Edward Wight (1879&#150;1959), general medical practitioner, and his wife, Margaretta, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Scott (1880&#150;1942). From Prestonville House School, Hove, and Bradfield College (1927&#150;32), Martin, as he was known, went on to take a first in modern history at Hertford College, Oxford, in 1935. He then joined the Royal Institute of International Affairs at Chatham House, London, to work under A. J. Toynbee, for many years a strong influence. A baptized Anglican, he now became a Christian pacifist and worked with the Revd Dick Shepphard. In 1938 he succeeded J. Hampden Jackson as senior history master at Haileybury College, Hertford, where he at once showed a flair for teaching. His pupils, with whom he had a strong mutual rapport, had considerable successes, winning Oxbridge college scholarships. In 1941 he was granted exemption from military service on condition that he abandoned teaching. His objections to serving were personal: the war was a divine judgement on a backsliding world for whose sins all were responsible. Pacifism was a vocation to which he felt a calling. (He later ignored the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, which he regarded as a political campaign.)<br>
<br>From 1941, until he returned to Chatham House in 1946, Wight worked under Margery Perham on the evolution of British African colonial constitutions. The resulting three books were of lasting importance to their subject. When the war ended, he was one of several Christian historians (Herbert Butterfield and Reinhold Niebuhr were others) from whom the experiences of the time drew out eschatological reflections and a prophetic interest in the divine indications of secular history: he was to remain impressed by St Augustine's <span class="italic">City of God</span>. By 1949, when he moved to the London School of Economics (LSE) as reader in international affairs, his religious beliefs no longer obtruded into his academic work. But his conviction that the true understanding of history lay outside the boundaries of secular experience gave him a magisterial authority with students happy to have their horizons extended beyond the intricacies of post-war international institutions. He continuously refined a course of lectures on what he called international theory, an attempt to categorize the ideas which had influenced the conduct of states in relation to each other. He found three traditions: realist (from Machiavelli to E. H. Carr), rationalist (Grotius and the natural law jurists of the seventeenth century to Gladstone, Lincoln, and F. D. Roosevelt), and revolutionist (from Kant to Lenin and Hitler). The elaboration of his ideas in a wide chronological and geographical sweep was illuminated by anecdotal evidence deftly drawn from a prodigious learning, from Thucydides to <span class="italic">Mein Kampf</span>. His pupils included Hedley Bull, who edited and published Wight's two unfinished works: <span class="italic">Systems of States</span> (1977) and, with Carsten Holbrad, <span class="italic">Power Politics</span> (1978), which was expanded from a 1946 pamphlet with that title which had immediately established Wight's authority. In these books Wight examined historically how sovereign states sought to protect their security and forward their interests by diplomacy, alliance, intervention, war, and, most successfully, by manipulation of the balance of power. The original LSE lectures, edited by his widow and Brian Porter, were published as <span class="italic">International Theory: the Three Traditions</span> (1991). This now substantial <i>&#339;uvre</i> drew from Adam Roberts, Bull's successor in the Montague Burton chair of international relations at Oxford, the comment that Wight was &#145;perhaps the most profound thinker on international relations of his generation of British academics&#146;  (foreword to <span class="italic">International Theory</span>, xxiv).<br>
<br>In 1958 Butterfield and Wight convened at Cambridge a small body of academics and diplomats, under Rockefeller Foundation patronage, as the British committee on the theory of international politics. From its periodic meetings came, in 1966, <span class="italic">Diplomatic Investigations</span>, which contained Wight's two most influential essays, &#145;Why is there no international theory?&#146; and &#145;Western values in international relations&#146;.<br>
<br>Wight's ideas ran directly against the rising transatlantic tide of behaviourism, systems analysis, and games theory which constructed value- and history-free models from the social sciences to provide techniques for crisis management and the avoidance of war. Wight's concern was with understanding (<i>Verstehen</i>), not with predictions or solutions. He believed that this could only be found historically by considering the interplay between ideas (including morals) and events (Wight was an admirer of R. G. Collingwood). In the anarchical world of sovereign states, theory followed rather than determined events and morality was often defined, and monopolized, by sated powers. The most the student or statesman could hope for was intelligent rumination and reflection on the evidence. Though he had a natural propensity for model building, he was always the first to cast doubt on his own findings: &#145;Classification becomes valuable in humane studies only at the point at which it breaks down&#146;  (<span class="italic">International Theory</span>, 259). Ideal types and paradigms were at best artificial constructs.<br>
<br>In 1961 Wight was appointed, as one of the nine original members of the academic faculty, to the new University of Sussex, as professor of history and founding dean of the school of European studies (the first in Britain). He pioneered an ambitious course, taught in tutorials, involving a language, philosophy, literature, social studies, and thematic history. The rapid proliferation of languages and options may, over time, have given the school a looser intellectual coherence than Wight had intended, but his enthusiasm and dedication ensured that it fulfilled his aim: &#145;if half of a liberal education in the twentieth century is to gain an understanding of the world we live in, the other half consists in breaking its influence and finding deliverance from the tyranny of the immediate, the novel and the transitory&#146;  (D. Daiches, ed., <span class="italic">The Idea of a New University</span>, 1964, 105).<br>
<br>Wight was a tall, handsome man, with an air of gentle authority (and a strong sense of the ridiculous). He married, on 23 December 1952, Gabriele, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ritzen (<i>b</i>. 6 December 1928 in Ulm, Germany), a recent graduate of Reading University. They had six children and lived first in Caterham, Surrey, and from 1960 in Speldhurst in Kent. Wight was not naturally gregarious, but formed lasting close friendships maintained by frequent correspondence in a beautiful hand. He died suddenly at his home at Harwarton, Speldhurst, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, on 15 July 1972 from heart failure following an attack of his chronic asthma, and was buried at Speldhurst. He is commemorated by an annual lecture given, in rotation, at Chatham House, the London School of Economics, and Sussex University.<br>
