<span class="headword">White,  Benjamin</span>  (<em>c.</em>1725&#150;1794), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was the son of John White (1688&#150;1758), barrister, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Holt (1693&#150;1739). He was a younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29243/', "Gilbert White (1720&#150;1793)")</script>, author of the celebrated <span class="italic">Natural History of Selborne</span> (1789). Ben, as he was known, introduced Gilbert to Thomas Pennant and Daines Barrington to whom the book's component letters were written, and he edited and published the book. During their lifetimes Ben was much better known than his brother. White was raised with his six brothers and four sisters at The Wakes, Selborne, the family house which Gilbert, who was the eldest brother, later took over. Their father was not rich. One brother and two sisters died young. With his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59515/', "Thomas Holt White (1724&#150;1797)")</script> he attended school at Bishop's Waltham, Hampshire. Unlike their brothers the two pursued business careers in London, Thomas as an ironmonger, Ben as a publisher, and became the wealthiest of them; this enabled the family later to refurbish and extend The Wakes. By October 1745 White was working for <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29216/', "John Whiston (1711&#150;1780)")</script>, a respected publisher and bookseller at Horace's Head, at the junction of Fleet Street and the Strand. Whiston was related to Thomas Barker, of Rutland, who was Gilbert White's brother-in-law. Ben White was made a partner in 1756, and in 1765 he took the firm over. His valuable assistant, Henry Payne, became linked with White's name: about 1773 &#145;White and Payne&#146; offered &pound;100 for the 2000 volume library of the deceased theologian Dr Matthew Horbery. Soon after, however, Payne set up a rival firm in Pall Mall on borrowed credit, became bankrupt, and died.<br>
<br>White produced a wide range of titles, some of great beauty. Horace's Head became a meeting place for naturalists, and, as was customary, was used as a poste restante, in 1775 by Gilbert White's correspondent Thomas Pennant, whose books White published, and by others. White's range of titles is indicated in his advertisement at the end of J. Ellis and D. C. Solander's <span class="italic">Natural History of the Zoophytes</span> (1786), which he published. They included Mark Catesby's <span class="italic">Natural History of Carolina</span> in two volumes, which perhaps inspired Audubon; an edition of Philip Miller's <span class="italic">Gardener's Dictionary</span>; the Revd John Lightfoot's <span class="italic">Flora Scotica</span> (2 vols.); and eight books by Pennant. White's brother John (1727&#150;1781), named after their father, became chaplain to the forces in Gibraltar. His book on the local fauna was rejected by White, partly on Gilbert's advice, as not commercially viable, and most of the manuscript is lost.<br>
<br>White married Ann Yaldeen, daughter of the vicar of Newton Valence, next to Selborne, and the couple had a home in South Lambeth, as did Thomas White. The family remained close and Gilbert stayed with one or both of the brothers in London most springs for a month or so: on 26 June 1791 fifteen Whites and several others dined at White's home. On 12 July that year White commenced razing and rebuilding Horace's Head, but the following year he retired permanently to Mareland House, near Bentley, in north-east Hampshire.<br>
<br>By 1785 White's son, also Benjamin, was prominent in the business, and he handled the final stages of production of <span class="italic">Selborne</span>. The firm was renamed Benjamin White &amp; Son, and under that name published Ellis and Solander's <span class="italic">Zoophytes</span>. By the time White finally retired in 1792 his other son, another John, had also joined the firm. The partnership continued to sell second-hand books and in 1813 the firm, by then White, Cochrane &amp; Co., published with others probably the finest and most complete edition of <span class="italic">Selborne</span>: in 1993 a facsimile of it commemorated the bicentenary of Gilbert White's death.<br>
<br>Ben White died a wealthy man on 9 March 1794 at Mareland; his name was passed to both his son and his grandson. White never knew the irony that, from about 1810, among all his firm's memorable titles the sparsely illustrated, much edited, rambling diary of his own brother would be its best-seller, and that it would remain in print throughout the twentieth century.<br>
