<span class="headword">Touche <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Touch]</span>, Sir  George Alexander</span>, first baronet  (1861&#150;1935), <span class="occ">accountant</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 24 May 1861 as George Alexander Touch (the &#145;e&#146; was added in 1906 by royal licence and authority because of annoyance with the persistent mispronunciation of his name), the third of the seven children of Anthony Murray Touch, a banker, an agent with the Edinburgh branch of the Union Bank of Scotland, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Alexander Guild. He was educated at the Bonnington Academy, the Edinburgh Institute, and Edinburgh University before becoming indentured to the Scottish chartered accountant Alexander Thomas Niven in 1878. He was admitted to membership of the Society of Accountants in Edinburgh in 1883, having distinguished himself in actuarial science, and then, in common with many other Scots at that time, set off immediately for London, where he joined Broads, Paterson, and May, chartered accountants. On 4 June 1887 he married Jessie (1862/3&#150;1917), daughter of Isaac Brown, wine merchant; they had four sons.<br>
<br>In addition to accountancy, Touche's career encompassed politics and the management of investment trusts. He was appointed secretary of the newly formed Industrial and General Trust in 1889 which, in common with many other investment trusts, suffered following the Baring crisis of 1890, with the result that its capital was reduced in 1894. Following his appointment as manager, he worked to place the trust on a profitable basis and was subsequently appointed director in 1898 and chairman in 1908. He quickly became prominent in the investment world, and the restoration to prosperity of the Winchester House group of companies, as his investment trusts came to be known, formed a large and perhaps principal part of his life's work. It has been said that he did a great deal to lay down the principles on which investment trusts have been run ever since, and his obituary notice in the <span class="italic">Accountants' Magazine</span> saw him principally as a creator and restorer of the trust company movement. At the time of his death in 1935 he was director of twelve major trust companies and chairman of nine of them. His many directorships outside the investment trust movement included also chairmanships of the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company, the Midland Railway Company of Western Australia, and the Mexican Southern Railway.<br>
<br>When called in by companies in difficulty, Touche saw himself as a reconstructor rather than a liquidator, and work in this area encouraged him to found an accountancy practice, George A. Touch &amp; Co. (now Deloitte and Touche), in London in 1899. The firm was initially located in Bartholomew Lane but moved to Basildon House, Moorgate, in 1901. He later opened an office in Birmingham but his main energy was devoted to developing the firm's overseas operations. The first branch in Canada (in Toronto) was opened in 1909 and in the 1920s and 1930s his firm was one of the leading accountancy practices in that country. His first branch in the United States, Touch, Niven &amp; Co., was established jointly with John B. Niven, the son of his own principal; this was set up in New York in 1900, and further offices were opened in Minneapolis, Chicago, St Louis, and Cleveland between 1913 and 1919. A Paris office was opened in 1920. At home, the firm remained relatively modest in size, having a staff of just 67 in 1939, which may be contrasted with the 345 partners and 4303 professional staff located in 22 offices in the United Kingdom in 1995.<br>
<br>Touche was a staunch Conservative who was returned to parliament for North Islington in 1910; he retired because of ill health in 1918. He was an accomplished speaker who spoke with authority on financial matters. He became an alderman of the City of London in 1915 and was sheriff in 1915&#150;16. Knighted in 1917, he was created a baronet in 1920 and was also one of his majesty's lieutenants for the City of London. In addition, he was made a knight of the Serbian order of St Sava.<br>
<br>Touche served on the council of the Society of Accountants in Edinburgh from 1904 to 1908. Outside his business life, his recreations included riding and swimming. He also wrote poems which he sent in printed form to his friends at Christmas. Soon after his wife died in 1917, his health deteriorated. His public appearances became increasingly rare, as he worked mainly from his home near Dorking, Surrey, and travelled up to London only for board meetings. He died at Broomfield, Westcott, near Dorking, Surrey, on 7 July 1935. He was succeeded as second baronet by his eldest son, Norman George Touche.<br>
