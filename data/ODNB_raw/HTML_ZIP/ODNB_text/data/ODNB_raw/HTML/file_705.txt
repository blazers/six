<span class="headword">Arthur</span>, prince of Wales  (1486&#150;1502), <span class="occ"></span>was born at St Swithun's Priory, Winchester, on 19 September 1486, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12954/', "Henry VII (1457&#150;1509)")</script> and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8635/', "Elizabeth of York (1466&#150;1503)")</script>, the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8520/', "Edward IV")</script>, whom Henry had married on 18 January 1486, in fulfilment of an oath made at Christmas 1483. Arthur was baptized on 24 September in Winchester Cathedral and named after the famous British hero whose fabulous exploits fill the pages of Geoffrey of Monmouth. Initially he was put into the care of women and his nursery (which in 1487 was located at Farnham) was headed by Dame Elizabeth Darcy&#151;who had performed the same role for Edward IV's children. In 1489 there begin to be references to male servants in attendance on him, and after his creation as knight of the Bath and investiture as prince of Wales and earl of Chester on 29 November that year a more elaborate household structure was created for him by secondment from his father's officers.<br>
<br>By this date Arthur's education was probably already in hand. He reportedly learnt the rudiments very quickly, and then, <i>c</i>.1491, his higher studies commenced under John Rede, formerly headmaster of Winchester College. His education was subsequently taken over by Bernard Andr&eacute;. Other schoolmasters, including Thomas Linacre, followed Andr&eacute; in the prince's service, and by the time of his death Arthur was said to be familiar with the works of twenty-four classical authors in Latin.<br>
<br>In May 1490 Arthur was described as warden of all the marches towards Scotland, with Thomas Howard, earl of Surrey, as his deputy. He was named on commissions of the peace from 1491 onwards. In October 1492 he was made keeper of England and the king's lieutenant during his father's absence in France. His main connections were with Wales, where Henry VII followed the precedent established by Edward IV and set up a council for the prince, to act as a focus for royal authority there and in the marches. The council was in existence by March 1490, although Arthur did not at this stage move to Wales and the council's effective royal figurehead was initially the king's uncle Jasper Tudor. Conciliar authority in the marches was strengthened in March 1493 by the grant of various powers to the prince, including the power to appoint justices of oyer and terminer and inquire into franchises. In November that year he received an extensive land grant in the region, including the estates of the earldom of March.<br>
<br>Arthur's marriage was under discussion as early as 1488, when it was suggested that he should marry <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4891/', "Katherine of Aragon (1485&#150;1536)")</script>. On 27 March 1489 the treaty of Medina del Campo (ratified by Henry VII in December 1490) provided for the marriage of the two children as soon as they were of canonical age. A proxy betrothal at Woodstock followed in 1497, and two proxy marriages in 1499 and 1500 before Katherine finally arrived in England, landing at Plymouth on 2 October 1501. The couple were married in St Paul's Cathedral on 14 November: the ceremony the high point of a month of festivities which had begun with their entry into London at the beginning of November. In the following month they left for the marches of Wales, where they established their household at Ludlow. Arthur died there on 2 April 1502. The news reached the royal court at Greenwich late on 4 April, and the royal council delegated the task of breaking the news to the king to his confessor, who told the king in the early hours of the following morning. King and queen comforted each other for their loss. Arthur's body lay in state for three weeks before being taken for burial at Worcester Cathedral, where his chantry chapel survives. He is also commemorated in stained-glass, in a transept window in Great Malvern Priory church. The heraldry displayed at his funeral included not only his own arms, and those of Wales, Cornwall, and Chester, but also the arms of Cadwalader and Brutus.<br>
<br>With the benefit of hindsight the most important consequence of Arthur's early death was the remarriage of his widow to the prince's younger brother, the future <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12955/', "Henry VIII")</script>, and the controversy to which that later gave rise concerning the consummation or otherwise of Katherine's first marriage. When Henry began proceedings for a divorce she was adamant that she had come a virgin to her second marriage bed, raising the possibility that Arthur's claim after first sharing a bed with his bride, that &#145;I have been this night in the midst of Spain&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 4/3, no. 5774), was no more than adolescent braggadocio. No other evidence for consummation was ever submitted, though its lack was made up for by a good deal of speculation.<br>
