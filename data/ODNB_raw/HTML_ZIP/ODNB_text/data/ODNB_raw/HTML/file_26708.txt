<span class="headword">Stuart,  James</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Athenian Stuart]</span>  (1713&#150;1788), <span class="occ">painter and architect</span>, was born in Creed Lane, Ludgate Street, London, the eldest son of a Scottish mariner who died when he was a boy, leaving the family with insufficient financial support.<h2>
<a name="ItalyandGreece17421754"></a>Italy and Greece 1742&#150;1754</h2>Stuart found early employment with Lewis Goupy, a well-known fan painter, at the same time as studying mathematics, geometry, and anatomy, and teaching himself Greek and Latin. After his mother's death, with his brother and sister in employment, he was able to fulfil his long-held ambition of continuing his artistic training in Rome. In 1742, aged twenty-nine, he set off on foot to Rome, where he remained for eight years, acquiring a reputation as a connoisseur of art, continuing his study of Greek and Latin at the Collegio di Propaganda Fide, and mastering the art of engraving. As a result, he produced an illustrated account of the Egyptian obelisk found in the Campus Martius, which he published in A. M. Bandini's <span class="italic">De obelisco Caesaris Augusti</span> (1750).<br>
<br>In April 1748 Stuart and Nicholas Revett (1720&#150;1804), the wealthy son of a Suffolk squire, together with the painter and dealer Gavin Hamilton and the architect Robert Brettingham the younger, visited Naples, where they first formed an ambition of measuring the buildings of Athens. Though lip-service had been paid since the Renaissance to Greece as the fountainhead of Western civilization, almost no one had ever bothered to go to Athens to investigate the surviving buildings, though it was, admittedly, very difficult of access.<br>
<br>In Rome in 1750 Stuart and Revett met Robert Wood, a scholar who had visited Greece in the 1740s, and his colleague James Dawkins, who had inherited a Jamaican fortune in 1744. Wood and Dawkins were about to travel to the Levant, where their investigations led to the publication of their well-organized and popular archaeological study <span class="italic">The Ruins of Palmyra</span> (1753). Having received financial support from Dawkins, as well as valuable professional advice from Wood, Stuart and Revett left Rome for Athens in 1750. They were delayed in Venice, where Sir James Gray procured their election to the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92790', "Society of Dilettanti")</script>, whose members subscribed to their proposed publication. From Venice they travelled to Pola in Istria, where they made the first accurate drawings of the two Roman temples, triumphal arch, and amphitheatre, described by Stuart as &#145;built in the most exquisite taste of the Augustan Age&#146;  (Wiebenson, 80). Their reconstruction of the Corinthian temple of Rome and Augustus at Pola was used by Sir James Gray's brother Colonel George Gray as the model for a proposed clubhouse for the Society of Dilettanti in Cavendish Square in 1753. This serves to remind us that neither Stuart and Revett, nor the Society of Dilettanti, was limited to the exclusive study and promotion of Greek architecture.<br>
<br>Between leaving Pola in November 1750 and departing for Greece in January 1751 Stuart and Revett issued in Venice a manuscript called &#145;Proposal for publishing a new accurate description of the antiquities, &amp;c. in the province of Attica&#146;. In a later printed version of this, they claimed that &#145;Artists who aim at perfection, must be more pleased and better instructed, the nearer they approach the Fountain-Head of their art&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Antiquities of Athens</span>, 1, 1762, v n.), thus expressing the belief of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment in the return to first principles and in the creative link between the study of archaeology and the practice of art and architecture.<br>
<br>In March 1751 Stuart and Revett finally arrived in Athens where opportunities for investigating the major monuments of the Acropolis were restricted by the presence of the Turkish garrison on its southern ridge. Everywhere they aroused suspicion and were taken for spies. Stuart was eventually forced to leave Athens in September 1753 during the riots that took place following the death of Osman, chief of the black eunuchs. Stuart was involved in a violent quarrel in which he knocked down a Greek official, and on a similar occasion was nearly murdered by a gang of Turkish cut-throats. He travelled from Athens to Salonica, where he was joined in January 1754 by Revett, with whom he revisited the Aegean Islands, including Delos, but an outbreak of plague prevented them from returning to Athens to continue their studies. They returned in October 1754 to London, where they prepared their drawings for publication, meanwhile living in the house of James Dawkins.<h2>
<a name="TheantiquitiesofAthens"></a>The antiquities of Athens</h2>Europe awaited with interest, but Winckelmann, in particular, expressed signs of impatience because their first volume was not published until 1762. <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Athens Measured and Delineated by James Stuart, F.R.S. and F.S.A., and Nicholas Revett, Painters and Architects</span>, dedicated to George III, consisted of Revett's measured drawings with a text and attractive topographical views by Stuart, which began as coloured gouaches but were reproduced as black and white engravings. The delay had led to disagreement between the two men, as a result of which Stuart bought out Revett's financial interest before publication, though their joint names appeared on the title-pages of all the volumes.<br>
<br>The reason for the delay was not only Stuart's laziness, but his decision at the last moment to undertake a substantial revision of the text by correcting the errors in Julien-David Leroy's <span class="italic">Les ruines des plus beaux monuments de la Gr&egrave;ce</span> (1758), the first scholarly illustrated account of the buildings of fifth-century Athens. This delay also had the unfortunate result of making him forgo his plan to return to Athens to make a detailed study of the buildings on the Acropolis. Stuart's main quarrel with Leroy, whose book had, to his annoyance, deprived him of the distinction of being the first to publish an accurate survey of Greek architecture, was that Leroy had misidentified a portico or stoa in Athens as a fragment of the temple of Olympian Zeus, the Olympeion. We now know that this building was part of the library of Hadrian, and it is significant that, with the exception of the temple on the Ilissus, all but one of the six buildings in the first volume of <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Athens</span> were not Greek but comparatively minor monuments of either the Hellenistic or Roman periods.<br>
<br>Stuart, indeed, seemed to feel that everything in Greece was Greek. He thus explained that the third volume would include:<blockquote>buildings erected after the time that Athens became subject to the Romans. For though deprived of its liberty, and greatly fallen from its ancient splendour, it was still a respectable City, to which the principal men of Rome sent their Sons for education; it still produced Artists, and had a taste for magnificence. (<span class="italic">The Antiquities of Athens</span>, 2, 1787, advertisement)</blockquote>He also attempted to explain the modesty and late date of the buildings in the first volume by claiming that, in the event of there being no demand from the public for further volumes, then at least they &#145;might find in it something interesting on the different Grecian modes of decorating Buildings&#146;  (ibid.). Stuart has sometimes been credited with producing a manifesto for an architectural style based exclusively on that of classical Greece; certainly he became known in his lifetime as Athenian Stuart. However, neither his books nor his buildings really bear this out: his aim was not to replace the Roman orders but to extend them. His eight years in Rome tend to be neglected because of his famous but briefer stay in Athens. The view of Stuart as an architect with an exclusively Greek mission was largely formed at the peak of the nineteenth-century Greek revival, when its promoters, architects such as Robert Smirke and William Wilkins, were anxious to create a respectable ancestry for the movement.<br>
<br>In 1770 Leroy produced a second edition of his <span class="italic">Les ruines des plus beaux monuments de la Gr&egrave;ce</span>, in which he, in turn, criticized Stuart and Revett's first volume for having as its sole aim the provision of exact measurements, and for the fact that, in Stuart's gouache views, the monuments were obscured by lesser objects. Stuart had certainly opened himself to criticism by his stress on &#145;the different methods of decorating buildings&#146;, which implied that he was concerned with enlarging the existing stock of decorative motifs rather than initiating a radical architectural form. Leroy was, however, somewhat unfair to Stuart, who did promote a serious, culturally contingent interpretation of Greece in which work carried out &#145;while the Athenians were a free people&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Antiquities of Athens</span>, 2, 1787, advertisement), particularly in the time of Pericles, was seen as necessarily superior to that produced when they were subjugated by Rome.<h2>
<a name="Earlyarchitecturalcommissions"></a>Early architectural commissions</h2>On his return from Greece, Stuart was showered with commissions from members of the Society of Dilettanti, although he seemed to lack the application to bring them all to a successful conclusion. In 1758 he was appointed surveyor of Greenwich Hospital, a post worth &pound;200 a year for which he was indebted to the recommendation of his future patron Lord Anson. In 1763 he became painter to the Society of Dilettanti, who instructed him in that year to paint portraits of James and Henry Dawkins; having failed to produce them by 1768, he was forced to relinquish his post to Reynolds. In 1764 he succeeded Hogarth as sergeant painter in the office of works, and exhibited for several years at the Free Society of Artists, showing mainly watercolour drawings of Athens.<br>
<br>An important early monument was the garden temple which Stuart designed in 1758 for George Lyttelton, the first Baron Lyttelton at Hagley Park, Worcestershire, as a miniature echo of the Theseion in Athens. Executed in 1759, it was the first since the ancient world to incorporate the fluted baseless columns of the Greek Doric order. Stressing its role as a picturesque object in the landscape, Lord Lyttelton wrote to the bluestocking Mrs Montagu, &#145;Stuart is going to embellish one of the Hills with a true attick building, a portico of six pillars, which will make a fine effect to my new house and command a most beautiful view of the country&#146;  (Blunt, 2.150).<br>
<br>This theme recurred at Shugborough, the Staffordshire estate of Thomas Anson, a founder member of the Society of Dilettanti in 1732, who inherited a fortune in 1762 from his elder brother Admiral Lord Anson, the naval hero. With the help, first of Thomas Wright, and then of Stuart from about 1761 to 1771, the Anson brothers turned the park into an Enlightenment vision of world architecture, reflecting the taste of the eighteenth century for the monuments of different cultures, east and west. Gardens such as Shugborough, Hagley, Stowe, and Stourhead became a kind of memory theatre, reflecting intellectual and cultural voyages. With its Greek, Gothic, Roman, and Chinese buildings, Shugborough was, indeed, a visual parallel to the actual circumnavigation of the globe undertaken by Admiral Anson. The buildings included a version of the choragic monument of Lysicrates in Athens, Stuart's favourite building, although it was not of the fifth century <span class="smallcap">BC</span>, but a whimsical ornamental folly of the late fourth century. Its fanciful quality perhaps made it seem appropriate for imitation as a modern garden folly. Stuart also provided versions of two other monuments in Athens, the Tower of the Winds and Hadrian's Arch, the latter erected by Hadrian as a demonstration of his devotion to ancient Athenian culture.<br>
<br>Nathaniel Curzon, created Baron Scarsdale in 1761, and subscriber to the first volume of <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Athens</span>, consulted Stuart about 1757 concerning the design of interiors in which to display his collection of paintings and sculpture at Kedleston Hall, Derbyshire. Stuart produced attractive coloured drawings for interiors, including Greek tripods as painted wall decoration, as incense burners on chimney-pieces, as candelabra in front of mirrors, and in friezes above doors. He based these on his restoration of the metal tripod on the choragic monument of Lysicrates. Adam, who saw the drawings in December 1758, described them as &#145;so excessively &amp; so ridiculously bad, that &hellip; they move pity rather than contempt&#146;  (Clerk of Penicuik MS 4854, NA Scot.). None the less, when he supplanted Stuart at Kedleston about 1760, he borrowed much from Stuart's designs.<h2>
<a name="WimbledonParkandSpencerHousefrom1758"></a>Wimbledon Park and Spencer House (from 1758)</h2>Viscount Spencer, also a subscriber to <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Athens</span>, created Earl Spencer in 1765 and elected a member of the Society of Dilettanti in the same year, employed Stuart to provide fashionable new interiors at the family house, Wimbledon Park, Surrey (<i>c</i>.1758; dem.), following his marriage in 1756. At the same time, he began to build, from designs by the Palladian architect John Vardy, Spencer House, a magnificent town mansion in Green Park with a decorative programme celebrating themes of love and marriage. Vardy was dismissed in September 1758 on the suggestion of Colonel George Gray, founding member and secretary of the Society of Dilettanti, who had been asked by Spencer to supervise the design for the house. Gray brought in Stuart to make the house more authentically classical. In the Great Room, Stuart designed a chimney-piece incorporating a figured frieze based on that of the choragic monument of Lysicrates with its dancing Bacchantes. More remarkably, in both the Great Room and adjacent Painted Room, he exercised total control, designing the architectural joinery such as dados and door frames, the chimney-pieces, picture frames, seat furniture, pier glasses, and tables, mostly in a version of the contemporary French <i>go&ucirc;t grec</i> manner.<br>
<br>One of the richest rooms in eighteenth-century England, the Painted Room shows the inadequacy of his description as Athenian Stuart, for during his eight years in Rome he had clearly absorbed the ancient Roman grotesque or arabesque type of decoration which had been revived in Renaissance Italy by Raphael and Vasari. None the less, the jealous Adam said of Stuart's ceilings at Spencer House, &#145;they may be Greek to the teeth but by God they are not handsome&#146;  (J. Fleming, <span class="italic">Robert Adam and his Circle</span>, 1962, 258). The bay at the south end of the Painted Room is separated by a screen of Corinthian columns inspired by the temple of Antoninus and Faustina in Rome, but carrying a Greek anthemion frieze based on the Erechtheion on the Acropolis. Between the columns stood Stuart's torch&egrave;res, nearly 7 feet high and important as some of the earliest furniture decorated with painted panels in a manner later developed by Adam. Painted with Pompeian winged figures of Victory, the stands are surmounted by winged griffins supporting ormolu tripods with candle sconces and a central incense burner, inspired by the tripod on the choragic monument of Lysicrates, but recalling the ancient Roman practice of burning incense during dinner parties. Stuart's sofas, designed to fit into the curve of the apse, are also neo-antique, with winged lions inspired by those on Hellenistic marble thrones.<br>
<br>Work at Spencer House proceeded with Stuart's characteristic slowness, though partly because of his other commissions, such as Holdernesse House (later Londonderry House; dem.) and Lichfield House. His work from about 1760 to 1765 at Holdernesse House was carried out for the fourth earl of Holdernesse, who belonged to the Society of Dilettanti, the members of which frequently met in it. It contained ceilings inspired by plates in Wood's <span class="italic">The Ruins of Palmyra</span>, as does Lichfield House, St James's Square, which Stuart built in 1764&#150;6 for Thomas Anson of Shugborough. With the first stone-fronted fa&ccedil;ade in the square, its composition is purely Palladian, yet it sports immaculate Greek Ionic capitals which are life-size copies of those on the Erechtheion, though Stuart did not include the rich frieze which surmounts them in the original.<h2>
<a name="PortmanSquarefrom1775"></a>Portman Square (from 1775)</h2>In 1775 Stuart was commissioned by Mrs Montagu to build her a free-standing mansion in Portman Square which, despite its dull fa&ccedil;ade, attracted so much interest that she arranged for it to be opened to the public by ticket. Excited by Stuart's Athenian reputation, visitors saw what they wanted to see; the poet James &#145;Hermes&#146; Harris exclaimed, &#145;I have seen an edifice which for the time made me imagine I was at Athens, in a house of Pericles, built by Phidias&#146;  (Blunt, 2.100). However, the interiors were Adamesque, thus showing that Stuart's rivalry with Adam had ended in victory for Adam, for Stuart had failed to produce a style of his own. Mrs Montagu praised the house in 1780 as &#145;so convenient and cheerful as a place of retirement, so ample for the devoirs of Society, and so calculated for Assemblies that it will suit all one's humours, and adapt itself to all one's purposes&#146;  (ibid., 2.103). This is in harmony with the eighteenth-century belief in the creation of appropriate character in architecture, with interior design and furniture expressing the personality of the patron. Stuart responded by providing the house with a unique plan in which a group of five intercommunicating rooms for entertaining opened off the main staircase, with a virtually separate apartment for Mrs Montagu at the south end with her own staircase. Stuart's indolence and drinking habits had made him unreliable by the late 1780s; the interior of the ballroom, recalling that in an Italian palazzo, was executed after his death from designs by Joseph Bonomi in 1789&#150;90.<h2>
<a name="Otherworks"></a>Other works</h2>In his capacity as surveyor of Greenwich Hospital, Stuart replaced the chapel, built in the 1730s by Thomas Ripley, after its destruction by fire in 1779. His assistant William Newton, author of the first English translation of Vitruvius, claimed that he had designed most of it himself, which seems unlikely, although he completed it in 1788 after Stuart's death. The plasterwork has a rich succulence going beyond fifth-century Athens towards the freedom of Palmyra, with a crispness and stiffness about the details which seem characteristically Stuartian. Although the chapel is prettily coloured, Stuart seems to have been unaware of the importance of polychromy in Greek architecture: he certainly noted a trace of colour on the frieze of the Ionic temple on the River Ilissus in Athens in the first volume of <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Athens</span>, but drew no conclusions from this. It was only after about 1810 that scholars began to suppose that polychromy may have been integral to the design of Greek architecture.<br>
<br>Stuart was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and of the Society of Antiquaries, and long remained active in the affairs of the Society of Dilettanti. As well as his architectural practice, limited chiefly to sophisticated interiors and garden buildings, he designed furniture, medals, and numerous monuments. Mostly executed by Peter Scheemakers and his son Thomas, his monuments include those in Westminster Abbey to the third Viscount Howe (<i>d</i>. 1758) and to Admiral Charles Watson (<i>d</i>. 1775). One of the finest is that of 1766 to the first earl of Hardwicke, at Wimpole church, Cambridgeshire, incorporating a handsome Grecian <i>Minerva</i>.<br>
<br>The second volume of <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Athens</span>, dated 1787 but not published until January 1790, was published by Stuart's widow, Elizabeth, with help from William Newton. Stuart had also left materials for the third volume, which appeared in 1795 under the editorship of the architect Willey Reveley, who included in it a lengthy defence of Greek architecture from the sharp criticisms of it by Sir William Chambers. With this volume the series as envisaged by Stuart and Revett may be said to have been concluded. However, in 1816 a fourth volume of miscellaneous drawings, principally of the Roman antiquities at Pola, but including valuable plates of the Parthenon sculpture, was issued by Josiah Taylor, the architectural publisher who had acquired Stuart's papers about 1809. It contained a memoir of Stuart by Joseph Woods (1776&#150;1864), a scholar and minor Greek revival architect. A final supplementary volume appeared in 1830 under the distinguished editorship of C. R. Cockerell (1788&#150;1863) as <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Athens and other Places of Greece, Sicily etc.</span>
<h2>
<a name="Privatelifeanddeath"></a>Private life and death</h2>Stuart was twice married, on the first occasion to someone variously described as his housekeeper and as a &#145;Grecian lady&#146;, and on the second, at the age of sixty-seven, to a woman of twenty named Elizabeth, with whom he had five children, of whom three survived him. He had been &#145;very infirm for some years preceding his death, [and] left his papers in great confusion and disorder&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Antiquities of Athens</span>, 2, 1787, iii). By the 1780s he &#145;regularly frequented a public-house on the north side of Leicester-fields, of the sign of the feathers&#146;, while &#145;his face declared him to be fond of what is called friendly society&#146;  (J. T. Smith, <span class="italic">Nollekens and his Times</span>, 1929, 27). His rather idle existence was sustained by a private fortune, for, according to a contemporary report, &#145;Athens Stuart, unexpectedly to most people, has died possessed of much property, chiefly on mortgage on new buildings in Marybone&#146;  (<span class="italic">The World</span>, 22 Feb 1788). His death had taken place suddenly on 2 February 1788 at his house on the south side of Leicester Square, London. He was buried in the crypt of St Martin-in-the-Fields.<h2>
<a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>Stuart exercised a wide influence on British architects, though they tended to ignore his advice to follow the principles not the details of Greek architecture. James Wyatt produced an inspired version of the Tower of the Winds at Athens at the Radcliffe Observatory, Oxford (1776&#150;94), but early nineteenth-century architects such as Robert Smirke, John Foster, and William and Henry William Inwood incorporated into their buildings replicas of works such as the choragic monument of Lysicrates, based on plates in <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Athens</span>. John Soane frequently put the baseless Greek Doric order, whether fluted or unfluted, to powerful effect, while William Wilkins, at Grange Park, Hampshire (1809), provided the most complete templar house ever erected in Britain.<br>
<br>James Elmes, whose St John's Chapel, Chichester, Sussex (1812&#150;13), was an early use of the Lysicrates model for a church tower, claimed boldly in 1847 that, &#145;No event that ever occurred in the history of architecture in England, and thence throughout all Europe, produced so sudden, decided, and beneficial effect as did the works of James Stuart&#146;  (<span class="italic">Civil Engineers' and Architects' Journal</span>, 10, 1847, 338&#150;9). If this interpretation cannot exactly be sustained today, it is significant for revealing how Stuart was regarded at the time; his reputation has, moreover, remained high.<br>
