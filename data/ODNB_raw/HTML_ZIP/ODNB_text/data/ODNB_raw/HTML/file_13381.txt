<span class="headword">Hoard,  Samuel</span>  (1599&#150;1658/9), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious writer</span>, was born in London. In 1614, aged fifteen, he became a clerk or chorister at All Souls College, Oxford, where he matriculated aged eighteen on 10 October 1617. After migrating to St Mary Hall he graduated BA on 20 April 1618, and proceeded MA on 25 January 1621, being incorporated at Cambridge the following year. By 1622 Hoard was curate and lecturer at St Christopher-le-Stocks, London, for on 22 August that year he and John Blackwell were cited before the London consistory court and ordered to produce documents empowering them to officiate in that church; there is no evidence of subsequent action in their case. As a chaplain of Robert Rich, earl of Warwick, Hoard was presented to the rectory of Moreton, Essex, in 1625. By 1628 he had married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1645/6), whose other name is unknown. A son, Samuel, baptized on 2 December 1628, died young, as did his sister, Mary, baptized on 12 July 1631, but Grace, baptized on 31 October 1632, survived; ten other children were born between 1633 and 1645 or 1646.<br>
<br>With other ministers patronized by Warwick, Hoard supported Thomas Hooker when the latter's conformity was questioned in 1629, and he proceeded BD on 15 June 1630. By 1633 Hoard had forsaken his Calvinist principles and embraced Arminian tenets, a decision he explained in <span class="italic">Gods Love to Man-Kinde</span> (1633). Repudiating the reformed doctrine of predestination as a novelty with little or no acceptance in antiquity and citing its alleged affinity with Manichaean fatalism, he asserted that it dishonoured God by making him the author of sin and responsible for the eternal torment of sinners. By abdicating human responsibility the doctrine undermined government, he asserted. It was contrary to such divine attributes as holiness, mercy, and justice as well as antithetical to the purpose of the word and sacraments, and it hindered efforts to pursue a holy life while encouraging despair. John Davenant, bishop of Salisbury, responded in <span class="italic">Animadversions &hellip; upon a Treatise Intitled &#145;Gods Love to Mankind&#146;</span> (1641), accusing Hoard of promiscuously extending the scope of God's love and thereby obscuring his special mercy to the elect. Another refutation came from William Twisse in <span class="italic">The Riches of Gods Love</span> (1653), which included a critical examination of material apparently appended to Hoard's book by the London minister Henry Mason. Subsequent editions of <span class="italic">Gods Love to Man-Kinde</span> were published in 1635, 1656, and 1673, and the book's thesis was incorporated in a debate between Edward Reynolds and Thomas Pierce of Magdalen College, Oxford.<br>
<br>Dedicated to Warwick, Hoard's second book, <span class="italic">The Soules Misery and Recoverie</span> (1636; 2nd edn, 1658), was a lengthy disquisition on <span class="roman">Ephesians</span> 4: 30 in which he explained how Christians could avoid offending God by presumptuous, deliberate sins. He followed this with <span class="italic">The Churches Authority Asserted</span> (1637), a sermon preached at Chelmsford, Essex, on the occasion of Archbishop William Laud's visitation on 1 March 1637. Seeking to diminish confusion and disorder in the church, which he deemed the root of heresy and schism, he defended the church's right to impose &#145;a compleate and cheerfull <i>conformity</i>&#146;  (p. 65) even though ceremonies were not part of the substance of religion. Ministers, he insisted, must conform in doctrine and practice and teach their parishioners to do so as well. An accomplished debater, he was well read in the patristics and scholastics. On 29 March 1637 Hoard was collated to the prebend of Wilsden at St Paul's, London.<br>
<br>In the 1640s Hoard lost his prebend but was not sequestrated from his living. Following his death on 15 February 1658 or 1659, he was buried in the chancel at Moreton. In his will, dated 8 March 1657 and proved on 20 April 1659, he anticipated bequests from the sale of his property totalling &pound;868. By this time his eldest daughter, Grace, had married Nathaniel Eyre. His eldest surviving son, William (<i>bap</i>. 9 Aug 1637), after studying at Eton College, had been admitted to King's College, Cambridge, in 1656. He graduated BA in 1660, was ordained on 20 September 1662, and proceeded MA in 1663. He was a fellow at King's from 1659 to 1669, and served as vicar of Sturminster, Dorset, from 8 January 1666 until his death some time before 12 October 1670.<br>
