<span class="headword">Holditch,  Abraham</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1639, <em>d.</em> 1678), <span class="occ">naval officer and merchant adventurer</span>, was baptized on 12 May 1639 at Totnes, Devon. He was probably the son of William Holditch (<i>d</i>. 1646?) and his wife, Agnes (<i>bap</i>. 1617), formerly Jakes. He married at St Magnus the Martyr, London, on 13 November 1661 Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1644, <i>d</i>. 1702), daughter of Nathaniel Morecock.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Holditch's early naval career prior to 1661 when he commanded the <i>Sophia</i>, one of the squadron led to the Gambia by Robert Holmes in search of goldmines. He is presumed to have accompanied Holmes on his second expedition to west Africa, and was appointed lieutenant on the <i>Revenge</i> on 14 March 1665, during the Second Anglo-Dutch War. After the battle off Lowestoft Holditch commanded several men-of-war before joining the Royal African Company. In the navy Holditch was regarded as a &#145;fitt man&#146; and &#145;stout&#146;  (NMM, LBK/47), suitable for appointment by the duke of York to be captain of the <i>Mars</i> at the age of twenty-six. In 1671 he was sent by the Royal African Company to recover Cape Coast Castle, in Guinea, their west African headquarters which had been lost in a local insurrection. The success of the mission, for which he was awarded &pound;500, was significant both for the company and for the subsequent development of the nation's trade. Holditch remained at the castle for a year as the company's agent-general.<br>
<br>In 1674 Holditch offered to command a ship to deter private trade on the Gold Coast and convey slaves to the West Indies, and in each of the following three years he was elected to the company's court of assistants, during which time he declined the offer of a second tour of duty as agent-general. He was active in the company's affairs, contributing his specialist knowledge to its administration until he was appointed chief searcher of London port shortly before his death, which occurred early in 1678. He was buried at St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney, on 7 February. His widow later married John Chambers.<br>
<br>Holditch's son Richard became a director of the South Sea Company. His daughter Agnes (1671?&#150;1749) married in 1689 <a name="cosubject_62537"></a><span class="headword">John Strong</span>  (<em>c.</em>1654&#150;1693); they had no children. Strong, a <span class="occ">privateer and treasure seeker</span>, was chief mate of the <i>James and Mary</i>, commanded by William Phipps, which in 1687 recovered treasure from a ship wrecked off the coast of Hispaniola. In 1689, armed with a royal commission, he sailed as commander of the <i>Welfare</i> to recover a Spanish treasure ship, the 1200 ton <i>Capitana Jes&uacute;s Maria de la Limpia Concepci&oacute;n</i>, sunk in 1654 off the west coast of South America. He made the first undisputed landing on the Falkland Islands, giving the name of Falkland Sound to the channel between the two main islands. Strong passed through the Strait of Magellan in winter, with great difficulty and danger. He failed to find the ship and lost eleven men killed ashore; the capture of two prizes near Ireland on the way home was meagre compensation for his failure, for when the wreck was located in 1997 its bounty was estimated at &pound;2.5 billion  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 26 March 1997, 15d&#150;h). Strong died at La Coru&ntilde;a on a voyage to the West Indies on 11 November 1693.<br>
