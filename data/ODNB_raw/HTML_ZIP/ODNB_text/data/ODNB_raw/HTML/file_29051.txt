<span class="headword">Wentworth,  Peter</span>  (1524&#150;1597), <span class="occ">member of parliament</span>, was the first son born to Sir Nicholas Wentworth (<i>d</i>. 1553) of Lillingstone Lovell, Oxfordshire, chief porter of Calais, and his wife, Jane, daughter of John Josselyn of Hyde Hall, Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire. His early life remains obscure. Both Peter Wentworth and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29050/', "Paul Wentworth (1534&#150;1594)")</script> became famous for their interventions on the issues of parliamentary privilege, freedom of speech, and the succession to the crown. Trained at Lincoln's Inn, Peter entered parliament rather late in life, being selected for the first time in 1571 to represent Barnstaple. He sat for the Cornish borough of Tregony in 1572, and for the town of Northampton in the parliaments of 1586&#150;7, 1589, and 1593. Wentworth owed his seat at Tregony to the influence of the second earl of Bedford, a well-known supporter of radical protestants. His sister Clare had been a Marian exile, and it is likely that Wentworth shared such views. His first wife, Lettice, was a daughter of Sir Ralph Lane of Horton, Northamptonshire, first cousin of Queen Katherine Parr. His second marriage, to Elizabeth Walsingham (<i>d</i>. 1596), made the anti-Catholic secretary Sir Francis Walsingham his brother-in-law. In 1579 the privy council investigated a complaint that a puritan minister was administering the sacraments out of Wentworth's house at Lillingstone Lovell, similarly suggestive of radical protestantism.<br>
<br>However, Wentworth was not a central figure in the key religious agitations of the parliaments in which he sat. He was certainly opposed to overbearing episcopal authority. In 1571 Wentworth was a member of a Commons delegation appointed to explain their omission of non-doctrinal articles (such as the reading of homilies and the consecration of bishops) from a bill confirming the articles of religion. Questioned by Archbishop Parker, Wentworth defended the omission on the grounds that the committee had not had the time to compare the articles with the scriptures. Parker insisted that this was a matter best left to the bishops. Wentworth would have none of it. &#145;Noe, by the faith I beare to God, wee will pass nothing before we understand what it is, for that were but to make yow popes&#146;  (Hartley, <span class="italic">Proceedings</span>, 1.432). Here Wentworth was defending the Commons' right to legislate on religious matters. Indeed, he noted that experienced MPs had informed him that the most important laws governing the protestant religion in England had been initiated in the lower house. This does not make Wentworth a puritan, but it indicates the strength of his commitment to the protestant cause, which was to form the overwhelming concern of his public life.<br>
<br>Like so many MPs Wentworth was engaged with the agitation over Mary, queen of Scots, and Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk, in the first session of the parliament of 1572. He frequently urged their execution, and was clearly frustrated by the delay in ordering the duke's execution and by the queen's stalling on the fate of Mary Stuart. Her failure to approve the Commons' bill against Mary deeply distressed Wentworth. In his view, by ignoring their advice the queen had abused her people. This was the argument he advanced on the very first day of the new session in 1576. Wentworth must have taken everyone by surprise by offering a premeditated speech with the resounding introductory proposal: &#145;Sweet indeed is the name of libertye and the thing it selfe a value beyond all inestimable treasure&#146;  (Hartley, <span class="italic">Proceedings</span>, 1.425). Wentworth argued that without the ability to speak freely, parliament would become simply &#145;a very schoole of flattery and dissimulacion and soe a fitt place to serve the Devil&#146;  (ibid., 426). Two particular things prevented free speech. The first were rumours, such as &#145;the Queen's Majestie liketh not of such a matter&#146; or that she liked a matter and would be offended by any who opposed it. The second impediment was the bringing of messages into the house &#145;either of commandinge or inhibiting&#146;  (ibid., 426, 427). In a speech punctuated with biblical references, Wentworth argued that MPs had to be able to speak freely properly to fulfil their constitutional role of advising the monarch and making laws. By resisting their legislative endeavours, the queen had put herself and the state in danger. At this point Wentworth was stopped in his tracks. On the order of the house he was taken into custody, examined by a committee, and imprisoned in the Tower. There he remained until the queen ordered his return two days before the end of the session.<br>
<br>As its editor has remarked, the speech's most &#145;theoretically challenging part of the argument was denied the House&#146;  (Hartley, <span class="italic">Elizabeth's Parliaments</span>, 131). Wentworth did not seem to object to Elizabeth's deciding the parliamentary agenda, but rather her curtailing their ability to speak freely once summoned. His speech was no resounding call for the Commons to play a central constitutional role, but it certainly made the claim that, to fulfil their function, MPs had to be able to speak their mind. Indeed, in his closing section Wentworth directed his anger against those MPs who voted against matters for which they had spoken, and at the apparently common custom of waiting to see which way the more prominent members were voting in order to follow suit. The same preoccupation explains his vicious personal attack on Sir Humphrey Gilbert who had criticized Speaker Bell in 1571 for raising the issue of the queen's granting of monopolies.<br>
<br>In 1586&#150;7 Wentworth asked the speaker to put a number of leading questions to the house. Designed to be answered in the affirmative, the questions would have confirmed MPs' freedom of speech, prevented the reporting of words and actions to the queen, and stopped the speaker from interrupting speeches. However, his questions were never answered. Speaker Puckering simply pocketed them and informed the council, with the result that Wentworth found himself once again temporarily in the Tower.<br>
<br>Wentworth's remaining days as a parliament man focused on the issue that lay at the heart of his concerns over religion and the security of England: the succession. Soon after Mary Stuart's execution in 1587, Wentworth drafted <span class="italic">A Pithie Exhortation to her Majestie for Establishing her Successor to the Crowne</span>. He hoped to offer it in the parliament of 1589, but, having failed in that ambition, Wentworth lobbied for its presentation to the queen and found himself in temporary confinement once again. He was quite incorrigible, and his meeting with several MPs before the parliament of 1593 to discuss how they might pursue the subject in the Commons turned out to be a fateful decision. Wentworth found himself back in the Tower, and there he remained until his death. He never wavered in his belief that it was better to offer his queen a faithful lover's wounds, as he put it in 1576, than dissemble and flatter and offer her &#145;a detestable Judas his kisse&#146;  (Hartley, <span class="italic">Proceedings</span>, 1.428). Indeed, Wentworth took the opportunity of his imprisonment in the Tower to write against Doleman's tract on the succession. His response, <span class="italic">A Discourse Containing the Author's Opinion of the True and Lawful Successor to her Majesty</span>, was published alongside <span class="italic">A Pithie Exhortation</span> a year after his death.<br>
<br>Wentworth and his second wife, Elizabeth, had five daughters and four sons, including Walter and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29055/', "Thomas Wentworth (1567/8&#150;1628)")</script> who both sat in later parliaments. Elizabeth was given permission to live with her husband in the Tower where she died in July 1596. Wentworth himself died there on 10 November 1597. Shortly before his death he composed a poem entitled &#145;The causes of my longe imprisonmente&#146; in which he quipped:<blockquote>
<div>Syth I have said, and done my best<br>
</div>
<div>meekly wth prayer, god grant me rest.<br>
</div> (BL, Egerton MS 3139B)</blockquote>Although his parliamentary agitations came to little, they led Wentworth to offer theoretical positions of some novelty and importance.<br>
