</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Drummond,  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1730&#150;1795), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born about 1730, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8087/', "William Drummond, fourth viscount of Strathallan (1690&#150;1746)")</script>, and his wife, Margaret (1692&#150;1773), the daughter of Lord William Murray, later Lord Nairne. He was one of at least thirteen children. In 1744, with his brother Robert, he was entrusted to the care of his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47581/', "Andrew Drummond (1688&#150;1769)")</script>. His father, who had taken part in the 1715 Jacobite rising, joined Prince Charles Edward Stuart in 1745 and commanded the Jacobite forces in Scotland during the period of the advance into England; he was killed at the battle of Culloden in April 1746.<br>
<br>Henry Drummond was employed in his uncle's banking business in Charing Cross, London, from 1749, and during the Seven Years' War he acted as agent to the 42nd (the Black Watch), 46th, 87th, and 89th regiments of foot. In 1763 he was financial agent for New Jersey, and from 1764 he was associated with the army agent <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45706/', "Richard Cox (1718&#150;1803)")</script>. He went into partnership with Cox from premises in Craig's Court, Whitehall, in 1765. The two men acted as joint paymasters to the Royal Artillery from 1766 and by 1771 had eighteen regiments on their books. From 1767 Drummond was also involved in the contract for the payment of the British forces in North America, and in 1770 replaced his cousin John (1723&#150;1774) in the partnership with Thomas Harley (1730&#150;1804).<br>
<br>Drummond joined his brother Robert and cousin John as a partner in the family banking firm in 1772, from which time his partnership with Cox ceased, although they continued to have a business connection until 1774. From the early 1770s the volume and profits of the banking business increased significantly, and by the time of Drummond's death in 1795 the firm had almost 3200 accounts&#151;double the number at Andrew Drummond's death in 1769&#151;and average annual profits approaching &pound;30,000.<br>
<br>In December 1774 Drummond purchased a seat in parliament at Wendover, Buckinghamshire, from Lord Verney. He consistently supported Lord North, but by 1777 had become disillusioned over North's policy in North America. In June 1777 Harley and Drummond were given a year's notice of termination of their contract; however, in the event they were able to secure its renewal and extension to the West Indies, and the work continued until 1783. At the 1780 general election, at North's recommendation, Drummond purchased a seat at Midhurst, Sussex. Drummond supported North until his fall, but he was not present at the divisions on Fox's <span class="roman">East India Bill</span>. Being a friend of Henry Dundas (whose daughter Anne married Drummond's son in 1786), he may have followed the latter's political lead, and by 1784 he was listed among Pitt's supporters. He held his seat at Midhurst until 1790.<br>
<br>As a young man Drummond lived at the bank and also had a property at Lawers, Perthshire. Later he acquired a house in St James's Square, London, and owned a country residence, first at Langley Park, Buckinghamshire, and from 1787 The Grange, near Alresford, Hampshire. He married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1819), the daughter of Charles Compton MP (<i>d</i>. 1755) and his wife, Mary, the daughter of Sir Berkeley Lucy, on 23 March 1761; they had two children, Henry (1762&#150;1794) and Anne.<br>
<br>Drummond was a member of &#145;the Gang&#146;, an informal circle of friends which, in addition to his brother Robert, included William Amherst, Thomas Bradshaw, Lord Frederick Campbell, Anthony Chamier, Richard Cox, Thomas Harley, Sir Robert Murray Keith, Richard Rigby, and Sir John Sebright. It started out as a bachelors' monthly dining club and soon became the forum for wild activities and jocular camaraderie. As time went on the friendships matured and extended to incorporate the members' families.<br>
<br>Drummond died on 24 June 1795 at The Grange.<br>
