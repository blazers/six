<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Worrell, Sir  Frank Mortimer Maglinne</span>  (1924&#150;1967), <span class="occ">cricketer</span>, was born at Bridgetown, Barbados, on 1 August 1924, the son of Athelston Worrell, a ship's steward. He was educated at Combermere School, where he was coached by the former test cricketer Derrick Sealy. He first played for the island as a slow left-arm bowler at the age of seventeen, while still at school, but his batting, in which he was right-handed, developed so rapidly that in 1942&#150;3 he scored his first century in first-class cricket, 188 against Trinidad at Port of Spain, and in the following season he played what proved to be the highest innings of his career: 308 not out in an unbroken partnership of 502 with J. D. Goddard, again against Trinidad. This was a world record for the fourth wicket until Worrell and C. L. Walcott surpassed it two seasons later with an unbroken 574, yet again against Trinidad, when Worrell made 255 not out.<br>
<br>In 1947 Worrell left Barbados for Jamaica after failing to get a job at home. In Jamaica he got employment as a clerk, joined Kensington cricket club, and also played football. His international career began against the MCC tourists in 1947&#150;8. He made 294 in three tests, and his 131 not out at Georgetown was the first of his nine test centuries. In 1948 he began a long and happy association with Radcliffe in the central Lancashire league: his aggregate of 1694 (average 112.80) in 1951 was a record for the competition. Between 1948 and 1959 (not every year), he compiled 9103 runs (average 77.14) in league cricket for Radcliffe and later for Norton. While in Radcliffe, he married on 28 May 1948 a fellow Barbadian, Velda Elaine Brewster (<i>b</i>. 1922/3), daughter of Mervyn Brewster, photographer. She and their daughter Lana survived him. With an eye to the future, Worrell graduated BA (Admin) in 1959 at Manchester University.<br>
<br>With many international players taking part, the northern leagues were a stern academy of cricket and Worrell gained valuable experience of English conditions. He learned to play on wickets of varying pace, and he quickened his bowling, relying now on swerve rather than spin. Thus he was well equipped to take his place in the West Indies touring team to England in 1950, which after losing the first test won the remaining three and became the first West Indies team to win a rubber in England. With his lithe elegance, perfect timing, and exquisite footwork, he was one of the celebrated trio&#151;Everton Weekes and Clyde Walcott were the others&#151;of outstanding batsmen in this talented side. He headed the test averages with 539 runs at 89.83, and on the tour he made 1775 at 68.26, with six centuries, as well as taking thirty-nine wickets. His 261 at Nottingham was then the highest individual score for either country in tests against each other in England, while his stand of 283 for the fourth wicket with Weekes was the highest test partnership for the West Indies in any part of the world. It was beaten by himself and Garfield Sobers when they put on 399 against England at Barbados in 1960.<br>
<br>In Australia in 1951&#150;2 the West Indies could not repeat their English success. Worrell, with only 337 in ten test innings, was not the only batsman to be unhappy against the Australians' pace on hard pitches and their use of the short, fast bumper, although he made 108 at Melbourne, batting almost one-handed after an injury. With the disappointment of their high expectations the side's morale collapsed, there was frequent dissension, and they lost four of the five tests. But it was Worrell's most successful series as a bowler; his seventeen wickets at 19.35 included six for 38 at Adelaide in the only test the West Indies won. Home series against India, England, and Australia were, by his own standards, not years of abundance, although he made 237 against India at Kingston in 1953. When the West Indies came to England in 1957, he easily headed the tour averages with 1470 runs at 58.80, and his four centuries included a masterly 191 not out in the third test at Nottingham, when he batted right through the innings. He also took seven wickets for 70 in the fourth test at Leeds. But the tour was a disappointment for the team, whose confidence characteristically disintegrated after the first test slipped from their grasp when they had seemed certain to win it. They were then beaten three times by an innings.<br>
<br>Because of injuries Worrell captained the side in the last four matches of the tour, and he showed qualities of leadership which led, after various internal struggles, to his appointment as captain in Australia in 1960&#150;61. The post had been offered to him twice before but Worrell had rejected it to enable him to complete his studies at Manchester University. His acceptance, in the end, came at a time when the newly independent territories in the Caribbean were looking for black leaders in all walks of life. A remarkable series began with the first tie in the history of test cricket, and although the West Indies eventually lost by two matches to one, the result would have been reversed if two vital decisions had not gone against them. Although personally Worrell had only a moderate tour, his side fulfilled his promise that they would bring back to cricket the spirit of adventure. On their departure Worrell's men received a send-off &#145;normally reserved for Royalty and national heroes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wisden</span>, 1962, 832). The Worrell trophy was instituted to commemorate the Brisbane tie. In the following year, 1961&#150;2, he led the West Indies to a 5&#150;0 victory over India.<br>
<br>Worrell fought his last campaign when he led the West Indies in England in 1963. This was another eventful rubber which the West Indies won 3&#150;1 after a dramatic drawn game at Lord's. Worrell did not do much with the bat, but his 74 not out in 95 minutes at Manchester, with fifteen fours, recalled the player he had been in his vintage years. At the end of the tour he announced his retirement, but he managed the side that defeated the visiting Australians in 1965 and made the West Indies unofficial world champions. In his career he made 15,025 runs at 54.24, with 39 centuries, and took 349 wickets at 28.98. In 51 tests, 25 against England, he made 3860 at 49.48 and took 69 wickets at 38.72.<br>
<br>But although in his prime Worrell was a great batsman, correct yet uninhibited, with a free swing whose delicacy concealed its power, statistics do not measure his contribution to the game. It was he who disciplined the West Indies into an organized force in international cricket. The political, cultural, and ethnic differences of the scattered Caribbean islands had made earlier teams unpredictable and at times almost uncontrollable. Their resolution was easily weakened by disappointment, and insular rivalries had a divisive effect. But under a relaxed and easy manner Worrell inspired his players with his own strength of character and breadth of outlook. His firmness, which at times could be ruthless, prevented the psychological deterioration which had weakened earlier touring sides, and he welded a team of talented but erratic and temperamental players into the finest in the world. In so doing he raised the status and self-respect of black cricketers.<br>
<br>Worrell was a lover of England and a true federalist&#151;in the sense that he believed in the West Indies and did not allow himself to be involved in insular jealousies. He was knighted in 1964. In 1961 he was appointed warden of Irvine Hall, at Mona, near Kingston, in the University College of the West Indies. He described himself, in a BBC interview two years later, as &#145;<i>in loco parentis</i> to students, an administrator responsible for moral welfare and discipline, a personal adviser&#146;  (Tennant, 75). He was also heavily involved in planning sports facilities. He found time to play cricket with an underprivileged boys' club called Boys Town.<br>
<br>In 1962 Worrell was nominated by the prime minister of Jamaica, Sir Alexander Bustamante, to a seat in the country's upper house&#151;the senate. But, beyond two speeches, he contributed little in his two years before leaving Jamaica in 1964 to become dean of students and warden of two halls in that part of the university which was based in Trinidad. The post was similar to that in Jamaica but with more responsibility. He took a strong line on discipline and exercised &#145;enormous moral authority&#146;  (Tennant, 88). There was still some cricket&#151;with five first-class matches in England in 1964&#151;and opportunities to lecture abroad. It was on a visit to India, at the request of the government, that he felt unwell. The University of Punjab had given him an honorary doctorate of laws in February 1967. Five weeks later, on 13 March 1967, he died in the university hospital at Kingston of leukaemia; he was buried in Barbados, where he had bought land for his eventual retirement.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Times</span> declared Worrell would be &#145;remembered as much for his leadership as for his play&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 14 March 1967). His funeral and burial in Barbados were followed by a memorial service in Westminster Abbey, London, the first ever held there for a sportsman. In his memory a fund was set up to benefit young people, in education and in sport, throughout the Commonwealth.<br>
