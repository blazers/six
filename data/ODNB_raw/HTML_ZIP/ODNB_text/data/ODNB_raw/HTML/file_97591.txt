<span class="headword">Gray <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Stanham]</span>,  Patience Jean</span>  (1917&#150;2005), <span class="occ">writer on food</span>, was born on 31 October 1917 at Michen Hall, Shackleford, near Godalming, Surrey, the second of three daughters of Hermann Stanham Stanham, then a major in the Royal Field Artillery, and his wife, Olive Florence, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Colgate, daughter of a Lincolnshire farmer. Late in life she delightedly discovered that her misogynist father, later a surgeon at the London Hospital, then a failed pig-farmer near Basingstoke, and subsequently a photographer with his own studio on the Sussex coast, was actually the son of a rabbi named Warschavski, who had fled persecution in Poland in 1861 and become a Unitarian minister. She and her sisters were brought up in an Edwardian-style household run by servants, where their overbearing father was the only male.<br>
<br>A very bright child, Patience Stanham passed her university entrance examinations at sixteen, but her father felt she was too young to take up her place, so sent her to Bonn to learn German and study economics, which she abandoned in favour of art history. She returned to attend Queen's College in Harley Street, living with her maternal aunt and uncle, as her own family had fallen on hard times. She then took the degree of BSc (Econ) at London University, where her tutor was Hugh Gaitskell. In the summer of 1938 she set off with her sister Tania (who became a photographer) on a mission for the Quakers to establish cultural ties with Romania. When Queen Marie died in July she wrote her first piece of journalism, which appeared in a Bucharest paper; its infatuated editor laid siege to her, filling her hotel room with tuberoses, the scent of which, she said, always filled her with remembered horror. She and her sister escaped his attentions by fleeing to the Black Sea in a monoplane piloted by a Romanian prince.<br>
<br>When the Second World War broke out Stanham was dismissed from the Foreign Office job she had just acquired for, she claimed, &#145;having too many foreign contacts&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Observer</span>, 18 Oct 1987). She had an affair with a married man, Thomas Gray, a Spanish Civil War veteran who ran a clandestine counter-insurgency course for the Home Guard at Hurlingham, London. She was secretary of this school for teaching civilians new skills &#145;such as how to make Molotov cocktails&#146;  (ibid.). When Thomas Gray was conscripted he left her to cope with a son and a daughter in a cottage on the South Downs; she took the name Gray by public announcement in the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> of 17 January 1941.<br>
<br>In 1950&#150;51 Patience Gray worked as research assistant to F. H. K. Henrion on the Festival of Britain. In 1957 Penguin published her <span class="italic">Plats du Jour, or, Foreign Food</span>, a highly successful mass-circulation paperback cookery book, to which her friends Primrose Boyd contributed recipes and David Gentleman the striking illustrations and pink cover. It sold 50,000 copies in its first ten months, with recipes for the sort of sophisticated dishes that chic post-war London hostesses liked to prepare for dinner parties; but it stood the test of time. The next year, following a competition for <span class="italic">The Observer</span> that was said to have attracted a thousand entrants, David Astor told her &#145;unenthusiastically that I had won, and they were prepared to take me on to start a woman's page&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Observer</span>, 18 Oct 1987). At first she reported happily to Nigel Gosling, but in 1961 her next boss, George Seddon, had a different idea of the paper's readership, and she left in 1962, to work as a textile designer.<br>
<br>In 1963 Gray met and fell in love with the sculptor Norman Mommens (1922&#150;2000), whose own marriage was breaking up, and they began their odyssey in search of marble. This was described in her second classic book, <span class="italic">Honey from a Weed: Fasting and Feasting in Tuscany, Catalonia, the Cyclades and Apulia</span> (bravely published in 1987 by Alan Davidson's Prospect Books, for whom it turned out to be a best-seller), and finally ended when, in 1970, Mommens bought the <i>masseria</i> of a tumbledown ruined sheep farm at Spigolizzi in Apulia. Gray settled into the house, which had neither water nor electricity until the 1990s, cultivating her female neighbours to the extent that the local peasants regarded her as the repository of lore about their native edible and medicinal plants. Despite her principled objections to the institution Gray married Mommens in 1994; after his death she continued to live in the <i>masseria</i>, where the courtyard and surrounding fields were scattered with his phallic sculptures.<br>
<br>Gray was a considerable prose stylist. In her writing, as in life, she achieved and celebrated simplicity and elegance. She kept up with her old friends, such as the bibliophile Irving Davis, whose book of recipes she edited in 1967 as <span class="italic">A Catalan Cookery Book: a Collection of Impossible Recipes</span>. In 2000 she published <span class="italic">Work Adventures Childhood Dreams</span>, a collection&#151;arranged in no particular order&#151;of anecdotes about, for instance, T. S. Eliot's envy of Henry James, shopping in Lecce before the advent of supermarkets, Stendhal's travel writing, her enthusiasm for Buster Keaton, and Irving Davis's reincarnation as a bluebottle. She died at Spigolizzi on 10 March 2005, and was survived by her son and daughter.<br>
