<span class="headword">Weston,  Hugh</span>  (<em>c.</em>1510&#150;1558), <span class="occ">dean of Windsor</span>, was born at Burton Overy, Leicestershire. He was educated at Balliol College, Oxford, and St Mary Hall, where he was elected exhibitioner on 21 April 1529, vacating by October 1531. He was fellow of Lincoln College from 1532, sub-rector (1538&#150;9), and rector from 8 January 1539, vacating by August 1556. He was admitted BA on 18 July 1530, incepted MA on 17 February 1533, supplicated BM on 30 May 1537, was admitted BTh on 2 May 1539, incepted DTh in July 1540, and incorporated the last degree at Cambridge in 1554&#150;5. He had an exhibition of the crown in 1537, and was senior proctor in 1537&#150;8. From 1542 to about 1551 he was Lady Margaret professor of divinity. Lincoln College presented him to the free chapel of Petsoe, Buckinghamshire, to which he was instituted on 3 February 1541 and which he held until death. He became rector of St Nicholas Olave, London, on 15 September 1541, vacating by December 1548. On 17 October 1545 he was collated to the archdeaconry of Cornwall, retained to August 1554. On 21 March 1546 he was instituted rector of his native parish, and on 1 April 1547 he was dispensed for a further benefice.<br>
<br>In September 1549 Weston was arrested in Leicestershire and committed to the Fleet because of his conservative religious views. He was released into Cranmer's custody in the following autumn, in hope of his being converted, but he remained unreformed, and led opposition in London to the archbishop's forty-two articles in May 1552. It is supposed he lost his Oxford chair at the time of his arrest, but payment of his stipend continued for about two years. Mary made him her chaplain and, on 14 September 1553, dean of Westminster. He was installed on 18 September and assisted at the coronation on 1 October. On 16 October he was elected prolocutor of the lower house of the convocation of Canterbury; his <span class="italic">Oratio coram clero</span> was printed. In a sermon at Paul's Cross on 22 October he publicized the eucharistic debate which dominated the session of convocation. On 22 January 1554 he was collated to the archdeaconry of Colchester. On 7 February (Ash Wednesday), when Wyatt's rebels entered London, Weston celebrated mass before the queen at Whitehall, when (by his own admission) he wore armour beneath his vestments. He subsequently attended Wyatt and the duke of Suffolk at their executions. On 3 March he arranged his own presentation by the dean and chapter of Westminster to their principal living, the Oxfordshire rectory of Islip, to which he was admitted on 20 April, and retained to death. On 2 April he was presented by the crown to the rectory of Cliffe-at-Hoo, Kent, where he was instituted on 25 October 1555, and where he remained incumbent until his death.<br>
<br>In April 1554 Weston was reappointed prolocutor of the Canterbury clergy, in order to preside at the disputation in Oxford which would convict Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer of heresy. He opened proceedings with a speech in the church of St Mary the Virgin on 14 April, and chaired the sessions in the divinity school. At times he lost control of the debate, and of his own temper. His conduct earned him much vilification, which subsequent allegations of drunkenness and debauchery appeared to validate. Ridley complained of his not allowing him written submissions as had been promised. Weston pronounced the three bishops excommunicate on 20 April, and returned to London to certify the sentence. Foxe's story that he opened and refused to deliver a letter Cranmer sent with him to the council has been doubted, but it is likely enough that he advocated execution of the adjudged heretics without further process. As a devoted servant of the regime he led public intercessions at the time of the queen's supposed pregnancy; he also composed a prayer to be said by the boys of Westminster School for the occasion  (<span class="italic">STC, 1475&#150;1640</span>, 25291.5). During 1555 he was among the examiners of John Bradford and John Philpot. In the following year he interrogated suspects in the Dudley conspiracy.<br>
<br>In order to make way for the revived monastery at Westminster, Dean Weston and his secular chapter resigned (with some reluctance) on 26 September 1556. But on 8 November the queen appointed him dean of Windsor, and on 5 January 1557 he received the associated office of register of the Order of the Garter. In August 1557 he was deprived of his deanery on a charge of indecency, which he denied. Weston also lost his archdeaconry of Colchester but (apparently at Bonner's instance) retained his parochial livings. He attempted to travel to Rome to appeal against his deprivation, but was arrested and sent to the Tower. On 3 December 1558 Elizabeth released him on medical grounds to the house of William Wynter in Fleet Street, where he died on 8 December and was buried the same day in the Savoy. He made bequests to Oxford University, and to Balliol and Lincoln colleges. The many other beneficiaries included one of the monks of the revived Westminster Abbey, and an old woman of Eton who had brought Weston flowers.<br>
