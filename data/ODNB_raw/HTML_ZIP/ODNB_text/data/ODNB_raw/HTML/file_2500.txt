<span class="headword">Black,  William Henry</span>  (1808&#150;1872), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born on 7 May 1808 at Walworth, Surrey, the eldest son of John Black of Kintore, Aberdeenshire, and Mary Langley. His mother's family, who owned estates in Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire, influenced his strong religious opinions and formed his taste for antiquarian pursuits. He was educated at a private school, and at seventeen years of age became a tutor among families living at Tulse Hill, London, and the surrounding neighbourhood. His first publications were catalogues of the Arundel manuscripts at the College of Arms (1829) and of Colfe's Library at Lewisham (1831) for the Leathersellers' Company. He contributed to Samuel Bentley's <span class="italic">Excerpta historica</span> (1831) and to Sir Richard Colt Hoare's <span class="italic">A History of Modern Wiltshire</span> (1822&#150;44). He was in Oxford between 1831 and 1833 compiling the justly esteemed catalogue, published in 1845, of the Ashmole manuscripts, now in the Bodleian Library. As a reader at the British Museum in London he became acquainted with many literary men, through whose influence in 1834 he obtained a situation in the Record Commission. He claimed to be the first on the scene to save some of the records during the burning of the houses of parliament in the same year, while he was living in Lambeth. At the Record Commission he helped to train transcribers of records, and to revise Rymer's <span class="italic">Foedera</span>, and edited without completing the <span class="italic">Docquets of Letters Patent Charles I</span>, which was eventually published after his death.<br>
<br>In 1840 Black was appointed assistant keeper in the newly established Public Record Office, where among other duties he compiled inventories of the Pells Office records and reported on the Treasury records. He suffered from poor health and thought his eyesight was damaged when attempting to salvage records soaked with sewage in a flood at Treasury Chambers. A strong sabbatarian, his service was terminated in 1853 because of his refusal to work on Saturdays and his work at the Treasury ceased the following year.<br>
<br>Black was a prolific contributor to the journals of antiquarian societies. He issued numerous pamphlets on biblical history, edited three volumes of early English poetry for the Percy Society, and had articles in most issues of the <span class="italic">British Archaeological Association Journal</span> from 1846 to 1872. His edition of the Antonine itinerary in preparation for the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span> was never published.<br>
<br>Black was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1858 and served on the council. Several communications between 1861 and 1871 were reported in the society's <span class="italic">Proceedings</span>, of which the first, on his discovery of Holbein's will, aroused considerable interest. He was also one of the earliest members of the British Archaeological Association, the Surrey, London and Middlesex, and Wiltshire Archaeological societies, and the founder of the Chronological Institute of London, the Palestine Archaeological Association, and the Anglo-Biblical Institute, besides being a member of the Camden Society. As a conscientious and painstaking antiquary, he was highly regarded by his contemporaries.<br>
<br>In 1840 Black was ordained minister of a small congregation of Seventh-Day Baptists, whose chapel was in Mill Yard, Leman Street, Whitechapel, until 1885. He lived in the minister's house at 15 Mill Yard. He associated the church with the Unitarians, but his stress on the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> led to a charge of secret Judaism. He was constantly involved in litigation and in 1851 had heavy damages awarded against him for libelling a fellow Baptist minister. Black was married three times. With his first wife&#151;Elizabeth White, whom he married when he was twenty-two&#151;he had three daughters. In 1841 he married Mary Anne (<i>d</i>. 1843), daughter of Benjamin Noakes, doctor of medicine. In 1844 he married Harriot (<i>d</i>. 1861), daughter of William Slater, formerly a minister at Mill Yard. Black's daughter Theodora married William Mead Jones, his own successor as pastor. He died on 12 April 1872 in Mill Yard.<br>
