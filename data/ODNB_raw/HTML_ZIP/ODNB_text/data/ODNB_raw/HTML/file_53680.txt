<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rachman,  Peter <span class="st"> [Perec]</span></span>  (1920?&#150;1962), <span class="occ">racketeer</span>, was born at Lw&oacute;w, Poland, son of David Rachman, a dental surgeon, who, together with his wife, vanished in the holocaust. After the Nazi invasion of Poland, Rachman was forced onto a road-building chain-gang and later captured by Russians, who starved him. He arrived in Britain as a stateless person about 1945&#150;6. He endured menial jobs (including dishwashing at Bloom's kosher restaurant in Whitechapel) before setting up as a flat-letting agent.<br>
<br>During the 1950s Rachman built a slum empire (chiefly in Paddington and North Kensington) by methods which, when they were exposed after his death, gave the ugly epithet of Rachmanism to the English language. At a time of severe housing shortages he bought properties occupied by tenants paying statutorily controlled rents pegged at 1939 levels. Knowing that rents became decontrolled once tenants vacated their homes, Rachman's technique with a property was to &#145;put in the Schwartzes and de-stat it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, 7 July 1963). He hired black hooligans to intimidate white tenants or white thugs against black tenants and forcibly obtained vacant possession. His profiteering from racial tension contributed to the Notting Hill race riots of 1958. Bullies with alsatians would wrench the doors of communal lavatories off their hinges, cut off gas, water, and electricity, break into flats, destroy furniture, rip up floorboards, and throw out tenants' possessions. Tenants who publicized their grievances were driven into hiding. Once empty, a property's value massively increased. Rachman would then &#145;sweat&#146; the property, either by overcrowding it with Caribbean immigrants, or by leasing it at exorbitant rents to brothel-keepers or club-owners. Typically he was able to collect &pound;10,000 a year in rent for a house which cost him &pound;1500. Later the property could be sold to shady associates. Rachman exploited flaws that existed until 1961&#150;2 in the <span class="roman">Companies Act</span>, the <span class="roman">Rent Act</span> of 1957, and housing regulations. He controlled a proliferation of interlocking companies (fronted by nominee directors) so that sanitary notices, certificates of disrepair, and compulsory acquisitions were frustrated by the impossibility of identifying the beneficial owner of the property. Companies were wound up, and the properties reassigned to other companies, in order to keep a defective drain festering and drive out the statutory tenants. The Metropolitan Police, Ministry of Housing, borough councils, public health authorities, and rent tribunals all tried to catch him in legal nets but their mesh was too wide. In five years he made a million pounds, tax-free; with the relaxation of exchange control he was able to squirrel his fortune abroad.<br>
<br>In 1959, when Rachman controlled about eighty houses, ten cases of intimidation were submitted to the director of public prosecutions, who judged there was insufficient evidence to prosecute. Rachman's application for British nationality was, however, rejected after a police investigation. As he desired the security of a British passport he began dealing in better-class flats, hotels, and offices in south Kensington after 1959, although in 1962 he still held the head leases of some dozen basement clubs. He became the principal shareholder in Streatham Hill Playhouse Ltd which sold the Streatham Hill Theatre for &pound;200,000 and contracted to buy the Golders Green Hippodrome for &pound;130,000.<br>
<br>After his failure to obtain British nationality Rachman, on 7 March 1960, married Audrey, daughter of Frank O'Donnell, a tailor's designer, of Lancashire; her role in his business was described under cover of parliamentary privilege in the House of Commons on 22 July 1963  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 681, 1963, 1104). Rachman's satyriasis was relieved by a daily routine of mistresses. &#145;Sex to Peter Rachman was like cleaning his teeth, and I was the toothpaste&#146;, remembered Christine Keeler, whom he came to hate  (Keeler, 58). By contrast Mandy Rice-Davies was devoted to Rachman, who kept her in 1961&#150;2; the two-way mirror installed in their bedroom was often pruriently mentioned at the much-publicized and controversial trial of his friend Stephen Ward (1963).<br>
<br>Rachman was short, chubby-faced, plump, and balding. He habitually wore dark glasses and a gold bracelet which was locked to his wrist and inscribed with serial numbers of his Swiss bank accounts and safe-combinations. The huge stakes in his inveterate gambling laundered his cash income. He used a sunlamp daily, and dressed in silk shirts, cashmere suits, and crocodile shoes. He sported big cigars, employed a bodyguard, and kept a gun in the glove compartment of his Rolls-Royce. Despite his sinister appearance, &#145;Rachman, socially, was &hellip; courteous, intelligent, witty, and almost excessively generous&#146;  (Irving, Hall, and Wallington, 35). After seeing a flamboyant American limousine while in Russian captivity Rachman had vowed to become rich enough to buy similar status symbols. In his prosperity his fleet of motor cars included a red Rolls-Royce saloon and a blue Rolls-Royce convertible; he gave a Cadillac to his favourite rent collector as a birthday present. In the 1960s he still hoarded bread-crusts under his bed as security against starvation and stockpiled his homes with food. &#145;He was freaky about cleanliness, took several baths a day using gallons of Dettol &hellip; He suffered appalling nightmares and he would wake, screaming and sweating with fear, crying for his mother&#146;  (Rice-Davies, <span class="italic">Mandy</span>, 72).<br>
<br>Rachman died after a coronary thrombosis, on 29 November 1962, at Edgware General Hospital, Edgware, Middlesex, and was buried at the Jewish cemetery in Bushey. His wife survived him. Rumours abounded in 1963 that he had assumed a new identity and was living off his Swiss fortune. Journalists had previously been deterred from publicizing his activities by fear of libel actions; his posthumous exposure was set against the resignation of John Profumo as secretary for war, and Ward's suicide. The techniques of Rachmanism were used in provincial cities like Nottingham and Newcastle, and by other London racketeers in Southwark, Lambeth, and Deptford, but in 1963 the blame was heaped &#145;on this particular, unhappy, dead, foreign Jew&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 681, 1963, 1114).<br>
