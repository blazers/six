<span class="headword">Hinkler,  Herbert John Louis <span class="st"> [Bert]</span></span>  (1892&#150;1933), <span class="occ">aviator</span>, was born on 8 December 1892 at Woodbine Cottage, Gavan Street, Bundaberg, Queensland, the eldest of the five children of John William Hinkler (<i>d</i>. 1927), a stockman originally from Germany, and his wife, Frances Atkins, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bonney. He was educated at north Bundaberg state school, 1898&#150;1906, and at the age of fourteen went to work at Bundaberg foundry. From an early age he showed a passion for aviation and design and he travelled to Brisbane in search of other aviation enthusiasts, joining there the Queensland Aero Club and the Aerial League of Australia. He later used his savings from work in a sugar mill to pay for a correspondence course in mechanics and in 1911&#150;12 built two gliders, one to his own design, which he flew on Mon Repos Beach near his home.<br>
<br>Hinkler gained valuable practical experience while working as the ground mechanic to the American airman Arthur Burr Stone, who visited Bundaberg in his Bl&eacute;riot monoplane in May 1912, and subsequently employed Hinkler during a tour of southern Australia and New Zealand. In 1913 he went to Sydney and then worked his way to England aboard ship. Upon arrival, during Easter 1914, he obtained a job with the Sopwith aviation company. After the outbreak of war he enlisted, on 7 September 1914, in the Royal Naval Air Service and underwent training at Upavon. He saw active service as an observer and air gunner with 3 wing in France and Belgium, and was awarded the DSM in November 1917. He was subsequently recommended for a commission and pilot training, which he began at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, on 30 December. In July 1918 he was posted to 28 squadron, RAF, stationed in Italy, where he flew a Sopwith Pup in operations against the Austrians.<br>
<br>After his demobilization in 1919 Hinkler hoped to enter that year's air race to Australia, but his plans foundered and he went to work instead with A. V. Roe &amp; Co. at Hamble, near Southampton, where he test-flew the 35 hp Avro Baby. He subsequently bought his own model and on 31 May 1920 he left Croydon intending to fly to Australia. Nine-and-a-half hours later he landed at Turin, having covered 650 miles non-stop. It was a remarkable achievement and although mechanical troubles forced him to end his journey at Rome, the Turin leg won him the Britannia challenge trophy. Then, as later, he shied away from the publicity that the flight generated. He returned to Hamble, where he resumed his test-flying duties. An expert aviator, he could fly an aeroplane &#145;to the very edge of disaster without crashing it&#146; and his training as a mechanic made him an especially valuable test pilot  (<span class="italic">Aeroplane</span>, 165). At 5ft 4in. he sometimes sat on cushions to gain the necessary height in the cockpit. Always known as Bert he wore &#145;crumpled, double-breasted suits and a pleasant grin&#146;, and often a bowler hat, a &#145;pardonable affectation&#146; for a civilian in a profession dominated by service pilots  (Mackenzie, viii).<br>
<br>In 1921 Hinkler shipped his Avro to Australia and on 11 April flew from Sydney to Bundaberg, covering 800 miles in nine hours. The flight enhanced Hinkler's growing reputation for long-distance solo flying. He returned to England and again to Avro, where he was chief test pilot from November 1921 until March 1927. He began his work with two remarkable first flights, in the Avro 549 Aldershot heavy bomber and Avro 555 Bison fleet spotter. Like many inter-war pilots he was an air racer and he entered competitions, usually with Avro backing. He won the Lympne light aeroplane competition in 1923 and the Grosvenor challenge cup in 1924, and in 1925 he was reserve pilot for the British Schneider trophy team in Baltimore. In 1927 he tested early autogiros for the Spanish designer Juan de la Cierva. An extraordinarily clever inventor, he contributed to the design of the new Avro Avian, and in August 1927 flew his own Avian, G-EBOV, 1200 miles non-stop from Croydon to Riga, Latvia. After a failed attempt at a record non-stop London&#150;India flight in November 1927, with Captain R. H. McIntosh, Hinkler concentrated on fund-raising for the Australia flight that remained his dream. He later recalled: &#145;My agent and I went round London, and the response was as good as if I had been trying to sell rotten fruit&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 Feb 1928, 18d).<br>
<br>Forced to rely on his own scant funds, he left Croydon at 6.50 a.m. on 7 February 1928, and the stages of his rapid progress were noted daily in the press. He arrived at Darwin, Northern Territory, at 5.55 p.m. local time on 22 February, a little over fifteen days after his departure. With a minimum of expense and organization he had become the first man to fly solo to Australia. He had also beaten the record of twenty-eight days established by the Smith brothers, Sir Ross and Sir Keith, in November&#150;December 1919. In the press and in parliament his flight was hailed as a landmark in aviation. The very ordinariness of his Avian, powered by a single Cirrus engine of modest horsepower, demonstrated the potential of air travel within the British empire. He was honoured at a series of civic receptions in Brisbane and Sydney, awarded the Air Force cross, made an honorary squadron leader in the Royal Australian Air Force, and later awarded a second Britannia challenge trophy. He declined, though, to capitalize on his fame and passed up the opportunity of a potentially lucrative lecture tour in Australia. Donations from well-wishers and a cash award from the Australian government nevertheless ensured that he left the country around &pound;10,000 richer.<br>
<br>He invested this money in the design and construction of his own aircraft, the Ibis, a high-winged light amphibian monoplane aimed at the private owner. In January 1930 he registered the Ibis Aircraft Co., with Rowland Bound, an Avro engineer, as his co-director. Construction went on at Hinkler's home, Mon Repos, at Thornhill, near Southampton, and a prototype, G-AAIS, was flown. The project however stalled for lack of funds and in September 1930 Hinkler travelled to Canada to promote the plane. Against the background of world economic depression this proved impossible and in April 1931 he bought a Canadian-assembled de Havilland Puss Moth, with a view to beginning an aerial taxi business. After this venture also failed Hinkler decided to fly the plane back to Britain. Without publicizing his intentions he left New York for Jamaica on 27 October 1931 making the first non-stop flight on that route. He then flew in stages to Brazil, and from there crossed the south Atlantic to west Africa. This flight would prove to be the most difficult of his career, and in many respects the greatest. Low cloud forced him to fly at wave height until darkness fell. He then climbed to 12,000 feet, but still found himself in cloud, and later a fierce thunderstorm. At dawn on 25 November he descended into clear weather and landed at Bathurst in British Gambia; in 22 hours and 40 minutes of blind flight he had drifted only 100 miles from his course. It was a remarkable feat of navigation and endurance which was recognized with the Segrave trophy, the Johnston memorial air navigation trophy, the gold medal of the Royal Aero Club, and a third Britannia challenge trophy.<br>
<br>The flight brought Hinkler acclaim, but not financial gain, and on his return to England in December 1931 he faced an uncertain future. He travelled to America in 1932 contemplating a global circumnavigation, but returned to London to prepare for a new attempt on the record to Australia. He left Feltham aerodrome in his Puss Moth on 7 January 1933 and after negotiating storms over the Alps headed towards Florence. Soon afterwards his plane crashed on the northern slopes of Pratomagno, in the Apennines between Florence and Arezzo, and was covered by snow. It is possible that he was attempting an emergency landing after losing a propeller in flight. His body was eventually found by a group of charcoal burners, on 27 April, a short distance from the wreckage of the plane. On Mussolini's orders he was buried with full military honours in Florence on 1 May. Hinkler was one of the outstanding pilots of his day and his death was lamented as a particular waste. Unable to find the employment that, by common consent, his talents deserved, he was driven to undertake risky solo flights on meagre resources. A forthright and honest man, he was also highly individual, and could be outspoken and difficult to use. One of the staff of <span class="italic">Flight</span> magazine recalled speaking to him in advance of the Turin flight in 1920: &#145;As usual, he insisted on no publicity before he started. His maxim always was &#147;Do the thing first and talk about it afterwards&#148;&#151;but he usually forgot to do the subsequent talking&#146;  (<span class="italic">Flight</span>, 16 Feb 1933, 151).<br>
<br>Sources disagree over Hinkler's marital status. During the 1920s he appears to have lived with an Englishwoman, Nancy (or Nance), whom he may have married some time before 1923. At the time of his arrival in Australia in 1928 <span class="italic">The Times</span> made a number of references to a &#145;Mrs Bert Hinkler&#146; who travelled to Fremantle &#145;to join her husband&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 April 1928, 13g). He is known to have married one Katherine Rome in Connecticut, on 21 May 1932; there were no children by this marriage.<br>
