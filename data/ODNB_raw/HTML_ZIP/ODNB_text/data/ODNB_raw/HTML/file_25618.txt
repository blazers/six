<span class="headword">Sinclair, Sir  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1299<span class="mult">x</span>1303), <span class="occ">baron</span>, was descended from the Anglo-Norman William de Sancto Claro, who received the barony of Roslin from David I. His father, another William, died about 1270 and either he or his son was sheriff of Haddington in 1264 and of Linlithgow and Edinburgh in 1266. In 1279 and 1281 the younger Sinclair was described as guardian of Alexander, prince of Scotland (<i>d</i>. 1284), and in 1284 he attended the meeting which accepted Margaret, the Maid of Norway, as heir presumptive should Alexander die without male heirs. Shortly afterwards he was sent to France with two other ambassadors to find a new wife for the king, choosing Yolande of Dreux. Sir William was also given custody of the royal castles of Dumfries and Edinburgh; these many positions of responsibility suggest that he was indeed &#145;closer to Alexander III than any other Scot&#146;  (Duncan, 588).<br>
<br>After King Alexander's death Sir William served the guardians as sheriff of Dumfries and justiciar of Galloway and attended the parliament at Birgham in 1290 which arranged for the marriage of the Maid of Norway with Edward I's eldest son. After Margaret's death, Sir William supported John de Balliol's claim to the throne of Scotland, acting as one of his auditors; he was present at all the main events of the Great Cause, attesting King John's fealty to Edward I on 20 November 1292. But despite receiving a grant of lands worth 100 merks per annum, Sir William took part in depriving King John of power at a parliament held at Stirling in 1295; he was probably one of the governing council of twelve then appointed.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in 1296, Sir William was captured with other members of the Scottish nobility at Dunbar, and was imprisoned in Gloucester Castle. Although his son Henry was released in a prisoner exchange in 1299, Sir William was not set free; however, he escaped some time before 1302, since Walter Beauchamp, who died in that year, was posthumously pardoned for failing to stop him. This suggests that Sinclair had refused to perform homage to Edward I, which would undoubtedly have been a condition for release. There is no mention of him thereafter and he probably died between 1300 and 1303. He is said to have married Agnes, daughter of Patrick, earl of Dunbar, but this is unlikely. One Amicia was described as his widow as early as 1299; the couple had three sons: Henry, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25634/', "William Sinclair (d. 1337)")</script>, bishop of Dunkeld, and Gregory; and a daughter, Annabel.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_25618"></a><span class="headword">Sir Henry Sinclair</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1330)<span class="occ"></span> swore fealty to Edward I in 1292, but, like his father, joined the patriotic side in 1296 and was duly captured at Dunbar. In 1299 he was released from St Briavels Castle, as part of a prisoner exchange, in return for Sir William Fitzwarin. In September 1305 he was appointed sheriff of Lanark, an office which had until then been held by the earl of Carrick. On 22 June 1306, together with Sir Robert Keith and Sir Adam Gordon, both prominent members of the patriotic government before 1304, he acted as surety for the good behaviour of William Lamberton, bishop of St Andrews. Between 1308 and 1309 Sinclair was paid by the English government for keeping the truce with the king of Scots and &#145;for going to Robert Bruce on behalf of the King's council in those parts&#146;  (TNA: PRO, E101/373/24, f. 41). But he had joined Bruce's side by October 1313 and perhaps fought at Bannockburn in 1314. He sealed the declaration of Arbroath in 1320 with the designation of &#145;panetarius&#146;. In 1328 he was granted a pension of 40 merks to himself and his heirs, until lands of that value could be granted; this was perhaps the repayment of a loan made to the king. He died about 1330. Sir Henry married Alicia Fenton and they had a son, another <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25633/', "Sir William Sinclair")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54321/', "Sinclair family")</script>], who was killed in 1330 in Spain with Sir James Douglas who carried King Robert's heart.<br>
