<span class="headword">Maynard,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1577, <em>d.</em> in or before 1633), <span class="occ">lutenist and composer</span>, was baptized on 5 January 1577 at St Albans Abbey, Hertfordshire, the third son of Ralph Maynard (<i>d</i>. 1614) of St Julian's, a former leper hospital in St Michael's parish, St Albans, and his wife, Margery, daughter of Robert Seale. In March 1600 he was one of two commissaries appointed by his uncle Henry (later Sir Henry) Maynard, surveyor of musters in Ireland. Perhaps the Irish position was a sinecure; a bass singer, Johan Meinert, and a bass violist, Daniel Norcum, possibly Dowland recruits, were at the Danish court in 1599, but absconded without leave in 1601. Unsuccessfully pursued, they were spotted in Venice a year later; an extradition request was refused and they were never caught. A bass singer, John Miners (Mynars), was active in England between 1607 and his death in 1615. However, Meinert is a common surname in north Germany and the confusion of dates and names makes certain identification of these two men with John Maynard impossible. None the less, although he was in Ireland at the time his father drew up his will (proved in 1614), the will hints at his having lived or having intended to live elsewhere abroad.<br>
<br>Maynard's only known publication, <span class="italic">The XII Wonders of the World</span> (1611), describes him as &#145;Lutenist at the most famous Schoole of St Julians in Hertfordshire&#146;. His dedication to Joan, Lady Thynne, of Caus Castle in Shropshire, states: &#145;This poore play-woorke of mine, had its prime originall and birth-wrights in your own house, when by nearer service I was obliged yours&#146;, and mentions her daughter Dorothy, &#145;who once laboured me to that effect&#146;, implying that he once taught music in the household. The words of <span class="italic">The XII Wonders</span> were written about 1600 by Sir John Davies, then solicitor-general for Ireland. Published in the 1608 edition of Davison's <span class="italic">Poetical Rhapsody</span>, the poems poked fun at stock figures of the time. Maynard's music is for voice, lute, and bass viol, &#145;all three ioyntly, and none seuerall&#146;, and treats the two instruments more independently than was usual at the time. Six duets for lute and bass viol follow, the first three forming a thematically related suite: pavan, galliard, and &#145;An almond to both&#146;. The following pavan and galliard require special tunings for both instruments, but the final &#145;Adew&#146; returns to normal. The book concludes with seven pavans in tablature for the lyra viol with optional bass viol &#145;to fill up the parts&#146;.<br>
<br>Maynard may have had a London house: &#145;Joane, wife of John Maynard&#146;, was buried on 6 June 1619 at St Dunstan-in-the-West, a parish where many musicians lived at that time. However, for some periods at least he lived at St Julian's, apparently inherited from his elder brother Robert: in 1611 he paid tithes there, and in 1633 the property was described as &#145;late&#146; in his occupation. Maynard died before November 1633.<br>
