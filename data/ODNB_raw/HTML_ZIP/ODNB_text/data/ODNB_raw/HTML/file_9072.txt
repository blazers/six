</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fairclough,  Samuel</span>  (1594&#150;1677), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born on 29 April 1594 at Haverhill, Suffolk, the youngest of four sons of Laurence Fairclough (<i>d</i>. 1603), vicar of Haverhill, and his wife, Mary, daughter of John Cole, the &#145;chief lord&#146; of that town  (Clark, 153). He was educated by Edmund Robotham, &#145;the most famous schoolmaster of that age&#146;  (ibid., 154), who pronounced him the best scholar he had taught in thirty years. After an episode of pear-stealing with a fellow student, a sermon by Samuel Ward awakened Fairclough to &#145;the terrours of the Law &hellip; sincere repentance &hellip; and an effectual faith&#146;, and &#145;he became a true and sincere <i>Convert</i>&#146;  (ibid., 154&#150;5).<br>
<br>Sent to Queens' College, Cambridge, before his fourteenth birthday, Fairclough lived strictly, refusing on principle to take a woman's part in the comedy <span class="italic">Ignoramus</span>, presented before James I. About 1610, while still an undergraduate, he was appointed sub-tutor to Spencer, Lord Compton, eldest son of the earl of Northampton, taking responsibility for his &#145;civil&#146; and &#145;moral&#146; education even before Compton was admitted to the college in 1614. The appointment brought Fairclough &pound;30 a year and potentially valuable connections. Other connections made at Cambridge were less orthodox: he was taken up by leading puritan divines such as John Preston and John Davenant and began to question the value of church ceremonies. Having delayed graduation in order to read more widely, he took his BA in 1615.<br>
<br>Shortly afterwards Fairclough refused with regret Northampton's invitation to travel to France and Italy with Lord Compton, deferring to his mother's fear that, like his brothers who had served as soldiers in the Low Countries, he would die there. He was also offered a living in Suffolk, and although under age to receive priest's orders, occupied it as a curate to the nominal rector with great success. After two years he declined the rectory, choosing instead, after consultation with &#145;his spiritual <i>Father</i>, Mr Ward&#146;  (Clark, 159), to pursue his studies with Richard Blackerby of Ashen, Essex, who was famous for his holiness and learning. While there Fairclough concluded that, although naturally inclined to learning, he was called to &#145;publick <i>use</i> and <i>service</i>&#146;  (ibid., 159).<br>
<br>In 1619 Fairclough accepted, after some hesitation, an offer on good terms of a lectureship at King's Lynn, Norfolk. &#145;His popularity&#146;, relates Edmund Calamy, &#145;stirred up the envy of the other ministers, and he was openly opposed by the keepers of public houses, &amp;c. whose business declined from the decrease of drunkenness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>, 3.275). He aroused the ire of Bishop Samuel Harsnett of Norwich, who cited him to his court, declaring that Fairclough had &#145;grown to be a <i>popular</i> man, and therefore he must be <i>nipt in the bud</i>&#146;  (Clark, 160).<br>
<br>Fairclough retired and accepted a similar but less conspicuous position at Clare, Suffolk, where he had often preached while at Ashen. At this time he married Richard Blackerby's eldest daughter Susan (<i>d</i>. 1638); they were to be &#145;a most <i>happy</i> couple &hellip; <i>rejoicing</i> in each others love&#146;  (Clark, 161). On 20 June 1623 Sir Nathaniel Barnardiston presented him to the rectory of Barnardiston, which was close enough to his seat at Kedington, Suffolk, for both Barnardiston and his wife to be Fairclough's constant auditors. Although the living was a poor one it came with the promise of better and was the beginning of a partnership, ended only by Barnardiston's death, which wrought a moral and religious transformation in their south-west corner of Suffolk. None the less Fairclough soon met with further opposition. One Sunday he preached in place of a sick minister at Sudbury and repeated his sermon in the house where he lodged. An envious colleague exhibited articles against him in Star Chamber as a factious and seditious man. He was convened before the court of high commission and spent two years in intermittent attendance at the court, so that journeys and fees swallowed up all his income, leaving him in debt. Finally his counsel, Sir Nathaniel Brent, secured the transfer of the case to Norwich, where &#145;a certain lady&#146; obtained a discharge from Bishop Harsnett  (ibid., 162).<br>
<br>Barnardiston afterwards presented Fairclough to the rectory of Kedington, near Haverhill, and obtained his institution on 26 January 1630 &#145;without his personal attendance [upon the bishop], taking the oath of canonical obedience, or subscribing the three exceptionable articles&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>, 3.276). Here &#145;Sholes and Multitudes of People&#146; came as much as 20 miles to hear Fairclough, arriving hours early to secure a place inside the church, while the churchyard was &#145;barricadoed with [their] horses&#146;  (Clark, 187). Fairclough preached four times a week and gave Thursday lectures, &#145;Conciones ad clerum&#146;, similarly well attended by local ministers and Cambridge scholars. He had two levels of preaching, for the learned and for the people (with whom he avoided speculation and controversy), but both, though delivered without notes, were marked by clarity, learning, scriptural knowledge, and plainly delivered &#145;gospel truths&#146;; unlike those of some of his famous contemporaries, his sermons were not histrionic. As a pastor he catechized, examined before monthly communion, visited and counselled his parishioners, acted as peacemaker, and engaged in practical charity, from regular almsgiving to distribution of large-print bibles to the aged. He was often cited to appear before the archdeacon at Bury for failure to read the <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span> or accept innovations in the church, but he managed to evade attendance on the grounds of inability to ride owing to a providential accident.<br>
<br>Fairclough's first wife died in childbirth in 1638, leaving him with seven young children. She was a &#145;<i>non-such</i>&#146; for beauty and character, and his &#145;<i>over-sorrow</i>&#146; provided fuel for hostile criticism  (Clark, 171). Three years later he married the widow of a fellow clergyman named Folke or Folkes, the mother of a young daughter who later married one of his sons. This marriage too was happy, although relatively short. On 4 April 1641, on Barnardiston's initiative and at a key point in the proceedings against the earl of Strafford, Fairclough delivered a fast sermon to MPs calling for &#145;the execution of penall Justice upon publicke offenders&#146; and in particular upon &#145;this execrable person that fights against our peace, and welfare&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Troublers Troubled</span>, 1641, 2, 8&#150;9). During the civil war, however, he chose to be passive rather than active, deploring warfare between protestants and attributing much to the divisive designs of the Jesuits, and showed little sympathy with the presbyterians or any other doctrinaire reformers. He was nominated to the Westminster assembly but, dismayed by its divisions, excused himself from attending.<br>
<br>In 1645 Fairclough was a member of the commission appointed to try the Suffolk witches. Although in his sermons he accepted the reality of witchcraft, he insisted that the strict letter of the law be followed, thus making conviction more difficult, and condemned those who would convict &#145;without <i>plain convincing</i> evidence&#146;  (Clark, 172). He signed the petition of Suffolk ministers in 1646, but refused to take the engagement, &#145;which his Soul abhorred&#146;  (Clark, 173), and also declined the mastership of Trinity College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>On 28 September 1648 Fairclough preached a public thanksgiving sermon at Romford, Essex, celebrating the surrender of Colchester to Fairfax's army and the release of members of the Essex parliamentary committee, who had been prisoners in the town, later published as <span class="italic">The Prisoners' Praises</span> (1650). This rare intrusion into national affairs was probably the consequence of Barnardiston's active part in the siege and Arthur Barnardiston's presence among the prisoners. Fairclough thoroughly rejected the regicide, and on its first anniversary preached on <span class="roman">Hosea</span> 1:4, &#145;I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel&#146;. It is clear from his last venture into print, his funeral sermon for Barnardiston, <span class="italic"><i>Hagioi axioi</i>, or, The Saints Worthinesse and the Worlds Worthlesnesse</span> (1653), that both Barnardiston and Fairclough were deeply disillusioned with the religious, political, and moral state of the kingdom. The latter was resolute in his preference for a private life and although he was appointed a trier to examine ministers' qualifications in 1654 he seldom attended the committee's meetings in London. When he did so he was honoured for his political and religious impartiality.<br>
<br>Although he was overjoyed at the return of Charles II, in 1662 Fairclough refused to conform and was ejected from his Kedington living, while remaining constant to his principle of passive obedience, and refusing to condemn those who had conformed. Although he and his sons lost collectively more than &pound;1000 a year for their nonconformity, his greatest sorrow was that he was forced to leave his spiritual children. He lived for four or five years in Sculpins, the house of a married daughter in Finchingfield, Essex, with his third wife, Mary Brooke, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sorell (<i>d</i>. 1669/70), widow of another minister, two of his sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9071/', "Richard Fairclough (1621?&#150;1682)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9073/', "Samuel Fairclough (1625&#150;1691)")</script>, and his two sons-in-law, George Jones and Richard Shute. They formed &#145;a little Colledge of Divines&#146; and &#145;a most happy Family&#146;  (Clark, 175&#150;6); as the Fairclough and Barnardiston households had apparently always done, in their practices and relationships they represented something close to the puritan domestic ideal. Father and sons preached by turns &#145;and the neighbours came in&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>, 3.278).<br>
<br>Sculpins proved unhealthy, however, and the family dispersed. Fairclough went to live with his youngest son, a conforming minister at Kennett, Cambridgeshire, and then with his daughters, first at Heveningham, Suffolk, and finally, about 1673, at Stowmarket. He kept his full powers, and preached, until he was over eighty, but then began to fail. He died at Stowmarket on 14 December 1677 after a remarkably healthy and happy life and was buried in Stowmarket church. The conforming minister who contributed a eulogy to Samuel Clark's biography of Fairclough regretted that no formula had been sought by which such &#145;useful and sober-spirited&#146; men could be retained in the Church of England.<br>
