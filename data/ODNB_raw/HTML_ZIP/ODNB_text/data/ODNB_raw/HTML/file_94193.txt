<span class="headword">Drew <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Baker]</span>,  Kathleen Mary</span>  (1901&#150;1957), <span class="occ">phycologist</span>, was born at Cleeve House, Windermere Road, Leigh, Lancashire, on 6 November 1901, eldest daughter of Walter Drew (1873&#150;1949), who was then a commercial traveller for an agricultural implement manufacturer (he later became chairman of a farm machinery company), and his wife, Augusta Caroline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Millier (<i>b</i>. 1868), who had been a schoolmistress before her marriage. She had two sisters and a brother but only she followed a scientific career. Shortly after her birth her father was moved to Salisbury, where she attended Bishop Wordsworth's School, which was at that time co-educational. Botany was valued and well taught at the school and may have influenced her choice of career. She was an outstanding pupil, winning several prizes, was typically top of the class, and left school in 1918 with a county major scholarship. This gave her free university study and in 1919 she took up a place at Manchester University, where she also excelled; after two years she was excused the intermediate science examination on account of her outstanding work. At this time she started her study of algae, working first on the green alga <i>Chara</i>. She graduated in 1922 with a first-class honours degree in botany, was awarded an Ashburne Hall research scholarship, in connection with Ashburne Hall, the hall of residence for women students at Manchester, and undertook study for the degree of MSc in the university department of cryptogamic botany. Her observations of red snow and red lakes during a summer school in Geneva may have inspired her to study red algae, which eventually led to the scientific discovery that made her famous and for which she is primarily remembered. On graduating MSc she became assistant lecturer on the staff, a position she held for two years.<br>
<br>In 1925 Drew was one of the first women to be awarded a Commonwealth scholarship. This took her to the University of California at Berkeley, where two prominent American phycologists, William Setchell and Nathaniel Gardner, were based. She worked for two years on revising the taxonomy of a group of filamentous red algae from the Pacific coast of North America. In the USA she began collecting algae and this was the start of her herbarium of 2949 specimens now housed in the Natural History Museum, London. She collected algae every year throughout her career with the exception of the first three years of the Second World War. Before going to California she had met Henry Wright Baker (1893&#150;1969), a lecturer in mechanical engineering at Manchester University, son of Harry Baker, analyst and works chemist. They had wanted to become engaged but her family did not approve, apparently on religious grounds, as they were high Anglicans and Wright Baker a Quaker. They made her wait to see if she still wanted to marry on her return to England. She did, and they married in a Quaker ceremony at Manchester, on 22 June 1928.<br>
<br>Drew had returned to the University of Manchester after her time in California, but had been required to relinquish her university lectureship after her marriage, as a result of the university's policy against employing spouses. She continued her studies, working both at home and in time in the university, albeit with no salary. Both she and her husband were awarded the degree of DSc by Manchester University in 1939. In June 1939 Henry Wright Baker was appointed professor of mechanical engineering at Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. Their two children, John Rendle and K. Frances Biggs, were born in 1939 and 1940.<br>
<br>During the war years Drew worked mainly on the life histories of red algae, her husband building her aquaria in both the cellar and garden. Her main work was an attempt to establish the life history of the red alga <i>Porphyra</i>, which had eluded many previous workers. Her scientific breakthrough came when she added shell to her algal cultures. Spores from the blade phase of the alga grew into minute threads that invaded the shell before coming to the surface to release spores. Previously such filaments in nature had been described as a separate species, <i>Conchocelis rosea</i>. Her subsequent publication (&#145;<i>Conchocelis</i>-phase in the life history of <i>Porphyra umbilicalis</i> (L.) K&uuml;tz&#146;, <span class="italic">Nature</span>, 164, 1949, 748&#150;9) has been described as &#145;100 lines that should change the world&#146;  (Michanek) and indeed they did. In Japan <i>Porphyra</i> had been a food source for over 2000 years and probably the first seaweed in cultivation. Before her work nori cultivation depended on poles on which the seaweed was grown being naturally seeded. Poor harvests in the late 1940s and a massive typhoon in 1951 led to the collapse of the nori industry. However, Japanese scientists recognized the significance of her findings, and succeeded in cultivating nori artificially. Once the life cycle of <i>Porphyra</i> was understood, large-scale cultivation and harvesting became possible, and the modern nori industry was effectively born. In gratitude the Japanese set up a memorial to the &#145;Mother of the Sea&#146; near Uto City and every year there is a ceremony in honour of her.<br>
<br>Drew's other major contribution was to the professional development of phycology. With the support of her friend and fellow phycologist Margaret T. Martin she founded the British Phycological Society in Edinburgh in January 1952. The first council was elected in January 1953 and, although she had to be persuaded, she was its first president.<br>
<br>Kathleen Drew died in Manchester, from cancer, on 14 September 1957, having worked to the end. Before she died she burnt all her letters and documents, leaving little trace of her character. But an insight can be gained from a tribute from phycologists and friends in the <span class="italic">British Phycological Bulletin</span> of June 1958. She was one of the most meticulous investigators of the morphology, cytology, and life history of the red algae, but also much more than that. She had a clear and acute mind, and was forthright, generous, sincere, and devoted to her friends. A colleague of integrity, she had high standards in everything she did. Harry Powell, the first secretary of the British Phycological Society, described her as &#145;dignified, very formal, as good as could be&#146;  (private information). Over her lifetime she published about fifty papers under her maiden surname; after her death she was generally known as Drew Baker. She remained a friend to Ashburne Hall throughout her life.<br>
