<span class="headword">Walker,  (William) Sidney</span>  (1795&#150;1846), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, was born at Pembroke on 4 December 1795, the eldest of the six children of John Walker, a naval officer who died at Twickenham in 1811 from the effects of war wounds, and his wife, Harriet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Falconar (<i>b</i>. 1773/4). Harriet and her sister Maria had published <span class="italic">Poems on Slavery</span> in 1788. Sidney Walker was named after his godfather, Admiral Sir Sidney Smith, under whom his father had served. Sidney Walker, who was always called by his second forename, was a precocious child of weak physique. After spending some years first at a school at Doncaster, run by his mother's brother, and then with a private tutor at Forest Hill in Kent, he entered Eton College in 1811. He had already shown a remarkable literary ability which, however, was never fully realized. At ten he translated many of Anacreon's odes. At eleven he planned an epic in heroic verse on the career of Gustavus Vasa, and in 1813 he published by subscription the first four books of this epic in a volume entitled <span class="italic">Gustavus Vasa, and other Poems</span>, an immature work, showing little promise of &#145;any high and distinctive poetic power&#146;  (Moultrie, xv). At Eton he learned the whole of Homer's <span class="italic">Iliad</span> and <span class="italic">Odyssey</span> by heart, and wrote Greek verse with unusual correctness and ease. There, too, he began lifelong friendships with Winthrop Mackworth Praed and John Moultrie. Walker was of diminutive stature and uncouth appearance and manner, and abnormally absent-minded, and suffered much bullying at school, although he retaliated with &#145;relentless sarcasm&#146;  (Moultrie, xi). After winning many distinctions at Eton, he was entered as a sizar at Trinity College, Cambridge, on 16 February 1814, and began his university career in October 1814. There he maintained the promise of his schooldays. In the next few years he published verse and translations, which included <span class="italic">The Heroes of Waterloo: an Ode</span> and a translation, <span class="italic">Poems from the Danish, Selected by Andreas Andersen Feldborg</span>, both in 1815. Walker won the Craven scholarship in 1817 and the Porson prize for Greek verse in 1818, and was admitted scholar of Trinity on 3 April of that year. Although his ignorance of mathematics made it extremely difficult for him to pass the examination for his BA in 1819, he was elected on the strength of his classical attainments to a fellowship at his college in 1820. His awkward manners and slovenly bearing did not improve, but he retained his close friendship with Praed and Moultrie, and formed a new and lasting friendship with Derwent Coleridge, who later attended him in the last days of his life. In 1824 Walker applied unsuccessfully for the Greek professorship at the university and thereafter made no further effort to obtain any similar work. While a fellow of Trinity he lived in seclusion, although his wish &#145;for the married life &hellip; was intense and soul-consuming&#146;  (Moultrie, lxxiv). He contributed philological essays to the <span class="italic">Classical Journal</span>, and both verse and prose to Charles Knight's <span class="italic">Quarterly Magazine</span>. In 1824 he prepared for publication a two-volume edition of Milton's newly discovered treatise <span class="italic">De doctrina Christiana</span>. Charles Richard Sumner, then librarian at Windsor, was ostensibly the editor and translator, but Walker took it on himself to revise &#145;not only the printer's, but the translator's labour&#146;  (Moultrie, lxxviii). In 1828 he edited for Knight a useful <span class="italic">Corpus poetarum Latinorum</span>, which was reprinted in 1848 and 1854.<br>
<br>As an undergraduate Walker had been troubled by religious doubts, and had asked William Wilberforce for guidance. During 1817&#150;18 Wilberforce wrote him letters attempting to strengthen his beliefs. Charles Simeon, an important influence at Cambridge during these years, allayed his concerns for a time, but Walker felt that his sceptical views regarding eternal punishment disqualified him from taking holy orders. Therefore, because of the university regulations of the time, he was forced to resign his fellowship in 1829. The loss of his fellowship meant the loss of his income and, owing to his unbusinesslike habits and trusting nature, he found himself with debts totalling &pound;300. In 1830 his old friend Praed paid his debts and settled on him an income of &pound;52 a year for life, to which Trinity College added &pound;20 p.a., and on this income Walker supported himself for the rest of his life. In 1831 he moved to London and was lodging at 26 Melton Crescent, Euston Square, in 1836, and in the neighbourhood of St James's Street from 1838 until his death. His reason became disturbed, so that he thought himself possessed by a demon, and social intercourse with him became impossible. However, he remained capable of occasional literary work, which bore few signs of his mental state, and at times he was able to describe the symptoms of his illness calmly and rationally. After a life which was &#145;almost as uneventful as it was unhappy&#146;  (Moultrie, i), Walker died of &#145;the stone&#146;  (Moultrie, cxxxiv), probably kidney failure, at his lodgings, a single room on the top floor of 41 St James's Place, on 15 October 1846. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. On the tomb were engraved some lines from Moultrie's poem called &#145;The Dream of Life&#146;, in which the writer mourned the &#145;shapeless wreck&#146; to which Walker's fine mind had been reduced. Moultrie published in 1852 a collection of Walker's letters and poems, the former being entertaining to read, under the title, <span class="italic">The poetical remains of William Sidney Walker, formerly fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, with a memoir of the author</span>.<br>
<br>Walker left a voluminous collection of manuscripts, including critical essays and numerous notes on the text and versification of Shakespeare. William Nanson Lettsom, one of Walker's school and college friends, tried without much success to bring some order into Walker's Shakespearian papers, and in 1854 published <span class="italic">Shakespeare's versification, and its apparent irregularities explained by examples from early and late English writers</span>. Lettsom also edited <span class="italic">A critical examination of the text of Shakespeare, with remarks on his language and that of his contemporaries, together with notes on his plays and poems</span>, which appeared in three volumes in 1860. The cost of printing both works was borne by George Crawshay, a wealthy Cambridge undergraduate. These two works, which mainly deal with minute points of Shakespearian prosody and syntax, embody the results of Walker's vast and close reading and have proved of some value to succeeding students of Elizabethan and Shakespearian literature. Their defects are the want of logical arrangement of the material and the lack of an index, although the British Library copy of the <span class="italic">Critical examination</span> has a partial handwritten index (1869), bound in at the end of volume 2.<br>
