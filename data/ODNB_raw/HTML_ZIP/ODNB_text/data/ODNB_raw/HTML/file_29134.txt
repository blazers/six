<span class="headword">Weston,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1644<span class="mult">x</span>7), <span class="occ">merchant and colonial adventurer</span>, played a leading role in supporting and setting out the pilgrims who settled Plymouth plantation in New England during 1620. His earlier trading activities in the Netherlands were halted by the privy council, following complaints from the Merchant Adventurers that he was trading without licence. On 20 February 1620, through the influence of a business associate, John Peirce, he acquired a patent from the Virginia Company enabling him to establish a plantation in the colony. Later in the year he went to Leiden offering to support the leaders of the English congregation, with whom he was previously acquainted, who were then considering emigrating to America with Dutch support. With a group of associates, Weston was prepared to set out the pilgrims, promising that &#145;they should &hellip; neither fear want of shipping nor money&#146;  (Bradford, 37). Following the pilgrims' acceptance of Weston's proposals, he returned to London to organize their voyage to America. He hired the <i>Mayflower</i> and acquired a group of additional settlers to accompany the original party of thirty-five from Leiden.<br>
<br>Weston has been criticized for the rigorous conditions he imposed on the pilgrims, but his support for them was primarily commercial. He also had to take account of the interests of his partners: according to John Smith they numbered about seventy merchants, gentlemen, and artisans  (Bradford, 37). When the pilgrims' leaders refused to accept a revised set of conditions presented to them in England, Weston was &#145;much offended and told them they must then look to stand on their own legs&#146;  (ibid., 49). After their safe arrival in New England, where they decided to stay instead of sailing on to Virginia, he set out the <i>Fortune</i> with thirty-five new settlers, which arrived at Plymouth in November 1621 with a patent from the recently established Council for New England for the pilgrims' settlement. The ship was laden with a return cargo of clapboards and beaver skins valued at &pound;500. By 1622, however, the London partnership had started to disintegrate. Weston sold his adventure and debts in the venture and advised William Bradford, now governor of Plymouth, to break away from the joint stock.<br>
<br>Later in 1622 Weston set out a small colonizing expedition to establish a plantation near Plymouth, under the leadership of his brother Andrew and his brother-in-law Richard Greene. His aim seems to have been to combine fishing and trade along the coast of New England. Although the pilgrims assisted the fifty or sixty men who arrived at Plymouth in June 1622, they were an unwelcome, if not undesirable, presence in the colony. They went on to establish a small plantation at Wessagusset, but their disorderly behaviour, fed by rumours that one of the chief leaders in the settlement kept Native American women, alarmed Bradford, who later dismissed them as &#145;heathenish Christians&#146;  (Bradford, 375). Wessagusset, however, was also a potential rival for trade with the indigenous people, which the pilgrims were then developing. After a difficult winter, Weston's men apparently quarrelled with the Native Americans, and had to be rescued by an expedition from Plymouth. Most of the survivors subsequently returned to England.<br>
<br>Shortly after the collapse of Wessagusset, Weston arrived at Plymouth, alone and without supplies, having sailed from England with some fishermen &#145;under another name&#146;, disguised as a blacksmith  (Bradford, 119). With Bradford's assistance he began to trade along the coast. When Robert Gorges arrived in Plymouth in September 1623, with a commission from the Council for New England to act as governor of the entire region, Weston was summoned to answer charges concerning the illegal export of ordnance from England and the behaviour of his men at Wessagusset. The charges were not pursued, partly through Bradford's mediation, and Weston was allowed to resume his trading activities. Bradford later complained that Weston repaid his help with nothing more than &#145;reproaches and evil words&#146;  (ibid., 120).<br>
<br>In 1624 Weston moved to Virginia where he acquired a plantation and sat in the house of burgesses in 1628. His career in the colony remains shadowy, though he was apparently in trouble with the colonial authorities on several occasions. In 1642 he moved on to neighbouring Maryland where he acquired a grant of 1200 acres for Westbury Manor, and became a freeman and member of the assembly. Thereafter he returned to England and died at Bristol some time between 1644 and 1647. He was survived by one daughter, Elizabeth, who married Roger Conant of Marblehead.<br>
<br>Weston emerges from Bradford's <span class="italic">History of Plymouth Plantation</span> as an enterprising, if unscrupulous, adventurer, whose religious sympathy for the pilgrims was tempered by commercial considerations. Modern authorities have treated him more leniently; at least one has argued that the history of the pilgrims might have taken a very different course but for his support in 1620  (Andrews, 1.331).<br>
