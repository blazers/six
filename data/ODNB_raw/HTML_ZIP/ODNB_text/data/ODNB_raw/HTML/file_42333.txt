<span class="headword">Johnstone,  Henry Alexander  Butler-</span>  (1837&#150;1902), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 7 December 1837, the only son of the Hon. Henry Butler-Johnstone (1809&#150;1879) and his wife, Isabella, only daughter of Sir Alexander Munro. She was the niece and heir of General Johnstone of Auchen Castle in Dumfriesshire, which Butler-Johnstone inherited. In 1874, following the death of his mother the previous year, Butler-Johnstone adopted the surname Butler-Munro-Johnstone. He was educated at Eton College and matriculated in 1856 at Christ Church, Oxford, where he gained a first in classics in 1861. In May 1862 he was elected as Conservative MP for Canterbury, the constituency that his father had represented between 1857 and 1859. He spoke against the extension of the franchise during the parliamentary debates of 1866&#150;7. Otherwise he often supported liberal causes, such as the disestablishment of the Irish church. In his pamphlet <span class="italic">Ireland</span> (1868) he rejected demands for the creation of an Irish republic but allowed the possibility that a Dublin parliament might be created with powers to legislate on specifically domestic issues, as long as Westminster retained control of financial and foreign policy matters. After 1868 he declared himself independent of any party identification.<br>
<br>Butler-Johnstone's main interest as an MP was foreign affairs. He urged a maritime alliance with France and was on the council of the Maritime League for the Resumption of Naval Rights, a pressure group demanding Britain's withdrawal from the declaration of Paris (1856) with its abolition of privateering. He was an ardent imperialist and advocated the maintenance of a strong army and navy. During the Eastern crisis of 1875&#150;8 he became a leading Russophobe and philo-Turk, influenced by David Urquhart. He warned against Russia obtaining access to the Dardanelles and supported the work of Turkish constitutional reformers. In 1876 he answered Gladstone's pamphlet on the Bulgarian atrocities by denying the responsibility of the Turkish government and by claiming that Gladstone's portrait of the Turks was a travesty. In <span class="italic">The Turks</span> (1876) he countered the popular view of the Turks as barbarians and went on to defend such institutions as the harem (which he pointed out was only the name for a Turkish home). During the Russo-Turkish War, he actually lent money to the Turkish government for attacks on the Russian army and sent over military advisers (who were not employed). He resigned his parliamentary seat in 1878 in order to visit Turkey but later came to despair of the nation.<br>
<br>In the early 1880s Butler-Johnstone became an acquaintance of Karl Marx. He gave his friend Henry Hyndman a copy of <span class="italic">Das Kapital</span>, which led to Hyndman's conversion to Marxism. Butler-Johnstone was present in 1881 at the early meetings of the Democratic Federation, which was to become the Social Democratic Federation in 1884, the first major organization in the revival of British socialism. However, it seems unlikely that Butler-Johnstone was ever a socialist.<br>
<br>On 17 November 1877 Butler-Johnstone married Maria Irma Gabrielle, countess of Soyres, who died in 1880. In 1896 he married a widow, Mrs Skipp Lloyd. He was a JP for Dumfriesshire, where he owned nearly 3000 acres, though he spent the last twenty years of his life on the continent, writing for British and European newspapers on the need for a British imperial federation. Butler-Johnstone died at a hotel in Paris on 17 October 1902; his body was returned to England. Butler-Johnstone was a maverick figure on the right who ironically played a brief role in the origins of British socialism. At one time, he was &#145;the hope of the Conservative party&#146; according to Henry Hyndman, who believed that he misused his talents and &#145;made a sad end of his promising life&#146;  (Hyndman, 207, 209).<br>
