<span class="headword">Nunn,  Joshua Arthur</span>  (1853&#150;1908), <span class="occ">army veterinary surgeon</span>, born on 10 May 1853 at Hill Castle, co. Wexford, Ireland, was the son of Edward W. Nunn JP DL. Nunn was educated at Wimbledon School, and he served in the Royal Monmouthshire engineer militia from 1871 to 1877. In 1874 he entered the Royal Veterinary College at Camden Town, London, and was admitted MRCVS on 4 January 1877. In the same year he obtained a certificate in cattle pathology from the Royal Agricultural Society. He was also gazetted veterinary surgeon on probation in the army veterinary service on 21 April 1877 and veterinary surgeon to the Royal Artillery on 24 April 1877, being the last officer to obtain a commission under the old regimental system.<br>
<br>Nunn proceeded to India in December 1877, and from September 1879 to August 1880 he took part in the Anglo-Afghan War as the veterinary officer in charge of transport on the Khyber line of communication. Later, accompanying the expeditionary column in the Laghman valley, he was in charge of the transport base hospital at Gandamak. For these services he was awarded the Afghan medal.<br>
<br>Nunn was employed on special duty from 1880 to 1885 as a civil servant under the Punjab government, first in the suppression of glanders under the <span class="roman">Glanders and Farcy Act</span> and, afterwards, in connection with the agricultural department of Punjab, as the veterinary inspector. In this capacity he travelled widely to collect all manner of information and statistics about cattle, including folklore and disease. This he embodied in a series of valuable reports: <span class="italic">Animal Diseases in Rohtak</span> (1882); <span class="italic">Diseases in Sialkote and Hazara</span> (1883); and <span class="italic">Diseases in the Montgomery and Shapur Districts</span> (1884&#150;5). He also lectured to students at the Lahore Veterinary College. Before he left India in 1886, the government of the Punjab recognized his valuable services in a special minute.<br>
<br>After taking short courses in bacteriology at Cambridge and Paris, Nunn was ordered to South Africa in January 1887 to investigate &#145;horse sickness&#146;, thought to be due to anthrax; he proved that the disease was malarial in type. Engaging meanwhile in the campaign against the Zulu in 1888, he was at the surrender of the chief Somkali at St Lucia Lagoon.<br>
<br>Nunn returned to India on 11 December 1888, and was appointed inspecting veterinary officer of the Chittagong column during the Chin Lushai expedition of 1889. Nunn was mentioned in dispatches and was decorated with the Distinguished Service Order on 12 December 1890, being the first member of the army veterinary service to receive this distinction. In 1890 he was appointed principal of the Punjab Veterinary College, where he worked for six years and laid the foundations of the local veterinary service. He was rewarded by becoming CIE in 1895. Nunn did much to advance the cause of veterinary science in India. Of untiring energy, he was personally popular with his associates.<br>
<br>Nunn was joint editor of the <span class="italic">Veterinary Journal</span> from 1893 to 1906, and also published <span class="italic">Report on South African Horse Sickness</span> (1888); <span class="italic">Notes on Stable Management in India</span> (1896); <span class="italic">Lectures on Saddlery and Harness</span> (1902); <span class="italic">Veterinary First Aid in Cases of Accident or Sudden Illness</span> (1903); <span class="italic">The Use of Molasses as a Feeding Material</span> (1903), which was translated from the French of Edouard Curot; <span class="italic">Diseases of the Mammary Gland of the Domestic Animals</span> (1904), also translated from the French of P. Leblanc; and <span class="italic">Veterinary Toxicology</span> (1907).<br>
<br>From December 1896 to August 1905 Nunn was in England, spending part of his time studying law, though in 1901 he also passed his examinations as a meat inspector. He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in November 1899, and was later admitted as advocate of the bar of the supreme court of the Transvaal. Again in England, he was from 1901 to 1904 deputy director-general of the army veterinary department, and then was principal veterinary officer in South Africa, in 1904&#150;5. He was transferred to India in June 1906 and there he filled a similar position. He was made a CB on 26 June 1906. In Bombay on 12 January 1907 he married Gertrude Ann, widow of W. Chamberlain and daughter of E. Kellner CIE. He remained in India, despite illness, until 23 January 1908, when he returned to England. He died by his own hand in the Warneford Hospital, Oxford, on 23 February 1908. He was survived by his wife.<br>
