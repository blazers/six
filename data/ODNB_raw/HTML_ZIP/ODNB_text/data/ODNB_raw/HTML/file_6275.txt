<span class="headword">Coppe,  Abiezer</span>  (1619&#150;1672?), <span class="occ">Baptist preacher and Ranter</span>, was born on Sunday 30 May 1619, and baptized on 1 June at St Mary's, Warwick, the eldest known child of Walter Coppe (<i>b</i>. 1593, <i>d</i>. in or after 1667), who was probably a literate artisan, perhaps working with animal hides. After the Restoration Walter Coppe secured a seat in the middle aisle of his parish church and was rated at three hearths in Jury Street ward, Warwick.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandeducation"></a>Early life and education</h2>If his later confession is to be believed Abiezer Coppe's youth was marked by a godly litany of zealous devotion: fervent prayer &#145;by heart&#146;, memorizing &#145;much of the Scripture&#146;; frequent and &#145;most secret&#146; fasting; and abasement before God. At thirteen he began to &#145;take and keep&#146; a daily register of his sins, setting them down in a book. To prevent his tongue from speaking sinful words he bridled his mouth, writing upon &#145;Scrouls of Parchment&#146; the inscription &#145;<i>Yea yea, nay, nay</i>&#146; (<span class="roman">Matthew</span> 5: 37), which he &#145;sewed about&#146; his wrists  (Smith, 134&#150;5). As a native of Warwick, Coppe was able to attend the town's free school. At fifteen it appears that Coppe began taking lessons given by the recently appointed master of Warwick School, Thomas Dugard. In his diary entry for 18 October 1634 Dugard noted that Coppe and two other boys had received instruction from a Greek <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and Homer; further entries in this diary indicate Coppe's progress. Some of Dugard's pupils went on to attend university and it may have been through Dugard's connections that Coppe secured a place at Oxford.<br>
<br>At an unknown date Abiezer Coppe was admitted at All Souls College, Oxford. He matriculated on 20 May 1636, but according to the antiquary Anthony Wood, Coppe continued at All Souls &#145;but for a short time&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.959) before becoming one of the postmasters (a class of poor scholars) of Merton College; Wood thought Coppe's tutor at Merton was Ralph Button (1611/12&#150;1680). Button was, in Wood's estimation, a &#145;rigid presbyterian&#146; but also a &#145;good scholar&#146; and a &#145;noted Tutor&#146; (ibid., 3.381; Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>: <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, 2.158). Coppe's studies at Oxford, however, were curtailed and he left the university without a degree. He returned to Warwick with his ties to Dugard intact and his eyes no doubt set on the ministry. In 1641 Dugard recorded that his former prot&eacute;g&eacute;, though probably unlicensed, was permitted to preach on Palm Sunday and at five Tuesday lectures.<h2>
<a name="ThecivilwarandimprisonmentinCoventry"></a>The civil war and imprisonment in Coventry</h2>On 9 June 1644, after heavy fighting the two previous days, the royalist stronghold of Compton House in Warwickshire fell to local parliamentary forces under the command of Colonel William Purefoy. It seems that by this date Coppe, perhaps through Dugard's influence, had been appointed a chaplain under the command of Major George Purefoy. Coppe was to be stationed with the garrison at Compton House, receiving an initial payment of &pound;35 for thirty-five weeks' service in February 1645. He was present at the muster of the garrison on 23 April 1646, but may have left the army in June 1646 when parliament's troops were removed from Compton House. Richard Baxter, who was at that period preacher to the garrison at Coventry, recalled &#145;I heard of no opinion that he vented or held, but, the Necessity of Re-baptizing, and Independency, and was a sharp Reproacher of the Ministry&#146;  (Baxter, 148).<br>
<br>This deprecating image of Coppe as a fiery, sectarian preacher is seemingly confirmed by apparent autobiographical allusions in Coppe's later prophetic writings. Recounting the spiritual tribulations of a young man &#145;void of understanding&#146;, Coppe describes his bewitchment by the whore of Babylon (<span class="roman">Revelation</span> 17: 5), a flattering, deceitful figure that hunts after him, following him &#145;from street to street, from corner to corner, from grosse Protestantisme to Puritanisme, &amp; c. at length from crosse in baptisme, and Common-Prayer-Book to Presbyterianisme&#146;. Accounting the &#145;eating of a bit of bread, and drinking a sip of wine perhaps once a moneth&#146; a vain form of religion, the young man quickly passes to &#145;Independency, and from thence perhaps to Anabaptisme&#146;  (Coppe, <span class="italic">A Second Fiery Flying Roule</span>, 19&#150;21).<br>
<br>Baxter reckoned that Coppe &#145;continued a most zealous Re-baptizer many years, and re-baptized more then any one man that ever I heard of in the Countrey, witnesse <i>Warwickshire</i>, <i>Oxfordshire</i>, part of <i>Worcestershire</i>, &amp; c.&#146;  (Baxter, 148). Although this may be an exaggeration&#151;perhaps stemming from Coppe's alleged boast that he had &#145;baptized seven thousand people&#146;&#151;it is clear that Coppe was a &#145;leading man&#146; and his standing within the Baptist churches was confirmed by his association with Hanserd Knollys and William Kiffin (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.960; Smith, 147). When Knollys and Kiffin travelled from London to Coventry in the autumn of 1646 to engage in a public disputation with two local ministers, it was Coppe who acted as their scribe. Coppe, moreover, was to revel in the impending day of judgement that he believed awaited those who had maltreated &#145;the Lords Servants; (who come from a farr and strange countrey,)&#146;  (Smith, 54). He recalled that they had subjected one servant to stoning, the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> penalty prescribed for blasphemy (<span class="roman">Leviticus</span> 24: 16) and Coppe's reworking here of a parable in the gospels (<span class="roman">Mark</span> 12: 1&#150;9) resonates with the punishment meted out to Knollys who, by his own testimony, had been driven by this means from the pulpit. Coppe, too, suffered at the hands of persecutors and was imprisoned in Coventry gaol for his &#145;re-baptizing&#146;. Such was the significance of his case that on 28 November 1646 the governor and committee at Coventry wrote to the House of Commons concerning him. Afterwards Coppe claimed that he &#145;sustained a 14 weeks close imprisonment&#146; without &#145;bail or mainprize&#146;&#151;suggesting that he was detained without charge (Smith, 129; Coppe, <span class="italic">A Second Fiery Flying Roule</span>, 20).<h2>
<a name="Conversionexperienceandmoralattitudes"></a>Conversion experience and moral attitudes</h2>In his twenty-eighth year Coppe underwent a profound transformation, an experience that he came to represent as a spiritual passage from death to life. Reflecting upon his former sanctity, his &#145;prayers tears, sighs, groans, watchings, fastings, humiliations&#146;, Coppe recalled his &#145;self-seeking&#146; in first observing and then scorning &#145;carnall&#146; gospel ordinances (Smith, 135; Coppe, <span class="italic">A Second Fiery Flying Roule</span>, 21&#150;2). Hinting at the necessity of having a contrite, &#145;soft heart&#146;, Coppe recounted how &#145;God in his infinite wisdome&#146; had laid low his vanity and levelled his pride&#151;which is the &#145;true and pure levelling&#146; (Smith, 74, 141; Coppe, <span class="italic">A Second Fiery Flying Roule</span>, 22). Reading Obadiah's prophecy of the burning of the house of Jacob (<span class="roman">Obadiah</span> 1: 18) as an allegory of the incendiary appearance of the Lord of hosts upon his &#145;fierce, rugged flesh&#146;, Coppe narrated how his &#145;hatred, strife, envy, malice, evil surmizing&#146; was utterly consumed by the &#145;<i>C&#339;lestiall</i> Fire&#146; of God's love:<blockquote>First, all my strength, my forces were utterly routed, my house I dwelt in fired; my father and mother forsook me, the wife of my bosome loathed me, mine old name was rotted, perished; and I was utterly plagued, consumed, damned, rammed, and sunke into nothing, into the bowels of the still Eternity (my mothers wombe) out of which I came naked, and whereto I returned again naked.(Smith, 78, 45; Coppe, <span class="italic">A Fiery Flying Roll</span>, preface)</blockquote>Coppe lay a while &#145;rapt up in silence&#146;. At length he heard with his &#145;outward care&#146; a most &#145;terrible thunder-clap, and after that a second&#146;. Upon the second thunderclap &#145;I saw a great body of light, like the light of the Sun, and red as fire&#146;, which infused him with great awe and joy. And so he lay &#145;trembling, sweating, and smoaking (for the space of half an houre)&#146; before the immanent presence of the Lord. He was finally reassured that God would take him to heaven, but not before he had drunk a &#145;bitter cup; whereupon (being filled with exceeding amazement) I was throwne into the belly of hell&#146;  (Coppe, <span class="italic">A Fiery Flying Roll</span>, preface). Later he recovered, and in a further vision a &#145;most strong, glorious voyce uttered these words, <i>The Spirits of just men made perfect</i>&#146;. Coppe professed that the &#145;visions and revelations of God&#146; were &#145;stretched&#146; out before him and within him &#145;for the space of foure dayes and nights, without intermission&#146;  (ibid.). Baxter, however, considered that he &#145;was in a long trance &amp; hath seene strange Satanicall delusions&#146;  (DWL, Baxter MS, <span class="italic">Treatises</span>, 3.67, fol. 302<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Coppe emerged from these experiences a resurrected man, with a new name. The &#145;day <i>star</i>&#146; was risen in his heart (<span class="roman">2 Peter</span> 1: 19), and as his erotic coupling of &#145;<i>love</i>&#146; and &#145;<i>dove</i>&#146; suggests (<span class="roman">Song of Solomon</span> 5: 2) Coppe imagined that the &#145;day of the Lord&#146; was at hand (<span class="roman">Isaiah</span> 13: 6)  (Smith, 52, 47). In the manner of John in the book of <span class="roman">Revelation</span>, Coppe presented a powerful vision of the impending apocalypse; similarly he reworked the story of the &#145;filthy blinde Sodomites&#146; who failed to recognize two angels in their midst (<span class="roman">Genesis</span> 19: 11) into a prophecy that &#145;<i>Sodome</i> must be burnt, <i>Lot</i> must be saved, <i>flesh</i> must die &amp; be crucified, and the <i>Spirit</i> live and dwell in the Saints&#146; (Coppe, <span class="italic">A Fiery Flying Roll</span>; Smith, 63). Already<blockquote>There are Angels &hellip; come downe from Heaven, in the shapes and formes of men, who are full of the vengeance of the Lord; and are to poure out the plagues of God upon the Earth, and to torment the Inhabitants thereof. (Coppe, <span class="italic">A Fiery Flying Roll</span>, 8)</blockquote>Coppe claimed that he himself had been &#145;plagued and tormented beyond expression&#146; and he affirmed that he had &#145;rather behold one of these Angels pouring out the plagues of God, cursing; and teaching others to curse bitterly&#146;. Adopting the mantle of an angel (in the form of a man), he inveighed against the hypocrisy of carnal religious observance, announcing that &#145;To the pure all things are pure&#146;  (Coppe, <span class="italic">A Fiery Flying Roll</span>, 8).<br>
<br>Supposing that he had undergone instantaneous transformation Coppe reportedly set about enacting his new principles. It was to be said of him that thinking he was &#145;above Ordinances&#146; and that he was &#145;a childe of God&#146; he began to live &#145;very loosley&#146;, cursing and swearing, &#145;spreading blasphemies, and committing base lewd sins&#146;  (<span class="italic">Severall Proceedings in Parliament</span>, 16, 11&#150;18 Jan 1650, 213). Baxter likewise charged Coppe with unnamed &#145;filthy lascivious practices&#146;, amazed that &#145;such a man should have any followers&#146; and that professedly God fearing men and women should join him in &#145;roaring, drinking, whoring, open full-mouthed swearing ordinarily by the Wounds and Bloud of God, and the fearfullest Cursing that hath been heard, as if they were all possessed with Divels&#146;  (Baxter, 148). Many of these allegations echo, and in some instances perhaps derive from, pronouncements in Coppe's writings. Coppe maintained &#145;It's meat and drink to an Angel [who knows none evill, no sin] to sweare a full mouth'd oath&#146;  (Coppe, <span class="italic">A Second Fiery Flying Roule</span>, 13). In a similar tone he noted that there was a time &#145;to be merry&#146; (<span class="roman">Ecclesiastes</span> 8: 15), a time to partake of the spiritual feast: &#145;To the fatted calfe, ring, shoes, mirth, and Musicke, &amp; c. which is the <i>Lords Supper indeed</i>&#146;  (Smith, 62, 66).<br>
<br>Coppe pointed to the fact that Michal had clearly adopted an inappropriate stance in disapproving of her husband King David's dancing uncovered before the ark of the covenant in celebration of its return to Jerusalem (<span class="roman">2 Samuel</span> 6: 16), a reference which is significant in this context, for it partly anticipates the allegation that it was usual for Coppe to preach &#145;stark naked&#146; by day and to lie drunk with a wench &#145;stark naked&#146; at night  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.960). This association of nudity with sexual licence, though itself familiar from hostile accounts of adult baptism rituals, is suggestive in its depiction of Coppe as an adulterer, for Coppe delighted in citing the scriptural precedent of Hosea, &#145;who went in to a whore&#146; (<span class="roman">Hosea</span> 1: 2).<h2>
<a name="Publicationspreachingandassociates1649"></a>Publications, preaching, and associates, 1649</h2>On 12 November 1648 Coppe received a fraternal letter from Mistress T. P., probably Thomasine Pendarves (<i>bap</i>. 1618, <i>d</i>. in or after 1671), daughter of Thomas Newcomen of Dartmouth and wife of John Pendarves, minister of St Helen's, Abingdon. Coppe responded in a work published as <span class="italic">Some Sweet Sips, of Some Spirituall Wine</span> (1649) with an epistle to his &#145;Deare Sister, in the best fellowship&#146; and with a &#145;<i>Preparatory</i>&#146; epistle intended &#145;only, and primely for that precious <i>Princesse</i> &hellip; another late converted <i>Jew</i>, and for the Saints at <i>Abingdon</i>&#146;  (Coppe, <span class="italic">Some Sweet Sips</span>, 45, 10). These modes of address, together with Coppe's rendering of the initials T. P. into Hebrew, indicate Coppe's identification of the heirs of Abraham born to him by &#145;a <i>freewoman</i>, <i>Jerusalem</i> which is above&#146; (<span class="roman">Galatians</span> 4: 26) with &#145;the Israel of God, the seed of the Lord&#146;  (Smith, 55). This adoption of &#145;<i>Spiritual</i> <i>Israel</i>&#146; as an emblem for &#145;<i>the Land of the living</i>&#146; is a recurring feature of Coppe's <span class="italic">Some Sweet Sips</span>. As its title implied, Abiezer Coppe (his name spelled in Hebrew) <span class="italic">A late converted <span class="smallcap">JEW</span></span>, sought to offer the &#145;<i>bewildered Israelites</i>&#146; who read this book a taste of liberty and happiness &#145;from spirituall Canaan&#146;. For like the two Israelite spies of his title (<span class="roman">Numbers</span> 13: 23), Coppe believed that he had returned from the Holy Land bearing spiritual grapes of &#145;great worth, and weight&#146;  (ibid., 42, 60, 68&#150;9).<br>
<br>Perhaps shortly after Christmas day 1648 Coppe believed that the &#145;<i>word of the Lord</i>&#146; came expressly to him, commanding him to &#145;Go up to <i>London</i>, to <i>London</i>, that great City, write, write, write&#146;. This he revealed in <span class="italic">A Fiery Flying Roll</span> (1649). As he began to write Coppe beheld a hand with &#145;a roll of a book&#146; therein (<span class="roman">Ezekiel</span> 2: 9), &#145;which this fleshly hand would have put wings to, before the time&#146;. Immediately the roll was snatched out of his hand and thrust into his mouth. Like the prophet Ezekiel Coppe was forced to eat the roll&#151;though whereas for Ezekiel the roll was &#145;in my mouth as honey for sweetness&#146; (<span class="roman">Ezekiel</span> 3: 2), for Coppe the roll tasted &#145;as bitter as worm-wood&#146;. There it lay &#145;broiling&#146; and &#145;burning&#146; in his stomach. When Coppe arrived in London about the beginning of January 1649, the &#145;most excellent Majesty&#146; within him unexpectedly set his &#145;forme&#146; in many &#145;strange&#146; postures: this, on his account, received a mixed reception. Imagining that he had been set as &#145;no small signe and wonder in fleshly <i>Israel</i>&#146; (<span class="roman">Isaiah</span> 8: 18), Coppe recalled how he fell down before the feet of cripples, beggars, and lepers, kissing their feet and &#145;resigning up&#146; his money to them  (Coppe, <span class="italic">A Fiery Flying Roll</span>, preface, 1, 13). In <span class="italic">A Second Fiery Flying Roule</span> (1649) Coppe remembered how at the prison in Southwark he sat, ate, and drank with gypsies, hugging and kissing them, putting his hand &#145;in their bosomes, loving the she Gipsies dearly&#146;  (Coppe, <span class="italic">A Second Fiery Flying Roule</span>, 11). Contrasting with this demeanour was Coppe's &#145;<i>strange and lofty carriage towards great ones</i>&#146;. In the open streets of London and Southwark, with his hand &#145;fiercely&#146; stretched out, his hat &#145;cockt up&#146;, his eyes set &#145;as if they would sparkle out&#146;, sometimes &#145;gnashing&#146; his teeth and with a &#145;mighty loud&#146; voice he charged the coaches of &#145;men and women of the greater ranke&#146;, proclaiming the &#145;notable day of the Lord&#146; to them. Thus he acted, day and night, &#145;for the space of 12. or 13. dayes&#146;, without a finger lifted against him, a hair of his head touched, or a hand laid on his clothes  (Coppe, <span class="italic">A Fiery Flying Roll</span>, Contents, 14&#150;15).<br>
<br>While in London, Coppe was said to have &#145;appeared in a most dreadful manner&#146; before a group calling itself &#145;My one flesh&#146;  (Clarkson, 25). Suggestively, this conventicle was known to Giles Calvert, a publisher and bookseller, who issued Coppe's <span class="italic">Some Sweet Sips</span>. About this time Coppe read and transcribed <span class="italic">John the Divine's Divinity</span>, probably by John File. It was printed for Calvert with a preface by Coppe dated 13 January 1649. Two or three days later Coppe preached an inflammatory sermon in the church at St Helen, Bishopsgate. Before a large assembled congregation he caused an uproar by blaspheming and cursing for an hour, allegedly saying &#145;a pox of God take al your prayers hearing, reading, fasting&#146;. Although &#145;guarded by a party of his own&#146;, it seems that Coppe was jostled in the pulpit by some angry Baptists  (<span class="italic">The Ranters Ranting</span>, 1650, 6). Rather than face charges of blasphemy before a magistrate (a felonous and capital offence under the provisions of an ordinance of May 1648) he probably fled into hiding the next day.<br>
<br>In spring or summer 1649 Coppe may have visited John Pordage, rector of Bradfield, Berkshire. Another of Pordage's guests was Richard Coppin, to whose allegedly blasphemous book <span class="italic">Divine Teachings</span> (1649) Coppe contributed a preface. Some time after 7 June, when a lavish thanksgiving dinner was consumed at Grocers' Hall while &#145;hundreds of poor wretches dyed of hunger&#146;  (Coppe, <span class="italic">A Fiery Flying Roll</span>, 12), Coppe completed the writing of <span class="italic">A Fiery Flying Roll</span>. The roll had been broiling and burning in Coppe's stomach, but now it was spewed forth as a blazing text, proclaimed on the title page as &#145;A Word from the Lord to all the Great Ones of the Earth.&#146;  (ibid., title page) and &#145;the last WARNING PIECE at the dreadfull day of JUDGEMENT&#146;  (ibid.). Revelling in the reversal of the old order, in the passing of episcopacy, monarchy, and the House of Lords, the &#145;excellent Majesty&#146; dwelling in Coppe proclaimed that, as in <span class="roman">Ezekiel</span> 21: 27, &#145;<i>I overturn, overturn, overturn</i>&#146;. Disavowing both &#145;sword levelling&#146; and &#145;digging-levelling&#146;, he inveighed against all blood shed in the name of honour, rank, and propriety. The blood of the righteous, the blood of the &#145;hellishly murdered&#146; Levellers &#145;shot to death&#146; in Burford churchyard on 17 May 1649, would be avenged. For the Levellers who had died &#145;Martyrs for God and their Countrey&#146; were but &#145;shadows of most terrible, yet glorious good things&#146; to come. God himself was the &#145;mighty Leveller&#146;, whose coming was imminent  (Coppe, <span class="italic">A Fiery Flying Roll</span>, 1, 2, 4, 11).<br>
<br>On Sunday 30 September 1649, while riding through an open field, Coppe recounted that he met a poor, deformed man. Moved by the beggar's plight, Coppe was tempted to give him 6<i>d</i>. Having only a shilling coin, he asked the beggar for change, but when the beggar replied that he had none, Coppe rode away without giving him anything. But then, by God's judgement he &#145;was struck down dead&#146; and &#145;my money perisht with me&#146;. The tale, which Coppe claimed was a &#145;true story&#146;, illustrates that he believed he was living in the &#145;last daies&#146; (<span class="roman">James</span> 5: 3) when cankered gold and silver would rise up like fire in judgement against those that forbore from casting all into &#145;the Treasury&#146; (<span class="roman">Mark</span> 12: 43). For only those who accounted nothing their own, who had &#145;ALL THINGS common&#146; (<span class="roman">Acts</span> 2: 44), would have &#145;<i>treasure in heaven</i>&#146; (<span class="roman">Matthew</span> 19: 21)  (Coppe, <span class="italic">A Second Fiery Flying Roule</span>, 4, 6, 16, 22, 4). Towards the end of the year Coppe completed the writing of <span class="italic">A Second Fiery Flying Roule: to All the Inhabitants of the Earth; Specially to the Rich Ones</span>. As with <span class="italic">A Fiery Flying Roll</span> he believed that the word of the Lord came expressly to him. The two rolls were printed in London, probably by the same printer though at different times, and issued together by an anonymous publisher &#145;in the beginning of that notable day, wherein the secrets of all hearts are laid open; and wherein the worst and foulest of villanies, are discovered, under the best and fairest outsides&#146;  (Coppe, <span class="italic">A Fiery Flying Roll</span>, title-page).<h2>
<a name="CoppethegreatAnabaptistorthegreatRanter"></a>Coppe&#151;the great Anabaptist or the great Ranter?</h2>On 18 December 1649 the council of state issued warrants for the apprehension of Coppe and the seizure of his &#145;Mad, and Blasphemous Bookes, called the <span class="roman">fyery flyinge Role</span>&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 25/63, 408). By 8 January 1650 he had been taken into custody and imprisoned in Warwick. On 10 January a party of soldiers hurried &#145;<i>the great Anabaptist</i>&#146; from Warwick to Coventry gaol  (<span class="italic">A Perfect Diurnall of some Passages and Proceedings</span>, no. 6, 14&#150;21 Jan 1650, 42). On 1 February the House of Commons ordered that all printed copies of <span class="italic">A Fiery Flying Roll</span> &#145;be burnt by the Hand of the Hangman, at the <i>New Palace Yard</i>, at <i>Westminster</i>; the <i>Exchange</i>, in <i>Cheapside</i>; and at the <i>Market Place</i>, in <i>Southwark</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 6.354). The next day the council of state ordered that Coppe be brought to London, but he seems to have languished in the noxious conditions of his confinement and &#145;being not well, desired he might not take the journey as yet, least it should cost him his life&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Perfect Diurnall of some Passages and Proceedings</span>, no. 9, 4&#150;11 Feb 1650, 76). By late March several denunciations of Coppe's professed doctrines had appeared. Gerrard Winstanley condemned &#145;the Ranting Practise&#146; as a &#145;Kingdome that lies in objects; As in the outward enjoyment of meat, drinke, pleasures, and women&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Works of Gerrard Winstanley</span>, ed. G. Sabine, 1941, 399), while the London Baptist churches were likewise quick to issue a collective epistle censuring the abominations espoused by their former co-religionist and his associates.<br>
<br>On 6 March Andrew Wyke, a Baptist preacher and possibly pastor to a Baptist congregation at Colchester, arrived in Coventry with his kinswoman. He may have brought money with him, collected by provincial Baptist churches, to help pay for Coppe's prison debts. He was soon joined by Joseph Salmon, formerly chaplain to Commissary-General Henry Ireton's regiment of horse and a comrade of Coppe's. Both were swiftly committed to Coventry gaol for the misdemeanour of swearing and for defying an order prohibiting the visiting of Coppe. On 19 March Coppe was transferred to Newgate on the instructions of the council of state. Under suspicion of blasphemy and treason against the state, Coppe wrote to Salmon and Wyke assuring them that:<blockquote>Newgate &hellip; is noe prison to mee while I am inthroned in my Triple heart wch is but one &amp; triangular, which is as firme as a stone, when I my selfe (&Dagger; heere &amp; there <sup>X</sup> and everywhere) raise uppe my selfe &hellip; (Smith, 117)</blockquote>An act of 10 May for suppressing incest, adultery, and fornication was followed on 28 June by an act against profane swearing and cursing and on 9 August by an act against blasphemy that prescribed six months' imprisonment without bail or mainprize for a first offence&#151;a more lenient sentence than the death penalty decreed by Mosaic Law and an ordinance of 2 May 1648. Although this legislation can be seen as part of a wider programme designed to further the cause of godly reformation in doctrine and manners, it is also evident that the impetus for these measures came from a parliamentary majority's desire to extinguish &#145;the several abominable Practices of a Sect called Ranters&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 6.427). Coppe was still more specific, claiming he had been informed that the acts against adultery and blasphemy &#145;were put out because of me; thereby secretly intimating that I was guilty of the breach of them&#146;  (Coppe, <span class="italic">Remonstrance of the Severe and Zealous Protestation of Abiezer Coppe</span>, 1).<br>
<br>On 27 September Lawrence Clarkson, author of an &#145;impious and blasphemous&#146; book called <span class="italic">A Single Eye All Light, No Darkness</span>, was brought before a parliamentary committee &#145;for suppressing licentious and impious Practices, under pretence of Religion, Liberty, &amp; c.&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 6.474). In his published spiritual autobiography Clarkson was to write disingenuously how, during his examination, he confessed to knowing Coppe, &#145;and that is all, for I have not seen him above two or three times&#146;  (Clarkson, 31). On 1 October, seventy-four days after parliament had ordered the MP for Warwick to convey to the council of state their concern that Coppe be &#145;speedily&#146; brought to trial, Coppe, again described as &#145;the great Ranter&#146;, was brought before the same committee that had examined Clarkson (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 6.444; <span class="italic">The Weekly Intelligencer of the Common-Wealth</span>, 2, 1&#150;8 Oct 1650, 16). It was said that when Coppe appeared he refused to remove his hat in deference. In the manner of David before Achish, the king of Gath (1 <span class="roman">Samuel</span> 21: 10&#150;15), Coppe &#145;disguised himself into a madnesse&#146;. When questioned he seemed to talk to himself, &#145;which some thought to be Gods just judgement upon him&#146; (ibid.; <span class="italic">The Routing of the Ranters</span>, 1650, 2). At other times he flung apples, pears, and nutshells about the room. The committee sent him back to Newgate: there was to be no public trial.<h2>
<a name="Recantations"></a>Recantations?</h2>By 3 January 1651 Coppe had completed, not so much for his &#145;own sake (for my pure innocence supports me)&#146;, but for the &#145;sakes of others&#146; <span class="italic">A Remonstrance of the Sincere and Zealous Protestation of Abiezer Coppe</span> (1651). Written as &#145;a Preamble to a farther future Declaration&#146;, this brief yet defiant pamphlet was Coppe's unrepentant response to the <span class="roman">Blasphemy Act</span>  (Coppe, <span class="italic">Remonstrance</span>, 1651, title-page, 1). On 30 May he penned a &#145;humble Petition&#146; to the parliament and council of state. Lamenting his &#145;<i>sore, tedious, and long continued imprisonment</i>&#146;, an apologetic Coppe emotively recounted the misfortunes his &#145;<i>poor disconsolate wife</i>&#146; and &#145;<i>small innocent children</i>&#146; had suffered on his account. Appended to this supplicatory epistle was a tract entitled &#145;Truth asserted against, and triumphing over error&#146;. Here Coppe presented a refutation of the &#145;several blasphemous opinions&#146; hinted at in &#145;the <span class="italic">Fiery flying role</span>&#146;. Yet rather than acknowledge authorship of this work, Coppe contented himself with a catalogue of &#145;severall Errors&#146; (some of which he denied having been &#145;tackt or tainted&#146; with &#145;in the least degree&#146;) and a casuistical assertion of the several &#145;contrary Truths&#146;  (Smith, 125, 127, 128, 137, 151, 155, 157).<br>
<br>On 22 June, John Durie and some unnamed persons conferred with Coppe. They found him to be &#145;ingenuously open&#146; in what he said and &#145;truly penitent&#146; for what he had done. The next day Durie wrote to Coppe inviting him to explain his views on matters such as sin, God's law, resurrection, and judgement. Mindful that Coppe might profess repentance outwardly only to gain his liberty, Durie warned him not to dissemble. In response Coppe sought to convince Durie of the sincerity of his repentance, remarking that he had been persuaded that never had any man &#145;lien more under the wrath and heavy displeasure of God for sin, then I have done&#146;. That same day Coppe also replied to the proposals of the Commonwealth propagandist Marchamont Nedham. Coppe assured Nedham that he had made the necessary changes to his recantation &#145;by deleating what might prove offensive&#146;, &#145;altering, correcting, and amending other things&#146;, and by &#145;explicating some other things that might appear dubious, or difficult&#146;  (Smith, 146&#150;7, 152, 156&#150;7). Some time after 28 June, perhaps through the intervention of Durie and Nedham, Coppe was finally released from Newgate.<br>
<br>On Sunday 21 September 1651 Coppe preached near Witney, Oxfordshire. His text, apparently, was &#145;There is a time to sing, and a time to dance&#146; (<span class="roman">Ecclesiastes</span> 3: 4). Some who heard him thought he said &#145;that the whole Scripture from the beginning of <span class="roman">genesis</span> to the end of the <span class="roman">Revelations</span> was to be understood allegorically&#146;  (Tickell, 80). On 23 September he preached a recantation sermon on <span class="roman">Isaiah</span> 42: 24 at Burford church from the very pulpit where in 1649 Cornet Henry Denne had preached obedience to the Commonwealth after witnessing the execution of three of his fellow mutineers in the churchyard. Before Coppe was able to ascend the pulpit, however, he found his place usurped by John Tickell, minister of St Helen's, Abingdon. Preaching what appears to have been a prepared sermon on <span class="roman">Galatians</span> 1: 8&#150;9, Tickell took the opportunity to insinuate that Coppe was accused for having preached a false gospel, and when his own address appeared as <span class="italic">The Bottomless Pit Smoaking in Familisme</span> (1651) he observed that in his sermon Coppe &#145;againe and againe&#146; made &#145;assertions of divine truth under execrations&#146;. While he suspected Coppe's conversion, Tickell contented himself with the thought that &#145;God is his judge and knowes his heart&#146;  (Tickell, 32, 34, and &#145;To the reader&#146;).<h2>
<a name="Lastworkandfinalyears"></a>Last work and final years</h2>Towards the end of February 1655, while lodging at The Mermaid by the Mews at Charing Cross, George Fox recalled that Colonel Packer and his officers came in with Coppe and &#145;a great company of ranters&#146;, who having ordered drink and tobacco &#145;bowed &amp; scraped on to another&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of George Fox</span>, 1.165). This portrayal of Coppe as an obsequious man who indulged his carnal appetite is typical of Fox and his censorious accounts of Ranter behaviour. The reference to William Packer, however, a Baptist army officer and preacher, may suggest that by this date Coppe had been re-embraced by some within the Baptist fold.<br>
<br>In January 1657 there appeared a broadside, <span class="italic">Divine Fire-works, or, Some Sparkles from the Spirit of Burning in this Dead Letter</span>. This warning was delivered &#145;In <i>ABH</i>I<i>AM</i>&#146;, perhaps a contraction for &#145;In Ab(iezer ?) I am&#146; <i>cf</i>. <span class="roman">Exodus</span> 3: 14, (&#145;<span class="smallcap">I AM THAT I AM</span>&#146;). The author prophesied the coming that year of the &#145;roaring ramping Lyon, with the sharp two-edged Sword&#146; (<span class="roman">Revelation</span> 5: 5, 19: 15) and the &#145;consuming fire&#146; (<span class="roman">Hebrews</span> 12: 29). The proclamation of this message, given by one who with fear and trembling claimed to have seen &#145;the Lord the King&#146;, may have coincided with Coppe's assumption of the prophetic name Hiam.<br>
<br>After this Coppe is lost to view, until, on 13 February 1667, Abiezer Hiam, alias Coppe of the city of London, having subscribed to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion</span>, was granted licence to practise medicine and surgery. Of the four physicians who provided Coppe with letters testimonial, two were prominent Baptists. It may be that for the remainder of his life Coppe practised medicine under the name Hiam. On 23 August 1672 one Hiam was buried at St Mary's, Barnes, Surrey. Although no one named Hiam is recorded either as a tenant of the manor of Barnes, or in the surviving hearth tax returns for the parish, there seems little reason to doubt that the dead man was Coppe.<br>
<br>In 1680 there appeared a broadside, <span class="italic">A Character of a True Christian</span>, the purported author of which was &#145;Abiezar Copp&#146;. Its style, however, conforms to no known work by Coppe. Some years later Anthony Wood compiled a brief biography of Coppe as part of his monumental <span class="italic">Athenae Oxonienses</span>, 2 vols. (1691&#150;2). Drawing on manuscripts, printed texts, and oral testimony of sometimes questionable veracity, Wood's depiction of Coppe as a lascivious blasphemer has exercised a lasting influence. Some anecdotes, notably the tales of Coppe's misdeeds as an undergraduate and later as a Ranter, appear little more than prurient gossip. Other statements, such as the remark that, after the Restoration, Coppe preached in conventicles, though as yet unsubstantiated, seem more credible. Wood brought Coppe's life to an end by surmizing that he was &#145;brought low by certain infirmities which he had contracted in his rambles by drinking and whoring&#146;. He mentioned Coppe's burial as &#145;Dr Higham on the south side of the body of the church&#146; at Barnes, &#145;under the seats&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.961&#150;2). This church was largely destroyed by fire in 1978, however, and Coppe's bones may now lie under the Langton chapel in the rebuilt church.<br>
