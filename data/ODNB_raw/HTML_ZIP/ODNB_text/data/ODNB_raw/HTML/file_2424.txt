<span class="headword">Binns,  John</span>  (1772&#150;1860), <span class="occ">radical and journalist</span>, was born in Dublin on 22 December 1772, the second son of John Binns (<i>d</i>. 1774), a well-to-do ironmonger active in local politics, and Mary Pemberton. In 1774 his father was lost at sea returning from a trip to England. John was educated at a common school and then at a classical academy, but when he was about ten he and his elder brother, Benjamin, left the house of their mother's second husband, George McEntegart, in Drogheda and walked to Dublin, where they were taken in by their grandfather. In 1786 John was apprenticed to a soap-boiler.<br>
<br>In April 1794 the Binns brothers moved to London. For a while they lived off funds from their father's estate, then Benjamin set up in business as a plumber with John as his assistant. John made the acquaintance of Francis Place, and towards the end of 1794 he joined the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42297/', "London Corresponding Society (LCS)")</script>. He rapidly became an influential member of the society, chairing the general committee, and on 26 October 1795 he chaired the open-air public meeting held at Copenhagen House to protest against the two new &#145;treason and sedition bills&#146;. His radical activities led to involvement in debating clubs and, probably some time in 1796, he entered into a partnership with two notable radical speakers, John Gale Jones and William Wright, to manage debating rooms of their own in the Strand. Early in 1796, in an attempt to revitalize the radical movement, the LCS resolved to send delegates into the provinces to encourage similar, but struggling, societies. Binns travelled to Portsmouth to assist the local radicals, but was recalled to London when the LCS heard of a plot to press him into the navy. Shortly afterwards, in company with Gale Jones, he journeyed to Birmingham. Here, while addressing separate meetings, both men were arrested and charged with uttering seditious words. Released on bail, it was over a year before they were brought to trial. Gale Jones was found guilty at the Warwick spring assize in 1797, but never sentenced; Binns was acquitted at the following summer assize.<br>
<br>In the period between his arrest and trial Binns returned briefly to Dublin. Back in London, following his acquittal, both he and his brother became involved in the shadowy organization of United Englishmen or United Britons, which linked extremist English radicals and Irish revolutionaries. Binns's own <span class="italic">Recollections</span> is rather coy about these links and the intentions of the radicals, but information surviving in government papers, while fragmentary, suggests that John and his brother were much more deeply implicated in conspiracy and the attempts of the United Irishmen to enlist French military assistance than his own account implies. The Binns brothers were closely involved with both Arthur O'Connor, editor of <span class="italic">The Press</span>, the semi-official paper of the United Irishmen, and Father James Coigley, a Catholic priest who acted as an emissary from the United Irishmen to both France and the United Englishmen. Early in 1798 John travelled to Kent seeking to arrange passage to France for O'Connor and Coigley. On 28 February he was arrested in Margate, together with O'Connor, Coigley, and their two servants. Charged with high treason, the five were imprisoned in the Tower of London before being tried at the assizes held in Maidstone in May. Leading members of the parliamentary opposition testified on O'Connor's behalf and the government was reluctant to reveal the origins of its secret information on the United Irishmen. As a result all were acquitted, except Coigley, who had been arrested with incriminating correspondence in his pocket, and who was executed on 7 June. Although acquitted, Binns decided to lie low for a while with friends in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire; during this period he used his mother's maiden name of Pemberton. Towards the end of 1798 he returned to London and went to work in a blacksmith's shop at St Pancras. When the government launched another attack on the popular radicals in March 1799, Binns was arrested under the suspension of the <span class="roman">Habeas Corpus Act</span>. From May 1799 until February 1801 he was incarcerated, without charge, in Gloucester gaol.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1801 Binns left England for the United States, never to return. He settled initially in Northumberland, Pennsylvania, where he began a new career as a political journalist, first with the <span class="italic">Northumberland Gazette</span> and then with his own successful newspaper, the <span class="italic">Republican Argus</span>. He opened a large printing house and book shop, and in 1806 he married another British emigrant, Mary Ann Bagster (<i>c</i>.1783&#150;1852?). The marriage ceremony was conducted by Joseph Priestley, who was also resident in Northumberland. Early in 1807 Binns moved to Philadelphia, where he established another successful newspaper, the <span class="italic">Democratic Press</span>, on which he continued to work until 1829. He became an alderman of Philadelphia in 1822, and, in spite of a decline in his fortunes and the popularity of his paper, he continued to hold this position until 1844. He published his <span class="italic">Recollections of the life of John Binns: twenty-nine years in Europe and fifty-three in the United States</span> in Philadelphia in 1854. He died there, in relative obscurity, on 16 June 1860.<br>
