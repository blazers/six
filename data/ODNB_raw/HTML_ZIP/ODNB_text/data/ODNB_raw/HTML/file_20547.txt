<span class="headword">O'Doherty,  William James</span>  (1835&#150;1868), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born in Dublin. Of his parents or early education, nothing is known. From 1848 to 1853 he studied in the Government School of Design attached to the Royal Dublin Society, with the intention of becoming a painter, but, on the advice of Constantine Panormo, at that time one of the assistant masters, he turned his attention to modelling. He won several prizes for this, including a bronze medal in 1853 for <span class="italic">Night</span>, after Bertel Thorvaldsen, and <span class="italic">Boy and Bird</span>&#151;both shown at the great Industrial Exhibition in Dublin in 1853. On the death of Panormo in 1852, he studied under his successor in the school of design, Joseph R. Kirk, until 1854, when, at the suggestion of the sculptor John Edward Jones, he went to London.<br>
<br>O'Doherty's first appearance at the Royal Academy was in 1857, when he exhibited, under the name of Dogherty, a plaster model of <span class="italic">Gondoline</span>, a subject taken from the poems of Henry Kirke White, and which he afterwards executed in marble for the banker R. C. L. Bevan. In 1860 he sent to the Royal Academy the model of the marble statue of <span class="italic">Erin</span>, executed for the marquess of Downshire; an engraving of it by T. W. Knight appeared in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> of 1861. Both in 1860 and in 1861, when he sent to the British Institution <span class="italic">One of the Surrey Volunteers</span>, his works appeared under the name of Doherty; but in 1862 he appears to have reverted to O'Doherty. His subsequent works included <span class="italic">Alethe</span>, a marble statuette executed for Bevan and exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1862, and some portrait busts exhibited in 1863 and 1864. He went to Rome in 1864 to pursue his studies and to execute a commission for the marquess of Downshire, the subject of which was to be &#145;the martyr&#146;. O'Doherty never married and his last years are obscure. His early death in February 1868, at La Charit&eacute; Hospital in Berlin while on a visit to that city, ended a brief career of much promise.<br>
