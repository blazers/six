<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Adler,  Hermann</span>  (1839&#150;1911), <span class="occ">chief rabbi</span>, was born in Hanover on 30 May 1839, the second son of two sons and three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/167/', "Nathan Marcus Adler (1803&#150;1890)")</script>, then chief rabbi of Hanover, and his first wife, Henrietta Worms (<i>d</i>. 1854). In June 1845 the family moved to London, where Nathan Adler was installed as chief rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations. Hermann attended University College School and University College, London, graduating BA in 1854. He determined to follow his father into the rabbinate, and carried out a range of ecclesiastical duties while pursuing private study. In 1860 his father sent him to Prague, where two years later he received rabbinical ordination from S. J. Rapoport, chief rabbi there. In December 1862 he obtained from the University of Leipzig the degree of PhD for a thesis on druidism.<br>
<br>In practice Adler acted henceforth as secretary and assistant to his father, who was clearly grooming him to succeed to his office. In 1863 Adler was appointed temporary principal of Jews' College, London, where he taught until 1879 and to the chairmanship of which he ultimately succeeded in 1887. In February 1864 he became first minister at the fashionable Bayswater synagogue. On 3 September 1867 he married Rachel (<i>d</i>. 1912), elder daughter of Solomon Joseph, a well-to-do businessman. They had two daughters and a son. Adler took a particular interest in Jewish education, establishing schools in Bayswater and making arrangements for Jewish religious instruction at schools of the London school board in the East End. It was during these two decades&#151;the 1860s and 1870s&#151;that Adler perfected his skills as a preacher; it is doubtful whether the Anglo-Jewish sermon has ever reached greater heights as an art form.<br>
<br>It was also in this period that Adler met and made friends with a wide range of non-Jews occupying positions of authority and influence in government and society. In time he came to move in the very highest social circles. Well spoken, dignified, and cultured, Adler came to be regarded by them as the respectable face of Jewish Orthodoxy, conforming to Orthodox norms but eschewing extremes. When his father practically retired from office in 1879, it was a foregone conclusion that he would become &#145;delegate&#146; chief rabbi. And it was regarded as inevitable that he should succeed to the office following his father's death, as he did in 1891.<br>
<br>Adler moved easily and with grace in the world of high society, and he deliberately used this status to bolster and reinforce his authority within the Jewish world. He saw himself as, and wished others to think of himself as, the Jewish equivalent of the archbishop of Canterbury. He wore gaiters and &#145;canonicals&#146;. He styled himself &#145;the very reverend&#146;, a term unknown in the Jewish canon. His name was a byword for patriotism. He was also an avowed tory, preaching in favour of the South African War even though he must have known how controversial that conflict was within British politics. He became a good friend of the future Edward VII, who enjoyed his company (the king is said to have referred to him as &#145;my Chief Rabbi&#146;) and appointed him a commander in the Royal Victorian Order, an honour conferred for personal services rendered to the monarch or to members of the royal family.<br>
<br>Yet as Adler's stature increased within the non-Jewish world, it fell within the Jewish. Adler, unlike his father, was no Talmudic scholar. Unlike his father, he was latitudinarian in his religious outlook. Although, in a famous incident in 1892, he vetoed the appointment of Morris Joseph as minister of the newly constructed Hampstead synagogue on account of Joseph's Reformist leanings, Adler was himself prepared to sanction practices which were at variance with the strictest interpretations of Jewish Orthodoxy&#151;for instance, the introduction of verbal consents by the bride and bridegroom in the marriage service. In mid-Victorian Britain, where the moneyed and interrelated &#145;cousinhood&#146; ruled Anglo-Jewry, Adler's interpretation of Orthodoxy fitted perfectly. But as the pace of immigration to Britain of Jews from Russia and Poland increased during the 1880s and 1890s, his position became increasingly fraught.<br>
<br>Between 1880 and 1906 a &#145;native&#146; Anglo-Jewry of some 60,000 souls was swamped by at least twice as many Jewish immigrants. Adler's chief rabbinate was deeply scarred by a series of conflicts with this immigrant body. His right-wing, anti-socialist, and anti-trade-unionist views were not welcomed in the slums of Whitechapel, Leeds, or Manchester into which the immigrant Jewish poor settled in large numbers. It is true that he identified himself with a number of public protests against the persecution of Jews in tsarist Russia. It is equally true that he used his influence to try to stem the refugee tide, and that he refused to condemn the passage of the <span class="roman">Aliens Act</span> of 1905, passed in response to a wave of &#145;anti-alien&#146; sentiment. Among the immigrants Zionism was a popular creed. Adler (along with almost all the Anglo-Jewish establishment) viewed the idea of a separate Jewish nationality as anathema and likely to jeopardize emancipation. Addressing the Anglo-Jewish Association in July 1897, he condemned the forthcoming First Zionist Congress (summoned in Basel by Theodor Herzl) as &#145;an egregious blunder&#146;, and for good measure he denounced the very idea of a Jewish state as &#145;contrary to Jewish principles&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>, 16 July 1897, 13). Adler distinguished himself as the only western European rabbi to contribute to a collection of anti-Zionist essays published in Warsaw in 1900.<br>
<br>Of all the disputes Adler entered into with the immigrants, none was more bitter, or more bitterly fought, than those which stemmed from his interpretation of Jewish religious law. He permitted mixed-sex choirs in synagogues under his control. He turned a blind eye to palpable infringements of Orthodox practice regarding the preparation and sale of kosher meat and poultry, with the result that in London's East End, and in Liverpool and Manchester, his religious authority in these matters was openly defied. In eastern Europe every Jewish community had its own rabbi. Adler's insistence on being recognized as a unique rabbinical authority, not even subject to the rulings of his own <i>beth din</i> (ecclesiastical court), brought him into ridicule. Worse still, it threatened to bring schism into Anglo-Jewry. Adler's authority was only restored, in 1905, through the efforts of Samuel Montagu, first Baron Swaythling, the staunchly Orthodox Liberal politician and founder (1887) of the Federation of Synagogues.<br>
<br>Adler continued for the remainder of his life to be dogged by conflict and confrontation with immigrant rabbis, whose refusal to acknowledge his suzerainty he regarded with the deepest anger. Though clever, up to a point, he was not a wise man. He understood the limitations neither of his own intellect nor, in changing circumstances, those of his own office. In seeking to reinforce the legitimacy of that office through the support of the non-Jewish world Adler scored a dazzling but short-term victory. His death was mourned, but he himself was unloved by the Yiddish-speaking poor who now formed the majority of Anglo-Jewry.<br>
<br>Adler died of heart failure on 18 July 1911 at his residence, 6 Craven Hill, London, and was buried in the Willesden cemetery of the United Synagogue. His elder daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57022/', "Henrietta (Nettie) Adler (1868&#150;1950)")</script>, became one of the first women to sit on the London county council. A son, Alfred, entered the Jewish ministry but predeceased his father.<br>
