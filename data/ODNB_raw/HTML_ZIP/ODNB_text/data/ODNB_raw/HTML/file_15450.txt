<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ker,  John</span>, first duke of Roxburghe  (<em>c.</em>1680&#150;1741), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the second of three children of Robert, third earl of Roxburghe (<i>c</i>.1658&#150;1682) and his wife, Margaret (1658&#150;1753), eldest daughter of John, first marquess of Tweeddale. On 13 July 1696 Roxburghe's elder brother, Robert, fourth earl of Roxburghe, died, aged eighteen, and Roxburghe was served heir male and of entail to his brother on 22 October.<br>
<br>Roxburghe played a significant part in Scottish politics in the years from 1702 onwards. George Lockhart of Carnwath, who was normally a political opponent of Roxburghe, wrote that Roxburghe:<blockquote>was a man of good sense, improven by so much reading and learning that, perhaps, he was the best accomplish'd young man in Europe, and had so charming a way of expressing his thoughts, that he pleased even those 'gainst whom he spoke. (Lockhart, 1.95)</blockquote>James, second duke of Queensberry, who led Queen Anne's Scottish administration, was keen to discredit his opponents, regardless of whether they were Jacobites or, as in the case of Roxburghe, his fellow whigs. In the winter of 1703&#150;4 Roxburghe, John, ninth earl of Rothes, and George Baillie of Jerviswood went to London to counter the disinformation that Queensberry was spreading about them. They were successful, and Sidney, first earl of Godolphin, head of Anne's English administration, had Queensberry sacked. In 1704 John, second marquess of Tweeddale, formed a new Scottish administration, composed of whigs formerly in opposition: they were known as the &#145;new party&#146;, and subsequently as the squadrone. Roxburghe served as secretary in this administration, from October 1704 to May 1705.<br>
<br>Tweeddale's ministry were discredited by their acquiescing in the judicial lynching at Leith, in March 1705, of the crew of an English ship, the <i>Worcester</i>. They were promptly replaced by a ministry made up of Queensberry's cronies under John, second duke of Argyll. None the less the squadrone, once again in opposition, decided to support the Scottish government in the votes that led to the Union of 1707. Recent historians have given much of the credit for this decision to Roxburghe. He believed, or at any rate self-interestedly professed to believe, that the Scottish parliament would vote for union. He phrased this belief succinctly in a letter of 28 November 1705 to George Baillie: &#145;The motives will be, Trade with most, Hanover with some, ease and security with others&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of George Baillie</span>, 138).<br>
<br>Under the terms for the Union the Scots were to be compensated for undertaking to help service the pre-Union English national debt. The squadrone were duped into thinking that they would be allowed to help disburse this &#145;equivalent&#146; money, but this did not happen. As a sop to Roxburghe's pride he was on 25 April 1707 created duke of Roxburghe, marquess of Bowmont and Cessford, earl of Kelso, viscount of Broxmouth, and Lord Ker of Cessford and Caverton, with the same remainder of these dignities as that of the earldom of Roxburghe. This was the last title ever created in the peerage of Scotland. On 1 January 1708 he married Mary (1677&#150;1718), widow of William Savile, second marquess of Halifax, and eldest daughter of Daniel Finch, second earl of Nottingham. Their only child, Robert, was born about 1709, and succeeded his father as second duke of Roxburghe.<br>
<br>Roxburghe continued to play a part in the politics of the newly created British state. He was elected as one of the sixteen representative peers of Scotland in the general elections of 1707, 1708, 1715, and 1722. In March 1709 he was sworn of the privy council. From 1 August to 28 September 1714 he served as one of the lords regent, before the safe arrival in Britain of George I. In November 1715 he served as a volunteer soldier in the Hanoverian army that checked the Jacobite rising at the battle of Sheriffmuir. He was keeper of the privy seal of Scotland from 1714 to 1716, and then became the third (Scottish) secretary of state.<br>
<br>As in the period before 1707 Roxburghe was involved in the competition and jealousies among Scottish whigs. He supported the <span class="roman">Peerage Bill</span> of 1719 and, though he was created a knight of the Garter in 1722, he backed John Carteret rather than the rising star, Sir Robert Walpole. Walpole seized the opportunity of the Shawfield riot to dismiss Roxburghe from office in August 1725, following upon a report by Archibald, earl of Ilay, that in Scotland &#145;by a long series of no-administration, the mere letter of the law had little or no effect with the people&#146;  (Coxe, 1.232).<br>
<br>Thereafter Roxburghe, though he acted as deputy high constable (Scotland) at the coronation of George II in 1727, lived largely in political retirement. He did not stand for election as a representative peer in 1727, nor did he attend the election at Holyrood Palace. Floors Castle, Roxburghshire, had been built for him by Sir John Vanbrugh in 1718. He died on 27 February 1741 at Floors, aged about sixty, and was buried at Bowden parish church, also in Roxburghshire.<br>
