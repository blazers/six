<span class="headword">Butler, Sir  Montagu Sherard Dawes</span>  (1873&#150;1952), <span class="occ">administrator in India and college head</span>, born at Julian Hill, Harrow, on 19 May 1873, was the third son of Spencer Perceval Butler, barrister, of Lincoln's Inn, later conveyancing counsel to the High Court of Justice and the office of works, and his wife, Mary, only child of the Revd Nicholas Kendall of Bodmin. As such he belonged to one of the famous Cambridge academic families, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32213/', "Henry Montagu Butler (1833&#150;1918)")</script> being his uncle. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32218/', "Sir (Spencer) Harcourt Butler")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32211/', "Sir (George) Geoffrey Gilbert Butler")</script> were his brothers. Montagu Butler was at school at Haileybury College and was admitted to Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1891. He gained first classes in both parts of the classical tripos (1894&#150;5) with distinction in the second part; he was president of the union, coxswain of the college boat, and one of the founders of the May week ball. Elected into a fellowship in 1895, he decided to enter public service; in 1896 he headed the examination list for the Indian Civil Service, and was awarded the Bhaunagar medal.<br>
<br>Late in 1896 Butler went to the Punjab, where his administrative ability was quickly recognized. In 1901 he married Anne Gertrude (1876&#150;1954), daughter of George Smith, and sister of George Adam Smith. They had two sons and two daughters, the elder son being <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30886/', "Richard Austen Butler")</script>, the politician, and one of the daughters <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70780/', "Dorothy Middleton (1909&#150;1999)")</script>, author of <span class="italic">Victorian Lady Travellers</span>. Butler was settlement officer of Kotah state in 1904&#150;9, and in 1912&#150;15 was joint secretary of the royal commission on public services in India. During the First World War, when he was deputy commissioner of Attock, he was active in the recruitment drive for the Indian army in the Punjab. In 1921, after the constitutional reforms enacted in 1919 had reconstituted the Indian legislatures, he became president of the legislative council of the province. In the next year he was appointed secretary to the government of India in the department of education, health, and lands, and in 1924 he was made president of the council of state.<br>
<br>Butler was transferred to Nagpur as governor of the Central Provinces in 1925 and had to face the many problems created by the nationalist non-co-operation movement in the legislature. Butler aimed always at government by agreement, and would exercise infinite patience in the reconciliation of opposing views. He drove a wedge into the phalanx of non-co-operation by appointing a <i>swarajist</i> leader as home member and succeeded in bringing other non-co-operators into responsible posts. During his second term of office as governor he was confronted by a revival of civil disobedience under the leadership of M. K. Gandhi, and endeavoured, wherever possible, to deal with offenders under the ordinary law, without invoking the aid of the special powers given by the government of India.<br>
<br>Butler's consistent record of work for the welfare of India was recognized by his appointment as CIE (1909), CVO (1911), CB (1916), CBE (1919), and KCSI (1924). In 1933 he resigned to become lieutenant-governor of the Isle of Man. There, his insistence on a balanced budget provoked some preliminary opposition, but it was not long before his measures of reform were accepted, and he remained there for four years. Of his many appointments, none gave him such intense pleasure as his election to the mastership of his old college, Pembroke, in 1937, for which he had always harboured great affection. He had been made an honorary fellow in 1925 and had sent both his sons there. The mastership was no sinecure: Pembroke was only just beginning to recover from a series of disastrous losses in 1935, and Butler set about reorganizing its finances. He willingly accepted invitations to serve on the borough council as well as on the council of the senate and the financial board of the university.<br>
<br>The outbreak of war upset many of Butler's plans for the college, but it served to intensify rather than to diminish his activity. Shortly after his election as mayor of Cambridge in November 1941 he was knocked down by an ambulance and severely injured during a tour of air-raid posts in the blackout; he recovered to serve an additional term as mayor. Similarly, he was delighted when the college extended his tenure of the mastership to the statutory limit. He retired in 1948, but even then retained his seat on the borough council as an alderman. He died suddenly in the Evelyn Nursing Home, Cambridge, on 7 November 1952.<br>
