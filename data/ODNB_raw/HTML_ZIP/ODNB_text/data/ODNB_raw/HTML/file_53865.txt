<span class="headword">Worsdale,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>1766, <em>d.</em> in or after 1828), <span class="occ">astrologer</span>, was born on 2 December 1766 in Fulbeck, near Grantham, Lincolnshire. After working as a parish clerk there, he studied mathematics (and probably astrology) under Nathaniel Tingle of Helpringham, near Sleaford, in 1778. He was writing and practising astrology in Spanby, near Falkingham, by 1796; then in Donington Northope, near Boston; and finally, by 1819, in Lincoln &#145;near the Cathedral&#146;  (J. Worsdale, <span class="italic">Celestial Philosophy</span>, 1828, title page), where he remained until his death.<br>
<br>Worsdale was one of a flourishing community of astrologers and astronomers, throughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, in Lincolnshire, Leicestershire, and Rutland. He wrote several books defending and explicating his subject: <span class="italic">Genethliacal Astrology</span> (1796, 1798); <span class="italic">A Collection of Remarkable Nativities</span> (1799); <span class="italic">The Nativity of Napoleon Bonaparte</span> (1805); <span class="italic">Astronomy and Elementary Philosophy</span> (1819); and <span class="italic">Celestial Philosophy</span> (1828). These were not, however, general or indiscriminate defences. His particular astrology was rigorously purist and highly technical, in the tradition of earlier astrologers such as John Partridge, who still took their mandate from Ptolemy and adhered to a combination of Aristotelian astronomical principles and precise mathematical procedures. As such, he was unforgiving of the &#145;wretched compilations of borrowed and stolen trash&#146;  (<span class="italic">Genethliacal Astronomy</span>, vii) of magical-populist astrologers such as his contemporaries Thomas White and Ebenezer Sibly. At the same time he was equally hostile to the attempts of some of his predecessors, such as John Gadbury, to reform astrology along contemporary scientific lines, which he regarded as ignorant meddling with tradition.<br>
<br>By the time of his death, Worsdale had won some recognition for his efforts from the tiny but disputatious metropolitan astrological community. There can be no doubt, however, that he was obliged to make his living as a judicial astrologer whose services were in demand for astral advice regarding urgent or intractable personal problems. This must have been grating for him, as most of his clients, although probably not all, came from the common people of Lincolnshire whom he despised as &#145;the Vulgar and Illiterate&#146;, hopelessly unfit to understand &#145;the Sydereal Mysteries&#146;  (Worsdale, dedication). He constantly plundered his casebooks for his favourite proof of astrology as such, and of the particular techniques he used. This involved the &#145;apheta&#146; or &#145;hyleg&#146;&#151;namely a precise prediction of someone's death, followed by its remorseless and usually violent fulfilment. Since the occurrence and timing of death is factually indisputable, this was a customary astrological course of action though Worsdale seems to have taken it to unusual lengths.<br>
<br>The plebeians on whom Worsdale looked down took an appropriate (if unintended) posthumous revenge. As &#145;the Lincolnshire wiseman or astronomer&#146;  (Penny, 8&#150;9), his name lived on into the early twentieth century in popular folklore. Accompanied by a familiar spirit such as a blackbird or black cat, his uncanny prescience was plainly intimated to be magical, if not diabolical.<br>
<br>In politics, Worsdale was a whig; he predicted, from the map of its founding, that America would &#145;establish FREEDOM and LIBERTY in every part of the habitable Globe&#146;  (<span class="italic">Astronomy and Elementary Philosophy</span>, 47). In religion, although he lashed &#145;Infidels, Deists, and Atheists&#146; as well as &#145;deceitful Popish priests&#146;  (ibid., 39), God seems to have been reserved for First Cause, while occasionally authorizing comets as &#145;awful warnings&#146; of &#145;DIVINE VENGEANCE&#146;  (ibid., 50, 53). However, his main interest is as the last representative of any national prominence of a particular astrological tradition in Britain, embodying a defiantly &eacute;litist and pre-modern Aristotelian rationalism and naturalism. His last recorded work, the foreword to his <span class="italic">Celestial Philosophy</span>, is dated 11 October 1828; it is not known when he died.<br>
