<span class="headword">Higden,  William</span>  (1662/3&#150;1715), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was perhaps the son of Lawrence Higden of Corfe Castle, Dorset, clergyman. Though Higden had previously matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, on 23 February 1681, aged eighteen, on 5 April 1682 he matriculated sizar at King's College, Cambridge, and it was at Cambridge that he graduated BA in 1684 and proceeded MA in 1688. He became curate of Camberwell, Surrey, where in 1688 he preached the funeral sermon for the wife of the rector, Richard Parr. Higden contributed to a translation of Tacitus's life of Agricola which was published in 1698.<br>
<br>At the revolution of 1688 Higden became a nonjuror, but later took the oaths of allegiance to Queen Anne about 1708, and in 1709 published a defence of his actions in <span class="italic">A View of the English Constitution</span>, which went through several editions. In it he offered a variety of precedents from common and statute law which he felt justified giving allegiance to the king <i>de facto</i>. Like many jurors Higden tried to differentiate his arguments from those used to support the Rump Parliament, but particularly in the later parts of the <span class="italic">View</span> he did lapse into discussing allegiance purely in terms of the relationship between protection and obedience, a very common argument in the engagement controversy of the 1650s. His work attracted a number of replies from leading nonjurors, including Charles Leslie, George Harbin, Theophilus Downes, and Henry Gandy, partly, it seems, in response to the contemporary opinion that Higden's work was unanswerable.<br>
<br>Thomas Hearne claimed that Higden was created DD in 1710 in return for his efforts. Certainly publishing the <span class="italic">View</span> seems to have done his career no harm. He preached at court on the anniversary of Charles I's death in 1711, and in the same year became rector of St Paul's, Shadwell. In May 1713 he was made a prebendary of Canterbury Cathedral. However, some time before taking the oaths Higden had been in lengthy correspondence in the summer of 1707 with Samuel Hawes (a future nonjuring bishop) about ending the nonjuring schism, so his decision cannot be seen as mere opportunism. The debate between them focused on two particular issues in the relationship between nonjurors and the established (and to them schismatic) church of the settlement of 1689. The first was the problem raised by the apparent inconsistency in the nonjuring position over accepting into occasional communion with them conformists (significantly, Higden had written on this theme in <span class="italic">The Case of the Admission of Occasional Conformists to the Holy Communion</span> in 1705, republished in 1715 with a title adapted to make dissenters the explicit target of the work). The second was whether nonjurors should end their breach when the last bishop lawfully ordained before the revolution died or (as George Hooper had done in 1703) conformed. Did the demands of the Christian communion override formal questions raised by the revolution of 1688&#150;9 about the relationship between church and state? Higden felt that it did, citing that &#145;our Blessed Saviour &amp; his Apostles held communion with the High Priests who were advanced by the Civil Power&#146;  (MS Rawl. D844, fol. 47<i>r</i>). It seems best to take Higden at his word in his preface to the <span class="italic">View</span>, where he put his change of heart down to his worrying away at doubts which had arisen in his mind about his original decision. Parts of the book, he explained, were reworked from letters he had written in answer to objections raised by friends to his new position.<br>
<br>Higden died in London on 28 August 1715 and was buried on 5 September in the Broadway Chapel, St Margaret's, Westminster. Although his <span class="italic">View</span> was roundly attacked in his lifetime, it seems to have had a lasting legacy. John Wesley referred to the work as &#145;one of the best-wrote books I have ever seen in the English tongue&#146;  (Hynson, 69), and it has been suggested that Higden's writing was fundamental to shaping the Methodist leader's political outlook.<br>
