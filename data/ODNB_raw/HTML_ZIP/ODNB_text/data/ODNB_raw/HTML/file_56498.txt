<span class="headword">Woodburn,  Arthur</span>  (1890&#150;1978), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 25 October 1890 in Edinburgh, the youngest among the eight children of Matthew Woodburn (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1899), a brassfounder, and his wife, Janet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brown. He was given an education typical of the Edinburgh &#145;labour aristocracy&#146; at Bruntsfield and Boroughmuir schools. While still at school he took a number of jobs, including work in his father's small foundry. He left Boroughmuir at fourteen and worked for a short time in the offices of the Free Church, though his own affiliation was to the United Free Church. He gained experience as a publicist while working on matters arising from the complex lawsuit between the two churches over the title to church properties. He later moved to the offices of Miller's London Road foundry in Edinburgh, and spent over twenty-five years of his career in engineering and foundry administration, specializing in costing and foreign contracts, in which he was aided by a good knowledge of German, French, Italian, and Spanish. Woodburn developed his language skills at evening classes at Heriot-Watt College, which he attended for twelve years after leaving school. He also studied commerce and accountancy, and later attended classes in economics at the extra-mural department of Edinburgh University, under the tuition of William Graham, president of the Board of Trade in the Labour government from 1929 to 1931.<br>
<br>Parallel to this Woodburn developed as a classic &#145;ethical socialist&#146; member of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), which he joined in 1916. Like many members of the ILP he took a very critical pacifist stand towards the First World War, though in the early days of the conflict he was willing, and even eager, to fight. Kidney trouble and the need to support his mother kept him from enlisting, and by 1916 he opposed the war and had joined the No-Conscription Union. He declared his intention not to fight, even though he was occupationally exempt, and when he addressed public meetings against conscription he was arrested, court-martialled, and imprisoned, at one stage being incarcerated in the Tower of London. Long periods were spent in solitary confinement. After his release in summer 1919 he returned to work at the London Road foundry, where his employers had been broadly supportive of his opposition to the war. In that year he married Barbara Halliday, a teacher, the daughter of Francis Halliday, a rubber worker. A Labour Party activist herself, she was one of the first women members of Edinburgh town council, on which she served for many years, and was the city Labour Party's educational expert. There were no children from the marriage.<br>
<br>After the war Woodburn became associated with the labour college movement, although not with the communist and Scottish nationalist variant on it that was associated with John Maclean. He lectured on history, economics, and finance for the Edinburgh branch of the Scottish Labour College, of which he became honorary secretary in 1925. In 1937 he became president of the National Council of Labour Colleges. Like many other Scottish socialists and nationalists he was intrigued by Major C. H. Douglas's social-credit theories, and a mixture of these and &#145;counter-cyclical&#146; public investment, along Keynesian lines, featured in his evidence to the Macmillan committee on banking in 1930. He wrote widely on financial matters, and his <span class="italic">An Outline of Finance</span> (1931) went to four editions. He favoured state planning and regulation, and a visit to Stalin's Russia in 1932 convinced him that this was the &#145;land of hope&#146;  (Knox, 286). He was even willing to dismiss as propaganda the reports of the Moscow show trials, although his belief in the Soviet Union, as well as in state planning itself, began to fade after the Second World War.<br>
<br>In 1929 Woodburn contested South Edinburgh at the general election, and in 1931 Leith, both without success. In 1932, not long after his return from Russia, he was appointed full-time secretary to the Scottish council of the Labour Party. This was an exceptionally difficult position, as the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle of 1931 meant that Labour held only seven Scottish seats. The disaffiliation of the ILP during Woodburn's first year in office removed four of these members, as well as much of the individual membership and the property of the party, and he had more or less to set up a new organization from scratch. His task was complicated by the dominance of the Unionist right, which returned forty-five members out of seventy-four on 42 per cent of the vote in 1935, ably and not unprogressively led by the likes of Walter Elliot and Robert Boothby, and overwhelmingly supported by the Scottish press.<br>
<br>In 1934 Woodburn was a candidate for the general secretaryship of the Labour Party but was narrowly beaten (thirteen votes to eleven) by James Middleton. Woodburn persisted with expanding the Scottish council's membership and control, for which he had the precedent of his friend William Elger's modernization of the Scottish Trades Union Congress after 1924. Hostile to the popular front touted by the communists and to the indiscipline of former ILP &#145;loyalists&#146; in the Scottish Socialist Party, which stood in relation to the Labour Party as the ILP had done prior to disaffiliation, he became a relentless disciplinarian. In 1939, dogged by a lawsuit oddly similar to the Free Church case, the Scottish Socialist Party went under, leaving the Scottish council with a tolerable organization and growing membership. At a by-election in October 1939 Woodburn was elected member for East Stirling and Clackmannanshire, against opposition from Transport House; he won by nearly 15,000 votes in a straight fight against a pacifist candidate, and represented the seat until he retired in 1970.<br>
<br>Woodburn had abandoned his pacifism, and during the war years served as parliamentary private secretary to Tom Johnston, secretary of state for Scotland from 1941 to 1945. As one of the Labour Party's finance spokesmen he sat on the select committee on national expenditure (1939) and chaired the subcommittee on finance and establishments from 1939 to 1945. He reached the Labour front bench in 1943, and between 1945 and 1947 in the Attlee government was joint parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Supply and Aircraft Production (Ministry of Supply from 1946). On 7 October 1947 he succeeded Joseph Westwood as secretary of state for Scotland, with a seat in cabinet. Westwood had been reckoned a weak minister who suffered from Whitehall's desire to recover powers that had leaked to Scotland during the powerful wartime administration of Tom Johnston. Woodburn was less dismissive of his predecessor, but his passage was little easier.<br>
<br>Woodburn's main administrative concerns were the integration of Labour's nationalization and welfare legislation into the Scottish administrative structure; securing action on highland problems; and boosting a flagging housing programme, which was partly overcome by the industrialized production of pre-fabricated houses (&#145;pre-fabs&#146;) at former aircraft factories. But a persistent political problem turned out to be the revival of Scottish nationalism. This stemmed from a split in the Scottish National Party in 1942, involving the secession of the followers of John MacCormick, party secretary. MacCormick's covenant movement got as many as 2 million signatures for a home-rule declaration, and demanded dominion status for Scotland. In part this was a regrouping of Scottish Liberals, once the country's major party and in the doldrums since the early 1920s. But it also drew on concern with over-centralization which the Conservatives themselves helped to fan, and Churchill mischievously denied that Scotland should be forced into the serfdom of socialism as the result of a vote in Westminster.<br>
<br>In his first electoral contest in 1929 Woodburn had favoured home rule but he was now bitterly hostile, a view shared by most members of his party. A white paper of January 1948 proposed minor measures of administrative devolution, plus a Scottish economic council which was supposed to act as a quasi-representative forum. It was dismissed by most of Scottish public opinion. Woodburn did nothing to calm matters by seizing on a rhetorical flourish of MacCormick's to accuse him of advocating violence. MacCormick was an eloquent speaker given to dramatic gestures, the most effective of which was the theft of the Stone of Scone from Westminster Abbey on Christmas day 1950, but his commitment to non-violence was unyielding. In the reshuffle after the general election of 1950 Attlee offered Woodburn a sideways move to the Ministry of Fuel and Power. Woodburn viewed this as a criticism of his Scottish policy, and quit the cabinet in February 1950, being succeeded by Hector McNeil, member for Greenock and previously a high-flier at the Foreign Office. McNeil was equally hostile to devolution, but not as thin-skinned about it, and had killed off the Scottish economic council before Labour lost power.<br>
<br>Woodburn remained on the back benches for a further twenty years. &#145;Solid, slow and deliberate in speech, yet not without a definite personal charm&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 June 1978), not to speak of a rare command of languages and unmistakable eyebrows, he settled down as a model House of Commons man and was on the select committee on procedure from 1956 to 1968. He was active in the British Inter-Parliamentary Union, visiting numerous countries in Europe and South America, and led the first Westminster delegation to the <i>Bundestag</i>. Unusually among Scottish Labour members Woodburn was always an enthusiast for the Common Market. After retirement he continued his international involvement and was elected in 1971 joint president of the British section of the Council of European Municipalities. He was a motorist into extreme old age, and his death in Edinburgh on 1 June 1978 was hastened by an accident while driving to visit his dying wife in hospital.<br>
