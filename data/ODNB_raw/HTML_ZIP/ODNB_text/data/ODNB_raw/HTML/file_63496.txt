<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Indian visitors</span>  (<em>act. </em><em>c.</em>1720&#150;<em>c.</em>1810) <span class="occ"></span>came from many social classes and backgrounds. They rose in number from a few in the seventeenth century to over a thousand annually by the first decade of the nineteenth century. Indian seamen and male and female servants proved most numerous among them. Indian businessmen, diplomats, and travellers often appeared more individually prominent in British society. In addition, the Indian wives, mistresses, and children of Europeans occasionally visited Britain. Further, some Indians, for example <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53351/', "Sake Deen Mahomed (1759&#150;1851)")</script>, remained in Britain as immigrants. <br>
<br>Some &eacute;lite Indian visitors wrote books describing their explorations in Britain for the edification of Indian readers, thus shaping Indian perceptions of Britain; others wrote for British audiences, thus influencing how Britons viewed Asia and Asians. Male &eacute;lite Indian visitors repeatedly commented about their relatively free social intercourse with British women of their own social class, a level of association convention in India would not have permitted between their own womenfolk and European male visitors. They also uniformly remarked on how parochial the British public proved to be, as illustrated by the large number of mystified but well-disposed Britons who gathered round them whenever they appeared in public wearing their Indian clothing. During the eighteenth century none of these Indian accounts mentions any racial hostility against them, rather only the celebrity status they enjoyed. The far more numerous lower-class Indian visitors rarely described their own experiences. Nevertheless, British judicial documents, newspaper reports, and manuscripts and books record their presence. Many occasionally encountered less hospitable and more prejudicial attitudes from Britons than did &eacute;lite Indian visitors. <br>
<br>Over the eighteenth century growing seaborne trade between India and Europe created demand for Indian sailors. Ships leaving India faced shortages of European seamen due to European wars, high levels of shipboard deaths from disease or injury, and desertions by Europeans on arrival in India. In their places Indian sailors (<i>lascars</i>) consequently shipped in growing numbers for Britain, especially London, despite the <span class="roman">Navigation Acts</span> and other parliamentary legislation seeking to minimize or prohibit their employment on British ships. These Indian sailors were often recruited by Indian labour contractors (<i>ghat sarangs</i>) and commanded by Indian petty officers (<i>sarangs</i> and <i>tindals</i>). In Britain the East India Company and British government attempted to isolate these Indian sailors and return them quickly to India. Nevertheless, countless Indian sailors, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67337/', "Emin Joseph Emin (1726&#150;1809)")</script>, evaded these attempts and remained as visitors in Britain for considerable periods. Many such Indian visitors found temporary work in England, especially as dock workers, chimney sweeps, crossing sweepers, street entertainers, and itinerant vendors. Some ran lodging houses for other Indian visitors. Marriage between male Indian visitors and British women of their class appears to have been fairly common, with their children staying on even when their fathers returned to India. <br>
<br>Higher-class Europeans and Indians travelling from India to Britain often brought Indian servants with them. Some of these servants appear in British paintings and, dressed in &#145;oriental&#146; livery, added exotic dignity to &eacute;lite British households. Numerous Indian servants advertised in British newspapers for employment. Most eventually left Britain, often working for Britons on the voyage to India. Included among Indian servants were domestic slaves, such as <a name="cosubject_68679"></a><span class="headword">Nabob</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1780)<span class="occ"></span>, imported in 1780 by the lawyer William Hickey (1749&#150;1830). Some Asian slaves, like Nabob, converted to Christianity, which granted them manumission according to popular belief (although not yet British law); Nabob did not remain free after his return to India. <br>
<br>Middle-class Indians also visited England. <a name="cosubject_63497"></a><span class="headword">Munshi Isma'il</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1771&#150;1773) came as <span class="occ">Indian secretary and Persian language teacher</span> to an East India Company official, Claud Russell (<i>b</i>. 1732). Although employed by Russell, Isma'il brought along two Indian servants of his own. Isma'il later wrote <span class="italic">Tarikh-i jadid</span> (&#145;New history&#146;) in Persian. He was particularly impressed with the hot springs of Bath and with Britain's extensive newspaper industry and numerous coffee houses. <br>
<br>Many Indian businessmen believed that direct personal appeals to the East India Company's court of directors or the British government could override adverse actions or policies by company officials in India. <a name="cosubject_68680"></a><span class="headword">Naorozji Rastamji</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1724&#150;1725)<span class="occ"></span>, son of a Parsi broker to the company, ventured to London in April 1724, pursuing his family's commercial dispute with the company's Bombay government. During his year-long stay in England he won in arbitration, receiving over &pound;50,000 in compensation and a dress of honour from the company's directors. Similarly, <a name="cosubject_68681"></a><span class="headword">Gregore Cojamaul</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1768&#150;1770)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_68778"></a><span class="headword">Johanes Padre Rafael</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1768&#150;1770)<span class="occ"></span>, Armenian Christians long domiciled in India, arrived in London in 1769 with a petition for the company's directors against its officials in India. When this petition failed, they turned to the House of Commons, testifying before its select committee on Indian affairs about abuses by company officials against Indians. <br>
<br>Several Indian diplomatic missions visited England. <a name="cosubject_60953"></a><span class="headword">Mirza I'tizam al-Din</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1765&#150;1785)<span class="occ"></span> left India in January 1766 as part of a diplomatic mission from the Mughal emperor Shah Alam, seeking British government support against the company. Robert Clive, however, blocked the emperor's letter and &pound;10,000 gift for King George III, frustrating I'tizam al-Din, who returned to India late in 1768. In 1785 I'tizam al-Din completed a Persian-language account of his visit to France, England, and Scotland: <span class="italic">Shigurf-nama-i Vilayat</span> (&#145;Wonder book of Europe&#146;). While he appreciated the cordial reception he received from the British, he noted their inability to read cultured literature in Persian or to appreciate the advantages of Islam over Christianity. <a name="cosubject_68682"></a><span class="headword">Hanumant Rao</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1781&#150;1782)<span class="occ"></span>, a Brahman, and his assistant <a name="cosubject_68683"></a><span class="headword">Maniar</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1781&#150;1782)<span class="occ"></span>, a Parsi, visited England in 1781&#150;2 as emissaries to the English court, representing the Maratha peshwa Raghunath Rao (<i>d</i>. 1783). Edmund Burke arranged for this Brahman diplomat to live for a time in his greenhouse at Beaconsfield; living in a separate building, he could prepare his food and dine in isolation without being polluted by Europeans. <br>
<br>Among Indian travellers <a name="cosubject_63496"></a><span class="headword">Mirza Abu Talib Khan Isfahani</span>  (1752&#150;1806)<span class="occ"></span> visited Ireland in 1799, England in 1800&#150;3, and the continent. British high society received him under his self-styled title &#145;the Persian prince&#146;. He later wrote in Persian both a prose account of his travels (and critical opinions of British society), <span class="italic">Masir-i Talibi fi bilad-i Afranji</span> (&#145;Talib's travels in the lands of the Europeans&#146;, completed by 1805), and also a <i>mathnavi</i> (poem in rhyming couplets) of 1000 verses about his visit. He particularly noted the loose habits of European women, compared to &eacute;lite Muslim Indians. To prove his point he wrote an essay, &#145;Vindication of the liberties of the Asiatic women&#146;, which demonstrated how the cold climate, monogamy, provincialism, and commercial activities of England forced Englishwomen into close quarters with their husbands and also into the degrading public sphere of business. In contrast, Abu Talib asserted that, owing to the more cosmopolitan and diverse society of India, Muslim women there enjoyed life in a separate, autonomous, luxurious, and congenial women's sphere, protected by purdah. <br>
<br>Additionally, many Indian wives or mistresses of European men of various classes, from private soldiers to aristocrats, visited Britain, some remaining as immigrants. For example <a name="cosubject_68684"></a><span class="headword">Halime Banu</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Nur Begam]</span>  (1770&#150;1853)<span class="occ"></span>, mistress or wife (by Islamic rite) of Beno&icirc;t de Boigne (1751&#150;1830), visited England in 1797 with him and their two children, Ali Bakhsh (otherwise Charles Alexander (1792&#150;1853)) and Banu, or Anna (1789&#150;1804). <br>
<br>A significant proportion of these visiting sailors, servants, wives, mistresses, and children were born in India of European, especially Portuguese, ancestry or were of mixed Indian and European descent. The East India Company classed such people as &#145;natives of India&#146;, although it officially distinguished those of them having patrilineal European ancestry as legally distinct from &#145;non-European natives of India&#146;.<br>
