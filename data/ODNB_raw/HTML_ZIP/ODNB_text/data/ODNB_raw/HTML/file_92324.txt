<span class="headword">Harrower,  John</span>  (1733&#150;1777?), <span class="occ">indentured servant and journal writer</span>, was probably born in Scotland, though further details of his parentage and upbringing are unknown. Some time after 1750 he moved to Twageos, a small community contiguous to Lerwick in the Shetland Islands. There Harrower worked as a shopkeeper and merchant. On 17 March 1755 he married Ann Graeme (<i>d</i>. in or after 1780), the half-sister of Captain James Craigie, a prosperous merchant in the town. Their first son, Jock, was born in November 1762; they had at least two other children, George and Bess. On 6 December 1773 Harrower, aged forty, left his family and boarded a ship for Leith in &#145;order to travel in search of business&#146;. In his own words he was then &#145;Master of no more Cash but 8&frac12;d and stockins &amp;ca. to the amount of &pound;3 Str. or thereabout, a small value indeed to traviel with&#146;  (Harrower, 3).<br>
<br>The economic hardship suffered by Harrower and his family was typical of many Scots who faced extreme poverty during the 1770s, in large part due to excessive crown rents levied on tenant farmers, shopkeepers, and merchants. Following the financial crisis of 1772 as many as 40,000 Scots left their homes in search of work in southern Scotland and England, or as indenture servants in the American colonies. The great majority of colonial indentured labourers remain anonymous, aside from a name on a ship's register or in records of persons indentured. What makes Harrower's experience remarkable is the journal he kept for three and a half years from December 1773, which provides a detailed picture of one man's experience of the process of indenture and life in service.<br>
<br>Harrower had initially expected to find employment in a Scottish or English port. In this he was unsuccessful, as was his attempt to secure a passage to the Netherlands, having landed at Portsmouth. He therefore walked 80 miles from Portsmouth to London, during which time he lived on money made from selling the stockings he had brought from Shetland. He arrived in the capital on 18 January where he described himself as being &#145;like a blind man without a guide, not knowing where to go being friendless&#146;  (Harrower, 14). In London Harrower appealed to merchants and shipmasters in the hope of finding work, but without success. He also saw &#145;Hundreds &hellip; sterving for want of employment, and many good people &hellip; begging&#146;. After almost two months, and &#145;reduced to the last shilling&#146;, Harrower &#145;was oblidged to engage to go to Virginia&#146; to serve four years as a schoolmaster in exchange for room, board, washing, and payment of &pound;5. On 6 February 1774 he sailed on the <i>Planter</i> with seventy servants who were similarly &#145;indentured to serve four years&#146;  (ibid., 17, 19). A difficult passage lasted sixteen weeks during which Harrower recorded periods of acute seasickness (&#145;There was some sleeping, some spewing, some pishing, some shiting &hellip; some Blasting their leggs and thighs, some their Liver, lungs, lights and eyes&#146;; ibid., 24&#150;5) and noted on 31 March that fifty passengers had fallen ill, mostly with fever. He too succumbed, but recovered after a few days.<br>
<br>The <i>Planter</i> docked at Fredericksburg, Virginia, on 10 May 1774. On the recommendation of the ship's captain, Harrower was singled out by the merchant responsible for selling the servants' indentures. He remained in Fredericksburg and was introduced to a local planter, Colonel William Daingerfield, who visited the town for the fair day in search of a tutor for his children. The meeting went well and on 23 May &#145;my Indenture &hellip; was then delivered him and he was to send for me the next day&#146;  (Harrower, 40).<br>
<br>From May 1774 Harrower lived at Daingerfield's 1300 acre plantation, Belvidera, about 7 miles south of Fredericksburg, on a high bluff overlooking the Rappahannock River. Like many planters in late eighteenth-century Chesapeake, Daingerfield grew a mixed crop of wheat and maize to solve the problems of soil depletion caused by tobacco cultivation. Belvidera clearly fascinated Harrower and provided him with much material for his journal and for the letters he wrote to his wife and brother-in-law in Shetland. His life on the plantation differed significantly from the experiences of most indentured servants and he appears to have been more a member of the family than a contract labourer. His primary responsibility was to teach Daingerfield's three sons to &#145;read write and figure&#146;  (Harrower, 42). Like many private tutors he was able to take on additional students for &#145;five shillings currency per Quarter&#146; and was permitted to keep this money. With nothing on which to spend his income, Harrower promised his wife on 14 June 1774 that &#145;every Shillg. &hellip; shall be carefully remitted you&#146;  (ibid., 56).<br>
<br>Though clearly missing his wife and family, Harrower also noted his good fortune in Virginia. At Belvidera he ate at his master's table, was included when visitors were present, often attended church with the family, and claimed that he had never &#145;lived a genteel regulare life until now&#146;. His only difficulty was an obligation to &#145;talk english the best I can, for Lady Daingerfield speacks nothing but high english&#146;  (Harrower, 54), which required Harrower to lose his Scottish brogue. In addition to information on agricultural practice, and the economic hardships of plantation life, Harrower's correspondence provides a personal perspective on the worsening international situation. A letter of June 1774, for example, informed his wife of the absence of tea from his diet, there being<blockquote>none drunk by any in this Government &hellip; which is owing to the difference at present betwixt the Parliment of great Brittan and the North Americans &hellip; and I'm afraid if the Parliment do not give it over it will cause a total revolt as all the North Americans are determined to stand by one another. (ibid., 56)</blockquote>In the last extant letter to his wife (15 September 1775) Harrower repeated his wish that she and his children join him in Virginia, though he predicted that this would be delayed by &#145;the National disputes &amp; the stopage of trade betwixt this and the Mother Country&#146;  (ibid., 116).<br>
<br>Harrower's final journal entry on 28 July 1776 provided no indication that anything in his life was amiss. However, within months he had died of unknown causes. The little that can be gathered comes from a letter written by his wife to Colonel Daingerfield, sent on 24 May 1780, in which she acknowledged Daingerfield's correspondence of 14 April 1777 with news of her husband's death, the cause being a disease of &#145;that kind [which] baffles all the power of medicine&#146;  (Harrower, 164). Ann Harrower also acknowledged Daingerfield's earlier promise of &pound;70 and commented that her husband had considered himself well treated at Belvidera. During the nineteenth century Harrower's manuscript journal remained in private hands, in which period some pages were lost, before it was given to the Virginia Historical Society about 1900 and published in 1963. His story illustrates how, for an educated and well-placed indentured servant, late eighteenth-century America offered considerable promise. However, Harrower's premature death closed all possibility that his family might begin a new life in the colonies.<br>
