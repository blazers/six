<span class="headword">Thorpe,  John</span>  (1564/5&#150;1655), <span class="occ">surveyor and architect</span>, was born into a family of masons in the quarrying village of Kingscliffe, Northamptonshire. He was the second son of Thomas Thorpe (<i>d</i>. 1596), who worked as master mason on the building of Kirby Hall, Northamptonshire, for Sir Humphrey Stafford, where the infant John symbolically laid the first stone in 1570. His grandfather, also Thomas, was a mason and his younger brother, another Thomas, had a successful career as a mason and a stone supplier on various royal works from 1603 onwards and as one of the principal contractors for Blickling Hall, Norfolk, between 1619 and 1624. The family was armigerous and descended from the Thorpes of Ashwellthorp, near Wymondham, Norfolk.<br>
<br>John Thorpe does not appear to have been trained in the family craft and he first entered the building world at about eighteen years of age in an administrative capacity. From 1583 to 1601 he worked as a clerk in the office of works at Richmond, Greenwich, Whitehall, and various other royal houses. During this lengthy period of public service he exhibited a notable talent as a draughtsman and developed a circle of useful connections both with patrons and with influential officers of the works, many of whom lived in an area around St Martin-in-the-Fields, where Thorpe had a house in Little Church Lane next to Thomas Fowler, the comptroller of the works. On 15 September 1592 he married Rebecca Greene (<i>b</i>. 1575), the daughter of a woodmonger originally from Brampton in Huntingdonshire, some 20 miles from Kingscliffe; this union produced a family of five sons and seven daughters. Thorpe played an active role in parish affairs, serving as a vestryman for more than thirty-five years and providing his professional expertise whenever it was required. In common with other members of the central works team he was able to carry out private commissions in addition to his official employment. Thus in 1600 his unsuccessful suit for the reversion of one of the senior posts in the organization was supported by Sir Henry Neville, ambassador in Paris, for whom he had prepared plans for extending his country seat at Billingbear in Berkshire. In the following year, possibly as a result of this setback to his ambitions, he left the office of works and set up on his own in the emerging profession of surveyor, offering a service that covered both land and buildings.<br>
<br>It was an opportune moment and Thorpe rapidly built up a successful practice in response to the increasing demand for accurate estate surveys stimulated by the land transactions of the new king and his court. He took a major share of this new business and his commissions included Holdenby, Hatfield, and Theobalds for the crown, as well as many surveys for the duchy of Cornwall, the prince of Wales, and other private clients. As a land surveyor he must be counted among the two or three most eminent practitioners of the period. It brought him sufficient income to invest in land and property and in 1611 he was awarded an annuity of &pound;20 for life when he re-entered government service as one of the two assistants to Robert Treswell, the surveyor-general of woods south of Trent.<br>
<br>The surveying side of his practice must have kept Thorpe exceedingly busy around the Jacobean court, but at the same time he was forging a reputation as a designer of buildings, the enigmatic legacy of which is contained in his manuscript volume of house plans and elevations, rediscovered by Horace Walpole in 1780 and now preserved in Sir John Soane's Museum. It contains a collection of more than 150 plans, mainly of country houses but also including some architectural details and exercises in perspective. Sir John Summerson's careful analysis, published for the Walpole Society in 1966, has demonstrated that the genesis of the collection was a group of thirteen plans inherited from Thorpe's father at his death in 1596. The rest of the book is made up of surveys of existing houses, copies of designs made by others, and projects for new houses, not all of which were executed. Together with the roughly contemporary collection of drawings made by the Smythson family, it is a key text for an understanding of the processes of design, the circles of patronage, and the architectural influences which shaped the distinctive domestic architecture of the late Elizabethan and Jacobean &eacute;lite.<br>
<br>The collection continues to present problems in distinguishing those plans which are original designs by Thorpe himself from the many commissioned surveys of extant buildings which he also carried out but for which he had no design responsibility. Late twentieth-century research extended the attributions made by Summerson to include Thornton College, Lincolnshire (<i>c</i>.1607&#150;1610), for Sir Vincent Skinner, possibly Dowsby Hall in the same county (<i>c</i>.1610) for Richard Burrell, the outer court of the earl of Suffolk's magnificent mansion at Audley End, Essex (<i>c</i>.1615), and Aston Hall, Warwickshire (1618&#150;35), for Sir Thomas Holte. It is probable that a number of other buildings could be added to the corpus of his original work if only the documentation could be found. His designs are not as innovative as those by Robert Smythson, but they show a similar delight in the manipulation of geometrical forms and patterns of fenestration and a growing interest in the development of the house plan away from its medieval outline towards the more compact silhouette which was to dominate the remainder of the seventeenth century.<br>
<br>Thorpe was an accomplished linguist and it is clear from his drawings that he was conversant with a number of continental publications, including those of Palladio, Vredeman de Vries, Giacomo Vignola, and Jacques Perret. A particularly powerful influence was the Frenchman Jacques Androuet du Cerceau: Thorpe copied a number of illustrations directly from du Cerceau's <span class="italic">Le premier volume des plus excellents bastiments de France</span> (1576), as well as incorporating elements from the same book in his own designs. The curious design for a house based on his own initials is presented in perspective using a method derived from du Cerceau's <span class="italic">Le&ccedil;ons de perspective positive</span> (1576), and Thorpe's own copy is in the Bodleian Library interleaved with a manuscript translation partly in his own hand. The evidence suggests that he was preparing the book for publication, and had the project gone ahead it would have been the first book in English on the subject of perspective.<br>
<br>The manuscript translation is not dated but it is probable that John Thorpe was the <span class="smallcap">IT</span> who translated Hans Blum's Latin treatise on the orders (1550) on its English publication as <span class="italic">The Booke of Five Collumnes of Architecture</span> in 1601. If this assumption is correct, he enjoyed moderate success as a translator, with a second edition coming out in 1608. Evidence of his knowledge of Latin is provided by the epigram that he contributed to the 1612 edition of Henry Peacham's <span class="italic">The Gentleman's Exercise</span>, where he was described as an &#145;excellent Geometrician and Surveiour &hellip; not onley learned and ingenuous himselfe, but a furtherer and favorer of all excellency whatsoever, of whom our age findeth too few&#146;  (p. 172).<br>
<br>The latest architectural drawings in Thorpe's book date from the 1620s. In 1625&#150;7 he was supervising building works at Belvoir Castle, Leicestershire, for the earl of Rutland, and he seems to have retired shortly afterwards. He continued to live in his London house until about 1651, when he moved to Egham, Surrey, where he owned some land. He died in 1655 at nearly ninety years of age and was buried in the churchyard of St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 14 February of that year. His name is inscribed on the Thorpe family monument which was erected in 1623, long before his death, in the parish church of Kingscliffe. In the absence of his will, Peacham's character study can stand as his obituary. He was one of a group of men who expanded the vocabulary of English architecture in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries and helped to establish the nascent professions of surveyor and architect. In the metropolitan world, where he spent most of his long life, he was a respected professional who helped to disseminate continental learning and a conscientious public servant both to his adopted parish and to the state. His collection of drawings remains as a graphic testimony to his achievements as both a recorder and a creator of some of the most important buildings of the age.<br>
