<span class="headword">Pendlebury,  Henry</span>  (1626&#150;1695), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born at Jowkin, Bury parish, Lancashire, on 6 May 1626. His father, Henry Pendlebury, a member of a family long established in West Houghton, Deane parish, Lancashire, may have been the vicar of Deane recorded as contributing towards a collection for the recovery of the palatinate in 1622, and may be the Henry Pendlebury who was interred in Bury in 1666. The name of his mother is uncertain, but she may be one of two wives of Henry Pendlebury recorded as buried in the parish: an unnamed woman in 1639 or Margaret in 1654. From Bury grammar school the younger Henry passed to Christ's College, Cambridge, where he was admitted sizar on 1 May 1645, graduating BA on 26 April 1648.<br>
<br>Pendlebury returned to Bury and came under the authority of the Bury presbyterian classis. In December 1648 he was preaching at Ashworth chapel, Middleton parish, to the east of Bury, but by 1650 the Commonwealth church survey noted that he was &#145;lately minister at Ashworth, but hath ceased to officiate for want of maintenance&#146;  (Fishwick, <span class="italic">Lancashire and Cheshire Church Surveys</span>, 1.26). For an individual who was to become one of the patriarchs of Lancashire dissent, his path to ordination was not smooth. On 11 July 1650 he appeared before the Bury classis to present his thesis and be examined; it was happy to proceed with his ordination upon the production of his university accreditation, a certificate of his having led an honest life at his last charge, and evidence that he had taken the covenant. He duly produced these at the meeting on 15 August, but by then he had fallen under the censure of the classis: &#145;in this interime Mr. Livesey had consumated a marriage betwixt the said Mr. Pendlebury and one Sarah Smith clandestinely irregularly&#146;  (Shaw, <span class="italic">Minutes of the Bury Presbyterian Classis</span>, 1.115). The irregularity seems to have lain in the lack of consent of either set of parents and that James Livesey was not at that point ordained. The two young men managed to placate the classis: parental consent was obtained and Pendlebury and Livesey were both ordained at Turton chapel, Bolton parish, on 23 October 1650.<br>
<br>If the classis minutes are literally true, then Pendlebury married Sarah Smith (<i>d</i>. 1714) in July or August 1650. But some confusion is caused by the record in Bury parish register of the marriage of a Henry Pendlebury to Sara Woolsenholm on 26 April 1648, who may or may not be the present subject (the marriage took place on the day recorded for his graduation from Cambridge). Possibly Sarah Smith was a second wife, or possibly Woolsenholm was an alias and the classis was misled as to when the marriage had actually taken place.<br>
<br>Pendlebury became minister of Horwich chapel in the parish of Deane. The classis minutes record repeated attempts to get him to proceed with the election of elders and have them approved by the classis. He had apparently not done so by the time he appeared before the classis on 9 February 1652 to explain why he had left the Horwich congregation and moved to Holcombe Chapel in Tottington township in the parish of Bury the preceding October. The remote townships served by Holcombe Chapel were to be made into a new parish in January 1659, but this augmentation was forced into abeyance by the Restoration. Pendlebury was removed from the chapel by sequestration. Though the <span class="roman">Five Mile Act</span> forced him for a while to live in Bolton with the father of the future presbyterian minister William Tong, he spent the rest of his life ministering to nonconformist communities in and around Bury and the Irwell valley. The Restoration and the Clarendon code provided only intermittent interruptions to this ministry. His biographer John Chorlton noted how:<blockquote>Before his exclusion from his Work in public, besides his constant Preaching Lord's-Day at Holcombe among his people, he preached much to other Congregations, both far and near, in the country, which had their monthly exercises; and after he was silenced, he continued as laborious in preaching as before. (Chorlton, xxxix)</blockquote>During the Restoration period the chapelries of Manchester deanery were frequently host to nonconformist ministers, and in March 1670 Pendlebury was reported to the privy council for disturbing the reading of the service at Gorton chapel and proceeding to preach to the congregation. Under the declaration of indulgence he was licensed as a presbyterian preacher (when he is described as of Tottington) and he took out a licence for the court house at Holcombe as a meeting-house. Some time after 1672 a residence was built for him a mile or two away, at Bass House, Walmersley, also in Bury parish. After the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> Bass House was certified as a meeting-house, and at the quarter sessions held at Manchester in July 1691 Edmund Bury registered &#145;Some new building erected situate in Walmsley adjoining to Mr. Pendlebury's house rec. for a meeting pl. for an Assbly of Prot. Diss.&#146;  (Lancs. RO, QDV4) It is clear from Pendlebury's will of 1695, which describes this meeting-house as lately erected, that it was in the courtyard adjoining the house. He preached to the dissenting congregations at Rochdale and Holcombe on alternate Sundays, leaving money in his will to the poor of Rochdale and the poor of his congregation at Walmersley. Tottington, Holcombe, and Walmersley all lay within a few miles of each other on either side of the Irwell: though the exact location of Pendlebury's meetings changed over time, the congregation is likely to have been much the same.<br>
<br>The impression given of Pendlebury's ministry is of immense moral authority. He ventured into print in the controversies over popery in the 1680s (in the only work of his published in his lifetime, <span class="italic">A Plain Representation of Transubstantiation</span> in 1687), yet the sketch left of him by John Chorlton is of a man largely indifferent to politics but alive to the numinous and &#145;the sense of unseen things&#146;  (Chorlton, xliii). &#145;A man of great learning &amp; strict godliness&#146;, as Matthew Henry described him, his other works were published posthumously  (Chetham's Library, Manchester, Raines MSS, 1.291): sermons and other practical works, as well as an attack on the mass first published as late as 1768. Pendlebury was a spiritual father to many in the protestant dissenting ministry and, despite inducements to more lucrative ministries, he remained to minister in the semi-remote moorland townships of his youth. He avoided being dragged into the controversy around the alleged possession of the &#145;Surey Demoniack&#146; Richard Dugdale and lived to participate in the founding of the Lancashire Provincial Assembly. This assembly of presbyterian and Independent ministers was established between 1691 and 1693; Pendlebury attended the general meeting in Manchester on 4 September 1694.<br>
<br>Pendlebury died at Bass House on 18 June 1695 and was buried two days later in Bury churchyard; his funeral sermon was preached at Holcombe Chapel by Robert Seddon. His remains were removed to a common receptacle when the new parish church was built in 1865. His widow, Sarah, died on 6 February 1714 and was also buried in Bury churchyard. Their marriage left no children: William Pendlebury, the protestant dissenting minister of Kendal (1701&#150;6) and Leeds (1706&#150;29), was a kinsman of Henry but not his son. He was the son of James and Ann Pendlebury of Turton, Bolton parish.<br>
