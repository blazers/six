<span class="headword">Hislop,  Joseph Dewar</span>  (1884&#150;1977), <span class="occ">singer and singing teacher</span>, was born at 16 Bowmont Place, Edinburgh, on 5 April 1884, the second child in the family of two sons and two daughters of Joseph Dewar Hislop (1849&#150;1915), painter and decorator, and his wife, Mary White Lunn (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1935). He was educated in the choir school of St Mary's Episcopal Cathedral, Edinburgh. He left school, trained as a photo-process engraver in Edinburgh and London, and then took up the post of demonstrator in a firm at G&ouml;teborg, Sweden, in 1907. In his spare time he sang in a male voice choir, Till S&aring;ng. His potential was recognized in 1910 by a visiting soloist who introduced him to Dr Gillis Bratt in Stockholm. Hislop trained with Bratt. After attending the Royal Opera School and making a test recording for the Gramophone Company at Hayes, Middlesex, in June 1914, he made his d&eacute;but as a principal singer at the Royal Swedish Opera, Stockholm, as Faust in C. F. Gounod's opera on 12 September 1914.<br>
<br>Hislop sang for a season at the San Carlo Opera in Naples, Italy, in the spring of 1920, sharing the role of Mario Cavaradossi with Gigli. He made his Covent Garden d&eacute;but on 14 May 1920 as Rodolfo in Puccini's <span class="italic">La Boh&egrave;me</span>. In 1920 and 1921 he appeared in Chicago and New York, touring America three times. A return to Italy in 1923 saw him in Venice, Turin, and at La Scala, Milan, where his was the first appearance by a British male singer in a leading role (Edgardo in Donizetti's <span class="italic">Lucia di Lammermoor</span>). Hislop sang regularly in most of the major European houses, but also appeared frequently in the Baltic states as well as in the Colon, Buenos Aires (1925). He made a farewell British tour in 1934. He became a Swedish citizen in 1937 in order to take up the offer of teaching posts in the Royal Opera School and the Music High School (later renamed the Royal Academy of Music), Stockholm, where he had great influence on a generation of singers, including Birgit Nilsson and Jussi Bj&ouml;rling, whom he taught (the latter privately). In 1949 he became professor of singing at that academy. From 1948 to 1954 he was an artistic adviser to the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and at Sadler's Wells. In 1952 he became a professor of singing at the Guildhall School of Music. There, he taught a succession of fine singers&#151;Peter Glossop, Elizabeth Fretwell, and William McAlpine as well as (privately) Alberto Remedios and Donald Pilley. He retired to Fife in 1964, where he continued to teach for many years, his most celebrated pupil at this time being the baritone Donald Maxwell.<br>
<br>Hislop was awarded the gold medal Litteris et Artibus in 1922 by Sweden for achievement in the arts. In 1926 he was made a knight of Dannebrog (Denmark) and in 1929 made a knight of the Vasa (Sweden).<br>
<br>On 26 May 1915 he married Karin, daughter of Olof Asklund, owner of a large G&ouml;teborg bakery firm. They had one son and two daughters, one of whom, Geraldine, trained as an actress and singer and appeared with some success before her death in 1984. Divorced in 1940, in the same year Hislop married Agnes (Nancy) Fraser (1911&#150;1987), daughter of Walter Passmore, character comedian in the Savoy Opera Company. There were no children of the second marriage. Hislop died on 6 May 1977 at his home, Berryside, near New Gilston, Fife, and he was cremated at Kirkcaldy crematorium on 10 May.<br>
<br>Hislop had a relatively small repertory of 29 spinto tenor roles, giving some 921 performances in total between 1914 and 1934. He made 180 recordings, 4 for Path&eacute; Fr&egrave;res in Stockholm, the remainder for the Gramophone Company (later EMI).<br>
