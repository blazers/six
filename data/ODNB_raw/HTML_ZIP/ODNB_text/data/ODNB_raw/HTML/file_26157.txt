<span class="headword">Spittlehouse,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1612, <em>d.</em> in or after 1657), <span class="occ">Fifth Monarchist</span>, was the son of John Spittlehouse (<i>d</i>. 1638), of Gainsborough, saddler, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Waterhouse (<i>d</i>. before 1636), and was baptized at Gainsborough on 10 June 1612. He was perhaps educated at the grammar school, possibly by the future Baptist Hanserd Knollys, who taught there in the late 1620s. Spittlehouse fought in the action at Gainsborough in 1643, at his own charges, at Newark in 1644, and thereafter in the parliamentary army until after the battle of Worcester (1651). In 1650 he was assistant to the marshall-general, responsible for military security. In July 1649 he joined other radical officers in Whitehall in a day of solemn humiliation over religious divisions within the army. Spittlehouse and his wife, Mary, were both active members of the London gathered General Baptist congregation led by Peter Chamberlen in the 1650s.<br>
<br>A prolific pamphleteer, Spittlehouse published polemical tracts against Samuel Oates, John Brayne, and John Simpson, but most of his output was inspired by zeal for the approaching millennium. In <span class="italic">Rome Ruined</span> (1650) he justified the regicide, but condemned the failure of parliament and council to promote Christ's reign. He welcomed the overthrow of the Rump Parliament in April 1653 in <span class="italic">The Army Vindicated</span>, calling for Cromwell to rule as a new Moses with an assembly elected exclusively by godly army officers. The work was republished in a Dutch translation. A few weeks later Spittlehouse suggested that Cromwell himself should nominate every member of the new government. He had some hopes of Barebone's Parliament, and published a tract in September anticipating the speedy abolition of tithes. He clashed with the authorities, however, apparently over fen drainage in the Isle of Axholme, and on 5 December the council ordered his arrest over petitions he had presented, including one to parliament attacking John Thurloe. In March 1654 he begged Cromwell for release, and he was freed on 6 April. Despite this appeal Spittlehouse regarded the new protectorate as a gross betrayal, and he predicted that Cromwell would meet the same fate as the king. He responded to Cromwell's denunciation of the Fifth Monarchists to parliament in September 1654 by publishing a staunch defence and condemning Cromwell as a turncoat. This prompted his rearrest in October, though he was never charged. In <span class="italic">The Royall Advocate</span> (1655) Spittlehouse accused the army too of apostasy, called for a radical programme of reforms including the abolition of excise, customs, and tithes and the establishment of the Mosaic law code, and demanded that the army should pay its own way by conquests in Roman Catholic Europe instead of being supported by the taxpayer. He was in custody again in the winter of 1655&#150;6 with John Jones, a Fifth Monarchist conspirator, but was released on 1 February 1656 on entering a bond in &pound;200 to live peaceably.<br>
<br>An inveterate polemicist, Spittlehouse at various times attacked Presbyterians, Independents, seekers, ranters, and Quakers, but he denied that magistrates had any right to meddle in religious affairs and wanted even the <span class="roman">Koran</span> to circulate unhindered. Well read in puritan literature, old and new, he dismissed as worthless both classical languages and universities. His last publication, with William Saller, in spring 1657, championed the seventh-day sabbath. The date of John Spittlehouse's death is unknown; a widow Spittlehouse living in Whitehall, London, in 1659 was almost certainly the relict of a William Spittlehouse, formerly a minor council official and Whitehall doorkeeper.<br>
