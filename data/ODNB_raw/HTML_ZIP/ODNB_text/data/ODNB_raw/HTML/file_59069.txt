<span class="headword">Angus,  Marion Emily</span>  (1865&#150;1946), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 27 March 1865 at 23 Park Place West, Sunderland, the third of six children of the Revd Henry Angus (1833&#150;1902) and Mary Jessie Watson. While her father's family background was mainly clerical, Marion Angus's maternal grandfather was a notable social reformer: William Watson, sheriff-substitute of Aberdeen from 1829 to 1866, who founded in that city in 1841 the first industrial school for street children. The first published work by Marion Angus was an affectionate memoir of her grandfather entitled <span class="italic">Sheriff Watson of Aberdeen: the Story of his Life and his Work for the Young</span> (1913) which, as well as offering a vivid portrait of the humane and energetic sheriff, illuminates many aspects of the social history of his period of office. Henry Angus graduated AM from Marischal College in 1852, attended the United Presbyterian College, Edinburgh, and was ordained in Union Chapel, Sunderland, on 2 March 1859. Minister of Trinity Church, Sunderland, for seventeen years, he accepted a call to Erskine United Free Church, Arbroath, in 1876 and moved back to north-east Scotland with his family. He retired from the ministry in 1900 and died in 1902. His invalid widow moved to Inchgowan, Cults, on the outskirts of Aberdeen, where Marion and her sister Ethel ran a private school. The Cults house was given up at the beginning of the First World War. Ethel joined a Voluntary Aid Detachment and was injured in an air raid on the base hospital at Calais where she was working, while Marion worked in the canteen at Stobbs camp. Her nephew records that &#145;She was much exhausted by this work, with its long hours and hard conditions, but she spoke after it with the greatest respect and admiration for the ordinary private soldiers, and their simple good sense and kindliness&#146;  (W. S. Angus to Nan Shepherd, 7 Nov 1968; in Aberdeen University MS 2737).<br>
<br>Marion and Ethel lived briefly in Peebles after the war, but disliked the town, and Marion moved back to the north-east in 1921, buying Zoar, Springfield Road, Aberdeen. It was in the 1920s that Marion began to publish the poems which established her as one of the group of vernacular poets who were forerunners of the &#145;Scottish Renaissance&#146; of the inter-war years. Her Scots verse, along with that of Violet Jacob and Lewis Spence, marked a break with the exhausted post-Burns tradition, and anticipated the work of C. M. Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid). She did not start to write poetry until after 1918 and her first volume of poems, <span class="italic">The Lilt</span>, was published in 1922, the year Grieve's first experiments in Scots appeared in the <span class="italic">Dunfermline Press</span>. Five more volumes of poetry followed: <span class="italic">The Tinker's Road and other Verses</span> (1924), <span class="italic">Sun and Candlelight</span> (1927), <span class="italic">The Singin' Lass</span> (1929), <span class="italic">The Turn of Day</span> (1931), and <span class="italic">Lost Country and other Verses</span> (1937). The association with Grieve, and the cultural initiatives he promoted so energetically in the 1920s and 1930s, stemmed from Grieve's inclusion of her work in his <span class="italic">Scottish Chapbook</span> and <span class="italic">Northern Numbers</span> and from the qualified approval he accorded her poetry in his polemical articles on contemporary cultural life in the <span class="italic">Scottish Literary Journal</span> in 1925 and 1926. In addition, three of her six volumes of verse&#151;<span class="italic">Sun and Candlelight</span>, <span class="italic">The Singin' Lass</span>, and <span class="italic">The Turn of Day</span>&#151;were published by Porpoise Press, founded by George Malcolm Thomson and Roderick Watson Kerr in 1922, and very much an expression of the new cultural climate in Scotland. She also contributed to the new medium of radio.<br>
<br>Ethel fell seriously ill in the late twenties, and spent the remainder of her life in hospital in Glasgow. Until her sister's death in 1936 Marion lived with relatives or in rooms to be within reach of her. The Aberdeen house was sold, but Marion Angus maintained her connection with her beloved north-east, spending her summers on Deeside. In 1945, too frail to live on her own, she returned to Arbroath to Hayshead House, where an old friend was housekeeper. Marion Angus died there on 18 August 1946; she was cremated at Aberdeen and her ashes scattered on Elliot Links, Arbroath. <span class="italic">Selected Poems</span>, edited by Maurice Lindsay and with a memoir by her friend Helen Cruickshank, appeared in 1950.<br>
<br>Helen Cruickshank notes in her memoir that Marion Angus did not have a high opinion of Grieve as a poet, and that she disapproved of his experiments in &#145;synthetic&#146; Scots. However, like Grieve and the other &#145;Renaissance&#146; poets, she went back beyond Burns and found inspiration in earlier Scottish traditions&#151;most notably in ballad and folk-song. In poems like &#145;The Seaward Toon&#146; and &#145;In the Streets Thereof&#146;, she synthesizes elements of the folk tradition with powerfully suggestive religious images to convey kinds of experience beyond the rational and explicable. Both poems warn against a defensive and prudential attitude that cuts the individual off from the fuller life of the sense and imagination. Marion Angus is a poet of the social and psychological margins: her poems hint and suggest rather than state, often conveying repressed or unreturned feelings and liminal states; her characters are often the outcast and rejected. Women's experience is at the centre of her work, and it offers a welcome contrast to the mainly male-dominated poetry of the &#145;Renaissance&#146; movement. Her chief quality as a poet has been best summed up by Nan Shepherd: &#145;We know that this is our country and these are our people, but we did not know they were quite like this&#146;  (Nan Shepherd, &#145;Marion Angus as poet of Deeside&#146;, <span class="italic">Deeside Field</span>, 2nd ser., 6, 1970, 8&#150;16).<br>
