<span class="headword">Shaw,  John</span>  (1558/9&#150;1625), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious writer</span>, was born in Westmorland and attended school there. He matriculated from Queen's College, Oxford, on 17 November 1581, aged twenty-two, and graduated BA on 29 February 1584. He was instituted vicar of Woking, Surrey, on 11 September 1588. He probably married soon afterwards, but his wife's name is unknown. Their son Tobias was born in 1589 or 1590: he matriculated from Queen's College on 6 July 1604, aged fourteen. Shaw was deprived in 1596 for nonconformity, but appears to have been reinstituted, probably by the time of Tobias's matriculation. His book <span class="italic">The Blessedness of Marie, the Mother of Jesus</span> (1618) contains a preface to Lady Dorothy Zouch, wife of Sir Edward Zouch, at Woking, which celebrates her &#145;coming in among us&#146;, her &#145;hearty love to true religion&#146;, and her &#145;comfort in the ministry and public worship of God established&#146;; a distich in the church, now destroyed, likewise suggests that Shaw had been received back into the ministry. His <span class="italic">Bibliorum summula</span> (1621) was also signed from Woking. According to its translator, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28809/', "Simon Wastell")</script>, who had been at school with Shaw, this work was &#145;much applauded of the godly learned ministers and of many other scholars&#146;  (Wastell, 2nd preface). Among the commendatory verses prefixed to the original book was one by Daniel Featley of Lambeth. Shaw lived at Woking until his death in 1625, and was buried there on 15 September. Tobias, who had graduated BA in 1611 and proceeded MA in 1614, became rector of Blendworth, Hampshire, in 1619.<br>
