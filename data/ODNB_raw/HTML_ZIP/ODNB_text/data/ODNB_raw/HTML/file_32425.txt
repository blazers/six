<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clarke,  Charles Baron</span>  (1832&#150;1906), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born on 17 June 1832 at Andover, Hampshire, the eldest son of Turner Poulter Clarke JP, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of James Parker and Elizabeth Ward. Botany ran in the family: his father's mother, Elizabeth Baron, had botanical interests and her brother, Charles, founded the Agricultural Society of Saffron Walden and was an enthusiastic gardener. Clarke was a pupil at Mr Tomlinson's Preparatory School in Salisbury (1840&#150;46), and at King's College School, London (1846&#150;52). He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1852. At the university he became the close friend of Henry Fawcett, of Leslie Stephen, and of John Rigby. This coterie was noted for their unconventional dress and interest in current politics. After graduating BA in 1856 he was elected fellow of Queens' College in 1857, and from 1858 to 1865 was lecturer in mathematics there. He proceeded MA in 1859 and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1860 but never practised.<br>
<br>Clarke was throughout his life a tireless walker, and spent most of his Easter vacations in the Lake District. On his last visit in 1865 he and Leslie Stephen climbed together the Pillar Rock, Wastdale. In Switzerland, too, he combined alpine climbing with plant collecting. In 1862 he collected plants in Madeira. Meanwhile he actively helped Fawcett in his candidature for parliament, at Cambridge in 1863 and at Brighton in 1864, and aided him in his studies in political economy.<br>
<br>In 1865 Clarke entered the uncovenanted civil service of Bengal and was taken on the establishment of the Bengal educational department. He joined the staff of the presidency college at Calcutta the following year and was subsequently inspector of schools in eastern Bengal, with his headquarters at Dacca. He had already collected plants of his native town, and he published at Calcutta in 1866, in a threepenny pamphlet, <span class="italic">A List of the Flowering Plants &hellip; of Andover</span>. He continued to collect in India and within two and a half years in eastern Bengal he got together 7000 specimens, which were lost in the wreck of a boat in 1868. The Clarke collections, later placed at Kew, date from after May 1868. His knowledge of the Indian country soon equalled that of the best contemporary specialists, and was considered second only to that of William Griffith. To all his specimens he attached full field notes made on the spot. He generally neglected trees, and concentrated his efforts for several years together upon single natural orders, paying particular attention to weeds growing in cultivated fields.<br>
<br>From 1869 to 1871, in the absence of Thomas Anderson (1832&#150;1870), who was invalided home, Clarke acted as superintendent of the Calcutta Botanical Gardens and of cinchona cultivation in Sikkim. Returning to his work as an inspector of schools in 1871, he studied the eastern Sundarbans in 1872, and in the following year he visited Chittagong. Transferred to Calcutta in 1874, he published there his second work, <span class="italic">Commelynaceae et Cyrtandraceae Bengalenses</span>, describing two families of tropical plants, and reprinted Roxburgh's <span class="italic">Flora Indica</span> of 1832 at his own expense, believing it to be more useful to the amateur botanist than J. D. Hooker's multi-volume work. In 1876 he issued a monograph on the Compositae, to which, along with the Gentianaceae, his interest was now directed. In 1875 he was transferred to Darjeeling, and explored the Nepal frontier and British Bhutan. Next year, during a three months' furlough, he visited Kashmir, ascending 17,000 feet in the Karakoram range.<br>
<br>In 1877 Clarke came home on two years' leave and presented his herbarium, some 25,000 specimens, representing 5000 species, to the Kew herbarium. He settled down to voluntary botanical work for Sir Joseph Hooker's <span class="italic">Flora of British India</span>, and was placed on special duty at Kew by the government of India on the expiration of his leave in 1879. Between March 1879 and April 1883 he described more than fifty plant families for the second, third, and fourth volumes of Hooker's work. He was the most prolific of all Hooker's collaborators.<br>
<br>After his return to India in 1883 Clarke was temporarily appointed director of public instruction in Bengal in 1884, and went the next year as inspector to Shillong in Assam, when he studied the flora of the Khasi, Naga, and Manipur hills. He had always taken every opportunity to botanize during his official tours of duty.<br>
<br>Clarke retired from India in June 1887 and moved to Kew, where he lived with his brother, Poulter Clarke. He spent the next nineteen years working as a volunteer in the Kew herbarium. He set out to write a monograph on the Cyperaceae, a plant family covering sedges and reeds which had interested him for more than a decade, but did not live to complete it. However, much of the material that he prepared was published in his lifetime in article form, and more appeared posthumously, in particular his <span class="italic">New Genera and Species of Cyperaceae</span> (1908), which was extracted from his enormous accumulation of notes.<br>
<br>Clarke was a fellow of the Linnean Society, on whose council he served almost continuously for sixteen years from 1880, as president from 1884 to 1896. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1882, serving on the council from 1888 to 1890. In 1897 he joined the Geologists' Association, and took frequent part in its excursions. Towards the end of his life he became an enthusiast for cycling, riding long distances by day only, without lamp, brake, or bell. (Indeed some contemporaries attributed his final illness to excessive cycling.) He never married. His impressive versatility found expression in writings on a wide variety of non-botanical topics, including political economy, anthropology, English history, and musical theory. Moreover, in addition to his work on Indian plants, he also contributed material relating to the flora of South Africa, of tropical Africa, and of the Malayan peninsula. The genus <i>Clarkella</i>, which is found in the Himalayas, was named after Clarke in 1880 by Sir Joseph Hooker. He died at his home, 13 Kew Gardens Road, London, on 25 August 1906, and was buried at Andover on 30 August.<br>
