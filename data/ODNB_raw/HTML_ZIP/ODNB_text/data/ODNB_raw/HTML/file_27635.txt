<span class="headword">Townshend,  Charles</span>, second Viscount Townshend  (1674&#150;1738), <span class="occ">politician, diplomatist, and agricultural innovator</span>, was born on 18 April 1674 at Raynham, Norfolk, and baptized on 2 May at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London. He was the eldest of the three sons and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27628/', "Horatio Townshend, first Viscount Townshend (bap. 1630, d. 1687)")</script>, politician, and his second wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1685), the daughter of Sir Joseph Ashe, of Twickenham, Middlesex. His two brothers were Roger (<i>d</i>. 1709), a colonel of a foot regiment and MP for Norfolk and later Great Yarmouth; and Horatio (<i>c</i>.1683&#150;1751), who was MP for Great Yarmouth and later Heytesbury, a director of the South Sea Company, a governor and director of the Bank of England, and a commissioner of the excise. Townshend took his seat in the House of Lords in December 1687 following the death of their father.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandcareer"></a>Early life and career</h2>Townshend was educated at Eton College and matriculated at King's College, Cambridge, at Easter 1691. After travelling abroad for three years from August 1694 to October 1697 he married, on 3 July 1698, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1711), the second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21797/', "Thomas Pelham, first Baron Pelham")</script>. During their thirteen-year marriage they remained devoted to one another and were rarely separated. The couple had nine children; the first, Horatio, was born in August 1699 and was followed by two girls and six boys. Only five of the children, four sons and one daughter, survived to adulthood.<br>
<br>Although his father had been a staunch tory, Townshend favoured the whigs and quickly became active in politics. In 1701 he was appointed high steward of King's Lynn (21 April) and of Norwich Cathedral (21 or 30 April), offices he held until his death. In addition he served as lord lieutenant of Norfolk, a position he held twice (1701&#150;13 and 1714&#150;30), and as <i>custos rotulorum</i>, to which he was appointed on 31 May 1701. These offices and his stature in the community gave Townshend considerable political influence. In May 1701 he also delivered his maiden speech in the House of Lords. Unfortunately he was not a skilled orator. Even one of his friends, the fourth earl of Chesterfield, noted that, although Townshend always &#145;spoke materially, with argument and knowledge &hellip; [he] never pleased &hellip; [because] his diction was not only inelegant, but frequently ungrammatical, always vulgar: his cadences false; his voice unharmonious, and his actions ungraceful&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of &hellip; Chesterfield</span>, 4.1454). He went on to observe that &#145;Nobody heard him with patience&#146; and that some individuals &#145;used to joke upon him and repeat his inaccuracies&#146;  (ibid., 4.1455). In spite of this failing, Townshend played an important political role, in part because of his and Robert Walpole's control of the Norfolk whigs, who usually acted with the junto leadership.<br>
<br>During the early years of Queen Anne's reign Townshend protested against the <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity Bill</span>, defended the rights of the electorate in the Aylesbury election, and helped to defeat the proposal to invite Princess Sophie of Hanover to England. In 1706 he became a member of the Royal Society and was nominated to serve as one of the commissioners to negotiate the treaty of union between England and Scotland. The following year he was appointed captain of the yeomen of the guard (25 November) and was sworn of the privy council (1 December), and in 1708 he was elected to serve on a committee of seven peers investigating charges of treason against William Gregg, Robert Harley's secretary.<h2>
<a name="Diplomaticcareer"></a>Diplomatic career</h2>In 1709 the queen appointed Townshend to his most important diplomatic post, at The Hague, the main artery of British diplomacy. This post was crucial not only because of the importance of maintaining good relations with Britain's closest ally but also because it was the &#145;whispering gallery&#146; of Europe  (Horn, <span class="italic">British Diplomatic Representatives</span>, 19&#150;20), where the most extensive information on European politics was available. At that time the British, embroiled in the War of the Spanish Succession (1702&#150;13), feared that the Dutch might conclude a separate peace with France. Many whigs were delighted with the selection of Townshend. Bishop Burnet for one thought him &#145;a man of great integrity, and of great principles in all respects; free from all vice and of an engaging conversation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 6.18&#150;19).<br>
<br>The impetus for the appointment had come from John Churchill, duke of Marlborough, who had pressed the government to appoint a colleague to aid him in concluding a treaty with the Dutch. The ministry had first chosen Charles Montagu, earl of Halifax. Justifiably suspicious of the duke's motives, Halifax had refused, whereupon the ministry turned to Townshend, one of the prot&eacute;g&eacute;s of John, Lord Somers, who as early as 1707 had been promised the post at The Hague. Negotiations with the Dutch had been ongoing for several years at the time of Townshend's appointment. Plans for a barrier treaty, to construct a string of fortresses in the Southern Netherlands, had been discussed in 1706 but came to nothing. Only when the British learned that France had begun talks with the continental allies did they, fearing that the Dutch might conclude a separate peace, authorize Marlborough to reopen discussions for a barrier. Marlborough, realizing that the other allies, notably Prussia and Austria, would oppose this barrier, and that a barrier treaty was too high a price for the British to pay for Dutch adherence to the war effort, distanced himself at the outset from the negotiations. Such was the situation that Townshend confronted when he arrived at The Hague on 17 May 1709.<br>
<br>Fortunately, many of the Dutch leaders, including Anthonie Heinsius, the grand pensionary, befriended the popular young diplomatist. As ambassador-extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the United Provinces (13 May 1709 to 21 March 1711) Townshend helped to draw up the harsh peace terms that Louis XIV rejected. In 1709 he also concluded a treaty with the Dutch guaranteeing the Hanoverian succession and allocating the Dutch a barrier of fortifications in the Spanish (later the Austrian) Netherlands. His conviction that Dutch security depended on the acquisition of a good barrier and that a more generous treaty would secure Dutch allegiance to Britain and the ongoing war led him to exceed his instructions and make strategic, financial, and commercial concessions not outlined in the British project. Among the proposals offered to the Dutch by Townshend were the cession of Upper Gueldres, territory which the king of Prussia claimed as part of his inheritance from his mother, and the inclusion of other fortresses in the barrier, such as Dendermonde, which were of economic but not strategic importance.<br>
<br>The reaction of Britain's allies was explosive: Frederick I of Prussia was furious because the treaty ignored his claims to Gueldres, and Joseph I of Austria because the treaty implied Dutch military and economic domination of the Netherlands. In Great Britain the treaty provoked an uproar because many believed that it constituted more of a barrier against British trade than a military barrier against France. Merchants objected in particular to the clauses which gave the Dutch an equal share in the concessions of the Spanish empire and greater trade advantages in the Netherlands. The infamous double duty which the British had to pay on goods imported into the Netherlands amounted to a potent trade weapon. A lively pamphlet war soon erupted. On one side Francis Hare, in <span class="italic">The Barrier Treaty Vindicated</span>, attempted to justify the treaty by arguing that it had fulfilled its main purpose, the securing of a sufficient barrier for the Dutch and the safeguarding of the protestant succession. On the other, Jonathan Swift attacked the treaty for ignoring the rights of the allies and for endangering British trade, making Britain &#145;a Province to Holland, and a Jest to the whole world&#146;. Henry St John reflected the tory attitude when he remarked that it was the &#145;last and great sale of British interests&#146;  (Feiling, 404). The conclusion of the treaty, which Marlborough cannily refused to sign, marked a far from edifying chapter in the diplomatic history of the United Provinces. The Dutch, ignoring the larger issue of peace or war, crudely squeezed concessions out of their unwilling ally.<br>
<br>None the less, Townshend's mission marked the high point of Anglo-Dutch relations during the war. Although the Dutch had forced the British to consent to Townshend's treaty, they had in the process tied themselves to Britain and had given up their last chance of a separate peace with France. Townshend's mission and the conclusion of the barrier negotiations exemplify the British policy of &#145;appeasing&#146; the Dutch to prevent their defection to France. However, Dutch gains were largely illusory. With its extensive military and economic advantages, the barrier did not necessarily form a strong defence, since it later alienated both France and the inhabitants of the Southern Netherlands. Equally, it was highly improbable that either the king of Prussia or the Habsburgs would accept a treaty so detrimental to their own interests. Lastly, the extensive commercial concessions which the Dutch obtained would invariably lead to conflict with Great Britain, the treaty's guarantor.<br>
<br>In 1709 Townshend, along with Marlborough, negotiated the peace preliminaries with Anthonie Heinsius and the French representatives, Jean Baptiste Colbert, marquis de Torcy, and Pierre Rouill&eacute; de Marbeuf. The basis of the preliminaries was the cession of the whole Spanish monarchy to the Habsburgs and the acknowledgement of Archduke Charles as king of Spain. Louis XIV was to restore all the towns and forts conquered in the Spanish Netherlands. He was also required not only to withdraw all French troops from Spain but also to help the allies to remove Philip V. If the whole Spanish monarchy were not ceded within two months of the treaty's conclusion, the armistice would expire. It was these demands, presented in the infamous articles 4 and 37, that doomed the talks. Subsequent meetings in Gertruydenberg underscored Louis XIV's refusal to make all the sacrifices without receiving anything more than a promise of peace negotiations in return. Louis continued to maintain that he would rather wage war against his enemies than his children. These negotiations, though ultimately futile, proved that the barrier treaty had indeed secured Dutch allegiance to Britain and the war. In the spring and summer of 1710 the British government, fearing that the Great Northern War might spill over and merge into the War of the Spanish Succession, authorized Townshend to sign the conventions of 31 March and 4 August which guaranteed the peace in the Holy Roman empire, Poland, and the duchies of Schleswig and Jutland.<h2>
<a name="Fallofthewhigsandopposition"></a>Fall of the whigs and opposition</h2>By 1710 Britain, as well as France, was weary of the war. The ministerial revolution which ushered the tories back into power ultimately meant the recall of Townshend on 21 March 1711 and a repudiation of the barrier treaty in 1712. Although the tories at this time paraded their co-operation with the Dutch and simulated a desire to continue the war to ensure stability at home and to obtain the best possible terms from France, St John in particular bombarded Townshend with complaints about the failure of the Dutch to fulfil their treaty obligations. These demands were a hint of Britain's coming withdrawal from the conflict, and marked the beginning of British abandonment and eventual renunciation of their Dutch allies.<br>
<br>Townshend was not only recalled from his post but also dismissed as captain of the yeomen of the guard (13 June 1711). In addition to these political trials he was grief-stricken by the loss, between April and June 1711, of his newborn daughter Elizabeth, his wife&#151;in his &#145;first irreparable misfortune&#146;  (7 July 1711, BL, Stowe MS 224)&#151;and his eldest son, Horatio. On 14 February 1712 he was censured by the tory-dominated House of Commons for exceeding his instructions and condemned as a public enemy. Gilbert Burnet, an admirer of Townshend, in commenting on this incident, sardonically noted that &#145;reason is a feeble thing to bear down resolutions already taken&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 6.123). In 1713 the tories forced the Dutch to renegotiate the treaty and drastically reduced the number of fortresses. Locally Townshend retained his position as lord lieutenant of Norfolk until April 1713, when James Butler, duke of Ormond, replaced him. By that time Townshend had lost his ability to influence local appointments or to protect his appointees.<br>
<br>While in opposition Townshend spent his time harassing the government. In particular he worked with other whigs on the bill which declared enlisting and recruiting individuals for the Pretender to be high treason, and he protested against the now infamous restraining orders (10 May 1712) in which Bolingbroke ordered Ormond not to engage in any further continental military action. These orders meant in effect an abandonment of Britain's allies. In the midst of this political manoeuvring Townshend married, on 6 July 1713, Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1726), known as Dolly, the charming and beautiful sister of his boyhood friend and whig colleague Robert Walpole. The marriage, which produced eleven children, the eldest of them being <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27623/', "George Townshend")</script>, was a happy one for Townshend and helped to cement the friendship of this unlikely political duo. At the same time Townshend strengthened his ties with Hanoverian agents, especially Johann Kaspar von Bothmer, in preparation for the accession of George I. Townshend was able to win over George I because of his reputation for integrity and hard work and his staunch adherence to the cause of the Hanoverian succession. His friendship with influential Dutch officials, such as Heinsius and Slingelandt, also helped him. After the death of Queen Anne in August 1714 George chose Townshend as one of the eighteen regents to prepare for his accession.<h2>
<a name="TheearlyreignofGeorgeI"></a>The early reign of George I</h2>Once in power George I appointed Townshend secretary of state for the northern department, a post he held from 17 September 1714 to 12 December 1716. On 1 October he was again sworn of the privy council and began his second term as lord lieutenant of Norfolk. George's accession also saw Townshend's brother-in-law Robert Walpole appointed first lord of the Treasury and chancellor of the exchequer. Although he advised against the prosecution of Robert Harley (now earl of Oxford) for treason and later favoured pardoning Henry St John (now Viscount Bolingbroke), Townshend generally supported the proceedings against those who concluded the treaties of Utrecht and urged the seizure of the papers of Lord Strafford, one of the British envoys. He energetically helped to suppress the Jacobite rising in 1715, supported the <span class="roman">Septennial Act</span> of May 1716 which extended the legal life of the existing and subsequent parliaments from three to seven years, and tried to restrict British involvement in the naval war between Sweden and Denmark.<br>
<br>In his capacity as secretary of state Townshend promoted defensive alliances with both the Holy Roman emperor and the king of France and, with James Stanhope's assistance, concluded a definitive barrier treaty with the Dutch on 14 November 1715. His delay in signing a treaty with France because of difficulties over the Pretender and over the destruction of the fortifications at Mardyke, a pirate haven, irritated George I, who, deeply involved in the Great Northern War, wanted the French treaty speedily concluded. Townshend's belief that an aggressive policy in northern Europe would be expensive and contrary to Britain's interests caused him to lose influence with both the king and his minions, including Stanhope, who wanted Britain to take an active role in the Baltic. George I also opposed Townshend's plan to re-establish the balance of power between Russia and Sweden.<br>
<br>Although the main cause of Townshend's fall was a difference over foreign policy, personal rivalries also played a role. The fissure present at the outset in the government progressively widened. George's increasing favouritism towards both Stanhope and the earl of Sunderland worsened relations among the whigs. Sunderland, who had been lord lieutenant of Ireland and then lord privy seal, envied Townshend, who, though less experienced, held the more influential office. Sunderland convinced George I and Stanhope that Townshend and Walpole were plotting with the prince of Wales. Townshend's procurement of an Irish rather than a British title for the king's mistress, Melusine von der Schulenberg, angered her and worsened his position.<br>
<br>The rift in the government over foreign policy led Townshend on 26 December 1716 to exchange the office of secretary of state for that of the lucrative but politically powerless office of lord lieutenant of Ireland, to which he was appointed on 24 February 1717, although he never visited the country. While Townshend was reluctant to accept this position, widely regarded as a form of political exile, he did so in order to avoid further splits within whig ranks. However, the attempt to appease Townshend and to prevent additional divisions ultimately failed, as Walpole joined the opposition to Stanhope and Sunderland. Walpole presciently told Stanhope that he was quite mistaken in believing that removing his brother-in-law would &#145;meet with no objection from the Whigs&#146;  (Plumb, 1.237). Walpole, who whatever his faults proved loyal on this occasion, pointed out that &#145;Such sudden changes to old sworn friends are seldom look'd upon in the world with a favourable eye&#146;  (Coxe, <span class="italic">Walpole</span>, 2.143). Townshend himself opposed the king's favoured ministers and continued to criticize the ministry's policies, for example the crucial <span class="roman">Mutiny Bill</span>. This stand led to his dismissal on 20 April 1717. Walpole resigned shortly after, as did William Pulteney, Paul Methuen, and the duke of Devonshire. After Townshend's other supporters, including Sir Charles Turner, were dismissed, the king reconstructed the cabinet under Stanhope's leadership.<br>
<br>Townshend did not, however, remain out of power for long. In concert with Walpole and other opposition whigs he adopted the effective tactic of showing the ministry his political importance while at the same time making himself so troublesome that the king would be forced to bring him back into the government. Such measures included the support offered by the Townshend&#150;Walpole whigs to Lord Oxford in May 1717 and opposition to the <span class="roman">Peerage Bill</span> in 1719. More positively, Townshend, along with Walpole, also reconciled the prince of Wales to his father. This and the successful piloting of the civil list through the House of Commons ensured Townshend's and Walpole's return to power.<h2>
<a name="Politicalcareer17201729"></a>Political career, 1720&#150;1729</h2>Early in 1720 Townshend was partially reconciled to Stanhope, and on 22 June George I appointed Townshend president of the council and Walpole paymaster-general of the forces. Following Stanhope's death from a stroke on 5 February 1721, Townshend was reappointed secretary of state for the northern department on 21 February. The forced retirement of Sunderland, who still held a court appointment as groom of the stole, and the latter's death on 19 April 1722, left Townshend and Walpole only one powerful enemy at court: John Carteret, then secretary of state for the southern department. Carteret, who spoke fluent French and German and was very knowledgeable about European affairs, in part because of his earlier position as ambassador to Sweden, wanted to protect Hanoverian interests by blocking Russian ambitions in the Baltic and securing the friendship of the emperor. Carteret's enforced move in April 1724 to become lord lieutenant of Ireland nullified this threat but also rid the ministry of its last common enemy. Walpole's skilful handling of the South Sea Bubble crisis marked a change in the equilibrium between Walpole and Townshend, although George I still favoured Townshend over his brother-in-law. The king granted his eldest son, Horatio, a peerage in May 1723 and made Townshend a knight of the Garter in July the following year.<br>
<br>The first major clash between Townshend and Walpole occurred over the treaty of Hanover, which Townshend concluded with France and Russia in order to counteract the Austro-Spanish treaty of Vienna (1725). Townshend insisted on retaining Gibraltar, which the Spanish had hoped to recover. Walpole, however, thought that Townshend was overstating the threat from the Austrians and attempting to overturn Britain's traditional alliance. As the political relationship between the two men unravelled, the death of Townshend's second wife on 29 March 1726 also weakened the ties that had bound them. Dolly, who died of smallpox, had been devoted to both her husband and her brother. Thereafter the rift between the two widened, with Townshend and Walpole now vying for power not only at court but also in Norfolk.<br>
<br>By the time George II ascended the throne in June 1727 the political pendulum had swung in favour of Walpole, who had assiduously courted the queen and spent a great deal of time with the king. Townshend's position at court had been further weakened during the years 1727&#150;8 because of his severe ill health. A struggle for power between the two men ensued. Chesterfield, who knew Townshend well, observed that the latter was &#145;not of a temper to act a second part, after having acted a first&#146;  (BL, Stowe MSS, Chesterfield characters). The same was even truer of Walpole, who wanted more influence in foreign policy and differed with Townshend over its direction. Townshend, for example, remained suspicious of Prussia, while both Walpole and the queen sought a closer alliance with that power. Townshend remained loyal to the Dutch. Although he believed that the territorial integrity of Austria was essential for Britain's long-term interests, he distrusted the Austrians, whom he regarded as ungrateful, obstinate, and likely to threaten the European system. He was fully aware too of the fragility of Britain's alliance with France. Walpole, in contrast, did not appreciate how divergent Britain's and France's long-term interests and aims were.<br>
<br>The relations between Townshend and his fellow secretary for foreign affairs, the duke of Newcastle, also worsened over time. In the early years of his ministry Newcastle, who had no diplomatic experience, was dependent on his colleague. After Townshend's illness Newcastle became increasingly confident and ambitious. It was Newcastle who helped to ignite the crisis that led to Townshend's resignation. The conclusion of the treaty of Seville in 1729 was undoubtedly the <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i>. While Townshend was in Hanover with the king, Walpole and Newcastle outmanoeuvred him. They dispatched William Stanhope to Spain to conclude a peace which provided that, in return for recognizing their claims to Parma and Piacenza, the Spanish would restore the privileges of the <i>asiento</i> and allow commissioners to adjudicate difficulties over trade in the Caribbean. Stanhope's reward was elevation to the peerage and later appointment to Townshend's position. This treaty solved nothing. Walpole never really appreciated the long-term consequences of his actions, nor did he comprehend the clash between British, French, and Spanish long-term interests or understand that not all problems could be resolved diplomatically.<br>
<br>When Townshend failed to obtain an appointment for either Chesterfield or Paul Methuen, he realized how little influence he retained. None the less, Walpole could not force him out and had to wait for him to resign. By 1730 it was clear that Townshend and Walpole could no longer work together; Walpole baited Townshend and quarrelled openly with him. Walpole's gratitude to Townshend for his past aid and support now counted for little. Although both were ambitious and hard-working, they shared little else. Townshend, a nobleman of a second generation, was scrupulously honest and frugal, while Walpole, a squire's son, was venal, lecherous, vulgar, and prodigal. Townshend was often forceful and blunt while Walpole was devious and frequently ingratiating. Walpole's allegation that Townshend did not pay enough attention to parliamentary opinion was unfounded. Nor is it true that fundamental policy clashes triggered Townshend's resignation, for policy changed little after his retirement.<br>
<br>Townshend had considered resigning as early as autumn 1729 but eventually took the decision on 15 May 1730, when he &#145;retired in disgust&#146;  (Coxe, <span class="italic">Walpole</span>, 1.332). Although he had enjoyed the work entailed in his position, he hated the continual intrigues. He never wavered from his resolution not to return to the capital or to become involved once more in political disputes. He never wrote to or saw Robert Walpole again, though he did maintain a tenuous relationship with the latter's brother Horatio. His resignation was tragic in that it marked the end not only of a successful political alliance and a dedicated public career but also the termination of a long friendship.<h2>
<a name="Retirementfamilyfarmandturnips"></a>Retirement: family, farm, and turnips</h2>Townshend retired to his Norfolk estate, where he devoted the remainder of his life to his friends, family, and farm, only occasionally serving as justice of the peace. This retirement rejuvenated him. He told a friend that he passed his time &#145;with great happyness and content&#146; which ought to &#145;be our chief care whilst we are in this world&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 28052, fol. 153). His improvements in agriculture, especially his championing of the value of turnips, a crop whose use he promoted as an integral part of a successful rotation plan, earned him the nickname Turnip Townshend. He also experimented with some of the new methods he had seen in the United Provinces and in Hanover, where the soil resembled that of Norfolk. Instead, for example, of sowing his turnips with the broadcast method, he drilled and hoed them. On his lands he used the four-crop &#145;Norfolk rotation&#146;: turnips, barley or oats, clover or rye, and wheat. This method was especially valuable because farmers did not have to let the land lie fallow and could maintain stock over the winter. In addition, Townshend enclosed, reclaimed, and improved his land through his use of quantities of manure and marl, and fed his cattle and sheep turnips over the winter. His goal was to transform previously unusable acreage into permanent arable through the use of restorative crops. Long-term leases were offered as incentives to his tenants to improve the land. Specific clauses in contracts often required tenants to participate in the cultivation of turnips. He was also interested in the scientific elements of farming and experimented with the breeding of livestock. Townshend's innovations were immortalized by Alexander Pope, who described an individual who &#145;Ploughs, burns, manures, and toils from Sun to Sun&#146;  (A. Pope, <span class="italic">Imitations of Horace</span>, epistle II, ii).<br>
<br>Contemporaries differed in their assessment. While some regarded Townshend as tall and handsome, others saw him as rough and bucolic. Godfrey Kneller's portrait of about 1704 depicts him as tall, with an oval face, thick eyebrows, and a long nose. John Macky praised him as a &#145;Gentleman of Great Learning, attended with a sweet Disposition; a Lover of the Constitution of his Country; is beloved by every Body that knows him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of the Secret Services</span>, 89). Lord Hervey, a partisan of Walpole known for his malicious pen, detested Townshend whom he called &#145;rash in his undertakings, violent in his proceedings, haughty in his carriage, brutal in his expressions, and cruel in his disposition; impatient of the least contradiction, and as slow to pardon as he was quick to resent&#146;  (Hervey, 1.108). This view was predictably echoed by Matthew Prior, who was indicted for his role in the Utrecht peace, and who described Townshend as &#145;brusque, arrogant, stubborn&#146;  (Eves, 330). William Coxe favoured the middle ground in his description of a man who, &#145;though impetuous and overbearing, was generous, highly disinterested, of unblemished integrity and unsullied honour&#146;  (Coxe, <span class="italic">Walpole</span>, 1.64). Townshend's &#145;sweetness of disposition&#146;  (<span class="italic">Private Correspondence of Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough</span>, 2.581) in fact glossed over his other faults and often endeared him to others.<br>
<br>Townshend was undoubtedly capable, determined, and hard-working, but in achieving his goals he sometimes appeared blunt, abrasive, stubborn, impatient, and overbearing. In contrast to many of his contemporaries whose venality was legendary he was scrupulously honest. He was generous to both friend and foe. He was also a passionate man who loved and hated quickly and rarely changed his mind once an opinion had been formed. The astute Lord Chesterfield pointed out that, though in appearance he was often rough and coarse, &#145;his nature was by no means so; for he was a kind husband to both his wives, a most indulgent father to all his children, and a benevolent master to his servants&#146;  (BL, Stowe MSS, Chesterfield characters, fol. 14).<br>
<br>Historians have often underrated Townshend's accomplishments in part because his rival Walpole outmanoeuvred and outlasted him. Townshend died at Raynham on 21 June 1738 and was buried there on 27 June.<h2>
<a name="Heirandoffspring"></a>Heir and offspring</h2>Townshend's eldest surviving son, <a name="cosubject_27618"></a><span class="headword">Charles Townshend</span>, third Viscount Townshend  (1700&#150;1764), <span class="occ">politician and benefactor</span>, was born on 11 July 1700 and baptized at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 15 July. After attending Eton College and King's College, Cambridge, where he was admitted in 1718, he was MP for Great Yarmouth between 1722 and 1723. In addition he held various offices, including lord of the bedchamber (1723&#150;7), master of the jewel house (1730&#150;39), lord lieutenant of Norfolk (1730&#150;38), succeeding his father, and high steward of Norwich Cathedral (from 1738 until his death). On 24 May 1723 he took his seat in the House of Lords as Baron Townshend of Lynn, and on 29 May he married Etheldreda (<i>c</i>.1708&#150;1788) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68358/', "Townshend, Etheldreda")</script>], the daughter of Edward Harrison, of Balls Park, Hertfordshire, a woman notorious for her wit and malice as much as for her promiscuity. They had five children, among them <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27624/', "George Townshend (1724&#150;1807)")</script>, an army officer and later fourth viscount, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27619/', "Charles Townshend (1725&#150;1767)")</script>, a politician. Although Charles and his wife were both somewhat eccentric, they differed in many ways; the marriage was not happy and the couple formally separated in 1741. He had an affair with his maid and fathered three more children, for whom he provided. Contemporaries praised his wit and imagination as well as his intelligence. In 1751 he published his thoughts on trade in a pamphlet, <span class="italic">National Thoughts, Recommended to the Serious Attention of the Public</span>. In Townshend's view industry created trade, and trade wealth; drunkenness and idleness were responsible for the miseries of the poor. A decline in trade caused a decline in national greatness. Townshend opposed the export of cheap corn because he believed that it would undercut Britain's trading position. He corresponded extensively with the economist Josiah Tucker and established a prize for the best paper written on trade theory at the University of Cambridge. The prize, intended to stimulate debate on commercial matters, ultimately proved a fiasco and was withdrawn. His endowment of a charity school at Raynham to educate both boys and girls also illustrated his social concern. He died on 12 March 1764 at Raynham and was buried there on 20 March. The bulk of his estate went either by entail or settlement to his eldest son, Charles, or to his estranged wife, who died on 9 March 1788.<br>
<br>The second viscount had three more sons from his first marriage who reached maturity. The Hon. <a name="cosubject_27635"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Townshend</span>  (1701&#150;1780), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 2 June 1701. He entered Eton College in 1718 and King's College, Cambridge, in 1720, graduating MA in 1727, and served as MP for Winchelsea from 1722 to 1727 and for Cambridge University between 1727 and 1774. During the early part of his political career he regularly attended parliament and spoke often on behalf of his constituents. A man of great charm, he acted as his father's secretary before serving as under-secretary of state (1724&#150;30), teller of the exchequer (1727&#150;80), and secretary to the duke of Devonshire, lord lieutenant of Ireland (1739&#150;45). On 2 May 1730 he married Albinia (<i>d</i>. 1739), the daughter of John Selwyn, of Matson; the couple had three sons and two daughters before Albinia's death on 7 September 1739. Thomas died on 21 May 1780.<br>
<br>Thomas's younger brother the Hon. <a name="cosubject_27637"></a><span class="headword">William Townshend</span>  (1702&#150;1738), also a <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 9 June 1702 and sat as MP for Great Yarmouth from 1723 until 1738. In addition in 1729 he was appointed groom of the bedchamber by Frederick, prince of Wales, with whom he enjoyed a close friendship. On 29 May 1725 William married Henrietta (<i>d</i>. 1755), the daughter of Lord William Powlett; they had one son and two daughters. William also served as usher of the exchequer from 1730 until his death, several months before his father, on 29 January 1738. The second viscount's fourth son, the Hon. <a name="cosubject_27634"></a><span class="headword">Roger Townshend</span>  (1708&#150;1760), an <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born on 15 June 1708. He joined the army as a cavalry officer and served as governor of Great Yarmouth garrison (1744&#150;5) and as an aide-de-camp to George II at the battle of Dettingen (1743). He was by then MP for Great Yarmouth, having been elected in 1737. In 1747 he transferred to represent Lord Cornwallis's pocket borough of Eye. In the following year he left the Commons, having taken up the position of receiver of customs, which he held until his death, on 7 August 1760. He was unmarried.<br>
