</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Steward,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1595, <em>d.</em> 1651), <span class="occ">dean of Chichester</span>, was baptized on 3 August 1595 at Pattishall, Northamptonshire, the third of four children of Nicholas Steward (1561&#150;1628) of Pattishall, and his first wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1615), whose maiden name was Madox. The Stewards were a family of long standing in Northamptonshire, possessing the advowson of the parish church at Pattishall and an estate at Loddington, near Kettering. Richard Steward matriculated from Magdalen Hall, Oxford, on 1 December 1609, graduated BA in 1612, and was elected a fellow of All Souls in 1613. He proceeded MA in 1615, BCL in 1617, and DCL on 3 July 1624, and served as proctor in 1622.<br>
<br>In 1626 Steward resigned his fellowship when the college presented him to the rectory of Harrietsham, Kent. He quickly rose through the ranks, enjoying the patronage of William Laud, with whom he shared a distrust of puritanism and similar views on the proper place of ceremony in the church, and for whom he later acted as a literary executor. So it was that Steward was presented by the king to a prebend at Worcester on 17 July 1629. The following year he became vicar of Aldbourne, Wiltshire&#151;where he later repositioned the communion table altarwise, according to Laudian practice&#151;and rector of Mildenhall and Alton Barnes, in the same county. This last benefice brought with it collation to a canonry at Salisbury. In 1633 Steward married Jane (<i>b</i>. 1612/13), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4238/', "Sir William Button, first baronet (1585&#150;1655)")</script>, of Alton and Tokenham, Wiltshire, and Ruth, daughter of Walter Dunche of Avebury, Wiltshire. Installed as a canon of Chichester Cathedral in May 1634, for the next eight years he served as dean; presiding over the consistory court he issued on several occasions orders enjoining catechizing and the wearing of surplices.<br>
<br>Steward was made a chaplain-in-ordinary to the king in 1633 and replaced Matthew Wren as clerk of the closet in 1636, appointments that marked the beginning of a more intimate association of Steward in the confessional and spiritual life of the monarch. Steward was presented by the king to a prebend at Westminster on 24 April 1638; having resigned his Worcester prebend, he was installed in December. He accompanied Charles to Berwick and witnessed the negotiations there with the Scots in June&#150;July 1639, and then on 28 December 1639 was appointed by the king to replace Sir Henry Wotton as provost of Eton College. In 1640 he was mentioned as a potential lord keeper, but instead acquired a high public profile by reason of his appointment as prolocutor of convocation in April 1640, no doubt a reflection of his reputation as a reliable courtier and skilful negotiator. He played a key role in winning a vote for subsidies to be paid by the clergy to the king, and piloting through the controversial canons that upheld the discipline and ceremonies of the church. His reward came in the form of the nomination to the deanery of St Paul's, confirmed in March 1642, though he was never installed. He was admitted by royal grant to the prebend of St Pancras, also in March 1642, and in 1643 was made dean of the Chapel Royal.<br>
<br>The outbreak of the civil war witnessed Steward's ejection from the provostship of Eton in January 1644 and subsequent deprivation of his other preferments, and it prevented him from taking possession of the deanery of Westminster, to which he was nominated in 1645. However, despite these set-backs he played perhaps his most public role as one of six ecclesiastical commissioners in January&#150;February 1645 at the negotiations with parliament at Uxbridge, where he is reported to have &#145;spake very learnedly (though seeming frowardly) against presbyterial government&#146;  (Whitelocke, 1.379, 390), and where he argued for divine-right episcopacy and the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>.<br>
<br>Steward probably remained in Oxford from 1643 until the fall of the city, when he fled abroad and into the service of the prince of Wales, who had been instructed by the king to heed &#145;his [Steward's] advice &hellip; in everything which concerns conscience or church affairs&#146;  (Ogle and Bliss, 1.205). He acted as a preacher to English exiles at St Germain during 1647&#150;8, and was with the prince at The Hague in the autumn of 1648. Steward accompanied the new king to Jersey in June 1649, but remained behind when Charles returned to the Netherlands in December.<br>
<br>Steward was held in high regard by Charles I, who described him as &#145;my honest and faithful servant&#146;, and &#145;a discreet, good man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Charles I in 1646</span>, 63). He also maintained a good working relationship with Sir Edward Hyde, with whom he shared a commitment to defend the English liturgy and a fear that sacrilegious compromise with the royalists' enemies would attract divine retribution. This became the main theme of his writings (mainly published posthumously), which include six published sermons and two pamphlets in a typically &#145;smart fluent stile&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.296), of which <span class="italic">A Discourse of Episcopacy and Sacrilege</span> (1683) is perhaps the most characteristic. Unsurprisingly, Steward was critical of a proposed treaty with Scottish presbyterianism during 1649&#150;50, and he condemned proposals that would have allowed foreign divines a voice in deciding the future of the Church of England. In doing so, he affirmed his opposition to Queen Henrietta Maria's party based at the Louvre. In contrast, his friends were drawn mainly from the Laudian wing of the ecclesiastical party, and included John Cosin, Gilbert Sheldon, and Henry Hammond. However, while fellow exile John Evelyn called him an &#145;excellent and pious person&#146;  (Evelyn, 3.40), critics argued his conviction of moral certainty often resembled stubbornness or intolerance.<br>
<br>Steward had acted as a tutor to James, duke of York, before his capture by parliament in 1646, and the two were reunited in Jersey. They remained there a year before returning to Paris in 1650 when Steward was formerly adopted as James's chaplain and served on his council. He was successful in discouraging the duke from adopting the Roman Catholic faith, a further reflection of his unswerving commitment to maintaining the integrity and independence of the Church of England. Steward probably followed his master to Brussels and The Hague in October 1650, before returning to Paris later in the year. Apart from a brief journey to Holland in the summer of 1651, he remained there to preach and officiate until a chronic consumptive illness claimed his life on 15 November 1651. He was buried on the 17th in the protestant cemetery near St Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s. By this time his wife seems to have died, but he was survived by their son Charles (1638?&#150;1698), who, following a career at Oriel College, Oxford, retired to the life of a country gentleman.<br>
