<span class="headword">Quain,  Richard</span>  (1800&#150;1887), <span class="occ">anatomist and surgeon</span>, was born in July 1800 at Fermoy, co. Cork, Ireland, the third son of Richard Quain, of Ratheahy, co. Cork, a gentleman farmer, and his first wife, whose maiden name of Jones became the Christian name of their eldest son, also an anatomist. The subject of this biography (henceforth, Quain) is occasionally mistaken for his half-brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22938/', "Sir John Richard Quain")</script>, a judge, and very frequently confused (even in contemporary historical literature) with his cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22941/', "Sir Richard Quain")</script>, a physician. All four Quains had intimate associations with University College.<br>
<br>Quain was educated locally at Adairs School, Fermoy, and underwent an apprenticeship with a surgeon in Ireland. He then followed his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22939/', "Jones Quain")</script> to London, where the latter was associated with the Aldersgate School of Anatomy, one of the private anatomy schools that flourished in London until the late 1820s. Quain then spent some time studying in Paris, where a friend of his father, Richard Bennett, was an extramural lecturer in anatomy. When in 1828 Bennett became demonstrator in anatomy at the new University of London (now University College, London), Quain followed to assist. There was much jockeying for power and position in the new medical school, and Bennett (who had applied for the chair in anatomy) quarrelled from the beginning with the anatomy professor, Granville Sharp Pattison. The students, whose fees counted for much, preferred Bennett's teaching, and Charles Bell, professor of surgery, also gave surgical anatomy lectures. By 1831 the air had cleared somewhat, following Bell's departure to the Middlesex Hospital, Pattison's forced resignation, and Bennett's death. Jones Quain was appointed professor of anatomy, and his brother became (in 1832) professor of descriptive anatomy. By then, relations between the brothers were not cordial.<br>
<br>Quain held this chair until 1850, during which period he had a number of able demonstrators, including Erasmus Wilson, Viner Ellis, and John Marshall. Quain also produced his major work, <span class="italic">The Anatomy of the Arteries of the Human Body</span> (3 vols., 1841&#150;4), a handsome folio, the drawings for which were done by surgeon&#150;artist Joseph Maclise, brother of the Royal Academician. The work was based on more than 1000 dissections, and although essentially descriptive, it dealt with arterial diseases and anomalies as well as normal structure and distribution. Quain also edited (with William Sharpey) the fifth edition (1848) of <span class="italic">Elements of Anatomy</span>, the earlier edition of which had been written by Jones Quain. Quain had been instrumental in luring William Sharpey to London from Edinburgh, to take over Jones Quain's general anatomy (physiology) teaching when the latter left University College in 1836.<br>
<br>Quain was also appointed assistant surgeon to the North London Hospital (subsequently University College Hospital) shortly after it opened in 1834. He was promoted to full surgeon in 1850, but was deeply disappointed not to obtain the vacant chair in surgery, which went to Eric Erichsen. Quain was a conservative, even timid surgeon whose active career was over by the time antiseptic techniques revolutionized the discipline. He was methodical in all details of patient care and demanding of his students. Of short stature, he was pompous and authoritarian, quick to attribute bad motives to anyone who disagreed with him.<br>
<br>Quain's clinical publications were not of lasting importance. <span class="italic">The Diseases of the Rectum</span> (1854) was based largely on his own experience with rectal diseases; his <span class="italic">Clinical Lectures</span> (1884) gathered together material, much of which had been published in journals long before. Its appearance late in Quain's life probably owed more to vanity than consumer demand.<br>
<br>A member of the Royal College of Surgeons from 1828, Quain was one of the original fellows when that rank was created in 1843. He sat on the college's council and its court of examiners, represented it on the General Medical Council and served (1868) as its president. He was elected FRS in 1844, and was surgeon-extraordinary to Queen Victoria.<br>
<br>One of the most attractive aspects of this irascible man was Quain's advocacy of a more liberal education for medical students. The subject of his 1869 Hunterian lecture at the Royal College of Surgeons was defects in the current system of educating doctors, and he had published a variety of pamphlets and articles on the same general theme over many years. True to his principles, he left the bulk of his estate, valued at about &pound;78,000, to University College, London, for the promotion and encouragement of &#145;general education in modern languages (especially in English language and composition in that language) and in natural science&#146;. The present Quain chairs at University College, London, derive from this bequest. Quain used to list speaking correct English as one of his hobbies.<br>
<br>Some of Quain's estate had been left to him by his half-brother, Sir John Richard Quain, whose name Quain also wished to be perpetuated. Quain's late marriage, in 1859, to Ellen Brodrick, (<i>d</i>. 1886), Viscountess Midleton, widow of the fifth viscount, had produced no children. He died on 15 September 1887 at his last residence, 32 Cavendish Square, London, of cystitis and urinary retention, having refused Sir Henry Thompson permission to attempt to crush the obstructing bladder stone, an operation he had performed successfully on Quain a decade earlier. He was buried in Marylebone cemetery, Finchley, Middlesex, on 21 September. Confusion of the two medical Richard Quains had already begun, his cousin's wife receiving a number of letters of condolence on the putative death of her husband.<br>
