</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Meade,  James Edward</span>  (1907&#150;1995), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born on 23 June 1907 at Broome, Swanage, Dorset, the second child and only son of Charles Hippisley Meade (<i>b</i>. 1866/7?) and his wife, Kathleen Cotton (Kitty), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stapleton (<i>b</i>. 1884), daughter of George Cotton Stapleton. He was brought up at 6 Lansdown Crescent, Bath, Somerset, where his father, an Oxford graduate and the descendant of a long line of country parsons, lived the quiet and unostentatious life of a gentleman. Socially, religiously, and politically conservative, he was not an encouraging role model for his son, but, a fine woodworker, he did teach him carpentry. He sent his son at the age of ten to Lambrook School, a preparatory school, and four years later to Malvern College. Meade disliked the emphasis on games at Malvern but two masters, the left-wing classics master and the music master, who took some of his pupils to the Salzburg festival, &#145;kept [him] sane&#146;. Another element of sanity was provided by his paternal aunt Sybil, an eccentric in a family with more than its fair share of eccentrics, whom he visited often during his holidays from school. He left Malvern in 1926 with a love of music, many prizes, for English verse and Latin prose among others, and a classical scholarship to Oriel College, Oxford. He switched from Greats to the newly established course in philosophy, politics, and economics at the end of his second year. In the summer of 1930 he gained an outstanding first-class degree and was elected to a fellowship in economics at Hertford College.<h2>
<a name="Ayoungeconomist"></a>A young economist</h2>Oxford was a welcome liberation from Bath society. Meade joined the Labour Club and became a member of the &#145;Cole group&#146; of young socialists (gathered around G. D. H. Cole, then a fellow of University College). His switch to economics was motivated by concern with the serious unemployment problem in Britain in the 1920s; in 1928 he also thought it could easily be cured, his aunt Sybil having introduced him to the writings of the monetary crank Clifford (Hugh) Douglas. He soon shed this belief but throughout his career his main concern was with the contribution which economic analysis had to make to the solution of problems of practical economic policy. He was one of several young Oxford economists advising the Labour Party in the 1930s; then and later he described himself as a liberal socialist, who believed in using the market mechanism for egalitarian ends. A convinced internationalist, he was also active in the League of Nations Union.<br>
<br>Meade spent the academic year 1930&#150;31 in Cambridge. Hertford had allowed him a postgraduate year to learn more economics (and some mathematics); Dennis Robertson, whom he had met in Bath through Robertson's aunts, who were neighbours in Lansdown Crescent, had invited him to Trinity College. Meade was both a pupil of Robertson and a member of the &#145;Cambridge circus&#146;, the group of young economists including Richard Kahn, Piero Sraffa, Austin Robinson, and Joan Robinson, who gathered together to analyse and criticize the recently published <span class="italic">Treatise on Money</span> (1930) of John Maynard Keynes. He worked closely with Kahn, whose employment multiplier showed that an exogenous increase in investment would lead to successive increase in aggregate demand and so in incomes; Kahn gave the name &#145;Mr Meade's relation&#146; to Meade's finding that these increases in income would bring desired savings into equality with the initial exogenous increase in investment. These relations, which implied that adjustments in aggregate demand and income would bring about macroeconomic equilibrium, were essential ingredients of the theoretical system of Keynes's <span class="italic">General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</span> (1936). Meade, having fallen under the spell of the &#145;magician&#146; Keynes, returned to Oxford already a Keynesian in the modern (post-1936) sense.<br>
<br>Back in Oxford in the Michaelmas term 1931, Meade set his first students to read Keynes's work. They remembered him as a dry but lucid lecturer and an excellent tutor whose enthusiasm for his subject was contagious. He continued his research in monetary theory, publishing his first book, <span class="italic">The Rate of Interest in a Progressive State</span>, in 1933. At the same time, in a Fabian pamphlet, <span class="italic">Public Works in their International Aspect</span>, he used the idea of the multiplier (and his &#145;relation&#146;) to argue for countercyclical government expenditure on public works, accompanied by the appropriate monetary policy, to prevent unemployment in slumps and inflation in booms, and for international monetary co-operation to avert the balance-of-payments problems of domestically orientated macroeconomic policies. Advising Hugh Dalton, a future Labour chancellor of the exchequer, he advocated the removal of barriers to trade, a flexible (but managed) exchange rate for sterling, and the use of exchange controls to regulate the capital account of the balance of payments, in order to permit the adoption of a macroeconomic employment policy by a Labour government.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1932 Albert Einstein visited Oxford. Gilbert Murray asked the new secretary of the Oxford branch of the League of Nations Union, (Elizabeth) Margaret Wilson (<i>b</i>. 1908), daughter of Alexander Cowan Wilson, a civil engineer, to get together a group of young dons to meet him. She invited Meade, whom she had met once before through her younger brother, who had rowed in the same Oriel boat as Meade when an undergraduate. They married on 14 March 1933, setting up house at 11 Holywell Street. In their long and happy life together they were to have a son and three daughters.<br>
<br>Meade wrote the first modern Keynesian textbook, <span class="italic">An Introduction to Economic Analysis and Policy</span>, in 1936. He tried &#145;to expound the whole corpus of Economic Theory without taking any knowledge of technical terms for granted and with full use of the more recent developments&#146;  (Preface) and to include every piece of theory with an application to current economic problems, beginning with the problem of unemployment. The book was immediately successful and had gone into a third, American edition and a French translation by 1939.<br>
<br>By 1937 Meade was looking for the opportunity to devote more time to (policy-orientated) research. When he and Margaret took a holiday on the Riviera they disliked it so much that Margaret suggested they go on to Geneva, which she knew well from her parents living there and her work for the League of Nations Union. In Geneva they met Dennis Robertson, who introduced them to Alexander Loveday, director of the financial section and economic intelligence service of the League of Nations. Loveday invited Meade to join the economic intelligence service to write its <span class="italic">World Economic Survey</span>, and Meade's college gave him leave of absence for four years from December 1937. Meade wrote two excellent surveys but he did not return to Oxford because of the Second World War.<h2>
<a name="Warservice"></a>War service</h2>In 1940 Meade was offered wartime employment with the British government. He and his wife with their three small children undertook a nightmare journey by car across France in May, arriving exhausted at Nantes only to find themselves stranded on board ship without an escort: all available craft were evacuating the British army from Dunkirk. When they reached England in June they had no home; soon after Meade took up his job in Whitehall, Margaret and the children very reluctantly sailed to America. Fortunately they were able to return in November 1942.<br>
<br>Meade's first assignment in what was to become the economic section of the war cabinet offices in 1941 was to prepare estimates of national income and expenditure as part of a survey of resources available for the war effort. He drew up a complicated and comprehensive system of balancing tables; a young Cambridge graduate in the Ministry of Economic Warfare, Richard Stone, was sent over to help him with the statistics. Meade's description of what happened next characteristically downplays his own initial contribution: Stone joined Meade in his tiny room with its single desk, established himself on a corner of the desk with a quill pen and a hand calculator, and gradually moved from the corner of the desk to the centre, while Meade turned the handle of the calculator. With the active encouragement of Keynes in the Treasury, their calculations, the first modern double-entry social accounts for any country, were utilized in the &#145;Keynesian&#146; budget of April 1941 and published with it; they also published, jointly, academic and popular accounts of their methods (notably <span class="italic">National Income and Expenditure</span>, 1944).<br>
<br>In February 1941 Meade wrote the first of a long series of memoranda on the subject of post-war reconstruction, identifying four problems: unemployment, the standard of living and the distribution of income, the form of industrial structure, and the re-establishment of international trade and finance. His proposals for post-war employment policy included measures for influencing consumption expenditure countercyclically along the lines of his <span class="italic">Consumers' Credits and Unemployment</span> (1938), which he had written before he left Oxford. The Beveridge committee on social insurance and allied services provided him with an opportunity to put forward a detailed scheme for variations in the rate of social security contributions as a means of stabilizing the demand for labour. He tried it out first on Keynes, who had sympathetically reviewed his book in the <span class="italic">Economic Journal</span>, before submitting it to the committee. Although Meade's scheme did not appear in the Beveridge report, it was included as an appendix to the white paper <span class="italic">Employment Policy</span> in May 1944.<br>
<br>Meade wrote the first draft, in March 1943, of what eventually became the employment white paper. Adverse Treasury reaction meant it had a long and circuitous route to travel. Keynes, less pessimistic than Meade about the possibility of post-war depression, was not entirely sympathetic either, but he endeavoured to educate his Treasury colleagues to the necessity of a macroeconomic employment policy. When a small steering committee, including the permanent secretary of the Treasury, Sir Richard Hopkins, and the director of the economic section, Lionel Robbins, managed at last to produce an agreed report, Keynes commented that it was &#145;indeed an outstanding State Paper which, if one casts one's mind back ten years or so, represents a revolution in official opinion&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Collected Writings of John Maynard Keynes</span>, 27, 1980, 364).<br>
<br>Meade was also a founding father of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (later the World Trade Organization). Early in the war, before he left Geneva, he had written a short book, <span class="italic">The Economic Basis of a Durable Peace</span> (1940), dedicating it at Christmas 1939 to his children. Believing that a satisfactory peace settlement would require the existence of an international organization, he considered the economic role that such an organization would need to play in the post-war world. He favoured an international bank with the power to issue an international currency against which individual countries would peg their exchange rates but be able to adjust the pegs if the pursuit of high employment policies threatened persistent losses of reserves. The countries adhering to these international arrangements would have to commit themselves to multilateral free trade and payments arrangements. Hence when Keynes produced his &#145;clearing union&#146; plan for the post-war international currency system, Meade proposed a complementary &#145;international commercial union&#146; to restore multilateral trade and remove trade restrictions after the war. Dalton, now president of the Board of Trade in the wartime coalition government, took this up enthusiastically, and arranged for Meade to be seconded part-time to his department. The Keynes and the Meade plans formed the basis of the British contributions to the wartime Anglo-American discussions on the post-war international economic order; Meade crossed the Atlantic for the first time to take part in the talks in Washington in September&#150;October 1943.<br>
<br>Further discussions led to the Anglo-American <span class="italic">Proposals for Consideration by an International Conference on Trade and Employment</span>, published in December 1945. Meade served as a British representative on the preparatory commission for the conference, which met in London in 1946 and in Geneva in 1947 to produce a draft charter for an International Trade Organization. The ITO Charter adopted at the Havana conference in March 1948 was not ratified, but its main principles were incorporated in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiated in Geneva in 1947.<br>
<br>In November 1944 Meade had been persuaded to succeed Robbins as director of the economic section at the end of the war; he took over officially in January 1946. When he agreed to serve, he had high hopes of what government economists could achieve on both domestic and international economic policy fronts; he also thought he might be able to pursue his academic ambitions by writing a new edition of his <span class="italic">Economic Analysis and Policy</span>. But in the event his position did not give him the chance to influence domestic economic policy in the directions he wished it to go. Dalton, chancellor of the exchequer in the first majority Labour government, decided to pursue a policy of low interest rates much further than Meade thought safe. This was only one of several issues on which they disagreed&#151;and on which Dalton did not heed Meade's advice. Meade's macroeconomic conception of &#145;economic planning&#146;, which was essentially the use of financial policy to influence aggregate demand, was adopted by Dalton's successor Stafford Cripps, several months after Meade had resigned in frustration and ill health in the spring of 1947. As two of his former colleagues put it, Meade<blockquote>was advising the wrong minister at the wrong time. &hellip; Moreover, he was uncomfortable in a world of physical controls when his vision was of a world of financial controls. &hellip; Meade, more than any man&#151;more than Keynes&#151;was the prophet of demand management when the world was not yet ready for demand management. (Cairncross and Watts, 130)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="LondonSchoolofEconomics"></a>London School of Economics</h2>Meade returned to academic life, this time to the London School of Economics (LSE), where Lionel Robbins had suggested he take the Cassel professorship of commerce with special reference to international trade. Here, as a direct result of his wartime work on economic policy, he was to make his most lasting contributions to economic <i>theory</i>. His plan was to produce a &#145;&#147;Treatise on Economic Policy&#148; (probably in five or six volumes)&#146; which would cover much the same ground as his pre-war textbook but reflect his experience in government  (Meade to Robbins, 3 June 1947, BPLES, Robbins MSS). Since he had been hired to teach international economics, he began on his planned last volume, on international economic policy.<br>
<br>Meade did not follow the conventional order of writing on trade before finance. He began by constructing a general-equilibrium comparative static model for an economy open to trade and capital flows, synthesizing Keynesian and classical theory and extending it in order to analyse the effects of different policy instruments and other variables on internal and external balance. Since his &#145;method of work &hellip; [was] to make a simple mathematical model of most of the problems before writing about them&#146; in simple prose, the result appeared in a book, <span class="italic">The Theory of International Economic Policy, Volume 1, The Balance of Payments</span> (1951), with a separate mathematical supplement containing the model, which also appeared in journal articles. The first systematic exploration of the relationship between domestic and international equilibrium, Meade's model became &#145;part of the baggage of every economist&#146;  (Corden and Atkinson, 529), the most important single influence behind the development of open economy macroeconomics in the next four decades.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Theory of International Economic Policy, Volume 2: Trade and Welfare</span> (1955) was equally pathbreaking. It made at least three major and lasting contributions to economics: a fundamental reformulation of the theory of economic welfare to make it both operational and more widely applicable; the use of this new theory to analyse controls on factor movements as well as controls on trade; and the extension of the analysis from two-country models to a many-country world, including its application to the theory of customs unions. Meade originally drafted much of the book on the basis of the &#145;new welfare economics&#146; of the late 1930s but he rewrote it to utilize (and expand on) the method of his former wartime colleague Marcus Fleming's &#145;On making the best of balance of payments restrictions on imports&#146;  (published in the <span class="italic">Economic Journal</span>, 1951).<blockquote>It was a brilliant feat of imagination &hellip; to realize &hellip; [Fleming's method] was capable of large-scale generalization into a powerful tool for welfare analysis of practical policy problems, and an act of great intellectual honesty and courage for him to scrap his existing draft and rework the whole problem on the new approach. (Johnson, 73)</blockquote>Meade was awarded the Nobel memorial prize in 1977, jointly with the Swedish international economist Bertil Ohlin, for the work in the two volumes.<br>
<br>Throughout his LSE years Meade wrote extensively on topical issues of economic policy. To the public debate in England on planning he contributed <span class="italic">Planning and the Price Mechanism: the Liberal-Socialist Solution</span> (1948): he argued persuasively for the restoration of the market system and the use of financial policy instruments which work through the price mechanism for the control of inflation and deflation. He also urged the use of taxation, including if necessary and feasible a capital levy, to promote a more egalitarian distribution of income and wealth. In several papers on current international economic arrangements he made clear his then unfashionable preference for flexible exchange rates as the best way to reconcile free trade, domestic full employment, and external balance.<h2>
<a name="Cambridgeandretirement"></a>Cambridge and retirement</h2>In 1957 Meade succeeded Dennis Robertson as professor of political economy in Cambridge. He and his family now made their home in a Cambridgeshire village, first Hauxton and then Little Shelford. In his first Cambridge decade, as well as making important contributions to the theory of economic growth and income distribution, he recommenced his ambitious project of a multi-volume treatise on economic policy. He had completed two volumes of his <span class="italic">Principles of Political Economy</span> (1965 and 1968) before he decided to resign the chair in 1968. He had not been made welcome by the Cambridge Keynesians, for whom he was too &#145;neo-classical&#146;&#151;being prepared, as he told students, to use &#145;Classical and Keynesian analysis and any old tools which seem to be relevant&#146; to economic problems  (personal knowledge). With a research fellowship from his college, Christ's, and the continuing intellectual support of younger Cambridge colleagues, he produced two more volumes of <span class="italic">Principles</span> (1972 and 1976) before the temptations of policy-orientated collaborative research made him less single-minded about the theoretical project. What might have formed the fifth volume appeared as a political tract, <span class="italic">The Intelligent Radical's Guide to Economic Policy</span> (1975), dedicated like <span class="italic">Planning and the Price Mechanism</span> to his wife.<br>
<br>Meade returned to macroeconomics in 1978 to lead a major research project on &#145;stagflation&#146; in the department of applied economics at Cambridge. He had long been concerned with the inflation problem in a fully employed economy (his well-known Cambridge inaugural lecture had been on the subject), and had reconsidered the concept of internal balance he had used in <span class="italic">The Balance of Payments</span>. He now had three policy targets in mind: the balance of payments, full employment, and price stability. He proposed a &#145;New Keynesian&#146; assignment of policy instruments to these targets: monetary and fiscal policy to maintaining total money expenditure (nominal GDP [gross domestic product]), reform of wage-fixing arrangements to full employment, and exchange rate policies to the balance of payments. While his younger collaborators worked on the design of the appropriate demand-management policies, he concentrated on the reform of wage-fixing arrangements.<br>
<br>On the wage-fixing front Meade explored several avenues over two decades. From the outset he rejected the extreme &#145;solutions&#146; of incomes policies and union bashing. He came eventually to advocate the system he found in Agathotopia. As he explained:<blockquote>I recently set sail to visit the island of Utopia &hellip; But, alas, I could find the island Nowhere. However on my way home I chanced to visit the island of Agathotopia. The inhabitants made no claim for perfection in their social arrangements, but they did claim the island to be a Good Place to live in. I studied their institutions closely, came to the conclusion that their social arrangements were indeed about as good as one could hope to achieve in this wicked world, and returned home to recommend Agathotopian arrangements for my own country. (Meade, <span class="italic">Liberty, Equality and Efficiency</span>, 1993, 104)</blockquote>Agathotopia had a widespread structure of labour&#150;capital partnerships rather than capitalist firms; it also had a government committed to maintaining the desirable rate of growth of money GDP; and an ingenious set of arrangements for encouraging a more equal distribution of income and wealth. As Meade had realized at least thirty years earlier, the use of flexible factor prices to ensure efficient employment of all resources could lead to unacceptably low wages; it was necessary deliberately to separate the problem of employment from the problem of distribution by providing, for instance, a basic income or &#145;social dividend&#146; to all citizens, as well as a more equal distribution of property. Agathotopia was the closest Meade came to the solution of the problem of the dual function of the price mechanism, which means that the prices of goods and factors of production that promote the most efficient use of resources might well produce an unacceptably unequal distribution of income from those resources. His concern for both efficiency and equality, spelt out most clearly in <span class="italic">Efficiency, Equality and the Ownership of Property</span> (1964), was a feature of the two &#145;Meade reports&#146;, <span class="italic">The Economic and Social Structure of Mauritius</span> (1961) and <span class="italic">The Structure and Reform of Direct Taxation</span> (1978).<br>
<br>Meade was always youthful in appearance as well as in spirit. In old age he looked more youthful than in photographs of his middle age: the abandoning of thick-rimmed glasses meant that the eyes sparkling with intelligence, good humour, and tolerance were more readily seen. He was a man of integrity and optimism, and cynicism was foreign to his nature; in spite of his experiences in Whitehall he never abandoned his belief in the ability of men and women to make for themselves a better society. A modest man&#151;though justifiably proud of his achievements&#151;he disliked honours and declined a knighthood on leaving government service; he was made a companion of the Bath in 1947. Elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1951, he served as chairman of section F in 1957, and as president of the Royal Economic Society in 1964&#150;6. Among his many talents were a fine baritone singing voice and his woodworking skills, which he put to good effect in making ingenious mechanical toys for his children and grandchildren. He died at his home, 40 High Street, Little Shelford, Cambridgeshire, on 22 December 1995, of multiple myeloma, and was cremated at Cambridge on 29 December. He was survived by his wife and four children.<br>
