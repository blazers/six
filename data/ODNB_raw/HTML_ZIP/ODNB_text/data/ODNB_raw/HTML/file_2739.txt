<span class="headword">Boate,  Arnold</span>  (1606&#150;1653), <span class="occ">biblical scholar and writer on natural history</span>, was born in Gorinchem in the Netherlands, a younger son of Godefroy de Boot (<i>c</i>.1570&#150;1625), knight, and Christina van Loon (<i>fl</i>. 1600&#150;1630). With his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2740/', "Gerard Boate")</script> he studied arts and medicine at the University of Leiden, graduating as a doctor in 1630. In the same year the two brothers moved to London to practise as physicians, and they were subsequently involved in some disputes with the College of Physicians. Arnold Boate was, however, lucky enough to be appointed personal physician to Robert Sidney, earl of Leicester, then viceroy in Ireland. As a result of this, and possibly owing to scholarly contacts with James Ussher, archbishop of Armagh, Boate moved to Ireland in 1636, where he became physician to Ussher and to Lord Deputy Wentworth. Ussher acted as Boate's patron in Dublin and it was to him and Robert Sidney, Boate's initial patron, that Arnold and Gerard dedicated their attack on the Aristotelian system, <span class="italic">Philosophia naturalis reformata</span> (1641). Through Ussher's influence Boate was appointed as surgeon-general for Ireland, an experience that encouraged him to write <span class="italic">A Remonstrance of Divers Remarkable Passages &hellip; of our Army in &hellip; Ireland</span> (1642).<br>
<br>Boate's marriage to Margaret Dongan or Dungan (<i>d</i>. 1651), daughter of Thomas Dungan, justice of the court of common pleas at Dublin, on Christmas day 1642 strengthened his links with the protestant Dublin gentry. They had three children: the elder daughter died on 2 October 1647 aged three and her brother died on 15 May 1649, aged seven months; the younger daughter, Maria Anna Boot, born on 13 September 1646, later married Marcus Beyerman. On the death of his wife, due to complications in pregnancy, on 17 April 1651 Boate wrote a very affecting memoir of his marriage to her, <span class="italic">The character of a trulie vertuous and pious woman, as it hath been acted by Mistris Margaret Dungan</span> (1651).<br>
<br>The aftermath of the Irish rising of 1641 had forced Boate to leave Ireland in 1644. He initially stayed with his brother in London from May to October, but he then moved to Paris, which became his base for the rest of his life. It is this period that saw Boate's involvement in scholarly disputes with Louis Capel, French Calvinist theologian at Saumur. Boate had already published at Leiden a work, in conjunction with Francis Taylor, in 1636 entitled <span class="italic">Examen Praefationis Morini in Biblia Graeca de textus Ebraici corruptione et Graeci authoritate</span>. In 1644 Boate published at London a further treatise concerned with the Hebrew text of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, <span class="italic">Animadversiones sacrae ad textum Hebraicum veteris testamenti</span>, which evoked a reply from Capel. A pamphlet war ensued that not only involved Boate and Capel but also J. Morin, Capel's editor, and John Buxtorf, who rejected some of Capel's conclusions. Boate was also successful in involving Ussher in his dispute with Capel, as is demonstrated by his 1650 publication at Paris, <span class="italic">De textus Hebraici veteris testamenti certitudine et authoritate contra Ludovici Capelli criticam epistola Arnoldi Bootii ad reverendissimum Jacobum Usserium archiepiscoporum Armachanum</span>. Boate's last printed work, <span class="italic">Arnoldi Bootii vindiciae, seu, Apodixis apologetica pro Hebraica veritate</span> (1653), containing a dedication to Gisbert Voet, professor of theology at the University of Utrecht, was also concerned with the Capel dispute.<br>
<br>However, Boate's interest extended beyond Hebraic studies, as is demonstrated by his <span class="italic">Observationes medicinae</span> (1649) and even more significantly by the vital role that he played in the consolidation of an Irish wing of the Hartlib circle, a wide-ranging group of scholars who corresponded on scientific, religious, and political issues with Samuel Hartlib. Even after he departed from Ireland Boate continued to act as a conduit between Ussher and Hartlib, exchanging letters, books, and news of scholarly advances and disputes between the two. He played a major role in the development of one of the major publications of the Hartlib circle concerning Ireland, Gerard Boate's <span class="italic">Irelands Naturall History</span> (1652), which had prefaces by Hartlib and Arnold Boate. The latter's preface indicates not only his millenarian preoccupations, but also the fact that much of <span class="italic">Irelands Naturall History</span> was based on his own recollections of his journeys in Ireland, particularly in the provinces of Leinster and Ulster, as his brother had never actually been there. The 1652 edition of <span class="italic">Irelands Naturall History</span> included only the first part of the work, illustrating the essentially Baconian empirical approach of the Hartlib circle. The initial project had, however, encompassed a far wider endeavour, covering areas such as Irish flora and fauna, but all the time aiming at a consolidated approach to colonization. Hartlib was already aware of Boate's own interest in the natural history of Ireland for Boate had written a commentary on Hartlib's own &#145;Legacie of husbandry&#146; in 1652. He therefore wanted Arnold to finish the entire project, but Boate's death in Paris in 1653 prevented him from doing so.<br>
