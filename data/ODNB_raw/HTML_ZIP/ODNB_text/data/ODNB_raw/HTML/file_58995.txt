<span class="headword">Power,  Rhoda Dolores Le Poer</span>  (1890&#150;1957), <span class="occ">broadcaster and children's writer</span>, was born on 29 May 1890 at Parkdale, Dunham Massey, Altrincham, Cheshire, the second of the three daughters of Philip Ernest Le Poer Power (<i>b</i>. 1860), stockbroker, of Altrincham, Cheshire, and his wife, Mabel Grindlay Clegg (1866&#150;1903). She was the sister of the historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35581/', "Eileen Power (1889&#150;1940)")</script> and of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45653/', "Beryl Power (1891&#150;1974)")</script>. The family came originally from Waterford, Ireland, but there is no evidence that it was connected to the Le Poer family of Waterford. In 1891 her father was sent to prison for five years for forgery, and was declared bankrupt, and was imprisoned again in 1905 for another five years. Rhoda did not see her father again after 1891. The family moved to London, and then Bournemouth, and in 1899 went to Switzerland, where her mother was treated for tuberculosis. After their mother's death, Rhoda and her sisters moved to Oxford with their maternal grandfather, and were educated at Oxford High School for Girls. She studied languages and political economy at St Andrews University from 1911 to 1913, and won a distinction in economic history. After leaving university, she taught for a year in the United States, and in 1916 went to Russia as governess to the daughter of a businessman in Rostov-on-Don. In <span class="italic">Under Cossack and Bolshevik</span> (1919) she described her experiences there during the Russian Revolution, when Rostov, a Cossack town, was attacked by Bolshevik forces. After the war she worked as a freelance journalist, lived in Palestine for a time, and wrote travel guides.<br>
<br>In the mid-1920s Rhoda and Eileen Power started a series of history books for children. The first of these, <span class="italic">Boys and Girls in History</span> (1926), was an attempt to illustrate life in England through the lives of children, based on contemporary accounts. Other books written together included <span class="italic">Twenty Centuries of Travel</span> (1926) and <span class="italic">Cities and their Stories</span> (1927). In the 1930s she continued to write children's histories on her own, including <span class="italic">Great People of the Past</span> (1932) and <span class="italic">The Kingsway Histories for Juniors</span> (1937).<br>
<br>Rhoda Power's career with the BBC began in 1927, at the time of the BBC inquiry into the value of broadcast lessons for schools, when she was asked by Mary Somerville to give six talks, &#145;Boys and girls of other days&#146;. She worked on a freelance basis until July 1937, when she was appointed as a part-time assistant and scriptwriter in the school broadcasting department. Her contribution to developing school history broadcasting was the idea of the illustrated history lesson, augmenting the talk with sound effects, music of the period, and dialogue, and introducing the dramatic interlude. While Eileen checked the programmes for historical accuracy, Rhoda did a great deal of research herself, especially for the interludes: as she pointed out, it was a struggle to keep up to date as her &#145;special subject&#146; was 4000 <span class="smallcap">BC</span> to the present day. She preferred to do the reading first, and then get her ideas for the broadcasts, and her sources included contemporary accounts wherever possible. She wanted to make history come to life, determined that it should no longer be regarded as the &#145;dry bones of the past&#146;, and she wanted to show children that history was the story of human life, and not just facts and events. She shared with Eileen a belief in the importance of teaching world history, and her <span class="roman">World History</span> series, started in 1932, was one of her most successful. She became a passionate advocate of school broadcasting, travelling round the country talking at teacher training colleges, visiting schools, talking to teachers and children. She regarded school broadcasting as a co-operative venture, working with teachers, making suggestions for how to use her lessons, wanting to relate her programmes to the work done in the classroom, to complement the work of the teacher, and not to replace it.<br>
<br>Rhoda Power became a full-time member of the school broadcasting department with the outbreak of war in 1939, and moved to Bristol with the department in 1940. As well as writing scripts for the <span class="roman">British History</span> and <span class="roman">World History</span> series, she developed <span class="italic">How Things Began</span> and <span class="italic">If You were Chinese</span>: this latter was prepared in close consultation with the Chinese community in England. She also published <span class="italic">Ten Minute Tales</span> (1943) and <span class="italic">The American Twins of the Revolution</span> (1943) in the twins series started by Lucy Fitch Perkins. By the end of the war she was exhausted&#151;she estimated that she had written 340 scripts between 1939 and 1946&#151;and she was also frustrated at the lack of time to browse and try out new ideas, feeling her technique had become stereotyped. After a year off from 1946 to 1947, travelling in South and North America, she arranged to have three months' unpaid leave every year.<br>
<br>Highly regarded by historians and educationists such as H. A. L. Fisher and R. H. Tawney for her contribution to the teaching of history, Rhoda Power was appointed MBE in 1950. Although she suffered from chronic deafness, which got worse after an unsuccessful operation in America in 1947, she continued to write scripts and develop new series, while publishing books based on her broadcasts, including <span class="italic">We Were There</span> (1955), stories told by imaginary eye-witnesses. She also contributed to children's television programmes.<br>
<br>Rhoda Power died very suddenly on 9 March 1957 at 72 Westbourne Park Road, Paddington, London. She was unmarried. She left her collection of books to the BBC's school broadcasting department, which created a Rhoda Power Library at Portland Place.<br>
