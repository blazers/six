<span class="headword">Dawes,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1793, <em>d.</em> 1867), <span class="occ">dean of Hereford and educationist</span>, was baptized on 13 April 1793 at Hawes in Yorkshire, the son of James Dawes, who farmed an estate at Hawes, and his wife, Isabella. He had at least three younger brothers. He was educated at the school of the blind Quaker mathematician John Gough at Kendal and proceeded to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was admitted as a sizar in 1813. He was made a scholar in 1816 and graduated BA as fourth wrangler in 1817, proceeding MA in 1820. From 1818 to 1836 Dawes was mathematical tutor, fellow, and bursar of the newly founded Downing College, Cambridge. He was ordained in 1818 and also held the college living of Tadlow, Cambridgeshire, from 1820 to 1840. At this time Dawes was strongly influenced by the contemporary circle of notable Cambridge scientists, including William Whewell, John Henslow, and Adam Sedgwick.<br>
<br>Dawes was a whig in politics. He believed strongly in religious toleration and supported the conscience clause to withdraw children from denominational religious instruction. In 1834 he signed the petition to parliament in favour of the admission of dissenters to the university, destroying his chances of election to the mastership of Downing, which became vacant in 1836. Despite Dawes's personal popularity as vice-master and meticulous financial management as bursar, the master of Clare College, one of the electors, protested that he would not have supported his candidature for the headship even if Dawes had been his brother  (Henry, 10).<br>
<br>Dawes left Cambridge in 1837 to accept the living of the poor rural parish of King's Somborne in Hampshire, to which he was presented by Sir John Barker Mill, bt, a former pupil. In the following year he married Mary Helen, daughter of Alexander Gordon of Logie, Aberdeenshire, and stepdaughter of the surgeon <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11786/', "George James Guthrie")</script>. In October 1842 Dawes established the King's Somborne school which soon became an exemplar of nineteenth-century elementary education. Acclaimed by inspectors of schools, notably John Allen, Henry Moseley, and Matthew Arnold, for its efficient management and radical curriculum, the school drew visits from Lord Lansdowne, president of the committee of council on education, and the prime minister, Lord John Russell. Dawes educated children from different social classes and, by charging fees according to means, the school soon became financially self-sufficient.<br>
<br>Dawes should be remembered for his seminal contribution to the development of applied science in elementary education: traditional teaching was replaced with heuristic learning and a rudimentary laboratory was established to promote the use of technical apparatus and simple scientific experiments. Priority was also given to pupils' language development through the use of secular reading material, including the increasingly popular textbooks published by the Irish national board of education. Dawes taught regularly at King's Somborne, as did Edward Frankland, from the nearby Queenwood College, who gave a course of lectures on agricultural chemistry.<br>
<br>In 1849&#150;50 Dawes published two influential pamphlets supporting Kay&#150;Shuttleworth and the committee of council in their struggle with the established church over the management of state schooling. Dawes's other publications included his pioneering manual <span class="italic">Suggestive Hints towards Improved Secular Instruction, Making it Bear upon Practical Life</span> (1849), which became a prescribed text for teacher training and ran to seven editions. His contribution to elementary education was acknowledged by election to the council of the Society of Arts in 1851. During the next nine years he was the major figure, with Henry Moseley, in the promotion of science in education and participated in the organization of the 1854 Educational Exhibition. He was also a propagandist for competitive examinations for civil service appointments. However, the Newcastle commission on popular education (1859&#150;61) failed to call Dawes as an expert witness.<br>
<br>In 1850, for his work at King's Somborne and his support for the committee of council, Russell nominated Dawes as dean of Hereford. The architect Sir Gilbert Scott was appointed by Dawes to restore the dilapidated cathedral which, under the new dean's financial management, was successfully re-opened in 1863. During this time Dawes remained actively involved in education and science, taking a close interest in the Blue Coat and Foundation schools in Hereford, and in Ledbury's national schools. He was also master of St Catherine's Hospital, Ledbury, and a local magistrate. In 1864 he was vice-president of the Bath meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.<br>
<br>Popular and approachable throughout his life, Dawes was noted at Downing for his generosity towards younger colleagues. George Eliot described his face as &#145;so intelligent and benignant that children might grow good by looking at it&#146;  (Cross, 1.281). Dawes died of paralysis at the deanery, Hereford, on 10 March 1867, and was buried in the Ladye Arbour of the cathedral. He was survived by his wife.<br>
