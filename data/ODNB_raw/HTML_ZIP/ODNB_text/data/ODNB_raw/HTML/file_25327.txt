<span class="headword">Shepesheved,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1270&#150;<em>c.</em>1325), <span class="occ">chronicler and Cistercian monk</span>, presumably took his name from Shepshed in Leicestershire. The fact that he was ordained priest on 26 February 1295 suggests that he was then at least twenty-four years old, and that he was born about 1270. His surname was that of several other monks of Croxden Abbey, Staffordshire, where William was professed on 11 September 1288, and it is likely that at least some of these, including perhaps the Richard who became abbot in 1329, were his kinsmen. But all that is known for certain of William's family is that his mother was named Millicent&#151;he records her death in 1295.<br>
<br>Shepesheved was the author of a chronicle preserved in BL, Cotton MS Faustina B.vi, folios 69&#150;94. Largely concerned with the history of his monastery, it concludes with a list of the monks, continued by later hands. But it starts in 1066, well before the foundation of Croxden in 1178, and refers throughout to events elsewhere in Britain and beyond&#151;to the doings of English kings, to the crusades, and to the succession of popes. Consisting at first of little more than a series of notes, the chronicle becomes fuller as it approaches Shepesheved's own time. Though interesting in revealing that Shepesheved's political sympathies lay with Simon de Montfort and Thomas of Lancaster, the principal value of his chronicle lies in the light it sheds on the fortunes of Croxden, on the abbots and their deeds, particularly as builders, on relations with patrons, including a serious dispute with Thomas, Lord Furnival, in 1319, and on other aspects of monastic life. In 1313, for instance, Shepesheved tells how the monastery's great bell was accidentally broken, and how a founder from Lichfield failed expensively in his efforts to cast a replacement. He was also keenly interested in weather and meteorological phenomena, noting eclipses and other celestial apparitions, and also rainstorms, floods, and droughts, with their implications for harvests. In 1299 he observes that contrary to common expectations, heavy rain on St Swithun's day was followed by a beautiful summer. In the mid-1320s what is presumably Shepesheved's own hand is increasingly superseded by another, which is also responsible for a number of insertions on earlier folios. But although it may be assumed that Shepesheved died at about this time, the date is not recorded. Brief extracts from his chronicle were published by Dugdale in his <span class="italic">Monasticon Anglicanum</span>, more extensive ones by Frederic Madden in 1835.<br>
