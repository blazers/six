<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lyon,  Hart</span> <span class="st"> [Hirsch Lewin or Loebel]</span>  (1721&#150;1800), <span class="occ">rabbi</span>, was born in Rzeszow, Poland, the son of Rabbi Aryeh Loeb ben Saul (1690&#150;1755), a man of distinguished rabbinical lineage who was sometimes known by the surname Loewenstamm, and his wife, Miriam (<i>d</i>. 1753), daughter of Rabbi Zevi Hirsch ben Jacob, surnamed Ashkenazi (1660&#150;1718). The latter, known as Hakham (&#145;Sage&#146;) Zevi, was a renowned authority on Jewish law who, as rabbi of Altona and later of Amsterdam, was consulted by the Great Synagogue in Duke's Place, London, on controversial points during its formative years and visited London in 1714. Having attended a <i>yeshivah</i> (rabbinical academy) between about 1736 and 1745 in Glogau, where his father had been rabbi before moving to Amsterdam, Hirsch Loebel (as he was then called) devoted himself to the full-time study of traditional Jewish texts and, unusually for the time, Hebrew grammar. In 1751, when the celebrated theological dispute between Jacob Emden and Jonathan Eybesch&uuml;tz had begun, he issued a pamphlet supporting the position of Emden, who was Hakham Zevi's son.<br>
<br>Hirsch Loebel's reputation as a Talmudist, together with the congregation's well-remembered association with his much respected grandfather, persuaded the Great Synagogue in 1756 to appoint him to its pulpit following the death in office of Rabbi Aaron Hart. He assumed his duties early in 1757, and while serving the congregation was known as Hart Lyon, the literal translations of his forename and patronymic. His appointment heralded a period of co-operation between London's two Ashkenazi congregations, for the Hambro Synagogue agreed to pay &pound;100 of his annual salary of &pound;250 and looked to him for guidance on matters affected by Jewish law. Similarly, a group of Jews who&#151;to the consternation of the Great Synagogue authorities&#151;founded a third Ashkenazi congregation in the capital in 1761, recognized Lyon's authority on such issues, and sought his approval of the man they chose to be their rabbi. Lyon thus enjoyed a status which foreshadowed the position of chief rabbi, created later in the century.<br>
<br>However, Lyon was deeply unhappy with the state of Jewish observance and education in London and with British Jewry's acculturationist impulse. In sermon after sermon, often characterized by some ninety minutes' discussion of the <span class="roman">Talmud</span> augmented by a homily of comparable duration, he admonished his congregants for their religious laxity and eagerness to imitate the habits and fashions of gentile society. Tensions between Lyon and the Great Synagogue's lay leaders were perhaps evident in their extraordinary denial of his request to be allowed publicly to refute allegations made by Jacob Kimchi, a pious Jewish peddler from Turkey. In a pamphlet published at Altona in 1760 Kimchi accused the officials who, under Lyon's jurisdiction, supervised ritual slaughtering arrangements in London, of disregarding the letter of Jewish law. The Great Synagogue's decision rankled, and, frustrated by his congregants' indifference towards Jewish learning, Lyon set up a continental-style <i>bet midrash</i> (house of study) in his home and spent an increasing amount of his time there. His accomplishments as a scholar were better appreciated on the continent, and he possibly regretted taking the London offer in preference to a slightly earlier one from Dubno in Poland.<br>
<br>In 1763, thoroughly disillusioned with London Jewry, Lyon accepted a call to be rabbi of Halberstadt, and left the Great Synagogue in the spring of the following year. Lyon's cousin, Israel Meshullam Zalman Emden, hoped to succeed him, but had to be satisfied instead with the pulpit of the Hambro Synagogue, where he was called Meshullam Solomon. In 1770 Lyon, known as Hirsch Lewin, became rabbi of Mannheim, and in 1773 of Berlin, where he remained for the rest of his life. Although opposed to the more extreme manifestations of Jewish enlightenment thought which were circulating among Berlin's Jews, he collaborated with Moses Mendelssohn in preparing a book on aspects of Jewish law which appeared in 1778 as <span class="italic">Ritualgesetze der Juden</span>. His commentary on the classic Jewish text <span class="italic">Pirke Avot</span> (&#145;Chapters of the fathers&#146;) was published posthumously in 1834. He also wrote Hebrew poems, some of which were printed.<br>
<br>Lyon and his wife, Golde (<i>fl</i>. 1720&#150;1800), daughter of David Tevele Cohen, a leader of the Jewish community in Glogau, had six children: the controversial scholar Rabbi Saul Berliner, who died in London on 19 June 1790 after fleeing Berlin accused of forging rabbinical texts; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13363/', "Chief Rabbi Solomon Hirschell")</script>; Abraham David Tevele Berliner, a merchant; and daughters Sarah, Reisel, and Beilah, whose knowledge of the <span class="roman">Talmud</span> and attainments in Hebrew testify to her father's enlightened attitude towards the religious education of girls. Lyon died in Berlin in 1800 and was buried there.<br>
<br>During his ministry at the Great Synagogue Lyon sat for his portrait in oils by James Turner; it was subsequently engraved by Edward Fisher and sold as a print at Cornhill under the title <span class="italic">The most Learned High Priest Hart Lyon, Rabbi London</span>. The department of prints and drawings at the British Museum has an impression of Fisher's mezzotint, but Turner's painting, which used to hang in the Great Synagogue, is believed to have been destroyed in the blitz.<br>
