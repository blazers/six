<span class="headword">Latham,  John</span>  (1740&#150;1837), <span class="occ">naturalist</span>, was born on 27 June 1740 at Eltham, Kent, the eldest son of John Latham (<i>d</i>. 1788), a surgeon and apothecary. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London, until the age of fifteen. He attended the London Hospital medical school, and studied anatomy under William Hunter (1718&#150;1783). In 1763 he moved to Dartford, in Kent, where he began practising medicine, probably from a Spital Street address. In the same year, he married Ann Porter, with whom he had at least one son, John (1769&#150;1843), and three daughters, including Ann (<i>b</i>. 1772). Latham practised medicine in Dartford for some thirty-five years, and served as doctor to the Dartford poorhouse on a number of occasions.<br>
<br>Once established in medical practice, Latham could begin to spend more time pursuing his interests in natural history. Ornithology and comparative anatomy were his favourite subjects (although he was also interested in archaeology). He assembled a fine collection of birds and established a museum which attracted many visitors and was of great use to fellow naturalists and artists. In 1770 his first published work appeared in the Royal Society's <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>. As early as 1771 Latham entered into correspondence with the ornithologist Thomas Pennant (1726&#150;1798), which lasted until the latter's death. Latham also corresponded with most of the important naturalists of his time. As a result, he had access to the major collections in the country and, in time, he became an important member of the scientific community, and the leading English ornithologist of his day. In 1772 he met the natural history collector Sir Ashton Lever (1729&#150;1788); the two men subsequently entered into friendly competition over their collections of specimens. In 1773 Latham discovered the Dartford warbler. In 1788 Lever was forced to sell part of his collections by lottery, and when in 1806, Lever's museum was sold, Latham was able to acquire some specimens for his own collection.<br>
<br>Latham's works depended heavily on personal observation of the collections of specimens accessible to him; his connections were such that he was in an excellent position to study both native and foreign birds. His works featured a large number of exotic birds from all over the world, including specimens from India, Australia, and the Pacific. On 25 May 1775 Latham was elected FRS, at which time Sir Joseph Banks (1743&#150;1820), was president of the society. Banks provided Latham with a further supply of specimens and material, indeed some of the collection housed at the Royal Society's museum was gathered during Banks's voyage with Captain James Cook (1728&#150;1779). Banks also allowed Latham access to the various paintings made during the Cook voyages (1768&#150;71, 1772&#150;5, 1776&#150;80). Moreover, Latham was often given the first opportunity to view new specimens and information. His sources included the Indian bird material in the collections of Major-General Thomas Hardwicke, Lady Mary Impey (<i>d</i>. 1818), and Sir John Anstruther (1753&#150;1811); specimens from Barbados were also sent by the earl of Seaforth, and Abyssinian birds were presented to him by the collector Henry Salt (1780&#150;1827); and he made use of illustrations of Australian birds in the &#145;Lambert drawings&#146; acquired by Aylmer Bourke Lambert (1761&#150;1842), from Surgeon-General John White (1756&#150;1832), and the notes made by the botanist Daniel Solander (1733&#150;1782) and (Johann) Reinhold Forster (1729&#150;1798) on Cook's voyages. It is not surprising, therefore, that he became known as the &#145;grandfather&#146; of Australian ornithology, since he was the first to describe and classify a number of Australian birds, including the emu.<br>
<br>In 1778 Latham became a corresponding member of the Medical Society of London. It has been suggested that about 1788 or 1789, through his association either with the botanist James Edward Smith (1759&#150;1828), who had purchased Linnaeus's library, or with Banks, Latham proposed the founding of the Linnean Society of London. In 1793 he was elected FSA and in 1794 was nominated a member of the Natural History Society of Berlin. In 1795 he received the degree of MD from the University of Erlangen in Germany and in 1812 received the diploma of the Royal Academy of Sciences, Stockholm. In 1796, having amassed a considerable fortune, he retired from practice and settled in a large house in Middlebridge Street, Romsey, to be near his son, John, a common brewer (and JP). In 1798 Latham married his second wife, Ann Delamott, of Ealing.<br>
<br>During the period 1780&#150;90, Latham's objective appears to have been the publication of a complete work of all known bird species, including an update of existing ornithological knowledge and a consideration of all new information as it occurred. In his work, he generally adopted a classification system dependent on &#145;Ray for his basic divisions and on Linnaeus for lower divisions&#146;. His published works included <span class="italic">A General Synopsis of Birds</span> (1781&#150;5), containing many new genera and species, which was followed by supplements in 1787 and 1801. In this and future works Latham, like many of his peers, drew, etched, and coloured his own plates. In the preface he wrote:<blockquote>The intent of the following sheets is to give, as far as may be, a concise account of all the Birds hitherto known; nothing having been done in this way, as a general work, in the English Language, of late years.</blockquote>By publishing this work in English, rather than Latin, he provided Johann Friedrich Gmelin with the opportunity to take the credit for translating his work and allocating scientific names to his specimens.<br>
<br>Latham did not repeat this oversight in his next major work, <span class="italic">Index ornithologicus, sive, Systema ornithologiae</span>, which attempted to describe the known birds of his time and their habitats. This work was issued in parts between 1790 and 1801, no doubt owing to the countless new specimens that were appearing (especially from Australia and the Pacific islands). The projected second edition to his <span class="italic">Index ornithologicus</span> never materialized, probably because of the increasing volume of new material. However, the work was reissued, with additions, in Paris in 1809.<br>
<br>Besides papers in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> and the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Linnean Society</span>, Latham (helped by his daughter Ann) contributed the descriptions of a number of new birds in <span class="italic">The Voyage of Governor Philip to Botany Bay</span> (1789). He also helped to revise the part on insects for the second edition of Thomas Pennant's <span class="italic">Indian Zoology</span> in 1793. Two years later, Latham's contribution on the subject reappeared in <span class="italic">Faunula Indica, concinnata a Joanne Latham et Hugone Davies</span>, which was edited by Reinhold Forster in 1795. In 1811 Latham's revision of Pennant's <span class="italic">British Zoology</span> was published. From 1796 to 1819, while living at Romsey, he became interested in local antiquities, and wrote accounts of &#145;Ancient sculptures in the abbey church of Romsey&#146; in <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> (vol. 14, 1801) and of an engraved brass plate from Netley Abbey, which also appeared in <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> (vol. 15, 1804).<br>
<br>In 1809 Latham had mentioned to Colonel George Montagu the possibility of a second edition of his <span class="italic">General Synopsis of Birds</span>, and in 1821 he embarked on this task. The enlargement of his earlier work appeared in ten volumes between 1821 and 1828, under the title <span class="italic">A General History of Birds</span>, and incorporated new information and both new and improved illustrations (designed, etched, and coloured by himself); it was dedicated to George IV, and considered his greatest work.<br>
<br>Pecuniary losses in Latham's old age forced him to sell a great part of his library and museum&#151;in 1819 his son John became bankrupt and Latham endeavoured to help cover his son's debts by selling his own possessions. In the same year Latham moved to Winchester, to live with his daughter and her husband, William N. Wickham, a surgeon. In the autumn of 1836 Lord Palmerston visited Latham (then ninety-six), and described him as &#145;well, hearty, and cheerful, eating a good dinner at five&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), but adds that he could no longer see to read. The ornithologist Alfred Newton (1829&#150;1907) remarked of Latham that &#145;his defects as a compiler, which had been manifest before, rather increased with age, and the consequences were not happy&#146;  (ibid.). While there is a consensus of opinion that Latham was essentially a compiler whose work was not always of a high standard, his industry won him an international reputation and he dominated his field for fifty years. He died on 4 February 1837 at Winchester and was buried in Romsey Abbey, beside his first wife.<br>
