<span class="headword">Jones,  Edmund</span>  (1702&#150;1793), <span class="occ">Independent minister and author</span>, was born on 1 April 1702 in the parish of Aberystruth, Monmouthshire. His parents, John Lewis and his wife, Catherine Morgan, of Penllwyn, were of dissenting stock, and their son, who was largely self-taught, earned a reputation during his long life as being more Calvinist than Calvin himself. He began preaching as early as 1722 and was ordained at Pen-maen meeting-house in 1734. When his hopes of becoming minister at Pen-maen were dashed in 1740 he moved to Pontypool, where he contributed &pound;30 to the building of a meeting-house at the Transh in 1741. For more than fifty years this pious, modest, and transparently honest man eked out a bare living as an Independent minister, but did more than anyone to ensure that dissent became a living force in south-east Wales.<br>
<br>Shortly before his death in 1793, Jones had embarked on an autobiography which promised to document &#145;what occurrences &amp; strange events came to pass in my long life&#146;  (Nuttall, 26), but since this work was neither completed nor published we must rely on his unpublished diaries, sermons, and letters, as well as his printed works, for details of his career. He was clearly a local patriot. His <span class="italic">A Geographical, Historical, and Religious Account of the Parish of Aberystruth</span> (1779) reveals that he was acutely interested in topography, soil, climate, demography, and &#145;natural curiosities&#146;, and that his depth of local knowledge was a source of wonder in the parish. His knowledge of herbs, plants, and flowers was unrivalled, and an unpublished manuscript entitled &#145;A spiritual botanology showing what of God appears in the herbs of the earth&#146; is eloquent testimony to his belief that God was at work in the natural world.<br>
<br>Edmund Jones was also known locally as yr Hen Broffwyd (the Old Prophet). His powers of prognostication were legendary and, as his <span class="italic">A Relation of Apparitions of Spirits in the Principality of Wales</span> (1780) indicates, he was vividly conscious of&#151;and troubled by&#151;the presence of spirits, ghosts, elves, goblins, and fairies in the world around him. Fired by the same motives that had inspired similar works by Joseph Glanvill and Richard Baxter, Jones despised those &#145;Sons of Infidelity&#146; who spoke with &#145;levity and ridicule of Apparitions, as if they were the posterity and Scholars of the ancient Sadducees&#146;  (<span class="italic">Account</span>, 68) and remained convinced that the Devil sent evil spirits to ensnare the innocent and the godly. Jones's fund of ghost stories and prophetic utterances became embedded in oral tradition and prompted some nineteenth-century commentators to refer to him rather unkindly as &#145;Edmund Jones of Ghostly memory&#146;.<br>
<br>Even though he was in many ways a na&iuml;ve and credulous man, paradoxically Edmund Jones was also thoroughly versed in Calvinist theology and was the nearest thing to a bishop in Welsh Independent circles in the eighteenth century. A compulsive reader, he spent what little money he possessed on the sermons of seventeenth-century puritans, whose works he copiously annotated with pungent references to &#145;blind malignant royalists&#146;. He abhorred the new spirit of critical enquiry fostered in the Welsh academies, notably at Carmarthen, and loudly denounced the &#145;blasphemous&#146; tenets of Arminians, Arians, and deists. In order to strengthen the Calvinist tradition he was willing to travel long distances to preach the gospel. As late as 1789, when he was eighty-seven years old, he preached on no fewer than 405 occasions in various parts of Wales, and when he died four years later he proudly declared that he had served as &#145;a soldier against the spirit of error in this country&#146;  (Nuttall, 27). Even Baptists, in his view, were enemies of God, and his diaries are peppered with earnest prayers such as &#145;Lord, prosper not Anabaptism, but let it wither daily&#146;  (NL Wales, MS 7026A, fol. 117).<br>
<br>Although Jones's published sermons, notably <span class="italic">Two sermons, first shewing the misery of those who are without the light of Christ; second shewing the felicity of being in the state of the light of grace</span> (1776), are prosaic, plodding texts, his services were reputedly as warm and animated as any conducted by revivalist preachers. Like several dissenting colleagues in the late 1730s, Jones caught the revivalist fever and began to follow what he called &#145;the Methodist way&#146;. Captivated by the enthusiasm and energy of the Welsh revivalist Howel Harris, he invited him to Monmouthshire and accompanied him on his preaching tours in the spring of 1738. Although his relations with Harris were subsequently riven with friction, Jones continued to take young Methodists under his wing, to introduce them to potential converts, and to preach regularly at Trevecca College, often in the company of the countess of Huntingdon, one of his greatest admirers. His principal concern, however, was to protect the dissenting inheritance and to strengthen the position and authority of the faith of his forefathers. He rightly chided William Williams (Pantycelyn) for claiming that &#145;neither priest nor Presbyter were awake&#146; when the Methodist trumpet first rang out  (NL Wales, MS 7027A).<br>
<br>Edmund Jones and his &#145;beloved spouse&#146; Mary (who predeceased him on 1 August 1770) lived in poverty, largely because Jones was generous to a fault. It was not uncommon for him to hand over his overcoat and shirt to penurious people. His favourite motto was &#145;Jehova Jireh&#146; (&#145;The Lord will provide&#146;) and on his preaching tours householders who were aware of his selfless labours and charitable disposition plied him with shirts, handkerchiefs, wool, bags of wheat, and money to buy books. Jones died, aged ninety-one, on 26 November 1793 in Pontnewynydd, where he was buried in the graveyard of Ebenezer Chapel. When a memorial was raised to &#145;Prophet Jones&#146; in 1907, a host of traditions still circulated in the locality regarding his prophecies, peculiarities, ministerial labours, and boundless generosity. Regrettably, however, he has been poorly served by twentieth-century historians.<br>
