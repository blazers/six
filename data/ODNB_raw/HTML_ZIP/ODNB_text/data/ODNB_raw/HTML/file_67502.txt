<span class="headword">Mackintosh,  Lauchlan <span class="st"> [Lachlan]</span>, of Torcastle</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1639, <em>d.</em> 1704), <span class="occ">chief of clan Mackintosh and captain of clan Chattan</span>, was baptized on 17 October 1639 in Inverness, the son of William Mackintosh (<i>d</i>. 1660), chief of the Mackintoshes and captain of clan Chattan, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1674), eldest daughter of David Graham, laird of Fintray. After attending schools in Inverness and Elgin, he studied philosophy for two years at King's College, Aberdeen, and later at St Leonard's College, St Andrews. Shortly after the death of his father on 22 November 1660 he succeeded as chief.<br>
<br>Mackintosh's chiefship saw the cessation of a 300-year-old feud between the Mackintoshes and clan Chattan and the clan Cameron over the lands of Glenlui and Locharkaig in Lochaber, to which the Camerons claimed a right through highland custom and the Mackintoshes claimed a right through law. A reconciliation finally occurred in 1665. Mackintosh also had to deal with the reassertion of independence by the Macphersons in 1664. He tried to dispel this with a renewal of the 1609 bond of union, but while most of the leading men of the clan signed, Andrew Macpherson of Cluny, head of that family, did not. Macpherson determination to break away from the Mackintosh chief was realized when in 1672 Duncan, who had succeeded Andrew, applied for a coat of arms for the name of Macpherson, distinct from that of Mackintosh. However, a compromise was reached with the help of Lauchlan Mackintosh of Kinrara, uncle of the chief, and it was decided that Duncan was responsible for those of his name, but &#145;[without] prejudice always to the Laird of M'Intosh &hellip; who are his vassals&#146;  (<span class="italic">Loyall Dissuasive and other Papers</span>, 56&#150;7). The chief's authority in the locality was upheld against the marquess of Huntly, whose lands in Lochaber were under the Mackintoshes' stewardry, and who, jealous of Mackintosh's legal right to hold courts, tried with the earl of Moray to prevent him from fulfilling his duties. Mackintosh, however, held court throughout Lochaber, and was granted further powers to deal with lawless elements as he wished.<br>
<br>On 23 July 1667 Mackintosh married Magdalene (or Margaret), only daughter of John Lindsay of Edzell, with whom he had a son, Lauchlan. Some months after her death he married, on 25 August 1677, Anne, daughter of Sir George Munro of Culrain and widow of Donald, master of Reay, with whom he had a daughter, Christian, who later married David Dunbar of Dunphail. In 1702, for reasons of old age, he transferred the clan estate to his son, Lauchlan. He died two years later, at Dalcross Castle, on 9 December 1704, and was buried at Petty after having lain in state until mid-January.<br>
