<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Simeon,  Charles</span>  (1759&#150;1836), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 24 September 1759 at Reading, the fourth son of Richard Simeon (<i>d</i>. 1784), attorney and son and grandson of successive vicars of Bucklebury, Berkshire, and his wife, Elizabeth Hutton. His mother came from the same family as two archbishops of York, one in the sixteenth century, the other in the eighteenth. His elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25560/', "Sir John Simeon, first baronet (1755/6&#150;1824)")</script>. Simeon went to Eton College in 1766, where his ugliness gained him the nickname of &#145;Chin Simeon&#146;. Looking back on his school-days there, he said that he found no inspiration from its low religious standard: the emphasis was placed on the study of the classical authors, and the scriptures were neglected. He was noted for his extravagant dress and able horsemanship, though at the same time his companions thought him unusually religious, particularly when he observed a national day of fasting and prayer, which had been called during the American War of Independence, by shutting himself up in his study and eating only a single hard-boiled egg at dinner.<h2>
<a name="Conversion"></a>Conversion</h2>Simeon went as a scholar on 29 January 1779 to King's College, Cambridge, where four days after his arrival an incident occurred that changed his whole life. The provost of the college announced that all its members would be required to participate in the mid-term celebration of holy communion in the chapel. Simeon anxiously doubted his spiritual fitness to do this. During some three months of great uneasiness he read the only devotional manual known to him, <span class="italic">The Whole Duty of Man</span>, which brought him no help. Then he turned, as likely to be more relevant to him in his situation, to <span class="italic">A Short and Plain Instruction for the Better Understanding of the Lord's Supper</span> (1733) by Bishop Thomas Wilson, who wished the sacrament to have a more important part in Anglican worship; and he found a sentence in this which relieved his sense of guilt: &#145;The Jews knew what they did when they transferred their sin to the head of their offering&#146;  (Carus, 9). These words aroused in him the belief that he could gain salvation by transferring away his sins to &#145;the sacred head of Jesus&#146;  (ibid.). He went to communion on Easter day and recorded, &#145;At the Lord's table in our chapel I had the sweetest access to God through my blessed Saviour&#146;  (ibid.), though he considered the service in the chapel &#145;very irreverently performed&#146;  (ibid., 10).<br>
<br>The result of this conversion was to make Simeon a devoted, practising Christian, which he remained, though this was at first seriously interrupted by a bout of drunkenness, for the rest of his life. He endeavoured to influence his university friends and during the long vacation instructed the servants at home and introduced morning and evening family prayers. He now looked forward to obtaining holy orders. In January 1782 he succeeded as an Etonian to a King's College fellowship and on that title was ordained deacon by the bishop of Ely on 26 May 1782, though he was still under the canonical age and did not graduate BA until January 1783. He was ordained priest by the bishop of Peterborough on 28 September 1783.<br>
<br>Simeon had been brought up as a high-churchman, and at first he felt an affinity with high-churchmen such as Thomas Wilson, but he soon came under the influence of the evangelical movement. Since the evangelicals were still in a minority in the Church of England, they tended to gather in groups in a certain few centres of the kingdom, and one of these was Cambridge. An evangelical clergyman there was Christopher Atkinson, vicar of St Edward's Church, and Simeon began his ministry by taking duty for him during the long vacation. Atkinson introduced him to others of that persuasion, including John Venn, rector of Clapham, who put him in touch with the outstanding members of that other concentration of evangelicalism there. John Venn also introduced Simeon to his father, Henry Venn, rector of Yelling, some 15 miles from Cambridge, who had a decisive influence upon him. Henceforward he found their outlook congenial, though he called himself &#145;a moderate Calvinist&#146;  (Carus, 418).<h2>
<a name="EarlyministryinCambridge"></a>Early ministry in Cambridge</h2>In 1782 the vicar of Holy Trinity Church, Cambridge, died. The church's size and position made Simeon wish &#145;I might preach the Gospel there and be a herald for Him in the University&#146;  (Elliott-Binns, 285). He persuaded his father to induce the bishop of Ely to appoint him there, but the parishioners wanted to have their afternoon lecturer as their incumbent, and Simeon was not popular as an evangelical. The seat-holders left the church, locking the doors of their pews to prevent anyone else using them. When Simeon placed benches in the aisles, the churchwardens threw them out into the churchyard, and for more than the first ten years of his ministry the congregation had to stand.<br>
<br>In addition, Simeon's reputation for piety made him unpopular with many of the undergraduates. They interrupted his sermons, sought to break up the services, and roughly treated people leaving the church. He restored order in the church by appointing watchers to stand in the aisles, and when the service was ended he went immediately to stand at the north door to confront his opponents. On weekdays he met with shouts of derision in the streets, and so did his curates, even though some of them, such as James Scholefield, were known for their academic distinction in the university  (Scholefield, 27). Nevertheless he persevered, steadily gaining support, and had a ministry of fifty-four years there.<br>
<br>Simeon achieved this despite &#145;an infirmity of temper&#146; described by Charles Jerram, a fellow evangelical divine: &#145;He was naturally of a haughty, impatient and impetuous temper, and these defects were sometimes exhibited in a way which was painful to the feelings of others&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs &hellip; of the late Rev. Charles Jerram</span>, 124). Simeon was aware of his weaknesses of character and constantly struggled against them, seeking to acquire humility and spiritual discipline. Throughout the year he rose at four o'clock in the morning to give himself to private prayer, self-examination, and devotional <span class="roman">Bible</span> reading until he called his servant at eight o'clock to join with him in praying together. As he grew older, it was notable that his character considerably mellowed, and fewer people were offended by his approach to them.<br>
<br>Simeon's access to members of the university was helped by his official position in his college; he was thrice one of its deans, second bursar from 1798 to 1805, and vice-provost from 1790 to 1792, the duties of all of which posts he performed conscientiously. Apart from his benevolent care for the afflicted during the corn famine of 1788, when he organized a subscription to enable bread to be sold at half-price in Cambridge and twenty-four neighbouring villages and rode round on horseback each Monday to make sure that the bakers were doing this, the long period of his incumbency was singularly unmarked by notable incidents, but he was an assiduous, many-sided pastor. George Corrie, later master of Jesus College, was told, when going up to Cambridge, that Simeon was seen &#145;either in the stable with his horses or by the sick bed of his parishioners&#146;  (Moule, 55).<h2>
<a name="Preacherofthegospel"></a>Preacher of the gospel</h2>Simeon did his best to make use of the opportunity to preach which he had foreseen Holy Trinity Church would give him. Like other evangelical preachers, he broke away from the ethical sermons of Archbishop John Tillotson, which had dominated eighteenth-century preaching, and proclaimed the symbol of the cross as the supreme expression of the love of God for sinners through which they might enter into the new life of the spirit. While his emphasis was on the salvation of individual souls, he insisted also that those who accepted the faith &#145;became a member of Christ's mystical body&#146;, the church  (Simeon, <span class="italic">Horae</span>, sermon 183).<br>
<br>Like the evangelicals also, Simeon was concerned with the technique of preaching. He particularly set out to achieve a planned framework for his sermons. &#145;I have been preaching for forty-five years,&#146; he said in 1827, &#145;but for the first seven of those years I did not know the head from the tail of a sermon.&#146; He preached &#145;usually to the small door in the west gallery of Trinity Church&#146;  (Brown, 178), because, &#145;When I perceive that the door distinctly hears me, then I know that all the congregation may&#146;  (ibid., 186). The effect of his sermons was increased rather than diminished by certain peculiarities of phrase and style. A common gesture in the pulpit looked as if he were catching a fly between his thumb and forefinger. He preached from notes and after each service wrote out more fully the chief headings and subject matter of the sermon. These substantially formed twenty-one volumes of the 2536 sermon outlines of his <span class="italic">Horae homilecticae, or, Discourses digested into one continued series, and forming a commentary upon every book of the Old and New Testament</span> (1819&#150;28), with his &#145;Essay on the composition of a sermon&#146;, translated from the work by the Huguenot Jean Claude.<br>
<br>Simeon's preaching increasingly attracted more and more of the once generally hostile undergraduates to his church. He wrote on a Sunday in 1818:<blockquote>As for the gownsmen, never was anything like what they are at this day. I am forced to let them go up into the galleries which I never suffered before; and notwithstanding that, multitudes of them are forced to stand in the aisles for want of a place to sit down. (Carus, 496)</blockquote>Simeon regretted the lack of specialized, professional training provided by the Church of England to candidates for the ministry; and he was a pioneer in undertaking this in his rooms in King's College. In 1790 he started fortnightly sermon classes in term-time for ordinands, at first on Sunday evenings and later on Fridays. Each class lasted for an hour. He gave instruction in sermon composition, voice production, reading, and delivery from the pulpit, with such advice as &#145;A sermon should be like a telescope: each successive division of it should be as an additional lens to bring the subject of your text nearer and make it more distinct&#146; and &#145;Form your voice not in your chest, not in your throat, not in the roof of your mouth, but simply with your lips and teeth&#146;  (Brown, 183, 187). In addition, the class was given a text upon which each man during the coming fortnight wrote a sermon outline to be read at the next meeting and criticized by Simeon.<h2>
<a name="Conversationparties"></a>Conversation parties</h2>In 1812 Simeon started as well his weekly conversation parties, which were also held in his rooms on Friday evenings. After two waiters had handed tea round to those present, he sat on a high mahogany stool with his small old quarto <span class="roman">Bible</span> beside him and said, &#145;Now, if any of you have any question to ask, I shall be happy to hear it and to give what assistance I can.&#146; The questions asked covered a variety of subjects, from meditation and Christian living to slavery and national education. He earnestly explained the religious implications of such matters, but promptly rebuked flippant or foolish questions  (Carus, 648&#150;54). There were many ordinands among those who attended these parties, but there were also others who were to attain such positions in society as lawyers, politicians, soldiers, and landed gentlemen. And Henry Kirke White, the poet, was among those he helped.<br>
<br>Lord Macaulay, remembering the time when he was at Cambridge, wrote in 1844:<blockquote>As to Simeon, if you knew what his authority and interest were, and how they extended from Cambridge to the most remote corners of England, you would allow that his real sway in the Church was far greater than that of any primate. (Trevelyan, 1.67)</blockquote>Simeon's ministry, preaching, and particularly his classes and parties did indeed gain him the support of innumerable members of the university who later widely upheld his beliefs and spread his message. Although, like the nonconformists, the evangelicals regarded the church as an invisible communion in which all believers had their proper place and function irrespective of ecclesiastical organization, he always took care to make it clear to them that he was a firm Anglican, saying, &#145;The <span class="roman">Bible</span> first, the prayer book next and all other books and doings in subordination to both&#146;  (Carus, 12), so retaining many, both clergymen and laymen, as upholders of the evangelical party within the church at a time when Methodism flourished. Bishop Charles Wordsworth, who knew Oxford during the early days of Tractarianism, made this comparison with the then preacher at its university church, when he said that Simeon &#145;had a large following of young men&#151;larger and not less devoted than that which followed Newman&#151;and for a much longer time&#146;  (Wordsworth, 335).<br>
<br>Simeon further strengthened the position of evangelicalism in the church through the purchase of advowsons. By English law advowsons were regarded as a right of property which could be transferred by gift or (until 1924) by sale. In 1813 John Thornton of Clapham died, leaving the patronage of ten livings, which his wealth had enabled him to acquire, to trustees. Simeon became one of these, and they developed into the Simeon trustees. He used a legacy left to him in 1800, together with substantial gifts from sympathizers, to purchase further advowsons for the trustees. These included fashionable watering-places such as Cheltenham, Bath, and Bridlington, and industrial centres such as Northampton, Birmingham, and Bradford. A great opportunity came to him with the passing of the <span class="roman">Municipal Corporations Act</span> of 1835, which compelled the corporations to dispose of livings in their gift. By the time of his death the trust possessed twenty-one livings, a number which increased to 150 during the next century.<h2>
<a name="Influenceonmissionarysocieties"></a>Influence on missionary societies</h2>Simeon's influence extended not only further than Cambridge but also beyond Britain itself. He was among the founders of the Church Missionary Society in 1797 and actively supported the British and Foreign Bible Society, the Religious Tract Society, the Colonial and Continental Church Society, and the Church Mission to the Jews. His association with these societies showed his willingness to co-operate with both Anglicans of varying churchmanship and nonconformists.<br>
<br>Simeon himself was mainly concerned with missionary work in India, where his interest was aroused by a memorial in 1788 from Charles Grant and other wealthy merchants in the East India Company advocating missionary and educational work there. When Grant became chairman of the court of directors of the company in 1805, he was able, though missionaries were forbidden to go to India, to enable Simeon to secure the appointment of chaplains employed by the company there, who were evangelists among the natives as well. Among these were several of his curates, notably Henry Martyn.<br>
<br>In the last part of his life Simeon, having contributed greatly to the evangelical revival, and despite the widely disseminated effect of his ministry, still valued his fellowship of King's College. He died, unmarried, at King's College, Cambridge, on 13 November 1836 and was buried six days later, at his wish, in its chapel.<br>
