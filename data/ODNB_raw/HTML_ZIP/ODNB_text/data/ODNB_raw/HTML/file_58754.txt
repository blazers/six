<span class="headword">Chamberlen family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1600&#150;<em>c.</em>1730), <span class="occ">medical practitioners</span>, practised medicine and midwifery in London during the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Some were barber&#150;surgeons, others physicians, and one&#151;Paul&#151;advertised as a vendor of an &#145;anodyne necklace&#146; effective in labour. Connections to apothecaries existed through marriage, giving the family access to a further body of medical knowledge. Unusually for this period, the Chamberlens were often referred to by contemporaries as &#145;men-midwives&#146;; several family members tried to extend their control over the London midwives, while challenging the established boundaries between the sphere of the surgeon and that of the physician.<br>
<br>The family originated in France, and may have sheltered in the Dutch republic before settling in England. William Chamberlen arrived at Southampton on 3 July 1569 with his wife, Genevieve (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Vingnon), and three children: Peter the elder, Simon, and Jane. A third son, James, was baptized on 26 July 1569; Peter the younger was born in 1572. William is assumed to have been a surgeon or apothecary; both Peters became barber&#150;surgeons. William died before March 1596, and it appears that most of the family moved to London at some time between 1588 and this date.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_5066"></a><span class="headword">Peter Chamberlen the elder</span>  (<em>c.</em>1560&#150;1631)<span class="occ"></span> appears to have stayed in Southampton with his wife, Anne, until the death of his father, being admitted to the Barber&#150;Surgeons' Company only in 1598. In London he was based in Mark Lane, and attended the queens of James I and Charles I. The first evidence of his reluctance to restrict his activities to surgery was in December 1609, when the College of Physicians summoned him to appear before the president and censors. He failed to attend, and was later fined 40<i>s</i>., which was halved at appeal in March 1610. In November 1612 he was again fined by the College of Physicians for usurping the role of a physician. Imprisoned in Newgate, he was released only after the intervention of the archbishop of Canterbury and the lord mayor, who may have been influenced by Thomas Chamberlen, Peter's cousin and the master of the Mercers' Company. He was listed in 1614 as a surgeon to Queen Anne; his will mentions a diamond ring which she gave him. He was the sole attendant to Henrietta Maria when she miscarried at Greenwich in 1628, and was present at the birth of the future Charles II in 1630, although this was managed by the French midwife Mme P&eacute;ronne. He died in December 1631 and was buried in St Dionis Backchurch; at this time he seems to have been living mainly in Downe, Kent, where he owned land, and where his brother Simon also resided. His wife, Anne, predeceased him; his only child was a daughter, Esther.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_5065"></a><span class="headword">Peter Chamberlen the younger</span>  (1572&#150;1626)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 15 February 1572 in Southampton and also a member of the Barber&#150;Surgeons, shared his brother's interest in midwifery. In 1616 the brothers responded to a petition from the London midwives to form a college; in supporting this unsuccessful request, the Chamberlens stated that they both practised midwifery, although only Peter the younger appears to have held a licence from the bishop of London. Peter the younger shared his brother's disregard for the boundaries between surgical and medical practice, and also fell out with his fellow surgeons. When accused by the College of Physicians, in 1600, of treating syphilis by diet and purging, he confessed, but he was also fined by the Barber&#150;Surgeons' Company for absence from lectures on a number of occasions between 1602 and 1606. He married Sara Delaune, the daughter of a French protestant minister and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7449/', "Gideon Delaune")</script>, the royal apothecary. In 1607 Peter was accused of prescribing medicines to three patients; in his defence, he claimed that he was following the advice of his father-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7452/', "William Delaune")</script>, who was also licensed by the College of Physicians. He began the procedure of being examined for the college in 1610, but proceeded no further, and was threatened with imprisonment by the college in 1620 after altering a prescription written by Dr Argent. He died after 12 August 1626 and was buried at Downe on 16 August.<br>
<br>Peter the younger had eight children: Peter, Sarah, William, Ann, Henry, Robert, Nathaniel, and Marguerite. Of these <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5067/', "Peter Chamberlen (1601&#150;1683)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52286/', "Nathaniel Chamberlain (bap. 1612)")</script> were physicians. Peter was usually known as Dr Peter not only to distinguish him from his father and uncle of the same name, but also to emphasize that he was qualified as a doctor of medicine rather than as a barber&#150;surgeon. In the 1630s he too tried to organize the London midwives into a college, with himself as governor; a claim made in this context, that Dr Peter was particularly enthusiastic about the use of iron instruments in difficult cases, may be the first hint of there being a &#145;family secret&#146; underpinning the Chamberlens' success in midwifery. Dr Peter was expelled from the College of Physicians in 1649 when, following the execution of Charles I, the college became more conservative and began to take action against empirics and others challenging its authority. He was reinstated as physician-in-ordinary by Charles II in 1660.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">A Voice in Rhama</span> (1647) Dr Peter stated that his was an &#145;Asclepiad-family&#146;, to which he owed his knowledge of both medicine and drugs. The medical character of the family continued into the next generation: his daughter Elizabeth married Colonel William Walker, and their sons Chamberlen (<i>d</i>. 1731) and Middleton were both doctors, in Dublin and London respectively, while of his fourteen sons, four practised some form of medicine. The best-known of these is <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5062/', "Hugh Chamberlen the elder")</script>, whose own son (also Hugh) was also in practice. Nathaniel studied at Pembroke College, Oxford (BM 30 June 1636). John, who died in 1699 in the parish of St Clement Danes, was a physician who practised midwifery. Another son, <a name="cosubject_5064"></a><span class="headword">Paul Chamberlen</span>  (1635&#150;1717)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 22 October 1635, was a quack doctor living in Great Suffolk Street, best known for the &#145;anodyne necklace&#146; he sold for 5<i>s</i>. It came with liquid coral, which could be rubbed on to the gums to aid teething; the necklace was also marketed to ease pain in childbirth. When his brother Hugh left London for Scotland in 1699, Paul advertised in the <span class="italic">London Post</span> to assure his clientele that he remained in London, and had not deserted his practice. His patients included the duchess of Hamilton; unlike his brother, he appears to have been on good terms with midwives and, in 1706, he wrote to Hans Sloan recommending the midwifery skills of Mrs Bizzel. He died on 3 December 1717 and was buried in the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields; his wife, Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Disbrowe), died in the following year.<br>
<br>It was through Hugh the elder that the claims of a family secret were first made public. In 1673, in the preface to <span class="italic">The Accomplisht Midwife</span>, his translation of Fran&ccedil;ois Mauriceau's <span class="italic">Trait&eacute; des maladies des femmes grosses</span>, Hugh claimed that, with his father and two of his brothers, he possessed the secret of how to deliver a living child if it presented by the head but the birth was obstructed. He implied that the secret was a skill rather than a device, &#145;a Way to deliver Women in this Case, without any prejudice to them or their Infants&#146;; however, this phrasing may have been intended to draw attention away from any suggestion that the secret was some form of instrument. Traditionally, surgeons used hooks in such deliveries, killing the child in the process if it were not already dead, so that their arrival was greeted with despair. In 1678 one of the family&#151;either Hugh or his father, Dr Peter&#151;proposed to the crown that the family secret could be passed on to &#145;2 or more discreet persons in each county of England and Wales&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1678</i>, 610). The offer was not taken up; a petition by Hugh to the College of Physicians for &#145;a patent relating to midwifery&#146; in 1687 also failed. It is possible that few believed in the secret, which smacked of typical quack methods more characteristic of Paul's practice; Hugh's political notoriety may also have contributed to the lack of wider interest in his claims at this time.<br>
<br>In 1694 Mauriceau's <span class="italic">Observations</span> gave his version of the events of 1670, when Hugh had met him in Paris, alleging that Hugh had offered to sell the secret for 10,000 crowns, and that he had then tested Hugh by allowing him to attempt to deliver a woman of whom he had previously despaired. Despite his boasts, Hugh had failed. But by the 1690s Hugh was working on other schemes; in particular, like his father in 1649 and his brother Paul in 1705&#150;6, he was continually bombarding parliament with banking proposals.<br>
<br>The family midwifery practice meanwhile passed from Hugh to his son <a name="cosubject_5063"></a><span class="headword">Hugh Chamberlen the younger</span>  (1664&#150;1728)<span class="occ"></span> and to his cousin Middleton Walker. Hugh the younger held political and religious affiliations very different from those of his father, who was a whig and a Baptist. Hugh the younger&#151;a tory and a member of the Church of England&#151;was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, studied medicine in Leiden, and became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 2 April 1694. In striking contrast to the turbulent relationship of previous generations of the family to the college, he served as censor in 1707, 1718, and 1721. He married three times, his first wife being Mary Bacon and his third Mary, Lady Crew. He was a highly fashionable man-midwife, employed for example by the tory Stafford family; after the death of the duke of Buckingham, Hugh lived openly with his widow, Catherine, parting from her in November 1727. He subscribed to books by tory authors including Thomas Hearne, Matthew Prior, and John Gay. On his monument in Westminster Abbey, erected in 1729 by Edmund, duke of Buckingham, the family medical tradition is represented by the snake of Asclepius, and reference is made to Hugh the elder and Dr Peter.<br>
<br>However, other English practitioners associated with the Chamberlen family used the forceps while the family was still active in midwifery. Among these was James Douglas, associated with Paul Chamberlen, and who attended Chamberlen patients when a family member was not available. Douglas used instruments unsuccessfully in a case he attended in 1702, and his own account of the event states that he was unable to fasten what he describes only as &#145;the thing&#146; in such a way that he could exert traction with it. Douglas may have obtained the instruments while studying in the Dutch republic, possibly in Utrecht, or may have been taught their use by Hugh the elder. It is known that Hugh the elder sold two instruments to a group of Dutch surgeons, including Rogier van Roonhuysen, about 1694, and that they kept the knowledge secret until about 1750. As for France, a few French surgeons were using the forceps from 1717 onwards, employing them however not to deliver live children, but to extract a dead foetus.<br>
<br>As Hugh the younger had three daughters, his death in 1728, followed by that of Middleton Walker on 16 November 1732, marked the end of the Chamberlen family medical tradition; the design of the forceps was published in 1733. In the same period, three midwifery instruments emerged on the scene in England, France, and the Dutch republic: the forceps, the vectis, and the fillet. The forceps consisted of two blades by which the foetal head could be grasped and traction exerted; the vectis was a single curved blade which could be used to alter the position of the head; the fillet comprised a rigid handle and a flexible strip that could be looped around the head before exerting traction. But, in addition to Douglas, several practitioners in the London area were using the forceps before 1732; Hugh the younger, having no male heir, perhaps sold the secret for a fee to a few individuals in the period from about 1710 to 1720.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, it remained impossible to identify the forceps securely as the Chamberlen secret hinted at by Dr Peter and probably underlying the practice of his father and uncle; after 1733 some practitioners in England continued to suggest that the secret had been a manual technique rather than a medical instrument. The fillet was particularly difficult to use, so that part of the secret could have been instruction in the best technique. By 1750, opinion had generally settled on the forceps as the Chamberlens' device. But in 1813, Peter Chamberlen's own medical instruments were discovered under the floorboards of the attic at the house where he had died. These included not only three sets of the forceps, vectis, and fillet, with one example of what is apparently an earlier version of the forceps, but also the hooks used to remove a dead child. Wilson thus argues that &#145;all the three early-modern instruments for delivering a living child by the head originated with the Chamberlens&#146;  (Wilson, 57).<br>
