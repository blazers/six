<span class="headword">Nash,  Thomas Arthur Manly</span>  (1905&#150;1993), <span class="occ">entomologist</span>, was born on 18 June 1905 at 22 Lennox Road South, Southsea, the younger of the two children of Llewellyn Thomas Manly Nash, a colonel in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and his wife, Editha Gertrude, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sloggett. Tam (the nickname by which he was universally known) spent much of his early childhood in India, returning to England for his schooling at Wellington College. He obtained a BSc in entomology at the Royal College of Science (later Imperial College). In 1927 he was employed by the Colonial Office to work in the department of tsetse research and reclamation, Tanganyika Territory. There he undertook investigations on aspects of the biology of tsetse flies, the vectors of the trypanosomes which cause sleeping sickness in humans, and a related disease of domestic livestock in much of tropical Africa. After returning briefly to England he married Marjorie Wenda (1907&#150;1988), daughter of Walter Alexander Wayte, dental surgeon, at Wadworth parish church, Yorkshire, on 22 February 1930.<br>
<br>Nash continued working in east Africa until 1932 by which time he had been awarded a London PhD and DSc. The following year he moved to Nigeria as medical entomologist in the sleeping sickness service of the Ministry of Health. From 1937 to 1944 he was in charge of the Anchau rural development and settlement scheme, where he was able to put to practical use his research findings on the effectiveness of partial clearing of vegetation forming the flies' habitat as a method of tsetse control. He demonstrated that tsetse control, combined with development of the rural economy, could result in freedom from human and animal trypanosomiasis and an improvement in general health and living conditions. In 1948 the Colonial Office established the West African Institute for Trypanosomiasis Research, located in Nigeria with the mandate to conduct research on the medical, veterinary, entomological, and parasitological aspects of trypanosomiasis relevant to the then four British colonies in west Africa: Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and The Gambia. Nash transferred from the sleeping sickness service to the new institute, taking up the post of chief entomologist. Following the resignation of the founder director he became director of the institute in 1954 and remained in that position until his retirement in 1959. His achievements in Africa were acknowledged by appointment as OBE (1948) and CMG (1959).<br>
<br>In 1962 Nash came out of retirement and founded, with funds from the department of technical co-operation, the Tsetse Research Laboratory located on the Langford site of the veterinary school of the University of Bristol. He was a research fellow of the university and director of the laboratory. He retired for the second time in 1971, having demonstrated the feasibility of maintaining colonies of the slow breeding tsetse fly in the laboratory, an achievement on which was based subsequent extensive research programmes at Langford and elsewhere on the insect and on the diseases that it transmits.<br>
<br>Nash's publications included <span class="italic">Tsetse Flies in British West Africa</span> (1948), <span class="italic">Africa's Bane: the Tsetse Fly</span> (1969), <span class="italic">A Zoo without Bars</span> (1984)&#151;a lighthearted look at his life in the wilds of east Africa in 1927&#150;32&#151;and numerous papers on tsetse flies and trypanosomiasis in scientific journals. He died, predeceased by his wife and only son, in the General Hospital, Weston-super-Mare, on 14 January 1993 of cerebral infarction and was cremated on the 22nd; his ashes were scattered in his much loved garden at Spring Head Farm, Upper Langford.<br>
