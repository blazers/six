<span class="headword">McCartney <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Eastman; <em>other married name </em>See]</span>,  Linda Louise</span>, Lady McCartney  (1941&#150;1998), <span class="occ">photographer and promoter of vegetarianism</span>, was born on 24 September 1941 in Scarsdale, New York, USA, the second child and eldest daughter in the family of one son and three daughters of Lee Eastman, formerly Leopold Vail Epstein (<i>b</i>. 1910), lawyer, and his wife, Louise Sara (1911&#150;1962), daughter of Max Dryfoos Lindner of Cleveland, Ohio. Both her parents were Jewish. Despite the widespread belief to the contrary, the family was not related to the Eastmans of Eastman Kodak. She was educated at Scarsdale high school, spending the summers in the family house at Cape Cod, where her parents entertained artists including Willem de Kooning, and musicians such as the bandleader Tommy Dorsey. After briefly attending the University of Arizona she studied photography at a local arts centre, and married John Melvyn (Mel) See (<i>d</i>. 2000), a geologist, on 18 June 1962. There was one daughter, Heather, from this marriage. After her divorce in 1965, she moved back to New York and took a job as an editorial assistant with <span class="italic">Town and Country</span> magazine. <br>
<br>Linda Eastman's career as a photographer of rock and roll groups was launched in 1966, after she photographed the Rolling Stones at a press reception on a boat in New York harbour. At Fillmore East Auditorium, the New York rock venue, she photographed all the most famous bands and singers of the 1960s, including The Who, The Animals, Jim Morrison and The Doors, Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, and the Grateful Dead, and particularly admired Jimi Hendrix. Her photographs were much sought after, and appeared in magazines such as <span class="italic">Life</span> and <span class="italic">Mademoiselle</span>. A selection of these photographs, <span class="italic">Sixties: Portrait of an Era</span>, was published in 1992. <br>
<br>Linda Eastman met Paul McCartney (<i>b</i>. 1942), songwriter and member of The Beatles rock group, in 1967, and they were married on 12 March 1969: he adopted Heather and they had three further children, Mary, Stella, and James. The Beatles were breaking up at the time of their marriage, and the media and the fans accused her and John Lennon's wife, Yoko Ono, of being responsible for this. She helped Paul McCartney to start writing songs again, and the first song in his solo album <span class="italic">McCartney</span> (1970) was &#145;The Lovely Linda&#146;. She helped him to form a new band, Wings, in 1971, and although she had no musical training he persuaded her to join the band as keyboard player and singer, contributing to albums including <span class="italic">Ram</span> (1971), <span class="italic">Band on the Run</span> (1973), and <span class="italic">Venus and Mars</span> (1975). The Wings' recording of &#145;Mull of Kintyre&#146; became the then highest-selling single ever. The band toured regularly, including a thirteen-month world tour in 1975&#150;6 which ended at Wembley Stadium. In 1977 she wrote and recorded her first solo song, &#145;Seaside Woman&#146;, and this served as the soundtrack for the animated film made by Oscar Brill which won the Golden Palm for Best Short at the Cannes Film Festival in 1980. Wings was disbanded in 1980. Paul McCartney, who continued to enjoy a successful solo career, was knighted in 1997. <br>
<br>Linda McCartney became a vegetarian in the early 1970s, and wrote <span class="italic">Home Cooking</span> (1989) to encourage people who wanted to cook without using meat. After this success&#151;over 400,000 copies were sold&#151;she continued to publish cookery books, including <span class="italic">Linda McCartney's Home Cooking</span> (1994) and <span class="italic">Linda's Kitchen</span> (1995). <span class="italic">Linda McCartney on Tour</span> (1998) was published posthumously. She promoted the idea of cooking vegetarian food disguised as meat, advocating the use of textured vegetable protein, and went on to launch her own line of frozen vegetarian meals, Linda McCartney's Meatless Entr&eacute;es, in 1991, with dishes including Beefless Burgers and Ploughman's Pie, extending her range to include Chili Non-Carne and Bavarian Goulash. In 1995 she opened a factory in Fakenham, Norfolk, with 500 employees, but although highly successful in Britain, Linda McCartney's Home Style Cooking did not succeed in the United States, where it was launched in 1994, partly because the meals were high in calories, and contained a large proportion of fat. She became a prominent animal rights campaigner, working with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. <br>
<br>Linda McCartney's photographs became known to a wider public in the 1980s, with several exhibitions, including one at the Royal Photographic Society in Bath in 1987, and her <span class="italic">Sun Prints</span> were shown at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1988. She was diagnosed as suffering from breast cancer in 1995 and died on 17 April 1998 at the McCartneys' ranch near Tucson, Arizona. Four of her photographs, including &#145;The Beatles and Yoko Ono&#146; (1969), are in the permanent collections of the National Portrait Gallery in London and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC.<br>
