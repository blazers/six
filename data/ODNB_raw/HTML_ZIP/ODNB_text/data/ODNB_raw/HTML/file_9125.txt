<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Falkner,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1682), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was admitted sizar at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, on 20 December 1648, migrated to Peterhouse on 6 July 1650, and graduated BA in 1652&#150;3. He became a fellow of Peterhouse in 1654 and proceeded MA in 1656. He was ordained deacon in Lincoln on 8 June 1661 and priest two days later. By 1662, when a son, Thomas, was buried, Falkner had married Susan (1639/40&#150;1680), daughter of Thomas Greene, merchant, alderman, and mayor of King's Lynn. They had at least two sons and three daughters who died young and a son, William, who survived his parents. By October 1662 he was described as preacher of St Nicholas Chapel in Lynn.<br>
<br>Falkner published <span class="italic">Libertas ecclesiastica, or, A discourse, vindicating the lawfulness of those things, which are chiefly excepted against in the Church of England, especially in its liturgy and worship</span> (1674). As its full title suggests this work was an argument for religious uniformity. Falkner was committed to the national vocation of the Church of England. While he held the established church to be legitimated by God's word he also held that it was the role of the church to affirm royal supremacy. The church, therefore, had an important role in legitimating the crown, and he maintained that the church had to discharge this duty in order to secure blessing for the realm. Falkner sincerely desired that the prayer book should be an instrument of national unity through the weekly round of services, and held that nothing could be adduced that could &#145;hinder pious men from hearty joining therein, or yielding unfeigned assent thereto&#146;  (Falkner, <span class="italic">Libertas ecclesiastica</span>, 55).<br>
<br>Richard Baxter was somewhat dismissive of Anglican claims that Falkner's text was unanswerable. He conceded Falkner to be &#145;a sober learned man&#146; and &#145;indeed he speaketh plausibly to many of the nonconformists smallest exceptions&#146;. Nevertheless, on a whole range of weightier matters Baxter found &#145;his defence is so poor and slight, as is fit to satisfy no judicious man, that is not prepared for error by interest and will&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, pt 3, 108).<br>
<br>In 1679 Falkner also published <span class="italic">Christian Loyalty</span>, a book apparently completed by mid-1678 and prompted by the parliamentary defeat of two bills in the 1677 session. It read as a tory alternative to exclusion, which aimed to impose limitations on the ecclesiastical power of a Catholic monarch, while at the same time enhancing the power and authority of the bishops. The succession would stand, but the church would be protected from the monarch by removing from the civil power all authority in spiritual matters. A popish prince would be expected to practise his religion privately while upholding the protestant church in public. Clearly Falkner's literary efforts gained the approval of the Anglican hierarchy and in 1679 he was appointed rector of Glemsford, Suffolk. He became a DD in 1680.<br>
<br>Falkner died at King's Lynn on 9 April 1682. Several of his works were published posthumously, including <span class="italic">Two Treatises</span>, edited by William Sherlock in 1684, to which some sermons were added which detail Falkner's ideal for the Anglican clergy.<br>
