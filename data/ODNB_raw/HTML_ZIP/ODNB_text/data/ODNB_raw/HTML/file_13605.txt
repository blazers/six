<span class="headword">Holmes,  William</span>  (1779&#150;1851), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the fifth son of Thomas Holmes, a rich brewer in co. Sligo, and his wife, Anne; and of a family long settled in King's county, Ireland. He was born in Sligo, and graduated BA of Trinity College, Dublin, in 1795. He entered the army, served in the West Indies, and was there military secretary to Sir Thomas Hislop. He later developed his West Indian connections as agent for Demerara from 1820 to 1833. He left the army in 1807 upon his marriage on 27 October that year to Helen, Lady Stronge, widow of the Revd Sir James Stronge, bt, and daughter of John Tew of Dublin and Margaret Muswell. He entered parliament for Grampound, Cornwall, in March 1808, and sat for that place until 1812, then for Tregony, Cornwall (1812&#150;18), Totnes, Devon (1818&#150;20), Bishop's Castle, Shropshire (1820&#150;30), Haslemere, Surrey (1830&#150;32), and Berwick upon Tweed (1837&#150;41). From 1832 to 1837 he was not in parliament, though in 1835 he unsuccessfully contested Ipswich. In 1841 he stood for Stafford, but was not elected, and he then quitted parliamentary life.<br>
<br>For thirty years &#145;Black Billy&#146; Holmes was the adroit and dexterous whip of the tory party, and his great knowledge of the tastes, wishes, idiosyncrasies, weaknesses, and family connections of all the members on the tory side of the house made him a most skilful party manager and dispenser of patronage. His position was of especial importance as Peel, the tory leader in the Commons, took little interest in party business. His Charles Street headquarters developed into the Carlton Club and the &#145;Charles Street fund&#146; was an important precedent in the development of party organization. Very unusually for a whip, Holmes was not a lord of the Treasury, but was treasurer of the ordnance from 1818 to 1830. He was classed as an &#145;ultra-tory&#146; but reported on the ultras to the party leadership. Though often violently attacked, his personal honour remained unquestioned in the midst of a life of intrigue, and he was not unpopular with his opponents. A fanatical protestant, by special permission from the duke of Wellington he was allowed in 1829 to vote against the ministerial <span class="roman">Roman Catholic Relief Bill</span>. He died at his home in Grafton Street, London, on 26 January 1851, leaving one son, Thomas Knox Holmes.<br>
