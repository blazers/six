<span class="headword">Cragg,  Robert</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1682&#150;1689), <span class="occ">conspirator and rebel</span>, made three journeys between London and the Netherlands, under the alias of John Smith, in March&#150;April of 1685, carrying messages between the surviving whig opposition in England and the exiled duke of Monmouth, who was preparing his ill-fated rebellion of June&#150;July 1685. These communications carried by Cragg had a material impact upon the form which the rebellion took, and upon its outcome. Cragg was well suited to the role of messenger because he was, at the time, a minor figure and completely unknown to the government and its agents. He was an associate of the radical printer William Disney from about 1682 and seems to have made at least part of his living by distributing subversive pamphlets. In 1684 he was spreading a pamphlet which alleged that the whig earl of Essex had not committed suicide in the Tower before his trial in 1683, but had been murdered by government order. In 1684 he also ferried materials for another pamphlet on this dangerous subject to Amsterdam, to the radical preacher Robert Ferguson, and this experience in smuggling subversive material also recommended him for his missions in 1685.<br>
<br>At the beginning of March 1685 Disney paid Cragg to take an oral message to the duke of Monmouth in Amsterdam asking whether he intended to participate in the earl of Argyll's planned rebellion in the highlands, word of which had reached the radicals in England. In his confession written after the rebellion Cragg claimed that he did no more than deliver this message to Ferguson (who was acting for Monmouth), and that he did not see the duke. Other accounts, also confessions written after the rebellion, assert that Cragg not only saw Monmouth but went well beyond his instructions, saying that there would be much support, in men and money, if Monmouth invaded England while Argyll raised Scotland. Possibly Ferguson (who strongly wanted a rebellion) conveyed a lying account of his interview with Cragg to the duke, who was still uncertain whether a rebellion should be attempted. In any case Cragg then made two further journeys between London and Amsterdam during March and April, each time now conveying negative messages from England that there was no money or support to be had there and that Monmouth would do better to join with Argyll's venture, and returning with angry demands from the duke for money, armed men, and co-ordinated action from his former supporters. Cragg gives a telling account of the fear, incompetence, and lack of trust which prevented many potential allies from supporting the 1685 rebellion, so contributing to its failure.<br>
<br>As the venture came to its end at Sedgemoor, Cragg experienced a personal tragedy with the death of his wife and child. He did not escape abroad and was arrested in December 1685. There were rumours that before his arrest he had blackmailed prominent whigs contacted before the rebellion, and one exile wished that Cragg had been killed to silence him. However, though Cragg was held in prison for nine months and put under considerable pressure, his confession failed directly to incriminate surviving whig grandees such as Lord Delamere and the earl of Macclesfield, as James II undoubtedly hoped it would. After the 1688 revolution he was questioned by the privy council as to whether he had, in fact, been suborned to testify against these men. At the same time he was applying for assistance to John Wildman, now postmaster-general and dispenser of much patronage, but to no effect, and after 1689 he is not heard of again.<br>
