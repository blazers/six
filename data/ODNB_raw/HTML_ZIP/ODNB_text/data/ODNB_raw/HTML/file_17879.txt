<span class="headword">Malet, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1582&#150;1665), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was the son and heir of Malachi Malet, of Luxulyan, Cornwall, and his wife, Elizabeth Trevanion. Despite his Norman lineage, and more immediate descent from a solicitor-general to Henry VIII, Malet's immediate family and early life remain obscure. His special admission to the Middle Temple on 29 November 1600 at the request of Chief Baron Sir William Peryam lists his father as &#145;gent.&#146;, a vague and formulaic description. Malet's call to the bar at the summer reading of Sir Henry Montagu in 1606 was confirmed the following November.<br>
<br>In 1614 Malet made his parliamentary d&eacute;but as member for Tregony, Cornwall, being named to five committees and speaking on at least thirteen occasions. Growing professional stature may also be indicated by his appointment in 1616 with two other barristers to organize the Middle Temple's contribution to the tournament staged at Charles's creation as prince of Wales. On 18 March 1620 Malet married Jane, the daughter of Francis Mills, at St Matthew's, Friday Street, London; as their family grew with the birth of successive sons and daughters, eventually eight in all, he leased the Somerset manor of Poyntington in 1624, acquiring the freehold jointly with his uncle Michael Malet in 1630. Malet sat again for Tregony in 1621, where he continued an active speaker and committee man, attacking monopolists, patentees, and judicial corruption. By now, however, Malet was himself beginning to accumulate court preferment, initially via Bishop George Montaigne in his capacities as dean of Westminster and lord almoner, then through his own kinsman Edward Conway, secretary of state, who helped secure not only his return for Newport, Isle of Wight, in 1625 and 1626, but also the office of solicitor-general to Queen Henrietta Maria (September 1626). Hence Malet's lower profile in the first two parliaments of the new reign, and his qualified defence of Conway's patron Buckingham in the 1626 debate on the favourite's impeachment, although the demands of a still expanding practice and his fortnight's Middle Temple reading on 32 Hen. VIII c. 30 (jeofails) in Lent 1626 doubtless also played some part.<br>
<br>Conway's death in 1631 barely checked Malet's advancement; when he was created serjeant in 1636 the patrons who lent their names to the case pleaded at his call were the queen and his old Middle Temple mentor, now the earl of Manchester. As befitted a &#145;learned man of good report&#146;  (Baker, <span class="italic">Serjeants</span>, 375) he enjoyed a widely based practice in Westminster Hall, served as treasurer of Serjeants' Inn, Chancery Lane, and acquired a Westminster town house. But it may rather have been his connection with a country near-neighbour, John Digby, earl of Bristol, that led to Malet's knighthood and appointment as puisne justice of king's bench on 1 July 1641. Within a year his suspected conniving at the promotion of a royalist petition from the Lent assizes at Maidstone saw Malet imprisoned in the Tower. Released in May 1642, he again rode the home circuit that summer. But when some Kentish MPs were refused permission to read a parliamentary declaration in his court at Maidstone, black rod and a troop of horse brought him back to the Tower. There he remained until October 1644, when he was released in order to negotiate a prisoner exchange at Oxford.<br>
<br>Malet stayed eighteen months with the king, during which time parliament formally disabled him from any future judicial service. After being admitted to compound in December 1646, he retired to Somerset. But on 2 May 1660 the House of Lords summoned &#145;Serjeant Mallet&#146;  (Woods, 128) to attend them, and within the month he was reappointed judge. Disappointed of the chief justiceship, for which he no longer possessed physical or mental capacity, Malet was permitted to retain his judicial place and perquisites, without any requirement to attend court sittings. He died, probably at Poyntington, on 19 December 1665, some two and a half years after being granted a pension of &pound;1000, plus a baronetcy which for unknown reasons he did not take up. He was buried at Poyntington and was survived by his wife.<br>
