<span class="headword">Cooke, Sir  Anthony</span>  (1505/6&#150;1576), <span class="occ">educator and humanist</span>, was the only son of John Coke or Cooke (1485&#150;1516) of Gidea Hall, Essex, within the liberty of Havering-atte-Bower near Romford, and Alice Saunders (<i>d</i>. 1510), daughter of William Saunders of Banbury, Oxfordshire. He was the great-grandson of Sir Thomas Cook, a wealthy draper, who was lord mayor of London in 1462&#150;3.<br>
<br>John Coke died in 1516, leaving the eleven-year-old Anthony to be raised by his uncle Richard Cooke, a diplomatic courier under Henry VIII, and his stepmother, Margaret Pennington, a lady-in-waiting first to Katherine of Aragon and later to the Princess Mary. Some time before 1523 Anthony Cooke married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1553), daughter of Sir William Fitzwilliam (<i>d</i>. 1460) of Gaynes Park, Essex, a London merchant and former sheriff of London. In 1523 Cooke was admitted to the Inner Temple and was granted the use for life of the Essex chamber.<br>
<br>Almost nothing is known of Cooke's actions over the next twelve years. There are no further references to him at the Inner Temple but he apparently remained in England for much of this time. He appears in the one surviving Havering manor court roll for these years acting as an agent for his family's lands, and his landed inheritance may have occupied much of his time. A fourth share in the estate of his maternal great-grandfather, Sir Henry Belknap, fell to Cooke in 1521, when he was only sixteen, giving him valuable lands in Warwickshire and adjoining counties.<br>
<br>Cooke next appears in the 1530s. From 1531 he was regularly appointed a justice in the liberty of Havering, and he was one of the Essex gentlemen alerted during the Pilgrimage of Grace in 1536; he may also have served in Ireland in 1536&#150;7. Called upon to provide troops for the army in Flanders in 1543 and France in 1544, he served as sheriff of Essex and Hertfordshire in 1544&#150;5, and was named to several local commissions. In 1539 he had received his first appointment at court, being named one of the fifty &#145;spears&#146; of Henry VIII's reconstituted bodyguard. He was present at the reception of Anne of Cleves in 1540 and of the admiral of France in 1546, and in the latter year was given a regular position at court as a gentleman of the privy chamber. He was made a knight of the Bath on 20 February 1547, and also sat for Lewes in that year's parliament. He subsequently served as a commissioner to inquire into heresies in Essex in 1549, and on the commission of 1552 to revise the ecclesiastical laws.<br>
<br>Cooke's greatest importance lies in the field of education, particularly of women, yet nothing is known of his own basic training. He was almost certainly self-taught. At some point, perhaps in the 1530s, he embarked on a serious study of the church fathers, and was sufficiently advanced by 1541 to complete a translation from the Latin of a sermon on prayer by St Cyprian, which he dedicated to the king. The dedication of the manuscript (it remains unpublished) suggests some familiarity with the &#145;new thought&#146; of the humanist movement in England, although there is no evidence of Cooke's having studied with any of the humanists of his day. It praises Henry VIII for delivering his subjects from the &#145;captivity and bondage&#146; of Rome but is not otherwise overtly protestant, although this may represent a deliberate attempt to avoid controversy.<br>
<br>Some time in the 1530s Cooke turned his attention to the education of his children, and especially that of his daughters. Enlightened opinion favoured some form of training for girls, but Cooke's five daughters received as good an education as that given to his four sons and probably better. Latin and Greek certainly formed part of their studies and they may also have received some training in Hebrew and modern languages. They read both early Christian writers and the works of contemporary protestant thinkers, and became well known for their scholarly abilities. The eldest daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46675/', "Mildred Cecil")</script>, who married the future Lord Burghley, was especially praised for her knowledge of Greek, while <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/987/', "Anne Bacon")</script>, the second wife of Lord Keeper Bacon, published works by Ochino and Jewel in translations from Italian and Latin respectively. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15531/', "Katherine Killigrew")</script>, the wife of the diplomat Sir Henry Killigrew, was a strong protestant noted for her linguistic scholarship. She published nothing, but the formidable <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13411/', "Elizabeth Russell")</script>, who married successively the translator Sir Thomas Hoby and John, Lord Russell, second son of the second earl of Bedford, published her translation of a Latin treatise on the sacrament in 1605. The remaining daughter, Margaret, who became a maid-in-waiting to Queen Mary, married Sir Ralph Rowlett in 1558 as his second wife but died only a few weeks later.<br>
<br>The high point of Cooke's career has traditionally been seen as his appointment as tutor to Edward VI, although whether he ever actually held a formal post is uncertain. In 1550 John Hooper referred to Cooke as one of Edward's tutors along with John Cheke, and in May of that year Cooke received a life annuity of &pound;100 in return for giving &#145;training in good letters and manners&#146; to the king  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1509&#150;58</span>, 1.690). Cooke is never mentioned in Edward's journal, however, nor was he ever officially described as royal tutor. Most probably, Cooke began working with Edward in 1550 after the retirement of Richard Cox, another of the royal tutors, but as a companion and guide rather than as a formal teacher.<br>
<br>Cooke may have been slow to move towards religious evangelicalism, but his commitment had grown sufficiently strong by 1553 to lead him to an apparently self-imposed exile shortly after Mary's accession. While on the continent he travelled widely, making visits to Italy before settling in Strasbourg in 1555. There he attended lectures by Pietro Martire Vermigli (known as Peter Martyr) and was in contact with leaders of the reformed faith. Following Mary's death he returned to England, where many expected that he would be named to high office. He played an active part in the parliament of 1559 (in which he sat as a knight of the shire for Essex), but in some way seems to have become disaffected from the progress of the religious settlement, and in spite of his close connections with the highest echelons of the new government he was never granted an important position. He served on several religious commissions early in Elizabeth's reign and sat as a member for Essex again in 1563, but his participation in national affairs, whether political or religious, had virtually ended by that year, and he appears to have been largely absorbed in family matters in the last years of his life. His occupations included the extension of Gidea Hall, which Queen Elizabeth visited in 1568. In his will, drawn up on 22 May 1576 and with a codicil added on 9 June, Cooke provided for the descent of his lands (estimated to be worth some &pound;1100 per annum) to his sons Richard and William. All his surviving sons and daughters received bequests of plate, while each daughter was given her choice of books, two Latin and one Greek, from her father's library. The executors were headed by Bacon and Burghley, each of whom was to have &pound;200 for his pains. His bequests in cash, totalling nearly &pound;1200, bear witness both to Cooke's wealth and to his concern for his wider family&#151;he remembered a number of grandchildren, including Robert Cecil, Anthony and Francis Bacon, and Thomas Posthumous Hoby. Surprisingly, perhaps, his will makes only the briefest possible provision for the well-being of his soul, and contains no charitable bequest at all. Cooke died on 11 June 1576, aged seventy, and was buried in St Andrew's Church at Romford. His effigy survives at St Edward's Church, Romford.<br>
