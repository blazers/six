<span class="headword">Blanchard,  William Isaac</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1741?, <em>d.</em> 1796), <span class="occ">stenographer and legal writer</span>, was the grandson of a French refugee and is probably the William Blanchard baptized on 20 December 1741 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, London, son of Isaac Blanchard and his wife, Ann Mary Delpeuch. He became a shorthand writer in the Westminster law courts about the year 1767. In 1779, following the court martial of Admiral Augustus Keppel, in which he served as shorthand writer for defence counsel, Blanchard published and sold at his office at 4 Dean Street, Fetter Lane, London, <span class="italic">A Complete System of Short Hand, being an Improvement upon All the Authors whose Systems have yet been made Public</span>, the first of his two distinct systems of shorthand.<br>
<br>Blanchard recorded, chiefly in London but also elsewhere in the country, numerous proceedings of special commissions, speeches, and trials, such as the speech of Charles James Fox to explain his resignation from the cabinet, 17 July 1782; the trial of William Davies Shipley, dean of St Asaph, for libel, 1784; and the trial of Warren Hastings, 1788&#150;95, which he recorded for defence counsel opposite the government shorthand writer, Joseph Gurney. Presumably Blanchard's reputation as a legal shorthand writer was enhanced by the verbatim publication of his transcribed notes.<br>
<br>In late 1786 or early 1787 Blanchard published his second and more elaborate system, <span class="italic">The Complete Instructor of Short Hand, upon Principles Applicable to the European Languages</span>. In this work he attacked an unnamed author (Samuel Taylor) whose recently published system, Blanchard claimed, is &#145;entirely useless for the gentlemen of the law, as it will never suit the language of Westminster-Hall (the only test of a good Short-Hand) neither can it possibly be of the least assistance to students in anatomy&#146;  (p. 8). In Blanchard's own system, the writer is &#145;not reduced to the miserable shift of leaving out a great number of monosyllables [with reference to Taylor's omission of vowels], by doing which it would be impossible to convict a person of perjury upon a trial&#146;  (p. 13). Among the subscribers to Taylor's <span class="italic">An Essay Intended to Establish a Standard for an Universal System of Stenography</span> (1786) was, ironically, Admiral (then Viscount) Keppel, whose defence Blanchard had taken in 1779 and published with Keppel's permission.<br>
<br>While his system never achieved the public acclaim accorded that of Taylor, Blanchard established a reputation as a successful and efficient legal shorthand writer &#145;of the first note among gentlemen of the law&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1797). His notes recording a speech of an hour and forty minutes by Thomas Erskine required 208 law sheets, which at 72 words per sheet made a total of 14,976 words  (<span class="italic">Complete Instructor</span>, 3), or about 150 words a minute. Present during a famous speech by Richard Brinsley Sheridan at the impeachment trial of Warren Hastings in June 1788, Edward Gibbon recalled:<blockquote>As I was waiting in the manager's box, I had the curiosity to inquire of the shorthand writer, how many words a ready and rapid orator might pronounce in an hour? From 7000 to 7500 was his answer. The medium of 7200 will afford 120 words a minute, and two words in each second. But this computation will only apply to the English language. (Gibbon, 208)</blockquote>Given Blanchard's references to the suitability of his system for Latin and other languages, it is likely that Gibbon's informant was Blanchard and not a member of the Gurney family.<br>
<br>Blanchard apparently continued as a legal shorthand writer until his death early in 1796, soon after the decease of his wife, who had died, aged fifty-six, in September 1795.<br>
