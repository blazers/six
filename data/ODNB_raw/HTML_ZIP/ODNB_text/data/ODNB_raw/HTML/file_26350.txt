<span class="headword">Steele,  William</span>  (1610&#150;1680), <span class="occ">lord chancellor of Ireland</span>, was the second child and eldest of the three sons of Richard Steele of Giddy Hall, Sandbach, Cheshire (<i>d</i>. after 1631), and his wife, Laetitia (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Shaw). He was admitted to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1627, entered Gray's Inn on 13 June 1631, and was called to the bar on 23 June 1637. On 15 March 1638 he married Elizabeth Godfrey of Wye in Kent; they had a son, Richard. After the outbreak of civil war Steele associated himself with the radical group in London, was appointed deputy recorder, and actively promoted the petition and remonstrance to common council and to parliament (30 March 1643) in which the radical programme was presented. On 17 August 1644 he was appointed a parliamentary commissioner for the execution of martial law. Some years later he conducted the prosecution for treason of Captain John Burley, who was executed for his quixotic attempt to rescue Charles I from captivity in Newport in January 1648.<br>
<br>On 10 January 1649 Steele was chosen by the high court of justice as attorney to present the case against the king. His plea that illness prevented him from doing so was accompanied by an assurance that &#145;it is an addition to his Affliction, that he cannot attend this Court, to do that service that they have expected from him, and as he desires to perform&#146;  (J. Nalson, <span class="italic">The Trial of Charles the First</span>, 1740, 21), and he recovered in time to prosecute Hamilton, Holland, Goring, Capel, and Owen at the second high court of justice on 9 February. His argument in Hamilton's case was published on 4 June. On 27 July 1649 parliament appointed him a member of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in New England, of which he was elected president annually until 1660, and on 25 August he succeeded John Glyn as recorder of London. On 26 March 1650 he was nominated to a new high court of justice, set up to prevent a &#145;new and bloody war&#146; by proceeding against &#145;Enemies of this Commonwealth&#146;  (C. H. Firth and R. S. Rait, eds., <span class="italic">Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum</span>, 3 vols., 1911, 2.364). He was a prominent member of the Hale commission on law reform established in January 1652 and a judge at the trial of John Lilburne in July 1653.<br>
<br>Steele's career was uninterrupted by the transition to the protectorate: he became serjeant-at-law on 25 January 1654 and formally welcomed Cromwell to London on 8 February. He accepted a place on yet another high court of justice, established to try the royalist conspirators Fox, Gerard, and Vowell on 25 June and was appointed a member of the Irish council on 27 August at the insistence of Charles Fleetwood on his appointment as lord deputy. He represented London in the parliament that convened on 3 September. In 1655, after an assize circuit in Essex had been cut short by service on a special commission to the troubled south-west in March, he was made chief baron of the exchequer on 28 May. In that capacity he attended the conference convened at Whitehall in December to consider Manassah Ben Israel's petition for the readmission of the Jews to England and joined John Glyn, now chief justice of the upper bench, in advising that readmission would be lawful. Though he had drawn his annual salary of &pound;1000 as an Irish councillor, it was not until after his appointment as lord chancellor of Ireland on 26 August 1656, which carried remuneration of a further &pound;1000, that he took up his duties.<br>
<br>Once in Ireland, Steele quickly established himself as the leader of the Independents. Having first opposed Henry Cromwell's appointment as lord deputy in 1657 he then patronized him, dealing with him &#145;as a tutor or guardian to a minor&#146;  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 7.199), and subsequently obstructed his policies, pressing for freedom of conscience for Baptists and others and resisting Henry's attempts to reconcile former episcopalians to the regime. He defended the novel system of ministers' salaries which Henry was trying to replace with the reintroduction of tithes, while insisting that ministers should be salaried &#145;without enquiry made into their principles&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 1228, fols. 9&#150;10). The respect in which he was held in England, where he was summoned to the upper house in December 1657, strengthened his position, but Henry's policy prevailed and Steele considered retirement. He seems instead to have turned his attention to the legal reforms which had been part of his original brief, and a new set of rules and orders for chancery was published on his authority in 1659. Though his role in their preparation is unrecorded, the new arrangements were informed by the same concern with expedition and procedural improvement as the earlier recommendations of the Hale commission. After the fall of Richard Cromwell and the recall of Henry, Steele was one of five commissioners appointed to govern Ireland by the restored Long Parliament on 7 June 1659. When that parliament was again expelled by the army he was named as a member of the committee of safety which took office on 26 October. He seized the opportunity to return to England, but declined to serve on the committee and urged the army leaders to leave constitutional matters to parliament. In December 1659, after Dublin Castle was captured and the regime overthrown, the impeachment of the commissioners and their ally Edmund Ludlow, commander-in-chief of the army in Ireland, was demanded, but the once more restored Long Parliament failed to respond.<br>
<br>Ludlow believed that as lord chancellor Steele had been &#145;generally esteemed to be a man of great prudence and uncorrupted integrity&#146;; opponents alleged that he had been the &#145;principal discountenancer of ministers and of the very ministry itself&#146; and had used his office to cast out &#145;honest men&#146; from the commission of the peace and put in Anabaptists, Quakers, and their like instead (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Edmund Ludlow</span>, 2.152&#150;3; <span class="italic">Leyborne-Popham MSS</span>, 141). Although he was not excepted from the provisions of the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span>, Steele took refuge in the Netherlands after the Restoration. How long he remained abroad is unknown, but he was resident at Hatton Garden in London when he made his will on 17 September 1680. He was dead by 19 October, when the will was proved by his second wife, Mary Harvey (formerly Mellish), sister-in-law of William Harvey, to whom he was married before 1663 and with whom he had three children, William, Benjamin, and Mary.<br>
