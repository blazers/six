<span class="headword">Ball,  Andrew</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1653), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, is believed to have been a native of Bristol, but of his family and early life there is no certain account. The first official mention of his name is in early 1648 when he replaced Thomas Bedell as captain of the <i>Adventure</i>, an appointment which suggests he was already an experienced shipmaster. He was soon in action, capturing the Irish frigate <i>Angel</i>. When a large part of the parliamentarian fleet revolted to the king in the second civil war he supported parliament. He secured Holy Island, while Sir Arthur Hesilrige reported that &#145;Captain Ball doth great service at Berwick&#146;  (Powell and Timings, 326). He then joined the earl of Warwick's fleet in the Thames and later sailed to Goree in pursuit of the royalists. He was appointed commander at Walmer Castle, in the Downs, in 1648 and may at some time have served ashore in a military capacity; he would later be described as &#145;that noble and approved soldier&#146;  (Gardiner and Atkinson, 4.101). During 1649 he was employed in the channel, cruising off the Lizard or Land's End protecting commerce. Later in that year he was with Blake's squadron off Kinsale, and in 1650 sailed with Blake to Portugal in pursuit of Prince Rupert's squadron. In November 1650, still in the <i>Adventure</i>, he was selected to accompany Captain Penn to the Mediterranean, and continued absent on that voyage for nearly sixteen months, arriving in the Downs on 1 April 1652 just as the First Anglo-Dutch War was beginning. During the following summer he was engaged in fitting out the <i>Antelope</i>, a new ship only just launched, missing all the summer's action, but in September was sent to Copenhagen in command of a squadron of eighteen ships. The king of Denmark, in collusion with the Dutch, had embargoed twenty English ships in Danish harbours for allegedly failing to pay their sound dues, and it was hoped that the appearance of Ball's force would lead to a more conciliatory attitude. They sailed from Yarmouth on 9 September, and on the 20th anchored a few miles below Elsinore. Ball's negotiating position was weakened by instructions which prevented him from using force, as the king of Denmark was probably aware. They were still hoping that the ships might be released, when, on 30 September, they were caught in the open roadstead in a violent storm; the cables parted, the <i>Antelope</i> was hurled on shore, the other ships, more or less damaged, were swept out to sea. It was not until 2 October that they could get back and take up the survivors from the wreck. Further negotiations being pointless, given the weakened state of his ships, he set sail for England, and arrived in Bridlington Bay on 14 October, from where they went to Harwich and the Thames to refit. After the severe check which Blake received off Dungeness, on 30 November, Ball was appointed to the <i>Lion</i> (50 guns) in place of Captain Saltonstall, whose conduct in the battle had been called in question. In December 1652 and January 1653 he was occupied in refitting the <i>Lion</i>, and he joined the fleet off Queenborough at the beginning of February. There he was promoted to command General Blake's own ship, the <i>Triumph</i>. General Richard Deane, recently arrived from Scotland, may have been responsible for this signal honour. Like Ball, he came from the Bristol area, and both men seem to have been religious Independents; the like-minded Captain John Woolters referred to Ball as his &#145;dear brother in the fellowship of the Gospel&#146;  (Gardiner and Atkinson, 3.422). The fleet sailed down the channel to intercept the Dutch who were escorting home merchantmen from western France. The two fleets met off Portland on 18 February 1653. The fight lasted with great fury throughout the day, and during the whole time the enemy's chief efforts were directed against the <i>Triumph</i>, which suffered heavily in hull, in rigging, and in men. &#145;that precious soul Capt. Ball&#146; being one of those killed  (ibid., 4.172). In acknowledgement of his services, the state assigned a gratuity of &pound;1000 to his widow; no mention is made of any children, but the Andrew Ball who commanded the <i>Orange Tree</i> in the Mediterranean, under Sir Thomas Allin, in 1668, and was then accidentally drowned, may have been a son.<br>
