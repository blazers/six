<span class="headword">Stuart, Sir  John Theodosius  Burnett-</span>  (1875&#150;1958), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Cirencester on 14 March 1875, the eldest of the four sons of Eustace Robertson Burnett-Stuart, a soldier, of Dens and Crichie, Aberdeenshire, and his wife, Carlotta Jane, daughter of J. Lambert of Cottingham, Yorkshire. He was educated at Repton School and at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was commissioned in the rifle brigade in 1895 and served with the Tochi field force on the north-west frontier of India (1897&#150;8). He subsequently served in the South African War (1899&#150;1902), where he was mentioned in dispatches and was awarded the DSO. Promoted captain, Burnett-Stuart served with the 4th battalion of his regiment in Egypt. He graduated from the staff college in 1904 and was posted to the War Office in the directorate of military operations. In the same year he married Nina, only daughter of Major A. A. C. Hibbert Nelson; they had one son and two daughters. In 1910 he was seconded to the New Zealand military forces as director of organization but two years later returned to Britain as instructor GSO2 at Staff College, Camberley.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Jock Stuart, the name by which Burnett-Stuart was familiarly known, held several staff appointments. He was promoted brigadier-general and made brigadier-general, general staff, of 7th corps under Sir Thomas Snow in February 1916. In the final two years of the war Burnett-Stuart gained a reputation as a talented military strategist and a progressive. In the battle of Cambrai in November 1917 the 7th corps was on the flank of the main attack and played no part in the assault. Burnett-Stuart warned that a German counter-offensive was being mounted, but his warnings were ignored. Thus the German counterstroke penetrated deep into the sector held by the 7th corps, but was eventually halted. A month later Burnett-Stuart was promoted major-general and made deputy adjutant-general at general headquarters, a post he held until the end of the war. Before the war ended he demonstrated his vision of a modern fighting force by supporting the army's director of training, Major-General Sir Charles Bonham-Carter, in his drive to ensure that British soldiers were physically fit enough to take part in a modern war.<br>
<br>In 1920 Burnett-Stuart was sent to India to command the Madras district and was in charge of suppressing the Malabar rising of 1921. Two years later he returned to Britain to be director of military operations and intelligence in the War Office. In 1926 he was given command of the 3rd division in the southern command, with A. P. (later Earl) Wavell as his GSO1. The following year Burnett-Stuart was appointed director of the first experimental mechanized force, which was assembled on Salisbury Plain. He pointed out that the infantry would not be capable of keeping pace with the rest of the force in battle unless they were mounted in armoured cross-country vehicles. During the First World War Burnett-Stuart had been sceptical about the use of tanks, but during the early 1920s he changed his mind. He urged the War Office to allow the appointment of men with modern mechanical expertise to assist him. He wanted &#145;enthusiastic experts and visionaries&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) to aid him. One such was Colonel J. F. C. Fuller, chosen to command the new force, who was the outstanding advocate of the need for a highly mobile, mechanized army. However, after exercises in 1928, a decision was taken to disband the armoured force in order to concentrate on the mechanization of infantry and cavalry units.<br>
<br>From 1931 to 1934 Burnett-Stuart commanded the British troops in Egypt and there began to advocate the possible use of mechanized forces in desert warfare. He was promoted general in 1934 and returned to the southern command (holding that post until April 1938). He was horrified to find how bad the condition of the army was on his return from Egypt: &#145;the ranks are more depleted than ever, the equipment and armament practically unchanged&#146;  (Bond, 53). At this time he became the outstanding advocate of a policy of &#145;limited liability&#146; towards a military commitment to the continent, and was scornful of the capacity of a British expeditionary force to play an effective role in a European war. The proper purpose of the army, he argued, was to guard the empire and form an imperial reserve. Burnett-Stuart &#145;boldly and perhaps recklessly as far as his own career was concerned, disseminated these views among his fellow-officers&#146;. He also made them public in several letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span> in November 1938  (Bond, 216).<br>
<br>In 1936 Burnett-Stuart was considered as a successor to Sir Archibald Montgomery-Massingberd as chief of the Imperial General Staff, but he had clashed too often with the latter and was passed over. Although his military career finally stalled, Burnett-Stuart was a colourful figure. In 1936 he admitted that he did not enjoy peacetime soldiering very much: &#145;what I really like is poetry and shooting partridges, and heraldry, and dry fly fishing&#146;  (Bond, 53). In a perceptive but critical assessment published in 1971, B. H. Liddell Hart noted that he was &#145;a man of sparkling mind, lively imagination, and long if variable vision. He had an impish turn of mind, which handicapped his career but which, together with his informality of manner, made him beloved by his subordinates&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Burnett-Stuart was appointed CB (1917), KCB (1932), and GCB (1937), CMG (1916) and KBE (1923). He died at his home, Avington Park near Winchester, on 6 October 1958, and was buried there on 11 October 1958. Recent studies have demonstrated that, although a fine soldier and a perceptive advocate of the use of armoured forces, Burnett-Stuart possessed a curious mixture of progressive and reactionary traits. He was undoubtedly frustrated by the conservatism of senior officers and the scaling down of Britain's military capability. The paradox was that although he and Liddell Hart &#145;were prophetically perceptive in pressing for a highly mobile, mechanised Army&#146;, they nevertheless &#145;opposed the European commitment which alone could have justified the creation of such an &eacute;lite force&#146;  (Bond, 338).<br>
