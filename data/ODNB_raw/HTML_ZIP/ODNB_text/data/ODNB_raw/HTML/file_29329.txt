<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Whittingham,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1579), <span class="occ">dean of Durham</span>, was the son of William Whittingham, a Chester gentleman, and his wife, a member of the Haughton family of Haughton Tower, Lancashire. About 1540 he entered Brasenose College, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1545. In the same year he became a fellow of All Souls and in 1547 a senior student of Cardinal College (later Christ Church) and proceeded MA.<h2>
<a name="Exilescholarshipandpublication"></a>Exile, scholarship, and publication</h2>Nothing is known about Whittingham's conversion to protestantism, though in later years he gave thanks that he had been &#145;called from the blindness of idolatry and superstition&#146;  (Greenwell, 15). At some point during the reign of Edward VI he travelled on the continent to extend his education in the universities of France, Germany, and Geneva. A skilled linguist (he spoke French and German), he acted for a while as interpreter to Sir John Mason, English ambassador to France. He returned briefly to England soon before the accession of Mary, but his protestant convictions soon forced him to travel overseas again. On 27 June 1554 he arrived at Frankfurt am Main where he became involved in the bitter disputes among the English protestant exiles over the issue of the prayer book of 1552. Whittingham aligned himself with John Knox and the &#145;democratic&#146;, Calvinist party, but the arrival of Richard Cox in March 1555 tilted the balance in favour of the prayer book faction and Knox and Whittingham were compelled to secede to Geneva where their views were more readily acceptable.<br>
<br>Whittingham arrived in Geneva in September 1555 and in December he became a senior of the English congregation. On 15 November 1556 he married Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1590), daughter of Louis Jaqueman, a native of Orl&eacute;ans, she being about ten years his junior. Their first two children, Zachary and Susanna, were born in 1557 and 1558, but both died young. Most of his time at Geneva appears to have been spent in scholarship, the results of which constituted his most lasting achievement: he acted in effect as midwife to the word of God in what was to become protestant England, participating in the preparation of the texts that, with the prayer book, were fundamental to the well-being of the reformed church. He translated the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and assisted with the English version of the Geneva <span class="roman">Bible</span>, which went through more than seventy editions between 1560 and 1640 and which maintained its popularity among puritans even after the appearance of the <span class="roman">Authorized Version</span> in 1611. He helped produce Thomas Sternhold's and John Hopkins's edition of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> and the Genevan <span class="italic">Form of Prayers</span>, and translated a book on predestination by Th&eacute;odore Beza. He also found time to write a preface to Nicholas Ridley's <span class="italic">Brief Declaration of the Lord's Supper</span> and a controversial introduction to Christopher Goodman's <span class="italic">How Superior Powers Ought to be Obeyed</span>. Whittingham's involvement with the latter work, directed as it was against rule by the &#145;regiment of women&#146;, caused Elizabeth to be gravely suspicious of his loyalties. When Knox and Goodman returned to England in 1558, Whittingham stayed on to complete his literary projects and, since the congregation was left without a minister, Jean Calvin suggested he should take on that role. Whittingham was reluctant, but in 1558 he became deacon to the depleted congregation and served it in that role, or as minister, for the remainder of his time in Geneva. Certainly there is no record of his appointment as minister in the <span class="italic">Livre des Anglois</span> and Whittingham's precise clerical status at Geneva was to become an issue later in his career.<h2>
<a name="ChaplaincyinFranceandpromotion"></a>Chaplaincy in France and promotion</h2>Whittingham returned to England in May 1560, but the events of 1558 had cast a doubt on the way in which his career might develop. In January 1561 he accompanied the earl of Bedford on an embassy to France to express the queen's condolences on the death of Fran&ccedil;ois II and in May 1562 Bedford, Lord Robert Dudley, and the ecclesiastical commissioner Richard Goodrich made an unsuccessful attempt to secure for him the rectory of Loughborough, Leicestershire. It was probably about this time that Whittingham became chaplain to Ambrose Dudley, earl of Warwick, and his diverse talents were drawn together in October 1562 when, at the request of Warwick, he joined the English expeditionary force at Le Havre as a fighting chaplain. In this post he showed outstanding courage and ability, often preaching in his armour so that &#145;when any alarum came &hellip; he would be on the town walls as soon almost as any man&#146;  (Green, 11). Secretary of State William Cecil was concerned about some of his doctrinal pronouncements, but Whittingham justified these by the circumstances of the war and the need to maintain harmonious relations with the French Huguenots.<br>
<br>In June 1563 Whittingham returned to England followed by a letter from Warwick requesting that the vacant deanery of Durham be bestowed on him. The deanery was already &#145;half promised&#146; to Thomas Wilson, master of requests, but Warwick's suit prevailed and Whittingham was appointed in July, preaching before the queen at Windsor on 2 September before he made his way north. Whittingham does not appear to have had ambitions to rise beyond the deanery despite offers made to him after 1563. In 1572 his name was put forward as a candidate to succeed Cecil, now Lord Burghley, as secretary and in 1575 Sir Henry Killigrew suggested him as a possible ambassador to Scotland because his &#145;ableness in all manner of ways cannot be denied by any that have skill&#146;  (Marcombe, &#145;Dean and chapter&#146;, 33). During the vacancy of the sees of York and Durham in 1576 he was invited by Leicester to come to court &#145;and he should not fail to have one of those places&#146; and as late as 1579 it was suggested that he should be sent to France as ambassador. The fact that none of these proposals materialized illustrates that Whittingham was not a careerist&#151;indeed, he professed himself too old, too infirm, and &#145;very unfit&#146; for the see of Durham or York  (Green, 26). It also indicates that he was content with the preferment he had, and that, possibly, the queen still nurtured suspicions about him.<h2>
<a name="Vestiariancontroversyandtheissueofconformity"></a>Vestiarian controversy and the issue of conformity</h2>The deanery of Durham was a lucrative preferment which actually suited Whittingham's personality and abilities well. Owing to the patronage of Bishop James Pilkington there was already a growing band of protestant prebendaries at Durham, although some conservative elements still lingered in the cathedral, limiting the dean's freedom of action. In 1563 the new dean wrote to Cecil informing him of the good order that had been established: regular services, morning and afternoon sermons on Sundays, and &#145;a general fast with prayers and preaching of God's word&#146; on Wednesdays and Fridays  (BL, Lansdowne MS 7, fol. 24). Moreover, the dean was teaching in the cathedral grammar school on a daily basis and because he was &#145;skillfull in music&#146; he was &#145;very careful to provide the best songs and anthems that could be got out of the Queen's chapel to furnish the choir with all&#146;  (Green, 23). The idyllic picture was dented somewhat by the storm over vestments which was brewing in the mid-1560s. This was an issue on which Whittingham felt strongly and in October 1565 he wrote to Leicester &#145;God forbid that we by wearing the Pope's attire as a thing but indifferent should seem thereby to consent to their blasphemies and heresies&#146;. In March 1565 he joined in a plea to Matthew Parker, archbishop of Canterbury, asking to be excused conformity but, despite the support of Bishop Pilkington, in August 1566 he was summoned before the ecclesiastical commissioners at York with Robert Swift, diocesan chancellor, and John Pilkington, archdeacon of Durham. The accusation against Whittingham was that he had celebrated communion in the cathedral in 1563 without cope or surplice and that he usually wore a black gown and round cap. These accusations were not denied and though he was ordered to wear the correct apparel he prevaricated for a full year before he certified his conformity.<br>
<br>The incident was an important watershed for Whittingham because thereafter his conformity does not seem to have been in serious doubt. In 1571 he subscribed to Parker's articles and when three years later Thomas Wood was collecting information for <span class="italic">A Brief Discourse of the Troubles Begun at Frankfurt</span> (traditionally believed to have been the work of the dean), Whittingham was reluctant to be involved and Wood scolded him for his lack of zeal. Although the <span class="italic">Rites of Durham</span> maintain that the dean engaged in some acts of iconoclasm in the cathedral, &#145;for he could not abide any ancient monuments nor nothing that appertained to any godly religiousness or monastical life&#146;, this perspective seems to have been highly selective  (J. T. Fowler, ed., <span class="italic">The Rites of Durham</span>, SurtS, 107, 1902, 60). The evidence for widespread puritan radicalism in the cathedral is therefore slight, with growing religious conservatism on the part of the dean after 1567.<h2>
<a name="Reformingthechapter"></a>Reforming the chapter</h2>Whittingham was especially active in administrative matters and initiated important changes which he believed to be in the best interests of the survival of the protestant establishment. He also had a comparatively large family to provide for. He prosecuted determined suits against Captain William Reed for certain lucrative tithes in Norhamshire and Islandshire; and against Walter Jobson for the rectory of Brantingham, Yorkshire. In 1565 he suspended an annual fee to Charles Neville, earl of Westmorland, and caused further dismay by claiming twenty years' arrears of rent from him. Certainly, special efforts were being made in the 1560s and 1570s to follow up rent arrears and in 1568&#150;9 a new exchequer was built over the gatehouse as an improved accounting centre. Although like those of other ecclesiastical estates Durham Cathedral rents remained essentially static, Whittingham made efforts in the 1560s to revive customary services and payments in some chapter manors. But the most fundamental changes concerned tenure on the dean and chapter estates and encompassed the issues of corpes lands and tenant right.<br>
<br>Corpes lands were cathedral estates set aside for the maintenance of the dean and prebendaries. The problem was that in the 1560s most of these were in lease to the families and friends of former prebendaries, thus depriving the protestant chapter of any advantage from them. Finding a flaw in the old leases, Whittingham commenced a series of suits before the council of the north in 1565 to recover the corpes lands and was broadly successful, although he received criticism for leasing out the same land again without a proviso for the prebendary to vacate it when he left his stall. The issue of tenant right was even more intractable. The chapter was attempting to replace customary tenure on the bulk of its estates with 21-year renewable leaseholds, but not all of the tenants were happy to comply with this innovation. Consequently, Whittingham organized a series of &#145;lotteries&#146; in which leases were divided up among members of the chapter. They were then in a position to sell the lease to the sitting tenant or to evict the tenant and take occupation of the property themselves. This latter approach was especially controversial, and in 1574 and 1576 the chapter tenants banded together to make complaints to the queen and privy council. Though their claim that they held by tenant right (a form of border military service) was not upheld, the privy council was anxious to preserve stability and in 1577 an order was made by Huntingdon to regulate future leasing.<br>
<br>This abrasive policy was not without its consequences. The Nevilles felt particularly wounded by the perceived slights of the 1560s and they were readily supported by other chapter tenants who felt similarly aggrieved. In 1568 Christopher Neville, uncle of the earl of Westmorland, wrote to Cecil saying he was &#145;sore offended&#146; by the dealings of the Durham chapter and that &#145;their greedy covetousness is such that ten times so much as they have may not suffice themselves&#146;  (Marcombe, &#145;Rude and heady people&#146;, 129). During the northern uprising of 1569, which was motivated partly by such grievances, Whittingham acquitted himself well, using the military experience he had obtained at Le Havre. Before the outbreak he urged Bishop Pilkington to assemble the tenants of the bishopric and dean and chapter, armed, at Durham Castle &#145;which would be a means to awe the collecting rebels and be a stay and refuge for many gentlemen of the country to resort unto&#146;  (Green, 24). When this advice was ignored by the bishop he rode to Newcastle upon Tyne and warned the corporation of the danger of a surprise attack, instructing them how to put their defences in order. He finally left Durham on 10 November 1569, four days before the earls entered the city, &#145;secret intelligence being brought unto him if he went not away that night he could not pass southward for the bridges would be taken up the next night&#146;  (ibid., 25). By 15 November he was at York giving advice to the earl of Sussex and on 28 November he was seeking out intelligence around the Yorkshire borders. Finally he joined the royal army under the earl of Warwick and Lord Clinton and entered Durham with them in mid-December, only to discover that his house and books had been looted by the rebels.<br>
<br>Once the uprising had been finally quelled, underlying issues remained unresolved. In the early 1570s it was alleged that the dean and certain favoured prebendaries had made substantial profits from maladministration of the cathedral estates and Ralph Lever, a dissatisfied protestant prebendary, emerged as the leader of a group who felt themselves excluded, complaining against &#145;deceitful dealings&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 902, fol. 329) and other matters &#145;tending to the discredit of our society&#146;  (Durham University Library, York book, fol. 41). Moreover, in 1574 Thomas Wood warned Whittingham that he had heard Warwick &#145;once or twice complain of your ingratitude&#146;, a veiled reference to the dean's refusal to reward courtiers with grants of church lands  (Green, 25). The atmosphere of complaint and counter-complaint thus engendered brought the cathedral and its dean increasingly under the scrutiny of the queen and privy council.<h2>
<a name="Controversyanddeath"></a>Controversy and death</h2>Whittingham had successfully manipulated the chapter because of his good relationship with Bishop Pilkington and the support of three key prebendaries, Robert Swift and the bishop's brothers, John and Leonard Pilkington. In 1576, however, Bishop Pilkington died, precipitating a series of events that were to lead to the dean's downfall. Jurisdictional rivalry between York and Durham had been an issue since the middle ages, and following Pilkington's death a dispute developed between the chapters of York and Durham, both sees being vacant. Although the issue was taken before the court of delegates, it was abandoned when Edwin Sandys was elected to York and Richard Barnes to Durham in 1577.<br>
<br>Sandys, who suspected abuses in Durham Cathedral, persuaded Barnes to act as his surrogate during his first metropolitan visitation. Because this was at variance with traditional practice, which held that the diocese of Durham was exempt from visitation from York, Whittingham opposed the move and when Bishop Barnes arrived to visit the cathedral on 8 August 1577 the dean turned him away at the chapter house door &#145;taking hold of his gown, and so the business was concluded&#146;  (Green, 27). Once more the matter was taken before the court of delegates, but the case moved on slowly and was increasingly costly to maintain. More serious, the second dispute earned for Whittingham the unbending enmity of Sandys and Barnes. The dean's biographer alleged that a &#145;plot&#146; was hatched in 1577 involving Sandys and Barnes, whose visitation had been frustrated; Ralph Lever, who had inner knowledge of chapter politics and deeply held grievances; and Sir Thomas Wilson, recently appointed secretary of state, whose hopes of the deanery of Durham had been thwarted by Whittingham in 1562. If Wilson could become dean he could work with Barnes and Lever to reform the cathedral and unlock the grants of church land that Pilkington and Whittingham had blocked.<br>
<br>On 10 April 1578 Barnes undertook an unopposed visitation of the cathedral in his position as bishop of Durham and declared himself to Burghley to be dissatisfied with what he found, referring to &#145;that Augiae Stabulum, the church of Durham &hellip;, whose stink is grievous in the nose of God and of men and which to purge far passeth Hercules' labours&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 25, fols. 161&#150;2). Consequently, a commission to undertake a royal visitation of the cathedral was issued on 14 May 1578 with the instruction that it was to investigate all spiritual and temporal offences and letters of orders. The fact that the commission included Sandys and Barnes alongside the earl of Huntingdon, president of the council of the north, and Matthew Hutton, dean of York, did not augur well, since these two factions brought with them long-standing and bitter rivalries.<br>
<br>The commission met for a first session at Durham (23&#150;6 October) and a second session at York (25&#150;8 November) and considered thirty-five articles submitted by Ralph Lever. Though the bulk of these dealt with allegations of immorality, corruption, and mismanagement, virtually all of the discussion centred on the question of the dean's ordination&#151;whether he was properly ordained by Genevan standards and whether Geneva orders were acceptable in the Church of England. Although Whittingham produced certificates from surviving members of the Geneva congregation, Sandys refused to be convinced that he was properly ordained according to the Geneva rite and this appears to have been the main issue at stake. The matter raised high emotions, not least between Sandys and Hutton, and it particularly dismayed Lever, who had hoped for an examination of the more general issues and was not himself dissatisfied with the dean's orders. When the last session broke up in disarray, Whittingham, sensing his advantage, travelled to London to try to get the commission revoked, only to encounter further disagreement on the privy council between Burghley and Wilson.<br>
<br>The long years of acrimony had taken their toll on the dean's health. After returning to Durham, he took to his bed, where he languished for nine weeks. Calling his servants before him, &#145;which were many&#146;, he exhorted them in the fear of God, summoning them one by one and telling them the faults he suspected them of &#145;and did admonish them to leave them&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 33207, fols. 5&#150;8). He made his will on 18 April 1579, leaving legacies to his family, friends, servants, the cathedral staff, and the poor. He died at Durham on 10 June, and was buried in the cathedral. During his time as dean he had bought the manor of Balk, north Yorkshire, and part of the rectory of Mitford, Northumberland, and his personal property (reflected in the will of his widow, who died in 1590) included virginals and a quantity of armour. He was survived by six children: Timothy, Sarah, Deborah, Judith, Elizabeth, and Daniel (<i>b</i>. 1571). Timothy, knighted in 1604 and MP for Thirsk in 1604 and 1611, purchased the Durham manor of Holmside, where he established a landed family which endured for a hundred years.<br>
<br>Whittingham's biography, written by an anonymous author about 1603, paints a picture of a man who was very much a part of the European scene of his day and who brought the ideals of Calvinism and the Renaissance to the far north of England. Less committed sources complained consistently about his favouritism and dubious financial dealings. The fact that he encountered considerable opposition as dean was partly due to the conservatism of the region and partly to Whittingham's unbending conviction of his righteousness, which caused him to press on when more circumspect men might have compromised.<br>
