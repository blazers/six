<span class="headword">Delevingne, Sir  Malcolm</span>  (1868&#150;1950), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born on 11 October 1868 at Oxford Street, London, the second child of Ernest Thomas Shaw Delevingne, wine, spirit, and liquor merchant, and his wife, Hannah Gresswell. His paternal family was of Huguenot descent and his father, though a British subject from birth, was born in Paris. Between 1877 and 1887 he attended the City of London School, where he was school captain (1885&#150;7) and won a scholarship at Trinity College, Oxford, which he entered in October 1887. He gained first-class honours in classical moderations in 1889 and in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1891. In 1892 he passed the civil service examination for &#145;first division&#146; clerkships and, after a brief period at the Local Government Board, was transferred to the Home Office. He remained there for the rest of his career. Initially private secretary to the secretary of state, he rose by stages to the position of permanent under-secretary of state in 1922. He retained this rank until his retirement in 1932.<br>
<br>Although Delevingne was involved in many aspects of the work of the Home Office, he was particularly associated with two questions: occupational health, welfare, and safety and&#151;especially towards the end of his career&#151;the control of dangerous drugs. He brought to this work both profound religious faith and a strong social conscience, and soon acquired an encyclopaedic knowledge of factory legislation &#145;not only on its practical but also on its historical side&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 Dec 1950). He was the unobtrusive force behind moves to improve employment conditions in the first quarter of the twentieth century. In particular, he was instrumental in bringing about the <span class="roman">Police, Factories, etc. (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act</span>, 1916, which allowed the home secretary to order the provision of amenities such as seats, canteens, washrooms, drinking water, and first aid without the need for a full-scale revision of the <span class="roman">Factory Act</span>. In addition he was influential in reorganizing the work of the factory department and establishing the Home Office Industrial Museum as a permanent exhibition of methods for promoting safety, health, and welfare. He was also much involved with mining regulation and did much of the preliminary work which led to the <span class="roman">Coal Mines Act</span> of 1911.<br>
<br>Delevingne was also active on the international stage. In 1905, 1906, and 1913 he was a British government delegate to the international conferences on labour regulations at Bern. As such he was a party to several important agreements, including for prohibitions on the use of white phosphorus in matches and on night work for women. In 1919, as the British representative on the labour commission of the Versailles peace conference, he was one of the architects of the International Labour Organization, whose original constitution he did much to draft. Subsequently he participated in the international labour conferences at Washington (1919) and Geneva (1923, 1928, and 1929). Even in retirement he remained actively involved in questions of industrial welfare. In 1933 he chaired a Home Office committee on shift work for women and young people. Subsequently he served on the royal commission on safety in coal mines (1936) and chaired the Safety in Mines Research Board (1939&#150;47). He was also, again in 1936, chairman of an inter-departmental committee on the rehabilitation of persons injured by accidents.<br>
<br>Delevingne's work for international controls on dangerous drugs took him repeatedly to Geneva and even as far afield as Bangkok, mainly as the British delegate at opium conferences. Convinced that the drug trade was &#145;a great evil which must be fought&#146;, &#145;he never spared himself in the combat&#146;  (Martindale, 34). Responsible for co-ordinating and representing the views of all government departments, he rapidly gained a global reputation as an authority on the subject. As such he served as chairman of the supervisory body under the international convention of 1931 for the limitation of the manufacture of dangerous drugs, and was Great Britain's representative on the League of Nations's advisory committee on opium traffic, 1921&#150;34. After his retirement&#151;indeed, up to the age of seventy-nine&#151;he continued to represent the United Kingdom at the international opium conferences. In 1932 the privy council nominated him a member of the council of the Pharmaceutical Society. In recognition of his services Delevingne was appointed CB in 1911, KCB (1919), and KCVO (1932).<br>
<br>Delevingne was imaginative, innovative, &#145;clever and able&#146;  (Martindale, 35), and was imbued with drive, determination, and a &#145;remorseless quest for precision&#146;  (Butler, 157). Senior colleagues also regarded him as courteous, kind, loyal, and even lovable. Yet his methods sometimes attracted criticism. This was partly because he was something of an autocrat who preferred to deal with a matter personally rather than to delegate, and partly because he &#145;sometimes gave the impression of being too much the bureaucrat who thought that to settle a matter you had only to tie it up in a bundle of regulations, preferably of his own drafting&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 Dec 1950). He also fought tenaciously and, for the duration of his career, successfully, to prevent the transfer of industrial administration from his beloved Home Office to the &#145;upstart&#146; Ministry of Labour. This brought, in comparison to other countries, a certain irrationality into labour administration in Britain, which it was one of Bevin's first actions as minister of labour to remedy.<br>
<br>Delevingne never married. Of his siblings, Walter Norman Delevingne (1870&#150;1937) had a distinguished career in the Indian Civil Service, and his elder brother, Edgar Constant Delevingne (<i>b</i>. 1867), spent some forty years as a master at the City of London School. During his working years his chief recreations were travelling and walking&#151;especially in Norway and Italy. In retirement, until his health deteriorated, he undertook various kinds of social work, especially for Dr Barnardo's Homes. Elected a member of the charity in 1903, he joined its council in 1934. Delevingne died at his home, 20 FitzGeorge Avenue, West Kensington, London, on 30 November 1950.<br>
