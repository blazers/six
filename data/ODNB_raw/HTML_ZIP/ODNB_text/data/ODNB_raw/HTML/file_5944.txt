<span class="headword">Collins,  John</span>  (1741&#150;1797), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, was probably born at St Erth, Cornwall, on 28 September 1741, the only son of the Revd Edward Collins (1692&#150;1755), vicar of St Erth, and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1749), daughter of Nicholas Kendall, canon of Exeter and archdeacon of Totnes. John Collins was educated at Eton College and in the same class as George Hardinge, his friend at school and later his generous benefactor. From Eton, Collins matriculated at the Queen's College, Oxford, on 10 May 1759, and was awarded a BCL degree in 1766. Having taken holy orders, he was sent to Ledbury, Herefordshire, where he was rector. In 1769 he married his cousin Mary (<i>c</i>.1745&#150;1781), only daughter of Walter Kendall of Pelyn, Lanlivery, Cornwall.<br>
<br>Edward Capell, the Shakespearian editor and scholar, was not known personally to Collins. Yet when George Steevens, in the preface to his 1773 edition of Shakespeare, published some characteristically cutting remarks on the labours of his rival Capell, an anonymous pamphlet refuting these criticisms, <span class="italic">A Letter to George Hardinge</span>, was published in 1777 by Collins. Capell was deeply grateful for this defence, and before his death in 1781 he appointed Collins, who visited him during his last illness, an executor, leaving him a large sum of money, together with books and manuscripts, as well as the copyright of his important <span class="italic">Notes and Various Readings to Shakespeare</span> (2 vols.). In return Capell obtained &#145;a promise &hellip; the discharge of which I leave to [Collins's] honour and (I am proud to say) his friendship&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Illustrations</span>, 8.593). Thereafter Collins oversaw the publication of the <span class="italic">Notes</span> and <span class="italic">The School of Shakespeare</span> which Capell had failed to get published in their entirety.<br>
<br>After his wife's death in 1781, Collins's health deteriorated, and for the rest of his life he struggled with mental anxieties and financial problems. Collins seems to have had a contradictory personality: he was scholarly, very personable, with a clear voice and a cheerful manner, but he also seems to have inherited the &#145;inflammable temperature&#146; and &#145;strong prejudices&#146; of his father  (Polwhele, 157&#150;8), which may have precluded higher office. His schoolfriend Hardinge, who had revived their friendship after a chance visit to Ledbury, together with other old friends helped him financially, though not everyone appealed to responded positively. Lord Camelford wrote briskly to Hardinge that there was &#145;no chance of any preferment &hellip; till [Collins] becomes a <i>citoyen actif</i> &hellip; a better recommendation than all your nonsense of suffering merit and genius&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Illustrations</span>, 6.133).<br>
<br>In the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> (7, 1785, 52), Collins is dubbed &#145;a sleep-compelling divine&#146;; his <span class="italic">Letter to George Hardinge</span> is styled &#145;a heavy half-crown Pamphlet&#146;, and Johnson is credited with some rough remarks on Collins's grief at the loss of his wife. These anecdotes are, however, attributed to George Steevens and therefore may be altogether fictitious, or at least coloured by Steevens's unprincipled streak. It is generally accepted that Steevens, possibly in revenge for the accusation of plagiarism levelled against him in <span class="italic">A Letter to George Hardinge</span>, fathered on Collins notes of a suggestive nature in the second Johnson&#150;Steevens edition of Shakespeare (1778). However, Steevens had already attached the name Collins to questionable notes in his 1773 Shakespeare, before John Collins entered the Shakespearian fray in 1777, and again in the 1803 edition, six years after John Collins's death. It is therefore unclear exactly which notes the mischievous Steevens intended as an embarrassment to John Collins and which to some other hapless Collins, long since forgotten.<br>
<br>John Collins died at Penryn, Cornwall, on 20 March 1797. His name, along with those of his wife and four of their six children, is recorded on a monument in Lanlivery church.<br>
