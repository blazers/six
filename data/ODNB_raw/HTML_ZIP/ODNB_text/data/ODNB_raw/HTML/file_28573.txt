<span class="headword">Wallis,  John</span>  (1714&#150;1793), <span class="occ">antiquary and natural historian</span>, the son of John Wallis (or Wallace) of Croglin, Cumberland, was born at Castlenook in South Tynedale, Northumberland. He matriculated from Queen's College, Oxford, on 3 February 1733, graduated BA in 1737, and proceeded MA in 1740. Having taken orders, he held a curacy for a few years in Portsmouth, where he married; his wife, whose name was Elizabeth, died in 1801. The marriage proved to be an extremely happy one  (Winch, 145). Wallis then became curate of Simonburn, Northumberland, where he remained until 1771. It was here that he began to collect and record information relating to the history, archaeology, and natural history of his native county. Despite the remote nature of his parish, it is clear from his published work that Wallis travelled widely in Northumberland and had an extensive network of contacts, including other antiquarians, notably Thomas Pennant and George Allan.<br>
<br>In 1748 Wallis published, by subscription, <span class="italic">The Occasional Miscellany, in Prose and Verse</span> which contained several sermons and two poems. His chief work, however, was <span class="italic">The natural history and antiquities of Northumberland, and so much of the county of Durham as lies between the rivers Tyne and Tweed, commonly called North Bishoprick</span> (2 vols., 1769). The first volume deals with the minerals, fossils, plants, and animals of the county. The plants, including cryptogams, are listed using the nomenclature proposed by John Ray, and although Winch notes that &#145;two or three of the most remarkable plants which he supposed he had discovered growing with us were not the species he took them for&#146;  (Winch, 2.45), his list is reliable and must be considered as the first substantial account of the flora of Northumberland. Swan, while acknowledging Wallis's work, notes that &#145;he did not attempt to include more than just a selection of vascular plants, evidently mainly those which are considered useful (e.g. medicinally) ornamental, or otherwise striking; many large groups [are] completely missing&#146;  (Swan, 11). This criticism may equally be applied to his other lists (fishes, reptiles, and so on,) but none the less Wallis provided a benchmark for today's naturalists, as well as a source of eighteenth-century English and Northumbrian names for many common species of plants and animals. The second volume deals with the antiquities, arranged in three tours through the county and is also still considered a valuable point of reference.<br>
<br>On the death of the rector of Simonburn in 1771 the living was given to James Scott (1733&#150;1813), and as a result Wallis was compelled to leave his curacy. His college friend Edward Wilson, vicar of the Northumberland village of Haltwhistle provided work until 1775 when Wallis was appointed temporary curate at Haughton-le-Skerne, co. Durham; later in the same year he moved to Billingham, near Stockton, where he remained until 1792, when increasing illness forced him to resign.<br>
<br>Wallis was never financially secure, his posts as curate never earning more than &pound;30 a year. In 1779 Thomas Pennant made efforts to secure help from the bishop of Durham. About two years before his death Wallis acquired a small estate on the death of a brother, and Bishop Shute Barrington provided an annual pension when he resigned the curacy of Billingham. Wallis moved to the neighbouring village of Norton, where he died on 19 July 1793. According to one biographer, Wallis, &#145;though possessed of good natural abilities, and no small share of acquired knowledge, lived and died in an obscure station&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>).<br>
