<span class="headword">Frost,  Thomas</span>  (1821&#150;1908), <span class="occ">radical writer</span>, was born at Croydon, Surrey, on 16 December 1821, the son (he had two sisters and a brother) of William Frost (1785/6&#150;1872), a tailor who read Cobbett's <span class="italic">Register</span> and took part in the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> agitation, and his wife, Martha (1789/90&#150;1875). Frost was the product of a rich and complex local culture. He had little formal education, only attending day school (at Hollingbourne House, Norwood) until the age of eleven, but the tools of literacy and the imagination were part of the fabric of his everyday life. His childhood was peopled by storytellers of all kinds, especially gypsies, smugglers, and circus performers, and these influences as well as the periodicals and prints in his maternal grandmother's cottage inspired much of his later work.<br>
<br>Frost became an apprentice in his cousin's printing office in 1836 and the year after he attended an Owenite meeting at Norwood. However, as he later recalled in his first volume of autobiography, it was not until he had read &#145;the grand and wondrous poems of Shelley&#146; a few years later that he fully grasped &#145;the connexion between the influence of circumstances in the formation of character and the new organization which Owen desired to give society&#146;  (<span class="italic">Recollections</span>, 15).<br>
<br>In 1842 Frost met Jem Blackaby, a local Chartist leader and shoemaker&#150;poet. This highly articulate and romantic &#145;organic&#146; intellectual had a major impact on him, as Blackaby possessed qualities &#145;not often met with even amongst those who have enjoyed the highest educational advantages&#146;  (<span class="italic">Recollections</span>, 33). Frost proved a zealous convert to Chartism and Owenism; he tried to join the New Harmony community at one stage and even flirted with the Concordists, a sect that advocated vegetarianism and celibacy. In the end, this proved too much for the worldly Frost and he settled for the more modest ambitions of the Chartist land plan. Nevertheless, the search for spiritual as well as material and political fulfilment was to remain vital throughout his life. In the late 1840s he thought and hoped that momentous political change was imminent, joined G. J. Harney's Association of Fraternal Democrats in 1847, and prophesied revolution in France. Though Frost also believed in &#145;the rightfulness of the meditated revolt&#146; in England, he wisely backed out of a revolutionary conspiracy the year after in time to avoid arrest and imprisonment.<br>
<br>Like many artisans of his generation, above all Frost desired independence. Consequently he borrowed money from his parents to buy a printing press in Croydon in 1843 and produced a local satirical paper, the <span class="italic">Penny Punch</span>. The time was not propitious, as he could not compete with the London steam presses, and he eventually sold up in order to embark on a career as a professional writer. He initially regarded writing as an escape from wage labour and his first novel, <span class="italic">Emma Mayfield</span> (1848), a semi-pornographic, radical critique of regency England, proved a great success. This emboldened him to embark on what he later ironically described as &#145;the flowery path of fiction&#146;  (<span class="italic">Recollections</span>, 75) but he soon found it very difficult to make a decent living from writing. Many of his later fictional works flopped and from the mid-1850s he had to earn a living as a journalist on various regional newspapers, including the <span class="italic">Birmingham Journal</span>, <span class="italic">Liverpool Albion</span>, <span class="italic">Shrewsbury Chronicle</span>, and, in the early 1880s, the <span class="italic">Barnsley Times</span>. When times were hard he also undertook various forms of hackwork, including producing adventure stories for the Religious Tract Society and ghost writing for middle-class patrons, an occupation that he deeply resented.<br>
<br>Frost's later life was a dogged struggle for survival, plagued by money worries. It was no coincidence that the most intellectually productive period of his life occurred between the late 1860s and the mid-1870s, following the receipt of modest legacies from a spinster aunt and his mother. He later referred to these years, when he was living at Long Ditton, Surrey, as among the most pleasant of his life  (T. Frost, <span class="italic">Kingston-on-Thames</span>, 1881, 13). His histories of fairs (1874), circuses (1875), and magicians (1876) published by William Tinsley at this time were pioneering works of social history.<br>
<br>Frost's first volume of autobiography, <span class="italic">Forty Years' Recollections, Literary and Political</span> (1880), is well known to modern historians of Chartism; the second, <span class="italic">Reminiscences of a Country Journalist</span> (1886), though largely ignored, provides fascinating insights into the life of a subaltern author in Victorian England. Some reviewers of his work tried to read his life as evidence of the romance of improvement though Frost strongly rejected this, instead insisting that writing was a form of often poorly paid labour, and referring to himself as a &#145;humble individual&#146;, one of the many &#145;who work as methodically and as regularly as artisans, and support themselves and their families by the products of their brains&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, v). However, in the end he failed to support himself and his family by his pen and had to apply for grants from the Royal Literary Fund thirteen times after 1887.<br>
<br>The details of Frost's married life are obscure. His first wife, Lucy Jane Smith, whom he married in 1843, died early in 1851. They had a son, born in Croydon in 1845, who became a printer. He remarried hastily, and moved to London, but was deeply unhappy and eventually left his second wife, Julia (<i>b</i>. 1833/4), with whom he was living in Westminster in 1861 with their two daughters, and the son from his first marriage. There is no mention of his third partner, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1844/5), in his autobiographical writings but he lived with her from 1867 until the end of his life and had at least two sons with this long-suffering woman. Latterly they lived at Derby. The Royal Literary Fund refused to grant her relief after Frost's death, which took place at his home, Sherwood Cottage, Littleover, Derbyshire, on 16 July 1908.<br>
<br>Frost was a fascinating individual who did not seek &#145;respectability&#146; and was therefore liminal, living on the margin between cultures and classes. He remained &#145;a Chartist and something more&#146;  (<span class="italic">Recollections</span>, 38) all his life but also retained an affection for the pleasures of the common people, especially &#145;low&#146; domains such as the music hall.<br>
