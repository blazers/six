<span class="headword">Buchanan,  John Young</span>  (1844&#150;1925), <span class="occ">chemist and oceanographer</span>, was born at Dowanhill, Glasgow, on 20 February 1844, the son of John Buchanan of Dowanhill (1807&#150;1876), a merchant, and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1899), the daughter of John Young of Rowmore, Dunbartonshire. Both his parents came from prosperous Glasgow merchant families. Buchanan was the second of four sons, of whom the eldest died young and the third, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45596/', "Thomas Ryburn Buchanan (1846&#150;1911)")</script>, became a member of parliament. There were also four daughters. Buchanan was educated at Glasgow high school and the University of Glasgow. He graduated MA in 1863 and then spent several years abroad, studying chemistry at Marburg, Leipzig, and Bonn and at the &Eacute;cole de M&eacute;decine in Paris (1867), before becoming assistant to Alexander Crum Brown, professor of chemistry at Edinburgh. His investigation into the hydrolysis of chloroacetic acid to glycolic acid (1871) was subsequently exploited by J. H. van't Hoff in his establishment of the laws of chemical kinetics.<br>
<br>In 1872 Buchanan was selected to join the scientific team sailing round the world in HMS <i>Challenger</i> (1872&#150;6) in the first major scientific study of the sea. His work both during the voyage and subsequently was pivotal to the development of oceanography. He studied the chemistry of the sea in its broadest sense, contributing to all the main divisions of marine science. Observations on the chemical and physical properties of sea water, on sea ice, and on marine deposits begun in the <i>Challenger</i> formed the basis for much of his later research. However, his best known observation during the voyage was the discovery that T. H. Huxley's <i>Bathybius</i>, thought by many to be a primitive life form inhabiting the ocean floor, was in fact an inorganic residue created when sediment samples were stored in alcohol. He further showed that the black &#145;rocks&#146; the <i>Challenger</i> dredged from the sea-bed were in fact concretions of manganese and other metals.<br>
<br>After the expedition's return Buchanan continued working on problems in oceanography and related sciences for the rest of his career. However, apart from a brief spell as lecturer in geography at Cambridge (1889&#150;93) he held no official position. He had a substantial private income and lived in the family home in Edinburgh until his mother died in 1899, subsequently moving to London. Both houses were equipped with a private laboratory but for twenty years Buchanan also occupied rooms in Christ's College, Cambridge. He appreciated the social side of college life and freedom to work unhindered by formal society obligations or, latterly, by teaching commitments. Some people found him &#145;cold and distant&#146;  (Mill, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 50) but in Cambridge he was welcomed as a gifted conversationalist. Although reserved and sensitive in disposition, he was a man of strong family feeling, and generous in case of need. He inspired great affection among a small circle of close friends and colleagues, some in the upper echelons of European society. Chief among these was Prince Albert I of Monaco, who also devoted a substantial part of his life and fortune to the study of oceanography.<br>
<br>Buchanan listed travel as his recreation in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span>. During the 1880s and 1890s he made a number of scientific voyages in cable ships and in Prince Albert's yachts. He was often in South America, looking after family property in Argentina, and in 1885 journeyed on up the Pacific coast. In Europe he visited friends and, increasingly, spas, but whatever the reason for the journey he employed his habit of observation, on his special fields of scientific interest if appropriate, if not, on other topics. A trip to Switzerland in 1893, for example, intended as a rest-cure, led to a long-term study of glaciers.<br>
<br>Buchanan's scientific researches ultimately covered oceanography, chemistry, limnology, and meteorology. While many arose out of his work in the <i>Challenger</i>, he also identified important new areas of interest. He was an outstanding experimentalist; during the <i>Challenger's</i> voyage he had devoted much attention to methods of measuring the temperature and specific gravity of sea water, devising a stopcock water bottle (named after him) and piezometers for measuring pressure and temperature in the ocean depths. His observational work was admired by contemporaries for its painstaking accuracy, but it was felt that his preoccupation with detail prevented him from publishing his results fully. A colleague wrote: &#145;I never knew a man who did so much work and wrote so little about it&#146;  (Mill, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 50). Nevertheless, Buchanan still published over a hundred scientific papers. Late in life he collected the most important in three volumes, published by Cambridge University Press: <span class="italic">Scientific Papers, vol. 1</span> (1913), <span class="italic">Comptes rendus of Observations and Reasoning</span> (1917), and the best known, <span class="italic">Accounts Rendered of Work done and Things Seen</span> (1919).<br>
<br>Buchanan helped write the narrative of the <i>Challenger</i> but because of a dispute with the Treasury only part of the expedition's chemical results&#151;&#145;Specific gravity of samples of ocean water&#146;&#151;appeared under his name in the official report. This contribution included the first global chart of the surface salinity of the oceans. He continued to work extensively on the chemistry of marine deposits and on the formation and distribution of oceanic and littoral manganese concretions, his interest in this topic being augmented by his discovery in 1878 of manganese nodules in Loch Fyne, while dredging off the west coast of Scotland in his specially built steam yacht, <i>Mallard</i>. He also investigated the seasonal variation of temperature in the sea and in lakes, together with their freezing and the nature of ice and brines. His findings, in both fresh and salt water, contributed to the concept of thermocline formation, and influenced later development of ideas on the thermohaline circulation of the ocean. He was also probably the first person to draw attention to the oxygen minimum layer in the ocean.<br>
<br>Observing cold water off the west coast of South America in 1885 Buchanan concluded that this could not be due to a surface current from the south polar regions, as had been previously supposed, but was due to upwelling of cold deep water off a windward shore, and further that this occurred in similar sites elsewhere. Another feature he recognized to be of great significance in ocean circulation was the equatorial undercurrent, discovered off the African coast when he was in the cable ship <i>Buccaneer</i> in 1886. The same voyage revealed the existence of huge submarine canyons in continental shelves. On an earlier trip, in the <i>Dacia</i>, Buchanan had drawn scientific attention to the existence of isolated seamounts rising from the deep-sea floor. Lack of resources meant that it was not until the second half of the twentieth century that these phenomena were more widely investigated and their full significance understood.<br>
<br>As Buchanan was meticulous to a fault and lacked the ability to relinquish old projects as he added new ones, the internal pressures on him grew. From the 1890s onwards he increasingly complained of ill health which appears to have been at least partly stress-related, and in 1912 he suffered a nervous breakdown. The outbreak of war in 1914 exacerbated his depression and he sold his London house and went to North America, only returning after hostilities were over. His final years were spent as a recluse, the enthusiasm of his youthful personality transformed into profound pessimism about the destructive power of modern civilization, both towards itself and on indigenous peoples and habitats.<br>
<br>Buchanan became a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1870 and was awarded its Keith prize in 1887, in which year he was also elected fellow of the Royal Society of London. He was an active member of other scientific societies and the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, which he had helped found, awarded him its gold medal in 1911. He held honorary memberships of the Berlin Gesellschaft f&uuml;r Erdkunde (Geographical Society) and of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Helv&eacute;tique des Sciences (Swiss Natural Sciences Society). Prince Albert made him a vice-president of the Comit&eacute; de Perfectionnement of the Institut Oc&eacute;anographique in Paris and conferred on him the order of St Charles of Monaco. Buchanan never married. He died suddenly in London on 16 October 1925.<br>
