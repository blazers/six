<span class="headword">Stapleton,  Miles</span>, first Lord Stapleton  (<em>d.</em> 1314), <span class="occ">baron and administrator</span>, was the son of Sir Nicholas Stapleton (<i>d</i>. by 1296), a royal justice, and Margery, daughter and heir of Miles Basset of Haddlesey. He married first, before 1286, Isabel (Sybil), daughter and coheir of Ladereyna, wife of John Belewe, whose inheritance also included a share in the land and possessions of Peter de Brus; she died before August 1301 and he married as his second wife Joan, daughter of Peter Tyndale. Little is known about his early life. He was in Scotland with Roger (III) Mowbray, Lord Mowbray, in 1291 on royal business, and fought in Gascony in 1295, during which time the constable of Richmond Castle was ordered to provide suitable accommodation in the castle for his wife and household. He served in Scotland at Falkirk in 1298 under Henry de Lacy, earl of Lincoln, and at the siege of Caerlaverock in 1300. In the same year Stapleton accompanied the earl on his journey to the papal court, and is described as a knight of his household. From 1302 until at least 1307 he was constable of Knaresborough Castle and forest and keeper of Boroughbridge manor. Some time after September 1303 he was appointed to Prince Edward's household and was, in the prince's own words, &#145;charged by the king&#146;  (Tout, <span class="italic">Admin. hist.</span>, 2.175) with its direction as steward, a post he held until 1306. In 1305 the prince received a request from Lacy to allow Stapleton to manage the earl's household while he was away on a mission to the papal court, but Edward replied that he dared not do so without the king's permission. In March 1305 Stapleton was appointed with Sir John Byroun to investigate homicides and robberies in Lancashire, but their duties were taken over by the April trailbaston commissioners.<br>
<br>On Edward II's accession in July 1307 Stapleton transferred to the royal household, and was steward from 9 August of that year until he was replaced in March 1308, during which time he travelled with Edward II to Boulogne for the king's marriage to Isabella, daughter of Philippe IV in January 1308. In 1307 he had received the keepership of the manor of Burstwick in Holderness and of the town of Kingston upon Hull, but in 1308 he was forced to surrender the former to the king's favourite, Piers Gaveston. As bailiff of Holderness Stapleton was asked to send military stores to Berwick to help the king's forces in Scotland. He also received commissions concerning the banks and dykes of the River Humber, and the fresh waters in Holderness and Hull. He was summoned for military service against the Scots in 1311 and 1312, and to the parliaments of 1313, and by virtue of the latter is deemed to have became a baron. Later in the same year he and his family were pardoned, as adherents of Thomas, earl of Lancaster, for any involvement in the death of Gaveston.<br>
<br>In the years after his father's death, which had occurred by 1296, Stapleton was able to consolidate the family's landed base in Yorkshire. Already in 1291 Roger Mowbray, a neighbouring landowner, granted him 16 acres of waste at Hovingham, while during the <i>quo warranto</i> investigations in the Yorkshire eyre of 1293&#150;4 Stapleton successfully maintained his right to free warren in all his demesne lands of Stapleton, Kirkby Fleetham, Wath, North Duffield, Owstwick, and East and Middle Haddlesey. In 1297 he also held lands at Wimbleton in Yorkshire. By 1300 Stapleton possessed lands worth at least &pound;40 in the county, and was usually styled knight in commissions. In 1303 he was allowed to exchange lands in Middle Haddlesey with the templars for other lands there. In 1309 Roger Mowbray's son, John (I) Mowbray, granted Stapleton 26 acres of woodland in Hovingham Manor, and in 1310 also conveyed to him for life 40 acres of land and meadow there. Stapleton experienced some friction with Walter Fauconberg, who shared lands in common with Marmaduke Thwing and the beneficiaries of Ladereyna Belewe, both Stapleton and Thwing complaining in May 1313 that Walter had wrongly taken wreck of the sea at Coatham, Marske, and Wilton in Yorkshire. Described as overlord at Stapleton in 1307, he also held for life a marsh in Southwark, a messuage in West Haddlesey and Duffield and the manors of North Morton in Berkshire (which he held as a retainer of the earl of Pembroke), Kentmere in Westmorland, Carleton by Snaith and Wath in Yorkshire, together with a third of the manor of West Haddlesey.<br>
<br>Miles Stapleton was killed at the battle of Bannockburn on 24 June 1314. He was survived by his second wife, Joan, though she too had died by September 1316. Both wives were buried in the Dominican friary at York. His brother, Gilbert Stapleton, king's clerk, was in 1317 designated archdeacon of Berkshire and a prebendary of Salisbury Cathedral. Stapleton's children from his first marriage were Nicholas (1286&#150;<i>c</i>.1343), whose son and grandson died within a year of each other (1372&#150;3); Gilbert (<i>d</i>. 1321), who married Agnes (or Matilda), daughter of Brian Fitzalan, and had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26302/', "Miles Stapleton (d. 1364)")</script>; and Elizabeth, who was still alive in November 1333. He had one daughter, Joan, from his second marriage. In 1299 Stapleton endowed the celebration of masses by two chaplains in the chapel of St Nicholas at North Morton, and in 1310 he endowed a single chaplain to celebrate in St John's Chapel at East Haddlesey.<br>
