<span class="headword">Potter,  Joseph</span>  (<em>c.</em>1756&#150;1842), <span class="occ">architect</span>, began his career as a joiner in Lichfield. He was employed by James Wyatt as clerk of works in the restoration of Lichfield Cathedral (1787&#150;93) and later at Hereford Cathedral (1790&#150;93) and St Michael's Church, Coventry (1794); and in 1794 he succeeded Wyatt as cathedral architect at Lichfield, a position he held for the rest of his life. In this capacity he was responsible for the repair of the spires, the choir and transepts, and other structural work, but he made few major alterations to the fabric. Through Wyatt's influence he carried out work in the Gothic style at Plas Newydd, the Anglesey seat of the first marquess of Anglesey, in 1793&#150;9 and again in 1805&#150;9 and 1823&#150;6; he was subsequently employed by Lord Anglesey to design the new baths and assembly rooms in Caernarfon (<i>c</i>.1822&#150;1828).<br>
<br>From 1797 until his death Potter was county surveyor of Staffordshire, and he also served for many years as engineer to the Grand Trunk Canal Company. His official commissions include the lunatic asylum (1818; dem.) and house of correction (1832&#150;3) at Stafford and two graceful cast-iron bridges over the River Trent, at Alrewas (1823&#150;4) and Armitage (1829&#150;30). He also ran a successful private practice in Staffordshire and Warwickshire, designing several schools, parsonages, and country houses in the Tudor&#150;Gothic style, of which he was an able if not a very original practitioner. But his main claim to fame comes from his involvement in the design of St Mary's College for training Roman Catholic priests at New Oscott, near Birmingham (1835&#150;8).<br>
<br>Apparently a Catholic himself, Potter was employed by the Catholic priest John Kirk, missioner at Lichfield, to design or extend Catholic churches at Tamworth (1829&#150;30), Newport, Shropshire (1832), and Lichfield itself (1835) in the wake of Catholic emancipation. Through Kirk he was introduced to Thomas Walsh, vicar apostolic of the midland district from 1826, and it was Walsh who conceived the idea of Oscott as a focal point of the Catholic revival. Potter's buildings at New Oscott were competently designed in the &#145;collegiate Gothic&#146; style favoured for such establishments throughout the nineteenth century; in 1839, however, he was superseded by that most passionate of Gothic revivalists A. W. N. Pugin, and it was Pugin who was responsible for the chancel and decoration of the chapel, as well as the gate lodges.<br>
<br>Potter was essentially a provincial builder&#150;architect in the eighteenth-century mould. He spent his whole working life in Lichfield; he became a city councillor in 1835 and died there in St John's Street on 18 August 1842. He had three sons: Robert (<i>c</i>.1795&#150;1854), who established an architectural practice in Sheffield; Joseph (<i>c</i>.1797&#150;1875), who took over his father's practice in Lichfield; and James (1801&#150;1857), a civil engineer. His pupils included the Lichfield architect Thomas Johnson (1794&#150;1865).<br>
