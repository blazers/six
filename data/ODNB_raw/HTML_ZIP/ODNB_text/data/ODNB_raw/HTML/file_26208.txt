<span class="headword">Stafford,  Humphrey</span>, earl of Devon  (<em>c.</em>1439&#150;1469), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the only son of William Stafford (<i>d</i>. 1450) and Katherine Chidiock. These Staffords were cadets of the earls of Stafford who advanced in the west country from the late fourteenth century by marrying heiresses in each generation. In 1412 Humphrey's great-grandfather Sir Humphrey Stafford (<i>d</i>. 1413) of Hook (Dorset) and Southwick in North Bradley (Wiltshire) had lands assessed at &pound;570, half in Dorset and the rest largely in Somerset and Wiltshire. More accrued from the marriage of Humphrey's grandfather Sir Humphrey &#145;of the silver hand&#146; (<i>d</i>. 1442), whose grandson, another Humphrey Stafford, esquire (senior), inherited the whole but died childless in 1461: Humphrey Stafford, esquire (junior), afterwards earl of Devon, was his heir. (His cousin the heir apparent, Avice, daughter of his uncle Sir Richard Stafford and wife of James Butler, earl of Wiltshire, had died in 1457.)<br>
<br>Humphrey &#145;of the silver hand&#146; had five sons, of whom William was the youngest. William's wife, Katherine, was coheir and eventually sole heir of Sir John Chidiock, another major west country landowner, but she outlived both husband and son. William Stafford was killed by Cade's rebels in 1450, when his (unknown) lands were granted to family custodians (including his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26209/', "Archbishop John Stafford")</script>) during Humphrey Stafford's minority. Katherine's own lands destined her son to be a leading member of the Somerset and Dorset gentry; he became the largest landowner in Dorset on 7 July 1461 on the death of his cousin of Hook; it is not clear when it became apparent he would succeed. It is not known when he married the heiress, Isabel (<i>d</i>. 1489), daughter of Sir John Barre.<br>
<br>In the late 1450s it may be that Humphrey Stafford was attached to his Lancastrian kinsman the earl of Wiltshire. Certainly Lord Audley was, with whom he was sent in 1460 to relieve the garrison of Gu&icirc;nes. Bad weather drove them into Calais, where both were captured by the rebel Yorkists and both converted to the Yorkist cause. Later in 1460, following the Yorkist assumption of power, described as of Enmore near Bridgwater, Stafford was elected MP for Somerset, was then appointed sheriff of Somerset and Dorset, and, by Bishop Waynflete, constable of Taunton Castle. He fought for the Yorkists at Mortimer's Cross near Wigmore (Shropshire) on 2 February 1461 and at Towton (on 29 March), when he was knighted. A host of offices culminated in his summons on 27 July 1461 to parliament as Lord Stafford of Southwick, a title that he had ample means to support.<br>
<br>Stafford's inheritance was concentrated in Somerset and Dorset, but it is clear that Edward IV's government saw him as the natural replacement not just of the earl of Wiltshire in Dorset but of the Courtenay earls of Devon further west. He overshadowed such other west country peers as lords Fitzwarine, Audley, and Dynham. On 20 February 1462 he was granted the core of the Courtenay estate in Devon: the three honours, castles, boroughs, and hundreds of Plympton, Okehampton, and Tiverton, and six other manors. These were regranted on 23 April 1464 (the day before his barony was reconferred by letter patent), again in 1467, and in 1468. In 1461 he was appointed steward of the duchy of Cornwall, constable of Bristol, keeper of the forests of Kingswood (Wiltshire), Fulwood (Somerset), and Gillingham (Dorset); in 1464 keeper of Dartmoor; and in 1465 warden of the stannaries. His constableship of Taunton was confirmed in 1465, when he also secured Edward IV's confirmation of his appointment by the king's mother as constable and keeper of Bridgwater and keeper of Petherton forest (Somerset). In 1467 he was granted the Courtenay manors of Exiland and Westyate and the fishery of the Exe (Devon); in 1468 the reversion of the foresterships of Exmoor and Neroche on the death of Lord Fitzwarine and the stewardship of Lord Zouche's lands in Dorset, Somerset, and Wiltshire; and on 17 May 1469, when he was created earl of Devon, he was granted five other manors and appurtenances in Devon and Cornwall forfeited by Henry Courtenay, who had been executed for treason earlier that year. Whether or not Courtenay's ruin could be attributed to Stafford's malicious coveting of his lands as alleged by the chronicler Warkworth, the earldom was the logical culmination of a decade's steady accumulation fostered by a king who needed a capable and reliable agent in the west.<br>
<br>Stafford, inevitably, was nominated to all sorts of commissions and actually served: he was no absentee landlord, and is recorded as feoffee, witness to charters, arbiter, and litigant. He was at Wells and Ilchester (Somerset) in 1462, at Malmesbury in 1465, at Bridport in 1465&#150;6, and at Salisbury on judicial business in 1466 and 1469, but he was most active further west. He presided over the stannary courts at Lostwithiel, Liskeard, and Trematon in 1465 and 1466, attended quarter sessions at Bodmin in 1467, and was at Barnstaple in 1468&#150;9, but it is the records of Exeter, the regional capital, that are most revealing of his dominance. Although he did not actually sit as JP, he received gifts of wine at quarter sessions on twenty-one occasions between 1462 and 1469. At such times, he apparently resided in the city. However his concern to acquire the chapel furniture and three bombards of the last Courtenay earl at Tiverton suggest that this castle was his principal seat. The codicils he added to his will in 1467 and later show how widespread his activities had been and how anxious he was to right the wrongs that he was conscious of committing.<br>
<br>Stafford's services were not confined to the west country. In 1461&#150;2 he served against the Scots and in 1468 he was treating with Brittany. In 1467 he witnessed both the tournament of Antoine, count of La Roche, the Bastard of Burgundy, and the transfer of the great seal from Archbishop Neville. He sat in parliament, in 1465 carrying provisos from the king's chamber to the clerk of parliament, and attended the royal council. In 1468, when he was identified by Warwick as one of the king's new favourites, he was nevertheless one of those with whom the earl was prepared to be reconciled, but in 1469 he was bracketed with Rivers, Pembroke, and his companion Audley in the earl's rebel manifesto as an evil councillor. Summoned by the king to oppose Robin of Redesdale, allegedly with 7000 men including an Exeter contingent, he disagreed with his fellow commander, the earl of Pembroke, and camped separately, thus facilitating the latter's defeat at Edgcote. Fleeing westwards, he was seized by the &#145;commons&#146;, who allowed him to add a codicil to his will, and was executed at Bridgwater on 17 August. Stafford was buried at Glastonbury Abbey. Since he died childless, his peerages died with him and his inheritances were disputed between his cousins.<br>
