<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Maplethorpe,  Cyril Wheatley</span>  (1898&#150;1983), <span class="occ">pharmaceutical manufacturer</span>, was born on 20 April 1898 at 68 Balfour Street, Drypool, Kingston upon Hull, the son of Jack Maplethorpe, a police constable, and his wife, Emeline Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Vesiter. He was educated at Hymers College, Hull, where he held a scholarship, before going on to study pharmacy at Chelsea College, London. Towards the end of the First World War, his education was briefly interrupted by service in the Royal Engineers, but after the war he entered the School of Pharmacy, at the Pharmaceutical Society, Bloomsbury Square, London, where he qualified as a pharmaceutical chemist in 1922. On 21 September 1925 he married Margery Bessie Pearce, in Hull. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>After a spell in the research laboratories and museum of the Pharmaceutical Society, in 1924 Maplethorpe joined the staff of Allen and Hanburys Ltd. The modern science-based pharmaceutical industry was then in its infancy, and many British firms were still locked in the Victorian world of the chemist and druggist, with its invalid and baby foods, and various tonics, embrocations, and laxatives. Allen and Hanburys, founded by Quakers in 1715 and famous for its milk foods, cod-liver oil, and surgical instruments, typified the traditional nature of the industry in the 1920s.<br>
<br>Maplethorpe joined Allen and Hanburys as a research chemist, but his organizational talents were soon recognized and in 1932 he was appointed manager at the firm's Ware factory. He was only the second technically qualified pharmacist to have worked there, so he brought with him some much needed technical expertise. In the 1930s he involved himself with research and product development and was responsible for Isogel, a traditional but profitable bulk laxative. But he was also increasingly aware that the days of the old galenicals and food products were numbered, and he slowly began to push the company towards a more scientific future. His appointment to the board as managing director in 1944 increased his influence. In the UK he enlarged the numbers of technical personnel and extended the firm's research interests; abroad he began rationalizing its wide-ranging subsidiaries. By the mid-1950s, Allen and Hanburys began to acquire a more modern look, with products that included antihistamines, antibiotics, and tranquillizers, besides more traditional items such as throat pastilles and Haliborange. In the summer of 1958 the company announced that its production of traditional drugs and galenicals would cease.<br>
<br>Unfortunately, Maplethorpe's reforms took place within a family-owned firm that was still very conservative. Faced by stronger British (and overseas) rivals and with low profitability, Allen and Hanburys was vulnerable. In 1958 it was bought by Glaxo Laboratories for &pound;633,000 and Maplethorpe's dream of running his own science-based pharmaceutical company ended. However, the take-over&#151;which he had helped negotiate&#151;involved no loss of prestige for Maplethorpe, who was elected to the Glaxo board. He and the Glaxo chairman, Sir Harry Jephcott, respected each other, and their views on the future of the industry coincided. Allen and Hanburys, therefore, entered the 1960s with a considerable degree of independence and Maplethorpe was free to pursue his plans for a research division at Ware with considerably more resources. In 1962, largely owing to his initiative, a new research director, David Jack, was appointed at Ware to spearhead a new and greatly expanded research programme.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Maplethorpe was intent on improving the professional standing of pharmacy, largely through his work at the Pharmaceutical Society. He was a member of its council from 1943 to 1967, chairman of its education committee from 1945 until 1962, and president of the society between 1963 and 1965. For services to pharmaceutical education he was awarded an honorary degree of MSc by Manchester University in 1958 and received the Pharmaceutical Society's charter gold medal in 1968. He was a founder member of the council of the School of Pharmacy and played a part in its transfer to the University of London in 1948. He was also a governor of Chelsea College. For his efforts to introduce a more rigorous pharmaceutical training in universities and elsewhere, Maplethorpe was described by David Jack as &#145;probably the most influential pharmacist of his generation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pharmaceutical Journal</span>, 231, 1983, 734).<br>
<br>Maplethorpe retired as the managing director of Allen and Hanburys in 1965 and left the Glaxo board in 1968. The research division at Ware under David Jack and others subsequently achieved spectacular success with science-based drugs, lifting Glaxo to a position among the world leaders in the industry by the late 1980s. Fortunately, Maplethorpe lived to see something of this transformation, in which he had played such a significant part.<br>
<br>Maplethorpe had considerable physical presence&#151;he was well over 6 feet tall&#151;and he could sometimes be intimidating to subordinates. However, he was a humane man, whose early Congregationalist beliefs had been replaced by a firm socialism. Unusually for a leading businessman, he was a supporter of the Labour Party. Much of his personal estate was directed into research fellowships at Chelsea College and the School of Pharmacy and, through the Margery Maplethorpe Trust, he funded old people's homes in Hertford. His estate at death was valued at &pound;765,225.<br>
<br>After a stroke at his home, Stoneyfield, St Mary's Lane, Hertingfordbury, Maplethorpe died in Hertford Hospital on 26 October 1983, and was cremated at Harlow crematorium. He was survived by his wife, who died in 1995, having been a substantial benefactor, in her husband's memory, of St Hugh's College, Oxford.<br>
