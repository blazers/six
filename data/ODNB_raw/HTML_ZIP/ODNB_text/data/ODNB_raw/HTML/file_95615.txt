<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Peers,  Donald Rhys Hubert</span>  (1909&#150;1973), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born at 106 College Street, Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, on 10 July 1908, the youngest son of five children born to Frank Peers and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rees. The family moved to the neighbouring village of Betws when Donald was five, and it was there that he lived until he left home somewhat abruptly on the eve of his sixteenth birthday.<br>
<br>Peers's parents met and married in America in 1894. His father, who was born and brought up in the village of Ash near Canterbury, Kent, was employed in a Chicago stockyard after an adventurous perambulation that had taken him first to Africa and then America. His mother, a native of Ystalyfera in the Swansea valley, had travelled to Hot Springs, Missouri, in the hope of finding a cure for the rheumatoid arthritis that plagued her. After the birth of their second son they returned to Wales, first to Mary's home town, where Frank found employment in the printing works of her father, Ebenezer Rees (printers of the radical Welsh newspaper <span class="italic">Llais Llafur</span>, &#145;Voice of labour&#146;). His father had various jobs in his life but Donald Peers was most often referred to as the son of a colliery worker.<br>
<br>Peers's parents had joined the Plymouth Brethren during their stay in America and remained devoutly faithful to it throughout their lives; Frank Peers became an elder and lay preacher. Any domestic severity that came from the religious proclivities of Donald's parents was tempered by his ready access to the popular entertainment made available to him by two of his uncles&#151;Elwyn, who ran the local cinema, the Coliseum Theatre in Ystalyfera, and David, who owned both a piano and a gramophone: two items prohibited from the Peers household, but which decisively influenced the path that he was to follow.<br>
<br>At Amman Valley grammar school in Ammanford Peers was neither distinguished nor dull, but his aptitude for theatrical performance was noted and mildly encouraged by one of his English teachers. At sixteen he absconded from home in company with two itinerant house painters whom he befriended when they were painting Ammanford railway station. He was briefly at sea as a mess steward, but it was while he was working as a painter in Richmond, Yorkshire, that he met Gertrude Mary (Marie) Thomson (1907&#150;2000), whom he married in Knaresborough, Yorkshire, on 7 June 1930; their daughter Sheila was born in 1931. The marriage lasted until 1953 when they separated.<br>
<br>Peers was already gaining engagements as a music hall singer in the late 1920s, having won a Fred Karno talent contest during a period when he was painting the barracks at Aldershot: he appeared in partnership with Miriam Ferris on BBC radio in January 1928. This followed an audition in which he sang &#145;In a Shady Nook by a Babbling Brook&#146;, the song that was to project him to stardom two decades later (words and music written in 1927 by the American vaudeville artistes Harry Pease and E. G. Nelson respectively). In the 1930s, by which time he had acquired the ability to accompany himself on the ukulele, he enjoyed success as an itinerant music hall entertainer, sometimes billed as Smiling Donald Peers.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Peers was a clerk in the Royal Army Service Corps. Discharged in 1944, he returned to show business as a variety headliner in Moss Empires' variety tours. It was after the war that his recording of &#145;In a Shady Nook by a Babbling Brook&#146; made him the first post-war singing sensation in the UK. His performance of the song had an effect on the female population that was unprecedented for a British recording artist and was followed by other hit recordings. On the strength of this celebrity he was contracted for a weekly radio series as the Cavalier of Song, and was soon the first popular music singer to give a solo concert at the Royal Albert Hall; in 1950 he starred at the royal variety performance.<br>
<br>Peers's popularity was challenged in the mid-1950s by the introduction of new modes of popular musical entertainment and he spent four years in Australia. On his return he found that the fame he once enjoyed was entirely eclipsed, so he once again relentlessly toured the clubs and seaside resorts of the north of England; but in February 1969, to the surprise of many, he re-entered the charts with &#145;Please Don't Go&#146;, an adaptation of the &#145;Barcarolle&#146; from Offenbach's <span class="italic">Tales of Hoffmann</span>. This was followed by other minor hits before he released the prophetic &#145;Give Me One More Chance&#146;, his last song to enter the UK top forty. By this time he had also appeared in several films, but none made sufficient impact for him to be regarded as anything other than a singer.<br>
<br>A few years before the end of his life Peers, who had long had bouts of ill health, sustained a serious spinal injury when he fell through an opening on a stage in Australia. This required him to wear a steel brace and he was soon wheelchair-bound and forced to move from his house in St John's Road, Hove, Sussex, to a nearby nursing home, at 24 Harrington Road, Brighton, where he died of multiple myelomatosis on 9 August 1973. His body was cremated at the Down crematorium, Brighton, where his ashes remained.<br>
<br>The level of Peers's success in the years after the Second World War is difficult to overstate. While his most flourishing period was between 1935 and 1955, he surprised many by reviving his popularity after rock and roll had transformed and captured British popular music culture. When he returned to the hit parade in 1969 he co-existed with Frank Sinatra's &#145;My Way&#146;, but more incredibly with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, often to the chagrin of the popular music press: a respected music critic castigated Peers as a &#145;kindly dinosaur&#146; who wandered &#145;among the debris of showbiz's mythological golden era&#146;  (&#145;Comeback for Peers&#146;, <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, 16 March 1969). This missed the point. Two features operated persistently in Peers's favour. First, in the idiom to which he subscribed, he was a singer of real competence. His voice carried strength, authority, and a sensitivity to the nuance of lyrics that placed him above most other British balladeers. He claimed that his mentors were the crooner Al Jolson and Randolph Sutton, the last and one of the most elegant of the British music hall &#145;swell&#146; artists. It is possible to identify traces of these influences, but he was more often compared to Bing Crosby. However, the truth is that Peers was distinctive: his relaxed mode of delivery obscured the accuracy of his musicianship&#151;untutored but clearly present. And he believed in the potency of the type of music he sang, and this integrity was transmitted simply but powerfully to his audiences. Theirs was not a trivial and unqualified adoration for a sexual idol: Peers had the rare ability to touch audiences not as a mass group but as a collection of individuals, and many, of more than one generation, gave testimony to this phenomenon.<br>
<br>Peers was suave, always elegantly dressed, good-looking, and good-natured. As evidenced by commentary about him and by his 1951 autobiography <span class="italic">Pathway</span>, he was a pragmatic individual who was never consumed or disfigured by the celebrity that was periodically conferred upon him. He endured financial and physical hardships, but took the rough with the smooth and sang lines like &#145;Powder your face with sunshine&#146; with total and genuine conviction.<br>
