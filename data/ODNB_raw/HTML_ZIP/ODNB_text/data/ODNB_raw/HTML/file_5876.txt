<span class="headword">Colepeper,  John</span>, first Baron Colepeper  (<em>bap. </em>1600, <em>d.</em> 1660), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Wigsell Manor in Salehurst, Sussex, and baptized at Salehurst on 17 August 1600. He was the second but eldest surviving son of Thomas Colepeper (<i>d</i>. 1613) and Anne Slaney (<i>d</i>. 1602), and nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66941/', "Mary Weld, Lady Weld")</script>. He may have studied at Peterhouse, Cambridge (1611), and at Hart Hall, Oxford (1616), as well as at the Middle Temple (1617). It seems that he then saw military service abroad; he was knighted on 14 January 1621. After his first marriage, to Philippa Snelling (<i>d</i>. 1630) on 29 October 1628, he settled at Hollingbourne in Kent and was a justice of the peace in Kent by 1638. After Philippa's death in the autumn of 1630 he married his cousin, Judith Colepeper (<i>bap</i>. 1606, <i>d</i>. 1691?), on 12 January 1631.<h2>
<a name="TheLongParliament"></a>The Long Parliament</h2>Colepeper represented Rye, Sussex, in the Short Parliament and Kent in the Long Parliament. On 9 November 1640 he presented a petition from Kent and made a lengthy statement of the &#145;grievances of the Church and Common-wealth&#146;. The most important of these he listed as &#145;the greater increase of papists&#146;, &#145;the obtruding and countenancing of many divers new ceremonies in matters of religion&#146;, &#145;the new canons&#146;, &#145;military charges&#146;, &#145;the heavy Tax of ship-mony&#146;, and lastly the monopolists, &#145;the leeches that have suck'd the Common-wealth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sir John Culpeper his Speech in Parliament Concerning the Grievances of the Church and Common-Wealth</span>, 1641, 1&#150;4). On 1 December he urged &#145;that an act may bee drawen against the growth of poperie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, ed. Notestein, 91). On 8 February 1641 he strongly opposed the committing of the London root-and-branch petition, and the previous week had referred to bishops as &#145;maine columnes of the realme&#146;  (ibid., 315). He supported the attainder of Strafford and when, on 3 May, the first army plot was revealed to the Commons, he immediately moved &#145;for the remonstrance and peticon of rights to be forthwith read, and then to goe to the lordes and by that we may try the effeccon of the kinge&#146;  (diary of Sir Simonds D'Ewes, BL, Harleian MS 477, fol. 28<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Colepeper's desire to preserve episcopacy was again evident on 11 June when he moved that the statement in the preamble to the root-and-branch bill that &#145;the present government of the Church had been by long experience an hinderance to the full reformation of religion and to the civill state&#146; be rephrased &#145;by late experience&#146;. He believed that &#145;the grievances had growne from the abuse of the goverment and not from the goverment it selfe&#146;  (diary of Sir Simonds D'Ewes, BL, Harleian MS 164, fol. 217<i>r</i>). He was appalled at the growing threat of popular violence against the church during the summer of 1641, and on 1 September brought forward a resolution in defence of the prayer book. Throughout the summer and autumn he gradually drew closer to Charles I, whom he regarded as less of a danger to existing constitutional and ecclesiastical structures than his leading opponents. Colepeper advocated a grant to the king of tonnage and poundage for three years and worked intensively to get this passed before the debate on episcopacy was concluded, in the belief that this might enable Charles to dissolve the parliament. His strategy was linked to a proposal for a new book of rates, but this was abandoned as financially unworkable.<br>
<br>In November Colepeper protested against the grand remonstrance, arguing that &#145;all remonstrances should bee addressed to the king and not to the people, because hee only can redresse our greevances&#146;  (H. Verney, ed., <span class="italic">Notes of Proceedings in the Long Parliament &hellip; by Sir Ralph Verney</span>, CS, 1st ser., 31, 1845, 122). He similarly opposed the militia ordinance on the grounds that it would &#145;take the King's lawfull power from him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, ed. Coates, 303). On 2 January 1642 Charles appointed Colepeper a privy councillor and chancellor of the exchequer. Colepeper remained deeply committed to constitutional propriety and was embarrassed when the king, without his knowledge, attempted to arrest five members of the Commons and one member of the Lords on 4 January 1642. A desire to prove the king's integrity probably explains why he advised Charles to assent to the <span class="roman">Bishops Exclusion Bill</span> and the <span class="roman">Impressment Bill</span>. When, on 1 April, Sir Peter Wentworth queried whether Charles could be trusted any longer, Colepeper &#145;wondered that any man should dare to speak such language within these walls&#146;  (Coates, Young, and Snow, 2.115). On 19 May he acted as a teller against a clause that the king's oath bound him to accept bills passed by both houses for the good of the kingdom. Later that month Colepeper, who had earlier advised Charles to remove to the north of England, joined the king at York.<h2>
<a name="Thecivilwar"></a>The civil war</h2>During the months immediately preceding the outbreak of the civil war Colepeper regularly collaborated with Falkland and Hyde in drafting the king's responses to the houses' messages and declarations. This polemical activity proved highly effective and culminated in the king's <span class="italic">Answer to the XIX Propositions</span>, which he and Falkland composed in June 1642. This presented a classic defence of royal government within the law, and asserted that the houses' terms formed &#145;a great chain &hellip; by which our just, antient, regal power is endeavour'd to be fetch'd down to the ground&#146;; they thus directly threatened &#145;the antient, equal, happy, well-poised, and never enough commended constitution of the government of this kingdom&#146;. The <span class="italic">Answer</span> argued that a &#145;regulated monarchy&#146; was essential to &#145;preserve the laws in their force, and the subjects in their liberties and properties&#146; and this commitment extended to preserving the existing features of the church &#145;as they are here established by law&#146;  (J. Rushworth, <span class="italic">Historical Collections of Private Passages of State</span>, 8 vols., 1680&#150;1701, 4.725&#150;35).<br>
<br>Three days after the king raised his standard at Nottingham he reluctantly agreed to send Colepeper, together with the earls of Southampton and Dorset and Sir William Uvedale, to inform the houses of his &#145;constant and earnest care to preserve the public peace&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 2.304). However, although the four were permitted to deliver this message, the houses ordered them to withdraw from London immediately. Colepeper charged with Prince Rupert at the battle of Edgehill and was among those who urged the king to stand his ground. He was installed as master of the rolls on 28 January 1643, and his reluctance to surrender the chancellorship of the exchequer until 22 February caused a rift with Hyde, who had been promised the office. Colepeper sat in the Oxford parliament and soon found himself at odds with more hardline royalists over whether to pursue further talks with the houses. In the king's council he likewise urged that propositions be sent to Westminster. This did not endear him to more hawkish figures such as Digby and Prince Rupert, and there was considerable resentment at his creation as Baron Colepeper of Thoresway on 21 October 1644.<br>
<br>Colepeper served as one of the king's commissioners at the treaty of Uxbridge (January&#150;February 1645). The following March, Charles appointed him to the prince of Wales's council, together with Hyde, and sent them to the west of England. Hyde, Colepeper, and the rest of the prince's council moved to Jersey in mid-April 1646, but when the prince set sail for France on 26 June Colepeper alone accompanied him. Throughout the mid-1640s Colepeper hoped to secure aid from Scotland, and to this end was prepared to make greater religious concessions than Hyde, and many other royalists, could accept. In September 1646, writing jointly with Henry Jermyn, he denied that episcopacy was &#145;jure divino exclusive&#146;, and together they told the king that &#145;the question in short is whether you will chuse to be a King of Presbitery or no King&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Clarendon 91, fols. 35<i>v</i>&#150;36<i>r</i>). Such views prompted Hyde to beg him not to let &#145;the landmarkes bee removed, nor pillars upon which the fabrique relyes bee taken away&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Clarendon 29, fol. 55<i>v</i>), while the king &#145;never &hellip; much esteemed&#146; Colepeper &#145;in religion&#146;  (Bruce, 30), and even told Sir William Davenant that he thought &#145;Culpeper had no religion&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 4.206). Equally, in another letter written jointly with Jermyn, Colepeper urged the king not to sacrifice his military powers, arguing that &#145;if you part with the militia, and place [it] in the Parlament as is desyred you will thereby consent to change monarchy into aristocracy&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Clarendon 91, fol. 36<i>r</i>). By this time Colepeper had suffered considerably for his royalist allegiance. On 22 January 1644 he was formally disabled, as a royalist, from sitting in parliament, and on 9 February the Commons ordered that Colepeper's estate was to be sequestrated and his goods sold. On 28 July 1644 the committee of the advance of money assessed him at &pound;2000.<br>
<br>During the summer and autumn of 1647 Colepeper encouraged Sir John Berkeley's mission to England to promote negotiations between the king and the army. The following year, when part of the parliamentarian fleet revolted, Colepeper accompanied the prince to sea and was widely blamed for the failure of the expedition to achieve anything. After the prince and Colepeper returned to The Hague the latter's long-standing animosity with Prince Rupert flared up again. He vehemently opposed Rupert's nomination of Sir Robert Walsh as an agent for the sale of prize goods, and during one council meeting even threatened to fight Rupert. A few days later, on 23 October 1648, Walsh violently attacked Colepeper in the streets and was banished from court.<h2>
<a name="Career16491660andrelationswithEdwardHyde"></a>Career, 1649&#150;1660, and relations with Edward Hyde</h2>After the execution of Charles I, royal counsels were for a while dominated by the &#145;Louvre&#146; group, of which Colepeper, Jermyn, and Henrietta Maria were the most prominent members. Colepeper remained particularly keen to promote a rapprochement with the Scots, although he was anxious to secure alliances with other powers as well. He was deeply offended not to be chosen as ambassador to Spain in the spring of 1649, and the following year he was dispatched to Moscow to borrow money from the tsar. This mission proved highly successful. He was f&ecirc;ted in Moscow&#151;one meal consisted of a hundred dishes of meat&#151;and returned triumphantly in July 1650 with a loan of 20,000 roubles in corn and furs. However, with the king's defeat at Worcester the pro-Scottish activism of the Louvre group was discredited and thereafter its influence began to decline.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1652 Colepeper was sent to the Netherlands, then at war with the English Commonwealth, in the hope of securing armed assistance but by this time much of his influence as a royal counsellor had been eroded. An attempt to resurrect links with Scotland in May 1654 proved abortive, and a further symptom of his dwindling power came the following October when he urged Lord Percy &#145;to come to the King's Court for he needs helpe&#146;  (Warner, 2.113). From the mid-1650s onwards Colepeper was a much more marginal figure, and in April 1655 he professed himself &#145;a great stranger to all busines, especially designes in England, and was very seldom&#146; at court  (ibid., 2.252). The treaty of August 1654 between Cromwell and Mazarin required Colepeper's expulsion from French territory, and he apparently spent the rest of his exile in Flanders.<br>
<br>A few days after Cromwell's death Colepeper advised Hyde &#145;not [to] be over hasty in doing any thing in England&#146; and warned him against a premature move which would &#145;only serve to unite our ennemyes&#146;. Then followed this remarkably prescient passage:<blockquote>The person that my eye is cheefly on, as able alone to restore the King, and not absolutely avers to it, neither in his principles nor in his affections &hellip; is Monke, who commandeth absolutely at his devotion a better army &hellip; then that in England is, and in the King's quarrell can bringe with him the strength of Scotland, and soe protect the northerne countyes that he cannot faile of them in his march, the reputation whereof (if he declare) will as much give the will to the appearing of the King's party in the rest of England, as the drawing the army from the southerne, westerne and easterne countyes will give them the meanes to appeare in armes. Thus the worke will be certainly donne in spight of all opposition that can be apprehended, and the gaining of one man will alone make sure worke of the whole. (Bodl. Oxf., MS Clarendon 58, fols. 345<i>v</i>&#150;346<i>v</i>)</blockquote>Colepeper thus predicted with astonishing accuracy the chain of events which would lead to Charles II's restoration nearly two years later, and it was arguably the shrewdest insight of his political career.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1650s Colepeper's relationship with Hyde remained distinctly uneven. After the Restoration, Hyde claimed that although they were &#145;not thought to have the greatest kindness for each other, yet he knew he could agree with no other man so well in business, and was very unwilling [Colepeper] should be from the person of the King&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 5.37). Hyde described him as &#145;a man of great parts, a very sharp and present wit, and an universal understanding&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of &hellip; Clarendon</span>, 1.319). However, contemporaries frequently remarked on Hyde's poor relations with Colepeper; Lord Hatton for example thought Colepeper &#145;a sworne enemy to Sir E[dward] H[yde] even to death&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nicholas Papers</span>, 2.101). Yet by the later 1650s they appear to have been on increasingly friendly terms and in January 1658 Colepeper warmly congratulated Hyde on his appointment as lord chancellor. Both were agreed in opposing any plans for premature royalist insurrections within England. This did not, however, preclude negotiations with the French and Spanish monarchs, and in the autumn of 1659 Colepeper journeyed to Spain in a bid to gain some advantage for Charles from the treaty of the Pyrenees: he kept Hyde closely briefed throughout that trip. This growing closeness was reflected in Colepeper's appointment as chancellor of the exchequer in June 1660. However, he died only weeks later on 11 July, probably in London, and was buried at Hollingbourne. His estates were subsequently restored by a private act of parliament.<br>
<br>Hyde left a colourful portrait of Colepeper as of &#145;a rough nature, a hot head, and of great courage; which had engaged him in many quarrels and duels &hellip; a man of sharpness of parts, and volubility of language&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of &hellip; Clarendon</span>, 1.106). This accords with Sir Philip Warwick's statement that Colepeper &#145;had an eagerness or ferocity, that made him less sociable than his other collegues&#146;  (Warwick, 195). In matters of religion, Clarendon thought Colepeper:<blockquote>very indifferent; but more inclined to what was established, to avoid the accidents which commonly attend a change, without any motives from his conscience; which yet he kept to himself; and was well content to have it believed that the activity proceeded from thence. (<span class="italic">Life of &hellip; Clarendon</span>, 1.107)</blockquote>This subtly nuanced account catches both the lack of an unshakeable conscientious commitment to the Church of England that both Hyde and the king had lamented in Colepeper during the later 1640s, and also the visceral attachment to established institutions that was characteristic of so many royalists.<br>
