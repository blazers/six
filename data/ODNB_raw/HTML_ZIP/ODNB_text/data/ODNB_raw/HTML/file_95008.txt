<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Leitch,  Archibald</span>  (1865&#150;1939), <span class="occ">engineer and architect</span>, was born on 27 April 1865 at 1 Comleypark Street, Glasgow, the fourth of six children of Archibald Leitch (1830&#150;1907), a blacksmith, and Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kent (1833&#150;1911). In 1876 he won a place at Hutchesons' Boys' Grammar School, an institution noted for its severity but also for promoting the interests of talented working-class boys. From there he graduated in 1880 or 1881 to Anderson's College, before joining Duncan Stewart engineers in 1882, where he qualified as a draughtsman. In 1887 Leitch followed the path of many young Glaswegians by going to sea, during which time he trained as a marine engineer and visited India and South Africa. He then returned to Glasgow where&#151;on 10 June 1890 at St John's Church in the Gorbals&#151;he married Jessie Black (1866&#150;1950), daughter of James Black, dairyman. Late in that year he secured a senior position in the drawing office of another engineering firm, Mirlees, Watson &amp; Co.<br>
<br>Over the ensuing years Leitch built up the contacts and experience that would eventually enable him to set up on his own account as a consulting engineer and factory architect in 1896, with an office at 40 St Enoch's Square, Glasgow, and a staff that soon rose to over thirty hands. He joined the freemasons, taught evening classes to raise money, and in 1897 gained associate membership of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers. Among his proposers and seconders were some of the leading names in Scottish engineering, including Sir William Renny Watson and Sir William Arrol. Also during this period Leitch became involved with Rangers, the football club he would support all his life, and whose Ibrox Park stadium, opened in Govan in 1887, lay within walking distance of McLellan Street, where Archibald and Jessie set up their first home and started a family in 1891. At a time when Glasgow's football was unrivalled in Britain, and therefore the world, in its intensity, stadiums, and attendance figures, Rangers was one of three dominant clubs, along with Queen's Park, a resolutely amateur club with strong establishment ties, and Celtic, formed by the Roman Catholic community in 1888.<br>
<br>As Rangers' lease on Ibrox Park came to an end in 1899, Leitch presented to members ambitious plans for a vast new stadium to be built on an adjoining site. Newspaper reports depicted Leitch as a persuasive speaker, using the latest form of magic lantern to project his drawings onto a screen. By such means Leitch won the contract. At its completion in April 1900 the new Ibrox Park had a capacity of just under 80,000, making it the largest purpose-built football ground in the world. Leitch took no fee for his work, but did take on paid commissions for two other football clubs, building grandstands for Kilmarnock and Sheffield United, in conjunction with the Clyde Structural Iron Company, with whom he worked closely for several years, mainly on industrial buildings for the home market and for export to the colonies.<br>
<br>As Rangers had hoped, the new Ibrox was selected to host the lucrative biennial Scotland v. England international, scheduled for 5 April 1902. But a day that started promisingly, with Leitch's portrait being published in the local press alongside widespread praise of the stadium, ended in disaster when a section of elevated wooden terracing gave way shortly after kick off, resulting in the deaths of twenty-six spectators. Leitch, who attended the match and assisted in the bloody aftermath of the collapse, was naturally devastated. During the subsequent trial of the timber merchant who had supplied the suspect terracing he was to suffer further when various engineers, Sir William Arrol included, publicly questioned his competence. Humiliatingly, also read out in court was a letter written by Leitch to Rangers begging them not to hire another architect lest this be seen as confirmation of his culpability. &#145;I need hardly say&#146;, he admitted in the letter, &#145;what unutterable anguish the accident caused me, surely the most unhappy eyewitness of all&#146;  (Inglis, 25).<br>
<br>As it transpired, no legal blame for the disaster was ascribed to any party. Indeed Leitch not only retained his position as adviser to Rangers but, remarkably, went on to establish himself as the world's first ever specialist designer of football grounds. Between 1899 and 1939 Leitch's company is known to have completed significant works for at least thirty British and Irish football clubs, as well as the English Rugby Union at Twickenham and at least two greyhound and speedway stadiums. It is thought that he also worked on lesser contracts for at least twelve further football clubs. No other architect or engineer of his generation came close to establishing a stadium portfolio of this magnitude. That Leitch managed to rebuild his reputation after the Ibrox disaster may be attributed to three main factors. First, according to what little evidence there is&#151;including his oral testimony at the disaster trial&#151;Leitch appears to have been confident, resilient, and also highly personable. One grandchild recalled that there always seemed to be laughter when he was around. In football club boardrooms this geniality won him many clients. Second, thanks to his experience in factory construction he was able to satisfy the two main demands of football clubs, that is to build speedily and cheaply. But third, and most important, instead of retreating after the Ibrox disaster and confining his efforts to factory work, Leitch went back to the drawing board and designed a new form of terracing that would ultimately become the standard at British football grounds.<br>
<br>Patented in 1906, but first erected in the summer of 1905 at two grounds in west London (Craven Cottage and Stamford Bridge), Leitch's tubular steel crush barriers would remain ubiquitous until at least the 1970s. His designs for the layout of terracing equally stood the test of time, so that when the British government first drew up its <span class="italic">Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds</span> in 1973 Leitch's calculations on terracing essentially formed the basis of the recommendations (even though, ironically, the guide's publication had been prompted by a second disaster at Ibrox Park, in 1971, on one of the exit stairs). Leitch also made a speciality of grandstand design. In particular his double-decker stands, where the upper tier overhung the lower, were characterized by a succession of distinctive criss-cross steel ties along the front of the main balcony truss. Seventeen Leitch stands of this design were built between 1907 and 1938, the best-known being at Goodison Park (for Everton Football Club), Ibrox Park, Roker Park (Sunderland), and Fratton Park (Portsmouth). Another Leitch trademark was to place a gable on the centre of the stand roof, with the club's name or emblem displayed on the front, facing the pitch.<br>
<br>Having established his credentials in Glasgow, the prospect of greater rewards south of the border prompted Leitch to move to Liverpool in 1908, and from there to London in 1915, where he set up offices in Victoria Street, Westminster (in the heartland of London's engineering world). But whereas each of his offices were modest, the scale and grandeur of Leitch's family homes, in Nicholas Road, Blundellsands (1908&#150;15), followed by Etruria House, on Lonsdale Road, Barnes (1915&#150;22), and during the mid-1920s on The Bourne, Southgate, in north London, suggest that his business both in football and industry thrived.<br>
<br>Despite designing some of the best-known football stadiums in the world, including Manchester United's Old Trafford (1910) and Arsenal's Highbury in 1913, Leitch remained virtually unknown to the sporting public during his lifetime, and received no recognition from the architectural or engineering establishments (by whom his work would have been dismissed as merely functional and utilitarian). Indeed after his death on 25 April 1939, in the semi-detached house he and Jessie had retired to four years earlier, at 113 Belmont Avenue, Cockfosters, London, only one brief obituary appeared. Published in the journal of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers, this made no mention at all of his football-related work.<br>
<br>Archibald Leitch was buried in the family plot in East Sheen cemetery, alongside two of his four daughters, who predeceased him aged twenty-two and twenty-nine respectively; a third daughter had died in infancy. His only son, Archibald Kent Leitch (1891&#150;1972), had become his business partner in the 1920s but, lacking his father's acumen, wound up the firm about 1955.<br>
<br>Following the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, which heralded the era of all-seater stadiums, most Leitch stands and terraces were demolished. However, his contribution to the staging and development of British football has since been acknowledged, and three surviving Leitch structures at two grounds have been listed. These are the Stevenage Road stand and Craven Cottage pavilion at Fulham Football Club (grade 2), dating from 1905, and the south stand at Ibrox Park (grade B), completed in 1928. One of his finest designs, the Trinity Road stand at Villa Park, Birmingham, completed in 1924, was controversially demolished in 2000.<br>
<br>Archibald Leitch has also gained posthumous recognition as an early exponent of reinforced concrete. Apart from two pioneering grandstands, at Liverpool Football Club's Anfield (1906) and Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough (1914)&#151;both extant in 2009 but covered by larger structures&#151;a Leitch factory built in 1903 in Polmadie, Glasgow, was granted grade A listed status in 1991. Known as the Sentinel Works and derelict since the 1980s, this has been identified as the first reinforced concrete building in Glasgow, and is the third oldest to survive in the United Kingdom.<br>
