<span class="headword">Cairncross,  John</span>  (1913&#150;1995), <span class="occ">spy</span>, was born on 25 July 1913, at Pine Cottage, Lesmahagow, Lanarkshire, the youngest of four boys and four girls of Alexander Kirkland Cairncross (1865&#150;1947), ironmonger, and his wife, Elizabeth Andrew Wishart (1875&#150;1958), schoolteacher. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71047/', "Sir Alexander Kirkland Cairncross (1911&#150;1998)")</script>, economist, was his elder brother. John Cairncross attended Lesmahagow village school before Hamilton Academy; at seventeen he won an open scholarship at Glasgow University, where his subjects were French and German; next he studied at the University of Paris, at the Sorbonne. In 1934 he succeeded George Painter as Bell exhibitioner at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained his BA degree in two years. During 1935&#150;6 he participated in communist meetings held at Cambridge, but later he insisted that he had been a fellow traveller rather than a party member; this is not universally accepted. Stuart Hampshire remembered him at this time: &#145;an absurd and rather untidy scholar, very bright and academic. He was socially from the lower rather than the higher, very talkative, sort of chaotic&#146;  (Carter, 189).<br>
<br>Cairncross passed top of his year in the civil service examinations of 1936 and was appointed to the Foreign Office on 14 October 1936. As his touchy and graceless manners made him unsuitable for a foreign posting he was transferred to the Treasury as an assistant principal on 1 October 1938. He suggested that his frank dislike of appeasement contributed to this move. In 1937, shortly after entering the Foreign Office, he was recruited to work for Soviet espionage in manoeuvres involving the Cambridge Marxist James Klugmann, Anthony Blunt, and Guy Burgess. Cairncross was largely inactive as an agent until after the Nazi attack on Russia in 1941.<br>
<br>In 1940 Cairncross was appointed private secretary to the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, Lord Hankey. Despite developing an affectionate admiration for Hankey, from June 1941 he transmitted cabinet papers and Foreign Office telegrams to his Soviet controller. Jack Hewit, the working-class lover of Blunt and Burgess, who knew Cairncross at this time, was unimpressed by him. &#145;He was a nobody; he was dull&#146;  (Carter, 265). Similarly Sir John Colville considered Cairncross &#145;very brilliant but very boring&#146;  (Penrose and Freeman, 370). During 1942 Cairncross was called up to the Royal Armoured Corps, but then, as a fluent German speaker, he was posted to the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley, and assigned to work on the Enigma decrypts. He was shocked to find that the Soviets were not trusted with Ultra intelligence obtained at Bletchley, and sought to remedy the situation. According to Russian intelligence archives Cairncross supplied 5832 documents between 1941 and 1945. The Soviets mistrusted his information until in February 1943 he supplied the original flimsy papers containing full intercepted details of the Germans' forthcoming summer offensive. As a result he decisively influenced the outcome of the battle of Kursk, Germany's final major attack on the eastern front. However, working night shifts, together with the strains of his duplicity, weakened his health, and in 1943, after a year at Bletchley, he engineered a transfer to the Secret Intelligence Service, where he joined the section responsible for counter-espionage abroad.<br>
<br>In 1945 Cairncross returned to the Treasury; both there, and during a brief secondment to the Ministry of Supply, his prickliness remained an obstacle to promotion. Later he denied that in this period he continued to supply the Soviets with information on NATO and other crucial matters, though his Soviet controller Yuri Modin has given a detailed contrary account. &#145;Cairncross was anti-social and a wretched hand at making friends&#146;, with &#145;a sizeable chip on his shoulder&#146;, according to Modin. &#145;I liked Cairncross best of all our London agents. He wasn't an easy man to deal with, but he was a profoundly decent one&#146;  (Modin, 107, 168). An unsigned but compromising memorandum was found in Burgess's flat, after his disappearance with Donald Maclean in 1951, written on the day that the Nazis marched into Prague (15 March 1939). Cairncross was identified as the memorandum's author, but when confronted by the British authorities he outsmarted his interrogators; after admitting to carelessness with official papers he was required to resign from the civil service in 1952. On 26 January 1951 Cairncross had married Gabriele Susanne (1914&#150;1995), daughter of Sebastian Oppenheim, a retired Bristol merchant, from a Frankfurt Jewish family, but they were to separate during the 1960s.<br>
<br>Cairncross became Rome correspondent of <span class="italic">The Economist</span>, <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Subsequently he was employed by the United Nations at Geneva (1953&#150;6), as chief editor (based in Bangkok) for the Economic Council for Asia and the Far East (1957&#150;62), and he was among the Harvard group's advisers to Pakistan's Planning Commission (1962&#150;3). He wrote three books on Moli&egrave;re, and translated into English verse seven plays by Racine (published in 1963 and 1967) as well as <span class="italic">La Fontaine fables</span> (1982). He also wrote a history of Christian sexual morality, <span class="italic">After Polygamy was Made a Sin</span> (1974).<br>
<br>Following Philby's defection MI5 resumed its hunt for Soviet spies, and in 1964 Cairncross made an extended, though possibly incomplete, confession. In subsequent years he continued co-operation with the British authorities. &#145;He was a clever, rather frail-looking Scotsman with a shock of red hair and a broad accent&#146;, according to one of his interrogators, Peter Wright, who found him &#145;engaging&#146;  (Wright, 281&#150;2). Stella Rimington, who re-interrogated him during the 1970s, recalled &#145;a thin, grey, stooping figure &hellip; turning our conversations into intellectual sparring matches and &hellip; determined to &hellip; tell us no more than he had already admitted, which was nothing like the full story&#146;  (Rimington, 119&#150;20). Following Margaret Thatcher's denunciation of Blunt in 1979, journalists established Cairncross's identity, and he endured frantic publicity. In 1982 he was convicted of smuggling currency across the Italian/Swiss border. There were further journalistic storms around his name, notably in 1990 when he had just settled at St Antonin du Var, Provence.<br>
<br>Cairncross, who was deaf in one ear, could seem unprepossessing: conceited, unpunctual, clumsy, untidily dressed, and a laboriously slow trencherman. His courage and self-sufficiency won the admiration, though, of Graham Greene. Despite suffering a stroke in 1993 he continued writing his self-exculpatory memoirs, which were posthumously published and are not wholly convincing. He returned to England in 1995, settling in a cottage in the Welsh marches, and a week after his wife's death, married on 8 September 1995 his long-term companion, Gayle Anne (<i>b</i>. 1952/3), an American opera singer and daughter of John Richmond Brinkerhoff, army officer. Following another stroke, he died of heart failure on 8 October 1995, at Longhope, Weston, Pembridge, near Leominster.<br>
