<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ochterlony, Sir  David</span>, first baronet  (1758&#150;1825), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, was born on 12 February 1758 in Boston, Massachusetts. He was the eldest of three sons of David Ochterlony (<i>d</i>. 1765), a Scottish-born merchant sea captain, and his American-born wife, Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1783), daughter of Andrew Tyler and his wife, Miriam, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pepperell. His father's family were associated with Tillyfroskie, Aberdeenshire; David's paternal grandfather, Alexander Ochterlony (<i>b</i>. 1695), was laird of Pitforthy, Forfarshire. His father, having lived for a time in Montrose, is first recorded in Boston in 1751, where he married Katherina. Although his father died insolvent in St Vincent in August 1765, the young David continued to live in the family property in Salem Street, Boston, and attended the Boston public Latin school. In 1770 his mother brought her three sons to England, where, on 7 March 1770, she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12822/', "Isaac Heard")</script>, whom she may have met during his voyages to America in the 1750s. Heard arranged the settlement of the late David Ochterlony's debts and used his influence as Lancaster herald to send his stepson David to India in 1777 as a cadet.<h2>
<a name="Earlymilitarycareer17781808"></a>Early military career, 1778&#150;1808</h2>Ochterlony was commissioned on 7 February 1778 as ensign in the 31st Bengal native infantry, and was promoted to lieutenant later the same year. In 1781, while with the 24th native infantry, Ochterlony joined Colonel Thomas Deane Pearse's force, which marched 1100 miles from Bengal to Madras to reinforce Lieutenant-General Sir Eyre Coote's army engaged in war against the ruler of Mysore, Haidar Ali, and his French allies under Bussy. At Cuddalore on 25 June 1783 the 24th regiment, alone and in fierce hand-to-hand fighting, threw back a determined French attack. In the thick of the battle Ochterlony was wounded and taken prisoner. Following the death of Haidar Ali and the ratification of a treaty with his son Tipu Sultan (21 February 1784), the prisoners were released. Pearse and his troops marched back to Bengal, arriving in Calcutta on 15 January 1785. Ochterlony was appointed deputy judge-advocate-general with a Bengal army division in Dinapore. He served as a staff officer for the next eighteen years, being promoted captain on 7 January 1796 and major on 21 April 1800. Following the death of Ochterlony's mother on 30 August 1783, Isaac Heard remarried. In 1784 he became Garter principal king of arms, an influential appointment which he was to hold for thirty-eight years. Having no children of his own from either marriage, Heard derived from David Ochterlony &#145;all the satisfaction of a father, and experienced the warm attachment of a son&#146;  (Heard's obituary). They exchanged frequent correspondence and David Ochterlony wrote openly to Heard as his &#145;dear and most honoured friend and father&#146;, frankly disclosing his &#145;anti-matrimonial habits&#146;  (19 Jan 1817, Ochterlony MSS, priv. coll.).<br>
<br>In 1803, on the outbreak of war with the Marathas, the commander-in-chief, Lord Lake, brought Ochterlony back on active service. As a lieutenant-colonel (18 March 1803) in command of the 2nd battalion 12th Bengal native infantry, Ochterlony showed such skilful leadership at the capture of the forts of Sasni, Bijaigarh, and Kachawa in the doab that Lake appointed him deputy adjutant-general of his forces. He was with Lake at the battles of Koil (19 August 1803) and Aligarh (4 September 1803), and the capture of Delhi (11 September 1803), which wrested the Mughal emperor, Shah Alam, and his court from Maratha influence. While Lake and his army moved on, Ochterlony was left at Delhi as provisional resident with responsibility for the protection of the city and fortress of Delhi and its environs, and for ensuring the safety of Shah Alam. He organized the repair of 7 miles of crumbling city walls and the fortification of strong defensive parapets, calling in Lieutenant-Colonel Burn from Saharanpur to take command of all the troops available, about 2500 men with eleven guns. Together they held off Holkar, a Maratha chief, and his army of 18,000 men and 160 guns for nine days until relieved. A general order of the commander-in-chief dated 24 October 1804 commended Burn and expressed the highest approbation of Ochterlony's wise and timely precautions, energy, and decision.<br>
<br>The value of Ochterlony's service was recognized by his permanent appointment as resident at Delhi. His gallantry and courtly manners so earned Shah Alam's admiration that he was given the Mughal title of Nasir ud-Daula (defender of the state), and the town of Nasirabad was named after him. Like many of his British contemporaries in India, Ochterlony was very comfortable in Mughal&#150;Hindustani culture but, contrary to legend, probably no more so than was customary for British officers who served for long periods at Indian courts. In what was to become the pattern of Ochterlony's career this period of success and recognition was followed by unwelcome news. In April 1806 a peremptory letter conveyed the governor-general's instruction to hand over the residency to a civil servant successor, Archibald Seton. Despite the protests of Lord Lake and Shah Alam, Ochterlony was assigned the command of the fortress and station of Allahabad, half-way between Calcutta and Delhi. As some compensation, no reduction was made in his emoluments as resident.<h2>
<a name="Middleyears18081814"></a>Middle years, 1808&#150;1814</h2>Growing anxiety in London about possible French invasion of India via the north-west frontier revived Ochterlony's career on active service. On the instruction of the governor-general, Lord Minto, Charles Theophilus Metcalfe left Delhi on 28 July 1808 to seek the collaboration of the raja of Lahore, in a defensive pact. Ranjit Singh, a rising power in the Punjab, saw the British as an obstacle to the further spread of his influence in the Jumna&#150;Sutlej Doab. The governor-general in council decided that Ranjit Singh's action in launching a third trans-Sutlej expedition on 25 September 1808 was a threat to the security of British possessions south of the Sutlej. Metcalfe was therefore instructed on 31 October 1808 to extend British protection to the Sikh chiefs south of the Sutlej; to require the raja of Lahore to withdraw his army across the river; and to establish a military post near the Punjab frontier. Ochterlony, who had met and befriended Metcalfe during Lake's campaign in 1803, was summoned from Allahabad to lead a military detachment to the Sutlej in support of Metcalfe. Ochterlony set out from Delhi on 27 January 1809, followed by a strong force under Major-General St Leger. <i>En route</i> for Ludhiana he halted his detachment for five days, at the request of Ranjit Singh, while a headstrong Sikh commander was persuaded to cross the Sutlej. Unfortunately this brought a charge of insubordination from the commander-in-chief. Neil Benjamin Edmonstone, the governor-general's secretary, used his persuasive skills to defuse the incident, and with Metcalfe's strong support Ochterlony retained his command at Ludhiana. A treaty of perpetual friendship between the British and the raja of Lahore, concluded on 25 October 1809, put an end to Ranjit Singh's trans-Sutlej incursions. The importance of Ludhiana as a listening post was marked in 1810 by its upgrading to a political agency. At the same time Ochterlony was appointed agent to the governor-general and military commander there. He was promoted colonel on 1 January 1812. His immediate concern was the presence of Kaji Amar Singh Thapa's Nepalese army close to the northern borders of the lowland states protected by the British. Having been defeated by Ranjit Singh at Kangra in 1809 and forced to recross the Sutlej, the kaji had decided to secure the Nepalese hold on the thirty Cis-Sutlej Hill states with a network of defensive fortifications. Incidents which had occurred sporadically since 1806 along the imprecisely defined southern border of Nepalese territory brought a general state of tension. By 1813, when Lord Moira (later marquess of Hastings) became governor-general and commander-in-chief, there was already a prospect of war between Britain and Nepal. An incident at Butwal on 29 May 1814, in which a chief police officer and eighteen policemen were killed by the Nepalese, provided the provocation.<h2>
<a name="WarwithNepalandafter18141822"></a>War with Nepal and after, 1814&#150;1822</h2>Hastings, a general in his own right, planned for four divisions to invade Nepalese territory simultaneously. He appointed Ochterlony to command the third field division at Ludhiana with the rank of major-general. Ochterlony's orders were to destroy Kaji Amar Singh Thapa's army and to annihilate Gurkha influence and authority between the Jumna and the Sutlej. Hastings regarded these as &#145;objects of primary interest&#146;  (<span class="italic">Papers Respecting the Nepaul War</span>, 702). Having toured the border territory in 1813 and gathered intelligence about Nepalese forces and their tactical skills and stockaded defences, Ochterlony was aware that he was faced with an entirely different species of warfare in steep and difficult mountainous country. He was also aware that to fulfil his orders he needed troops highly trained and experienced in mountain warfare, and that no such soldiers existed in the Bengal army. Ochterlony set out from Rupar, moving via Palasi (the capital of Hindur) towards Nalagarh. He took with him a formidable array of artillery, and resolved to spend whatever time was necessary surveying the terrain and, helped by the raja of Hindur's labour force, constructing roads for his guns. Breaches made by 6 pounder guns and the threat of heavier battering guns caused the garrison of Nalagarh Fort and of nearby Taragarh to surrender. Ochterlony took care to reassure the ninety-five prisoners of their personal safety and of &#145;everything which would reconcile them to their captors&#146;  (ibid., 453). Hastings left it to Ochterlony's discretion to offer service to enemy troops, subject to his ratification. On 24 January 1815 Ochterlony signed and sealed a memorandum of four propositions offered by Jeykishen, a Brahman provincial governor of Kumaon, to the effect that every man who joined the British from the Nepalese army with his musket would receive Rs 10 and be retained in the British service on the Nepalese rates of pay. Larger monetary rewards would be paid to Nepalese officers. Ochterlony informed Hastings of these arrangements in early April 1815, by which time he had in his camp a body of 324 men &#145;in whose fidelity he felt the most perfect confidence&#146;  (BL OIOC, H/653, 136). Ochterlony's proposal to form them into a &#145;Nusseree Pulteen&#146; (Nasiri battalion, so named after his Mughal title) received Hastings's enthusiastic approval.<br>
<br>In the meantime, Ochterlony had made steady and methodical progress capturing, sometimes with great difficulty, the forts across the precipitous ranges of the Cis-Sutlej hills. He drove each garrison to Malaun Fort, where, from intercepted letters, he knew that Kaji Amar Singh Thapa had elected to make his principal stand. Encamped at the foot of the Malaun hills, Ochterlony sent his troops, including the Nasiris, by night to occupy two undefended hilltops. From there, with feint attacks to mislead the kaji, he closed on a prominence overlooking Malaun Fort, beating off sustained and heroic counter-attacks with his field artillery. Under threat of Ochterlony's battering guns the kaji was forced to honourable surrender. Hostilities were brought to an end by a convention between Kaji Amar Singh Thapa and Ochterlony dated 15 May 1815. Clause 5 of this convention stated that Nepalese troops were at liberty to enter service with the British if they so wished and provided that the British chose to accept them. With the surrender of Malaun, Jaithak, and all other forts in the Jumna&#150;Sutlej Doab, 4700 Nepalese soldiers joined the British. Of these perhaps 1500 were Gurkhas, the remainder being almost all Kumaonis and Garhwalis. Kaji Amar Singh Thapa and his son Ranjor Singh Thapa were given full military honours and were allowed to return to Nepal with their families and belongings. Ochterlony was appointed KCB and created a baronet. A grateful court of directors of the East India Company granted him an annual pension of &pound;1000.<br>
<br>When the Nepalese government refused to ratify a treaty signed at Sagauli on 2 December 1815, a second campaign became necessary and Ochterlony was given overall command of an army of 33,000 men and 100 guns. With little more than two months of the campaigning season in which to fulfil Hastings's objectives in the east, Ochterlony lost no time. Having quickly gathered his ordnance and pioneer companies, he deployed two brigades to left and right, and led the other two through dense forests of sal trees to the precipitous and heavily fortified hills of the Churia Ghati range. Finding his way blocked at the Bichraltar Pass, Ochterlony led a brigade up a very steep and narrow ravine, leaving his pioneers to construct a passage for unladen elephants and for manhandling guns. The sudden appearance of the British beyond the Bichraltar defences caused the Nepalese defenders to fall back on the main Nepalese position at Makwanpur. Having assembled two brigades and his heavy ordnance near Makwanpur, Ochterlony sent a strong force to occupy an abandoned hill position on the Makwanpur range. This he defended successfully with reinforcements and artillery against waves of Nepalese counter-attacks. The arrival of the other two brigades, the capture of Makwanpur Fort, and the consequent threat to the Katmandu valley persuaded the Nepalese government to ratify the treaty of Sagauli without further delay, thereby bringing the war to an end on 5 March 1816. Ochterlony's triumph was recognized by his promotion to GCB, by addresses in both houses of parliament, and by the augmentation of his coat of arms with the word Nipal. Hastings gave Ochterlony the privilege of forming the recruits from the Nepalese army into four battalions. The 1st and 2nd Nasiri and the Sirmur battalions were stationed in key forts in the Cis-Sutlej hills. The Kumaon battalion was based at Almora, near the Kumaon border with Nepal.<br>
<br>Hastings now led an army of 120,000 with 300 guns to subdue the Maratha chiefs and associated roving Pindari hordes which had been laying waste British territory in central India. Ochterlony was given the important task of commanding a division protecting Delhi and supporting operations in Rajputana. His reputation and tactical skills persuaded Amir Khan, a Maratha chief who had ravaged Jaipur and neighbouring territory, to ratify a treaty. With his army disarmed and disbanded, Amir Khan became a peaceful ally of the British. In March 1818 Hastings appointed Ochterlony resident in Rajputana and commissioner-general to the Rajput states, with command of British troops. In December 1818 he was appointed resident at Delhi, and in 1822 he became resident of Malwa and Rajputana, basing his headquarters at Neemuch.<h2>
<a name="Latercareerandreputation18221825"></a>Later career and reputation, 1822&#150;1825</h2>Despite this recognition, Ochterlony's life from 1822 was full of sadness. With his health deteriorating he bade farewell to his grandson, Charles Metcalfe Ochterlony, aged four, who sailed for Scotland on 16 January 1822. On 11 August 1822 Ochterlony's only son, Roderick Peregrine Ochterlony, who had been his Persian interpreter from 1809 to 1815, died. In the same year Ochterlony received news of the death on 29 April 1822 of his beloved stepfather and confidant, Sir Isaac Heard. In 1823 Lord Hastings, with whom Ochterlony had the greatest rapport, was succeeded as governor-general, after a brief interim period, by Lord Amherst. With neither political nor military standing, Amherst had doubts about his own competence. By December 1823 Ochterlony's health had so seriously declined that he sought a less demanding post. The government in Calcutta, determined that he should retire completely, soon seized an opportunity. Early in 1824 Ochterlony complied with an earnest request by Baldeo Singh, raja of Bharatpur, to invest his infant son as his heir apparent. A year later, when Baldeo Singh died, his nephew Durjan Singh seized power. Ochterlony, long convinced of the need for swift and decisive action at times of unrest in India, issued a proclamation calling on the people to support their rightful ruler, and prepared to march on Bharatpur. Amherst, fearful of repeating Lake's disastrous failure to take Bharatpur in 1805, ordered Ochterlony to cancel his proclamation and to halt his troops. Deeply hurt by this treatment, Ochterlony felt himself &#145;abandoned and dishonoured&#146;  (Kaye, 2.137). He resigned his appointment and, having moved to Meerut for a change of air, died late on 14 July 1825. He was buried at St John's Church there on the next day. With Metcalfe's persuasion, the governor-general in council passed a resolution on 16 September 1825 which vindicated Ochterlony's action at Bharatpur. Metcalfe was present when a large army under Lord Combermere stormed and took Bharatpur fortress on 3 January 1826. Ochterlony's Nasiris and the Sirmur battalion were in the forefront of the assault. At a public meeting on 26 September 1825 Metcalfe had paid tribute to his great friend Ochterlony: &#145;Never, perhaps, was there another so universally admired as a public man, at the same time so generally and fervently beloved&#146;  (ibid., 132).<br>
<br>Ochterlony never married, but is known to have had at least six children, a son and five daughters, with two or more Indian women. The tradition that Ochterlony took the evening air in Delhi with thirteen wives on thirteen elephants probably owes much to folklore. His two youngest daughters were born of Mahruttun, entitled Mubarak al-Nisa (&#145;Blessed among women&#146;) and often called Begum Ochterlony. Ochterlony, &#145;who was uniformly spoken of as a kind, honourable and worthy man&#146;  (Heber, 2.19), showed care and affection for his family. His three elder daughters having married comfortably to East India Company officials, he provided funds in trust for his two youngest daughters. For his grandson, Charles Metcalfe Ochterlony, to whom the remainder of Ochterlony's baronetcy passed by second patent in 1823, he arranged guardians and the purchase of land and heritable estates in Scotland. In his will he left his estate and effects in India to Begum Ochterlony and thence to his two youngest daughters. Ochterlony paid no heed to acquiring a great fortune, but lived on his army and diplomatic emoluments.<br>
