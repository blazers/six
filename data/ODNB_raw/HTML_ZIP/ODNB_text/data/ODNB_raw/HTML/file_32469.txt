</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cobbe,  Frances Power</span>  (1822&#150;1904), <span class="occ">writer and campaigner for women's rights</span>, was born in Dublin on 4 December 1822. She was the fifth child and only daughter of Charles Cobbe (1781&#150;1857), a landowner, of Newbridge House, co. Dublin, and his wife, Frances Conway (1777&#150;1847). Cobbe was educated at home, except for two years (1836&#150;8) at an expensive school in Brighton. Cobbe regarded her schooling, which cost &pound;1000, as an interruption to her education and a complete waste of time. The noise, frivolity, pointless routine, and complete lack of intellectual stimulation contrasted strongly with her pleasurable life at home, spent in close contact with her accomplished and beloved mother. Cobbe was recalled from school when her mother's ill health made it necessary for her to take over the housekeeping.<br>
<br>Her mother's death in 1847 was a terrible loss to Cobbe and almost immediately brought her into conflict with her stern and forbidding father, whose housekeeper and domestic companion she now became. Their conflict centred on religion. The family was devoutly evangelical and engaged in regular prayers and <span class="roman">Bible</span> reading. Although subject to religious doubt before this, Cobbe had continued to participate in the family's religious observance. After her mother's death, however, she refused to do so, taking a certain pride in being the first heretic in a family which numbered five archbishops and a bishop among its members. As a result of this apostasy she was exiled to the home of a brother for ten months. She was recalled when her domestic services were again required, but remained always in a kind of moral quarantine. She accepted that it was her duty to care for her father, but refused ever to submit to his religious or moral views.<br>
<br>Although she was an agnostic for a short time in adolescence, Cobbe replaced the family religion with a form of deism heavily influenced by that of Theodore Parker, whose writings she subsequently edited in fourteen volumes (1863&#150;71). Her religious beliefs were closely integrated with her feminism, as she replaced the heavily patriarchal Christianity of her father with Parker's idea of a God who was, &#145;not a king but a Father and Mother, infinite in power, wisdom and love&#146;  (T. Parker, &#145;Discourse on religion&#146;, <span class="italic">The Collected Works of Theodore Parker</span>, ed. F. P. Cobbe, 1863, 1.306). Cobbe later attended the ministry of James Martineau and occasionally conducted services in Unitarian chapels. She combined her domestic duties with private study and literary pursuits. Her reading of Kant's <span class="italic">Metaphysics of Ethics</span> suggested the theme for her first book, <span class="italic">The Theory of Intuitive Morals</span> (published in two parts, 1855 and 1857), which she wrote late at night and published anonymously to protect her father from annoyance. Throughout her life, Cobbe wrote extensively on religious and ethical subjects, fearing the spread of atheism and the impact of Darwinism on morality.<br>
<br>The death of her father in 1857 left Frances Cobbe free of familial duties but in drastically reduced financial circumstances. The &pound;200 annuity with which she was left could not sustain the lifestyle to which she was accustomed. Moreover, the house which she had overseen for so many years now passed to her older brother, making it necessary for her to find a new home. Before doing so, she set out on an extended trip to Europe and the East, visiting Egypt, Lebanon, Palestine, and Syria, as well as France, Italy, and Greece. She was delighted to have visited the pyramids before the advent of Cook's tours, but found her greatest pleasure in Rome, where she got to know the large group of expatriate American and English women resident there, including Mary Somerville, Harriet Hosmer, and her subsequent life companion, Mary Lloyd. Cobbe discovered a great love of travel, returning to Italy six times in the next two decades.<br>
<br>On her return to England in 1858 Cobbe moved to Bristol, where for a short time she lived with Mary Carpenter, the Unitarian social reformer and philanthropist, assisting her with her ragged schools and reformatory work. This arrangement lasted only a few months. Cobbe desired a more intimate form of friendship than Carpenter was able to offer&#151;and Carpenter's complete lack of interest in creature comforts was intolerable to Cobbe. Within a year, she had moved to Durdham Down, where she engaged in workhouse visiting and in societies devoted to the care and supervision of &#145;friendless&#146; workhouse girls.<br>
<br>Shortly after this Cobbe moved to London, where she set up house with Mary Lloyd, a Welsh woman who had been studying sculpture with John Gibson in Italy. Lloyd apparently gave up sculpture, and became involved in a close domestic relationship with Cobbe. In London Cobbe expanded her range of journalism and became a feminist activist and the leading figure in the battle to outlaw vivisection. She contributed articles to most of the major periodicals. In 1867 she became a regular leader writer for <span class="italic">The Echo</span>, which earned her &pound;300 per annum until she relinquished the position in 1875. She also wrote for <span class="italic">The Standard</span> and was for a time the Italian correspondent for the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>. In 1862 Cobbe published her articles &#145;Celibacy vs marriage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>, vol. 65) and &#145;What shall we do with our old maids?&#146;  (ibid., vol. 66) and delivered a paper to the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science advocating the admission of women to university degrees (later published in her <span class="italic">Essays on the Pursuits of Women</span>, 1863). Through these activities she became known to the active feminist circle which had set up headquarters at Langham Place in London. She established a wide network of feminist friends, including Emily Davies, the founder of Girton College, John Stuart Mill and his stepdaughter, Helen Taylor, and the suffrage leaders Lydia Becker and Millicent Garrett Fawcett.<br>
<br>Cobbe was a member of the Married Women's Property Committee and, for a short time in 1867, of the London National Society for Woman's Suffrage. But the campaign to which she was most strongly committed was that for reform of the <span class="roman">Matrimonial Causes Act</span> of 1878. Cobbe was a somewhat difficult colleague. One of the few mid-Victorian feminists who came from the Anglo-Irish landed gentry, she carried from childhood a commitment to the Conservative Party, a belief that it was better to work through influential individuals rather than with popular support, and a particular sense of decorum. She was unhappy with committees which did not entirely endorse her views, and ended her association with a number of feminist colleagues when they refused to give wholehearted support to her anti-vivisection campaign.<br>
<br>Cobbe's greatest contribution to the women's movement came from her writing. She published in almost every major periodical, writing on the problems of marriage and the virtues of celibacy; the need for women to have independent activities; and on the persistent ill health of women, which resulted from fashions which constricted their bodies, from a medical profession which defined women as invalids, and from the fact that, unlike men, women lacked the services of a wife. Her powerful article &#145;Wife torture in England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>, 32, 1878), which illustrated the extent of domestic violence and sought to make &#145;aggravated assaults&#146; grounds for judicial separation, played a significant part in the passing of the <span class="roman">Matrimonial Causes Act</span> of that year.<br>
<br>The core of Cobbe's feminism lay in her belief in the moral autonomy of women on the one hand, and in her strong sense of sexual difference on the other. Women were rational beings with a primary duty to themselves and to their God, she argued, hence they could not submit themselves absolutely to the demands of either husband or parents. But Cobbe believed emphatically in the importance of sexual difference. She defined women as &#145;human beings of the mother sex&#146;  (F. P. Cobbe, <span class="italic">The Duties of Women</span>, 1881, 28) and insisted that innate maternal qualities would always determine what women did. Celibacy seemed preferable to marriage, in her view, but she assumed all celibate women would generally exercise their maternal qualities through some form of philanthropy.<br>
<br>For Cobbe, as for a number of other Victorian feminists, there was a close connection between feminism and the anti-vivisection campaign, in that both were fighting to protect defenceless creatures from the limitless powers of men. Her crusade against vivisection began in 1863. In 1875 she established the Victoria Street Society, and ran it alongside the National Anti-Vivisection Society as well as editing <span class="italic">The Zoopholist</span>. Cobbe's battles against vivisection soon encompassed a broader attack on the arrogance, brutality, and atheism of science and of the medical profession. For many, Cobbe personified the anti-vivisection movement, imbuing it with great energy but also with an intransigence that some saw as ultimately harmful to the cause.<br>
<br>In 1884, exhausted by the anti-vivisection campaign, Cobbe acceded to Lloyd's desire to return to her home, and they moved to Hengwrt, near Dolgellau. This did not mark the end of her interest in the anti-vivisection movement. Feeling that it had lost its force, she left the National Anti-Vivisection Society in 1898 to form a more thoroughgoing body, the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection which, to her great regret, did not succeed in outlawing the practice completely. Nor did she end her active support of the women's movement, and she continued writing pamphlets and essays, and attending and addressing suffrage meetings. It was while she was in retirement that she wrote her autobiography, a work which celebrates the full and active life available to single women, and served as another vehicle for her to expound her feminist beliefs. It also highlighted her wide acquaintance among English literary and intellectual circles: there was, she insisted, scarcely a single notable woman whom she had not met, and only a few men.<br>
<br>Cobbe's final years were ones of material comfort. She had given up her most lucrative journalism in order to devote herself to the anti-vivisection movement in the 1870s and had consequently been forced to rely on her very small paternal legacy. Immediately after her retirement, however, her colleagues in the Victoria Street Society collected &pound;1000 with which they purchased an annuity of &pound;100 for her. In 1891 she inherited a quite considerable sum as the residuary legatee of the widow of Richard Vaughan Yates, a devoted anti-vivisectionist. Her greatest grief was to have outlived Mary Lloyd, who died in 1896. Cobbe survived her by eight years and died at Hengwrt on 5 April 1904. She was buried in Llanelltyd churchyard, alongside her beloved Mary Lloyd. Fearing premature burial, she left instructions that the arteries of the neck and windpipe be completely severed after her death.<br>
<br>Cobbe was a person of considerable energy and enthusiasm with a great enjoyment of life. Her concern for animals caused her to refuse to decorate her hats with feathers, but she had no sympathy for vegetarianism or teetotalism, seeing them as an indication of the diminution of the vitality and animal spirits which had characterized the world of her youth. She always relished social occasions, especially dinner parties, she insisted, because even if the company was lacklustre she could entertain herself with her knife and fork. She was a person of considerable charm, but one with a very forceful personality. Convinced of the rightness of all her own causes and beliefs, however, she often pursued her chosen path regardless of the beliefs or feelings of others. Thus, while her participation was welcome to the women's movement, her attempts to harness the suffrage movement to the Primrose League was a source of some embarrassment and difficulty to her colleagues. Ultimately Cobbe's most important contribution to nineteenth-century feminism lay in her attempts to set out a feminist ethic, developed most extensively in <span class="italic">The Duties of Women</span> (1881). One reviewer described her as the person who &#145;excepting John Stuart Mill, &hellip; has done more than anyone else to give the dignity of principle to the women's movement&#146;  (&#145;Life of Frances Power Cobbe&#146;, <span class="italic">Academy</span>, 46, 1894).<br>
