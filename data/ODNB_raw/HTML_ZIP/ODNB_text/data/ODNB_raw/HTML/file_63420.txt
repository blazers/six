<span class="headword">Dunbar,  Patrick</span>  (1598&#150;1646), <span class="occ">army officer in the Danish service</span>, was born at Cumnoch, Moray, the son of Patrick Dunbar of Cumnoch, justice of Moray, and his wife, Maria Weyer. Such was the parentage ascribed to him in his funeral sermon, though it has not been possible to confirm these claims from Scottish sources. In all essentials his coat of arms is the same as that belonging to the Dunbars of Mochrum. Dunbar attended Marischal College, Aberdeen, and King's College, Aberdeen, and later stayed with his kinsman Thomas Hamilton, earl of Melrose (later of Haddington), secretary of state in Scotland and president and later lord privy seal in Scotland for Charles I.<br>
<br>Dunbar entered Danish service in 1625 as an ensign in the company under Sir Patrick Mackay of Lairg, in the regiment levied by Sir Donald Mackay. With four companies of 800 men Dunbar defended successfully Boizenburg on the Elbe against Tilly's army of 10,000 men, at the end of July 1627, and in 1628 was sent to Stralsund to relieve the besieged city. Here he was wounded in action, and when the regiment was reformed in the same year his company was disbanded. He must have chosen to remain in Denmark, as he did not transfer with the regiment to Swedish service in the summer of 1629. Dunbar had taken over a company in Scania as a captain in 1628 and on 2 April 1631 he was appointed a major of Scanian conscript peasants, giving him a part in creating a national Danish army (conscription had been introduced only in 1614). By the time he asked for leave to go to Scotland two years later, he held the rank of <i>overvagtmester</i> of a regiment of foot, which could indicate that he had been assigned to another unit. If he went to Scotland, Dunbar must have returned to Denmark in the following year, as on 24 September 1634 he was reappointed major with effect from the previous 1 May.<br>
<br>Dunbar married on 3 September 1637 at S&oslash;nderskov, Jutland, Maren Munk (<i>d</i>. 1652), daughter of Frands Nielsen Munk of &Oslash;rs (<i>d</i>. by 1625) and his wife, Mette Thomesdatter Orning (who was still alive at the time of the marriage). Dunbar's marriage into a noble family made his naturalization on 4 May 1638 possible, and at the same time his noble birth was recognized, which enabled him to own land in Denmark. He acquired the manor of Spannarp in north-west Scania; no noble title was linked to the manor, despite the assertions of older literature. Dunbar's concern about the arrangement of his parish church of Aus&aring;s in May 1641 may indicate that he held the patronage of it as owner of Spannarp.<br>
<br>As major of a Scanian regiment from 1 May 1641, Dunbar was to have commanded a company of conscripts from Halland, but he exchanged the position for another&#151;with conscripts from the <i>len</i> (administrative district) of Helsingborg. His own manor, Spannarp, was situated there, which appears to have influenced this arrangement. He was appointed commander <i>ad interim</i> of Halmstad Castle on 20 August 1641 and of Christianopel Castle on 16 May 1642. Both castles were of strategic significance in the event of war with Sweden: Halmstad Castle commanded the end of one of the most important roads, which, following the River Nissan, led from the Kattegat coast to J&ouml;nk&ouml;ping on Lake V&auml;ttern. Christianopel had been built as a fortress town close to the Danish&#150;Swedish frontier and commanded the southern entrance to Kalmar Sound. As support for naval operations in this region, Christianopel was important. During Torstensson's War (named after the Swedish commander-in-chief) between Denmark and Sweden in 1643&#150;5, Dunbar was garrisoned with his company at Halmstad from new year 1644 until the following October. He was then to be found in the camp by Malm&ouml; and in Zealand, before he was again garrisoned with two companies at Halmstad until the end of the war. On 12 December 1644 he was appointed lieutenant-colonel of Falk Lykke's Scanian regiment, but he retired from service at the end of the war. Dunbar died on 7 February 1646 at Spannarp and was buried in the church of Aus&aring;s, South &Aring;sbo, Scania.<br>
<br>Dunbar has sometimes been confused with his namesake, Patrick Dunbar, who on 11 November 1657 married Elisabeth Grubbe at Elsinore (Elisabeth was buried at St Mary's, Elsinore, on 15 December 1658). Patrick Dunbar also appears to have fought in Torstensson's War, as his company was disbanded in 1645; from 1657 to 1661 he was a major in Nadelwitz's (later M&uuml;nchhausen's) infantry regiment of mercenaries in Danish service. Captured by the Swedes at Elsinore in 1658, Patrick Dunbar had to remain in captivity for eighteen months, and in 1661 he appears to have left Denmark, having asked for a passport and for settlement of his accounts.<br>
