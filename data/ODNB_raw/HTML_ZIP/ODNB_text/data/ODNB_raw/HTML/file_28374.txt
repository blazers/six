<span class="headword">Waddington,  John</span>  (1810&#150;1880), <span class="occ">Congregational minister and historian</span>, born at Leeds on 10 December 1810, was the son of George and Elizabeth Waddington. As a boy he was deeply religious and began to preach at the age of fifteen. He trained for the ministry at Airedale College under William Vint from 1830 to 1833 and was ordained and inducted as minister of the Congregational church in Orchard Street, Stockport, on 23 May 1833: here he pioneered the introduction of Sunday schools to his own and other Congregational churches. He also assisted in a government inquiry into distress in the town which had been hard hit in the &#145;hungry forties&#146;: a blue book followed. In 1846 Waddington moved to Union Street Chapel, Southwark, which was then in dire straits and faced with possible dissolution. The crisis was overcome, and in 1864 a new building was opened as a memorial to the Pilgrim Fathers, some of whom had come from this historic church. These associations stimulated Waddington's interest in church history, especially that of his own denomination, to which he now gave thirty years' intensive study. In 1854 he published <span class="italic">John Penry, the Pilgrim Martyr</span>, and in 1861 a larger work on Congregational martyrs. In 1862 an essay on Congregational church history from the Reformation to 1662 won him a special prize from the Congregational Union. In 1866 he wrote the history of his own church, and in 1869 he began his great five-volume <span class="italic">Congregational History</span> which was completed in 1880. For this he received an honorary DD from the University of Williamstown, USA. The <span class="italic">History</span> relates chronologically the story of English Congregationalism from 1200 to the author's own day, the last volume dealing with the 1850&#150;80 period. Though now largely redundant it was a pioneering venture and served as a source book for a generation or more of Congregational historians.<br>
<br>Apart from his historical works Waddington wrote <span class="italic">Emmaus, or, Communion with the Saviour at Eventide</span> (1846), <span class="italic">The American Crisis in Relation to Slavery</span> (1862), <span class="italic">The Track of the Hidden Church</span> (1863), and a number of smaller works. He also edited Josiah Basset's autobiography, <span class="italic">The Life of a Vagrant</span> (1850). Waddington was a rather shy and self-effacing man, nervous and intense in speech. Apart from his work as a historian he was not prominent within his denomination. He died at his house in Surrey Square, Old Kent Road, London, on 24 September 1880. He was apparently unmarried.<br>
