<span class="headword">Ferdinand,  Philip</span>  (1556&#150;1599), <span class="occ">Hebrew and Arabic scholar</span>, was born of Jewish parentage in Poland in 1556. In his youth he studied the <span class="roman">Talmud</span> in the traditional Jewish manner and, judging from his elegant Latin, his command of Greek, and his fine handwriting, also received a humanist education. After about 1580 he was in Constantinople where he consorted with the Karaites, the Jewish sectarians who rejected the <span class="roman">Talmud</span> and the rabbinic tradition. He probably also travelled further afield in the Levant and there acquired his knowledge of Arabic and Syriac. About 1585 he converted to Roman Catholicism. Some ten years later he came to England, converted to protestantism, and made for Oxford, where he arrived in a state of penury. With the backing of the theologians Henry Airay of Queen's College and John Rainolds of Corpus Christi he gave tuition in Hebrew at various colleges, taking the oath of loyalty to the queen and university on 21 June 1596.<br>
<br>On 16 December 1596 Ferdinand matriculated at Cambridge. Attached to Peterhouse, he received 40<i>s</i>. from the Perne foundation to give Hebrew lessons at individual colleges and, according to a letter by William Eyre of Emmanuel College, also taught Arabic. William Gouge and Richard Montagu, both of King's College, were among his other students. Although his lessons were found tedious by most of his pupils, who &#145;grew soon weary and left him&#146;  (Clarke, 236), Eyre and Gouge, who stuck to him, remembered him with the utmost gratitude.<br>
<br>In Cambridge in 1597 Ferdinand published his only book, <span class="italic">Haec sunt verba Dei</span>, an anthology of post-biblical Jewish writings which included a commentary on the 613 commandments of the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span> as collected by Abraham ben Hasan, the hermeneutic rules of Rabbi Ishmael, and Maimonides's thirteen articles of faith. The book was a compilation in an established tradition of works by Jewish converts to Christianity, yet Ferdinand made contributions of his own. He contrasted Sadducean with Pharisaic interpretations of the law and thus brought out the variety of opinions within Judaism. He was also the first scholar to introduce the English Hebraists to certain extracts from rabbinic literature. His book was accordingly influential, referred to frequently by Samuel Purchas, treasured by John Selden, emulated by Hugh Broughton, and assimilated by numerous other students of Jewish tradition.<br>
<br>Despite his growing reputation, Ferdinand stayed little more than a year in Cambridge. By February 1598 he and his wife, Elizabeth, were put up and paid three halfpence a day by the Domus Conversorum in Chancery Lane in London, the hospital for converted Jews founded by Henry III. In February 1599, however, Ferdinand was invited to Leiden by the great French chronologist Joseph Justus Scaliger.<br>
<br>In Leiden, where he was also supported by Joannes Drusius, professor of Hebrew at the University of Franeker, Ferdinand started by giving private tuition in Hebrew (ancient and rabbinic) and Syriac. On 1 March the university had announced that he would be lecturing in Arabic grammar in the summer term, and, on 10 August 1599, he was appointed to the newly founded chair of Arabic for a trial period of six months, at a salary of 25 florins a month with the obligation to lecture every morning at 11 o'clock. On 11 August he matriculated officially at the university.<br>
<br>Ferdinand was more successful in Holland than he had been in England. He trained the Hebraist Guilielmus Coddaeus and, probably, the Arabist Adriaen Willemsz. Scaliger was heavily dependent on him in his study of Judaism. Besides drawing on Ferdinand's knowledge of the Karaites, he studied the <span class="roman">Talmud</span> under his supervision and remained impressed by his &#145;astonishing&#146; familiarity with it  (Scaliger, <span class="italic">Epistolae</span>, 594). For Ferdinand, one of the first central European Jews to settle in the northern Netherlands, had a knowledge of Jewish culture which was altogether new to the scholars in Leiden. On the subject of Arabic Ferdinand published nothing, but the high praise of Eyre and the support of Scaliger, a critical and perceptive judge who had remarkable insights into how Arabic should be studied, suggest that he taught it just as well as Hebrew.<br>
<br>On 6 November 1599 Ferdinand petitioned Leiden University to extend his appointment at least for a number of years, so that his students could have a greater sense of stability and he himself could bring over his family from the Domus Conversorum in London and have more money to purchase books. His petition was accepted; his professorship was extended for three years from 8 February 1600 (the end of his trial period); and he was granted 100 florins to meet his expenses and cover his very considerable debts in Leiden. Shortly after this, however, probably early in December, Ferdinand fell ill. By 21 December 1599, to Scaliger's intense distress, he was dead.<br>
