<span class="headword">Picts,  kings of the</span>  (<em>act. </em><em>c.</em>300&#150;<em>c.</em>900)<span class="occ"></span>, were the rulers of a now vanished people or peoples who bore a living name in what is now Scotland for some six hundred years.<h2>
<a name="ThePictsandtheirrulers"></a>The Picts and their rulers</h2>That name, from the Latin &#145;Picti&#146;, first recorded in 297, is commonly regarded as derived from the painting or tattooing of their skins practised by those who lived north of the Roman wall, but this derivation cannot be regarded as certain. Roman authors in the fourth century used it in a general way to denote un-Romanized and potentially hostile natives of north Britain. Evidence for later usage comes mainly from Irish sources. Irish invention is evident in <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1922/', "Bede's")</script> account (<i>c</i>.730) of Picts as a single ethnic group. Pseudo-historical texts that were probably extant in the ninth century say that the Pictish country comprised seven regions named after sons of an eponymous Cruithne. Some of the names are given in Irish form, and Cruithni, or related forms, was by that time the equivalent in Irish of the Latin Picti. The seven regions cover the eastern side of mainland Britain as far south as the Firth of Forth. (The western country north of the Firth of Clyde must have ceased to be &#145;Pictish&#146; by the fifth century, having passed into the orbit of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49278/', "D&#225;l Riata")</script>.) It has been argued that more than one native language left traces in the Pictish country. The one that Bede knew about was a Celtic language akin to southern British (Welsh), or perhaps more closely to Gaulish. To modern eyes the country seems best distinguished by its symbolic decorative art, especially stone carving.<br>
<br>It was said that each of the Pictish regions was, or had been, a kingdom. Kings of Fortriu, roughly equatable with the south of modern Perthshire, are so entitled in annals from the late seventh century onwards, and one king of Atholl is named in 739.<br>
<br>The names and reign lengths of sixty or seventy Pictish kings are given in regnal lists. The lists are the sole authority for the first thirty kings or so. Most of these must be treated as mythical rather than historical. In the late sixth century, however, the deaths of Pictish kings begin to appear in annal collections, especially the annals of Ulster, while between about 670 and 740 Pictish information may be ascribed to an Iona annal source, and may have more value than in the preceding period, in which annalists may have relied on lists for their chronology.<br>
<br>Neither lists nor annals show clearly the status of the kings they record. Late medieval copyists of the lists clearly believed that they were dealing with a single series of overkings. Some of the listed kings did undoubtedly have such a status, and the title king of Picts (<i>rex Pictorum</i> or <i>r&iacute; Cruithentuaithe</i>) may have been meant to indicate overkingship; but it is noteworthy that most instances of the title in the annals of Ulster occur before 670, and are perhaps not independent of lists.<br>
<br>A peculiarity of Pictish regnal succession, as reflected in the lists and annals, is well known. The kings are normally identified as &#145;son of&#146; (<i>mac</i>) a named parent. With a few possible exceptions the parent's name is certainly masculine. Yet, until late in the eighth century, no father appears also as king, and in most cases the king's identity in terms of kinship is unknown. This has been commonly regarded as consistent with a matrilineal system in which a king could be succeeded by a uterine brother (his mother's son) or by a nephew (his mother's daughter's son), but not by his own son, and so as according with Bede's belief that the Picts had a preference for matrilineal descent in the choice of their kings, and that the system was still being operated in his own day (<i>c</i>.730). Until late in the twentieth century scepticism on the subject could be dismissed as arising primarily from misconceptions, as that matriliny has been confined to very primitive peoples; that matriliny is the same thing as matriarchy (rule by females); and that in a matrilineal society fathers will be too insignificant to be remembered or named. But by the late 1990s more serious objections were coming to be advanced against Pictish matriliny, based upon both a comparative study of patrilinear succession among other early medieval peoples, and a closer examination of the nature and provenances of Bede's sources and the Pictish regnal list. As a result the notion of Pictish matriliny can no longer be taken for granted.<h2>
<a name="ThekingshipofBrudec560c585"></a>The kingship of Brude, c.560&#150;c.585</h2>The earliest Pictish king to be mentioned in the annals is <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39139/', "Brude (or Bridei) mac Maelchon")</script>. The monastery of Iona was founded in his reign, which may sufficiently explain why the annalists ignored his thirty or so listed predecessors. Also, he was perhaps believed to have been the first Christian Pictish king. One possible predecessor is in fact named in the annals. Four years before the death of Brude they enter the death of &#145;Cennalath rex Pictorum&#146;  (579 in the annals of Ulster). The original list probably gave him a reign of four years to which one version added &#145;with Brude one year&#146;. Nothing is known of him. It may be that he ought to have been inserted at the beginning, not the end, of Brude's reign.<br>
<br>Brude was credited with the round figure of a thirty-year reign. Twenty-six years before his death the annals of Ulster, under 557, note succinctly an event for which Brude was no doubt famous: &#145;Flight [Latin <i>fuga</i>] before Maelchon's son&#146;. A later annalist described it more explicitly in Irish: &#145;Flight of Scots [<i>do Albanchaib</i>] before Maelchon's son king of Picts&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 1.21). A second entry in the same source replaces <i>fuga</i> with Irish <i>immirge</i>, meaning &#145;migration, shift of ground&#146;, suggesting that Scots from Argyll had been frustrated in an attempted expansion eastwards.<br>
<br>An obvious route for Scottish expansion was by the Great Glen and down Loch Ness. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/110/', "Adomn&#225;n of Iona")</script>, writing <i>c</i>.700, associates Brude solely with the neighbourhood of the River Ness, but Brude was certainly king of more than a single region. A hundred years after his death the centre of Pictish monarchy seems to have been much further south.<h2>
<a name="PictsandNorthumbriansc586670"></a>Picts and Northumbrians, c.586&#150;670</h2>One group of Pictish lists (A, B, C) contains matter relating to the church of Abernethy, an undoubtedly ancient site on the south side of the Tay just west of the modern Perthshire&#150;Fife border. It attributes the foundation to a predecessor of Brude, <a name="cosubject_19838"></a><span class="headword">Nechtan Morbet</span> <span class="st"> [Nechtan Morbreac]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 481?)<span class="occ"></span>, Erip's son, who would have reigned about the middle of the fifth century, but associates it with the successor of St Brigit (<i>d</i>. 523) at Kildare&#151;an undoubted anachronism. Lists in another group attribute the building of Abernethy to one of Brude's immediate successors, Garnat, son of Domnach (or the like), or Nectan, son of Irb. It can only be supposed that, in the late Pictish period or later, Abernethy was believed to have been founded by a king called Nechtan.<br>
<br>In 616 &AElig;thelfrith, king of Northumbria, died in battle, and according to Bede his young sons sought refuge among the Scots and Picts. During most of the seventeen years that they spent in exile the Pictish king was Ciniod, son of Luchtren. The oldest of the exiled brothers, Eanfrith, became the father of a later Pictish king. For more than twenty years after Ciniod the kingship was held successively by three brothers whose father, Uid, could, chronologically, have been the warrior named Gwid in the Old Welsh poem <span class="italic">Gododdin</span>. The third son of Uid, named Talorg, was succeeded by <a name="cosubject_55352"></a><span class="headword">Talorgen</span>  (<em>d.</em> 657)<span class="occ"></span>, whose father, Enfret, was identified by W. F. Skene as Eanfrith, son of &AElig;thelfrith. It is a fair conjecture that Talorgen's mother was a sister of the sons of Uid.<br>
<br>Eanfrith was killed in 634 after a one-year reign in Northumbria. His brother Oswald, who succeeded him, during his eight-year reign received into subjection, Bede reports, all the peoples of Britain, including the Picts. Their submission, which may have been no more than a formal recognition of lordship, would have been made by Brude, the second of Uid's sons. This Brude's reign (635&#150;41) and Oswald's almost coincided. Oswald's brother Oswiu (<i>r</i>. 642&#150;70) required more than a formal submission. Bede says that he made the greater part of the Pictish people subject to the Angles, exacting tribute, at least for the last dozen years of his life, perhaps not during the reign of his nephew Talorgen, son of Eanfrith. After Talorgen two brothers, Gartnait and Drust, sons of Donuel, reigned in succession. Their father's name was perhaps British, or even Pictish, but could be a translation of Irish Domnall.<br>
<br>Oswiu died in February of (probably) 670, leaving his son Ecgfrith as heir to his dominions. Early in the new reign an uprising of Picts was countered with great slaughter by a Northumbrian army. Bede does not mention the affair, which is known from a highly coloured account in Stephen of Ripon's life of Bishop Wilfrid. In 671 or 672 Drust was driven from his kingship (<i>de regno</i>) and died six years later. It is unknown whether he was expelled by Ecgfrith on account of the revolt, or by his own people because the revolt had failed, or whether his successor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39138/', "Brude mac Bile (Bridei son of Beli)")</script>, whose reign was apparently counted from 672, had taken an active part in the expulsion.<h2>
<a name="ThedefeatoftheNorthumbriansc670c700"></a>The defeat of the Northumbrians, c.670&#150;c.700</h2>There are three scraps of evidence on the ancestry of Brude mac Bile. The first consists of verses quoted in an Irish life of Adomn&aacute;n referring to Brude as son of a king of Dumbarton (chief fortress of the British kingdom of Strathclyde). Two kings in the Strathclyde genealogy are called Bile, the one a great-grandson of the other. The elder Bile, son of Neithon, was the father of that Owen who, as king, defeated and killed Domnall Brecc <i>c</i>.642. A son of Owen died <i>c</i>.694, a year after Brude, Bile's son, who would have been his uncle and, presumably, an old man. The later Bile, son of Elfin, died in 722. If he was Brude's father, Brude must have been very young when he became king and not much over forty when he died.<br>
<br>The second piece of evidence is that a comment on the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span> notes that Ecgfrith was Brude's cousin (<i>fratruelis</i>). This has been variously explained. It may be seen as simply an assertion that Brude was descended, through his mother, from &AElig;thelfrith, Ecgfrith's grandfather. The implication is that she was either a sister, or a sister's daughter, of the Pictish Talorgen, son of Eanfrith. That she was Talorgen's sister seems to be ruled out by the third piece of information.<br>
<br>Verses quoted by the seventeenth-century Duald MacFirbis say that when Brude made his stand against Ecgfrith at Dunnichen (near Forfar) in 685, he was fighting for (<i>im[m]</i>, perhaps &#145;in, around&#146;) the heritage of his grandfather. If the heritage was the overkingship or the kingdom of Fortriu or the land of the Picts, the clause needs a good deal of explaining. But if it was the place where Brude's men stood and fought, in the province of C&iacute;rchenn, there is a simple explanation: that Brude's mother had been the wife of a king of C&iacute;rchenn, or a lord of Dunnichen. She was a daughter of Talorgen's sister; if she had been herself Talorgen's sister, Brude's maternal grandfather would have been Eanfrith, whose heritage no doubt lay in Northumbria. However, other models for understanding Brude's ancestry have also been posited.<br>
<br>In the first half of Brude's reign the annals name him only once, when he attacked Orkney in 682. Perhaps, as H. M. Chadwick suggested, he was responding to a siege of the coastal fortress of Dunnottar (near Stonehaven) the year before. A siege of Dunadd (in Scottish territory) and one of Dundurn (in Pictish) in 683 suggest a conflict with the D&aacute;l Riata, but Brude is not mentioned in connection with either. Ecgfrith's invasion of Pictland in May 685 is represented as unprovoked, but it cannot have been totally unforeseen. The Picts evidently did not try to pre-empt it, but when it came Brude was able to carry out the strategic withdrawal that ended in Ecgfrith's death and the total defeat of his army. Brude mac Bile was the first to be described by the annalists as &#145;king of Fortriu&#146;, at his death in 693, and probably in the original entry on the battle of Dunnichen.<br>
<br>Brude's successor, Tarain, son of Ainftech, was expelled <i>de regno</i> in 697, after which the kingship was held for nearly thirty years by two brothers, sons of Derile. In the same year as Tarain's expulsion the annals record the promulgation in Ireland of Adomn&aacute;n's law of the innocents. Last in a long list of lay guarantors of the law, in the work known as <span class="italic">C&aacute;in Adamn&aacute;in</span>, is Brude (or Bridei), Derile's son, king of the Cruithentuath (the Irish name of the Picts). In the following year (698) Picts and Northumbrians fought a battle which resulted in the death of the Northumbrian leader Berctred. This was their first recorded conflict since 685.<h2>
<a name="TheruleofNechtanc700732"></a>The rule of Nechtan, c.700&#150;732</h2>Brude, son of Derile, died in 706. The lists name his successor as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19837/', "Nechtan mac Derile")</script> with a reign of fifteen years, or Necton (Brude's brother) with eighteen (706&#150;24). The annals first mention Nechtan (without his parent's name) at 713. In that year &#145;Talorg, Drostan's son, was bound by his brother, king Nechtan&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 1.214). This has been taken to show that Nechtan's father was called Drostan. In that case, either Derile was Nechtan's mother (perhaps uniquely in the records of Pictish kings) or, as has been conjectured, the Nechtan of 713 was not the same person as the Nechtan, Derile's son, of the 720s. (The name Derile&#151;Derelei, Derilei, and so on&#151;a genitive, has not been explained, may be non-Celtic, and could be of either gender.) A simple alternative is that Nechtan's father was not Drostan, but that Nechtan and Talorg were half-brothers with the same mother and different fathers.<br>
<br>Nechtan's exceptional concern with ecclesiastical matters brought him within the range of interest of his contemporary, Bede. It was to Bede's own abbot of Wearmouth&#150;Jarrow that Nechtan applied for advice on converting his realm to Roman observances.<br>
<br>A struggle for the Pictish overkingship from 724 until 729 was recorded by annalists in unusual detail, though some explanatory clauses in the Tigernach version can be read as insertions made by a Clonmacnoise editor with the aid of a king-list. In 724 Nechtan is said to have adopted clerical or monastic garb. It appears that he was abdicating in favour of <a name="cosubject_55348"></a><span class="headword">Drust</span>  (<em>d.</em> 729)<span class="occ"></span>, who was possibly his nephew and natural heir; but his action was perhaps not voluntary, for two years later Drust imprisoned him. The notice of the imprisonment, written when Nechtan was no longer king, is the one place where the annals of Ulster identify him as Derile's son.<br>
<br>In this same year (726) Drust was driven from the kingship by Alpin (perhaps his brother). In 728 Alpin's forces were twice routed by a newcomer, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49279/', "Oengus mac Forgusso (Onuist son of Uurguist")</script>). On the second occasion, according to the late English annals of Clonmacnoise, &#145;Eolbeck the son of Moydan, and the rest of the nobles and people of the Picts, turned their backs to Alpin and did receive Nechtan, the son of Derile, as king into the kingdom again&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 1.224). It could be said that Oengus had come to the aid of a pro-Nechtan faction. Yet, in the next year (729, recorded in the annals of Ulster only) Oengus's people clashed with Nechtan's people and beat them. Nechtan himself is mentioned no more until his death in 732, and there is no evidence of his having taken any personal part in these events.<br>
<br>The last battle of the series was fought in July or August 729, between Oengus and Drust who, it is to be supposed, had never relinquished his claim to the kingship, and Drust was killed. There is some reason to think that Alpin later became a king of the D&aacute;l Riata. Annalists referred to Drust, Alpin (in his Pictish context), and, in Nechtan's lifetime, to Oengus, without patronymic or other mark of identity. There is no substantial evidence to support Skene's belief that Oengus was unrelated to his predecessors and established a new family on the Pictish throne. If nomenclature is anything to go by, Oengus might have been a great-nephew of Brude mac Bile, who had died as king of Fortriu in 693. Oengus had a brother and a son called Brude, and a brother Talorgan.<h2>
<a name="ThedominanceofOengusmacForgusso732761"></a>The dominance of Oengus mac Forgusso, 732&#150;761</h2>Oengus is said to have reigned for thirty years. If this round number is correct, his reign was counted from 731. Bede, writing in that year, reported that Picts and Angles (Northumbrians) were now at peace with one another. The peace seems to have held for the rest of the decade while Oengus dealt vigorously with internal enemies and their allies. A <a name="cosubject_55353"></a><span class="headword">Talorg mac Congus</span>  (<em>d.</em> 734)<span class="occ"></span>, an ally of the Scottish D&uacute;ngal of Lorne, and a <a name="cosubject_55354"></a><span class="headword">Talorgan mac Drostan</span>  (<em>d.</em> 739)<span class="occ"></span>, were put to death by drowning, apparently on Oengus's orders. Drostan's son is described as king of Atholl at his death. Both men, it may be supposed, had been a threat to Oengus's kingship.<br>
<br>In 736 Oengus (on this occasion given his patronymic for the first time) entered territory of the D&aacute;l Riata in strength, along with his brother Talorgan. D&uacute;ngal of Lorne and his brother Feradach were captured. Oengus took the great fortress of Dunadd, and his brother routed an army led by Muredach, D&uacute;ngal's cousin. Oengus's son Brude died in the same year, but apparently not by violence.<br>
<br>Oengus no doubt took tribute and hostages from the D&aacute;l Riata after his campaign of 736. In 740 he is recorded as fighting the king of Northumbria. But it is not known what the Ulster annalist was referring to in 741: &#145;Smiting of Dalriada by Oengus&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ann. Ulster</span>, 194&#150;5).<br>
<br>In 750 Oengus's brother Talorgan was killed leading an army against the Strathclyde Britons. In the same year the annals of Ulster enter, in Irish, &#145;Ebbing of the sovereignty of Oengus&#146; (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 1.240; <span class="italic">Ann. Ulster</span>, 204&#150;5). The allusion must be, partly at least, to his hold on the D&aacute;l Riata (and it should be noted that the reign of their famous king Aed (&Aacute;ed) Find, who died in 778, was reckoned to have begun in 748). However, in 756 Oengus had an army at his command when he joined the Northumbrian king in a successful attack on the British stronghold of Dumbarton. His name may appear, in the form Unust, in a Northumbrian commemoration book, the <span class="italic">Liber vitae</span> of Durham, with the names of later Pictish kings.<br>
<br>Oengus died in 761. His brother Brude died two years later as king of Fortriu. The next king, Ciniod (Cinaed), son of Feradach, fought against Aed Find in 768. Since the battle was in Fortriu, it looks as if Aed was the aggressor.<h2>
<a name="FirstunionswithDlRiata761839"></a>First unions with D&aacute;l Riata 761&#150;839</h2>Ciniod died in 775. Four short reigns followed, of kings with Pictish names and seemingly Pictish fathers. The last one, Talorgan, son of Onuist, may have been the first Pictish king whose father also had been king. He, or his predecessor, Talorgan, son of Drostan, may be the Dubthalorc, king of Picts &#145;this side&#146; (presumably the south side) of the Mounth, who died in 782. The description seems to imply that it had not been usual for the Picts north and south of the Grampians to have separate overkingships. There follows the short reign of a man who appears in the annals twice as Conall, son of Tadg (both Irish names). The lists call him Canaul. The battle in which he was beaten by Constantine in 789 is said to be &#145;between Picts&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 1.254). Conall escaped, and later appears as king of the D&aacute;l Riata.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_6117"></a><span class="headword">Constantine <span class="st"> [Causantin]</span> mac Fergus</span>  (<em>d.</em> 820)<span class="occ"></span>, who ousted Conall (Canaul) in 789, is styled king of Fortriu at his death. For the last nine years of his life (811&#150;20) it seems that he held the overkingship of the D&aacute;l Riata also. He is presumed to have been a son of Aed Find's brother Fergus, who had been king of the D&aacute;l Riata from 778 to 781. Constantine was the first man, so far as is known, to hold the kingships of Pictland and D&aacute;l Riata simultaneously. There is nothing in the annals to suggest that his accession to the office in D&aacute;l Riata was other than peaceful. At this time the D&aacute;l Riata must have been living in fear of Scandinavian attacks, and perhaps welcomed a king with a secure base in the east. Constantine was credited with having built the church of Dunkeld.<br>
<br>Constantine was succeeded in 820 by his brother <a name="cosubject_55351"></a><span class="headword">Oengus</span>  (<em>d.</em> 834)<span class="occ"></span> in both the kingships. Oengus, often referred to by modern writers as Oengus II, died as king of Fortriu. The figures in the lists suggest that he may have resigned both kingships in 832. The building of the church of Kilrymont (St Andrews in modern Fife) is attributed to him by a note in the Q lists. The foundation legends name the founder as a Pictish king, (H)ungus, but it is impossible to be sure which king, Oengus I or II, the authors had in mind.<br>
<br>In the four years after Oengus the two kingships were again separate. The Pictish kingship was held jointly by a son of Constantine with the Pictish name of Drest, and a Talorgan, son of Uuthoil. In 836, by what means is unknown, the kingships of Pictland and D&aacute;l Riata were both, apparently, taken over by a son of Oengus called <a name="cosubject_55350"></a><span class="headword">Eogan&aacute;n</span>  (<em>d.</em> 839)<span class="occ"></span>, perhaps the potential founder of a patrilineal dynasty and a united kingdom. But in 839 he and his brother Bran, with many men of Fortriu, died in a battle against &#145;pagans&#146;; the first recorded encounter between Picts and Scandinavians.<br>
<br>A catalogue of kings and other notables in the <span class="italic">Liber vitae</span> of Durham includes Custantin (no. 80) and Uoenan (no. 100), believed to be Constantine, son of Fergus, and his nephew Eogan&aacute;n. Unust (no. 43) is thought to be Oengus I.<h2>
<a name="TheendofPictishindependence"></a>The end of Pictish independence</h2>After Eogan&aacute;n the Pictish lists enter Urad (Ferat), son of Bargoit (Badoc or the like), with a reign of three years (839&#150;42); and after him Bred (Brude) for one year or one month. (Brude is said to be a son of Ferat.) It must have been Urad (Ferat) who opposed Eogan&aacute;n's successor as overking of the D&aacute;l Riata, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55318/', "Alpin")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49278/', "D&#225;l Riata, kings of")</script>], Eochaid's son, and a grandson of Aed Find. Alpin is said to have died after a year (in 840) in warfare against the Picts.<br>
<br>
<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15398/', "Kenneth (Cinaed)")</script>, son of Alpin, seems to have waited for two years before entering Pictland to continue his father's warfare. In that year (842) Urad ended his reign, if not his life. After the short reign of Bred, one group of lists add a further three reigns totalling six years. The first and last of the three kings were Urad's sons. The second king's father was called Fochel, a possible scribal corruption of Eochaid; he may have been a kinsman of Kenneth. The last of the three, <a name="cosubject_55349"></a><span class="headword">Drust</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>848)<span class="occ"></span>, has a note: &#145;He was killed at Forteviot, according to others, at Scone&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 1.cxxviii), alluding, it must be supposed, to the legendary &#145;Treachery of Scone&#146; in which Picts were slaughtered by Scots.<br>
<br>Whether Drust's end was brought about directly by Kenneth or not, it is likely that during his first six years in the country Kenneth had to contend with an opposition centred on the successors of Urad. The topographical centre of opposition may have been in north-eastern Fortriu. A St Andrews foundation text, written in the twelfth century, connected Uurad (&#145;Pherath son of Bergeth&#146;) with Meigle in the extreme east of modern Perthshire. Kenneth died (in 858) at Forteviot, south of the Earn, and his son held an important council there. The earliest mention of Scone as a place of royal importance is in the reign of Kenneth's grandson Constantine.<br>
<br>Kenneth, son of Alpin, his brother Donald 
    (or Domnall; <i>d</i>. 862)
  , and two of Kenneth's sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6114/', "Constantine (or Causantin; r. 862&#150;77)")</script> and Aed (<i>r</i>. 877&#150;8), are all designated <i>rex Pictorum</i> in the annals of Ulster. Constantine's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7796/', "Donald (or Domnall; r. 899&#150;900)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6115/', "Constantine II")</script>] is the first to be called &#145;king of Alba&#146;. With his accession, if not before, the royal line of Fortriu must surely have been deemed extinct.<br>
