<span class="headword">Philips <span class="st"> [Phillips]</span>,  George</span>  (1629/30&#150;1696?), <span class="occ">writer and politician</span>, was the son of Dudley Phillips (1610&#150;1672) of Crondall, Hampshire, and Limavady, co. Londonderry, MP for Limavady and town governor in the 1640s. Dudley's father, Sir Thomas Phillips (<i>d</i>. 1636), was a captain in the English army which came to Ireland under Sir Samuel Bagenal. He was knighted at Drogheda in 1606, was governor of Londonderry, superintended the survey and plantation of co. Londonderry, for which he was granted 4 per cent of the temporal lands in the county, and settled at Limavady, where he was responsible for building the new town. The town was known from then until 1870 as Newtownlimavady.<br>
<br>George Philips's date of birth remains uncertain, though he was born at Crondall, attended Christ's Hospital school, and was aged fifteen when he was admitted on 20 June 1645 to Christ's College, Cambridge, from where he matriculated the following year. Although his father did not die until 1672, he seems to have inherited the Limavady estate prior to that date. In 1659 he attained the highest office in the Limavady corporation, that of the annual post of provost, and was elected MP for the borough in 1661. In 1662 he granted all the customs belonging to the markets of the corporation to the provost, while in 1669 he permitted the county sheriffs to hold their court leet within the corporation of Limavady, and in 1671 subscribed &pound;3 for a school and bells in Londonderry. From 1681 to 1684 he was governor of Culmore Fort, and seems to have filled the same post for Londonderry about this time.<br>
<br>At the revolution of 1688&#150;9 Philips took a leading role in the events surrounding the siege of Londonderry. When, on 6 December 1688, the Jacobite forces of the earl of Antrim, marching for Londonderry, approached Limavady, described in a contemporary account as &#145;a market town belonging to Col[onel] George Philips, twelve miles distant from Derry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reprint of Walker's Diary</span>, 15), Philips sent a dispatch to the city warning them of the dangers of admitting Antrim's forces. The next day he sent further word, advising the city &#145;to cause the gates &hellip; to be shut, and assured them he would be with them with his friends the day following, and would stand by them and would serve them to the hazard of his life and fortune&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reprint of Walker's Diary</span>, 15). His warnings led to the shutting of the city gates against Antrim's forces. Philips himself arrived in Londonderry on 9 December, having been sent by Antrim, ostensibly to negotiate with the inhabitants. However, a later report stated that Philips brought encouragement to the city's inhabitants &#145;with an auxiliary aid of six hundred horses of his tenants and neighbours, and reducing the untrained people of the place into order and discipline&#146;  (Treasury papers, TNA: PRO). At his own suggestion he was made a nominal prisoner, so that he could inform Antrim that he was detained, and that it was not safe for Antrim to attempt an entry. Antrim withdrew to Coleraine, while the city's inhabitants entrusted the governorship of Londonderry to Philips. On 11 December David Cairns was sent on Philips's advice to represent the case of the citizens in London. However, Philips was soon replaced as governor by Robert Lundy. On 23 March 1689 Philips, who was &#145;well acquainted with proceedings in England&#146;, was sent to London with an address to William III &#145;to solicit a speedy supply&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reprint of Walker's Diary</span>, 17, 21).<br>
<br>Philips remained in London for the next three months, writing a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The Interest of England in the Preservation of Ireland</span> (1689), in which he stated that he was &#145;animated and perhaps transported by a glowing zeal for religion, an anxious sympathy with his friends, and a pungent sense of his own sufferings&#146;. He called upon England to save the protestants of Ireland, and warned of the danger of allowing Ireland to fall into French hands. He has also been accredited with writing two other tracts, <span class="italic">Lex parliamentaria: the Law and Customs of Parliaments of England</span> (1690) and <span class="italic">A Problem Concerning the Gout, in a Letter to Sir John Gordon, F.R.S.</span> (1691). In this latter pamphlet he disclaims all knowledge of medicine, though in his youth he had been &#145;conversant in the most delightful study of anatomy&#146;. He based his claim to be heard on age and experience, and on the fact that he had had the gout for twenty years. &#145;In the tenets of religion&#146;, he incidentally remarks, &#145;I desire to be always orthodox&#146;.<br>
<br>Philips was ruined by the war, his house burnt down, and the improvements of more than eighty years laid waste. He was also imprisoned for debt relating to his involvement in the farms of the Irish revenue in the 1670s, though he was released on the instigation of the lord chancellor, Sir Charles Porter, an action that was to be included among the articles of impeachment against Porter in the Irish House of Commons in 1695. Philips was elected to the Commons for Londonderry County in 1692 and 1695. In 1694 he informed the Irish lord justice, Henry, Lord Capell, that an Irish parliament would meet in a better temper than that of 1692. He also stated that new laws were necessary for Ireland:<blockquote>How near were we in the last reign to feel the direful efforts of a bigoted clergy, actuated by Popish principles? And therefore how necessary it is to abolish that statute, <span class="italic">De heretico comburendo</span>? We want many beneficial laws relating to religion, peace, and our secular interest, in which England is beforehand with us, and has set us good precedents, easy to be copied. We have no coercive laws against Papists, nor punitive &hellip; and though by a side wind we drive them from sitting in Parliament, yet should they be hardened by a Jesuitical equivocation to claim their <i>right</i>, we cannot directly oppose them. (<span class="italic">Buccleuch MSS</span>, 2/1.104&#150;5)</blockquote>Philips appears to have died in 1696, while the Limavady estates were sold to William Conolly in 1700. Philips's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22133/', "William Philips (d. 1734)")</script>, an army officer and tory MP in the Irish parliament in Queen Anne's reign, became a noted dramatist.<br>
