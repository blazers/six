<span class="headword">Fauquier,  Francis</span>  (1703&#150;1768), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born in London after 26 March 1703 and was baptized on 11 July 1703 at St Andrew Undershaft, London. He was the second son of John Francis Fauquier (<i>d</i>. 1726) and Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Chamberlaine. His father was deputy to Isaac Newton, master worker of the Royal Mint, and left his son &pound;15,000 in stocks and annuities on his death. Little is known of Fauquier's early life, but he married Catherine Dalston (1710?&#150;1781) and by 1733 they had two sons, Francis and William. A 1730 portrait by William Hogarth of the Wollaston family, into which Fauquier's two sisters had married, includes Fauquier and his wife, and suggests a close extended family. How Fauquier occupied himself in these years is unclear, though in 1733 he became a freeman of Ipswich. However, he was evidently interested in finance and economics, and between 1748 and 1757 he served as one of thirty directors of the South Sea Company. In 1751 he was elected a governor of the Foundling Hospital in London, and he served on its general committee. Subsequently he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London (1753) and a corresponding member of the Society of Arts (1757).<br>
<br>Fauquier was appointed lieutenant-governor of Virginia on 10 February 1758, and he arrived in the colony in June. It was a difficult time in Virginia. The war with France continued, and the colony was hard pressed to provide support for the war effort, a situation that was exacerbated by short crops of tobacco. While he was sensitive to the colony's concerns, Fauquier was faced with conflicting demands. To fund the military needs the colony emitted paper currency, which was an anathema to British merchants. Because of the shortage of tobacco the Virginia legislature passed the second of two temporary laws, collectively the <span class="roman">Two Penny Acts</span>, which pegged payment of the clergy, who were normally paid in tobacco, at 2<i>d</i>. a pound&#151;much below the current price. Such a law required a suspending clause, pending the king's approval, but since the clause would have been the equivalent of rejecting the law, Fauquier ignored the requirement. He explained that the legislation was aimed at easing &#145;the people from a Burthen &hellip; thought to be too great for them to bear&#146;  (<span class="italic">Official Papers</span>, 1.144&#150;5). This got him in trouble with the clergy and with the British authorities. He also failed the direction of the Board of Trade to separate the office of speaker of the house of burgesses from that of treasurer&#151;offices that were held by John Robinson, Virginia's most powerful political figure. To do so would, he argued, &#145;throw the Country into a Flame&#146;  (ibid., 1.204&#150;5) and prevent him from gaining the necessary support for the war. Fauquier survived these problems, but relations between Britain and her colonies worsened, a situation that was fuelled by the passage of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> in 1765. Repeal of the act a year later did not lessen discontent, and his desire to see relations improve was not fulfilled during his tenure.<br>
<br>Fauquier was a cultured gentleman of liberal persuasion with wide-ranging intellectual interests. Selected Virginians whom he involved in these pursuits included George Wythe, William Small, professor of natural philosophy at the College of William and Mary, and a young student, Thomas Jefferson. He frequently invited this group to dinner, where Jefferson later said he heard &#145;More good sense, more rational and philosophical conversations&#146; than at any time in his life  (Malone, 1.73). A devoted musician, Fauquier also included Jefferson and Wythe in a chamber music group. To &eacute;lite Virginians he &#145;personified the best elements of the English gentry tradition and culture&#146;  (Hood, 285).<br>
<br>Fauquier had been periodically ill from early in his administration, and in February 1768 he became gravely so. He died at Williamsburg on 3 March 1768, and was buried on 8 March in the &#145;north aisle of Bruton parish church in Williamsburg&#146;  (<span class="italic">Official Papers</span>, 1.xxxviii). The funeral address described Fauquier's administration as having been conducted with a &#145;fair and even hand between the Prerogative &amp; Authority of our Mother Country, &amp; the Rights &amp; Priviledges of America&#146;  (ibid., 1.xxxix).<br>
