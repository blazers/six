<span class="headword">Bankes <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hawtrey]</span>,  Mary</span>, Lady Bankes  (<em>d.</em> 1661), <span class="occ">royalist landholder</span>, was the only daughter and an heir of Ralph Hawtrey (1570&#150;1638) and his wife, Mary Altham (1578&#150;1647). The Hawtreys claimed Norman descent and established themselves in Ruislip, Middlesex, in the sixteenth century. In 1618 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1288/', "Sir John Bankes (1589&#150;1644)")</script>, a successful lawyer, knighted in 1634, and successively attorney-general and chief justice of the common pleas. Between 1621 and 1644 they had fourteen children. In 1635 Bankes bought Corfe Castle, Dorset, which henceforth became the family's seat.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of civil war Bankes accompanied the king to Oxford; he was impeached by parliament in 1643. Lady Bankes retired to Corfe Castle which, set on a steep hill and commanding the entrance to the Isle of Purbeck, was regarded as &#145;one of the impregnablest Forts of the Kingdome&#146;  (Ryves, 98). Parliamentarian soldiers first attempted to occupy it in 1643 under cover of a traditional May day stag hunt but, forewarned, she denied them entrance, and &#145;very wisely, and like her selfe&#146;  (ibid., 100), called in a guard. With her small force&#151;reputedly only five men and her women servants&#151;she repelled attempts to seize the castle's four cannon, and in the succeeding lull she built up supplies and called in a garrison of eighty royalist soldiers. On 23 June the castle was surrounded by Sir Walter Erle, a Dorset neighbour, with five or six hundred men, but bombardment and threats against the defenders, and promises of rewards to the parliamentarian soldiers, proved equally ineffective. When a storm was finally attempted Lady Bankes, her daughters, and women servants joined in the defence by dropping stones and hot embers over the walls onto the attackers. Erle's casualties were heavy, and on 4 August, after learning of the approach of relieving forces, he precipitately departed. Though an undistinguished affair, this first siege demonstrated Lady Bankes's resourcefulness and &#145;brave resolution&#146;  (ibid., 107).<br>
<br>On 28 December 1644 Sir John Bankes died suddenly in Oxford. As his executor Lady Bankes had to deal with the legal and financial problems associated with inheritance by minor children, as well as with the burdens of heavy tax assessments and punitive sequestration of the estate. A parliamentarian tax assessment of &pound;300 on 8 January 1645 was followed by assessment at &pound;1000 on 30 May. She did not pay, and on 22 September the committee for the advance of money ordered that she be taken to London in custody. On 1 October it ordered her committed to the Peterhouse in London, and on 6 October she agreed to pay the &pound;1000 within fourteen days. Meanwhile she also faced the consequences of her husband's sequestration. A pass for her to go to London to compound had been issued on 16 July, and on 2 September she submitted the first of several petitions. On 10 September the Commons, before the sequestration committee had reached its decision, awarded &pound;100 from the first profits of sale to the daughters of Captain Robert Turpin, executed after conviction by Sir John Bankes and other royalist judges. Lady Bankes petitioned again on 15 October on behalf of her ten minor children. She explained that the manor of Andleby, Lincolnshire, had been settled on her for life at the time of her marriage while Sir John had, in 1642, settled Dorset lands comprising most of the estate on her for the benefit of the younger children until the heir, John, now twenty, reached the age of twenty-four. As this settlement predated Sir John's sequestration, she urged either that the sequestration be removed or that she should be allowed to compound for it and for her son's wardship. She added that only a few years remained in which to raise portions and maintenance for the younger children. Finally, she asked that her &pound;1000 assessment payment should be considered in the composition.<br>
<br>Lady Bankes and her advisers hoped to preserve the family's fortunes by appeals to law and compassion. These efforts were undercut by the fact that Corfe Castle continued to hold out and on 27 November 1645 the question was raised as to whether she should be allowed to compound before Corfe was reduced. In December Sir Thomas Fairfax turned serious attention to the castle. Lady Bankes rejected an opportunity to escape, but one defending colonel deserted in February 1646 while Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Pitman offered to deliver the castle in return for future protection. He brought up 200 parliamentarians disguised as royalists, half of whom secured admission. Faced by renewed attack without and interlopers within, the defenders succumbed to &#145;stratagem and storm&#146;  (Sprigge, 334&#150;5) and finally surrendered on 27 February 1646 after a siege of forty-eight days. The terms were generous if imperfectly observed, and the parliamentarian commander Colonel Bingham, a neighbour, returned the keys of the castle to Lady Bankes as a gesture of respect for her courage. On 5 March 1646 parliament voted that the castle be demolished. It was stripped of its rich contents and of its stone and timber, but the massive surviving ruins bear witness to the impossibility of total destruction. The keys were later enshrined in the family's new house at Kingston Lacy, Dorset.<br>
<br>On 4 February 1646 Lady Bankes's status as a delinquent royalist in her own right, independent of her husband, had been reasserted. In June, Dorset officials reminded London of her active defence of the castle and inquired &#145;whether your Lordships are not informed of any delinquency in her since her husband's decease&#146;  (Bankes, 307). In early 1647 her petitions were finally answered, the committee for compounding setting fines of &pound;380 on her own estate, &pound;1794 on her son John's, and &pound;444 on that held by trustees for the younger children. After minor adjustments to these figures parliament formally pardoned her and discharged the sequestration in September 1647. In several cases between 1648 and 1650 she secured reductions on assessments. In the latter year her major responsibility for the estate ended when John Bankes turned twenty-four, but she, John, and the children's trustees again faced heavy taxes in 1651. She was also fined &pound;350 for under-reporting the value of lands in Dorset, and was penalized for a similar offence in 1652. Thereafter she seems to have escaped serious financial scrutiny. In her financial dealings she displayed the same persistence and adroitness demonstrated in her defence of Corfe Castle, while benefiting from the services of family associates including Giles Green MP, co-trustee and tenant, her kinsman John Hawtrey, and her &#145;most affectionate servant&#146; John Hunt. She sought to trace the dispersed contents of Corfe Castle; one agent's report in January 1647 recorded tapestries, carpets, and furniture that had found their way to a London broker and a Dutch merchant. Losses, meticulously chronicled, remained a persistent irritant in relations with Dorset neighbours such as Erle, Bingham, and humble but opportunist local people into whose hands Bankes goods had strayed. After John Bankes's death in 1656 his brother Ralph continued his mother's efforts to retrieve these goods, with little success.<br>
<br>Lady Bankes apparently spent her later years in London and at Damory Court, Dorset. She died without fuss and &#145;with great peace of mind&#146;  (Bankes, 245) on 11 April 1661. Her memorial, erected in St Martin's Church, Ruislip, by Ralph Bankes, declared that she &#145;had the honour to have borne with a constancy and courage above her sex a noble propor&ccedil;on of the late calamities, and the happiness to have outlived them&#146;  (ibid., 245). A surviving copy of a contemporary miniature shows her as a determined widow. The circumstances of civil war forced her to turn that determination not only to the military action for which she attained a degree of fame but, like many other women who gained no such renown, to the preservation of the family fortunes.<br>
