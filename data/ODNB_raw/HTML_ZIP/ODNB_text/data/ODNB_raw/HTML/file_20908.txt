<span class="headword">Ostler,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1614), <span class="occ">actor</span>, had a brief but notable career among the King's Men early in the seventeenth century. He first appears as a boy actor among the children of the Chapel Royal who performed Jonson's <span class="italic">Poetaster</span> at the Blackfriars playhouse in 1601. He was probably also a chorister, since he is not one of the seven chapel boys mentioned in December 1601 as actors not musicians. He next appears on 11 April 1609 as the first of three players, all recently or still belonging to the Chapel Royal, who performed a hastily arranged entertainment (published by J. Knowles in Butler, 1999), written by Jonson, mounted by Inigo Jones, and played before the king and the royal family at the opening of the New Exchange in the Strand. He played a shopkeeper and was by this time an adult, for he had a servant, Giles Gary, who played the boy in the shop (the other actor was Nathan Field, who played the key keeper). Probably later in that year Ostler was one of the players from the Chapel Royal whom the King's Men took on as adults &#145;to strengthen the Kings service&#146; when the King's Men began to use the Blackfriars playhouse as well as the Globe  (TNA: PRO, LC 5/133, p. 50).<br>
<br>Ostler soon became a principal member of the King's Men. He appears in the cast lists of six of the company's plays: Jonson's <span class="italic">Alchemist</span> (1610) and <span class="italic">Catiline</span> (1611); Beaumont and Fletcher's <span class="italic">Captain</span> (<i>c</i>.1609&#150;12), <span class="italic">Bonduca</span> (<i>c</i>.1609&#150;14), and <span class="italic">Valentinian</span> (<i>c</i>.1610&#150;14); and Webster's <span class="italic">Duchess of Malfi</span> (<i>c</i>.1612&#150;14). In this last play he played Antonio, a virtuous hero surrounded by corruption, the only part he is known to have played in a regular play. In celebrating a brawl in which Ostler came off badly, John Davies called him in 1611, perhaps ironically, &#145;the Roscius of these times&#146; and &#145;Sole King of Actors&#146;  (Davies, epigram 205). Ostler acquired the lease of a share in the Blackfriars playhouse on 20 May 1611, and he bought one in the Globe on 20 February 1612, so that he held a seventh of one playhouse and a fourteenth of the other, both leases to expire in 1629.<br>
<br>Ostler married Thomasin, daughter of the actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12890/', "John Heminges")</script>, who was the company's treasurer, about 1611, when she would have been sixteen. The Ostlers' child, Beaumont (named presumably for the playwright), was baptized on 18 May 1612 at St Mary Aldermanbury, London, where Heminges lived and Thomasin had been baptized on 15 January 1595. Ostler died intestate, apparently in his twenties, on 16 December 1614, leaving to his widow (who became his administratrix six days later) only his two shares &#145;for her relief and maintenance&#146; along with debts of &#145;a very great value&#146;  (TNA: PRO, KB 27/1454/1/m. 692). She gave the shares to her father in trust and in 1615 brought a famous lawsuit against him when he would not return them or give her the income from them.<br>
