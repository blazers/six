<span class="headword">Bradford,  John <span class="st"> [Si&ocirc;n]</span></span>  (1706&#150;1785), <span class="occ">poet and antiquary</span>, was the son of a Richard Bradford (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1700&#150;1750) who lived at Y Pandy, Betws Tir Iarll, in upper Glamorgan. Little definite is known of his father, but he was probably a weaver, fuller, and dyer, as his son became. A tradition existed in the family that the Bradfords, who had their own coat of arms, had moved to Betws from Bradford-on-Avon in the early seventeenth century.<br>
<br>Bradford became a prominent figure among the small, cultured fraternity of bards that emerged in upper Glamorgan during the first half of the eighteenth century and played an important role in the literary renaissance that occurred in the county at that time. He appears to have applied himself diligently in his youth to studying the ancient Welsh bardic traditions and collecting Welsh manuscripts. There is some evidence that he acquired several of the manuscript volumes of the cultured Powel family of Tir Iarll. He was undoubtedly acquainted with the works of many English authors and literary critics, and it is said that some of the English volumes he had acquired were still in the possession of his descendants in the nineteenth century. However, very little of his verse is now extant, and the few surviving examples do not suggest that he was endowed with much poetic ability. A staunch nonconformist, he acquired some repute as a rationalist, and the works of some of the more prominent eighteenth-century deists made a deep impression on him. He was known to the influential Morris circle in north Wales, and he corresponded with both William Wynn (1709&#150;1760) of Llangynhafal and Lewis Morris (1701&#150;1765), the celebrated Welsh poet and scholar, who described Bradford, in a characteristically sarcastic manner, as &#145;the Prime of South Wales Poets&#146;. He was elected a member of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion, London.<br>
<br>The most talented of his pupils was the renowned Welsh literary forger Iolo Morganwg 
    (Edward Williams; 1747&#150;1826)
  , who, after Bradford's death, invented many stories about his erudition and his connection with the druidic and Unitarian bardic system which, he claimed, had uniquely persisted in Glamorgan throughout the centuries, and especially in Tir Iarll. Iolo frequently maintained that it was in Bradford's manuscripts that he had found many of the details that were later shown to be the product of his own fertile imagination. Much that was written about Bradford in the nineteenth century must, therefore, be treated with the greatest caution.<br>
<br>Bradford was buried on 6 June 1785 in Betws and his will was proved at Cowbridge on 11 October that year. After specifying certain sums he bequeathed to his daughters and to his wife, Alice, he left the remainder of his possessions entirely to his son, Richard, who was blind. However, his will contained no reference to his collection of books and manuscripts. He expressed the wish to be buried &#145;with my ancestors in the parish church of Betws in a decent manner without any funeral pomp and with as little expense as decency will admit of&#146;. In July 1785, approximately a month after his death, William Thomas (1727&#150;1795), the schoolmaster of St Bride's-super-Ely, wrote in his diary, which is a valuable chronicle of events in Glamorgan in his day: &#145;Was lately buried at Betws near Bridgend John Bradford a fuller and a dyer of 80 yrs of age. a great disbater and a Nominated Deist or a freethinker.&#146; Nevertheless, the Betws parish registers show that he was a churchwarden in 1767&#150;8 and that his son, Richard, served in a similar capacity in 1787&#150;8.<br>
<br>After John Bradford's death his son, Richard, continued to work as a weaver and fuller in Betws. An employee of his, named David James, who played a prominent role in the Unitarian movement in Tir Iarll and its neighbourhood, married a niece to Richard Bradford. Their great-granddaughter became the wife of John Kyrle Fletcher, a well-known bookseller in his day in Newport, Monmouthshire.<br>
