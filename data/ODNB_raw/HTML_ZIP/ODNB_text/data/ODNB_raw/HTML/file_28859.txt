<span class="headword">Watson,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1559), <span class="occ">lawyer and evangelical preacher</span>, was born in the city of Norwich. He was admitted BCL at Oxford on 1 July 1528. Nothing else is known about Watson before 1539. On 23 February that year, Bishop William Rugge preached a sermon at Norwich arguing that good works played a qualified role in the attainment of salvation. Watson called on the bishop the next day and vigorously criticized the sermon, denying that humans had free will. Rumours about the encounter circulated, the matter escalated, and Rugge, intimidated by the number of Watson's supporters, denounced his critic to the authorities. This manoeuvre backfired. Thomas Cromwell summoned Watson to London and interrogated him about the incident. Cromwell was so impressed with Watson that he wrote to the mayor and aldermen of Norwich, recommending that Watson be given a municipal office. The Norwich civic leaders wrote back to Cromwell declaring that, because they knew Watson to be learned in both scripture and law, they would make him town clerk. Watson, however, never took the post, probably because even greater opportunities were available elsewhere.<br>
<br>It is likely that Cromwell had recommended Watson to Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, as well as to the city fathers of Norwich. John Bale claimed that Watson became Cranmer's steward. There is no corroboration for this and Watson seems to have spent a considerable amount of time away from Cranmer's household. But Bale's statement cannot be lightly dismissed. He and Watson shared a close friend in John Barrett, a former Carmelite and popular evangelical preacher in Norwich, so Bale would have been well informed about Watson. Furthermore, Watson was described in a document of 1550 as a priest in Cranmer's household. In any case, Watson had unmistakable official support in building a career in the church, despite having never been ordained. Early in Edward VI's reign he was granted a national preaching licence, in which he was inaccurately styled &#145;Professor of Divinity&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 10/2/34, fol. 116<i>r</i>). Then on 26 May 1549 he received a prebend in Norwich Cathedral despite his not being a priest and despite (as the letters patent for the living noted) his having been married twice. This benefice suggests that, whatever his connection to Cranmer's household, Watson remained active in his native Norwich. In 1548 a member of the confraternity of St George in Norwich was stripped of his civic privileges for refusing, on religious grounds, to provide the annual feast for the members of the confraternity. Watson not only used his legal skills to defend the man, he also had the case brought before the privy council. Protector Somerset ordered that Watson's client have his privileges restored.<br>
<br>Watson was also prominent in the early stages of the most momentous event in the history of Tudor Norwich: Kett's rebellion. He preached to the rebels and was one of a trio of leading Norwich residents (including the mayor) elected as nominal leaders of the rising. As protest escalated into overt rebellion and events spun out of control, the trio fell out with Kett and were imprisoned by the rebels. None of this harmed Watson's relationship with Cranmer; in the following year, 1550, he received one of the plum livings in the archbishop's gift, the rectory of Saltwood, in Kent.<br>
<br>Mary's accession to the throne deprived Watson of his patron and his livings, but worse was to follow. Early in 1554 Henry Crook, the mayor of Norwich, questioned Watson about his failure to attend mass; Watson answered that attending mass was against his conscience and refused ever to be present when it was celebrated. He was arrested and formally examined by the civic authorities, and then imprisoned while they wrote to the privy council for instructions. The council ordered that Watson be sent to London. This time, instead of meeting an appreciative Cromwell, Watson faced a blistering interrogation by Stephen Gardiner. He refused to submit, and in February 1554 was returned to Norwich, where on the council's order he was placed in the custody of Miles Spencer, the chancellor of the diocese. Watson was confined in the episcopal palace, and by his own account was well treated, although he was denied visitors.<br>
<br>In spring 1555 John Barrett, now a loyal Catholic, wrote to Watson urging him to recant and trying to persuade him of the truth of the real presence in the sacrament. More ominously, John Christopherson, the dean of Norwich, visited Watson and debated eucharistic theology with him. Eventually Watson was given a statement to sign, declaring his unqualified belief in transubstantiation. Watson signed the document but not before adding the crucial proviso: &#145;I assent to all these [doctrines] in so far as they are based on the Word of God and in the sense in which they are understood by the catholic Church and by the holy fathers&#146;  (Watson, <span class="italic">Aetiologia</span>, sig. G3<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). The document was witnessed by Christopherson, Spencer, Barrett, Thomas Pecock (a prebendary of Norwich Cathedral), and Alexander Mather, a Norwich alderman who had been active in persecuting Watson. The document was seized upon by the authorities; it was read aloud in St Peter Mancroft, one of Norwich's leading churches, during services.<br>
<br>Yet subscribing to the document did not end Watson's troubles. He was detained in prison for another five weeks before being released in late spring 1555. John Young, the vice-chancellor of Cambridge University, objected that Watson's signed statement was not sufficient and demanded that Watson sign an unqualified declaration of belief in transubstantiation. Orders were given that Watson be rearrested but he went into hiding. Although two Norwich aldermen, Thomas Codde and Thomas Marsham, zealously pursued the fugitive, Watson's friends successfully threw them off his trail and concealed him. He soon fled overseas to Emden.<br>
<br>From this haven Watson wrote an account of his Marian ordeals, the <span class="italic">Aetiologia</span>, which was designed to demonstrate that he had emerged from them &#145;unharmed in body and undiminished in conscience&#146;  (Watson, <span class="italic">Aetiologia</span>, title-page). The book was finished by November 1555 and published (only in Latin) in Emden in 1556. Beyond this little is known of Watson's activities in exile, although he and John Scory apparently debated the subject of free will with Wouter Delenus, a leading member of the Emden reformed community. The wheel had come full circle: Watson sprang into prominence championing predestination and his last known public activity was to defend the doctrine in disputation. Having returned to England, Watson died in 1559, when his will was proved.<br>
