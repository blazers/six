<span class="headword">Walcott,  John</span>  (1754&#150;1831), <span class="occ">naturalist</span>, was born on 8 August 1754, probably in Cork, where he was baptized, the eldest son of John Walcott and Mary Yeamans. He lived in England with his father between 1756 and 1766. The family owned estates at Croagh, near Limerick, and lived off the rents of these estates, in some style. The elder John Walcott died in 1776 in Bath, leaving evidence of a wide range of bookish interests in both natural history and geology. He had been elected a fellow of the Society of Arts in 1766. His son inherited his scholarly interests and remained in Bath between 1776 and 1783. He was an early disciple of Carolus Linnaeus (1707&#150;1778), and inspired by Linnaeus's death, he published a never completed <span class="italic">Flora Britannica &hellip; Taken from Linnaeus's Systema naturae</span>, in fourteen monthly parts in Bath between 1778 and 1779. His book <span class="italic">Description and Figures of Petrifactions Found in Quarries, Gravel Pits etc Near Bath</span> followed in 1779. This contained the first illustrations of the commonest fossils to be found around Bath, later known as the cradle of English geology from the work there of William Smith (1769&#150;1839), who was to acknowledge his debt to Walcott. One of the fossils so well illustrated in Walcott's <span class="italic">Description</span>, showing its internal spiralia, was named <i>Spiriferina walcotti</i> by James Sowerby in 1822.<br>
<br>Walcott was twice married. On 21 November 1777 he married Anne Lloyd, who died in 1782. On 15 November 1783 he married Dorothy Mary Lyons (1759&#150;1832). There were children from both marriages.<br>
<br>Bath, during the period that Walcott lived there, was a hive of intellectual activity. In 1779 Walcott, already a member of the Bath Agricultural Society, became a founder member of the first Bath Philosophical Society. He moved to nearby Bathford in 1783, and adopted a highly peripatetic lifestyle, moving round the country renting (often large and impressive) houses to live in. By 1784 he was at West Teignmouth in Devon. Here he planned, and certainly commenced, a work on British fishes, for which he made over one hundred drawings during his stay in Devon in 1784 and 1785. This was never published probably because of the too limited sales of his earlier books. He lived in Chelsea, London, from 1787 to 1788. Here he published his third book, <span class="italic">The figures, description and history of exotic animals, comprised under the classes Amphibia and Pisces of Linnaeus</span>, in two parts in 1788. His final book, in two volumes, <span class="italic">Synopsis of British Birds</span>, appeared between 1789 and 1792 when he was based at Greenwich. Here he remained until 1802, although he seems to have taken little further interest in natural history, apart from subscribing to new books. He lived in Bristol between 1803 and 1819, in Southampton in 1819 and 1820, and at Highnam Court, Gloucestershire, from 1821 to 1827. By 1829 he had returned to Bathwick and he died in Great Pulteney Street, Bath, on 5 February 1831.<br>
<br>Walcott had led a very private life. He changed his name to Sympson in 1819 on the death of a cousin, but seems soon to have reverted to using his original name. He was a devoted member of the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion in Bath and later joined the Wesleyan Methodists. His other devotion, to natural history, is best proved by the forenames given to some of his many children, such as Scopoli, Linnaeus, and Ray.<br>
