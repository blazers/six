<span class="headword">Tomkins,  Martin</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1755), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and religious writer</span>, was born in the late seventeenth century, possibly in Abingdon, Berkshire, but little is known about his early life. He appears to have been closely related to Hardinge Tomkins, an attorney of note and clerk to the Company of Fishmongers, who may even have been his brother. In 1699 he travelled with Nathaniel Lardner to the Netherlands to study at the University of Utrecht, and met Daniel Neal there, but his name does not appear on the university's register of students. On 8 September 1702 he was admitted to the University of Leiden. In the following year he returned to England, accompanied by Lardner and Neal, and in 1707 he was appointed minister to the Presbyterian congregation in Church Street, Stoke Newington. At first his ministry was successful but it later became apparent that he differed from his congregation on important doctrinal subjects. Suspected of entertaining Arian views he was dismissed in July 1718, after which he published a defence of his opinions and of his right to hold views that differed from Trinitarian orthodoxy, in a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The Case of Martin Tomkins</span> (1719).<br>
<br>Tomkins did not again settle as a pastor of a congregation but he did preach occasionally. When, for instance, William Whiston met him &#145;about 1720&#146; he was living at Burtonwood, Essex, and lodging with Mr Barber, the dissenting minister there, who &#145;invited him sometimes to preach for him&#146;  (Whiston, 295). Later he lived in Hackney, where he attended the ministry of John Barker, an uncompromising Trinitarian. Although in general Tomkins approved Barker's public ministrations he was dissatisfied with the Trinitarian doxologies that Barker preached at the close of his prayers. During this later period of his life Tomkins was engaged primarily in writing theological works against trinitarianism. The first of these, published anonymously in 1723 as an answer to Isaac Watts's <span class="italic">The Christian Doctrine of the Trinity</span>, was entitled <span class="italic">A sober appeal to a Turk or an Indian concerning the plain sense of scripture relating to the Trinity</span>. A second edition appeared in 1748 with additional tracts in answer to Watts's and Daniel Waterland's criticisms of his first edition. In 1732 he published <span class="italic">Jesus Christ the Mediator between God and Man</span>, a work in which he again argued against Christ's divinity. His most significant work was inspired by his distaste for John Barker's use of Trinitarian doxologies and entitled <span class="italic">A calm enquiry whether we have any warrant from scripture for addressing ourselves in a way of prayer or praise directly to the Holy Spirit</span> (1738). This was much admired by anti-Trinitarians and, according to Joshua Toulmin, &#145;contributed very much to the disuse of the Trinitarian doxology amongst the dissenters&#146;  (Toulmin, xvii). This was Tomkins's last major publication. He died, probably in Hackney, in 1755.<br>
