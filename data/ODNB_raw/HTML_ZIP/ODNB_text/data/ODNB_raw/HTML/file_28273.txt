<span class="headword">Victoria, Princess</span> <span class="st"> [Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]</span>, duchess of Kent  (1786&#150;1861), <span class="occ">mother of Queen Victoria</span>, was the fourth daughter of Franz Friedrich Anton (Francis), duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld  (<i>b</i>. 1750), and his wife, Augusta Caroline Sophia, the daughter of Count Reuss-Ebersdorf. She was born Victoria Mary Louisa at Coburg on 17 August 1786 and married, first, in 1803, Emich Charles, prince of Leiningen (<i>d</i>. 1814), with whom she had a son, Charles, and a daughter, Feodore, and second, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8526/', "Edward, duke of Kent (1767&#150;1820)")</script>, the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10540/', "George III")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5162/', "Queen Charlotte")</script>. They had one daughter, the future <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36652/', "Queen Victoria")</script>.<br>
<br>Widowed first in 1814, Victoria was persuaded by her brother Prince Leopold, the widower of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5160/', "Princess Charlotte")</script>, George IV's heir, to marry Prince Edward and secure the English succession. They married at Coburg on 29 May 1818 (Lutheran rite) and at Kew Palace on 13 July. Although the duchess was pregnant, the couple lived abroad until just before the birth of Princess (Alexandrina) Victoria at Kensington Palace on 24 May 1819. Fortunately the sensible duchess brought with her Frau Siebold, a German doctor, and nursed her baby, though a wet-nurse was usually hired. Suddenly, on 23 January 1820, the duke died of pneumonia in Devon, leaving her in straits.<br>
<br>Money was not the only problem during the first eighteen years of the mother&#150;daughter relationship with Princess Victoria. Parliament and Prince Leopold made necessary contributions. The main trouble was a bitter division in the duchess's household. Springing from fierce rivalries between Baroness Lehzen, Princess Victoria's beloved governess, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37309/', "Sir John Ponsonby Conroy")</script>, the duchess's major-domo, the schism developed into a tight domestic cabal known as the Kensington system. At its centre lay Conroy's ambition to run not only the mother's household but also the daughter's future court. Conroy played on the duchess's fears of the royal family. Would they not kidnap Victoria unless she was closely guarded? Accordingly she was kept away from her royal relatives and, until her accession, was made to sleep in her mother's bedroom. Queen Victoria criticized &#145;Mama&#146; for limiting her close childhood friends to Feodore (who married abroad in 1828) and Conroy's daughters Victoire and Elizabeth Jane.<br>
<br>The diarist Charles Greville noticed Conroy's familiarities with the duchess, and thought they must be lovers. The duke of Wellington agreed. Lord Melbourne, the prime minister, told the speaker of the House of Commons: &#145;God, I don't like the man; there seems to be something odd about him&#146;  (Queen Victoria, journal, 29 April 1838). There was indeed something odd: Conroy cherished the illusion that his wife had royal blood, making them all semi-royal. But if Conroy did have a royal mistress, it was more likely to have been Princess Sophia, another inhabitant of Kensington Palace. She corresponded familiarly while Conroy managed&#151;or mismanaged&#151;her finances, as he did the duchess's. No lovers for the duchess.<br>
<br>Melbourne considered the duchess foolish and weak-minded; but she was pious. She would not let Victoria read a novel such as <span class="italic">Oliver Twist</span>. In her diary, studied by a deeply remorseful Queen Victoria after her death, the duchess expressed touching devotion to a child who had believed herself unloved and who took to calling the pair curtly in <i>her</i> diary Ma and JC. The duchess claimed that Conroy was useful because he organized tours to show Victoria to the people. Though these &#145;royal progresses&#146; infuriated William IV, they educated the princess. Her mother hoped she would first reign as a minor (under eighteen) with herself as regent. But William survived until 20 June 1837, when his niece was over eighteen.<br>
<br>As the queen's mother, the duchess found her trials increased. Victoria quitted her bedroom; night fell on the duchess for nearly three gloomy years. After the coronation Queen Victoria kissed her aunt Queen Adelaide, but only shook her mother's hand. When Lady Flora Hastings, her mother's lady-in-waiting, was dying of a liver tumour, Victoria and Lehzen decided she was &#145;<i>with child!</i>&#146;&#151;by JC  (Queen Victoria, journal, 3 Feb 1839).<br>
<br>There was &#145;a schocking alternative&#146;  (Queen Victoria, journal, 17 April 1839) to life with Ma&#151;marriage. On 10 February 1840 Victoria married the duchess's nephew Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Conroy and Lehzen were both tactfully ejected, and Queen Victoria entered her &#145;safe haven&#146;  (Longford, 165&#150;6). The duchess spent twenty harmonious years at court and with her grandchildren, and was the first to spot that the newborn Prince Leopold was affected by an undiagnosed illness (in fact haemophilia). She died of cancer at Frogmore House, Windsor, on 16 March 1861 and, after temporary interment in St George's Chapel, Windsor, was buried in the Royal Mausoleum at Frogmore. Queen Victoria broke down with grief and guilt. Nine months later she lost her husband also.<br>
