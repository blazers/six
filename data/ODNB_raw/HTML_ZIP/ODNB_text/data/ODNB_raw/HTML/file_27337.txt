<span class="headword">Thorn, Sir  Nathaniel</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1857), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was commissioned ensign in the 3rd (Buffs) on 15 October 1802, and became lieutenant on 25 June 1803. He went with his regiment to Madeira in December 1807, and from there to Portugal in August 1808. The Buffs did not take part in the advance into Spain under Moore, but they formed part of Wellesley's army in 1809. They were the first troops to cross the Douro, and at Talavera they were hotly engaged as part of Hill's division, Thorn being in command of the light company.<br>
<br>Thorn was promoted captain on 4 January 1810, and in March he was appointed deputy assistant quartermaster-general to the 2nd division. He held this post until the end of the war. He was present at Busaco, the first siege of Badajoz, Albuera, Arroyo Molinos de Montanches, Almaraz, Vitoria, the battles of the Pyrenees, the Nivelle and the Nive, Garris, Orthez, Aire, and Toulouse. He was wounded at the battle of St Pierre (13 December 1813), and General W. Stewart strongly recommended him for promotion, as it was the fourth time he had brought his services to notice during that campaign. He received a brevet majority on 3 March 1814, and ultimately the silver medal with ten clasps.<br>
<br>In July 1814 Thorn was appointed assistant quartermaster-general to one of the brigades sent from Bordeaux to Canada, and he was present at the action at Plattsburg in September. He was made brevet lieutenant-colonel on 21 June 1817. On 14 August 1823 he was placed on half pay, but on 29 June 1826 he was appointed to the permanent staff of the quartermaster-general's department, on which he served for twenty years. He was promoted colonel on 10 January 1837, major-general on 9 November 1846, and lieutenant-general on 20 June 1854. On 25 July 1854 he was given the colonelcy of the Buffs. He was made CB in 1831, KH in 1832, and KCB in 1857. He went to Windsor for the installation on 24 January 1857, caught cold, and on his return home died suddenly at Upcott House, Bishop's Hull, near Taunton, Somerset, on the 28th. He was buried at Halse, Somerset, where a fine window was installed to his memory. He was married, and his wife survived him.<br>
