<span class="headword">Todd,  Anthony</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1718, <em>d.</em> 1798), <span class="occ">foreign secretary of the Post Office</span>, was born at Bridge End Farm, Frosterley, in co. Durham, and baptized at Stanhope, co. Durham, on 20 February 1718; he was the second son and fourth child of Thomas Todd (<i>bap</i>. 1677, <i>d</i>. 1765/6), farmer, and his wife, Eleanor Todd (<i>d</i>. 1773), of Dalton-le-Dale, co. Durham. His parents, who may have been related, since they had the same surname, worked Bridge End Farm and were near neighbours of Ferdinando Craggs, brother of the postmaster-general James Craggs (1657&#150;1721). The Westgarth family, which enjoyed close connections with the Post Office, also lived nearby.<br>
<br>Todd was probably educated at Wolsingham grammar school but from about 1732 he was trained in Post Office business by Charles Westgarth (<i>d</i>. 1733), clerk of the west road. John Westgarth, a clerk in the foreign office of the Post Office, subsequently gave him instruction in that organization's handling of diplomatic correspondence and overseas mail, and in its interception of suspicious items. In 1738 Todd was appointed to the foreign office, and in 1747 was made second clerk to George Shelvocke (1702&#150;1760), secretary of the Post Office. Such pluralism was unusual but arose from the upsurge of secret service business following the Jacobite rising of 1745. Todd was the obvious successor as foreign secretary of the Post Office when John Lefebure died in January 1752. This made him responsible for supervising the opening and copying of foreign correspondence, liaison with the deciphering branch to deal with intercepted items in code, and making recommendations to be laid before the king. As such he was in regular contact with the secretaries of state and the first lord of the Treasury. He enjoyed an annual income of about &pound;850 but only &pound;200 of this was official salary, the rest being secret service money. Todd soon recognized the existing system's over-reliance upon a small and ageing staff and made two recommendations, which were accepted by George II in 1754. These resulted in the appointment of a fourth copying clerk and the instruction of two young trainees in the arts of engraving forged seals and of opening and deciphering correspondence. Todd's foresight paid considerable dividends during the Seven Years' War, and in 1762 he was awarded a gift of &pound;500 for his services to the late king. At the same time his official salary was increased by &pound;100 a year.<br>
<br>On 12 June 1758 Todd married Ann Robinson (<i>d</i>. 1765), the daughter and heir of Christopher Robinson (<i>d</i>. 1762) of Appleby, Westmorland, resident surveyor in the Post Office. Her first cousin was the influential John Robinson, Treasury secretary under Lord North. The marriage brought Todd &pound;5000, with which he purchased an estate of about 150 acres at Walthamstow, Essex. His father-in-law's death in 1762 brought him property in the City of London and at Sandal, Yorkshire, as well as &pound;9000 in trust for his family. His wife gave birth to three daughters between 1761 and 1765 but the family's very happy home life came to an abrupt end when the third birth destroyed her health, and she died on 7 August. The youngest child survived her mother by only two months.<br>
<br>When Shelvocke died in March 1760 Pitt supported Todd for the resulting vacancy of secretary of the Post Office but Newcastle chose Henry Potts. Todd despised Potts and did everything in his power to undermine him but ministerial changes transformed his fortunes. In December 1762, several months after Bute succeeded Newcastle at the Treasury, Potts was dismissed. Todd replaced him but remained foreign secretary, which gave him unprecedented control over the Post Office and the secret and private offices. His annual income was now nearly &pound;2000 and between 1763 and 1765 he carefully built up his own connection. All the existing Post Office clerks were retired or transferred and the department became filled with his own dependants. His relations with the board were excellent and he claimed credit for the <span class="roman">Franking Act</span> of 1765.<br>
<br>When Rockingham took office in July 1765 joint postmaster-general Lord Hyde informed Grantham that Todd was &#145;experienced, able, active, obliging and honest&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PRO 30/8/64) and he was confirmed as foreign secretary within days. However, Rockingham's dismissal of the secretaries of state and the postmasters-general left Todd &#145;in a violent funk&#146;  (<span class="italic">Eglinton MSS</span>, 390) and on 19 July the new ministers restored Potts as secretary to the Post Office. Todd was obliged to withdraw to the secret office and to bear the loss of half his income. On Potts's sudden death, on 1 January 1768, Todd was immediately reappointed by the Chatham ministry to his old position, while again remaining foreign secretary.<br>
<br>For the next fifteen years Todd remained at the zenith of his influence and prestige. He enjoyed the confidence of successive postmasters-general, not least that of Francis Dashwood, eleventh Baron Le Despencer. With his backing Todd introduced several important innovations; in particular the collection of letters from London receiving houses was improved in 1769, the system of expresses was reformed in 1770, and a &#145;penny post office&#146; was established in Dublin in 1773. Le Despencer supported Todd's determination to protect the office from excessive political interest. Demands from MPs to appoint their local postmasters and a number of patronage requests from Lord North were all turned down. In return Todd looked after the joint postmaster-generals' interests and dependants, while continuing to advance his own increasingly powerful connection.<br>
<br>The American War of Independence diverted attention from reform to government service. Todd's robust health enabled him to endure a necessarily arduous workload. He was frequently at his desk until 3 a.m. and became renowned in the office for telling hilarious jokes designed to keep up everybody's spirits. Rising costs, the loss of forty boats, and serious damage to others hampered communication with the army in America but Todd's efforts successfully maintained a fleet for service. He also guarded against waste and fraud and promptly reverted to a peacetime establishment in 1783. His activities brought him highly lucrative rewards. He was worth at least &pound;60,000 in 1782, with an annual income approaching &pound;4000, over half of which was derived from poundage on packet expenditure.<br>
<br>In 1782 Todd secured a brilliant marriage for his second and only surviving daughter, Eleanour (1762&#150;1856), to James, Viscount Maitland (1759&#150;1839), son of the seventh earl of Lauderdale and at that time MP for Newport. Lauderdale, who had amassed substantial debts, accepted Todd's offer of &pound;30,000, and the marriage took place at Walthamstow on 15 August 1782. On his wedding day Maitland was promised &pound;1000 for each child of the marriage, and to Todd's delight a grandson, later the ninth earl, was born on 12 February 1784. A further eight siblings followed.<br>
<br>Todd's new son-in-law provided a valuable link to Charles James Fox, while the successful careers of his own friends gave him similar contact with the younger Pitt and his supporters. Todd considered himself &#145;above being of any one party whatever&#146;  (Lauderdale MSS, priv. coll. 26 July 1782) but several new factors began to threaten his influence. As the movement for economical reform gathered pace there were repeated Treasury inquiries and his poundage fees were strongly criticized. Burke's act of 1782, which substantially reduced the annual total of secret service money, resulted in Todd receiving less than &pound;2000 for the secret office, compared with the previous &pound;7100. In addition the government now required a daily service with the continent for intelligence purposes. Out-port merchants also demanded faster posts. Motivated by a desire for increased revenue and greater efficiency William Pitt became interested in the plans of John Palmer (1742&#150;1818) to use coaches to secure faster inland posts. Todd, who favoured mail carts, resorted to a variety of spoiling tactics to prove Palmer's scheme impracticable, including attempts to impose unworkable timetables, publication of partial revenue statistics, and the running of mail carts in direct competition. The foreign secretary, the marquess of Carmarthen, also clashed with Todd over appointments and salaries within the secret office. In 1786 Pitt persuaded Todd to drop his opposition to Palmer's scheme, and in return Pitt supported Todd against Carmarthen and forced Lord Tankerville, one of the postmasters-general, to resign over a minor issue, in August 1786. Tankerville was unwilling to go quietly and his kinsman Charles Grey took up his case in the Commons in May 1787, by demanding an investigation into abuses in the Post Office. When Pitt agreed to refer this to the existing commission for inquiry into fees in the public offices Todd embarked on defensive action. In July 1787 he resigned as foreign secretary, in favour of his nephew John Maddison (1741&#150;1808), which effectively secured the latter's endowment for life. The commission's report, published at the end of May 1788, was unsparing in its criticism, and Todd was explicitly blamed for permitting the sailing packets to be wastefully run and his poundage was roundly denounced. It was clearly easier for his critics to recommend the abolition of sinecures, including the foreign secretaryship, and the replacement of fees and perquisites by salaries, than to grapple with the genuine administrative problems or to acknowledge Todd's previous valuable reforms.<br>
<br>In the late 1780s Todd, now over seventy, began to suffer ill health and thereafter made little effort to influence policy. When the new establishment of 1793 suppressed the controller-general's place Todd was once more left unrivalled in the office. He now enjoyed an annual salary of &pound;1000 and a further &pound;400 a year as compensation for perquisites; he was also allowed to retain his existing shares in the packets. Most of the work in the office was already being undertaken by Francis Freeling (1764&#150;1836), the resident surveyor, who was made joint secretary in 1797, when the octogenarian Todd was no longer able to attend. The board allowed him to remain at home in Walthamstow on full salary, an arrangement that was shortly afterwards condemned by a Commons' committee as unwarrantable and extravagant indulgence. The joint postmasters-general ignored these criticisms but ordered Todd to sell his share in the <i>Grantham</i> packet boat.<br>
<br>On 18 April 1798 Todd's growing infirmities convinced him that he should draw up his will, in which the bulk of his estimated &pound;80,000 fortune was bequeathed in trust for his daughter and grandchildren. He died at his house at Walthamstow on 8 June 1798. In the Post Office he continued to be remembered as &#145;a man of singular abilities and generally beloved&#146;  (Ackermann, 2.234). Freeling succeeded as secretary and remained in office until 1836.<br>
