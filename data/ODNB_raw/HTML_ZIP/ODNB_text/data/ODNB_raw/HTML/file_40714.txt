<span class="headword">Brodrick,  Cuthbert</span>  (1821&#150;1905), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 1 December 1821 at Summergangs, Hull, the sixth son of the ten children of John Brodrick, shipowner and merchant, and his wife, Hannah Foster. Both families had been employed for several generations in maritime activities on the Yorkshire coast. The young man grew up in Hull, then one of the chief ports in the United Kingdom. He was educated there, at first privately and then at Kingston College. On 4 January 1837 he was articled to Henry Francis Lockwood (1811&#150;1878), who had set up in practice in 1834 in the town, where his best work, such as Trinity House Chapel (1839&#150;43), was neo-classical in style and an obvious influence on the young Brodrick, who was quick to reveal his talents as a draughtsman. In this respect he probably benefited from the presence of Thomas Allom (1804&#150;1872), the noted topographical and architectural artist, who was a junior partner of Lockwood's for a short time <i>c</i>.1841&#150;1843. In 1839 Brodrick was awarded a silver medal for his measured drawings of the elaborate fourteenth-century Percy tomb in Beverley Minster, Yorkshire.<br>
<br>After completing his articles, Brodrick had a year's tour of buildings in England, France, and Italy; there is no record of a companion on his travels. After his return to Hull in 1845 he set up in practice there on his own account and secured a number of minor commissions; but in November 1852 he was appointed architect for the Hull Royal Institution, an impressive public building of which the main fa&ccedil;ade was a Corinthian colonnaded screen based on the late seventeenth-century east front of the Louvre, Paris. The institution was the starting point of his design for Leeds town hall, which he won in open competition in 1853. This extended the colonnaded screen treatment to the whole building, in which can be identified the influence of the bourse in Paris (built from the designs of J. T. Brongniart, 1739&#150;1813) and of Sir John Vanbrugh's &#145;heroic&#146; architecture. It is &#145;the most considerable public monument built just after the mid-century&#146;  (Hitchcock, <span class="italic">Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries</span>, 158), with its great domed tower that was an addition to the original design but quickly became a <i>sine qua non</i> for other municipal palaces. The town hall was a model for several other public buildings, for example the town halls at Bolton (1866&#150;73), Portsmouth (1886&#150;90), Morley, Yorkshire (1895), and Durban, Natal (1883&#150;5), and Parliament House, Melbourne, in Australia (1856).<br>
<br>In 1856 Brodrick was awarded a silver medal in the prestigious international competition for Lille Cathedral, and he had begun to enter contests for public buildings in London and the major towns. In 1857 he was placed fifth for his design for a new War Office in Whitehall, which <span class="italic">The Builder</span> noted as having strong points of resemblance to Leeds town hall, his first major building, which became an <i>id&eacute;e fixe</i> that haunted him. Its heavy columnar mass was there again in his designs submitted in 1866 in a limited competition for remodelling and enlarging the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square. The elliptical Leeds corn exchange (1860&#150;62), in some ways his finest work because of the unity of design and relationship between decoration, form, and function, owed its inspiration to the eighteenth-century Halle au Bl&eacute;, Paris, but its interpretation is Brodrick's. Other buildings he designed in Leeds are the mechanics' institute (1860&#150;66), warehouses in King Street (1862), and Headingley Hill Congregational Church (1864).<br>
<br>In Hull, his native town, Brodrick won the competition for a new town hall in 1861, but he was not successful in the competitions for Preston town hall (1853), Manchester assize courts (1859), Liverpool Royal Exchange (1863), the Natural History Museum, South Kensington (1864), Bolton town hall (1865), Hull Dock offices (1866), Manchester Royal Exchange (1866), the National Gallery (1866), and Manchester town hall (1866). Although the elemental form of Leeds town hall could sometimes be discerned in these designs, Brodrick used both Gothic and Second Empire eclectic styles as alternatives to the classical columnar. He even used a Moorish style for the Oriental Baths in Leeds (1864), and what <span class="italic">The Builder</span> called &#145;a mixture of Hindoo and Mohammedan&#146;  (29 Sept 1866, 724) for a vast custom house in Bombay, which was commissioned but not built.<br>
<br>It was in the Second Empire style that Brodrick designed his last major success, the Grand Hotel, Scarborough (1862&#150;7). Rising high above the town on its prominent site, this huge hotel with 300 bedrooms and impressive public rooms symbolized the wealthy West Riding on holiday, just as Leeds town hall is the apotheosis of local government and culture. The colourful brick and stone fa&ccedil;ades burst out at the top into mansarded pavilion roofs, domes, <i>&#339;il-de-b&#339;uf</i> windows, caryatids, and pediments, all reminiscent of the new Louvre, Paris, and creating what Henry-Russell Hitchcock called &#145;the climax of English Second Empire&#146;  (Hitchcock, <span class="italic">Early Victorian Architecture</span>, 1.213). Inside, its staircase is a modified version of that in the Paris Op&eacute;ra, and the decoration in the rooms was Parisian-inspired.<br>
<br>Brodrick remained in practice in Leeds (and in London, where he had opened an office in 1863) until about 1870, and he occasionally exhibited at the Royal Academy. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1860, and a member of its council in 1874, although by that time he was living in France. In England he had led a bachelor life in lodgings and clubs, but in 1876 he bought a house at Le V&eacute;sinet, Seine-et-Oise, a <i>ville-parc</i> laid out on picturesque English lines. On 7 May 1885 he made a late marriage to Margaret Chatham, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barber (<i>c</i>.1814&#150;1888), a widow. After her death at Le V&eacute;sinet he is believed to have moved away from the town, but nothing more is known of him until around 1899, when he rented a house, La Colline, Gorey, Jersey, where he died on 2 March 1905. He was buried in St Martin's churchyard, near Gorey.<br>
