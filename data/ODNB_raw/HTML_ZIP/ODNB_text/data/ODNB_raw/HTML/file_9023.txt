<span class="headword">Exeter <span class="st"> [Newetone]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1359), <span class="occ">physician and theologian</span>, probably came from Newton Abbot, Devon, but nothing is known of him before 28 July 1318, when he was provided to the rectory of Stoke in Teignhead, Devon, at the request of Walter Stapeldon, bishop of Exeter (<i>d</i>. 1326), except that he had already studied arts at Oxford. He was MA by 1319 and proceeded to study medicine, becoming doctor of medicine by 1327, and of theology by 1336. He was a fellow student of John Grandison (<i>d</i>. 1369), later bishop of Exeter and his patron, while in 1327 he was one of the delegates of the university at the confirmation of the election of a new chancellor by the bishop of Lincoln. His determination against the views of William Ockham and other friars on church property was probably an Oxford theological lecture given in or shortly before 1336. However his real practice seems to have been medicine; he was a king's clerk, perhaps in that capacity, in 1330, and physician to Queen Philippa, the foremost patron of the profession, in 1336, still in 1344, and probably as late as 1354. Through her patronage and that of Edward III he was amply rewarded: canon of Exeter in 1331, canon and then subdean of York (1336&#150;43); precentor, then chancellor of Lincoln (1337&#150;44) and prebendary of North Kelsey (1337&#150;59); and finally rector of Great Brington in Northamptonshire (1344&#150;<i>c</i>.1359). Perhaps Exeter's vacation of his most lucrative benefices in the mid-1340s, closely followed by his acceptance of a rectory with cure of souls, marked a decision to retire from medical practice into the country; if so, he was disappointed, since Queen Philippa insisted on his presence for at least another five years, and probably for longer. He was also one of Edward III's representatives in a mission to Philippe VI of France in January 1340, and had protection for going overseas on his service on 16 January 1354. Presumably his connection with Queen Philippa explains his bequest of books to her college at Oxford in 1359, the year of his death.<br>
<br>The only literary evidence of Exeter's medical practice occurs in a remedy for deafness attributed to him in the fifteenth-century <span class="italic">Liber de diversis medicinis</span>, which used Oxford sources. Bale saw his <span class="italic">Determinatio contra Ockham et alios fratres pro ecclesiae proprietate</span> and another of his works, <span class="italic">De generatione Christi</span> at Queen's College, presumably his own copies; the <span class="italic">Determinatio</span> is extant in a Paris manuscript.<br>
<br>William Exeter the physician is not to be confused with the <a name="cosubject_9023"></a><span class="headword">William  of Exeter</span>  (<em>fl. </em>before 1220) who was <span class="occ">author</span> of a treatise on the eight beatitudes in a Laudian manuscript at Oxford  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Laud misc. 368). This author, of whom nothing further is known, must have lived before <i>c</i>.1220, the date of the manuscript, and was possibly a monastic writer.<br>
