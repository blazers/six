<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Villiers,  John Henry  de</span>, first Baron de Villiers  (1842&#150;1914), <span class="occ">judge in South Africa</span>, was of Huguenot descent and was born at Paarl, Cape Colony, on 15 June 1842. He was the second son of Carel Christiaan de Villiers, government land surveyor, of Paarl, and his wife, Dorothea Elizabeth Retief, also of Paarl. Educated at the South African College, Cape Town (1853&#150;61), he went next to Utrecht, intending perhaps to prepare for a clerical career. He read widely in literature, philosophy, and history, and transferred in 1862 to Berlin University. But in June 1863, overcome by vocational doubts, he entered the Inner Temple, London, to train for the bar, qualifying in November 1865. Early in 1866 he began to practise at the Cape bar. In 1871 he married Aletta Johanna (<i>d</i>. 1922), daughter of Jan Pieter Jordaan, a wine farmer, of Worcester, Cape Colony. They had two sons and two daughters. From June 1867 he sat as a member of the house of assembly for Worcester, advocating, <i>inter alia</i>, the withdrawal of state aid from the churches, and the institution of responsible government in Cape Colony, hoping thereby to thwart eastern Cape separatism. In 1872 he became attorney-general in the ministry of John Charles Molteno, but, at the urgent request of the premier and of William Porter, he resigned in December 1873 to become chief justice. Though now a judge, he never lost touch with legislation and politics. He presided over several key commissions, notably the Cape federal commission (1873), the education commission (1880), and the diamond laws commission (1887) and was <i>ex officio</i> president of the legislative council.<br>
<br>De Villiers was deeply concerned with, and had a major impact on, wider southern African affairs. He worked for regional federation, trying to arrange this with President J. H. Brand of the Orange Free State in 1871. In 1877 they actually agreed upon a scheme, which would have been submitted to the high commissioner, Sir Bartle Frere, but for Sir Theophilus Shepstone's annexation of Transvaal. In 1881 he was a member of the royal commission which drew up the Pretoria convention. He had already been knighted in 1877, and he was now created KCMG (1882).<br>
<br>In 1888 and 1895 de Villiers was invited to stand for the Orange Free State presidency and, in 1893, at the instance of Cecil Rhodes, he agreed to take office as prime minister of Cape Colony; but Rhodes suddenly re-formed his cabinet without him. De Villiers offered his services again in 1896 and 1902, but on both occasions the premiership was offered to J. G. Sprigg, who accepted. In 1894 de Villiers went to the Ottawa colonial conference to further Rhodes's schemes of intercolonial preference and communications. Personally he was on good terms with Rhodes, and with the high commissioners Sir Hercules Robinson and Sir Henry Loch, but, like Loch, he feared the use to which Rhodes might put his wide and indefinite powers, and he began to turn against him early in 1894. After the Jameson raid (January 1896), de Villiers successfully urged President Kruger to show mercy to his prisoners; and early in 1897 he unsuccessfully mediated between Kruger and his chief justice, J. G. Kotze, over the power claimed by some of the judges to test the validity of laws by the touchstone of the <i>grondwet</i> (constitution). For some time de Villiers had tried to form a South African court of appeal as a step towards federation, and in 1886 had urged the inclusion of colonial judges in the privy council. He was himself sworn in, as the first colonial judge to take his seat on the judicial committee, in July 1897, though he was unable to attend regularly.<br>
<br>During 1899, in spite of failing health, de Villiers worked hard for peace. He lay dangerously ill for many weeks in England and on the Riviera in 1901, during the South African War, but he recovered and helped to block the proposed suspension of the Cape constitution in 1902. By 1906 he was again promoting federation, and from 1907 kept in close touch with J. X. Merriman, the Cape premier, and General Smuts. A visit to Canada as representative of the four South African colonies at the Canadian tercentenary now persuaded him that union was better than federation. On his return, he was unanimously elected president of the national convention, and as such he personally conducted the negotiations with the imperial government on the future of the protectorates. In the convention itself he presided over the plenary sessions and most of the committees, thanks to the confidence he inspired, sometimes securing the adoption of motions which, put forward by anyone else, would have been rejected. He also headed the drafting committee which finalized the <span class="roman">Union of South Africa Bill</span>, prior to its passage through the British parliament. For this he was created baron, with the title de Villiers of Wynberg. He returned home to become first chief justice of the union (1910). In 1912, and again in July 1914, he was acting governor-general. He died quickly, of pneumonia, at Pretoria, on 2 September 1914 and was buried at Woltemade cemetery, Maitland, on 7 September. He was succeeded as second baron by his elder son, Charles Percy (<i>b</i>. 1871).<br>
<br>De Villiers was relatively tall, lean, and active, a man of immense dignity relieved by a kindly spirit and dry humour. He &#145;had a square face, blunt features, firm jaw, long thin nose, close-shut mouth, deep-sunk eyes, while from his cheeks hung thin Dundreary weepers which later spread under his chin like a white crescent moon&#146;  (<span class="italic">DSAB</span>). He enjoyed hunting and fishing, loved dogs, kept bees, and his enthusiasm for fruit farming embraced viticulture, and citrus and deciduous fruit. His chief claim to fame, however, is as a judge. Other South African judges may have been more learned in the letter of the law, but none understood its spirit so well. It was sometimes said that at times he dispensed &#145;de Villiers's law&#146; (and some of his judgments were reversed on one or two points after his death), but despite his speed in reaching decisions, his judgments were only questioned by the privy council four times. Over the course of forty-one years he dispensed justice fearlessly, without respect of persons, on a great variety of subjects, notably those which&#151;like his decisions in <i>In re Kok and Balie</i> (1879) and <i>Sigcawu's case</i> (1895)&#151;went right to the core of individual liberty. He outshone the Cape, and outlived judges of his own generation.<br>
<br>De Villiers's desire to see the consolidation of Southern African judiciaries into a single system grew <i>pari passu</i> with the political unification of the subcontinent, drawing the coastal and inland states closer together. Besides the supreme court in Cape Town, there were by 1882 five similar courts in South Africa under four separate legislatures, unchecked by a common court of appeal. Their law and practice were fundamentally the same, but divergences necessarily occurred. These divergences were checked by the fact that the Cape supplied many of the judges to the other courts, and by the growing prestige of de Villiers. Even so the law of the colony was in a state of confusion. The criminal law had become practically English. But the Roman-Dutch civil law was being Anglicized in a haphazard manner, partly owing to the influence of de Villiers himself. He has been criticized for consulting too narrow a range of authorities and applying English precedents sometimes with inconsiderate haste, as in the matter of water rights  (<span class="italic">DSAB</span>). The marriage of English and Roman-Dutch law, however, which had begun to take place from the early years of British rule, was achieved piecemeal in the longer term, and perhaps owes more to de Villiers than to any other single man. It later spread from the borders of the South Africa of 1873 northward to the Zambezi.<br>
