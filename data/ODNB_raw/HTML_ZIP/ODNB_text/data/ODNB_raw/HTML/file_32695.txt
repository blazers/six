<span class="headword">Daley, Sir  (William) Allen</span>  (1887&#150;1969), <span class="occ">medical officer of health</span>, was born at Bootle, Lancashire, on 19 February 1887, the elder son of William Daley (<i>d</i>. 1911), medical officer of health of Bootle, and his wife, Mary Allen. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, Crosby, and at the University of Liverpool. He graduated BSc (London) in chemistry in 1906, then MB, ChB (Liverpool), in 1909, with first-class honours, and MB, BS (London), in 1910, with distinction in medicine. He obtained the Cambridge diploma in public health in 1911 with distinction, and his London MD degree in 1912. After holding resident posts in Liverpool he became resident medical officer at the London Fever Hospital in 1911. In May that year his father was drowned at the age of forty-seven in a yachting accident and Daley was recalled to Bootle to succeed him as medical officer of health at the early age of twenty-four.<br>
<br>For the next forty-one years Daley held posts of increasing responsibility and importance in the field of preventive medicine. The early work at Bootle showed energy and promise leading to similar appointments successively in Blackburn (1920&#150;25) and Hull (1925&#150;9). Daley was appointed in 1928 to serve on a departmental committee of the Ministry of Health on the recruitment and training of midwives and his work there was noticed by the medical officer of health of the London county council, Frederick Menzies. In 1929 Daley was appointed a principal medical officer of the London county council and in 1938 he became deputy to Menzies. In the nine years before the outbreak of war in 1939 the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board and the metropolitan boards of guardians were being integrated into a single service by the London county council. Menzies had chosen well: Daley's apparently unlimited energy and industry had found an appropriate task. Within a short time he had a complete grasp of the complexities of the service down to the smallest detail. He recorded and reported on all his activities and copies were distributed widely so that staff were made aware of progress or delay in all projects. It was commonplace to hear from staff that at no other time or place in their careers were they so well informed about their work. Daley chaired many departmental committees dealing with such diverse subjects as pathological services, hospital standards and staffing, the district medical service, the ambulance service, and the tuberculosis scheme. He was demonstrably a master of the committee method: well informed, affable, and urbane.<br>
<br>In 1939 Daley succeeded Menzies as county medical officer; in the same year he was elected FRCP. During the Second World War he had the difficult task of guiding the hospital service during a time when it acquired a reputation of never refusing a casualty a bed, though many buildings were badly damaged. His work was recognized by a knighthood in 1944 and, in 1947, by an honorary physicianship to George VI. Daley took a special pride in his election to the council of the Royal College of Physicians while a practising medical officer of health, a rare honour. In 1943 he published with Reginald Coleman a paper entitled &#145;The development of the hospital services with particular reference to the municipal hospital system of London&#146;, in <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine</span>  (35, 1941&#150;2, 45&#150;56).<br>
<br>The <span class="roman">National Health Service Act</span> of 1946 led to a further period of great activity during which the London county council hospitals were transferred to the newly formed regional hospital boards, and simultaneously steps were taken to absorb the personal health services previously in the care of the metropolitan boroughs which made up the county council area. This was accomplished with Daley's accustomed skill in 1948, even though he regretted the loss of the responsibility of local authorities for hospitals, and four years later he reached the official retiring age. This had no perceptible effect on his activities; he transferred his personal files to his home and continued to serve on the many committees to which he had been appointed in a personal capacity.<br>
<br>Daley was president of the Central Council for Health Education, having been a founder member and the author of a paper in the 1920s which played a considerable part in the thinking which led to the formation of the council. In 1927 he published <span class="italic">Population Education in Public Health</span> (with Hester Viney) and an interview with him on the topic of health education was published in the <span class="italic">Health Education Journal</span> (1, 1943, 19&#150;23). He was chairman of the Chadwick trustees and president of the National Association for Maternal and Child Welfare. These were appointments which he continued to the end of his life, but in addition he held appointments on boards of governors of hospitals and other bodies concerned with health. Age limits removed him from many of these, but to the end he retained the vice-chairmanship of the academic board of the Royal Postgraduate Hospital at Hammersmith in west London.<br>
<br>At the time of his retirement from his official post, Daley had written or spoken on 250 occasions, varying from addresses for learned societies to speeches at prizegivings. Some fifteen years later this had been increased to more than 450. He delivered the Croonian lectures to the Royal College of Physicians, the De Lamar lecture at Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, Baltimore, and a report to the World Health Organization and Rockefeller Foundation on health and social workers in England and France. After his retirement he visited Australia on behalf of the Nuffield Foundation, lecturing on the British National Health Service, and he lectured also in North America, where for several months he was associate health officer of the city of Baltimore.<br>
<br>In 1913 Daley married Mary 
    (Marie; <i>d</i>. 1962)
  , daughter of Edward Toomey, of Liverpool; they had a daughter who became a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist in London and a son who became a consultant physician also in the capital at St Thomas's Hospital. Although in the last five years of Daley's life physical afflictions slowed him down, there was no lack of mental power and he continued by correspondence and conversation to be one of the best-informed, as well as one of the best-known, figures in public health circles. He died on 21 February 1969 at Tenerife during a winter holiday.<br>
