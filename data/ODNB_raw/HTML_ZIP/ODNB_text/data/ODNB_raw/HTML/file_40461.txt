<span class="headword">Grein,  Jacob Thomas <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>  (1862&#150;1935), <span class="occ">drama critic and impresario</span>, was born on 11 October 1862 in Amsterdam, the elder son of Jacob Herman Grein (<i>fl</i>. 1840&#150;1888), merchant, and his wife, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1920), daughter of Dr Thomas Davids of Amsterdam and his wife, Louisa.<br>
<br>Educated in Dutch and German schools, and a Bremen commercial college, Grein then worked in business for two uncles. By 1882 he was drama critic for Amsterdam's leading newspaper, <span class="italic">Algemeen Handelsblad</span>. When Grein moved to London in 1885 he remained in commerce but continued writing for continental journals. Subsequently he was drama critic for <span class="italic">Life</span> (1888&#150;91), the <span class="italic">Sunday Special</span> (1897&#150;1918), and <span class="italic">Ladies Field</span> (1911&#150;14). His final assignment was with the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> (1920&#150;35), where he wrote alongside his wife, Alice Augusta Greeven 
    (pseudonym Michael Orme; 1874&#150;1944)
  , whom he had married on 14 July 1904. His assessments of some of the 12,000 plays he claimed to have witnessed were published in <span class="italic">Dramatic Criticism</span> (5 vols., 1898&#150;1903).<br>
<br>Grein's major achievement was establishing the Independent Theatre in London in 1891. Modelled after Andr&eacute; Antoine's Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Libre, Grein adopted many of Antoine's principles but eschewed what he termed the immorality and slovenliness of Antoine's work. Grein endeavoured to stage plays of high literary and artistic value rejected by the commercial theatre or suppressed by the censor (whom the Independent Theatre circumvented by being a subscription society). Its first production was Ibsen's <span class="italic">Ghosts</span> (1891), regarded as cutting-edge drama and already censored. More than 3000 people applied for tickets, and the production became a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>: Ibsen was vilified by traditionalist critic Clement Scott, but defended by William Archer. The subsequent repertoire proved less radical and sensational although it included the 1892 production of <span class="italic">Widower's Houses</span>, the first of Shaw's plays to be performed. Since there were only 175 regular subscribers Grein subsidized the organization until it became a limited company in 1895 (the year of his naturalization). The Independent Theatre ceased operations in 1897. Grein was involved with similar ventures, such as the Stage Society (1899 onwards), the London German Theatre (1901&#150;7), the French Players (1917), and the People's Theatre (1923). He began the People's National Theatre (1930) with actress Nancy Price, but her domineering personality and Grein's ill health forced him to withdraw within a year. He died of a heart attack at his London home, 4 Cambridge Place, Victoria Road, on 22 June 1935.<br>
<br>Rather short and stocky, with a round, moustached face, Grein was genial and incurably enthusiastic. As a critic he was cosmopolitan but undiscriminating; he lacked the trenchant, scintillating style of Bernard Shaw or Max Beerbohm. However, Grein's dedicated organizational abilities nurtured serious drama and he planted the seeds of the alternative theatre movement, an achievement recognized by numerous honours.<br>
