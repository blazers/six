<span class="headword">Westcote,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1567, <em>d.</em> 1637?), <span class="occ">topographer</span>, was born at West Raddon, Shobrooke, Devon, and baptized on 17 June 1567 at Shobrooke, the third son of Philip Westcote (<i>d</i>. 1600), gentleman, of West Raddon, and his wife, Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1614), daughter of George Waltham of Brenton, Exminster, Devon. He fought in Drake's Portuguese expedition of 1589 together with his older brother George who was killed in the assault on Lisbon. After further travels he settled in London, probably at Lincoln's Inn, of which his relative Richard Waltham was a member, although there is no record of his having been admitted there. He retired to Devon and about 1606 married Mary, the daughter of Richard Roberts of Combe Martin, where his son and heir Philip (1607&#150;1647) and the first of his four daughters were born. He may also have lived at West Raddon with his older brother Robert (1560&#150;1637) and in 1627 he held a lease of Thorn Park in the neighbouring parish of Holcombe Burnell.<br>
<br>At the insistence of Edward Bourchier, earl of Bath, Westcote undertook a survey of Devon in the same manner as Richard Carew (1555&#150;1620) had published for Cornwall. The resulting &#145;View of Devonshire&#146;, completed about 1630, is greatly indebted to the manuscript survey of John Hooker (<i>c</i>.1525&#150;1601) and he was also acquainted with the topographers Tristram Risdon (<i>c</i>.1580&#150;1640) and Sir William Pole (1561&#150;1635). Westcote's survey is arranged by river systems and his style is more literary than that of other contemporary topographers, but he had little sense of history and he has been criticized for his ready acceptance of fanciful ideas. His other compilation &#145;An account of the pedigrees and matches of most of the antient and eminent gentry of this county, with their coats of arms&#146; traces the descent of some 300 families, not always accurately. A copy of this work was annotated by the historian John Prince (1643&#150;1723) who often compounded his errors. Both works circulated in manuscript until published in 1845, when the editors George Oliver and Pitman Jones corrected many of the errors and extended some of the pedigrees. Westcote probably died at either Holcombe Burnell or West Raddon in 1637, in which year a will proved in the archdeaconry court of Exeter, whose records have since been destroyed, is listed for Thomas Westcott of Holcombe Burnell. By this time he would have been seventy; his wife died in 1666.<br>
