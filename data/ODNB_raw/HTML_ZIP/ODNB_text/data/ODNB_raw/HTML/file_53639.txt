<span class="headword">Aspinall,  Arthur</span>  (1901&#150;1972), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born at Co-operative Terrace, Stainland, near Halifax in the West Riding of Yorkshire, on 11 July 1901. His mother was Sarah Hannah Aspinall, a cotton reeler. His father's name was not recorded on his birth certificate but on his marriage certificate in 1931 it was given as Oliver Aspinall, deceased, described as a &#145;woollen operative&#146;. He was educated at Elland secondary school, Halifax, from where he made his way to the Victoria University of Manchester, matriculating in October 1919. At that time his mother resided at Holywell Green, Stainland, near Halifax. His first intention was to read science. However, those were the great days of the rising Manchester school of history under such figures as H. W. C. Davis, T. F. Tout, and F. M. Powicke; Aspinall immediately fell under that spell, seeing in history, as he did throughout his life, a subject that was both a scientific discipline, a field for investigative research demanding strict accuracy and based on evidence that could be verified, and also a human study of the quirks and foibles of men's characters.<br>
<br>Aspinall's characteristic industry was already in evidence when he completed his doctorate, under Davis, in less than two of the statutory three years, having chosen as his subject the political career of Henry Brougham, another northerner despite coming from the &#145;wrong&#146; side of the Pennines. This study became Aspinall's first book, <span class="italic">Lord Brougham and the Whig Party</span> (1927), described by the compilers of the standard bibliography of British history as &#145;thorough and masterly in treatment&#146;  (Brown and Christie, 37) and still an authority on its subject. The solid foundation of scholarship which underlay his career was already in evidence.<br>
<br>Aspinall was clearly a candidate for a university post, but they were scarce in the 1920s when universities were far fewer and much smaller than they became in the late twentieth century, and he was fortunate to secure a lectureship in Burma at the University of Rangoon from 1925 to 1931. While there, though isolated from standard historical sources for much of the time, he wrote a monograph, <span class="italic">Cornwallis in Bengal</span>. He afterwards told, with evident relish, stories of his experiences as examiner of degree candidates who not infrequently hoped (vainly) to smooth their passage by interleaving their scripts with rupee notes.<br>
<br>Aspinall returned to England in 1931 and shortly afterwards, on 3 September at the Wesleyan Methodist chapel on South Drive, St Anne's-on-Sea, Lancashire, married Gladys, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Shaw (<i>d</i>. 1965), two years his junior, the daughter of a company director from St Anne's-on-Sea. The witnesses who signed the marriage certificate were the bride's parents, so his mother may have been deceased by then. There were two children of the marriage, a daughter followed by a son.<br>
<br>Aspinall's opportunity to pursue serious scholarship arrived in 1931 when the University of Reading advertised a lectureship in modern history and he was appointed, to work under the revered figure F. M. Stenton, the founder of the history school there and one of the greatest British historians. Aspinall was later (1947) to succeed Stenton in the chair, a destiny of which he was always proud, and like his predecessor he was to spend the remainder of his career there, even refusing offers of chairs elsewhere&#151;including Manchester&#151;to stay at what was then a minor though respectable English university. One of its chief virtues, in Aspinall's eyes, was its proximity to both London and Oxford, especially its excellent railway service to the capital, which enabled him to spend whole days in the British Museum or the Public Record Office after fulfilling his lecturing duties at 9 a.m. at Reading&#151;a requirement which the history department timetable had to accommodate. He was naturally a researcher rather than a teacher, and though his lectures were comprehensive and detailed, they were read rather than delivered, without much recourse to digression or impromptu humour. He had little use for university administration (or administrators, it must be said) and claimed that he avoided serving on committees by posing as stupid. Nor did he favour the tutorial method, which was not introduced into his department until shortly before his retirement, for he believed that his colleagues were better occupied in research than in any other activity. He set the example, visiting archives and country houses throughout the land to build up an unrivalled knowledge of sources for his period. Even family seaside holidays might be planned with an eye to proximity to a newly discovered cache of correspondence. During the Second World War he rescued more than one valuable family collection from disposal for salvage and ensured their preservation in record offices.<br>
<br>Aspinall devoted his academic life to the publication of impeccably edited texts of the major documentary sources of his chosen period, English history in the reigns of George III and George IV, and especially the letters of those two monarchs. His editorial skills and his detailed knowledge of the period, as well as his intimate acquaintance with almost all the manuscript as well as the printed sources available, ensured work of lasting value: he once declared to the present author that the only enduring fame a historian could expect, or desire, came from the editing of materials in so comprehensive and accurate a manner that they would never need to be done again. Everything else would be superseded, generation after generation. In this truth lies the key to Aspinall as a scholar.<br>
<br>Aspinall made his reputation in 1938 with his edition of <span class="italic">The Letters of King George IV, 1812&#150;30</span>, which was immediately recognized as a lasting achievement. He gained admission to the Royal Archives at Windsor through the good offices of Sir Charles Webster, who had met him while he was at Rangoon and was impressed by his book on Brougham and by a paper which Aspinall had recently read at the Royal Historical Society. On these grounds Webster recommended him to the then registrar of the archives, Miss Mackenzie, and to the royal librarian, Sir Owen Morshead. It was envisaged that Webster and Aspinall should be joint editors, but Aspinall pleaded to be allowed to undertake the sole editorship on the ground that &#145;such a position would contribute so much to his credit and assist his career&#146;. Webster drily remarked that &#145;I do not think he would have lost much in reputation by acting with me on equal terms&#146;  (Webster to Morshead, 24 Nov 1934; Royal Archives), but he agreed on condition that he wrote the preface and was credited with it on the title-page, and acted as consultant. Aspinall was already showing that he was an ambitious man, with plenty of confidence in his own ability.<br>
<br>Aspinall's work in the Royal Archives continued to the end of his career; the sight of his majestic Daimler (with pre-selector gearbox to avoid the difficult technique of manual gear-changing) moving up the hill past St George's Chapel (and occasionally scattering tourists as it charged back down) became a familiar one to members of the royal household, and so much did he become almost a member of that body that he was sometimes allowed to remove numbers of boxes of letters to be copied and worked on at home or in the department at Reading&#151;a story that horrifies the present staff of the archives.<br>
<br>Aspinall followed the <span class="italic">Letters of King George IV</span> with <span class="italic">The Later Correspondence of George III</span> (covering the years 1783&#150;1810), published in five volumes (1962&#150;70), and the companion <span class="italic">Correspondence of George, Prince of Wales, 1770&#150;1810</span>, which filled the gap in the series with eight volumes in 1963&#150;71, completed after retirement. Towards the end of his life he contemplated re-editing the earlier correspondence of George III, Sir John Fortescue's edition having been severely criticized for inaccuracy, but failing eyesight compelled him to relinquish the project. He also published the correspondence of Princess Charlotte and of Mrs Jordan, mistress of William IV as duke of Clarence. His editing of the latter was criticized by her modern biographer, who asserts that he made several unacknowledged omissions and mistook some dates, but mainly on the grounds that he found her an unsympathetic character and did not do justice to her good qualities  (C. Tomalin, <span class="italic">Mrs Jordan's Profession</span>, 1994, xix&#150;xx). He also edited the letters of Charles Arbuthnot, a Treasury politician of the time, and the <span class="italic">Diary of Henry Hobhouse, 1820&#150;47</span>. A comparatively rare venture into secondary interpretation was <span class="italic">Politics and the Press, 1780&#150;1850</span>, which was characteristically founded on the scrutiny of government tax records as well as of newspapers and journalists. Its detailed coverage reflected its author's preoccupation with contemporary evidence rather than with impressionistic opinions but it contains a wealth of not otherwise easily accessible information. Aspinall was invited to give the British Academy Raleigh lecture in 1952 and chose to explore the difficult subject of the history of the cabinet in his period; as always, his diligence and enthusiasm far outran the available space for publication. His monograph <span class="italic">The Cabinet Council, 1783&#150;1835</span>, is a much enlarged version of the lecture and still the best authority on its subject. He was also invited to edit a volume in the series <span class="roman">English Historical Documents</span>, in this case the volume for 1783 to 1832, for which he enlisted the help of a (then) young colleague at Reading, the present author. Characteristically, he was only really interested in the political sections of the book, especially on the central government and, in view of his current work on the cabinet, on that institution: those sections grew to form a perhaps disproportionate part of the whole, and included many short extracts from contemporary correspondence and diaries which were not conventionally considered as standard documents, but he boasted that it was the only really useful research tool in the modern part at any rate of the series. He published many other minor works (in length) as articles in learned journals, all rigorously based on hard evidence and all revealing important aspects of their subjects. In his last years at Reading he undertook, under Sir Lewis Namier's general editorship, the conduct of the volume in the magisterial <span class="italic">History of Parliament</span> for the period 1790&#150;1820; although he had to relinquish this task on retirement in 1965, he laid a foundation of archival research for others to build on. His lasting contribution to English history and in particular to the history of the royal family was recognized on his retirement when he was made CVO, of which he was especially proud.<br>
<br>Aspinall hastened his retirement by a year in 1965 when his first wife died suddenly of a stroke while they were preparing to move into a bungalow on the Isle of Man for their retirement. Despite this tragedy, he went to live alone on the island, admitting that its low rate of income tax was a greater attraction than the scenery, and in 1968 he married Beryl Johnson, whom he had known at Reading. Failing eyesight marred his last years but he retired a wealthy man, having devoted himself since his early years at Reading to playing the stock market in the evenings with flair, meticulous research, and detailed knowledge; he was not above picking up tips from the owners of stately homes he visited in search of manuscripts, and he invested riskily but shrewdly in London properties during the Second World War. He died at his home, Highlands Belle Vue, Maughold, Ramsay, Isle of Man, on 2 May 1972.<br>
<br>Aspinall was a devoted son of his native county and he possessed many of its typical qualities. He was careful with his money and had a full endowment of common sense and what he used to call &#145;Yorkshire grit and determination&#146;, to which his achievement in rising to eminence in his profession from such a humble and disadvantaged though respectable background paid tribute. He was a big man, and could appear formidable to colleagues and students, but he was a kind man and loved a good story, the more <i>risqu&eacute;</i> the better, which would trigger a loud and characteristic laugh of appreciation. He was devoted to his family.<br>
