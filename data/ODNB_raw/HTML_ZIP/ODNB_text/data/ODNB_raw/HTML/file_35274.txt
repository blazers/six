<span class="headword">Oakley, Sir  John Hubert</span>  (1867&#150;1946), <span class="occ">surveyor</span>, was born at 65 Gloucester Place, Kensington, London, on 11 October 1867, the eldest son of Christopher Percival Oakley, surveyor, of Chislehurst, and his wife, Kate, daughter of Charles Kingsford, of Lewisham Hill, Kent. He was a nephew of John Oakley, dean of Manchester, and the grandson of John Oakley, surveyor, a founder in 1868 of the Surveyors' Institution, later the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Educated at Uppingham School, Oakley entered the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester, in 1885, where he excelled as a student and athlete. A tall man of powerful physique, at rugby football he was captain of the college fifteen, capped for Gloucestershire, and tried for England.<br>
<br>Having passed out of Cirencester with honours at Christmas 1887, Oakley joined the family firm of Daniel Smith, Son and Oakley (later Daniel Smith, Oakley and Garrard), surveyors, land agents, and auctioneers, of London, which had been founded in 1780. He remained with them all his life, first as an articled pupil, from 1892 as partner, and from 1898 senior partner. Oakley married on 11 November 1891 at St James's Church, Croydon, Ida (<i>b</i>. 1869/70), only daughter of Daniel Watney, surveyor, of Brittleware, Croydon; they had one daughter, Margery Ruth.<br>
<br>A modest and kindly man, Oakley was held in respect and affection throughout his profession. His experience, founded upon an early training in agriculture, ranged over the whole field, urban and rural, of successful general practice. His reputation as a surveyor and valuer of real property was considerable; and his professional knowledge was reinforced with good judgement. His services as an arbitrator were in frequent demand; he once had to make what amounted to a valuation of the whole city of Hong Kong in order to resolve differences between two government departments. On another occasion he was appointed by the London county council and the landowners concerned to assess the betterment rate, then one of the first of its kind, to be levied upon lands benefited by, but surplus to, the Kingsway improvement scheme between Aldwych and Holborn. He followed his father as land agent for the St Germans estates at Blackheath and was responsible for their development.<br>
<br>Oakley served on the council of the Surveyors' Institution for twelve years and remained a member until his death. Like his father and father-in-law before him, and his brother-in-law after him, he became president of the institution, holding office in 1918. In the institution's <span class="italic">Transactions</span> for 1918&#150;19 he reviewed its history and work (vol. 51, no. 642, 1&#150;38) as it celebrated its golden jubilee. In 1925 he was elected president of the College of Estate Management, founded in 1919 as a centre of education for surveying and allied professions.<br>
<br>Oakley was a member of the royal commission on the universities of Oxford and Cambridge (1919&#150;21); the committee on crown and government lands (1921&#150;2); the royal commission on compensation for suffering and damage caused by enemy action (1922&#150;4); the River Ouse drainage commission (1925&#150;6); the Irish grants committee (1926&#150;30); and the advisory committee on crown lands (1933&#150;9). He was knighted in 1919 and appointed GBE in 1928. A member of the Conservative Club, he gave his interests as fishing and shooting.<br>
<br>Oakley died on 5 December 1946 at Welbeck Palace Hotel, Welbeck Street, London. His widow survived him.<br>
