<span class="headword">Aspland,  Robert</span>  (1782&#150;1845), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister and journal editor</span>, was born on 23 January 1782 at Wicken, Cambridgeshire, the only surviving child of Robert Aspland, the village shopkeeper, and his second wife, Hannah Brook of nearby Isleham; Isaac, a half-brother from the earlier marriage, lived from 1774 to 1829. The elder Aspland had turned from Anglicanism to dissent and, under his wife's influence, became a Particular Baptist, later turning to Unitarianism. The son was educated largely by Anglicans, however: for four years, indifferently and unhappily, by a relative, the Revd John Aspland, at the grammar school in Soham and then, in improving succession between 1794 and 1797, with a Mr Gillyat at Islington, the Revd Edward Porter (an Independent) at Highgate, and the Revd John Eyre at Hackney.<br>
<br>Hoping to enter the Baptist college in Bristol, Aspland reluctantly underwent the stipulated baptism at Devonshire Square Chapel in the City of London in April 1797. Fearing from a long silence that Bristol had rejected him, he learned towards the end of the year that he had been awarded a scholarship under the bequest of John Ward (1679?&#150;1758), Gresham professor of rhetoric, which provided for two years of schooling in England, four years at a Scottish university, and a year's maintenance following graduation.<br>
<br>After studying with the Revd Joseph Hughes (1769&#150;1833) in Battersea, Aspland returned briefly to Wicken, where he found some fame as a boy preacher, and entered Bristol College, then headed by Dr John Ryland (1753&#150;1825), on 31 July 1798. In October 1799 he enrolled in Marischal College, Aberdeen, but by the end of the following year his growing heterodoxy, long suspected by others, led to expulsion from Devonshire Square and to the decision to resign his scholarship, closing off, he thought, further education and a ministerial career.<br>
<br>Through a sickly schoolboy he had befriended while serving as an assistant at the school attached to Devonshire Square Chapel, Aspland had come to know the family of John Middleton, a well-to-do manufacturer of artists' colours in London; he had developed a close attachment to Sara Middleton (1770/71&#150;1858) and now her father offered Aspland a place in the firm. Handicapped by colour-blindness and finding business an insuperable barrier to his literary interests, he was recommended by the Revd John Evans (1767&#150;1827), pastor of the General Baptist chapel in Worship Street, London, to the small, lively General Baptist congregation at Newport, Isle of Wight, where he was invited to settle as soon as his probationary preaching was completed on 3 May 1801; he was ordained on 21 July. His marriage to Sara Middleton took place in the same year. One child died in infancy; two daughters and three sons survived, the eldest being the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/806/', "Revd Robert Brook Aspland (1805&#150;1869)")</script>.<br>
<br>Encouraged by the openness of his congregation, Aspland moved from Arian belief in the subordinate divinity of Christ to Unitarianism, which asserted Christ's humanity. Through Thomas Belsham (1750&#150;1829), the prominent London Unitarian minister whom he had encountered at a meeting of the Southern Unitarian Society, of which Aspland was a founding member, he was offered and accepted an invitation to Norton, Derbyshire, where the congregation was dominated for many decades by two Samuel Shores, father (1707&#150;1785) and son (1738&#150;1828), descended from an old nonconformist gentry family. On his way north early in 1805 Aspland was invited to preach at the Gravel Pit Chapel, Hackney, by Belsham, who was about to move to the premier London congregation in Essex Street and who recommended Aspland as his successor. Released by the Shores after a few months at Norton, Aspland took up the Hackney appointment. Despite some initial dissatisfaction, a not uncommon consequence of ministerial changes, he preached there for some forty years to an imposing congregation, in a new chapel from 1809.<br>
<br>Aspland founded two major Unitarian periodicals. He took over the failing <span class="italic">Universal Theological Magazine</span> from William Vidler (1758&#150;1816) at the end of 1805, and on that basis established the <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, which first appeared in February 1806. Over the next two decades it was distinguished by radical nonconformist politics, extensive controversy on theology and biblical criticism, and broad coverage of Unitarian affairs. Austerely uncompromising and long unprofitable&#151;subscribers hovered around a thousand&#151;the <span class="italic">Repository</span> drew contributors from the Unitarian intelligentsia, both ministerial and lay, among them Mrs Barbauld, Thomas Belsham, John Bowring, Harriet Martineau, Henry Crabb Robinson, and Thomas Noon Talfourd.<br>
<br>In 1826 Aspland transferred the magazine to the new British and Foreign Unitarian Association and a brief, unsuccessful editorship by committee. The second series, begun in June 1827, was edited from August 1828 by W. J. Fox (1786&#150;1864), who transformed the <span class="italic">Repository</span> into a national literary periodical. Unitarian concerns then fell to the <span class="italic">Christian Reformer</span>, which Aspland had founded in 1815, initially for a wider, less sophisticated audience than the <span class="italic">Repository</span>'s, and which he edited until 1845, when his son succeeded him.<br>
<br>Aspland was an organizer and secretary of genius. In the same year that he founded the <span class="italic">Repository</span>, he established the Unitarian Fund to encourage missionary activities; the Christian Tract Society followed three years later and the Association for the Protection of the Civil Rights of Unitarians in 1819. In 1825 he took the lead in merging two of those organizations&#151;the Christian Tract Society held aloof&#151;with Belsham's earlier Unitarian Society for distributing books, thus forming the British and Foreign Unitarian Association, which for more than a century was the central organization of the denomination; Aspland was, of course, its secretary until 1841. In 1812 he established an academy at Durham House, Hackney, to train men as popular Unitarian preachers, but, owing to chronic financial problems and a temporary bout of ill health, he was forced to abandon it in 1818.<br>
<br>Aspland inherited his family's radical whig politics, which, united with a fervent commitment to dissent, put him in the forefront of every agitation for the protection and extension of religious liberty. He actively supported Catholic emancipation, and opposed Lord Sidmouth's attempt in 1811 to circumscribe the registration of dissenting ministers. In 1817 he founded the Non-Con Club to advance religious freedom, and published many of its papers in the <span class="italic">Repository</span>. He helped to prepare William Hone's defence against prosecutions for his satirical publications in 1817 and Richard Carlile's for republishing Thomas Paine's <span class="italic">Age of Reason</span> two years later. As well as drafting a petition to parliament, presented by Joseph Hume in 1823, against the prosecution of unbelievers, Aspland launched the <span class="italic">Test Act Reporter</span> in 1827 to trace the efforts at repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span>, attained in 1828, and was active in the campaign in the mid-1830s to alter the law relating to dissenters' marriages. He was a steady advocate of reform of the law and of parliament.<br>
<br>Theologically, Aspland followed Joseph Priestley (1733&#150;1804) and Thomas Belsham, insisting on the ultimate triumph of truth and on the indispensability of both reason and revelation to religion. Abandoning adult baptism, the central tenet of his old faith, he avoided the alternative of infant baptism by a service of dedication. Like other converts from the Particular Baptists, he zealously advocated the doctrine of universal restitution, the belief that all ultimately will be saved&#151;a dramatic rejection of Calvinist predestination. A list of his many publications appears in the memoir by his son.<br>
<br>Aspland suffered intermittently from poor health, but in 1843 there was no recovery. He preached his last sermon at the Gravel Pit on 4 February 1844. He died of heart disease in Hackney on 30 December 1845, and was buried on 6 January 1846 in the Gravel Pit burial-ground.<br>
