<span class="headword">Davy <span class="st"> [Davys]</span>,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1521?), <span class="occ">church musician</span>, is of unknown origins, but rose to be one of the leading composers of his generation. All that is certain about his career is that he was instructor of the choristers at Magdalen College, Oxford, from Michaelmas 1490 until Christmas 1491; he could have held the post as early as Michaelmas 1488 and as late as Christmas 1493. It is probable, however, that he stayed no longer than the many other instructors employed by the college during the 1480s and 1490s; the position was poorly paid, and its occupants tended to move to more lucrative employment. A Richard Davy entered the college as a scholar in 1483, but there is no proof that this was the future instructor. There is, however, no doubt that the instructor and the composer are identical: one copy of Davy's antiphon <span class="italic">O domine caeli terraeque creator</span> bears the remarkable annotation &#145;Hanc antiphonam composuit Ricardus Davy uno die collegio magdalene Oxoniis&#146; (&#145;Richard Davy composed this antiphon in one day at Magdalen College, Oxford&#146;). It appears that soon after leaving Magdalen the composer took orders as a priest; in 1495&#150;6 the college paid for the binding of a volume of songs, masses, and antiphons of &#145;<i>dom</i>. Richard Davy&#146;. He may possibly have been the Richard Davy of Thorpe Malsor, Northamptonshire, who on 20 September 1494 was ordained priest by the bishop of Lincoln, in whose diocese Oxford lay.<br>
<br>Attempts to trace Davy's post-Magdalen career are impeded by the frequent occurrence of the name and its variants; no later reference unquestionably applies to him. A simple explanation could be that he died or moved to another institution whose archives are lost or await study. A composer of Davy's quality would have been a strong contender for appointment to the household chapel of a magnate; the fact that he produced both sacred and secular music may reflect his activity in an environment that was not exclusively religious.<br>
<br>It is tempting to identify the composer with the Richard Davy who by 1512 was a singer in the choir of Fotheringhay College, Northamptonshire, the prestigious chantry college of the house of York; he was still in place in 1533&#150;4; and dated his will on 31 March 1538. Richard Davy of Fotheringhay, however, was a layman, and therefore cannot be identified with Richard Davy of Magdalen, unless the Magdalen reference to &#145;<i>dom</i>. Richard Davy&#146; is to another namesake, or intends <i>dom[inus]</i> to denote possession of a degree rather than membership of the priesthood. Against the Fotheringay identification, however, is the fact that all of the known music by Richard Davy appears in the Eton choirbook; it would seem odd for him to have composed nothing else during the last thirty-five years of his life [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94452', "Composers of the Eton choirbook")</script>].<br>
<br>It is also conceivable that the composer moved from Oxford to Devon, where the <i>dominus</i> Richard Davy who revised music books belonging to Ashburton parish church in 1493&#150;4 can probably be identified with the Richard Davy who was admitted as a vicar-choral of the cathedral at Michaelmas 1494. Although such a move might to us appear retrogressive, it need not have seemed so at the time, and there could have been personal or financial reasons for it; a vicarage choral at Exeter was worth more than the instructorship at Magdalen, and the cathedral's requirement that its vicars-choral be priests allowed the prospect of presentation to a benefice. A later instructor at Magdalen, Nicholas Tucker, became clerk of the lady chapel (that is, master of the choristers) at Exeter in 1535. The ordination lists for Exeter diocese reveal two candidates possibly of local origin for identification with the cathedral vicar-choral: a Richard Davy was ordained subdeacon and deacon in 1491 and another was ordained subdeacon in 1492, although neither of these is known to have proceeded to the order of priest.<br>
<br>Richard Davy, vicar-choral of Exeter, vacated this office at some point between summer 1504 and summer 1510, apparently upon his presentation by the dean and chapter to the vicarage of Broadhembury, Devon, on 29 April 1507. While still at the cathedral, this Richard Davy had made a will on 6 July 1501; his date of death is indicated by the grant of probate on 11 July 1521. In 1501 he had appointed two of his fellow vicars-choral as executors, and had made provision for the bequest of a silver cup &#145;called a nutt&#146; to the sub-prioress of the priory of Polsloe, Devon, and of the remainder of his goods for the maintenance of his mother, Lucy.<br>
<br>The evidence seems therefore to relate to the careers of two or three church musicians named Richard Davy: a composer and instructor of the choristers at Magdalen College, Oxford, in the early 1490s, who may have entered the priesthood and whose later career is obscure; a man active in Devon, who was a priest by 1493&#150;4, became a vicar-choral of Exeter Cathedral in 1494 and held the vicarage of Broadhembury from 1507 until his death in 1521; and a lay-clerk of Fotheringhay College from 1512 or earlier until 1534 or later, who may have died about 1538.<br>
<br>Davy's extant compositions, several of which are now incomplete, include seven votive antiphons, a <span class="roman">Magnificat</span>, a setting of the Passion for Palm Sunday, and four songs in English. The Passion, in which he sets only the words of the crowd and the minor characters, is the most ambitious of the four such works known to survive from medieval England. Even more impressive are his antiphons, especially the colossal, virtuosic, and inexhaustibly inventive <span class="italic">In honore summae matris</span>, in which his sense of colour and flair for effective timing are imaginatively applied to a highly rhetorical text. Here, as in the almost equally ornate <span class="italic">Salve regina</span>, Davy makes a very large structure coherent by persistently re-using and developing brief musical motifs. Not all Davy's music is so elaborate; the <span class="italic">Stabat mater</span> is markedly more restrained, allowing him to create the sense of rapt involvement that contemporary devotional manuals prescribe for meditation on the Passion. Davy's devotional songs &#145;Ah, mine heart&#146;, an urgent apology for sin, and &#145;Ah, blessed Jesu&#146;, a vivid anticipation of death, achieve the eloquence and intensity typical of his Latin music.<br>
