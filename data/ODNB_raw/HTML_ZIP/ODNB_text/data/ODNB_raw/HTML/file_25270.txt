<span class="headword">Shaw,  Thomas Budd</span>  (1813&#150;1862), <span class="occ">translator and literary scholar</span>, was born on 12 October 1813 at 28 Gower Street, London, the youngest of the nine children of the architect <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25258/', "John Shaw (1776&#150;1832)")</script>, and his wife, Elizabeth Hester, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whitfield (<i>bap</i>. 1776, <i>d</i>. 1864). He was frail and myopic, but in 1822 his uncle the Revd Francis Whitfield took him to the warmer climate of Berbice (in modern Guyana), where his health improved. In 1826 he was enrolled at Shrewsbury School, where he demonstrated a voracious appetite for classical and modern literature. In 1833 he took up residence at St John's College, Cambridge, and kept eleven terms over the next six years. Open-handed and convivial, he frequented alehouses and the billiards room of the Dramatic Club; his rolling gait made him a familiar figure in the town. In 1836 he published anonymously <span class="italic">Theophrastus in Cambridge</span>, a fresh and witty treatment of young men's vices and follies, and then edited <span class="italic">The Fellow</span> and <span class="italic">The Individual</span>, ephemeral but entertaining weekly miscellanies for undergraduates. To these and to national journals he contributed original poems and essays, as well as verse translations from Latin, Italian, and German.<br>
<br>Before graduating BA in 1839 Shaw already lived partly in London and earned what he could by tutoring the sons of businessmen, but he shifted from address to cheap address, and on 26 June 1840 was declared an insolvent debtor; he left immediately for Russia. After examinations at St Petersburg University in Latin, Greek, arithmetic, and English literature, he was issued on 8 October with a licence to teach these subjects and until the end of 1841 served as tutor in the household of A. V. Vasilchikov in Moscow, surprising people as much by his Cambridge cap and gown as by his ability to read the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in Greek.<br>
<br>Back in St Petersburg in 1842, Shaw became friendly with Samuel Warrand (1792&#150;<i>c</i>.1855), English tutor to the imperial family and professor at the university, who had just established an <span class="italic">English Review of Literature</span>. Shaw edited this until it ceased publication in July 1843. As well as reprinting extracts from the British press on a multitude of topics, and introducing literary works such as Dickens's <span class="italic">Barnaby Rudge</span>, it carried verse and prose by Shaw, including articles on Wordsworth and Defoe. Also thanks to Warrand, whose daughter Annette Frances he married on 15 October 1842, Shaw became adjunct professor of English literature at Pushkin's old school, the Imperial Alexander Lyceum at Tsarskoye Selo. He proved a most successful teacher and was commissioned to write a textbook, which, first published in Russia in 1846, was greatly expanded as <span class="italic">Outlines of English Literature</span> and reprinted in London and Philadelphia in 1849.<br>
<br>From 1843 Shaw began to translate Russian literature. In addition to translating popular novels such as Bestuzhev-Marlinsky's <span class="italic">Ammalat-Bek</span> and Lazhechnikov's <span class="italic">The Heretic</span>, he abridged Gogol's story &#145;The Portrait&#146; and produced a remarkably vigorous yet faithful version of &#145;The gifts of Terek&#146;, the first significant English translation from the poetry of Lermontov. Most importantly, he promoted Pushkin's English reputation, translating &#145;The Coffin-Maker&#146; and &#145;Kirdjali&#146; and publishing an informative biography in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> (June&#150;August 1845). This included copious translated excerpts from Pushkin and drew on knowledge gained from friends of the poet such as P. A. Pletnyov (in whose household Shaw was tutor at one time). Writing as he did in the Russia of Nicholas I, Shaw was unable to discuss Pushkin's political views, but his study proved otherwise reliable and authoritative.<br>
<br>In 1851 Shaw took his MA degree in Cambridge, and, despite stiff competition, succeeded his father-in-law as professor of English at the University of St Petersburg. Afterwards he also became tutor to the young dukes Nikolay and Yevgeny of Leuchtenberg, and to the little grand dukes Vladimir and Aleksey, third and fourth sons of Alexander II. He had some influence on the course of literature both as censor of English books and by his encouragement of the critic Druzhinin, who profited from Shaw's <span class="italic">Outlines</span>. Shaw himself still published, contributing the entry &#145;Petersburg&#146; to the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> and writing about Chaucer for <span class="italic">Biblioteka dlya chteniya</span>, but he chiefly devoted himself to a revision of the <span class="italic">Outlines</span> and to a companion volume, <span class="italic">Choice Specimens of English Literature</span>; both were edited after his death by Dr William Smith, and the newly named <span class="italic">History of English Literature</span> remained in print until the end of the century.<br>
<br>Shaw, who for some years had been obese, contracted severe chest pains and died of an aneurysm at St Petersburg on 26 November 1862. His funeral was held five days later at the chapel of the British factory. A monument was erected at the lyceum to this fine scholar who spanned two literary worlds, uniquely able to interpret each through the eyes of both.<br>
