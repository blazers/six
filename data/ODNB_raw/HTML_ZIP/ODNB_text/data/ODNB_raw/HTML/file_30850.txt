<span class="headword">Bridge,  (Stephen Henry) Peter</span>  (1925&#150;1982), <span class="occ">theatre producer</span>, was born at Wimbledon, Surrey, on 5 May 1925, the only son and eldest child of Stephen Henry Howard Bridge (<i>d</i>. 1943), stockbroker, of Wimbledon, and his wife, Ella Mary Twine (<i>d</i>. 1940). He was educated at Tyttenhanger Lodge, Seaford, Sussex, and at Bryanston School, Dorset, which he left at sixteen, his mother and sister having been killed by enemy action in 1940. His father died in 1943. He was an actor before joining the RAF. Apart from landing at Normandy six days after D-day, he served in Burma in photographic intelligence and as personal assistant to the air officer commanding Hong Kong, where he ended as air aide-de-camp to the governor. Demobilized, Bridge worked for Lord Tedder as assistant manager of the RAF Malcolm clubs, but a love of theatre turned him to show business and in his early twenties he managed a tour of Diana Morgan's family comedy <span class="italic">Set to Partners</span>, which reached the Embassy, Swiss Cottage, as <span class="italic">Rain before Seven</span> in 1949. He co-produced Val Gielgud's <span class="italic">Party Manners</span> (Embassy, 1950). Neither play transferred.<br>
<br>In 1948 Bridge married Roslyn Mary, daughter of Douglas Seymour Foster, of independent means. They had three sons, of whom Andrew became a distinguished lighting designer. With a young wife and children to support, Bridge became assistant manager to Alec Clunes at the Arts Theatre Club, then rated as a small national theatre. He was also appointed manager of the Winter Garden Theatre when Clunes hoped it would become a second auditorium to the Arts, and he co-presented Christopher Fry's <span class="italic">The Firstborn</span>. When the Winter Garden venture failed, Bridge joined the ticket agency Keith Prowse to scour the provinces for plays to transfer to London (1953&#150;5). With the advent of independent television he then became director of sport for Associated Television (ATV), and as one of the country's six professional lawn-tennis referees (not to be confused with umpires) he produced ITV coverage of Wimbledon for two years. But the call of the theatre persisted, and in 1957&#151;when great changes were imminent in the British theatre after <span class="italic">Look Back in Anger</span>&#151;Bridge returned to the fold as an independent manager. Stars, he used to say, filled theatres, not upstart writers, hence his reputation for polished, bland revivals of Wilde, Shaw, Galsworthy, Coward, and Priestley, acted by the famous.<br>
<br>In fact Bridge was interested in new writers as long as they were not assertively intellectual. One such writer was Alan Ayckbourn. It was a notice in <span class="italic">The Stage</span>, the profession's weekly paper, of <span class="italic">Standing Room Only</span> (1961), about a bus load of passengers in a futuristic London traffic jam, that caught Bridge's eye. &#145;Will no management drive this bus into Shaftesbury Avenue?&#146; asked the reviewer, a member of the Scarborough company  (Watson, 61). Bridge was intrigued. He left London immediately for Yorkshire&#151;not that the play reached London&#151;but having bought it Bridge also bought a London bus, assuring Ayckbourn that success lay in the casting. Impressed by Bridge's tall, dark presence, genial self-assurance, and tendency to chain smoke, Ayckbourn kept on revising the play to suit various stars until it became unrecognizable. Eventually Bridge took another Ayckbourn piece to London, <span class="italic">Mr Whatnot</span> (1964), a frail whimsical comedy conducted mainly in mime, that failed but caught the fancy of Mrs Michael Hordern, whose husband starred in Ayckbourn's first West End hit, <span class="italic">Relatively Speaking</span> (1967). When his second was bound for London, <span class="italic">How the Other Half Loves</span> (1970), Bridge brought in Robert Morley to head the company. In summing up Bridge, a fashionable play agent called him &#145;a sweet, kind but talentless man, and as a manager rather pre-war: honourable and endearing but lacking in discrimination and in the belief that authors were as important, or more so, than stars&#146;  (Watson, 147).<br>
<br>Bridge had already brought to London a dozen other non-classical dramatists after Rosemary Anne Sisson's <span class="italic">The Queen and the Welshman</span>, with which he returned to management (Lyric, Hammersmith, 1957). Among them were a smash hit board-room drama, <span class="italic">Any Other Business</span> (1958); a well-received American trial-play, <span class="italic">Inherit the Wind</span> (1960); a lively West End revue, <span class="italic">On the Bright Side</span>; a whodunit, <span class="italic">Guilty Party</span> (1961); an unknown play by Tennessee Williams, <span class="italic">Period of Adjustment</span> (1962); and an Irish adaptation from James Joyce, <span class="italic">Stephen D</span> (1963). He also produced <span class="italic">Say Who You Are</span> by Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall (1965); Danny La Rue in <span class="italic">Come Spy with Me</span>; a new British musical, <span class="italic">Strike a Light</span>; a thriller, <span class="italic">Wait until Dark</span>; and, from Oxford, Aleksey Arbuzov's <span class="italic">The Promise</span>, with Judi Dench and Ian McKellen, long before they became stars. He also produced remarkable new plays such as Giles Cooper's <span class="italic">Happy Family</span>; Peter Terson's <span class="italic">Zigger-Zagger</span>; Robert Shaw's <span class="italic">The Man in the Glass Booth</span> (1967); and the relatively daring homosexual comedy, Mart Crowley's <span class="italic">The Boys in the Band</span> (1969).<br>
<br>A tireless traveller in search of theatrical talent, Bridge rarely missed an Edinburgh or Dublin festival, a Sunday night try-out, or a rumoured masterpiece on the fringe. His shows were not definable, but they suited middle-class, middle-aged, middlebrow audiences. The 1960s were his decade. In 1967 he had three West End openings within a fortnight. He slowed down a little in the 1970s. His last production was of Priestley's <span class="italic">Dangerous Corner</span> (1981), another all-star affair. What distinguished Bridge from other managers was his heart-felt, star-struck delight in theatre, especially its glamour. He was popular with actors and authors because, unlike other managers, he liked and respected them. Whether or not they shared his enthusiasm, he would telephone at all hours from all places with tidings of new projects, gossip, and box-office figures. Among his idols whom he was proud to engage were Jack Hulbert and Cicely Courtneidge, Eric Portman, Roger Livesey, Margaret Lockwood, Celia Johnson, Margaret Rawlings, Michael Denison, and Dulcie Gray. Few other managers could so serenely allow the so-called new wave of British drama to pass them by. Bridge died at his home, 15 Claremont Road, Highgate, London, on 24 November 1982.<br>
