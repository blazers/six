<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Peat,  Stanley</span>  (1902&#150;1969), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born at South Shields, co. Durham, on 23 August 1902, the eldest in the family of two sons and one daughter of John Peat, mining engineer of East Boldon, and his wife, Ada Bradford. He was a delicate infant, and was nursed through a serious illness (which left him with permanent curvature of the spine) by his maternal aunt, Alice Gibson. She was devoted to young Stanley, and for long periods she and her husband took care of the boy. Both the Gibsons were staunch Salvationists and it seems probable that Peat's ethics and lifelong love of music were a direct result of their influence. Peat's sickly childhood delayed his formal schooling until he was eight, when he attended Tyne Dock School and later Tyne Dock grammar school, but an active and fertile brain compensated for physical weaknesses and enabled him, in 1915, to win a scholarship to Rutherford College, Newcastle. There he was taught by several dedicated science teachers, including the chemistry master, William Carr, whose love of the subject fired Peat's imagination. In 1921 he won a state exhibition, an entrance exhibition, and an Earl Grey memorial scholarship to study at Armstrong College, Newcastle (later the University of Newcastle upon Tyne), where he read chemistry, and thus came under the influence of Professor W. N. Haworth. Peat graduated in 1924 with first-class honours, being awarded the Freire&#150;Marreco medal and prize, and was invited to join Haworth's research school. At that time Haworth was carrying out fundamental studies on the structures of simple sugars, and Peat was soon involved in studies on the ring forms of glucose and on the structure of maltose. When Haworth moved to the Mason chair of chemistry at Birmingham in 1925, he took with him an enthusiastic group of workers, including Peat as his personal assistant.<br>
<br>Peat, who was awarded his PhD in 1928, was appointed lecturer in biochemistry in the medical school at Birmingham but he returned to the chemistry department six years later. This brief excursion into biochemistry was to influence much of his later research. During the next fourteen years, and in spite of the advent of the war, Peat collaborated with Haworth to investigate the chemistry of sugars and important polysaccharides such as starch, cellulose, and agar, which resulted in the publication of over forty original papers in, mainly, the <span class="italic">Journal of the Chemical Society</span>.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1939 Peat married Elsie Florence, younger daughter of Henry H. V. Barnes, a dental surgeon who, with his family, had shared a house with Peat for some years. The couple had two daughters, Gillian (<i>b</i>. 1940) and Wendy (<i>b</i>. 1942). With the outbreak of hostilities Haworth turned his laboratories over to projects for the war effort, the start of an anxious period for Peat. He carried out work for the Admiralty and, for a time, worked on uranium compounds as part of the project leading ultimately to the atom bomb, but he was never happy in this work. He also served on the cellulose and cordite panel of the Ministry of Supply, and on a committee which was seeking alternatives to Japanese agar for microbiological work. During 1940 he became interested in work by C. S. Haines, which described the synthesis of starch using a plant enzyme. Haworth and Peat secured a sample of this starch and from this initial study stemmed an interest in the biological synthesis and breakdown of starch which continued for the rest of Peat's life. At the end of the war Peat was awarded the DSc and promoted to a readership.<br>
<br>In 1948 Peat was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in the same year he was appointed to the chair of chemistry at the University College of North Wales, Bangor, where he quickly established a research school. With W. J. Whelan as his able collaborator, he began to publish widely on starch and a variety of other plant polysaccharides, gaining worldwide recognition for his work. In honour of his research achievements, the Chemical Society invited him to give the Hugo M&uuml;ller lecture in 1959, but a serious illness prevented him from doing so.<br>
<br>In addition to his activities in research, Peat was a dedicated teacher, who took enormous pains over the teaching of organic chemistry to first-year students; he considered this the most important of the undergraduate courses. His clear and concise introduction to modern theories of chemical reactions was a revelation to generations of students. He also served in a wider sphere as dean of the faculty of science at Bangor, on the council and committees of the Chemical Society, and as a consultant to several research associations. From 1959 repeated illnesses prevented him from taking an active part in research, but he was always ready to give advice and encouragement to his colleagues until his death at Bangor on 22 February 1969, from a stroke. He was survived by his widow and daughters.<br>
