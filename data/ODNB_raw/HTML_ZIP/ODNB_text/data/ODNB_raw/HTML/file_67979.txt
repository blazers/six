<span class="headword">Throckmorton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lok; <em>other married name </em>Hickman]</span>,  Rose</span>  (1526&#150;1613), <span class="occ">businesswoman and protestant exile</span>, was born on 26 December 1526 in London, the third of eleven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16951/', "Sir William Lok (1480&#150;1550)")</script>, great-great-great-grandfather of the philosopher John Locke (1632&#150;1704), London mercer, sheriff, and alderman, and gentleman usher of the chamber to Henry VIII, and his second wife, Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1537), daughter of Sir Thomas Cook of Wiltshire. The mercer, merchant adventurer, and traveller <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16950/', "Michael Lok (c.1532&#150;1620x22)")</script> was her brother. Her parents were early English protestants and supporters of the royal divorce between Henry VIII and Katherine of Aragon, and her father and several brothers sometimes served as agents of the king in Flanders and France in the 1540s. In 1536 the Lok family lived in Cheapside &#145;at the sign of the Padlock&#146;. Rose's father served as sheriff of London in 1548 and was knighted by Edward VI the following year.<br>
<br>Rose's first husband, Anthony Hickman (<i>d</i>. 1573), whom she married on 28 November 1543, was the son of Walter Hickman of Woodford, and was also a London merchant. They had at least two children. Her second husband, Simon Throckmorton (1526?&#150;1585), of Brampton, was the third son of Richard Throckmorton of Higham Ferrers, and Joan Beaufort of Whilton, the nephew of Sir George Throckmorton of Coughton Court, and MP for Huntingdon in 1554 and 1559.<br>
<br>In 1610, aged eighty-four, Rose wrote an account of her life that began with her father's removal of the pope's bull against the king posted in Dunkirk in 1534. Rose claimed her father brought back religious books from overseas for the new queen, Anne Boleyn. Rose became a strong protestant through her mother's reading evangelical books to her and her sisters in secret at about this time. Her mother died after giving birth while in the country during a bout of the plague. Rose's husband, Anthony, was a merchant adventurer in partnership with her brother, Thomas Locke. They owned a number of ships and Richard Hakluyt wrote about several of their voyages &#145;to the south and southern parts of the world&#146;. One of these ships, the <i>Mary Rose</i>, was named after their wives. The Hickmans entertained eminent clergymen such as John Hooper, John Foxe, and John Knox, the last of whom made mention of them several times in his letters to his friend and Rose's sister-in-law, Anne Locke, between 1556 and 1561.<br>
<br>During the reign of Mary I Anthony and Thomas were charged with giving assistance to imprisoned protestants and for maintaining their heresy. They were committed to the Fleet prison and continued to be examined. After being remitted to confinement at the home of the lord treasurer, the marquess of Winchester, the two men were set free. Anthony thereafter travelled to Antwerp while Rose went to a remote area of Oxfordshire to give birth. In her account Rose talked to the bishops in prison in Oxford (Cranmer, Latimer, and Ridley), who agreed that she might have her child baptized according to the Catholic rite.<br>
<br>Out of conscience, Rose then left her homes in London and Rumford to join her husband in Antwerp. Rose chastised her sister-in-law Mary for her love of luxury and for not letting her husband, Thomas Locke, leave England. Rose preferred Antwerp because few attempts were made there to monitor attendance at Catholic services. While there she gave birth again and, this time, being part of a secret protestant congregation, had her child baptized by a protestant minister. She left Antwerp to return to England after Queen Mary's death (1558). Her account ends at this point so little is known about the later years of her life. She died on 21 November 1613 at the age of eighty-six, and an epitaph was written for her in 1637. While her recollections reflect a devoted protestant of evangelical theology and piety, she was also very caught up with business and material concerns, and with the impact of religious changes on her standard of living. Her interactions with many people of known repute testify to the high profile her family enjoyed in mid-Tudor politics and society.<br>
