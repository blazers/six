<span class="headword">Holyoake,  Francis</span>  (1566<span class="mult">x</span>73&#150;1653), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and lexicographer</span>, was born at Nether Whitacre, Warwickshire. He was admitted to Queen's College, Oxford, as a commoner in 1582, but is not recorded as being admitted to a degree. Wood claims that he had been a schoolteacher. However, Holyoake commenced study at Cambridge as a sizar at Emmanuel College on 1 April 1594, and moved to Peterhouse in Lent 1596. He was admitted BA in 1599 and was ordained priest on 29 June 1601, when he was noted as aged twenty-eight.<br>
<br>In 1604 Holyoake became curate of Thames Ditton, and then rector of Southam, Warwickshire, a living in the gift of the crown, where he lived until his death. At some point he married Judith, the daughter of Edmund Dalby of Brookhampton in Combrook, Warwickshire. A son, <a name="cosubject_13629"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Holyoake</span>  (1616&#150;1675)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 26 December 1616, probably at Stoneythorpe Hall in Long Itchington, and baptized by his father on 12 January 1617 at Southam.<br>
<br>Holyoake's first venture into lexicography, <span class="italic">Riders Dictionarie, Corrected and Augmented</span> (1606), was a revision of John Rider's <span class="italic">Bibliotheca scholastica</span> (1589). Holyoake took Rider's Latin index and created a genuine double dictionary by borrowing freely from Thomas Thomas's successful <span class="italic">Dictionarium linguae Latinae et Anglicanae</span> (1587). The rights to Rider's dictionary had recently passed from a London stationer, Cuthbert Burby, to a powerful London book-trade syndicate, and the work immediately became embroiled in the ongoing tussle between the Cambridge University printer, John Legate, and the Stationers' Company in London, since Thomas's dictionary had been published in Cambridge. A &#145;reprehensible agreement&#146;  (McKitterick, 119) was struck over the production of these competing works; editions of both dictionaries were published in 1606.<br>
<br>Holyoake's second work was entitled <span class="italic">A Sermon of Obedience Especially unto Authoritie Ecclesiasticall</span>, preached and published in 1610. The work was dedicated to Sir C. Throckmorton, and was reprinted in 1613. Holyoake's next version of Rider, entitled <span class="italic">Riders Dictionarie Corrected, and with the Addition of about Five Hundred Words Enriched</span>, only slightly augmented, appeared in 1612. It included an etymological component, largely taken from Ambrogio Calepino's <span class="italic">Dictionarium</span>. The next edition of the dictionary, in 1617, added some Greek terms, many again from Thomas.<br>
<br>Holyoake was elected to the southern convocation in 1625. His dictionary was again published in 1626 as <span class="italic">Dictionarium etymologicum Latinum</span>, but this time with augmentation and many improvements by Nicholas Gray. Undeterred by the grant in 1621 of a new patent for the Thomas dictionary to the Cambridge publisher John Legate junior, Holyoake himself produced a new edition in 1627, and further editions during Holyoake's lifetime appeared in 1633, 1639, and 1648. He was granted a fourteen-year patent for his dictionary in 1635.<br>
<br>Holyoake's life was, however, abruptly disrupted in his old age by the civil war. Royalist sympathies led to his home being raided by parliamentary forces in 1642. A roundhead subaltern, Nehemiah Walton, describes Southam as &#145;a very malignant town, both minister and people&#146;, relating that &#145;we pillaged the minister, and tooke from him a drum and severall armes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Archeologia</span>, 316). Holyoake was also described as of &#145;very evill and dissolute conversation&#146;  (Tennant, 36). His son's petition at the Restoration for compensation claimed that a servant was killed and the death of his mother hastened, and that the family was reduced to living on charity.<br>
<br>Holyoake had his estate, valued at &pound;300 per annum, sequestrated on 22 April 1647 for inciting his parishioners and keeping arms in his house; he was permitted to retain one-fifth of his income, as was normal in cases of deprivation, in view of his age. There were also disputes with parishioners and sequestrators over the felling of timber on the glebe in 1646, and an action for trespass in 1648. Nevertheless, a new edition of the dictionary duly appeared in 1648. At this time Holyoake also presented a manuscript to Queen's College Library entitled &#145;Hugguccionis, seu Huguitionis, Pisani, ep. Ferrariensis, lexicon alphabeticum&#146;.<br>
<br>Francis Holyoake was buried in St Mary's, Warwick, in 1653, when his age was given as eighty-six, and his monument was placed in the north transept. His character is suggested both by his staunch royalism and by his refusal to desist from blatant and repeated plagiarism of Thomas's dictionary.<br>
<br>Holyoake's son Thomas went to Coventry grammar school and then Queen's College, Oxford; having commenced in Michaelmas term 1632, he graduated BA in 1636 and MA in 1639. He became a chaplain of Queen's in 1637, and in 1641 was presented to the living of Birdingbury, Warwickshire. At the outbreak of the civil war he was commissioned to lead an infantry company consisting largely of scholars. The king rewarded him for his services with a doctorate of divinity, a title used in his will. Holyoake was licensed by the university in 1647 to practise medicine following the surrender of the garrison at Oxford in 1646.<br>
<br>On 27 July 1660 Holyoake petitioned the king for restitution of the harm done by the sequestration of his father's estate, and asked to be presented to the rectory of Tatenhill, Staffordshire, pointing out the family's difficulties, and that he had had to care for his aged father. Another petition followed, requesting confirmation of the grant of the living of Nuneaton, in which he complained about the anti-royalist sermons of the incumbent, Richard Pyke. He petitioned a third time in October 1660, requesting presentation to both parishes. However, he was presented to Whitnash, near Warwick, and was also made a prebendary of the collegiate church of Wolverhampton. In 1674 he received the donative of Breamore, Hampshire. He died there of a fever on 10 June 1675. His will, which was proved on 5 June 1678, provided amply for his family since he had acquired property in both Warwickshire and Breamore, which he left to his wife, Anne, and his sons. He was also able to leave &pound;200 to both his daughters. Thomas Holyoake revised and enlarged his father's dictionary, but the work was published posthumously by his own eldest son, Charles, in 1677.<br>
