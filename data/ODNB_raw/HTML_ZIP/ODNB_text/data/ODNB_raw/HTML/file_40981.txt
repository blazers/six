<span class="headword">Nicholas,  Thomas Evan</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Niclas y Glais]</span>  (1879&#150;1971), <span class="occ">poet and political activist</span>, was born on 6 October 1879 at Y Llety, a smallholding in the parish of Llanfyrnach, Pembrokeshire, one of the five children of David (Dafydd) Nicholas (1844&#150;1928), a farmer, and his wife, Elizabeth (Bet) Evans, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thomas (1844&#150;1937). After attending primary school at nearby Hermon, he studied for the Congregational ministry at the Gwynfryn Academy in Ammanford and was ordained at Llandeilo in 1901. On 1 October 1902 he married Mary Alice (1879&#150;1965), the daughter of Thomas Hopkins, a watchmaker and jeweller of Ammanford. He spent a year as a minister in Dodgeville, Wisconsin, before returning to Wales to take up the pastorate of Seion in the industrial village of Glais in the Swansea valley in 1904; although he only spent ten years there, he was associated with that place for the rest of his life and was generally known in Welsh as Niclas y Glais.<br>
<br>Already firmly egalitarian in outlook, Nicholas was to develop his political creed, which he claimed was communist long before he had read Marx because it sprang from his Christian beliefs, in a south Wales which, over the next decade, brought harsh reminders of the clash between workers and the capitalist system: the Cambrian Combine lock-out and Tonypandy riots of 1910 and the Senghennydd pit disaster of 1913, the worst in the annals of British coalmining, were among the events which helped to shape his thinking. His early verse, published in <span class="italic">Salmau'r werin</span> (1909), <span class="italic">Cerddi gwerin</span> (1912), <span class="italic">Cerddi rhyddid</span> (1914), <span class="italic">Y rhyfel anghyfiawn</span> (1914), and <span class="italic">Dros eich gwlad</span> (1920), blazed with millenarian biblical imagery; its message was that it is not man's spiritual imperfections but the inhuman economic system under which he lives that is responsible for social injustice, oppression, and war. Having joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) he became a prominent public speaker, a regular contributor to the Welsh column of the party's newspaper, <span class="italic">The Merthyr Pioneer</span>, and a close friend of its editor, Keir Hardie, MP for Merthyr Tudful, whose opposition to militarism he shared.<br>
<br>In 1914 Nicholas left Glais to become minister of Llangybi and Llanddewibrefi in Cardiganshire, where he began organizing the county's agricultural workers and lead miners and using his pulpit to denounce what he considered to be an imperialist war which was against the interests of the working class. His sermons were monitored by Home Office informers for &#145;treasonable&#146; sentiments, and in 1918, after he had delivered a particularly outspoken sermon in his own chapel, there was an unsuccessful attempt to prosecute him under the <span class="roman">Defence of the Realm Act</span>. When he founded the No-Conscription Fellowship many chapels closed their doors to him, and at the war's end he abandoned the ministry in disgust. In the election of 1918 he stood as the ILP candidate in Aberd&acirc;r, part of Hardie's old constituency, with the backing of the local trades council, the Labour Party, and the co-operative movement. His programme was uncompromisingly anti-imperialist and socialist, supporting people's control of industry, the concept of a League of Nations, self-government for Ireland and autonomy for Scotland and Wales, and the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917; he was defeated by the &#145;Britisher&#146; candidate, Charles Butt Stanton, who polled 22,834 votes against the 6229 cast for Nicholas. It was the Russian Revolution which confirmed his Marxist ideals and inspired him to write many of the poems in which his vision of international brotherhood, peace, and proletarian solidarity was expressed.<br>
<br>In 1921, with his wife, Nicholas trained as a dentist, and he established practices first at Pontardawe and then at Aberystwyth, where he remained for the rest of his life. Between 1917 and 1945 he delivered more than a thousand lectures on the Soviet Union, which he had visited, and in 1920 he was a founder member of the Communist Party of Great Britain, but he did not resume his political journalism until 1937, when his column in the weekly newspaper <span class="italic">Y Cymro</span> began to appear under the title &#145;O fyd y werin&#146;; one of his main concerns was to warn against appeasement of Hitler and Mussolini. He also founded at about this time, with J. Roose Williams, the short-lived paper <span class="italic">Llais y Werin</span>. On 11 November 1940 he was arrested, with his son Islwyn (one of his four children), and detained in Swansea and Brixton prisons, but the charges were shown to be spurious after a vigorous campaign was mounted by the labour movement, and they were released after two months. The fruit of this episode was <span class="italic">Llygad y drws</span> (1940), a sequence of 288 sonnets which he had scratched on a slate in his cell, copied out on toilet paper, and then arranged to be smuggled out of gaol by a sympathetic warder; an English version was translated by Daniel Hughes and others and published as <span class="italic">Prison Sonnets</span> in 1948.<br>
<br>Nicholas's career as a poet had two phases. Up to about 1920 he wrote, for the most part, poems of political polemic, alternately vitriolic and apocalyptic, and most effective when the bludgeon of rhetoric was supplemented by the cutting edge of irony. In his later books, notably <span class="italic">Terfysgoedd daear</span> (1939), <span class="italic">Canu'r carchar</span> (1942), <span class="italic">Y dyn &acirc;'r gaib</span> (1944), <span class="italic">Dryllio'r delwau</span> (1941), and <span class="italic">'Rwyn gweld o bell</span> (1963), the stridency of the earlier period was held in check by a greater economy of diction and control of form (particularly the sonnet), though the conflict between labour and international capitalism, and the Christian imperative to improve man's lot on earth, remained his favourite subjects. A selection of his poems (with English prose translations) appeared posthumously in the volume <span class="italic">Tros ryddid daear</span> (1981) under the aegis of Cymdeithas Niclas, the society named in his honour.<br>
<br>Nicholas was the most eloquent and uncompromising spokesman for the ILP and the Soviet state in the Welsh language. Acclaimed by Harry Pollitt in 1949 as &#145;Wales's greatest man&#146;, he combined a rigorous Marxist analysis of society with what he saw as most progressive within the Welsh radical nonconformist tradition. Among his <i>b&ecirc;tes noires</i> were the capitalist system, the Roman Catholic church, and the monarchy. Communism was for him the creed which gave meaning, hope, and dignity to the lives of ordinary people, and all his writing, whether in verse or prose, was dedicated to that ideal. His poetry, while Welsh in form, is consistently socialist and internationalist in content, and awaits the wider recognition it deserves.<br>
<br>The poet, whose genial personality won him many friends in Wales and abroad, died at his home, Glasynys, in Elm Tree Avenue, Aberystwyth, on 19 April 1971; after a funeral service at Baker Street Independent Chapel, his ashes were scattered on a slope of the Preseli hills above Y Llety, where he had been born.<br>
