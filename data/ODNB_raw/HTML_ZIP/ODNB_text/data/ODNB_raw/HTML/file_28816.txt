<span class="headword">Waters, Sir  John</span>  (1773/4&#150;1842), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at T&#375;-fry, near Welsh St Donats, Glamorgan. His grandfather, Edward Waters of Pittcott, was high sheriff of Glamorgan in 1754. His father, name unknown, died young, leaving a large family. The marquess of Bute obtained a commission for the son in the 1st (Royal Scots) foot on 2 August 1797. He joined the 2nd battalion in Portugal, and served with it in the expeditions to The Helder in 1799, and to Egypt in 1801. He had become lieutenant on 15 February 1799, and in reward for his conduct during a mutiny at Gibraltar in 1802 the duke of Kent obtained a company for him in the York rangers on 24 September 1803. He remained, however, with the 1st, and went with them to the West Indies. On 28 February 1805 he was promoted captain in the 1st, to which two new battalions had been added, and soon afterwards returned to England.<br>
<br>In August 1808, owing to the duke of Kent's recommendation, he was made aide-de-camp to Brigadier Charles William Stewart (afterwards third marquess of Londonderry). He went with him to Portugal, and served in Moore's campaign. Sent out to obtain intelligence of the French movements in December, he bought from the Spaniards at Valdestillas an intercepted dispatch from Berthier to Soult, which gave Moore most important information, and at once altered his plans. He was promoted major on 16 February 1809, and was attached to the Portuguese army (with the local rank of lieutenant-colonel), but employed on intelligence duties, for which he was praised by Wellington, who wanted him definitely placed on his staff. The most conspicuous instance of Waters's usefulness was at the passage of the Douro on 12 May. The French had broken the bridge and removed the boats, and had 10,000 men on the opposite bank. Waters discovered a poor barber who had crossed the river with a small skiff the previous night; and they, joined by the prior of Amarante, crossed the river undetected, and returned with three large barges, in which the first troops crossed.<br>
<br>On 3 April 1811, before the action of Sabugal began, Waters was made prisoner, after he had crossed the Coa to reconnoitre. &#145;He had rendered very important services upon many occasions in the last two years, and his loss is sensibly felt&#146;  (Wellington to Lord Liverpool, 9 April 1911; <span class="italic">Selections from the Dispatches</span>, 7.433). He refused parole, and was sent to Salamanca with a guard of four gendarmes. Better mounted than they, he awaited his opportunity, and put spurs to his horse. He was on a wide plain, with French troops before and behind him; as he rode along their flank some encouraged, others fired at him. Passing between two columns he reached a wooded hollow, and evaded his pursuers. Two days later he reached British headquarters, &#145;where Lord Wellington, knowing his resolute, subtle character, had caused his baggage to be brought, observing that he would not be long absent&#146;  (Napier, bk 12, chap. 5). On 15 April Wellington appointed him (subject to confirmation) an assistant adjutant-general, and on 30 May he was made brevet lieutenant-colonel.<br>
<br>Waters served throughout the war, being present at Talavera, Busaco, Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, Salamanca, Vitoria, the battles of the Pyrenees (during which he was wounded while speaking to Wellington), the Nivelle and Nive, Orthez and Toulouse. At Badajoz and Salamanca he acted as adjutant-general. He received the gold cross with four clasps, and was made CB in 1815. He was at Waterloo, and again acted as adjutant-general after Sir Edward Barnes was wounded, and signed the returns of the battle, though he was himself wounded also. He received the Russian order of St Anne (2nd class). After a time on half pay, he became captain and lieutenant-colonel in the Coldstream Guards on 15 May 1817. He was promoted colonel on 19 July 1821, and was again placed on half pay on 15 February 1827. He became major-general on 22 July 1830, was made captain of Yarmouth Castle, Isle of Wight, on 22 April 1831, and KCB on 1 March 1832. He was made colonel of the 81st foot on 15 June 1840, and promoted lieutenant-general on 23 November 1841. He died at Park Place, St James's, London, on 21 November 1842, at the age of sixty-eight, and was buried at Kensal Green.<br>
