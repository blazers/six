<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilson,  George</span>  (1630/31?&#150;1711), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, lacked, by his own account, &#145;the great blessings of academical education&#146; save what he had &#145;fetched out of the fire&#146; in his laboratory  (Gibbs), and virtually nothing is known of his origins. His date of birth has to be inferred from the preface to the third (1709) edition of his <span class="italic">A Compleat Course of Chymistry</span>, in which he says that he was then seventy-eight. This work contains an engraved portrait showing aquiline features, evidently drawn in middle life. Wilson first emerges shortly before 1665, when he was established in London at the sign of Hermes Trismegistus, in Watling Street, as a maker of chemicals, largely medicinal. Later, from about 1690, he operated at the sign of Hermes Head in Well Yard, West Smithfield. He catered for &#145;Doctors of Physick, Apothecaries, Chirurgions, and others Studious of Physick or Curious in Chymical Operations&#146;  (Gibbs).<br>
<br>During the plague of 1665 Wilson was kept busy supplying the potions&#151;many containing arsenic, antimony, and sulphur&#151;with which physicians sought to control the disease. Some of his colleagues succumbed, among them George Starkey, from whom he had acquired the recipe for his famous &#145;compound soap pills&#146;, which found their way into the <span class="italic">London Pharmacopoeia</span> in 1746. The &#145;soap&#146; was a mixture of salt of tartar and turpentine, blended with opium. In the 1670s Wilson developed a very popular &#145;anti-rheumatick tincture&#146;, initially to relieve his own affliction. Through these two remedies he attracted distinguished custom. That of James II, exercised through Wilson's patron, William Paston, second earl of Yarmouth, proved a mixed blessing. In December 1688 the mob destroyed Wilson's laboratory, believing, as he said, that he &#145;was preparing the Devil's Fireworks, purposely to burn the City and Whitehall&#146;  (Gibbs).<br>
<br>From about 1690 Wilson also supported himself by giving courses of lectures on chemistry, mainly to physicians and medical students, claiming to have instructed &#145;many Eminent Physicians now living in England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Italy, Germany, and Swedeland, etc.&#146;. As a complement to these he published in 1691 his <span class="italic">Compleat Course of Chymistry</span>, rather similar to N. L&eacute;mery's <span class="italic">Cours de chymie</span> (1675). Illustrated with engravings of chemical apparatus, it went through many editions and is a landmark in the transformation of alchemy, with its strong mystical element, into chemistry as an exact science. It was highly thought of by the natural philosopher Stephen Hales, and as late as 1746 it was revised by the pharmaceutical chemist William Lewis, then a fellow of the Royal Society, who recorded that he &#145;frequently had recourse&#146;  (Gibbs) to the earlier editions.<br>
<br>Wilson is known to have married, for his wife, Mary, helped him and continued the business for a time after his death, but nothing is known of her origins or ultimate fate. His son Edward, who also for a time sold the &#145;anti-rheumatick tincture&#146;, died young. Wilson died in August 1711, probably on the 15th, and was buried in the parish church of St Bartholomew-the-Less on 17 August, but following an eighteenth-century reconstruction there is now no trace of his grave.<br>
