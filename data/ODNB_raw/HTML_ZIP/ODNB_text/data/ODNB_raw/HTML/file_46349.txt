<span class="headword">Becher,  Martin William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Captain Becher]</span>  (1797&#150;1864), <span class="occ">jockey</span>, born on 18 May 1797, possibly at Hillington, near King's Lynn, was the son of William Becher (<i>d</i>. 1816), an army man turned Norfolk farmer and horse-dealer. He secured a position in the storekeeper-general's department at Brussels, supplying Wellington's troops. His own later rank of captain was an honorary one in the Buckinghamshire yeomanry cavalry. On his return to Britain he worked initially as a horse-coper but later as first jockey for Thomas Coleman. Proprietor of the Turf Hotel at St Albans, Coleman is generally credited with pioneering the commercial development of steeplechasing when he promoted the St Albans steeplechase in 1830. He encouraged Becher to take up riding over fences; not that the gallant captain required much persuasion, for he had been taught to ride all manner of horses as a child and was a skilled horseman. Although accepted as qualified to ride in races restricted to gentlemen, Becher made a living from riding and from schooling horses over fences for their owners. On 14 August 1825 he had married Susan, only daughter of John Dobree. <br>
<br>Becher's name is associated in the national memory with the Grand National steeplechase. In 1836, riding The Duke, he won William Lynn's inaugural chase at Aintree and two years later he came third on the same horse. However, it was in the 1839 race, usually recognized as the first Grand National (even though the title was not formally adopted until 1847), that Becher gained racing immortality. When running second in a field of seventeen, his mount, Conrad, fell at a specially constructed jump in which a brook had been dammed to make it 8 feet wide and a 3&frac12; foot wooden fence set back about a yard in front of the water. The hazard was increased by the landing area being a yard or so lower than the take-off side. Becher landed in the water and sensibly crouched in safety in the deepest part of the brook until the rest of the horses had passed by. Less sensibly, perhaps, he remounted only to take another soaking at the next water jump. Although he never rode again in a Grand National, such was his celebrity that the fence at which he fell became known as Becher's brook.<br>
<br>Becher's last public ride was at Doncaster's Cantley Common course on 19 March 1847. His horse fell. After giving up racing he was appointed inspector of sacks for the Great Northern Railway at Boston, Lincolnshire. A boisterous character, he would drink and sing late into the night at post-race celebrations. His favourite party trick was to run around a room on the wainscoting without touching the floor. In later life he was described as being thickset, with bushy hair and a kindly, rugged face enlivened by small but penetrating eyes. Becher died on 11 October 1864 at 21 Maida Hill, St John's Wood, London, and was buried at Willesden cemetery. At an auction to dispose of his estate, his seven silk riding jerseys brought 5<i>s</i>. Becher's brook was filled in 1990 but remains a challenging fence on the Aintree circuit, a fitting memorial to a tough and intrepid rider.<br>
