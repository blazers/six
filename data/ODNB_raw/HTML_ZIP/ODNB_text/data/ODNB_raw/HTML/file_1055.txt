<span class="headword">Bailey,  Nathan</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1691, <em>d.</em> 1742), <span class="occ">lexicographer and schoolmaster</span>, was baptized on 7 October 1691 in Mill Yard church, a Seventh Day Baptist congregation in Goodman's Fields, Whitechapel, just east of the City of London. His church was opposed to infant baptism and Bailey signed a church document as early as 1692. In 1711 he was censured by the church for having indulged in:<blockquote>frequent light and late conversation with two single women, he being a single man and a high professor [that is, one who has openly professed his religion], and they in principle and practice being so unfit company for his diversion and pleasure. (Mill Church minute book, quoted in Ball, 94)</blockquote>He seems to have been dropped from the membership of the congregation by 1718. From as early as 1721 and until as late as 1736 he boarded and instructed youths in &#145;the <i>Latin</i>, <i>Greek</i>, and <i>Hebrew</i> Languages, <i>Writing</i>, <i>Accounts</i>, and other Parts of School Learning, in a Method more easy and expeditious than common &hellip; at his House in Stepney, near the Church&#146;  (N. Bailey, <span class="italic">Dictionarium Britannicum</span>, 1736). Whitley credits Bailey with an LLD degree&#151;an honorary degree, according to <span class="italic">Transactions of the Baptist Historical Society</span>&#151;but it is not known which institution awarded him this degree. He married by February 1733 (the date of the burial of his mother-in-law at Mill Yard); the couple had at least one son, who was buried in March 1750. Two further references in the Mill Yard burial register to &#145;Mrs Bayley&#146; on 8 January 1738 and 18 June 1744 probably mark the death dates of his mother and wife respectively  (TNA: PRO, RG 4/4505).<br>
<br>Bailey's first dictionary, <span class="italic">An universal etymological English dictionary: comprehending the derivations of the generality of words in the English tongue, either ancient or modern</span> (1721), was followed by what claimed to be a second volume in 1727, which included an &#145;orthographical dictionary, shewing both the orthography and orthoepia of the English tongue&#146;  (title-page). &#145;Volume II&#146;, as the 1727 volume is generally known, introduced accentuation markings for the first time in a general English dictionary&#151;perhaps following the precedent of Thomas Dyche's <span class="italic">Spelling Dictionary</span> (1723)&#151;to compensate for the presumed inexperience of the reader: &#145;forasmuch as many Persons of a small Share of Literature and not very conversant in Books, are frequently apt to accent Words wrong&#146;  (preface). The two octavos were soon succeeded by the folio <span class="italic">Dictionarium Britannicum</span> (1730; 2nd edn, 1736). Dozens of editions of the first octavo work were published during the eighteenth century and after; they formed the basis for a number of English&#150;German dictionaries, which began to appear in Germany from 1736 onwards.<br>
<br>Bailey's English dictionaries gave a new prominence to etymology and to lexical comprehensiveness, including dialect terms, scientific terms, common words, and even vulgar ones; they also (in the second octavo volume and in the folios) made the first extensive use of pictorial illustration, inserting some 500 small woodcuts &#145;for the more easy and clear apprehending&#146; of the terms defined according to the title-page of &#145;Volume II&#146;. Most depicted heraldic elements and scientific and military equipment. Additional encyclopaedic materials included iconological and mythological information, and proverbs explained in homely English and paralleled in Greek, Latin, French, and Italian.<br>
<br>Samuel Johnson used the second edition of Bailey's folio as a basis for developing his own dictionary, which competed with Bailey's for decades. Though Johnson's dictionary achieved the prestige of literary authority, Bailey's long remained popular, especially among autodidacts. Even William Pitt, the first earl of Chatham, though schooled at Eton, honed his celebrated parliamentary rhetoric by reading one of Bailey's dictionaries &#145;twice &hellip; from beginning to end&#146;  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 5th ser., 1, 1874, 448). Thomas Chatterton may have mined the antique diction for his forged Rowley poems from Bailey. Notable fictional devotees of Bailey include the inexperienced but confident Mrs Western in <span class="italic">Tom Jones</span>, the ten-year-old Lydgate in <span class="italic">Middlemarch</span>, and the carpenter hero of <span class="italic">Adam Bede</span>, who &#145;had read &hellip; a great deal of Bailey's Dictionary&#146;  (Eliot, 1.320). Abraham Lincoln is said to have used a copy of the fourteenth edition (1751) of Bailey's first octavo dictionary. On the title-page of the first edition Bailey had invited those readers who lacked a thorough literary education: &#145;the Ignorant, and &hellip; young Students, Artificers, Tradesmen and Foreigners&#146; (here, as elsewhere, he followed the precedent and even the phrasing of John Kersey's <span class="italic">Dictionarium Anglo-Britannicum</span>, 1708). The success of Bailey's dictionaries contributed to the diffusion of literacy in the eighteenth century&#151;even to the global diffusion of English, which, by virtue of its mixed lineage and lexical inheritances, Bailey reckoned to be &#145;the most Copious and Significant Language in Europe, if not in the World&#146;  (1721, preface).<br>
<br>Aside from another dictionary, the <span class="italic">Dictionarium domesticum</span> (1736)&#151;actually an alphabetized farmhouse manual&#151;and <span class="italic">The Antiquities of London and Westminster</span> (1722; 2nd edn, 1734), a duodecimo guidebook abridged from books &#145;voluminous and dear&#146; to convey local knowledge to &#145;the Generality&#146;  (preface, &#145;To the reader&#146;), Bailey wrote several textbooks for grammar schools; these appeared in numerous editions, and were apparently informed by his own experience as a schoolmaster. They include a translation of Erasmus's <span class="italic">Colloquies</span> (1725, reprinted occasionally until 1900), editions of selections from Ovid, Phaedrus, and Justin, an English spelling book, and an English translation of a Latin exercise book. The <span class="italic">Colloquies</span>, a collection of exemplary dialogues in Latin, had long been an obligatory school text; Bailey provided the student with a sinewy translation meant to ease his understanding of the Latin original. (He also shows sympathy with Erasmus's anti-clericalism.) Bailey's editions of selected classics resort to various devices to ease the student's task: these devices range from a numerical &#145;clavis&#146; in the margin, signalling the grammatical order underlying the rhetorical order of a line of verse (apparently an innovation), to a fully articulated reordering of the Latin, to supplying an outright translation. In emphasizing grammatical order, Bailey tacitly adopted and extended a pedagogical approach that had been associated with John Brinsley and, before him, Martin Crusius. In emphasizing easiness for the student generally, even to the point of providing translations, Bailey professed himself a disciple of John Locke&#151;&#145;the great Mr. <i>Lock</i>&#146;, who had urged, &#145;If the <i>Latin</i> Tongue is to be learn'd, let it be done the easiest way&#146;  (N. Bailey, ed., <span class="italic">M. J. Justini ex Trogi Pompeii historiis externis</span>, 1732, iii). Bailey's English dictionaries gained much of their lasting popularity from a similar pragmatic expediency or concern for the reader.<br>
<br>Bailey died on 27 June 1742 and was buried on 4 July 1742 at Mill Yard church at the price rated for a member of the congregation. His death was noticed by the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. An engraved head-and-shoulders portrait in three-quarters profile, captioned &#145;N. Bailey, <i>Philologos</i>&#146; (which is how he was styled on several title-pages), appeared as the frontispiece to Bailey's <span class="italic">Introduction to the English Tongue</span> in 1726&#151;the year in which his first octavo dictionary reached its third edition, and the year after his translation of Erasmus appeared. That portrait probably served as the model for a later frontispiece published in Germany, signed by the engraver Christoph Sysang (1736). In the original engraving Bailey looks well fed and amiable, if somewhat upstaged by his periwig, neck cloth, and what may be an academic gown; the Sysang engraving makes him look yet more august.<br>
