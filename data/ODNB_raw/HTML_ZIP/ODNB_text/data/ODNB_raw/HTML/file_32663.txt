<span class="headword">Cummings,  Bruce Frederick</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>W. N. P. Barbellion]</span>  (1889&#150;1919), <span class="occ">zoologist and diarist</span>, was born at Barnstaple, Devon, on 7 September 1889, the youngest of the six children of John Cummings, a journalist, and his wife, Maria Elizabeth Richards. He was educated at a private school in Barnstaple and after leaving school at the age of sixteen was apprenticed until 1910 as a journalist on the <span class="italic">Devon and Exeter Gazette</span>. Well before leaving school Cummings had developed a strong interest in natural history, especially ornithology. He rejected the prospect of a career in local journalism and aimed to gain a position in natural history at the end of his apprenticeship. In pursuit of this ambition he undertook a strenuous programme of self-education; his diary entry for 10 March 1908 includes, in addition to shorthand and typewriting, &#145;German, chemistry classes, electricity lectures, zoology (including dissections), and field work&#146;  (Barbellion, <span class="italic">Journal</span>, 13).<br>
<br>Cummings published specialized papers in natural history from as early as 1906. In 1912 he took up an appointment at the Natural History Museum in South Kensington as one of the five new permanent staff appointed to the insect room, soon to be renamed the department of entomology. These positions carried considerable research and curatorial responsibility; his appointment was a remarkable achievement for one who had no formal training in the subject.<br>
<br>The first decade of the twentieth century saw a rapid expansion in the entomological collections of the British Museum (Natural History), as it was formally known, and each of the assistants was assigned particular orders for which he was sole curator and researcher: Cummings was in charge of the Neuroptera, Isoptera, Mallophaga, and Auroplura. The atmosphere in the entomology department in those years was one of mutual isolation, darkened rooms, and stiff formality. According to one of his colleagues, the despair characteristic of Cummings's most famous literary work was the product of this environment  (Riley, 2). He was not especially active in the day-to-day responsibilities of his post, and the collections for which he was responsible were still in considerable disorder after his departure. However, one part of the corner of entomology for which he was professionally responsible saw much activity during his tenure, as conditions in the trenches during the First World War led to official demands for information on the behaviour of lice. His diary in these years shows him grappling with the emotional challenge posed by these creatures, expressions of disgust being combined with satisfied remarks on the privilege of scientific detachment.<br>
<br>Cummings's period of employment at the museum coincided with his gradually deteriorating health. He suffered from a degenerative disease of the central nervous system described as &#145;disseminated sclerosis&#146;, but this diagnosis was kept from him for a long time. He married Winifred Eleanor Benger, a fashion designer, on 15 September 1915, and they had a daughter in the following year. In July 1917 Cummings resigned from the museum. Bedridden and in considerable distress he occupied himself with preparing extracts from his voluminous diaries for publication. These were published in the spring of 1919 as <span class="italic">The Journal of a Disappointed Man</span> under the pseudonym W. N. P. Barbellion. The book was introduced by H. G. Wells, whom some reviewers took to be the author. Wells also organized a trust fund for the maintenance of Cummings and his family.<br>
<br>Sometimes described as a minor classic, <span class="italic">The Journal of a Disappointed Man</span> was reissued in 1984. Made up of reflective vignettes from the daily life of its author, its interest lies not least in his descriptions of the effects of physical pain and disability, where he combines the precision of a natural historian with the passionate subjectivity of the sufferer. This was not Cummings's first foray into general writing, as he had earlier published a number of essays bearing on the relations between natural history and general culture. Following the success of <span class="italic">The Journal of a Disappointed Man</span> some of these were republished under his pseudonym with the title <span class="italic">Enjoying Life and other Literary Remains</span> (1919). The most notable essay is a critique of the ethic of collecting and conservation which first appeared as &#145;The art of perpetuation&#146; in <span class="italic">Science Progress</span> (1917) under the name Bruce Cummings.<br>
<br>Cummings died shortly after his thirtieth birthday, on 22 October 1919, at his home, Camden Cottage, Gerrards Cross. <span class="italic">A Last Diary</span>, whose entries cover the period from 21 March 1918 to 3 June 1919, was published posthumously in 1920. However in contrast to <span class="italic">The Journal of a Disappointed Man</span>, this diary was written for publication and its quality is unremarkable.<br>
