<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Piper, Sir  David Towry</span>  (1918&#150;1990), <span class="occ">museum director and writer</span>, was born on 21 July 1918 in Wimbledon, Surrey, the second of three sons (the oldest of whom was killed in action in 1941) of Stephen Harvey Piper, later professor of physics at Bristol University, and his wife, Mary Joyce Casswell. He was educated at Clifton College, and St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a first in the modern and medieval languages tripos in 1940, having obtained a first in French and a second in German in part one in 1938. He then joined the Indian army (9th Jat regiment). He was captured in the Malay peninsula in 1942, and endured three years as a prisoner of war in Taiwan. In 1945 he married Anne Horatia, daughter of Oliffe Legh Richmond, professor of humanity in Edinburgh University. They had three daughters and a son.<br>
<br>After the war Piper moved into the museum world. He was given his first job, as assistant keeper in the National Portrait Gallery, in 1946, when G. M. Young, then a trustee, said, &#145;we must keep an eye on that young man; he will go far!&#146; They were prescient words. He became its director (1964&#150;7), director of the Fitzwilliam Museum and fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge (1967&#150;73), and director of the Ashmolean Museum and fellow of Worcester College, Oxford (1973&#150;85). He was Slade professor of fine art, Oxford (1966&#150;7), Clark lecturer, Cambridge (1977&#150;8), and Rede lecturer, Cambridge (1983). He was a member of the Royal Fine Arts Commission (1970&#150;86) and trustee of the Watts Gallery (1966&#150;88), and served on the Paul Mellon Foundation for British Art (1969&#150;70), the Pilgrim Trust (1973&#150;90), and the Leeds Castle Foundation (1981&#150;8). This is a formidable list for any man, especially one whose physical health was blighted by three years as a prisoner of war. He never spoke much about that experience, but survivors have described how he encouraged the camp inmates with his civilized acceptance of a particularly horrendous experience.<br>
<br>Piper's twenty-one years at the National Portrait Gallery were marked by the publication of a pioneering volume in the gallery's series of catalogues, <span class="italic">Seventeenth-Century Portraits</span> (1963), and by the initiation of the <span class="italic">Concise Catalogue</span>. The years were also remarkable for a number of exhibitions (Oliver Cromwell, William Shakespeare, and Elizabeth of Bohemia, the winter queen), and for some outstanding acquisitions, including portraits of John Milton and Edmond Halley, bought for &pound;24 and &pound;45. As a result, and because of his numerous broadcasts, lectures, and articles, the attendance figures rose to pass the quarter-million mark and the gallery became one of the attractions of London. And Piper found time to write two outstanding books: <span class="italic">The English Face</span> (1957 and twice republished) repays frequent rereading; <span class="italic">The Companion Guide to London</span> (1964) ran to several editions and has been judiciously compared to Richard Ford's <span class="italic">Spain</span> and E. M. Forster's <span class="italic">Alexandria</span>.<br>
<br>Piper left the National Portrait Gallery in 1967 to become director of the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, where he remained for six years, the highlights of which were the gift of Sir Hamilton Kerr's Mill House at Whittlesford, later to become the Hamilton Kerr Institute of Conservation of Works of Art, and Sir Robert Adeane's &pound;100,000, given to launch the extension appeal fund. Acquisitions included pictures by George Stubbs, John Constable, Paulus Morelse, Nicolas Poussin, Jan van Goyen, and Meindert Hobbema, and a remarkable wooden sculpture of a Japanese warrior of the Kamakura period. Piper's eye for quality helped to draw the public towards whichever museum he served at the time, and his reward at the Fitzwilliam was to see the attendance figures increase by a third in the space of three years, and enough money raised for the new extension.<br>
<br>In 1973 Piper became the first director of the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, having been appointed to bring in centralization and to keep the balance among the four departments. The new director's professional familiarity with the museum world greatly strengthened the Ashmolean, and his tactful handling of the many internal problems, arising in a difficult transitional period, endeared him to the museum staff. His departure in 1985 was marked by the acquisition of an &Eacute;tienne Aubry <span class="italic">Portrait of a Man</span>&#151;depicting an unknown Frenchman of the 1770s, whose genial smile and air of civilized self-doubt curiously enough suggest Pete Piper himself. Striking in appearance, slim and elegant, Piper was tall and lolloping as a young man, with large brown eyes. Latterly a scholarly stoop disguised his height. At all times his rather lugubrious face could suddenly be lit by an enormous and friendly smile.<br>
<br>Piper was a prolific writer and broadcaster. His articles in the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> and elsewhere drew attention to current exhibitions, books, and affairs in the art world. His own books include <span class="italic">Enjoying Paintings</span> (1964), <span class="italic">Shades: an Essay on Portrait Silhouettes</span> (1970), <span class="italic">London</span> (1971), <span class="italic">The Genius of British Painting</span> (1975), <span class="italic">The Treasures of Oxford</span> (1977), <span class="italic">Artists' London</span> (1982), and <span class="italic">The Image of the Poet</span> (1982). Among his novels (written as Peter Towry) were <span class="italic">It's Warm Inside</span> (1953), <span class="italic">Lord Minimus</span> (1955), a surprising account of Henrietta Maria's dwarf page, and <span class="italic">Trial by Battle</span> (1959).<br>
<br>He was appointed CBE in 1969, knighted in 1983, and made an honorary DLitt of Bristol University in 1984 and an honorary fellow of the Royal Academy in 1985. Piper died at his home, Overford Farm, Wytham, near Oxford, on 29 December 1990, after suffering for many years from severe emphysema, and was buried in Wytham cemetery. Lord Briggs and Sir Hugh Casson gave addresses at a memorial service in St Mary's, Oxford, in March 1991. He was survived by his wife and four children.<br>
