<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Murless, Sir  (Charles Francis) Noel</span>  (1910&#150;1987), <span class="occ">racehorse trainer</span>, was born on 24 March 1910 at Duckington Grange, Malpas, Cheshire, the elder son (there were no daughters) of Charles Herbert Murless, farmer, and his wife, Mary Constance, daughter of Frank Lloyd, auctioneer, of Wrexham, north Wales. Having ridden and hunted from early boyhood, Noel Murless was inspired to make a career in racing by seeing Poethlyn, owned by his parents' neighbour, Mrs Hugh Peel, win the Grand National in 1919.<br>
<br>For a short time Noel Murless, while performing the duties of a stable lad, rode in steeplechases and hurdle races with limited success, as an amateur and then as a professional, for Frank Hartigan, a trainer in Weyhill, Hampshire. On leaving Weyhill in 1930, Murless began a period of five years as assistant to Hartigan's brother Hubert, first at the Curragh, and then at Penrith in Cumberland. In July 1935 he commenced training at Hambleton Lodge, near Thirsk in the North Riding of Yorkshire, with five horses belonging to Lady Maureen Stanley, Dick Taylor, J. T. Rogers, and Andrew Johnstone. On 2 September 1935 he obtained his first success with J. T. Rogers's Rubin Wood in the Lee plate at Lanark. He had only one winner again in 1936, but in 1939 he won ten races.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Murless conducted a small stable at Middleham in Yorkshire, having been rejected by the forces because of injuries to his feet sustained in 1930. On 28 November 1940 he married Gwendolen Mary Lindsay, daughter of William Lindsay Carlow, coal exporter, of Craigend, Troon, Ayrshire; they had one daughter, Julia. After the war Murless came further to the fore, and in 1946 he was leading northern trainer with thirty-four races worth &pound;15,337 to his credit. He was leading northern trainer again in 1947, obtaining his first important success with Closeburn in the Stewards' Cup at Goodwood. Following the retirement of Fred Darling at the end of 1947, Murless was invited to succeed him in the powerful Beckhampton stable, near Calne in Wiltshire, on the recommendation of the stable jockey Gordon Richards, who had been greatly impressed by his always carrying his own saddle and other evidence of personal attention to detail. Patrons of the stable included George VI, J. A. Dewar, the whisky millionaire, Sir Percy Loraine, Major and Mrs Macdonald-Buchanan, and Colonel Giles Loder. In his first season at Beckhampton, Murless almost brought off the Newmarket classic double. The Cobbler was only beaten by a head in the Two Thousand Guineas, and Queenpot won the One Thousand Guineas. At the end of that season of 1948, Murless was champion trainer, having won sixty-three races worth &pound;66,542. In 1949 Major Macdonald-Buchanan's Abernant was beaten by a short head in the Two Thousand Guineas, but G. R. H. Smith's Ridgewood won the St Leger. The grey Abernant became an excellent sprinter, twice winning both the July Cup at Newmarket and the Nunthorpe stakes at York (1949 and 1950).<br>
<br>Having moved to the palatial Warren Place stable at Newmarket towards the end of 1952, Murless performed a remarkable feat by winning the Two Thousand Guineas and Derby of 1957 with Sir Victor Sassoon's Crepello, a heavy-topped colt with far from the best legs. In 1957 he also won the Oaks with Carrozza, leased by the queen from the National Stud, and thus became that year's champion trainer, having won races worth &pound;116,898. He was the first to amass a six-figure sum in a season. In 1959 he broke his own record by winning &pound;145,727, when Ali Khan's grey filly, Petite &Eacute;toile, won the One Thousand Guineas, Oaks, Sussex stakes, Yorkshire Oaks, and Champion stakes.<br>
<br>During 1960 Murless won the Derby and St Leger with Sir Victor Sassoon's St Paddy. Although another St Leger was won with Vera Lilley's ill-tempered Aurelius in 1961, and Murless was champion trainer for the third consecutive time, the season was marred by Sir Victor's Pinturischio being so badly nobbled while favourite for the Derby that he could never run again. A third record was broken in 1967, when Murless won sixty races worth &pound;256,899, including the Two Thousand Guineas and Derby with H. J. Joel's Royal Palace, and One Thousand Guineas with R. C. Boucher's Fleet. The King George VI and Queen Elizabeth stakes and the Eclipse stakes were won by Stanhope Joel's Busted, who had improved greatly since joining Murless from Ireland. When champion trainer again in 1968, Murless won the One Thousand Guineas with Caergwrle, bred and owned by his wife. Murless was champion trainer for the ninth and final time in 1973, obtaining the last of his nineteen classic successes with G. Pope's Mysterious in the Oaks. He retired at the end of 1976, and sold Warren Place to his son-in-law, Henry Cecil.<br>
<br>A tall, handsome man, with rather aquiline features and large brown eyes in a weather-beaten face, Murless had brown hair, which was silver in late middle age, brushed straight back from his forehead. He was impatient with people who sought information about horses with a view to making money, something to which he himself was almost indifferent. On the other hand, he would go to a great deal of trouble, not least with younger people, to help those anxious to increase their knowledge of the thoroughbred. Although he had no liking for the limelight, he had many close friends, mainly among owners and breeders, who found him a generous and amusing host. He was knighted in the silver jubilee honours in June 1977, and elected to the Jockey Club the following month. To a great extent his success was due to his inexhaustible patience and natural empathy with his horses, whose hallmark was a muscular robustness. To conserve nervous energy, he always kept them absolutely relaxed. On taking over Beckhampton, he gave orders that the horses' heads should be held by one rack chain, instead of three, while being dressed over, so that they could cope with irritation by flies.<br>
<br>Murless died on 9 May 1987 of emphysema and chronic bronchitis at his home, The Bungalow, Woodditton, Newmarket. His daughter Julia married Henry Cecil, the racehorse trainer, in 1966.<br>
