<span class="headword">Stewart,  Edith Helen  Vane-Tempest-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Edith Helen Chaplin]</span>, marchioness of Londonderry  (1878&#150;1959), <span class="occ">political hostess and writer</span>, was born on 3 December 1878 at Blankney House in Lincolnshire, the second of three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32363/', "Henry Chaplin, later first Viscount Chaplin (1840&#150;1923)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Florence Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (<i>d</i>. 1881), eldest daughter of the third duke of Sutherland. Edith Chaplin's mother died shortly after giving birth to her third child in 1881; thereafter, while her father concentrated on Conservative politics, Edith and her siblings were brought up by their uncle Lord Stafford and their maternal grandparents.<br>
<br>Edith Chaplin married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36627/', "Charles Stewart Henry Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh (1878&#150;1949)")</script>, on 28 November 1899 and gave birth to the first of five children in 1900. Although supportive of her husband's political career throughout her life, as a young woman Edith was a nervous public speaker and canvasser. As she said of herself: &#145;I was very shy and reluctant &hellip;, nothing except the cause of Woman Suffrage would have launched me off as a platform speaker&#146;  (Londonderry, <span class="italic">Retrospect</span>, 76). Indeed such were Edith's convictions on this topic that she flouted family disapproval by becoming an ardent constitutional suffragist, addressing meetings, writing pamphlets and letters to the press. More in line with her family's political stance, however, was her involvement in Conservative and Unionist politics. She served as president of the women's advisory committee of the Northern Counties National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations, and of North Down and Newtownards Women's Unionist Associations. She was also a vice-president of the Ulster Women's Unionist Council from 1919 to 1959.<br>
<br>The marchioness of Londonderry (as she became in 1915) was very involved in war work, serving from 1914 as colonel-in-chief of the Women's Volunteer Reserve. She resigned this position in 1915 to establish the women's legion, an organization designed to train women to release men for active service; initially providing cooks for the army, it developed administrative and clerical branches, and an agriculture section, in which she took particular interest. In 1934 Lady Londonderry initiated the merger between the women's legion and the other women's voluntary services, which in 1938 resulted in the formation of the Auxiliary Territorial Service, with which women served in the Second World War. Edith was appointed DBE (military division) for this work in 1917, the first woman to receive this honour.<br>
<br>In the inter-war period Lady Londonderry became a political hostess, entertaining many influential figures at the family estates of Mount Stewart, co. Down, Wynyard Park, co. Durham, and Londonderry House in Park Lane, London. In the latter Edith had established, during the war, the Ark, an exclusive weekly club which under her leadership developed into an important meeting-place for politicians, royalty, artists, and writers. Regulars adopted the names of animals, such as Arthur (Balfour) the Albatross, and so on; there was also Winston (Churchill) the Warlock while Lady Londonderry was Circe. From 1924, despite their different politics, she was a confidante of Ramsay MacDonald (Hamish the Hart in the Ark). This friendship became increasingly controversial in the early 1930s after MacDonald accepted leadership of the National Government in 1931 and appointed Edith's husband as secretary of state for air. Rumours abounded about the political influence which Edith exerted on MacDonald, and he was criticized, as a Labour politician, for making the aristocratic Londonderry House the social centre of his government. Further controversy was forthcoming in the late 1930s when Edith accompanied her husband on several trips to Nazi Germany in a well-meaning, though widely criticized, attempt to improve relations between the two countries. In addition to her work as a political hostess, Lady Londonderry wrote numerous articles, many alluding to the changes in women's position, and several books, including her autobiography, <span class="italic">Retrospect</span> (1938) and memoirs of her father, <span class="italic">Henry Chaplin</span> (1926), and her predecessor, Frances Anne, marchioness of Londonderry (1958).<br>
<br>Throughout her life Lady Londonderry was involved in public affairs and a myriad of charitable organizations, such as the Red Cross, the Queen's Institute of District Nurses (Northern Ireland), and the Personal Services League. She also served as chairman of the Ex-Servicewoman's Association, an organization which aimed to find suitable employment for demobilized women. She was one of seven women appointed to a government advisory committee to choose women magistrates in 1920 and later in this year she became the first female magistrate in co. Durham. From 1922 she also worked as a magistrate in co. Down. In 1922 she was asked by the Northern Ireland government to form the Ulster Women's Volunteer Association to enlist and train women to replace men in an emergency situation. In recognition of her work she was awarded an honorary doctorate in law from the Queen's University of Belfast in 1949.<br>
<br>Lord Londonderry died on 11 February 1949. Ten years later on 23 April 1959 Edith Londonderry died at the family estate of Mount Stewart in co. Down. She was buried beside her husband at the family's private burial site, Tir N'an Og, in the grounds of Mount Stewart. Edith Londonderry was widely recognized as the last great political hostess, possessing &#145;a perfect house, great personal popularity, untiring energy and a very deep-rooted interest in things political&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pall Mall and Globe</span>, 25 Oct 1925).<br>
