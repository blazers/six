<span class="headword">Prior,  Melton</span>  (1845&#150;1910), <span class="occ">artist reporter</span>, was born on 12 September 1845 in London, the son of William Henry Prior (1812&#150;1882), draughtsman and landscape painter, and his wife, Amelia. Educated at St Clement Danes Grammar School, London, where he attended art classes, and at Bl&eacute;riot College, Boulogne, France, he helped his father, and so developed his artistic ability. From 1868 he was one of the &#145;special artists&#146;, employed by the illustrated press, who preceded press photographers. They were sent to sketch newsworthy events; their sketches were worked on by the illustrated paper's studio artists and then engraved on wood or sometimes, from the 1880s, reproduced as photomechanical facsimiles. Prior worked throughout his career for the world's leading weekly illustrated paper, the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, which gained an extensive circulation and large profits for its proprietor, Sir William Ingram.<br>
<br>For five years Prior sketched events in Britain, then in 1873 Ingram sent him as a special war artist on Wolseley's Asante campaign. War artists were an &eacute;lite: their work was well paid, adventurous, and dangerous. Prior's success in the Second Anglo-Asante War brought him fame and established his career. For the following thirty years he worked primarily as a special war artist, on numerous wars including the 1874 Carlist War, Russo-Turkish War, 1878 Cape Frontier War, Anglo-Zulu War, Anglo-Transvaal War, 1882 Egyptian campaign, eastern Sudan campaigns, Gordon relief expedition, and pacification of Burma (1886&#150;7). From 1889 to 1892 he was in South America, sketching revolutions in Brazil, Argentina, and Venezuela. In 1895, invited by Barney Barnato, he went to Johannesburg and drew mine scenes. He then drew the Jameson raid and its aftermath, and the Matabele (Ndebele) uprising (1896). He went through the brief Graeco-Turkish War (1896), the Afridi campaign (1897) on the north-west frontier of India, and the Cretan rising (1898). In the South African War he witnessed the battle of Elandslaagte, was besieged with White's force in Ladysmith (November 1899 to February 1900), reported Roberts's advance to Pretoria, and returned to England in July 1900, &#145;the <i>doyen</i> of war artists&#146;  (<span class="italic">ILN</span>, 21 July 1900). In 1903 he was on the Somaliland campaign. In 1904 he went to draw the Russo-Japanese War, but the Japanese prevented reporters going to the front, which Prior bitterly resented: he wrote they were &#145;smiling, deceitful liars&#146;  (Prior, 335). Frustrated and disappointed, he returned to England.<br>
<br>Prior's war reporting had been interspersed with peaceful assignments overseas, including the visit to Athens by the prince of Wales in 1875 and the 1903 Delhi durbar. He went twice round the world, and travelled much in America. He claimed he had experienced twenty-six wars and had between 1873 and 1904 spent only one full year, 1883, at home. He did some work for <span class="italic">The Sketch</span>, also owned by Ingram. He occasionally fought in battle, was repeatedly under fire, and had, he claimed, numerous narrow escapes from death by shooting, spearing, drowning, or disease. Short (5 feet 6&frac12; inches), bald, and with a high-pitched voice and very shrill laugh, he was nicknamed &#145;the screeching billiard ball&#146;  (Furniss, 128). A member of the Savage Club, he was energetic, genial, convivial, &#145;a Rabelaisian humorist [with] a certain roughness of metaphor in his own speech&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>).<br>
<br>A competent but not great artist, Prior worked very quickly, usually in pencil or ink. His sketches were lively, pleasing, and often dramatic, with skilful use of chiaroscuro, and the published engravings were often inferior to the sketches. An imperialist, Prior identified with the British forces, especially their officers, and British settlers, and his portrayal of their enemies was unflattering. Well paid and with generous expenses&#151;Ingram called him the &#145;Illustrated Luxury&#146;  (Prior, 209)&#151;Prior travelled well provided with whisky and Moyer's tinned Irish stew. He repeatedly drew himself in action. Boosted by the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, he enjoyed his celebrity. He belonged to the adventurous, self-advertising school of war correspondents of whom Archibald Forbes was a leading figure. He was awarded foreign decorations and, like his colleagues, resented the War Office's refusal to award campaign medals to war correspondents. However, he wore the campaign ribbons to which he believed himself entitled.<br>
<br>Prior married in 1873 Mary, daughter of John Greeves, a surgeon. Except for accompanying him to Turkey in 1877, she stayed at home while he travelled, and reportedly his long absences contributed to the breakdown of the marriage. She was killed in 1907 in a tramway accident at Lewisham, London, where they lived. In 1908 Prior married Georgina Catherine, daughter of George MacIntosh Douglas; she survived him. He had no children from either marriage. In his last years Prior's health deteriorated, and he wrote his memoirs which&#151;edited, expurgated, and cut by about half by his <span class="italic">ILN</span> colleague S. L. Bensusan&#151;were published after his death. Following heart weakness, asthma, and in February 1910 a serious attack of pleurisy, he died at his home, 12A Carlyle Mansions, Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, on 2 November 1910, and was buried at Hither Green cemetery, London. A memorial tablet was placed in St Paul's Cathedral crypt.<br>
<br>Through his work in the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, Prior helped shape the Victorian public's perceptions of the empire and of war. His pictures remain useful historical sources and have been much reproduced, particularly in works of military history.<br>
