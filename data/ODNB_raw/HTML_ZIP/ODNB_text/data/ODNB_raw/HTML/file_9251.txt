<span class="headword">Feilding,  William</span>, first earl of Denbigh  (<em>c.</em>1587&#150;1643), <span class="occ">naval officer and courtier</span>, was the eldest of the three sons of Basil Feilding (<i>c</i>.1567&#150;1633) of Newnham Paddox in Warwickshire and Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Walter Aston of Tixall in Staffordshire. His date of birth is uncertain, but he is likely to have been at least sixteen years old when he entered Queens' College, Cambridge, as a fellow commoner on 1 July 1603. In 1606 he married Susan Villiers (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1655), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28292/', "Sir George Villiers")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28288/', "Villiers, Sir Edward")</script>] of Brooksby in Leicestershire, a union which produced four sons and four daughters. Their eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9249/', "Basil Feilding")</script>, was born in 1608. A dowry of &pound;2500 was paid to Feilding's father, a substantial but not inappropriate sum, as the Feildings were among Warwickshire's leading families. Feilding was knighted on 4 March 1607.<br>
<br>Feilding was a man of modest abilities, and since he did not inherit his father's estates until 1633 he would probably not have achieved distinction had it not been for the meteoric rise to royal favour of his brother-in-law, George Villiers, first duke of Buckingham. On 30 December 1620 Feilding was ennobled as Viscount Feilding, and on 11 January 1622 he obtained the mastership of the great wardrobe, which was worth about &pound;4000 per annum to its holder. Six months later he was appointed a gentleman of the bedchamber at Buckingham's behest, and on 14 September following he was created earl of Denbigh. His children also benefited from Buckingham's rise to power. In July 1619 Buckingham so arranged matters that Feilding's second son would inherit the Irish earldom of Desmond. Three years later, Buckingham had Feilding's eldest daughter, Mary, marry James, earl of Arran, the son and heir of the marquess of Hamilton.<br>
<br>Denbigh travelled to Spain in 1623 after Prince Charles and Buckingham journeyed in secret to Madrid. On the outbreak of war with Spain in 1625 Buckingham, as lord high admiral, gave Denbigh nominal command of a royal warship in the fleet under Sir Edward Cecil, but denied him command of a squadron since it was the duke's intention that Denbigh should spend his time aboard ship fitting himself for future naval service. However, when the fleet sailed on 8 October Denbigh was unexpectedly promoted to rear-admiral, as the vessel commanded by Sir Francis Steward sprang a leak and returned to port. His responsibilities were further increased upon arrival off Cadiz later that month, as he briefly assumed command of the entire fleet after Cecil went ashore, accompanied by his vice-admiral, the earl of Essex. Denbigh attracted little or none of the blame for the failure of the Cadiz expedition, and in August 1626 he was appointed vice-admiral of a second fleet under Robert Bertie, Lord Willoughby. The ships put to sea in October but the expedition had to be abandoned almost immediately as the ill-prepared fleet encountered severe storms in the Bay of Biscay. On his return to court he learned that his son-in-law, James, marquess of Hamilton, had refused to consummate his marriage to Mary Feilding and had returned to Scotland; Denbigh set off after him, but he had returned to Whitehall by mid-December, from which time, until the spring of 1627, he regularly sat on the commission for examining the reasons behind the failure of Willoughby's expedition.<br>
<br>Denbigh served as admiral of the 4th squadron in the disastrous &Icirc;le de R&eacute; expedition of 1627. On his return to England he was appointed to the permanent council of war (15 February 1628), but he took no part in its deliberations as he was placed in command of a fresh fleet which was ordered to relieve the Huguenots of La Rochelle. A severe shortage of mariners forced him to reduce the size of this fleet, which arrived off La Rochelle in early May. There he discovered that the harbour defences were so strong as to be impregnable, and he therefore returned to England having accomplished nothing, to the fury of Charles I. Denbigh subsequently helped to prepare a second expedition at Portsmouth, and would certainly have commanded one of the squadrons had the fleet's intended commander, Buckingham, not been murdered in August. In the event he declined to serve, possibly because the duke's replacement was Robert Bertie, now earl of Lindsey, with whom it was rumoured that Denbigh had quarrelled in 1626.<br>
<br>In 1629 Denbigh's conduct as master of the great wardrobe was criticized by royal commissioners, who discovered that he had been underspending on his assignments, and converting the cash saved to his own use. He had done nothing improper, however, as he was entitled to do this by the terms of his appointment, and was not therefore required to repay the sum of &pound;16,853 which he had kept for himself. New regulations laid down by the commissioners in April 1630 nevertheless forbade him from pocketing departmental savings in future, and to ensure that these were followed the clerk of the great wardrobe was appointed co-accountant with the master. Denbigh deeply resented this slight to his honour and in 1634 persuaded the commissioners to restore him to his previous position as sole accountant.<br>
<br>During his time as a naval commander Denbigh may have been seduced by tales of the Orient recounted by some of the captains who served under him, such as John Weddell, whose normal employment was with the East India Company. In August 1630 Denbigh obtained royal permission to tour India and Persia, and was given letters of introduction. He left England in January 1631 aboard an East Indiaman and the following November landed at Swally, from where he made his way to the court of the Mughal emperor. In 1632 he travelled to Persia, returning to England in August 1633 laden with jewels. As the first English nobleman ever to tour the Orient, he was proud of his visit and subsequently had his portrait painted by Van Dyck, who depicted him in semi-Indian costume attended by an Indian boy against a tropical background.<br>
<br>Early in 1635 it was rumoured that Denbigh would become ambassador to Constantinople, but his appointment was successfully opposed by the Levant Company, which noted his lack of mercantile experience. Despite his previous naval service, he seems never to have been offered a command in the ship-money fleets of 1635&#150;40. In February 1639 he promised to join the army which was gathering at York to fight the Scots, but if he attended he was not granted a commission. On the outbreak of civil war he was again denied a command of his own, but served as a volunteer in the king's lifeguard of horse. He saw action at Edgehill, and on 3 April 1643, as a cavalryman in Prince Rupert's troop, helped storm Birmingham, where he received severe injuries to the head and body. Though these began to heal, they were reopened by a fall in his coach, and he died intestate at Cannock in Staffordshire five days later. He was apparently buried at Monk's Kirby, close to his seat at Newnham Paddox. Letters of administration were granted to a creditor on 8 June 1651. Denbigh's widow died at Cologne about 1655.<br>
