<span class="headword">Shirley,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1366&#150;1456), <span class="occ">author, translator, and scribe</span>, is recorded in the early years of the fifteenth century in the service of Richard Beauchamp (<i>d</i>. 1439), who became earl of Warwick in 1401. In 1403 Shirley was in Warwick's retinue in the campaign against Owain Glyn D&#373;r; in 1414 he collected wages from the exchequer for Warwick's retinue in France (the first of a number of such missions) and is specified as the earl's secretary in 1420&#150;21. Warwick returned to England between 1428 and 1430 as tutor to Henry VI, from whom Shirley, as one of two recipients noted as being with the earl, received a new year's gift in 1428. In June 1428 Shirley and other members of the Beauchamp family and household were admitted together to confraternity of St Albans Abbey. On later occasions, often in connection with members of the Beauchamp household, Shirley is described as esquire of London. In 1432&#150;3 he was comptroller of petty customs in the port of London, and in 1436 he was recorded in the London subsidy as having an income of &pound;10 from lands in Hertfordshire. When Warwick and his wife both died in 1439, Shirley was still in their service. Shirley is mentioned in various legal and property transactions, noted as tenant of a house near St Bartholomew's Hospital from about 1438 in a document of 1444. In his will, dated 1 November 1452, Shirley asked to be buried in the lady chapel at St Bartholomew's, near his mother and first wife, Elizabeth. His second wife, Margaret, survived him. The will names executors, including John Wakering, master of St Bartholomew's Hospital (1423&#150;66), John Cok, priest and brother of St Bartholomew's, Richard Caudray, dean of St Martin's-le-Grand, and Edward Norys, citizen and scrivener of London. Shirley died on 21 October 1456 and was buried at St Bartholomew's Hospital. His epitaph was recorded by the Elizabethan antiquary John Stow, who later owned several manuscripts copied by or associated with Shirley.<br>
<br>Between about 1438 and his death Shirley also rented four shops from St Bartholomew's Hospital in Doke Lane and on the basis of manuscripts copied for him, or in his hand or clearly associable with him, some have speculated that Shirley ran a scriptorium, lending library, or some other sort of book business based in these properties. Shirley certainly both translated works from French and Latin and appears to have collected and annotated copies of contemporary vernacular authors, such as Chaucer and Lydgate, providing versified tables of contents and other commentaries to certain compilations. He received at least one set of verses from Richard Sellyng to correct. The surviving manuscripts associated with Shirley can be categorized in three groups: those in Shirley's own hand; those that passed through his hands and were annotated by him; and those apparently derived from manuscripts probably owned or annotated by him. Manuscripts copied by Shirley or containing substantial items in his hand: Cambridge, Trinity College, MS R.3.20; BL, Add. MS 16165, and Harley MS 78, folios 80<i>r</i>&#150;83<i>v</i>; London, Sion College, MS Arc. L.40.2/E.44; Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 59; San Marino, Huntington Library, MS EL 26.A.13. Manuscripts annotated by Shirley or containing his distinctive mark of ownership and motto, a crowned A with the words <i>ma ioye</i> or other mottoes: Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 61; Cambridge, Gonville and Caius College, MS 669*/646; CUL, MS Ff.1.33; BL, Royal MS 20 B.xv; LUL, MS 1; New Haven, Yale University Library, Osborn MS a 29; Tokyo, priv. coll. (&#145;Master of game&#146;). Manuscripts apparently or possibly derived in part from exemplars written or annotated by Shirley: Cambridge, Trinity College, MSS R.3.19 and R.3.21; Cambridge, Mass., Harvard University, Houghton Library, MS Eng 530; BL, Add. MSS 5467 and 34360, Cotton MS Titus A.xxvi, Harley MSS 2251 and 7333.<br>
