<span class="headword">Johnson,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1755, <em>d.</em> 1827), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and colonial chaplain</span>, was the son of John Johnson of Welton, Yorkshire, where he was baptized in March 1755. He was educated at the Kingston upon Hull grammar school and engaged in farming and teaching until he went up to Magdalene College, Cambridge, in January 1780. He gained his BA there in 1784. Made deacon by the bishop of Winchester on 21 December 1783, he was ordained priest by the bishop of Oxford on 31 October 1784. From 1784 to 1785 Johnson was curate of Bere, Hampshire. On 24 October 1786 he was appointed as &#145;chaplain to the settlement&#146; at New South Wales. His appointment was influenced by the Eclectic Society, of which John Newton and William Wilberforce were members.<br>
<br>An evangelical of great piety and a man of gentle character and inflexible integrity, Johnson was charged with a mission beyond the powers of most, because he was to be custodian of the morals of the infant settlement but he had also to conform to the pragmatism of Arthur Phillip, the first governor of New South Wales. Phillip's yardstick was survival. To the degree that religion and morality assisted that end he tolerated the role of Johnson.<br>
<br>Accompanied by his wife, whom he had married shortly before sailing, Johnson arrived with the first fleet and celebrated the first Anglican service under &#145;a great tree&#146; at Sydney Cove on 3 February 1788. He took as his text &#145;What shall I render unto the Lord for all His benefits toward me&#146;  (<span class="roman">Psalm 116</span>:12), which probably aroused a chill response in his convict hearers.<br>
<br>Johnson threw himself unsparingly into his daily tasks, whether celebrating divine service, catechizing, marrying, baptizing, burying, or attending frequent executions. To and fro, from Sydney to Parramatta he devoted himself to the spiritual and physical welfare of the convicts. He went down into the foetid holds of the &#145;sick ships&#146; of the Second Fleet, where hundreds lay dying or ill.<br>
<br>Francis Grose, acting governor following Phillip's departure, regarded Johnson as &#145;one of the people called Methodists &hellip; a very troublesome, discontented character&#146;  (Cable, 2.18) and obstructed his work in all possible ways. Grose was unable to prevent him erecting a pleasing but modest church in 1793, which Johnson paid for in rum. The church was burnt down in 1798. Johnson was the first to extend his apostolate to the Aboriginal people: he took an Aborigine into his own home and gave the first of his two children, a daughter born in 1790, the Aboriginal name Milbah. A son was born in 1792. His ecumenical spirit was such that when two Spanish vessels visited Sydney in 1793 he &#145;outdid himself in his sociable gestures, particularly toward our chaplain fathers approaching them with a kindness and humility and a simplicity that was truly evangelical&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Spanish at Port Jackson</span>, 30&#150;32). His main relief was farming, which he engaged in with considerable proficiency.<br>
<br>Johnson returned to Britain in 1800, leaving &#145;as a mere skeleton&#146;, said his successor Samuel Marsden. He served firstly as a curate in Essex and then as rector of the combined parishes of St Antholin and St John the Baptist in London. He was also the perpetual curate of Ingham, Norfolk, from 1817. His <span class="italic">An Address to the Inhabitants of the Colonies Established at New South Wales and Norfolk Island</span>, published in London in 1794, was an early item of Australian literature. He died in London on 13 March 1827, and was survived by his wife.<br>
