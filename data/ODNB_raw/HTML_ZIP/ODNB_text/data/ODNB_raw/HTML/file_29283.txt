<span class="headword">Whitefoord,  Charles</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1753), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the third son of Sir Adam Whitefoord, first baronet (<i>d</i>. 1727), and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1742), only daughter of Alan, seventh Lord Cathcart, and Elizabeth Dalrymple, daughter of James Dalrymple, first Viscount Stair. He entered the Royal Navy in 1718, but despite passing his lieutenant's examination he could not gain a commission. His cousin, John Dalrymple, second earl of Stair, seems to have been responsible for his education at the French academy of Angers and also for his entry into the army in 1720, possibly as a quartermaster in the Inniskilling dragoons.<br>
<br>In 1728 Whitefoord purchased an ensign's commission in the 31st foot commanded by his uncle, Charles Cathcart, later eighth Lord Cathcart. In 1729 he was appointed adjutant to Colonel William Blakeney commanding the regiment in Cathcart's absence. In 1733 he was promoted lieutenant and in 1737 captain. On 13 July 1738 he transferred to the Royal Irish regiment of foot stationed in Minorca. Here he became fat on &#145;three meals a day and no exercise&#146;, and &#145;I am become an Assembly man, play at quadrille with the ladies, go to Church on Sundays, but then I swear most intolerably the rest of the week&#146;  (<span class="italic">Whitefoord Papers</span>, 11). War with Spain saw him commissioned a captain in a marine regiment on 14 January 1740 and then on 4 April a major in the American regiment. In July 1740 he was made aide-de-camp to his uncle, now Lord Cathcart, the commander of all the British forces in America, who died in December 1740. Whitefoord joined the expedition against Carthagena in March and April 1741. He was promoted on 27 April 1741 to lieutenant-colonel of the 5th marines. Between July and November 1741 he served in Cuba. Upon his return to England he was stationed in Chatham, where by 1743 he had rented a house.<br>
<br>Whitefoord was in Edinburgh when the 1745 Jacobite rising broke out and immediately offered his services to Sir John Cope, spending much of his time trying to secure adequate supplies for the troops. At the battle of Prestonpans on 21 September 1745 Whitefoord gallantly maintained his position with the artillery after his gunners had fled, and was saved from death by Alexander Stewart of Invernahyle, a Jacobite officer. Whitefoord was sent as a prisoner to Perth and subsequently paroled. After Culloden he repaid the compliment to Stewart by appealing to the duke of Cumberland to spare the fugitive Stewart, who was eventually pardoned by the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span>. In later life Stewart related the story to Walter Scott, for whom it was &#145;one of those anecdotes which soften the features even of civil war &hellip; equally honourable to the memory of both parties&#146;  (Scott, introduction, 386), and became the basis for the &#145;mutual protection afforded by Waverley and Talbot to each other, upon which the whole plot depends&#146; (ibid.) in Scott's novel <span class="italic">Waverley</span>, Edward Waverley's role being based upon Whitefoord, and Talbot's upon Stewart.<br>
<br>Whitefoord was a key defence witness at Cope's court martial over the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle at Prestonpans, which led to the general's acquittal. Following disbandment in November 1748, he was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the 5th fusiliers in September 1751, stationed in Ireland. In November he succeeded as colonel of the regiment, but he died at Galway on 2 January 1753. He left a son, the diplomat <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29282/', "Caleb Whitefoord")</script>, and a daughter, Charlotte, both described in his will as his &#145;natural&#146; children  (BL, Add. MS 36596, fol. 345), which suggests that he never married. Caleb was left all his bonds, bills, and debts in order to pay legacies which included &pound;200 to Charlotte and &pound;500 to his &#145;worthy friend&#146;, Charles Schaw Cathcart, ninth Lord Cathcart.<br>
