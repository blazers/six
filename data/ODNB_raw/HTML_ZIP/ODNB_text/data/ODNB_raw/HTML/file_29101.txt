<span class="headword">West <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Daniel]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (1720?&#150;1779), <span class="occ">antiquary and writer</span>, was born in Inverness, probably on 1 January 1720. The identities of his parents are unknown. He received his early education &#145;in the public schools in Edinburgh&#146;  (<span class="italic">Antiquities</span>, 409). For some time he was &#145;a traveller in trade&#146;  (Oliver, 39), possibly travelling on the continent. It is uncertain when or why he changed his name to West. About 1749 he began divinity studies at the College of the English Jesuits at St Omer, and in September 1751 he entered the noviciate of the English province of the Jesuits at Watten; subsequently he studied at Li&egrave;ge. In October 1750, when he was apparently living in Deptford, he applied for membership of the Society of Antiquaries: he is described in the minute book as &#145;well skilled in several curious parts of antiquities&#146;  (Holt, &#145;Father Thomas West&#146;, 131). He was elected two years later. West was ordained as a priest on the continent about 1757. After returning to Britain, he may have spent time at Swynnerton, Staffordshire, and Holywell, Flintshire. After a further period on the continent he returned once more in 1765, and was appointed to Dalton in Furness, Lancashire. For about ten years he lived at Titeup Hall near Dalton; later he may have moved to Swarthmoor Hall near Ulverston, and to Ulverston itself. West was on friendly terms with Lord George Cavendish of Holker, to whom he dedicated his <span class="italic">Antiquities of Furness</span>; he spent much time at Sizergh, near Kendal, the seat of the Catholic Strickland family, and probably lived there in the last months of his life. His correspondents included his fellow Jesuit William Strickland, who lived at Alnwick in Northumberland, as well as other prominent antiquarians such as Thomas Pennant.<br>
<br>West's reputation as an antiquary rests chiefly on his <span class="italic">Antiquities of Furness</span>, first published in 1774, which is primarily concerned with the history of Furness Abbey. His <span class="italic">Guide to the Lakes</span>, which first appeared in 1778, was revised and enlarged for the second edition of 1780, with a distinctly patronizing preface by the editor William Cockin; the <span class="italic">Guide</span> reached its eleventh edition in 1821. Drawing freely on the work of previous writers, notably Thomas Gray, Thomas Pennant, and John Brown, and very much reflecting the contemporary interest in what West himself calls &#145;landscape studies&#146;, the <span class="italic">Guide</span> is nevertheless a work of considerable individuality, displaying a real sensitivity to the visual qualities of the district. The recommended &#145;stations&#146; for viewing the landscape were a significant innovation. The author's antiquarian passion and his curiosity about industrial activities are clearly evident. The <span class="italic">Guide</span> undoubtedly did much to popularize the district. West also published &#145;An account of a volcanic hill near Inverness&#146;, in <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>, 67 (1777), 385&#150;7, and &#145;Antiquities discovered in Lancaster, 1776&#146;, in <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, 5 (1779), 98&#150;100.<br>
<br>West died at Sizergh, Westmorland, on 10 July 1779, and was buried close to the Strickland family chapel in Kendal parish church. The editor of his <span class="italic">Antiquities</span>, William Close, remembered West in disappointingly conventional terms as &#145;a man revered for his piety, and the benevolence of his disposition, as much as for his learning&#146;  (<span class="italic">Antiquities</span>, 410).<br>
