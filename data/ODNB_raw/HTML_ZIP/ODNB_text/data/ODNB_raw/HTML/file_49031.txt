<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sassoon family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1830&#150;1961), <span class="occ">merchants</span>, came to commercial prominence with <a name="cosubject_48946"></a><span class="headword">David Sassoon</span>  (1792&#150;1864), a <span class="occ">Jewish merchant</span>. Born in Baghdad in October 1792, the son of Sason ben Saleh (1750&#150;1830) and Amam Gabbai, David belonged to a Sephardic family that, though originating in Spain, had prospered in Mesopotamia, and was active in both financial and religious affairs. David's father held the position of state treasurer to the governor of Baghdad for nearly forty years. The office carried with it automatic leadership of the Jewish community as well as tremendous commercial power.<br>
<br>David joined his father's business in Baghdad at an early age, after receiving a traditional Hebrew education and a counting-house apprenticeship. In 1818 he married Hannah (<i>d</i>. 1826), daughter of Abdullah Joseph of Baghdad, and they had two sons and two daughters. The eldest son, <a name="cosubject_24679"></a><span class="headword">Sir Abdullah David Sassoon</span>, first baronet  (1818&#150;1896)<span class="occ"></span>, was born in Baghdad; he was known later, particularly after his father's death, as Albert. His younger brother, <a name="cosubject_49031"></a><span class="headword">Elias David Sassoon</span>  (1820&#150;1880)<span class="occ"></span>, was born in Baghdad in 1820. Hannah died in 1826 and two years later David Sassoon married Farha Hyeem (1812&#150;1886), aged sixteen, the daughter of a Baghdad merchant; they had six sons and three daughters. At some point in the late 1820s, persecution of the Jewish community in Baghdad forced the family to flee. David was the first to leave, moving initially to Bushehr on the Persian Gulf before settling in Bombay. By 1832 he had been joined by his family and had begun trading from a small office at 9 Tamarind Street. He transferred later, as the firm grew, to larger premises in Forbes Street. He traded mainly with the Gulf ports, exchanging British cotton goods for commodities such as hides, silks, spices, and pearls.<br>
<br>As trade grew David embarked on an expansionist policy. At home the firm bought up wharfages in Bombay, aware that the new steamship service between Britain and India would drive up the value of such property. Overseas the opening up of five Chinese ports to foreign traders after the treaty of Nanking (Nanjing) in 1842 had a profound effect on the firm's fortunes. Located midway between Europe and China it was ideally placed to take immediate benefit, trading Lancashire textiles and Indian yarn and opium for Chinese goods. Cotton and opium were the two commodities on which the firm rose to prominence.<br>
<br>Although the firm's interests were spread across the world, it was David Sassoon's policy to keep the control of the business in his own hands and in those of his sons. In 1844 Elias, his second son, was sent to the Far East to supervise the firm's operations there. Branches were established in Shanghai (which after Bombay became the second centre of Sassoon activities), Canton (Guangzhou), Hong Kong, and Yokohama and Nagasaki in Japan.<br>
<br>In 1858 David sent his eldest son from his second marriage, Sassoon David Sassoon (1832&#150;1867), to establish the London office of David Sassoon &amp; Co. in Leadenhall Street in the City of London. This office played a central role in the boost to the Sassoon fortunes resulting from the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861. The war disrupted the supply of American cotton to Lancashire's mills, which turned to India as a replacement source. London became a main centre of the firm's operations and, as a consequence, branches were established in Liverpool and Manchester. From this time both the business and the family began to gravitate to England.<br>
<br>David Sassoon poured vast amounts of the fortune he acquired as a merchant into public benefactions; on his death he was one of Bombay's most energetic, wealthy, public-spirited, and benevolent citizens. He funded some of the most important cultural and civic institutions in Bombay: hospitals, libraries, museums, orphanages, and schools. He became a British subject in 1853, signing his naturalization certificate in Hebrew as he neither spoke nor wrote English. When he died in Poona on 7 November 1864 he was buried in the mausoleum in the courtyard of the synagogue which he had funded.<br>
<br>On joining David Sassoon &amp; Sons, Albert Sassoon was sent to Baghdad to re-establish the firm's trading links and to recruit staff for the various offices in China. In 1838, aged twenty, he married Hannah (<i>d</i>. 1895), daughter of Meyer Moses, a Baghdad merchant. They had three daughters and two sons. From Baghdad, Albert moved to China and then back to Bombay to assist his father in his last years. He became a partner in David Sassoon &amp; Sons in 1852 and took over the leadership on his father's death.<br>
<br>Under Albert's direction David Sassoon &amp; Sons rose to the peak of its prosperity, as one of India's most important businesses. Albert significantly extended the business from trade to industry by opening one of the first great textile mills in Bombay. Through his activities India became a manufacturing centre for cotton and woollen goods rather than an exporter of raw cotton to England for manufacture. Wool was imported from Australia to stimulate the woollen industry and the firm also established the Sassoon Spinning and Weaving Company and the Sassoon and Alliance Silk Manufactory Company.<br>
<br>Further diversification of the firm's interests took place when between 1872 and 1875 it constructed a wet dock at Bombay, the first on the west coast of India. Enormously successful in stimulating the commercial development of the port, it was bought four years later by the Bombay government. Trade also diversified overseas as the firm involved itself in the cultivation and export of Indian tea and the importation of sugar from Java, and the network of branches was extended into Singapore. Although Albert was later to become involved in the founding of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank (in 1865) and was a member of the board of the Imperial Bank of Persia (in 1889), the focus of the firm's activities remained overwhelmingly mercantile.<br>
<br>Albert's interests began to develop away from business. He became a leading member of the Bombay chamber of commerce, and served on the Bombay legislative council from 1867 to 1871. He became one of the governor's inner circle of advisers on educational and building projects. His commitment to civic affairs was recognized in 1867, when he was awarded the Order of the Star of India, and in 1872 on his retirement from the legislative council when he was awarded a knighthood. In 1873 Sir Albert visited England and was the first Indian and first Jew to receive the freedom of the City of London in recognition of his philanthropic work in both India and Britain. He became a member of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers.<br>
<br>In 1876 Sir Albert decided to move to London, which immediately became the focus of the firm's activities, with all major policy decisions and directives emanating from Leadenhall Street. Albert was a great success socially, becoming part of the aristocratic social circle that revolved around the prince of Wales, later Edward VII, whom he had entertained during the latter's state visit to India beginning in 1875. The triumph of his social career was his reception in London in 1889 for the shah of Persia, from whom he had already received the order of the Lion and the Sun. He settled at 25 Kensington Gore and bought a second mansion at 1 Eastern Terrace, Kemp Town, near Brighton. Links with the eminent banking family of Rothschild followed when in 1887 Edward Albert Sassoon (1856&#150;1912), Albert's only surviving son and heir, married Aline, the second daughter of Baron Gustave de Rothschild. On 22 March 1890 Albert was created baronet in recognition of his role in the industrialization of India. On 24 October 1896 Albert died at his home, 1 Eastern Terrace, Kemp Town, of a heart attack; he was buried in a private mausoleum next to his property. His son, Edward, succeeded to the chairmanship of the firm and to the baronetcy.<br>
<br>Sir Albert's younger brother, Elias David Sassoon, married Leah Gubbay (<i>d</i>. 1878) in 1840 and they had five sons and two daughters, one of whom, Hannah, married the financier Sir Sassoon Jacob David, first baronet. Their son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37342/', "Sir Percival Victor David Ezekiel David")</script>, achieved prominence as a collector of Chinese art. In 1844 Elias was sent to China to develop the firm's interests and within five years his firm enjoyed a secure footing along the entire China coast. Its trade was primarily in textiles and opium, but it also diversified into small-scale broking and banking activities. Elias joined Albert as a partner in the firm shortly after 1852.<br>
<br>On the death of their father in 1864 Elias saw himself as his brother's permanent deputy, but three years later he resigned from David Sassoon &amp; Sons. Taking his eldest son, Jacob (1844&#150;1916), into partnership, he established a rival firm, E. D. Sassoon &amp; Co., based in Bombay with offices in Shanghai, which carried on identical activities trading with the same centres as David Sassoon &amp; Sons. It was soon competing significantly in opium and Indian yarn and opened offices in Europe, Africa, and America, outstripping the original firm. The two houses remained separate and rivals. Elias died in 1880, aged fifty-nine, in Colombo, Ceylon, while visiting tea plantations, and the business passed into the hands of his sons Jacob, Edward (1853&#150;1924), Meyer (1855&#150;1924), and David (1866&#150;1938).<br>
<br>At the end of the nineteenth century the Sassoon family, pre-eminent in trading and aristocratic social circles, moved into politics when in 1899 Sir Edward, Albert's son, was elected Conservative MP for the Hythe constituency in Kent. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35952/', "Sir Philip Sassoon")</script>, Sir Edward's son, succeeded to the baronetcy, the chairmanship of David Sassoon &amp; Co., and the Hythe seat on his father's death in 1912. (Sir Philip's sister, Sybil, married in 1913 the earl of Rocksavage, heir of the marquess of Cholmondeley.) Sir Philip died in 1939 without an heir and his second cousin, Sir Victor Sassoon (1881&#150;1961), grandson of Elias David Sassoon, took over as head of the Sassoon family. Sir Victor was the nephew of Jacob and had become chairman of E. D. Sassoon &amp; Co. in 1924. He also became the third holder of the baronetcy to which Jacob had been elevated in 1909 for his civic and philanthropic activities. Sir Victor's death in 1961 ended both the second baronetcy and the last family connection with his companies in the direct male line. A later prominent member of the family was the poet and writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35953/', "Siegfried Sassoon (1886&#150;1967)")</script>, a grandson of Sassoon David Sassoon.<br>
