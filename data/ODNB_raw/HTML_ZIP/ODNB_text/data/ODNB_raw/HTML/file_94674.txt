<span class="headword">Abdul Razak bin Hussein, Tun</span>  (1922&#150;1976), <span class="occ">prime minister of Malaysia</span>, was born in Pulau Keladi in the state of Pahang (a Malay state then under British &#145;protection&#146;), on 11 March 1922. Descended from a line of Bugis chieftains who had emigrated from Sulawesi, he was the only child of Hussein bin Mohamed Taib, a Pahang chieftain and district officer, and his wife, Fatima binte Daud. He was educated at the Langgar Malay school in Pekan, Pahang; the Malay College, Kuala Kangsar, Perak; and (after joining the Malay administrative service in 1939) Raffles College, Singapore. While he continued in state administration during the Japanese occupation (1942&#150;5), early in 1945 he embarked on clandestine collaboration with Wataniah, Pahang's Malay resistance force. After the Second World War he studied law at Lincoln's Inn in London, where he was called to the bar in 1950. It was during his student days in London that he became interested in politics, especially socialism; he joined the Fabian Society and the Labour Party as well as the Malay Society and the interracial Malayan Forum.<br>
<br>On his return to Malaya in 1950 Razak entered the Malayan civil service. He was appointed Pahang's state secretary in 1952 and three years later <i>mentri besar</i> (chief minister) of Pahang. While holding these administrative positions he was elected leader of the youth wing of the leading Malay political party, the United Malays National Organization. When the founder of the party, Dato Onn bin Jaafar, was forced out of it for proposing that its membership be opened to non-Malays, Razak was elected deputy president after persuading Tunku Abdul Rahman (known as the Tunku) to be elected president. In 1952 he married Toh Puan Rahah; they had five sons and adopted three daughters.<br>
<br>In August 1955, after the multiracial Alliance led by the Tunku had won fifty-one of the fifty-two federal seats contested in national elections, Razak was appointed the country's first minister of education. He was the architect of the controversial education report of 1955, which recommended a national curriculum for the country's primary and secondary schools in which Malay was made a compulsory subject of study alongside English. This created among non-Malay citizens an image of him as an ardent Malay nationalist, although later he continued to uphold the Tunku's policy of multilingualism. In 1956 he was a key figure in the Alliance's delegation to London for talks with the British government, which led to Malaya's independence the following year. After independence he became the Tunku's deputy as well as his minister of defence. Two years later he was given an additional portfolio, as minister for national and rural development. During his ten years in this latter post more than 80,000 acres of virgin jungle were opened up for Malay agricultural settlement and farming, and a massive infrastructure of roads and other developments in the rural areas was built. For his outstanding contribution to rural development in Malaysia, the Philippines awarded him the Magsaysay award in 1967. He had already, in 1959, been awarded the Seri Maharaja Mangku Negara, one of Malaya's highest honours, carrying the foretitle Tun.<br>
<br>Following general elections, communal tensions erupted into nationwide violence in May 1969. The liberal-minded Tunku initially carried on for a while as head of an emergency cabinet, but then virtually handed over the administration to Razak as director of the national operations council, whose powers superseded the cabinet. This took place after the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (paramount ruler) had proclaimed a national emergency and suspended the Malaysian parliament and all state legislatures. Razak's loyalty to the Tunku despite the latter's weakening position in government led him to remove Mahathir Mohamed from the United Malays National Organization for attempting to oust the premier, though Mahathir, who retired temporarily into the political wilderness, emerged some years later to serve Razak as minister of education. After the national operations council had re-established law and order throughout the nation, Razak pursued a Malay nationalist agenda of political reform, the council issuing decrees to reaffirm Malay sovereignty and prohibit further challenges to Malay privilege. He began introducing Malay as a medium of instruction in schools in stages, and to use it widely as the official language in place of English.<br>
<br>On 22 September 1970 the Tunku left office and Razak succeeded him as prime minister. In February 1971 parliament and the state legislative assemblies were reconvened. Razak began to change the Tunku's anti-communist, pro-West foreign policy to non-alignment, in pursuit of which he recognized communist China in 1974. Parliament approved his new economic policy, aimed at restructuring the economy to overcome the social and economic disparity between Malays and non-Malays and to redistribute 30 per cent of the country's wealth to Malays through affirmative action in the public and private sectors within the next twenty years. This became the basis of the second Malaysia five-year development plan that was implemented in 1971, under which the state intervened to offer Malays thousands of jobs, credit, business licences, and government contracts within the framework of largely non-Malay economic growth and increased activity by foreign-owned companies. Razak next formed the National Front or Barisan Nasional to replace the ruling Alliance by including several opposition parties. With this virtual removal of opposition to the government, student bodies on campuses began to articulate dissent and hold demonstrations to protest against a variety of issues throughout 1974. They were forcibly put down, and the <span class="roman">Universities and University College Acts</span> were introduced to curb political activities at institutions of higher learning. Meeting little opposition, the National Front won the 1974 general elections.<br>
<br>Having suffered from leukaemia for several years, Razak died on 14 January 1976 at a clinic in London, where he had gone for treatment. His body was flown back to Malaysia and buried at the Heroes' Mausoleum in the National Mosque, Kuala Lumpur. His deputy, Tun Hussein Onn, who was also his brother-in-law, succeeded him as prime minister. Razak's achievements led him to be called Malaysia's <i>bapa pembangunan</i>, or &#145;father of development&#146;. When he died, his affirmative action policies had begun to succeed in producing dramatic social changes and in boosting Malay confidence. Although an ardent Malay nationalist, he succeeded in forming a national unity government including opposition politicians of the left, right, and centre. He was a firm believer in the integrity of government, and cracked down hard on corruption. His son Tun Najib Razak became deputy prime minister of Malaysia in 2004.<br>
