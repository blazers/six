</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lorimer,  James</span>  (1818&#150;1890), <span class="occ">jurist</span>, was born at Aberdalgie, Perthshire, on 4 November 1818, the son of James Lorimer (1779&#150;1868), factor of the earl of Kinnoul, and Janet Webster (1776&#150;1866). Initially educated at home, he briefly entered Perth grammar school, before matriculating with his only brother, Thomas W. Lorimer, in the University of Edinburgh in 1834. After a year of study, he was apprenticed to a merchant in Glasgow with the ultimate intention that he should pursue a career in India. Thomas was apprenticed to a writer in Perth. A breakdown in James's health in Glasgow resulted in his return to Aberdalgie to recuperate. In 1837 he resumed study in Edinburgh, completing the regular curriculum in 1840. The greatest influence on him was the class in moral philosophy of Sir William Hamilton, who combined a critical reading of Kantianism with the Scottish philosophy of common sense.<br>
<br>Recurrence of the asthma that was to plague Lorimer all his life led to his going abroad to study in September 1840. He travelled first to Geneva where he remained until September 1841, attending classes in natural sciences at the Academy, before embarking on a tour of Italy and Germany. He next intended to study law in Berlin. After an interview with the great scholar F. C. von Savigny which left Lorimer embarrassed as he had not appreciated the importance of the professor to whom he had been given a letter of introduction, he spent the winter of 1841&#150;2 learning German, and started classes in the spring, studying Roman law with G. F. Puchta, chemistry with E. Mitscherlich, and legal philosophy with Adolf Trendlenburg. Of the three Lorimer considered that the most influential on him were the lectures in chemistry. He spent the summer session of 1843 at the University of Bonn, attending F. C. Dahlmann's lectures on politics and history, and G. Kinkel's on art history. He returned home to Scotland in the autumn to matriculate as a law student in the University of Edinburgh. After two sessions, on 8 March 1845, he was admitted to the faculty of advocates. He intended his membership of the faculty to help him pursue an essentially literary career. He was active in the Speculative Society. The patronage of Lord Kinnoul secured him the sinecure post of lyon clerk in 1848: a deputy carried out the duties.<br>
<br>With a weak voice and continuing poor health, Lorimer had only a slight practice at the bar, and, although he sometimes acted as sheriff substitute of Midlothian, he devoted his energies to a variety of other interests such as <span class="italic">Chambers's Encyclopaedia</span>. From the late 1840s and early 1850s he started to write in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of Agriculture</span>, the <span class="italic">North British Review</span>, and the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>. Putting his legal knowledge to use he wrote a <span class="italic">Handbook of the Law of Scotland</span>. Aimed at the general public, and first published in 1859, this reached a sixth edition in 1894. Lorimer's interest in constitutional reform led to <span class="italic">Political Progress not Necessarily Democratic</span> in 1857 and <span class="italic">Constitutionalism of the Future</span> in 1865. He favoured complex voting systems in which individuals would have votes linked to various qualifications. He corresponded on these issues with a number of individuals including J. S. Mill, whose work on representative government he discussed in the <span class="italic">North British Review</span> (November 1861). By 1851 he felt sufficiently secure in his literary career to marry and on 22 December that year he married Hannah (1835&#150;1916), daughter of John Riddel Stodart, writer to the signet, and Jemima Henrietta Brown. The couple had three sons and three daughters, the most noted of whom were the artist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67596/', "John Henry Lorimer RSA")</script> and the architect <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34600/', "Robert Stodart Lorimer ARSA (1864&#150;1929)")</script>. One important fruit of Lorimer's literary labours was his election as a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1861.<br>
<br>In the 1850s the agitation for reform of the Scottish universities that had existed since the royal commission in the 1820s culminated in the <span class="roman">Universities (Scotland) Act</span> of 1858. Having first written on the need for reform in the <span class="italic">North British Review</span> in 1850, Lorimer played a notable part as secretary of the Association for the Extension of the Scottish Universities which he founded in 1853. He also served on the committee of the faculty of advocates that proposed radical new requirements for admission in 1854. Lorimer was critical of the existing Scottish universities as being merely an extension of high school. He considered they should be centres of teaching and original research that promoted the creation of an educated professional &eacute;lite which could lead the country. The influence of what R. D. Anderson has called &#145;the neo-humanist ideal of the German universities&#146;  (Anderson, 60) is evident in this. Lorimer most clearly expounded these views in <span class="italic">The Universities of Scotland, Past, Present, and Possible</span> in 1854, and in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> in 1858.<br>
<br>Owing much to Lorimer, reform of the faculties of law favoured a broad liberal approach to legal education. The regius chair of public law and the law of nature and nations in the University of Edinburgh was accordingly revived in 1862 with Lorimer appointed to it through the influence of Sir George Cornewall Lewis. Here Lorimer found his m&eacute;tier and exerted a profound influence, even if he was perhaps not the best of teachers. His class started with an account of the law of nature, and then moved on to public international law and next to private international law. His account of the last was much influenced by F. C. von Savigny. It was Lorimer's practice to begin each year with a special lecture on some topic of current interest, and many of these lectures, which were often separately published at the time as pamphlets or in periodicals and sometimes reported in the Edinburgh newspapers, were collected and published posthumously in 1890 as <span class="italic">Studies National and International</span>.<br>
<br>The first part of Lorimer's course resulted in his <span class="italic">Institutes of Natural Law</span> in 1872. This reached a second edition in 1880 and was reprinted in Germany in 1987. Rejecting the historical school and the legal positivism and utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham and John Austin no less than he rejected the Kantian categorical imperative, Lorimer, following the German Karl C. F. Krause, founded law scientifically in certain universal facts of human nature. He emphasized the autonomy of the individual, by which he meant that one was able to find within oneself the rules of nature that had to be obeyed. In this he showed the influence, as well as of Krause, of his old teacher Adolf Trendlenburg, who also had emphasized that one should view one's ethical life as the result of one's nature as a whole. This led Lorimer to reject any distinction between ethics and law. Moreover, this view of Trendlenburg, reinforced by a reading of Spinoza, led Lorimer to the view that every natural thing had as much right by nature as it had power to enforce. This <i>de facto</i> principle led him to the view that there was a natural right to aggression. While to some extent undoubtedly influenced through Hamilton by the Scottish school of common sense, Lorimer in reality developed a complex system of natural law derived from contemporary German <i>Naturrecht</i>, but rejecting a foundation of natural law in mind or reason. Natural law realized in time or place was &#145;positive law&#146;, by which Lorimer meant (rather than the common meaning) the idealized law best suited to the society. It was the duty of legislators and judges to turn this positive law into enacted law.<br>
<br>Lorimer's account of public international law was founded on these views of natural law, and thus differed radically from that of many of his contemporaries in Britain. He was therefore roundly criticized by the English positivists. Sir Frederick Pollock in particular made a notable attack on his mode of theorizing. For Lorimer, international law was the branch of positive law (in his special sense) by which the freedom of different nations was realized through the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of their real powers. Lorimer thus applied to states his views of the autonomy of individuals, with a similar justification of aggression. Though criticized for cloudy abstractions, Lorimer in fact put considerable intellectual effort into thinking out the institutions necessary for a system of international law. He proposed their creation through an international treaty under which there would be a proportional reduction of national armed forces which would preserve the balance of power but leave money in states' hands to fund an international government with legislative, judicial, executive, and financial powers. Authority to make decisions was to be weighted in favour of the great powers, since they would have to implement them. This aspect of his teaching was published in two volumes in 1883&#150;4 as <span class="italic">Institutes of the law of nations: a treatise of the jural relations of separate political communities</span>.<br>
<br>Lorimer continued to campaign energetically for the further improvement of the Scottish universities and legal education. His active public presence alone achieved much in this respect, especially for his own university and faculty. This ultimately has proved to be of more lasting importance than his scholarly contributions. While his attempt to work out an institutional structure for international law still arouses interest, his theories of natural law and his approach to national and international law are superseded. His <i>de facto</i> principle would now be rejected, as would his right of aggression and his often explicitly racist opinions that some societies are progressive and others degenerative.<br>
<br>Though Lorimer was awarded the honorary degree of LLD by the University of Glasgow (where, before the institution of a public law lectureship, he had lectured for several summers) in 1882, he generally achieved a greater reputation in continental Europe than in the United Kingdom. He was awarded another honorary doctorate by the University of Bologna in its anniversary year of 1888, while an abridged version of his work on international law&#151;translated into French by Lorimer's close associate the Belgian professor E. Nys&#151;was published in Brussels in 1885. This French version was translated into Spanish by A. L. Lopez Coterilla and published in Madrid in 1888. In 1890 Nys published a translation in abridgement of Lorimer's work on natural law. With Nys, Lorimer was one of the founders of the Institute of International Law in 1873, devoting considerable time to its activities, and through it he became acquainted with many scholars of similar interests in other European countries. He was also honoured by appointments as corresponding member of the Academy of Jurisprudence of Madrid, honorary member of the imperial universities of St Petersburg and Moscow, and member of the Royal Academy of Belgium.<br>
<br>For the sake of his always precarious health, Lorimer preferred to spend his summers outside Edinburgh. On his father's death in 1868 he inherited the small estate of Kellyfield near Dundee. This was too far for him to use regularly in the summers and in 1878 he leased Kellie Castle in Fife, devoting many years to its restoration. He died at his home, 1 Bruntsfield Crescent, Edinburgh, of pleurisy and pneumonia on 13 February 1890.<br>
