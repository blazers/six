<span class="headword">Fairclough, Sir  John Whitaker</span>  (1930&#150;2003), <span class="occ">computer engineer and public servant</span>, was born at South View, Carlton Road, Carlton Miniott, near Thirsk, Yorkshire, on 23 August 1930, the son of Harold Whitaker Fairclough, a commercial traveller, and his wife, Elsinora, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Chappell. He was educated at Thirsk grammar school and Manchester University, from where he graduated BSc in electrical engineering. After a spell of national service as an RAF radar technician, in 1954 he joined Ferranti, the Manchester-based electronics company. On 4 September that year, he married Margaret Ann Harvey, a 26-year-old clerk, and daughter of Herbert Eldon Harvey, inspector of metal products. They had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Fairclough joined Ferranti at a pioneering phase in computing technology, when the company was attempting to market the first commercial computers in the UK&#151;indeed in the world. One of the first production-line Ferranti computers was the Pegasus, on which Fairclough worked designing memory modules. In 1955 he was sent to New York to help Ferranti market these machines in America. The Pegasus became a well-regarded workhorse among the British computing fraternity (still at that time only a handful of people), but it was not a commercial success and Ferranti sold only about forty machines. British efforts to establish an internationally competitive computer industry foundered after the 1950s, when American companies&#151;with their large domestic customer base and their lavish government support&#151;captured the emerging computer market both in the USA and overseas. Chief among these American companies was IBM, which became the computer industry leader.<br>
<br>In 1957 Fairclough saw better prospects in the USA and accepted a post at IBM's Poughkeepsie laboratory in upstate New York. The following year he transferred to IBM's UK subsidiary as director of development at the company's newly established Hursley laboratory near Winchester. There he set up and managed the development of a small computer, codenamed SCAMP (scientific computer and modulator processor). Fairclough's work led to an important innovation: the development of the control store, a specialized memory which contains the micro-instructions that are essential to execute all the programs on a computer. Control stores became fundamental to the development of IBM's landmark System/360 series of computers&#151;a range of compatible machines, adaptable to a wide variety of uses&#151;that allowed IBM to leapfrog its competitors and set the industry standard in the mainframe business. The design work of Fairclough and his team was crucial in the development of the first of this series, the model 40, which was shipped in 1965.<br>
<br>In 1968 Fairclough was appointed assistant general manager and director of data processing at IBM UK and was given responsibility for sales. However, he did not find this work congenial. Two years later he transferred to IBM's Raleigh development laboratory in the USA as director&#151;a unique position within the American computer industry for an Englishman. He helped pioneer &#145;distributed&#146; computing, which enabled office workers to communicate through networks. In 1974 he returned to Hursley as managing director, with his position as a visionary computer technologist well established. In 1983, as director of manufacturing and development and chairman of IBM UK Laboratories Ltd, he was given charge not only of IBM UK's research and development, but also its manufacturing facilities (and some 6500 workers) at Havant and Greenock.<br>
<br>In 1986 Fairclough's career changed direction. He was seconded from IBM to the Cabinet Office as chief scientific adviser to the government of Margaret Thatcher. It was unusual for an executive from industry to occupy this post, but it reflected the prime minister's view that an entrepreneurial input was needed to reinvigorate Britain's research efforts, especially where state funding was involved. Fairclough's job was to advise on how to maximize the return from government spending on science and technology. He agreed with the government's view that there had been a failure to capitalize on British excellence, and he looked with dismay on the way in which, as he perceived it, universities could often garner support regardless of the usefulness of their work. One tangible result of his ideas was the creation in 1987 of the Advisory Council on Science and Technology, which reported to him in his capacity as cabinet adviser.<br>
<br>By 1988 Fairclough had set out the broad principles that were to underlie his policy on public expenditure on research and development (R&amp;D). Essentially he believed that funding should be directed to work that was furthest from the development of a marketable product or process. Thus so-called &#145;near-market&#146; R&amp;D was to be left to industry, with government expenditure confined to areas where the market could not be relied upon to produce maximum benefits to the economy as a whole. In other words, the government should withdraw from commissioning and funding research from which industry gained direct benefit. This decision led to the termination of most government support for civil near-market and single-company R&amp;D, with an exception made for the aerospace industry. In 1989 Fairclough also restated the customer&#150;contractor principle, with the aim of encouraging development of an internal market in which public sector research providers would compete for public funds for R&amp;D. This increasing emphasis on value for money in the use of resources by government departments for research was, unsurprisingly, not universally applauded&#151;especially by those who found their funding cut or withdrawn. But Fairclough did encourage &#145;interdisciplinary research centres&#146; on university campuses as a focus for academic and business resources.<br>
<br>In 1990 Fairclough relinquished his appointment as chief scientific adviser and was knighted. In that year he joined the bankers N. M. Rothschild as chairman of their venture capital arm, Rothschild Ventures Ltd. He was involved in several business start-ups and was also a non-executive director of Psion, Oxford Instruments, and Lucas Industries, among others. He was involved with Prince Charles's Innovation Initiative and the British Computer Society, and accepted several honorary degrees. Between 1991 and 1996 he was chairman of the Engineering Council and launched an initiative that aimed to unite Britain's diverse and numerous engineering institutions under one umbrella body. This was unsuccessful: the only result was a senate, which had little authority or support.<br>
<br>Fairclough's first wife died in 1996; on 1 May 2000, he married Karen Jefferson, formerly known as Karen Burrington, a 56-year-old personal assistant, and daughter of James Oswald Morgan, commercial clerk. In 2002 the government again turned to Fairclough to investigate research&#151;this time in the construction industry. His report restated some familiar Fairclough themes: a commitment to government support for research, but an emphasis on the need for industry to take greater responsibility for defining and funding research and wholly to fund shorter-term knowledge transfer. Again the report was controversial, and many industrialists expressed some dissatisfaction with its findings. Fairclough died on 5 June 2003 at his home, 3 Clockhouse Close, Wimbledon, from a brain tumour. He was survived by his second wife, Karen, and the three children of his first marriage.<br>
