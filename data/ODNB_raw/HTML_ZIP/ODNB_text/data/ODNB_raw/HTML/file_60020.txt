<span class="headword">Williamson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bras]</span>,  Isabel</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1430, <em>d.</em> in or after 1493), <span class="occ">merchant and burgess of Edinburgh</span>, was probably the daughter of Simon Bras of Edinburgh (<i>fl</i>. 1467). She became one of the most prominent female merchants in late medieval Scotland, with a name so well known in mercantile circles that when her son John (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1505) first appeared in the treasurer's accounts in 1474, he was referred to as &#145;Isabel Williamson's son&#146;. Isabel's husband, Thomas Williamson, was a leading figure in Edinburgh trade in the 1450s; her own mercantile career flourished after Thomas died, between about 1464 and 1473, probably during the time John was being trained in the family business. Thomas had built up a successful concern trading with Flanders, presumably with Isabel's help, as she showed herself so proficient in continuing it. The importance of a known reputation is shown by the fact that in her mercantile affairs Isabel called herself by her husband's name rather than by her maiden name, as was common practice in medieval Scottish society. Instead of turning the business over to John, Isabel carried on trading until the 1490s, though in the 1480s she began to work more in partnership with her son, who became a burgess and member of the Edinburgh merchant guild in 1487. Both John and his son, also John, became distinguished members of Edinburgh society.<br>
<br>Isabel specialized in importing fine goods from the continent, for which she exported wool in exchange. In the 1470s she was an active supplier to the royal household, in particular providing luxury cloths and textiles, including velvet and satin, for the king and queen, the nursery, and important household servants. In the 1490s her son John continued supplying the royal household. Isabel's trading activities involved her in transactions with prominent people throughout Scotland, such as the bishops of Glasgow and Aberdeen. By 1493 she had acquired the lands of Mortonhall, near Edinburgh, although her possession was disputed by the countess of Caithness. Isabel appeared several times before the lords of council, both defending and prosecuting her interests.<br>
<br>Isabel Williamson was devoted to the Edinburgh parish church of St Giles. She endowed the altar of St Laurence from her properties in Edinburgh in 1489 and reserved the right of patronage to herself. This is the one record in which she uses her maiden name of Bras, perhaps because it concerned religious rather than business matters. She was probably buried there when she died in or after October 1493, leaving a wealthy inheritance and a trusted family name to her descendants.<br>
