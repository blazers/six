<span class="headword">Agnew, Sir  William Gladstone</span>  (1898&#150;1960), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born in London on 2 December 1898, the fifth son of the six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71778/', "(Charles) Morland Agnew (1855&#150;1931)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65633/', "Agnew family")</script>], art dealer, and his wife, Evelyn Mary (<i>d</i>. 1932), daughter of William Naylor, of Paddington Green, London. He was the grandson of Sir William Agnew, first baronet. He joined the Royal Navy in September 1911 and was at Dartmouth when war broke out in 1914. He was sent to sea as a midshipman, serving in the battleships <i>Glory</i> and <i>Royal Oak</i> and in the destroyer <i>Skilful</i>. After the war his appointments included the royal yacht and in 1924 he went to the <i>Excellent</i>, the gunnery school at Portsmouth, to qualify as a specialist in gunnery. During these years he played rugby football regularly for the navy as well as cricket, hockey, and tennis. On 24 April 1930 he married Patricia Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1977), younger daughter of Colonel Alfred William Bewley CMG of Campanella, Alverstoke, Hampshire. They had no children.<br>
<br>Agnew's first ship as a specialist officer was the cruiser <i>Durban</i> and in 1931 he was appointed gunnery officer of the battleship <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>, flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet. He was promoted commander in 1932 and captain in 1937.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in 1939 Agnew was given command of the armed merchant cruiser <i>Corfu</i> and in October 1940 was transferred to the cruiser <i>Aurora</i>. Over the next year and a half Agnew's name and that of his ship were to become famous as part of the &#145;short but brilliant career&#146; of force K  (Roskill, 173). After the <i>Aurora</i> had a share in the sinking of a German cruiser, a destroyer, and two supply ships, in the summer of 1941, Agnew was sent to the Mediterranean as the senior officer of a group consisting of the <i>Aurora</i>, her sister ship the <i>Penelope</i>, and the destroyers <i>Lance</i> and <i>Lively</i>&#151;force K. This move was quickly justified. On the night of 8 November force K intercepted a strongly escorted enemy supply convoy of seven ships bound for north Africa. Agnew had made carefully thought-out plans for just such an encounter and had discussed his tactics in detail with the other commanding officers. As a result he was able to stalk the convoy undetected and took the enemy completely by surprise. All the supply ships and one of their escorting destroyers were sunk without damage to force K. As he left his ship on return to harbour Agnew was spontaneously cheered by the officers and men of the <i>Penelope</i>&#151;a rare tribute. A great leader, he was also remembered by colleagues for his friendly and modest manner. For his services in this action he was appointed CB in 1941.<br>
<br>Further sorties by force K led to the sinking of three fuel tankers. All these successes created a critical fuel situation for the German air force in north Africa and had an important effect on axis plans. In December the <i>Aurora</i> struck a mine but Agnew got her safely back to England after temporary repairs in Malta. Although force K was not reformed, at the end of 1942 the <i>Aurora</i> formed part of the naval force in operation Torch, the allied invasion of north Africa, and from then on was constantly in action. It was a tribute to Agnew and the <i>Aurora</i> that the ship was chosen to carry George VI from Tripoli to Malta for the royal visit to the island in June 1943. For this service the king appointed Agnew CVO.<br>
<br>The <i>Aurora</i> played a full part in the allied invasions of Italy and Sicily, carrying out a great many bombardments in support of the landings. In October, however, she was severely damaged in an air attack in the eastern Mediterranean. Agnew took his damaged ship into Alexandria and was ordered home to take command of the <i>Excellent</i>. He had been appointed DSO in April 1943 and subsequently received a bar (1944).<br>
<br>After the war, in March 1946, Agnew was appointed to command the battleship <i>Vanguard</i>. He was promoted rear-admiral in January 1947 and remained in command for the royal visit to South Africa. On conclusion of the tour he was promoted KCVO. In August 1947 Agnew was appointed director of personal services at the Admiralty, where he remained until October 1949. He notably complained while in this position that the developing welfare state in Britain made life in the services less attractive. Civilian life had become &#145;a free and easy Tom Tiddler's ground on which he (i.e. the sailor) would be advised to stake a claim at the earliest possible moment&#146;  (Grove, 45). In January 1950 he retired from the navy at his own request, and later in the year was promoted to vice-admiral on the retired list.<br>
<br>For the next three years Agnew was the general secretary of the National Playing Fields Association and re-established this organization after its hiatus during the war. He became involved in local government and the Christian stewardship campaign in his local parish. He died at his home, Glentinion, Palmerston Way, Alverstoke, Gosport, Hampshire, on 12 July 1960. His funeral was held at Alverstoke on 16 July.<br>
