<span class="headword">Blitheman,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1525&#150;1591), <span class="occ">composer</span>, is of unknown origins and parentage; the principal manuscripts of his music suggest he was born about 1525. Until 1980 works of reference, following Hawkins, usually gave his forename as William. This is indeed the form of his name in the Fitzwilliam virginal book, but other musical sources give the surname only. There is no doubt, however, that the composer of organ and vocal sacred music is identical with the John Blytheman who appears as a gentleman of the Chapel Royal in documents dating from 13 December 1558 (the burial of Queen Mary) until 1590, and it seems certain that he is also to be identified with the John Blytheman (variously spelt) whose presence at Christ Church, Oxford, is recorded in 1555&#150;6 and at various times from December 1560 until 1578 (from 1563 as head of the lay clerks). The arrangements made for his service in the choir of Christ Church from 1560 onwards allow for his possible absence for extended periods, as would be expected of a member of the Chapel Royal. One further documentary reference is more doubtful. A John Blitheman was paid for a single quarter of the year 1548&#150;9 as a junior vicar-choral of the cathedral of Wells, in which city there occur several contemporary references to a Bartholomew Blitheman, perhaps a kinsman.<br>
<br>Much of Blitheman's surviving music is for the Latin liturgy and would have been written during the reign of Queen Mary. His six organ compositions on the plainsong <span class="italic">Gloria tibi trinitas</span>, whether or not they were intended to serve a liturgical purpose, provide a demonstration of various techniques for setting a plainsong <i>cantus firmus</i>. His keyboard music survives mainly in the Mulliner book, copied by Thomas Mulliner. There are also two vocal compositions in the Gyffard partbooks  (BL, Add. MSS 17802&#150;17805), of which the compline responsory <span class="italic">In pace</span> is a particularly well-knit specimen of contrapuntal writing in the mid-Tudor style.<br>
<br>Blitheman died on 23 May (Whitsunday) 1591 and was buried at the parish church of St Nicholas Olave, London. His epitaph, recorded by Stow, describes him as an organist and teacher of John Bull. His will, made on 25 December 1590 and proved on 25 May 1591, includes bequests to his pupil John Bull, to his sister Elizabeth Taylor, widow, in Newcastle upon Tyne, to his sister Robinson, and to Robert Blytheman, vicar of Walgrave, near Henley-on-Thames. Monetary bequests total &pound;49.<br>
