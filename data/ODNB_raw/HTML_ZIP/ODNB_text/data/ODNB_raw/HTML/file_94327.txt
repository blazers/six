<span class="headword">Geldray,  Max</span>  (1916&#150;2004), <span class="occ">harmonica player</span>, was born Max Leon van Gelder in Amsterdam on 12 February 1916, the first child of Leon van Gelder, commercial traveller, and his wife, Margarite, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Baillosterky. His father was a hard-working perfume salesman for a Spanish company, but political upheavals caused his earnings to fluctuate wildly. The young Geldray took piano lessons, but he became inspired when, at the age of sixteen, he was introduced to the chromatic harmonica, where the notes could be raised by the push of a button. He created a band of like-minded youngsters and an agent branded them &#145;Mac Geldray and his Mouth-Accordion Band&#146;, which the newly named Geldray changed to Max. In 1936 he and three musicians toured the UK as the Hollander Boys. He returned to the continent and played in a restaurant in Brussels, joined a dance band in The Hague, and secured a residency at the Ostend casino with its A-list clientele. In 1937 he joined Ray Ventura's band in Paris. He played with the guitarist Django Reinhardt, but with the outbreak of the Second World War, and being Jewish, he felt there would be greater security in England. In 1940 he joined the Princess Irene brigade, part of the Dutch army in exile. He often entertained troops, and played at Princess Elizabeth's sixteenth birthday concert at Windsor Castle. On 18 January 1943 he married Sarah Prentice, a 26-year-old Scottish variety artiste known as Zaza Peters, and daughter of Thomas Prentice. On active service Geldray was caught in a bomb blast during the Normandy landing, and although he survived without lasting injuries he suffered nightmares for many years. In 1945 he returned to Amsterdam and discovered that his parents and his sister, Xaviere, had been killed by the Nazis. With his life at a low ebb he returned to Ray Ventura's orchestra in Paris, and then on to London.<br>
<br>In 1951 Geldray joined the cast of a new BBC radio series, <span class="italic">Crazy People</span>, which became <span class="italic">The Goon Show</span> a year later [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95276', "Goons")</script>]. Spike Milligan, Peter Sellers, and Harry Secombe had served during the war and loved to mock authority. Geldray was a comic butt as well as a musical performer. He was regularly and affectionately insulted, being called Conk because of his large nose. In one episode Milligan said that Geldray could only play the harmonica if he was torpedoed, naturally a cue for sound effects; and in &#145;Drums along the Mersey&#146; (1957) Geldray was sold to the highest bidder. The musical interludes came from Geldray and the Ray Ellington Quartet, and Geldray's &#145;Crazy Rhythm&#146; was the play-out music. In 1957 Geldray released an EP record of jazz standards, <span class="italic">Goon with the Wind</span>, which was produced by George Martin. The Goons were loyal to Geldray and in 1958, when a cost-cutting BBC proposed to drop him, Sellers said he would not participate if they did, and Geldray remained. The attempts to put the Goons on television were never satisfactory as their appeal relied on comic imagination, but Geldray appeared in <span class="italic">The Idiot Weekly Price 2d</span>, <span class="italic">A Show Called Fred</span>, and <span class="italic">Son of Fred</span>, all dating from the mid-1950s.<br>
<br>In 1961 Geldray entertained passengers on the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>. He was impressed by Los Angeles and, following the collapse of both his marriage and a subsequent relationship, he decided to emigrate. He worked with Sarah Vaughan and Billy Daniels and often played casinos in Reno, Nevada. In 1962 he met and married a divorcee, Susan Deforio, and settled with her and her children, Judy, Holly, and Timmy. Together they had a son, Philip. Geldray sold clothes in a department store and then worked as the regional sales supervisor for the <span class="italic">Christian Science Monitor</span>. He returned briefly to the UK in 1972 for <span class="italic">The Last Goon Show of All</span>, which was commissioned to celebrate the BBC's fiftieth anniversary. For all the razzmatazz, the show was hampered by a weak script and overshadowed by <span class="italic">Monty Python's Flying Circus</span>, which had been so influenced by the Goons. Princess Margaret came backstage at <span class="italic">The Last Goon Show of All</span> and asked to be introduced to Geldray, as she admired his talent.<br>
<br>In 1973 Geldray moved to Palm Springs to look after his wife's father, and played jazz in a local bar. Timmy died after a long illness and following this Geldray's wife required treatment at the Betty Ford Centre. Geldray, a very compassionate man, talked to patients and started volunteer work, establishing a patient group, the Blow Hards. He recorded an album, <span class="italic">Father G and Dr B</span>, with his son-in-law Roger Blomquist on alto saxophone, for the New Horizons Crisis Centre in Utah. He enjoyed being a grandparent to Philip's children. He died in Palm Springs, California, on 2 October 2004, and was survived by his wife, Susan, his son, Philip, and his stepdaughters, Judy and Holly. He was a very good jazz musician and it is unfortunate that he recorded so little. As it stands, he will be remembered mainly for the gentle ribbing of the Goons.<br>
