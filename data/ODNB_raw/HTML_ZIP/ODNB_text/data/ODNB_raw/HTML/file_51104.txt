<span class="headword">Green,  Aaron Levy</span>  (1821&#150;1883), <span class="occ">rabbi</span>, was born in Middlesex Street (popularly known as Petticoat Lane), Aldgate, London, in August 1821, the youngest of the eight children of Levy Ephraim Green (1784&#150;1858), a local tradesman, and his wife, Amelia Hyams (1779&#150;1854). He was educated at the <span class="roman">Talmud Torah</span> section of the Jews' Free School in Bell Lane, Spitalfields. He became a leading member of the generation of English-born preachers who transformed the profession of a Jewish minister from that of a mere servant of the congregation and reader of services, spoken entirely in Hebrew, to that of a leader of the congregation, whose sabbath sermons in English became an integral part of public worship.<br>
<br>A precocious pupil, Green had a fine voice, and at the age of fourteen was permitted to conduct a service in the Great Synagogue, Duke's Place, London. In May 1838, three months before his seventeenth birthday, he was appointed minister to the Bristol community. On 31 July 1844 he married Phoebe Levy, a native of Bristol, who cried throughout the ceremony&#151;occasioned, it was later discovered, not by emotion but by an oncoming attack of measles. They had seven sons and five daughters, all of whom survived him. Though a great success at Bristol, he felt that his talent required greater scope, and in 1851 applied for and secured the post of second reader at the Great Synagogue, Duke's Place. He remained there until his appointment in June 1854 to the prestigious post of reader and preacher at the newly established West End branch of the Great Synagogue in Great Portland Street, where he served for the remainder of his life. It was a wealthy congregation, and there was scarcely a communal institution, charitable or educational, whose honorary officers did not belong to the synagogue, and he acted as almoner for many of their charitable donations.<br>
<br>In addition to his ministerial duties Green threw himself wholeheartedly into the work of communal institutions involved in education, religious culture, and the state of the Jewish poor. A supporter of the establishment of Jews' College, he served as its honorary secretary from 1859 until his death. His library of about 6000 books, his most cherished possession, was donated to the college after his death and formed the nucleus around which the library expanded. He was an instigator of the industrial department and visitation committee of the Jewish Board of Guardians, a founder of the Jewish Association for the Diffusion of Religious Knowledge, a member of the council of the Anglo-Jewish Association, and was on the committee of the Mansion House Relief Fund. His firm friendship with Professor David Marks of the Reform synagogue smoothed away many of the differences that divided the Orthodox from the Reformers.<br>
<br>A brilliant columnist, Green's impressive contributions to the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span> under the pseudonym Nemo were widely discussed and particularly influential. Though he could be impatient with those slower of thought, and particularly those slower of action, and sometimes showed it, by 1870 he had established himself as a figure of outstanding authority in the community. Though his formal education ended before he was seventeen, he never ceased to be a student. He devoted his nights mostly to the study of Jewish learning, and once a month stayed up all night to review his studies of the previous four weeks.<br>
<br>Green died unexpectedly on 11 March 1883 at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, and was buried three days later at Willesden Jewish cemetery in a grave adjacent to the one he had consecrated on the morning of his death.<br>
