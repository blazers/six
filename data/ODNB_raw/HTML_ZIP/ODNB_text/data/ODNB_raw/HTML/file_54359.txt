<span class="headword">Campbell,  James Duncan</span>  (1833&#150;1907), <span class="occ">customs official</span>, was born on 9 February 1833 at 7 Warriston Crescent, Edinburgh, the first child of Major Robert Campbell (1799&#150;1874), of Craignish, Argyll, an officer in the 46th regiment, and his first wife, Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Baillie (<i>d</i>. 1870). After studying at Cheltenham College (from Easter 1844 to October 1850), at Boulogne, and at university in Paris (1851&#150;2) and Heidelberg (1853) Campbell worked briefly at his uncle's firm in Calcutta from 1853 to 1854. After his uncle's death, the then somewhat aimless young man returned to Britain contemplating the army and the Indian Civil Service as careers. Eventually, however, he joined the British Civil Service, where he spent six years in the Treasury and Audit Office from 1856 to 1862. Campbell was by now seen as something of a high-flyer, and was appointed secretary to the chief of the Treasury; he was also a prominent member of the volunteer movement, and musketry-inspector to the Civil Service Volunteers.<br>
<br>The Treasury's rising star was poached by the nascent Chinese maritime customs service in 1862. This service was born in the chaos of the Taiping uprising in China (1850&#150;65), at a time when the breakdown of effective Chinese administration in Shanghai threatened to undo the system of Sino-foreign trade and diplomacy founded on the treaty of Nanjing (1842). Foreign inspectors were appointed to oversee the collection of customs dues from foreign traders for the Chinese authorities. This &#145;Shanghai system&#146; grew into a national service which, despite being an arm of the Chinese state, was controlled and staffed by foreign personnel. In this way China used foreign experts to mediate with foreign traders, and&#151;effectively&#151;to lobby and negotiate for China in the new world of state-to-state diplomacy that Chinese officials were entering after the mid-century wars with Britain and France. The service became in time the prime revenue-collection service of the Chinese state and the security on which foreign loans were raised. Its first inspector-general, Horatio Nelson Lay, was appointed in May 1859 to establish the service at all treaty ports, and Campbell was appointed by Lay as chief secretary and auditor; he sailed for China in March 1863.<br>
<br>Lay's was, however, a false start for the service, and it was effectively refounded after his dismissal in November 1863, by a firmer hand. Ulsterman Sir Robert Hart (1835&#150;1911) had been Lay's deputy since 1860, and he took over the service and controlled it until his death. Lay was arrogant, and attempted to assume powers well beyond those acceptable to the Chinese. Hart was an altogether smoother figure; although he ruled the service like an autocrat he subordinated himself properly to Chinese control. Campbell had been taken on to help establish an accounting system for the service but after 1870 he found himself mostly based in Britain on various missions, and Hart decided that it would be more useful to have him formally based in London as non-resident secretary from 1873 onwards.<br>
<br>If the Chinese maritime customs service developed around the figure of Hart in Peking (Beijing)&#151;and Hart became a dominant and dominating figure in Sino-British relations&#151;it would certainly have been a very different organization without the effort and dedication of Campbell in London. Campbell was a hard-working man of solidly fixed habits, who in later life looked very much like&#151;and was often taken for&#151;Lord Salisbury. He established the London office in 1874&#151;which was funded by quarterly subventions from the customs administration in Peking&#151;and it became the nursery for some of the service's finest recruits. It also served as the examination centre for the service, as its supply department, and as an information bureau. The London office, at 8 Storey's Gate, also facilitated the visit of Chinese embassies, such as that of Guo Songtao in 1877&#150;8, and at times rivalled the Chinese legation as the arm of the Chinese government in London. However, Hart was always careful to make sure that Campbell remained his own private representative and that he acquired no official diplomatic office (such as a consulship). Campbell also negotiated with Jules Ferry the 1885 peace treaty which ended the Franco&#150;Chinese War of 1884&#150;5, and the Sino&#150;Portuguese commercial treaty of 1887, the &#145;protocol of Lisbon&#146;, which fixed the status of Macau. More importantly, in many ways he was Robert Hart's personal fixer in London. His duties ranged from negotiating with the Foreign Office on behalf of the service, to supplying Hart with new shoes and suits, violin music, and instruments for the brass band he formed in Peking to provide entertainment at soir&eacute;es, or disbursing handouts to Hart's &#145;wards&#146;&#151;the three children of Sir Robert's liaison with a Chinese woman, Ayaou, who were educated and then worked in Britain before emigrating to Canada. Campbell became best-known not for his own contribution to the activities of the customs service, but rather for his absence from China and as Sir Robert Hart's London muse and London agent. Though the two men met in person only two or three times their correspondence was full and vigorous, lasting from 1868 to 1907 and affording an invaluable guide to the life and thoughts of that important and enigmatic figure, Hart, and also to the development of the service.<br>
<br>Campbell had married in Brighton, on 22 September 1870, Ellen Mary Lewis, daughter of T. R. Lewis, and they had five sons and two daughters. He never revisited China after 1870 and never met Hart after 1878. Campbell's eldest son, James Baillie Campbell, joined the service&#151;its administrative ethos and structures were well-oiled by nepotism&#151;but he died of typhoid in Peking in 1892 within a year of arriving in China. That year provided a further blow when Campbell lost some &pound;80,000 in the Colman and May collapse. The customs service aside, the main preoccupation of Campbell's later years was attempting to prove himself the rightful heir to the Craignish succession.<br>
<br>Campbell died at his home, 18 Clanricarde Gardens, Hyde Park, London, on 3 December 1907, following complications after a bowel operation, and was buried on 6 December in Kensal Green cemetery, London. Hart lasted little longer in China and in 1908 left for England, where he died three years later. Campbell was much honoured over the years&#151;as CMG (1885), as commander of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur and of the Portuguese order of the Conception, and as a member of the imperial order of the Double Dragon&#151;but Hart stole all the glory for the successes of the customs service, as was his wont. Campbell deserves much credit, however, for his contributions to the development of one of China's most important and influential modern institutions.<br>
