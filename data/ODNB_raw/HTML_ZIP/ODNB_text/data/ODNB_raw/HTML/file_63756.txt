<span class="headword">Egerton,  Henry</span>  (1689&#150;1746), <span class="occ">bishop of Hereford</span>, was born on 10 February 1689 at Ashridge, near Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire, the Egerton family seat. He was the third surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8589/', "John Egerton, third earl of Bridgewater (1646&#150;1701)")</script>, who held high office in William III's reign, and his second wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Paulet (1655&#150;1716), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21613/', "Charles Paulet, first duke of Bolton")</script>. He attended Eton College from 1706 to 1707, but then entered New College, Oxford, from which he matriculated on 31 March 1707. Unusually for a future cleric, he studied civil law at Oxford: he graduated BCL in February 1712 and DCL in July 1717.<br>
<br>Egerton was ordained deacon on 12 December 1712 in Christ Church, Oxford, and subsequently priested. In 1713 he was instituted into two family benefices of Dunnington and Settrington, both in Yorkshire. In 1716 he became canon of Christ Church, and three years later hoped to be dean there, but in vain. He resigned his Yorkshire benefices in 1720, and, in exchange, was instituted into two other family livings, Whitchurch and Myddle, this time in north Shropshire in Lichfield and Coventry diocese. On 18 December 1720 he married Lady Elizabeth Ariana Bentinck (<i>d</i>. 1764), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2160/', "Hans Willem Bentinck, first earl of Portland (1649&#150;1709)")</script>, formerly confidant of William III, and his second wife, Jane Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Temple (1672&#150;1751). They had five sons and one daughter. Under her father's will Lady Elizabeth was due to inherit &pound;10,000 from his Dutch or English estates, but in 1727, owing to her half-sisters' claims, Egerton had to settle on his wife's behalf, it seems grudgingly, for &pound;4000.<br>
<br>Egerton was now well connected in whig circles, and not only through his own marriage. His brother Scroop, made first duke of Bridgewater in 1720, was a lord of the bedchamber to George I from 1719 to 1727. Furthermore, Egerton had himself become deputy to the clerk of the closet in 1719. In a shuffle of bishoprics in 1723 Edmund Gibson, bishop of London and Robert Walpole's chief ecclesiastical adviser, proposed him for the see of Hereford in succession to Benjamin Hoadly. Duly nominated, Egerton was consecrated at Lambeth Palace on 2 February 1724. He was reportedly unwilling to resign his Christ Church canonry, but none the less did so promptly. He was able to retain the Shropshire livings, holding them <i>in commendam</i> with the bishopric until his death.<br>
<br>From the outset Egerton was the subject of tory gossip and vilification. At his appointment to Hereford the Jacobite Thomas Hearne disparagingly described him as &#145;a nobleman of New College &hellip; he is young and hath no learning&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks and Collections of Thomas Hearne</span>, 8.171). When, on 30 January 1727, Egerton preached before the Lords a sermon anti-Jacobite in tone, Hearne characterized it unfavourably as &#145;a most stupid thing, surely nothing can hardly be worse&#146;  (ibid., 9.284). Another tory, William Stratford, canon of Christ Church, told Edward Harley of a revealing confrontation between the bishop and the driver of a loaded cart. When the carter refused to give way to Egerton &#145;the bishop was dormant in him and the nobleman alert and dominant&#146;. He swore at the carter &#145;like a dragoon and bruised the poor fellow with the butt of his whip&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 7.380). Egerton offered two guineas in compensation, but the carter through an attorney demanded one hundred and went to court. The result of the case is unknown. In Stratford's eyes, the hazard of a public trial was not enough for Egerton to overcome his love of money. Unfortunately few other personal views of Egerton exist. He was certainly very much a courtier&#150;politician. Following his period as the clerk of the closet's deputy, he became clerk of the closet himself from 1737 until his death, and he attended parliament on average forty-one days a year, far more than any other Hereford bishop since 1660.<br>
<br>Few records of Egerton's work in the diocese survive, yet it is notable that, though he ordained only once a year, he nearly always did so in the cathedral, and never in London like some contemporaries; evidence shows he also carried out visitations. He ensured diocesan administration continued efficiently under, for instance, his former Eton friend, the poet Samuel Croxall, archdeacon of Shropshire from 1732 to 1738 and later chancellor of the cathedral from 1738 until his death in 1752. When in London, Egerton was frequently in touch with Croxall especially during the long acrimonious dispute over jurisdiction with the new dean of Hereford, John Harris, also bishop of Llandaff. In another altercation the Society of Antiquaries severely criticized Egerton for destroying the eleventh-century bishop's chapel between 1737 and 1746. Unique in Great Britain, it was a Rhineland-style double chapel, dedicated to Sts Katherine and Mary Magdalene.<br>
<br>Egerton died on 1 April 1746 at his house in St James's Place, Westminster, probably from tuberculosis, the scourge of the Egertons&#151;it had carried away his brother Scroop in 1744, and weakened his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8584/', "Francis Egerton, third duke of Bridgewater")</script> and future internationally renowned canal-builder. Egerton was buried in the chancel at St James's, Westminster (now Piccadilly), on 5 April 1746 and was survived by his wife and three sons, one of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8590/', "John Egerton (1721&#150;1787)")</script>, was bishop of Durham from 1771 to 1787. He was staunchly whig and anti-Jacobite. His frequent attendance in the Lords, his residence mostly in Westminster and sometimes in Whitchurch outside his diocese, his natural financial acquisitiveness, and his accretion of ecclesiastical benefices fit him more easily into the archetypal mould of an eighteenth-century courtier&#150;prelate than any of his post-Restoration predecessors or indeed his more aristocratic successor, James Beauclerk. Perhaps not an admirable figure, he nevertheless made sure the diocese was run efficiently during his episcopate.<br>
