<span class="headword">Delaune,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Guillaume  de Laune]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1530&#150;1611), <span class="occ">Reformed minister and physician</span>, was born at &#145;Bellenewell&#146;, near Dieppe, but little else is known about his background. In 1582 he said that he was aged fifty-two. He studied medicine for eight years at Paris and Montpellier, under Duretus and Rondelet. About 1558, having completed his medical training, he became a Reformed minister, most probably at Montpellier, combining this with the practice of medicine. He married Katherine des Loges (<i>d</i>. 1607) from Rouen, probably the daughter of a fellow minister, M. des Loges (<i>d</i>. 1570), at Uz&egrave;s. In 1564 or 1565 their first son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7449/', "Gideon Delaune (1564/5&#150;1659)")</script>, was born at N&icirc;mes; Isaac, Peter, Nathaniel, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7450/', "Paul Delaune (c.1585&#150;1655?)")</script>, Sara, Ester, and Elizabeth were born subsequently.<br>
<br>Delaune initially served the churches of G&eacute;n&eacute;rac and Beauvoisin in Lower Languedoc. On des Loges's death, Delaune took responsibility for his family, and in 1570 asked to be relieved of his church due to his extreme poverty. He seems to have returned to Normandy, where he may have had property, but in the wake of the St Bartholomew's day massacre (1572) took refuge in England, initially at Rye where he served as a minister. By 1575 he had moved to London, where he became an assistant minister in the French church. He also had contacts with Cambridge, corresponding with the professor of divinity, Peter Baro, but, with the support of the French church, continued to practise medicine and as a result was summoned to appear before the College of Physicians in December 1582. He petitioned the college for permission to continue to practise as he depended upon it for his livelihood; the college agreed and he was made a licentiate. The following year he asked for permission to be released from his preaching duties in order to concentrate on medicine.<br>
<br>However, Delaune continued to be involved in religious matters. In 1583 he published an abridged version of Calvin's <span class="italic">Institutes</span>, entitled <span class="italic">Institutionis Christianae religionis a Joannes Calvins conscriptae epistome</span>; a second edition was published in 1584 and an English translation in 1585. He also retained his links with the continent. In 1599 he arranged for his son Nathaniel to be sponsored in his studies for the ministry by the Reformed church in Dieppe. Delaune died in London early in 1611; he was buried on 19 February at St Anne Blackfriars beside his wife, who had predeceased him.<br>
