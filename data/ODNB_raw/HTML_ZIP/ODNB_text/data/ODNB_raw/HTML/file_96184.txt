<span class="headword">Macgregor <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>McPherson]</span>,  (Janet) Elizabeth <span class="st"> [Betty]</span></span>  (1920&#150;2005), <span class="occ">cytologist</span>, was born at 11 Lynedoch Place, Glasgow, on 12 January 1920, the daughter of Andrew McPherson (1884&#150;1946), company secretary, and his wife, Jean (Jennie), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Craig (1886&#150;1929). She had an elder brother, Andrew (1917&#150;1940), later an RAF pilot who was awarded the first DFC of the Second World War, in 1939, and two younger sisters, Agnes Jean (1922&#150;2005) and Margaret (1924&#150;1984). When she was nine years old her mother died of tuberculosis. The family lived in Glasgow where she attended Bearsden Academy and then studied medicine during the Second World War. She qualified in 1943, after which she served in the Royal Army Medical Corps, reaching the rank of captain. She and her future husband, Alastair Goold Macgregor (1919&#150;1972), met as medical students. They married at the University memorial chapel, Glasgow, on 13 October 1944, and their four children were born between 1946 and 1953. After working in both Edinburgh and Sheffield they moved to Aberdeen, where Alastair Macgregor was appointed regius professor of materia medica in 1958 and Betty (as she was known to friends and family) became a research assistant to Sir Dugald Baird, professor of midwifery, in the department of obstetrics and gynaecology. She was awarded the degree of MD with honours in 1963 and later became senior lecturer and consultant in the department of pathology.<br>
<br>In Aberdeen, Betty Macgregor initiated, as early as 1960, and then managed and evaluated, the first successful population-based cervical cancer screening programme in the UK. Working with the wholehearted support and collaboration of Sir Dugald Baird, she was motivated by what she had seen of the clinical manifestations of this devastating disease, which most often affected women in their forties at a vital stage of life when they were bringing up their children. Macgregor and Baird, in an article in the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> in 1963, said that &#145;cervical cytology has now passed beyond the experimental stage&#146; and that cervical cancer could largely be prevented by cytological detection and treatment of a pre-invasive stage  (J. E. Macgregor and D. Baird, &#145;Detection of cervical carcinoma in the general population&#146;, <span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 22 June 1963, 1631). She kept meticulous records of her practice and, having the courage of her convictions, combined research with action. In the absence of computers she and her colleagues kept records in books and card indexes. Clinical and screening histories were coded on punch cards and sorted with knitting needles. But Macgregor did not spend all her time in the laboratory and applied a holistic approach to her work. She talked to and gradually won round general practitioners, convincing them that their patients should be screened. She visited women in their homes, giving balloons to the children to occupy them while she took their mothers' smears. She paid a great deal of attention to cytology training and quality control. Importantly, she collaborated with epidemiologists and statisticians to evaluate the effectiveness of screening.<br>
<br>Although there were centres of excellence elsewhere in the UK where cytology screening was practised and promoted, there was considerable apathy and even antipathy to its development and some evidence that its effectiveness might have been overstated. A rather poorly funded NHS programme was started in 1967. Its inadequacy was foretold in a letter that year to the <span class="italic">BMJ</span> by Stanley Way, chairman of the British Society for Clinical Cytology, of which organization Macgregor later became chairman and president. The failure of the first NHS programme was reported in a <span class="italic">Lancet</span> editorial in 1985 entitled &#145;Cervical cancer: death by incompetence&#146;. Meanwhile, the Aberdeen programme became internationally recognized with the publication in the <span class="italic">BMJ</span> in 1985 of a case-control study demonstrating its effectiveness. This provided key evidence for the International Agency for Research on Cancer publication <span class="italic">Screening for Cancer of the Uterine Cervix</span> (1986), which was influential in the development of cervical screening throughout the world, including the successful NHS programme that was implemented in 1988. Macgregor was invited to speak at a conference celebrating the silver jubilee of the Royal College of Pathologists in 1987 and was presentated to the queen and duke of Edinburgh. Always tactful and diplomatic, she was also honest and straightforward. When the duke asked her what caused cervical cancer she replied, &#145;Sexual intercourse, Sir&#146;  (private information). From her research she had always suspected there was an infective cause, which during her lifetime was proved to be high-risk types of human papillomavirus. This led to the development of a vaccine, which ironically was announced in the UK in a press release on the very day she died.<br>
<br>There was much more to Betty Macgregor than her successful career, which she combined, at a time when it was difficult to do so, with a rewarding family life as wife, mother, grandmother, and finally great-grandmother. As one of her granddaughters later said, &#145;She was a remarkable woman, a much-respected colleague, an admired friend, a devoted mother, a generous, fun-loving and strong-willed grandmother&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Macgregor was awarded fellowships of the International Academy of Cytology (1963), the Royal College of Pathologists (1982), and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (1986), and appointed OBE in 1984. After retirement, she became director of the Harris Birthright Research Centre in Aberdeen, commuting from a house she had bought on the Isle of Seil. Her husband predeceased her in 1972 as did her eldest son, Andrew, in 1995. She died of cerebrovascular disease on 8 October 2005 at the Lynn of Lorne Nursing Home, Benderloch, near Oban, having spent her final days on the west coast of Scotland enjoying the beautiful views that she loved so much. She was survived by a daughter, Elisabeth, and two sons, Alastair and Roy.<br>
