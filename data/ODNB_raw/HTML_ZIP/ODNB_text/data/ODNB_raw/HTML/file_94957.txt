<span class="headword">Hossain,  Rokeya Sakhawat</span>  (<em>c.</em>1880&#150;1932), <span class="occ">educationist and social reformer in India</span>, was born Rokeya Khatun in Pairaband, Rangpur district, Bengal, India, the second of three daughters and third of five children of Zahiruddin Abu Ali Haider Saber, landowner, and his wife, Rahatunnessa Sabera Chaudurani. Her date of birth is conventionally given as 9 December 1880, though her grandniece Majeda Saber has, as a result of a close reading of her writings, combined with family knowledge, suggested that she may have been born in 1877  (private information). Her father came from the conservative, Urdu-speaking, Muslim landed gentry, and her mother was given to strict purdah and observance of tradition. Rokeya's own childhood was spent in the family house's inner quarters (<i>andarmahal</i>), where purdah was observed. She studied under a tutor at home for a short while, when the family was staying in Calcutta, but this was stopped as female education was frowned upon. Indeed, she owed her early education largely to her brother Ibrahim, a student at St Xavier's College, Calcutta, who secretly taught her to read and write both English, the language of the new &eacute;lite, and Bengali, the language of the non-aristocratic class.<br>
<br>About 1898 Rokeya married Syed Sakhawat Hossain, a widower many years her senior, and a member of the enlightened section of the Muslim gentry that had begun to emerge in the late nineteenth century. At the time of their marriage he had just returned from studying in England to take up a post as deputy magistrate in Bhagalpur, Bihar. Theirs was a companionate marriage, in which Rokeya managed the house, nursed her diabetic husband, socialized modestly, and kept up her intellectual pursuits. They had two daughters, but both died in infancy. A liberal and progressive, Sakhawat encouraged his wife to study and write, and to set up a small school for girls. After his death on 3 May 1909 she founded a girls' school in Bhagalpur, but as a result of conflict with her step-daughter she decided to move to Calcutta. There, in March 1911, with money left her by her husband, she set up the Sakhawat Memorial Girls' School, initially with just eight pupils. With encouragement from Lady Chelmsford (the wife of the viceroy, who visited the school in 1917) and others she and her small team added further classes, so that by 1931 the school taught girls up to university entrance level. Despite the earlier efforts of Nawab Faizunnessa Choudhurani and Khujista Akhter Banu in Comilla (1873) and Calcutta (1905) respectively, Rokeya's was the first enduring institution for Muslim girls in Bengal; after her death it was taken over by the government, and at the beginning of the twenty-first century it continued to thrive.<br>
<br>In March 1916 Rokeya founded the Anjuman-e-Khawatin-e-Islam (Muslim Women's Association) in Calcutta, following the example of several such welfare associations across India. The objective of the association was to enable needy women to become self-reliant. Various issues affecting women, such as child marriage, divorce, dowries, childrearing, education, and women's movements around the world, were discussed at the anjuman. Volunteers visited the slums of Calcutta and gave lessons on sewing, handicrafts, childrearing, hygiene, and other topics; and small exhibitions were hosted. A charitable fund was also set up, to provide shelter and education for orphans, help for impoverished widows, and encouragement to women to set up small businesses.<br>
<br>Rokeya embarked on her writing career in Bhagalpur with the publication of an essay, &#145;Pipasha&#146;, in the journal <span class="italic">Nabaprabha</span> in 1902. There followed a steady stream of essays (published in two collected volumes entitled <span class="italic">Motichur</span> in 1905 and 1929), short stories, poems, novels, and satirical writings. Her two best-known works were &#145;Sultana's Dream&#146;, published in the <span class="italic">Indian Ladies' Magazine</span>, Madras, in 1905, and in book form in 1908, and <span class="italic">Abarodhbasini</span> (&#145;The secluded ones&#146;), published in 1931. An anthology of her writings, <span class="italic">Rokeya Rachanabali</span>, was published by the Bangla Academy, Dhaka, in 1973. Generally she wrote in Bengali, though occasionally she wrote in English. Her literature followed in the main the tradition set by the late nineteenth-century &#145;Bengali renaissance&#146; prose writers. She was more renowned as an essayist than as a novelist or poet; her style was characterized by <i>manoswikata</i>&#151;intellect, logic, humour, irony, and a focus on the matter at hand. Her writings, like those of other Bengali reformers, were intended to put forth an argument and convince the reader of the goal in mind.<br>
<br>Rokeya's writings centred on social issues, especially those pertaining to the subordination of women. In &#145;Streejatir abanati&#146; (&#145;The degradation of women&#146;), published in <span class="italic">Mahila</span> in 1903, she set out clearly her view that the subordination of women was the result of history, and not of any law of nature, and even used the term &#145;slavery&#146; to describe the contemporary status of women: &#145;Readers! Have you ever reflected on your deplorable condition? What are we in this age of civilization of the twentieth century? Slaves! We hear that slavery has been abolished from the world but has our own slavery vanished? No!&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rokeya Rachanabali</span>, 1973, 17). In other essays and allegories, and in her novel <span class="italic">Padmarag</span> (1928), she elaborated on the ways in which women were subordinated to men and robbed of their basic dignity by the institutions of family, law, education, employment, politics, culture, and religion. It was not, however, enough for a reformer simply to let the matter rest there. Rokeya provided solutions: education, leading to waged work, consciousness raising (a perception that women needed to deconstruct patriarchal notions embedded in their psyches), and the growth of a feeling of solidarity or sisterhood. With regard to politics, like many of her contemporaries she dwelt on <i>nari jagoron</i> (&#145;women's awakening&#146;) rather than on a women's movement as such, and she had little to say about women and politics (in the conventional sense of the term). Nevertheless she provided alternative visions of a society in which women were allowed to flourish. In <span class="italic">Padmarag</span>, for instance, she depicted an ashram, Tarini Bhaban, as a refuge where women from all communities and classes could live and work in dignity and sisterhood. In &#145;Sultana's Dream&#146;, a fantasy which predated Charlotte Perkins Gilman's <span class="italic">Herland</span> by ten years, she presented a satirical picture of a society in which gender relations are reversed, with men staying at home in seclusion and women occupying the public space encompassing the government, economy, science, culture, entertainment, and education.<br>
<br>Having presided over a session of the Indian Women's Conference at Aligarh earlier in the year, Begum Rokeya (as she was known) died at her home, 162 Lower Circular Road, Calcutta, on 9 December 1932. On her desk was her last piece of writing, &#145;Narir adhikar&#146; (&#145;Rights of women&#146;). She was buried the same day in the Muslim cemetery at Syedpur, near Calcutta.<br>
