<span class="headword">Skip,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1552), <span class="occ">bishop of Hereford</span>, was of humble origins. Testamentary and manorial records show that he was the son of Edmund Skip, husbandman, of Irstead, Norfolk, and his wife Alys, and the nephew of Richard Skip who in 1519 was rector of St John de Sepulchre, Ber Street, Norwich. A minor when both his parents died in 1507, by 1515 John Skip was studying at Gonville Hall, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1515 and proceeded successively MA in 1518, BTh in 1533, and DTh in 1535. Between 1519 and 1521 he was president of Physwick Hostel, a dependency of Gonville's. Traditionally linked with the early development of reformed opinions in religion in Cambridge, he has been named in that context as a member of the group that met at the White Horse tavern there. Although the role of these meetings in the dissemination of protestantism is now perceived as largely imaginary, Skip's credentials as an early supporter of reform are none the less well established. In 1530 Stephen Gardiner listed him as one of the supporters at Cambridge of the king's case for a divorce, along with Simon Heynes, Hugh Latimer, Nicholas Shaxton, Nicholas Heath, and Thomas Goodrich.<br>
<br>In 1534 Skip and Heynes were sent from the court to Cambridge &#145;for the vindication of the king's supreme authority in his own dominions against the Pope's pretended power&#146;  (Strype, 1/1.260). His career prospered, for he was made vicar of Thaxted, Essex, in 1534 and also received an important appointment at court. In 1535, after the elevation of Nicholas Shaxton to be bishop of Salisbury, Skip was made chaplain and almoner to Queen Anne Boleyn; he also succeeded Shaxton as canon of Westminster and prebendary of St Stephen's. (The Dr Skip named as Katherine of Aragon's almoner in 1518 was certainly a different person.) In a position close to a queen with strong evangelical sympathies, he was able to exercise some influence and his well-known friendship with Matthew Parker dated from this time. He served the queen until her death in 1536, and at the time of her fall did what he could in her defence, visiting her frequently in prison and attending her during her final hours: Sir William Kingston, constable of the Tower, wrote to Cromwell in the early hours of 19 May, the day of her execution, &#145;her Almoner is continewaly with hyr, and has bene syns ii of the clock after midnight&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 10, no. 910).<br>
<br>Skip's connection with the executed queen did not hinder his subsequent career. He was named master of Gonville Hall in 1536 and retained that position until 1540. He was also archdeacon of Suffolk from 1536 to 1539, rector of Newington, Surrey, in 1538, and archdeacon of Dorset from 1538 to 1539. It is also to this period that one of the more curious of Skip's contributions to posterity can be dated&#151;a recipe for apple tarts.<br>
<br>On 7 November 1539 Skip was named bishop of Hereford following the translation of Edmund Bonner to London. Little can be said about his administration of his diocese. He presided over the transfer of the Forest deanery to the newly formed diocese of Gloucester in 1541 and over the dissolution of some seventy-seven chantries and chapels. He also made a 200-year lease of his episcopal residence in London to Lord Clinton&#151;a lease that was revoked after Queen Mary succeeded to the throne. Perhaps it was to compensate for this loss that in 1551 he obtained a grant of the advowson of St Katherine's Hospital, Ledbury. After he arrived in his see, Skip appears to have taken the opportunity to have released a large number of clergy from his prison at Hereford, where they had been confined for breaches of ecclesiastical discipline. Whether this was a manifestation of reforming tendencies or simply a general amnesty is unknown.<br>
<br>In fact, although Skip acted in his diocese as the government directed, there is no evidence that he did anything further there to advance the cause of the Reformation. Indeed, his essentially moderate, even conservative, position towards religious change, especially during the reign of Edward VI, seems to indicate a reluctance to advance too far down the protestant road. As early as 1536 Skip was arguing that reform ought not to mean throwing the theological baby out with the bathwater:<blockquote>The kynges office is to se thabuses taken awey and not the good thinges themselffes except hit so be that thabuses can nott be taken awey, as Ezechias toke awey the brason serpent when he cowed nott take awey thabuse of hitt. (TNA: PRO, SP 6/1, fol. 10)</blockquote>For Skip, then and later, reform ought to be cautious and thoughtful or, as he said in a letter to Matthew Parker, &#145;cold and tardy&#146;  (Bruce and Perowne, 9).<br>
<br>Despite his association with Anne Boleyn and leading reformers, Skip's religious opinions never appear to have been radical and he is probably more correctly seen as a Henrician Catholic than as a protestant. Just before the execution of Anne Boleyn, on Passion Sunday (2 April) 1536, he preached a sermon in the king's chapel that caused considerable disquiet. Basing himself on the text &#145;Quis ex vobis arguet me de peccato?&#146; (&#145;Which of you convinceth me of sin?&#146;&#151;<span class="roman">John</span> 8: 46), he launched an attack on the wholesale changes that were then occurring in the church. Aware of the tension that existed between the queen and Thomas Cromwell, especially over the impending dissolution of the lesser monasteries and the use to which the proceeds were to be put, the tone and content of Skip's sermon were extremely critical of Cromwell's intentions to reclaim church lands for the crown, and may also have been implicitly critical of the king. Like the queen, Skip would have preferred the money to be devoted to furthering the cause of reform rather than to filling the king's coffers. The sermon was blunt and he went so far as to modify the biblical story of Haman and Ahasuerus to make the point that councillors ought not to deceive the king.<br>
<br>Although his outburst led to Skip's being interrogated, the case went no further. Subsequently he appears to have maintained a cautiously conservative theological position. In 1536 he was consulted over the issues of justification, purgatory, and the numbering of the ten commandments for the forthcoming <span class="roman">Bishops' Book</span>. In 1538 he was named to a commission against Anabaptists. In 1543 he was involved in the heresy trial of John Marbeck and is said by Foxe to have been sympathetic to the musician, of whom he was supportive during his fourth examination, and whom he reassured afterwards that there was no substance to the charges against him (unlike his associates, Marbeck escaped the stake). In the same year, however, he is said to have argued with Cranmer over the doctrine contained in the <span class="roman">King's Book</span>, and under Edward VI, along with Day and Heath, he was identified by Cranmer as one of the bishops with awkward opinions on the new prayer book of 1549, particularly over the sacraments. The suggestion that he was one of the group of theologians at Windsor that compiled the 1552 prayer book has no foundation.<br>
<br>Skip's apparently ambiguous religious conservatism was put to no further test. He died in London on 28 March 1552, some fifteen months before the accession of Mary, and was buried at St Mary Mounthaw, London.<br>
