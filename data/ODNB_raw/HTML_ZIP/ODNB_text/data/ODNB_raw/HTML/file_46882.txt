<span class="headword">Dixon, Sir  Raylton</span>  (1838&#150;1901), <span class="occ">shipbuilder</span>, was born on 8 July 1838 at Westgate, Newcastle upon Tyne, the second of at least three sons of Jeremiah Dixon of Balla Wray, Ambleside, Westmorland, a bank employee, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Frank. His elder brother, John Dixon, an engineer, was involved in the transfer of Cleopatra's Needle from Egypt to the Thames Embankment in 1879. Dixon was privately educated before being apprenticed to Coutts and Parkinson, shipbuilders, of Willington quay on Tyneside. From there he moved in 1856 to work for Charles Mitchell &amp; Co., iron shipbuilders, at Walker, on the Tyne.<br>
<br>Dixon moved to Teesside in 1859 as manager of the former Rake Kimber shipyard in Middlesbrough, which Richardson, Duck &amp; Co. had just taken over, and three years later, with a partner, Thomas Backhouse, he bought the yard. They later added the former Candlish Fox and David Jays yards to establish the Cleveland Dockyard, which they ran with the help of Dixon's younger brother Waynman. Dixon married Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1842), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Walker, of Glasgow in 1863; they had two sons and six daughters, one of whom married a member of the Bolckow family. By the time Backhouse retired in 1873, and Dixon became sole owner, they had built more than eighty ships. Although they built mainly passenger and cargo steamers, the yard launched its first warship, HMS <i>Tourmaline</i>, in 1875, and went on to build many more naval vessels, especially gunboats and cruisers, for the Royal Navy and several foreign governments, in association with Harroway, the naval architect. Between 1873 and 1882 output grew from 5000 tons a year to 27,000 tons. When Dixon launched his first steel ship in 1883 his workforce had grown to 2300. Despite the depression of 1884 to 1887, when production at the yard shrank to 24 per cent of the 1883 output and many workers were laid off, the yard survived, and in 1886 the SS <i>Santiago</i>, the largest ship ever built on the Tees, was launched to be used on the north Atlantic route of the Wilson Line. In 1887 Dixon took over a yard on the site of the old Teesside Iron and Engine Works, and by 1889 had increased his tonnage to over 40,000 tons. In 1889 Dixon was the largest shipbuilder on the Tees, launching 48 per cent of the total output that year, and seven of the ten largest ships built on the Tees between 1889 and 1914 were made at the Cleveland Dockyard, including the SS <i>Montrose</i> (1897), the first Teesside ship over 5000 tons, and the SS <i>Manchester City</i> (1898), which was 7696 tons. The firm became a limited liability company, Sir Raylton Dixon &amp; Co. Ltd, in 1897, and by the time of Dixon's death over 500 ships had been built at the yard, which had expanded to 7 berths. The company built steamers for all the leading passenger lines, including P. &amp; O., and Union Castle, and for mercantile marines all over the world.<br>
<br>Dixon had other business concerns. He was a director of Sadler &amp; Co. Ltd, chemical manufacturers of Middlesbrough, Robert Stephenson &amp; Co., the Newcastle engineering company, and the Elder, Dempster Shipping Company, Liverpool. He joined the Institution of Naval Architects in 1868, serving twice on the council, and was a member of the North East Coast Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders. A man with very wide interests, Dixon enjoyed drawing caricatures and photography, and was first president of the Tees Amateur Boating Club. A good shot, he was a major in the 1st North Yorkshire artillery volunteers for eighteen years. He was also a churchwarden of St Hilda's parish church in Middlesbrough. In the 1880s, Dixon moved into Gunnergate Hall, Marton, built by the ironmaster John Vaughan, partner of Henry Bolckow, who had lived nearby in Marton Hall.<br>
<br>A member of Middlesbrough town council from 1868 to 1874, and from 1878 to 1884, Dixon served as mayor of Middlesbrough from 1888 to 1889, when the prince and princess of Wales opened the new town hall and municipal buildings. His yard was given the contract for a ferry steamer when his proposal for a transporter bridge linking the two sides of the Tees was turned down. He contested Middlesbrough as a Conservative in the general election of 1885, but was defeated by the sitting member, Isaac Wilson, a Cleveland ironmaster. A JP for Middlesbrough from 1872 and on the commission of the peace for the North Riding of Yorkshire from 1885, Dixon served as deputy lieutenant of the county in 1889. He was knighted for public services in 1890, and was appointed a freeman of the borough of Middlesbrough.<br>
<br>Sir Raylton Dixon died at his home, Gunnergate Hall, on 28 July 1901 after a long illness; he was survived by his wife. He had been one of the leading shipbuilders in the north-east. The yard was taken over by Lambert Bros. Ltd during the First World War, although members of the Dixon family retained their influence, and was closed in 1921.<br>
