<span class="headword">Hodson,  Frodsham</span>  (1770&#150;1822), <span class="occ">college head and Church of England clergyman</span>, the son of the Revd George Hodson, was born at Liverpool on 7 June 1770. He entered Manchester grammar school in January 1784, and left it in 1787 to proceed to Brasenose College, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1791, MA in 1793, BD in 1808, and DD in 1809. In 1791 he succeeded to a Hulmean exhibition, and in 1794 was elected a fellow of his college. In 1793 he gained the university prize for an essay in English prose on &#145;The influence of education and government on national character&#146; (<span class="italic">Oxford English Prize Essays</span>, 1836, 1). In 1795 he was chosen lecturer at St George's Church, Liverpool, and subsequently became chaplain of the same church. His persistence in holding the chaplaincy, although he rarely in later years visited Liverpool, gave offence in the town. In 1803&#150;4, and again in 1808&#150;10, he filled the office of public examiner at Oxford. In 1808 he was appointed rector of St Mary's, Stratford-le-Bow, London, and vacated his fellowship. He married, on 30 June 1808, Anne (<i>d</i>. 23 April 1848), daughter of John Dawson, of Mossley Hill, Liverpool. They had four daughters and one son.<br>
<br>In 1809 Hodson was elected principal of Brasenose College. He presided over the college with great distinction for thirteen years, during which admissions to the college markedly increased. He took a leading part in the affairs of the university. He was one of the most energetic managers of Lord Grenville's election in 1809 as chancellor. The Revd W. Agutter retracted a libel on his character in the <span class="italic">Anti-Jacobin Review</span> (1811). He served the office of vice-chancellor in 1818, and was appointed regius professor of divinity, with the appurtenant canonry of Christ Church and rectory of Ewelme, in 1820. It was believed that Lord Liverpool intended him for a bishopric, but he died in Oxford, after a short illness, on 18 January 1822, aged fifty-one. He was buried in the ante-chapel of his college, where he is commemorated in a Latin inscription by Dr E. Cardwell.<br>
<br>In the university Hodson was long remembered for his success as a college tutor and administrator, and for the dignity of his personal appearance and address. He edited Thomas Falconer's <span class="italic">Chronological Tables</span> (1796). His probationary exercise as a fellow of Brasenose was published in the same year, entitled <span class="italic">The Eternal Filiation of the Son of God Asserted on the Evidence of the Sacred Scriptures</span>. His only other works were three occasional sermons preached at Liverpool, and printed in 1797, 1799, and 1804.<br>
