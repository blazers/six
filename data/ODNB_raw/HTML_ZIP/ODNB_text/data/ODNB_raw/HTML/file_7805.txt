<span class="headword">Donaldson, Sir  Stuart Alexander</span>  (1812&#150;1867), <span class="occ">businessman and politician in Australia</span>, was born on 16 December 1812, the third son of Stuart Donaldson (<i>d</i>. 1849), a London merchant born in Haddington, Scotland, and his wife, Betsy, the daughter of John Crundall of Snab Green, Lancashire. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7803/', "John William Donaldson (1811&#150;1861)")</script> was his brother. Family memory held that Stuart was educated privately. At the age of fifteen he entered his father's firm, which was one of the major traders with Australia. He spent part of 1830 in Hamburg and Berlin, and travelled in the silver-mining regions of Mexico between 1831 and 1834; in 1866 he published his letters on his experiences there under the title <span class="italic">Mexico Thirty Years Ago</span>.<br>
<br>In 1835 Donaldson migrated from England to Australia to work with his father's correspondent Richard Jones, who was the leading merchant in Sydney. Donaldson became Jones's partner in 1837 and bought his business from the beginning of 1838. This made him immediately a substantial broker, buyer, and exporter of wool and whale oil, as well as an importer and wholesaler on a grand scale. He acquired 250,000 valuable acres of sheep-runs in New England. Building on the capital and credit of the family firm, he became promoter and director of banking, insurance, steamshipping, railway, and copper-mining companies. His profits increased markedly once gold was discovered in 1851.<br>
<br>Donaldson had been appointed a magistrate as early as 1838, in which year he organized the Australian Club, the first club for gentlemen in the colony; in 1856 he was a founder member of the Union Club, its main rival. The capital, youthful energy, affability, bachelorhood, and self-regard that involved him in managing the social life of his peers drew him also into electoral politics, with the franchise limited to men of property. In the legislative council of New South Wales he held the rural seat of Durham, in the Hunter valley, at four polls between 1848 and 1853, when he returned to England on business. While there he married, on 21 February 1854, Amelia, the daughter of Frederick Cowper of Carleton Hall, Penrith, Cumberland. Following his return to Australia, Donaldson won the suburban seat of Sydney Hamlets in 1855 and retained it in 1856 at the first election under a new constitution (with a broader franchise) which conferred responsible government on the colony.<br>
<br>After two weightier conservatives failed to form a ministry, the governor turned to the clubman Donaldson as a safe alternative. Donaldson assembled his team in April 1856 and was sworn in as colonial secretary and first premier of New South Wales on 6 June. He and his backers hoped that he might gain support from some of the liberal parliamentarians, but the factional and administrative complexity of moving to responsible government brought his ministry down on 25 August 1856. Its liberal successor lasted for five weeks only. In the ensuing conservative ministry led by Henry Parker (October 1856&#150;September 1857) Donaldson was colonial treasurer and, briefly, commissioner for railways. He was also a member of the senate of the University of Sydney from 1851 to 1861.<br>
<br>Having reached the limit of honour in Australia, Donaldson consolidated his wealth, placed his sheep stations in the hands of two brothers-in-law, and in 1859 retired to England. He was knighted on 23 August 1860. In that year he assumed the chair of the General Association for the Australian Colonies, an investors' lobby in London, and he joined company boards. From his arrival in England he looked for a seat in the House of Commons: <span class="italic">The Times</span> described him in April 1860 as &#145;a returned Australian gentleman who has been hovering about several English constituencies in the last few months&#146;. He was the official but unsuccessful Liberal candidate at by-elections for Dartmouth in August 1859, Harwich in April 1860, and Bath in February 1861. A moderate conservative in the fast-changing Australian colonies, he presented himself as a moderate liberal in the United Kingdom, an admirer of Lord Palmerston who opposed church rates and supported a &pound;6 franchise and the secret ballot. Donaldson visited his investments in Australia in 1861 and 1864. But his health declined drastically, and he was diagnosed with heart problems; he became gaunt where he had once been portly, and he lost his voluble joviality (which some people called bumptiousness). He died at his father-in-law's seat, Carleton Hall, on 11 January 1867, survived by his wife, their four young sons, who included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32857/', "St Clair George Alfred Donaldson (1863&#150;1935)")</script>, and one infant daughter. In 1841 Donaldson had arranged a cabin passage from Sydney to London for Mrs Maria Leicester and her four-month-old son, whose paternity he acknowledged.<br>
