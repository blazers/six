<span class="headword">Triggs,  (Harry Benjamin) Inigo</span>  (1876&#150;1923), <span class="occ">architect and garden designer</span>, was born at Holly House, Turnham Green, Chiswick, Middlesex, on 28 February 1876, the son of James Triggs, a carpet manufacturer, and his wife, Celia Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bryant. The boy's third name came from his collateral descent from the seventeenth-century architect Inigo Jones, and was soon adopted by the family as his first name. James Triggs died while his son was still at school. At sixteen Inigo decided to leave the Godolphin School in Hammersmith and take articles with Peter Dollar, a City architect. He went to Chiswick School of Art, and attended the Royal Academy Schools where he won prizes for his work, and a travelling studentship. Having proved his ability, he gained more experience from a series of assistantships to architects such as Leonard Stokes, Sir Henry Tanner, and William Frederick Unsworth (1850&#150;1912). He won a prize for design from the RIBA, which admitted him as an associate member in 1899.<br>
<br>His illustrious ancestor in mind, Triggs set off on his bicycle with the younger Henry Tanner to collect material for a book, <span class="italic">Some Architectural Works of Inigo Jones</span> (1901). Pleased with its success, and having visited and made drawings of &#145;some of the most complete and historical gardens now extant in this country&#146;, he decided to write another, which highlighted his interest in and attitude to garden design. <span class="italic">Formal Gardens in England and Scotland</span> (1902) made early use of photography to illuminate the accounts of the gardens, to demonstrate &#145;the principle involved in their planning and arrangement in relation to the house, which is the essential element in what is the custom to call a Formal Garden&#146;  (<span class="italic">Formal Gardens</span>, xiii). As well as the geometry of the layout Triggs portrayed the decorative stone vases, lead cisterns, metal gates, sundials and dovecotes, mazes, and topiary. Triggs's interests lay in the seventeenth century, in particular the architecture and gardens of Andr&eacute; le N&ocirc;tre (1613&#150;1700). He believed those making gardens should have a good knowledge of their history. Triggs won the Godwin bursary from the RIBA in 1906, which gave him money to travel. He visited villas and palaces in Italy, and in 1906 <span class="italic">The Art of Garden Design in Italy</span> followed the same thorough and empathetic form as before. On 9 October 1907 he married, at the cathedral church of Llandaff, Gladys Claire (<i>b</i>. 1873), daughter of Sir Edward Stock Hill (1834&#150;1902), shipowner and MP.<br>
<br>At some time in the early part of his career Inigo Triggs became ill. A reference to a haemorrhage, and the fact that he went to Switzerland to recuperate, suggest that this illness might have been tuberculosis, which stayed with him throughout his life. He was well enough to return to England in 1908, where he rejoined the practice of William Unsworth, and worked on a number of gardens in Hampshire. In 1910 he bought and renovated an old farmhouse at Liphook, Hampshire, which he called Little Boarhunt. He excavated part of the farmyard to make a sunken garden divided by a canal, placing a figure on a brick column in the middle, and enclosing it with low rubble walls in which flowers were planted. Unsworth had made measured drawings of the generalife in Granada. At Ashford Chace near Petersfield for the explorer Aubyn Trevor-Battye in 1912 Unsworth and Triggs added Moorish effects to a sunken garden with a fountain court and a lily tank filled by a conduit. Later Triggs was to lay out the Canadian military cemetery in Bramshott, Hampshire, near the church in which there is a memorial plaque to him.<br>
<br>Triggs's work for the Godwin bursary of 1906 showed that he had become interested in city planning. He recorded the practical and aesthetic aspects of parks, squares, and open spaces in Paris, Berlin, Vienna, and Munich with photographs, neat diagrams, and thoughtful analysis, noting that his chosen subject &#145;has hitherto passed almost unnoticed in England&#146;  (&#145;Planning of public squares&#146;, 1). His research, enlarged and acknowledging the influence of J. St&uuml;bben, Cologne's city architect, and the Viennese architect Camillo Sitte, appeared later in <span class="italic">Town Planning, Past, Present and Possible</span> (1909). Visits to the continent continued to enlarge Triggs's knowledge of historic gardens in Europe, and in 1913 Batsford published his <span class="italic">Garden Craft in Europe</span>, in which a portrait of Andr&eacute; le N&ocirc;tre looks out from the frontispiece and reaffirms Triggs's delight in seventeenth-century garden design. At the same time he was working on the landscaping for Whiteley Village, Surrey, a model settlement built from 1912 following a bequest from William Whiteley, the founder of the London drapery store. To house retired members of the firm, a village was built near Cobham in Surrey, by a number of architects under the guidance of Frank Atkinson.<br>
<br>Triggs had never really shaken off the illness which no doubt held back the development of his career. His versatility in designing buildings and formal gardens was matched by his excellent books recording the historic landscapes of gardens and towns, which were just as valuable as bricks, mortar, and plants. He died on 8 April 1923 in Taormina, on the eastern coast of Sicily, leaving his wife and two daughters. He had been building there the Anglo-American Church of St George, in which he was buried.<br>
