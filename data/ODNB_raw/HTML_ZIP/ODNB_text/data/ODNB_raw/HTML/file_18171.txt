<span class="headword">Martiall,  John</span>  (1534&#150;1597), <span class="occ">religious controversialist</span>, was born in Daylesford, Worcestershire, although when he arrived at Winchester College in 1545, aged eleven, the admission-book recorded him as a native of Defford in the same county. He went on to New College, Oxford, in 1549, and was made fellow there in 1551 and BCL on 8 July 1556. He became second master or usher at Winchester College about 1556, while Thomas Hide was headmaster. Upon Elizabeth's accession he went into exile in Louvain, and took his BA at the University of Douai in 1567. A year later he was among the first group of English Catholic exiles who formed the English College under the leadership of William Allen.<br>
<br>It was during his time in exile that Martiall wrote <span class="italic">A treatyse of the crosse gathred out of the scriptures, councelles, and auncient fathers of the primitive church</span> (1564). This was in part a contribution to the controversy prompted by John Jewel, bishop of Salisbury, in his &#145;challenge sermon&#146;, but was also a response to Elizabeth I's retention of a cross in her royal chapel. Martiall dedicated the work to Elizabeth, describing her as &#145;so well affectioned to the crosse &hellip; that youre Majestie have alwayes kept it reverently in youre chappel&#146;  (fol. 1<i>v</i>). The tone of the work was set by the terms of the controversy started by Jewel, dwelling on the examples from scripture and the primitive church which Martiall held supported the veneration of the cross. He stressed the merit of the cross as being more powerful and beneficial to believers than the written word: &#145;that which wordes could not print in their heades, the contemplation of this signe doth so printe in their mindes, that they triumph over the devil &hellip;&#146;  (fol. 116<i>v</i>), and pointed out that:<blockquote>every man can not reade scripture, nor understand it when he reade it: and every man can not al times so conveniently heare a good preacher, as he may se the signe of the crosse, if it might be suffred to stand. (fol. 117<i>r</i>)</blockquote>He denied that Catholics dwelt on signs to the exclusion of true faith, insisting that &#145;for answer we saye, that nothing can avayle, and profit man, unlesse he hath a stedfast faith in Christ, and faithful belieff in the merites of his passion&#146;, but arguing that the sign of the cross was something which could strengthen such faith  (fol. 20<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>The book was attacked by Alexander Nowell in a court sermon of March 1565, but to Nowell's dismay the queen rebuked him for his excessive language in attacking Martiall. It was James Calfhill who wrote a refutation, which led to Martiall's second work, <span class="italic">A Replie to M. Calfhills Blasphemous Answer Made Against the Treatise of the Crosse</span> (1566). In this work Martiall asked Bishop Grindal and his colleagues whether Calfhill's work reflected &#145;the doctrine of all your church of England&#146;, or whether it was &#145;the fansie only of one idle brayne&#146;  (sig. *ij<i>r</i>). He deplored, and listed, the abusive language Calfhill had employed, and in particular denied the charge that Catholics were subversive, comparing their work with some of the more radical protestant tracts. &#145;There is no blast blowen against the monstruous regiment of women. There is no libel set foorth for order of succession: there is no word uttred against dewe obedience to the soveraine&#146;  (sig. **<i>v</i>). The work reiterated the need for veneration of the cross, drawing a powerful comparison between secular and sacred modes of reverence:<blockquote>When we meete together we put of the cap, we bowe the knee, we humble the bodie, we offer to kisse the hand. In like manner when we receave the kinges letters, we put of our capps. When we come into the chamber of presence, and see the cloth of estate, we shewe a kinde of reverence and honour unto it, not respecting the paper and waxe, nor silken clothe, or golden chaire, but the prince that wrote it, and kinge that sate under that cloth of estate. Right so when we see the image of Christe, or any Sayncte, we put of our cappes, we make courtesy, we bowe, we cappe, we kneele, and shewe such external reverence, and honour, not because it is made of silver and gold, or curiouslye wroughte, or sette with pearle, or fynely paynted, but because it representh unto me Christ and his passion. (sig. ***iij<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>)</blockquote>There was no protestant response to this until 1580, when William Fulke attacked Martiall and Thomas Stapleton together in <span class="italic">T. Stapleton and Martiall (Two Popish Heretikes) Confuted</span>. Martiall also wrote a work entitled &#145;Treatise of the tonsure of the clerks&#146;, but this was left unfinished, and so never printed.<br>
<br>After his time in Douai, with the backing of Owen Lewis, archdeacon of Hainault, and later bishop of Cassano, Martiall became a canon of the collegiate church of St Peter at Lille in Flanders. His installation was delayed by the civil unrest in the Low Countries, but finally took place in 1579. He served there for eighteen years, resigning the post in order to prepare himself for death, which came on 3 April 1597. He died in the arms of his friend William Gifford, later archbishop of Rheims and then dean of St Peter's Church, where Martiall was buried. He left a ring with a precious stone to adorn a piece of the true cross in the cathedral at Lille.<br>
