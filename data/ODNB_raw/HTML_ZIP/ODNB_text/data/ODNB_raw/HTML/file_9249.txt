<span class="headword">Feilding,  Basil</span>, second earl of Denbigh  (<em>c.</em>1608&#150;1675), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer and politician</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9251/', "William Feilding (c.1587&#150;1643)")</script> of Newnham Paddox, Warwickshire, and his wife, Susan Villiers (<i>fl</i>. 1606&#150;1651), whose brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28293/', "George Villiers")</script>, the favourite of James I and Charles I, rose to be duke of Buckingham. The Feildings were a substantial east Warwickshire family, with lands in that county, Leicestershire, and Rutland worth around &pound;2000 per annum in the 1630s. But it was through the Villiers connection that they made advantageous marriages and rose to prominence and lucrative court office in the 1620s. In December 1620 William Feilding was raised to the peerage as Baron Feilding of Newnham Paddox and Viscount Feilding. In 1622, when he was created earl of Denbigh, his daughter, Basil's sister, Mary, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12087/', "James Hamilton (1606&#150;1649)")</script>, the heir to the marquess of Hamilton, the premier Scottish peer, who succeeded to the title three years later. Basil Feilding attended Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1621, and was travelling in France in 1624 when his chaplain John Reynolds reported that late dinners at the French court were affecting the young man's health, while his French was suffering from too much contact with visiting English nobles. He was briefly at the Inner Temple in 1628.<h2>
<a name="Carolinecourtieranddiplomat"></a>Caroline courtier and diplomat</h2>The young Feilding's background in the 1620s was complex. Reynolds was a radical puritan and was summoned back from France in August 1624 to answer the privy council for publishing intemperate pamphlets urging a war with Spain. On the other hand his mother, who died a Catholic, was at this time a patron of prominent anti-puritans such as John Cosin and William Laud. Feilding, created a knight of the Bath in 1626, was apparently a favourite of his glamorous uncle who took him on the ill-fated &Icirc;le de R&eacute; expedition the following year and it was through Villiers's influence that Feilding was summoned to the House of Lords in his father's title of Lord Feilding in 1628. The death of Buckingham was a traumatic reverse; Feilding later wrote that he had been promised the posts of gentleman of the bedchamber and master of the robes but that on his uncle's death Charles I had instead told him &#145;to try his fortune in the warres of Holland&#146;  (<span class="italic">Seventh Report</span>, HMC, 223). He did indeed serve with Lord Wimbledon in the Low Countries and travelled in Germany in the early 1630s.<br>
<br>Feilding's marriage to Anne Weston (<i>d</i>. 1635), daughter of the lord treasurer, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29126/', "Richard Weston, earl of Portland")</script>, before January 1633 attached him to the most influential man in the government after Buckingham's death. In the 1630s Feilding attempted to juggle paradoxical, even contradictory, patronage relationships and political stances. He seems to have shared his father-in-law's support for a Spanish alliance (or at least for a pacific policy), yet he depended for advancement also on the influence of his mother, who was first lady of the bedchamber and a close friend to Charles's French queen, Henrietta Maria. In March 1633 Feilding played a supporting role when these divisions led the earl of Holland, from the queen's faction, to challenge Portland's son Jerome Weston to a duel. Feilding as Weston's ally challenged George Goring, Holland's friend, but both duels were banned by direct order of the king.<br>
<br>From 1634 Feilding served as ambassador-extraordinary to Venice, where he proved an ineffective diplomat but an enthusiastic collector of pictures for both the king and his brother-in-law Hamilton. After the deaths of both his wife and his father-in-law in March 1635, Feilding continued his broadly pro-Spanish stance, but was increasingly dependent on the backing of Hamilton and his mother to keep royal favour. His supporters had a difficult task, for Feilding was a prickly and maladroit diplomat, over-protective of his ambassadorial privileges, as when he sheltered a servant who had murdered a gondolier. In late 1637 the countess of Denbigh and Hamilton used all their influence to have Feilding, rather than the more prominent Viscount Conway, sent to offer condolences to Henrietta Maria's sister on the death of her husband, the duke of Savoy. He typically repaid all this effort with deeply embarrassing advice to the widowed duchess to remain neutral in the conflicts between France and Spain. This necessitated renewed strenuous efforts by his friends to prevent Feilding being recalled in disgrace. He returned to Venice under a cloud, his long-cherished hopes of replacing Viscount Scudamore in the rather more prestigious position as ambassador to France in ruins.<h2>
<a name="Parliamentariancommander"></a>Parliamentarian commander</h2>Feilding returned from Italy in June 1639, and at some point over the next three years he abandoned the court which had made his family's fortune for a parliamentarian stance. As so often in Feilding's life, it is impossible to disentangle the mixture of self-interest and principle which prompted this. At the Restoration he himself claimed that lack of preferment had freed him from commitment to the king's cause. A successor at Venice was appointed early in 1642 and Feilding was appointed lord lieutenant for Denbighshire and Flintshire under parliament's militia ordinance in February 1642, a clear sign that he was regarded as an opponent of the court. Indeed in June 1642 he urged Hamilton to support parliament's nineteen propositions as a basis for settlement, and at Edgehill he fought as a cavalry officer in the earl of Essex's army while his father served as a volunteer in the king's guard.<br>
<br>This breach in the Feilding family caused great anguish to his mother, who urged Basil to &#145;leave those that murthered your dear father&#146;  (Warks. CRO, CR2017/C1/24) after William Feilding had been killed in Prince Rupert's assault on Birmingham in April 1643. Two months later the new earl of Denbigh was nominated commander-in-chief of the associated counties of Warwickshire, Staffordshire, Shropshire, and Worcestershire in belated succession to the radical Lord Brooke. Denbigh's hesitation over taking the covenant and the doubts about his political loyalty raised by his royalist connections delayed his arrival in the midlands until the winter. There his attempts to raise men and money met immediate and fierce resistance. In Warwickshire he was identified with the more moderate and neutral gentry and his command was sabotaged by the militant county committee dominated by William Purefoy. In Staffordshire similarly he was at odds with the supporters of the determined commander Sir William Brereton, though he gained the adherence of local officers such as colonels Simon Rugely and Lewis Chadwick. Denbigh's attempts to aid beleaguered parliamentarians in Shropshire were long delayed and he had little military success. There were minor victories in Staffordshire and the slightly more significant capture of Oswestry and Cholmondeley House in the north-west of his command in June 1644. In mid-July 1644 Denbigh returned to London to try to increase his political authority, presenting a remonstrance against Purefoy and his other Warwickshire rivals to the Lords in August. These tangled disputes in Staffordshire and Warwickshire occupied both houses of parliament until early 1645. Despite clear local support, seen in the thousands of signatures on pro-Denbigh petitions from both Staffordshire and Warwickshire, Denbigh was never granted adequate powers and never returned to military command. Like other aristocratic commanders he lost office under the self-denying ordinance.<h2>
<a name="Independentpeer"></a>Independent peer</h2>In 1644 Denbigh was clearly an ally of moderate aristocratic parliamentarians like the earls of Essex and Manchester, and in the localities he was sympathetic to distressed royalists. In May 1646 Marchamont Nedham, in his royalist phase, petitioned Denbigh from the Fleet prison for help in presenting a petition to parliament. By this time, however, perhaps radicalized by the experience of war and royal intransigence, he was identified with the more zealous, Independent peers such as Lord Saye and Sele and the earl of Northumberland. Denbigh was active in national politics throughout the rest of the 1640s, serving as one of parliament's commissioners treating with the king at Uxbridge in January 1645. He was a consistent supporter of the army in its conflict with the presbyterian-dominated Commons in the spring of 1647, and fled to the army in late July after parliament had been coerced by London presbyterian agitation. Denbigh was one of eight peers who signed a declaration in support of the New Model Army on 4 August 1647  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 9, 1646&#150;7, 385). He headed the deputation that delivered the four bills to Charles at Carisbrooke, Isle of Wight, in December 1647. The parliamentarians came with no power to treat and Charles tried to give them a sealed answer. On Clarendon's account it was Denbigh, &#145;a person very ingrateful to the King&#146;, who forced the king to back down, telling him &#145;that though they had no authority to treat with him &hellip; yet they were not to be looked at as common messengers&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 4.278).<br>
<br>In January 1648 Denbigh, like lords Wharton and Saye and Sele, supported the vote of no further addresses to the king. In summer 1648 he was mostly absent from a House of Lords dominated by peers who wished for a speedy peace with the king. His closest allies sided with the army in hostility to renewed peace moves and in their willingness to condemn the invasion of England by Denbigh's brother-in-law Hamilton as treason. Denbigh himself did not return to the Lords until after Hamilton was safely defeated and his attendance was patchy until after Pride's Purge. In November and December 1648 he was in contact with the exiled presbyterian&#150;royalist minister Samuel Kem, but from 12 December 1648 until the last sitting of the Lords on 6 February 1649 Denbigh was ever-present as speaker.<br>
<br>Publicly at least Denbigh headed the small caucus of pro-army peers who gave some legitimacy to the revolution. He was among four peers only who attended on 19 December 1648, doing little but &#145;telling of Tales by the Fire's side&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Pragmaticus</span>), and later visited General Fairfax to declare their good affections to the army. In a striking gesture of submission, according to the newsletter report, Denbigh gave Fairfax a hand up to his horse. Around this time Denbigh was central to a murky, last-minute, and unsuccessful mission to save Charles's life, offering him some reprieve if the king renounced his negative voice, and repudiated any attempts to raise forces in Ireland or on the continent. In 1660 he told Charles II he had had 4000 men ready to rescue the king but &#145;their zeale and duty&#146; had been &#145;made fruitless for want of a commission&#146;  (<span class="italic">Seventh Report</span>, HMC, 224), but there is, predictably, no corroborative evidence.<h2>
<a name="RepublicandRestoration"></a>Republic and Restoration</h2>Denbigh refused to act when nominated to the commission to try Charles I, but the nomination itself is testimony to how far this nephew of Buckingham had travelled. He sat in the Lords on 30 January 1649 and was part of a committee established on 1 February to consider the settlement of the government after the regicide. Despite the abolition of the House of Lords he sat on the first two councils of state of the Commonwealth and was an averagely conscientious attender. He was not re-elected in 1651, but there is no real evidence of disaffection from the republic or of <i>rapprochement</i> with the royalists, though there was much wishful thinking on the part of royalist conspirators. He was present at Hamilton's execution in March 1649, breaking the news to his old friend that there would be no last-minute reprieve. He gave some protection to Hamilton's orphaned daughters in the 1650s, and aided his royalist cousin, the second duke of Buckingham&#151;&#145;the onlye branch which is left of my deare uncle&#146;&#151;over the composition for his estates  (<span class="italic">Fourth Report</span>, HMC, 256). He did not forget his mother, by this time an open Catholic and in exile with the queen in France, seeking to preserve her estates in 1651: &#145;how, though absent, being a Lady and having had noe share at all in the late troubles she can fall under the notion of delinquency is beyond my reason to judge of&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 23/170/350, April 1651). And he did not forget his own interests, petitioning in September 1649 for the repayment of &pound;10,000 debts incurred as ambassador to Venice. A committee headed by his one-time local rival William Purefoy suggested a grant of &pound;9000 although the House of Commons authorized less than &pound;2000.<br>
<br>Locally Denbigh was named to the Warwickshire commission of the peace and other local commissions throughout the 1650s. He was <i>custos rotulorum</i> and active also out of sessions. His social contacts in the 1650s were mostly with parliamentarians, including intriguing meetings with Wharton and Saye and Sele in early 1657, where they perhaps discussed the offer of the crown to Cromwell and their own possible admission to the new upper house. His other preoccupation was genealogy and, through the eminent midland antiquaries William Dugdale and Elias Ashmole, he was provided with a fantasy genealogy connecting his family to the Habsburgs, &#145;the Perhapsburgs&#146; in the words of J. H. Round  (Goodwin, 110). In 1659 he paid Dugdale &pound;100 for a pedigree with 67 &#145;double roundles and 49 coronetts&#146;  (Hamper, 105).<br>
<br>There are hints of passionate male friendship in youthful letters between Feilding and Edward Hyde, but there is evidence of intense emotion also in the third at least of his four childless marriages. His first wife, Anne Weston, died soon after their arrival in Venice in March 1635. On 12 August 1639 he married Barbara Lambe, daughter of the ecclesiastical lawyer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15926/', "Sir John Lambe")</script>, after the failure of her courtship by Lord Wentworth with, it was reported, at least &pound;50,000 portion. She died on 1 April 1641 and three months later, on 8 July, Feilding married Elizabeth Bourchier (1622&#150;1670) daughter of Edward, fourth earl of Bath. There are many passionate letters from her to Denbigh during his absences on campaign in the 1640s; one was signed off with &#145;A hundred thousand thousand kisses&#146;  (Warks. CRO, CR2017, family letters vol. 1, 151). She died on 22 September 1670 and again Denbigh remarried quickly, his new wife being Dorothy Lane (<i>c</i>.1650&#150;1709), a midland gentlewoman.<br>
<br>At the Restoration Denbigh was among the ten peers present on 25 April 1660 at the first meeting of the House of Lords since February 1649, and was active in parliament as the Restoration approached. He made a sycophantic and self-regarding &#145;submission&#146; to Charles II in 1660 when he petitioned for repayment of the debts he and his father had incurred in royal service. He argued that his dismissal from his posts had given him &#145;a latitude to act beyond his own thoughts and intentions which hath produced the effects of a generall and particular sadd repentance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Seventh Report</span>, HMC, 223). He referred to his father's death in the king's cause and claimed he had been prevented by considerations of honour from defecting to the royalists in 1644. Denbigh also claimed he had opposed the self-denying ordinance and had made determined efforts to save the king in 1648&#150;9. He claimed arrears of pension for eight-and-three-quarter years expiring on 30 January 1649 but did have the grace to suggest that the king should use some arrears to redeem 160 paintings left in pawn in Venice and keep them as a present. In conclusion he asked for &#145;a fair construction on intermediate accidents and revolutions of affairs&#146; since the late 1630s (TNA: PRO, SP 29/28/89; TNA: PRO, SP 16/491/129).<br>
<br>Such effrontery prompts a cynical judgement on Denbigh's shifts of allegiance from 1628 to 1660. He could be condemned as disloyal and self-serving. Edward Hyde, earl of Clarendon, who had been his very close friend, gave a damning indictment in his account of Denbigh at Uxbridge:<blockquote>The earl of Denbigh had much greater parts, and saw further before him into the desperate designs of that party that yet had the power &hellip; and detested those designs as much as any of them; yet the pride of his nature, not inferior to the proudest, and the conscience of his ingratitude to the King, in some respects superior to theirs who had been most obliged, kept him from being willing to quit their company.</blockquote>He alleged Denbigh had &#145;concluded that if any conjuncture fell out in which by losing his life he might preserve the King, he would embrace the occasion; otherwise, he would shift the best he could for himself&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.496).<br>
<br>Clarendon, however, was embittered by Denbigh's betrayal of friendship as well as by a political divide. While Denbigh consistently sought office and reward, there is also evidence of steady principle in his career. From 1642 until his death Denbigh exhibited support for staunch protestantism and&#151;while willing to serve all kinds of regimes&#151;a preference for monarchy limited by parliament, with the peerage taking a central role. His attitudes are revealed in his comments when refusing the first oath proposed for members of the council of state in 1649. He could not endorse the &#145;particulars that look backward&#146; because they were contrary to his role in the Lords, &#145;then acknowledged a third estate of this kingdom&#146;. None the less he was prepared to continue in the public service:<blockquote>He hath formerly had the honour to be employed by the late king to the state of Venice and to other princes and served in it faithfully. That he was since employed by both Houses in arms and was also faithful in that. That now there is no other power in England but that of the House of Commons in whom the liberty and freedom of the people is so involved as he is resolved to live and die with them. And doth acknowledge them the supreme power of the nation. (TNA: PRO, SP 25/62/2&#150;3)</blockquote>Feilding was a conscientious patron of godly ministers in Warwickshire, protecting two presbyterians ejected after 1660, and was close to the maverick presbyterian Samuel Kem in the 1640s and 1650s. A magnanimous gesture in August 1660 elicited striking praise from the zealous republican Edmund Ludlow as &#145;very much a gentleman in his spirit, and deportment, and a lover of his country&#146;  (E. Ludlow, <span class="italic">A Voyce from the Watch Tower</span>, ed. A. B. Worden, CS, 4th ser., 21, 1978, 170). As Hamilton's brother-in-law, Denbigh was invited to nominate a regicide to be excepted from pardon as satisfaction for Hamilton's execution, and nominated, deliberately it was believed, someone who was conveniently dead.<h2>
<a name="Countrypeer"></a>Country peer</h2>Denbigh's career after 1660 is as difficult to interpret. He received a further title&#151;Baron St Liz&#151;in February 1665. He was commissioned captain of a troop of horse in 1667 and made renewed attempts in 1674 to obtain his pension arrears. None the less he remained associated with dissident peers such as Lord Wharton, opposing the repression of dissenters in the 1660s, and in 1673 he was apparently active in the opposition to royal policy following the secret treaty of Dover. Among his papers and heavily annotated by Denbigh is the &#145;Steps of descent whereby of late this Monarchy hath much declined and lessened itselfe&#146;, a short treatise apparently relating to discussions concerning the passing of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>. It condemned the favours shown to papists, the suspension of laws passed by parliament, and England's engaging in war &#145;for the grandeur of France&#146;. It called for James, duke of York, whatever his private opinions, to declare in the Lords that he would publicly defend the established protestant religion. A scathing reference to &#145;that darling Act of theirs for Uniformity&#146; suggests that Denbigh was no zealous Anglican but someone who did not believe that protection for dissenters should be achieved through favours to Catholics and royal interference with parliamentary legislation. In 1675 Denbigh supported the earl of Shaftesbury and Lord Wharton in their attacks on the earl of Danby's repressive Anglican regime, protesting especially against the bill against persons disaffected from the government. His attendance was patchy after mid-May 1675, perhaps because of fading health, and he died at Dunstable, Bedfordshire, on 28 November 1675, on his way from London to the midlands. He was buried at Monks Kirby, Warwickshire. He had left no will and the administration of his estates was granted to his nephew and heir, William, third earl of Denbigh.<br>
<br>For forty years Basil Feilding had played a secondary but significant role in English politics, diplomacy, and government. He had been a court favourite, a failed diplomat, a mediocre general, an energetic servant of parliament's committees and the English republic, and finally, it seems, a country peer. He had displayed embarrassing but seemingly shameless self-interest, alongside examples of magnanimity and public service. He remains an enigma.<br>
