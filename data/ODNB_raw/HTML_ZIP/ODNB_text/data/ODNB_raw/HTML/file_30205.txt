<span class="headword">Yeardley,  John</span>  (1786&#150;1858), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was the son of Joel and Frances Yeardley, small dairy farmers at Orgreave, near Rotherham, Yorkshire, where he was born on 3 January 1786. He was admitted a member of the Society of Friends in his twentieth year, entered a manufactory in Barnsley, Yorkshire, and in 1809 married Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dunn, a convinced Quaker much his senior. He began preaching in 1815, moving from place to place in the northern counties.<br>
<br>In 1821 Elizabeth Yeardley died, and, led by a persistent &#145;call&#146;, Yeardley decided to settle in Lower Saxony, where a small body of Friends existed. To maintain himself, he arranged to represent some merchants who imported linen yarn, and later on he began bleaching on his own account. His philanthropic work included establishing schools and meetings for the young, and many notable people, including the prince and princess of Prussia, came to hear him preach. In 1824 he accompanied <a href="#cosubject_54972">Martha Savory [<i>see below</i>]</a>, an English Quaker, on a gospel journey up the Rhine from Elberfeld in the north to W&uuml;rttemberg, T&uuml;bingen, and other German towns, through Switzerland to Congeni&egrave;s in central France, where some Friends were settled. They visited Pastor Fliedner at Kaiserswerth, and all the principal religious and philanthropic institutions on their route. On reaching London they were married at Gracechurch Street meeting on 13 December 1826, soon resuming their missionary work in Pyrmont, Friesland, and Switzerland, and visiting asylums, reformatories, and Moravian schools.<br>
<br>During a short time spent in England both Yeardley and his wife studied modern Greek in preparation for a visit to the Ionian Islands, for which they started on 21 June 1833. They were warmly received by De Pressens&eacute; in Paris, and by Professor Ehrmann and Cuvier, the naturalist, at Strasbourg. In Corfu they established a girls' school, as well as a model farm, obtaining from the authorities there a grant of land on which prisoners were permitted to supply the labour.<br>
<br>After eight years at home, spent in studying languages, in 1842 the Yeardleys returned for the fourth time to France and Germany. In 1850, during a stay in Berlin, they became acquainted with Neander, the historian. Following Martha Yeardley's death in 1851, her husband continued his travels to Norway in 1852, and to southern Russia and Constantinople in 1853.<br>
<br>In his seventy-second year Yeardley began to study Turkish, and started for the East on 15 June 1858. After some work in Constantinople, and while preparing to visit the interior of Asia Minor, he was smitten with paralysis at Isnik, and was compelled to return to England, where he died on 11 August 1858 at Stamford Hill, London. He was buried nearby at Stoke Newington on the 18th.<br>
<br>Racy humour, with occasional lapses into his broad native Barnsley dialect, added to his uncompromising directness, did Yeardley good service as a preacher. His achievements in preaching without interpreters in various languages were remarkable, considering that his early education included no Latin. He used tracts largely as a vehicle for spreading the gospel. These, written and sometimes translated by himself, were founded upon incidents and characters met with during his travels. They are catalogued by Smith.<br>
<br>His second wife, <a name="cosubject_54972"></a><span class="headword">Martha Yeardley</span>  (1781&#150;1851)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 8 March 1781, the daughter of Joseph and Anna Savory. Both before and after her marriage she wrote several works in verse and prose, notably <span class="italic">Inspiration</span> (1805); <span class="italic">Poetical Tales Founded on Facts</span> (1808), reissued as <span class="italic">Pathetic Tales</span> (1813); <span class="italic">Poetical Sketches of Scripture Characters</span> (1848); and <span class="italic">True Tales from Foreign Lands</span> (n.d.). With her husband she wrote <span class="italic">A Brief Memoir of Mary Anne Calame, with some Account of the Institution at Locle, Switzerland</span> (1835) and <span class="italic">Eastern Customs Illustrative of Scripture</span> (1842). <span class="italic">Extracts from the Letters of J. and M. Yeardley</span>, from the continent, was published in 1835. She died on 8 May 1851 and was buried at Stoke Newington, Middlesex.<br>
