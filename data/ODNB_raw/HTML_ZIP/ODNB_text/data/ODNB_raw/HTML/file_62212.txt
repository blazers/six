<span class="headword">Griffith,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em> y Gohebydd]</span>  (1821&#150;1877), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 16 December 1821 at Bodgwilym, near Barmouth, Merioneth, the son of Griffith Griffith, a farmer, and his wife, Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Roberts. Through his mother he was nephew of the famous radical newspaper publisher the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23773/', "Revd Samuel Roberts")</script> of Llanbrynmair. After an elementary education in Barmouth and some early experience in the grocery trade, Griffith moved to London in 1847 as assistant to Hugh Owen, secretary of the Welsh Education Society. This position ended in 1849, and for the next decade Griffith returned to shopkeeping, opening his own business at 55 Camberwell Road in 1856, and writing occasional letters for his uncle's paper, <span class="italic">Y Cronicl</span>, under the pen name Wmffra Edward. In 1857, however, he began to write weekly letters for <span class="italic">Baner ac Amserau Cymru</span>, edited by Thomas Gee, and, in 1861, gave up the shop to concentrate on journalism as London correspondent of <span class="italic">Baner</span>, thereby becoming the first full-time Welsh correspondent.<br>
<br>Griffith, known henceforth as y Gohebydd (literally &#145;the correspondent&#146;), quickly established his reputation. His meticulously researched weekly column played a key role in awakening the interest of the Welsh people in politics during the 1860s. Alongside witty, radical commentaries on parliamentary affairs and accounts of his visits to America (1865&#150;7) and the Paris Exhibition (1867), he championed a series of &#145;Welsh&#146; causes, blending a celebration of the nation's cultural and historical heritage, the travails of contemporary nonconformists (who formed a majority of the population in Wales), the politics of the Liberal Party, and the representation of Wales in parliament. By these means, he did more than anyone else to dictate the markedly Welsh form taken by radical nonconformist politics at the general election of 1868.<br>
<br>This election was, perhaps, Gohebydd's finest hour. He campaigned hard on behalf of Liberal candidates like Henry Richard, a fellow metropolitan Welshman and Congregationalist, and hoped their triumph would lead to the creation of a &#145;Welsh Brigade&#146; to look after Welsh interests in parliament  (<span class="italic">Baner</span>, 23 Dec 1868, 4&#150;5). In the controversial aftermath of the election, when Conservative landowners in Wales apparently evicted tenants who had voted for Liberal candidates, Gohebydd was at the forefront of the campaign to secure redress for the victims. He organized a conference at Aberystwyth in October 1869 which established a fund to compensate those evicted and then toured the afflicted areas, publishing detailed accounts of the tenants' sufferings. The campaign lasted two years; it was in respect of his work at the election that, in 1875, Griffith was presented with a testimonial worth &pound;734 17<i>s</i>. <i>d</i>.<br>
<br>Gohebydd's success brought him considerable influence in other spheres. He was a reform-minded member of the national eisteddfod committee during the 1860s and became a member of the governing body of the new university at Aberystwyth when it opened in 1872. Within the Welsh community in London he was similarly prominent, being part of the delegation which waited on the home secretary in 1862 to protest against the revised code, and another which met Garibaldi in 1864. It is some mark of his popularity that John Thomas, the Liverpool photographer who specialized in retailing <i>carte-de-visite</i> portraits of famous nonconformist ministers, also advertised one of Gohebydd.<br>
<br>A slight, earnest man, Gohebydd never enjoyed good health. Samuel Morley, after meeting him in 1868, referred to him as &#145;the little man that coughs&#146;  (D. Tecwyn Lloyd, 211); in 1875, he paid for him to winter in Switzerland, but the end was not long delayed, and Griffith died, unmarried, on 13 December 1877 at his sister's house, 6 Thackeray Street, Liverpool. He was buried in the Fron cemetery, Llangollen, and was escorted to his final resting place by a procession, it was said, the like of which the town had never seen.<br>
