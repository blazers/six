<span class="headword">Nassau van Zuylestein,  William  van</span>, second earl of Rochford  (1681?&#150;1710), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Zuylestein, near Utrecht, probably in late 1681, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30311/', "William Frederick van Nassau van Zuylestein, first earl of Rochford (1649&#150;1708)")</script>, army officer, and his wife, Jane (<i>bap</i>. 1659), daughter of Sir Henry Wroth of Durrants, Enfield, Middlesex. Following his father's elevation to the peerage as earl of Rochford, he was styled Lord Tunbridge. In 1696, when still aged under sixteen, he was naturalized by act of parliament. He embarked on a military career, and served as a volunteer in the campaign in the duke of Ormond's expedition against Cadiz in 1702 and in Flanders in 1703; he was made a brevet colonel on the Irish establishment a year on. However, the campaign of 1704 saw him in Flanders as an aide-de-camp to the duke of Marlborough, his father having &#145;hurried me into this field&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, 8.74). In August 1704 he carried the official report of the battle of Blenheim to Queen Anne, and rather than join Ormond in Ireland he seems to have tarried in London during the winter of 1704&#150;5 and then travelled to Flanders in the following summer.<br>
<br>In 1705 Tunbridge was elected a member of the Irish parliament for Kilkenny owing to Ormond's influence. Ormond also helped to procure him the lieutenant-colonelcy of a newly raised regiment of foot guards in December 1705. In April 1706 he obtained the colonelcy of a regiment of foot, and in 1707 a regiment of dragoons. At the general election of 1708 Tunbridge was returned for Steyning, but his tenure of the seat was cut short by the death of his father on 30 June, before the parliament met. On the day following his father's death, Rochford wrote from Zuylestein to Marlborough hoping for the duke's support in the continuation of his father's pension of &pound;1000 out of the Post Office revenues. Rochford took his seat in the Lords on 16 November 1708, but did not get the pension he craved. On 1 January 1710 he was promoted brigadier-general, and went via Italy to Spain, where he was killed at the battle of Almenara on 27 July 1710. As he was unmarried, the earldom devolved upon his brother.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_30310"></a><span class="headword">Frederick  van Nassau van Zuylestein</span>, third earl of Rochford  (1682/3&#150;1738), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was the second son of William Frederick van Nassau van Zuylestein and his wife, Jane Wroth. Like his brother he was naturalized by act of parliament in 1696. He succeeded his brother as third earl on 27 July 1710, and an early assessment by Robert Harley judged him as &#145;doubtful&#146; in his attitude to the whig ministry in the House of Lords. He does not seem to have attended in the 1713 session of parliament.<br>
<br>Rochford married, on 3 August 1714, Elizabeth (Bessy) Savage (1698/9&#150;1746), illegitimate daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24723/', "Richard Savage, fourth Earl Rivers")</script>, and Elizabeth Colleton, who brought him a country residence at St Osyth Priory, Essex. They had two sons and three daughters. He seems to have been interested in politics only intermittently, as in May 1717 Harley (now earl of Oxford) was uncertain how he would stand on his impeachment &#145;if in England&#146;, but in the event Rochford supported Oxford's acquittal. Perhaps in order to retain his support the whig ministry then gave him a pension of &pound;600 p.a. in July 1717. Rochford died on 14 June 1738 at his London house in Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, and was buried at Easton, Suffolk, the seat of his younger brother, Henry (<i>d</i>. 1741). His wife married the Revd Philip Carter and died on 23 June 1746, by which a reputed &pound;4000 p.a. devolved upon her eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30312/', "William Henry van Nassau van Zuylestein, fourth earl of Rochford")</script>.<br>
