<span class="headword">Canton,  William</span>  (1845&#150;1926), <span class="occ">poet and journalist</span>, the eldest son of Thomas Canton of the colonial civil service and his wife, Mary Thomas, was born on 27 October 1845 on the island of Chushan, off the coast of China. His father died in Jamaica when he was nine, and his schooldays were spent in France, where &#145;the sudden discovery of a cromlech in a cornfield inspired him with a passion for antiquity&#146;, which became perhaps the most individual quality of his writing. His parents were Catholics, and for a while he studied for the priesthood at the Benedictine College at Douai in Picardy. But as a young man he left the Roman Catholic church and became a protestant. Early friendships, and the estrangement inevitable from his change of faith, found utterance in the lyric &#145;The Comrades&#146; (published in a collection of the same name, 1902) and in his beautiful story &#145;The Lost Brother&#146; (published in <span class="italic">A Child's Book of Saints</span>, 1898). From 1867 he was a teacher and journalist in London. In 1873 his long poem &#145;Through the Ages: the Legend of a Stone Axe&#146;, published in the <span class="italic">New Quarterly Magazine</span>, aroused T. H. Huxley's enthusiasm as &#145;the first attempt to use the raw material of science&#146; for poetry. In 1874 Canton married Emma (<i>d</i>. 1880), daughter of Charles Moore. The only child of the marriage, a daughter, died in 1877 and was commemorated in <span class="italic">The Invisible Playmate</span> (1894), the first prose work which won him recognition.<br>
<br>In 1876 Canton began fifteen years of writing for papers in Glasgow, initially as editor of the <span class="italic">Glasgow Weekly Herald</span> and then as sub-editor and leader writer of the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>, which made many assume him to be a Scot&#151;and as such he was attacked in T. W. H. Crosland's diatribe <span class="italic">The Unspeakable Scot</span>. In 1882 he married his second wife, Annie Elizabeth, daughter of John Ingham Taylor of Manchester, a civil engineer; a daughter, Winifred Vida, was born in 1890 and a son, Guy Desmond, in 1896. In 1891 Canton went to London as general manager to the publishers Isbister &amp; Co., and shortly after became sub-editor of the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> and editor of the <span class="italic">Sunday Magazine</span>. He also wrote a large amount of prose and verse for <span class="italic">Good Words</span>. However, he made his reputation by his own independent work. <span class="italic">A Lost Epic and other Poems</span> appeared in 1887 and won the admiration of Max M&uuml;ller, T. E. Brown, and Walter Pater. The &#145;W. V.&#146; (Winifred Vida) books&#151;<span class="italic">The Invisible Playmate</span> (1894), <span class="italic">W. V. her Book</span> (1896), <span class="italic">A Child's Book of Saints</span> (1898), <span class="italic">In Memory of W. V.</span> (1901)&#151;gained him a large public.<br>
<br>Winifred Vida died in 1901, and Canton then undertook the task of writing the official <span class="italic">History of the British and Foreign Bible Society</span> in the hope that the heavy workload would prove an anodyne. It occupied nine years of conscientious labour, and when he at last emerged into literary daylight he found himself all but forgotten. Thereafter, his work was all definitely commissioned. Much was in small popular books for the Bible Society, the last being finished, with the exception of the final chapter, the night before he died. Imaginative relief came rarely to him, but it did so notably in <span class="italic">The Story of St Elizabeth of Hungary</span> (1912). He was granted a civil-list pension in 1912, and in 1925 his friends collected a sum to mark his eightieth birthday. In the same year, Ernest Benn Ltd published a short selection of his verse in their <span class="roman">Augustan</span> series, compiled mainly by his lifelong friend and admirer Edward J. Thompson, the first author of this memoir. On 2 May 1926 Canton died at Hendon, London, where he had lived since 1912.<br>
<br>Canton's verse lacked lyrical impulse, except in the elegiac poems included in <span class="italic">In Memory of W. V.</span> An earlier generation considered his poems of childhood his finest achievement, but a later age may well consider them marred by a cult of the trivial, the domestic, or the merely pretty. His longer poems are of two kinds: classical, influenced, but remaining individual, by Tennyson's &#145;Oenone&#146; and &#145;Tithonus&#146; and, still more, by Robert Browning's &#145;Cleon&#146; and &#145;Artemis Prologises&#146;; and those that must be termed antiquarian. The latter are a good expression of the immense change in imaginative outlook which followed the mid-Victorian discovery of the almost immeasurable antiquity of man and of animal life generally. The &#145;W. V.&#146; books are the best of his prose works, written in a whimsical, light style, allusive in a poetical and not merely scholarly fashion, and often profoundly moving. His eager, courageous spirit, which expression in literature was so often clogged and jaded, showed itself in his private letters; very few who received his correspondence destroyed any of it, notably the first author of this piece himself.<br>
