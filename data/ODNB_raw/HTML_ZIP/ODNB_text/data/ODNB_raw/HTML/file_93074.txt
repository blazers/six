<span class="headword">Jarrin,  William Alexis <span class="st"> [Guglielmo Alexis]</span></span>  (1784&#150;1848), <span class="occ">confectioner and author</span>, was born in Colorno, near Parma, in northern Italy, on 25 March 1784, the son of William Alexis Jarrin, merchant. Nothing more is known about his family, though the surname suggests they were not of Italian origin. Jarrin's early years coincided with the French occupation of northern Italy in 1796&#150;7. Perhaps this offered opportunities, for he recorded that he worked in Paris early in his career as a confectioner. He referred to having made a sugar sculpture of Napoleon for one of the town banquets given by the city of Paris (1806 or 1807) and to having worked in the imperial household. He seems to have remained in France until 1817, when he came to England. By 1819 he was employed as confectioner and ornament maker for James Gunter's, confectioners, in Berkeley Square, London.<br>
<br>In 1820 Jarrin published <span class="italic">The Italian Confectioner</span>, through which he is best known. The book sits within an English tradition of publishing recipes for food and confectionery, but it reveals more about the techniques involved, and about the character of the author, than was usual in the genre. Written when confectionery production was on the point of being industrialized through the activities of such contemporaries as Joseph Terry of York, it represented the high point of artisan skills in the craft, which Jarrin believed could not be improved upon. He devoted several chapters to his speciality of making ornaments for the dessert table using various edible and non-edible materials. Other chapters covered more standard ground including recipes for small confections, preserving fruit, and making ices, but with details which throw light on both his own skills and continental practice. He provided instructions on modelling and wood carving (one wooden confectionery mould signed by him has come to light), and evidently possessed artistic talents, for he signed the two engraved plates illustrating confectionery equipment. Proud of his ingenuity as an inventor, Jarrin described inventions and improvements he had devised for making confectionery. <span class="italic">The Italian Confectioner</span> was reprinted at least ten times (the last in 1861, after his death), and was updated with new material on several occasions. Earlier editions incorporated small but often telling additions: for example, observations on managing ice-wells and the introduction of new instruments such as the saccharometer. For the 1844 edition he undertook a major reorganization of the material and added many new recipes.<br>
<br>By 1822 Jarrin had established his own shop at 123 New Bond Street, London (also his residence), and by 1827 was married and had a family, although details remain obscure. He was a widower at the time of his marriage, on 17 August 1837, to Susan (<i>b</i>. 1804/5), daughter of John Rogers; she apparently worked alongside him. One daughter, Maria, is named in his will. An engraved portrait, dated 1827, shows him wearing the order of the Cross of Fidelity, established by Louis XVIII, an indication that he retained influential contacts abroad, despite changes in regime. His English clientele also included a number of prominent persons. He catered for some fashionable events, including the first public breakfast organized by the Horticultural Society at Chiswick in 1827. In that year he obtained a patent (no. 5539, 13 Aug 1827) for a device for cooling water or fruit in which a sealed container of ice and salt was placed inside an outer container (a principle now exploited by the modern cool box).<br>
<br>After a period of expansion in his business (including venturing into dealing in wines), Jarrin became insolvent and was declared bankrupt on 11 November 1828. He was allowed to continue trading, but subsequent attempts to rebuild his business were only partially successful. They included a move to open a restaurant and caf&eacute; in Regent Street Quadrant, but in 1834 he was declared bankrupt once more. For a short time he had premises in Tichbourne Street, but appears to have ceased trading by 1836. From this point Jarrin's career once more becomes obscure. A tendency towards impetuousness and possibly arrogance is hinted at in some sources, and there was evidently a family quarrel. His will, which left everything to his wife, gives no clue to his material circumstances, but mentions an estrangement between his daughter Maria and her mother. Jarrin died of cancer of the pylorus at his home, 22 Cambridge Street, Hyde Park, London, on 11 May 1848 and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. His book was eventually superseded by William Jeanes's <span class="italic">The Modern Confectioner</span> (1861).<br>
