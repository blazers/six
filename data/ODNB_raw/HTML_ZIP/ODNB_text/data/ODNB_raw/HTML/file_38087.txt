<span class="headword">Neck, Sir  Joshua  van</span>, first baronet  (1702&#150;1777), <span class="occ">merchant and financier</span>, was born in The Hague on 5 January 1702, one of the six sons of Cornelis van Neck, paymaster-general of the land forces of the United Provinces, and his wife, Anna de Greeff. Four of his five brothers followed their father into public service, most conspicuously Lambert, pensionary of Rotterdam, and Abraham, attorney-general of the province of Holland. In 1718 another older brother, Gerard, settled as a merchant in London, where Joshua joined him in 1722, first as assistant and later as partner. In 1732 van Neck married Marianne, daughter of Stephen Daubuz, a Huguenot merchant of London. They had two sons and four daughters, of whom Elizabeth married Thomas Walpole, MP and merchant of London, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28595/', "Horatio Walpole, first Baron Walpole of Wolterton")</script>; and her sister Margaret married his brother Richard Walpole, London banker and MP.<br>
<br>The firm of Gerard and Joshua van Neck was a general merchant, but unusually active in placing the capital of fellow Dutchmen (and other continentals) in the British public funds and company shares. The sums so entrusted made it a power among London houses subscribing to public loans, particularly during the wars of 1744&#150;63. Already one of the four leading underwriters in 1744, it was to be one of the two houses that arranged the closed subscription loans to the government in the difficult winters of 1745&#150;6 and 1757&#151;loans subsequently attacked by Sir John Barnard as too favourable to the promoters. In all known surviving lists of such subscriptions in the 1750s and 1760s (1757, 1759, 1767), the Van Neck firm took the largest share. It was also an important military remittance contractor during the Seven Years' War.<br>
<br>The van Necks had developed valuable trading and political connections in France, particularly with the Parisian Protestant firm of Thellusson, Necker &amp; Co., which was able to get them recognized as agents of the French court. Their greatest coup was the highly remunerative commission to buy tobacco in London in 1730&#150;65 for the French tobacco monopoly (which then imported most of its leaf from Britain). So important was this and so adept were the participants that the farmers-general and the van Necks were able to persuade both the French and British governments to permit the continued shipment of British tobacco to France during the wars of 1744&#150;8 and 1756&#150;63. This traffic also permitted the firm to act as a channel of communications between the two governments in wartime. For his financial and other services Joshua van Neck was created a baronet on 14 December 1751.<br>
<br>The childless Gerard van Neck died on 17 August 1750, leaving an estate estimated at &pound;240,000, almost three-fifths of which went to his brother Joshua. In 1750 the firm was reorganized as a partnership between van Neck, his son-in-law Thomas Walpole, and D. J. Olivier. In 1765 Walpole broke with his father-in-law and set up his own firm, carrying off the French tobacco contract in the process. Even so, van Neck could be described at his death as &#145;one of the richest merchants in Europe&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>). If, in the lifetime of Gerard, their family world appeared to be very much that of the Dutch Reformed and Huguenot expatriate communities in London, their social horizons expanded considerably after the Walpole marriages. Van Neck died on 5 March 1777 and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his elder son, Gerard.<br>
