<span class="headword">Barron,  (Mabel) Phyllis</span>  (1890&#150;1964), <span class="occ">designer and textile printer</span>, was born on 19 March 1890 in Taplow, Buckinghamshire, the younger of two daughters of Walter Barron and his wife, Alice Maud Marguerite, formerly Clark, of Taplow House, Taplow. She was to describe her family as &#145;rich&#146; and her father as &#145;something in the City&#146;  (Barron). Barron, as she was called by her friends, studied at the Slade School of Fine Art under Henry Tonks and Philip Wilson Steer before immersing herself in designing and printing textiles. Active between the two world wars, she produced furnishing and dress-stuffs together with her partner, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45803/', "Dorothy Larcher (1882&#150;1952)")</script>, which were noted for their distinctive designs hand block-printed in subtle colours on quality materials. The major collection of their work is held by the Crafts Study Centre collection and archive at the Surrey Institute of Art and Design, University College, Farnham.<br>
<br>Barron had first become interested in textile printing having discovered some French printing blocks. Information was difficult to obtain but two dye books by Edward Bancroft and William Crookes respectively proved to be invaluable. In 1915 she cut her first block and experimented avidly&#151;discharging patterns with nitric acid on indigo-dyed cloth, and printing with iron, rust, or cutch on linen and cotton.<br>
<br>In the early 1920s Dorothy Larcher joined Barron's workshop which moved shortly afterwards to 2 Parkhill Studios, Parkhill Road, Hampstead. Recalling his first meeting with both women in 1938 the etcher and educationist Robin Tanner referred to their partnership as &#145;a marriage of true minds&#146;  (Roscoe, 1993, 123&#150;4). Describing Barron as &#145;a tall, large, handsome, commanding figure with fine eyes and brow, cropped silver hair, a beautiful outgoing expression and a warm lovely voice&#146; he also remembered her <i>joie de vivre</i>, energy, fresh wit, and creative mind which combined with a high sense of standard made her an exuberant and forceful personality  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Barron and Larcher moved to Hambutts House, Edge Road, Painswick, Gloucestershire, in 1930. It was a beautiful Georgian house with a stable block which they converted into a workshop with a large indigo vat. These were years of expansion and they experimented with overprinting and the use of synthetic dyes, employing women from the village to help with printing and sewing.<br>
<br>The Little Gallery run by Muriel Rose was Barron's and Larcher's main sales outlet in London following their move to the Cotswolds. They also exhibited regularly with the Red Rose Guild in Manchester and the Gloucestershire Guild of Craftsmen. The duke of Westminster had been an early and most influential patron commissioning all the materials for his yacht <i>The Flying Cloud</i> and introducing their work to a wealthy and discerning clientele. Other commissions included the new library and fellows' senior common room at Girton College, Cambridge, and curtaining for the choir stalls at Winchester Cathedral.<br>
<br>The outbreak of the Second World War ended production and Barron turned to local government work, parish affairs, and education. Her obituary recorded that:<blockquote>She took a leading&#151;although never obtrusive&#151;part in the life of Painswick, giving valued help as the chairman of the horticultural section of the Painswick show, as a member of the Painswick Food Production Society, as a member and for a while chairman of the Painswick Parish Council, as a member of the Gyde Home Committee and in other ways, while in a wider sphere she was for 22 years a member of the Stroud rural district council. She served for a considerable time as the chairman of the Council's Building Plans Committee and was the vice chairman of the Area Planning Committee. In addition she represented the Council on the Stroud Museum Committee, the Stroud Educational Foundation and other bodies. (<span class="italic">Gloucestershire Echo</span>, 25 Nov 1964)</blockquote>Barron's death at Hambutts, Edge Road, Painswick, on 23 November 1964 followed a severe bout of influenza. She was cremated three days later at Cheltenham crematorium and her ashes scattered there in the rock and water garden. Examples of her textiles are in the Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester; Cheltenham Museums and Art Gallery; and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.<br>
