<span class="headword">Welchman,  Edward</span>  (1665&#150;1739), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious writer</span>, was the son of John Welchman, gentleman, of Banbury, Oxfordshire. He matriculated as a commoner from Magdalen Hall, Oxford, on 7 July 1679 and was one of the choristers of Magdalen College from 1679 until 1682. He graduated BA on 24 April 1683 and was admitted a probationer fellow of Merton College in 1684; he graduated MA on 19 June 1688.<br>
<br>In 1690 Merton presented Welchman to the rectory of Lapworth, Warwickshire, in which county he was also rector of Berkeswell. At Lapworth eleven children born to him and his wife, Mary, were baptized between 1696 and 1719, the first being John, on 7 July 1696. Welchman was made archdeacon of Cardigan and a prebendary of St David's on 7 August 1727. He was later appointed chaplain to the bishop of Lichfield, who made him a prebendary of Wolvey in that cathedral on 28 September 1732; Welchman remembered the bishop in his will and left him a thirteen-volume Hebrew <span class="roman">Bible</span>. Welchman went on to gain the rectory of Solihull, Warwickshire, in 1736, which he held until his death.<br>
<br>Welchman published widely on religious subjects; his works include a piece against the nonjuring bishops in 1691, a sermon on charity in 1707, a popular anti-Roman Catholic tract in 1719, and a contribution to the Arian debate in 1721. His main work is his edition of the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>. It was first published in Latin as <span class="italic">XXXIX articuli ecclesiae Anglicanae</span> (1713); an English translation from the sixth edition appeared in 1740 as <span class="italic">The Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England, Illustrated with Notes</span>. The English version proved particularly successful; it was reprinted regularly throughout the eighteenth century and well into the next.<br>
<br>Welchman's <span class="italic">Husbandman's Manual</span> (1695) was also very popular. In it he gives a prayer for every countryside activity, from sowing and ploughing to the singing of the birds. The manual went through eighteen editions in the eighteenth century and, like the edition of the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, was reprinted in the nineteenth century; it was translated into Welsh in 1711 and was one of the works distributed by the SPCK.<br>
<br>Welchman died on 19 May 1739 and was survived by his wife, who inherited most of his estate, in the manors of Balsall and Knowle, and in the parish of Tamworth. Of their large family only five&#151;Samuel, Richard, Mary, Anne, and Constance&#151;are mentioned in Welchman's will of 30 April 1739.<br>
