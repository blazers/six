<span class="headword">Osborne,  Peter</span>  (1521&#150;1592), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the second son of Richard Osborne of Tyld Hall, Lachingdon, Essex, and his wife, Elizabeth Coke. His family had long been settled at Purleigh in Essex. Osborne was possibly educated at Cambridge University. He entered Lincoln's Inn in 1543, becoming associate bencher in 1566 and assistant governor in 1570.<br>
<br>Osborne probably married, before 1551, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1615), daughter of Dr John Blythe, regius professor of physic at Cambridge, and niece of Sir John Cheke. The couple had eleven sons, including John (1551&#150;1628), Christopher (1557/8&#150;1600), who were both MPs, and Henry Osborne (<i>b</i>. 1557/8, <i>d</i>. in or after 1648), and eleven daughters. John Osborne was the father of <a href="#cosubject_20881">Sir Peter Osborne [<i>see below</i>]</a> and the writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20875/', "Francis Osborne (1593&#150;1659)")</script>. Peter Osborne's political success is probably attributable to his connection with two important men, William Cecil, Lord Burghley, and Cheke. Marriage ties and religious convictions established and reinforced his friendships with both men. Cecil became Osborne's parliamentary patron, turning to his fellow protestant Francis Russell, second earl of Bedford, to secure a seat for him. Osborne was returned as MP for Tregony in Cornwall in 1559, although he may have been elected to Bridport in Dorset as early as March 1553, when he was described as &#145;toward the Pryve Chamber, and a great officer in the Eschequier, being also of right good estymacion &amp; lernyng, and one who in that place maye doe your towne mouche good&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sixth Report</span>, HMC, 1.497). Cheke's position at court as chamberlain of the exchequer and principal secretary ensured that Osborne obtained lucrative offices in the exchequer under Edward VI. In 1551 Osborne was appointed clerk of the faculties and keeper of the privy purse. From 1552 to 1553, and again from 1559 until his death, he was the lord treasurer's remembrancer in the exchequer. He probably supported Lady Jane Grey in July 1553, for he was reported to have been in prison at some time during Mary I's reign. This seems probable because of his close association with John Dudley, duke of Northumberland, from autumn 1552. Cheke and Osborne were certainly close friends, even after Mary's accession: Cheke appointed him one of his executors and died at his house in Wood Street, London, in September 1557. Osborne's daughter Katherine later married Cheke's grandson Sir Thomas Cheke.<br>
<br>Osborne again rose to prominence in the country's financial affairs under Elizabeth I, because he was considered &#145;an authority upon commercial matters&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). In 1560, the same year in which he became involved in royal minting activities, the queen granted him the manor of South Fambridge, Essex. By 1562 Osborne had relocated from Wood Street to Ivy Lane, London, possibly to accommodate his growing household. In 1562 he became an ecclesiastical commissioner. He was added to the quorum of the peace for Middlesex at about the same time. His other posts included deputy governor of the Society of Mineral and Battery Works in 1568. Osborne was commissioner for disputes with Portugal in 1573 and for piracy in 1580. Burghley continued to be Osborne's primary patron, ensuring that he was elected as MP for Horsham, Sussex, in 1563, Guildford, Surrey, in 1571, Plympton Eagle, Devon, in 1572, Aldeburgh, Suffolk, in 1584 and 1586, and Burghley's own borough, Westminster, in 1589. During Elizabeth's reign, Osborne corresponded with Burghley, principally about commercial matters. They discussed merchant contractors, wine transport from the Netherlands to Spain, and contracts for the carriage of salt. By January 1578 Burghley had secured the reversion of lord treasurer's remembrancer to Osborne's eldest son, John Osborne. Peter Osborne was triumphant, for he considered that office the &#145;stay of his house, his wife and his children&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 2.177).<br>
<br>Beginning in 1576 Osborne began to purchase from Edward Snowe parts of the priory of Chicksands in Bedfordshire, a house of the Gilbertine order with two cloisters. He never established a residence there, leaving this task instead to John Osborne. He died on 7 June 1592 and was buried at St Faith's under St Paul's. His widow died in 1615.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_20881"></a><span class="headword">Sir Peter Osborne</span>  (1584/5&#150;1653), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the eldest of five sons of Sir John Osborne (1551&#150;1628), administrator, of Chicksands, and his wife, Dorothy (1561/2&#150;1638), eldest daughter and heir of Richard Barlee of Elsenham Hall, Essex. He had one sister and was named after his grandfather. Sir John Osborne purchased Chicksands outright before 1600, making it his principal residence. There he restored Campton church, built a vicarage, and constructed a family mausoleum. His other sons included Christopher (<i>d</i>. 1635&times;40), Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1651), and Richard Osborne (<i>d</i>. 1634). Peter Osborne was admitted as a fellow-commoner of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 11 July 1603. On 20 February 1610 he married Dorothy (1590&#150;1650/51), the sixth and youngest daughter of Sir John Danvers of Dauntsey, Wiltshire, and his wife, Elizabeth. His wife's brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7133/', "Henry Danvers, first Baron Danvers of Dauntsey and first earl of Danby (1573&#150;1644)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7135/', "Sir John Danvers (1584/5&#150;1655)")</script>, of Chelsea. Osborne was knighted on 7 January 1611. In 1621 he was appointed lieutenant-governor of Guernsey, with the governorship reverting to him on Danvers of Dauntsey's death. He thereafter took up residence at Castle Cornet, a small fort guarding the approach to the harbour of St Peter Port. It is doubtful that his wife and children ever lived there with him. He was MP for Corfe Castle, Dorset, in 1623&#150;4 and 1625. On his father's death on 2 November 1628, he succeeded to the office of lord treasurer's remembrancer and his family took up residence at Chicksands. At this time he had nine children: Thomas (1609&#150;1637), Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1610, <i>d</i>. in or after 1631), Ann (1613&#150;1642), Henry (1614&#150;1645), Sir John Osborne, baronet (<i>c</i>.1615&#150;1699), Sir Henry Osborne (1619&#150;1675), Charles (1620&#150;1642), Robert (1626&#150;<i>c</i>.1653), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27109/', "Dorothy Osborne (1627&#150;1695)")</script>, who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27122/', "Sir William Temple")</script>. There were other children, who all died young. Sir Peter Osborne spent most of his time away from his family, fulfilling his duties at Guernsey, where he was in charge of 200 soldiers. When he did go to London to report to the council of war, he often visited his wife and her relations at the earl of Danby's house. From November 1640 to August 1641 he was possibly resident in Chelsea. On 23 April 1640 he advanced &pound;1000 to Charles I, who was desperate for money.<br>
<br>When hostilities began between king and parliament in 1642, Osborne determined to take his family to the safety of Guernsey. However, Guernsey chose to side with parliament and Osborne held Castle Cornet for the king. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23494/', "Robert Rich, second earl of Warwick (1587&#150;1658)")</script>, became the governor of Guernsey in 1643 and several times ordered Osborne to surrender Castle Cornet. Osborne refused his old friend and kinsman in the most courteous terms and continued to hold out for aid from Charles. This assistance never materialized despite many assurances. Osborne and his men were in dire straits after the castle was besieged from March 1643, for they had always relied on Guernsey's residents for their sustenance. When he took over at Castle Cornet, his wife had retreated with her children to the safety of St Malo. She was soon forced to sell her plate and to contract heavy debts in order to aid her husband's plight. She became ill towards the end of 1643 and left St Malo with her children on a Dutch ship for England. Since Chicksands had been sequestered by order of the parliamentary committee for delinquencies on 27 April 1643, Dorothy Osborne took her children to live with her brother Sir John Danvers, a parliamentarian. There they met Oliver Cromwell, who reportedly favoured Osborne's youngest daughter, Dorothy. In early 1646 Osborne retreated exhausted to exile in St Malo after Sir Thomas Fanshawe was given command of Castle Cornet. His daughter Dorothy visited him there from 1648 until summer 1649. <i>En route</i> she stayed on the Isle of Wight, where she met her future husband, William Temple. At the time of her marriage in 1654 she recorded that her father's income exceeded &pound;4000 per annum. Her own portion may have been up to &pound;4000.<br>
<br>Sir Peter Osborne concealed some 41 per cent of the real value of his Chicksands estate and his fine was more manageable at &pound;2440. In April 1649 his fourth son, Henry Osborne, attempted to compound for delinquency in order to regain Chicksands. On 29 May 1649 Sir Peter Osborne compounded for his delinquency for &#145;bearing arms in the first war against Parliament&#146;  (Green, <span class="italic">Calendar of the Proceedings of the Committee for Compounding</span>, 3.1974). His estate was discharged after the payment of a fine on 4 June 1650. There was also some trouble after his death over the reversion of Pickering rectory, Yorkshire, and over the manor of North Fambridge, Essex. Osborne effectively overturned his father's wishes regarding Chicksands and North Fambridge. Sir John Osborne's will of 1626 stipulated that his widow should enjoy possession of Chicksands for life, with reversion to Osborne, and that North Fambridge was to be divided between his four younger sons. After his father's death in 1628, Sir Peter Osborne convinced his mother to live in London with his brother Thomas Osborne and entered into the manor of North Fambridge and his father's other estates in Essex. He dispossessed his brothers. His youngest brother, Francis Osborne, and his nephew Richard Osborne initiated a chancery suit against his son Sir Henry Osborne. The chancery verdict of 27 March 1655 was for Sir Henry Osborne, and Francis Osborne was left the embittered author of <span class="italic">Advice to a Son</span> (1656).<br>
<br>Sir Peter Osborne made his will on 26 February 1650. A previous conveyance had already disposed of all his lands and the will allocated his personal goods, which he left, primarily to his wife and his heir, as his executors. Osborne also gave bequests of &pound;10 each to two male servants, the poor of Campton, and the men to whom he had entrusted his estates. He directed that several of the hangings, two portraits (which had belonged to his grandfather Sir Peter Osborne), and his entire library at Chicksands should be handed down in perpetuity through the male line as heirlooms. He died in March 1653.<br>
