<span class="headword">Collins,  William Edward</span>  (1867&#150;1911), <span class="occ">bishop of Gibraltar</span>, was born in London on 18 February 1867, the second son in a family of five sons and four daughters of Joseph Henry Collins, mining engineer and writer on geology, and his wife, Frances Miriam Denny (<i>d</i>. 1888), who was born in Ireland. Collins had his early education at Mr Nuttall's Collegiate School in Lemon Street, Truro, Cornwall, where his family had moved soon after his birth. The family in 1881 relocated to Spain, where his father had taken up a position with Rio Tinto Mines. Collins learned Spanish, of great use in his later career, and enjoyed his period in the country, but returned to England early and lodged with his eldest brother, who had remained there. After a short period as a lawyer's clerk, Collins decided to study with a view to holy orders. He spent some time at the Chancellor's School, Truro, and became reacquainted with Canon Arthur James Mason, whom the family had known earlier in Truro and who later became master of Pembroke College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>In 1884 Collins was able, through financial support organized by Canon Mason, to proceed to Selwyn College, Cambridge, and graduated BA as junior optime in the mathematical tripos of 1887, proceeding MA in 1891 and DD in 1903. His later studies concentrated upon church history. He was much influenced by the teaching of Mandell Creighton, then Dixie professor of ecclesiastical history. In 1889 Collins won the Lightfoot scholarship in ecclesiastical history, and in 1890 the prince consort's prize. In the same year he was ordained deacon, and priest in 1891, serving his first curacy under Canon Mason, who invited him to become a mission preacher at All Hallows Barking by the Tower. He continued to combine his historical study with the holding of missions and retreats, and in 1891 returned to Cambridge as lecturer at St John's College on international law and at Selwyn on divinity.<br>
<br>In 1893, at the age of twenty-six, Collins was appointed professor of ecclesiastical history at King's College, London. It was said of his teaching style that, like his method as a preacher, it &#145;was decidedly sympathetic, if not altogether virile&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 March 1911, 11). But Collins maintained a high level of publication of historical studies, including <span class="italic">The Authority of General Councils</span> (1896), <span class="italic">The English Reformation and its Consequences</span> (1898), and <span class="italic">Church and State in England before the Conquest</span> (1903). Along with Mandell Creighton he was one of the founders of the Church Historical Society. In 1894 he renewed his connection with All Hallows, where he took part in the celebration of the 250th anniversary of Archbishop Laud's execution (10 January 1895), subsequently editing a commemorative volume of lectures on Laud (published in the same year). His reputation as a student of historical documents steadily grew, and his advice on church questions was frequently sought. In May 1899, when the archbishops heard at Lambeth arguments for and against the liturgical use of incense, Collins was able to draw upon early and medieval authorities in his contribution, which largely settled the question on the side of those opposing its use.<br>
<br>On 26 January 1904 Collins married Mary Brewin Sterland (<i>d</i>. 1909), a governess many years his senior with whom he had had &#145;a very close and peculiar relation&#146; since his youth  (Mason, 65). They had no children.<br>
<br>His intellectual achievements, and his language skills, made Collins a suitable choice when a new bishop was required to be selected for Gibraltar in 1904. Collins accepted this appointment although his health was already delicate. His physical character was summed up by an early comment on his &#145;pale face, and his great eyes&#146;  (Mason, 9). His duties, which included not only the administration of the diocese of Gibraltar and Malta but also the supervision of the English chaplaincies and congregations in southern Europe, involved constant travelling. In 1907 he visited Persia and Asiatic Turkey for the archbishop of Canterbury's Assyrian Mission, and on his return published his journal, <span class="italic">Notes of a Journey to Kurdistan</span> (1908). At the same time he continued to contribute a good deal to the church at home. During the meetings in Britain of the Pan-Anglican Congress in June 1908 his encyclopaedic knowledge was frequently in evidence and much in demand, and he presided successfully over the debates on the Anglican communion. He also assisted Dr Randall Davidson, archbishop of Canterbury, in drafting an encyclical letter which was issued on behalf of the Lambeth conference in August that year. Davidson noted that in the most difficult aspects of that conference Collins &#145;bore a leading, sometimes even the foremost, part&#146;  (Mason, 186&#150;7).<br>
<br>The strain of travel and work produced a serious health breakdown for Collins in 1909, when he developed lung and throat trouble. His health never fully recovered and he died at sea on 22 March 1911 on his way to Smyrna, Turkey, after falling ill at the British embassy, Constantinople, with pleurisy and congestion of the lungs. He was buried on 27 March at St John's Church, Smyrna. A posthumous collection of his sermons was published in 1912.<br>
