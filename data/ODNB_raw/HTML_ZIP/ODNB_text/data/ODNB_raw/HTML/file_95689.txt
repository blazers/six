<span class="headword">Anderson,  Alfred</span>  (1896&#150;2005), <span class="occ">joiner and soldier</span>, was born on 25 June 1896 at 20 Kinloch Street, Dundee, the third son of Andrew Anderson (1864&#150;1945) and his wife, Christina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Emmerson (1868&#150;1945). His parents had emigrated to Chicago, Illinois, and were married there in 1888. However, nostalgia for Scotland or a downturn in the American economy sent them home in the 1890s. One of Alfred Anderson's earliest memories was associated with the celebrations accompanying the end of the South African War. Dundee was <i>en f&ecirc;te</i> and, at a victory parade, a sergeant picked him up and carried him on his shoulder through the cheering crowds. Soon afterwards the family left Dundee for the nearby planned village of Newtyle, over the Sidlaw Hills on the edge of Strathmore. Alfred went to school there and at the Harris Academy in Dundee. Meanwhile his father's business as an undertaker and joiner flourished. From an early age Alfred became used to the sight of bodies and helped with the &#145;coffining&#146; before funerals. The village &#145;killing house&#146; or abattoir also accustomed him to the ever-present slaughter of animals. He claimed that this long experience of death meant that the sights he encountered at the western front had a less powerful effect upon him than on many of his comrades.<br>
<br>In 1912 Anderson joined the Territorial Army for no other reason than that it would introduce him to friends, provide an opportunity for physical activities and sports, and, most important, offer a week's holiday during the annual camp in nearby locations in Perthshire. The 1914 camp was in late July, soon after Alfred turned eighteen, and most of the young men with whom he trained died in the trenches. With the outbreak of the First World War, these members of the Territorial Army were enrolled in the 5th battalion of the Black Watch, which recruited mainly in Perthshire and Angus. After a relatively brief training the battalion left for the front, crossed the channel in a cattle boat, and the kilted men found themselves laughed at and molested by village women as they marched through northern France.<br>
<br>For well over a year Anderson remained at the front, experiencing all the rigours of the trenches. He was batman to Lieutenant Bruce-Gardyne and then to Fergus Bowes-Lyon, the son of the earl of Strathmore and brother of Elizabeth, later Queen Elizabeth, the queen mother. Throughout this period the only relief for the troops was rest periods behind the lines. Anderson retained vivid memories of the sudden and unexpected peace of the Christmas truce, of the conditions in farms where they were billeted, of encounters with Indian soldiers, and many of the terrifying features of trench warfare. At the battle of Loos in September 1915 the Black Watch took severe casualties with Bowes-Lyon among the dead. Anderson, however, survived. Some weeks later he was injured by shrapnel at a forward listening post. Evacuated in great pain hours later, he was repatriated to a hospital in England. His war was over and his injuries saved him. Promoted sergeant, he became an army physical trainer at a camp in Yorkshire. There he met his future wife, Susannah Iddison (<i>d</i>. 1979), daughter of a watchmaker. They were married at St Andrew's Church, Kirkby Malzeard, near Ripon, on 2 June 1917, when both claimed to be twenty-one (though Anderson was in fact twenty). They had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>At the end of the war Anderson was keen to stay in the army with the rank of sergeant-major, but familial duties called. He was summoned home to take over the family business. His subsequent life was uneventful apart from a period running the Home Guard in Newtyle during the Second World War, but his great longevity was to bring him considerable fame in his last years. He lived long enough to become an emblem of the past and a representative of an entire generation. Although a few veterans of the First World War survived him, he was, by the end of his life, the last living member of the pre-1914 Territorial Army, the last soldier to have gone to war in the autumn of 1914, and the last survivor of the celebrated Christmas truce of that year. He became a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, and was repeatedly featured in newspapers, in television documentaries, and in a number of books about war veterans. His sharpness of mind, his great dignity, and his acute wit marked him out as a striking figure, physically active until he was past 105. The cricketer and artist Jack Russell painted his portrait when he was 107. Shown the result, Anderson said &#145;You've made me look older than I am&#146;  (private information). Lionized in the Black Watch, he enjoyed having generals pay court to him. The prince of Wales met him on several occasions, at Anderson's home and at regimental events, and he later unveiled a memorial to him in Alyth, where Anderson spent his final years, except for the last six weeks, which he spent at Mundamalla Nursing Home in nearby Newtyle. He died there of bronchopneumonia on 21 November 2005. His funeral, at Alyth parish church on 25 November, was attended by a representative of Prince Charles, the French consul-general, senior politicians, and army officers, as well as many soldiers past and present. Obituaries and accounts of the funeral were printed in the national newspapers and there were items on television news. His remains were cremated at Perth crematorium. He was survived by two daughters and two sons (one daughter having predeceased him), and by ten grandchildren, eighteen great-grandchildren, and two great-great-grandchildren.<br>
