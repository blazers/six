<span class="headword">Ealdred</span>  (<em>d.</em> 933?), <span class="occ">leader of the Northumbrians</span>, was the son of Eadulf and lord of Bamburgh. He was the most important Anglo-Saxon in Northumbria during the early tenth century, a time of renewed viking activity, and the last representative of an independent Anglo-Saxon royal family in the north. His father, Eadulf, is styled king of the north Saxons by the tenth-century record embedded in the Irish annals of Ulster, while the contemporary <span class="italic">Historia de sancto Cuthberto</span> describes him as <i>princeps</i>. Ealdred, like his father before him, was prominent in efforts to unite Northumbria with the other English-ruled regions; the <span class="italic">Historia de sancto Cuthberto</span> claims that he was as beloved by Edward the Elder as his father had been by Alfred the Great.<br>
<br>Ealdred succeeded his father in 913, after the murder of Eadulf by an Eadred, son of Rixinc. Eadred led an invasion against Eadulf, killed him, and seized his wife before retiring south of the River Tyne to the sanctuary of the lands of St Cuthbert, where he resided for three years before dying in a battle fought against the vikings in 916. Ealdred came to power at the time when three vikings&#151;Ragnall, Sihtric, and Guthfrith&#151;began a campaign to bring Northumbria under their control. At the same time they were establishing themselves in south-eastern Ireland and taking control of the Irish Sea. Some time between 914 and 916 Ragnall attacked eastern Britain and occupied the lands of Ealdred, who fled north and sought aid from the Scottish king Constantine II. Seeking assistance from a Scottish rather than an English prince may not have been eccentric: Constantine had a son named Idulb, the Gaelic rendering of Eadulf, which suggests that the Scottish royal family and the dynasty of Bamburgh were allied by marriage. This alliance proved unable to halt the vikings and &#145;through some unknown sin&#146;, according to the <span class="italic">Historia de sancto Cuthberto</span>, Constantine and Ealdred were defeated in the battle of Corbridge. Constantine redeemed himself in a later battle when the Scots fought the vikings to a draw in 918. The death of Ragnall in 920 or 921 brought to Britain a less formidable opponent in his kinsman Sihtric, who ruled Northumbria until his death in 927. Ealdred remained powerful, however, and the contemporary version of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> notes that he submitted to King Edward the Elder in 924, together with all the Northumbrians: English, Danes, and Norwegians. After the death of Sihtric Northumbria was annexed by Edward's son &AElig;thelstan (<i>d</i>. 939) and Ealdred submitted to him. Ealdred then disappears from the chronicle record, but reappears as a witness to several charters issued at the court of &AElig;thelstan in 931 or 932. Those charters were all issued in the south of England, suggesting that Ealdred was in constant attendance on the royal court during that time. The absence of Ealdred from later documents suggests that he might have died in the year 933.<br>
<br>Little is known of Ealdred's family, although he had a brother named Uhtred who survived the battle of Corbridge. Ealdred was probably the father of Oswulf, who later ruled in Northumbria under King Eadred (<i>d</i>. 955). Oswulf engineered the downfall of Erik Bloodaxe (<i>d</i>. 954), the last king of an independent Northumbria, so that the kingdom could be annexed by Eadred. Oswulf was a witness to several royal charters where he is identified as &#145;high-reeve of Bamburgh&#146;.<br>
