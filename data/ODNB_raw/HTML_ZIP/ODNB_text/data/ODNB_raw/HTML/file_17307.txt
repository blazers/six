He was educated at Eton College, 1827&#150;33, and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, the following year. His intellectual qualities were rapidly recognized. He was a Newcastle scholar, a medallist (1834), and graduated BA, MA, and joint senior classic in 1838.<br>
<br>While still at Cambridge, Lyttelton succeeded to the peerage in 1837 on the death of his father. Many of his activities were directed towards the west midlands, where the family home, Hagley Hall, was situated. He was lord lieutenant of Worcestershire from 1839 to the end of his life. He formed an early interest in education, promoting night schools and working men's institutes. He became principal of Queen's College, Birmingham, in 1845, the first president of the Birmingham and Midland Institute in 1853, and he took an active interest in promoting the Oxford and Cambridge local examinations in the midlands. He was one of the founders (1852) of Saltley Training College, Birmingham, a Church of England institution, and taught in the Sunday school at Hagley for many years. Lyttelton's high-church outlook was formed mainly at Cambridge and pervaded his whole life. He took a close interest in episcopal matters and was critical of many aspects of the church. When the Association for Promoting the Reform of Convocation was formed in 1869, he became its first president.<br>
<br>Lyttelton had become acquainted with Mary Glynne (1813&#150;1857), daughter of Sir Stephen Glynne, eighth baronet, of Hawarden, when he was eighteen. Mary was a year younger than her sister, Catherine, and they were devoted to each other. A double wedding took place at Hawarden in July 1839, between Mary and Lyttelton, and Catherine and William Gladstone. Gladstone admired his new brother-in-law for his brilliant scholarship and his wit. In 1861 the two men published a volume of translations into Greek of part of Milton's <span class="italic">Comus</span> and Tennyson's <span class="italic">Lotos-Eaters</span> and into Latin of Goldsmith's <span class="italic">The Deserted Village</span> and Gray's <span class="italic">Ode to Adversity</span> (work on the volume was intended by Gladstone to be a distraction for Lyttelton following the death of his wife). The Glynnes had evolved a private language, Glynnese, which an outsider would not readily have understood. Lyttelton compiled a <span class="italic">Glossary of the Glynne Language</span>, which was privately printed in 1851.<br>
<br>Gladstone wrote of Lyttelton's character after his death, &#145;It was in the highest degree child-like and in the highest degree manly: a manner occasionally blunt veiled a temper of remarkable sweetness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Memorials</span>, 47). He possessed a high moral character and held sincerely to his beliefs, often in the face of opposition. Lacking in tact, he gained the reputation of an eccentric. When he was under-secretary of state for the colonies in Peel's administration (January&#150;July 1846) his chief, Gladstone, was obliged to rebuke him for amending the minutes of senior civil servants. Of a manic-depressive temperament, he found the strains of office very great and suffered from depression as a result. He held no further political office.<br>
<br>Lyttelton's interest in colonial affairs now took a different form. In 1847 Edward Gibbon Wakefield, an expert on colonial settlement, and John Robert Godley, the son of an Anglo-Irish landowner, established the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93787', "Canterbury Association")</script>, a Church of England corporation, which founded the province of Canterbury in New Zealand in 1850. Its aim was to buy up land from the Maori and resell it to settlers. The profits were to be used mainly in founding a cathedral, schools, and a university. The association soon ran into financial problems and Lyttelton, who was never wealthy, as its chairman was called on to assist in clearing the debts. The work of the association occupied much of his time. The port of Lyttelton, near Christchurch, commemorates his connection with the scheme. A new constitution provided for the establishment of six provinces in New Zealand in 1852, and the Canterbury Association was dissolved. Lyttelton visited the colony in 1867&#150;8, and recorded his experiences in two lectures given in 1869.<br>
<br>From the 1850s there was a revival of public interest in the problems of public education. In an address, <span class="italic">Thoughts on National Education</span>, delivered in 1855, Lyttelton declared himself in favour of compulsory elementary schooling on a nationwide basis, supported by public funds or rates, though he deprecated attempts to exclude religion from school education. He was a supporter of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science, which provided a forum for discussion of educational questions. He was one of the seven members of the royal commission, appointed in 1861, under the chairmanship of the fourth earl of Clarendon, to investigate the state of the nine great public schools. In 1864 another royal commission was instituted, chaired by the first Baron Taunton, to inquire into the 3000 endowed private and proprietary schools not covered by Clarendon. Lyttelton was once more called upon to serve. Although by background an &eacute;litist, he believed that intellectual ability should be recognized regardless of class, and favoured scholarships for poor boys. He was also convinced that educational provision for the daughters of the middle classes was inadequate. In 1867 he was responsible for drafting the chapter for the Taunton report which advocated more schools for girls and the training of suitably qualified women to teach them. He surprised many colleagues by changing his views on the question of the conscience clause, now supporting the right of parents to withdraw their children from religious instruction in schools.<br>
<br>The Taunton commission report, published in 1868, revealed the muddled state of the endowments and their application, and recommended that a new central authority should oversee the administration of education by provincial boards. This recommendation was received with hostility by Conservative politicians, headmasters, and governors. Instead, an <span class="roman">Endowed Schools Act</span> the following year empowered a commission to carry out much needed reforms. Gladstone, now prime minister, appointed Lyttelton as head of the endowed school commission, assisted by two other commissioners, to redistribute charitable endowments, reform governing bodies and trustees, and ensure that schools were financially efficient. He confronted well-established institutions in a somewhat quixotic manner and without public support. When the Conservatives came to power in 1874, the commission's work was transferred to the Charity Commission and Lyttelton lost his post.<br>
<br>Lyttelton's wife, Mary, died in 1857, exhausted by childbearing and leaving eight sons and four daughters. The third son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34657/', "Neville Gerald Lyttelton")</script>, had a military career; the fifth son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34655/', "Arthur Temple Lyttelton")</script>, was a bishop; the eighth son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34654/', "Alfred Lyttelton")</script>, became colonial secretary; and the seventh son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34656/', "Edward Lyttelton")</script>, was a schoolmaster and a cricketer. The second daughter, Lucy Caroline [<i>see </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/38845">Cavendish,  Lucy Caroline</a>, <i>under</i> <a target="_top" href="/view/article/4932">Cavendish, Lord  Frederick Charles</a>], was a churchwoman and promoter of women's education, as was the third daughter, Lavinia [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52031/', "Talbot, Lavinia")</script>]. On occasion, the family fielded a full cricket eleven of Lytteltons.<br>
<br>In 1869 Lyttelton married Sybella Harriet, widow of Humphrey Francis Mildmay MP. They had three daughters. He requested Gladstone to grant him an earldom in November 1873 as he disliked the possibility of inheriting the title of Viscount Cobham from his distant cousin, the duke of Buckingham and Chandos, but this was refused. Lyttelton became increasingly subject to fits of depression and in 1876 he was accompanied by his family to Italy. On his return to London, he was placed under close medical supervision but on Easter Tuesday, 19 April, he managed to elude his attendant and threw himself over the balusters of the staircase in the family house, 18 Park Crescent, Portman Place, London. He died the same day and was buried on 22 April 1876 at Hagley.<br>
