<span class="headword">Denney,  James</span>  (1856&#150;1917), <span class="occ">United Free Church of Scotland minister and theologian</span>, was born on 5 February 1856 in Paisley, the eldest son of John Denney and his wife, Mary Barr. His parents belonged to the Reformed Presbyterian church (the Cameronians), in which his father, a joiner, was a deacon. When he was four months old his parents moved to Greenock. He attended the Highlanders Academy in the town before studying at the University of Glasgow (1874&#150;9), graduating with a double first in classics and philosophy. Denney then studied theology at the Free Church college in Glasgow, the Reformed Presbyterians having joined with the Free Church of Scotland while he was at university. He graduated in 1883 and then spent three years in the East Hill Street Mission of Free St John's Church, Glasgow. In 1886, at the age of thirty, he was ordained and inducted to the charge of East Free Church in Broughty Ferry. A few months later, on 1 July 1886, he married Mary Carmichael Brown of Glasgow: they had no children and she predeceased him in 1907. During his time as a parish minister he published several books, including <span class="italic">The Epistles to the Thessalonians</span> (1892) and <span class="italic">The Second Epistle to the Corinthians</span> (1894).<br>
<br>Denney remained in Broughty Ferry until 1897, when he was appointed to the chair of systematic and pastoral theology at the Free Church college in Glasgow. His theological acumen had by this date already been widely recognized, as evidenced by the invitation to give a series of lectures at the Chicago Theological Seminary in 1894, later published as <span class="italic">Studies in Theology</span> (1895). As a teacher Denney was a hard taskmaster, always demanding the very highest quality of work from his students. His manner could be curt and even abrasive, and sometimes, to those who did not know him, he appeared remote, even cold. This, however, was countered by another side to his character, as witnessed by the admiration and loyalty he inspired in successive generations of students, and the warmth and humour he displayed among close friends such as J. P. Struthers, W. R. Thomson, and W. Robertson Nicoll. On the death of A. B. Bruce in 1899, Denney succeeded to the chair of <span class="roman">New Testament</span> language, literature, and theology. He held this chair until his untimely death in 1917, also serving as principal of the college from 1915. He was awarded honorary doctorates in divinity by Chicago Theological Seminary, Glasgow University, and Aberdeen University.<br>
<br>Theologically Denney was, on the whole, conservative. This was apparent in his critique of the prevailing liberal theology of his day: he objected to Harnack's treatment of miracle and the supernatural, and he highlighted the consequences of Ritschl's denial of the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ. However, on some issues, Denney was decidedly on the liberal wing of his church, revealing an original and creative theological mind and anticipating Karl Barth and the neo-orthodox movement. His position on the doctrine of scripture caused considerable anguish among the evangelicals (with whom, on so many theological issues, he was at one). In one of the lectures given in Chicago, revised heavily before publication, he denied verbal inspiration. Denney continued to promote his views on this subject and, indeed, on several occasions, at both presbytery and general assembly, he publicly denied the infallibility of scripture and the doctrine of verbal inerrancy. Liberal tendencies were also noticeable in his desire for the abandonment of credal subscription: he argued for the replacement of subscription to the Westminster confession of faith with the simple formula, &#145;I believe in God through Jesus Christ, His only Son our Saviour&#146;.<br>
<br>As a theologian, Denney's great theme was the cross of Christ. He was passionately committed to the doctrine of substitutionary atonement, and increasingly viewed the cross as the heart and centre of all theology. It has been argued that this position, developed much more fully in his later work, was the result of his wife's having introduced him to the sermons of C. H. Spurgeon. Whether or not this is so, it is certainly true that the forgiveness of sins through the atoning death of Christ became for Denney the prevailing theme of all his writing and preaching. His most important writings in this area were <span class="italic">The Death of Christ</span> (1902), <span class="italic">The Atonement and the Modern Mind</span> (1903), and the posthumously published <span class="italic">The Christian Doctrine of Reconciliation</span> (1917). As a scholar he was precise and thorough, with a meticulous eye for detail. He had a sharply critical intellect which, combined with his gift for clear and forthright speech, gave him a great advantage in debate and discussion. Denney also had a wide knowledge of classical and other literature. T. H. Walker quotes him as having said that if Shakespeare's tragedies were lost he could replace them from memory. His critical contributions in print and speech were much appreciated.<br>
<br>Denney was a prolific writer, producing fourteen books as well as co-writing another. In addition, two volumes of his letters were published posthumously: <span class="italic">Letters of Principal Denney to W. Robertson Nicoll, 1893&#150;1917</span> (1920) and <span class="italic">Letters of Principal Denney to his Family and Friends</span> (1921). He also wrote many short pieces for dictionaries, journals, and newspapers, notably numerous articles for James Hastings's <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Bible</span>, including &#145;Ascension&#146;, &#145;Creed&#146;, &#145;Knowledge&#146;, and &#145;Promise&#146;. His contributions to Hastings's <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Gospels</span> included &#145;Authority of Christ&#146; and &#145;Regeneration&#146;. His magazine articles were mostly for <span class="italic">The Expositor</span>, including: &#145;Caesar and God&#146; (January 1896), &#145;Adam and Christ in St Paul&#146; (February 1904), and &#145;A commentary on St Matthew&#146; (March 1915). His newspaper writing was, with very few exceptions, for the <span class="italic">British Weekly</span>, to which he contributed dozens of articles between 1898 and 1917. Topics included: &#145;The everlasting gospel&#146; (3 February 1898), &#145;Faith and science&#146; (11 April 1907), &#145;Why was Jesus sent to the cross?&#146; (29 December 1910), &#145;Religions and the true religion&#146; (21 August 1913), &#145;The Christian community and the war&#146; (13 August 1914), &#145;The war and the national conscience&#146; (20 August 1914), and &#145;Prohibition&#146; (15 February 1917).<br>
<br>Denney, however, was no ivory-tower theologian, but was deeply concerned with the work of the gospel and the advancement of the kingdom of God. His remark that, &#145;If evangelists were our theologians and theologians our evangelists we should be nearer the ideal&#146; was never more truly witnessed than in his own ministry. He said on a number of occasions that he had no interest in a theology which did not help in the work of evangelization or in a theology which could not be preached. Denney proved himself an active and devoted churchman. In 1900, when the Free Church of Scotland united with the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland to form the United Free Church of Scotland, Denney took part in the talks leading to the union. He was also involved in discussions about a further union with the Church of Scotland, which ultimately took place in 1929, after his death. He also played a role on the administrative side of the church as convener of the central fund, which was concerned with financial matters, in particular the stipend of ministers. He served in this capacity from 1913 to 1917, and just before his death had agreed to continue as convener for another four years. Denney could be a crusader, too: his involvement with the temperance movement led to his virulent attack on the drink trade during the First World War. The last thing he wrote before he died was an article on Robert Burns and the dangers of drink.<br>
<br>Denney became ill in February 1917 and died on 11 June 1917 in Glasgow. His funeral took place on Friday 15 June. After a private service at his home, 15 Lilybank Gardens, there was a public service in the Free Church college. He was buried in the western necropolis, Glasgow.<br>
