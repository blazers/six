<span class="headword">Sotheby family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1778&#150;1861), <span class="occ">auctioneers and book collectors</span>, came to prominence in the book trade in the mid-eighteenth century with <a name="cosubject_58886"></a><span class="headword">John Sotheby</span>  (1740&#150;1807). The Sothebys stemmed from Pocklington in Yorkshire, where a nineteenth-century wall plaque in the local church of All Saints details the family members. A bookish interest can be traced back to James Sotheby (1682&#150;1742), a keen collector of manuscripts and incunabula, and to William Sotheby (1757&#150;1833), a poet and author. Three generations of the Sotheby family were to be associated with the celebrated auction house which was subsequently established; two centuries later the firm still bore their name.<br>
<br>The family's involvement in auctioneering came about through the marriage of John Sotheby (1703&#150;1775) to Anne, sister of Samuel Baker (1711&#150;1778), a young bookseller. Baker began in business on his own in 1733 and started holding book auctions in 1744. Even sixty years after they had been introduced into England from the Netherlands, auctions were still a relatively unusual method of selling books. Although Baker eventually faced strong competition in London, his firm flourished. In 1767 he took George Leigh (1742&#150;1816) into partnership. Baker died in 1778; Leigh continued as a partner in the firm until his own death in 1816.<br>
<br>Baker, whose own marriage was childless, left a share of the business to his nephew, John Sotheby (1740&#150;1807), the only child of his sister and John Sotheby. Born in 1740, the younger John Sotheby married Elizabeth Cotton (daughter of Thomas Cotton and Mary Barnett) on 6 September 1770 at St George's, Bloomsbury. He joined his uncle's auction house at the age of thirty-eight on the latter's death. A serious but competent administrator, he worked very harmoniously with George Leigh: in fact they issued a fixed-price catalogue under the names Leigh and Sotheby as early as 23 July 1778.<br>
<br>In the last two decades of the eighteenth century under the joint management of Leigh and John Sotheby, the firm's sale catalogues became noticeably more elegant and the detail of the cataloguing improved greatly. The frequency of sales went up too and prices, particularly for manuscript material and prints, rose. By the end of the century the firm needed assistance to deal with the increased workload. In the summer of 1800 it arrived in the form of John Sotheby's son, <a name="cosubject_26036"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Sotheby</span>  (1771&#150;1842). He was the eldest of nine children and was born at Woodford in Essex on 14 July 1771. Baker had been his godfather. The firm now changed its style to Leigh, Sotheby &amp; Son. After his uncle's death in 1778 John, who had lived in Charlotte Street, Bloomsbury, inherited Baker's house in Chigwell and moved there.<br>
<br>For some reason, never fully explained, a serious altercation occurred between the two senior partners in 1804, as a consequence of which George Leigh and young Sam took themselves off to new premises at 145 Strand. John Sotheby remained in the firm's original premises in York Street, Covent Garden; he held two more sales there, then closed the business and retired. He sold his library through another auctioneer and died four years later on 11 November 1807. He was buried in St Paul's churchyard, Covent Garden.<br>
<br>Samuel Sotheby married Harriet Barton on 13 October 1803, and they lived in Hampstead. Harriet gave birth to two sons and two daughters before she died on 7 July 1808. Nine years later, on 12 May 1818 at Cheltenham, Sotheby married again. His second wife was Laura Smith, daughter of Christmas Smith of Bideford, Devon, and Porto, Portugal. Although she had two children, both died in infancy and she herself died on 30 April 1827.<br>
<br>Continuing growth forced the firm to move again to 3 Waterloo Bridge Street (later renamed 13 Wellington Street). It was now selling not only libraries, but also increasing numbers of prints, coins, drawings, watercolours, even paintings, as well as other forms of the decorative arts. Soon after George Leigh's death, Samuel Sotheby took into the business his second son, <a name="cosubject_26037"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Leigh Sotheby</span>  (1805&#150;1861), who was born on 31 August 1805 in Hampstead; George Leigh had been his godfather. S. L. Sotheby married at St Luke, Chelsea, on 11 May 1843 his first cousin, Julia Emma Pitcher (1818&#150;1898), youngest of the six children of Henry Jones Pitcher (1779&#150;1849) of Northfleet, Kent, a book dealer, and Anne Sotheby.<br>
<br>Samuel Leigh had a keen analytical mind and soon proved to be an adept partner in the business. It was a happy partnership, for father and son shared many interests, and indeed they became virtually fused into a single personality in the public mind. One of their strongest interests was the study of early printing and typography. They were in a wonderful position to appreciate it, for a constant stream of relevant raw material passed through their rooms and had to be scrutinized very carefully before being catalogued.<br>
<br>In the troubled economic circumstances after the Napoleonic wars the firm ran into difficulties. According to a notice that appeared in <span class="italic">The Times</span> on 25 November 1825, Samuel Sotheby of Wellington Street, Strand, auctioneer, was declared insolvent, and this was followed on 5 December with the dates of the proceedings in the bankruptcy court. It was presumably for this reason that Samuel Leigh began to take a more prominent role; Samuel Sotheby retired from the business, and in 1828 the firm sold its own entire run of bound and annotated copies of its sale catalogues down to that year. Over 700 of these sales&#151;which included many of the most important libraries in the land&#151;had taken place since Samuel Sotheby had begun to work in the auction house. Perhaps the most notable catalogue produced by him was that of the library of the first marquess of Lansdowne (<i>d</i>. 1805), who had been a passionate collector of state papers and owned 120 folio volumes of the Burleigh papers. The catalogue was in two volumes, the second running to 444 closely set pages. It aroused so much interest that the British Museum stepped in and bought the collection in its entirety for &pound;4925, granted for this purpose by parliament, and thus no auction ever took place.<br>
<br>Despite his effective retirement, Samuel Sotheby was declared bankrupt a second time, and the 1836 insolvency may have been the cause of the anonymous sale of his huge library on 9 February 1837. Samuel Sotheby died at Cleves Lodge, Chelsea, on 6 January 1842. He was buried alongside Samuel Baker in St Paul's churchyard. The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> was clearly aware of these events when its obituarist wrote:<blockquote>the character of the late Mr Sotheby was strictly exemplary in all the relations of private life; and though not so happy as he deserved in realising his fortune in a very arduous profession he retired from it with the good wishes and regret of very many who had long known and highly respected him. (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 17, 1842, 444)</blockquote>In 1837 Samuel Leigh had changed the firm's title to S. L. Sotheby. Although he now faced the world alone, after nearly a hundred years in existence the firm had achieved an enviable reputation. During the following sixty years it consolidated its standing as the premier auctioneer of antiquarian books. For much of that time Sotheby had the able assistance of John Wilkinson (1803&#150;1895), who had originally joined the firm in 1821 as an accountant but became a brilliant auctioneer, and later its sole manager. He retired in 1885.<br>
<br>Because he was so familiar with their contents, Samuel Leigh completed and published a number of books on which his father had already spent years of research, including <span class="italic">The Typography of the Fifteenth Century</span> (1845). The principal bibliographical work begun by Samuel and completed by Samuel Leigh (after sixteen years' further labour) was <span class="italic">Principia typographica</span> (3 vols., 1858). This concerned the early forms of book printing, such as block books, but both father and son had also been fascinated by the watermarks used on paper in the early days of printing and devoted much time to their collection and study. This topic was another important part of the book. There was also collaboration with William Young Ottley, a family friend, and Ottley's son over the eventual publication of each family's own book on this subject.<br>
<br>In 1835 Samuel Leigh's own curiosity was much excited when the firm received from Frankfurt the 5000 volumes of the library of Dr Georg F. B. Kloss (1787&#150;1854), mostly printed before 1536. Many of these volumes contained marginal annotations which Sotheby thought to be in the hand of Philip Melanchthon, the friend of Martin Luther. His deductions (now not regarded as correct) were published in volume form in 1840 under the title <span class="italic">Unpublished Documents</span>, but they continued to occupy him for many years.<br>
<br>In a different vein, Sotheby produced <span class="italic">Ramblings in the Elucidation of the Autograph of Milton</span> (1861), and for more than thirty years he was at work on an unpublished &#145;Bibliographical account of the English poets to the period of Restoration&#146;. His widow, Julia Emma, endeavoured to complete the work, but never did so, and the manuscript was eventually sold to Chetham's Library in Manchester, where it remains.<br>
<br>Samuel Leigh was also something of a collector. In 1859 he staged an exhibition on the firm's premises of his &#145;cabinet pictures&#146;. They were mostly the work of a wide range of English artists, including Richard Parkes Bonington, George Cattermole, William Collins, John Sell Cotman, John Constable (<span class="italic">A View of Windsor Castle</span>), Richard Dadd, William Etty, and A. V. Copley Fielding, many of them given by relatives of the artists. On other occasions he bought them at auction, &#145;paying more than others&#146;. An informative catalogue survives. He also took a great interest in the management of the Crystal Palace, which had been re-erected near his home, Woodlands, in Norwood.<br>
<br>Samuel Leigh died suddenly and quite unexpectedly on 19 June 1861. He was subject to fainting fits, and during a ramble near Buckfastleigh Abbey he appears to have fallen into the River Dart and drowned. His library, including all his Melanchthon papers, was sold at Wellington Street on 8 February 1862. He was a man of enormous and diverse enthusiasms who had changed the character of the firm's establishment in Wellington Street into an altogether more interesting and wide-ranging business, where scholarship and, above all, accuracy were regarded as of primary importance. In John Wilkinson he was fortunate to have a partner whose solid but intelligent objectivity tempered his own idiosyncrasies and who was also able to consolidate, profitably, the many innovations that the last of the Sothebys had brought about.<br>
<br>The very different characters of the three generations of the Sotheby family set the seal on the business that survives to this day. They established the essential methodology of successful auctioneering, creating and consolidating sound administration, scholarship, and precision in cataloguing. This was particularly true of Samuel Leigh, whose questing mind gave the firm a new impetus on which his successors were able to build.<br>
