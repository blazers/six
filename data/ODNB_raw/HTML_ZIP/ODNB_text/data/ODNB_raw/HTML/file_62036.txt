<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clive,  Robert George  Windsor-</span>, first earl of Plymouth  (1857&#150;1923), <span class="occ">politician and philanthropist</span>, was born in John Street, Berkeley Square, on 27 August 1857, the only son of the Hon. Robert Windsor-Clive (1824&#150;1859), Conservative MP for Ludlow (1852&#150;4) and South Shropshire (1854&#150;9), and his wife, Lady Mary Selina Louisa (1829/30&#150;1889), daughter of George Augustus Frederick Bridgeman, second earl of Bradford. In 1869 he succeeded as the fourteenth Baron Windsor, on the death of his grandmother Lady Harriet Clive (who in 1855 took the surname Windsor-Clive), Baroness Windsor, daughter of Other Windsor, fifth earl of Plymouth (second creation).<br>
<br>After schooling at Eton College (1870&#150;4) Windsor was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, in 1875, graduating BA in 1878 (MA 1891). He took his seat in the House of Lords in December 1878. On 11 August 1883 he married Alberta Victoria Sarah Caroline (1862/3&#150;1944), daughter of Sir Augustus Berkeley Paget, British ambassador in Austria-Hungary and Rome, and his wife, Walburga Ehrengarde Helena de Hohenthal. They had three sons and one daughter. His mother-in-law was the doyenne of the expatriate community in Florence, who acquired in 1893 the celebrated villa Torre di Bellosguardo; visits to her houses and gardens partly accounted for his love of Italy and its art.<br>
<br>Windsor inherited 37,000 acres of family estates in Glamorgan, Shropshire, and Worcestershire, and was proprietor of three stately homes: St Fagan's Castle, Cardiff; Oakly Park, Ludlow; and Hewell Grange, Tardebigge, Worcestershire, which he had built in elaborate Jacobean style by Bodley and Garner (1884&#150;91), and where he mainly lived. In 1899 he had a town mansion built in Mount Street, Mayfair, to the design of Fairfax Wade. He had a genuine and informed interest in art; he painted in watercolours and was an authority on stained glass. In 1887 he became the founding president of the South Wales Art Society and Sketching Club, and continued as an active president until his death; he and his wife frequently contributed watercolours to exhibitions held at St Fagan's Castle. In 1903 he contributed a study of John Constable RA to the popular <span class="roman">Makers of British Art</span> series, showing his considerable knowledge of artists of that period and of the French school, and a subtle appreciation of Constable's art.<br>
<br>Windsor was known to his tenants as a good landlord, paying higher than average wages and taking a keen practical interest in the welfare of his employees and the public. In Glamorgan he was connected with the industrial developments at Penarth and Barry docks; he chaired the Barry Dock and Railway Company, which began work on constructing the Barry Dock in 1884, which was opened by Lady Windsor in July 1889. He was lord lieutenant of Glamorganshire from 1890 until his death, and mayor of Cardiff in 1895&#150;6. As lieutenant-colonel (1893&#150;1906) commanding the Worcester yeomanry cavalry in 1899 he selected 129 men from 3021 volunteers for active service in the South African War with a newly formed Imperial yeomanry cavalry.<br>
<br>In the House of Lords, Windsor was a tory politician &#145;of the old school&#146; and a zealous imperialist. For many years he was president of the National Union of Conservative Associations. He held office under Lord Salisbury in 1890&#150;02 as paymaster-general, and was appointed a member of the privy council in 1891. In August 1902 he was made first commissioner of works (though without a seat in the cabinet) in the government of Arthur Balfour, for which his artistic and architectural interests were seen as particular qualifications. One of a series of effective holders of that office in the early twentieth century, he displayed his talent for large-scale metropolitan improvements and public works, often in association with the architect Sir Aston Webb.<br>
<br>From 1901 Windsor had been a member of the committee of the national memorial to Queen Victoria, which made plans for a new approach to Buckingham Palace, realigning and laying out the Mall as a splendid ceremonial avenue, culminating in the Queen Victoria memorial. As first commissioner he carried through the construction of the new Mall, which was used as a processional route for the first time in February 1904 when Edward VII opened parliament in person. He left office following the fall of the Balfour administration in December 1905, and on 18 December 1905 was created first earl of Plymouth in Devon, of the third creation, the title having lapsed on the death of the eighth earl in 1843. At the same time he was promoted Viscount Windsor of St Fagan's in the county of Glamorgan. He remained on the management committee of the Victoria memorial committee until the transformation of the Mall was completed by Admiralty Arch, as the terminal point of the Mall at the Trafalgar Square end in 1910, and the Queen Victoria memorial by Sir Thomas Brock in 1911. Plymouth's interest in architecture was reflected by his position as first president of the Concrete Institute (later the Institution of Structural Engineers) on its foundation in 1908.<br>
<br>In the coronation year of 1911 Plymouth was chairman of the committee which organized an ambitious Festival of Empire at the Crystal Palace, Sydenham. The palace had already become a patriotic and imperial arena through previous exhibitions, functions, and entertainments, but now the entire site was employed, with three-quarter-size replicas of the parliament buildings from the dominions erected in the park and an &#145;All Red Route&#146; scenic railway with panoramic backcloths, animated by both people and animals, showing the landscapes, life, and enterprises of the British empire. Plymouth contributed the entire cost of the South African parliament building, when the dominion declined to pay for it. He declared that the festival, opened by King George and Queen Mary, was for knowledge and not &#145;self-glorification&#146;; as &#145;the social gathering of the British family&#146; its aim was to teach the &#145;gospel of Empire&#146; (<span class="italic">Festival of Empire, Imperial Exhibition, Pageant of London</span>, 1911) to the average Briton. The imperial sports meeting, a forerunner of the Commonwealth games, was held at the festival on 24 June 1911, when the United Kingdom, Australasia, and Canada competed for the empire trophy. A highly elaborate &#145;Pageant of Empire&#146;, directed by Frank Lascelles with a cast of 15,000, chronicled its history and moreover celebrated Britannia's right to rule her territories; Plymouth's son Ivor, Lord Windsor, played St George, his wife Queen Elizabeth, and his daughter a Wagnerian damozel of death.<br>
<br>In November 1911, when the Crystal Palace Company was declared bankrupt and the court of chancery ordered its sale by auction, Plymouth saved it for the nation, lending &pound;230,000 to allow a Mansion House committee to raise the money. A public fund for the &pound;9000 still lacking was started; it was found in a fortnight, &pound;5000 of it given by Plymouth. The assumption that local authorities would contribute their agreed share proved wrong, and in December 1913 he himself made up the &pound;30,000 outstanding.<br>
<br>Plymouth was a leading member and the first president of the London Society, founded in 1912 to keep a watchful eye on planning, development, and conservation. His public service was notably generous and wide in scope: he served as chairman of the trustees of the Tate Gallery and as trustee or committee member for the National Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the National Trust, the Shakespeare Memorial Trust, and the British Pacific Science Expedition for New Guinea. During the First World War he raised troops in Wales and equipped them, helped to bring about the creation of the Welsh Guards in 1915, and was instrumental in setting up the north Wales heroes' memorial of 1923. He gave much help and advice to the British Italian League, and was a leading light in the British Red Cross. In 1919 he became high steward of Cambridge University. Known as a keen sportsman and encourager of sports, he was a good shot and keen golfer.<br>
<br>Plymouth appeared to have recovered after a long illness in 1921&#150;2, but on 6 March 1923 died of a haemorrhage at his house in Great Cumberland Place, when taking off his uniform on his return from a king's lev&eacute;e. He was buried in the parish churchyard at Tardebigge. Two of his three sons predeceased him: the eldest died in 1908 at Agra of enteric fever when ADC to the viceroy of India; the third son was killed in action at Landrecies in 1914. The second son, Ivor Miles (1889&#150;1943), briefly MP for Ludlow and later a junior minister in the National governments of the 1930s, succeeded as second earl of Plymouth.<br>
