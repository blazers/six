<span class="headword">Domett, Sir  William</span>  (1752&#150;1828), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was possibly born in Hawkchurch parish in Dorset; details of his parents and upbringing are unknown. He entered the navy in 1769 under the patronage of Captain Alexander Hood, who introduced him to Captain Reynolds, under whom he served, first as able seaman and then as midshipman, in the <i>Quebec</i> (36 guns) for three years in the West Indies. He then joined the sloop <i>Scorpion</i> (Captain Elphinstone) in the Mediterranean and was in her for two-and-a-half years before returning to England and serving in the <i>Marlborough</i> (74 guns) for a month; from her he transferred as master's mate to the <i>Surprise</i> (28 guns, Captain Linzee), in which he served for two years on the Newfoundland station. He was still in the <i>Surprise</i> when, with the outbreak of the American War of Independence, she was the advance ship of the squadron that raised the rebel siege of Quebec in May 1775. Thereafter the <i>Surprise</i> went to Newfoundland, where Linzee recommended Domett to Admiral John Montagu, who made him acting lieutenant in the <i>Romney</i> (50 guns). Domett proved a &#145;persevering and deserving officer&#146;  (Ralfe, 2.419) who studied his profession but he was in the <i>Romney</i> for only four months, returning to England with Montagu at the end of the year. A midshipman from 5 February 1777, he was appointed to Alexander Hood's ship, the <i>Robust</i> (74 guns), and was present at the battle of Ushant on 27 July 1778. After being appointed lieutenant on 27 December 1778 Domett remained in her under Captain Cosby until she had led Arbuthnot's line in the action off Cape Henry on 16 March 1781. He then moved to the <i>Invincible</i> (74 guns, Captain Sir Charles Saxton), and was present at the action off Chesapeake on 5 September 1781; after this he was taken, as his signal officer, to the West Indies by Sir Samuel Hood, in the <i>Barfleur</i> (90 guns). He served in that demanding capacity in the operations against St Kitts in January 1782 and in the battle of the Saints (12 April 1782). When the first lieutenant of the <i>Barfleur</i> was promoted Domett was appointed to his place. Hood, detached from Rodney's fleet, captured four enemy ships in the Mona passage on 19 April. Rodney promoted Domett to the command of one, the sloop <i>Ceres</i>, on 21 August 1782 and sent him to England with dispatches. He was advanced to post rank on 9 September 1782 and, at the particular request of Alexander Hood (now Rear-Admiral Sir Alexander Hood), was appointed his flag captain in the <i>Queen</i> (98 guns), one of Lord Howe's fleet which relieved Gibraltar and repelled the enemy attack off Cape Spartel on 20 October. The Hood &#145;interest&#146; with William Pitt, and Domett's growing service reputation, served him well: though unemployed at the end of the war, on 23 June 1786 he was appointed senior officer at Leith in the <i>Champion</i> (24 guns).<br>
<br>On 13 May 1788 Domett was appointed to the <i>Pomone</i> (28 guns), which was bound first for the African coast and then the West Indies, and returned to England in 1789. Here, at Admiral Milbanke's request, Domett transferred, on 9 May, to the flagship <i>Salisbury</i> (50 guns), and went to Newfoundland, where Milbanke was appointed governor and commander-in-chief. On 10 May 1790 Domett was appointed to the <i>London</i>, fitting for Sir Alexander Hood's flag, in the Spanish armament, the mobilization for the Nootka Sound crisis, and joined Howe's fleet at Torbay. But being paid off he moved on 6 December 1790 to the <i>Pegasus</i> (28 guns), and once more to Newfoundland, where he stayed until returning to England at the end of 1791. Admiral Goodall, appointed commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, then asked for Domett as his flag captain and Domett was appointed to the <i>Romney</i> (22 March 1792), but the outbreak of the French war in the following year led to his recall and appointment (14 June) as flag captain to Sir Alexander Hood in the <i>Royal George</i> (100 guns). In her he was present at the battle of 1 June 1794 and the battle off Lorient (23 June 1795) where Alexander Hood (now Lord Bridport) was commander-in-chief. After Lorient, Bridport especially commended Domett's conduct and assistance and his &#145;active and attentive mind&#146;  (Ralfe, 2.421) and entrusted him with dispatches of the victory. Domett remained captain of the <i>Royal George</i> for a record seven-and-a-half years, during which she was considered &#145;one of the best disciplined and most expert ships&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Domett's personal and professional loyalties lay with the Hood family, and he corresponded with Bridport after the admiral's retirement, keeping him informed of matters of naval interest. When St Vincent took command of the Channel Fleet in May 1800 Domett was critical of his abilities and wary of St Vincent's early favours to Bridport's appointees. Hearing of vacancies among the marine regiments, in May 1800 he gloomily supposed &#145;upwards of <i>thirty</i> years constant and faithful service&#146; would give him no chance  (Domett to Bridport, 19 May 1800, BL, Add. MS 35201, fols. 100&#150;01), so he must have been pleased at his appointment as colonel of the Portsmouth division of marines in January 1801. His appointment as captain of the fleet in August 1800 may have been equally surprising to him, since he told Bridport that Sir Thomas Troubridge had long been appointed to this post and was longing to take it up, but that the matter was settled between Lord Spencer and St Vincent. Domett retained his position until 29 October, taking the <i>Royal George</i> to Portsmouth to hoist Sir Hyde Parker's flag, and relieving St Vincent, whose health had broken down. Domett himself moved to the <i>Belleisle</i> (74 guns) but on 17 February 1801 he was appointed, in the <i>London</i>, captain of the fleet to Parker, commander of the fleet sent to the Baltic to break the combination of states formed there against Britain.<br>
<br>It was thanks to Domett's advice that the fleet entered the Baltic directly through the sound rather than through the great belt. Parker, on consulting Vansittart and Nelson, had first begun to enter by the belt; Copenhagen was then to be attacked over the grounds by the 64-gun ships and smaller vessels. Domett disagreed with this plan, arguing that the ships sent would not constitute a sufficient force, that the wind which carried the ships into the attack would prevent them returning, and that if they were crippled or repulsed, shoaling water would make it impossible to help them and the fleet would be divided, all of which the Danes knew well. Domett also reminded Parker that going into the sound they would pass closer to a fortified point of land than to Kronenborg Castle, which they sought to avoid by going through the belt. These considerations induced Parker to change his plan and enter the sound. However, he mentioned none of this in his public letter after the victory at Copenhagen, though he had told Domett that he was obliged to him &#145;for the <i>whole</i> and shall acknowledge it to the last day of <i>my Life</i>&#146;  (Domett to Bridport, 4 May 1801, BL, Add. MS 35201, fols. 136&#150;9).<br>
<br>On arrival at Copenhagen, Parker consulted Nelson, Graves, and Domett about an attack, which Domett supported, but his name once more was not mentioned in the public dispatch. Parker apologized for this omission and said he would try to put it right, but Domett rightly felt aggrieved. &#145;I am left quite in the background from his neglect, or rather forgetfulness and the public know of no such man in the Fleet&#146;  (Domett to Bridport, 4 May 1801, BL, Add. MS 35201, fols. 136&#150;9). On Parker's return to England Nelson took command and expressly asked Domett to remain captain of the fleet, which he did, in the <i>St George</i> (98 guns) from 14 May 1801, before returning to England with Nelson. On 6 July 1801 he resumed command of the <i>Belleisle</i>, but on 28 September he was appointed to the <i>Ville de Paris</i> (110 guns) as captain of the fleet to Admiral Cornwallis, commander-in-chief of the Channel Fleet, who had asked for him. He held this post until the peace of Amiens.<br>
<br>During that brief period of peace Domett served on the Irish station as senior officer with a broad pennant, but the renewal of war in 1803 again saw him as Cornwallis's captain of the fleet, from 6 June to 23 April 1804, when he was promoted rear-admiral of the blue. He was ordered to hoist his flag on the North Sea station (26 April), but declined on health grounds and in December was appointed one of the commissioners for revising the civil affairs of the navy, whose chairman was Sir Charles Middleton.<br>
<br>On 9 November 1805 Domett was promoted rear-admiral of the white and on 28 April 1808 rear-admiral of the red, while on 9 May he joined the Board of Admiralty, a position in which he served until 23 October 1813. Further promotion, to vice-admiral of the white, followed on 25 October 1809; four days after leaving the Admiralty, on 27 October 1813, he succeeded Sir Robert Calder as commander-in-chief at Plymouth, and on 4 December he became vice-admiral of the red. He served at Plymouth for fifteen months, resigning because a foot injury made him increasingly lame. He was promoted admiral of the blue (12 August 1819) and admiral of the white (27 May 1825). On 2 January 1815 he was nominated KCB, and on 16 May 1820 GCB.<br>
<br>Although, as he feared, he was not well known to the public, Domett was held in general esteem by his colleagues for his professional abilities. He was almost constantly employed because of these and took part in many battles. No one had more experience as captain of the fleet, under many admirals, &#145;an eulogium&#146;, as his monument in Hawkchurch parish church says, &#145;on his character and talents more eloquent than words and more durable than marble&#146;. His ships were always in good order and discipline and ready for service, seldom suffering in bad weather and causing less expense in repairs than those of any other commander, according to Ralfe. So it is not surprising that Domett, the model of a professional seaman, backed by powerful interest earlier in his life, achieved a highly successful career. Domett never married. The family were long settled on the borders of Dorset and Devon at Hawkchurch, not far from Bridport's estate at Cricket St Thomas. Domett bought a considerable part of the manor of Phillyholm in the parish when he was one of the Admiralty commissioners, perhaps at the same time Lord Bridport bought Wild Court Manor in the same parish in 1806. Domett made his home at Westhay House, Hawkchurch, in retirement and died there, suddenly, on 19 May 1828 aged seventy-six. He was buried in a family vault in the churchyard. A monument in the parish church records his achievements.<br>
<br>Domett's nephew Lieutenant William Domett was lost in the schooner <i>Vigilant</i> on 9 February 1804: &#145;a promising young officer&#146;, wrote Commodore Samuel Hood in reporting it, &#145;who was succeeding fast to the skill of his gallant uncle, the captain of the Channel fleet&#146;  (<span class="italic">Naval Chronicle</span>, 11, 1804, 494).<br>
