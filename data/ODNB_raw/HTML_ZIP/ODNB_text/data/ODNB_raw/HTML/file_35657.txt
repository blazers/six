<span class="headword">Ralston,  James Layton</span>  (1881&#150;1948), <span class="occ">politician in Canada</span>, was born at Amherst, Cumberland county, Nova Scotia, Canada, on 27 September 1881, the eldest son of Burnett William Ralston, postmaster, and his wife, Bessie Chipman Layton. His father was of Scottish, his mother of united empire loyalist, descent. After attending the county academy at Amherst he studied at Dalhousie Law School, Halifax, and was called to the Nova Scotia bar in 1903. In 1907 he married Nettie Winnifred, daughter of John McLeod, a foreman iron moulder, of Amherst. They had one son, Stuart Bowman Ralston, who became a justice of the superior court of the province of Quebec for the district of Montreal. <br>
<br>In 1908, when a young practising barrister, Ralston ran as federal Liberal candidate for Cumberland county. He was defeated, but was elected to the legislative assembly of Nova Scotia in 1911 and again in 1916. He had rapidly attained eminence in his profession, first in Amherst and later in Halifax, and was in much demand as counsel. He was made a KC in 1914. A &#145;slight, distinguished looking man, with good features and thoughtful eyes&#146;  (Creighton, 39), he had considerable energy and physical stamina as well as a fine mind. He was noted for the thoroughness with which he prepared his cases and the forcefulness with which he presented them. <br>
<br>In 1915 Ralston enlisted as a lieutenant and in 1916 went overseas with the 85th Canadian infantry battalion as a major. He reached France early in 1917 and served continuously until the armistice, commanding the 85th from April 1918 to demobilization in June 1919. He was gazetted lieutenant-colonel in 1918, and colonel in 1924. He was wounded four times, mentioned twice in dispatches, and awarded the CMG (1918) and DSO with bar (1917 and 1918). The officers and men under Ralston's command were unusually devoted to him, a devotion not lessened by the exacting nature of his demands upon them, and which was enhanced by his well-earned reputation for personal bravery. <br>
<br>In 1919 Ralston returned to England and then to Canada, where he re-entered practice in the firm of Maclean and Ralston. He was defeated in provincial elections in 1920 and 1925 and in the federal election of 1926 at a time when the fortunes of his party were low in his province. In 1926 he was taken into W. L. Mackenzie King's cabinet as minister of national defence and never thereafter suffered a personal electoral defeat. In 1922 he had acted as chairman of a royal commission on pensions and soldiers' civil re-establishment, appointed by the dominion government, and in later years he was actively concerned with the well-being of former servicemen. This had important results in 1944 when the measures known as the veterans' charter were under consideration by the government in which he was then minister of defence. From 1930 to 1935 he was in opposition, and acted as Mackenzie King's &#145;chief English-speaking stand-by in debate&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 24 May 1948, 7e). He was a vigilant critic of the financial policies of the Conservative government and denounced the prime minister J. M. Bennett's &#145;New Deal&#146; as a &#145;series of measures which prove to be only a hollow echo of the flow of fulsome rhetoric with which they were announced&#146;  (Thompson and Seager, 265). In 1931 he obtained admission to the Quebec bar and entered a firm in Montreal. After the death of his leading partner he had to choose between politics and the law, and for family reasons put law first. He retired from the Canadian House of Commons in 1935. <br>
<br>When war broke out in September 1939 Ralston offered his services in any capacity to the prime minister, Mackenzie King, and entered the cabinet as minister of finance. He gave his usual exhaustive&#151;probably excessive&#151;attention to detail, but he did not neglect broader considerations and quickly mastered the underlying principles of war finance. Mackenzie King recognized Ralston's value in establishing public confidence in his wartime administration and in July 1940 he appointed him minister of defence. In this capacity Ralston made a monumental contribution to Canada's war effort. His labours were prodigious, his determination irresistible&#151;Canada's effort in mobilization of manpower met with striking success. In a sense he became the personification of Canada militant. The winning of the war became the one purpose to which all his thoughts and energies were directed. <br>
<br>In winter 1940&#150;41 Ralston visited Britain, where he had talks with Sir Archibald Sinclair about the Canadian contribution to the aerial war. The result was the Sinclair&#150;Ralston agreement of January 1941, which provided for the eventual establishment of twenty-five Royal Canadian Air Force squadrons. In the meantime Canadian airmen would serve in the Royal Air Force. The agreement has been seen as a missed opportunity to create a Canadian air force, and Ralston's silence on this point as symptomatic of Canadian officials' lack of confidence in their dealings with British counterparts during the war. Vincent Massey, Canadian high commissioner in London, observed with regret that visiting Canadians &#145;frequently behaved like awkward and tongue-tied country cousins&#146;  (Creighton, 46). <br>
<br>In all that he did Ralston aimed to keep faith with the front-line soldier and this led him in autumn 1944 to advocate compulsion for overseas service. The government had statutory powers to send those conscripted for home service overseas, but for political reasons it preferred to rely on a flow of volunteers. In September 1944 Ralston visited Canadian forces in Italy. The corps commander there emphasized the need for reinforcements and when Ralston arrived in Brussels in early October a colleague observed: &#145;Much of his sparkle and good humour had disappeared and he could think or talk of little else but the reinforcement problem&#146;  (Soward, 36). Directly on his return to Canada he recommended to the war cabinet that 15,000 fully trained infantry be sent to Europe as soon as possible. But with the war seemingly won, his colleagues were reluctant to believe that this politically inexpedient step was necessary. The attitude was epitomized by Mackenzie King, who on 2 November accepted Ralston's resignation. Three weeks later, however, in a remarkable volte-face, the government tabled an order in council providing for the immediate dispatch of 16,000 men to Europe. Ralston had been vindicated and he quit politics with his reputation considerably enhanced. <br>
<br>Upon his retirement from the government, Ralston returned to his law practice in Montreal. He pursued his heavy labours with all his accustomed energy until stricken by a heart attack which resulted in his death in Montreal on 22 May 1948. <br>
<br>Ralston held numerous directorships, reflecting his eminence as a corporation lawyer. He was also a prominent Baptist layman, a governor of Acadia and McMaster universities, and the holder of seven honorary degrees. His friends, however, thought of him primarily as a simple, direct, devout man, generous and considerate. As a soldier, cabinet minister, and head of a law firm, Ralston drove himself and his subordinates hard. But it is a measure of his integrity that he retained the loyalty of those with whom he worked. After his death his picture remained in every office of his law firm, where colleagues continued to refer with deep respect and affection to &#145;the Colonel&#146;.<br>
