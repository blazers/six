<span class="headword">Davies,  Jonathan</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1737, <em>d.</em> 1809), <span class="occ">schoolmaster</span>, was born at Eton College, where he was baptized on 26 June 1737, the son of John and Sarah Davies. He was nicknamed by his pupils Barber, which may indicate his father's job. He was a scholar at Eton and proceeded to King's College, Cambridge, whence he matriculated at Easter 1756. Elected a Craven scholar in 1757, he graduated BA in 1760 and proceeded MA in 1763. He returned to Eton as assistant master, appointed by Edward Barnard, in 1760. On the resignation of the very unsuccessful John Foster in 1773 he became headmaster. The following year he became rector of Scaldwell in Northamptonshire. As headmaster he somewhat restored Eton's fortunes, and the number of boys rose from below 250 to above 400, and many subsequently distinguished men were educated there in his time. Memoirs recall his loud voice and fondness for good living. He had his troubles too, though in general he proved more acceptable to the boys than to the masters. He was an exacting headmaster and his staff collectively offered their resignations in 1783; in their absence from duty the boys became rebellious, which compelled the masters to return to re-establish order. Davies prudently closed the school early for the Christmas holidays.<br>
<br>When Provost Barnard died in 1781 Davies might have expected to succeed him, but George III appointed his personal favourite, William Hayward Roberts, and Davies was made a canon of Windsor as a consolation. He did, however, succeed Roberts in December 1791 and continued until his death at Eton on 5 December 1809; he was buried at Eton. He had already restored some prizes which had lapsed, and by his will he created a scholarship for Eton scholars who were not elected to King's, and left &pound;1000 to found a classical scholarship in his name at Cambridge, similar to the Craven scholarship which he had won. He also left &pound;2000 to King's College.<br>
