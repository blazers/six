<span class="headword">Pulling,  Alexander</span>  (1813&#150;1895), <span class="occ">serjeant-at-law and legal writer</span>, was born on 1 December 1813 at the Court House, St Arvans, Monmouthshire, the fourth son of George Christopher Pulling, a naval officer, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Moser of Kendal, Westmorland. He was educated at a private school at Llandaff before entering the Merchant Taylors' School in April 1829. On 30 October 1838 he was admitted to the Inner Temple, where he was called to the bar on 9 June 1843. He practised first on the western and afterwards on the south Wales circuit, where he became a leader. While still in his pupillage he published <span class="italic">A Practical Treatise on the Laws, Customs, and Regulations of the City and Port of London</span> (1842), in which he concentrated a vast amount of previously inaccessible legal and antiquarian lore and sketched a bold scheme of metropolitan municipal reform, which in essence anticipated the <span class="roman">Local Government Act</span> of 1888. In November 1853 he gave evidence before the royal commission on the state of the corporation of London  (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1854, 26); and in 1855 he was appointed senior commissioner under the <span class="roman">Metropolitan Management Act</span> of that year. He frequently represented the city both in court and before parliamentary committees. On 30 August 1855 he married Elizabeth, fourth daughter of Luke Hopkinson of Bedford Row, Middlesex; they had two sons.<br>
<br>Pulling was an energetic member of the Society for Promoting the Amendment of the Law and of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science, and a principal promoter and original member of the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting. He advocated the payment of jurors. He called for the relief of parliament by the transference of private-bill business to local authorities, writing an article on that subject in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> in January 1855 and publishing <span class="italic">Private Bill Legislation</span> in 1859 and a <span class="italic">Proposal for Amendment of the Procedure in Private Bill Legislation</span> in 1862. He favoured the supersession of election petitions by a system of routine scrutiny. In 1857 he was appointed revising barrister for Glamorgan, and in 1864 was made a serjeant-at-law. From 1867 to 1874 he resided at Newark Park, near Wotton under Edge, was in the commission of the peace for Gloucestershire, and took an active part in local administration, acting frequently as deputy county court judge and commissioner of assize under the Welsh circuit commission. He died on 15 January 1895 at home at 68 Redcliffe Gardens, South Kensington, London. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Pulling was one of the last surviving members of the ancient order of serjeants-at-law, of which he wrote a history. He was an active writer on a broad range of legal concerns, including law reporting, mercantile law, and parliamentary procedure.<br>
