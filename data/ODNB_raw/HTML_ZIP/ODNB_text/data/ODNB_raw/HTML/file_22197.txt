<span class="headword">Phylip,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1580&#150;1670), <span class="occ">Welsh poet</span>, was the son of Phylip Si&ocirc;n ap Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1625) of Hendre Fechan in the parish of Llanddwywe, Merioneth, and his wife, Kathrin Lewys (<i>d</i>. 1651). He married Annes about 1598; she died on 30 December 1653. They had two children: a son, Henry William[s], and a daughter, Elsbeth. She died unmarried on 1 August 1654, aged thirty-four. William Phylip and his family lived in Hendre Fechan. Although he was for some years a collector of taxes in Merioneth it is said that he suffered some persecution under parliamentary rule. He was one of the lesser gentleman-poets of Merioneth who composed <i>ar ei fwyd ei hun</i> (&#145;on his own provision&#146;; Fisher). William Phylip was associated with the family of poets known as Phylipiaid Ardudwy. In his elegy to a fellow poet, Rhisiart Phylip (<i>d</i>. 1641), William referred to him as his uncle and bardic teacher. Phylip Si&ocirc;n Phylip, nephew of Rhisiart, composed an elegy to William Phylip, who died in Hendre Fechan on 11 February 1670, aged about ninety, and may have been buried in the cemetery of Llanddwywe church.<br>
<br>Phylip's poetic work which, as far as is known, circulated in manuscript only, consists of some twenty strict-metre poems called <i>cywyddau</i>, some forty-five poems in the short <i>englyn</i> metre, and about seventy individual <i>englyn</i> poems. He composed some forty-five free-metre poems. Most of William's <i>cywyddau</i> are elegies and poems of praise&#151;and a fair number of them are addressed to members of his own family. Among his best-known strict-metre poems were his elegy to Charles I and two poems &#145;To the Grave&#146;. His free-metre poems deal with political and religious matters&#151;he was an ardent royalist and Anglican&#151;and a variety of topics including old age. Among his topics is the &#145;history of the Britons&#146; where it is clear that he (and others) in his time believed, after Geoffrey of Monmouth and several learned Welshmen of the sixteenth century, that the Welsh were the descendants of Brutus and the true owners of the island of Britain. His most famous poem of all is a series of <i>englynion</i>, &#145;Farewell to Hendre Fechan&#146;  (T. Parry, <span class="italic">The Oxford Book of Welsh Verse</span>, 252). The nature of the poem led readers to think that he composed it on being turned out of his home for his political allegiance, but W. L. Davies suggested that it was composed by the poet in his old age, when he was conscious of his impending death.<br>
