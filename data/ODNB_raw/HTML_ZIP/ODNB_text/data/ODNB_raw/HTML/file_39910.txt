<span class="headword">Matthews,  Denis James</span>  (1919&#150;1988), <span class="occ">pianist and composer</span>, was born on 27 February 1919 in Coventry, the only child of Arthur Matthews, director of the Norman Engineering Company at Leamington Spa, and his wife, Elsie Culver, schoolteacher. His father committed suicide when Denis was twelve. He was educated at Warwick grammar school, where his musical gifts brought him to the attention of visiting adjudicators including Herbert Howells, who encouraged him to consider a career in music. Another was the pianist Harold Craxton, who offered to teach him. He won the Thalberg scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music in 1935, and studied composition with William Alwyn and the piano with Craxton, who welcomed him into a large and musical family circle, giving him a home as well as tuition and encouragement. His interests were initially in composition, and early works included songs and chamber music, which he later described as &#145;cosily derivative and romantic&#146;. However, a piano trio, performed at a student concert, excited favourable press attention; and in 1937 he added a composition scholarship to that for piano. His performing and composing abilities were sometimes combined, as when Sir Henry Wood conducted his symphonic movement for piano and orchestra. The list of his compositions eventually included a violin sonata, five sketches for violin and piano, a string quartet, and a partita for wind quintet for a fellow student, the horn player Dennis Brain.<br>
<br>Though some of his works were taken up by performers, and even published, Matthews found that his deepening interest in the classics&#151;Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven, in particular&#151;was directing him towards playing. His professional d&eacute;but came with a Promenade Concert in 1939, when he played Beethoven's third piano concerto under Sir Henry Wood. Beethoven was to remain central to his interests, and was the subject of many lecture recitals, some records expounding the sketch-books, and two BBC music guide booklets, <span class="italic">Beethoven Piano Sonatas</span> (1967) and <span class="italic">Brahms Piano Music</span> (1978). Matthews's writings also included a chapter on Beethoven, Schubert, and Brahms in a symposium he edited, <span class="italic">Keyboard Music</span> (1972), <span class="italic">Arturo Toscanini</span> (1982), and an autobiography, <span class="italic">In Pursuit of Music</span> (1966).<br>
<br>Having graduated from the Royal Academy of Music in 1940 with the LRAM (to which he added the Royal College of Music's ARCM, as well as the Worshipful Company of Musicians medal, 1938, for the most distinguished student), Matthews earned a living accompanying for opera and ballet classes, playing for social occasions such as City dinners, and occasionally giving concerts either alone or with student friends. He remained all his life an excellent sonata pianist, though latterly he seldom accompanied singers in lieder.<br>
<br>In 1940 Matthews was called up, entered the Royal Air Force, and, together with a number of other musicians who were to go on to make distinguished careers, joined the RAF central band at Uxbridge. He toured Germany at the end of the war with the central band, playing piano solos at the Potsdam conference to Josef Stalin, Winston Churchill, and Harry S. Truman. He also shared the keyboard with Truman.<br>
<br>Demobilized in 1946, Matthews was taken up by musicians including Dame Myra Hess, and solo engagements began to come in. He played concertos with John Barbirolli, Malcolm Sargent, Sir Thomas Beecham, Sir Adrian Boult, and other leading conductors, and toured widely; he had also begun making records in 1941, in a repertory centring on Mozart and Beethoven (and including a classic version of Beethoven's horn sonata with Dennis Brain), but also embracing modern British composers. He was closely associated with the London Mozart Players, founded in 1949 by another friend from the central band, Harry Blech. Concerts and recordings brought him wide popularity, and he embarked upon a career that took him all round the world. In 1955 he settled in Henley, where he and his friends took part in festival music-making. However, divorce in 1960 brought him back to London.<br>
<br>With the emergence of a post-war generation of virtuosi, Matthews found his career prospering less well in the 1960s. To his friends, he was candid about his powers, believing that he had been fortunate to make a career at a time when competition was less fierce. He was never a great technician, but the musicality of his playing gave his performances at their best an illuminating quality, and a sense of the music's essential structure and meaning. His interest in conveying this found a new outlet when in 1971 he was invited to be the first professor of music at the University of Newcastle. He ran an enterprising and successful department, while continuing to maintain a performing career. He retired in 1984. He was appointed CBE in 1975, and had honorary degrees from St Andrews (1973), Hull (1978), and Warwick (1982).<br>
<br>Though prey to private melancholy, Matthews was an amusing and warm-hearted companion. He was slightly built, with sandy hair and an expressive face that remained impassive during performance but could take on a lively, animated expression in the discussions about music which were his greatest joy. He retained a somewhat boyish appearance and manner. He married three times. In 1941 he married Mira Howe, a cellist, and they had one son and three daughters. The marriage was dissolved in 1960 and in 1963 he married Brenda, who had been brought up by Dr Samuel McDermott, a general practitioner in Swindon, and taken his surname. They had one son and one daughter. The marriage was dissolved in 1985 and in 1986 he married Beryl, a piano teacher, daughter of Arthur Harold Jordan Perry, owner of a textile firm. Matthews died by his own hand in Birmingham, on 24 December 1988, having suffered from bouts of severe depression, particularly after his marriage to Brenda McDermott broke up.<br>
