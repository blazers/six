</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wedderburn,  Alexander</span>, first earl of Rosslyn  (1733&#150;1805), <span class="occ">lord chancellor</span>, was born on 13 February 1733, probably in Edinburgh, the eldest of three children of Peter Wedderburn (<i>d</i>. 1756), advocate, and latterly judge, and his wife, Janet, daughter of David Ogilvie, an officer in a regiment of dragoons. Although his family owned a small estate outside Haddington called Chesterhall, it had long been associated with the legal profession in Scotland; his great-grandfather was Sir Peter Wedderburn (1616&#150;1679), a lord of the court of session under the title of Lord Gosford. His father had difficulty building a legal practice, and became secretary to the board of excise in Scotland. It was only a year before his death that he was elevated to the court of session as Lord Chesterhall. According to John Ramsay of Ochtertyre, Wedderburn's father derived most of his ideas &#145;upon most subjects&#146; from England, &#145;where, it is believed, he either received part of his education or spent part of his youth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scotland and Scotsmen</span>, 1.139). Ramsay suspected that Peter Wedderburn had spent some time at the inns of court in London as preparation for possible practice before the court of exchequer in Scotland, which had been created in 1707 to deal with revenue cases. Ramsay also remarked that Wedderburn's father spoke &#145;proper English&#146; at a time when the literati of Scotland were more concerned with the written language than its pronunciation, and that &#145;his manner of breeding [educating] his eldest son, the Lord Chancellor, was exceeding admired at the time&#146;  (ibid., 1.148). Ramsay also stated that Wedderburn's father was not only episcopalian but a member of the Church of England, attending the chapel in Edinburgh endowed by one of the English judges of the court of exchequer to provide public worship for Anglicans.<br>
<br>Wedderburn was educated at the famous burgh school kept at Dalkeith, Edinburghshire, by James Barclay, whose alumni included the historian and Church of Scotland minister William Robertson as a predecessor and the politician Henry Dundas at a later date. He matriculated at the University of Edinburgh at the age of thirteen early in 1746, before the last Jacobite rising in Scotland had come to an end. He did not take a degree, but at this time made the acquaintance of many of the leading figures of what is now called the Scottish Enlightenment. He attended the lectures Adam Smith presented on language and rhetoric in Edinburgh in 1748 and became a lifelong friend of Smith. He was known to David Hume who at that time was keeper of the Advocates' Library, and made the acquaintance of William Robertson, who with Hume was embarking on a career as a historian. He read law with those teaching it at Edinburgh, particularly John Erskine, author of <span class="italic">The Institutes of the Law of Scotland</span>. He also began to consider the possibility of practising in England, and with his father's approval was admitted to the Inner Temple in London on 8 May 1753 and began to visit that metropolis annually. He was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh in 1754 and began to practise in Edinburgh.<br>
<br>It was at this time that Edinburgh experienced a remarkable resurgence of club life supported by its professional middle class of lawyers, doctors, ministers, and professors, with the support of the Scottish gentry who still treated Edinburgh as a national centre of social life and culture. Of these clubs perhaps the most famous was the Select Society founded in 1754, whose members included Hume, Robertson, Smith, and many other prominent members of Edinburgh civic society. Wedderburn was called to the chair of the first meeting at the age of twenty-one. The following year he took a leading role in the publication of the &#145;first&#146; <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, a short-lived periodical which preceded its more famous successor by more than half a century. The intention was to review every publication originating in Scotland, and the preface to the first of the two issues which did appear is one of Wedderburn's few known publications. It was in effect a manifesto for a programme of social, economic, and cultural improvement in Scotland. Wedderburn stated that the journal's purpose was to establish &#145;the progressive state of learning in the country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, 1755, i&#150;iv).<br>
<br>Through the Select Society Wedderburn met a number of Robertson's fellow ministers in the Church of Scotland, including John Home, who were just beginning to operate self-consciously as a &#145;moderate party&#146; within the church, and in particular in its general assembly, where Wedderburn was selected as a lay elder for the parish of Inverkeithing and later Dunfermline. As such he took the lead in general assembly debates over whether David Hume could be called before the general assembly as a heretic. Wedderburn, Robertson, and the moderate party were successful in persuading the assembly that as Hume was no longer a member of the Church of Scotland, its general assembly had no authority over him. Later that year Wedderburn was part of the group which encouraged John Home to allow the public performance in Edinburgh of his play <span class="italic">Douglas</span>, and in 1757 Wedderburn argued unsuccessfully against attempts in the general assembly to forbid ministers of the Church of Scotland to attend theatrical productions.<br>
<br>This period of intense activity in Edinburgh by Wedderburn famously came to an end in August 1757 when he clashed before the bar of the court of session with the notoriously Jacobite, Scots-speaking dean of the Faculty of Advocates, Alexander Lockhart. The younger man allowed all his impatience at the weight of tradition at the bar and in Scotland generally to express itself in language directed at Lockhart and eventually at the bench itself. On being required to retract and apologize, Wedderburn took off his gown, laid it before the astonished judges, bowed, and left the court. That night he departed for London and the Inner Temple.<br>
<br>Wedderburn's struggle to establish himself in English practice was a difficult one, and at a time of pervasive English mistrust of Scots on the make, the transition from representing Anglicization as cultural improvement in Scotland to making professional progress as a Scottish lawyer and politician in England marked Wedderburn for life. Through his friendship with John Home, however, Wedderburn was introduced to the third earl of Bute and with his patronage was successful eventually in obtaining a Scottish seat, Ayr burghs, in parliament after the election of 1761. By 1763, with Bute's help, he was made king's counsel. He shocked lawyers on the northern circuit by appearing there in search of business in 1764. It was as a result of this foray that he met and subsequently married his first wife, on 31 December 1767, Betty Anne (<i>d</i>. 1781), only child and heir of John Dawson and Elizabeth Taylor of Morley, Yorkshire, &#145;with whom he Got &pound;10,000&#146; according to his friend Alexander Carlyle  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, ed. Burton, 230). By this time he had become principal legal adviser to Robert Clive on his return from India. This connection enabled him to defy the government of the day and speak in the Commons in support of Wilkes in 1769, and led to his move to a Shropshire seat, Bishop's Castle, in parliament under Clive's patronage. A year later he made his peace with the North ministry and became solicitor-general. He became a valued government speaker in the House of Commons during the difficult years of the American War of Independence and used his position to put pressure on Lord North to advance his legal career. He was made attorney-general in 1778 and in 1780 became chief justice of the court of common pleas and a peer as Baron Loughborough. His first wife died on 15 February 1781, and on 12 September 1782 he married Charlotte Courtenay (1751&#150;1825/6), fourth and youngest daughter of William Courtenay, first Viscount Courtenay (1710&#150;1762), of Powderham Castle and Frances Frich (1721&#150;1761). He had remarked in a letter of 5 September 1782 to a friend regarding his future wife that &#145;She is not a beauty, nor a wit, nor a fortune, neither does she profess any talents; but she has a good figure, a great deal of countenance, a very right understanding, and an exceedingly pleasant temper&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 11.174 n.). Their only child, William, died in infancy.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1780s Wedderburn was associated with the opposition whigs, having entered their camp via the Fox&#150;North coalition, during which he held office as first commissioner of the great seal from April to December 1783. His hopes of becoming lord chancellor were dashed by the failure of the coalition and the political success of the younger Pitt. His great rival legally and politically at this time was Edward Thurlow, who held the chancellorship as a member of Pitt's government. The outbreak of the French Revolution led to a chain of events in which Wedderburn once again revolved politically and came to join Pitt's wartime cabinet, eventually bringing William Bentinck, third duke of Portland, and other moderate opposition whigs in his wake. The initiator of negotiations was Wedderburn's fellow Scot Henry Dundas, who was anxious to identify a candidate to replace Thurlow as the latter became increasingly unreliable in his support of government measures in the House of Lords. When Thurlow was dismissed as chancellor in 1792 the great seal again went into commission. The imminence of war between France and Britain made it easier for Wedderburn to justify his latest political conversion and the gratification of his ambition. He became lord chancellor at the end of January 1793.<br>
<br>Wedderburn as lord chancellor followed Thurlow in identifying himself as the king's representative in the cabinet. Consequently he was not an ideal colleague in that he was capable of discussing cabinet business with the monarch without consulting fellow members of the ministry. For many years this was not a major problem but at the time when union with Ireland was undertaken and Catholic emancipation was proposed by Pitt as its corollary, Wedderburn, a past advocate of Roman Catholic relief as a member of North's ministry in 1779 and 1780, appears to have encouraged the king in the belief that by approving Catholic emancipation he would be violating the terms of his coronation oath. Wedderburn did not foresee that the issue would lead to the end of Pitt's ministry and his replacement by Henry Addington as a known opponent of emancipation. Neither had he realized that it would lead to his own removal as lord chancellor. This he found hard to accept or even believe, apparently continuing to attend cabinet after he had given up the seals until he was told not to do so. As a consolation for his loss he was created earl of Rosslyn on 21 April 1801, with his nephew, James St Clair Erskine, the son of his sister Janet Wedderburn and Sir Henry Erskine, named as heir to the title. He died less than four years later on 2 January 1805 at Baylis, Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, and was buried in St Paul's Cathedral on 12 January.<br>
<br>Wedderburn's place in British political history has not been viewed by many as a positive one. Early in his career he was referred to in <span class="italic">The Letters of Junius</span> as having &#145;something about him which even treachery cannot trust&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 11.174 n.) and biographers of Pitt have been stern in their disapproval. His friend Alexander Carlyle, who had met him in his early days as a young lawyer in Edinburgh, referred to Wedderburn ambiguously in several asides in his memoirs, recalling that when he first met Wedderburn in 1757 with a friend he &#145;open'd himself to us, as much as he was capable of Doing to any body&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, ed. Burton, 166). At another point, referring to a visit from Wedderburn, he stated that &#145;my friend Wedderburn Seldom Did any thing without a Reason&#146;  (ibid., 207). In an entry for 1764, Carlyle recalled Wedderburn's conversation as &#145;stiff and pompous&#146;, and his general demeanour while on circuit at Newcastle one of &#145;Self-conceit&#146;  (ibid., 230).<br>
<br>Wedderburn was a man of great application who attained considerable credit as a public speaker in the law courts and in parliament. No one ever described him as a great lawyer in the abstract sense, but he served as a judge in England for more than twenty years without discredit, and it could be argued that his Scottish training in civil law gave him a useful perspective in equity cases that was not available to those schooled exclusively in the English common law tradition. His early break with his Edinburgh education and upbringing and the need to pursue his career in what was in effect a foreign country, clearly influenced his political conduct in England and encouraged him in the development of a cold, detached public manner that contrasted with a private personality that could be warm, kindly, and charming. His insistence on securing the reversion of his peerage to the son of his beloved sister Janet indicated that he saw his essential loyalties as belonging to family just as in his political career he saw himself as personally loyal to George III as king rather than to a political party or an individual politician.<br>
