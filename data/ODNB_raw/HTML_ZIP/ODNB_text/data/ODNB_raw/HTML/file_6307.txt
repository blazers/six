<span class="headword">Corden,  William, the elder</span>  (1795&#150;1867), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born at Ashbourne, Derbyshire, on 21 January 1795, the son of Robert Corden (or Cordin) and his wife, Sarah. He was apprenticed at the china works at Derby under Robert Bloor, where he was employed to paint portraits, landscapes, and flowers on china. He painted much of a dessert service with illustrations after John Thurston for William Tegg's edition of the plays of Shakespeare (1812). On 25 September 1816 he married at St Alkmund's, Derby, Hester Simpson (1798/9&#150;1855); they had at least two sons and five daughters. About 1820, on completing his apprenticeship, Corden began to concentrate on portrait painting, painting first his employer, Bloor, and his wife. In 1820&#150;21 Corden painted figure subjects on a dessert service for the third Lord Henley-Ongley. The sixth duke of Devonshire acquired Berlin porcelain plates which Corden was allowed to copy; one, with a view of Chatsworth, may be from Corden's design. He seems to have been among the painters who decorated with landscapes and figures the enormously elaborate Rockingham dessert service (144 plates and 56 large pieces), made at Swinton between 1830 and 1837 for William IV, at the cost of &pound;5000. It was first used at Queen Victoria's coronation celebrations (Royal Collection).<br>
<br>Careless in firing, Corden was not technically a very good enamel painter, but was an excellent colourist. At Coalport, where he worked from 1820, Corden painted portraits onto blanks made in the factory for outside decoration. These china plaques became a popular new genre, especially in Derby and Nottingham. From 1824 Corden had a London address and exhibited three times at the Royal Academy; &#145;Hebe&#146;, on porcelain, was shown in 1826, and, in 1836, his last exhibit was a copy on china of Sir Thomas Lawrence's portrait of Sir Walter Scott (Royal Collection).<br>
<br>In July 1829 Corden was commissioned to paint one of the king's pages, a Mr Batchelor, at Windsor. He also painted Admiral Sir Edmund Nagle for George IV in 1829. Illness prevented the king from sitting to him, but the Marchioness Conyngham employed him at Windsor. Corden had settled at Windsor by 1836 where, in June 1838, he drew Queen Victoria on the East Terrace, and copies were made in miniature of his drawing (Royal Collection). A similar portrait  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 1901, 99) was there described as the first sketch made of her after her accession and was extensively copied by him on ivory and porcelain. For Queen Victoria, Corden painted very many life-size oil copies after portraits in the Royal Collection. In 1844 Prince Albert arranged that Corden should visit Coburg to copy Saxe-Coburg family portraits.<br>
<br>From 1854 Corden was again employed in the Staffordshire potteries. There he worked with the miniature painter and photographer, Mr Scaife of Baker Street, on a project (which proved unsuccessful) to combine enamelling with photography. Following the death of his first wife he married, in 1859, Betsey Wood Mannin. Corden died at Nottingham on 18 June 1867.<br>
<br>His son, <a name="cosubject_75182"></a><span class="headword">William Corden the younger</span>  (1819&#150;1900), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Derby, where he was baptized at St Alkmund's Church on 19 August 1819; he moved with his family to Windsor in 1829. He studied and worked with his father and they travelled together to Coburg in 1844 where he painted six watercolour views of the town for Prince Albert. The younger Corden was sent to Lisbon in 1850 by Queen Victoria and the prince to copy the portrait of Ferdinand, king consort of Portugal, by Ferdinand Krumholz. Instead it was arranged that he should himself paint full-lengths of Queen Maria II and her husband (Royal Collection). Corden was constantly employed by Queen Victoria to copy portraits in her collection, usually as presents. These included about fifty by F. X. Winterhalter and others by such artists as H. von Angeli, A. Graefle, H. R. Graves, G. Koberwein, R. Lauchert, J. Lucas, and J. Sant. Corden also painted photographs of watercolours for the queen. He exhibited eight works, including subject pictures, at the Royal Academy, between 1843 and 1855, and one at the British Institution. He married on 4 August 1857 Elizabeth, youngest daughter of Francis Burt, alderman and grocer, of Windsor. They had at least two sons and one daughter. William Corden the younger died on 7 September 1900 at Salisbury Terrace, Newbury, Berkshire, and was buried in Newtown Road cemetery, Newbury. His son, Victor Milton Corden (1860&#150;1939), painter of landscape and military subjects, who was baptized on 28 July 1860 at Datchet, Buckinghamshire, also worked for Queen Victoria.<br>
