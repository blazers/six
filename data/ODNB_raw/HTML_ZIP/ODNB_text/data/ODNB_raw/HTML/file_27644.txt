<span class="headword">Toy,  John</span>  (1608<span class="mult">x</span>11&#150;1663), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and headmaster</span>, was born in Worcester, the son of John Toy, mercer, of Worcester, sometime clerk of the parish of St Swithun in the city; he had married Fortune Burton, widow, in 1608. Toy was educated at the King's School, Worcester, as a non-foundationer. On 27 April 1627 he received an exhibition of 40<i>s</i>. per annum from the dean and chapter to support three years' further study. He was admitted to Pembroke College, Oxford, the same year (when he was said to be sixteen) as a servitor or batteler. He matriculated on 23 May 1628, graduated BA on 27 January 1631, and proceeded MA on 2 July 1634.<br>
<br>Toy subsequently became chaplain to the bishop of Hereford. In 1638 he published <span class="italic">Worcester's Elegie and Eulogie</span>, an account of the epidemic which killed 1500 people in the city between June 1637 and 1638. Toy ascribed the plague to God's anger at the citizens' failure to take heed of His (and Toy's) previous warnings, though he conceded that Worcester was no more wicked than the average cathedral city. At Michaelmas 1638 he became gospeller of the cathedral. In the following year of account he was listed as a minor canon. On 22 October 1641 he was instituted to the rectory of Stoke Prior, Worcestershire. A week later he received a lease of a house in the cathedral precinct for the term of his ministry there. He published a sermon given at the funeral in February 1642 of Alice, wife of the cathedral organist, Thomas Tomkins.<br>
<br>At about this time Toy became master of the city school. He moved to the headmastership of the King's School, probably in the summer of 1644. Along with the rest of the collegiate body, he was deprived after the city's surrender to parliament in July 1646. He retired to his vicarage, but was sequestrated from that also in 1649. In the course of this year he sent to the press his <span class="italic">Grammaticae Graecae Enchiridion in usum scholae collegialis Wigorniae</span>, published the following year, which possibly helped to secure his appointment to the headmastership of Queen Mary's School, Walsall, in 1650. One of his pupils there, Dr Philip Fouke, later commended Toy's teaching as successful &#145;even among triumphing rebels&#146; (&#145;inter perduelles triumphantes&#146;) and without resort to lashings and scourgings (&#145;flagris et verberibus&#146;; inscription in British Library copy of Toy's <span class="italic">Quisquillae poeticae</span>, 1662; transcribed with translation in Macdonald, 135).<br>
<br>Toy was restored to the headmastership of the King's School in September 1660 and he also regained his living. One of his pupils during his second term at Worcester may have been the future Lord Chancellor Somers. Toy died on 28 December 1663 and was buried two days later in the south transept of the cathedral. His widow, Martha, died on 10 April 1677, aged sixty-nine, and was buried at Stoke Prior.<br>
