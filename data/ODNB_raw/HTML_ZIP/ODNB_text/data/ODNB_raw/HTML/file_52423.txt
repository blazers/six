<span class="headword">Peel,  Thomas</span>  (1793?&#150;1865), <span class="occ">settler in Australia</span>, was the second son of Thomas Peel (1768&#150;1843) of Peelfold, Lancashire, a calico manufacturer and landowner, and his wife, Dorothy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bolton (1769&#150;1837), and the great-nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21763/', "Sir Robert Peel (1750&#150;1830)")</script>. He was educated at Harrow School (1806&#150;11) and was then briefly put to an attorney's office, but apparently followed no occupation until his marriage in 1823 to Mary Charlotte Dorking Ayrton (1800&#150;1857), the daughter of Mrs Bridget Ayrton (<i>c</i>.1758&#150;1845) and possibly of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/948/', "Dr Edmund Ayrton")</script>; they had two daughters and two sons. Another son by an unknown mother was born in 1819. The Peels resided at Carnourie, near Forglen, Banffshire, from 1825 to 1827 or 1828, when Peel decided to claim his share of the family estate (probably &pound;20,000) and emigrate to Australia. In London he met Captain James Stirling, who was vigorously promoting a new colony at the Swan River in Western Australia. With three fellow members of the Windham Club, Peel formed an association to bring 10,000 settlers to Western Australia in return for a land grant of 4 million acres. They proposed cultivating tobacco, cotton, sugar, and flax; none of these crops has ever flourished subsequently in the region, and none of the partners had experience of them. In December 1828 the Colonial Office responded, offering no more than a million acres. The other partners withdrew, but in January 1829 Peel found a substitute in Solomon Levey, a prosperous ex-convict who had returned from New South Wales to his native London. With Levey as financier and Peel as front man they formed a partnership in April 1829 with the more realistic goal of bringing 400 settlers to Western Australia for a land grant of 250,000 acres. The scheme was unfairly attacked in the London press as a piece of political jobbery undertaken on his cousin's behalf by the home secretary, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21764/', "Robert Peel (1788&#150;1850)")</script>.<br>
<br>Peel left Plymouth on the <i>Gilmore</i> in August 1829 with the first party of settlers, arriving at the Swan River on 15 December, too late for the deadline prescribed by the Colonial Office for selecting his first choice of land. His settlers were disembarked at Woodman's Point, 7 miles south of Fremantle, at a town site named Clarence, and Peel accepted a land grant 40 miles further south on the Murray River. Morale was poor at Clarence, scurvy and dysentery broke out, the arrival of more settlers strained resources further, and Peel injured his right hand by gunshot, either accidentally or through a duel. By the end of 1830 Clarence was abandoned and Peel settled permanently at Mandurah at the mouth of the Murray. In <span class="italic">England and America</span> (1833) E. G. Wakefield gave a highly coloured and inaccurate account of Peel's venture in support of his theory that cheap land led to labour shortages and an inefficient dispersal of settlement. Although refuted by writers with first-hand information, Wakefield's story influenced later writers such as Karl Marx, and discouraged investment and settlement in Western Australia.<br>
<br>In April 1834 Peel's wife landed in Perth with her mother and children, and in October he took part in the &#145;battle&#146; of Pinjarra, when Governor Stirling led a punitive expedition against the local Aborigines (the Pindjarup Nyungar) to clear the Murray region for European settlement. In 1839 he was elected to the General Road Trust and nominated a justice of the peace, and the following January he was appointed to the legislative council, but he resigned these offices in 1841, a year after his wife and daughters returned to London. Because of his cantankerous temperament he never subsequently played a prominent role in Western Australian public life, though he accompanied Governor Charles Fitzgerald to the Champion Bay district in 1852. He died, reputedly after a surfeit of ripe figs, at Mandurah on 21 December 1865 and was buried at Mandurah, where an Anglican church was built as a memorial to him. He was a large man of imposing appearance, but his ambitions were disappointed and his friend Henry Lefroy wrote later that he &#145;never saw corroding care so strongly marked on any man's face as his&#146;. The Peel estate passed to the Colonization Assurance Corporation, and was bought in 1920 by the Western Australian government for a highly unsuccessful soldier settlement scheme.<br>
