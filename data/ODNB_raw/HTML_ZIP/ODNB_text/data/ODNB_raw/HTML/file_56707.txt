<span class="headword">Hewins,  (Margaret) Nancy</span>  (1902&#150;1978), <span class="occ">theatre director and actress</span>, was born on 14 February 1902 at The Rowans, Putney Common, London, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33848/', "Professor William Albert Samuel Hewins (1865&#150;1931)")</script>, economist, and his wife, Margaret Slater. She had a sister and a brother. Nancy founded and led what seems to have been Britain's first all-women professional theatre company. She introduced Shakespeare to many audiences, often of schoolchildren, in industrial towns and remote villages.<br>
<br>Nancy Hewins was educated in London at Queen's Gate School, and then at St Hugh's College, Oxford (1921&#150;4). Here she became fascinated by the theatre, and by lighting and sets in particular. On graduating in 1924, she started an amateur company called the Isis Players which played Shakespeare in tough east London schools, using floodlights made from old biscuit tins. A switch to professionalism brought a change of name. The Osiris Players' first production was <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> in December 1927. Until it ceased touring in 1963, the company performed against all the odds throughout Great Britain and Ireland.<br>
<br>Nancy Hewins devoted her life to Osiris. It was always all-women, and never had more than seven players at a time. Everybody did everything: acting, props, cooking; Nancy also played the flute. Shakespeare was the heart of the repertory. Scenes were cut and minor speeches transposed to make the doubling work. Lady Macbeth was one of Nancy's parts and, applying a fresh makeup at speed, she could change from this to the Porter within a few lines. Osiris travelled in black and white Rolls-Royces, usually two at a time. Nancy Hewins said they were the only cars that could take the strain when they were piled high with bedding and scenery, on which players lay flat, learning their parts. They also accommodated her Belgian griffons, which she always took with her, one playing Moon's dog in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>.<br>
<br>Nancy Hewins's family came from the Black Country. She was proud of her midland origins and liked to think she was a relative of the John Hewins who married Shakespeare's aunt Agnes. She built on her family connections, starting her out-of-London tours in Wolverhampton, where her father had attended the grammar school; from the late 1930s she based herself and the company in the Cotswolds near Broadway. Her father was the first director of the London School of Economics and briefly a Conservative MP. He knew Lord Rothermere who gave Nancy &pound;40 which helped her to launch Osiris. Her godmother was the pioneer socialist Beatrice Webb, whose christening present of a silver teapot she kept all her life. Through her Nancy gained helpful introductions to local co-operative society education departments.<br>
<br>Nancy Hewins's finest hour, perhaps, came during the Second World War. She put on 1534 performances of thirty-three plays (sixteen of them by Shakespeare) in wartime, with the company travelling for a time by horse and dray because of petrol restrictions. She celebrated Osiris's twenty-first birthday at a women's institute in Kent with <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> in the morning, <span class="italic">Everyman</span> at lunchtime, <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> in the afternoon, Shaw's <span class="italic">Captain Brassbound's Conversion</span> after tea, and <span class="italic">Badger's Green</span>, R. C. Sherriff's comedy about village cricket, in the evening.<br>
<br>Nancy Hewins reckoned she had eventually played 128 Osiris parts herself. She was not a subtle actress; sets and lighting remained her first love. But her productions left an indelible impression on her young audiences, many of whom had never seen any professional theatre outside the music hall or the Christmas pantomime. Her principle was that no one could understand Shakespeare unless they enjoyed it. &#145;The play had to come alive to the children&#146;, she wrote in her unpublished autobiography. Osiris also played to other local audiences, including unemployed miners in the Rhondda and munitions workers. If there was no proper stage, the company would play in the round. Few players, outside the steady core of three or four, survived more than a few years. On tour they slept in barns, on school floors, even a park caf&eacute;. &#145;Digs&#146; were too expensive. If emotional complications arose, Nancy Hewins's remedies were sal volatile or a teaspoon of brandy.<br>
<br>Theatre was a mission to Nancy Hewins. Everything was subordinated to the task of keeping Osiris on the road. To begin with, she augmented the funds by working as lighting director on other productions, especially pageants. The company was never publicly subsidized. Nancy Hewins was ahead of her time in acting in improvised venues to regional audiences, though she was also in the great tradition of strolling players. &#145;I dare say if the company had had a Russian name&#146;, she wrote, &#145;it would have been regarded as a remarkable experiment.&#146; The costumes had a bright, Renaissance glamour: hessian or canvas, painted in vivid reds or golds. They were uncomfortable to wear, but they folded flat. Everything had to be tough and durable. When she played Claudius in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, she wore the Ghost's armour underneath, for quick changing. In her later years, she made a modest living by renting the costumes out.<br>
<br>Nancy Hewins was stubborn, even dogmatic, and said what she thought, but she evoked great loyalty among her actresses. She never married and had no personal vanity. She loved practical things. Interviewing one would-be actress, she made it clear that the important thing was to be able to change a car wheel. To many young people, for more than thirty years, the arrival of her Osiris company brought the first experience of theatrical magic into their lives.<br>
<br>Nancy Hewins died of heart failure at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, on 17 January 1978. She was buried at St Peter's Church, Willersey, Gloucestershire.<br>
