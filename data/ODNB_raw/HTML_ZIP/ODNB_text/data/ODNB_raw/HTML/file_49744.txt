<span class="headword">Boddington,  George</span>  (1646&#150;1719), <span class="occ">merchant and Independent lay leader</span>, was born on 15 October 1646, the first surviving son of George Boddington (1611&#150;1671), packer, of St Margaret, Lothbury, London, and Hannah, daughter of Thomas Adams, of Philpot Lane, St Clement, Eastcheap, London. He was educated at various schools in London. Acquiring a zeal for trade from his father, Boddington also absorbed the piety of a puritan mother, who instilled good principles of religion and morals in all her children. He came of age in the late 1660s, at a time of great uncertainty caused by the conjunction of plague, fire, and war and the persecution of protestant nonconformists. Dating his spiritual conversion to the plague-time renewal of visible dissenting ministry, Boddington was admitted to the congregation of Thomas Vincent, which by the end of the decade worshipped in a purpose-built meeting-house. In 1669 the elder George Boddington was chosen for the common council of the corporation as the dissenting civic &eacute;lite of the protectorate re-established their presence in London affairs. In 1670 the younger Boddington's pastor was among those dissenting clergy whose convictions under a new <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span> prompted street confrontations in the City. Boddington's marriage on 19 December 1671 also indicated the political and religious milieu of the family. His wife, Mary Steele, who brought him a portion of &pound;2000, was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26350/', "William Steele")</script>, radical lawyer, Independent recorder of London (1649&#150;55), lord chief baron of the exchequer (1655&#150;6), and lord chancellor of Ireland (1656&#150;60).<br>
<br>Despite these early indications of outspoken dissent, Boddington seems always to have preferred his trade and family to a public life. Admitted freeman of the Levant Company in 1666, he was comfortably established by his father in the Turkey trade, despite the latter's considerable fire losses. The young merchant also entered the Clothworkers' Company and learned the Baltic trade as bookkeeper to an Eastland merchant. After his first wife, Mary, died in childbirth in 1673, Boddington married on 2 July 1674 Hannah (<i>d</i>. 1699), daughter of John Cope, Cannon Street haberdasher, who brought him another significant portion and with whom he had fourteen children. By 1677 he had settled in the parish of St Helen's, Bishopsgate, where he remained throughout his career. In 1678, when Thomas Vincent's successor compromised the congregational order of Boddington's church, he left for the Lime Street meeting, in which he remained active thereafter.<br>
<br>Like many other prominent City dissenters, Boddington signed the London petition of May 1679 intended to encourage parliamentary consideration of exclusion. His brother James (1652&#150;1731), a packer, signed a subsequent London whig petition; but George Boddington is not known to have taken any further part in London politics during the exclusion era. He was, nevertheless, one of more than 300 Londoners temporarily incarcerated in 1685 at the time of Monmouth's rebellion.<br>
<br>The London port books for the 1680s and 1690s show Boddington importing silk, mohair, and cotton from Iskenderun, Leghorn, and Smyrna and exporting cloth to the Mediterranean and the Levant, to the Baltic, and to Hudson's Bay and New England. The volume of his trade was considerable, but not exceptional.<br>
<br>The revolution of 1688 and the financial developments that followed the establishment of the Bank of England in 1694 found Boddington at the zenith of his career. Like many other City nonconformists grateful for the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span>, he subscribed to the post-1689 corporation of London loans to the new government of William and Mary. In 1694 his subscription of &pound;2000 to the bank brought him election to its first court of directors. Finding that the bank took up too much of his time, however, he disposed of his stock. He was similarly diffident about political office. Although repeatedly nominated for the London common council by the vestry of his parish between 1688 and 1692, he refused to take the sacramental test when actually chosen for 1689/90. Whether Boddington had changed his mind about the test by the time of his return to parliament, as a whig, representing Wilton, Wiltshire, in July 1702 is unknown. In any case he was unseated by the Commons; and the tory uproar about dissenting activism in Wilton in this election was instrumental in launching the first <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity Bill</span> under Queen Anne. In the meantime Boddington had served his parish, as churchwarden, and his congregation, as an officer of two funds for the support of the dissenting clergy: the short-lived Common Fund (1690&#150;93) of Presbyterians and Independents and the subsequently established Congregational Fund. He was also Greenland Company governor (1693), Levant Company assistant (1695, 1701, 1703), and Clothworkers' Company master (1705).<br>
<br>Reflecting upon his career near its conclusion, Boddington dwelt upon none of this recognition but rather upon the providential preservation of his eldest son, George, and much of his trading stock in the Smyrna fleet disaster of 1693. But his final years were troubled by family misfortunes. He rescued his bankrupt brother; and he blamed personal losses upon the mismanagement of his son George, his Turkish factor, and a Smyrna consul, who also married a Roman Catholic. The career of a promising son-in-law, Robert Wakeman, a marine insurer, was clipped by the West Indies fleet loss of 1703 and closed by a premature death as consul in Cyprus.<br>
<br>Boddington died at his house in the parish of St Helen's in London on 10 May 1719, mentioning in his will almost &pound;20,000 in previous or new bequests and several City properties. He had invested the family future not in land, as did some successful mercantile contemporaries, but rather in three sons (Thomas, Isaac, and Benjamin), who succeeded him in the Levant trade. Still embarrassed by the public extravagance of his first wedding, he ordered a &#145;private and frugall&#146; night burial.<br>
