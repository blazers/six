<span class="headword">Ball,  Thomas</span>  (1590&#150;1659), <span class="occ">hagiographer and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Alberbury, Shropshire, of unknown parents. In 1613 he was appointed usher of a Mr Puller's school at Epping, Essex, and it was his employer's letter of recommendation which introduced him to John Preston of Queens' College, Cambridge. Ball entered the college in 1615, graduated BA in 1622, and was one of the &#145;twelve disciples&#146;  (Ball, 86) who followed Preston to Emmanuel College when he became master. Proceeding to MA in 1625, Ball was elected a fellow, and ordained a priest at Peterborough on 19 May 1627. In 1628 Preston, on his deathbed, bequeathed to Ball his pupils&#151;Lord Saye and Sele's brother and the sons of the earl of Warwick and Sir John Pickering. Ball wrote the life of his mentor, later included in Samuel Clarke's collection of godly lives, and collaborated with Richard Sibbes and Thomas Goodwin to produce a posthumous edition of Preston's sermons. On 11 November 1629 he acceded to a request from the corporation of Northampton to become vicar of its church of All Saints. With his first wife, Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1631), he had a daughter, Elizabeth.<br>
<br>Ball was a prominent member of a self-consciously godly community centred on Northampton and an active organizer of local opposition to crown policies of the 1620s and 1630s. Through Preston he was associated with national opponents of the regime, especially Christopher Sherland, who described him as his &#145;reverend and pious friend&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/161/10), and Lord Saye. On 5 June 1633 Ball married Sherland's widow, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Oglethorpe (<i>d</i>. 1635): Ruth was their only child. Ball regarded Preston and himself as guardians of a Calvinist orthodoxy which by 1626 had been abandoned by the crown in favour of an anti-Calvinist &#145;prelaticall&#146;  (Ball, 101) party&#151;&#145;several of the Bishops &hellip; were Arminians&#146;  (ibid., 123)&#151;which sought to replace the authority of scripture with &#145;unwritten Traditions&#146;  (ibid., 124) while marginalizing orthodox Calvinists as treasonous puritans. His public opposition began in 1627 when he defaulted over payment of the forced loan at Northampton (before becoming vicar), and in 1633 he omitted to read the anti-sabbatarian <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span>. He was repeatedly harassed by the church courts for not administering the communion in the Laudian fashion&#151;only to those who kneeled at the altar rails&#151;and for not bowing at the mention of Jesus's name. In turn, godly backsliders who conformed were condemned by Ball and Saye. Despite pressure from the courts (which discouraged afternoon sermons) Ball preached twice on Sundays and invited an impressive range of visiting ministers to read the Thursday lecture in contravention of royal instructions of 1633. The next year he was suspended for preaching controversial doctrine. The Northampton pulpit was used to sound a clarion call against &#145;Idolatry&#146; and its sponsors, the &#145;p[er]secutors of [Christ]ians&#146;  (Woodford's diary, 135), while Ball and Saye attended a public fast in support of Laudianism's opponents, Henry Burton, John Bastwick, and William Prynne. During the 1630s Ball also acted as the intermediary between Northamptonshire puritans and John Durie, who planned to establish a pan-protestant union against Catholicism; Ball worked with William Twisse on the project.<br>
<br>In November 1637 Ball married his third wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1660), the widow of a Mr Hatch. They had eight children, Thomas, Jane, Samuel, Nathaniel, Martha, Dorothy, Timothy, and Joseph. Ball canvassed for the godly candidate, Sir Gilbert Pickering (his former pupil), in the shire contest for the Short Parliament. He had omitted to pay the clerical tax to fund the bishops' wars, was prominent at the clerical conference at Kettering in August 1640 which supported the aims of the invading Scots, and refused to take the &#145;etcetera oath&#146; legitimizing the new ecclesiastical canons.<br>
<br>During the civil war Ball acted as adviser to the local committee for plundered ministers, which was dominated by Pickering. In 1648 he subscribed to the Northamptonshire agreement with the London testimony in support of presbyterian church government and in 1656 published <span class="italic">Pastorum propugnaculum</span> in defence of a national ordained ministry against the attacks of the sectaries. He died at Northampton in 1659 and was buried in All Saints' Church on 21 June; the funeral oration was preached by the Presbyterian John Howes.<br>
