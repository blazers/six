<span class="headword">Williams,  Hugh William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Grecian Williams]</span>  (1773&#150;1829), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was probably born in Devon. The tradition that he was the son of a Welsh sea captain, though current during the lifetime of his wife, appears to have no foundation. Nothing is known of his early years except that by 1790 his board and lodging, in the house of a Dalkeith bookseller, was being paid for by one Louis Ruffini, an &eacute;migr&eacute; Italian manufacturer of embroidered muslin.<br>
<br>Williams almost certainly learned his draughtsmanship with Ruffini's encouragement; the production of fabric designs was an important part of such a business. It is possible too that he took classes with David Allan and Alexander Nasmyth. By 1793 he appears to have been working in Glasgow, where, with Alexander Galloway, he advertised a drawing academy. He published his first print, a view of Glasgow, in 1794.<br>
<br>By the time Williams had exhibited his first work at the Royal Academy, in 1800, he was living in Edinburgh once more. Shortly afterwards he appears also to have attempted to join the growing circle of professional watercolour painters active in London; he was a founding member (along with his fellow Scot Andrew Wilson) of the short-lived Associated Artists in Water-Colours in 1807. He was also a founding member of Scotland's first exhibiting society, the Associated Society of Artists, formed in Edinburgh in 1808. Williams was always anxious to see his work reproduced in print; many of his early topographical drawings appeared in the <span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span>. In 1813 he published a series of six large engravings of scenes in the Scottish highlands.<br>
<br>In June 1816 Williams embarked on an extensive journey through Italy and Greece in the company of his friend and patron William Douglas of Orchardton MP. They visited Rome, Athens, Malta, Sicily, and Naples before returning to Edinburgh in 1818. The material gathered on this journey was central to his output for the remainder of his career, and earned him the name Grecian Williams, by which he is known. An account of his journey, <span class="italic">Travels in Italy, Greece and the Ionian Islands</span>, appeared in 1820. Written in the form of letters, and dedicated to his fellow landscape painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27314/', "John Thomson of Duddingston")</script>, the illustrations were engraved by W. H. Lizars from drawings by the author. In 1822 and 1826 Williams held exhibitions of the powerful watercolours, on a substantial scale, which he had produced after his travels. Another illustrated publication, his <span class="italic">Select Views in Greece</span>, appeared between 1823 and 1829. Williams had married Robina Miller (<i>d</i>. 1874) of Garnock on 6 July 1827. They had no children.<br>
<br>Although he painted a number of landscapes in oil, including a view of Castle Urquhart, Loch Ness (NG Scot.), Williams's principal and more characteristic work was executed in watercolour, which he handled in broad washes of transparent colour. The influence of Turner on Williams's work is not hard to detect. The two men knew each other and evidently sketched together in the company of John Thomson of Duddingston. Turner apparently admired Williams's watercolours although in scale and conception they were entirely at odds with his own treatment of the landscape. At the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, five drawings, three of which are dated before 1807, represent his earlier style. The most substantial group of his works, including some of his grandest views in Greece, are now in the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh. These were presented by his widow in 1859 and have subsequently been badly discoloured through extended display. Williams was closely involved in the preparations for the establishment of the Scottish Academy, in 1826, but he had been ill for some time before his death on 14 June 1829 at his home, 65 Castle Street, Edinburgh. He was buried on 22 June in the Canongate Kirk, Edinburgh.<br>
