<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mansel,  Henry Longueville</span>  (1820&#150;1871), <span class="occ">dean of St Paul's and theologian</span>, was born on 6 October 1820 at Cosgrove, Northamptonshire, where his father, also called Henry Longueville (1783&#150;1835), was rector of the parish. His mother, Maria Margaret Longueville, was the daughter of Admiral Sir Robert Moorsom. The Mansel (Maunsell, Mansell) family were for some centuries landowners in Buckinghamshire. Early in the seventeenth century one Samuel Maunsell acquired by marriage the property of Cosgrove, where his descendants thereafter lived. Young Henry's grandfather John was a soldier who attained the rank of major-general and who fought and fell at the battle of Coteau in Flanders in 1794. The boy's uncle Robert served in the Royal Navy and became an admiral. The fourth of eight children, six of whom were girls, Henry was brought up at Cosgrove, a pleasant village for which he retained a lifelong affection.<h2>
<a name="Education"></a>Education</h2>After attending a preparatory school at East Farndon, Mansel entered the Merchant Taylors' School, London, in autumn 1830. Here he soon displayed the aptitudes of a scholar, loving books&#151;on which he readily spent his pocket money&#151;and despising games. He wrote regularly for the school magazine and in 1830 published a little book of verses, <span class="italic">The Demons of the Wind and other Poems</span>, with a fairly obvious debt to Coleridge and Shelley but not without intrinsic merit. On his father's death in 1835 his mother left Northamptonshire and resided in London for a few years, but returned to Cosgrove in 1842, where a house had been bequeathed especially for her use. In 1838 Henry won the school prize for English verse, and also a medal for Hebrew awarded by Sir Moses Montefiore, distinctions to be followed by further prizes, now in classics, in 1839, the year in which he matriculated as a scholar of St John's College, Oxford. Here the promise he showed at school was borne out by the diligence he applied to his studies in classics and mathematics. He was likewise assiduous in his religious observance, attending college chapel daily. He was no swot, however, and enjoyed the company of his fellow undergraduates, with whom he was popular. His tutor in his last two years, Archdeacon James Augustus Hessey, was impressed both by his refusal to shirk difficulties and by his keen sense of humour. The result of his efforts was that he gained a double first in his finals, although at his <i>viva voce</i> examination he risked his chances by arguing with the examiner about what he regarded as a false assumption in the first question put to him, so causing a protracted discussion. Such pertinacity was to prove not untypical of the mature man. The same characteristic may even have been present in the child, coupled, it might seem, with precocity in metaphysics: his mother used to relate of him that at a still tender age he would perplex himself with the question: &#145;<i>My</i> hand: <i>my</i> foot. But what is <i>me</i>?&#146;  (Burgon, 2.157).<h2>
<a name="CareeratOxfordUniversityandmarriage"></a>Career at Oxford University and marriage</h2>On graduating Mansel remained in Oxford, a city which was to be his home for most of his life. Clearly his work was to teach, and he began to take in pupils immediately, being very soon in great demand as a tutor. But ordination to the ministry was his intention; at Christmas 1844 he was made deacon, and a year later he was ordained priest by the bishop of Oxford. Mansel continued to apply himself to his studies, however, learning French and German and improving his Hebrew. He also started to read ecclesiastical history. His presence in St John's senior common room was a marked asset to college life by reason of his conversational gifts, enhanced by wide-ranging knowledge and an often scintillating wit, despite, perhaps, his fondness for puns. His high-tory politics matched his high-churchmanship, giving him the air, for all his youth, of a typical don of the old school. His earliest academic publications were in the field of logic: <span class="italic">Ars logicae rudimenta</span> (1847), a revised version of Henry Aldrich's much-used textbook, and <span class="italic">Prolegomena logica</span> (1851), on the philosophy of science. But his &#145;fragments of an Aristophanic drama&#146;, <span class="italic">Phrontisterion</span> (1850), was a signal demonstration of his talent for satirical verse. In it he depicted the invasion of Oxford by a host of German philosophers and theologians:<blockquote>
<div>Theologians we,<br>
</div>
<div>Deep thinkers and free,<br>
</div>
<div>From the land of the new Divinity;<br>
</div>
<div>Where critics hunt for the sense sublime,<br>
</div>
<div>Hidden in texts of the olden time,<br>
</div>
<div>Which none but the sage can see.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>A Strauss, a Bauer, a Feuerbach are then each neatly lampooned. So,<blockquote>
<div>Presbyters, bend,<br>
</div>
<div>Bishops, attend:<br>
</div>
<div>The <span class="roman">Bible's</span> a myth from beginning to end.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Phrontisterion</span>, 2nd edn, 1852, 14&#150;15)</blockquote>The occasion for this <i>jeu d'esprit</i> was the appointment by Lord John Russell of a commission on university reform.<br>
<br>In 1849 Mansel applied for the university chair of logic, but unsuccessfully. Five years later he was elected to the hebdomadal council, heading the poll for members of convocation regardless, it seems, of his junior standing and comparative youth. On 16 August 1855 he married Charlotte Augusta (1824/5&#150;1908), daughter of Daniel Taylor of Clapham Common, London, a union which brought him lifelong happiness; she herself was to outlive him by very many years, dying in 1908 at the age of eighty-three. As a married man he gave up residence in college and took a home of his own in the High Street. On 17 May in the same year he was elected to the Waynflete readership in moral and metaphysical philosophy at Magdalen College, becoming the first Waynflete professor in that subject in 1859, without, however, receiving the full professorial salary until 1862. In April 1864 he was re-elected professor-fellow at St John's, a token of the college's respect, which greatly pleased him.<h2>
<a name="Manselstheology"></a>Mansel's theology</h2>Mansel's inaugural lecture on the Waynflete foundation was published in 1855, and another on Kant in 1856, while in 1857 he wrote the article &#145;Metaphysics&#146; for the eighth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. In that year, too, he was selected as Bampton lecturer for 1858. The title he chose for the latter undertaking was &#145;The limits of religious thought examined&#146;, and the delivery and subsequent publication in 1859 of the lectures became the event on which his memory now largely rests. They were certainly arresting&#151;for the Bamptons quite unusually so&#151;and in outcome controversial, particularly for the vigorous attack on their whole argument levelled by Frederick Denison Maurice, one of the best-known theologians of the day.<br>
<br>Mansel derived his thesis from the Scottish philosopher Sir William Hamilton, whose &#145;philosophy of the conditioned&#146; owed much to Kant. Knowledge, Hamilton contended, is from the very nature of the human mind itself limited to the conditioned: what is unconditioned, free of all determining circumstances, is incognizable and inconceivable, serving only as the negative of the conditioned and relative. When, that is, a fact is said to be known, it is so only as limited or conditioned by other facts known in conjunction with it. But he went on to maintain that what is conditioned necessarily implies the unconditioned as its complement or ground, albeit only as the negative of the conditioned. Hamilton did not himself venture upon the theological terrain, but his remarks that &#145;a God understood would be no god at all&#146;, and that &#145;to think that God is, as we think him to be, is blasphemy&#146;  (W. Hamilton, <span class="italic">Discussions on Philosophy and Literature, Education and University Reform</span>, 2nd edn, 1853, 15 n.), indicated the way in which his own philosophy, he thought, might provide &#145;the most useful auxiliary to theology&#146;  (ibid., 621). Mansel accordingly pressed the case that the speculative reason has no place in theology, which gains nothing from such spurious metaphysical help. If indeed philosophers had been less ready to assume the possibility of a purely rational knowledge they would have spared themselves the illusions of both idealism and scepticism. And the limits of philosophy in general must be applicable to religious philosophy in particular. In either realm, consciousness of the infinite or the absolute, both of which are contradictory of the finite and relative, whereof alone&#151;such being the constitution of the human mind&#151;we can have knowledge, is not open to us. Religion speaks of God as personal, but personality, as we understand it, implies limitation. Inevitably the language of religion is anthropomorphic, and is the better for being so:<blockquote>It is only by conceiving [God] as a Conscious Being, that we can stand in any religious relation to Him at all, that we can form such a representation of Him as is demanded by our spiritual wants, insufficient though it is to satisfy our intellectual curiosity. (H. L. Mansel, <span class="italic">The Limits of Religious Thought Examined</span>, 1859, 61)</blockquote>But for the religious believer this metaphysical incapacity is made good by divine revelation, contained, for the Christian, in the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, under forms relating directly to human experience. Its truths are not presentative but regulative only, valid <i>quoad nos</i>, in our human and &#145;fallen&#146; situation. To criticize the revelation is pointless; it must be received as it stands, as a sufficient guide to practice.<blockquote>Where the doctrine is beyond the power of human reason to discover, it can be accepted only as resting on the authority of the teacher who proclaimed it; and that authority must be guaranteed by the external evidence of supernatural mission, (ibid., 155)</blockquote>in the forms of prophecy and miracle. To the implications of biblical criticism, which was then beginning to make some impression, not always adverse, on the minds of churchmen, Mansel was apparently indifferent. His theology remained in the grooves of the orthodox tradition.<br>
<br>This appeal to what amounts to theological agnosticism satisfied some, if a little perversely, as a defensive apologetic in face of rationalism, but it scandalized others, not least Maurice. His indignation overflowed. Mansel, it seemed to him, had substituted theological language for the knowledge of God, and nescience for the assurance of faith. He answered the Oxford divine in <span class="italic">What is Revelation?</span> (1859), made up of sermons and supposed &#145;Letters to a student of theology&#146; , but expressed with a confused vehemence that did nothing to elucidate the question at issue, as even his friends realized. Mansel promptly retorted, describing Maurice's book as &#145;a tissue of continuous misrepresentations without a parallel in recent literature&#146;  (Burgon, 193), and further exchanges were made, although to no avail in reconciling their antithetical opinions. That there was some personal animosity behind Maurice's strictures was recognized at the time  (ibid., 193 n.). Little given to critical analysis, he clearly did not appreciate the extent of the epistemological problem which talk about &#145;the knowledge of God&#146; raises. But he was not alone in denouncing Mansel's views. J. S. Mill, from a very different standpoint, found them &#145;loathsome&#146;, while F. J. A. Hort wondered &#145;what a very juiceless and indigestible morsel&#146; Mansel's book &#145;must be to its orthodox admirers&#146;  (A. F. Hort, <span class="italic">The Life and Letters of Fenton John Anthony Hort</span>, 1896, 1.402). Certainly its publication was no small contribution to the religious controversies with which the following decade was fraught. What is likely to interest the modern reader is the way in which the 1858 Bampton lectures anticipated some twentieth-century developments in religious thinking.<h2>
<a name="Otherscholarlyactivities"></a>Other scholarly activities</h2>But Mansel had other occupations as well. In 1857 he edited the four volumes of Hamilton's lectures on metaphysics and logic in collaboration with John Veitch. From 1860 to 1862 he was university select preacher, a duty to be repeated by him from October 1869 until June 1871, and continued his output of sermons and articles, including a paper entitled &#145;Modern German philosophy&#146; in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> (reprinted in his <span class="italic">Letters, Lectures, and Reviews</span>, published posthumously in 1873). In 1865, largely for health reasons, he and his wife took a continental holiday, touring Italy for nearly three months, during which his visit to Rome was of special delight to him. On his return he immediately answered Mill's <span class="italic">An Examination of Sir William Hamilton's Philosophy</span> (1865) in an article in the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> (January&#150;February 1866; republished in his own <span class="italic">The Philosophy of the Conditioned</span>, 1866), in which he accused Mill of ignorance of Kant's doctrines. In any case he could not approve Mill's utilitarianism, considering it &#145;utterly mischievous&#146;.<br>
<br>At the end of 1866 Mansel was appointed to the university professorship of ecclesiastical history, which carried with it a residentiary canonry at Christ Church (he had already, in 1864, been made examining chaplain to the bishop of Peterborough and an honorary canon of Peterborough Cathedral). The ecclesiastical history chair may seem to have been an odd exchange for a noted philosopher, but Mansel had not neglected his theological studies, and in his new capacity he delivered in the Lent term of 1868 a series of lectures, &#145;The Gnostic heresies&#146;, for which his knowledge of ancient philosophy gave him added qualification. Thanks to the editorial work of J. B. Lightfoot, they were published posthumously in 1875.<h2>
<a name="DeanofStPaulsdeathandreputation"></a>Dean of St Paul's, death, and reputation</h2>In 1868 Mansel was offered the deanery of St Paul's Cathedral and he willingly accepted it. His departure from his beloved Oxford was eased for him by his dissatisfaction with the recent course of events in the university, which appeared to him secularizing, as well as a growing weariness from the pressure of university business that intruded more and more upon his proper vocation as a scholar. He hoped, in fact, that purely ecclesiastical office would afford him more leisure for literary activities, among them the completion of his part in the <span class="roman">Speaker's Commentary</span> on the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. But in this he was to be disappointed. The administrative duties, which won his full attention, were, he discovered, engrossing. He managed nevertheless to get away to Cosgrove from time to time, staying with his brother-in-law. But on one of these visits, in the summer of 1871, he died suddenly in his sleep on 30 July from the rupture of a blood-vessel in his brain. He was buried, as he would have wished, in Cosgrove churchyard on 6 August. A window in St Paul's erected to his memory was unveiled on St Paul's day in 1879.<br>
<br>As a thinker Mansel was astute and logical, if somewhat narrow in his intellectual sympathies. As a writer he was lucid and incisive, and in controversy could be acerbic. As a man he was, by all accounts, genial and hospitable. He greatly valued friendship, although it was his friends' actual presence he enjoyed: correspondence by letter he disliked, presumably as too impersonal. His biographer J. W. Burgon speaks of his &#145;profound humility&#146;  (Burgon, 274), and, for all his rather dry theologizing, his personal religion was sincere and heartfelt.<br>
