<span class="headword">Baird,  Charles</span>  (1766&#150;1843), <span class="occ">engineer and manufacturer of steam-driven machinery</span>, was born on 20 December 1766 at Westertown, near Carron, Stirlingshire, one of the ten children of Nicol Baird, superintendent of the Firth and Clyde Canal, and his wife, Christian. In 1782 he was apprenticed to the Carron Company, which was then the foremost ironworks in Scotland, and within three years he had been entrusted with the firm's production of cast-iron guns.<br>
<br>In the 1780s the quantity of the Carron Company's export of guns to Russia resulted in an invitation to the manager, Charles Gascoigne, to develop a gun factory there. Baird accompanied Gascoigne in 1786 and helped establish the Aleksandrovsk gun factory at Petrozavodsk, north-east of St Petersburg, and the Koncherzersky foundry. He remained for three years as Gascoigne's assistant. In 1792 he entered into partnership with a St Petersburg mill owner, Francis Morgan, to establish an ironworks company which came to be known as the Baird Works. Its success was typical of the dominant role played by foreign entrepreneurs in early nineteenth-century Russian ironworks and machine industries. In June 1794 Baird married Sophia Morgan, the daughter of his business partner. They had three sons, of whom only one, Francis Baird (1802&#150;1864), outlived his father.<br>
<br>The Baird Works specialized mainly in the manufacture of steam-driven machinery. It was responsible for the machinery for the imperial arsenal and the imperial glassworks, and by 1825 it was producing 130 steam engines of all kinds. In 1815 the factory built Russia's first steamship, the <i>Elizaveta</i>, which operated on the route from Kronstadt to St Petersburg. Baird's ten-year monopoly on that route enabled his steamships to dominate the waters around St Petersburg. Likewise, his development of a new method for purifying sugar, using non-animal substances, earned him a large share of the city's sugar supply.<br>
<br>The most lasting legacy of the Baird Works were structures in and around St Petersburg, for which the firm supplied the ironwork. One of the first of these was within the works: the Tallow Wharf Bridge (1805&#150;6; demolished 1914), with a 63 foot span, built up from cast-iron segments. Twenty years later there followed a group of notable suspension bridges, designed by Georges Traitteur, including the Post Office Bridge over the Moika and two bridges over the Griboyedov Canal. In connection with these, Baird designed a hydraulic chain-testing machine. The firm was also associated with two of the St Petersburg projects of the French architect, Auguste Ricard de Montferrand: for his Alexander column (1832&#150;4) it cast the reliefs on the base and the colossal angel on top of the column, and for St Isaac's Cathedral (1836&#150;41) it supplied the ironwork of the dome of 130 foot diameter, Baird having contributed to the dome's structural design.<br>
<br>Baird was known for his business abilities as much as his technical expertise, in particular his assiduous cultivation of Russian officialdom. He was assisted by a number of talented engineers, including his nephew, William Handyside (1793&#150;1850), and his son, Francis, who succeeded him as manager of the firm. His workforce included up to a hundred Russian serfs, for whom he paid a small fee to their masters. He received a number of Russian honours, including the order of St Anna (second class) and the order of St Vladimir (third class), and his achievements were recognized in Britain through his election to the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1841. He died on 10/22 December 1843 in St Petersburg and was buried in the Smolensk Lutheran cemetery there.<br>
