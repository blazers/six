<span class="headword">Brereton,  William</span>, third Baron Brereton of Leighlin  (<em>bap. </em>1631, <em>d.</em> 1680), <span class="occ">politician and natural philosopher</span>, was baptized on 4 May 1631 at Brereton, Cheshire, the eldest son of William Brereton, second Baron Brereton (1611&#150;1664), and his wife, Lady Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1687), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11101/', "George Goring, first earl of Norwich")</script>. The barony was a Jacobean Irish creation, referring to Leighlin, co. Carlow, bestowed on Brereton's grandfather in 1624. The family was quietly royalist during the civil war but Brereton and his parents were taken prisoner when the parliamentary forces in Staffordshire captured Biddulph Hall in 1644. Lord Goring sent Brereton in 1646 to the Low Countries to study under the mathematician John Pell, a friend of Lord Brereton, at the Breda Academy, from where he returned in 1652, a competent mathematician and algebraist. On 11 November 1657 he married, apparently against his father's wishes, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1680), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29597/', "Francis Willoughby, fifth Baron Willoughby")</script>. Three sons were born: only the eldest, John (1659&#150;1718), and the youngest, Francis (<i>d</i>. 1722), survived to adulthood.<br>
<br>Brereton was a close friend of Samuel Hartlib and his circle (Hartlib's son Clodius was his physician) and a patron of many literary and scientific undertakings. While abroad he had been in the company of Thomas Hobbes and Sir Charles Cavendish. He frequented the scientific gatherings at Gresham College in 1658 that preceded the formation of the Royal Society, of which he was a founder member and active participant. His interests encompassed the reproduction of language, chemistry, and many aspects of agriculture. He was fascinated by London's new Turkish coffee house, whose exotic drink was for the first time available in Britain. At the Royal Society he sat on the georgics (agriculture) and mechanics committees. After Hartlib's death in penury in 1662 Brereton purchased the two trunks containing his papers and transported them to Cheshire, where John Worthington arranged them into some kind of order.<br>
<br>Elected to represent Newton, Lancashire, in Richard Cromwell's parliament in 1659, and in 1660 the seat of Bossiney, Brereton voted with the Presbyterian opposition. He made no speeches in parliament but was elected to the chair of the public accounts commission (1667&#150;70), and was a gentleman of the privy chamber from 1673 until his death. Financial hardship dogged Brereton for much of his life: he was obliged to alienate the barony of Malpas to compensate for his family's support of the royalist cause, his wife brought little or no portion, and even after inheriting the title in 1664 he was in very straitened circumstances. His father-in-law drowned in Barbados in 1666, and his wife's inheritance was not paid out until 1674.<br>
<br>His acquaintances held Brereton in high regard. John Aubrey, who had known him since his return from Breda, could not &#145;mention this Noble Lord but with a great deale of Passion, for a more virtuous person (besides his great learning) I never knew&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 232). To Hartlib he was &#145;really a noble gentlemen, &amp; of a much enlarged spirit to the good of mankind&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary and Correspondence of Dr John Worthington</span>, 1.188). Samuel Pepys, having met him at Lady Carteret's dining table, judged him to be &#145;a very sober and serious, able man&#146;; after dinner Brereton went to the organ and &#145;played a verse very handsomely&#146;  (Pepys, 8.10&#150;11). He was an excellent musician and a good composer. In 1666 John Worthington sent him a polyphon (a kind of harpsichord) together with a book of lessons.<br>
<br>Brereton died in Westminster on 17 March 1680, and was buried on 19 March at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster. His wife died in September the same year, and was also buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields. The title passed to his son John, who married but died childless, then to Francis, who died unmarried in 1722, whereupon it became extinct.<br>
