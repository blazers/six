<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Aickman,  Robert Fordyce</span>  (1914&#150;1981), <span class="occ">writer and campaigner for inland waterways</span>, was born on 27 June 1914 at 77 Fellows Road, Hampstead, London, the only child of William Arthur Aickman (<i>d</i>. 1941), an architect, and his wife, Mabel Violet (<i>c</i>.1890&#150;1943), daughter of Richard Marsh, born Bernard Heldmann, the prolific Victorian author of popular fiction. Robert Aickman's father was a man of unknown origin and age, though he was perhaps in his mid-fifties when his son was born, and the surname is believed to be Scottish. His mother's family was originally German, deriving from a certain Heldmann who had fled from Bavaria to Nottingham in 1848 and made a fortune from textiles. Richard Marsh met William Arthur Aickman in the gentlemen's lavatory of a grand hotel in Edwardian Eastbourne, and was soon to encourage his marriage to his younger daughter, thirty years William Arthur Aickman's junior. The marriage, and Aickman's childhood, was predictably unhappy, though the family lived in a substantial house, Langton Lodge, at Stanmore, Middlesex. Aickman attended Highgate School and began to be interested in writing there, but he did not then go up to Oxford or Cambridge, as might have been hoped. He entered a period of youthful drifting, writing some theatre reviews for the periodical <span class="italic">The Nineteenth Century and After</span>, but eventually finding himself alone at Langton Lodge after his mother left his father, who then fell terminally ill and ended his life in a nursing home.<br>
<br>Aickman was eventually rescued from the severe depression this isolation caused when he began to attend the queue for tickets at London's Covent Garden Opera, and acquired a series of female friends and lovers. The outbreak of the Second World War brought this lifestyle to an end, but he declared himself a conscientious objector and won total exemption from war service. On 5 September 1941 he married (Edith) Ray Gregorson (1913/14&#150;1983), a secretary whom he had met through the opera queue, but more from sympathy than love. They set up a literary agency together, and moved to 11 Gower Street in Bloomsbury, which was to be Aickman's home for much of his life. They divorced in 1957, and she later became an Anglican nun.<br>
<br>In 1946 Robert and Ray Aickman, with Tom (L. T. C.) Rolt and Rolt's wife, Angela, set up the Inland Waterways Association, to preserve and enhance the canals of Britain, which were at that time in such a state of neglect as seemed likely to end in their ultimate disappearance. Aickman was chairman and Rolt secretary, and the organization quickly gained momentum and influence, becoming in many ways a model for the many campaigning pressure groups of post-war Britain. Aickman remained active and superbly energetic in the waterways campaign until 1964, and although his autocratic style of leadership provoked much dissension, it is nevertheless agreed that the salvation of Britain's canals owes more to him than to any other person.<br>
<br>In 1951 Aickman and Elizabeth Jane Howard published <span class="italic">We are for the Dark</span>, a volume of six ghost stories, where each contributed three, but did not identify who had written which. Aickman was eventually to publish eleven more volumes of what he called &#145;strange stories&#146;, and he succeeded in giving new life to what had been classically an Edwardian genre. Barry Humphries describes his quality:<blockquote>To all his uncanny tales he brings his peculiar erudition; his elegant elliptical style. Some of his most disturbing stories are not without flashes of humour and a sly, morbid eroticism. Above all, he can evoke in a few lines of concentrated prose the tenebrous and oppressive atmosphere of a very bad and inescapable dream. (Humphries, 10)</blockquote>Between 1964 and 1972 Aickman edited the first eight volumes of <span class="italic">The Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories</span>, to all but the sixth of which he contributed learned and stimulating introductions. His other published works included two fantasy novels and two volumes of autobiography, and many stories and plays remained unpublished. He was an inveterate leader and joiner of organizations relating to his interests in transport, theatre, orchestral music, opera, and ballet.<br>
<br>Aickman was a shy man, who blossomed in public life: constitutionally solitary, he derived lifelong solace from relationships with women. He died at the Homeopathic Hospital, Camden, London, on 26 February 1981, of cancer, showing great courage in the face of death, and was cremated at Putney Vale. At odds with the modern world, he left a permanent mark on it through his two disparate but oddly linked fields of endeavour.<br>
