<span class="headword">VanKoughnet <span class="st"> [Vankoughnet]</span>,  Philip Michael Matthew Scott</span>  (1822&#150;1869), <span class="occ">politician and judge in Canada</span>, was born on 21 January 1822 at Cornwall, Stormont county, Ontario, the eldest son of Lieutenant-Colonel Philip VanKoughnet and his wife, Harriet Sophia, the daughter of Matthew Scott of Carrick-on-Suir, co. Tipperary. The family, which was originally named von Gochnat, emigrated from Colmar in Alsace in 1750, and settled in what later became the town of Springfield, Massachusetts. Michael VanKoughnet (1751&#150;1832), grandfather of Philip, was a loyalist and took refuge in 1783 in Cornwall, old province of Quebec, where he died in October 1832, leaving three sons and a daughter from his marriage with Eve, the daughter of John Bolton Empey. The eldest son, Philip VanKoughnet (1790&#150;1873), born on 2 April 1790, served at the battle of Crysler's Farm on 11 November 1813 and commanded the fifth battalion of the Canadian incorporated militia at the battle of the Windmill, Prescott, on 13 November 1837. He was also for thirty years a member of the legislature of Upper Canada, and, on its union with Lower Canada in 1841, the legislative council. At his death he was chairman of the board of arbitrators for the dominion. He died at Cornwall on 17 May 1873, leaving eight sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>The younger Philip VanKoughnet was educated at the Eastern District grammar school before serving under his father in the militia in 1837. The experience led him to give up thoughts of entering the church and he turned instead to law. He began his studies in Cornwall in 1838, then moved to Toronto, and was admitted to the bar in 1843. He specialized in equity law and rapidly established his reputation and a successful practice, enabling him to marry in November 1845 Elizabeth, the daughter of Colonel Barker Turner. He was appointed queen's counsel in 1850, served on the council of the University of Trinity College, and lectured there on equity jurisprudence.<br>
<br>In 1856 VanKoughnet was persuaded by his long-standing friend John A. Macdonald to become president of the executive council and minister of agriculture. In the latter post he was active and efficient, paying particular attention to combating crop damage by pests. Also in 1856 he was elected to the legislative council as member for the Rideau district. In 1858 he became commissioner of crown lands and in 1860 chief superintendent of Indian affairs, in which post he had some success in settling long-running land claims. He initiated the system of selling townships <i>en bloc</i>, which led to a rapid opening up of new areas for colonization. He also encouraged and organized western exploring expeditions and promoted improvements in transport infrastructure, particularly railways.<br>
<br>In 1862 VanKoughnet was appointed chancellor of the court of chancery of Upper Canada. He held this office with distinction until his death, having declined Macdonald's offer in 1868 of the office of chief justice. He died at Toronto on 7 November 1869 after a short illness and was survived by his wife and their two sons. Although he was helped by his close friendship with Macdonald, his achievements were due in large measure to his industry, keen mind, and legal acumen.<br>
