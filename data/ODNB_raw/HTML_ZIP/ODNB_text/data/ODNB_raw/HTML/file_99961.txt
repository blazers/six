<span class="headword">Johnston,  (David) Russell  Russell-</span>, Baron Russell-Johnston  (1932&#150;2008), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born David Russell Johnston on 28 July 1932 at 39 Palmerston Place, Edinburgh, the son of David Knox Johnston, a customs and excise officer, and his wife, (Georgina) Margaret Gerrie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Russell. At the time of his birth his parents lived at Lews, Portree, Isle of Skye. He was brought up on Skye and was educated at Carbost public school and Portree high school. He then went to Edinburgh University, where he refounded the Liberal Club, became its president, and quickly earned a reputation as an excellent debater, winning the coveted <span class="italic">Observer</span> mace in 1961. After national service in the intelligence corps in 1958&#150;9 he trained as a history teacher at Moray House College of Education, and briefly taught at Liberton secondary school near Edinburgh before becoming a paid research assistant for the Scottish Liberals in 1963. A year later he stood successfully for Inverness at the first attempt, a seat he held continuously until his retirement in 1997. On 5 August 1967, at St Andrew's Cathedral, Inverness, he married Joan Graham Menzies, a 23-year-old bank clerk and daughter of Donald Menzies, railway clerk. They had three sons.<br>
<br>Johnston (always known as Russell Johnston) was a passionate advocate of Scottish home rule, long before that cause became fashionable: in 1966 he introduced a private member's bill advocating a devolved Scotland, and he worked closely with John Smith in the late 1970s during the Liberal&#150;Labour pact in an effort to establish a Scottish assembly. Although that project fell by the wayside, he also played a key role with Willie Ross, the secretary of state for Scotland, in setting up the Highlands and Islands Development Board (a body he had called for in a pamphlet published in 1964), which, with the support of European structural funds, contributed greatly to the economic development of the region.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Johnston remained a powerful advocate of Liberalism. Young Liberals were inspired to join the party by his pamphlet <span class="italic">To Be a Liberal</span> (1972). His closing speeches to Scottish Liberal Party conferences enthralled his audience, but his tendency to speak his mind occasionally landed him in trouble. After two visits to Greece in 1968 to inspect the conditions in which political prisoners were held he raised the ire of the Labour left by describing the colonels in the military government as &#145;officers and gentlemen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 29 July 2008). In 1970 he became the chairman of the Scottish Liberal Party, and its leader from 1974 to 1988, sparking a modest revival in the fortunes of the party north of the border. He was a keen supporter of the merger between the Liberals and the Social Democratic Party, and became deputy leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats from 1988 to 1989 and deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats from 1988 to 1992, serving as the Scottish Liberal Democrat president from 1988 to 1994.<br>
<br>Johnston's greatest passion, however, was furthering the cause of European integration. He was an unashamed European federalist, once remarking: &#145;I would much prefer to be ruled by a gentleman named Helmut Schmidt than one named Anthony Wedgwood Benn&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 29 July 2008). He had the honour of being the first British Liberal member of the nominated European Assembly, and, wearing his kilt and sporran, made his maiden speech in French when he took his seat in 1973. He was devastated to lose twice to Winnie Ewing in 1979 and 1984 in the Highlands and Islands constituency, in the direct elections to the European parliament. He sought consolation as a member of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe, to which he increasingly devoted nearly all his attention. Critics at home in Scotland were heard to remark, &#145;Where's Russell? Russell's in Brussels&#146; (although in fact the Council of Europe met in Strasbourg). The neglect of his constituency nearly cost him his Westminster seat, now renamed Inverness, Nairn, and Lochaber, in 1992, when he squeaked home by 458 votes after three recounts, just ahead of the other three main Scottish parties, all four polling over 20 per cent of the vote. Thereafter he spent nearly all his time in Europe, becoming president of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe from 1999 to 2002, a post he regarded as the pinnacle of his career, boasting to a friend that he was &#145;president of an assembly representing 830 million people&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Herald</span>, 12 Aug 2008). During his presidency he spoke out against ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, and championed the cause of human rights and internationalism across Europe.<br>
<br>Having been raised on the Isle of Skye as a bilingual Gaelic and English speaker, Johnston developed an interest in shinty, serving as vice-chief of the Camanachd Association, the sport's governing body. He was also a great lover of whisky, once remarking to his fellow Liberal Democrat MPs during a tour of the highlands, &#145;Isn't it time this meeting finished, so we can all go for a &#147;toot&#148;?&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 30 July 2008). One of his personal traits was to send postcards to all his friends during his frequent trips to Europe and beyond. He was knighted in 1985, and, on becoming a life peer in 1997, he changed his name by deed poll to Russell-Johnston. Perhaps fittingly, he died on the continent, in his favourite hotel in Paris on 27 July 2008, succumbing to the effects of bone marrow cancer. He was cremated in Paris on 4 August 2008, and was survived by his wife and three sons, Graham, David, and Andrew.<br>
