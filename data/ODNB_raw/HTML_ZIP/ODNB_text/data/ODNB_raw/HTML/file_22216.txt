<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pickersgill,  Henry William</span>  (1782&#150;1875), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born on 3 December 1782 in London, and baptized at St Andrew's, Holborn, on 23 June 1808, the son of Thomas Pickersgill and his wife, Mary. The register is annotated &#145;born 3 Dec 1782&#146;. Early in life he was adopted by Henry Hall, a silk manufacturer in Spitalfields. He began an apprenticeship as a silk weaver, abandoning this apparently on account of the decline in the silk trade as a result of the wars with France.<br>
<br>Pickersgill then determined to become a painter, an occupation at which he had already shown some skill. He studied under the landscape and marine painter George Arnald ARA (1763&#150;1841) from 1802 to 1805. After this he became a student at the Royal Academy Schools, which he entered on 28 November 1805, through the good offices of Henry Fuseli. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1806, when he sent in a portrait of Hall. He exhibited a self-portrait in 1808, and a portrait of Mrs Hall in 1809, as well as a view of Minster Point, Isle of Sheppey. As well as some landscape views, he painted historical and mythological subjects at this time. Often his subjects were inspired by contemporary poetry; examples are <span class="italic">The Shepherd Boy</span> (1812) from a poem by Robert Bloomfield and <span class="italic">The Death of Blanche</span> from Walter Scott's <span class="italic">Lady of the Lake</span> (1814). It was at this time that his reputation as a portrait painter began to grow. He was felt by many at the time to offer a refreshingly sober alternative to the stylish work of the leading portraitist of the day, Sir Thomas Lawrence. The landscape painter Constable, with whom he struck up a friendship, commented in a letter of 1828, &#145;Pickersgill is an honourable man, and his art is sound and good&#146;  (<span class="italic">Constable's Correspondence</span>, 283).<br>
<br>It would seem that Pickersgill's wife, Maria Price (1784/5&#150;1857), whom he married at St Andrew's, Holborn, on 8 July 1805, before becoming a student at the academy, was a key figure in negotiating his professional success as a portrait painter. &#145;He has a clever wife, who manages all matters for him&#146;, observed Constable in his journal on 31 May 1824  (ibid., 282). Mrs Pickersgill was a lady of literary talents, and published a volume of verse, <span class="italic">Tales of the Harem</span>, in 1827. This book shows a considerable knowledge of oriental customs and it was presumably this interest that encouraged Pickersgill to paint several studies of young ladies posing in Greek and Near Eastern costume, such as <span class="italic">The Greek Girl</span> (1827; Benaki Museum, Athens) and <span class="italic">The Syrian Maid</span> (exh. 1837; Tate collection). In his journal entry of 31 May 1824 Constable further gave a picture of Pickersgill suffering from overwork: &#145;He is involved in business&#151;but almost dead with work &amp; so nervous that when a knock came to the door he danced like a top &amp; could not hold a limb still&#146;  (ibid.). At that time he was living and working in 18 Soho Square, London.<br>
<br>In 1822 Pickersgill had been finally elected an associate of the Royal Academy, a position he had first sought in 1814. In 1826 he became a Royal Academician. He was a constant and prolific exhibitor at the academy, showing nearly 400 pictures over a period of more than sixty years. During the 1820s Pickersgill's reputation for sober and accurate portraiture was confirmed with the success of his portraits of Hannah More (1822; NPG) and Jeremy Bentham (1829; NPG). Another noted success was his portrait of Wordsworth, which inspired the poet to write a sonnet, now preserved (together with the portrait) at St John's College, Cambridge. From surviving correspondence it would seem that Wordsworth enjoyed the company of the portraitist, who was noted for his lively and sympathetic conversation. As well as the portraits of More, Bentham, and Wordsworth, the National Portrait Gallery contains thirty-two portraits by H. W. Pickersgill including those of William Godwin, M. G. Lewis, and George Stephenson. He painted the celebrated naturalists Richard Owen, Cuvier, and Humboldt for Sir Robert Peel, the botanist Robert Brown for the Linnean Society, and Faraday for the Royal Institution. He also excelled in military portraits, painting General Lord Hill and the duke of Wellington for Lord Hill. There are innumerable portraits by him in Oxford and Cambridge colleges, including one of Sir John Herschel at St John's College, Cambridge. His position as a painter of eminent men and women became almost unchallenged after the death of his rival Thomas Phillips in 1845. As a result of his increased success he moved from his Soho Square dwelling to a larger studio in Stratford Place.<br>
<br>In 1856, on the resignation of Thomas Uwins RA, Pickersgill became librarian of the Royal Academy, a post he held until his death. He last exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1872, and placed himself on the list of retired academicians in 1873. By this time his art had fallen out of favour. This can be seen in the harsh judgement of Richard and Samuel Redgrave in the second edition of their <span class="italic">Century of Painters of the English School</span> (1890). Pickersgill, they declared, was &#145;a portrait painter whose works are distinguished more for their being satisfactory likenesses than for any artistic qualities they possess&#146;  (Redgrave and Redgrave, 326). Pickersgill left central London about 1870 to settle at Fern Lodge, Church Road, Barnes. He died at his London address, 3 Blandford Square, on 21 April 1875 and was buried in Barnes Common cemetery.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_22215"></a><span class="headword">Henry Hall Pickersgill</span>  (1812&#150;1861), <span class="occ">painter</span>, one of the five children and the eldest son of H. W. Pickersgill and his wife, Maria, was born in London and baptized at St Andrew's, Holborn, on 25 June 1812. He gained some reputation as a painter of historical and fancy works. He studied abroad for some years and first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1834 with <span class="italic">The Troubadours</span>. He exhibited <span class="italic">Holy Water</span> in 1837, <span class="italic">Charity</span> in 1838, and similar subjects in subsequent years. He spent two years in St Petersburg and subsequently resumed painting in London, though working largely for a clientele in manufacturing cities, such as Manchester and Wolverhampton. His wife, <a href="#cosubject_98213">Jeannette Caroline Grover [<i>see below</i>]</a>, whom he married on 20 July 1837 at St Anne's, Soho, Westminster, was also a painter. H. H. Pickersgill died in Berkeley Street, Portman Square, on 7 January 1861 and was buried in the family vault at Barnes Common cemetery.<br>
<br>H. H. Pickersgill's widow, <a name="cosubject_98213"></a><span class="headword">Jeannette Caroline Pickersgill <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Grover]</span></span>  (1814?&#150;1885)<span class="occ"></span>, born in Amsterdam, exhibited works at the Royal Academy between 1848 and 1863 and was &#145;well known in literary and scientific circles&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 27 March 1885). She was the first person to be legally cremated in the United Kingdom, following the trial of William Price, in 1884, when Sir James Fitzjames Stephen held that this mode of disposing of a body was not unlawful. She joined the Cremation Society in January 1885, and died of broncho-pneumonia shortly afterwards, on 20 March 1885, at her home, 5 Cornwall Residences, Clarence Gate, Regent's Park, London. Her will contained instructions for cremation and, after an autopsy, this was carried out on 26 March 1885 at the crematorium established by the Cremation Society at St John's, Woking, Surrey. Her ashes were deposited at Kensal Green cemetery in 1887.<br>
<br>There were a number of other members of the Pickersgill family who were artists in the nineteenth century, notably Henry William's nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22214/', "Frederick Richard Pickersgill (1820&#150;1900)")</script> and his daughter M. A. Pickersgill (<i>fl</i>. 1832&#150;1838).<br>
