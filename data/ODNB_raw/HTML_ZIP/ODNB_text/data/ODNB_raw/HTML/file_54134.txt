<span class="headword">Biggar,  Walter</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1376/7), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, is of unknown origins, and his early career is very obscure. When David II was released from English captivity in October 1357, he immediately appointed Biggar clerk of the wardrobe. Biggar's introduction to David's court may have been through an association with the family of one of the king's most loyal and trusted retainers, Malcolm Fleming, earl of Wigtown&#151;in June 1358 Biggar appears in papal records as rector of Biggar, a benefice in the gift of the Fleming lords of Biggar (although this is the only example of his using this designation). A predecessor as rector of Biggar, Henry, had been described in the 1320s and 1330s as Fleming's clerk and had served as clerk of liverance, the officer responsible for the purchase of provisions for the royal household, in the court of David II's father, Robert I.<br>
<br>Biggar was clerk of the wardrobe until autumn 1358, when he became deputy chamberlain to Thomas, earl of Mar. In April 1359 Biggar replaced Earl Thomas as chamberlain, and at about the same time was made rector of Errol, a benefice in the gift of the monastery of Coupar Angus. His term as chamberlain, the chief financial officer of the Scottish crown in the fourteenth century, was dominated by the need to produce ransom payments of 10,000 merks per annum to the English crown under the terms of the treaty of Berwick of October 1357. The treaty had secured David II's release from an imprisonment in England which began with the king's defeat and capture at the battle of Nevilles Cross in October 1346. Biggar exercised the chamberlainship without interruption until April 1363, when he was removed from the post in favour of Sir Robert Erskine. Biggar's demission of office may have been connected to the baronial rebellion against David II which broke out in March 1363. One of the complaints of the rebels concentrated on the misuse of money levied for the king's ransom, and Biggar, as David's chief financial officer, may have been the target of particular resentment. Alternatively, the king may have felt that at a time of political confrontation royal financial resources were best supervised by one of his close political allies, Erskine, rather than a career civil servant. Certainly there was no noticeable opposition to Biggar's reappointment to the office on 14 December 1364; he continued to serve as David II's chamberlain until the king's death in February 1371, his tenure being marked, then as earlier, by the regularity of exchequer audits and the general efficiency of the crown's financial administration. Biggar was retained as chamberlain by the new king, Robert II, until his own death on a date between 14 March 1376 and 28 January 1377.<br>
