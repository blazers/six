<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Herbison,  Margaret McCrorie <span class="st"> [Peggy]</span></span>  (1907&#150;1996), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 11 March 1907 at 46 Shotts Kirk Road, Shotts, Lanarkshire, the fourth of the six children of John Herbison, coalminer, and his wife, Maria Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McCrorie. Her mother was &#145;from Northern Ireland&#151;in fact from [Ian] Paisley's Bannside. My father, a gentle and tolerant man, was shocked when after visiting cousins there I brought home some Orange songs. But I'd also learnt some Irish rebel songs&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). Thought by Harold Wilson to be indecisive, Herbison, in a creditably caring way, recognized that there were at least two sides to every question.<br>
<br>Herbison enjoyed a happy childhood. After attending Dykehead public primary school the strict traditional dominies of her secondary school, Bellshill Academy, saw to it that this intelligent, assiduous miner's daughter entered Glasgow University. The university inculcated in her generation the expectation that they should repay the country for privileged education by service to society, and it was for service to society that in 1970 the university bestowed on her an honorary doctorate of laws. She gained her first degree in English, and in 1930 became a schoolteacher. From then until 1945 she taught English and history, first at Maryhill primary school in Glasgow and then at Allan Glen's secondary school. Her pupils recalled her with that mixture of affection and awe which is the mark of the really successful professional teacher. &#145;A right proper bantamweight&#146; was the verdict of a pupil who himself later became an international boxer  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>).<br>
<br>As an undergraduate at Glasgow, Herbison chaired the university's Labour branch, and she remained active in local Labour politics; she also lectured in economics for the National Council of Labour Colleges. After her father had been killed in the pit his miners' lodge, unprompted, nominated her as a candidate for the Labour selection conference in the North Lanarkshire constituency. She won the nomination, and in the general election of July 1945 took the seat from the incumbent Conservative, Sir William Anstruther Grey. She made her maiden speech on 17 October 1945, in which she said:<blockquote>In my constituency of North Lanark, where I am faced with a gigantic housing problem, we have suffered little or nothing from war damage &hellip; My people for a long time have been suffering deplorable conditions. That cannot be put on this Labour government; it is the result of governments not tackling this problem as it ought to have been tackled a long time ago &hellip; In many parts of my constituency there are people living in houses in which the Minister of Health or the Minister of Agriculture would not allow cattle to live. They would say, &#145;You must not house your cattle in them; if you do, we won't be willing to accept the milk for the children.&#146; Yet, our children and their parents have to live in them. (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>)</blockquote>The fight for better conditions encapsulated the essence of Herbison's political career.<br>
<br>Herbison soon caught the eye of the government whips. In 1947 she was chosen to second the Commons address in reply to the king's speech, an honour which had fallen to a woman only once before. Two years later she was chosen to be the only woman member of the first British delegation to the consultative assembly of the Council of Europe. When the Attlee government was returned again, with a small majority, in February 1950 she became joint parliamentary under-secretary of state for Scotland, under Hector McNeil. In eighteen months she made her mark&#151;espousing in particular the crusade to build new primary schools to replace many early Victorian ones. Following Labour's defeat in the October 1951 general election she flourished effectively on the opposition front bench, shadowing successively Scottish and pension affairs. Elected a member of the national executive committee of the Labour Party in 1948, she was a prominent Gaitskellite loyalist. She presided with skill over the 1957 Labour Party conference.<br>
<br>In October 1964, when the Labour Party was returned to power, Harold Wilson appointed Herbison minister of pensions and national insurance (from August 1966 minister of social security). She wished to raise pensions at once, as the Labour Party in opposition had repeatedly and explicitly promised. She was furious when told by civil servants that for administrative reasons the increase could not be made payable in less than six months. However, she was able to abolish the national assistance scheme, so loathed by socialists, and replace it with the new device of supplementary benefits. In July 1967 she resigned office in protest at the government's refusal to increase children's allowances. Characteristically she refused to comment further, saying that she had no intention of &#145;giving the Tory press a story which would do harm to the Labour Party&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>). Wilson, praising her warm humanity, expressed regret that she felt unable to accept decisions which commended themselves to her colleagues. She became chairman of the select committee on overseas aid in 1969 but retired from parliament at the general election of 1970. In the same year she was voted Scotswoman of the year.<br>
<br>A devout member of the Church of Scotland throughout her life, Herbison was thrilled to serve as the queen's representative, the lord high commissioner to the general assembly of the Church of Scotland, in 1970&#150;71, the first woman ever to be thus appointed. It was deemed highly appropriate when in 1974 she was appointed to the royal commission on standards of conduct in public life. She also served from 1976 as the first lay observer appointed to investigate allegations against the handling of complaints by the Law Society of Scotland. She died at St Mary's Hospital, Lanark, of cancer, on 29 December 1996. She was unmarried.<br>
