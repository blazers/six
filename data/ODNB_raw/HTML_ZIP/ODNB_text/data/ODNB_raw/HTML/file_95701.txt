<span class="headword">Graves,  Philip Perceval</span>  (1876&#150;1953), <span class="occ">journalist and author</span>, was born at Sandiford House, Stamford Road, Bowdon, Cheshire, on 25 February 1876, the eldest son in the family of three sons and two daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33521/', "Alfred Perceval Graves (1846&#150;1931)")</script> of Dublin, inspector of schools and poet, and his first wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1886), eldest daughter of James Cooper of Cooper's Hill, near Limerick. Graves's family had been established in Ireland since the seventeenth century and was prominent in literature, education, and the church; his grandfather Charles Graves was bishop of Limerick. His great-uncle was Leopold von Ranke, the German historian. Five years after the death of Philip's mother, by which time he was fifteen, his father took as his second wife von Ranke's great-niece, Amy Ranke (1857&#150;1951); among the children of the second marriage was the poet and novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31166/', "Robert von Ranke Graves")</script>. As a young man the red-haired Philip was sensitive, hot-tempered, and &#145;had his share of the notorious Graves arrogance&#146;  (Graves, <span class="italic">Robert Graves</span>, 22), and his relationship with his stepmother was difficult. In the words of a younger brother, he was also &#145;an exceptionally brilliant boy with an almost photographic memory&#146;  (ibid., 21), and won scholarships to Haileybury College in 1889 and to Oriel College, Oxford, in 1895. At Haileybury he was head of school in 1894&#150;5, although at Oriel, where he read classics, he fared less well, in his finals in 1899 gaining only a third.<br>
<br>Graves had hoped to enter the Indian Civil Service but failed the medical on grounds of incipient tuberculosis. Partly for health reasons and partly because of family connections with the Levant, he was sent to Cairo, where he became correspondent of the <span class="italic">Egyptian Gazette</span> and shared a flat with Ronald Storrs. Already &#145;a master of his absorbing and entertaining craft&#146;  (Storrs, 49), in 1906 he was invited to join <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Two years later he was appointed its correspondent in Constantinople, where until recently one of his younger brothers, Richard Massie Graves (1880&#150;1960), had been acting third dragoman at the British embassy. Graves arrived in time to observe the Young Turks' revolution of July 1908 against the Hamidian regime, and remained until the outbreak of war with Germany in 1914. During these hazardous times, which took in the Balkan wars, he formed a close professional relationship with the British embassy's chief dragoman, Gerald Fitzmaurice, and came to share his view that the Young Turks' Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) had simply replaced one &#145;camarilla&#146; with another. In February 1913 he told Aubrey Herbert that the committee had been trying to get rid of him and Fitzmaurice  (diaries of Aubrey Herbert, 24 Feb 1913, Som. ARS DD/HER/70/2). This was not paranoia: &#145;I trust they will not arrest Graves who irritates them to madness by making the most of their follies and never patting them on the back when they do well&#146;, the ambassador, Sir Louis Mallet, wrote to the Foreign Office  (Mallet to Nicolson, 17 Feb 1914, TNA: PRO, FO 800/372). Mallet, for whom Graves had contempt, adopted the opposite policy. On 17 July 1912 Graves had married the popular (Leila) Millicent (1885&#150;1935), daughter of Gavin Gilchrist of Moda, Constantinople, with whom he had a daughter.<br>
<br>During the First World War Graves was a captain in military intelligence in the Middle East. After he arrived in Cairo in January 1915, with the reputation of being the leading British expert on the Turkish army, his writing skills were put to use on the constant updating of <span class="italic">The Turkish Army Handbook</span>, on which he was assisted by T. E. Lawrence. In the following year he joined the Arab Bureau, and at the end of 1917 was a member of Gilbert Clayton's &#145;political camp&#146; at General Allenby's advanced general headquarters at Bir Salem in Palestine. Graves, who spoke Turkish well, assisted his uncle, the senior Levant service officer Robert Windham Graves (1858&#150;1934), in interrogating Turkish prisoners and examining captured documents.<br>
<br>After the armistice with Turkey in October 1918 Graves resumed his position as correspondent of <span class="italic">The Times</span> in Constantinople, and it was here that he broke the story for which he is most remembered. This concerned the so-called &#145;Protocols of the elders of Zion&#146;, a document that had first surfaced in 1905 and purported to reveal that all important events were manipulated by a secret society of Jews in the interests of establishing a Jewish world state. At the instigation of the antisemitic editor of the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, H. A. Gwynne, the &#145;Protocols&#146; were presented as authentic in a series of articles in his newspaper in July 1920 and then in book form as <span class="italic">The Cause of World Unrest</span> (1920). Gwynne had been informed in February by the political intelligence department of the Foreign Office that the &#145;Protocols&#146; were almost certainly spurious and his own business manager dismissed them as &#145;moonshine&#146;. Nevertheless, it was Graves, on the basis of evidence supplied to him by a Russian in Constantinople (Mikhail Raslovlev), who most convincingly debunked them. In three articles in <span class="italic">The Times</span> (16, 17, 18 Aug 1921) he showed that they consisted for the most part of passages clumsily cut and pasted by the Russian secret police from a political pamphlet directed against Napoleon III and published in Brussels in 1865. Lest his own motives be suspect Graves stated in the preface to his book <span class="italic">Palestine, the Land of Three Faiths</span> (1923) that he did not believe in political Zionism.<br>
<br>Despite this triumph won in Constantinople and his admiration for the courage and military genius of the emerging Turkish leader, Mustafa Kemal, Graves was soon uncomfortable in Turkey. He saw the national assembly at Ankara, which was the focal point of resistance to both foreign occupation and the old regime in Constantinople, as the chrysalis of a &#145;new CUP&#146;, and when in November 1922 it elected a new caliph he concluded that it had made this move the better to prosecute its pan-Islamic schemes through a puppet. His discomfort increased when a man with whom his relations were bad was appointed to high office, and it was in these circumstances that he left.<br>
<br>After Constantinople, Graves was employed by <span class="italic">The Times</span> as a special correspondent, chiefly in Ireland and India but also in the Levant and the Balkans. Eventually he came to rest in the imperial and foreign department in London where, among other things, he wrote special articles and leaders. He also gave his time increasingly to writing books. Almost all on the Middle East except for <span class="italic">A Record of the War</span>, the vast twenty-four-volume work published quarterly by Hutchinson he took over from Storrs in the third quarter of 1940 and wrote almost entirely himself, these were terse and packed with facts but also contained strong expressions of opinion. In his <span class="italic">Life of Sir Percy Cox</span> (1941) Graves rejected outright the charge that Cox shared some of the blame for the fall of Kut during the Mesopotamian campaign and claimed that he was &#145;the greatest of British proconsuls of our time&#146;  (p. 341).<br>
<br>Graves's first wife had died in 1935 and on 16 July 1937 he married, at St Ethelburga's in Bishopsgate, Katherine Eleanor Dewar, daughter of W. H. E. H. Palmer; Storrs was best man. At the end of 1945 he retired from <span class="italic">The Times</span> and moved to co. Cork. However, he did not stop writing, and in 1950 published his edition of the memoirs of King Abdullah of Transjordan. His time was otherwise much occupied by his interests in entomology, fly-fishing, and early British history. He died at his home, Ballylickey House, Bantry, co. Cork, Ireland, on 3 June 1953. His second wife and his daughter from his first marriage, Elizabeth Millicent (Sally) Chilver (1914&#150;2014), who became principal of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, survived him.<br>
<br>Graves's literary output sometimes bore the marks of the haste in which it had to be composed. A great patriot and believer in the civilizing mission of the British empire, he was occasionally too indulgent of the official point of view. Nevertheless, fired by a broad and raging curiosity and marked by the individualism characteristic of his family, he was a first-class journalist. His lasting importance is that he deflated one of the most pernicious myths about the Jews.<br>
