<span class="headword">Burrell, Sir  William</span>  (1861&#150;1958), <span class="occ">art collector</span>, was born at 3 Scotis Street, Glasgow, on 9 July 1861, the third son of William Burrell (1832&#150;1885), a shipowner, and his wife, Isabella Duncan Guthrie (<i>d</i>. 1912), and grandson of George Burrell, the founder of the shipping firm later known as Burrell &amp; Son, which Burrell joined when he was fifteen. He was educated at a boarding-school at St Andrews. In 1877 one of the firm's ships salvaged Cleopatra's Needle, which had been lost in the Bay of Biscay on its passage to England. For many years Burrell managed the family business in conjunction with his eldest brother, and the firm greatly prospered under his vigorous direction; it reached its peak activity in 1915, when it owned thirty ships all of over 4000 gross tonnage. Burrell, however, determined to devote the remainder of his long life to art, and by 1917 almost the entire fleet had been sold.<br>
<br>Burrell's interest in art had shown itself, he used to recall, as a boy when, to his father's annoyance, he had used his pocket money to buy not a cricket bat but a picture. Realizing that it was not very good he later sold it to buy a better one. By 1901 he already owned a considerable collection, not only of pictures (including works by G&eacute;ricault, Daumier, and Manet), but of tapestries, stained glass, Iranian carpets, furniture, metalwork, and carvings in wood and ivory. In that year he lent over 160 works of art to the International Exhibition in Glasgow, for which he was an active committee member. Also in 1901 Burrell married Constance Mary Lockhart (<i>d</i>. 1961), daughter of James Lockhart Mitchell, merchant; they had one daughter.<br>
<br>At this time Burrell's interests were by no means confined to shipping and art. He served in the corporation of Glasgow as a representative of the tenth ward (1899&#150;1906) and became convener of a sub-committee on uninhabitable houses, back lands, and underground dwellings&#151;retiring, it is said, because the policy of slum clearance he advocated was not followed. Until 1906 he also acted as consul at Glasgow for Austria&#150;Hungary.<br>
<br>In 1916 Burrell acquired Hutton Castle near Berwick upon Tweed, previously the home of Lord Tweedmouth, who had largely rebuilt and added to the ancient castle. Burrell made further additions to the structure and entirely remodelled the interior. He and his wife lived there from about 1926, by which time the castle was sumptuously furnished throughout with works of art, many of which were built into the fabric of the rooms. As the collection continued to grow, it soon outstripped the accommodation available in the castle and for many years much of it was widely dispersed on loan to many different art galleries, museums, and cathedrals, including the national galleries of Scotland, England, and Wales. In 1925 Burrell presented over sixty paintings and drawings to the Glasgow Art Gallery, and for several years a large number of his pictures were on loan to the Tate Gallery. Donations were also made to other galleries.<br>
<br>In 1944 Burrell presented to the city of Glasgow a great art collection to which he added lavishly every year until the end of his life. This diverse collection contained works of art of ancient civilizations, including Sumer, Egypt, Greece, and Rome; oriental art of the Far and Near East including Chinese pottery, bronzes, and jades, and Iranian carpets, pottery, and metalwork; European art of the medieval and post-medieval periods including tapestries, stained glass, furniture, stone, wood, and ivory carvings, embroideries and lace, pottery, arms and armour, glassware, treen, silver and metalware; and between 700 and 800 paintings, drawings, and engravings, chiefly by European artists of the fifteenth to the nineteenth centuries. The collection also included the largest single assemblage of works (132) by Joseph Crawhall (1861&#150;1913), a large number of drawings by Phil May, and a quantity of Japanese prints.<br>
<br>Burrell's most abiding interest probably centred in the art of the later Middle Ages and Renaissance. The collection of Franco-Flemish, German, Swiss, and English tapestries of the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries has been considered the finest of its kind; that of English, French, German, Dutch, and Swiss stained and painted glass of the twelfth to seventeenth centuries is even more extensive and hardly less remarkable. Largest of all is the collection of Chinese pottery and porcelain which comprises a magnificent range of wares dating from the earliest known neolithic vessels to the brilliantly enamelled vessels and figures of the reign of Kangxi (1662&#150;1722). The furniture, silver, and needlework is chiefly English of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.<br>
<br>Beginning in 1911 the twenty-eight notebooks in which Burrell recorded his acquisitions and payments continue in unbroken sequence until a few months prior to his death. They show that for almost half a century he was spending on average at least &pound;20,000 a year on acquiring works of art. After 6 April 1944, when the collection as it then stood became the property of Glasgow, he continued to acquire on an equally grand or even grander scale. The year 1948, when he spent over &pound;60,000, probably represents his highest expenditure in any one year, except for 1936 when he spent almost &pound;80,000.<br>
<br>To his great gift to Glasgow Burrell added &pound;450,000. This was to build a new museum for housing the collection in an area of the Scottish countryside not less than 16 miles from the centre of the city and within 4 miles of Killearn. This condition proved difficult to honour, and apart from the selections on permanent or changing display in the municipal art gallery and museum at Kelvingrove, the collection remained in store. The tapestries and other textiles could not at first be exhibited in Glasgow being susceptible to damage from polluted air. But in 1966 Pollok House and Estate on the southern outskirts of the city were presented to Glasgow, and a museum was built to house Burrell's collection on the estate. The project finally came to fruition with the opening of the award-winning building, designed by Barry Gasson, John Meunier, and Brit Andreson, in 1983.<br>
<br>Burrell was reserved by temperament, and in the midst of the beautiful objects which filled his home he led a comparatively frugal existence. Starting as a private collector, he became during thirty or more years a collector for posterity rather than for himself. Yet in spite of its size he always preserved a keen intellectual and artistic interest in his collection, about which he had read widely and for whose details his memory was excellent. By nature he was clearly attracted by vigour of form and colour rather than by elegance, so the collection is rich in works of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries but deficient in those of the eighteenth. Numbering about 8000 objects, the collection was probably one of the largest ever assembled by one man, and certainly the largest given to a municipality.<br>
<br>For many years Burrell was a trustee of the Tate Gallery and from 1923 to 1946 of the National Gallery of Scotland. He was knighted in 1927 for his services to art; he received the freedom of the city of Glasgow in 1944, and the St Mungo prize in 1946. He died at Hutton Castle on 29 March 1958, and was buried in early April at Largs cemetery, Ayrshire.<br>
