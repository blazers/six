<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilshaw, Sir  Edward</span>  (1879&#150;1968), <span class="occ">company manager and financier</span>, was born on 3 June 1879 at Limehouse, London, the elder son of William George Wilshaw, a clerk with Fletcher's Dry Dock, and later its chairman and managing director, and his wife, Amelia Sewell.<br>
<br>Wilshaw left school at the age of fourteen. In February 1894 he joined the Eastern Telegraph Company Ltd as a clerk. In 1912 he married Minnie (Myn), the daughter of produce broker William Moar, of Orkney; they had two daughters. Although his marriage certificate described him as a &#145;director of public companies&#146;, he did not reach board level at Eastern until later. In January 1920 he became joint assistant secretary of the Eastern and South African telegraph cable companies. He became secretary of Eastern in September 1922.<br>
<br>During his years with Eastern, Wilshaw was closely associated with the Pender family, descended from Sir John Pender, who founded British intercontinental submarine telegraph cables on profits from Manchester-based cotton enterprises. From the 1920s, when wireless became a powerful competitor, Wilshaw and the Penders tried to maintain the near-monopoly previously enjoyed by Eastern, in the face of growing political independence in many countries, as well as technological developments which were beyond Eastern's apparent competence, and the significance of which Eastern's management was powerless to recognize.<br>
<br>Following an Imperial Conference, in 1929 Eastern cable and Marconi wireless telegraph interests were merged, in order to avoid the financial collapse of the telegraph cable companies. The strength of Eastern was demonstrated by its dominance of the merger company in both shareholder control and management allocation. Cutting through several interrelated shareholdings, the new company was first called Imperial and International Communications Ltd, but was renamed Cable and Wireless Ltd, in 1934. Wilshaw, who became general manager and secretary in 1929, was appointed chief general manager in 1933, a director and joint managing director in 1935, and chairman and sole managing director in 1936&#151;a truly spectacular progression.<br>
<br>The new merger company, in common with many others, had a difficult time in the depression years of the 1930s. In 1938, after an Imperial Conference, Wilshaw inaugurated the Empire flat rate scheme&#151;the first application of a flat rate principle to overseas telegrams. But the continued emphasis of Cable and Wireless on the telegraph and cable field was taking its toll, and more economic problems were threatening when the Second World War broke out. During the war, Wilshaw and the telegraph cable operations made an outstanding contribution, both to the conduct of the war and, through the use of special rate facilities, to the morale of troops overseas.<br>
<br>Before the end of the war, a Commonwealth conference made recommendations aimed at recognizing and accommodating political and technical developments. As had happened previously, Wilshaw bitterly resented the proposed changes, which would not only encourage expansion of wireless communication but would also break up Cable and Wireless into several separate, locally-owned, operating corporations in the main Commonwealth countries, and leave it with only residual business elsewhere. After a two-year battle with the British government, Wilshaw lost on the acquisition issue, but won good compensation terms for his shareholders.<br>
<br>This was the parting of the ways. Cable and Wireless became a state-owned public company and Wilshaw founded, with the compensation moneys, an investment trust, which developed into the Electra House Group. He was the first governor of the investment trust from 1947 until 1964, when he relinquished the position and became president.<br>
<br>Although he lived at Frinton, in Essex, Wilshaw was &#145;a great and enthusiastic Londoner&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 March 1968), whose interests were reflected in the various offices and honorary appointments he held. He was a member of the court of assistants (and later prime warden) of the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights, liveryman of the Company of Coopers, master of the Guild of Freemen of the City of London (1920), governor of the City of London College, and member of the City of London Territorial Association. In 1912 he became a member of the Chartered Institute of Secretaries, in which he took a great interest, becoming vice-president and, in 1930&#150;31, president. He commemorated his presidential year of office by giving the institute a stained-glass window for its hall in London Wall (the hall was destroyed in the Second World War). He was also a lieutenant of the City of London, and was very disappointed not to be invited to become lord mayor. London University honoured him with an LLD. In 1939 he was appointed KCMG.<br>
<br>Wilshaw's love of London did not isolate him from Essex where, in 1932, he was elevated to the county bench and his name was added to the Commission of Peace for the county. He also served as a general commissioner of income tax and land tax for the Havering division of Essex.<br>
<br>Later in his life Wilshaw lived almost &#145;on the job&#146;, in a flat in Arundel House, Arundel Street, near the Kingsway premises of Electra House. He was in appearance a stocky man. He would pass the time of day with all and sundry; yet he was by nature an autocrat, and it could be said, in retrospect, that his limited technical appreciation and business outlook caused his company some problems. Wilshaw died on 3 March 1968 at 10 Bryanston Square, Marylebone, London. He was cremated.<br>
