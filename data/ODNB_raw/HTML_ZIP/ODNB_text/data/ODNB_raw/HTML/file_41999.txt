<span class="headword">Hussey,  (John) Walter Atherton</span>  (1909&#150;1985), <span class="occ">dean of Chichester and patron of the arts</span>, was born at St Matthew's Parade, Northampton, on 15 May 1909, son of Canon John Rowden Hussey (1864&#150;1949), vicar of St Matthew's, Northampton, and his wife, Lilian Mary Atherton (<i>d</i>. 1946). The second of two surviving sons, he attended the Knoll, a preparatory school at Woburn Sands, and Marlborough College, before reading philosophy, politics, and economics at Keble College, Oxford (1927&#150;1930). For a short period he served as a schoolmaster at Charleston, Sussex, then went to study theology at Cuddesdon (1931&#150;2). He was ordained to a curacy at St Mary Abbots, Kensington (1932), and was in charge of the daughter church of St Paul (1935&#150;6). In 1937 he succeeded his father as vicar of St Matthew's parish church, Northampton, remaining there until nominated dean of Chichester in 1955.<br>
<br>Hussey's role as an ecclesiastical patron of the arts began in earnest when, in 1943, he commissioned Benjamin Britten to write the cantata <span class="italic">Rejoice in the Lamb</span> to mark the fiftieth anniversary of St Matthew's Church. The words of the cantata, from an eighteenth-century poem by Christopher Smart, came to epitomize Hussey's own attitude to the relationship between religion and the arts, and between sanctity and aesthetics:<blockquote>
<div>Hallelujah from the heart of God,<br>
</div>
<div>and from the hand of the artist inimitable,<br>
</div>
<div>and from the echo of the heavenly harp<br>
</div>
<div>in sweetness magnifical and mighty.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>At a time when church decoration was languishing in mass-produced Victorianism, and when art itself was often considered unjustifiable luxury work, Hussey sought to re-establish the church's connection with modern artists, musicians, and writers of high calibre. Henry Moore's sculpture <span class="italic">Madonna and Child</span> (1943), with its neo-romantic emphasis on the nurturing body, and Graham Sutherland's painting <span class="italic">The Crucifixion</span> (1946), which consciously alluded to the atrocities of the Nazi death camps, were installed in opposite transepts of the parish church. These images echoed Hussey's own sacramental, catholic theology, and attested to his astuteness as a patron. At the time of their unveiling, both works were heavily criticized in the press: the <span class="italic">Madonna</span> for being &#145;grotesque&#146; and &#145;an insult to every woman&#146;, and the <span class="italic">Crucifixion</span> for its modernist style and uncompromising portrayal of suffering and degradation  (Hussey, <span class="italic">Patron of Art</span>, 45, 67&#150;73). However, Hussey had the support of his congregation, and of Kenneth Clark, director of the National Gallery. Moreover, the unity of these art works with their liturgical and architectural context has been attested by more recent critics. They certainly document the catholic preoccupation with synthesis and balance: between the Christian doctrines of incarnation and redemption, between neo-romanticism and artistic modernism, between peaceful detachment and impassioned protest, and between the consciousness of beatitude and the conviction of the sin which perpetrates the most horrifying atrocities.<br>
<br>These commissions, combined with a broadcast from the church by the BBC Symphony Orchestra in 1943, two performances by the soprano Kirsten Flagstad in 1947 and 1948, a litany and anthem written by the poet W. H. Auden for the patronal festival in 1946, and the publication in pamphlet form of Norman Nicholson's poem &#145;The Outer Planet&#146; in 1949, served to place St Matthew's Church at the centre of a small renaissance of religious art. It was not a coincidence that this occurred amid 1940s austerity; Hussey's sacramental aesthetic, like that of Bishop Bell of Chichester, was nourished by a conviction that the vision of the artist, in conjunction with that of the church, was a weapon in the spiritual arsenal of &#145;Christian civilization&#146;, essential for combating the cultural influence of totalitarianism.<br>
<br>Hussey's reputation for inspired art patronage, combined with highly aesthetic catholic liturgical celebration, was firmly established by the 1950s, and his appointment as dean of Chichester in 1955 transformed the cathedral into a thriving centre of ecclesiastical and artistic co-operation. By his retirement in 1977 Hussey's vision of a renewed tradition of religious art was amply attested by the decoration of the church itself, which contained significant works of modern art alongside medieval sculptures and architectural features, painstakingly restored. Ceri Richards designed a set of copes in 1960, Graham Sutherland contributed a painting, <span class="italic">Noli me tangere</span> (1961), John Piper designed an imposing tapestry for the altar reredos (1966), and 1978 saw the unveiling of a window illustrating <span class="roman">Psalm 150</span>, designed by Marc Chagall. As Alan Doig has commented, the artistic objects commissioned by Hussey for the cathedral possess a &#145;calm completeness&#146; which enhances the sense of continuity between the medieval and the modern  (Doig, 18). At Hussey's instigation, a Victorian wooden choir screen was replaced by the restored fifteenth-century stone screen, two twelfth-century Romanesque carvings of <span class="roman">New Testament</span> scenes were newly displayed, and, among other musical commissions, Leonard Bernstein wrote settings for the <span class="italic">Chichester Psalms</span> in 1965, and William Albright a <span class="italic">Chichester Mass</span> in 1975.<br>
<br>In the year of his retirement, Hussey wrote movingly of the relationship between the church and the arts:<blockquote>[The artist] can purge our imagination. He may, by forcing us to share his vision, lead us to the spiritual reality that lies behind the sounds and sights that we perceive with our senses. If all this be so, the true artist is one of the most valuable and honourable members of society and his work one of the highest activities of man &hellip; Art of high standard can and should be offered to God and in the offering symbolise all that should be offered by mankind. (Hussey, &#145;The arts and the church&#146;, 1)</blockquote>That uncomplicated theological perception was the driving force behind Hussey's determination to invite modern artists to rejoin the life of the church, and the enthusiasm with which he approached that task is evident in his one book, <span class="italic">Patron of Art</span> (1985). Following a stroke, Hussey died on 25 July 1985 at St Stephen's Hospital, Chelsea, London. After his death his enormous private collection (which had become very valuable) was inherited by Pallant House in Chichester, and by the Northampton City Museum and Art Gallery. His estate was valued for probate at &pound;1,370,620.<br>
