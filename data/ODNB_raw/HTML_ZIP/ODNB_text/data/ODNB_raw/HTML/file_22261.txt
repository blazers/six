<span class="headword">Pike,  Richard</span>  (1834&#150;1893), <span class="occ">master mariner</span>, born at Carboni&egrave;re in Conception Bay, Newfoundland, was brought up in the northern fisheries, in whaling and sealing. In 1869 he obtained command of a steamer engaged in that trade and by 1875 he was captain of the <i>Proteus</i>, a stout-built vessel of 467 tons and 110 horsepower. In June 1881 his ship was chartered by the United States government to carry Lieutenant Adolphus W. Greely and his party of twenty-five men through Smith Sound to the most remote of the Arctic stations set up for the International Polar Year. This was at Fort Conger on the north coast of Lady Franklin Bay, north Ellesmere Island. The mission was safely effected; and, in 1883, the <i>Proteus</i>, still commanded by Pike, was again chartered to carry relief to the expedition, the United States ship <i>Yantic</i> being ordered to accompany her as a depot, as far as was prudent, but not to venture into the ice, for which she was not fitted. The inexperienced Lieutenant Ernest A. Garlington gave instructions to steam north, and on 23 July, off Cape Sabine, the <i>Proteus</i> was nipped in the pack and sank almost immediately; no lives were lost, but there was scant time to save some provisions and clothes. Sometimes in the boats, sometimes painfully dragging them over the rough ice floes, Pike and his companions succeeded, after extreme hardship, in reaching Upernavik, where they were taken up by the <i>Yantic</i>, which, unknowingly, had passed them in fog shortly after the shipwreck. For that year there was no relief to Greely's party, among whom starvation, illness, and ill discipline took their toll; but the seven survivors were rescued in the following year.<br>
<br>In 1891 Pike, in the steamer <i>Kite</i>, was engaged to carry Robert E. Peary and his party, which he put on shore in McCormick Bay in Murchison Sound (lat. 77&deg;43' N), and returned without misadventure. In the next year he brought the party back, and was to have taken Peary out again in the summer of 1893; but the arrangement was cancelled by Pike's death, at St John's, on 4 May. &#145;A typical Newfoundlander,&#146; wrote his shipmates in the <i>Kite</i>, &#145;as active in mind and body as many men of half his years&#146;. &#145;A quiet, unassuming man,&#146; wrote a correspondent of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, &#145;thoroughly capable and reliable, unequalled as an Arctic navigator, and in the front rank of our sealing captains.&#146;<br>
<br>Pike's achievements are seldom remembered, being overshadowed by more famous names such as Greely and especially Peary: but his skill contributed materially to their achievements.<br>
