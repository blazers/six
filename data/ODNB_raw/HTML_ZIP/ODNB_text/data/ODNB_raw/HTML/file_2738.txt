<span class="headword">Boase,  Henry Samuel</span>  (1799&#150;1883), <span class="occ">geologist and chemist</span>, was born at 6 Knightsbridge, London, on 2 September 1799, the third child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2737/', "Henry Boase (1763&#150;1827)")</script>, a banker, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Matthew Craige. He came from an extensive Cornish family; three of his nephews, C. W. Boase, G. C. Boase, and Frederic Boase, were noted for their historical and biographical work. He first attended school in Sloane Street, and in 1809 went to Blundell's School, Tiverton. He showed an early interest in chemistry, and in 1815 his father, after consulting members of another Cornish family, the Davys, decided that he should go to the Royal Cork Institution to be taught by Edmund Davy, and to work in his chemical laboratory. By 1816 Boase had decided that he wished to study medicine; he therefore left Cork against the advice of Davy, and in September 1817 started at the University of Edinburgh. He graduated in 1821 with an MD.<br>
<br>After graduation Boase returned to Penzance, where his family now lived, and in February 1822 was appointed physician to the Penzance Dispensary. He held this post for less than four years, and did not practise again, having found medicine a most unattractive profession. In 1824 he married Elizabeth Valentina (1799&#150;1876), daughter of William Stoddard of Dorset; there were ten children from this marriage. In the same year he joined his father as a partner in the Penzance Union Bank, and in a company of tin smelters, Grenfell and Boase. He began to show an interest in geology, and in 1822 was appointed secretary to the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall, a post which he held until 1827 and again from 1833 to 1837. During this time he delivered two series of lectures on chemistry and read twenty-five papers on geological subjects, four of which were published in the society's <span class="italic">Transactions</span>. In 1827, he resigned his position as secretary in order to devote time to an extensive study of Cornish geology, with the intention of completing a geological map of that county. He claimed to have walked more than 2500 miles in the course of his investigations. The map was published in 1834 in the fourth volume of the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall</span>, together with a long paper, &#145;Contributions towards a knowledge of the geology of Cornwall&#146;. The map was, however, based on Boase's conviction that granites were stratified and of the same age as the surrounding rocks, a theory which was becoming discredited, and it did not contain any information on mineral deposits, so important to Cornwall. It was therefore of little value, and only five years later was superseded by the larger scale and more detailed maps of the Geological Survey. In 1834 Boase published <span class="italic">A Treatise on Primary Geology</span>, intending to present his theory on the formation of granites before the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Edinburgh (1834), at which he was to deliver a paper. His ideas, which were closer to those of Werner than to Hutton, were forcefully criticized by the established geologists, Sedgwick, Buckland, and Lyell. He argued that mineral veins were formed at the same time as the surrounding rocks, and that all had been formed by the action of water.<br>
<br>While in Cornwall, Boase served on the committee of the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society, and as president of the Penzance Literary and Scientific Institution. In 1837 he moved to London, hoping to be appointed to a post at one of the colleges of the new university, but was disappointed. He was elected a fellow of the Geological Society in April 1837, and was a member of its council in 1838&#150;9. In May 1837 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. In 1838 he moved to Dundee, a town with which his family had banking connections. His chemical researches into dyeing and bleaching products had brought him into contact with the Scottish textile industry and he became a partner in the textile bleaching firm of Turnbull &amp; Co. In 1846 he became managing director of the same company, which then took the name of Boase &amp; Co. In this capacity he continued his chemical researches, and in 1855 he took out a patent relating to &#145;the process of drying organic substances&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). While resident in Dundee, Boase published several books on the nature of science, including <span class="italic">The Philosophy of Nature</span> (1860), in which he argued that all phenomena are the consequences of two opposed causes, and that all natural bodies are dualisms of powers, attractive and repulsive. This book attracted little notice. In a sequel, <span class="italic">An Essay on Human Nature</span> (1865), he discussed human will and the necessity of revealed religion, and made clear his opposition to the evolutionary ideas of Darwin. He retired from his textile business in 1870. He died on 4 May 1883 at his home, Seafield House, 5 Magdalen Place, Dundee, and was buried at the western cemetery, Dundee.<br>
