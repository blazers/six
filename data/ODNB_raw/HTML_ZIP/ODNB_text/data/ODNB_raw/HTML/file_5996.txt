<span class="headword">Colston,  Edward</span>  (1636&#150;1721), <span class="occ">merchant and philanthropist</span>, was born on 2 November 1636 in Temple Street, Bristol, the eldest of probably eleven children (six boys and five girls are known) of William Colston (1608&#150;1681), a merchant, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Batten (<i>d</i>. 1701). His father had served an apprenticeship with Richard Aldworth, one of the wealthiest Bristol merchants of the early Stuart period, and had prospered as a merchant. A royalist and an alderman, William Colston was removed from his office by order of parliament in 1645 after Prince Rupert surrendered the city to the roundhead forces. Until that point Edward Colston had been brought up in Bristol and probably at Winterbourne, south Gloucestershire, where his father had an estate.<br>
<br>The Colston family moved to London during the English civil war. Little is known about Edward Colston's education, though it is possible that he was a private pupil at Christ's Hospital. In 1654 he was apprenticed to the London Mercers' Company for eight years. By 1672 he was shipping goods from London, and the following year he was enrolled in the Mercers' Company. He soon built up a lucrative mercantile business, trading with Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Africa. Much of his wealth is thought to have been made in buying and selling slaves. In 1680 he became a member of the Royal African Company and subsequently sat on a number of their committees.<br>
<br>During the 1680s Colston began to take an active interest in his native city, where his parents had resettled. In 1682 he made a loan to the Bristol corporation. In 1683 he visited his fatally ill brother Thomas in the city; on this occasion he became a member of the Society of Merchant Venturers and a burgess. After Thomas's death in 1684 he inherited a mercantile business in Small Street and also became a partner in a sugar refinery at St Peter's Churchyard. He seems to have lived in Bristol for a while, but by 1689 he had taken up residence at Mortlake, Surrey, which was his base for the rest of his life. He continued to engage in overseas trade, mainly in London ventures, and made substantial business profits.<br>
<br>Though there is no record of a further visit by him to Bristol until 1700, Colston in middle age became one of the most famous philanthropic benefactors to his native city. In the 1690s he founded and endowed almshouses in King Street and on St Michael's Hill. He also endowed Queen Elizabeth's Hospital, a school for boys, and was instrumental in helping the Merchant Venturers to found Colston's Boys' School, which opened in 1710. Two years later he donated money for a school in Temple parish to educate and clothe forty poor boys. He gave money to other charity schools in Bristol and provided funds for the embellishment of several of the city's churches, including Temple, St Mary Redcliffe, St Werburgh, All Saints, and Bristol Cathedral. His munificence also extended to other parts of the country, and he gave benefactions to churches, hospitals, workhouses, and almshouses in London, Surrey, Devon, and Lancashire. But these did not match the extent of his charitable gifts to Bristol.<br>
<br>Colston was a strong tory and high-churchman who attended daily service at the cathedral when he was staying in Bristol. An opponent of Catholicism, dissent, and whiggism, he insisted that the boys at Colston's School should be Anglicans and that they be prepared for apprenticeships. He laid down strict conditions for his public charities, and founded a series of Lenten lectures in 1710 for which he chose the subjects. He was elected a member of the SPCK in 1709. In October 1710 he was returned as an MP for Bristol, but he took little active part in parliament and did not seek re-election after the dissolution that occurred with Queen Anne's death.<br>
<br>An obstinate man who set restrictions to his charitable donations, Colston remained a bachelor. He retired from business in 1708 and died on 11 October 1721 at his home in Mortlake. His public charities amounted to nearly &pound;71,000 and he bequeathed &pound;100,000 to his relatives. He left detailed instructions for his funeral: his body was carried in a hearse from London to Bristol, and then accompanied by people who had benefited from his Bristol charities to his burial on 27 October amid much pomp and ceremony at All Saints' Church. The effigy on his tomb was executed by Rysbrack from Richardson's portrait of him in the Council House, Bristol.<br>
<br>Colston has been remembered in Bristol since his death. His memory was celebrated for many years by the Colston or &#145;Parent&#146; Society, founded in 1726; by the Dolphin Society, set up by the tories in 1749; by the Grateful Society, founded in 1758, which had no political affiliation; and by the Anchor Society, founded by the whigs in 1769. Celebrating Colston's memory was part of the civic ritual of Georgian Bristol, the anniversary of his birth becoming virtually a public holiday after the 1720s. It still serves as a time for raising large donations, which are used for charitable purposes. Many of his foundations flourish today, notably the Bristol schools he established. A bronze statue of him stands in Colston Avenue, and the philanthropist is also honoured by the city's chief concert venue, the Colston Hall, and various streets that are named after him.<br>
