<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bottomley,  Arthur George</span>, Baron Bottomley  (1907&#150;1995), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 7 February 1907 at 7 Sutton Road, Tottenham, Middlesex, the eldest of the five children of George Howard Bottomley, a brass finisher and later an engineer with the firm of Houghton Butcher, and his wife, Alice Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Humphreys, daughter of the postmaster at Mount Pleasant, central London. He attended Gamuel Road council school and Pretoria Avenue Boys' School in Walthamstow. After leaving school at fourteen, he was briefly an office boy in a City textile firm before taking work as a carriage cleaner at the London, Midland, and Scottish railway workshops in Kentish Town. He grew into a tall, plain-featured man with a direct and friendly manner. An active member of the National Union of Railwaymen, he was involved in the general strike and was politicized by it.<br>
<br>For some years Bottomley attended night classes at Toynbee Hall, where he heard, among other university extension lecturers, Norman Angell, George Bernard Shaw, and Sidney Webb. Toynbee Hall also brought him into contact with Clement Attlee, who became his mentor, patron, and, &#145;in an artless, nice way&#146;, his hero  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 7 Nov 1995). With Attlee's encouragement he stood for election to Walthamstow borough council. His election in 1929 initiated what would become a twenty-year tenure of his council seat, including a term as mayor in 1945&#150;6. In 1935, with Attlee as his referee, he was appointed London organizer of the newly formed National Union of Public Employees, a post he would hold until 1945. In 1936 he married Bessie Ellen (<i>b</i>. 1906), daughter of Edward Charles Wiles. A teacher and trade unionist, Bessie Bottomley went on to make her own career in the fields of education and health, work for which she was appointed DBE in 1970.<br>
<br>Through the war years Bottomley served with energy and distinction on the home front. Having pioneered civil defence in Walthamstow in the late 1930s, he was chairman of the emergency committee and air raid precautions controller for London during the blitz. This service earned him an OBE in 1941. For the rest of the war he was deputy regional commissioner for south-east England. At the 1945 election Bottomley entered parliament as Labour MP for Chatham. In this new role he focused increasingly on overseas policy. Early in 1946 he travelled with a parliamentary delegation to India, a country that had fascinated him since a meeting with Gandhi in 1931; in Delhi he formed lasting friendships with Nehru and Krishna Menon. In May 1946 Attlee brought him into the government as under-secretary for the dominions. He led a government mission to Burma in 1947 and won esteem among the Burmese leaders; long afterwards, in 1981, he was awarded the title of Aung San Tagun, the highest Burmese title available to a foreigner. His next step upwards came in October 1947, when Attlee appointed him secretary for overseas trade, second in command to the Board of Trade's new president, Harold Wilson. A friendly alliance developed between these two, notwithstanding their very different political styles. Wilson was a politician of considerable guile; Bottomley was completely deficient in this quality, invariably believing the best of anyone with whom he had to deal.<br>
<br>Bottomley was sworn of the privy council in 1951, when Labour lost office. During the opposition years he maintained his Commonwealth interests, travelling to Kenya, Ghana, and Cyprus on parliamentary missions. But he also became an enthusiast for Europe, and served in the consultative assembly of the Council of Europe in 1952&#150;4 as well as producing in 1959 a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Why Britain should Join the Common Market</span>. At the 1959 election he lost his seat. He was forced to return to work for the National Union of Public Employees while searching for another constituency. He found time to write two short anti-communist tracts, <span class="italic">Two Roads to Colonialism</span> (1960) and <span class="italic">The Use and Abuse of Trade Unions</span> (1963). A by-election victory in Middlesbrough East in March 1962 revived his career. Eleven months later he strongly supported Wilson against George Brown for the party leadership. In his capacity as a well-respected trade unionist on the party's right wing, he played an important part in helping to put together Wilson's majority.<br>
<br>Following Labour's return to power in October 1964, Wilson appointed Bottomley secretary of state for Commonwealth relations, with a seat in cabinet. This was Bottomley's political zenith. But now came his misfortune: Rhodesia. His open and straightforward nature did not serve him well in dealing with the devious Ian Smith. Through 1964&#150;5 Bottomley appeared to believe that he was making headway in dissuading Smith from rebellion. Thus Rhodesia's unilateral declaration of independence in November 1965 made him appear na&iuml;ve. In August 1966 Wilson demoted Bottomley to Overseas Development. He was still in the cabinet but his ministerial career was fading. The end came with Wilson's request for his resignation in August 1967. Bottomley was hurt but, characteristically, not embittered. He involved himself in back-bench assignments, chairing the select committee on race relations and immigration in 1967&#150;70, a committee on Commons services in 1976, and the House of Commons commission in 1980&#150;83. Faithful to Attlee's memory, he chaired the Attlee Foundation from 1978. He served also as treasurer of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and as president of the Britain&#150;India Forum and the Britain&#150;Burma Society. Having switched from Middlesbrough East to Teesside (Middlesbrough) in 1974, he carried on as a constituency MP until his retirement from the Commons in 1983. In the following year he was created a life peer, in which capacity he attended the upper house regularly and spoke occasionally, while never seeming altogether at home there. His unrevealing volume of memoirs, <span class="italic">Commonwealth, Comrades and Friends</span>, came out in 1986 under the aegis of a publisher in India; British publishers had evinced no interest in his &#145;scandal-free life&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 8 Nov 1995).<br>
<br>Bottomley was one of the last of the old-style Labour politicians. A working man with little formal education, he made his way to Westminster through Toynbee Hall, trade unionism, and local government. He was proud of his achievements, but never lost his engaging simplicity of manner. Always a north-east Londoner at heart, he saw out his days in the house at 19 Lichfield Road, Woodford Green, that he and his wife, by whom he was survived (there were no children), had shared since the early 1950s. He died in London on 3 November 1995.<br>
