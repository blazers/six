<span class="headword">Lacy,  Walter  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1085), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was a Norman who made a great fortune for himself in the conquest of England. He and his brother Ilbert, from whom the Lacys of Pontefract were descended, shared a Norman estate centred on Lassy, from which they were named and which they held as men of the bishop of Bayeux. In England, however, they were independent operators, and Walter, who clearly already had a military reputation, was set up by King William in the southern Welsh marches alongside Earl William fitz Osbern in 1067. Together they fought the Welsh of Brycheiniog and Gwent. Walter's lands in Herefordshire and Gloucestershire&#151;where the bulk of his possessions lay&#151;had belonged to the rich Englishman Eadwig Cild and other lesser thegns; Walter made his main headquarters at Weobley, Herefordshire, which had been Eadwig's principal manor. Until 1075 Walter was second in the region only to Earl William and his son Roger de Breteuil, but the idea that he was their man can be discounted: they certainly gave him some manors as a tenant in Herefordshire and Oxfordshire, but he also forged links with Roger de Montgomery, earl of Shrewsbury, and the bishops of Hereford and Worcester, among others, which extended his lands into Shropshire and Worcestershire and made him a significant figure throughout the western midlands.<br>
<br>On the rebellion of Roger de Breteuil in 1075, Walter de Lacy remained loyal to the king and helped ensure that the revolt failed, no doubt being additionally rewarded in the aftermath. From 1075 he was the leading baron in the region, and made new links with his fellow marcher lords, including those who had been fitz Osbern's men: a niece, for example, married fitz Osbern's former follower Ansfrid de Cormeilles. Walter had some two dozen tenants on his English estates, mostly his own men rather than other tenants-in-chief, and some of them English; the leading men of his honour of Weobley witnessed the charter by which his son Roger renewed his agreements with the bishop of Hereford in 1085. A benefactor of Gloucester Abbey, he also founded and endowed the collegiate church of St Peter in Hereford. Walter died on 27 March 1085, perhaps (as later family legend had it) falling off the scaffolding while inspecting the building works at another favoured church in Hereford, St Guthlac's. He was buried in the chapter house at Gloucester Abbey.<br>
<br>Walter was survived by his wife, Ermeline, and succeeded by his son Roger de Lacy, who rebelled against William II in 1088 and again in 1094&#150;5, after which he was dispossessed and sent into exile, though the king allowed his brother Hugh to succeed. On Hugh's death, perhaps before 1115, his daughter Sibyl and her husband <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9615/', "Pain fitz John")</script> received only part of the family's lands, but under King Stephen, Roger's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15849/', "Gilbert de Lacy")</script> recovered most of it. A third son of Walter de Lacy entered Gloucester Abbey as a child and was its abbot from 1130 to his death in 1139, while a daughter became a nun at Winchester.<br>
