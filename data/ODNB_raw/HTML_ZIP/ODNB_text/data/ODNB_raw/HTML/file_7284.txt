<span class="headword">Davis,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1621), <span class="occ">sailor</span>, was one of at least four children of unknown parentage. He sailed as pilot on the <i>Ascension</i> on the first East India Company voyage under Lancaster in 1601&#150;3, a voyage on which his namesake, John Davis &#145;of Sandridge&#146; was pilot major. He was pilot of the <i>Expedition</i>, then master, in the company's third voyage in 1608&#150;9. As master on the East India Company's ship <i>James</i>, 1612&#150;15, Davis refers to his first sighting of Martin Vaz: &#145;I saw this island when I was with Michelborne&#146;  (Purchas, bk 4.440)&#151;indicating that he had sailed on Sir Edward Michelborne's interloping voyage to the East Indies, 1604&#150;6, during which John Davis of Sandridge had been killed, in 1605, and the captain had also been killed, leaving Davis to bring the ship home. He sailed again in 1616 as master of the <i>Swan</i>, which with the <i>Defence</i> was bound for Banda under <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6462/', "Sir Nathaniel Courthope's")</script> command. The expedition ran into severe difficulties, contesting trading rights and possession of the islands with the Dutch forces, leading to Courthope's death in October 1620. Davis defied Courthope's orders and went ashore for water at Wayre. He was one of a number of sailors captured by the Dutch and imprisoned at Pularoon where they &#145;were used very basely &hellip; kept in irons night and day&#146;  (letter, Nash to David, 3 Oct 1618, Purchas, bk 5.674). Davis was one of the survivors; he returned home in the <i>Unicorn</i> in 1619.<br>
<br>Back in England Davis wrote &#145;A ruter or briefe direction for readie sailings into the East India, digested into a plaine method by master John Davis of Limehouse, upon experience of his five voyages thither and home againe&#146;. The rutter, now at BL, Sloane 3959, was inserted by Samuel Purchas in his record of voyages published in 1625  (Purchas, bk 4.444). Like his contemporaries Davis gave longitudes not from a prime meridian, but by reckoning from the meridian of some well-known location, such as the Lizard or the Cape of Good Hope. He was well aware of the compass variation experienced as a ship traversed the Atlantic from Europe to Brazil and back to Africa, and used this as an additional guide to longitude. He remarks on the tidal streams, and describes the profiles of islands and coasts as seen on approach, and on the depth and nature of the adjacent sea bed, both as hazard and as good ground for anchoring.<br>
<br>Despite his experience Davis was never promoted to captain, possibly because of his quarrelsome nature and his addiction to strong drink. In January 1621 he sailed as pilot on the <i>Lesser James</i>, and succumbed to disease later that year, describing himself in his will written on 14 December 1621 as &#145;weake of body&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/141, 439<i>r</i>). He died before the year's end, while the <i>Lesser James</i> was making for Jambi in Sumatra. After bequests to his brothers Simon and Robert, his sister Elizabeth, and various kinsmen, he gave instructions for the sale of his goods aboard the <i>Lesser James</i> and ashore at Batavia, the major portion of his estate going to his wife, Jane. He also mentions that he had been to Amsterdam to demand restitution of the goods seized when he was captured by the Dutch, and was hoping that the Dutch promise to restore his possessions, made in the presence of Gabriel Towerson, would be made good on his arrival in the East Indies. When news of his death reached England Jane petitioned the East India Company directors on 9 July 1623 for his wages owing, and compensation for his imprisonment in 1618. The directors rejected her appeal, but made a token payment to relieve her poverty.<br>
