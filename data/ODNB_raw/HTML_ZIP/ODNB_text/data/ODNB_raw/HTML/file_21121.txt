<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Paget,  William</span>, first Baron Paget  (1505/6&#150;1563), <span class="occ">diplomat and administrator</span>, was born probably in Colman Street near the Guildhall, London, the son of John Pachett or Paget of London, a citizen of small fortune variously employed as a shearman and sergeant-at-mace to the sheriff of London&#151;William's enemies later reviled him as the son of a catchpole.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Paget was educated at St Paul's School, under William Lily, where his contemporaries and friends included Thomas Wriothesley, Edward North and Anthony Denny, and also John Leland whose Latin encomium, written in the mid-1540s, is the main source for Paget's youth. He went from there to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, during the mastership of Stephen Gardiner, who refers to Paget, Wriothesley, and himself as acting together in a performance of Plautus' <span class="italic">Miles gloriosus</span>&#151;Paget played Meliphidippa and Wriothesley Palestrio. Strype reports Paget as having been a scholar supported by Thomas Boleyn, and as reading books by Luther and Melanchthon, but there is no independent corroboration for this. John Foxe even states that Paget was an &#145;earnest protestant&#146; at Cambridge, but it is improbable that an overt radical would have been acceptable to Gardiner. The latter once wrote to Paget, &#145;ye told me once ye love noe extremites and the meane is best&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, ed. Muller, 74), and it was widely accepted in his later life that he was a man who abhorred extremes. In Mary's reign Foxe and Ponet saw him as a Catholic. That Richard Cox became godfather to his eldest son, Henry, along with Paget's acceptability to the German protestants, suggests that he always held a moderate course in religion.<br>
<br>It is usually assumed that Paget read civil law, but although a later hand wrote in the margin of one of the Cambridge grace books that he was the &#145;dominus Pachett&#146; admitted <i>in utroque jure</i> in 1525&#150;6 after two years of philosophy and four years in civil law, this man is more likely to have been Robert of Gonville Hall, who was probably William's brother. Although Gray's Inn admitted William Paget as an honorary member in 1537, and knowledge of civil law was certainly an asset in diplomatic posts, it is certain only that Paget was thoroughly trained in the literary, rhetorical, and linguistic skills which made him an excellent humanist, one to whom reforming rhetoricians, like Ramus, later dedicated their works. Probably about 1526&#150;7 he went to Paris for at least a year, and on his return he joined Stephen Gardiner's household.<br>
<br>In June 1528 Paget suffered an attack of sweating sickness, but recovered to take up his first appointment as one of the four clerks of the signet, and in 1529 he was elected to parliament for an unidentified seat; he is thought to have sat in every parliament thereafter until he became a peer. In June 1530 he was ordered to assist Edward Foxe, Reginald Pole, and Sir Francis Bryan, who were going to the University of Paris to solicit opinions on Henry VIII's marriage, and was credited with persuading the University of Orl&eacute;ans to condemn the pope's summons to the king. He evidently overcame his handicap of humble birth, for between 1531 and 1534 he was sent on a series of diplomatic missions to France and to the German princes, chiefly in connection with the king's divorce. He was already a master of the commonplaces of Renaissance rhetoric through which diplomacy was mediated, on more than one occasion, for instance, offering the platitude that &#145;society in a realm doth consist and is maintained by means of religion and laws. And these two or one wanting, farewel al just society&#146;  (Strype, 2/2.431).<br>
<br>Paget's associate in these early missions was Christopher Mount, who at first had to act as interpreter, but Paget seems to have learned languages quickly and gained the confidence of German princes, especially the landgrave of Hesse and the elector of Saxony. His social insignificance made him a suitable envoy for conferences with Melanchthon and other protestant divines, with the added advantage that in a crisis he was easily disavowed. Hence, perhaps, his first surviving letter, thanking Thomas Cromwell for restoring him to the king's good graces. In 1534 he was sent back to Prussia and Poland with an impressive train, for negotiations with princes who had been sweetened by a gift of 50,000 crowns. His own reward was a licence to import 400 tons of Gascon wines at reduced customs. Shortly after Paget had made another secret trip to an undisclosed destination in 1535, Henry VIII was told by Edward Foxe that Paget should be sent back to the protestant princes as the best man for the job. During these comings and goings Paget married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1587), daughter of Henry Preston of &#145;Prestcon&#146;, Lancashire. The exact date of their marriage is uncertain, but if he is the Mr Pachett noted in Cambridge University sources in 1532&#150;3 then he was already married by then. The arrival of a family may be indicated by Paget's having leased a substantial house in Aldersgate in 1534. Their eldest surviving son Henry was born in 1536&#150;7, and in March 1555 they had nine children living, six of them daughters. That the eldest of the latter, Etheldreda, was herself married by 1550, is a further pointer to her father's having married in or by the early 1530s. Paget was devoted to Anne, writing in 1545, when she was reported to have died, of &#145;my most obedient, wise, gentle and chaste wife, the remembrance of whom sitteth so deep in my heart that it maketh the same well near to burst for pain and anguish&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 20/1, no. 496). She recovered and outlived her husband, dying in February 1587.<h2>
<a name="Upwardmobility"></a>Upward mobility</h2>By 1536 Paget was well established and starting to accumulate a gentleman's estate, initially in West Drayton, Middlesex, where he was soon appointed a JP. He was appointed secretary successively to queens Jane Seymour, Anne of Cleves, and Katherine Howard, served on the grand jury which indicted Sir Geoffrey Pole for treason in 1539, and in autumn 1539 was sent to Ireland with &pound;2600 and nearly 1000 soldiers, greatly to the satisfaction of the Irish establishment.<br>
<br>On 10 August 1540, following Cromwell's execution, Paget was appointed clerk of the privy council, with the duties of maintaining its journal and engrossing bills. On 15 July 1541 he was also appointed clerk of the parliament. He attempted to reorganize government record keeping, but in September 1541 had to leave this to a deputy when he was sent as ambassador to the French court. To make him acceptable there in June 1541 he was granted a coat of arms, evidently an unsatisfactory one as the design was changed when he was knighted in 1544. As Henry was keeping Paget in ignorance of royal dealings with the emperor he lacked specific instructions, but nevertheless felt able to assure the king that &#145;I trust I have holden the balance so upright, as Your Majestie may put your fote in which syde You will, nothwithstanding anything that I have saide&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 9.180). He was also learning to manage a network of spies, maintaining informants as far afield as Rome. His long-drawn-out negotiations for the marriage of Henry's daughter Mary to the duc d'Orl&eacute;ans foundered, however, after the defeat of the Scots at Solway Moss on 24 November 1542. Fran&ccedil;ois I now roundly told Paget that no alliance would be made with England unless Scotland was an equal partner, and he sent 2000 German troops to Scotland, permitted Scottish privateers to take English shipping in Le Havre, and refused Paget permission to leave the country until his successor arrived. These actions confirmed Paget in his preference for an alliance with the emperor.<br>
<br>Paget's exchange having been effected on 18 April 1543 he was appointed on the 23rd as one of the two principal secretaries of state and admitted to the privy council, rapidly becoming the senior when his old friend Wriothesley was created lord chancellor. In January 1544 he was knighted. In 1546 he bought eleven former episcopal manors in Staffordshire, Derbyshire, and Worcestershire, centred on Beaudesert, Staffordshire, thereby becoming a prominent landowner. He actively developed his landed interests, establishing ironworks and exploiting his woods.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Paget had become one of the most powerful office-holders in the kingdom. He spoke for the monarch, controlled considerable patronage, and was the linchpin both of Henry's diplomatic correspondence and the national intelligence network. It was Paget's job to sift out from the intercepted mail and oral communications real plots from imaginary or invented ones, to distinguish reliable from double agents. To ensure the speed and secrecy of royal letters he became joint master of the posts on 29 September 1545. From 1544 he was involved in the desperate expedients employed to raise money for Henry's war with France&#151;land sales, benevolences, foreign loans, and above all currency debasement. He also became particularly concerned with the Anglo-Scottish borders, paying mercenaries and ensuring military supplies. As Henry became increasingly reclusive, Paget, who was always at the king's side except when absent on short diplomatic missions, became the essential conduit for information and direction for the resident ambassadors and for the king's other servants, while at the same time offering the advice of experience, on the principle that &#145;Men may better speke or do, beying present then absent&#146;  (Haynes, 7). He was drafting Henry's devices&#151;his personal correspondence and policy documents&#151;although the king did not always accept them. In his dealings with the imperial ambassador Vanderdelft, Paget's persuasiveness was critical to the deceptions that concealed England's weakness from her enemies.<br>
<br>During this time Paget went on five short special embassies. In May 1544 he went to the emperor, for negotiations over a proposed Anglo-imperial attack upon France. He was largely unsuccessful and had come home by 12 June, after which he was plunged into the preparations for Henry's departure for France, along with negotiations for the marriage of the fourth earl of Lennox to the king's niece, Margaret Douglas, intended to bind the earl to English interests. Paget himself led 100 foot to Boulogne but was principally absorbed in negotiations with Fran&ccedil;ois and Charles V in an abortive attempt to prevent them making a separate peace. Although Henry held Boulogne he was diplomatically isolated and therefore permitted Paget to make approaches to the German protestant princes. In February 1545, although his wife was seriously ill, he was sent back to the emperor, with whom he had a difficult interview, reporting afterwards that &#145;dissimulation, vanity, flattery, unshamefastness reign most here&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 20/1, no. 426). In November he was again sent to treat with the French, who still would not yield enough, but further negotiations in 1546 finally led on 7 June to a treaty whereby for 2 million crowns over eight years England would return Boulogne to France. Paget saw this peace as essential to his country's interests. His memoranda had made his attitude clear&#151;as long as they perceived England as disaffected in religion, the emperor and France would both be potentially hostile, and England's security required that they be kept at odds.<h2>
<a name="PagetandSeymour"></a>Paget and Seymour</h2>When Henry was in his last illness Paget conversed with him night after night, and he became a key figure in the politics surrounding Henry's death. The king looked to him to secure the condemnation of the earl of Surrey for high treason. He sat as one of the commissioners, and went to Henry VIII for secret instructions when the jurymen showed signs of doubt, returning to ensure that they convicted. It was Paget who made an agreement with Edward Seymour, earl of Hertford, in the gallery outside the death chamber, that the provisions in Henry's will for a council of state should be amended to admit the earl as protector to his nephew, the new king, and that in return he would be Hertford's principal adviser. It was Paget also who kept the notes of the promotions and grants that Henry was alleged to have planned and which were implemented within days of the king's death, with Hertford becoming duke of Somerset and Paget receiving lands worth a nominal 400 marks (&pound;266 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.) per annum. In adhering to Somerset Paget became involved in the downfall of his old friend Wriothesley, and also of his old master Gardiner.<br>
<br>Somerset did for a time honour his part of the bargain. In 1547 Paget was made both a knight of the Garter and high steward of Cambridge University, and though the imperial ambassador's report that Paget was to be made Wriothesley's successor as lord chancellor proved false, on 29 June, as Somerset went north against the Scots, he was appointed comptroller of the household, giving him authority to protect the king's interests, and also chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. In 1548 he acquired the bishop of Exeter's former London house, just outside Temple Bar, a suitable residence for a leading government official. He was concerned to reform the crown's finances, though he was aware that there were powerful vested interests in the <i>status quo</i>&#151;he later observed that Gardiner had once shown that more beer was consumed in a day at court than could run from a series of barrels, each one opened as the previous one ran dry, and &#145;proved it to be trewe in the presence of some whiche liked him ever after the worse for it&#146;  (&#145;Letters&#146;, 118).<br>
<br>Over time, however, Paget found the protector heeding him less and less, until he could describe himself as &#145;a Cassandra&#146;, fated to tell the truth and not be believed. By 1548 he was increasingly concerned for England's position both abroad and at home. He warned that Somerset's policies were giving rise to disturbances, and though he loyally followed the protector's instructions over both Sir Thomas Seymour's interrogation and Princess Elizabeth's household, his distrust of Somerset's advisers, men like Sir John Thynne, was growing, and by spring 1549, moreover, he was out of favour with Somerset's wife. He was also increasingly nervous of Somerset's sharpness and his neglect of the council, whose advice he had expected Somerset to take. He felt that in England's present financial straits, her peril from foreign foes could only be allayed by pretending to the emperor that her current religious changes were matters of little substance. Too much the realist to rely on divine intervention, he quoted on old proverb &#145;Youe maie lye longe ynough in the dytche or God will helpe youe yf youe helpe not your selfe&#146;  (&#145;Letters&#146;, 24). May 1549 saw the first of a series of risings, but Paget, who in April had been devising papers on foreign policy for the council, was in early June sent to the emperor on a vain mission to revive the treaty of alliance and extend it to comprehend Boulogne.<br>
<br>When Paget returned on 1 August the western rebellion in which his brother Robert had been a leader, had been subdued; despite a letter from Somerset saying that Robert Paget should not be spared because of his relationship to William, there is no firm evidence of his fate. The earl of Warwick, leading German mercenaries, was crushing the Norfolk risings, while France had declared war and was besieging Boulogne. Somerset's leadership, as Paget had warned, was largely discredited and Warwick gathered a majority of the lords around him. Paget avoided publicly defecting to Warwick, but although he was at Windsor with Somerset, the king, Archbishop Cranmer, and Sir Thomas Smith on 6 October, he was already preparing to mediate and was principally responsible for the conciliatory wording of the letter sent by the protector to the London lords. Somerset's surrender without a fight on 10 October, if Smith can be believed, caused Paget to fall weeping on his knees, clasping the duke about the knees and exclaiming, &#145;O my Lord, my lord, ye see now what my lords be&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 353, fol. 77). It still fell to Paget to arrest Somerset.<h2>
<a name="Ruinandrecovery"></a>Ruin and recovery</h2>Following his coup, Warwick had still to deal with the conservative group that had supported Somerset, and for this required that Paget should at least remain neutral. He also needed to put the comptrollership in the hands of a reliable subordinate in order to secure his own hold on the royal household. Following negotiations Paget surrendered the comptrollership without obtaining an alternative office, but on 3 December 1549 was summoned to the lords as Baron Paget of Beaudesert. His elevation required him to surrender his clerkship of the parliament, and he also resigned his clerkship of the signet. In January 1550 Warwick ensured Paget was out of the country when he staged his mini-coup against Wriothesley, Arundel, and others, sending him to negotiate peace with France, which kept him abroad until April. Paget was so certain that England should be rid of Boulogne, that he missed at least one concession that the French would have made over two English fortresses in Scotland. After his return Warwick acted quite contrary to Paget's advice on England's best strategy in foreign affairs, and failed to reward him with any lucrative or influential office.<br>
<br>Paget hoped that Warwick would pay more heed to the council than Somerset had done, and pressed upon him a proposal for restructuring it. Warwick certainly did restore the council to a central place in government, and the rules about the signing of warrants which had been established at the end of Henry VIII's reign were reinstituted, but Paget's crucial suggestions, including secret voting, were rejected. Indeed Warwick sidelined him, although he still required him to testify at Gardiner's trial in January 1551, when Paget alleged that Henry had thought of trying Gardiner for treason. By the summer Paget was being kept away from court under virtual house arrest, and rumours circulated that he had plotted with Arundel and Somerset to arrest his enemies at a banquet to be held in his house. When he was arrested on 21 October, however, it was for the scandal of contradicting the emperor, who claimed Paget had promised religious freedom for Mary, an embarrassment for Warwick who was pressing conformity on her. On 8 November he was in the Tower, where he stayed until more serious charges could be prepared. Although Warwick was unable to tie Paget to the plots of which Somerset was accused, he was none the less degraded, being stripped of the Garter on 22 April 1552. Edward noted in his diary that it was because Paget was no gentleman on either his father's or his mother's side. Accused of corruption as chancellor of the duchy, on 31 May 1552 he signed a submission of guilt, and two weeks later made a public confession in Star Chamber, according to John Ponet &#145;on his knes of his bribery, extortion, dissimulacion, ambicion, robbing of the king, and suche like vertues, wherby he became noble&#146;  (Ponet, sig I 1<i>v</i>). He lost his chancellorship and was then released from the Tower. His &pound;8000 fine was later reduced to &pound;4000 for which he gave lands worth &pound;125 per annum and &pound;2000 in cash, paying the latter in February 1553. In December 1552 he received a full pardon, in February following he was restored to the privy council, and in March he kissed the king's hand. Nevertheless, he remained in retirement and may not have attended the March parliament. As Edward VI neared death, it was said that 10,000 men led by the earl of Huntingdon's brother were gathering at Paget's West Drayton house. As Jane's situation became desperate Paget was summoned back to the council and signed a letter to the lord lieutenant of Essex on her behalf, but then he and the earl of Arundel almost immediately led the councillors in London in declaring for Mary and himself informed her of their decision.<h2>
<a name="QueenMarysminister"></a>Queen Mary's minister</h2>Mary appointed Paget to her privy council, restored him to the Garter, made him a commissioner to hear coronation claims, and honoured him with the role of carrying the sword of state before her at the coronation, but she did not fully trust him. She had restored Gardiner, whom Paget had so spectacularly betrayed, to his ecclesiastical offices and also appointed him lord chancellor while Paget received no immediate office in reward. The two men have generally been seen as antagonists whose rivalry tended to divide the privy council over such contentious issues as the programme for the restoration of religious ties to Rome, with Paget heading a group predominantly &#145;secular&#146; in outlook. In fact there seems to have been no fixed factional divide as groups coalesced and split up over particular issues, while Gardiner and Paget were not as far apart as has been suggested. Although Paget took a minimal interest in theology he none the less saw religion as the glue that held society together, and merely sought, as ever, to see necessary changes made with as little disruption as possible.<br>
<br>To outward appearances Paget was the principal negotiator of Mary's marriage to Philip of Spain in the latter months of 1553, while Gardiner promoted Edward Courtenay. Ponet, however, implies that such appearances were deceptive, and that the cunning Gardiner, whom he describes in this context as the &#145;doctour of practices&#146;, had merely left Paget, as &#145;his scholar&#146;, to do the necessary work and bear any odium arising from the queen's Spanish match  (Ponet, sig. I iiii <i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). Certainly although he was one of those officially appointed to treat for the marriage on 1 January 1554 Paget received no obvious reward. And although he appeared on horseback in arms at the muster in St James' Field during Sir Thomas Wyatt's rebellion and later brought Wyatt as a prisoner to court, mistrust of his advice continued. The emperor had disliked his earlier suggestion that Courtenay and Princess Elizabeth be married. He and Gardiner disagreed over the treatment of Elizabeth in the aftermath of the rebellions, and suspicions that Paget was a covert heretic, fanned by his wish to see only a few rebel leaders executed, undermined his authority, although it was said that he and some other councillors did obtain a pardon for eight conspirators by cornering Mary in her oratory. He was one of the councillors appointed to consider the laws to be put to parliament and decide who should draft them, but his preference for a step-by-step approach was ignored by Gardiner and his overt opposition in the April 1554 parliament to the detailed programme that Gardiner put forward for the restoration of the church as it had been before ties to Rome were severed, and particularly for a revival of the heresy laws, exasperated Mary who condemned him for inconstancy. Paget then avoided the council for four months.<br>
<br>Philip, however, found Paget's temperate advice essential, gave him a pension of 1500 crowns, and returned him to power. Paget argued that the distribution of monastic lands to numberless secular owners could not now be undone, and that the pope must acknowledge the <i>fait accompli</i> if Cardinal Pole's return to England and the country's reconciliation to Rome were to be made acceptable. This was reluctantly agreed and on 7 November 1554 Paget and Sir Edward Hastings went to the Low Countries and escorted Pole home. Paget took the opportunity for a private interview with the emperor, where he urged that a small inner council be set up and sought to persuade him that those born after England's breach with Rome should be treated more leniently than heretics of long-standing commitment.<br>
<br>By this time Paget's health, which had been poor for some time, was seriously deteriorating and he spent long periods either in his bed &#145;like a beast&#146; or seeking amelioration in the baths. He was absent from the council in March and April 1555, but by May was organizing a fruitless conference to arbitrate a peace between the empire and the French at Marck. He returned to England on 12 June and when it was plain that Mary's apparent pregnancy was false, again advised Philip on managing the kingdom. He was one of the inner council whose establishment Philip recommended in August before his departure for the continent. Gardiner's death on 11 November, after a reconciliation with Paget, saw the latter's formal return to the council, but although his influence was needed to counter growing anti-Spanish sentiment the queen rejected Philip's advice that Paget should be made lord chancellor on the grounds that a layman was inappropriate, appointing him lord privy seal instead on 29 January 1556. Shortly afterwards he was among those blamed for the truce of Vaucelles made on 5 February between France and the empire, which took no account of English interests.<br>
<br>Paget was now once again the main supervisor of the country's failing finances, which were further stretched in March thanks to the French-backed Dudley conspiracy. He went to Brussels in April to attempt to bring Philip back to England but though he had intended to wait and return with Philip, on 12 May he was on his way back to England. It was at this point that there occurred the event that earned him condemnation by Ponet and others. He met Sir John Cheke and Sir Peter Carew <i>en route</i> near Brussels, and although he greeted them kindly, they were suddenly arrested by the provost-marshal, carried aboard a ship, and taken to the Tower. As well as this apparent breach of faith, Ponet also accused him of seeking to betray the fervently protestant duchess of Suffolk and claimed that for this he had the queen's thanks. Always primarily concerned for peace and order, Paget may in fact have felt that a moderate Catholicism would be its best bastion, but his relations with the queen did not improve for Philip did not appear. In October and November he was away from court, but though confined to his bed he corresponded through the queen's Latin secretary James Basset about the problems of the proposed recoinage and the reduction of household expenditure. He also, uncharacteristically, led the minority of advisers who supported Philip's desire to persuade England to fight alongside the empire under the treaty of 1542. Philip's coming to England and Thomas Stafford's apparently French-backed attack on Scarborough in April 1557 put further pressure on the English government to support the Habsburgs, and in May Paget was heading a small war council as well as financing his own privateer. As war resources were virtually non-existent he also concerned himself with raising the customs rates. In January 1558 Calais fell, and Paget was virtually alone in continuing to plan for its recovery. In September he was again ill.<h2>
<a name="Retirementdeathandassessment"></a>Retirement, death, and assessment</h2>Despite general expectations that Elizabeth would give him a post, the new queen set Paget aside. His illness was a convenient excuse and he remained undisgraced, offering advice from his sickbed to Sir William Cecil and Sir Thomas Parry about peace negotiations and arguing the need for at least the appearance of a position of strength. He also provided a long analysis of the problems attendant upon the recoinage. In November 1559 he was back at court and closetted with Elizabeth who thought of sending him as ambassador to Spain, but he declined on grounds of health. In November 1560 he was again sick and made his will on the 4th, providing for his wife, children, kinswomen, and servants in conventional style. He recovered and attended the St George's day Garter feast in 1561. He died on 9 or 10 June 1563, probably at West Drayton, and was buried there on the 18th. On the evidence of his portrait dated 1549, which records him as then aged forty-three, he was about fifty-seven years old when he died. A cenotaph bearing his effigy was erected in Lichfield Cathedral by his eldest son, Henry. His second son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21118/', "Thomas Paget")</script> died in exile as a committed Catholic.<br>
<br>William Paget's subsequent reputation has always been that of a &#145;politique&#146;, albeit one endowed with considerable ability and presence. In the words of one seventeenth-century assessment, &#145;His addresse was with state, yet insinuating, his discours free but weighed, his apprehension quick but stayed, his ready and present mind keeping its pauses of thoughts and expression even with ye occasion and ye emergency&#146;  (BL, Sloane MS 1523, fol. 29<i>v</i>). Recent scholarship has generally doubted the sincerity of his convictions, while disagreeing about whether he should be seen as a statesman or merely as a pragmatist. But his political and administrative skills have been usually, though not invariably, acknowledged. Yet although the enigmatic mask that shrouded his personal feelings and beliefs reinforced his diplomatic skills, it did not prevent his being accepted as a wise and honest counsellor by the princes of Europe. It is hard to doubt the fundamental sincerity of his concern for good governance and the maintenance of law and order. His appreciation of the realities and the limitations that the existing structure of society in Europe imposed on rulers made him essentially conservative, concerned above all to avoid actions that would destabilize the realm. His invariable preference for caution and moderation enabled him to avoid the numerous traps implicit in involvement in high matters of state, but his scheming was directed more towards the benefit of the realm than of himself, and although he amassed a considerable fortune, there is no convincing evidence that he did so dishonestly.<br>
