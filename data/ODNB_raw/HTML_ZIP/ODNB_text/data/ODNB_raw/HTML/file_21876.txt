<span class="headword">Pennington,  John</span>, first Baron Muncaster  (<em>bap. </em>1741, <em>d.</em> 1813), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born in Bath, Somerset, and was baptized in Bath Abbey on 22 May 1741; he was the eldest of the three sons and four daughters of Sir Joseph Pennington, fourth baronet (1718&#150;1793), a landowner, of Muncaster Castle, Cumberland, and Warter Priory, Yorkshire, and his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1783), the daughter and heir of John Moore, an apothecary of Bath. She was long separated from her husband and died at Fulmer, Buckinghamshire, in August 1783. The Penningtons originated in Furness and had settled in Cumberland by the mid-thirteenth century, though they acquired property in Westmorland and Yorkshire by marriage. <a name="cosubject_21875"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Pennington</span>  (<em>c.</em>1394&#150;1470), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, the son and heir of Sir Alan Pennington (<i>d</i>. 1415) and his wife, Katherine, the daughter of Sir Richard Preston, fought as a young man at the battle of Agincourt in Lord Harrington's retinue. Later he was a commissioner of array and of the peace in Cumberland (1427&#150;59) and a warrior in Scotland under his Percy kinsman, the second earl of Northumberland. In 1448 he was captured by the Scots at the battle of the Sark. He sided with the Lancastrians in the Wars of the Roses, allegedly sheltering the fugitive Henry VI at Muncaster, and received from that king the cup preserved there as &#145;the luck of Muncaster&#146;. In 1412 he married Katherine, the daughter of Sir Thomas Tunstall; they had a son and two daughters. He died on 6 July 1470 and was buried at Muncaster. The baronetcy dated from 1676, with Sir William, who married the heir of Warter. The second baronet, Sir Joseph, married into the Lowther family of Lonsdale, as did his daughter. His elder son, Sir John, who defended Carlisle against the Jacobites in 1745, died unmarried, and was succeeded by his brother Joseph, the father of the subject.<br>
<br>John Pennington was educated at Winchester School (1754&#150;6), then entered the army as ensign in the 3rd foot guards. His military diary for 1758 survives among family papers now in the National Library of Scotland. He became lieutenant and captain in 1762 and transferred to the 2nd regiment as major in 1765. In 1771 he travelled to Spain. In 1773, as lieutenant-colonel of the 73rd foot stationed at Fort George, he met Dr Samuel Johnson and worsted him in a discussion about the respective military merits of Arab warriors and trained troops. In 1775 he left the army when his father moved to Warter and made over Muncaster to him. Relations between the two deteriorated following a dispute over the rental, and the arrangement was cancelled for a year until Pennington married, on 26 September 1778, Penelope (1744&#150;1806), the daughter and heir of James Compton of New York. Their son, Gamel (1780&#150;1788), named after a twelfth-century ancestor, and one of their two daughters predeceased him; the other became countess of Crawford and Balcarres.<br>
<br>Pennington had dabbled in politics before his marriage. He had intended to stand for Carlisle in 1774, and in 1780 he offered himself for Cumberland with government backing but declined a contest. His address suggested that his cousin Sir James Lowther had reneged on a promise of support for him. Instead he was returned for Milborne Port, on the Medlycott interest, on 4 December 1781. This cost him &pound;3000, and was arranged by the prime minister, Lord North. When Rockingham succeeded North, Pennington was offered a place, which he declined, in exchange for giving up his seat. This was negotiated through the duke of Grafton, who had first offered Pennington his patronage in 1775 and threatened to resign office unless something was done for him. Grafton resigned, but, thanks to him, eight months later, on 21 October 1783, Pennington was created an Irish baron; an Irish peerage was thought appropriate as he expected to foreclose on a mortgage on an Irish estate, which was security for a loan, only partly repaid, made by the trustees of his marriage settlement.<br>
<br>An early adherent of Pitt the younger, Muncaster would have preferred to sit for his county, but Lowther continued to keep him out. He considered himself the government's best friend in Cumberland, and in 1789 erected a pyramid at Muncaster Castle to mark the king's recovery from his illness. In the Commons he seconded a successful motion on 20 March 1789 to commemorate the revolution of 1688 and on 14 December 1790 praised the convention with Spain. No later speech is known, but he found a new cause in William Wilberforce's campaign to abolish the slave trade: they had met in the Lake District in 1784. His <span class="italic">Historical Sketches of the Slave Trade and its Effects in Africa</span> (1792) proved a useful source book for abolitionists, and Wilberforce assured him that they were &#145;tuned in the same key&#146;  (Wilberforce and Wilberforce, 1.68). Muncaster was a teller for abolition in divisions of 1791, 1794, and 1796.<br>
<br>By 1796 Muncaster's constituency had succumbed to a rival interest and he turned to the government for a replacement seat. He was offered Colchester, which he could ill afford while engaged on a Gothic renovation of Muncaster, but he was returned, together with the well-to-do Robert Thornton, who headed the poll and was also linked with Wilberforce. His building activities, which included a choice octagonal library, soon prejudiced his parliamentary attendance, however, and he relied on Wilberforce and the press for political information. He raised 200 volunteer soldiers, or &#145;mountaineers&#146;, in 1798, and he backed Pitt's successor Addington, writing of his approval of peace preliminaries with France in November 1801. Realizing that his neglect would lose him Colchester in 1802, he offered himself at York, only to withdraw. In 1804 he revived his hopes of sitting for Cumberland at the next vacancy, but the Lowther interest withstood him. He lamented Pitt's death, which nevertheless led to his return to parliament for Westmorland, with Lowther's backing conditional on his support for the Grenville ministry. His wife died in an accident on 15 November 1806 while she was out canvassing on his behalf. In spite of his grief, Pennington travelled to Westminster to join Wilberforce in voting to abolish the slave trade in February 1807.<br>
<br>Muncaster's parliamentary seat proved to be secure with Lowther's support, but his interest in politics had waned, and he had to be importuned to attend in support of government. In January 1811 he voted for the regency restrictions only after ascertaining that a rumour of the Lowthers' desertion to opposition was false. His last political gesture was to vote against Catholic relief in the first session of the 1812 parliament. He died at Muncaster Castle on 8 October 1813 and was buried at Muncaster on 15 October. His age at death is incorrectly given as seventy-six on his memorial, one of several to members of his family that he designed himself. Muncaster Castle was his glory: he planted thousands of trees and stocked the demesne with cattle and Yorkshire wold sheep. He was an agricultural improver who imported new ideas or tried his own, such as summer fallows for wheat, feeding potatoes to cattle, growing cabbages and carrots, and using tidal mud and mussels as fertilizers and sea sand to check moss. He arranged for his daughter to have a twenty-one-year lease of Muncaster after his death.<br>
<br>Muncaster was succeeded in the barony by his surviving brother, <a name="cosubject_21877"></a><span class="headword">Lowther Pennington</span>, second Baron Muncaster  (1745&#150;1818), <span class="occ">army officer</span>. Having been commissioned as an ensign in the Coldstream Guards in 1764, he was promoted lieutenant and captain in 1772, captain and lieutenant-colonel in 1778, colonel in 1783, major-general in 1793, lieutenant-general in 1799, and full general in 1808. His next brother had been killed in a duel, and he himself had killed a fellow officer in another duel at New York over the latter's humming of a tune in 1777. In 1793 he served in Flanders under the duke of York, who informed the king of his overzealous attack on a French battery, which cost his men heavily. The duke found that Pennington was unpopular with the Coldstreams, especially when he furiously insisted on the court-martialling of the regimental adjutant, who was acquitted. His personal bravery was not in question. The 131st foot, of which he was colonel in 1795, was called Pennington's regiment. He took half pay soon afterwards and became colonel of the 10th veteran battalion in 1806. He married, on 13 January 1802, Esther (<i>d</i>. 1827), the daughter of Thomas Barry of Clapham, Surrey, and the widow of Captain James Morrison, an infantry officer. Their only son inherited the barony on Pennington's death in London, on 29 July 1818, at his house in Grosvenor Place. He was buried at St George's, Hanover Square.<br>
