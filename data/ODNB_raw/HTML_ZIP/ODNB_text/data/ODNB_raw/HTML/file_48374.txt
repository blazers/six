<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Elliott,  William</span>  (1780/81&#150;1853), <span class="occ">maker of scientific instruments</span>, was born in 1780 or 1781 in the parish of St Andrew, High Holborn, London, the son of William Elliott, yeoman, of Tash Court, Gray's Inn Lane in the county of Middlesex. On 14 April 1795 he was bound apprentice for seven years to William Backwell, compass and drawing instrument maker, of Tash Street, Gray's Inn Lane. He was re-bound in May 1795 in the Coach and Coach Harness Makers' Company; in 1804 he became a freeman and bound his own first apprentice. This was probably the year when he commenced his own business.<br>
<br>Between 1804 and 1814 Elliott took five apprentices and between 1832 and 1839 another four, thus usually having two or three apprentices at a time. All these were bound in the Coach and Coach Harness Makers' Company; there may have been others between those years. He was, very probably, the William Elliott living at 26 Wilderness Row, Goswell Street, from 1808 to 1816 and his addresses are known with certainty thereafter. From 1817 to 1827 his business was at 21 Great Newport Street, and from then until 1833 at 227 High Holborn. His home and business were at 268 High Holborn from 1835 to 1849 and at 56 Strand from 1850 until his death.<br>
<br>In 1804 Elliott married Elizabeth Thrale, or Thrah, at St Martin-in-the-Fields. Their son, William (<i>b</i>. 1804), studied at Queens' College, Cambridge, and entered the Church of England. As the Revd William Elliott he wrote <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Slide Rule</span> which was advertised in the catalogues of the family's company. From Elliott's second marriage, to Anne Berner, there was a daughter, Anne. His third wife was Emma Paget, the widow of a Captain Kelly. Their children were <a href="#cosubject_54620">Frederick Henry (<i>b</i>. 1819) [<i>see below</i>]</a>, George Augustus (<i>b</i>. 1821), <a href="#cosubject_54621">Charles Alfred (<i>b</i>. 1822) [<i>see below</i>]</a>, Eliza (<i>b</i>. 1829), and possibly others. In Elliott's will there was provision for a married daughter Mary, whose birth record is untraced.<br>
<br>The absence of advertisements and catalogues prior to 1850 suggests that Elliott supplied his products mostly to the trade and was well known within it. No record has been found of his gaining prizes or awards for his products. He was not active in guild matters. He did not seek membership of learned societies or the protection of patents, again suggesting that he worked within the trade and its requirements, as he did with J. W. Woolgar on his new plotting scale. Elliott was one of the first to use German silver, a new alloy with good resistance to corrosion, in his drawing instruments. Many examples of these, and of scales, survive from his early places of work. Later he described himself as a mathematical, optical, and philosophical instrument maker and other products from these years include a theodolite and a vacuum pump. In 1850, under a deed of partnership, his sons Frederick Henry and Charles Alfred were taken into their father's business which then carried on as William Elliott &amp; Sons at 56 Strand, London.<br>
<br>Elliott died in 1853; in his will he left his share in the partnership to provide his wife with an annuity. His passing went largely unrecorded but years later he was referred to in his son Frederick's obituary as &#145;the well-known mathematical instrument-maker, Mr. W. Elliott in Holborn&#146;.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54620"></a><span class="headword">Frederick Henry Elliott</span>  (1819&#150;1873) was privately educated at Baldock and Edmonton, then obtained his master's degree at Christ's College, Cambridge in 1848. He practised as a <span class="occ">surveying engineer</span> before joining his father and brother in business in 1850. The new partnership began to make itself more widely known, advertising in textbooks, issuing catalogues, and taking part in exhibitions. Two medals were won in the 1851 Great Exhibition, beginning a series of successes in exhibitions in Britain and abroad.<br>
<br>Frederick Elliott became a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1850 and in 1859 a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society. Jointly, Frederick and Charles obtained patents for improvements in drawing boards, barometers, and telescopes. The company worked willingly with academics and others to realize their inventions; instruments for the new applications of electricity were produced and became an important part of the firm's activity. Customers included J. C. Maxwell, Charles Wheatstone, J. W. Strutt, and other leading scientists. The company prospered, its success attributed to Frederick's business ability. Details of his marriage, to Susan Pearse, are unknown. He died of a stroke in his office at 449 Strand, London on 18 January 1873.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54621"></a><span class="headword">Charles Alfred Elliott</span>  (1822&#150;1877) was apprenticed to his father as <span class="occ">mathematical instrument maker</span> on 27 October 1837 for seven years and became a partner in 1850. He was married; his wife's name was probably Maria Sarors; there was a daughter Gertrude. He retired before 1873 and died at Teddington, Middlesex on 9 October 1877.<br>
<br>When William Elliott's career began London's thriving scientific instrument trade was the province of individual craftsmen. By widening his activities he remained a significant and respected supplier through its transition to large-scale manufacture and application. The creation of a partnership with his sons ensured the continuity and expansion of a business which became one of the largest producers of scientific instruments, remaining so until 1967 when it was taken over by English Electric, which itself became part of GEC soon afterwards.<br>
