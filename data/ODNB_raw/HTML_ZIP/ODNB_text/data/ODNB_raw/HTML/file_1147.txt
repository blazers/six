<span class="headword">Bakewell,  Robert</span>  (1767&#150;1843), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born on 10 March 1767 in Nottingham, the youngest son of Robert Bakewell (1729&#150;1768), a Quaker wool-stapler, and his wife, Mary (1740&#150;1811), daughter of George Mason, farmer and Quaker preacher of Kirkbymoorside, Yorkshire, and later America. He was distantly related to Robert Bakewell (1725&#150;1795), the noted farmer and stockbreeder. Following his father's early death Bakewell was sent to the school for well-to-do Friends at Hartshill, Warwickshire, where he proved to be a precocious child, constructing telescopes and writing his first paper, on water spouts, which was published in 1786. By 1789 Bakewell had moved to Wakefield as a wool-stapler. The following year, on 24 September, he married Apphia (<i>d</i>. 1820), daughter of Thomas Simpson. The Simpsons were Unitarian and Bakewell had joined this church by September 1791. The couple had six children, the last baptized in 1800.<br>
<br>Bakewell's activities as wool-stapler were interspersed with travel. His interest in natural history was revealed by a visit to north Wales about 1801. From 1801 Bakewell, dependent on foreign trade, was also highly active in the national peace movement, corresponding with the whig politician Samuel Whitbread (1764&#150;1815) in 1807. The following year Bakewell's first book, <span class="italic">Observations on the Influence of Soil and Climate upon Wool</span>, was published. However, in July 1810, unable to meet his creditors at a time of national financial difficulty, Bakewell assigned all his estates to them and fled to London, where he became a geological consultant, building on his knowledge of soils, charging &#145;one hundred pounds for any time not exceeding one month and twenty pounds for travelling expenses&#146;  (Banks MSS). His first advertisement for the services of Robert Bakewell &amp; Sons, in the <span class="italic">Mineralogical and Statistical Survey of Estates</span>, was issued by August 1810. Bakewell was elected annual subscriber to the Royal Institution late the same year&#151;clearly he was in search of patrons. In 1811 he published descriptions of the cobalt mine on Alderley Edge and on the application of mineralogical and chemical science to the selection of building stone. In the autumn of that year his first known geological consulting took him to Shropshire and Radnorshire, and the following year he was in Charnwood Forest, acting as consultant to the earl of Moira.<br>
<br>In 1811 Bakewell began to give public lectures on geology throughout Britain, with courses in Derby, Liverpool, and Manchester in 1811; London in 1812; Newcastle, Leeds, and London in 1813; Exeter and Bath in 1815; and Cornwall, Cheltenham, and Gloucester in 1816. His last were in Bristol and London in 1817. Probably the first such lectures to be given throughout Britain, they particularly directed the attention of landed proprietors to the neglected mineral treasures of their estates, as well as offering Bakewell chances to make field observations all over Britain. Those on the geology of Manchester were published in 1814, on Northumberland and Durham in 1815 (amid charges of plagiarism), and on the south coast in 1816.<br>
<br>Lecturing soon revealed to Bakewell the need for an introductory textbook on geology and inspired his <span class="italic">An Introduction to Geology</span>, for which he is best remembered. It was first published in June 1813, partly at his own expense. In the early 1900s the historian of the Geological Society recorded that Bakewell's was &#145;undoubtedly the best of the early text-books&#146;  (H. B. Woodward, <span class="italic">History of the Geological Society of London</span>, 1907, 84). It went through five English editions and three American. The first edition already distinguished bedding from slaty cleavage and correctly identified the feeder origin of the basalt on Titterstone Clee Hill.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Introduction</span> was motivated by the need to use geology in the practical exploration of the valuable mineral treasures of the British Isles, but it deprecated the excessive foreign influence on British geology, which many other working geologists also felt was too dominant. Bakewell noted how &#145;the term &#147;well educated Geognost&#148; &hellip; denotes a perfect disciple of Werner, who has lost the use of his own eyes by constantly looking through the eyes of his master&#146; and called Werner's theory of mineral veins &#145;demonstrably repugnant to facts&#146;. Such views were not well received by the Wernerian-dominated Geological Society and Bakewell was forced to decline membership about 1813, the year in which he also unsuccessfully applied for the post of professor of mineralogy to the Dublin Society.<br>
<br>John Farey met Bakewell in May 1812 and they engaged in stimulating discussions, both before and after the publication of Bakewell's first edition. Farey advised Bakewell how the book could be improved and the second edition contained additional notes on the work of William Smith (1769&#150;1839) and Farey. It was this edition, also translated into German, which inspired Charles Lyell to take his first interest in geology. Adam Sedgwick also regarded himself as a pupil, because of the influence Bakewell's book had on him.<br>
<br>In 1819 Bakewell contributed to Abraham Rees's influential <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia</span>, on both wool and geology. Bakewell's popularizing attempt at <span class="italic">An Introduction to Mineralogy</span> appeared the same year. This was sufficiently successful for an unknown rival to issue a volume with the same title in 1829 under the carefully chosen pseudonym of J. R. Bakewell. In 1820 Bakewell produced his mocking, and highly political, <span class="italic">Geological Primer in Verse</span>, which for many years was wrongly credited to John Scafe. The <span class="italic">Primer</span> caused a new rift with members of the Geological Society, who found it &#145;an offence of such overwhelming magnitude that there are no purifying waters in Oxford or London to efface it&#146;  (Bakewell to Sedgwick, 10 Dec 1830, Sedgwick MSS).<br>
<br>Bakewell's first wife had died in March 1820 and on 31 August that year he married Esther (<i>c</i>.1770&#150;1851), daughter of Dr Henry Hinckley (<i>c</i>.1724&#150;1779) of Guy's Hospital, former treasurer of the Royal College of Physicians. The marriage brought Bakewell financial independence and late in 1820 the couple set off on a long tour to the Tarentaise and to Switzerland. Bakewell's two-volume <span class="italic">Travels in the Tarentaise &hellip; 1820 [to] 1822</span> appeared in 1823. Because of his battles with the Geological Society there were few reviews. He considered the <span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span>'s review particularly unfair; it might have contributed to his now abandoning geology for three or four years. The work contained an early description in English of the volcanic geology of the Auvergne and insights into the ages of alpine rocks based on fossils.<br>
<br>However, Bakewell had never been totally convinced of the importance of dating rocks from fossils, and wrote in 1834 how &#145;the importance attached to [fossil] shells is a ridiculous fallacy&#146;  (Bakewell to Mantell, 7 Dec 1834, Mantell MSS).<br>
<br>In 1825 the Bakewells settled in a cottage on Downshire Hill, Hampstead, Middlesex. In 1828 Bakewell issued the third edition of his textbook which was soon taken up by Benjamin Silliman (1779&#150;1864) at Yale as his course text; a first American edition appeared in 1829. Eight hundred copies of the second American edition were sold in New England in the spring of 1835 and Silliman noted that the book was &#145;conspicuous for attractiveness, &hellip; of a style generally vigorous and correct, often eloquent and beautiful and of an independence of spirit&#146;  (4th edn, 1833, preface). In 1833 Bakewell resumed occasional geological lecturing. He also wrote the sections on geology for J. R. Macculloch's <span class="italic">Statistical Account of the British Empire</span> (1837).<br>
<br>Bakewell, who could be caustic in his criticisms, was long a victim of gout. He died on 15 August 1843 at home in Hampstead and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. His geological collections were sold at auction in May 1844. His wife's &#145;earnest wish [was] that there should not be any Memoir or Obituary of him in any of the Periodicals &hellip; since there were no circumstances connected with his early years &hellip; of sufficient interest to be brought before the public&#146;  (Esther Bakewell to Mantell, 16 Aug 1843, Mantell MSS). She must have feared Bakewell's early radical politics and financial problems might be revealed. As a result the only notice that appeared was that of Silliman in America, unaware of her embargo.<br>
<br>Bakewell's son Robert (1792&#150;1875) moved in 1828 to America to teach drawing at Yale. His youngest son, Frederick Collier (1800&#150;1869), after a career as a newspaper proprietor, became a scientific writer and inventor. His most important invention was the facsimile machine patented in 1848.<br>
