<span class="headword">Lavery, Sir  John</span>  (1856&#150;1941), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Belfast, the second son of Henry Lavery (<i>d</i>. 1859), a publican, and his wife, Mary Donnelly (<i>d</i>. 1859). His exact date of birth is unknown, but he was baptized in St Patrick's Roman Catholic Church, Donegal Street, Belfast, on 26 March 1856. His father died in the sinking of the <i>Pomona</i>, <i>en route</i> for New York, on 29 April 1859; three months later his mother died, apparently of grief. Lavery then lived with his father's brother and his wife, aunt Rose, on their farm until, at the age of ten, he was sent to live in Saltcoats, Ayrshire, with a cousin of Rose, a pawnbroker. When he was seventeen he was apprenticed to a photographer in Glasgow and resolved to become a painter. He was a successful and diligent employee and saved enough from his salary to pay his fees at the Haldane Academy of Art in Glasgow, a predecessor of the Glasgow School of Art, which followed the South Kensington curriculum.<br>
<br>In his earliest paintings Lavery was influenced by the work of various minor but financially successful Glasgow artists, usually historical genre painters, whose pictures were derided by the group of painters with whom Lavery was later associated, the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64500/', "Glasgow Boys")</script>. This admiration of an ability to earn a substantial living by painting popular but aesthetically inferior work is indicative of an ambitious and calculating streak in Lavery's character which perhaps prevented him from making the best intellectual and artistic use of his undoubted facility as a painter. Two incidents give evidence of his ruthlessness. His sister, who lived in his Glasgow flat as his housekeeper, became pregnant, and Lavery encouraged her to follow her lover to America, thus concealing her plight from his social circle. She soon returned, however, pregnant again, and Lavery refused to take her in. Two days later she committed suicide, drowning in the River Clyde. When, in his eighties, he wrote his autobiography, secure in his knighthood and social position, Lavery was able to express his remorse, but in 1876 she was a social embarrassment to an aspiring young painter. From the late 1870s he began to exhibit his genre paintings in and around Glasgow and with the proceeds bought and insured a studio in the city. Very shortly afterwards it succumbed to a mysterious fire, and with the &pound;300 insurance money Lavery financed his departure in 1880 for the Heatherley School of Fine Art in London and then Paris.<br>
<br>Lavery enrolled at the Atelier Julian in Paris in 1881 and began to associate with the young British and American artists who followed the <i>plein-air</i> creed of Jules Bastien-Lepage. The latter's impact on these young artists, including James Guthrie and Stanhope Forbes, was crucial in the development of British painting in the 1880s. Lavery sought him out and eventually followed his example of painting contemporary life by settling in Grez-sur-Loing, where he painted the life of the village and its inhabitants <i>en plein air</i>. He was joined at Grez by two other Glasgow artists, William Kennedy and Thomas Millie Dow, and together they formed one of the three distinct factions of the group that was to become known as the Glasgow Boys. Throughout the early 1880s Lavery often returned to Glasgow and was a frequent exhibitor at the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts, where he would have seen the works of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33613/', "James Guthrie")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38954/', "E. A. Walton")</script>, George Henry, and William York Macgregor. They were also responding to the naturalism of Bastien-Lepage, and from 1885 they joined with Lavery and other Glasgow artists of similar interests in forming a loose association of painters who were to exhibit together in Glasgow, London, and across Europe and North America. Despite Lavery's adherence to Bastien-Lepage's teaching and example, his paintings of this period retain an anecdotal or narrative element, as he realized that this was vital in ensuring sales to an unsophisticated Scottish clientele. Even in his masterpiece of this period, <span class="italic">On the Loing, an Afternoon Chat</span> (1884; Ulster Museum, Belfast), there is a strong element of genre that is missing in the work of James Guthrie and E. A. Walton, his main Glasgow rivals. Further, on his return to Scotland in 1885, Lavery realized that to sell to the middle classes he needed to change his subject matter from the rural poor to something more socially acceptable. This resulted in <span class="italic">The Tennis Party</span> (1885; Aberdeen Art Gallery), a key work in the development of British painting, both in its artistic complexity and subject matter and in its translation of naturalistic painting from rural subjects to a more sophisticated urban setting.<br>
<br>In addition this picture owed much to photography, in which Lavery was a skilled practitioner, although he concealed its use as it was not considered a valid artistic tool. It was also of vital assistance to him in the completion of the work which was a foundation of his career as one of the leading portrait painters of his age. In 1888 Glasgow staged a major international exhibition in Kelvingrove Park. Its aim was to raise funds for a new municipal art gallery, and the Glasgow Boys played a considerable part in the organization of its artistic events. Lavery painted a series of small pictures, sometimes little more than vignettes, of the events, buildings, and colourful figures which characterized the success of the exhibition. The exhibition was visited by Queen Victoria, and Glasgow corporation offered a commission of &pound;600 for an artist to record the formal ceremony of her visit. The fee did not attract many artists, as the successful artist would be expected to record all of the 253 persons present. Lavery realized that the commission would be a milestone in his career and accepted the enormous task, not without some trepidation. He had surreptitiously photographed the ceremony from a vantage point above the queen's dais, and this photograph became the basis for his composition. He had some difficulty persuading the various participants to sit for him but eventually settled for a formula of making a quick sketch and taking a portrait photograph in his studio. Many of these sketches, like the exhibition pictures themselves, confirm his gifts as reporter, and once the queen had been persuaded to give him a twenty-minute sitting he found that the other participants in the event were unable to refuse his requests for sittings. The result, <span class="italic">The State Visit of Queen Victoria to the International Exhibition, Glasgow, 1888</span> (1888; Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries), although somewhat stiff and unnatural compared to Lavery's contemporary work, formed the basis of his subsequent career.<br>
<br>In 1889 Lavery met Kathleen McDermott 
    (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Annie Evans; <i>c</i>.1872&#150;1891)
  , whom he married in 1890 and who died a year later after giving birth to their daughter, Eileen. He painted many of the leading industrialists and society figures of the period, including Miss Mary Burrell (1895; Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries), the daughter of the shipowner and art collector Sir William Burrell; and also, in 1893, R. B. Cunninghame Graham (Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries), who became a close friend and introduced him to Morocco, where a number of the Glasgow Boys, among them Joseph Crawhall, Arthur Melville, William Kennedy, and Thomas Millie Dow, were also to live and paint. He was elected a member of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1896 and began to exhibit at the Royal Academy in London. Lavery's career was by this time well established, and as the Glasgow Boys achieved national and international renown he moved to London in 1896. In 1897 he helped establish the International Society of Painters, Gravers, and Sculptors in London, with J. A. M. Whistler as president and himself as vice-president. Whistler became a close friend and inspiration for many of his finest later portraits, but his reputation was made by his success as a more prosaic portrait painter than Whistler had ever been.<br>
<br>Although Lavery continued to paint a wide variety of subjects, often drawn from his life in Morocco, where he had a house in Tangier, he was best-known for formal portraits of the royal family (<span class="italic">The King, the Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Princess Mary</span>, 1911; NPG) and those of major social and political figures of his day, notably <span class="italic">La dame aux perles (Baroness von H&ouml;lriggl)</span> (1901) and <span class="italic">Winston S. Churchill, MP</span> (1915) (both Hugh Lane Municipal Art Gallery, Dublin). He was also accomplished in the rendering of complex interior studies, which reflected his interest, among other things, in contemporary politics and racing&#151;such as the trial of Roger Casement in <span class="italic">The Court of Criminal Appeal</span> (1916; Hugh Lane Municipal Art Gallery, Dublin) and <span class="italic">The Jockey's Dressing Room at Ascot</span> (1923; Tate collection). As a war artist he produced the memorable <span class="italic">First Wounded at London Hospital</span> (1914; Dundee Museums and Galleries) and <span class="italic">A Convoy, North Sea, 1918, from NS7</span> (IWM).<br>
<br>Lavery's own family life, particularly after his marriage to Hazel Martyn Trudeau [<a name="cosubject_59746"></a><span class="headword">Hazel Jenner Lavery</span>, Lady Lavery  (1880&#150;1935)<span class="occ"></span>], provided material for many of his finest later works (such as <span class="italic">The Studio Window, 7 July 1917</span>; Hugh Lane Municipal Art Gallery, Dublin). Lavery met Hazel, who was born in Chicago on 14 March 1880, the daughter of the industrialist Edward Jenner Martyn, in Brittany in 1903, shortly before her marriage, on 28 December 1903, to Dr Edward Livingstone Trudeau junior (1863?&#150;1904), with whom she had a daughter, Alice, born after Trudeau's death in May 1904. Lavery married her, with Cunninghame Graham as best man, on 22 July 1909. Hazel Lavery became one of the great society hostesses of her day&#151;the friend, confidante, and occasionally lover to many powerful social and political figures. Her close friendship with Michael Collins was crucial in his negotiations with the British government over the future of the Irish Free State in 1920&#150;21.<br>
<br>Lavery and his wife were supporters of Irish home rule, and after the establishment of the Irish Free State they spent much time in Dublin, although Lavery never denied or neglected his roots in Belfast; he presented large groups of his paintings to both cities. Such was his involvement with Irish politics and politicians of the 1920s and 1930s&#151;he painted Eamon de Valera and a posthumous portrait of Michael Collins&#151;that his portrait of Hazel as the personification of Ireland, Cathleen ni Houlihann (<span class="italic">Killarney</span>; Central Bank, Dublin), was incorporated on the free state banknotes, in use from 1928 to 1975. Hazel died on 1 January 1935, and Lavery's daughter, Eileen, also died in the same year. A grieving Lavery moved to the USA and established another career as a portrait painter of America's aristocracy, the stars of Hollywood, painting, among others, Maureen O'Sullivan, Loretta Young, and Shirley Temple.<br>
<br>Lavery was honoured by academies and institutes around the world. He was knighted in 1918, and was a member of the orders of the Crown of Italy and of Leopold of Belgium. In 1906 he became a member of the Royal Hibernian Academy and in 1921 of the Royal Academy; he was also a member of the academies of Rome, Antwerp, Milan, Brussels, and Stockholm. He was a freeman of both Belfast and Dublin and received honorary doctorates from the Queen's University of Belfast and Trinity College, Dublin.<br>
<br>Lavery died on 10 January 1941 at Rossenarra House, Kilkenny, Ireland, and was buried at Putney Vale cemetery, London. After his death his reputation began to wane, as social and financial ambition had set him apart from the other Glasgow Boys, who similarly aimed for recognition and security as painters but who did not compromise their work as frequently as Lavery did. By the end of the twentieth century, however, with the critical reassessment of the advances made both by the Glasgow Boys and by other naturalist painters of the period, his early paintings were recognized by a steep rise in their price. The few guineas achieved by Christies for major late works at the end of the 1940s have been eclipsed by the hundreds of thousands of pounds regularly paid for his early works some fifty years after his death.<br>
