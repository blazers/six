<span class="headword">Morrison,  Roderick</span> <span class="st"> [An Cl&agrave;rsair Dall,  the Blind Harper]</span>  (1656?&#150;1713/14), <span class="occ">Scottish Gaelic poet and harpist</span>, was the eldest son of John Morison (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1630), tacksman of Bragar in the island of Lewis, and descended from the Morison breves, or hereditary judges, who were latterly located in Ness, Lewis. He is said to have fallen ill with smallpox while at school in Inverness, and lost his sight. Instead of following a clerical career, like a younger brother, he seems to have cultivated playing musical instruments, and is said to have spent some time in Ireland developing his skill as a harpist. From internal evidence in one of his poems he spent some time roving with a band of musicians and entertainers, before meeting Iain Breac, a chief of the MacLeod clan at Dunvegan, Skye, in Edinburgh, probably in 1681. By 1683 Morrison was established in Dunvegan, holding a farm in tack from the chief, and acting as harpist and apparently as poet in some situations. William Matheson, in his introduction to the edition of Morrison's poems, argues that he was not employed as a professional musician or poet, but rather enjoyed patronage as a fellow-gentleman who had highly developed artistic skills. Morrison had two younger brothers who were clergymen, one (Angus) the author of some entertaining verses. Roderick Morrison was married to Catherine Stewart, from Lochaber. The close relationship between Morrison and Iain Breac seems to have broken down after some years, and Morrison was given the tenancy of a farm in Glenelg, on the mainland opposite southern Skye, where he felt remote and estranged. This move may have taken place as early as 1688, the year of the Jacobite rising, and may be connected with Morrison's Jacobite sympathies. He came to have closer ties after this with John MacLeod of Talisker (also in Skye).<br>
<br>Only seven poems survive with unambiguous ascriptions to An Cl&agrave;rsair Dall. Some of these are still sung, and there are published transcriptions of the song airs in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century sources, but the evidence of tunes for the harp composed by Morrison is scanty and inconclusive  (Matheson, 169ff.). Two of the poems are about Iain Breac, one praising him in conventional eulogistic language but with personal and emotional commitment also, and the other a moving elegy on his death in 1693. Iain Breac was buried in Rodel, Isle of Harris, and Morrison is thought to have been at the funeral. In a stanza from this elegy he records Iain Breac's role as a patron of poets and musicians:<blockquote>Wrapped in the linen shroud did I leave the strength of the weak, the journey's end of men of song, as also the wealth of men of ancient lore, and the treasury of learned poets&#151;your death has set them in disarray; and since you went into the coffin I am no object of envy. (&#145;Creach na Ciadaoin&#146;, &#145;Wednesday's bereavement&#146;, Matheson's translation)</blockquote>Probably the best-known of Morrison's poems is addressed to Iain Breac's son Roderick, who succeeded him as chief. This poem creates as a main character the Echo of past generosity and greatness, who still resounds in Dunvegan but who has been replaced by a quite different image, that of the young fashionable spendthrift who spends most of his time in the south and who cares little for his family's native traditions. This gives an early and detailed picture both of the traditional, idealized concept of the clan chief and artistic patron, and of the de-Gaelicized chief: over the next two centuries the latter was to become the norm. One aspect of this revolution is detailed in the following stanza:<blockquote>He comes out of the shop with the latest fashion from France, and the fine clothes worn on his person yesterday with no little satisfaction are tossed into a corner&#151;&#145;The style is unmodish, not worth a plack. On the security of a townland or two, take the pen and sign a bond&#146;. (&#145;Oran do Mhac Le&ograve;id Dh&ugrave;n Bheagain&#146;, &#145;A song to MacLeod of Dunvegan&#146;)</blockquote>This attitude was later to contribute to the clearing of clansmen and to the sale of estates to incomers. An Cl&agrave;rsair Dall is a percipient observer of such trends. The poet died in 1713 or 1714. His work has been carefully and judiciously edited by William Matheson.<br>
