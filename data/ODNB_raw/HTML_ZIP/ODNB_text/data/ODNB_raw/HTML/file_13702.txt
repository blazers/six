<span class="headword">Hoole,  Elijah</span>  (1798&#150;1872), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born in Manchester on 3 February 1798, the second son of Holland Hoole, shoemaker and lay Wesleyan preacher, and his wife, Sarah. He was educated at Manchester grammar school (1809&#150;13) and he then studied Greek and Hebrew privately. He was a devout Wesleyan and in 1819, after he had served as a probationer with the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society (WMMS) in London, the society selected him to found a mission at Bangalore in south India. He was shipwrecked on the outward voyage and settled initially at Negapatam, but in May 1821, with seven months of intensive Tamil study behind him, he finally arrived at Bangalore. Barely ten months later, however, he was ordered to Madras to work on a new Tamil translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> for the Bible Society and in September 1822 he became secretary of the society's translations committee.<br>
<br>In 1828 ill health forced Hoole back to Britain. While recuperating he wrote up his journal, <span class="italic">Personal Narrative of a Mission to the South of India</span> (1829; 2nd edn, 1844), and then accepted the job of superintending the Wesleyan schools in Ireland. He was appointed assistant secretary to the WMMS in 1834, and in 1836 general secretary, a post he held until his death. In 1835 he married Elizabeth, third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5376/', "Charles Chubb (1772&#150;1846)")</script>, lock- and safe-maker of London; they had two sons, Charles Holland and Elijah. Elizabeth became effectively the women's secretary of the WMMS. She played mother to the many missionaries passing through her house, corresponded with their wives all over the world, and for twenty years edited <span class="italic">Juvenile Offering</span>, the Wesleyans' first missionary magazine for children.<br>
<br>Hoole's efficiency and diligence in transacting WMMS business were universally admired; nevertheless, in correspondence he could be abrasive and he often intervened forcefully in controversial issues such as the baptism of polygamists. Outside the WMMS he was honorary secretary of the London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews and of the Home for Asiatics in London. He was also a member of the Royal Asiatic Society, in whose journal he published several pieces on Tamil philology and folklore. He frequently edited the <span class="italic">Wesleyan Missionary Notices</span>, as well as several individual missionary memoirs and histories.<br>
<br>Hoole died at his home, 8 Myddleton Square, Pentonville, London, on 17 June 1872, and was buried in Highgate cemetery on 22 June. His widow held office in the WMMS women's auxiliary until 1878; she died on 3 June 1880, aged seventy-four.<br>
