<span class="headword">Lemare,  Edwin Henry</span>  (1865&#150;1934), <span class="occ">organist and composer</span>, was born on 9 September 1865 in Ventnor, Isle of Wight, the son of Edwin Lemare, music teacher and organist, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wicker. He spent his boyhood on the island and was a chorister and organ pupil, under his father's direction, at Holy Trinity Church, Ventnor. Then, in 1876, he won a John Goss scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, where he studied for six years under George and Walter Macfarren and the organists Charles Steggall and Edmund Hart Turpin. In 1882 he was made organist at St John's Church, Finsbury Park, London. He first established a reputation as a concert organist at the International Inventions Exhibition at South Kensington in 1885; there he played works by Louis Lef&eacute;bure-W&eacute;ly, Alexandre Guilmant, Bach, and other composers twice daily for a total of over 100 recitals to demonstrate the new tubular-pneumatic action of the one-manual Brindley and Foster organ. This further led to his employment by competing organ-builders.<br>
<br>In 1886 Lemare began recitals twice a week at the Park Hall, Cardiff, and in the same year he was appointed organist at the parish church and the Albert Hall, Sheffield. In 1892 he returned to London, as organist of Holy Trinity, Sloane Street, and on 1 June he married Marian Broomhead Colton Fox (<i>b</i>. 1863/4), daughter of Barnard Platts Broomhead Colton Fox, solicitor. He also became an organ professor and examiner for the Associated Board of the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music. In 1897 he followed his vicar to St Margaret's, Westminster, where a new Walker instrument was installed.<br>
<br>Lemare's performances in the concert hall were by now leading to his being compared with virtuosi such as the pianists Ignacy Jan Paderewski and Leopold Godowsky. His reputation was heightened by his own organ compositions, among which he enjoyed particular success with <span class="italic">Andantino in D[flat]</span> (1892), which was also arranged for small orchestra by Gustav Holst. In 1900&#150;01 he made his first tour of the USA and Canada, sponsored by the organ manufacturer John Austin. The tour encompassed over 100 recitals and led to Lemare's becoming one of the Austin Organ Company's most ardent champions. His marriage meanwhile having failed, on 7 January 1902 he married Elsie Frances (<i>b</i>. 1876/7), daughter of David Reith, honorary canon of Rochester Cathedral. He seemingly also married again after he settled in the USA when he became organist of the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh from 1902 to 1905.<br>
<br>As time went on Lemare's recitals triumphed to the extent that he became the highest-paid organist in the world. Altogether tours took him across the Atlantic several dozen times and across the Pacific four times, his appearances in Melbourne and Sydney being noteworthy events. In 1908 he inaugurated the huge Hope-Jones pipe organ at Ocean Grove, New Jersey, and in 1915 he performed a series of 121 concerts on the Austin organ at the Panama-Pacific Exposition. When that instrument was relocated to San Francisco's Civic Auditorium in 1917, he became municipal organist there. He remained until 1921, when he took a similar post at City Hall in Portland, Maine, and later he was in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where in 1927 he designed an especially impressive Austin organ.<br>
<br>Lemare's virtuoso organ compositions embraced some 200 opus numbers. They included two symphonies, published in 1899 and 1906, a sonata, a toccata and fugue, and various services of thanksgiving. He also made transcriptions of a wide range of compositions, ranging from Handel's &#145;Largo&#146; and Schubert's <span class="italic">Serenade</span> to Tchaikovsky's <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> overture and Elgar's <span class="italic">Pomp and Circumstance</span> march no. 1, via Supp&eacute;'s <span class="italic">Poet and Peasant</span> overture and some Neapolitan songs. His transcriptions and performances of Wagner compositions were of especial note, originating a style of registering and organ-scoring that did much to develop organ tone qualities. He made some 120 player rolls for the Aeolian and Welte companies.<br>
<br>In 1925 Lemare's <span class="italic">Andantino in D[flat]</span> achieved renewed popularity when adapted by Ben Black and Neil Moret into the song &#145;Moonlight and Roses&#146;. However, even these royalties could not prevent him from declining into poverty when his health, fame, and technique began to fade. He died in Hollywood on 24 September 1934. In 1956 a volume of his memoirs, augmented by reminiscences by his wife and friends, was published in Los Angeles as <span class="italic">Organs I have Met</span>.<br>
