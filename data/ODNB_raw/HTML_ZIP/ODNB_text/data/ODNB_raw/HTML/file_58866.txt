<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Curtis,  Ian Kevin</span>  (1956&#150;1980), <span class="occ">musician</span>, was the only son and eldest child of Kevin Curtis, a detective officer in the Transport Commission police, and his wife, Doreen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hughes. He was born on 15 July 1956 in the Memorial Hospital, Old Trafford, Manchester. The family lived in Hurdsfield, on the outskirts of Macclesfield, and Curtis attended Trinity Square primary school, Macclesfield, Hurdsfield junior school, and, from 1967, the King's School, Macclesfield. When he was sixteen he met Deborah Woodruffe. They married at St Thomas's Church, Henbury, on 23 August 1975; their daughter, Natalie, was born on 16 April 1979.<br>
<br>Curtis early formed an ambition to make a career in music. In 1973 his family moved to New Moston, Manchester, and he soon ceased to attend the local college, preferring to work in a record shop and to attempt, unsuccessfully, to run his own second-hand record stall. In need of money, however, he began employment at a local office of the Ministry of Defence, transferring after a few months to the Manpower Services Commission and in 1977 to the employment exchange in Macclesfield. After a period living in Oldham, Curtis and his wife returned to Macclesfield, to 77 Barton Street, in May 1977.<br>
<br>Having never abandoned his ambition, in the spring of 1976 Curtis met Peter Hook, Bernard Sumner, and Terry Mason, three friends who allowed Curtis to join their incipient band as the singer. Although still learning to play their instruments, the band gave their first performance, under the name Warsaw, on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, Manchester. Stephen Morris became their drummer that summer. Their first appearance on vinyl followed that October, a single track on <span class="italic">Short Circuit</span>, a 10-inch compilation of upcoming Manchester bands. Now renamed Joy Division, the band cut their first record&#151;an EP called <span class="italic">An Ideal for Living</span>&#151;in December 1977. The new name, a reference to the group of female prisoners used by the Nazis as prostitutes for the army, raised eyebrows in the media throughout their career. Joy Division owed their first television appearance, performing &#145;Shadowplay&#146; on Granada Television's <span class="italic">Granada Reports</span> in September 1978, to its presenter, Tony Wilson. When Wilson started his influential Factory record label, the group contributed two tracks to its first offering, the EP <span class="italic">A Factory Sample</span>, released in January 1979.<br>
<br>On 27 December 1978 Curtis had his first recognizable epileptic fit, at a time when Joy Division's profile was rapidly rising, with their d&eacute;but London performance. At the end of January 1979 they recorded the first of their two sessions for the BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel. Their first album, <span class="italic">Unknown Pleasures</span>, appeared in June 1979, a happy collaboration with producer Martin Hannett (1950&#150;1991), who helped to establish Joy Division's trademark sound, giving prominence to Hook's lead guitar style of bass-playing, introducing then innovative effects on the drums, and making spare but effective use of new technology in the form of synthesizers and syndrums. Coupled with Curtis's low, sonorous voice, Joy Division's music evolved into one of intense, portentous rhythms and melodies that were, at their best, haunting. At the end of August 1979 Curtis left his civil service job, as Joy Division embarked on a national tour supporting the Buzzcocks. The single &#145;Transmission&#146; was released that October.<br>
<br>Epilepsy, continual performing, and drugs combined to exacerbate Curtis's volatile, often depressive, temperament. Guilt and emotional confusion may also have played a part. He had begun an affair with Annik Honor&eacute;, a Belgian he seems to have met first while performing in Brussels, and increasingly shunned his wife. Joy Division toured Europe in January 1980 and began preparations for an American tour later in the year. In March 1980 the band recorded their second album, <span class="italic">Closer</span>, and their most successful single, &#145;Love Will Tear Us Apart&#146;. By this time, some of Curtis's lyrics, plangent cries of depression and desperation, suggested a deepening blackness of mood. The pressures of performing were provoking more frequent epileptic fits. As Curtis continued his relationship with Annik Honor&eacute;, his wife began divorce proceedings. Returning briefly to the house that he had shared with her, 77 Barton Street, Macclesfield, in the early hours of Sunday 18 May 1980 Ian Curtis hanged himself. The previous evening he had watched Werner Herzog's <span class="italic">Stroszek</span>, a film about a man who kills himself rather than choose between two women. He was cremated at Macclesfield crematorium on 23 May 1980. His memorial stone, erected by his widow, bears the words &#145;Love Will Tear Us Apart&#146;.<br>
<br>Curtis's desire for the limelight was confessional. His stage performances displayed the contrasts in a character that was generally quiet and polite, yet capable of bouts of depression or anger. His manic dancing&#151;perhaps unwittingly parodizing his epileptic fits&#151;counterpointed his melancholic lyrics. Curtis helped Joy Division to capture a <i>Zeitgeist</i>. The group's presentation of itself was as brooding and enigmatic as their singer's own persona: their reluctance to give interviews suggested sullenness as often as it deepened their mystique; they deliberately omitted the names of their songs from the outside of their album covers, Peter Saville's monochrome designs for which spawned a thousand T-shirts; and their use of images of 1940s totalitarianism kicked against the comfortable, middle-class background from which Curtis, at least, had sprung. At the heart of the group's success, though, was a music that, while often dour, immediately appealed. While the remaining members of Joy Division gained continued if not greater success under their apt new name, New Order, Curtis's death triggered a long succession of cover versions of the group's songs: &#145;Love Will Tear Us Apart&#146; had been recorded by at least seventeen different artists by the end of the century, including P. J. Proby and Paul Young. More subtle, yet more profound, was an influence on many features&#151;from musicianship to style and demeanour&#151;of a host of groups that sprang up in the aftermath of the punk rock transformation of popular music. While Curtis's suicide, when on the brink of commercial success, seemed to mirror the deaths of other cult figures of late twentieth-century youth, such as Jim Morrison and Janis Joplin, the story of his life, uncovered in the biography <span class="italic">Touching from a Distance</span> by his widow, Deborah, tells of a deeply personal struggle of a timeless and tragic kind. Deborah Curtis's book also formed the basis for a biographical film, <span class="italic">Control</span> (2007), by Anton Corbijn.<br>
