<span class="headword">Dallas,  George</span>  (1878&#150;1961), <span class="occ">trade unionist and politician</span>, was born in Glasgow on 6 August 1878, the son of George Dallas, a shoemaker, and Mary Hay. He grew up in Kilmaurs, Ayrshire, and worked at a coalmine after leaving elementary school before resuming his formal education at the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College and, later, at the London School of Economics. His interest in politics began early, and he joined the Socialist League in Glasgow when he was sixteen. He worked briefly in London as a clerk for a coal merchant, and participated in pro-Boer demonstrations. On returning to Glasgow he became involved in the trade union movement, as district secretary for the shop assistants' union. For a time he ran his own men's outfitting shop in Motherwell. He stood as a socialist candidate in the municipal elections of 1907, and was organizing secretary for the Independent Labour Party in Scotland from 1908 to 1912. He was prominent in early attempts to organize factory girls in Scotland, in particular through exposing appalling working conditions in the dyeing industry and through his involvement in the strikes by thread-workers at Neilston in Renfrewshire in 1910. One of the strikers at Neilston, Agnes Brown (1888?&#150;1916), went on to become a trade union official and organizer for the Women's Labour League; she and Dallas were married in 1913.<br>
<br>Dallas left Scotland in 1912 to become chief organizer for the National Federation of Women Workers in London, but in the following year he went to work for the Workers' Union as organizer in London and the home counties. He assisted in a rapid expansion of membership before and during the First World War, being associated particularly with the union's organization of agricultural workers. He was appointed to the Agricultural Wages Board established under the legislation of 1917 and acted as secretary for the workers' representatives. His first wife died in 1916, and he married her younger sister, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1973), in 1920; they had two sons, Kenneth and Roland. Dallas was one of the first residents of Welwyn Garden City, where he moved in 1922, and he became a JP for Hertfordshire. He stood unsuccessfully for parliament as the Labour candidate for Maldon in 1918 and 1922, and for Roxborough and Selkirk in 1923. He was elected as MP for Wellingborough in 1929, but lost the seat in 1931 and never sat in parliament again; he narrowly failed to regain the Wellingborough seat in 1935 and was later selected as Labour's prospective candidate for Belper, but he gave it up before the general election of 1945.<br>
<br>Dallas had an active role within the Labour Party at a national level, notably in the party's rural campaigning in the 1920s and 1930s, and in developing its agricultural policy. He chaired Labour's advisory committee on agricultural and rural problems, and was one of the party's chief spokesmen on rural issues. He gained wide respect as an expert on the agricultural industry and served on the executive committee of the Agricultural Economics Society (1930&#150;37). He was a member of the 1919 royal commission on agriculture and signatory of the resulting minority report, and sat on the council of agriculture for England, which he chaired in 1933. In 1930 he was one of the major figures involved in non-party demonstrations to publicize the crisis in arable farming. He was a member of the national executive committee of the Labour Party from 1930 to 1944, vice-chairman in 1936&#150;7, and chairman in 1937&#150;9. He sat on the party's international sub-committee from 1931 (as chairman from 1940), and travelled abroad to attend conferences organized by European socialist parties in the 1930s.<br>
<br>Dallas settled in Northamptonshire in 1929 and was involved in local public life, helping to found the county's rural community council, chairing his local parish council at Great Doddington and sitting as a JP (from 1938). He was chairman of the River Nene catchment board throughout its existence (1930&#150;51), which contemporaries regarded as one of his most important contributions. During the Second World War he chaired the timber control board, overseeing the expansion of domestic timber production. He was appointed CBE in 1946. He was staunchly anti-communist, and in 1956 helped to found the Friends of Free China Association, of which he became president. He spent his last years in Bishop's Stortford, where he died in hospital on 4 January 1961; he was cremated three days later in Cambridge.<br>
