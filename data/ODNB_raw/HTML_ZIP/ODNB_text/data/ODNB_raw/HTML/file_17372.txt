<span class="headword">MacCaghwell,  Hugh</span> <span class="st"> [Hugo Cavellus, Aodh Mac Aingil]</span>  (1571?&#150;1626), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic archbishop of Armagh and theologian</span>, was born at Sall, co. Down. The names of his parents are unknown, but he was a member of a bardic family originally seated at Clogher in co. Tyrone, the name of his clan being generally Latinized as Cavellus. On reaching adulthood he went to the Isle of Man to study the classics and dialectics. By 1599 he was recalled to Ulster by Hugh O'Neill, earl of Tyrone, who appointed him tutor to his sons, Henry and Hugh. In 1600 Tyrone sent him and Henry to Spain, where they settled at Salamanca. There MacCaghwell attended a philosophy course at the university and joined the Franciscans in 1604. He may later have taught briefly theology at Salamanca. About 1606 he went to the Spanish Netherlands, having being appointed chief chaplain of the Irish regiment in Flanders in December 1605. There he became one of the leading figures in the local Irish &eacute;migr&eacute; community, part of the so-called northern clique. This highly influential group adopted a strongly anti-English line and effectively controlled the flow of patronage from the Spanish crown to the Irish exiles. MacCaghwell played a key role in securing the foundation of a college for Irish Franciscans at Louvain in 1607, becoming professor of theology and guardian of the college in the same year. Over the next seven years he successfully devoted himself to establishing the college on a firm financial basis, going on many fund-raising tours outside the Netherlands.<br>
<br>In 1613 MacCaghwell was approached by English agents who wanted to open negotiations with Tyrone, who had fled Ulster in 1607, for the earl's peaceful return to Ireland. Nothing came of this as the Spanish preferred to keep Tyrone and the English estranged. Generally, MacCaghwell stayed out of political matters, preferring to concentrate on his administrative duties and theological studies. In 1618 he published under his Irish name Aodh Mac Aingil <span class="italic">Sc&aacute;th&aacute;n shacramuinte na haithridhe</span> or &#145;A mirror of the sacrament of penance&#146;, a devotional work written in Irish. Although this acknowledged James I as the rightful ruler of Ireland, it also identified Ireland as a Catholic nation and demonstrates a very modern sense of national consciousness. Moreover, the work is a prominent example of how the literary language of contemporary Irish poets was used to produce a readable prose text. As a theologian MacCaghwell was held in high regard and specialized in the works of John Duns Scotus, whose doctrines he strongly defended. He published a number of theological tracts under his Latinized name Hugo Cavellus in the 1620s, including editions of a number of Scotus's works, which brought him a high reputation throughout Europe.<br>
<br>In 1620 MacCaghwell represented his province at the chapter-general of the Franciscans held in Spain. He was subsequently made definitor-general of the Franciscan order and spent most of 1622 in Paris, reforming the Parisian Franciscan convent. He was summoned in 1623 to Rome, where he read theology at the convent of Ara Coeli and was highly regarded by Pope Urban VIII. Partly through MacCaghwell's influence an Irish college was established at St Isidore's in Rome. When an election to the generalship of the Franciscan order was held in 1624 he was second in the poll. Subsequently, when the archbishopric of Armagh fell vacant with the death of Peter Lombard in 1625, John O'Neill, earl of Tyrone, Albert O'Donnell, earl of Tyrconnell, and Luke Wadding all strongly urged MacCaghwell's promotion to that see. He was consecrated on 7 June 1626 and immediately prepared to journey to Ireland. However, he fell ill suddenly and died of a fever at St Isidore's on 22 September 1626. A highly ascetic lifestyle combined with a delicate constitution contributed heavily to his death. He was buried in the church of St Isidore, where Tyrone had a monument placed over his grave. There is a fresco of him by Emmanuele di Como in the theological hall at St Isidore's College.<br>
