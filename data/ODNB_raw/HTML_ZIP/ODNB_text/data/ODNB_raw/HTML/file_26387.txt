<span class="headword">Stephens,  Jeremiah <span class="st"> [Jeremy]</span></span>  (1591&#150;1665), <span class="occ">scholar and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born and baptized on 17 October 1591 at Bishop's Castle, Shropshire, the eldest son of Walter Stephens (<i>b</i>. 1547, <i>d</i>. in or before 1630), the rector there. According to his will made in 1629 Walter Stephens was aged &#145;I think&#146; eighty-two, and had been rector of Bishop's Castle for fifty-two years. In his will he referred to his son Jeremy. Stephens entered Brasenose College, Oxford, on 29 March 1610, matriculating on 19 June, graduating BA on 1 July 1612, and proceeding MA on 3 May 1615. In December 1615 he was ordained deacon, and a year later he was ordained priest and appointed chaplain of All Souls College. He was presented to the rectory of Quinton, Northamptonshire, by Prince Charles, being installed on 24 January 1622. On 11 October 1624 he was made clerk of Oxford market. Charles I also presented him to the rectory of Wootton, Northamptonshire, where he was installed on 11 July 1626. Stephens proceeded BD on 11 November 1628, and was licensed to preach on 17 December 1628.<br>
<br>Stephens's first scholarly publication was <span class="italic">B. Gregorii Magni episcopi Romani, de cura pastorali liber vere aureus, accurate emendatus, et restitutus e vet. MSS cum Romana editione collatis</span> (1629). Two other works quickly followed, <span class="italic">Notae in D. Cyprian. de unitate ecclesiae</span> (1632), and <span class="italic">Notae in D. Cyprian. de bono patientiae</span> (1633). From 1632 Stephens was in regular contact with the ageing antiquarian Sir Henry Spelman, in effect acting as his assistant on Spelman's mammoth work, <span class="italic">Concilia</span>, the first part of which was published in 1639. Spelman paid tribute to Stephens in the preface as &#145;a man born for the public good, by whose assistance this my first volume comes out, and on whom the rest is founded&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Thomas Hearne concurred, describing Stephens as &#145;a complete scholar, and a great assistant to Sir Henry Spelman&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 2.33). In 1642 a son was born to Stephens and his wife, Mary.<br>
<br>Stephens's reward for his assistance to Spelman was to be nominated by Archbishop Laud (during the suspension of Bishop Williams) to a prebend of Lincoln. He was instituted on 3 July 1639, but was displaced by the previous incumbent, Lambert Osbaldeston, when the latter was pardoned by the king in May 1641. Stephens's troubles were increased on 16 June 1641 when a number of his Wootton parishioners petitioned the House of Lords complaining of his oppressions and praying for redress.<br>
<br>Stephens was sequestrated from his livings by a parliamentary committee sitting at Northampton in 1644. On 13 February 1645 he petitioned the House of Lords claiming that his prebend was the result of his labours with Spelman, and other antiquarian work in Oxford begun under Sir Thomas Bodley and Archbishop Abbott &#145;to compare exactly the Popish editions of the Fathers works with the old books and manuscripts remaining in all the libraries of the colleges&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>, 284).<br>
<br>Stephens was able to obtain one-fifth of the income from Wootton in March 1645 to maintain his wife. He also received &pound;10 p.a. from John, first Viscount Scudamore, a noted benefactor of Anglican clergymen. In 1647 Stephens was accused by his Wootton parishioners of trying to resign the living simoniacally, but their accusation was not pursued. Stephens published Spelman's <span class="italic">Tithes too Hot to be Touched</span> (1646), which subsequently appeared as <span class="italic">The Larger Treatise on Tithes</span> (1647). Stephens also edited Spelman's <span class="italic">Apologia pro tractatu de non temerandis</span> (1647), and his <span class="italic">Aspilogia</span> (1650).<br>
<br>The lord commissioners of the great seal appointed Stephens to Wootton on 30 April 1653, but &#145;the instrument stayed by order&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>, 285). Other polemical tracts by Stephens remained unpublished as they were overtaken by the Restoration, apart from <span class="italic">An Apology for the Ancient Right and Power of the Bishops to Sit and Vote in Parliaments</span> (1661). Stephens's rival at Wootton, Lemuel Franklin, remained in dispute over the living until after the Restoration. Stephens was restored to his livings in 1660; on 20 August 1660 he was collated to a prebend of Salisbury, being installed by proxy on 13 September, and collated again on 8 October 1662.<br>
<br>Stephens died at Wootton on 9 January 1665 and was buried there. An inventory of February 1665 revealed goods worth over &pound;300, including a study of books worth &pound;40. A sum of &pound;290 was paid to Anne Stephens (presumably his sister born in 1603) in 1670. His son, Robert, was rector of Wootton in 1667. His daughter, Frances, married Thomas Singleton, rector of Wootton, in 1681.<br>
