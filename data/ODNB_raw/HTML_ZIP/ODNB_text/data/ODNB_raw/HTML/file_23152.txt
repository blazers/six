<span class="headword">Rastrick,  John</span>  (1650&#150;1727), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, son of John Rastrige (<i>bap</i>. 1616?) and his wife, Afling, was born on 26 March 1650 at Heckington, Lincolnshire, where he was baptized the following day. His father was a yeoman and fellmonger. Rastrick was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated on 5 June 1667, graduated BA in 1671, and proceeded MA in 1674. In 1672 he was curate at Wyberton, Lincolnshire. Ordained priest on 25 May 1673, he became in 1674 the conscientious vicar of Kirton, near Boston, Lincolnshire, where he showed himself a clergyman of puritan stamp. The parish, which included Kirton Holme and Skeldyke, was &#145;four to five Miles in Length&#146;, and the congregation &#145;large&#146;; thus he felt &#145;a very sensible Concern&#146;  (Rastrick, <span class="italic">Account</span>, 3). Fearful of profaning the sacraments, he would not baptize illegitimate children until their parents demonstrated repentance; not all did so. Likewise he withheld communion from persons manifestly unprepared.<br>
<br>Eventually inquiries into Rastrick's practices led to his appearance, in April 1687, before the ecclesiastical court at Lincoln, charged with several irregularities, including not always wearing a surplice when required, and refusal to baptize. The court, however, disconcerted that day by James II's declaration of indulgence, required only a written defence forthwith; Rastrick supplied one, and heard no more. Nevertheless, uneasy with conformity, later that year, on 27 November, he took advantage of the declaration to resign his incumbency, intending to resume office in the church should its long-discontinued protestantization recommence. He preached as a nonconformist from February 1688. He recorded that &#145;The sober Dissenters&#146; of Spalding invited him to become minister there, to counter &#145;the Quakers and Arminianiz'd Anabaptists &hellip; [who] grew so much there they were like to carry all before them&#146;; and he added that he had seen his role as to withstand this &#145;Sectarian Spirit&#146;: &#145;For were it not better to keep the people in a posture of Readiness to return to the Communion of the Church of England whensoever Providence should by a Reformation make way for it&#146;  (BL, Rastrick, <span class="italic">Account</span>, 1705, 38, marginalia). For himself, the failure of the comprehension schemes of William III's ecclesiastical commission was to make the chances of such a return seem hopeless. Rastrick ministered at Spalding for nine years from Lady day 1688, and then at Rotherham. From 1701 until his death he was Presbyterian pastor at Spinner Lane, King's Lynn, Norfolk, initially as colleague to Anthony Williamson. In the account of his nonconformity, which he wrote at the request of Edmund Calamy, first published in 1705, Rastrick stressed how he had &#145;a high Value, Honour and Reverence for able worthy Men of either Way&#146;, conformist or dissenter:<blockquote>Tho' I exceedingly disgusted some of the Dissenters thereby, as I had done some on the Church side before. So that I often thought and said, (as the state of things is in <i>England</i>) that I was neither fit for Church nor Meeting. But who can help it? (Rastrick, <span class="italic">Account</span>, 37)</blockquote>Of the numerous children of Rastrick's marriages, only those who survived to be mentioned in his or his third wife's last wills (1725 and 1733 respectively) are listed here. Rastrick married on 25 June 1672 at Wyberton, where he was curate, Jane Wilson (<i>d</i>. 1684): their daughter Elizabeth became the wife of Edmund Burton of Wisbech  (Norfolk RO, will of John Rastrick, 1725); the Rastricks' sons were John, a &#145;Stocking-weaver&#146;, &#145;now or late in Carolina&#146;  (ibid.), and Samuel, a London silk-dyer  (ibid.). &#145;A narrative, or, An historicall account of the most materiall passages in the life of John Rastrick&#146; (Huntington Library, HM 6131) portrays Rastrick's marriage to Jane and the depression from which she suffered. He married Mary Harrison (<i>d</i>. 1687&times;92), a widow, on 26 March 1685. On 1 September 1692 at Moulton, near Spalding, he married Elizabeth Horn (<i>d</i>. 1740), whose will shows she was a cousin and legatee of Lynn grammar school's distinguished master John Horn or Horne, son of the Arminian founder of Lynn's Presbyterian interest, John Horne (1614&#150;1676). Their children included daughters and son, William (<i>d</i>. 1752), the Lynn preacher and savant (Norfolk RO, will of John Rastrick, 1725; will of Elizabeth Rastrick, 1733).<br>
<br>Rastrick was moderate and eirenic, a figure in the Baxterian tradition. At Kirton he redeemed, and restored to their owners, goods distrained in persecution from earnest Baptists. Through preaching during a vacancy in 1699 at Mill Hill Chapel, Leeds, he met the antiquary Ralph Thoresby, who noted that in religious discussions Rastrick stressed only &#145;the essentials of religion, wherein all are agreed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 1.332). In 1714 Rastrick enunciated a middle way belief that two ostensibly opposed doctrines, namely of special election and of general grace available to all, must be held simultaneously  (Rastrick, <span class="italic">Sermon</span>, 68). Yet, at Lynn, he experienced hostility. His congregation once included a party that angrily rejected the discipline he had carefully explained, and locked him out of the chapel  (ibid., iv). A continuing hyper-Calvinistic faction maintained that the elect, sure of salvation, need not keep God's moral laws. About 1720 Rastrick digested his teaching, given at Lynn and elsewhere, against this modish antinomianism into a book-length manuscript, &#145;Plain and easy principles of Christian religion and obedience&#146;. Acquired by William Richards (1749&#150;1818), whose <span class="italic">History of Lynn</span> (1812) describes it (2.1058&#150;62), it disappeared after Richards's executors ignored their duty to send the latter's manuscripts to Brown University, Rhode Island. Its appendix treated of a sub-Athanasian Christology apparently like that of James Peirce (1674?&#150;1726), which Rastrick had come to favour after studies that the Salters' Hall clash over the Trinity (1719) had prompted him to make. The same appendix contained his theory concerning comets (which resembled that of Cotton Mather); these he considered former worlds, ablaze through divine judgment, their impenitent populations having rejected their respective saviours&#151;Christ, in Rastrick's belief, was earth's saviour only. Rastrick's ode &#145;The Dissolution&#146; portrays deserted earth's consumption by eschatological fire. Richards's recension in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1st ser., 59, 1789, 1033&#150;4) seems full; the version in his <span class="italic">History of Lynn</span> (2.1065&#150;6) omits six lines; John Evans's in <span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; William Richards</span> (1819, 160&#150;63), again full, is faulty, but he preserves another poem  (p. 163). Other works Rastrick left in manuscript have been lost.<br>
<br>Indubitably Rastrick's mind was lively and cultivated. His will mentions his books, manuscripts, mathematical instruments, telescopes, double barometer, and &#145;picture done by Deconing&#146; (De Koninck?)&#151;he collected pictures. His intelligence, like his goodness, impressed Ralph Thoresby, to whom he sent archaeological information, coins, and astroites. His letter to Hans Sloane about the discovery of Roman coins at Fleet, near Spalding, a communication echoed in Edmund Gibson's later editions (1722, 1772) of William Camden's <span class="italic">Britannia</span>, appeared anonymously in the Royal Society's <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> (23, 1702, 1156&#150;8); the same volume (pp. 1158&#150;60) carried Thoresby's letter quoting, still unattributed, Rastrick's account of discoveries at Spalding (later amended by Thoresby, 32, 1723, 344&#150;6).<br>
<br>William Rastrick's holograph <span class="italic">Index</span> (1734) records that John Rastrick died on 18 August 1727, aged seventy-seven (probably at his home in Spinner Lane, King's Lynn). He was buried on 21 August in Lynn's medieval St Nicholas's Chapel.<br>
