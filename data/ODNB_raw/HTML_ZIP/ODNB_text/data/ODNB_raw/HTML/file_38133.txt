<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Williams,  Thomas</span>  (1737&#150;1802), <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, was born on 13 May 1737, the eldest of the five sons (there were no daughters) of Owen Williams of Cefn-coch in Llansadwrn in Anglesey, and his wife, Jane, daughter of Thomas Lloyd of Hendre Hywel. He was put to the law, training as an attorney, and his brother John went into the church, indicating a family of means. Williams married Catherine, daughter of John Lloyd of Llanfihangel Tre'r-beirdd, about 1763. They had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Williams's early career in Anglesey was remarkably successful; he acted as attorney and man of business for important local families, especially for Sir Nicholas Bayly, for whom he was also political agent. In 1761 copper mines had been opened on Bayly's lands at Parys Mountain near Amlwch, but significant progress was only made from 1768, when a mass of easily worked copper was located which was soon worked under lease by Charles Roe &amp; Co. of Macclesfield. A major lawsuit arose over part of the mineral area jointly owned by Bayly and by a lesser gentry family, whose entail devolved on the Revd Edward Hughes's infant son (later first Baron Dinorben). Williams represented the lesser family against Bayly, and his legal skill and tenacity were influential in obtaining a favourable chancery decision. Bayly's part of the jointly owned mine was by 1778 leased to a partnership of the Revd Edward Hughes (a &#145;sleeping&#146; partner), Williams, and the London banker and East India director, John Dawes. From the outset Williams dominated.<br>
<br>The full extraction of profits from the mine was hampered by the existence in the copper industry of a most powerful cartel, the Associated Smelters, who had controlled prices and profits and dominated the mining interest of Cornwall, the main copper-producing area, for decades. Williams broke the hold of the cartel by founding his own smelting, manufacturing, and sales establishment, with smelters at Middle Bank in south Wales and Ravenhead in Lancashire and powerful rolling mills and battery plant at Holywell in north Wales. In the early 1780s Birmingham experts working for him solved the problem of making hard cold-rolled copper bolts, and this patented invention in turn solved the problem of galvanic action in copper-sheathed ships which were iron-fastened. A great threatened market was thereby secured. The capture of the huge East India contract signalled Williams's market success over the cartel, just as Sir Nicholas Bayly's successor, Henry Paget, first earl of Uxbridge (father of the first marquess of Anglesey), decided to exploit the mines originally discovered with Williams as managing partner, thus giving the lawyer management of all the Anglesey mines.<br>
<br>Oppressed by the low ore prices given by the Associated Smelters, the Cornish copper mines, led by John Vivian, with the assistance of Matthew Boulton and John Wilkinson (concerned for the steam-engine market at the mines), revolted against the smelters' power and founded the Cornish Metal Company, a cartel to purchase, arrange for smelting, and sell all the smelted ores of Cornwall. To avoid competition with Anglesey an agreement was signed between the company and the Anglesey companies on prices and a division of markets. Thus 1785 saw a revolution in the copper trade. By 1787 the Cornish Metal Company was virtually insolvent, due to gross business inefficiency, and Williams effectively took it over, controlling it until its articles of agreement expired in 1792. For five years he consequently exercised a remarkable monopoly of the national copper market. Declining mine output in Anglesey, opposition by Birmingham consumers, and an improving international copper market prevented the monopoly persisting, but Williams continued to influence the industry strongly until his death, and his activities were looked at by the select committee on the copper trade of 1799. At that time he admitted controlling an industrial capital of &pound;800,000. In business terms his power was greater than any of the other industrialists of the period.<br>
<br>Apart from the two Anglesey mining companies, their subsidiaries and branches, including a sulphuric-acid plant, he directly owned factories on the Thames, founded again with the Revd Edward Hughes as sleeping partner, and the Chester and North Wales Bank. He also operated a small fleet of ships, issued the largest and arguably the finest British token coinage, purchased the two-member pocket borough of Great Marlow, for which he was MP from 1790, and built there Temple House, designed by Samuel Wyatt. Williams died on 29 November 1802 in Bath, worth about half a million pounds.<br>
