<span class="headword">Caus <span class="st"> [Caux]</span>,  Isaac  de</span>  (1589/90&#150;1648), <span class="occ">garden designer and architect</span>, was born in Dieppe. He was a relative (possibly a nephew) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7407/', "Salomon de Caus")</script>, and was, like him, a Huguenot. The date of his arrival in England is not known, but he was in the country by the early 1620s, and was naturalized in 1634.<br>
<br>Like Salomon, Isaac de Caus specialized in the design and construction of grottoes and waterworks. His earliest recorded work in England was the grotto in the basement of the Banqueting House in Whitehall, recently built to the designs of Inigo Jones, which he made in 1623&#150;4. His most celebrated work of this kind was the grotto at Wilton House in Wiltshire, where it formed part of an elaborate formal garden designed by de Caus for the fourth earl of Pembroke in 1632&#150;5. This, &#145;the greatest of English Renaissance gardens&#146;  (Strong, 151), featured statues and fountains set in parterres of <i>broderie</i>, flanked by arbours. The grotto was entered through a classical fa&ccedil;ade at the far end of the garden and contained spouting sea monsters, a table with hidden jets to wet the unwary, and hydraulically simulated birdsong. The whole was illustrated in a set of engravings published by de Caus entitled <span class="italic">Wilton Garden</span> (undated). He was also the author of a book entitled <span class="italic">Nouvelle invention de lever l'eau plus hault que sa source avec quelques machines mouvantes par le moyen de l'eau</span> (1644). This was closely based on the treatise <span class="italic">Les raisons des forces mouvantes</span>, published by Salomon de Caus in 1615, from which most of the copperplates were taken. An English translation was published in 1659 as <span class="italic">New and Rare Inventions of Water-Works</span>.<br>
<br>As an architect de Caus was involved in the fourth earl of Bedford's development on his Covent Garden estate in London (1631 onwards). Although Inigo Jones was responsible for the general scheme, there is evidence that de Caus supervised the building of some of the houses, and he himself lived in one of them for a time. At Wilton House the names of Inigo Jones and Isaac de Caus again appear together in connection with the rebuilding of the south front in 1636&#150;40.<br>
<br>According to John Aubrey, this was to have been designed by Jones, but:<blockquote>having at that time &hellip; engaged in his Majesties buildings at Greenwich, [he] could not attend to it: but he recommended it to an ingeniouse architect Monsieur &hellip; de Caus, &hellip; who performed it very well: but not without the advice and approbation of Mr. Jones. (J. Aubrey, <span class="italic">The Natural History of Wiltshire</span>, ed. J. Britton, 1847, 83&#150;4)</blockquote>That de Caus was in charge at Wilton is confirmed by documentary evidence, but precisely how the responsibility for the design of this celebrated building should be apportioned between Jones and de Caus is a problem to which the surviving evidence does not provide a categorical answer. Only one other building is known to have been designed by de Caus: an addition, long demolished without record, to Stalbridge Park, Dorset, for the first earl of Cork.<br>
<br>Isaac de Caus died in Paris, and was buried on 24 February 1648 in the Huguenot cemetery there. He was described in the register as &#145;Isaac de Caus, natif de Dieppe, ag&eacute; de 58 ans, architeque&#146;. His return to France may have been because of the civil war in England, but his family appears to have remained in London, for in July 1655 the will of Mary de Caus, widow, the lessee of a tenement on the Bedford estate in London, was proved by her elder son, Isaac. Other children mentioned in the will were Peter, Mary, and Magdalen.<br>
