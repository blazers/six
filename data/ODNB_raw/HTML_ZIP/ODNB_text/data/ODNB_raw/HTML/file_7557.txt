<span class="headword">Dethick, Sir  Gilbert</span>  (1499/1500&#150;1584), <span class="occ">herald and diplomat</span>, was the grandson of Robert Derrick (<i>d</i>. 1525) of the king's armoury at Greenwich, a German armourer brought to England by Erasmus Kyrkener, and Agatha, daughter of Matthis Leyendecker, a barber of Aachen. His grandparents had three sons, Derick, Gilbert, and Matthew. The latter two were made denizens by act of parliament in 1542&#150;3, making the unlikely claim that their father had been born in England and was descended from the Dethicks of Dethick Hall, Derbyshire, whose arms they used. Matthew Dethick (<i>d</i>. 1572) became an armourer at Greenwich; his brother Gilbert married the daughter of Leonard, a Dutch shoemaker at the sign of the Red Cock, St Martin's Lane, and had children who included Gilbert, the future herald, and Matthew, who was buried in York Minster in August 1583.<br>
<br>The younger Gilbert Dethick became Hampnes pursuivant-extraordinary on 16 June 1536 and rose rapidly, becoming Rouge Croix pursuivant in December 1540, Richmond herald on Christmas day 1540, and Norroy king of arms by patent dated 16 August 1547. He accompanied Lord Protector Somerset on his expedition against the Scots the same year, and was nearly shot by the Scots at the siege of Musselburgh. In 1549 he was sent to demand the surrender of the rebels in Kent, Essex, Suffolk, and Norfolk. There is a story that he stood at the &#145;tree of pardon&#146; in Norwich and announced a free pardon to the rebels if they would disperse, and that he narrowly escaped being hanged by their leader, Robert Kett, although it has also been claimed that the herald concerned was York herald, not Dethick. Dethick became Garter king of arms on 20 April 1550 and was knighted on 14 April 1551.<br>
<br>Dethick was popular with his sovereigns. Henry VIII gave him a house and an acre of land in Poplar, where his family remained for 200 years, and he regularly exchanged new year presents with Elizabeth I. He invested Philip II of Spain, consort of Queen Mary; Emanuele-Philiberto, duke of Savoy; Frederick II of Denmark; Adolphus, duke of Holstein; Charles IX of France; Fran&ccedil;ois, duke of Montmorency; Johann Casimir, the son of the elector palatine of the Rhine; the duke of Bavaria; the earl of Rutland; and Henry, Lord Scrope of Bolton, with the Garter, and assisted in the investitures of Henri II of France, of which he wrote an account  (Harl. MS 1355, art. 6), and of Emperor Maximilian II at Vienna. The latter expedition, made with the earl of Sussex in 1568, was followed by a tour of Carinthia with Archduke Karl. Dethick proclaimed several declarations of peace and war and, because he knew German and Dutch, was also sent on diplomatic expeditions, fulfilling the role of an effective rather than of a purely ceremonial envoy. Henry VIII sent him several times to Denmark to claim ships, and he is alleged to have attended the diet of Regensburg in 1546. He was involved in negotiations for three marriages for Edward VI, with a Cleves princess, Mary, queen of Scots, and Elisabeth de Valois of France. In 1554 he went on an embassy to Flanders.<br>
<br>When Dethick became Garter the heralds were still without a base, so from 1554 they met at Dethick's house in Poplar. In 1555 he secured the grant of a house occupied by Sir Richard Sackville in Derby Place, Sts Benet and Peter, from Queen Mary. Sackville left eleven years later, and the heralds moved into what became the College of Arms on 25 January 1565. Dethick complained that he was allotted only four rooms. As Garter he made over 140 grants of arms, and forty more in conjunction with the provincial kings of arms. Collections of his work survive at the British Library and Gonville and Caius College, particularly BL, Harley MS 5826, Add. MS 10110, and &#145;Dethickes guiftes&#146; (his grants and confirmations, 1549&#150;84), Add. MS 12454 (see too Harley MS 5847). He trained several heralds, including Nicholas Paddy, Lancaster, and Hugh Cotgrave, Richmond, who began their careers as his servants, and also his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7558/', "William Dethick")</script>. Dethick was a sound genealogist and heraldist, and a member of the original Society of Antiquaries.<br>
<br>A handsome man, Dethick married twice. His first wife was Alice, daughter of Leonard Peterson, a Dutchman. They had three sons: Nicholas (1539&#150;1596), later Windsor herald; William (1543&#150;1612); and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71043/', "Henry Dethick")</script>, who became chancellor of the diocese of Carlisle, and whose son Henry (1623&#150;1707) became Richmond herald. Alice died on 13 January 1572, and Dethick was remarried; his new wife was Jane, daughter of Richard Duncomb of Moreton, Buckinghamshire, the widow of William Naylor. They had further children: Robert (<i>b</i>. 1561, <i>d</i>. before 1583), godson to Elizabeth I; and Mary, to whom her father bequeathed &pound;500, and who married Thomas Butler, barrister, of Orwell, Cambridgeshire. Dethick died in London on 3 October 1584 and was buried in the church of St Benet Paul's Wharf; he was survived by his second wife. He is commemorated on his son's memorial in St Paul's Cathedral, which states that he died aged eighty-four.<br>
