<span class="headword">Knatchbull, Sir  Edward</span>, ninth baronet  (1781&#150;1849), <span class="occ">politician</span>, eldest son of Sir Edward Knatchbull of Mersham Hatch, Kent, eighth baronet, and Mary, daughter and coheir of William Western Hugessen of Provender in the same county, was born on 20 December 1781. He was educated at Winchester College 1794&#150;9, matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, in 1800, and enrolled at Lincoln's Inn in 1803. He was receiver-general for Kent 1814&#150;19, resigning, following his father's death and his succession to the baronetcy on 21 September 1819, so as to occupy his father's seat as member for Kent. He held the seat from November 1819 until 1830, when he did not stand for re-election. He was a strong opponent of corn-law reform and of Catholic emancipation, on 12 February 1829 stinging Peel to ill temper in the Commons by his taunts of inconsistency on the Catholic question. He became a prominent figure among the ultra-tories. His amendment on distress in February 1830 was only defeated by whigs coming to the aid of Wellington's government. In November 1830 Knatchbull and Sir Richard Vyvyan engineered the downfall of Wellington's government by giving the ultra vote in support of Sir Henry Parnell's retrenchment motion. Like other ultras, Knatchbull favoured moderate political reform, especially if it stopped the rick burning caused by the Swing riots in Kent. But, unlike some of his ultra colleagues, he refused Lord Grey's offer of office when the whig government was formed. He subsequently promoted, without success, a resolution in favour of moderate reform if the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> of 1831 was defeated on second reading (on which Knatchbull paired).<br>
<br>In 1832 Knatchbull was elected for East Kent, representing it until 1845, when he retired. Much though he distrusted Peel, he was his paymaster-general, in the cabinet, in 1834 and again in 1841. His opposition in cabinet to the 1842 budget was unsuccessful and he had little enthusiasm for the political direction of Peel's government. The death of his favourite child, Fanny Elizabeth, in February 1845 confirmed a decision to retire adumbrated earlier; he resigned office on 15 February.<br>
<br>Knatchbull's domestic life was no happier than his political. He married, on 25 August 1806, Annabella Christiana, daughter of Sir John Honywood, bt. She died on 4 April 1814 after bearing five sons and a daughter, Mary. He married, secondly, on 24 October 1820, Fanny Catherine, eldest daughter of Edward Knight of Godmersham Park, Kent. They had five sons and four daughters. Three of his sons from his first marriage died young, his daughter Mary eloped, and he disinherited his eldest son, Norton Joseph, because of the extravagant behaviour of his wife, Mary. He altered his will in favour of Edward Knatchbull [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15704/', "Hugessen, Edward, first Baron Brabourne")</script>], his eldest son from his second marriage, with the proviso that he take the name Hugessen on inheriting, which he did.<br>
<br>Knatchbull was neither as ultra-protestant nor as protectionist as his record suggests. He had a knack of muddling into political crises and finding himself leader of a following he did not wholeheartedly represent. He died on 24 May 1849.<br>
