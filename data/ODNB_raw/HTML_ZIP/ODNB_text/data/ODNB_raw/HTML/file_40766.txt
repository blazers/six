<span class="headword">Ewart,  Peter</span>  (1767&#150;1842), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, was born on 14 May 1767 at Troqueer Manse, near Dumfries, the son of the Revd John Ewart, minister in Troqueer parish and his wife, Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Corrie). He was the ninth of eleven brothers and sisters, some of whom also had distinguished careers. His eldest brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9010/', "Joseph Ewart")</script>, who became a diplomat; and his brother William was a merchant and partner of John Gladstone (father of W. E. Gladstone) in Liverpool.<br>
<br>After early education at a local school, Ewart at the age of fifteen attended lectures at Edinburgh University, where his cousin John Robison (1739&#150;1805) was professor of natural philosophy. (It was this connection that later commended him to James Watt.) At about the same time he was apprenticed to John Rennie (1761&#150;1821), then a millwright in Haddingtonshire. In 1784 Rennie, when commissioned by Watt to help with the erection of the Albion Mills, Blackfriars, took Ewart with him to London. Four years later Ewart was at work on a water-wheel for Matthew Boulton's rolling mill in Birmingham. At this time markets for Watt's rotative steam engine were opening up in the growing cotton and woollen textile industries; and in 1789 Boulton and Watt sent Ewart to Manchester to erect a Watt engine for Peter Drinkwater. In 1790 Ewart became Boulton and Watt's northern area representative. This brought him into contact with other leaders of the industrial revolution, such as George Lee (who married his youngest sister, Mary Ewart), Benjamin Gott, Samuel Oldknow, and William Strutt.<br>
<br>The problems of dealing with unreliable component suppliers were so frustrating that, in 1792, Ewart resigned as area representative and went into partnership with Oldknow as a cotton spinner. When Oldknow's enterprise failed, Ewart found, in 1793, a new partner in Samuel Greg, of Quarry Bank Mill, Styal, near Manchester. Here he improved the water power resource by building a masonry dam on the River Bollin and this work, together with the mill, is now maintained by the National Trust. At Styal, Ewart may well have made a significant contribution to the development of water power and the design of water-wheels, and in addition he installed a Boulton and Watt engine, as a standby power source.<br>
<br>The Greg partnership ended in 1811, when Ewart concentrated his efforts on his own mill in Manchester. The extent to which this move was due to a new and quite different interest can only be conjectured. He had joined the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society in 1798; in 1812 he became, with John Dalton, a vice-president of the society. His wide experience of steam and water power on the one hand and his knowledge of mathematics and natural philosophy on the other made him unusually well qualified to pronounce on the vexed questions of power, force, and work, still veiled in confusion. An attack, probably by John Playfair, in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> (12, 1808, 120&#150;130) on W. H. Wollaston's Bakerian lecture, and on John Smeaton's experiments between 1759 and 1782, was the occasion for the longest (153 pages) and most important of the four papers Ewart published, &#145;On the measure of moving force&#146; (1813). This was a sustained plea that British mathematicians and natural philosophers should take account of the concept of &#145;living force&#146; or <i>vis viva</i> and the related measure of work (force times distance), advocated strongly by Smeaton, supported by Wollaston, and used by most engineers.<br>
<br>The received doctrine that momentum (mv) is the true measure of the force was supported by the fact that momentum is conserved when inelastic bodies collide, while <i>vis viva</i> (mv<sup>2</sup>) is apparently not conserved. Ewart, following Smeaton, argued that the apparent loss of <i>vis viva</i> was accounted for by the &#145;change of figure&#146; of the colliding bodies. And, having countered the theoretical objections to <i>vis viva</i>, he pointed out that a wide range of manufacturing processes depend on &#145;change of figure&#146; and that the losses entailed can be accurately calculated. The received doctrine cannot account for &#145;change of figure&#146;. An insight, in the paper, was his assertion, contrary to the Edinburgh critic, that to a given quantity of heat, used in a steam engine, there must correspond a fixed amount of work. Ewart knew, of course, that in all practical engines the full amount of work could never be realized. He did not, however, recognize that heat could be converted into work.<br>
<br>This was the longest paper yet published, and for a long time to come, in the Manchester <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>. Ewart acknowledged John Dalton's support and &#145;candid encouragement&#146; in writing it and it may be assumed that Dalton had advocated publication in its entirety. Moreover, Dalton dedicated the first part of volume 2 of his <span class="italic">New System of Chemical Philosophy</span> (1827) jointly to Ewart as a friend and &#145;for the able exposition and excellent illustrations of the Fundamental Principles of Mechanics in his essay on the measure of moving force&#146;. James Watt, and his son James Watt Junior, seem to have approved of the work too. Apart from its originality, in the British context, and the knowledge of continental ideas that it revealed, the paper is of some significance as a distinctive contribution to the new, Manchester, school of science; and James Prescott Joule, a loyal pupil of Dalton, established his comprehensive ideas on energy and the mechanical theory of heat on the basis of the doctrines of <i>vis viva</i> and the related &#145;measure of moving force&#146;.<br>
<br>Ewart left Manchester in 1835, when he was appointed the first chief engineer and inspector of machinery for the navy's steam ships. He died on 15 September 1842, as a result of an accident in Woolwich Dockyard, when a chain carrying a very heavy load suddenly snapped. It is not known whether his wife, formerly Miss Kerr, whom he had married in 1802, survived him.<br>
