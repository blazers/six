<span class="headword">Wellsted,  James Raymond</span>  (1805&#150;1842), <span class="occ">surveyor and traveller</span>, was in 1828&#150;9 secretary to Sir Charles Malcolm, superintendent of the Bombay marine. In 1830 he was appointed second-lieutenant of the East India Company's ship <i>Palinurus</i>, then engaged, under Captain Moresby, in making a detailed survey of the Gulf of &#145;Aqabah and the northern part of the Red Sea. She returned to Bombay early in 1833, and was then sent, under the command of Captain Haines, to survey the southern coast of Arabia, Wellsted being still her second-lieutenant. In January 1834 she crossed over to Socotra, and on the 10th anchored in the Bay of Tamarida. Wellsted spent the following two months travelling in the island, returning to his ship on 7 March. He published the results of his journey as &#145;Memoir on the island of Socotra&#146; (<span class="italic">JRGS</span>, 5, 1835, 129).<br>
<br>In November 1835 Wellsted had permission to travel in Oman, and went to Muscat on the 21st with Lieutenant F. Whitelock, also of the Indian navy. The imam gave them every assistance in his power, but their fever and the disturbed state of the country curtailed their plans. None the less, the two reached areas which no European had previously seen and which were not visited again by Europeans for another hundred years. Wellsted published preliminary results of this journey in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Geographical Society</span> (7, 1837, 102).<br>
<br>Wellsted seems to have made another attempt to explore Oman in the following winter, and to have arrived at Muscat in April 1837 in an acute stage of fever. &#145;In a fit of delirium he discharged both barrels of his gun into his mouth, but the balls, passing upwards, only inflicted two ghastly wounds in the upper jaw&#146;. He was carried to Bombay, and thence returned to Europe on leave. He retired from the service in 1839, &#145;and dragged on a few years in shattered health and with impaired mental powers, chiefly residing in France&#146;  (Low, 2.85&#150;6). He died on 25 October 1842 at his father's house in Molineux Street, London, aged thirty-seven.<br>
<br>Wellsted's papers read before the Royal Geographical Society procured him immediate recognition in the scientific world, and he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 6 April 1837. He was also a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society. As well as writing several scientific papers, he was the author of <span class="italic">Travels in Arabia</span> (2 vols., 1838) and <span class="italic">Travels to the City of the Caliphs</span> (2 vols., 1840), an account of the travels of his friend Lieutenant Ormsby. Wellsted was an acute observer and not blinded by prejudice or ignorance in his description of the local people. His accounts of the geography of Oman, particularly the irrigation systems and the way of life in remote mountain tracts, continue to be important as a unique description of the country at an early date.<br>
