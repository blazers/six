<span class="headword">Boxer,  Edward</span>  (1784&#150;1855), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Dover. He entered the navy in July 1798, and after eight years' junior service, mostly with Captain Charles Brisbane, and for some short time in the <i>Ocean</i>, bearing Lord Collingwood's flag, was confirmed, on 8 June 1807, as lieutenant of the <i>Tigre</i> with Captain Benjamin Hallowell (afterwards Carew). On his promotion to flag rank in October 1811, he followed Hallowell to Malta, and continued, with short intermissions, under his immediate command, until he was confirmed as commander on 1 March 1815. In 1822 he commanded the <i>Sparrowhawk</i> (18 guns) on the Halifax station, and was posted out of her on 23 June 1823. From 1827 to 1830 he commanded the <i>Hussar</i> as flag captain to Sir Charles Ogle at Halifax. In August 1837 he was appointed to the <i>Pique</i>, which he commanded on the North American and West Indian stations; and early in 1840 was sent to the Mediterranean, where he conducted the survey of the position afterwards occupied by the fleet off Acre and took part in the bombardment and capture of Acre in November. For his services he received the Turkish gold medal, and was made CB on 18 December 1840.<br>
<br>In August 1843 Boxer was appointed harbour-master at Quebec, and held that office until his promotion to flag rank, on 5 March 1853. In April 1854 he became port-admiral at Constantinople. Here he was responsible for collecting the boats used for the invasion of the Crimea, and was thereafter responsible for logistics and principal agent for transports. In December he undertook the special duties of superintendent at Balaklava, which the crowded shipping, the narrow limits of the harbour, and the complete lack of wharves and roads had reduced to a state of disastrous confusion. This, and more especially the 6 mile sea of mud between the harbour and the camp, gave rise to terrible suffering and loss. While many blamed the admiral-superintendent at Balaklava, he was in fact responsible for bringing order to the chaos, but despite this he was used as a scapegoat by the Admiralty, and even his commander-in-chief. In truth he ought to be remembered rather as the man who, at the cost of his life, remedied the evils which had given rise to such loss. He died of cholera on board the <i>Jason</i>, just outside the harbour, on 4 June 1855, and Lord Raglan in reporting his death wrote that he had worked very hard, in all weathers, and had rendered an essential service to the army by improving the landing-places and establishing wharves on the west side of the port, accelerating the disembarkation of stores and troops and improving communications with the shore. His wife had died on 25 January 1826, nearly thirty years before; he was survived by a numerous family.<br>
<br>Boxer &#145;was an able officer, placed in charge of something beyond the talent of any man to organise quickly&#146;  (Lambert, 212). After the war he was posthumously decorated.<br>
