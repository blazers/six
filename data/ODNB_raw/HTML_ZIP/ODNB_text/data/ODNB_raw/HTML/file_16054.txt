</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lankester,  Edwin</span>  (1814&#150;1874), <span class="occ">public health reformer and natural historian</span>, was born on 23 April 1814 at Melton, near Woodbridge, Suffolk. His father, William Lankester (1791&#150;1818), was a builder who died of tuberculosis at the age of twenty-seven leaving his widow, Susan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Taylor, his four-year old son Edwin, and possibly a younger daughter. Injudicious use of William's small estate left the family poor, and Edwin's schooling at local establishments ceased when he was barely twelve years old; in 1826 his mother became landlady of the Royal Oak inn, Woodbridge. Edwin was then articled to Samuel Gissing, surgeon, of Woodbridge, until 1832. After enduring two brief and unsatisfactory assistantships in Hampshire and London he became, in 1833, assistant to Thomas Spurgeon of Saffron Walden, Essex, who took pleasure in furthering the education of his employees. He gave Lankester the use of his library and helped him in his study of the classics. Lankester also became secretary of the local natural history society and curator of the town museum.<br>
<br>Friends then lent Lankester &pound;300 to support him through a medical course at the newly opened University of London, where he studied from 1834 until he qualified as MRCS and licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries in 1837. During that time he became president of the college medical society, published his first medical paper, and won the Lindley silver medal for botany. (In 1846 John Lindley would name a newly discovered tropical plant, <i>Lankesteria parviflora</i>, after his former pupil.) Through Lindley, Lankester obtained the post of resident medical attendant and science tutor to the family of Charles Wood of Campsall Hall, near Doncaster, where, with his colleague Dr Leonard Schmitz and his two pupils, he was able to broaden his own scientific knowledge while playing an active part in the Doncaster Lyceum. Here, too, he wrote his first book (published 1842), a scientific account of the neighbouring Askern mineral springs. In 1839 he travelled to Heidelberg, learned German, and graduated MB, accomplishing this feat in only six months.<br>
<br>Lankester then settled in London, supporting himself by means of part-time medical appointments at two dispensaries, literary work, and popular lectures. From 1842 until at least 1856 he held a lectureship at the prestigious Grosvenor Place medical school. He made many friends at this time, including Charles and Catherine Dickens, Douglas Jerrold, and Arthur Henfrey. He lodged with Edward Forbes at Golden Square and was an original member of the Red Lion Club founded by Forbes in 1839. He wrote regularly for the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, chiefly on medical reform in support of Thomas Wakley, and for <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>. He was a regular attendant at the meetings of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and from 1839 to 1864 was the secretary of section D (botany and zoology). In 1844 he became secretary of the newly formed Ray Society for which he edited <span class="italic">The Memorials of John Ray</span> (1845). He was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1840 and of the Royal Society in 1845.<br>
<br>Also in 1845, on 3 July, Lankester married Phebe Pope [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58526/', "Lankester, Phebe (1825&#150;1900)")</script>], eldest daughter of Samuel Pope of Highbury, a former Lancashire mill owner. The couple set up home at 22 Old Burlington Street, but later moved to Savile Row, and in 1872 were living at 68 Belsize Park. Phebe was a botanist in her own right, producing popular botanical books and, after her husband's death, books on health matters. Seven of their eleven children survived to adulthood. Their eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34406/', "Sir (Edwin) Ray Lankester (1847&#150;1929)")</script>, was a brilliant zoologist, founder of the Plymouth marine laboratories, and director of the British Museum (Natural History).<br>
<br>In 1841 Lankester obtained the extra licence of the Royal College of Physicians, allowing him to practise in the provinces; he sat for the London licence five years later but failed an examination designed for students fresh from crammers. As a result, he abandoned clinical medicine as a career, turning to science and social medicine. In 1850 he obtained the chair of natural science at New College, London, holding it until the college terminated the appointment in 1872. He was a popular public lecturer, contributed to numerous encyclopaedias and reference works, wrote <span class="italic">The Natural History of Plants Yielding Food</span> (1845) and other books of popular science, translated Schleiden's <span class="italic">Grundz&uuml;ge der Wissenschaftlichen Botanik</span> (1849), and edited William McGillivray's <span class="italic">Natural History of Deeside</span> (1854) for the prince consort. He also translated Kuchenmeister's <span class="italic">Die in und an dem K&ouml;rper des lebenden Menschen vorkommenden Parasiten</span> (1855) which became a seminal work in British dermatology. Lankester was a skilled microscopist, was joint editor of the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science</span> from 1852 to 1871, and was president of the Microscopical Society of London in 1859 and 1860 and of the Quekett Microscopical Club in 1865; in 1859 he published his immensely popular <span class="italic">Half Hours with the Microscope</span>. In the same year he was appointed examiner in botany for the teachers' qualification newly instituted by the Department of Science and Art. He was a juror for the international exhibitions of 1851 and 1862. In 1858 he followed Lyon Playfair as superintendent of the food collection at the South Kensington Museum, where he reorganized and relabelled the exhibits to the benefit of the lay public, and published his associated lectures (1860, 1861). His employers considered that he had exceeded his brief and terminated his appointment in 1862. From 1856 to his death both Lankester and his wife published with Robert Hardwicke. Lankester advocated the teaching of physiology in schools and held advanced views on the place of women in society.<br>
<br>In 1849 Lankester was elected to the vestry of his parish, St James's, Westminster, and was active on a number of its committees when, in 1854, the infamous outbreak of cholera occurred in Broad Street. John Snow, who had published his brilliant theory on the epidemiology of the disease in 1849, quickly traced the outbreak to the local pump, but it was Lankester who enabled him to prove his theory by persuading his reluctant vestry to set up a cholera committee, finance an epidemiological study, and publish the results. Lankester also made a microscopical study of water samples and was able to disprove the then prevalent fungoid theory of the cause of cholera.<br>
<br>In 1856, as a result of his work on cholera, the vestry appointed Lankester to be the first medical officer of health for Westminster, a part-time post which he held until his death. He aimed to reduce by half the appalling death rate in the slums, while fighting a parsimonious vestry for adequate funds. He appointed a sanitary inspector to carry out regular inspections of the slum housing, drastically reduced the number of cow-houses and slaughter-houses in the basements, and tackled the water supply and the open sewers. His vaccination policy almost halved the incidence of smallpox in the parish, and his leaflets on precautions against cholera were delivered to every household. He made fortnightly reports to his vestry and published his deliberately uncompromising annual reports.<br>
<br>Lankester was an active participant in a number of medical societies, and it was as a member of the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association that he played an important part in its transformation to the British Medical Association (1856). He was also deeply involved in the struggle of both associations for a <span class="roman">Medical Reform Bill</span> (1858), fighting the royal colleges for real reforms and taking part in or leading a number of delegations to ministers.<br>
<br>On the death of Thomas Wakley, coroner for central Middlesex, Lankester was chosen as the medical candidate for the post, beating the legal candidate after a hugely expensive fight from which his own finances never recovered. His unorthodox use of the coronership to investigate the social evils causing death was violently opposed by his employers, the Middlesex magistrates, who retaliated by starving him of funds. With the help of the Social Science Association he publicized workhouse deaths, infanticides, and the huge infant death rate, which was often hidden by the incomplete registration of births. He pointed out the need for local mortuaries and for pathologists trained in post-mortem work, and was active in the Coroners' Society. His published annual reports were eagerly awaited by his colleagues and the public. As always, he insisted on the need to educate the public in health matters, himself publishing further popular books.<br>
<br>Lankester was an attractive man, tall, rather portly, with a high complexion and dark eyes and hair; his voice was deep, his manner warm and kind, and he had many friends attracted by his genial and sociable nature. His love of the countryside and of wild plants and animals was intense. He was a sincere Christian, probably moving between nonconformism and the Church of England, and he believed that God shaped the earth over millions of years for the express benefit of man. He was a born publicist, teacher, and reformer, always fighting for the poor and defenceless, but was eventually worn out by ceaseless conflict with a class-conscious, mean, and callous establishment. A prodigious worker, he took on far too many responsibilities and this, combined with his lack of method, resulted in constant admonishments for delay. Lankester succumbed to overwork and anxiety at the age of sixty and died of diabetes on 30 October 1874, at 7 The Paragon, Margate; he was buried at Hampstead. His estate of &pound;2000 was seized by the receiver to cover debts accrued in his fight for the coronership. His memory has been unjustly eclipsed by that of his brilliant son Ray.<br>
