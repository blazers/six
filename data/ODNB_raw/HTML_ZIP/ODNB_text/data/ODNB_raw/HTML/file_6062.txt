<span class="headword">Condy,  Nicholas</span>  (1793&#150;1857), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was baptized on 2 April 1793 at Withiel, Cornwall, the son of Nicholas Condy of Mevagissey and his wife, Elizabeth Thomas. He had at least two siblings: John Thomas Condy (<i>bap</i>. 1791 at Mevagissey) and Ann Condy (<i>bap</i>. 1795). He was gazetted to the 43rd regiment as an ensign, on 9 May 1811, and served in the Peninsular War. On 3 October 1814 he married Ann Trevanion Pyle (1792&#150;1860), the daughter of Captain Mark Oates of the marines, at Stoke Damerel, Devon. On 24 February 1818 he was promoted lieutenant, and that same year he retired on half pay. He afterwards lived in Plymouth, where he devoted himself to becoming a professional painter.<br>
<br>Condy produced chiefly small watercolours on tinted paper, about 8 inches by 5 inches, which he sold at prices ranging from 15<i>s</i>. to 1 guinea. He painted many shore scenes with figures and craft in the background, mostly local to Plymouth; he favoured &#145;rather garish red and greens&#146;, and his technique has been described as &#145;somewhat impressionistic&#146;, and &#145;very appealing&#146;  (Mallalieu, <span class="italic">Watercolour artists</span>, 65).<br>
<br>In the 1830s Condy associated with the Society of Plymouth Artists and Amateurs, which is said to have met fortnightly in the city. Between 1830 and 1845 he exhibited two landscapes at the Royal Academy, four at the British Institution, and a single work at Suffolk Street. He also exhibited two works at the Liverpool Academy in 1853, <span class="italic">An Interior&#151;Children Buying Sweets</span> and <span class="italic">A Cornish Cottage</span>. His best-known painting is <span class="italic">The Old Hall at Cotehele on a Rent-Day</span>, which was purchased by the earl of Mount Edgcumbe. Condy later published <span class="italic">Cothele, on the Banks of the Tamar</span> (<i>c</i>.1850), illustrated with seventeen lithographed plates.<br>
<br>Condy died on 8 January 1857 at his home, 10 Mount Pleasant Terrace, Plymouth, having suffered paralysis in the last four years of his life, and was buried in St Andrew's churchyard, Plymouth. He was survived by his wife. His son, <a name="cosubject_6063"></a><span class="headword">Nicholas Matthews Condy</span>  (1818&#150;1851)<span class="occ"></span>, who has often been confused with his father, was born at Union Street, Plymouth. He was educated at Exeter and was intended for the army or navy, but preferred instead to become a painter. He settled in his native town, where he both practised and taught painting. Between 1842 and 1845 he exhibited three sea-pieces at the Royal Academy. These gave hopes of his becoming a distinguished artist, but he died suddenly and prematurely at The Grove, Plymouth, on 20 May 1851. He was survived by his wife, Flora Ross, the third daughter of Major John Lockhart Gallie, of the 28th regiment.<br>
