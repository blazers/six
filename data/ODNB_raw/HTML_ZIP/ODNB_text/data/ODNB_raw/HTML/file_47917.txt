<span class="headword">Beddington,  John Louis <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>  (1893&#150;1959), <span class="occ">publicity manager</span>, was born on 30 January 1893, at Barkston Gardens, South Kensington, London, one of three sons of Charles Lindsay Beddington (<i>b</i>. 1866), barrister, and his wife, Stella Goldschmidt de Libantia. His family were Jewish and came originally from Alsace, but they made a great deal of money out of the &#145;rag trade&#146; in London. Their surname was Moses, but in the mid-1850s Jack's grandfather changed it to Beddington. The family firm of H. E. and M. Moses was wound up in the 1880s, and later generations of the family had no connection with the clothing industry.<br>
<br>Jack Beddington was educated at Wellington College and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he did no work but was &#145;ecstatically happy&#146;  (Ullstein, 15&#150;17) and was ploughed in Greats. He enlisted in the King's Own Yorkshire light infantry at the outbreak of the First World War and served until 1919, though severely wounded at Ypres. On 31 January 1918, at Holy Trinity, Brompton, Beddington married Olivia Margaret, daughter of Arthur Newton Streatfeild, and they had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>After the war Beddington worked for the Asiatic Petroleum Company (the Far Eastern arm of Royal Dutch&#150;Shell) in Shanghai, until he was invalided home in 1928. In London, on his complaining of the poor standard of advertising, he was promptly given the job of publicity manager under the general manager, F. L. Halford, taking on the same role in Shell-Mex and BP Ltd when that joint company was set up in 1932 to market petrol and other oil products for Shell and BP (though the BP advertising was never as successful as that produced for Shell). Continuing in the pioneering tradition of Frank Pick at London Transport, Beddington became famous for the posters and press campaigns created under his aegis.<br>
<br>Advertising posters had from the early 1920s been fixed onto Shell lorries, and Beddington made this &#145;lorrybill&#146; series his own, creating for Shell a strong identity both with art and with the countryside. Fine artists as well as graphic designers were used, unknown as well as established. In 1932 Beddington gave Graham Sutherland his first commission. Other artists included Paul Nash and Ben Nicholson. His experimental approach traded uniformity for the spontaneous individuality of numerous artists. An exhibition catalogue later described the Shell and London Transport posters as &#145;glittering islands in a becalmed sea of unrelieved banality&#146;  (Guyatt, foreword). Beddington was also responsible for the injection of wit and humour into the company's press campaigns, using artists such as Rex Whistler and Edward Bawden. He was receptive to new ideas and, as a result of an approach by John Betjeman, the <span class="roman">Shell County Guides</span> were published, the first of which appeared in 1934.<br>
<br>The advertising could be self-indulgent, Beddington himself even appearing in one press advertisement&#151;one of a series advertising the advertising. However, his judgement though shrewd was not condescending, and it was perhaps in this ability to combine quality with popular appeal that his supreme talent lay. His policies gained for Shell-Mex and BP a reputation for enlightened patronage and sophisticated advertising, the lorrybills idea in particular provoking much praise for not cluttering the countryside with hoardings, a contemporary obsession. Beddington was influential in breathing vitality and vision into the British advertising and design world, where art and commerce were seldom seen to mix.<br>
<br>Flamboyant, dapper, and with a keen wit, Beddington was businesslike and brusque. However, he appreciated talent, and his kindness and encouragement to young painters and writers were well known. In 1936 he was appointed assistant general manager of Shell-Mex and BP Ltd, keeping his position as publicity manager but taking on some responsibility for staff matters, and when the Second World War began he was appointed joint manager of the staff department of the Petroleum Board. In April 1940 he was appointed director of the films division at the Ministry of Information, where he remained until 1946. Among the documentaries produced in his time there were <span class="italic">Desert Victory</span> (1943) and <span class="italic">The True Glory</span> (1945). Beddington also coined the anti-gossip slogan, &#145;Be like Dad: keep Mum&#146;. He was made a CBE in 1943.<br>
<br>After the war Beddington joined Colman Prentis and Varley Ltd, an advertising agency, and became deputy chairman, a post he held until his death. An honorary fellow of the Society of Industrial Artists and of the Royal Society of Arts, and a governor of the Foundation for Visual Education, he was also a member of the National Advisory Council on Art Education, and of the council of the Royal College of Art.<br>
<br>Jack Beddington died suddenly of a heart attack on 13 April 1959, aged sixty-six, at 22 Knightsbridge Court, London. He was survived by his wife.<br>
