</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wetenhall,  Edward</span>  (1636&#150;1713), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh</span>, was born at Lichfield on 7 October 1636. Educated at Westminster School under Richard Busby, he was admitted king's scholar in 1651, and went to Trinity College, Cambridge, as a foundation scholar in 1655. After graduating BA in 1658 he migrated (1660) to Lincoln College, Oxford, of which he became chaplain, was incorporated BA on 18 June, and graduated MA on 10 July 1661. He held the perpetual curacy of Combe, Oxfordshire, and the vicarage of St Stephen's, near St Albans, Hertfordshire; on 11 June 1667 he was collated to a prebend at Exeter, holding with it the mastership of the Blue-Coat School. He graduated BD at Oxford on 26 May 1669, and was incorporated BD at Cambridge in 1670. Michael Boyle the younger, then archbishop of Dublin, took him over to Dublin in 1672 as master of the Blue-Coat School. He was made DD at Trinity College (1674), became curate of St Werburgh's, and afterwards chantor of Christ Church. On the death (22 December 1678) of Edward Synge, bishop of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross, the sees were separated, and Wetenhall was made (3 February 1679) bishop of Cork and Ross, being consecrated on 23 March 1679 in Christ Church, Dublin.<br>
<br>Following the accession of James II, Wetenhall travelled through the diocese preaching on the duty of obedience. In 1686 he published six of these sermons under the title <span class="italic">Hexapla Jacobaea: a Specimen of Loyalty to &hellip; James II</span>. He was one of only seven bishops who remained in Ireland during the crisis of 1688&#150;91, and one of only four who attended James's Irish parliament. According to his own account his opposition to the proceedings there almost led to penalties for contempt, and he was subsequently a prisoner in Cork city during Marlborough's siege (23&#150;8 September 1690). Nevertheless his perceived collaboration exposed him to accusations of Jacobite sympathies. These reportedly led to his being passed over when the vacant see of Cashel was filled in 1691  (James Bonnell to J. Strype, 21 Feb 1691, Strype correspondence, 1, fol. 87<i>v</i>). <span class="italic">The case of the Irish protestants in relation to recognizing or swearing allegiance to and praying for King William and Queen Mary stated and resolved</span> (1691), published anonymously but widely recognized as Wetenhall's work, did not wholly rebut these charges. It defended protestant acquiescence in the Revolution, but conspicuously failed to repudiate passive obedience or to declare that James had ceased to be lawful king. Instead the argument was that James had made it impossible for protestants to maintain their vows of allegiance, combined with an appeal to providence: &#145;God has now put us under the power of the second William the Conqueror&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Case</span>, 6). In 1699 Wetenhall was transferred to the diocese of Kilmore and Ardagh, although he appears to have had some qualms about thus taking the place of the ousted nonjuror William Sheridan.<br>
<br>Wetenhall's attitude to protestant dissent has been characterized as &#145;moderately ecumenical&#146;  (Greaves, 378). <span class="italic">The Protestant Peacemaker</span> (1682) praised the positive qualities of all protestant religious denominations, while arguing that dissenters were not justified in separating from the established church. The following year Wetenhall was one of those who opposed the government's campaign of repression against conventicles. After the revolution he opposed early calls for the extension to Ireland of the sacramental test, on the grounds that this was a profanation of the sacrament. His own theological orthodoxy was called into question when he intervened in the controversy on the doctrine of the Trinity raised by the publications of William Sherlock DD and John Wallis. His <span class="italic">An Earnest and Compassionate Suit for Forbearance &hellip; by a Melancholy Stander-by</span> (1691) and <span class="italic">The Antapology of the Melancholy Stander-by</span> (1693) led Archbishop King and others to conclude that his views on the Trinity were unsound. Having attended Thomas Emlyn's trial for heresy, he later visited him in prison. In 1698&#150;9 an initially friendly meeting with William Penn led to an acrimonious exchange of pamphlets, commencing with Wetenhall's <span class="italic">The testimony of the bishop of Cork as to a paper entitled &#145;Gospel truths&#146; &hellip; by the people called Quakers</span> (1698) and continuing with his <span class="italic">A brief and modest reply to Mr Penn's tedious, scurrilous and unchristian defence against the bishop of Cork</span> (1699). In 1710 he was a signatory to the memorial submitted to the lord lieutenant, the second duke of Ormond, in support of the attempts of John Richardson, a clergyman in Wetenhall's diocese, to promote missionary work through the Irish language among the Catholic population.<br>
<br>Wetenhall seems generally to have been remembered as a conscientious bishop, who actively promoted pastoral work, courageously and energetically rallied his flock during the crisis years 1688&#150;91, and contributed out of his own resources to the repair of the episcopal residences at Cork and Kilmore and the restoration of the cathedral of Ardagh. Archbishop King, however, reported in 1714 that Kilmore and Ardagh had generally been neglected owing to Wetenhall's absence and poor health. Moreover he had been influenced by others to discontinue the church-building programme commenced by his predecessor and to obstruct the disciplinary proceedings of the latter's chancellor. Later King listed him as one of those bishops who had despoiled their sees for personal gain, instancing the sale of a wood belonging to Kilmore. Wetenhall had a particular interest in religious instruction. His <span class="italic">The Catechism of the Church of England, with Marginal Notes</span> was published in London in 1678 (apparently one of several pre-1696 editions) and in Dublin in 1696, with a revised version, <span class="italic">A Tried Method of Catechising</span>, in 1698 (Dublin edition, 1706). Bonnell, a relative by marriage, characterized him as &#145;a vigorous good man, and very useful to the church&#146;, not wholly successful in his printed works &#145;because he does not exhaust a subject&#146;, but excelling in extempore preaching and in &#145;practical casuisticalness&#146;  (Webster, 293&#150;4).<br>
<br>Wetenhall married twice; his second wife was Philippa (<i>d</i>. 1717), sixth daughter of Sir William D'Oyly, bt, of Shotticham, Kent. His later years were spent in London, where he died on 12 November 1713; he was buried on 18 November in the south transept of Westminster Abbey, where there is an inscribed gravestone to his memory. In his will he affirmed the Church of England and Ireland to be &#145;the purest church in the world&#146;, though &#145;there are divers points which might be altered for the better&#146; in &#145;articles, liturgy, and discipline, but especially in the conditions of clerical communion&#146;. His eldest son with his first wife was Edward Wetenhall MD (buried on 29 August 1733, aged seventy). Another son, John (<i>c</i>.1669&#150;1717), followed his father into the church and became archdeacon of Cork in 1697.<br>
