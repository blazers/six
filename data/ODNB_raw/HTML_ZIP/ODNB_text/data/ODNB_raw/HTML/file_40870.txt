<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Magnus, Sir  Philip</span>, first baronet  (1842&#150;1933), <span class="occ">educationist and politician</span>, was born on 7 October 1842 at 160 High Holborn, London, the second of the five children of Jacob Magnus (1805&#150;1888), a tailor and later a wine merchant, and his wife, Caroline Barnett (1808/9&#150;1894). Jacob Magnus had moved from Chatham to London, where his business enabled him to leave an estate valued at &pound;6800 at his death in 1888. The marriage, though it produced five children, was not a happy one and ended in separation. Laurie, the eldest son, born in 1840, died of meningitis in 1863; Edward, the youngest child, emigrated to Sydney, Australia, where he died in 1922. The two daughters, Sarah and Josephine, did not marry.<br>
<br>Laurie and Philip Magnus began their education at Poland Street Academy (preparatory school, 1850&#150;54), from which they progressed to University College School, London (1854&#150;8). This school had been established in 1829 to provide an efficient middle-class education for Jewish and nonconformist boys at moderate cost. The curriculum emphasized modern studies&#151;mathematics, languages, and science&#151;which at the time were not taught in more traditionally organized schools for the middle classes. A further aim of the school was to prepare boys for entry to its parent, University College, which Magnus entered in autumn 1858. He graduated in 1863 with a first-class degree in arts and the following year with similar distinction in science.<br>
<br>Magnus was a regular attender at the West London Reform Synagogue and, having determined to dedicate his life to the service of God, spent the next three years at Berlin University, the centre of Jewish Reform, the movement which gave rise to the West London Synagogue. In 1866 he was appointed assistant minister at the Reform synagogue, Margaret Street, Portland Place, London, at a salary of &pound;150 p.a. He served as rabbi in the synagogue for fourteen years, first in Margaret Street and later in its new premises in Upper Berkeley Street. His duties were to preach, teach, and to organize, and he became involved in the affairs of the synagogue and other Jewish causes and enterprises. To supplement his income he began to tutor private students in mathematics, mechanics, and physics. As his reputation grew so his involvement with educational institutions and associations widened. He lectured at University College, its school, and hospital, was appointed visiting lecturer in the theory and practice of education at Stockwell Training College, and was an examiner for the College of Preceptors. As a member of convocation he was drawn into the recurring discussions there for the reform of the University of London. In 1875 he published his first textbook, <span class="italic">Lessons in Elementary Mechanics</span>, which became a best-seller and the first of a series of elementary science textbooks published by Longmans.<br>
<br>Any tensions between Magnus's duties at the synagogue and his extensive educational commitments were resolved in 1880 when he was appointed director and organizing secretary of the newly created City and Guilds of London Institute for the Advancement of Technical Education. The institute had been set up two years previously by a few of the leading livery companies of the City of London in response to pressure from critics of the unreformed corporation and the privileged companies. Many of these critics were associated with the Liberal Party. They argued that the companies should spend some of their wealth on technical education on account of their historical association with apprenticeship. These Liberal attacks on the companies, including threats of a royal commission to reveal their wealth, stimulated a few companies to take steps to establish the institute of which Magnus was the principal administrator for thirty-five years. Led by the Clothworkers' Company, the companies formed a defence committee which produced in 1878 a &#145;Report on technical education&#146; containing a detailed plan for action on three fronts: a central institution for the training of technologists; two &#145;model&#146; trade or technical schools; and a national scheme of technical examinations driven by the principle of &#145;payment by results&#146;.<br>
<br>Under Magnus's leadership these plans were put into effect. The examinations in trade and technical subjects of the Society of Arts were taken over in 1879; the Finsbury Technical College and the School of Art in Kennington were opened in the 1880s; and the Central Institute or City and Guilds Engineering College was established at South Kensington. As the activities of the institute matured&#151;notably with the increase in entries for its widening prospectus of trade and technical certificates&#151;it came to be seen as a private ministry of technical education with Magnus as its nationally known chief spokesman and representative. At times this gave rise to jealousy on the part of liverymen who resented large expenditure on the Central Institute located outside the City of London. Also, when in 1899 a central authority for all sectors of public education was finally established, officers of the new Board of Education were affronted by the influence over the technical sector of education of what was in effect a private agency.<br>
<br>Now a national figure in technical education, Magnus was a member of the royal commission on technical instruction appointed by the Liberal government in 1881. Chaired by Bernhard Samuelson, the commissioners surveyed technical education at home and abroad and made recommendations for reforms. Magnus reported on the systems in France, Germany, Italy, Austria, and Switzerland and for his work was awarded a knighthood (1886), an early instance of that honour being conferred for services to education. Thereafter he was involved in every important movement for technical education up to 1914. He was a member of the executive committee of the National Association for the Promotion of Technical and Secondary Education, one key source of pressure for educational reform at the time. From 1893 he served on the London school board, where his &#145;three planks&#146; were the abolition of fees for elementary education, the ending of payment by results, and the broadening of the curriculum by the introduction of instruction in practical arts and skills. He served too on the committee which reported in favour of the creation of the Imperial College of Science and Technology through the combination of the Royal School of Mines, the Royal College of Science, and the City and Guilds College.<br>
<br>In 1910 Magnus published <span class="italic">Educational Aims and Efforts, 1880&#150;1910</span>, which summarized his many activities promoting &#145;technical education&#146;, at a time when the term referred to modern studies and curricula in general as well as to trade and technical subjects. He retired from the City and Guilds Institute in 1915 after thirty-five years' service which saw the institute established as a body of national and international importance. In this he was acknowledged by colleagues in the technical education movement to have played a major part. His position as the greatest living authority on the subject led to him being asked to contribute the entry on technical education in the famous eleventh edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. This survey, occupying twenty-three columns, is a rich source for students of the formative period of English technical education.<br>
<br>From 1906 to 1922 Magnus represented London University as a Unionist MP, the first Jew to serve as a representative for one of the university seats. This was a fitting position for Magnus, who had maintained his commitment to the development of the university, notably as a member of convocation active in unsuccessful attempts to reform its structure. In 1917 he accepted a baronetcy.<br>
<br>On 29 March 1870, in the same year that he joined the institute, Magnus married Katie (1844&#150;1924) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55630/', "Magnus, Katie")</script>], daughter of the goldsmith Emanuel Emanuel of Southsea; they lived first in London, then in 1893 moved to Tangley Hill, Chilworth, Surrey. There were five children of the marriage of whom three survived. As the children grew, Katie Magnus became active in Jewish educational and social causes, especially in the East End of London. She was a regular contributor to journals and is remembered for her <span class="italic">Outlines of Jewish History</span> (1886; rev. edns, 1924 and 1958).<br>
<br>Magnus, too, was proud of his Jewishness but was not a Zionist. He served the community as chairman of the Jewish war memorial council, and as a vice-president of the Jewish board of deputies, of the Anglo-Jewish association, and of Jews' College. He died at his home, Tangley Hill, on 29 August 1933 and was buried on 31 August at Golders Green cemetery. His two sons predeceased him; the eldest, Laurie Magnus (1872&#150;1933), was a publisher and chairman of the Girls' Public Day School Trust. Philip Magnus was succeeded as second baronet by his grandson, the historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60712/', "Sir Philip Montefiore Magnus (1906&#150;1988)")</script>.<br>
