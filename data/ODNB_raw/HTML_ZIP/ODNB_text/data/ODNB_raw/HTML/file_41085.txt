<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tilak, Bal Gangadhar</span>  (1856&#150;1920), <span class="occ">Indian nationalist and journalist</span>, was born on 23 July 1856 in Ratnagiri district, the last of the four children and only son of (Pandit) Gangadharpant Ramchandra Tilak (1820&#150;1872), deputy inspector of primary schools, author, and small landowner, and his wife, Parvitabai. The family had been administrators under the peshwas in the Maratha confederation but had, like other Chitpavan Brahmans, retired to their ancestral village when Britain established its rule over the region in 1818. Although given the name Keshav at birth, Tilak was known throughout his life by his family petname of Bal or Balwant. While studying at the English School in Poona in 1871 he married ten-year-old Tapibai, renamed at marriage Satyabhamabai, of the Bal family of Dapoli district in Bombay presidency. They had three sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Tilak studied at the Deccan College in Poona from 1873, graduating with a BA in mathematics and Sanskrit in 1876 and an LLB in 1879. With other intellectuals concerned with promoting Western education among the city's &eacute;lites, he established the New English School in Poona in 1880, the Deccan Education Society in 1884, and Fergusson College in 1885. The group set up two newspapers, the English-language <span class="italic">Mahratta</span> and the Marathi-language <span class="italic">Kesari</span> in 1881. The tone of the papers soon led the two editors, G. G. Agarkar and Tilak, into a defamation case, for which they were gaoled for four months in 1882. During the late 1880s serious differences emerged among the founding members over the issues of religious conservatism, orthodoxy, and reform. Tilak left the society in 1890, but took the two newspapers with him. As he chose not to practise law, he lived on a minute income from landed property inherited from his father and from the newspapers when they finally began to make a profit after 1899. Throughout much of his life, court litigation placed a heavy drain on his financial&#151;and indeed emotional&#151;resources.<br>
<br>Tilak was courageous, strong-willed, and determined, and his life was full of controversy and conflict. In the early 1890s he engaged in a heated debate against the raising of the age of consent at marriage by attacking government legislation on the grounds that change should not be imposed by a foreign government outside Hindu society. Tilak's stand won him Brahman support, which was enhanced by his pro-Hindu position following serious Hindu&#150;Muslim riots in Poona in 1894. Concurrently he built up his base in the leading regional political association, the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, and finally captured it in 1896. In 1895 he had successfully campaigned against M. G. Ranade and other moderate politicians hitherto dominant in Poona politics by preventing them from holding the National Social Conference at the same time as the Indian National Congress, the major nationalist organization, founded in 1885, which met in session at the end of each year. In 1894, he inaugurated public celebration of the regional festival of the elephant-headed god, Ganapati, using it to spread patriotic sentiment. In fiery editorials and speeches he opposed British rule, and, through the use of the metaphor of Maratha resistance to the Mughals in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, seemed to imply ways of resisting the British. In 1897 he instituted the celebration of the birth of Shivaji, the seventeenth-century Maratha leader who had founded the Maratha state against the might of Aurangzeb's Mughal empire. During the 1896 famine in Maharashtra he organized relief works and cheap grain shops, and when plague broke out he set up hospitals for the relief of victims. The British imposition of sanitary measures against plague evoked widespread antagonism, speeded the establishment of revolutionary and terrorist groups, and led to the assassination of W. C. Rand, the official charged with plague operations in Poona. Tilak was suspected of complicity in the Rand assassination and in 1897 was gaoled for eighteen months for sedition. He had been elected to the Bombay legislative council in 1895, and re-elected in 1897, but resigned when he was tried.<br>
<br>In 1898, released early as a result of lobbying from European Sanskrit scholars, Tilak became embroiled in a complicated and extended controversy over the posthumous adoption of a male heir to his recently deceased friend, Baba Maharaj. Involved as an executor, Tilak faced criminal charges in what became known as the Tai Maharaj adoption case. It dragged on from 1901 to 1904, when he was cleared of the charges, but was not finally settled, after references to the privy council in 1915 and the Bombay high court, until just before his death in 1920. Tilak moved to the forefront of all-India politics between 1903 and 1908, when he opposed the partition of Bengal and advocated the boycott of British goods, the use of swadeshi goods (&#145;of one's own country&#146;), national education, and Hindi as a national language. With Bipin Chandra Pal and Lala Lajpat Rai he became a central figure in a new, extremist party which opposed the more moderate and constitutional tactics of nationalists like G. K. Gokhale and P. M. Mehta. The triumvirate were behind the split of the Indian National Congress at Surat in 1907. The rise of extremist and radical politics brought a reaction from the government, and in 1908 Tilak was tried for inciting disaffection and transported to Mandalay, where he remained until 1914.<br>
<br>On his release, Tilak set up a network of home-rule leagues in Maharashtra, working in alliance with similar leagues organized by Annie Besant. He and his followers were readmitted to Congress in 1916. After the war he urged that Indians meet the new constitutional offers under the Montagu&#150;Chelmsford declaration with responsive co-operation, intending that they should enter the new councils and continue opposition from within. In 1919 he was in London, bringing a libel case against the writer Valentine Chirol, who had called him the &#145;father of Indian unrest&#146;, but he lost and returned to India in November of the same year. In April 1920 he established the Congress Democratic Party, but it was barely active before he died in Bombay of pneumonia related to malarial complications on 1 August 1920, the day on which M. K. Gandhi inaugurated his first non-co-operation campaign. Tilak's funeral procession of over a mile and a half was the longest in Bombay's history, a testament to his political popularity and the charisma which he enjoyed.<br>
<br>Tilak coined the potent slogan &#145;Swaraj [self- or home rule] is my birthright and I will have it&#146;, and earned the title of Lokamanya (&#145;the beloved of the people&#146;) for his passionate defence of Indian interests. In achieving mass popularity in and outside the presidency he had pointed out the tactical direction of nationalist politics thereafter; with his strong and forceful nationalist rhetoric he pointed the way for future nationalist objectives and ideology. In the process he restructured Marathi as a modern language of polemic and protest, and rethought classic Sanskrit texts in terms of the current situation, seeing in the <span class="italic">Bhagavad Gita</span> (published as the <span class="italic">Gita rahasya</span> in 1915) an exemplar of political action. Earlier, writing in the 1890s, he had sought to establish the antiquity of Vedic scriptures by combining textual analysis with astronomical calculations, and had won repute as a Sanskrit scholar. He was a formidable political figure who rewrote nationalist ideology and voiced it with unmistakable &eacute;clat, but his ideas were complex and subtle in handling traditional notions at a time of stress. Tilak used traditional elements as rallying points for modern political interventions and created a contemporary political polemic by utilizing rather than destroying past traditions. Although his style and approach were superseded by the different strategies and ideas championed by M. K. Gandhi in the following decades of nationalist agitation, he remains an icon of modern India.<br>
