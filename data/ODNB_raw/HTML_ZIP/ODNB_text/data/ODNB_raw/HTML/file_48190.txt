<span class="headword">Simon,  Henry</span>  (1835&#150;1899), <span class="occ">industrialist and inventor</span>, was born Gustav Heinrich Victor Amandus Simon at Brieg, Silesia, then a province of Prussia, on 7 June 1835, the son of Friedrich Gustav Simon (1807&#150;1867), a Jewish civil servant and railway director, and his wife, Antonie Theodora, <i>n&eacute;e</i> St&ouml;ckel (1814&#150;1893), a Christian, who published three novels. Although his father's career gave Henry access to railways, his unmarried uncle Heinrich Simon (1805&#150;1860) was the most influential figure in his education and choice of career. A lawyer who had grown up surrounded by ideas of the German&#150;Jewish Enlightenment, and a champion of German national unity, Heinrich was secretary of the liberal Frankfurt parliament of 1848&#150;9 and after its forced dissolution was obliged to flee to Switzerland in exile.<br>
<br>Simon and his parents joined Heinrich in Z&uuml;rich, where he attended the Z&uuml;rich School of Industry, which prepared pupils from the age of thirteen for careers in science and technology. He attended the University of Breslau for two years, studying science and mathematics, and may have also been apprenticed to an engineering works at Reichenhall. In 1853 he joined the first cohort of students at the newly established Z&uuml;rich Polytechnic which was modelled on the technical universities of Stuttgart and Karlsruhe. He studied machine construction, technical physics, building construction, and higher mathematics, besides other practical engineering-related subjects. On graduation in 1858 he was required, as a Prussian citizen, to undertake military service and served with the Berlin artillery and then in the guards, subsequently joining a manufacturer of turbines and sugar works machinery in Magdeburg.<br>
<br>In 1860 Simon moved to Manchester, where there had been a thriving German mercantile community for over a century. His uncle had encouraged him to leave Germany in the previous year, and contacted German expatriate residents of Manchester on his nephew's behalf, including Dr Louis Borchardt and Henry M. Steinthal, who were partners in Heinrich Simon's copper mine business and fellow fugitives of the revolutions of 1848. Heinrich's death in a swimming accident hastened the move and Henry Simon went on to establish himself in Manchester as a consulting engineer. He was appointed to represent the Jametel company in their Russian railway contracts, spending much of 1861 and 1862 in Russia, supervising the construction of the railway between Warsaw and Vilna. In 1863 he was engaged in engineering work in Italy and France. He became a naturalized British subject and lived first in Greenheys, a Manchester suburb much favoured by German immigrants.<br>
<br>Henry Simon's first office premises were at 28 Deansgate and in 1868 he moved to St Peter's Square, Manchester. Starting with little capital, he had no manufacturing facility of his own but established a small experimental workshop in East Street, later transferring both office and workshop to an imposing building in Mount Street, Manchester. Inspired by his uncle, he believed in independence and honesty in all business, professional, and family relationships. Fluent in French and German, besides English, and an able networker, he built on connections made at Z&uuml;rich Polytechnic, as well as within the German community in Manchester. He was a founder member of the Schiller Anstalt, founded by and for German immigrants to Manchester in the year he arrived in England.<br>
<br>Simon married, first, at Strangeways Unitarian Chapel, Manchester, on 25 January 1871, an Australian woman, Mary Jane Lane (1847/8&#150;1877), daughter of William Lane. They had a son, born in 1875. Following her death, he married, second, on 30 November 1878, Emily Ann Stoehr (1858&#150;1920), eldest daughter of his uncle's friend and business partner Emile M. Stoehr. There were seven children born of his second marriage. On his first marriage he moved to Fallowfield and, in the late 1870s, to Didsbury, remaining in Palatine Road, in a house he named Darwin (one of Henry Simon's heroes) until he built himself Lawnhurst on land acquired in Didsbury.<br>
<br>From the late 1860s Simon was seeking an industrial sector on which to focus and had kept abreast of flour milling developments in continental Europe where, by 1875, all the main flour mills in Austria and Hungary had introduced roller plant. From 1862 there had been attempts in Britain to apply roller technology to flour milling, but none had been successful. Instead, flour milling continued to be undertaken by the centuries-old method of millstones, although British port millers feared that traditional stone milling was not the most effective technology for processing imported American wheat, while customers were demanding fine white flour.<br>
<br>The German engineer Gustav Buchholz had begun working in England in the 1840s and, in 1862, was granted a patent for a roller mill with grooved steel rolls, installing his first known plant in an Ipswich mill in the same year. The second phase of roller milling technology innovation in Britain was initiated by Friedrich Wegmann, partner in a Naples engineering firm who experimented with rollers in a number of different materials, porcelain being the material adopted in Britain. His first patent was granted in 1874. But this phase in the diffusion of roller mills was short-lived, since porcelain rollers required regular regrinding with diamond cutters.<br>
<br>In the late 1870s Henry Simon contributed the most decisive stage in the third phase of the diffusion of roller milling, namely an integrated system of rollers and purifiers to sift and grade the milled flour. Simon's firm in Manchester was one of three (the other two were in Ipswich and Rochdale) that initiated the most decisive stage in the introduction of roller milling. Of the three firms Simon achieved the largest market share, partly because his customer feedback was consistently good, but also because he was an effective self-publicist.<br>
<br>Simon introduced the roller mill made by the Swiss engineering firm Daverio, Siessardt, and Geisler, claiming that it was the first complete gradual reduction plant which completely dispensed with the use of stones. He described his system in papers to the Institution of Civil Engineers and the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, published in their proceedings in 1882 and 1889. By 1882 Simon was developing his own designs, and claimed twenty-five millers had adopted &#145;the Simon system&#146; by May that year. In October 1883 he published the first of an annual series of maps depicting the sites of his roller mill systems. The first map showed a concentration of Simon plant in Lancashire and Yorkshire with other installations in London, Gloucester, Belfast, and Carlow. The fifth map of 1887 showed a total of 143 complete roller plant and 90 combined mills, well over half of the roller mills being in the north of England and a preponderance of combined plant in East Anglia and the south. There were, in addition, 24 overseas installations, the total rising to 47 in 1888 and 63 in 1889. The largest remaining stone miller in London, a keen advocate of the older milling method, changed to a complete Simon system in 1884. By 1892 two-thirds of greater London's flour and most of the flour in other parts of the UK was being milled on the Simon system. In addition the Simon system had diffused to Japan, India, Australia (where a branch office was opened in 1893), New Zealand, Brazil, and Germany. In 1897 the milling business became a limited liability company, Henry Simon Ltd, with a nominal capital of &pound;100,000.<br>
<br>The second industrial process introduced to Britain by Henry Simon was by-product coking, which he had seen in operation in France in 1879 at the works developed by Fran&ccedil;ois Carves. British producers were using the uneconomic and crude &#145;beehive&#146; oven method which produced polluting waste products. Simon formed a partnership with Carves, securing the British patent rights to the invention and, in 1881, installed twenty-five ovens at a Durham colliery of Pease &amp; Partners. British ironmasters were reluctant to invest in the process since they continued to make adequate profits from the older technology. To encourage them to adopt by-product coking, Simon introduced an innovative business method, by offering to cover the entire capital cost, handing the completed facility to the customer and taking a share in the by-products produced. This speeded up adoption to some extent, but it was not until the 1890s that wider adoption took place after Simon and Carves formed a company to build and operate two batteries of ovens for a colliery in Lanchester, co. Durham. They provided most of the capital and accepted payment by taking shares in the by-products, establishing a demonstration plant while earning a dividend of about 20 per cent. The business became a limited liability company, Simon-Carves, in 1896 with a nominal capital of &pound;100,000. Although four more plants were built towards the end of the century, the conservatism of British ironmasters, who remained attached to beehives, together with cheaper foreign competition, reduced market opportunities.<br>
<br>Simon's design and consulting engineering business was run from a five-storey office building in Manchester. By not investing directly in large engineering works, he spread his business risk. His machines, often incorporating his innovations, were built by leading continental firms, which he identified and visited while undertaking his consulting engineering contracts. From 1892 he produced monthly circulars illustrated with photographs and diagrams, which provided a means of keeping in touch with clients and publishing customer feedback. In the 1890s he was involved in patent litigation. In 1893 he initiated proceedings against the makers of a straight copy of his Cyclone Dust Collector, which cleaned fine dust from the mills, important for the health of mill workers besides reducing the threat of fire. Judgment was given in favour of Simon but he complained at the considerable cost of enforcing his claim. In the second case, heard in 1894, he was the defendant, accusations of infringement being alleged against his Reform purifier, but the court found in his favour, a judgment that was upheld on appeal to the House of Lords. The cases, though, took their toll on him.<br>
<br>Simon played a full part in Manchester public life. Concerned to ensure an enlightened education for his daughters he founded, together with C. P. Scott, a school which became Withington Girls' School. Passionate about living standards, he was first chair of the Manchester Labourers' Dwellings Company, besides being one of the initiators and first directors of the Manchester Pure Milk Supply Company. He took a leading part in the establishment of a crematorium in Manchester, acting as honorary technical adviser, designing the furnace, and becoming chair of the board. There was only one other crematorium in England, at Woking, and Simon visited Paris and Milan to collect information on best practice. He was a keen supporter of the Hall&eacute; Concert Society, being a member of the management committee and, in due course, was influential in Hans Richter's appointment as Sir Charles Hall&eacute;'s successor. In 1895 Simon made a substantial donation to Owens College (from 1903 the University of Manchester) to establish a chair of German literature, and was subsequently a leading benefactor of a new physics laboratory which was completed after his death. He was a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and the Iron and Steel Institute, and a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and the Society of Arts.<br>
<br>Simon successfully applied scientific principles to practical business problems, transforming corn milling in Britain during his lifetime. He was a bearded man of imposing stature, &#145;of strong individuality and commanding presence, [and] courteous &hellip; in his business&#146; dealings  (Tweedale, 177). Of no religious faith, he believed that freedom for individual action was crucial in human affairs, being prepared to take a stand even when risks were involved. Believing that &#145;it is possible to live splendidly and without vulgar ostentation&#146;, he exhorted his children to &#145;understand that the only justification for man's existence&#146; is &#145;to undertake to do useful work&#146;  (Simon, 131). He died, at his home, Lawnhurst, Didsbury, on 22 July 1899, of gouty heart, pulmonary oedema, and cardiac failure, occasioned by overwork and nervous strain. He was cremated at the Manchester crematorium, Didsbury. His eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36095/', "Ernest Emil Darwin Simon")</script>, became first Baron Simon of Wythenshaw.<br>
