<span class="headword">Drax, Sir  Reginald Aylmer Ranfurly  Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-</span>  (1880&#150;1967), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born in London on 28 August 1880, the second of the two sons of John William Plunkett, later seventeenth Baron Dunsany (1853&#150;1899), and his wife, Ernle Elizabeth Louisa Maria Grosvenor Burton (<i>d</i>. 1916), only child of Colonel Francis Augustus Plunkett Burton, of the Coldstream Guards. In 1916, on inheriting estates from his mother, he assumed by royal licence the additional names of Ernle-Erle-Drax. Thereafter he was usually known by the surname of Drax. His elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35547/', "Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett, eighteenth Baron Dunsany")</script>.<br>
<br>After attending Cheam School Plunkett joined the training ship <i>Britannia</i> and began service at sea in 1896. He was promoted lieutenant in 1901 and went on to specialize in torpedo. His request to attend the Staff College, Camberley, was granted and there he took an intense interest in &#145;the subject of staff training and its application&#151;then quite unthought of in higher naval circles&#151;to the needs of the navy&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12). In 1912 he received early promotion to commander and when in 1913 Admiral Beatty was given command of the battle-cruiser squadron, he chose Plunkett as his war staff officer. In this capacity he served in the <i>Lion</i> at the actions of Heligoland Bight, Dogger Bank, and Jutland. He was promoted captain in 1916 and ended the war in the cruiser <i>Blanche</i> which was employed in laying minefields in the Heligoland Bight close to the enemy's main ports. For his services in the <i>Lion</i> he was mentioned in dispatches and he was appointed to the DSO when commanding the <i>Blanche</i>. On 15 April 1916 he married Kathleen (<i>d</i>. 1980), only daughter of Quintin Chalmers MD and sister of the future Rear-Admiral W. S. Chalmers, the naval biographer. They had four daughters and one son.<br>
<br>Prior to the war Drax had been a founding member of the Naval Society which from 1913 had issued the quarterly <span class="italic">Naval Review</span> to encourage new ideas on naval matters. He was one of the group of younger officers of the Grand Fleet known as the Young Turks who increasingly criticized the defensive approach of the Admiralty. During the later years of the war Drax privately wrote at length on what he saw as the failings of the navy leadership. In 1917 he noted of the strategies adopted by the Admiralty that &#145;Masterly strategy, deep knowledge of the Art of War, keen and rapid brain-work&#151;these were pitiably absent&#146;  (Marder, 5.325). Drax kept up such criticism of ineffective policy throughout and following his career, and later wrote <span class="italic">The Art of War</span> (1943) and other works which attacked aspects of defence strategy.<br>
<br>Intellectually Drax &#145;stood out among his brother officers&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12), and his talents were recognized within the navy. In 1919 he became first director of the new Royal Naval Staff College at Greenwich where he served until 1922. Having proved himself a brilliant staff officer and thinker and also as a fine captain of a cruiser, he was the ideal person for this appointment as he showed it was possible to be both. He did much to make staff work respectable in a navy where thinkers were apt to be regarded with suspicion. He went next as president of the Inter-Allied Naval Control Commission in Berlin until 1924. In 1926&#150;7 he commanded the <i>Marlborough</i> in the 3rd battle squadron.<br>
<br>In 1928 Drax was promoted rear-admiral and in 1929 appointed to command the 1st battle squadron in the Mediterranean. As director of manning at the Admiralty (1930&#150;32) he was involved in the recovery of the navy's morale after the Invergordon mutiny, an episode for which he had had no responsibility. In 1932&#150;4 he was commander-in-chief, America and West Indies, where he cruised widely in his flagship and did much to promote friendly relations with the United States navy. He was promoted vice-admiral in 1932 and admiral in 1936, having been appointed CB in 1928 and KCB in 1934. In 1935&#150;8 he served as commander-in-chief, Plymouth. In 1939 he headed the British section of the ineffectual Anglo-French military mission to Russia to attempt to gain agreement on opposition to German aggression. But John Weitz wrote of this mission that it &#145;had no real power to negotiate &hellip; Drax was, politically speaking, a eunuch&#146;  (Weitz, 195). The British and French were outmanoeuvred by Ribbentrop, the German foreign minister, who negotiated a Russo-German treaty of non-aggression while Drax's group was engaged in vague staff talks in Leningrad.<br>
<br>In 1939&#150;41 Drax was commander-in-chief at the Nore. He was involved in the evacuation of British troops from Dunkirk and the preparation of defensive measures for the anticipated German invasion. In 1941 Drax retired and returned to his estates in Dorset where he served as a private in the Home Guard. In the spring of 1943 he volunteered for duty as a commodore of convoy and served until 1945, with the distinction of never losing a ship.<br>
<br>Drax was in many ways a radical, with his belief in the study of war and promotion of new ideas, and the additional concern he exhibited for the welfare, and training, of junior officers and men. In retirement he remained busy with the management of his estates at Charborough Park, near Wareham, Dorset, and wrote articles on a range of subjects. He developed ideas for the solar-heated swimming pool. He died in Poole, Dorset, on 16 October 1967.<br>
