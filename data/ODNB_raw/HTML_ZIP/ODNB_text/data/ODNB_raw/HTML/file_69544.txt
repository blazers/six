<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Glennie,  George</span>  (1818&#150;1886), <span class="occ">golfer</span>, was born in Glasgow. Trained as a civil engineer, he became manager of the Monkland Canal Company, Montrose, and was then sent to England to help run the London operation of the General Iron Foundry Ltd. Already a prominent and successful member of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club at St Andrews, he was elected in October 1853 to the Royal Blackheath Golf Club, the English society that claims to have its origins in the playing of golf on Blackheath in the reign of King James VI and I.<br>
<br>At Blackheath Glennie swiftly established himself as among the &#145;cracks&#146; of the club. He won the first of eight Blackheath scratch medals in 1854, served as captain of the club in 1862 and 1863, and as honorary secretary and treasurer from 1868 until his death in 1886. Under his benign guidance the influence of Blackheath golf and golfers was felt throughout the game, spreading to the nascent North Devon Golf Club at Westward Ho! (where from 1865 to 1867 he won the first three scratch medals), to the Liverpool club at Hoylake, and elsewhere. During the period of Glennie's stewardship, almost no club of any significance was formed south of the Scottish border that did not owe something to the influence and enthusiasm of the Blackheath club. Much was due to Glennie's own considerable personal qualities: H. S. C. Everard wrote that<blockquote>At Blackheath, at St Andrews and Westward Ho!, wherever he played he commanded admiration no less for the excellence of his play than for the qualities which rendered him such a charming partner or opponent &hellip; His play was characterized by extraordinary precision rather than commanding power. (Everard, 209)</blockquote>Another contemporary, McPherson, said of Glennie that &#145;He played every stroke as if it were the stroke of the match. Exactness was, therefore, with him second nature; he could not afford to foozle &hellip; No keener golfer ever lived, no finer gentleman ever walked&#146;  (Behrend, Lewis, and Mackie, 140).<br>
<br>Glennie had continued to make regular visits to Scotland from his London base, and in 1855 won the royal (autumn) medal of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club with a record score of 88 strokes; a score not beaten for another twenty-six years. He had already won the silver cross, the principal spring prize of the Royal and Ancient, in 1851. But perhaps his greatest achievement at St Andrews was on behalf of the Blackheath club, when, in July 1857, he and Captain J. C. Stewart of Fasnacloich and the 72nd highlanders cruised to victory in the great (inter-club) golf tournament, defeating their hosts from the Royal and Ancient in the final. As a result, Blackheath was declared &#145;the champion Club of the World&#146;. In his native Scotland Glennie also won important competitions at Prestwick (of which he was captain in 1876) and at the Royal Burgess club in Edinburgh. As a player he was unorthodox but highly effective, falling forward onto the ball and hitting his iron shots with a distinct left-to-right break on pitching: by the standards of the day, his putting was also unusual, addressing the ball smoothly in the centre of the stance (rather than essaying the very wristy stroke off the right foot then fashionable).<br>
<br>Blackheath were anxious to honour their long-standing secretary and champion, and in 1881 two medals were cast in Glennie's name, one to be competed for by their own members and the other to be presented (in secret from Glennie himself) to the Royal and Ancient Golf Club. The George Glennie medal remains among the most prestigious of all of the trophies of the game's governing body, awarded to the individual with the two best scratch scores combined from the spring and autumn meetings of the Royal and Ancient. Glennie had himself received the ultimate golfing accolade, captaincy of the Royal and Ancient, in 1884.<br>
<br>Following an operation on a cancerous tumour of the neck, Glennie died, unmarried, at his home, 3 St Germans Place, Blackheath, Kent, on 26 March 1886, and was buried at Shooter's Hill cemetery on 31 March. The members of the Royal Blackheath Golf Club subscribed to a memorial stone over his grave. One of the greatest and most influential figures of Victorian golf, Glennie was among a handful of individuals responsible for the spread of the ancient Scottish game throughout the British Isles and thence to the rest of the world. &#145;None was ever imbued with a more whole-hearted devotion to the game; none ever more earnestly, if unobtrusively, upheld the integrity of its interests and traditions&#146;  (Everard, 209).<br>
