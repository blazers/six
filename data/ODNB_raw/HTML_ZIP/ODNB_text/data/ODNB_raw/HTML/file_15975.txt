<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lander,  Richard Lemon</span>  (1804&#150;1834), <span class="occ">traveller in Africa</span>, was born on 8 February 1804 at Truro, Cornwall, the third son of John Lander, innkeeper, and his wife, Mary Penrose. The fourth of six children, he was educated under a Mr Pascoe in Coombe Lane, Truro, until at thirteen he went out with a merchant to the West Indies. Here he had an attack of malaria in San Domingo which was said to have helped him resist the disease later in Africa. He returned home in 1818 and was servant to several wealthy families in London with whom he travelled in Europe. In 1823 he went to Cape Colony as servant to Major W. M. G. Colebrooke. After travelling through the colony with Colebrooke, Lander returned home in 1824.<br>
<br>Public interest in the African discoveries of Clapperton and Denham led Lander to offer his services to Clapperton, refusing better paid employment in South America. With Clapperton he went to west Africa and was his devoted servant during this, his last expedition. They sailed in the <i>Brazen</i> in August 1825, reaching Badagri and thence heading inland, experiencing much sickness and privation <i>en route</i>. They crossed the Niger and went on as far as Sokoto where Clapperton died in 1827. Despite his own severe illness, Lander made his way back to the coast, reporting Clapperton's death to Denham who sent the news to England. Lander followed with Clapperton's papers, arriving at Portsmouth in April 1828. He made his way to Truro in poor health and was initially unable to edit Clapperton's <span class="italic">Journal</span> which appeared in 1829 with Lander's own <span class="italic">Journal</span> appended. In 1830 with the help of his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15974/', "John Lander")</script>, Richard produced an edited version in two volumes. While in England, on 24 August 1828 he married Anne Hughes, daughter of a London merchant, at St Margaret's, Westminster. They had a daughter and a son who died in infancy.<br>
<br>Dissatisfied with the menial job he had obtained at the customs' house, and at the instance of Lord Bathurst, Lander undertook another expedition to trace the source and course of the Niger. He arranged that his wife receive &pound;100 a year from the government during his absence and that he get &pound;100 on his return. With his brother John he left Portsmouth on 9 January 1830 and reached Cape Coast (now in Ghana) on 22 February. Travelling via Accra and Badagri, they reached Bussa on 17 June, and thence went upstream for about 100 miles to Yelwa, the furthest point reached by the expedition. They returned to Bussa on 2 August 1830 and headed downstream in canoes with no idea where they would end up. At Kerre they were robbed and nearly killed by the locals and at Igbo Ora were imprisoned by the king who demanded a heavy ransom which was obtained only after long delay. Eventually they got through the forested delta to find that the Nun distributary flowed into the Gulf of Guinea on the Atlantic coast. This settled the vexed question of the course and outlet of the Niger which many had thought flowed inland to Lake Chad. On 1 December 1830 the brothers reached Fernando Po (Bioko) and thence arrived home in 1831.<br>
<br>The Landers, particularly Richard, were greeted with much enthusiasm: Richard became the first gold medallist of the Royal Geographical Society and John Murray, the publisher, gave them &pound;1000 for their journals. Lacking formal education, the brothers were not thought capable of editing the journals themselves, and they were instead (badly) edited by A. B. Becher and published as <span class="italic">Journal of an Expedition to &hellip; the Niger</span> (3 vols., 1832); a good later edition is that by Hallet (1965). The work was immediately popular and editions appeared in Dutch, French, German, Italian, and Swedish.<br>
<br>Lander took a position at the customs' office in Liverpool until, early in 1832, some merchants in the city led by Macgregor Laird formed a company to send an expedition under Lander to open up trade with the countries of central Africa by establishing the Niger as a trade route. The expedition was furnished with two finely built and fitted vessels, the <i>Quorra</i> and the <i>Alburkah</i>, which were among the first ocean-going steamers. They were supported by the brig <i>Columbine</i> which carried coals and goods. Lander started from Milford Haven on 25 July and reached Cape Coast after many delays on 7 October 1832. Illness and numerous other difficulties delayed progress, but the steamers managed to get some way up the Niger before returning to Fernando Po for fresh supplies. Leaving the steamers in charge of Surgeon Oldfield, Lander returned to the Nun mouth and began going upstream. At Angiama his party was fired on and pursued by local middlemen who wanted to see European traders remain on the coast, rather than establish bases inland and thus cut out the middlemen. Lander, who normally got on well with Africans, received a shot which entered his body near the anus and lodged deep in his thigh. He was taken as quickly as possible to Fernando Po, where, the shot being lodged too deeply to be removed, the wound went gangrenous and he died on 6 February 1834 at the house of the commandant. He was buried in the Clarence cemetery, Fernando Po. The story of the expedition was told in <span class="italic">Narrative of an Expedition into the Interior of Africa</span> by Macgregor Laird and R. A. K. Oldfield (1835). Lander's fate was shared by most of the Europeans on the expedition who succumbed mainly to malaria, although contemporaries attributed their deaths to the unhealthy climate. Macgregor Laird lost his entire fortune although not his life. The failure of the expedition considerably dampened the enthusiasm for trade with west Africa which Lander's first expedition had helped to raise.<br>
<br>The various monuments raised to Lander had unhappy fates. That erected by his wife and daughter in the Savoy chapel was destroyed by fire on 7 July 1864. The stained-glass window erected to replace it by the Royal Geographical Society was destroyed by bombing in the Second World War. A memorial erected in Lemon Street, Truro, in 1835 fell down in 1836&#151;its replacement was still standing in the 1990s. His grave in Fernando Po fell into disrepair until an outcry in 1910 ensured a new monument was erected in the Roman Catholic cemetery there.<br>
<br>A government pension of &pound;70 a year was given to Lander's wife and a gratuity of &pound;80 to his daughter. In person he was very short and fair. His journals show him to have been intelligent and perceptive, despite his lack of formal education, and devoutly religious. Strong and healthy, his bravery and resoluteness fitted him ideally for African travel, although he lacked the middle-class background and officer training of the stereotypical African explorer. His discovery that the Niger flowed into the Atlantic was hailed by contemporaries as an event of cardinal importance since it opened up the whole of central Africa to commerce and ultimately to settlement.<br>
