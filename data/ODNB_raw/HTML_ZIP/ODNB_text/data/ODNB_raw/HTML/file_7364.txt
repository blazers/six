<span class="headword">Day,  George</span>  (<em>c.</em>1502&#150;1556), <span class="occ">bishop of Chichester</span>, was the third son of Richard Day, gentleman, of Newport, Shropshire, and Agnes Osborne, and the elder brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7373/', "William Day (1529&#150;1596)")</script>. Early in 1521 he graduated BA from St John's College, Cambridge, the centre of humanism in the university. The following year he became a fellow, and in 1523 he had two short Latin verses printed in the treatise <span class="italic">Assertionis Lutheranae confutatio</span>, published by the university chancellor, John Fisher, bishop of Rochester, a co-founder of his college; these were his only published works. Having proceeded MA in 1524, he became first Linacre professor of medicine in 1525, and then the college praelector in Greek. Early in 1528 he became public orator to the university.<br>
<br>Ordained deacon at Lincoln on 7 March that year, Day became chaplain to Fisher. The bishop perceptively observed in 1534, however, that Day &#145;studies to obtain the goodwill of both sides&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 8.859). As orator he wrote the university's decree in support of the royal supremacy, and in spite of his connection with Fisher he was appointed a royal chaplain. From 1537, although vice-chancellor that year, he was often at court. Henry VIII gave Day the sapphire ring he later bequeathed to Archbishop Nicholas Heath, and royal influence was responsible for his appointments on 27 July 1537 as master of St John's, in September to the livings of Holsworthy, Devon, and All Hallows-the-Great, London, and then on 5 June 1538 as provost of King's College, Cambridge. Although he held no secular offices, he served on important ecclesiastical commissions. In November 1538 he was one of the theologians nominated to revise the articles in the <span class="roman">Bishops' Book</span> on the ten commandments, justification, and purgatory, and the same month was called to express the king's views at the trial for heresy of John Lambert. The following year the king wrote in his name as bishop of the proposed new diocese of Dunstable. In 1540 he was a member of the committee on doctrine, in February 1542 he was among those appointed to correct the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in the short-lived plan to revise the <span class="roman">Great Bible</span>, and he was a member of the team responsible for the conservative article on justification in the <span class="roman">King's Book</span> (1543). He was further rewarded with prebends in Beverley College, York, and St Stephen's, Westminster, acquiring the latter on 23 March 1543.<br>
<br>When three weeks later, on 15 April, he was nominated as bishop of Chichester, Day resigned all his benefices, but kept the provostship of King's, by royal dispensation. He was installed by proxy but he usually resided and conducted regular visitations. In 1544 he and Bishop Nicholas Heath drew up the statutes for the cathedrals of the new foundation. In July 1545, by now almoner to Queen Katherine, he with others investigated the distribution of funds for the relief of the poor and maintenance of highways, and in the following July he was one of those appointed to nominate the recipients of these funds. In November he participated in a commission to investigate the alleged bigamy of Sir Ralph Sadler's wife. When early in 1546 Archbishop Thomas Cranmer suggested to Henry VIII that Day's endorsement of the abolition of certain ceremonies would make them more generally acceptable, Day duly acquiesced. That February he served on the commission to survey chantries in Sussex, Surrey, and Southwark.<br>
<br>The new reign began well enough for Day when his gift of books to the king earned from the young Edward VI praise for his learning. However, early in 1547 he criticized the fellows of King's for discontinuing private masses, and he resigned as provost before April 1548. He was not present on 9 September when Robert Ferrar became the first bishop to be consecrated according to the rites of the newly introduced English ordinal. His answers to Cranmer's questionnaire of 1548 on the sacraments upheld traditionalist views, except for an ambivalent response about the sacrificial aspect of the mass. Though he had opposed the order of communion of 1548, he enforced its use in his diocese. Later that year he was involved with the draft English prayer book but he objected to parts of it. He regularly attended the Lords, where in opposing most of the religious legislation of the reign he publicly identified himself with the conservative viewpoint, most notably in the debates on the eucharist in December 1548 when he audaciously cited the executed Bishop Fisher and spoke in support of transubstantiation. In January 1549 he voted against the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> and continued to oppose changes in religion except for the <span class="roman">Act on Fast Days</span> of 1549. In April 1549 he was appointed to a commission to investigate radical heresies, but he does not seem to have been an active member. In April 1550, possibly in response to the threat of deprivation, he preached a sermon against transubstantiation. Though the following October he cleared himself against a charge of seditious preaching, he was summoned before the council in November and December for his refusal to replace altars with tables in churches in his diocese. He was committed to the Fleet prison on 11 December, and deprived on 10 October 1551. In January 1552 he rejected an offer from the secretary of state William Cecil (another St John's man) to free him if he would accept the removal of altars. In June he was transferred to the custody of the chancellor, Thomas Goodrich, bishop of Ely, possibly through the intervention of Sir John Cheke, his former pupil (his &#145;bringer-upp &hellip; in learning&#146;; Nichols, clxi) and his successor as provost of King's. Cheke, now a royal tutor, had praised Day's learning and loyalty to the crown.<br>
<br>Immediately after Mary's accession, Day was released on 4 August 1553. A distinguished preacher, he was the queen's choice to preach at the funeral of Edward VI on 8 August. His provocative sermon praised the late king but attacked the religious politics of Edward's regime. By 29 September 1553 he was the queen's almoner, and on 1 October he preached at her coronation. In March 1554 he was appointed to the commissions to deprive protestant bishops. In November 1555 during a visit to John Bradford he confessed that fresh from the university, he &#145;went with the word&#146; but &#145;it was always against my conscience&#146;, although he acknowledged that he approved communion in two kinds for the laity  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 7.176 and 178). That year he was involved in the examinations of Bishop John Hooper, John Philpot, and others. The extent of his involvement in the executions for heresy in his diocese is not clear. He died in London on 2 August 1556 and was buried in Chichester Cathedral. In his will, drawn up on 28 July, he placed his hope for salvation on the merits of the blood and death of Jesus Christ, but did not invoke the saints. To his successors at Chichester he left his mitre and crosier, and to the cathedral a new vestment of red silk, chalices and matching pattens, and &pound;40 to buy a silver cross. St John's College library received a copy of the trilingual Complutensian polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and King's the works of Chrysostom and Clement of Alexandria. Apart from Archbishop Heath, other beneficiaries included the bishop of Ely, Day's four brothers, Roger, William, Thomas of Ford, and Thomas, precentor of Chichester, and his &#145;mother-in-law&#146; (stepmother), Johane Day, and her daughter Johane.<br>
