<span class="headword">Bowman,  John Eddowes, the elder</span>  (1785&#150;1841), <span class="occ">naturalist</span>, was born on 30 October 1785 at Nantwich, where his father, Eddowes Bowman (1758&#150;1844), was a tobacconist. A studious child, he was educated at grammar school. His father gave him a taste for botany, and his friend Joseph Hunter (1783&#150;1861), a fondness for genealogy. He initially worked in his father's shop, becoming manager of the manufacturing department, and later traveller. Having been dissuaded by his father from becoming a minister of the Unitarian church, to which his family belonged, in 1813 he joined, as junior partner, a banking business which his father had entered. Its failure in 1816 left him penniless, and he became manager at Welshpool of a branch of the bank of Beck &amp; Co. of Shrewsbury. In 1824 he became managing partner of a bank at Wrexham, and was able to retire from business in 1830.<br>
<br>From 1837 Bowman lived in Manchester, where he pursued his interests in science. He was a fellow of the Linnean and Geological societies, and one of the founders of the Manchester Geological Society. He was chiefly interested in mosses, fungi, and parasitical plants. A minute fossil, which he detected in Derbyshire, is named after him <i>Endothyra bowmanni</i>. In the latter part of his life he devoted himself almost entirely to geology.<br>
<br>On 6 July 1809, Bowman married his cousin, Elizabeth (1788&#150;1859), daughter of W. Eddowes of Shrewsbury. The couple had a daughter who died in 1838 and four sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3076/', "Eddowes Bowman (1810&#150;1869)")</script>, <a href="#cosubject_3078">Henry Bowman [<i>see below</i>]</a>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3082/', "William Bowman (1816&#150;1892)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3080/', "John Eddowes Bowman the younger (1819&#150;1856)")</script>. Bowman died on 4 December 1841 in Manchester.<br>
