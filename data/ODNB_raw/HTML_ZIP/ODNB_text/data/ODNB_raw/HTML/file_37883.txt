<span class="headword">Ramsey,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1349), <span class="occ">master mason</span>, belonged to a family which included several master masons active in Norwich and London in the first half of the fourteenth century. He is first documented in 1323 and 1325 working as an ordinary cutting mason at St Stephen's Chapel in Westminster Palace. Between 1326 and 1336 he and his brother John visited the works of the cloister at Norwich Cathedral priory as consultant master masons. On 23 November 1331 William and his wife, Christina, along with others including two other men named Ramsey and a priest, were accused of going to the house of John Spray without Aldersgate for the purpose of abducting Spray's ward Robert Huberd and marrying him to William's daughter Agnes. William and the rest were acquitted of the abduction and the fourteen-year-old Huberd, heir to the considerable property of his father, a minter, chose to stay with Ramsey, who became his guardian in succession to Spray. Within a few months Ramsey had been appointed master mason of the new chapter house and cloister of St Paul's Cathedral, and on 13 July 1332 the city exempted him from sitting on assizes and from jury service in order to enable him to concentrate wholly on that work. Along with the remodelling of the south transept of what is now Gloucester Cathedral (<i>c</i>.1331&#150;7), these destroyed but fairly well recorded buildings were the earliest example of the Perpendicular style of architecture. The influence of the cloister was to be felt in London and south-east England for at least the next half-century, most obviously in the south cloister walk of Westminster Abbey (begun in 1344), which is merely an enlarged copy of the St Paul's design, and most notably in the nave of Canterbury Cathedral (begun after 1381), whose piers are a most ingenious application of the system embodied in the St Paul's vault responds.<br>
<br>Ramsey's position, that of master mason of the most prestigious building then in progress in the city of London, probably accounts for his being appointed in 1335 to a commission to inquire into the state of the Tower of London. The impending war with France was the background to this investigation and to Ramsey's appointment for life on 1 June 1336 as both chief mason in the Tower of London and chief surveyor of the king's works of masonry there and at all the other king's castles south of the River Trent. His most architecturally significant contribution to the Tower was the remodelling in 1336&#150;8 of the great hall (destroyed). From February 1344 he had charge of the masonry work at Windsor Castle, where a &#145;Round Table&#146; 200 feet in diameter was under construction for Edward III's projected order of chivalry. This work ceased in November of the same year and was subsequently destroyed. By 1337, when Ramsey took charge of the works of St Stephen's Chapel, Westminster, his royal responsibilities were evidently regarded as extending beyond castles to encompass all masonry work south of the Trent. The main opportunity for executing a new design at St Stephen's was the upper storey of the west porch (destroyed after 1834). Although in the Perpendicular style, this structure matched in its exceptional richness the fifty-year-old design of the main chapel to which it led. In the field of decorative architecture it was to exert an influence as powerful and enduring as that which the cloister of St Paul's had exercised on the more monumental genres. As late as the 1450s the London mason Richard Beke incorporated numerous quotations from the St Stephen's porch into the choir screen of Canterbury Cathedral.<br>
<br>Ramsey's royal work coexisted with a private practice which may well have been extensive, like that of other leading royal architects of the late middle ages. Unfortunately, the only documented episode is his appointment on 23 May 1337 to advise on the works of the eastern arm of Lichfield Cathedral. The resulting design of the main vessel of the presbytery took account of the earlier work on the site and did not include the innovatory Perpendicular tracery used at St Paul's. Ramsey may also have been heavily involved in the profitable business of tomb making, but his only documented works of this kind are the marble tomb-chest of Blanche of the Tower (an infant daughter of Edward III) in 1343, and the now-destroyed monumental brass over the grave of Abbot Thomas Henley (<i>d</i>. 1344), both in Westminster Abbey. Stylistic evidence indicates that Ramsey was the designer of the outstandingly splendid canopied tombs of Edward III's younger brother John of Eltham (<i>d</i>. 1336), at Westminster, and Archbishop John Stratford (<i>d</i>. 1348), at Canterbury.<br>
<br>Ramsey died at the height of the black death, within a few days of 29 May 1349. His daughter Agnes, the child of his marriage to Christina, later submitted accounts to the exchequer which showed that over half the fees and robes due to him as king's chief mason had never been paid. This indication that Ramsey was prosperous enough to be able to live and conduct his business without depending on his official pay, is borne out by the size of his contribution&#151;&pound;10&#151;to the &pound;5000 loan made by the city of London to Edward III in 1340. In 1347 he served as a common councillor for Aldersgate Ward.<br>
