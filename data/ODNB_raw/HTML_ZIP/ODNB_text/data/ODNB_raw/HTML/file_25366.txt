She was taken by her parents in 1813 to the Cape of Good Hope, whence, after her father's death on 12 September 1817, she returned to England, where she grew up in an apartment in Hampton Court Palace. At seventeen she became engaged to Commander Price Blackwood (1794&#150;1841), the youngest of three sons of Hans, Lord Dufferin, and Mehetabel Temple; owing to the deaths of his brothers, he was heir to the title and estate in Ireland of Baron Dufferin and Claneboye. His parents opposed the marriage, on financial grounds. Hence, after their wedding at St George's, Hanover Square, London, on 4 July 1825, the young couple went to Italy. They lived in Florence, where their only child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31914/', "Frederick Temple Hamilton-Temple Blackwood, subsequently marquess of Dufferin and Ava")</script>, was born on 21 June 1826.<br>
<br>After two years they returned to England, and lived in a cottage at Thames Ditton. When visiting her sisters, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20339/', "Mrs Caroline Norton")</script> and Lady Seymour, in London, Helen Blackwood was introduced to the world of wit and fashion in which they moved, and there she made the acquaintance of the Misses Berry, Samuel Rogers, Henry Taylor, Brougham, Lockhart, Sydney Smith, and Benjamin Disraeli. Her husband succeeded his father as Baron Dufferin and Claneboye in the peerage of Ireland in November 1839, and he died on 21 July 1841, on board the <i>Reindeer</i>, off Belfast, aged forty-seven, from an overdose of morphia, taken inadvertently.<br>
<br>Lady Dufferin dedicated herself to her son, with whom she enjoyed a particularly close relationship. A trip up the Nile in his company led to the publication, in 1863, of <span class="italic">Lispings from Low Latitudes, or, Extracts from the Journal of the Hon. Impulsia Gushington</span>, in which she made fun of the genre of travel writing. She also wrote a play called <span class="italic">Finesse, or, A Busy Day in Messina</span>, which was first performed at the Haymarket Theatre in 1863. The acting of John Baldwin Buckstone and Alfred Wigan contributed to a highly successful run. She neither acknowledged the authorship, nor attended any performance. Her songs and verses were published anonymously, the first dating from her girlhood. Her earliest publication was a collection of songs written with her sister Caroline, for which they were paid &pound;100. She also published several volumes of songs and ballads, the most successful of which were &#145;The Irish Emigrant&#146; (1845) and &#145;Terence's Farewell&#146; (1840).<br>
<br>George Hay, earl of Gifford (1822&#150;1862) and son and heir of the marquess of Tweeddale, had been a friend and suitor for some fifteen years when in 1862 he was seriously injured by holding back a stone which was falling on some of his workmen. They were married on 13 October 1862, at Dufferin Lodge, in London, and he died there on 22 December. Lady Dufferin explained her motives to Gifford's father: &#145;[It] gives me the right to devote every hour and every day God spares him to his comfort and relief, and &hellip; the right to mourn him openly&#146;  (Dufferin, memoir). She died five years later from breast cancer, on 13 June 1867 at Dufferin Lodge, and was buried with her second husband at Friern Barnet, Middlesex.<br>
