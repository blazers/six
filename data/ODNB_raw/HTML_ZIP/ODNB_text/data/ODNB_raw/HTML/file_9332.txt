<span class="headword">Fergusson,  George</span>, Lord Hermand  (1743&#150;1827), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 25 August 1743 at Kilkerran, near Dailly, Ayrshire, the thirteenth of the fourteen children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9333/', "Sir James Fergusson of Kilkerran, second baronet (bap. 1688, d. 1759)")</script>, senator of the college of justice as Lord Kilkerran, and his wife, Jean Maitland (1703&#150;1766), only child of James, Viscount Maitland, and granddaughter of John Maitland, fifth earl of Lauderdale. The Fergussons belonged to the ancient native gentry of south-west Scotland, and had been established at Kilkerran since at least the fifteenth century.<br>
<br>After private tuition in Ayrshire and Edinburgh and a year at school in Edinburgh (1755&#150;6), Fergusson went to the University of Edinburgh, to study logic and metaphysics, humanity, and Greek (1756&#150;8), and then law (1763&#150;5). Like his father and his grandfather he pursued a legal career, being admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates in December 1765. He had a successful career at the bar, and was appointed a commissary of Edinburgh in November 1775, a position which he retained until his elevation to the court of session in July 1799 as Lord Hermand. He, rather than his eldest brother, Adam, was probably responsible for editing and publishing his father's collection of decisions of the court of session from 1738 to 1752  (<span class="italic">Kilkerran's Decisions</span>, 1775). He also made a valuable collection of the decisions of the commissary court of Edinburgh from 1684 to 1777 which, though not published until 1940, when it was edited by F. P. Walton for the Stair Society as <span class="italic">Lord Hermand's Consistorial Decisions</span>, was consulted in manuscript, and relied on by James Fergusson for his <span class="italic">Reports of some Recent Decisions by the Consistorial Courts of Scotland</span> (1817).<br>
<br>Lord Hermand was a strong advocate of agricultural improvement, and took his judicial title from his country estate of Hermand (formerly Herdmansheills) at West Calder in Linlithgowshire. He also maintained a keen interest in Ayrshire politics, and supported his brother, Sir Adam Fergusson, MP for Ayrshire (and later for Edinburgh), a tory in the Dundas interest. Lord Hermand was also appointed a lord of justiciary in August 1808, and he held both his judicial offices until his resignation in 1826.<br>
<br>It is, however, for his eccentricities of behaviour, and his legendary capacity for drink, as memorialized by Lord Cockburn, that Lord Hermand is now best remembered. Cockburn describes Hermand as having &#145;a sincere respect for drinking, indeed a high moral approbation, and a serious compassion for the poor wretches who could not indulge in it; with due contempt for those who could, but did not&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memorials</span>, 134). One anecdote told by Cockburn relates to an informal supper held after a day's judicial proceedings at Inveraray in 1808. Lords Hermand and Cullen, not on the best of terms socially, had been the judges.<blockquote>They were cold to each other at first, but at last liquor soldered them, and by two in the morning &hellip; they were embracing and vowing eternal friendship, and toasting each other's wives, and giving us young ones imitations of the old lawyers. I scarcely ever saw such a scene. But it was not unjudicial in those days. Cullen was in bed all next day, and never saw his own Circuit Court, but the immortal head of Hermand was clear and cool next morning at six, and after a few hours of business and a long sail, he returned to the charge at dinner with a picturesque and cordial exuberance of spirits which the concentrated kindness and gaiety of all Argyleshire could not have equalled. (Cockburn, <span class="italic">Circuit Journeys</span>, 88)</blockquote>No doubt Cockburn gilded the lily, but there is ample evidence of Hermand's eccentricities from other sources. Lord Hermand was a man of intense temperament and restless energy. His accent was distinctively Scottish, and his style of argument was direct and innocent of affectation.<br>
<br>Lord Hermand married late, on 23 December 1793, Graham (<i>d</i>. 1834), daughter of William MacDowall of Garthland. There were no children of the marriage. He died at Hermand on 9 August 1827, survived by his wife.<br>
