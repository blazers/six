<span class="headword">Croft,  (John) Michael</span>  (1922&#150;1986), <span class="occ">founder and director of the National Youth Theatre</span>, was born in Oswestry on 8 March 1922, the child of Constance Croft, who was unmarried. As a young child he moved with his elder sister to live with his mother's sister in Manchester, where he was educated at Burnage grammar school from 1933 to 1940. His adolescence was dominated by two passions, for literature (in particular, poetry, for which he had an almost photographic memory), and for team games. He played games with extreme gusto, but achieved a limited effectiveness only in cricket, the rich lore of which always fascinated him.<br>
<br>Croft had little satisfaction or security from his home. He soon developed an uncompromising individualism and volunteered for aircrew duties in the Royal Air Force in 1940. He became a sergeant-pilot and took part in daylight bombing raids over occupied France, but his manual dexterity proved unequal to the demands of flying, and he was offered the option of a discharge. He had a variety of casual occupations, as an actor, professional &#145;fire-watcher&#146; in air-raid precautions, credit salesman, and lumberjack, before he volunteered for the navy in 1943. After service in Mediterranean convoys, he finished the war as a radar operator on merchant ships.<br>
<br>In 1946 Croft went to Keble College, Oxford, to read English. He was a member of an exceptionally talented generation of former service students, and revelled in being able to indulge his love of literature, theatre, writing, and sport, while, at the same time, breaking university regulations by living in licensed premises. He took a special short-course degree and achieved a third class in English in 1948.<br>
<br>An unsettled period followed graduation. Croft did occasional journalism, poetry writing, broadcasting, and acting, and worked as a private tutor and a supply teacher. From teaching he gathered the material for his novel <span class="italic">Spare the Rod</span> (1954), a minor <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> among liberal educationists, which, after skirmishes with the British Board of Film Censors, was filmed in 1961 with Max Bygraves as the sexually ambivalent schoolteacher. He also wrote <span class="italic">Red Carpet to China</span> (1958). Croft's final teaching post was at Alleyn's School, Dulwich (1950&#150;55), where he staged a series of epic Shakespearian productions, involving the majority of the school's pupils, that aroused the interest of the London press and the professional theatre. His work was characterized by spectacle, vigour, commitment, and an unusual concern for verse speaking: he wanted to envelop everybody in his huge enthusiasm and to make them share his fascination with the works of Shakespeare. <span class="italic">Spare the Rod</span> gave him sufficient financial independence to resign from teaching, ostensibly to devote himself to writing, but it seems that he was persuaded by a group of former pupils, disconsolate at the loss of their Shakespeare play, to direct them in an out-of-term production of <span class="italic">Henry V</span> at Toynbee Hall in 1956. In effect, this was the first youth theatre production and it determined the course of the rest of his life. The venture was self-supporting: ticket sales and donations were the only funding until, in 1958, King George's Jubilee Fund gave a grant which was continuous. Subsequently, the British Council and the Department of Education and Science provided support. There was a long and fairly acrimonious battle with the Arts Council before any funding was secured, only for it to be withdrawn after a few years. By 1970 Croft was able to claim, &#145;We have three companies touring in Europe, four in London, and one in the north-east of England&#151;the whole being run by a full-time staff of four, with a handful of voluntary helpers.&#146; Ahead lay the televising and broadcasting of youth theatre productions, the commissioning of new works (significantly from Peter Terson and Barrie Keeffe in the 1970s), the visit to America, the acquiring of the Shaw Theatre (1971), and, in 1977, official recognition of the National Youth Theatre of Great Britain (NYTGB). Croft gained an increasing reputation as an internationally respected director, and his companies added to the lustrous reputation of the English theatre, but the NYTGB struggled against inadequate funding. He saw his creation as the victim of national parsimony to the arts and he became more obviously an abrasive, militant publicist, enjoying a bare-knuckle approach to negotiation. He had a flair for discovering stars, such as Derek Jacobi, Helen Mirren, Ben Kingsley, and Diana Quick.<br>
<br>Croft was appointed OBE in 1971. After the straitened circumstances of his early days, his later success introduced him to an expansive lifestyle, which he delighted in sharing generously with his vast number of friends and acquaintances. He was homosexual, but he had many friends of the opposite sex and, particularly in his early years, led a bisexual existence. He had few intimates, apparently finding it difficult to break down his core of loneliness. He was a man of gargantuan appetites in every way, especially for food and drink, and his eventual failure to control these proclivities, allied to a dread of surgery, contributed to his comparatively early death. He died of a heart attack at his home, 74 Bartholomew Road, Kentish Town, London, on 15 November 1986. A characteristic instruction in his will provided a party for a vetted list of some hundreds of his friends, &#145;at which the food shall be wholesome&#151;and the drink shall not be allowed to run out&#146;.<br>
