<span class="headword">Philips,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1734), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22121/', "George Philips (1629/30&#150;1696?)")</script>, writer and politician. The first reference to Captain William Philips records his succession to his father as burgess of Limavady on 17 April 1697  (Boyle, 40). He was later a tory member of the Irish parliament (1707&#150;11) and may also have been attach&eacute; to Sir Thomas Hanmer, speaker of the (British) House of Commons. Apparently a dabbler in verse, Philips turned playwright with <span class="italic">The Revengeful Queen</span> (1698), staged in London at Drury Lane in June 1698. In the printed text, dedicated to the Jacobite James Butler, second duke of Ormond, Philips defended himself against a charge that he had plagiarized Davenant's <span class="italic">The Tragedy of Albovine, King of the Lombards</span> (1629). Philips's next play was a comedy, <span class="italic">St Stephen's-Green, or, The Generous Lovers</span> (1700), staged, as the title-page indicates, at the Theatre Royal, Smock Alley, Dublin, <i>c</i>.1699, the first notable Irish play with a Dublin setting. Dedicated to William O'Brien, third earl of Inchiquin, this play shows the marks of the recent shift from the bawdy excesses of Restoration comedy, condemned by Jeremy Collier and others in the later 1690s, towards a more refined, more moral concept of drama. In timely fashion, in his epistle dedicatory Philips sides with O'Brien's wish that the stage be reformed towards &#145;Encouraging Virtue, and Exposing Vice&#146;. In other respects <span class="italic">St Stephen's-Green</span> is a lively Restoration comedy, with some interesting topical references, as its revival on the Abbey stage for the Dublin millennium in 1988 revealed.<br>
<br>After a considerable interval Philips's <span class="italic">Hibernia Freed</span> (1722) was staged on 13 February 1722 at the Theatre Royal, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London. A tragedy, dedicated to Henry O'Brien, eighth earl of Thomond, this play dealt with O'Brien's ancestors' struggle against viking invaders. It would appear that allegory was intended, in the wake of the passing of the <span class="roman">Declaratory Act</span> in 1720 which asserted the right of the British parliament to pass legislation binding on Ireland. The fervour of Philips's dedicatory letter to O'Brien, which asked &#145;for what is so noble as to free ones Country from Tyranny and Invasion?&#146;, marks Philips as an Irish &#145;patriot&#146; of the day. The play had a strong Irish cast, with James Quin as Turgesius, and, having had seven performances, seems to have been well received. It was also staged once in Dublin in 1722. <span class="italic">Hibernia Freed</span> stands out as one of the few Irish history plays of note in the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>Philips's next production, <span class="italic">Belisarius</span> (1724), though also a history play, had nothing overtly Irish about it. Yet a radical intention is perhaps suggested by the use of the same venue as <span class="italic">Hibernia Freed</span>, Lincoln's Inn Fields, where it ran for six nights from 14 April and was revived within a year. The play tells the story of a victorious Gothic soldier who ended up blind and destitute under the emperor Justinian. Philips dedicated the tragedy to General Webb, whom he seemed to relate to his hero Belisarius. It may be that there was a contemporary political reference here and that Philips moved among radical circles in London, for his name appears in Swift's correspondence at this time. In addition Philips was attempting to keep blank-verse tragedy alive at a very bad time for English drama. In that regard <span class="italic">Belisarius</span> was a worthy effort, though Philips may have been overambitious in his concern to:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">reform the Stage,<br>
</div>
<div>Improve our Judgment, and refine the Age.<br>
</div> (prologue, lines 25&#150;6)</blockquote>Philips seems also to have been the author of <span class="italic">The Romance of the Rose: Imitated from Chaucer</span> (1721), published anonymously by Jonah Bowyer, who also published <span class="italic">Hibernia Freed</span>. This poem contains two passages in praise of Hanmer, and the copy presented by the author to the library of Worcester College, Oxford, on 15 February 1720, ascribes the poem to Captain Philips. While it may be that there was more than one William Philips at this time, one is inclined to believe that playwright and poet were the same man. Philips died in London on 12 December 1734.<br>
