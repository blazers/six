<span class="headword">Cooley,  Thomas</span>  (1740/41&#150;1784), <span class="occ">architect</span>, is said to have been born in England; his parentage is unknown. He was apprenticed to a London carpenter named Reynolds, and subsequently became clerk to William Grenell, master joiner in the office of works. By 1763 he had become a pupil of Robert Mylne and by 1765 he was working as Mylne's clerk. Cooley reputedly devoted all his spare time to the study of architecture: he competed for premiums awarded by the Society of Arts, winning third prize in 1763 and second prize in 1764 and 1765. He also exhibited designs at the Free Society of Artists between 1765 and 1768.<br>
<br>In March 1769 Cooley won the Dublin Royal Exchange competition, a success which, according to Dublin rumour, was due to Mylne's influence with the committee. He moved to Dublin to supervise the execution of the exchange and settled in the city for the rest of his life. In 1775 he succeeded Joseph Jarratt as clerk and inspector of civil buildings at the barrack board. He enjoyed the patronage of Richard Robinson, archbishop of Armagh, who employed him as his architect for building projects in the city and diocese of Armagh: these included the archbishop's palace (1770), the public library (1771), the royal school (1774), and the gaol (1780). It was to Cooley's office that Robinson sent the young Francis Johnston from Armagh to train in the profession; after Cooley's death Johnston succeeded him as the primate's architect. In Dublin itself, in addition to the Royal Exchange, Cooley designed the chapel of the Hibernian Military School in Phoenix Park (1771), Newgate prison (1773&#150;81), and the north and west ranges of the west court of the Four Courts, begun in 1776 and completed after his death by James Gandon. His two major country house commissions were Caledon House, co. Tyrone (1779), for James Alexander, later first earl of Caledon, and Rokeby Hall, co. Louth, designed shortly before his death for Archbishop Robinson and carried out by Francis Johnston. His participation also seems to have been crucial in the design of Ardbraccan, co. Meath (1773&#150;5), for Henry Maxwell, bishop of Meath.<br>
<br>When Gandon arrived in Ireland in 1781, he pronounced that Cooley and Thomas Ivory were the only two architects &#145;properly so called&#146;  (Mulvany, 49&#150;50) in Dublin. In Cooley's architecture the richness and elaboration of the Dublin Royal Exchange, a domed structure with a giant Corinthian order on two fa&ccedil;ades, is unique. A rational sobriety prevails in his other buildings: their quality depends on interval and balance, and their restrained style prepares the visitor for interiors which often exhibit a sophisticated manipulation of architectural elements and an innovative elegance of detail unmatched by other Irish architects of the time.<br>
<br>Cooley was said to have &#145;supported an unimpeached character for integrity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span>) but was also thought to be supercilious. He died of a bilious fever in Anglesea Street, Dublin, in 1784 in his forty-fourth year, leaving a son, William, and a daughter; his wife had predeceased him in January 1779. His collection of books, drawings, prints, antique medals, a camera obscura, and other items was sold at auction in April 1784. William Cooley married Emily, daughter of his father's executor, the sculptor Richard Cranfield; their son Thomas Cooley (1795?&#150;1872) was a portrait painter in Dublin.<br>
