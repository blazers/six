<span class="headword">Relph,  Michael Leighton George</span>  (1915&#150;2004), <span class="occ">film producer and production designer</span>, was born at Riffelberg, Broadstone, Dorset, on 16 February 1915, the son of George Walton Relph (1888&#150;1960), a distinguished stage and screen actor, and his wife, Deborah Caroline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nansen (later Harker), a former actress who subsequently ran Old Times Furnishing, a theatrical and film supply company. He was educated at Bembridge School, Isle of Wight, after which, at the age of sixteen, he spent six months working as a jackaroo on a sheep-station in north-western Australia. His maternal grandfather had been attorney-general of Western Australia and Relph accompanied his grandmother when she returned to live there.<br>
<br>When he returned to England Relph was accepted into the apprenticeship scheme set up by a family friend, the producer Michael Balcon, at Gaumont-British Studios, Elstree, where the legendary German designer Alfred Junge headed the art department and strongly influenced the young Relph. The latter became assistant art director, first at Elstree, then at Warner Brothers studios in Teddington, where he shared art-director credits with Peter Proud on such films as the &#145;quota quickies&#146; <span class="italic">Who Killed John Savage?</span> (1937) and <span class="italic">Many Tanks, Mr Atkins</span> (1938), and, more notably, on Arthur Woods's well-regarded crime drama <span class="italic">They Drive by Night</span> (1939). On 27 September 1939 he married Doris Gosden (1904&#150;1978), the divorced wife of John Montague Gosden and daughter of James Ringwood, licensed victualler. They had one son, Simon (<i>b</i>. 1940), who became a major force in British cinema in the later twentieth century, as a producer and industry figure. Relph's first marriage ended in divorce, and on 22 September 1950 he married Marie Rose Law (1919/20&#150;2003), the divorced wife of Michael Evelyn Murray Law and daughter of Gerald Woolman, accountant. They had one daughter, Emma, who acted in several films in the 1980s.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1940s Relph was in demand as a stage designer. He won a reputation for his versatility, his range comprehending Aldwych farce (<span class="italic">Nap Hand</span>), serious drama (<span class="italic">Watch on the Rhine</span>), tough American gangster fare (<span class="italic">The Petrified Forest</span>), Shavian philosophical talk-fest (<span class="italic">Heartbreak House</span>), Utopian allegory (<span class="italic">They Came to a City</span>), social drama (<span class="italic">Frieda</span>), the brittleness of No&euml;l Coward (<span class="italic">Relative Values</span>), wise-cracking Americana (<span class="italic">The Man Who Came to Dinner</span>), and gentler mannered domestic drama (<span class="italic">Quiet Wedding</span> and its sequel <span class="italic">Quiet Weekend</span>). A designer who could meet the demands of such a pot-pourri of different genres was clearly going to be widely respected. Concurrently with his West End stage work Relph was also making his mark in films, and few contemporaries were more diversely involved in the British film industry than he was, fulfilling as he did the functions of art director (production designer, to use the later term), producer, director, and writer, as well as holding a number of important administrative posts. However, he was best known for two of these roles: as an Oscar-nominated designer and for the string of successful films he made, usually as producer, in partnership with Basil Dearden.<br>
<br>Relph first went to Ealing Studios in 1942, where Michael Balcon was now installed as production chief and &#145;took him under his wing&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 8 Oct 2004). Dearden was already established there as co-director with the comedian Will Hay on several of Hay's starring vehicles, the last of which was <span class="italic">My Learned Friend</span> (1943), on which Relph worked as art director, having first designed for Dearden's solo-directing d&eacute;but, <span class="italic">The Bells Go Down</span> (1943). So began one of the longest and most productive associations in British cinema. Relph designed the evocative rural Welsh-inn setting for the fantasy <span class="italic">Halfway House</span> (1944) and the deliberately stylized theatricality of Dearden's next film, <span class="italic">They Came to a City</span> (1944), which Relph had also designed for the stage production of J. B. Priestley's socialistic vision. Charles Barr later praised Relph's &#145;remarkable work in his construction of two quite different styles of environment&#146; in these two films  (Barr, 187).<br>
<br>The other Ealing colleague with whom Relph was notably associated at this period was the Brazilian Alberto Cavalcanti, of whom Relph later said that &#145;he became the sort of <i>&eacute;minence grise</i> of the studio and had a tremendous influence on Balcon&#146;  (McFarlane, <span class="italic">British Cinema</span>, 481). His designs for Cavalcanti's productions of <span class="italic">Champagne Charlie</span> (1944) and <span class="italic">Nicholas Nickleby</span> (1946), as well as episodes of the portmanteau horror film <span class="italic">Dead of Night</span> (1945), were striking visual achievements, adding enormously to the atmosphere in these very diverse films. The sketches for <span class="italic">Champagne Charlie</span>, for instance, recreated with a style and bravura that went beyond mere realism the opulence of the music hall and the decrepitude of Victorian living quarters. Of Relph's work at this time, that other noted designer Edward Carrick wrote: &#145;His designs are made in crayon and wash, and as designs show a distinct theatrical influence but when built in the studio become essentially cinematic&#146;  (Carrick, 110&#150;11).<br>
<br>According to Relph it was Cavalcanti who &#145;suggested to Balcon that he should team Basil [Dearden] and myself, and I think it was a very good arrangement. Basil was a very easy person to work with and I was able to convey any creative ideas I had through him. We complemented each other&#146;  (McFarlane, <span class="italic">British Cinema</span>, 481). Though some of their films carried the credit &#145;Produced and Directed by Basil Dearden and Michael Relph&#146;, it was fairly clearly understood that Dearden directed and Relph produced. Relph later said that he did not feel he had the temperament for directing. His name appeared as solo director (with Dearden as producer) on several films, including <span class="italic">Davy</span> (1957), which starred his father, George Relph, and the comedian Harry Secombe, and <span class="italic">Rockets Galore!</span> (1958), the post-Ealing sequel to <span class="italic">Whisky Galore!</span>, which lacked the astringency of the original. Relph believed, though without acrimony, that he only directed those films Dearden didn't want to.<br>
<br>Ealing was characterized by a number of producer&#150;director combinations; indeed, this was common elsewhere in British cinema (as with John and Roy Boulting, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, and Ralph Thomas and Betty Box). The Dearden&#150;Relph team was prolific, and too much enamoured of film-making to be willing to wait, as some at Ealing were, for exactly the ideal project. As a result their output may have been more variable than that of some contemporaries, but their adaptability undoubtedly attracted its fair share of popular and critical success. At Ealing it was the usual practice for Balcon to be credited as producer, with the person who actually filled this role being listed as associate producer, and this was the case with Relph until the early 1950s, when, though his function didn't change, he was billed as producer.<br>
<br>The Dearden&#150;Relph partnership began with the tense and moving prisoner-of-war drama <span class="italic">The Captive Heart</span> (1946) and lasted through a further fifteen films. These encompassed an unusually wide generic range. There were socially conscious dramas such as <span class="italic">Frieda</span> (1947; Relph had designed the stage play), in which a German war-bride is introduced into a hostile English environment; <span class="italic">I Believe in You</span> (1952), dealing with the work of probation officers in relation to youthful offenders; and, most famously, <span class="italic">The Blue Lamp</span> (1950), a realistically set tribute to the police force faced with a new kind of post-war delinquent as well as continuing to comfort old ladies with missing pets. The latter film made a star of Dirk Bogarde as a violent, sexy young thug, but, perhaps even more remarkably, so enshrined Jack Warner in the popular imagination as the fatally shot PC Dixon that the screenwriter Ted Willis resuscitated him for the BBC television series <span class="italic">Dixon of Dock Green</span> (1955&#150;76). The film's use of location filming and realistic sets, along with its pervasive sense of a barely contained criminal underworld, had a powerfully authentic ring to it in 1950.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Blue Lamp</span> was a far cry from the team's previous film, <span class="italic">Saraband for Dead Lovers</span> (1948), on which Relph was not merely producer but also chiefly responsible for the film's sumptuous production design. This was not a popular film at the time, being much more sombre than the Gainsborough costume melodramas that had been such box-office successes, but it later acquired a higher reputation, largely perhaps for its lavish d&eacute;cor and use of colour, and Relph richly earned his Oscar nomination. In 1997 he said that &#145;It was an attempt to make a big international historical romance&#146; and its failure &#145;made Ealing return to a very parochial type of subject&#146;  (Burton, Sullivan, and Wells, 245). The Duchess Sophia's library in Hanover remains one of the most striking achievements in British production design. Relph himself wrote at the time: &#145;Here then, in these settings of Hanover, should lie the doom of the little Princess of Celle&#146;  (<span class="italic">Saraband</span>, 80), and for him matters of colour and design were essentially at the service of the drama. The other Ealing costume film on which Relph worked as producer was Robert Hamer's sublime black comedy, <span class="italic">Kind Hearts and Coronets</span> (1949).<br>
<br>Among Dearden's and Relph's other Ealing productions were several further omnibus films, including the less successful <span class="italic">Train of Events</span> (1949), tracing the fortunes of four victims of a train crash; the realist drama <span class="italic">Pool of London</span> (1951), described by Charles Barr as an &#145;examination of the interlocking destinies of a group, this time the crew of a merchant ship who come ashore for a weekend&#146;  (Barr, 202); <span class="italic">The Square Ring</span> (1953), with its cross-section of boxers and their world; and <span class="italic">Out of the Clouds</span> (1955), set among passengers and staff at Heathrow airport. More interesting, especially in the Ealing context, was the bold melodrama of <span class="italic">Cage of Gold</span> (1950), which gave a real whiff of post-war change and discontents as it went about its histrionic meal of relationships. One of Dearden's and Relph's most ambitious Ealing films was another drama of post-war malaise, <span class="italic">The Ship that Died of Shame</span> (1955), in which a wartime boat put to illicit peacetime uses becomes a metaphor for a declining spirit of national consensus. One later commentator described it as &#145;a particularly interesting example of a film which in fact says more than it seems to be saying &hellip; offering a critique of &hellip; looking back&#146; to a past &#145;from which the only escape can be through violence and excess&#146;  (Cook, 366).<br>
<br>After Ealing, Dearden and Relph, more noticeably than other studio alumni, continued to have productive careers, perhaps because of their willingness to tackle a diversity of projects. The next main phase of their work was their involvement in Allied Film Makers, a consortium of production units initiated by Bryan Forbes and Richard Attenborough under the distribution umbrella of the Rank Organisation. The Dearden&#150;Relph contribution to this worthy venture included <span class="italic">The League of Gentlemen</span> (1960), in which they continued their critique of post-war Britain in the guise of a witty heist thriller, and three films dealing with social issues of the day: <span class="italic">Sapphire</span> (1959), focusing on racial prejudice; <span class="italic">Victim</span> (1961), the first mainstream treatment of a homosexual plot-line, quite courageous in its time; and the engrossing but commercially unsuccessful <span class="italic">Life for Ruth</span> (1962), which explored concepts of religious fundamentalism and medical ethics. While the issues in these films later lost their immediacy, their canny packaging as taut melodramas meant that they remained eminently watchable.<br>
<br>When Allied Film Makers folded, partly as a result of <span class="italic">Life for Ruth</span>'s failure to &#145;cover its cost, much less get into profit&#146;  (Walker, 248), Dearden and Relph showed their customary resilience and made a further half-dozen films together in the 1960s. These included <span class="italic">The Mind Benders</span> (1963), a gripping study of brainwashing procedures; the youth-orientated drama <span class="italic">A Place to Go</span> (1963), described as &#145;a sympathetic attempt to keep up with Woodfall&#146; (<span class="italic">Films and Filming</span>, July 1966; Woodfall was the production company that made several &#145;angry young films&#146;); and the enjoyably lush melodrama of family passions <span class="italic">Woman of Straw</span> (1964). Dearden then made a couple of films with other producers but was reunited with Relph for <span class="italic">The Assassination Bureau</span> (1969), a period spy spoof that Relph also designed, and <span class="italic">The Man Who Haunted Himself</span> (1970), which Relph and Dearden co-wrote.<br>
<br>After Dearden's death in a car accident in 1971 Relph's career lost some of its momentum. Nevertheless he continued to exercise influence in the British film industry in several ways. An urbane and conciliatory man, he was well placed to occupy some important administrative posts, including the chairmanship of the Film Production Association of Great Britain (1971&#150;6) and of the British Film Production Board (1972&#150;9), the latter set up to encourage young film-makers. He was also a governor of the British Film Institute (1972&#150;9). From 1978 to 1982 he was in charge of production for the enterprising Boyd's Company, set up by Don Boyd; he was executive producer for Boyd's controversial <span class="italic">Scum</span> (1979), and co-produced <span class="italic">An Unsuitable Job for a Woman</span> (1982), a quirky version of P. D. James's thriller. In 1999 he was made an honorary DLitt by De Montfort University.<br>
<br>More than many who worked creatively in cinema, Relph was knowledgeable and perceptive about how it also functioned as an industry and as a cultural force in the national life. He understood its connections with literature and the stage, with the British class system at the time of the Ealing heyday, and with the American dominance of British screens. But it was as an inventive designer and as one half of an astute producer&#150;director partnership that he was most notable. He and Dearden made a valuable contribution to the continuity and quality of British cinema when it was at its most British. He died in a nursing home, the Old Malt House, High Street, Selsey, Sussex, on 30 September 2004, of bronchopneumonia and obstruction of the airways, having spent his last year there, and was cremated at Chichester crematorium on 11 October. He was survived by his son and daughter.<br>
