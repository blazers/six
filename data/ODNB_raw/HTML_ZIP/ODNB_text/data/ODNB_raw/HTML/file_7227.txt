<span class="headword">Davies,  Cecilia</span>  (1756/7&#150;1836), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was the daughter of the flautist and composer Richard Davies (<i>d</i>. 1773) and his wife, Cecilia, and sister of the glass armonica player <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7252/', "Mary Ann Davies")</script>, who was her first singing teacher. In August 1767 she joined her sister and father in three concerts at the Swan and Hoop tavern, London, singing music by Handel and Arne, after which the family travelled to the continent. In Vienna they lived in the same house as the composer Hasse, who taught Cecilia singing, while she and Mary Ann taught his daughters English. The sisters performed together, becoming favourites at court; Empress Maria Theresa commissioned a cantata for soprano and armonica from Hasse and Metastasio for Archduchess Maria Amalia's wedding in June 1769. Metastasio wrote in praise of Cecilia's pleasing and flexible voice, which imitated the armonica &#145;so exactly, that it is sometimes impossible to distinguish one from the other&#146;  (Burney, <span class="italic">Metastasio</span>, 3.83). In January 1772, although Hasse felt her unready, Cecilia sang as prima donna in his <span class="italic">Ruggiero</span> at Naples. Mary Ann wrote that her sister was a success, despite her youth (she was fifteen) and the cabal against her. &#145;L'Inglesina&#146; sang also at Florence, becoming the first Englishwoman to perform leading roles in Italian opera houses.<br>
<br>The family returned to London, where Signora Davies sang at the Italian Opera in the 1773&#150;4 season, receiving &#145;thundering shouts of applause&#146; on her d&eacute;but  (<span class="italic">General Evening Post</span>, 23 Nov 1773). She failed to charm Horace Walpole, but Charles Burney praised the flexibility and clarity of her voice, not loud but perfectly in tune, and admired the accuracy of her rapid divisions. David Garrick told James Harris that Cecilia Davies was the best opera actress he had ever seen. Her father died in December 1773 and it was Mary Ann whom Fanny Burney blamed for the disputes in which Cecilia, &#145;a sensible, well bred &amp; engaging Girl&#146;  (<span class="italic">Early Journals</span>, 2.106), became involved at the Opera. In 1775 Cecilia was engaged in a law suit against the Opera managers and, although she won her case and received &pound;2000 plus expenses, she sang again at the Opera only from January to July 1777, when she replaced the inexperienced Anna Pozzi as prima donna. During these four years she sang at a number of London concerts, mainly for charitable foundations, and at several provincial festivals.<br>
<br>The sisters were in Paris by January 1778 and in 1779&#150;80 Cecilia sang leading roles in opera houses in Venice, Florence, Genoa, and Leghorn. In 1784 she appeared at Florence, having earlier refused engagements because of her sister's serious illness. Mount Edgcumbe later found them at Florence &#145;unengaged and poor&#146;  (Edgcumbe, 17) and assisted their return to England. Cecilia sang in the 1787 Professional Concerts in London and in oratorios at Drury Lane in 1791, still described as &#145;L'Inglesina&#146;. By 1797 she and Mary Ann were supporting themselves by giving music lessons. Cecilia was seriously ill after Mary Ann's death in December 1818, and by the mid-1820s she was dependent on charitable donations. The publication by subscription in 1829 of six pieces composed for her by Hasse and others raised little money. She grew increasingly frail and became nearly blind, but remained alert and communicative about the successes of her youth. She died at her lodgings at 58 Great Portland Street, on 3 July 1836, and was buried at St Marylebone on 7 July as Cecilia Anglecina Davies.<br>
