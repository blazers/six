</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Collins, Sir  William Job</span>  (1859&#150;1946), <span class="occ">ophthalmic surgeon and politician</span>, was born on 9 May 1859 at 46 Gloucester Road, Regent's Park, London, the eldest of the four children of William Job Collins (1818&#150;1884), surgeon and pharmacist, and his wife, Mary Anne Francisca Treacher (1824&#150;1880), who belonged to the Huguenot family of Garnault. The family traced its descent directly from a Warwickshire branch which included Francis Collins, the lawyer who drafted, and was one of the witnesses to, Shakespeare's will. Suggestions of distant relationships with other Collins families are only speculative. Collins had a happy childhood. His father's strong character and involvement in public affairs in the St Pancras district and his consistent opposition to compulsory vaccination were both strong influences on his son. William and his brother Edward, his lifelong friend, were educated locally, at University College School, and William went to St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, in 1876, gaining the Jeaffreson entrance exhibition. He was a scholar, fellow, and gold medallist in sanitary science and in obstetrics at the University of London. He qualified BSc in 1880 and MD in 1881, and gained the University of London's certificate in sanitary science in 1887.<br>
<br>Collins seemed destined for a brilliant career on the surgical staff at St Bartholomew's, but his opposition to vaccination was said to have prevented his election. From 1885 onwards he specialized mainly in ophthalmology, becoming surgeon and later consulting surgeon to the Royal Eye Hospital and the Western Ophthalmic Hospital. He was also ophthalmic surgeon to the Hampstead and North West London Hospital and to the National Temperance Hospital. However, he published little on ophthalmology and his main interests lay increasingly elsewhere. His career, like that of his father, was in public life. This public career was an extraordinarily broad one. He was a senator of the University of London from 1893 to 1927. He strenuously opposed R. B. Haldane's scheme for its reconstitution, which he termed the Germanization of the university. He was vice-chancellor of the university twice, in 1907&#150;9 and again in 1911&#150;12.<br>
<br>In 1892 Collins was elected as the Progressive member for West St Pancras to the London county council (LCC). He was re-elected in 1895, 1898, 1901, and 1904. The Progressive political programme included municipal provision of services and rate equalization, together with the unification of the City of London with the county. These aims were opposed by the Moderates and Collins was a leader in these struggles. For two years he was chairman of the public control committee, and of the general purposes committee. He was vice-chairman of the council in 1896&#150;7 and chairman in 1897&#150;8. When the <span class="roman">London Education Act</span> transferred responsibility from the London school board to the county council in 1904, Collins was the first chairman of the education committee, which laid the foundation of the education service in London. He took an interest in the LCC hospitals and an inquiry he set up in 1895 led to the establishment of the Claybury Laboratory, with the eminent neuropathologist Sir Frederick Mott as superintendent. Collins was created a knight in 1902 and KCVO in 1913.<br>
<br>Collins entered parliament in 1906 as the Liberal member for West St Pancras, after earlier unsuccessful contests in West St Pancras in 1895 and for the University of London in 1900. He seemed destined for high office, but these prospects were not fulfilled. Henry Campbell-Bannerman offered him the under-secretaryship at the Local Government Board, but John Burns, president of the board, intervened with a candidate of his own, and Collins withdrew. Later Collins's hopes of becoming deputy speaker were also disappointed. Collins consistently refused to &#145;play for his own hand&#146;  (MacNalty, 21). He was never a strict party man, and would speak against the party line in a debate if he felt strongly on an issue. He lost his seat in the 1910 general election, and was returned as Liberal MP for Derby in 1917 at a by-election. He then lost the seat in Lloyd George's &#145;coupon election&#146; in 1918, and thereafter gave up political ambitions. As an MP he was successful in obtaining the establishment of a motor ambulance service for London, from 1915, after several years of campaigning.<br>
<br>Collins was a member of the royal commission on vaccination (1889&#150;96), where his opposition to vaccination led to his drafting a minority report. The commission unanimously conceded the right to refuse vaccination to those who believed it useless or dangerous, a right subsequently embodied in the 1898 <span class="roman">Vaccination Act</span>. Collins found satisfaction in the successful conclusion of a campaign in which his father had been a pioneer. In 1906 he was a member of the royal commission on vivisection, for which he jointly drafted the scientific section of the report and its moral and ethical sections. He and others also drafted a dissentient memorandum.<br>
<br>Collins was actively involved in the discussion of an alcohol and drug control policy. He sat as the British government plenipotentiary at the three international opium conferences at The Hague in 1911&#150;12, 1913, and 1914. The Hague Convention, the result of these meetings, was the foundation of all subsequent international narcotics control. Collins, in his writings, saw alcohol and drug addiction as diseases of the will rather than having any physical causation, and favoured restriction rather than prohibition so far as alcohol was concerned. His <span class="italic">Ethics and Law of Drug and Alcohol Addiction</span> appeared in 1916.<br>
<br>Collins was also involved in a large number of charitable and medico-political organizations. He was president of the Medico-Legal Society (1902&#150;6), of the Society for the Study of Inebriety (1916&#150;19), and of the Sanitary Inspectors' Association (1922&#150;7), among many others. He was a member of the council of the King Edward's Hospital Fund for London, where he secured a more equitable pension provision for hospital administrative staff. His writings were wide-ranging and prolific, covering philosophy, law, and social reform.<br>
<br>In the inter-war years, Collins's primary interests were in the field of district nursing in London, where he was chairman from 1914 to 1944 of the Central Council for District Nursing. He was chairman of the Chadwick Trust from 1924 to 1946. Despite the advent of bacteriology, Collins remained a believer in Edwin Chadwick's view of the importance of a sanitary environment and fresh air, and he published <span class="italic">The Life and Doctrines of Sir Edwin Chadwick</span> in 1924. Collins was vice-lieutenant of the county of London from 1924 until 1945.<br>
<br>On 2 August 1898 Collins had married Jane Stevenson Wilson (<i>b</i>. 1855/6), daughter of John Wilson, MP for Govan. Jane Collins was a sister at the National Temperance Hospital, and was already well known through her work in the League of Mercy. She died after a long illness in 1936. Thereafter Collins's &#145;zest and pleasure in life departed&#146;  (MacNalty, 33), though his mental faculties and involvement in public affairs remained undimmed until his death.<br>
<br>Collins was of striking physical appearance with a massive head, firm set lips, and a penetrating gaze. His career did not quite fulfil its early promise. His qualities were judged to be those of the chairman rather than of the front bench, and he was seen as a &#145;chairman sent from heaven&#146;  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 967), firm, fair, and always urbane. He was also an individualist with a &#145;disdain for expediency at the expense of principle&#146;  (MacNalty, 34). He threw a copy of <span class="italic">Ann Veronica</span> signed by H. G. Wells, who had been his patient, into the fire because he disapproved of its content. Collins's career was by no means a failure, for, in London especially, he achieved much in the field of citizenship. Collins died at 1 Albert Terrace, Regent's Park, where he had lived since the age of two, on 12 December 1946. A school in Somers Town was named after him until its name was changed to the South Camden community school.<br>
