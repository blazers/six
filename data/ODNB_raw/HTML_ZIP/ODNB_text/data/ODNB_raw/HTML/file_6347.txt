<span class="headword">Cornysh <span class="st"> [Cornysshe]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1523), <span class="occ">composer and court impresario</span>, is of unknown parentage. It is likely that he was close kin, perhaps even a son, of <a name="cosubject_76409"></a><span class="headword">William Cornysh <span class="st"> [Cornysshe]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 1502), <span class="occ">composer</span>, also of unknown parentage. Nothing is known of the elder William's upbringing and musical education. On 25 March 1480 he either already was or was newly appointed as a member of the ensemble of four adult professional singers which since before 1400 had been employed at Westminster Abbey to enhance with polyphonic music the observance of the daily Lady mass and evening Marian antiphon performed in the lady chapel there. Composers of music in these genres had lately expanded its sonority and scope by adding boys' voices to the long-established performing ensemble of men's voices alone. Cornysh was now appointed to raise a team of six boys from the abbey's flourishing almonry school, whom he was to train as singing-boys and with whom he was to expand and modernize the resources of the existing lady chapel choir.<br>
<br>By 1485 Cornysh was renting from the abbey a substantial residence located in Sanctuary Yard, regranted to him in 1489 at a greatly reduced rent. Between 1489 and 1491 he married Joan and on 29 March 1491, four days after leaving the abbey's service, he renewed the lease on this residence in their joint names. As inducement for continuation of his goodwill towards the abbey he was permitted to continue paying only the much reduced rent. He retained possession for the rest of his life, and his widow after him until 1519.<br>
<br>Cornysh's new employment after 1491 is not known. However, his compositions include works which, for their ample scoring and great technical intricacy, seem unlikely to have lain readily within the competence of a small lady chapel choir. This consideration, taken with his need to make independent arrangements for possession of a settled domestic residence, suggests that in 1491 he moved not to a residential job at another church but to membership of one of the dozen or so peripatetic household chapel choirs, of the highest quality, maintained at this period by members of the nobility. It may have been at the instigation of such an employer that from Christmas 1499 Cornysh found himself in receipt of an annual pension of &pound;5 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., payable to him by Westminster Abbey in recognition of his past services there.<br>
<br>The attribution of certain works to one William Cornish junior in a manuscript of (apparently) 1501 discloses the existence at that time of an older composer of renown from whom the younger man needed to be distinguished. Eight major compositions attributed simply to William Cornysh were included in the Eton choirbook, a collection of Marian votive antiphons and <span class="roman">Magnificats</span> compiled between about 1502 and 1505; four survive complete, the remainder being incomplete or lost [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94452', "Composers of the Eton choirbook")</script>]. The style of the surviving music is characteristic of a mature composer of the 1480s and 1490s, expansive in concept, ornate in detail, and requiring of its performers much virtuosity of vocal technique; it thus appears to be the work of a man born in the 1440s rather than thirty years later and (as first proposed by David Skinner in 1997) may be attributed to the elder William Cornysh. These works were well known and widely copied. (Further lost works attributed simply to Cornysh may be the work of either the older or the younger man of that name.)<br>
<br>Even if Cornysh the elder did not achieve the profundity of his greater contemporary John Browne or the extended control of sheer display manifested by Richard Davy, his work impresses for its boldness of execution and confidence of design. Further, <span class="italic">Stabat mater</span> exhibits refined deployment of vocal scoring for apparently calculated, even affective, ends, while the &#145;Gloria patri&#146; in the <span class="roman">Magnificat</span> includes one of the most memorably extrovert and virtuosic passages in all early Tudor music. <span class="italic">Ave Maria, mater Dei</span> and <span class="italic">Gaude virgo, mater Christi</span>, both for four men's voices, are in a style at once more concentrated and compact.<br>
<br>Cornysh died between 5 May and 29 September 1502; the fraternity of St Nicholas, the guild of parish clerks and professional church musicians of London and its hinterland, to membership of which he had been admitted during 1480&#150;81, was informed. He was buried with death-knell and torches in St Margaret's churchyard, Westminster, of which his residence in Sanctuary Yard rendered him a parishioner. During the following year the churchwardens received from his widow a bequest of 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., and in 1509 the abbey's almonry possessed a silver bowl donated by William Cornysh, &#145;syngar&#146;.<br>
<br>William Cornysh the younger may have been the elder William's son, but not from his marriage to Joan. Both men have been confused with one another. Of Cornysh the younger's education and musical training nothing is known. By 1493 he had become a lay gentleman of the Chapel Royal, and so remained until his death.<br>
<br>The Chapel Royal was England's foremost ecclesiastical choir, and Cornysh's membership coincided with the beginning of its greatest flowering as a cynosure of liturgical and musical practice. Its personnel of forty professional singers (thirty men, ten boys) conducted the greater part of the daily ecclesiastical liturgy of Salisbury use. Extending to some five or six hours of work each day, this comprehended not only the intricately detailed complexities of the ever changing text, ritual, movement, and plainsong of the liturgy but also the ornate and extended polyphony of this period, composed for unaccompanied virtuoso voices in up to six independent parts.<br>
<br>On 29 September 1509 Cornysh was appointed to succeed William Newark as master of the choristers. The duties of this very exacting job extended to teaching fundamental music theory and notation, highly developed techniques of singing, all the intricacies of the liturgy, the basic Latin needed for their comprehension, and the vocal parts to be sung by the boys in the polyphonic repertory, including, for instance, masses by Robert Fayrfax, John Taverner, Hugh Aston, Thomas Ashwell, and John Marbeck. The boys were rewarded particularly for their execution of two great set pieces from the liturgical year, <span class="italic">Audivi vocem</span> at matins of All Saints, and <span class="italic">Gloria in excelsis Deo</span> at Christmas day matins. Cornysh supervised all arrangements for the choristers' boarding and feeding, and was responsible also for their recruitment, using a royal commission empowering him to take from other choirs their very best boys already fully trained. Gratuities paid to him by Thetford Priory, Norfolk, in 1511/12 and by Westminster Abbey in 1522 may well have been bribes to induce him not to take singing-boys from their respective lady chapel choirs.<br>
<br>Cornysh and the boys attended Henry VIII in France on the Th&eacute;rouanne expedition of 1513 and at the Field of Cloth of Gold, held at Gu&icirc;nes between 7 and 24 June 1520. Perhaps this latter occasion was the most demanding single event in Cornysh's entire career; at its climax the English and French chapels royal jointly sang high mass in (doubtless competitive) alternation, concluding the service with several motets, &#145;which was a heavenlie heareing&#146;  (Russell, 214). No sacred music set to Latin words can confidently be ascribed to Cornysh as composer. Nevertheless, certain settings of Lady mass sequences copied for the choir of King's College, Cambridge, in 1508/9 may well, from their late date, have been his work rather than that of his earlier namesake, as also may have been the four-part masses and single six-part mass recorded among that choir's repertory in 1529.<br>
<br>Cornysh married Joan (<i>d</i>. in or after 1523) before January 1513. As well as many cash rewards, some very large, he received from Henry VII and Henry VIII a grant of the administration of a territorial windfall to the crown (1494), monastic corrodies in the royal gift (Malmesbury Abbey in Wiltshire in 1495, Thorney Abbey in Cambridgeshire in 1496, Thetford Priory in 1523), and a lease of the manor of Hilden (near Tonbridge, Kent), with survivorship to his wife, Joan, and son, Henry, on 20 August 1523. His service at court was not uninterrupted; he wrote his poem &#145;A treatise between truth and information&#146;, dated July 1504, while incarcerated in the Fleet prison. This text constituted his claim that the charge laid against him by some informant was untrue and his resulting imprisonment unjust. Its use of imagery drawn from musical experience is of great interest, and although the style of Cornysh's writing lacks any conspicuous elegance, the concepts he conveys were generated with a noteworthy degree of intelligent imagination and perceptiveness.<br>
<br>This incident did not at all jeopardize Cornysh's future career in the royal household. Indeed, with Henry VIII he seems to have enjoyed terms of jovial familiarity sufficient to allow him, perhaps, some of the licence of a court jester. In March 1518 he was able, by exploiting his easy relationship with the king, to draw to Henry's attention a prevailing shortage of victuals for the court, making joking supplication for provision of &#145;a botell off haye and an horselofe&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/16, fol. 176<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>The skills and attributes which qualified men and boys for Chapel Royal employment were exclusively musical, and their duties as practitioners of liturgical observance can have left but limited time for extra-curricular activities. However, Cornysh exhibited a certain leaning towards theatrical enterprise, and he was fortunate to have been in service as an employee of the court at a period which, albeit briefly, proved particularly propitious for the exploitation of such inclinations. On 6 January 1494 the court discovered Cornysh's capacity for making a theatrical entrance when he executed a cameo performance costumed as St George, suddenly interrupting on horseback a play being performed by Henry VII's professional troupe of players. After declaiming his speech he led the gentlemen of the Chapel Royal in a lusty rendering of some setting of &#145;O Georgi Deo care&#146;, a text of somewhat martial character first set to music during the wars of Henry V. He made a substantial contribution to the disguisings mounted in November 1501 to celebrate the marriage of Arthur, prince of Wales, and Katherine of Aragon, devising a production consisting of three sequential dramatic pageants showing a degree of elaboration unprecedented at the English court. Further, it is possible that from 1505 until 1512 he and three or four Chapel Royal colleagues collaborated once a year to mount a play or other entertainment before the king. Cornysh, John Kite, and William Crane, particularly mentioned together (for their musical, not their theatrical, expertise) in Alexander Barclay's &#145;Second eclogue&#146; of about 1513&#150;14, appear to have belonged to this informal group.<br>
<br>Cornysh participated in pageants performed on 13 February 1511 and at new year 1512 and 1515; presumably he also coached those boys of the Chapel Royal who contributed songs and in 1515 joined him in recitation of the prologue. He next made both a foray upon dramatic writing and, despite the weight of his responsibilities as master of the choristers, a significant return to undertaking production. For the pageant on 6 January 1516 he shared responsibility for the creation of its central scenic structure, wrote some of the speeches, and acted the Herald. Further, he was credited with the production of a play presented in May 1516, and in &#145;Le gardyn de esperans&#146; (twelfth night 1517) he, as usual, declaimed the prologue, assisted again by two of his boys.<br>
<br>With varying degrees of plausibility modern scholarship has sought to identify Cornysh as deviser and manager of several other examples of court spectacle at this time. Certainly he created two pageants for presentation before Charles V on 12 July 1520 at Calais, and he was responsible for not merely the production but also the writing of a major dramatic presentation mounted on 15 June 1522 as part of the celebrations marking the creation of an Anglo-imperial alliance against the French. In this unsubtle allegory characters including Amity, Prudence, and Might combined to bridle an unruly horse representing Fran&ccedil;ois I.<br>
<br>Cornysh also developed an intriguing production enterprise peculiarly his own. On 6 January 1516 he presented an interlude called &#145;The story of Troilus and Pandor&#146; performed just by himself and, for the first time as actors, his Chapel Royal singing-boys. Thereafter he devoted much of that theatrical work with which he chose to supplement his primary Chapel Royal duties to the presentation at court on two or even three occasions per year of plays acted by himself and his boy choristers. These productions were relatively modest, all his expenses and expectations of reward being covered by a charge to the king of but &pound;6 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. There is record of nine such productions between new year 1517 and new year 1521. The entertainments of September 1519 specifically included &#145;a pastym that master kornyche mad&#146;, consisting of an interlude of evidently traditional character acted by seven of his choristers.<br>
<br>The Chapel Royal boys, of course, were never more than makeshift actors. In no sense were they ever subjected to transformation into a formally organized playing company; such pastimes could not be suffered to encroach upon their principal daily work as members of the sovereign's personal, and England's most prominent, professional liturgical and musical ensemble. Indeed, when in March 1518 something&#151;most probably some distraction of his attention towards theatrical enterprise&#151;was leading Cornysh to neglect his duties towards the musical training of the Chapel Royal boys and the general direction of the choir, Henry himself demonstrated to his choirmaster how the musical standards of his own chapel had begun to slip below those of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey's. After this incident it was only in their own plays mounted by Cornysh, and in no other type of production conducted at court, that the Chapel Royal boys participated. (The singing-boys not of the king's but of Wolsey's chapel played in &#145;Ch&acirc;teau vert&#146; on 4 March 1522.)<br>
<br>Cornysh was involved in the secular as well as the ecclesiastical music-making of the court; in particular, he composed to texts in English, for use at court in non-ecclesiastical contexts. The most substantial extant piece is a four-part setting of &#145;Woefully arrayed&#146;, a meditation on the passion of Christ exhibiting a precociously skilful response to the mood of the text. Probably the &#145;carrall&#146; for the composition of which Cornysh received a fee of 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. from Elizabeth of York at Christmas 1502 was a further vernacular piece of comparable character.<br>
<br>The vagaries of survival mean that Cornysh is best known as a court composer for his lightweight vernacular partsong, to texts hinting strongly at the nature of their courtly milieu. After early endeavours engaging lengthy and complex repetition forms with integrated refrain or burden, the songs for the court of Henry VIII are far simpler, some being very slight indeed. At its best Cornysh's compositional style exhibits a degree of balance and poise belying its simplicity of structure, the inventive jollity of the songs of rustic merry-making complementing the reflectiveness of the songs of <i>fine amour</i>. Two surviving instrumental pieces are far more intellectual and rarefied. One fantasia is lengthy and contrapuntally intricate, while a briefer piece includes in its tenor four successive palindromes, respectively of fifteen, five, nine, and three pitches; the mathematical patterning is obvious, its significance utterly obscure.<br>
<br>Within his very limited circle of courtly pursuits Cornysh in his own time was probably a man of some consequence. In the longer run, however, most of his accomplishments appear but transitory. Renaissance ideals had as yet reached neither English music nor English letters; Cornysh was a late medieval figure who was merely quite good at quite a number of things which on the whole proved to have little long-term future. Unfortunately not a single word of any pageant or play written by him has survived. Yet he made one lasting contribution to English drama, namely the free-standing interlude of the type which from 1516 onwards was performed by his amateur choirboy actors. Hereby Cornysh invented a genre yielding particular and lasting satisfaction as entertainment, which both helped to keep alive the thread of occasional drama at court through the remaining years of Henry's reign and beyond, and also spawned a tradition which eventually contributed modestly to the flowering of English drama later in the century.<br>
<br>Cornysh retired as master of the choristers at Easter 1523, retaining his position as gentleman of the Chapel Royal until death. He died very soon after receiving his last mark of royal favour on 20 August 1523, for by 16 September his corrody from Thetford Priory had become available for award to a successor. Probate of his will was granted on 14 October. He requested burial in the nave of the chapel of the rood in East Greenwich, the location of his home, and he bequeathed his numerous properties and leases in Greenwich to Joan, his wife, and after her to their son, Henry  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/21, sig. 13).<br>
