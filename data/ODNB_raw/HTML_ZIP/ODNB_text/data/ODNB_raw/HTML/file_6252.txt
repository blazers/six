</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cope,  Charles West</span>  (1811&#150;1890), <span class="occ">history painter</span>, was born on 28 July 1811 in Park Square, Leeds. His father, Charles Cope (<i>d</i>. 1827), painted landscapes in watercolour; his mother was said to be a gifted amateur in the same medium. They named their children after eminent artists whom the father knew personally: Ellen Turner after J. M. W. Turner; Charles West, about a year younger, after Benjamin West. Charles's mother died soon after his birth, and the boy was sent for two or three years to foster parents at Woodhouse Moor and then to London. He attended a boarding-school in Camberwell Grove and lived with an aunt during the holidays.<br>
<br>From 1818 to 1827, Cope passed through a painful period. Bullies at Mr Terry's school in Great Marlow subjected him to a prank that broke his elbow and left him with a permanently crooked left arm; in the grammar school at Leeds a severe master treated all the boys as hopeless dunces. The widowed father encouraged his son as best he could: he took him on an excursion to Teesdale, where the boy picked up a lifelong passion for fly-fishing; and he urged him to develop his artistic talent. At sixteen, with his father's support, Cope entered Henry Sass's academy of art in Bloomsbury. In 1827 his father died after a stagecoach accident, and Sass consented to administer the estate and act as guardian to Charles and Ellen.<h2>
<a name="Earlyartisticexperience"></a>Early artistic experience</h2>Cope worked hard at drawing and in 1828 gained admittance to the Royal Academy Schools. He won a silver medal (1829) at the Society of Arts and a second medal (1831) at the academy's life school. With awakening inquisitiveness, he read widely and in 1832 travelled to Paris, where he studied the paintings in the Louvre. In 1833 he exhibited for the first time at the Royal Academy <span class="italic">The Golden Age</span>, which was not sold. On the advice of William Hilton, then keeper of the schools, he set out in September 1833 for Italy; he stayed for nearly two years, examining the pictures in galleries and churches. He spent six months at Rome and as many at Florence; he travelled widely, as far south as Naples looking with special attention at frescoes and observing at close hand an eruption of Vesuvius. Of his many new acquaintances&#151;Italian, German, English&#151;one, the painter William Boxall, became a good friend.<br>
<br>On returning to London, Cope lodged in Russell Place, Fitzroy Square, and painted <span class="italic">Paolo and Francesca</span> (exh. RA, 1837), which was sold to the Art Union, and <span class="italic">Osteria di campagna between Rome and Ancona</span> (exh. RA, 1838), sold for 150 guineas and given in 1878 to the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool. The <span class="italic">Osteria</span>, with about twenty figures&#151;<i>vettura</i> travellers at their repast and German students in the background&#151;attracted attention to a &#145;new man&#146;. Cope joined the Etching Club as an original member; the etchers, most of them future Royal Academicians, experimented with the medium, discussed their plates, sold a few, and enjoyed simple suppers together. Cope and Richard Redgrave formed a close friendship; other particular friends&#151;non-members of the club&#151;included John Sheepshanks, known to Cope since boyhood as a benevolent patron of living artists, and the portrait painter George Richmond. Cope moved from Russell Place to a spacious room built for B. R. Haydon off Lisson Grove and painted there a large altarpiece (exh. RA, 1840) for presentation to the new St George's Church at Little Woodhouse, Leeds. This work won a prize of 50 guineas at Liverpool.<br>
<br>On a fishing expedition to Greta Bridge and the valley of the Tees, Cope met at a friend's house a young lady named Charlotte Benning (<i>d</i>. 1868): the two fell in love. Her father, a busy country surgeon, showed sympathetic understanding; her stepmother insisted, however, on evidence that the young artist was respectable. In spite of her misgivings, the Bennings made plans for the wedding; on 1 September 1840 Charles and Charlotte were married, with Richard Redgrave as best man. There was a last-minute contretemps: the bridegroom forgot to bring the ring to church, and Redgrave had to run and fetch it from the inn. The happy couple drove away &#145;amid acclamations&#146;; but Mrs Benning, tearfully hugging the bride, exclaimed, &#145;Oh, you poor victim!&#146;  (Cope, 143).<br>
<br>The couple proceeded first to London and then to the house of friends near Staines. Cope attended a meeting of the local Board of Guardians, of which their host was chairman, and began a painting entitled <span class="italic">Poor Law Guardians, Board-Day Application for Bread</span> (exh. RA, 1841). The contemporary subject drew attention, notably in <span class="italic">The Times</span>; but the picture was not sold: &#145;Abundant praise&#146;, Cope recalled, &#145;but no solid pudding&#146;  (Cope, 143). Two years later it went for 100 guineas to the holder of an Art Union prize. In 1841 Cope repeated for Lord Lansdowne a <span class="italic">Mother and Child</span> first painted at Florence in 1834 and sold to William Beckford; and the Copes, with their own first child, a son named Charles, moved into a new house in Hyde Park Gate, next door to Richard Redgrave.<h2>
<a name="Workforthehousesofparliament"></a>Work for the houses of parliament</h2>The year 1841 was marked also by an event that affected Cope's career for the ensuing twenty-five years: the establishment of the Royal Fine Arts Commission, with Prince Albert as president and Charles Lock Eastlake, later Sir Charles, as secretary. Sir Robert Peel, the initiating force, stated the purpose: &#145;Investigation whether the Construction of the new Houses of Parliament can be taken advantage of for the encouragement of British Art&#146;  (Peel to Queen Victoria, 12 Oct 1841, BL, Add. MS 40432). In April 1842 the commission announced its first competition for artists, inviting cartoons in chalk or the like, uncoloured, for frescoes based upon subjects chosen from English history or from the works of Spenser, Shakespeare, or Milton. Cope submitted <span class="italic">The First Trial by Jury</span>, one of 141 cartoons in the Westminster Hall exhibition of 1843; and the judges awarded to him one of the three highest premiums of &pound;300. In this year he was elected an associate of the Royal Academy.<br>
<br>To the competition in 1844, for painters in fresco, with free choice of subject matter, Cope sent <span class="italic">The Meeting of Jacob and Rachel</span>, and he was one of the six artists selected to prepare designs for six arched compartments in the House of Lords. His subject, announced in July, was <span class="italic">Edward the Black Prince Receiving the Order of the Garter from Edward III</span>. Cope began his sketches, but on 30 September informed Eastlake of a worrying predicament: Sir Harris Nicolas, historian of the orders of knighthood, declared &#145;positively that no such thing ever did occur, and that it is an historical absurdity&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 40452). Eastlake circulated copies of Cope's letter. Peel hardly knew what to say, at first; he would see the prince, and meanwhile recommended consultation with the three historian-commissioners&#151;Henry Hallam, T. B. Macaulay, and Lord Mahon&#151;who failed to respond promptly. Eastlake nudged Peel, and Peel came to a decision: the investiture <i>might</i> have occurred. Prince Albert agreed that it was not &#145;an historical absurdity&#146;. Cope resumed his sketching, and the finished work was eventually ready for the opening of parliament in 1847. The artist was elected a Royal Academician in 1848 and a member of the Athenaeum in 1849. When Redgrave's sketches for another compartment were judged unacceptable, the subject was reassigned to Cope, who completed <span class="italic">Prince Henry, Later Henry V, Acknowledging the Authority of Chief Justice Gascoigne</span> in 1849.<br>
<br>Cope now took up an assignment in the Upper Waiting Hall. The commission had announced the plan in 1845: at &pound;400 each, eight frescoes based on works by English poets. The first list included Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, Dryden, and Pope. Chaucer was assigned to Cope; Milton, to John Callcott Horsley. Both artists saw the need for further knowledge of fresco-painting; and in 1849 they spent about three months on the continent, studying works by Giotto and other <i>frescanti</i>, ancient and modern. At Florence, Cope met William Dyce, travelling with the same purpose. At Munich he admired the frescoes of Heinrich Hess in the new basilica of St Boniface and conferred twice about the technique of fresco with Hess himself, professor of painting and director of all the art collections in the city.<br>
<br>For the &#145;Poets' Hall&#146;, Cope chose to execute in fresco <span class="italic">Griselda's First Trial of Patience</span>, based on the Clerk's Tale and completed in 1852. The commission added Scott and Byron to the list of poets and offered the Byronic subject to Cope; he finished <span class="italic">The Death of Lara</span> in 1854. By that time the poetical frescoes had begun to suffer ruinously from blisters caused by damp and dirt; the colours were dropping away as dust. &#145;I feel how much of life&#146;, Cope said in his <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, &#145;has been wasted in, as it were, writing in the sand&#146;  (Cope, 257).<br>
<br>Cope faced yet another assignment: by 1847 the commission had planned for the peers' corridor eight illustrations of &#145;the virtues and heroism of some of the actors in the great Civil War, four of them on the Royalist side, and four on that of the Parliament&#146;  (Cope, 255). By 1853, however, none of the several aspirants had produced acceptable sketches. Eastlake enquired whether Cope would submit a sketch, with the understanding that, if it proved satisfactory, he might be employed to paint the whole series. Cope sketched <span class="italic">The Embarkation of a Puritan Family for New England</span>. The commissioners approved, and Cope agreed to terms paralleling those for E. M. Ward's complementary series in the commons' corridor: &pound;600 for each of eight frescoes in portable slate-backed frames. The Copes saw <span class="italic">The Embarkation</span> safely installed in October 1856 before going on a celebratory shopping spree. His work for the peers' corridor continued for a decade: in 1857 he finished <span class="italic">The Burial of Charles I</span>; in 1859 <span class="italic">The Parting of Lord and Lady William Russell</span>; in 1861 <span class="italic">Charles I Erecting his Standard at Nottingham</span>; in 1862 <span class="italic">Basing House Defended by the Cavaliers</span>; in 1864 <span class="italic">The Expulsion of the Fellows of a College at Oxford for Refusing to Sign the Covenant</span>; in 1865 <span class="italic">The Setting out of the Train Bands to Raise the Siege of Gloucester</span>; and finally, in 1866, <span class="italic">Speaker Lenthall Asserting the Privileges of the Commons Against Charles I</span>. They have been described as &#145;supreme achievements of the Victorian vision of the British past, brilliant recreations of lost moments of time within the Artist-Antiquarian tradition&#146;  (Strong, 141).<h2>
<a name="Otheractivities"></a>Other activities</h2>&#145;I had little time left for oil-painting&#146;, Cope wrote in his <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, &#145;and what I did execute consisted mostly of small pictures of a domestic character, done from my own children, so that Mr Tom Taylor in his criticisms dubbed me &#147;Poet Laureate of the Nursery&#148;&#146;  (Cope, 157). The numerous examples of such works include <span class="italic">The Young Mother</span> (exh. RA, 1846) and <span class="italic">Mother and Child</span> (exh. RA, 1853), both bought by Sheepshanks and now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. But Cope still painted historical scenes, including the reception of Cardinal Wolsey in 1530 at Leicester Abbey (exh. RA, 1848), commissioned by the prince consort and placed in Osborne House; the martyrdom of Laurence Saunders in 1555 (exh. RA, 1851); and Princess Elizabeth lying dead in 1650 at Carisbrooke Castle (exh. RA, 1855).<br>
<br>Cope also showed two oil versions of his fresco subjects: <span class="italic">The Embarkation</span> (exh. RA, 1856), sold in 1864 to the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, and <span class="italic">Lord and Lady William Russell</span> (exh. RA, 1861). From Shakespeare he drew several subjects: <span class="italic">King Lear and Cordelia</span> (exh. RA, 1850), for I. K. Brunel's Shakespeare room; <span class="italic">Othello Relating his Adventures</span> (exh. RA, 1851) and <span class="italic">Cordelia Receiving the News of her Father's Ill-Treatment</span> (exh. RA, 1859). Five Copes, including three from the Sheepshanks collection, went to Paris for the Universal Exhibition in 1855, and five reappeared among the art treasures at Manchester in 1857.<br>
<br>Cope found time to go fishing with Mark Pattison, but he was increasingly busy at the academy. He had served on the council and the committee of arrangement. In 1863 he appeared as a witness before the Royal Academy commission; in 1866 he was elected to the professorship of painting, a post which he held until 1875. On 28 July 1868 he suffered a grievous blow, the death of his beloved Charlotte, mother of his ten children. With his son, Charles, and his wife, he made a brief trip to Belgium for a change of scene, but &#145;Work alone&#146;, he recalled, &#145;could divert my thoughts&#146;  (Cope, 269). He sent three pictures to the academy in 1869, and he accepted appointment in 1870 as examiner in painting at the schools of art in South Kensington.<br>
<br>During the 1870s Cope completed two paintings destined for institutions: <span class="italic">Mr Guy and Dr Mead Considering the Architect's Plans for the Proposed New Hospital</span> (exh. RA, 1871), presented to Guy's Hospital; and <span class="italic">The Council of the Royal Academy&#151;Selection of Pictures</span> (exh. RA, 1876), placed in the academy. In 1876 he travelled to the United States to represent the academy at the centennial exposition in Philadelphia, and chaired the international committee that judged paintings and awarded medals. In 1879 he left his house in Hyde Park Gate and stayed first with his daughter, Margaret, in Herefordshire. Then he went to Charles and his wife at Maplestead, Essex, and there met Eleanor Smart, an old family friend and sister of a former pupil. &#145;She took pity&#146;, Cope said, &#145;on my solitude&#146;  (Cope, 335). They were married on 19 November 1879 at Barnet, with Charles and the bride's brother officiating, and soon settled in a house at Maidenhead.<h2>
<a name="Deathandassessment"></a>Death and assessment</h2>Cope sent his last pictures to the Royal Academy in 1882 and became in 1883 an honorary retired member; but he continued to go up to London for varnishing days and liked to arrange large family gatherings, with lunch, for the private views. At Maidenhead he amused himself by painting, bicycling about the countryside with a sketchbook, and going on the river. After a brief illness he died on 21 August 1890 at Bournemouth, with his wife and four of his children at his side. Several of the ten children had predeceased him. The eldest survivor, the Revd Charles Henry Cope, edited and completed <span class="italic">Reminiscences of Charles West Cope</span> (1891), adding a chronological list of paintings, some letters (1843&#150;4) about work on <span class="italic">Edward the Black Prince</span>, the evidence given before the Royal Academy commission (1863), and a version of his father's report to the Royal Academy (1876) on his experiences at Philadelphia. The third son, Arthur Stockdale Cope, followed his father into the Royal Academy and the Athenaeum.<br>
<br>Charles West Cope was a highly proficient artist and a worthy academician: he had a good eye, drew well, and learned all that he then could about various techniques, especially fresco. The critics generally, although at times impressed by his accomplishments or touched by his tender domestic scenes, discerned no remarkable flair and no compelling reason to extol him. John Ruskin, for example, had little more to say about Cope's picture of Princess Elizabeth lying dead than that it was a &#145;very beautiful and well-chosen subject, not ill painted&#146;  (Ruskin, 20). On the other hand, Prince Albert and Sir Charles Eastlake recognized Cope's strengths&#151;his talent for dramatic narrative in a lucid and monumental style which was virtually an English reinvention of Italian Renaissance fresco&#151;and many artists had warm professional and personal regard for him. Daniel Maclise, fellow painter of frescoes in the new houses of parliament, wrote in 1849 that Cope's cartoon of Prince Henry and Chief Justice Gascoigne was &#145;learnedly drawn and practically designed, and suited admirably for the monumental character of fresco art&#146;  (O'Driscoll, 98). The words come close to predicting why, in the national memory, Cope's most important works would be his frescoes in the House of Lords and the peers' corridor.<br>
