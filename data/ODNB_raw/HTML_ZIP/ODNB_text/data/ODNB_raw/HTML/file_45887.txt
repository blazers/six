<span class="headword">Compton,  Edward</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Edward  Compton Mackenzie]</span>  (1854&#150;1918), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born on 14 January 1854 at 16 Charing Cross Road, London, the fifth of the nine children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6033/', "Charles Mackenzie, known as Henry Compton (1805&#150;1877)")</script>, an actor, and Emmeline Montague Compton (1823&#150;1911). He was educated at the academy run by the Revd J. Gaitskell, formerly the class-master of the Kensington proprietary grammar school. His first stage appearance was at the Bristol New Theatre, on 22 September 1873, in the small role of Long Ned in F. Boyle's <span class="italic">Old London</span>. In April 1874 he joined the Francis Fairlie Touring Company, playing parts in Alfred Kempe's <span class="italic">East Lynne</span>, C. R. Munro's <span class="italic">Progress</span>, and Sheridan's <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>. Then followed stock seasons in Bristol, Glasgow, Kilmarnock, Liverpool, and Birmingham. He made his first appearance in London at his father's benefit at Drury Lane on 1 March 1877, playing Alfred Evelyn in the first act of Bulwer-Lytton's <span class="italic">Money</span>. He also appeared in his father's second benefit in Manchester, on 27 March 1877.<br>
<br>Compton appeared briefly with companies organized by H. J. Byron and by Mrs Hermann Vezin. For two years from 22 October 1877 he toured with a company organized by Ellen Wallis, appearing as Cassio, Malcolm, Romeo, Florizal, and Benedick, as Charles Surface in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>, and as Claude Melnotte in Bulwer-Lytton's <span class="italic">The Lady of Lyons</span>. On 23 April 1879 he played Claudio in <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span> at the dedication of the Shakespearian Memorial Theatre at Stratford upon Avon. During the same year, through Tinsley Brothers, London, he and his brother Charles published their <span class="italic">Memoir of Henry Compton</span>.<br>
<br>Edward Compton next joined the Adelphi Theatre, London, and accepted the invitation of its star, Adelaide Neilson, to accompany her on her next American tour. The company sailed on 27 September 1879. They played in New York, Boston, and New Orleans before concluding performances in San Francisco on 17 July 1880. The tour was a critical and financial success, netting in excess of &pound;15,000. However, it was also physically exhausting for the star and for her company.<br>
<br>On 28 July 1880 the Neilson company sailed from New York, bound for London. Miss Neilson then continued on to Paris to rest and to prepare her trousseau for her planned marriage that September to Edward Compton. While driving in the Bois de Boulogne on the morning of Sunday 15 August 1880 she was suddenly stricken with a ruptured aneurysm, and she died several hours later. The service and burial took place at Brompton cemetery on 20 August 1880.<br>
<br>By the terms of her existing will, Miss Neilson made several specific bequests, among them a gift of &pound;2000 to Compton. Although he briefly returned to the Adelphi company following his fianc&eacute;e's death, the gift allowed him to create and equip his own touring repertory troupe, the Compton Comedy Company, which, for the next thirty-five years, presented Shakespearian plays and old English comedies throughout the United Kingdom. The company made its first appearance at Southport on 7 February 1881.<br>
<br>As his leading lady Compton selected <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60241/', "Virginia Frances Bateman (1853&#150;1940)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1666/', "Bateman, Hezekiah Linthicum")</script>], who had recently finished an engagement at her mother's New Sadler's Wells Theatre, playing Miss Hardcastle in Oliver Goldsmith's <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span>, Lydia Languish in Sheridan's <span class="italic">The Rivals</span>, and Lady Teazle in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>.<br>
<br>On 12 June 1882 Compton and Virginia Bateman were married at St Peter's parish church, Brighton. They had five children: the novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31392/', "Sir Edward Montague Compton Mackenzie (1883&#150;1972)")</script> and the actors Frank Compton (1885&#150;1964), Viola Compton (1886&#150;1971), Ellen Compton (1891&#150;1970), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30957/', "Fay Compton (1894&#150;1978)")</script>.<br>
<br>By 1891 the Compton Comedy Company had toured for ten years, having given approximately 3000 performances in the British provinces&#151;most notably <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span> a total of 398 times, Thomas Holcroft's <span class="italic">The Road to Ruin</span> 367 times, T. W. Robertson's <span class="italic">David Garrick</span> 391 times, <span class="italic">The Rivals</span> 287 times, and <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span> 234 times. Believing the time was right for the company to move to London, and realizing that a vehicle by a celebrity author would make an impression, Compton, at the urging of his wife, wrote to Henry James to request that he turn his popular novel <span class="italic">The American</span> into an actable drama. James agreed, but recorded in his notebooks that &#145;The field is common, but it is wide and free &hellip; And if there is money in it that will greatly help&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Notebooks</span>, 53).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The American</span> was first presented by the Compton Comedy Company on 3 January 1891 in Southport, with Edward Compton playing Christopher Newman, the American. The premi&egrave;re succeeded beyond the author's reserved expectations, as he gleefully described to his sister the &#145;big universal outbreak at the end for &#147;author, <i>author</i>, AUTHOR!&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Henry James: Letters</span>, 3.320).<br>
<br>Compton secured the Opera Comique for the first London presentation of <span class="italic">The American</span> on 26 September 1891. Again he played Christopher Newman, but now cast his sister-in-law Mrs Crowe (Kate Bateman) as the Marquise de Bellegarde, and a young American, Elizabeth Robins, as the heroine, Claire de Cintr&eacute;. Although the celebrity-studded first-night audience may have anticipated a new dawn of English drama from the facile pen of so eminent a novelist as James, they were to be disappointed by heavy-handed melodrama, convoluted twists of plot, uneven pacing, and painfully poor performances by several members of the cast. As one critic described the scene:<blockquote>The audience was much amused and rather interested by the first act, less amused and more interested by the second, still less amused and rather less interested by the third, and not at all amused and barely interested by the fourth. Then the curtain came down, the people kindly clapped their hands as a means of stretching themselves, the actors appeared and bowed, &hellip; and those in front of the curtain went away rather bored and much disappointed, while those behind departed full of false hope. (<span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, 28 Sept 1891, 2)</blockquote>Despite a well-publicized visit by the prince of Wales and some tinkering with the production, <span class="italic">The American</span> closed on 4 December 1891, after only sixty-nine performances, handing its manager a great disappointment and a heavy financial loss. Edward's son Sir Compton Mackenzie described his father's reaction:<blockquote>He realised that it was not his destiny to be a leading London actor&#150;manager and went back to the provinces where he was so much loved, and where in a white wig instead of a toupee and with patches instead of a false moustache he would be making much more money and doing far more for British drama than by trying to establish himself in London. (Mackenzie, <span class="italic">My Life and Times</span>, octave 2, 22)</blockquote>While the Compton Comedy Company continued to tour the British provinces, Compton, in association with Milton Bode, acquired proprietary interest in several provincial and suburban theatres. In August 1915, as plans were under way for a return of the company to London at the Shaftesbury Theatre, he became ill and plans were suspended. He died at his home, 54 Avonmore Road, London, of throat cancer, on 16 July 1918.<br>
<br>Two months later, as Mrs Virginia Compton prepared to relaunch the company on an autumn tour, one theatre critic commented:<blockquote>it would be impossible, without much delving into the past, to give the list of the famous actors and actresses who learnt their early stagecraft under Mr. Edward Compton's banner. His work rivals that of Sir Frank Benson, and he was a man just as much loved &hellip; we shall miss him. (<span class="italic">Bristol Times and Mirror</span>, 28 Sept 1918)</blockquote>The Compton Comedy Company continued to tour the provinces until 26 July 1923, when financial losses could no longer be borne, and it was disbanded.<br>
