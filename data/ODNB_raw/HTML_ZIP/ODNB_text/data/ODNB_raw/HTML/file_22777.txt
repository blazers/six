<span class="headword">Prichard,  Rhys <span class="st"> [Rice]</span></span>  (<em>c.</em>1573<span class="mult">x</span>9&#150;1644/5), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and poet</span>, was born at Llandovery, Carmarthenshire, the eldest son of Dafydd ap Richard of Llandovery, and his wife, Mary. His birth date depends on Anthony Wood's assumption that he was eighteen when he entered Jesus College, Oxford, in 1597, but an exchequer deposition in 1642 described him as &#145;clerk, 69 years or thereabouts&#146;  (Evans, 182), which puts his birth nearer 1573. In 1602 he was ordained priest and appointed as curate of Witham, Essex, on 20 April; he graduated BA on 26 June, and was presented to the living of Llandingad with Llanfair-ar-y-bryn in Llandovery on 6 August.<br>
<br>The date of Prichard's marriage to Gwenllian is not known, and only one child is ever mentioned, Samuel or Sami bach (&#145;dear/little Sami&#146;) of the poems (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1605), who died before his parents. In his youth Sami vexed his father somewhat, but in a letter from Oxford (5 June 1623) he repented: &#145;My sinns I doe bewaile and with dayly prayer I will crave the almightie to forgiue&#146;  (Jones, 20). These youthful indiscretions gave rise to stories of a louche life and dissolute ways, and he figures in the folklore of the Tywi and Teifi valleys as the lover of various heiresses who met his death by drowning at a young age. In reality Samuel met his future wife, Francis Hardinge, at Oxford, married her and served as his father's curate, before himself becoming rector of Llanynys, Brecknockshire. They had two children, Elizabeth and Rice. Elizabeth, who married Thomas, the son of Bishop Mainwaring of St David's, was anxious to see her grandfather's work published &#145;provided it be done in the Original Language in which they were wrote and not translated into English or otherwise altered as some have done&#146;.<br>
<br>The only works published during Prichard's lifetime appeared in 1617: <span class="italic">Y catechism nev athrawiaeth Gristianogawl, rhwn y mae pob plentyn y ddyscu, cyn iddo gael y vedydd episcob: neu y dderbyn yr cumm&ucirc;n bendigedig</span> (&#145;The catechism or Christian doctrine which every child is to learn before he receives confirmation or is received into holy communion&#146;), and a poem, <span class="italic">Cyngor episcob I bob enaid oddi vewn I episcobeth</span> (&#145;A bishop's advice to every soul within his diocese&#146;). These texts, though on the same theme and bound together, are separate entities, and the poem begins with a direct, personal address to his son, &#145;F'annwyl blentyn dere nes&#146; (&#145;My dear child come nearer&#146;), but its title, like that of the catechism, encompasses everyone in a diocese. The <span class="italic">Catechism</span> was inspired by a zeal to educate the illiterate members of his parish, as were his popular little quatrains, and shows that he was well aware of the literary and religious fashions of the day.<br>
<br>Prichard's catechism is the first surviving Welsh printed catechism separate from the prayer book, although there are earlier examples recorded in the Stationers' register, of which no copies have survived. The basic text is that of Archbishop Cranmer's 1552 prayer book, translated by William Salesbury and published in 1567 in an orthographically eccentric version, but Prichard also used Bishop William Morgan's version, published in 1599, which largely eschews the peculiarities of Salesbury. The last part of the catechism provides a good example of Prichard's own translating skills; he incorporates a discussion of the importance of the sacraments of baptism and the eucharist which were added to the prayer book after the Hampton Court conference of 1604, and here Prichard had no earlier translation to guide him. He used vivid phrases, dialect forms, and substantives as he did in his demotic quatrains, and the directness and simplicity of his vocabulary reveal the same sure touch. There is anecdotal evidence that he was a charismatic and successful preacher, although this mostly dates from the post-Methodist revival period which stressed preaching. There is direct evidence from the poems that he himself favoured preaching, even advising people to travel to another parish to hear a sermon if there was none in their parish or if the preacher lacked conviction. This was not acceptable Anglican practice.<br>
<br>Prichard's importance lies in his hundreds of quatrains on all sorts of subjects, from the mysteries of Christian doctrine to the benefits of breast-feeding babies and the nutritional value of vegetables. His biggest concern was to help the poor&#151;first by making good use of the pitifully few resources to which they had access, and second (but more importantly) by helping them to understand the Christian gospel. Despite his love of preaching he realized that few of his listeners would understand or remember theological discourse or the usual homilies of the Anglican church; on the other hand, since they readily picked up songs and ballads heard in fairs and markets, he decided to use these simple forms to teach some of the more abstruse doctrines of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, in addition to telling vivid stories from the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> over and over again. He stated his intention clearly: it was because people tended to forget a sermon but easily remembered a frivolous song that he turned these verses/lessons into songs, &#145;for you, the Welsh&#146;. He added, self deprecatingly:<blockquote>
<div>I sought no intricate work,<br>
</div>
<div>but a smooth, perfect metre,<br>
</div>
<div>Easy to learn in a short time<br>
</div>
<div>by all who hear it thrice.<br>
</div> (Jones, 34)</blockquote>Consequently, he was not afraid of repeating himself and many favourite lines were recycled, while characters from the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> or classical antiquity turn up time and again as role models&#151;Daniel and Alexander the Great being particular favourites, the latter sometimes praised as a good man but at other times used as a warning against drunkenness and pride.<br>
<br>Prichard had a successful clerical career and acquired several livings; in 1613 James I appointed him rector of Llanedi, to be held with Llandovery, and in 1614 he became prebendary of the collegiate church at Brecon. In 1626 he was appointed chancellor and a canon of St David's, with the living of Llawhaden. He was diligent in his chapter work, and his distinctive signature occurs frequently in its muniments. Despite his loyalty to the king during the civil war he resented the taxes levied by the commissioners of array, and a letter of 1642 voices his dismay at his assessment of &pound;200, when his &#145;Meanes&#146; was in &#145;Deires or little farmes&#146; from which he received only payment in kind.<br>
<br>The first edition of Prichard's poems predated 1659, and from then on editions came frequently; the first collection of four parts in 1672 by Stephen Hughes was followed by another in 1681 the first to be known as <span class="italic">Canwyll y Cymry</span> (&#145;The Welshmen's Candle&#146;). Fifty-two editions appeared before 1820. The early printing may have obviated the need to preserve his manuscripts, and only recently are works in his hand being recognized, such as the volume of notes for a sermon found in MS Jesus 145, in the Bodleian Library, and a collection of drafts of poems on eight narrow folios bound into a later manuscript, NL Wales, 15416 E, in Aberystwyth.<br>
<br>Prichard's signature appears in the chapter records of St David's on 2 August 1643. On 2 December 1644 he made his will, leaving bequests to his wife, his daughter-in-law and her children, and others in his family, as well as money to the town of Llandovery to fund a free school. He died at Llandovery&#151;when exactly is not known, nor was his will proved; his burial place is unknown but was probably in the chancel of Llandingad church, where he had served for more than forty years.<br>
