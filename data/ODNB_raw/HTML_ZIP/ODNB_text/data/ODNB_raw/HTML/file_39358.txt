<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Erasmus,  Desiderius</span>  (<em>c.</em>1467&#150;1536), <span class="occ">humanist scholar and reformer</span>, was born in Rotterdam during the night of 27&#150;28 October in the late 1460s&#151;a year about 1467 seems plausible. He was illegitimate, a circumstance that doubtless contributed to the uncertainty attending all record of his origins, family name, and early life. The source of much information is the <span class="italic">Compendium vitae</span>, ostensibly written by Erasmus and clearly tendentious, and in any case known only from the seventeenth century. Earlier accounts, likewise tendentious in stressing both his youth and reluctance to enter a religious order, include the versions he wrote to popes Julius II and Leo X to gain the dispensations he needed to earn his own living while still in religious vows. With the assistance of his correspondence and other contemporary evidence, one may aim at reasonable conjecture. His father, who came from near Gouda, was Gerard Helye; his mother was one Margareta, possibly the daughter of a physician of Zevenbergen near Breda. In the address of a papal brief he is called Erasmus Rogerii, suggesting either that his father's full name was Roger Gerard Helye, or that his mother's surname was Roger. He had a brother, Pieter, older by three years, and possibly a half-brother from his mother's earlier marriage; Erasmus was in touch with Pieter until the latter's death in 1527. Their father, who had earned his living in Italy as a scribe, was lettered in classical Latin and Greek, the aspiration of all those&#151;later known as &#145;humanists&#146;&#151;who sought in the civic life of antiquity the models for a revitalized political and religious culture in their own day. At some point he became a priest. Erasmus owned books from his library, and Greek manuscripts copied by him in Italy.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>The boys were provided with a good education. The young Erasmus was sent to the school of Pieter Winckel attached to the church of St John at Gouda and later, about 1475, to the school of the chapter of St Lebuin in Deventer, which rose to great prominence under its headmaster Alexander Hegius. Seemingly, his mother accompanied him to Deventer and fell a victim of the plague in 1483; his father died shortly afterwards. The two boys were then placed under the protection of three guardians, one of whom was Pieter Winckel. In 1484 they were sent to the school at 's-Hertogenbosch where they stayed at a hostel run by the Brethren of the Common Life. According to Erasmus, Winckel and the guardians pressed both boys to enter the religious life, although Erasmus longed to attend university. His account of the brethren is bitter and resentful, insisting that their main aim was to serve as recruiting sergeants for religious orders. At any rate, Pieter had already joined the canons regular of St Augustine at Sion near Delft when Erasmus joined the same congregation at Steyn, near Gouda, in 1487. He was by then about twenty years old, not sixteen as he later claimed. His earliest letters reveal that his life there was by no means unhappy, and that the Augustinian cloister was not at all inhospitable to humanistic studies. They also reveal his considerable mastery of the style and conventions of classical rhetoric, and his prominence within a literary circle of young Augustinians devoted to the cultivation of good letters.<br>
<br>Erasmus was ordained priest on 25 April 1492 by the bishop of Utrecht, and shortly afterwards, with the permission of his superiors, entered the service of the bishop of Cambrai, Hendrick van Bergen, as his secretary. While so employed he revised his first important work, <span class="italic">Antibarbari</span>, composed during his monastic years but unpublished until 1518. It is a manifesto defending classical learning as an indispensable adjunct to Christian revelation, and testifies strikingly to its author's literary gifts and already remarkable erudition. By September 1495 Hendrick had released Erasmus to take up theological studies at Paris, with some promise of continuing financial support. Their relationship continued until 1501 after which the bishop's subsidy&#151;never found sufficient&#151;was withdrawn. While studying at Paris (initially residing at the Coll&egrave;ge de Montaigu) he took pupils to supplement his income, among them the young William Blount, fourth Lord Mountjoy. In the summer of 1499 he accompanied Mountjoy to England. This was his d&eacute;but in a courtly and scholarly world which would be of lasting importance to him, a world as well on which he would leave a lasting mark.<h2>
<a name="EarlyperiodsofEnglishresidence14991506"></a>Early periods of English residence, 1499&#150;1506</h2>In the course of this first, brief visit Mountjoy's connections enabled Erasmus to befriend people who would later provide powerful support and congenial society, prominent among them Thomas More, who introduced him to the eight-year-old Prince Henry. Until January 1500 he stayed in Oxford at St Mary's College, the house of the Augustinian canons, where the prior, Richard Charnock, was a kindred spirit. In the company of such others as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5898/', "John Colet")</script>, William Grocyn, William Latimer, and Thomas Linacre, his resolve to devote himself to sacred studies was confirmed. Erasmus, whose literary reputation evidently had preceded him, had been recommended to Colet by Richard Charnock as a truly virtuous man. The two were near in age, and they formed a relationship which was close and enduring. Colet's lectures on the epistles of St Paul impressed Erasmus deeply. Since Erasmus was already convinced that theology should concern itself with conversion of life and the fostering of individual devotion through the study of the scriptures, rather than with the speculative sciences dear to the scholastics, their influence may well have been less decisive than was once claimed; it was probably Colet's non-scholastic approach to scripture that chiefly attracted the Dutch humanist. Certainly, Erasmus's confidence in the providential role of pagan wisdom and the importance of understanding classical antiquity to repristinate Christian evangelism&#151;convictions asserted in his as yet unpublished <span class="italic">Antibarbari</span>&#151;far exceeded that of Colet.<br>
<br>A second English friend of great importance, close also to Colet, was Thomas More. With Mountjoy, More and Colet were doubtless responsible for introducing Erasmus to his wide circle of influential friends and followers in Oxford, London, and Cambridge. In addition to those already mentioned, Cuthbert Tunstall, John Fisher, William Warham, Richard Fox, Christopher Urswick, Richard Pace, and John Clerk are notable. Erasmus's closer involvement with these would await his return. He left England for Paris in January 1500, deeply impressed with what he had found and praising his English associates to his friends. His overriding aim now was to acquire Greek before venturing further into sacred studies.<br>
<br>Subsequently Colet probably helped to finance Erasmus's return to England in 1505&#150;6, and the transcriptions of Erasmus's translation of the epistles and gospels made by Pieter Meghen (BL, Royal MS 1 E.v, 2 vols., and CUL, MS Dd 7. 3) are associated with Colet, whose pupil Thomas Lupset helped Erasmus to collate the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. Colet's support continued through the years, but the most striking evidence of their friendship was Erasmus's involvement in St Paul's School, founded by Colet with his own patrimony: revision of William Lily's advanced Latin syntax, the <span class="italic">De octo orationis partium constructione libellus</span>, first published anonymously in 1513; various Latin poems; the <span class="italic">Concio de puero Jesu</span>; and his treatise on rhetorical variation <span class="italic">De copia</span> (see below). Erasmus's <span class="italic">De ratione studii</span> was also written for St Paul's School. His admiration for Colet was evinced repeatedly throughout his lifetime, and he left an indelible portrait of him in a memorial letter written to Justus Jonas in June 1521.<h2>
<a name="TheAdagiorumchiliadesandEnchiridion"></a>The Adagiorum chiliades and Enchiridion</h2>A stepping-stone towards the mastery of Greek was Erasmus's first published book, the <span class="italic">Adagiorum collectanea</span>, printed in Paris in the summer of 1500 and dedicated to Mountjoy. It was a small quarto of 818 adages culled from Greek sources and printed in humanistic format, a new presence in the Paris book trade. It was also the harbinger of one of Erasmus's greatest achievements, the <span class="italic">Adagiorum chiliades</span> (&#145;ordered in thousands&#146;). In successive editions it grew, along with Erasmus's command of Greek authors, to become an invaluable quarry for the revived classical culture of Europe: in the <span class="italic">Chiliades</span> of 1508 the number of adages rose from 818 to 3260. This edition also revealed the potential of classical proverbs to serve as pegs on which to display curious byways of erudition or inspire reflections on the issues of the day. In successive editions the enrichment continued, providing 4151 adages in that of 1536, the year of his death.<br>
<br>In his Greek studies Erasmus turned further to editing the works of Jerome, a pathway also to his ultimate goal, revision of the <span class="roman">Vulgate</span> text of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, and he resumed his study of pagan Greek authors: Euripides, Lucian, Plutarch, and Libanius, along with the popular grammar of Theodore of Gaza. In the spring of 1501, driven by plague first from Paris, then from Orl&eacute;ans, he settled in Flanders where he met the Observant Franciscan reformer Jean Vitrier, who encouraged his study of St Paul and fostered his appreciation of Origen. In this atmosphere, while preparing to write his own commentary on the epistle to the <span class="roman">Romans</span>, he composed the <span class="italic">Enchiridion militis Christiani</span> (&#145;Handbook of the Christian knight&#146;), his first great pastoral essay, infused with citations from Origen's <span class="italic">Homilies</span>. It appeared in a collection of <span class="italic">Lucubratiunculae</span> from Antwerp in February 1503. This first edition attracted little attention, but in 1515 it was printed independently for the first time, and underwent seven more printings before that of 1518 by Froben, after which it swept Europe, so that by the end of the century there were seventy editions of the Latin text, and innumerable vernacular translations. The remarkable impact of this brief treatise, not obvious today, derived from its endorsement, with a strong Pauline emphasis, of the lay vocation to holiness in the Christian life as lived in the world. Erasmus's advocacy of life well led in the community&#151;&#145;the city as a monastery&#146;&#151;directed the faithful towards the renewal of the entire Christian polity rather than more monastic ideals. Additionally, with its broad undercurrent of mystical theology, it served as a spur to the contemplative revival in sixteenth-century Spain. A key addition to the 1518 version was the introductory letter to a reforming Benedictine abbot, Paul Volz, which was effectively an epitome of Erasmus's doctrine of personal piety and the Christian mission.<br>
<br>In Flanders, Erasmus continued his studies on the epistle to the <span class="roman">Romans</span>, made a brief attempt at Hebrew, and in 1504 discovered a manuscript of Lorenzo Valla's notes on the text of the <span class="roman">Vulgate</span> <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in the Premonstratensian abbey of Parc near Louvain. In 1505 he returned to England as the guest of Thomas More at Bucklersbury, where together they translated dialogues of Lucian, and Erasmus made a translation of Euripides' <span class="italic">Iphigeneia in Aulis</span> and <span class="italic">Hecuba</span> (dedicated to Archbishop Warham). That April, Josse Bade in Paris published Erasmus's edition of Valla's notes. Although his own approach would be more complex, Valla's was a further incentive to Erasmus in his driving ambition to revise the legacy of St Jerome in the Latin <span class="roman">Vulgate</span>. In April 1506 he apparently visited Cambridge during a royal progress to Walsingham, staying at Queens' College, of which John Fisher was president. Acquainted with Fisher through mutual friends, Erasmus was nominated for the degree of DTh, which however he did not take.<br>
<br>In May 1506 Erasmus left for Italy, professedly further to improve his knowledge of Greek, but this is the most obscure period of his adult life since no letters survive from his pen between December 1508 and April 1511. He took a doctorate in theology from the University of Turin by oral examination, witnessed the entry of the victorious Julius II into Bologna, and stayed with Aldus in Venice to prepare editions of Plautus, Seneca, and Terence's tragedies, and to complete the greatly enlarged <span class="italic">Adagiorum chiliades</span> of 1508. From Venice he travelled to Padua, Siena, and Rome, and visited the cave of the Sibyl at Cumae accompanied by his pupil Alexander Stewart, the illegitimate son of James IV of Scotland; in Naples, Alexander presented his tutor with a gem supposedly bearing the image of the boundary god Terminus, which Erasmus subsequently adopted as his personal symbol with the motto <i>Cedo nulli</i> (&#145;I yield to no one&#146;).<h2>
<a name="ThePraiseofFollyandtheCambridgeyears"></a>The Praise of Folly and the Cambridge years</h2>On the accession of Henry VIII to the English throne in April 1509, and at the urging of Mountjoy and Warham, Erasmus returned to England for the longest and most productive of his visits. He arrived in August that year at the home of Thomas More, where he completed his most famous literary work, the <span class="italic">Moriae encomium</span> (&#145;Praise of folly&#146;). This complex satire, a distillation of his critique of contemporary Christendom, did not appear until 1511, but by Erasmus's death in 1536 there were thirty-six Latin editions, with translations into Czech, French, and German. An Italian version followed in 1539, and Thomas Chaloner's English version in 1549. It was famous&#151;and notorious&#151;in his lifetime, and is the only product of his pen to survive intact into the modern era.<br>
<br>Like many other of Erasmus's works the <span class="italic">Folly</span> derived from classical antecedents: it is a mock encomium, a praise of folly by Folly herself with a punning allusion in the title to the author's English friend. It grew in time to be the centrepiece of Erasmus's tireless, satirical moralizing about the world as he found it and the professed ideals of those responsible for it. He himself insisted that it be understood as an essay in evangelical humanism, one entirely consistent with the purpose of the <span class="italic">Enchiridion</span>. Bantering and playful in tone for the most part, it is suffused with ambiguity and paradox to capture the interest of those who might otherwise have shunned the radicalism of its impudent assault on the established order of the day, assailing everything from the uncritical acceptance of conventional pieties to real abuses of power and responsibility. None was spared, from princes to schoolmasters, from lawyers to monks, from philosophers and theologians to poets and grammarians like Erasmus himself. While the mask of Folly is always in place, the deeper purpose of the piece emerges with increasing clarity in the later pages: to contrast the Christendom of his own day with the ideals of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, especially as they were voiced by St Paul.<br>
<br>The years immediately following Erasmus's return to England are again obscure, but in 1511 he went to Paris to supervise the printing of the <span class="italic">Moriae encomium</span>, and on his return repaired to Cambridge at the invitation of John Fisher, now chancellor, where he stayed until 1514. He lectured in theology (on St Jerome) and on Greek&#151;the first person known to have done so at either university&#151;from the grammars of Manuel Chrysoloras and Theodore of Gaza. He edited the letters of St Jerome, completed his Latin translation of the epistles and gospels, the <span class="italic">Novum instrumentum</span>, and, among other like tasks, translated St Basil's commentary on <span class="roman">Isaiah</span> for presentation to Fisher. In early 1512 he finished his <span class="italic">De copia verborum ac rerum</span> (&#145;Foundations of the abundant style&#146;), his letters suggesting that he was by now quite at home in England. <span class="italic">De copia</span> was dedicated to Colet, and a revised and amplified edition of his Lucian translations was dedicated to Archbishop Warham, who in March appointed him rector of Aldington in Kent. The income from Aldington he commuted to a pension worth some &pound;20 a year, an amount matched by Mountjoy. For a time it appeared that he would accompany John Fisher to the Fifth Lateran Council as his theologian, but Fisher reconsidered, and in the end England was represented only by Silvestro Gigli, bishop of Worcester. In the summer of 1512 Erasmus joined the Cambridge scholar Robert Aldridge on a pilgrimage to the shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham, commemorated in his colloquy <span class="italic">Peregrinatio religionis ergo</span> (1526), and also went on a pilgrimage to Canterbury with John Colet. In July there was published in Paris the first authorized edition of the <span class="italic">De ratione studii</span>, the foundation of the curriculum at St Paul's School and, along with <span class="italic">De copia</span>, a widely influential treatise on the foundations of learning. At some point he also composed the epitaph on the tomb of Lady Margaret Beaufort in Henry VII's chapel in Westminster Abbey, for which he was paid &pound;20 in December.<br>
<br>During the following year, 1513, Erasmus continued his various undertakings, most notably further revision of the <span class="italic">Adagia</span>, along with a by-product of that revision, a compilation of aphorisms called the <span class="italic">Parabolae</span> (&#145;Parallels&#146;), the collation of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, and his edition of Jerome. In the latter tasks he enjoyed the assistance of Colet's prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Thomas Lupset, whom he praised in the same letter of 11 July 1513 in which he reminded Colet of a promise to provide the sum of 15 angels in return for dedicating the <span class="italic">De copia</span> to St Paul's School rather than to Prince Henry.<br>
<br>In January 1514, writing from Cambridge, Erasmus inscribed his translation of Plutarch's <span class="italic">De utilitate capienda ex inimicis</span> (&#145;On profiting from one's enemies&#146;) as a new year's gift to Thomas Wolsey. At the same time the worsening relations between England and France disturbed him. He wrote to Warham of an acute attack of the stone, which he attributed to the Cambridge beer and scarcity of French wine owing to the prospect of war, and in March told Antoon van Bergen of rising prices, the threat to his income, the scarcity of French wine, and England's growing isolation from the continent. Accordingly, he looked to the Netherlands&#151;to Prince Charles and the emperor Maximilian&#151;for new support. The argument of this important letter was the basis of his adage <span class="italic">Dulce bellum inexpertis</span> (&#145;War is sweet to those who know it not&#146;), one of those published in the Froben edition of 1515 and destined to have an independent life, with fifteen separate printings before 1540. By early June he was staying in London at the house of Andrea Ammonio, and after making his farewells to the king, to Wolsey, Warham, Ruthall, and Fisher, he crossed the channel in early July, arriving at the castle of Hammes near Calais on the 8th, to stay with his patron Mountjoy. Here he composed a letter for Servatius Roger, prior of Steyn, excusing himself for his failure to return to his home monastery, one of a series of such <i>apologiae</i> from which the variable details of his early life must be construed.<h2>
<a name="BaselandtheNewTestament"></a>Basel and the New Testament</h2>By July 1514 Erasmus was undoubtedly ready to make for the Froben press with the fruits of his studies in the previous decade. These included a greatly revised and expanded version of the <span class="italic">Adagia</span>, his revision of the letters of Jerome, his revised text of Seneca, a number of translations from Plutarch, the <span class="italic">Parabolae</span>, and his accumulated work on the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, a substantial part of which had been done in England. From this last grew Froben's historic undertaking: the printing of the Greek text of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> with Erasmus's new Latin translation and annotations. He proceeded up the Rhine to Basel, a journey that took him to Mainz and Strasbourg especially; there he was f&ecirc;ted by societies of German humanists, among whom he met Ulrich von Hutten, Jakob Wimpheling, Sebastian Brant, and the educator Jakob Sturm. His reception in Basel by Johannes Froben, Beatus Rhenanus, and many others was no less warm.<br>
<br>In September 1514 Erasmus for the first time stated that what was to be published of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> was his Latin translation &#145;with the Greek facing&#146; and his notes  (<span class="italic">Opus epistolarum</span>, ep. 305). In the first edition (<span class="italic">Novum instrumentum</span>, 1516) the Greek was printed with Erasmus's Latin rendering in parallel, while his annotations, keyed to the established <span class="roman">Vulgate</span> and unprecedented in their scope and references to Greek texts, were printed separately. Erasmus's constant purpose was to provide a reasoned revision of the <span class="roman">Vulgate</span> in his annotations. But it was the Greek text&#151;a late addition possibly suggested to Froben by the annotations themselves&#151;combined with his Latin translation that made the widest and most enduring impression. The work was reprinted 229 times in the course of the sixteenth century, and fostered allied treatises. These included the <span class="italic">Paraclesis</span> (&#145;Exhortation&#146;), an impassioned plea for a life informed by the word incarnate which introduced the <span class="italic">Novum instrumentum</span> and acquired independent celebrity, and Erasmus's <span class="italic">Paraphrases</span> on the books of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, intended to make the text accessible to the lay reader.<br>
<br>The year 1516 also saw the appearance of Froben's great edition of the works of Jerome in nine volumes, for the first four of which&#151;containing chiefly the letters and dedicated to Archbishop Warham&#151;Erasmus had special responsibility. And finally, Thomas More's <span class="italic">Utopia</span>, whose publication More had entrusted to Erasmus, appeared that December at Louvain. From this time Erasmus was increasingly taken up with activities on the continent, but contacts with his English friends continued for many years, and it will be expedient to deal briefly with the rest of his career before returning to the more complex question of his influence in England.<br>
<br>Except for trips to Froben in Basel and occasional visits to England, Erasmus spent the years from 1514 to 1521 chiefly in Brabant, moving about between Louvain, Bruges, and Antwerp. He was closely involved in the project for a trilingual college at Louvain, initiated in 1517, and his appointment as an imperial councillor early in 1516 kept him close to Brussels. His <span class="italic">Institutio principis Christiani</span> (&#145;Education of a Christian prince&#146;), published in 1516, had been completed in recognition of this appointment, and in October 1520 he attended the coronation of Charles V as king of the Romans at Aachen. There were occasional forays to England, chiefly on business concerning his pension, and the obtaining of a papal dispensation from Leo X which would allow him to earn his own living while still retaining his religious vows. The growing tumult around Luther worried him lest he be indirectly discredited by it, and he employed every rhetorical means at his disposal to distance his own proposals from Luther's, while urging that Luther himself &#145;be put right rather than put down&#146;. In November 1521 Erasmus left Brabant for good, and returned to Basel.<h2>
<a name="ControversyandtheBaselyears15221529"></a>Controversy and the Basel years, 1522&#150;1529</h2>From this point onwards controversy was a constant preoccupation for Erasmus. It had begun already in 1517 with conservative critics of his great editorial projects, the Jerome edition and <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. Among the first of these was the English Franciscan Henry Standish, an Oxford theologian and provincial of his order. Another vexed issue was Erasmus's ardent advocacy of &#145;trilingualism&#146;, a doctrine shared within the humanist circle that mastery of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew was essential for the renewal of learning, more especially of theology. It was one of the reasons why Erasmus's scholarly base in those years was Louvain, where the project for a trilingual college was finally realized within the university in 1520. Yet one of his chief opponents on this issue also resided at Louvain, Jacobus Latomus (Jacques Masson). The <span class="italic">Novum instrumentum</span> in turn brought a new wave of critics, first among them another Englishman, Edward Lee, a Cambridge divine and prebendary of Lincoln. Lee was soon joined by several friars, among them the Carmelite prior at Louvain, Nicolaus Baechem, and several Louvain Dominicans. In the same years Erasmus collaborated with Johannes Faber, prior of the Dominican house, in a project for mediation in the dispute with Luther. This was the <span class="italic">Consilium cuiusdam</span>, published in Cologne in 1521, a companion piece to the eirenic <span class="italic">Axiomata Erasmi pro causa Lutheri</span> written at the request of the elector of Saxony, which contained twenty-two short axioms on which to base a settlement of the whole affair.<br>
<br>Luther's manifest intransigence and the propagation of his own <span class="italic">Colloquia</span> were the dominant preoccupation of Erasmus's years in Basel, although he continued tirelessly to publish: successive revisions of the <span class="italic">Adagia</span>, paraphrases on the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> (<span class="roman">Hebrews</span>, <span class="roman">Matthew</span>, <span class="roman">Luke</span>, <span class="roman">John</span>, <span class="roman">Mark</span>, <span class="roman">Acts</span>), editions of such fathers as Arnobius, Hilary, Irenaeus, and Augustine, classical texts (Cicero, Pliny, Seneca), and other humanistic and pedagogical works in abundance (<span class="italic">De conscribendis epistolis</span>, <span class="italic">Lingua</span>, <span class="italic">De civilitate morum puerilium</span>, <span class="italic">Christiani matrimonii institutio</span>, <span class="italic">Ciceronianus</span>, <span class="italic">De recta Latini Graecique sermonis pronuntiatione dialogus</span>, <span class="italic">De pueris instituendis</span>).<br>
<br>If the <span class="italic">Adagia</span> and the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> represent the scholarly cornerstones of Erasmus's literary and theological enterprises, then the <span class="italic">Colloquia</span> were the summation of his satirical campaign against the follies of the day and misuse of power, ecclesiastical and secular. Derived from his own teaching experience and rooted in the rhetorical handbooks of the later middle ages, the <span class="italic">Colloquia</span> were first adumbrated in the unauthorized <span class="italic">Familiarium colloquiorum formulae</span> from the Froben press in Basel in November 1518, apparently printed from a text belonging to a friend of Erasmus's Paris years, Augustinus Vincentius Caminadus, a fellow tutor and sometime room-mate. Erasmus made corrections in the Froben edition of 1519, and the book was reprinted at least thirty times before March 1522. In 1522 Froben published a much enhanced version, after which the work appeared at regular intervals, new colloquies being added sporadically, until the final edition of Erasmus's lifetime in 1533. In successive revisions the constantly amplified <span class="italic">Colloquia</span> became a running, often trenchant, commentary on the affairs of the day. As the fully developed dialogues they now were, they experienced countless reprintings throughout Europe, both authorized and pirated, virtually initiating a new literary genre. They also reflect frequently their author's experience of England, dealing with such subject matter as St Paul's School, Thomas More, John Colet, and pilgrimages to Walsingham and to Canterbury.<h2>
<a name="ControversywithMartinLuther"></a>Controversy with Martin Luther</h2>Erasmus's collision with Martin Luther marked a divergence within the community of reformers that was of lasting import. Luther was one of those in the generation after Erasmus who could not but be a pupil of the pre-eminent northern humanist's achievement as a pioneering editor of the fathers and of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, as well as an educational propagandist and master of satire: the <span class="italic">Adagia</span>, the <span class="italic">Enchiridion</span>, and the <span class="italic">Moria</span> were all a part of Luther's formation, but important above all was Erasmus's Greek <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. Luther's earlier training was scholastic, not humanistic, and his attitude to Erasmus was from the first ambivalent. After Luther's open break with Rome in his publications of 1520 Erasmus was seen by him increasingly as, at best, a half-hearted ally, if not indeed an obstacle to the kind of revolution Luther thought essential, while Erasmus was more and more concerned by Luther's apparent indifference to the unity of the church. Under pressure from Rome, from Duke Georg of Saxony, and from many other quarters including the English court, Erasmus finally took up his pen in public opposition to Luther on an issue that was central not only to the latter's doctrine, but to the humanist's reform programme: the issue of the freedom of the will.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">De libero arbitrio diatribe</span> (literally, a &#145;discussion&#146; of free will), issued by Froben in September 1524 (an advance copy had been sent to Henry VIII in March) was a measured response to Luther's <span class="italic">Assertio omnium articulorum per bullam Leonis X</span>. In the <span class="italic">Assertio</span> Luther had replied, article by article, to the bull of Leo X condemning his views, <span class="italic">Exsurge domine</span> (15 June 1520). Article 36 of <span class="italic">Exsurge domine</span> proclaimed free will, and in his reply Luther repudiated the orthodox Catholic teaching that by their own freely willed good deeds, performed in a proper relationship to divine grace, human beings might contribute to their own salvation. This was Erasmus's chosen ground of debate. He upheld the traditional view, drawing heavily upon scripture, on the fathers, and on the consensus of belief throughout earlier centuries. Luther's reply <span class="italic">De servo arbitrio</span> (&#145;On the enslaved will&#146;), which appeared in December 1525, was an aggressive rebuttal, section by section, point by point, to <span class="italic">De libero arbitrio</span>. Stung by his tone and belligerence Erasmus, convinced now that Luther was resolved to disrupt Christendom, denounced his reckless arrogance and insolence, and turned to a lengthy response. This was <span class="italic">Hyperaspistes diatribae adversus servum arbitrium Martini Lutheri</span> (&#145;A warrior shielding a discussion of free will against the enslaved will of Martin Luther&#146;), the first part of which appeared in March 1526. The second, three times as long as the first, appeared in September of the following year.<br>
<br>The exchange between the two men, arguing over the same scriptural texts, reflected their contrasting intellectual formations. Where Erasmus's approach was inductive and consensual, Luther's was deductive and systematic, from the outset placing the biblical texts in a doctrinal framework. Where Erasmus accepted diversity in the understanding of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, appealing to the larger context of Christian practice and tradition, Luther's hermeneutic was impelled by his central conviction that human collaboration could contribute nothing to salvation, which proceeds from God's grace alone. Behind these differences lay contrasting anthropologies. Luther saw man as determined by his being wholly a sinner; Erasmus emphasized his vocation as a &#145;new creation&#146; capable of serving God. At base, Erasmus thought that within the unfathomable mystery posed by God's omnipotence over against the fate of individuals, the human experience of freedom could not be dismissed, that Luther's doctrine of human unfreedom could not be proved in scripture, and that in any case to proclaim it publicly could have only disastrous consequences for the mass of believers already lethargic about their Christian calling. His concern was, as usual, more pastoral than doctrinal, so that what was all-important to Luther was of secondary interest only to Erasmus.<br>
<br>The argument with Luther was not Erasmus's only concern, however, and his involvement with neighbouring reformers&#151;Huldrych Zwingli in Z&uuml;rich, Johannes Oecolampadius in Basel, and Martin Bucer in Strasbourg&#151;impinged more directly on his personal fortunes. These were men who found Erasmus's humanist approaches much more congenial than did Luther, and who could appeal to the Dutch reformer's utterances in support of their own more radical opinions. Within a few months of his arrival in Basel, Erasmus intervened with eirenic intentions in a local row over compulsory fasting with a treatise <span class="italic">De esu carnium</span> (&#145;On the eating of meat&#146;), which questioned the entire status of man-made ecclesiastical laws (including celibacy). His many earlier attacks on such rules as a &#145;legalism&#146; opposed to &#145;evangelical freedom&#146; were now hostages to fate, since reformers like Zwingli were prepared to cite him in support of their views, and to demand the entire abolition of such practices in the name of the gospel. Erasmus disagreed, seeing in such demands only a new legalism. <span class="italic">De esu carnium</span> appealed to the bishops, on the one hand, to show pastoral prudence and openness, and to the reformers to act with moderation within the established church. His stand pleased neither side. His personal view of the church as an evolving community of faith under the perpetual tuition of the Holy Spirit put preservation of its unity and spiritual harmony above all other imperatives, but for those of a more doctrinaire turn of mind this was incomprehensible. Protestant and Catholic critics alike rejected or simply failed to comprehend his pneumatic ecclesiology and hermeneutic theology. The former envisaged the church almost entirely under the aspect of the Holy Spirit through the ages, while the latter shunned scholastic definitions of doctrine in favour of a core of belief drawn simply from the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and the teachings of the early fathers. A subsequent row over the eucharist, provoked by Oecolampadius, exposed Erasmus's profound sympathy with a view that was not in accord with the <i>consensus ecclesiae</i>, to which nevertheless Erasmus loyally adhered. The theologians of Louvain and Paris took up the cry, and in 1526 the <span class="italic">Colloquia</span> were condemned, the first censures to be passed against his writings. As Catholic critics from Spain as well as France took up their pens, his <span class="italic">Apologia adversus monachos quosdam Hispanos</span> (1528) addressed their dangerous accusation that he questioned the very doctrine of the Trinity. His vulnerability to the scrutiny of systematic theologians was again demonstrated, as it had been with Luther.<h2>
<a name="Thefinalyears15291536"></a>The final years, 1529&#150;1536</h2>In April 1529, driven from Basel by the radical party's successful campaign of iconoclasm and the replacement of the mass by compulsory celebration of communion in the protestant rite, Erasmus saw his independence imperilled and removed his household to Freiburg im Breisgau, a Catholic city within the territories of the Archduke Ferdinand. His <span class="italic">Epistola in pseudevangelicos</span> later that year stated his position, without withdrawing his familiar objections to the church of the day. Although editions and revisions continued to pour from his study, his most substantial new achievement in the last years was the final version of <span class="italic">Ecclesiastes</span> (1535), an extensive treatise on preaching which is also rich in theological reflection. His <span class="italic">De sarcienda ecclesiae concordia</span> of 1533 (&#145;On repairing the unity of the church&#146;), a long reflection on <span class="roman">Psalm 83 (84)</span>, was an eirenic r&eacute;sum&eacute; of his position on the need both for appropriate reforms and for diversity of observance within a unified church. It gave satisfaction neither in Rome nor in Wittenberg and, like other of Erasmus's late works, reflected both a less sanguine view of the prospects for reform through education and a more cautious attitude to what mere human powers could achieve.<br>
<br>Debilitated by failing health, in 1534 Erasmus returned to Basel where a more accommodating religious policy now prevailed, and where he was sought by his old friend and influential associate, Bonifacius Amerbach, who became his heir and executor. He died at Zum Luft, Basel, the house of Hieronymus Froben, son of the printer Johann, of dysentery during the night of 11 July 1536 and was buried on the 18th in the cathedral. The most important component of his estate was the so-called &#145;Legatum Erasmianum&#146;, a sum of 5000 florins invested at 5 per cent with the duke of W&uuml;rttemburg and the city of Geneva to provide support for students and the poor.<h2>
<a name="InfluenceinEngland"></a>Influence in England</h2>Erasmus's influence on the generation that came of age under Henry VIII was immense, especially in education. Episcopal and aristocratic patrons of his project included Richard Fox of Winchester, John Fisher of Rochester, and Lady Margaret Beaufort, all connected to Erasmus and key figures in the establishment of humanism in the universities. The names of Roger Ascham, Sir John Cheke, Leonard Cox, Richard Croke, Sir Thomas Elyot, Thomas Lupset, Thomas Paynell, Thomas Ruthall, Cuthbert Tunstall, Nicholas Udall, and Christopher Urswick must be added to those just mentioned as instrumental in the promotion of the Erasmian agenda directly or indirectly. There was also a notable translation industry involving predictably the <span class="italic">Paraclesis</span> (1529), <span class="italic">Enchiridion</span> (1533), and <span class="italic">Praise of Folly</span> (1549), but including works of devotion and, most prominently, the <span class="italic">Paraphrases</span> on the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> on the initiative of Queen Katherine Parr. By royal injunction of 1547 the latter were to be made accessible in every parish in the realm along with the <span class="roman">Great Bible</span>.<br>
<br>To the list of adherents the name of Thomas Cranmer should be added, but direct citations of Erasmus in Cranmer's reforms of the liturgy are conspicuously absent. While it is tempting to think that the patristic orientation and ecclesiologically conservative character of the later Anglican settlement reflected the views of Erasmus, it is impossible to document such a continuing influence. Nevertheless in England he was generally regarded as an honorary protestant. Bishop Edward Stillingfleet (1635&#150;1699) saw him as the father of Anglican moderation, while Alexander Pope, who had been brought up a Catholic, hailed Erasmus as &#145;that great, injur'd name&#146;, and praised him as the man who revived the study of letters after they had been corrupted by superstitious monks, &#145;those holy Vandals&#146;  (<span class="italic">Essay on Criticism</span>, ll. 693&#150;6). The first English biographer of Erasmus, Samuel Knight (1677/8&#150;1746), saw him chiefly as a scholar and writer. John Jortin (1698&#150;1770), whose two-volume study was more influential, acknowledged Erasmus's sincere adherence to the Roman church despite his criticisms, and provided a sympathetic estimate of his religion with influential extracts from Erasmus's works. His reputation as an eirenicist and advocate of peace was already clear, as it would be on the continent.<br>
<br>The first English Catholic to compose a biography was Charles Butler (1750&#150;1832), of old recusant stock, who was also a student of Grotius. Relying heavily on the earlier biographies, Butler admired Erasmus for his contributions to learning, sacred and profane, and criticized him chiefly for presenting abuses in the church as universal when they were not. Arthur Lionel Smith (1850&#150;1924), a liberal protestant admirer, saw Erasmus as the most representative proponent of the Renaissance, anti-ecclesiastical and anti-dogmatic. In his admiration of Erasmus's moderation and partiality to gradual reform as opposed to Luther's violence, he fairly sums up the congenial attitude of most English authors to the Dutch reformer. It should be added, however, that it was Charles Reade's <span class="italic">The Cloister and the Hearth</span> (1861), a romantic reconstruction of Erasmus's origins, based largely on the <span class="italic">Compendium vitae</span>, that fixed Erasmus's story in the minds of most readers in later generations.<br>
<br>The modern critical study began with the monumental life's work of Percy Stafford Allen (1869&#150;1933), the assembly and ordering of Erasmus's vast correspondence. This established for the first time a reliable framework within which the works could be located, and the development of Erasmus's thought explored. Its consummation is the new critical edition from Amsterdam along with the wealth of scholarship developed in the wake of the Second World War and the Second Vatican Council, after which Erasmus's eirenicism, advocacy of a European polity, and insistence that Christians agree to concentrate on the essentials of the gospel message acquired new relevance and urgency. He remains one of the architects of modern scholarship as a paradigm of critical intelligence and unflagging industry, and as an admired advocate of international peace and concord.<br>
