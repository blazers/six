<span class="headword">Carter <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Fantl]</span>,  Ernestine Marie</span>  (1906&#150;1983), <span class="occ">museum curator and writer on fashion</span>, was born on 10 October 1906 in Savannah, Georgia, USA, the daughter of Siegfried Fantl. Carter was brought up in Savannah. She graduated from Wellesley College, Massachusetts, in 1927, where, remarkably for the time, she studied modern and contemporary art and design under the tutelage of Alfred Barr. She worked as a curatorial assistant at New York's newly formed Museum of Modern Art and from 1933 to 1937 she was its curator of architecture and industrial art. In 1936 she married the British antiquarian book dealer and bibliographer, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30904/', "John Waynflete Carter (1905&#150;1975)")</script>, and later took up permanent residence in London.<br>
<br>During the Second World War she worked on exhibitions for the Ministry of Information, and edited a propaganda book of photographs, some specially commissioned from Lee Miller, <span class="italic">Grim Glory: Pictures of Britain under Fire</span> (1941). It was popular enough to go into five printings. Later in the war she worked for the American office of war information in London, &#145;explaining America to England&#146;  (Carter, 62). She worked on the fashion component of the important design exhibition &#145;Britain can make it&#146;, organized by the Council for Industrial Design and held at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in 1946. From 1946 to 1949 she was fashion editor for <span class="italic">Harper's Bazaar</span>. Her first trip to Paris for the magazine was to report on Christian Dior's exhilarating first <i>haute couture</i> fashion show in 1947. Carter's newspaper writing began with a cookery column for <span class="italic">The Observer</span> from 1952 to 1954, during which time her lively cookbook <span class="italic">Flash in the Pan</span> (1953) was published. In 1955 she began editing the woman's page of the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, becoming associate editor of the paper in 1968. She was appointed OBE in 1964. She retired in 1972 and wrote discerning, well-illustrated books on fashion history: <span class="italic">20th Century Fashion: a Scrapbook</span> (1975), <span class="italic">The Changing World of Fashion</span> (1977), and <span class="italic">Magic Names of Fashion</span> (1980). Her vivid autobiography, <span class="italic">With Tongue in Chic</span> (1974), includes much of interest to fashion history. Ernestine Carter died at her home, 113 Dovehouse Street, Chelsea, London, on 1 August 1983.<br>
<br>Carter wrote lucidly about fashion in its widest sense. &#145;To me fashion is essentially people &hellip; I wrote about them all&#146;  (Carter, 179). She communicated the excitement and importance of fashion as it developed through the 1940s and 1950s. Looking back on the late 1940s as &#145;halcyon years&#146; for couture, she judged the &#145;unforgettable&#146; and &#145;voluptuous&#146; new look to be unsurpassed as the most universally becoming and enduring fashion ever devised  (ibid., 75&#150;8). It is hard to imagine a more auspicious moment for her to start her career in fashion journalism. She took fashion seriously, a rare approach in post-war Britain, and was irritated by intellectually snobbish dismissal of fashion as frivolous, declaring it was &#145;surely no more frivolous than architecture, to which it is closely related&#146;  (ibid., 181). She interpreted developments in Paris fashion to her British readers, then later played a crucial role in nurturing British designer talent. Carter used her opportunities on the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> to help modernize a then Conservative newspaper and forcefully to encourage the emergence of London as a major fashion centre in the 1960s. Her insight was to recognize that this new order was symptomatic of major social shifts. Her education and curatorial experience gave her a trained eye; this combined with pithy, intelligent prose, great energy, and uncompromising standards. On the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> she became an authoritative figure in the fashion world.<br>
<br>The Museum of Costume at Bath benefits from her foresight, which led to the donation of 2000 fashion photographs from her newspaper, dating from 1958 to 1972, known as the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> fashion archive. Not surprisingly, Carter enjoyed fine clothes herself. Some are in the museum. Her personal style was distinctively neat and tailored, avoiding extremes of fashion.<br>
