<span class="headword">Seagrave <span class="st"> [Segrave]</span>,  Nicholas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1321), <span class="occ">administrator and soldier</span>, lord of Stowe, Northamptonshire, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25039/', "Nicholas of Seagrave, first Lord Seagrave (1238?&#150;1295)")</script>, and his wife, Matilda de Lucy. He was born later than 1256, the probable year of birth of his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25038/', "John Seagrave, second Lord Seagrave")</script>. It was probably he, rather than his father, who served as castellan of Dumbarton and Ayr castles in 1291&#150;2. He was first summoned to parliament, as &#145;Nicholas de Seagrave, junior&#146;, in August 1295, and continued to be so summoned until 1321. He was present at Falkirk in 1298, and at the siege of Caerlaverock in 1300, where he served in the retinue of the earl of Hereford. On 12 February 1301 he sealed the barons' letter of grievances to the pope as &#145;Nicholas de Seagrave, lord of Stow&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1301 Seagrave was involved in a dispute over the manor of Chrishall, Essex, with Walter Langton, bishop of Lichfield, which was eventually settled before the king at Evesham. In the same year he and his wife, Alice, were accused along with numerous others of breaking houses of Ralph de Monthermer, earl of Gloucester and Hertford, near Kingston, Berkshire. During the Scottish campaign of 1303&#150;4 Seagrave became involved in a heated dispute with John Cromwell. When Edward I refused to allow Seagrave's challenge to trial by combat, he deserted the king's army in order to travel to France, there to seek trial by battle. He managed to cross to France despite the efforts of Robert de Burghersh, warden of the Cinque Ports and constable of Dover, but was arrested at Dover upon his return. Although he was rescued by twenty-one barons of Dover and returned to his manor of Stowe, he was summoned from there by the sheriff of Northampton in January 1305 to appear before parliament at Westminster. He submitted himself to the king's judgment in parliament. He was apparently sentenced to death, but was sent to the Tower of London instead, and later released on the security of his own letters patent and seven mainpernors. He was quickly restored to the favour of Edward I, and he served with the king on his final Scottish campaign in 1307. On 23 February 1308 he was released from his obligations by Edward II.<br>
<br>Seagrave was one of Edward II's staunchest supporters at the outset of the reign. In the crisis of March 1308 he was appointed custodian of Northampton Castle, and even after the banishment of Piers Gaveston, he was one of four royal councillors singled out to be removed from the court by the Northampton parliament of August 1308. Despite this, there is little evidence that Seagrave played a major role at court. He is very rarely found among the witnesses to royal charters before 1312, and his vilification in 1308 may have had more to do with his adherence to Thomas, earl of Lancaster, still loyal to the king at this time, than to his own activities.<br>
<br>On 12 March 1308 Seagrave had been appointed marshal of England, although his right to this office was challenged unsuccessfully by William le Mareschal. Indeed, in July 1311 the king forbade both to come to parliament armed, in consequence of their dispute. Seagrave's tenure of this office may also have been the occasion of one early conflict between the earl of Lancaster and the king. As marshal, Seagrave was entitled to appoint the marshal of the exchequer. His first appointee, Elias de Pouger, died in September 1310 and was replaced by Jocelin Brankescombe. Seagrave was in Scotland at the time, but later confirmed the appointment. At Michaelmas 1311, however, the king replaced Brankescombe with Arnald de Tilly, a Gascon associated with Gaveston, who was soon thereafter singled out for banishment in the supplement to the ordinances. The barons of the exchequer were ordered to accept Seagrave's nominee as marshal of the exchequer once again. Although Seagrave himself hardly seems to have been a central player in this drama as reported in the <span class="italic">Vita Edwardi secundi</span>, it may well have affected his relationship with the king over time. On 20 September 1312, in the tense atmosphere prevailing after the execution of Piers Gaveston by the baronial opposition, Seagrave was part of a delegation including the earl of Pembroke, the elder Despenser, Edmund Mauley, and John Cromwell, that went to the Guildhall in London to ask for increased security in defending the city against the king's enemies. On 20 December he acted on behalf of the king along with the earl of Pembroke and the elder Despenser in witnessing the treaty between Edward II and his barons. He continues to appear occasionally as a witness in the charter rolls in 1313 and 1314, but after 6 December 1314 his name appears only once more, on 20 May 1319 at York. Presumably his continuing service to the earl of Lancaster, whose retainer he remained throughout the reign until his death, made his early position at court increasingly untenable.<br>
<br>In 1316 Seagrave was deprived of the marshalship, which was granted to Edward II's half-brother, Thomas of Brotherton. In 1317 the king issued orders for Seagrave's apprehension and the seizure of his lands, along with similar orders for other of Lancaster's adherents, but these orders were cancelled on 24 September of the same year. In 1318 he was one of Lancaster's retainers pardoned for all offences committed before 7 August, and he was also named to a committee to set the agenda for the upcoming parliament. In 1318&#150;19 he served with the earl of Lancaster in Scotland with four knights and ten men and was present at the siege of Berwick. He attended the Westminster parliament of October 1320 on behalf of the earl of Lancaster. In January 1321 he was named as one of the magnates empowered to meet with Robert Bruce. On 21 April 1321 he was one of several magnates ordered not to attend illegal assemblies, and on 12 November of the same year was forbidden to attend the meeting of the &#145;good Peers&#146;. He died on 25 November 1321.<br>
<br>Seagrave held considerable lands in Northamptonshire, Suffolk, and Essex. He obtained the manor of Stowe through his marriage to Alice, daughter of Geoffrey of Armenters and widow of Gerard Lisle, and the castle at Barton Seagrave. His heir was his daughter Maud, aged twenty-five and more at the time of his death, who married Edmund de Bohun of Church Brampton, Northamptonshire. Seagrave is described in <span class="italic">The Siege of Carlaverock</span> as one &#145;whom nature had adorned in body and enriched in heart&#146;.<br>
