<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Drummond, Dame  (Edith) Margaret</span>  (1917&#150;1987), <span class="occ">director of the Women's Royal Naval Service</span>, was born on 4 September 1917 at 101 Dundonald Road, Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, one of at least two daughters of Robert James Drummond, professor at the dairy school of the West of Scotland Agricultural College, and his wife, Marion Street. She was educated at Park School, Glasgow, and Aberdeen University. She joined the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS) as a Wren writer in April 1941 and, after her administrative skills had been made apparent, she was commissioned as an officer in September that year.<br>
<br>Rising swiftly through the ranks, Drummond served early in 1944 as a first officer on the staff of the commander-in-chief, Plymouth command, and was responsible for the administration and paperwork relating to the command's role in operation Neptune, the allied landings in Normandy in June 1944. She was the first woman to know about the invasion; as Dame Katharine Furse recounted, &#145;About two months before D-Day she received twenty copies of the naval plans for invasion; she signed for them, and almost slept with them in the strong room, one of the cellars under Mount Wise&#146;  (Furse, 232).<br>
<br>After D-day Drummond sailed for India where she worked as assistant secretary to the flag officer, helping with the instruction of the Wrens of the Indian navy, then became superintendent on the staff of the commander-in-chief, East Indies. Back in Britain, her tours of duty included that of officer in charge of HMS <i>Dauntless</i>&#151;the Wrens' initial training establishment, as superintendent of the WRNS officers' training course at Greenwich, and as superintendent of training and drafting. She rose to be deputy director, became an OBE in 1960, and was appointed director in June 1964.<br>
<br>During her tenure Drummond oversaw the organization of the new WRNS units in Singapore and Mauritius. She was also called before a Commons select committee to explain how it had come about that the WRNS was not subject to the <span class="roman">Naval Discipline Act</span>, an anomaly that was rectified only in 1977. She was created DBE in 1966, and she retired in 1967.<br>
<br>Dame Margaret Drummond settled at Somersham Cottage, Saxlingham, on the north Norfolk coast, where she immersed herself in village life and, as a devoted Christian, to local church activities. A keen gardener, she still found time to chair a civil service interview board. She was a popular member of the community, and was affectionately remembered for her kindness, dignity, sincerity, and honour. Drummond died at her sister's house, Manor Cottage, 15 High Street, Holt, on 21 April 1987, after several years of failing health. She never lost contact with the service she loved, and was a life member and vice-president of the Association of Wrens and of the WRNS Benevolent Trust.<br>
