<span class="headword">Mountford,  Edward William</span>  (1855&#150;1908), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 22 September 1855 at Shipston-on-Stour, Worcestershire, the son of Edward Mountford, draper, and his wife, Eliza Devonshire, daughter of William and Mary Richards of Northampton. He was twice married: first, on 28 June 1888, to Jessie Elizabeth, daughter of John Saunders Smith of Northampton, in whose memory he furnished the south chapel of St Anne's Church, St Ann's Hill, London (a building by Sir Robert Smirke); and second, on 11 July 1903, to Dorothy, daughter of A. G. Hounsham of Hampstead Heath. He had a son, who followed him as an architect, from his first marriage, and a daughter from his second.<br>
<br>Mountford grew up in the Cotswolds and was educated privately at Clevedon, Somerset. In 1872 he was articled to Habershon and Pite, architects, and subsequently worked for them as a clerk of works. Lacking the connections that might have secured him patronage, he was employed as assistant to Messrs George Elkington and to Messrs Giles and Gough, before beginning independent practice in 1881. His early works were modest commissions in his native Worcestershire, beginning with a cottage hospital in Shipston-on-Stour. In collaboration with H. D. Appleton (also known as H. D. Searles-Wood) he built a few south London churches in the fourteenth-century Gothic style; and this type of commission formed an occasional part of his employment throughout his career. In his first decade of practice, however, lack of employment left him free to enter numerous competitions.<br>
<br>Mountford's first real success was in winning the Sheffield town hall competition (1890); and thereafter he was regularly a winner (later still an assessor) of major public competitions. Among the buildings he won in competition (and subsequently built) were: Battersea town hall (1892; now the arts centre); St Olave's Grammar School (1893; now part of the South London College); the Northampton Institute (1896; now City University); and the central criminal court at the Old Bailey (1900&#150;07), which replaced Newgate prison of 1769 and is probably Mountford's most important work. Among his other significant buildings were: Liverpool Technical College (1898); Booth's distillery, Cow Cross Street, Smithfield (1901; dem.); offices and flats at 34 Sloane Square, London (1905); the Northern Insurance Company building, 1 Moorgate, London (1906; with E. A. Gr&uuml;ning); and Lancaster town hall (1906&#150;9), completed by his assistant and partner F. Dare Clapham. He was also among the architects invited to compete for the new Strand Crescent at the Aldwych (1900) and for London county hall (1907).<br>
<br>Mountford was one of the initiators of the &#145;Wrenaissance&#146; style in the 1890s and one of the most successful practitioners of its developed form of Edwardian baroque, winning a silver medal at the 1900 Paris Exhibition. He was committed to the association of sculpture and painting with architecture, and worked closely with the sculptors Paul Montford, F. W. Pomeroy, and Gilbert Seale, and with the painters Gerald Moira and Sir William Richmond. He also retained an attachment to the vernacular architecture of his childhood and designed his own house at Munstead, near Godalming, Surrey, in 1901, in collaboration with his wife and with the advice of his neighbour Gertrude Jekyll on the garden.<br>
<br>Mountford became an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1881 and a fellow in 1890; he served on its council and (1907&#150;8) on its prizes and studentships committee. From 1893 to 1895 he was president of the Architectural Association (AA) and acted as an advisory member of the AA school of architecture until his death. He was described as an antiquary  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 94, 15 Feb 1908, 274&#150;5) and travelled in Italy (1880) and later Egypt (for his health). He was also an ardent cricketer and member of the Surrey County Cricket Club. Crippled by arthritis in his mid-forties, he died at his London home, 11 Craven Hill, Lancaster Gate, London, on 7 February 1908.<br>
