<span class="headword">Hull,  (James) Alan</span>  (1945&#150;1995), <span class="occ">popular singer and songwriter</span>, was born on 20 February 1945 at 68 Sutton's Dwellings, Benwell, Newcastle upon Tyne, the home of his father, Anthony Hull, who was unemployed, his mother, Sarah (Sally), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Broadbent, and his elder sister Moira. He attended Rutherford Grammar School, Newcastle. He was given a guitar at the age of twelve and wrote his first song soon afterwards. As a teenager he became lead guitarist in several amateur rock groups, one of which, the Chosen Few, recorded for Pye Records in 1965.<br>
<br>At twenty-one Hull began training as a psychiatric nurse at St Nicholas's Hospital, Newcastle, where he met Patricia Sharp 
    (known as Pat; <i>b</i>. 1940/41)
  . They were married on 22 August 1966, and had three daughters. During this period he wrote several of his most memorable songs, including &#145;Lady Eleanor&#146; and &#145;We Can Swing Together&#146;, and in 1973 a book of poems based on his experiences there, <span class="italic">The Mocking Horse</span>, was published by Spice Box Books. He left nursing in 1969 to concentrate on performing his songs and organized a folk club at the Rex Hotel, Whitley Bay. During 1969 he composed more than fifty songs while working as a window cleaner. Among those who appeared at his club was the local folk-rock group Brethren, with whom he teamed up.<br>
<br>The group signed a recording contract with the London-based Charisma Records, owned by Tony Stratton-Smith, and were renamed Lindisfarne by John Anthony, the producer of their first album, <span class="italic">Nicely out of Tune</span> (1970). This contained seven songs composed by Hull, including the psychedelic &#145;Clear White Light&#146;. Bob Dylan was a primary influence on Hull's songwriting and Dylan's former producer Bob Johnston was brought in from the United States to produce the next album, <span class="italic">Fog on the Tyne</span> (1971). The title-song was to become Hull's best-known composition, a singalong number with which Lindisfarne would end each concert. The song's status as a modern Geordie anthem was underlined in 1990, when the group re-recorded it with locally born soccer star Paul Gascoigne.<br>
<br>During 1971 Lindisfarne had top ten hits with &#145;Meet me on the Corner&#146;, composed by group member Rod Clements, and Hull's &#145;Lady Eleanor&#146;, inspired by Edgar Allan Poe. Hull again wrote most of the songs for the group's third album, <span class="italic">Dingly Dell</span> (1972). Among these were &#145;All Fall Down&#146;, &#145;Bring Down the Government&#146;, and &#145;Poor Old Ireland&#146;. Lindisfarne performed extensively in Europe, North America, and the Far East; the pressure of touring contributed largely to the group's dissolution in 1974. Hull had meanwhile made the solo album <span class="italic">Pipedream</span> (1973), which included &#145;Money Game&#146;, a sharp expression of his disillusionment with the music industry. He also composed the music for, and acted in, <span class="italic">Squire</span>, a 1975 BBC television play by the Newcastle writer Tom Pickard.<br>
<br>In 1976 the original members of Lindisfarne reunited for what would turn out to be the first of many Christmas concerts at Newcastle City Hall. The group toured occasionally and also recorded many new Alan Hull songs, including &#145;Run for Home&#146;, an international hit in 1978, and &#145;Dedicated Hound&#146;, an attack on music journalists. In 1983 Conservative members of parliament denounced his song &#145;Malvinas Melody&#146;, &#145;a criticism of war as a solution to disputes&#146;, whose title referred to the Falklands conflict of the previous year. Lindisfarne remained a vehicle for Hull's songs throughout the 1980s, and his final album with the group, <span class="italic">Elvis Lives on the Moon</span> (1993), included two of his most potent political commentaries, &#145;Day of the Jackal&#146; and &#145;Mother Russia&#146;.<br>
<br>Hull also made solo recordings as well as collaborating with Pickard in 1986 on <span class="italic">Heads Held High</span>, a musical show commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the Jarrow march. This reflected his lifelong commitment to socialism; for a time he was secretary of his local constituency Labour Party. He performed in Blackpool to coincide with the Labour Party conference in 1990 and played at numerous benefit concerts for striking or redundant miners and shipyard workers.<br>
<br>Alan Hull died of a heart attack at the General Hospital, North Shields, Northumberland, on 17 November 1995 and his ashes were scattered at the mouth of the River Tyne. His final composition, &#145;We can Make It&#146;, a celebration of northern working-class resilience, appeared on a posthumously released album, <span class="italic">Statues and Liberties</span>. This was completed by his musical collaborators, who included his son-in-law Dave Denholm.<br>
