<span class="headword">Hopkins, Sir  Frank Henry Edward</span>  (1910&#150;1990), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 23 June 1910 at The Poplars, Maldon Road, Wallington, Surrey, the fourth child and only son of Edward Frank Lumley Hopkins, solicitor, and his wife, Sybil Mary Walrond. He was educated at the Nautical College at Pangbourne, Berkshire, and joined the Royal Navy as a cadet on 16 September 1927. He served as a midshipman in the cruiser <i>London</i>, and then in destroyers before qualifying as an observer in 1934, flying from the aircraft-carriers <i>Furious</i> and <i>Courageous</i>. When war broke out in 1939, he was on the staff of HMS <i>Peregrine</i>, the naval observer school at Ford in Sussex. In 1940 he joined 826 naval air squadron, flying Fairey Albacores, covering the Dunkirk evacuation, bombing rail and road communications in Holland, and attacking enemy shipping off Zeebrugge, before operating for five months with Royal Air Force Coastal Command, making night attacks against targets in France, Belgium, and Holland. Hopkins was awarded the DSC in 1941.<br>
<br>In November 1940 his squadron embarked in the aircraft-carrier <i>Formidable</i> and sailed for the Mediterranean. On 28 March 1941 no. 826's aircraft made two torpedo attacks on ships of the Italian fleet off Cape Matapan. In a dusk attack, no. 826's aircraft torpedoed and crippled the heavy cruiser <i>Pola</i>. This led to a night action in which <i>Pola</i> and two more heavy cruisers, <i>Fiume</i> and <i>Zara</i>, were sunk with considerable loss of life. Hopkins was mentioned in dispatches (1941). On 6 December 1941 Hopkins took command of 830 naval air squadron, which flew Fairey Swordfish from Malta. Night after night he led his squadron on torpedo and bombing strikes which sank thousands of tons of axis shipping, seriously affecting supplies to Rommel's army in north Africa.<br>
<br>Late in January 1942 Hopkins led a striking force through a gale to search for a large enemy convoy on its way to Tripoli. By the time the planes found the convoy they were too short of fuel to attack so they returned to Malta, refuelled, took off again, found the convoy a second time, and sank a 13,000-ton troopship. When Hopkins landed at Hal Far, the naval air station in Malta, just after dawn, he had been in the air for more than twelve hours in flying conditions normally considered impossible. He received an immediate DSO (1942), an award which his squadron thought by no means over-generous.<br>
<br>Hopkins then joined the staff of the British air commission in Washington, DC, and he qualified as a pilot in 1944. As British naval air observer with the US Pacific Fleet, serving in the American carriers USS <i>Hancock</i> and <i>Intrepid</i>, he was present at the decisive defeat of the Japanese navy in the battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944. In 1945 he went to the Royal Navy Staff College, Greenwich, London, for two years on the directing staff. He went to Washington again in 1947, for two years as assistant naval air attach&eacute;. He was awarded the American Legion of Merit in 1948.<br>
<br>In 1949 Hopkins joined the light fleet aircraft-carrier <i>Theseus</i> as commander (air) and served in her in the Korean War from October 1950 until April 1951. Under Hopkins, <i>Theseus</i>'s air group was particularly energetic and successful in operations over Korea and in 1950 it won the Boyd trophy, awarded annually for the most outstanding feat of airmanship. Hopkins was again mentioned in dispatches (1950).<br>
<br>From 1951 to 1958 Hopkins was at the Admiralty as deputy director, naval air organization and training; was captain (D) of the 2 training squadron, commanding the destroyer <i>Myngs</i>; and was at the Admiralty again as director, naval air warfare. He also recommissioned the carrier <i>Ark Royal</i>, after a long and extensive refit, successfully commanding her through a difficult period with new aircraft, radar, and flight deck equipment. He then went to the Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, as the first naval aviator and the first public-school entry officer to command the college (1958&#150;60). In 1960 (the year he was promoted rear-admiral) he became flag officer, flying training, and in 1962 flag officer, aircraft-carriers.<br>
<br>Having become vice-admiral in 1962, in 1963 Hopkins was appointed deputy chief of naval staff and fifth sea lord. He now had to fight for the navy's future air power. The Royal Air Force set out to destroy plans for the projected new carrier, known as CVA 01, claiming that shore-based aircraft could do all that carrier aircraft could do, and more. When CVA 01 was cancelled in February 1966, the first sea lord and the first lord both resigned. Hopkins wanted to follow suit but was prevailed upon to stay and became commander-in-chief, Portsmouth, which he said was the most miserable appointment of his life. He was promoted admiral in 1966 and retired from the navy in 1967. He was made commander of the Swedish order of the Sword in 1954, appointed CB in 1961, and made KCB in 1964.<br>
<br>Hopkins worked his squadron hard, but with his reputation for gallantry and endurance he could ask anything of his aircrew. He was always introspective, and his experience with no. 830, when he risked his life almost every night, left its mark on him, but he had great personal charm and was an excellent dinner-table companion. He was a keen and expert helmsman and a member of the Royal yacht squadron.<br>
<br>Hopkins was a handsome man, even into old age, with sharp features, high cheekbones, and a keen gaze, quick to sum up a newcomer to ship or squadron. Although the marriage was not registered, about 1933 he married Joan Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ashwin (<i>d</i>. 1982), widow of Lieutenant-Commander John Standring RN. They had one daughter. They were divorced in 1937 and in 1939 he married Lois Barbara, daughter of James Robert Cook, of Cheam, Surrey, director of Cook, Hammond, and Kell, cartographers and printers. They had no children. Lois died in 1987 and he married in 1988 Georgianna Priest, the widow of an American naval officer he had met during the war. Latterly he lived half the year in Devon near Dartmouth, where his home was Kingswear Court Lodge, and half in Hawaii, USA. Hopkins died on 14 April 1990 in Hawaii, after a road accident there.<br>
