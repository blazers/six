<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Marshal,  William (II)</span>, fifth earl of Pembroke  (<em>c.</em>1190&#150;1231), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was born in Normandy, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18126/', "William (I) Marshal, earl of Pembroke")</script> and regent of England (<i>c</i>.1146&#150;1219), and his wife <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47208/', "Isabel de Clare (d. 1220)")</script>. In 1205 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14841/', "King John")</script>, unworthily doubting the elder William's loyalty, demanded his eldest son as a hostage, and a hostage he remained until 1212, by which time the king was in urgent need of the Marshal's support.<br>
<br>In the great crisis of his reign King John enjoyed the unswerving loyalty of the elder William, but his son aligned himself with the baronial opposition, possibly as a family insurance policy, and appeared in arms with the barons at Stamford in February 1215; he was later one of the twenty-five barons appointed to enforce the terms of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93691', "Enforcers of Magna Carta")</script>]. These proved unacceptable to both sides, and in the civil war that followed the younger William joined Prince Louis of France and was appointed marshal of his army. Though active in the field on the barons' behalf, he avoided any hostile confrontation with his father. Denied possession of Marlborough, once held by his paternal grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18122/', "John Marshal")</script>, by Louis he changed sides, capturing Winchester and Southampton for the royalists and Marlborough for himself, and fought in the decisive battle of Lincoln on 20 May 1217.<br>
<br>On his father's death in 1219 Marshal succeeded him as earl of Pembroke and marshal of England, and on his mother's death in 1220 succeeded to the lordships of Leinster and Netherwent. The Clare lands in Normandy passed by agreement to his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18124/', "Richard Marshal")</script>. A major problem faced by the government during the minority of Henry III was regaining for the crown or their rightful owners castles seized and retained by royalists during the civil war. Among the castles held by the earl were Fotheringhay and Marlborough. The return of Fotheringhay to John the Scot, earl of Huntingdon, was desirable to promote good relations with Scotland. The Marshal ignored orders to surrender Fotheringhay in 1219 and 1220 until events in Wales forced his hand. The peace of Worcester in 1218 had established Llywelyn ab Iorwerth as the king's bailiff, during his minority, of Cardigan and Carmarthen. Llywelyn promised to restore to marcher lords lands they had lost since 1215, but when in 1220 he stripped Rhys Gryg (one of the lords of the Welsh principality of Deheubarth) of two lordships, he disposed of them as he pleased. Then, alleging that the Marshal's tenants, with help from Leinster, had attacked their Welsh neighbours, he launched a savage attack on Pembrokeshire, capturing Narberth and Wiston castles and burning the town of Haverfordwest. To buy peace, the men of Pembroke were forced to promise not to repair the captured castles and to surrender lands to be held by Llywelyn on the king's behalf. William now demanded that the justiciar, Hubert de Burgh, should release his men from their obligations and assure them that Llywelyn had acted without royal authority. The answer was a new demand to surrender Fotheringhay. Eventually receiving the desired letters from the justiciar, the Marshal quietly gave up the castle.<br>
<br>In 1214 the marriage arranged in 1203 between the younger William Marshal and Alice, daughter of Baldwin de B&eacute;thune, count of Aumale, finally took place; but Alice soon died, probably in 1216. In 1221 the justiciar and the papal legate, Pandulf, in order to avoid the Marshal's making a foreign match and to attach him to the justiciar's party, proposed that he should marry <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46703/', "Eleanor (1215?&#150;1275)")</script>, the younger sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12950/', "Henry III")</script>. The marriage took place on 23 April 1224 and the Marshal surrendered Marlborough, a small price for a royal bride. Up to 1226 the Marshal remained a close ally of Hubert de Burgh.<br>
<br>In March 1223 Llywelyn suddenly attacked and captured the castles of Kinnerley and Whittington in Shropshire, and was consequently caught on the wrong foot by William Marshal, who attacked him in south-west Wales. A truce between the two was due to end on Easter Sunday (23 April). On 15 April the Marshal landed near St David's with an army from Leinster, and on Easter Monday, with a nice observance of the rules worthy of his father, attacked and took Cardigan. Two days later he took Carmarthen. Llywelyn sent an army south under his son Gruffudd, who burned Kidwelly and awaited attack. The Marshal appears to have had the better of the ensuing battle, before proceeding to strengthen the defences of Carmarthen and starting to build the immensely strong castle of Cilgerran. Attempts to reconcile the Marshal and Llywelyn having failed, the justiciar sent a large force of cavalry to the Marshal's help, enabling him to consolidate his gains, which included the castle and lordship of Kidwelly. Wisely, the Marshal secured two Welsh allies, Rhys Mechyll and Cynan ap Hywel, grandsons of the Lord Rhys of Deheubarth. Southern Ceredigion was overrun and given to Cynan. In September the justiciar with a large army occupied the lordship of Montgomery and established a castle on a new site. Llywelyn made peace in October, surrendering Kinnerley and Whittington, ceding Montgomery to the king, and accepting the <i>fait accompli</i> in the south-west. It was conceded that Welsh lords should regain lands they had held lawfully. Cynan ap Hywel ultimately surrendered southern Ceredigion to Maelgwn ap Rhys, and was compensated by the Marshal with the commote of Ystlwyf (Oysterlow) and the eastern commote of Emlyn. The earl retained the western commote as his lordship of Cilgerran, while in November 1223 he was granted the custody of Cardigan and Carmarthen. In south-west Wales the Marshal had effectively restored the <i>status quo</i> of 1215, and enabled the lords of Cemais, St Clears, Laugharne, Llansteffan, and Kidwelly to resume possession.<br>
<br>Following his successes in south-west Wales in 1223, William Marshal's attention switched to Ireland in 1224. The immediate occasion lay in the claim of Hugh de Lacy to the lordship of Ulster, of which he had been deprived by King John in 1210. Failing to negotiate its restoration, Lacy returned to Ireland late in 1223 to seize it by force, supported by his half-brother William and by many of the tenants of Mide, though not by his brother Walter, lord of Mide. William Marshal was appointed justiciar of Ireland on 2 May 1224, and crossed to Waterford in June. Basing himself on Dublin he besieged Trim, the principal castle of Mide, and sent a force to relieve Carrickfergus. Hugh de Lacy's alliance with the &Oacute; Neills was countered by alliance with the Irish lords of Connacht, Thomond, and Desmond. Trim fell in August, and Hugh was eventually forced to submit, Walter de Lacy regaining control of Mide. Surprisingly, Hugh was generously treated and was restored in Ulster in 1226.<br>
<br>Another awkward issue for William Marshal in Ireland lay in the de Burgh claim to Connacht. This had originated in the gift of Connacht which Prince John, as lord of Ireland, had made in the 1190s to William de Burgh, the brother of Hubert de Burgh, the future justiciar of England. However, in 1215 John as king made simultaneous grants of Connacht to Cathal &Oacute; Conchobhair and William de Burgh's son Richard. Cathal was succeeded in possession of Connacht by his son &Aacute;edh, who aided the Marshal during the Lacy rebellion. A plan to support Richard de Burgh's claim against &Aacute;edh was strongly opposed by the Marshal, who was consequently replaced as justiciar by Geoffrey Marsh in June 1226. He had to return to Ireland in 1227 to persuade his tenants of Leinster to surrender royal castles to Marsh. He continued to support &Aacute;edh &Oacute; Conchobhair, and lost the custody of Cardigan and Carmarthen as a further mark of the justiciar's displeasure.<br>
<br>In 1228, apparently considering that it was now time to compel Llywelyn to make good his promises of restoring march lands taken in 1215, Hubert de Burgh led a large army into the commote of Ceri. The Marshal was among the earls summoned to the army, but nothing is known of his part in a campaign which was a miserable failure, memorable only for the capture by the Welsh of William (V) de Briouze, and for the nickname, Hubert's Folly, which was given to a new castle started by the justiciar but abandoned within a month. A French campaign based on Brittany, aimed at recovering lost Angevin lands, was planned for 1229, but had to be postponed for a year. With twenty knights the Marshal sailed on the expedition in May 1230. Henry III received little save promises from the fickle lords of Poitou on a march from Nantes to Bordeaux and back. The Marshal, who conducted raids into Normandy and Anjou, was one of the few to come out of the campaign with any credit.<br>
<br>While he was a prisoner of Llywelyn in 1228&#150;9, William de Briouze had started a love affair with Llywelyn's wife Joan. In 1230, while visiting Llywelyn's court, Briouze's adultery was discovered and he was hanged, leaving no male heir to the Briouze marcher lordships. Their custody was entrusted to William Marshal, who, still overseas, deputed the task to his steward of Netherwent. Then in November 1230 Gilbert de Clare, lord of Glamorgan, died in Brittany, leaving his eight-year-old son Richard as his heir. The justiciar undertook the care of the Clare lordships. Finally, William Marshal returned to England for the wedding of his widowed sister, Isabella, to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23501/', "Richard of Cornwall (1209&#150;1272)")</script>, but died suddenly on 6 April 1231 in London. He had been the master of a huge accumulation of lordships in southern England and Ireland, as well as in south Wales and the Welsh march. Within a year the three most powerful marcher lords of south Wales had died, giving Llywelyn an opportunity which he promptly seized.<br>
<br>William (II) Marshal was buried on 15 April beside his father in the Temple Church. Undoubtedly a good administrator and soldier (he was a notable builder of castles, responsible for Carlow in Leinster, and for Cilgerran and much of Chepstow on the Welsh march), he did not display the statesmanship of his father. Nevertheless, his successful campaign of 1223 secured for the south-western marches a period of comparative security which lasted until the late 1250s. In Pembrokeshire he granted three charters to Haverfordwest. Leinster, where he continued his father's work, bringing in new settlers, founding boroughs and new castles, and fostering religious houses, enjoyed a period of stability and peace under his rule.<br>
<br>Because there were no children of William (II) Marshal's marriage to Eleanor, his heir was his brother Richard, who was killed in 1234 when in rebellion against Henry III. As part of the subsequent reconciliation between king and rebels, Richard's brother and heir <a name="cosubject_18121"></a><span class="headword">Gilbert Marshal</span>, seventh earl of Pembroke  (<em>d.</em> 1241)<span class="occ"></span>, was permitted to succeed to the earldom of Pembroke. Although in the years 1234&#150;5 Gilbert received many marks of royal favour and held important posts in Wales, he was never fully trusted and there was much in his behaviour to antagonize the king. When Llewelyn died in April 1240 Gilbert and his brother <a name="cosubject_18125"></a><span class="headword">Walter Marshal</span>, eighth earl of Pembroke  (<em>d.</em> 1245)<span class="occ"></span>, were quick to resume hostilities in south-west Wales. Walter recaptured Cardigan, lost to the Welsh in 1231, but Gilbert's scheme to force Maelgwn Fychan to hold southern Ceredigion as his vassal was soon frustrated by the king. In June 1241 Gilbert was killed in a riding accident at an unlicensed tournament at Dunstable. After some delay Walter was admitted to the earldom. He served in the army which went to Gascony in 1242, but although his Pembrokeshire tenants were active in the Welsh war which broke out in 1244, Walter does not seem to have taken part in person. He had fallen ill by July 1245 at Goodrich and died on 24 November, to be followed about a month later by his younger brother <a name="cosubject_18119"></a><span class="headword">Anselm Marshal</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1245)<span class="occ"></span> who was never admitted to the earldom of Pembroke. All five Marshal brothers died without legitimate children and their massive inheritance was subsequently divided between the representatives of their five sisters and coheiresses. Among the families which benefited, then or later, were those of Bigod, Clare, Ferrers, Mortimer, Bohun, Cantilupe, Valence, and Hastings.<br>
