<span class="headword">Davenport,  Samuel</span>  (1783&#150;1867), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born in the parish of St John, Bedford, on 10 December 1783, and was baptized on 14 May 1784 at St Paul's Church, Bedford, the son of Samuel and Jemima Davenport. His sister Maria was baptized on 22 August 1788 at St Mary's, Bedford. His father was a land surveyor and architect, and the family moved early in Samuel's life to London. From about 1797 to 1804 he was apprenticed to the engraver Charles Warren, following him in the illustration of books. He later specialized in outline portrait work, much of which appeared in contemporary publications: Redgrave records that 700 were done for a single work, possibly one of the serials then popular.<br>
<br>On 31 May 1819 at St Pancras Old Church London, Davenport married Sarah Castle with whom he had a son, Samuel Thomas Davenport, who worked for the Royal Society of Arts from 1843 to 1875. In 1839 Pigot's <span class="italic">Directory of London</span> gave his address as 38 Myddleton Street, Clerkenwell, London  (Pigot, 111). Owing doubtless to Charles Warren's influence, Davenport was an early exponent of steel-engraving, which he used for his major series of engravings for the British annual <span class="italic">Forget-me-Not</span> in the volumes published between 1828 and 1842 after artists such as Henry Corbould and H. C. Shenton, who was Warren's pupil and eventually son-in-law. Davenport contributed four plates to a new edition of William Hogarth's <span class="italic">Works</span>, published in 1833. A departure from his previous work came with the production of forty-eight views to accompany the four volumes of the Revd G. N. Wright's <span class="italic">New and Comprehensive Gazetteer</span> (1834&#150;8). He contributed the ten illustrations on steel to George Cruikshank's <span class="italic">Eighty-Two Illustrations on Steel, Stone and Wood</span> (<i>c</i>.1870), finely engraved and remarkably preserving the artist's sense of caricature, formerly achieved through etching. Most of his plates were in line on copper or steel and signed Davenport, but S. Davenport and S. Devonport are also known. He was almost certainly the author or part-author of an article on book illustration in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Society of Arts</span> (January 1865), and was also the author of <span class="italic">Engraving</span>, a pamphlet published in the series <span class="roman">British Manufacturing Industries</span> by Edward Stanford, edited by G. Phillips Beavan, some parts of which were issued in the 1870s. Davenport died on 14 or 15 July 1867 at his home, 38 Myddleton Street, Clerkenwell, London, of senile decay, leaving a widow, his second wife, Frances. His death certificate described him as a historical line engraver.<br>
