<span class="headword">Whyte,  Alexander</span>  (1836&#150;1921), <span class="occ">United Free Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born at Kirriemuir, Forfarshire, on 13 January 1836. His parents were John Whyte (1812&#150;1871) and Janet Thomson (<i>d</i>. 1882); they never married. His father left Kirriemuir and Alexander was brought up by his mother, who earned her living as a weaver and harvester; the boy owed much to her influence, and to that of two local ministers and several keenly intelligent artisans. Abandoning the shoemaking trade, to which he had served his apprenticeship, Whyte taught for four years in village schools. At the age of twenty-two (1858) he matriculated in King's College, Aberdeen, and, supporting himself mainly by teaching evening classes, succeeded in graduating as MA with second-class honours in mental philosophy in 1862. Sir William Duguid Geddes and Alexander Bain were the professors who made the deepest impression on him. During this period he became acquainted with the writings of Thomas Goodwin the elder, and Goodwin's influence persisted to the end of his life.<br>
<br>Whyte decided to enter the ministry of the Free Church of Scotland, and four years (1862&#150;6) devoted to the study of theology at New College, Edinburgh, enabled him to become a licentiate. After serving as colleague at St John's Free Church, Glasgow (1866&#150;70), he became colleague to Robert Smith Candlish at St George's Free Church, Edinburgh; on Candlish's death in 1873 he became sole minister of the congregation. Alone for the next twenty-two years, and subsequently with the assistance of a colleague, Whyte held this charge until 1916, when he resigned. He married on 9 September 1881 Jane Elizabeth, daughter of George Freeland Barbour, of Bonskeid, Perthshire. His wife was a cultivated person who shared his intellectual interests, such as corresponding with J. H. Newman. They had three sons and three daughters, and a son who died in infancy. In 1898 he was elected moderator of the general assembly, and in 1909 principal of New College, Edinburgh, a position which he held until 1918; he left an interesting record of the content of the classes he taught  (Barbour, 647). The freedom of the city of Edinburgh was presented to him in 1910. The union of 1900, whereby the Free Church and the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland were merged into one communion, was warmly advocated and welcomed by him. The movement, which began some years later, for the union of the Church of Scotland and the United Free Church also won his enthusiastic support. He was a strong Liberal&#151;an admirer of W. E. Gladstone and, later, a friend of Lloyd George.<br>
<br>A traditionalist himself, Whyte championed the cause of liberty in biblical criticism; a Calvinist in theology, he was catholic in his sympathies with exponents of the devotional life. His preaching was famous even in an age of famous preachers. It was distinguished by a rich imagination, with a streak of humour, genial or grim, running through it; by a passion for righteousness which betrayed him at times into exaggerated confessions and attributions of evil motives; and by a mysticism which expressed itself in rapturous and moving eloquence.<br>
<br>For twenty years Whyte's evening sermons were published in the <span class="italic">British Weekly</span>, and he wrote many volumes on biblical subjects, including <span class="italic">A Commentary on the Shorter Catechism</span> (1882) and <span class="italic">Bible Characters</span> (6 vols., 1896&#150;1902). Between 1892 and 1908 he published books on J. H. Newman, James Fraser, Samuel Rutherford, St Teresa of Avila, Lancelot Andrewes, William Law, Father John of the Greek church, Thomas Shepard, and Thomas Goodwin. He also published <span class="italic">Bunyan Characters</span> (4 vols., 1893&#150;1908).<br>
<br>In 1919 the Whytes moved to 22 Church Row, Hampstead, London, to be near their children. Whyte died there on 6 January 1921 and was buried on 11 January in the Dean cemetery, Edinburgh, his wife surviving him.<br>
<br>The Whytes' eldest son was <a name="cosubject_56870"></a><span class="headword">Sir (Alexander) Frederick Whyte</span>  (1883&#150;1970), who, having attended Edinburgh Academy and read modern languages at Jena University and at Edinburgh University (graduating with a first class), was warden of the Edinburgh University settlement in 1907&#150;8. He was Liberal MP for Perth City in 1910&#150;18, being parliamentary private secretary to Winston Churchill in 1910&#150;15. In 1912 he married Margaret Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fairweather; they had one son and two daughters. Whyte edited <span class="italic">The New Europe</span> from May 1917. He was president of the legislative assembly in India, 1920&#150;25, and was knighted in 1922. In 1929&#150;32 he was political adviser to the national government of China. He was involved in the Round Table and became director-general of the English Speaking Union in 1938. In 1939&#150;40 he was head of the American division of the Ministry of Information. Whyte published several books on world politics, including <span class="italic">Asia in the Twentieth Century</span> (1926) and <span class="italic">China and Foreign Powers</span> (1927). He died on 30 July 1970.<br>
