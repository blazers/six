<span class="headword">Dodd,  Charles</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Hugh Tootel]</span>  (1672&#150;1743), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and historian</span>, was born Hugh Tootel at Durton in Broughton, near Preston, Lancashire. He was confirmed in the Roman Catholic church at Euxton Burgh Chapel, the property of the Dalton family, on 13 September 1687, by Bishop John Leyburn, vicar apostolic of the London district. After studying with his uncle, the Revd Christopher Tootel of Ladywell Chapel at Fernyhalgh, Lancashire, he was sent to the English College at Douai, where he arrived on 23 July 1688, and studied philosophy. On 16 July 1690 he was matriculated and took the college oath. While a student in France he adopted the name Charles Dodd to protect his father from a fine levied on Catholic families who sent their sons to continental schools and colleges. On 22 September 1690 he received minor orders at Cambrai from James Theodore de Bayes. Dodd then studied divinity under Dr Hawarden at Douai for three years until 1693, when he was admitted into the English seminary of St Gregory at Paris, where after four additional years of theological study he took the degree of BD. He then returned to Douai, where he stayed until May 1698, when he came upon the English mission, and had the charge of a congregation at Fernyhalgh, Lancashire. Before 1718 Dodd had decided to write a church history of England, presenting a view more favourable to the Catholic case as an antidote to the protestant history of Bishop Burnet. He left for Douai in 1718 to begin his researches, and spent the next four years travelling in Europe visiting various Catholic institutions in search of material. He was assisted by the Revd Edward Dicconson, vice-president of the college of Douai, and Dr Ingleton of the Paris seminary.<br>
<br>On his return to England, John Talbot Stonor, vicar apostolic of the midland district, recommended Dodd in August 1722 to Sir Robert Throckmorton, bt, as a suitable assistant to Mr Bennett, in the charge of the congregation at Harvington, Worcestershire, to which Dodd succeeded on Bennett's death in September 1726. While living at Harvington, Dodd arranged his materials, and finished his great work, <span class="italic">The Church History of England from 1500 to 1688</span> (1737&#150;42). The cost of its publication was in a great measure met by Edward, duke of Norfolk, Sir Robert Throckmorton, Cuthbert Constable, and bishops Stonor and Hornyold. This history bears the imprint of Brussels, but was believed to have been printed in England, as both type and paper are English made. The attribution to Brussels may have been motivated by the prohibition against the printing of Catholic material which operated in Britain at the time. The work was favourable to English Catholics, but hostile to the regular clergy, and it involved Dodd in controversy with both the Jesuits and the Church of England.<br>
<br>Dodd died on 27 February 1743 at Harvington and on 1 March was buried at Chaddesley Corbett, Worcestershire. The Revd James Brown, who attended him in his last illness, made a solemn protestation in writing to the effect that Dodd on his deathbed expressed an earnest desire to die in charity with all mankind, and particularly with the Society of Jesus, of whom he had been critical. Dodd is said to have left some sixty-four written works both published and in manuscript. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries plans for continuation of his history were made by the Revd Thomas Eyre, the Revd John Kirk, and the Revd Mark Tierney, but none of these projects was completed.<br>
