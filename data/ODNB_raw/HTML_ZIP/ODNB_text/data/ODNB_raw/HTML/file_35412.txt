<span class="headword">Paton,  John Lewis Alexander</span>  (1863&#150;1946), <span class="occ">schoolmaster</span>, was born at Brightside, Sheffield, on 13 August 1863, the second son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35410/', "Revd John Brown Paton (1830&#150;1911)")</script>, a Congregational minister who moved to Nottingham in that year, and his wife, Jessie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Paton. After early education in Germany, where he attended the Halle Gymnasium, and at Nottingham high school, Paton went to Shrewsbury School, where he became head of the school. Proceeding in 1882 to St John's College, Cambridge, where he was a scholar, he was placed in the first division of the first class in part one of the classical tripos in 1886 and in the first class of part two with special distinctions in the following year when he was also second chancellor's medallist. Elected a fellow of St John's in the same year, he immediately entered upon his life vocation by joining the staff of the Leys School in Cambridge.<br>
<br>In 1888 Paton became lower bench master at Rugby School, where his most famous pupil was William Temple. His friendly informality won the affection of his pupils at Rugby and especially among the day boys in Town House, whose tutor he became in 1891.<br>
<br>Paton's headmastership of University College School, 1898&#150;1903, where he succeeded H. W. Eve, gave his genius for personal influence over his boys full scope. He never forgot a name or a face. Intolerant of insincerity or slackness, he inspired his boys with his own high standards of achievement and public service. By his ruthless opposition to obscurantism he incurred opposition, but it was usually dispelled by his obvious sincerity and abundant generosity of labour and money. Ultimately frustrated by the slow progress being made to separate the school from the college, and to move the school to a site out of central London, he accepted another appointment.<br>
<br>In 1903 Paton was appointed high master of Manchester grammar school. Every activity in the school felt the impact of his personality. He started holiday camps and visits abroad ranging from Norway to the Alps, and in particular Germany, with which, before 1914, he was keen to encourage friendship, and he helped to found the Old Mancunians Association. He brought distinguished men from home and abroad to lecture at the school and spent his money freely in helping the poorer boys and young masters. Often after morning prayers he would give short talks on domestic and foreign affairs; and his general-knowledge papers, which every boy had to take at the beginning of the school year, became famous. He revitalized the famous school and made it the exemplar of its kind.<br>
<br>Proud of his Scottish covenanting ancestry, Paton was strongly influenced by his nonconformist background, and he brought the puritan tradition with him to his teaching posts. He abstained from alcohol and tobacco, regarded sexual impurity and gambling with horror, and disregarded formal conventions in matters of dress and manners. He favoured an open-air, cold-bath regime (he slept in a tent in his garden during the summer months). Early morning bathing parties and cross-country runs, in which he took part even as headmaster, were a feature of the school camps which he instituted; he was an early supporter of the Boy Scout movement, and a keen cyclist. Unlike many headmasters of his period, he believed in the professional training of secondary teachers. He was president of the Teachers' Guild (1907) and of the Modern Languages Association (1911), and was a member of the consultative committee of the Board of Education (1907&#150;15).<br>
<br>Paton's ideals, like those of his father, were strongly democratic and he encouraged pupils at his schools to perform acts of social service. At Rugby he organized classes for working men and led a troop of the Boys' Brigade; at University College School he helped to run the school mission, the Working Boys' Club at Clerkenwell; and at Manchester he was active in both the Hugh Oldham Lads' Club and the university settlement at Ancoats. As an early advocate of opening public schools to all classes he anticipated the recommendations of the 1944 Fleming report (which were, however, not implemented). His belief in the dignity of manual labour was strongly held: at University College School he joined the boys in painting the railings of the school grounds at Neasden; and at Manchester he took part in the physical work of levelling a patch of ground to form the playing field.<br>
<br>Paton retired from Manchester in 1924 and lectured for the Canadian National Council of Education; in 1925 he became the first president of the Memorial University College in St John's, Newfoundland, where he steadily improved the teaching until he retired to Kemsing, Kent, in 1933. He studied Newfoundland's economic conditions, made friends with its people, and pressed their cause in Newfoundland and England. During the Second World War, Paton worked in a preparatory school in England in which he continued almost to the day of his death.<br>
<br>Potentially one of the finest classical scholars of Europe, Paton gave himself entirely to his teaching, and his publications (apart from his life of his father, published in 1914) consist of no more than a number of papers on educational topics. His real memorials, resulting from his strenuous and selfless labours, were his influence on the development of the grammar school ideal in England, and in the achievements, in many spheres of national life, of those boys who came under his influence. The most unassuming of men, he would not sit for his portrait, and he destroyed his personal papers to ensure that no memoir of him would be written. It was said that he declined offers both of a knighthood and of the Companion of Honour. Paton had piercing blue eyes and was &#145;barely of middle height, sturdy of build, clean-shaven, strong-mouthed, with the fresh-complexioned, weather-beaten appearance of a sailor&#146;  (Barnard, 7). He died, unmarried, at his home, 10 Stanley Avenue, Beckenham, Kent, on 28 April 1946.<br>
