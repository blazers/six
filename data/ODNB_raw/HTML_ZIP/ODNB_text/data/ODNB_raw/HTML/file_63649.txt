<span class="headword">Withers,  Henry</span>  (1650/51?&#150;1729), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, is of unknown parentage. His funeral monument suggests that he came from a military family, although this may refer to his extensive career in the army. Following service in the English regiment in France during the 1670s, Withers received his first commission in the duke of Monmouth's foot regiment in 1678, before serving in the Tangier garrison. By October 1689 he was a captain in a grenadier company and in 1692 he was promoted to major in the Coldstream Guards, the regiment commanded by the politically powerful Henry Sidney, earl of Romney. In 1696 he became lieutenant-colonel of the Coldstream Guards. Ever since 1689 Withers had been a staff officer, serving as adjutant-general in Ireland, and following the renewal of hostilities with France in 1702 he became a brigadier-general. Upon Romney's death in 1704 Withers acquired an even greater patron as the new colonel of the regiment was the duke of Marlborough. Marlborough's original intention was to make Withers the colonel of the Horse Guards &#145;unless there were some man of quality fitt for itt&#146;  (<span class="italic">Marlborough&#150;Godolphin Correspondence</span>, 281), suggesting that Withers came from relatively humble stock.<br>
<br>Having been promoted to major-general in 1704, Withers served at Blenheim. By 1706 Marlborough had secured for Withers, &#145;this very brave and good officer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Marlborough&#150;Godolphin Correspondence</span>, 574), the governorship of Sheerness in Kent, and in 1707 he became a lieutenant-general. His post at Sheerness allowed Withers to secure the adjacent parliamentary seat of Queenborough in the 1708 election. In the House of Commons, Withers voted with the whigs. Withers distinguished himself at the siege of Tournai in July 1709, being wounded in the chest and receiving the plaudits of Richard Steele in <span class="italic">The Tatler</span>. He had recovered to play a leading role in the battle of Malplaquet in September 1709, for which he received a Jacobite medal lauding his bravery under fire. Peter Wentworth described Withers as &#145;the old soldier&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wentworth Papers</span>, 141) when he met him in September 1710 supposedly on a reconnaissance mission for Marlborough following the fall of Godolphin. Certainly Withers was trusted with confidential letters from Marlborough to his duchess. However, Withers maintained good relations with Henry St John, who had served as secretary at war from 1704 to 1708 and who was a leading minister after 1710; in the wake of Marlborough's fall in January 1712 this ensured that Withers continued to be employed, being sent as the commander of the foot in Flanders in the spring of 1712.<br>
<br>If the Jacobites had harboured hopes of Withers they were to be disappointed. Indeed, he was reported to have been deeply involved in whig plans to seize both St John and Robert Harley, earl of Oxford, in order to preserve the Hanoverian succession. He continued as governor of Sheerness until his death. He died on 11 November 1729; according to his funeral monument, he was seventy-eight. He left &pound;2000 in South Sea annuities to his sister, Elizabeth Lutley, and the remainder of his estate to his &#145;loving friend&#146;, Colonel Henry Disney, with whom he had shared a house in Greenwich since at least 1713. Following his burial in Westminster Abbey on 14 November it was Disney who arranged for the erection of the monument to his memory, complete with verses and prose by Alexander Pope which praised his military valour and social accomplishments:<blockquote>
<div>For thee the hardy Vet'ran drops a tear<br>
</div>
<div>And the gay courtier feels a sigh sincere.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>
