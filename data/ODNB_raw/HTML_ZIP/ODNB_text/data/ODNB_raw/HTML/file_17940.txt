<span class="headword">Manley, Sir  Roger</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1687), <span class="occ">army officer and historian</span>, was the second of three sons of Cornelius Manley (<i>d</i>. 1623) of Erbistock in Denbighshire, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Francis Lloyd of Hardwick in Shropshire. All three sons were minors at their father's death. Roger's brothers took divergent paths in the civil war: the elder, Francis, later chief justice of the Carmarthen circuit, served the royalist party in north Wales, and compounded for delinquency in arms in 1647, while the younger, John, a vigorous nonconformist and son-in-law of Isaac Dorislaus, fought for parliament and held the postal franchise under the Commonwealth. Roger served as a royalist officer in Lord Byron's regiment, and was present at the capture of Powis Castle in October 1644, being taken prisoner but making a daring solitary escape. After Byron's defeat and the capture of Chester in 1646 he left England for the continent.<br>
<br>Manley spent the next fourteen years mostly in the Netherlands, serving in the army of the states general at Maastricht in 1653&#150;4, accompanying an embassy to Sweden in 1655, and commanding a company in the Dutch expedition to Danzig in 1656&#150;7. All this time he sent reports, under various pseudonyms, to his brother-in-law, Isaac Dorislaus the younger, and others in England; these survive among the Thurloe state papers. It seems that by 1659 he had also compiled the account of the war of 1657&#150;8 between Sweden and Denmark that was later published as the first part of his <span class="italic">History of the Late Warrs in Denmark</span> (1670), because orders issued in March 1659 cite it as an authority for protocol in dealing with the Swedish fleet. With regard to the published version, the close similarities between his account and the one by Sir Philip Meadows printed in 1675 suggest that they derive from the same original (possibly an earlier version of Meadows's text), and that Manley's book cannot be treated as a primary source. Of clearer antecedents is his <span class="italic">True Description of the Mighty Kingdom of Japan and Siam</span>, translated from the account by Fran&ccedil;ois Caron and dedicated to Manley's brother Francis (1663; reprinted 1671).<br>
<br>At the Restoration Manley held an ensign's commission in the regiment of Robert Sidney, second earl of Leicester, an English unit in Dutch service, and was among the officers who refused to swear allegiance to the states general in 1665, which led to their dismissal and recommissioning in English service as the Holland regiment (later to become the Buffs). He also worked as an agent for Sir George Downing, collecting intelligence on Dutch naval preparations for the war that broke out that year. This led to his brief arrest by the pensionary Johan de Witt. Despite these adventures Manley was dissatisfied with the progress of his career and petitioned Arlington, the secretary of state, for better employment, citing his twenty years' experience, particularly in fortification. This experience had doubtless been gained, in part, during earlier service as ensign to a military engineer cousin, John Manley, whose brother Arthur left two houses at Kew, in Surrey, one of which Roger acquired in 1674.<br>
<br>Promoted captain in September 1665 Manley accompanied his regiment to Portsmouth and thence, in December, to Jersey. He was now married, his wife being Maria Catherina, whose parents were Francophone denizens of the Spanish Netherlands; she died on 1 November 1675 aged thirty-two and was buried in Portsmouth. They had at least six children, of whom five survived their father, two sons dying shortly after him, the three daughters (including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17939/', "Delarivier Manley")</script>) living into the next century. He apparently also played some part in the upbringing of his younger brother's son, John, who later seduced and then abandoned Delarivier.<br>
<br>From 1667 Manley acted as lieutenant-governor of Jersey, being sworn in as such in November that year. Details of his duties and his trips home on leave survive in his letters to his cousin Robert Francis, a clerk in Arlington's office, preserved in the state papers (and wrongly calendared as being from Robert Manley). His knowledge of languages, acquired in exile, was occasionally put to use translating letters for Francis. In 1671 he was allowed an allowance of six soldiers' pay to offset expenses incurred in Jersey, chiefly in repairing the island's fortifications.<br>
<br>In or soon after 1673 Manley left Jersey, still a captain but having transferred in 1672 to the 1st regiment of foot guards (later the Grenadiers), and in 1674 his account of the saga of Boris Godunov and the false Dmitry, <span class="italic">The Russian Impostor</span>, was published. This book drew on material not then available in English and remains very readable. By June 1675 Manley had been appointed deputy governor of Portsmouth, being knighted there by the king on 3 July. From January 1678 he was on the commission for repairing the fortifications of the port, and was commended for his diligence by Sir Bernard de Gomme, engineer-general.<br>
<br>In February 1680 Manley petitioned the crown for the office of receiver-general of the duchy of Cornwall, but was unsuccessful. The same month, however, he was posted to Landguard Fort in Suffolk as governor, his appointment being renewed (like his captaincy in the guards) on the accession of James II in 1685. By now, however, he seems to have been somewhat weary, and in a letter of March 1684 he refers to his &#145;forty-three years' colonelling&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 29/437/30), presumably a conscious echo of <span class="italic">Hudibras</span>. His last book, a military history of the civil war, <span class="italic">De rebellione Anglicana</span> (1686), was well written in reasonably correct Latin, but is no more informative about the theatre in which the author had himself served than about the others described. It was republished after his death in 1691 in English as <span class="italic">The History of the Rebellions of England, Scotland and Ireland</span>, with a continuation covering Monmouth's rebellion.<br>
<br>On 26 February 1687 Manley, by then living in Westminster, wrote his will. He was dead by 19 March following and on 21 March he was buried in St Margaret's Church there. His successor at Landguard Fort had been appointed two days earlier, although it was not until May 1688 that one of his daughters was admitted heir to the house at Kew, and June 1688 that his will was proved. Described by his daughter Delarivier as &#145;brave, full of honour and a very fine gentleman&#146;  (D. Manley, <span class="italic">Adventures</span>, 14), he was obviously a man of some charm and ability, not least in telling a good story. This served him well in his literary efforts, though it sometimes seems out of place in his dispatches, and certainly overran the mark on one occasion in 1669 when, journeying home on leave, he had a fellow traveller arrested as a highwayman's decoy, only to recant afterwards and drop all charges. The affair, probably obscure enough at the time, remains a mystery.<br>
