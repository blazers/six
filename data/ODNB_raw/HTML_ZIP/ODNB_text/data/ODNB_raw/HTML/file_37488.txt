<span class="headword">Gresham,  Edward</span>  (1565&#150;1613), <span class="occ">astrologer</span>, of Stainford, Yorkshire, was born on 14 April 1565, presumably in Stainford. He was probably connected to the London commercial and financial dynasty, perhaps through Sir Richard Gresham, who had acquired extensive monastic properties in Yorkshire at the dissolution. Gresham (or a namesake) matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1584, proceeding MA in 1606. He divided his time between Stainford and London, where he lived next to Dyers' Hall at Thames Street.<br>
<br>Gresham held advanced ideas in astronomy. During the plague of 1603 rumours were fathered on him and John Dee to the effect that its future course depended on the imminent fall of a planet to earth. To dispel such idle notions he compiled a scholarly treatise on the planets, <span class="italic">Astrostereon</span>, in which he championed the Copernican system and denied the existence of solid planetary spheres, arguing that the heavenly bodies moved freely in space. For several years, between 1603 and 1607, he published astrological almanacs. The edition for 1605, no longer extant, was said to have foretold the Gunpowder Plot so accurately that it brought him under suspicion of complicity. Gresham himself, however, placed little reliance on &#145;vulgar astrologie&#146;, and was one of the earliest English champions of a reformed astrological science. A capable mathematician and astronomer, he compiled detailed planetary tables for astrological use. To refute charges of atheism he cited two religious treatises he had written, &#145;Sabbath-dayes exercises&#146; and &#145;Positions in divinitie&#146; (apparently unpublished and now lost). He also practised medicine and magic, and the latter brought him an unsavoury reputation.<br>
<br>In his last years Gresham's fame as a magician drew him into the sordid court intrigues surrounding the divorce of Robert Devereux, third earl of Essex. The countess of Essex had employed the magician Simon Forman to secure the love of Robert Carr (later earl of Somerset), the king's favourite, and to rid her of an unwanted husband. On Forman's death in 1611 she approached Gresham through her confidante Anne Turner, and he employed his skill in efforts to render the earl impotent and to win the queen's goodwill. Essex's alleged impotence was the central issue facing the royal commission set up in 1613, which duly ruled the marriage unconsummated and granted a divorce, freeing the countess to marry Carr. It seems that Gresham also employed his magical arts against Sir Thomas Overbury, an open critic of the proposed marriage, whom the countess was determined to remove. Richard Weston, an associate of Gresham's, was certainly involved in the plot against Overbury and was later hanged for his part in the murder.<br>
<br>Gresham himself did not live to see the outcome of any of these nefarious schemes. He died in London on 13 January 1613 and was buried the next day at All Saints-the-Less. Shortly before his death he had conveyed his magical paraphernalia (lead and wax images, crosses, and charms) to Richard Weston, directing them to be buried secretly. He left only a daughter, Jane, a lunatic. A near-contemporary judged that &#145;without all question he was a very skilfull man in the Mathematicks, and in his latter time in Witchcraft&#146;. He was fortunate in dying before the Overbury scandal became public; a maidservant, less lucky, is said to have been hanged subsequently as a witch.<br>
