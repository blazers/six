<span class="headword">Perne,  Andrew</span>  (<em>c.</em>1595&#150;1654), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the son of Thomas Perne. He was educated at Peterhouse, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1618 and proceeding MA in 1621, and was ordained a priest on 4 June 1622. From 1622 to 1627 he was fellow of St Catharine's College, where Richard Sibbes was the master; it was there he placed his conversion to the cause of true religion. In 1627 he was appointed to the rectory of Wilby in Northamptonshire by the patron, Thomas Pentlow. There is scant information concerning his family. With his wife, Mary, he had at least two daughters.<br>
<br>Perne became one of the leading clerical members of an influential puritan community centred on Northampton. As an evangelical Calvinist he made the main thrust of his ministry to awaken the elect saints to self-awareness by preaching the word:<blockquote>love to Christ, an earnest desire to encrease his Kingdom, pitty and compassion towards poor soules, a violent thirst after their salvation, and a burning zeale for the honour and glory of God were the motives that put him upon this worke. (Ainsworth, 39)</blockquote>The opposite of this vision of true religion was popery, and in the decade before the civil war he was a prominent leader of Northamptonshire opposition to government policy, which he regarded as &#145;Popish&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/251/25). He was reported to have &#145;complained much of the overfloweings of Popery every where in this land, &amp; wished or hoped, that God would raise up a standard to hinder it&#146;  (ibid.). His preference for preaching twice every Sunday led in 1633 to an interrogation by Bishop Augustine Lindsell of Peterborough&#151;who denounced him as a &#145;hollow pillar of Puritanisme&#146;  (ibid.) for refusing to conduct a catechism class in the afternoon (as required by the <span class="italic">Instructions to Preachers</span> issued that year) at the expense of his second sermon. He was also accused of ceremonial nonconformity. About 1635 he was reported to the ecclesiastical courts for not publicly reading the <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span>, which puritans regarded as anti-sabbatarian, and in August 1640 for attending a meeting at The Swan inn in Kettering to co-ordinate opposition to the bishops' war and the revised <span class="italic">Book of Canons</span>.<br>
<br>Perne was chosen in 1643 one of the representatives from Northamptonshire to the Westminster assembly. He preached four sermons before the Long Parliament&#151;including one on the occasion of a public fast, 31 May 1643, which was published as <span class="italic">Gospell Courage, or, Christian Resolution for God and his Truth</span>, and another on 23 April 1644 at the &#145;thanksgiving&#146; for Sir Thomas Fairfax's victory at Selby. In <span class="italic">Gospell Courage</span> Perne recognized that the civil war had both secular and religious causes but that the latter were more important. The Caroline regime had repressed the godly and true religion by discouraging preaching, stifling discussion of predestination, and permitting anti-sabbatarianism. The kingdom had degenerated into idolatry: &#145;the Popish language of Priests and Altars, and the superstitious bowing and gestures were brought in under a pretence of Authority&#146;  (Perne, 25). In these circumstances it was the duty of the people to be &#145;peremptory&#146;  (ibid., 15) in defence of their beliefs. When the sermon was delivered a vote of thanks was proposed by the puritan MP Sir Christopher Yelverton.<br>
<br>On 11 July 1643 Perne was admitted as vicar of St Dunstan-in-the-West, London, the previous incumbent James Marsh having been sequestered; six months later, on 14 January, Perne was readmitted on Marsh's death. In 1645 he was recommended by Robert Baillie as one of a number of eminent ministers who might give &#145;good satisfaction&#146; as personal chaplains to Charles I  (Paul, 120). Although Perne was officially established in 1646 as presbyterian minister at St Dunstan's, his relations with this most consistently radical of city parishes did not run smoothly, and in 1647 he resigned after controversy surrounding disputed churchwarden elections.<br>
<br>Perne died at Wilby on 13 December 1654 and was buried in the chancel of the church there. His funeral sermon, published in 1655, was delivered by his friend and former curate, Samuel Ainsworth, who claimed to have been converted by him. Perne was survived by his wife, Mary, who probably died in 1663.<br>
