<span class="headword">Holt, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1418/19), <span class="occ">justice</span>, is of obscure origins. He trained as a lawyer, and from 1 October 1375 was paid as a king's serjeant, even though he did not formally become a serjeant-at-law until Hilary term 1376. His pleadings are often recorded in the year-books. He formed other important connections at court. By the mid-1370s he was involved in the property affairs of William, Lord Latimer, the king's chamberlain, and he also entered the service of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, who in 1377 appointed him steward of his lordship of Higham Ferrers, Northamptonshire, an office he held at least until October 1382. By 20 February 1376 he had married a woman named Alice, probably the heir of the Islip family; on 28 March property in Islip, Aldwincle, Grafton by Cranford, and Woodford, all in Northamptonshire, was quitclaimed to them, and the manor of Sacombe in Hertfordshire, which Holt had purchased, was conveyed to the couple jointly. Other acquisitions made by Holt were the manor and advowson of Brampton, Huntingdonshire, property in Lincoln, and an inn in Southwark, the Angel in the Hope. On 21 May 1382 he was granted the wardship of John Stonor, a minor who was heir to estates in Oxfordshire, but soon relinquished it to the chief justice of the common pleas, Sir Robert Bealknap.<br>
<br>On 4 November 1383 Holt was appointed to the common bench, and by 3 May following he had been knighted. He was a trier of petitions in the parliaments of 1384, 1385, and 1386. In August 1387 he was one of the justices who responded to Richard II's questions about the legitimacy of proceedings in the previous year's parliament, which had placed royal authority under conciliar control, by declaring that they were derogatory to the king's prerogative, and that those responsible for them were traitors. When the earls of Derby and Nottingham rose in arms against Richard II's favourites in December 1387, they detained Holt while he was holding sessions at Newmarket Heath. In January 1388 he was among the justices deprived of office at the instigation of the two earls and their fellow lords appellant, and on 2 March he was one of six of them who were brought before parliament, to be impeached by the Commons for the opinions to which they had subscribed in 1387. Holt claimed that he had complied as a result of dire threats from Archbishop Alexander Neville, Robert de Vere, duke of Ireland, and Michael de la Pole, earl of Suffolk, and that because of his hesitancy he was physically assaulted. The Lords were divided on sentencing the former justices, but on 6 March they were condemned to hanging and forfeiture, then granted their lives at the supplication of the bishops. At the end of parliament their banishment to Ireland was agreed upon. Holt (like Bealknap) was to stay in Drogheda or its vicinity: in July arrangements were made for his transportation from Chester with two of his servants, the first instalment of his annuity (to be raised from what had been his own lands) of &pound;26 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., sufficient raiment, and a bed. On 7 July 1390, with the great council's assent, his forfeited properties were sold for &pound;500 to his eldest son, John. The latter and his brothers Hugh and Richard (a cleric) experienced difficulties in making the annual payments: in 1395 the debt was rescheduled.<br>
<br>Then in the first parliament of 1397 the former justices' banishments were rescinded, and in January 1398 parliament reversed their sentences. Holt was back in England that year. In Henry IV's first parliament, in 1399, the sentences were reinstated. The new king disregarded the Commons' pity for the surviving offenders' old age and poor health. However, on 20 February 1400 Holt was licensed to live in England, and his petitions to parliament in 1401 and 1402 (made jointly with his former colleague and fellow exile William Burgh) resulted in his receiving royal permission to sue for his former estates. Sir John Holt died in either 1418 or 1419. His eldest son, John, had predeceased him, as had his wife, and his second son, Hugh, succeeded to the recovered estates.<br>
