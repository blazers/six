<span class="headword">Reid,  Patrick Robert <span class="st"> [Pat]</span></span>  (1910&#150;1990), <span class="occ">escape officer and author</span>, was born on 13 November 1910 in India, the son of John Reid, of the Indian Civil Service, and his wife, Alice Mabel Daniell. He was educated at Clongowes Wood College, co. Kildare, and at Wimbledon College, and went on to King's College, London, where he was awarded a BSc in 1932. He qualified as a civil engineer in 1936, while serving his pupillage with Sir Alexander Gibbs &amp; Partners, a leading firm of consulting engineers, from 1934 to 1937. With the outbreak of war in 1939 he was commissioned into the Royal Army Service Corps and was posted to France as an ammunition officer with the British expeditionary force, but he was taken prisoner on 27 May 1940 and sent to the prison camp at Laufen, near Salzburg, in Austria. In that year he was awarded the MBE.<br>
<br>Dressed as a German peasant woman, Reid escaped from Laufen through a tunnel in September 1940, but was recaptured within a week, and on 7 November he was transferred to Colditz Castle, Oflag IVC, in Saxony. Built on top of a cliff overlooking the River Mulde, it was supposedly impregnable and it was the prison to which allied officers were sent if they had already tried to escape from other German prisons. Because every officer regarded it as his duty to escape, each nationality had its own committee, headed by an escape officer, and though they worked in secret the committees to some extent kept each other informed of their plans and benefited from each others' experiences. Reid was made British escape officer in January 1941. The first escape that he masterminded, in June 1941, involved tunnelling from underneath the floorboards of the canteen to a point beyond the outer wall, but it failed when the twelve officers emerging from the tunnel were betrayed by the German sentry who had been bribed to look the other way. He was responsible, however, for the success of the next attempt, by Lieutenant Airey Neave and a companion in January 1942. On 14 October, having resigned as escape officer in order to organize his own escape, he and three others succeeded in escaping from Colditz, having loosened the bars of a window with a saw smuggled in in a food parcel and with the help of a detailed plan of the castle discovered in the British Museum. They made their escape during &#145;music practice&#146;, conducted by Douglas Bader, who was able to signal the movements of sentries by stopping and starting the music. All four reached Switzerland safely. Reid was awarded the MC in 1943 and reached the rank of major.<br>
<br>Reid spent the rest of the war in Switzerland, as assistant military attach&eacute; at the British legation in Bern, working under the British air attach&eacute;, Air Commodore &#145;Freddie&#146; West, who was providing an intelligence service behind enemy lines and supervising escape routes from occupied territories. He later helped West to write his autobiography, <span class="italic">Winged Diplomat</span> (1962). After D-day, Reid was part of the team, in close contact with members of the French resistance, sending and receiving information across the border, and during the winter he was one of those involved in the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners organized by the International Red Cross. In August 1943, while in Switzerland, he married Jane Cabot, one of the Boston Cabots; they had three sons and two daughters, but were divorced in 1966.<br>
<br>After the war Reid remained in the diplomatic service, and was posted to Ankara in 1946, as first secretary for commercial affairs. In 1949 he joined the diplomatic staff of the Organization for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC), in Paris, where he spent three years as chief administrator of the Marshall aid plan. He became famous after the publication of <span class="italic">The Colditz Story</span> in 1952&#151;his account of life in Colditz and details of the escapes were regarded by some as the best escape story to come out of the Second World War&#151;and its sequel, <span class="italic">The Latter Days at Colditz</span> (1953). These were followed by a film, <span class="italic">The Colditz Story</span> (1955), starring John Mills as Pat Reid; the television series, <span class="italic">Colditz</span> (1972&#150;4), one of the most popular series ever shown on television; and a successful board game, &#145;Escape from Colditz&#146;. Reid returned to his Colditz experiences in <span class="italic">Colditz: the Full Story</span> (1984); by this time over sixty books had been written about Colditz, in several languages, including German, Dutch, and Polish. He also wrote <span class="italic">Prisoner of War</span> (1953), the story of prisoners-of-war throughout history, and <span class="italic">My Favourite Escape Stories</span> (1975). When criticized for cashing in on his wartime experiences and overshadowing the achievements and sufferings of other escapers he pointed out that he had waited ten years before writing about them, and that any of his fellow prisoners could have done likewise. He was also accused of glamourizing the life of a prisoner-of-war, as in his description of brewing beer from dried fruit received in Red Cross parcels and distilling it by using a large jam tin and lead piping from one of the lavatories.<br>
<br>Prospective Conservative candidate for Dartford and Erith from 1953 to 1955, Reid failed to get elected in the general election of 1955. He returned to engineering and was a director of Richard Costain Ltd from 1959 to 1962 and of W. S. Atkins &amp; Partners, a firm of consulting engineers, from 1962 to 1963; he then established his own business, Kem Estates Ltd, which built houses mainly in Sussex. In 1977 he married Mrs Mary Stewart Cunliffe-Lister, who died in the following year, and in 1982 he married, as his third wife, Mrs Nicandra Hood. He died in Frenchay Hospital, Bristol, on 22 May 1990.<br>
