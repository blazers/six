<span class="headword">Stuart <span class="st"> [Stewart]</span>,  Andrew <span class="st"> [Anders]</span></span>  (<em>c.</em>1570&#150;1640), <span class="occ">army officer and diplomat in the Swedish service</span>, was born in Scotland, the son of John Stewart of Ochiltree, a soldier who served in the escort of Mary, queen of Scots, and Agneta Forbes. Andrew's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63441/', "John (Hans) Stuart")</script> had also migrated to Sweden and gained distinction as a gentleman of the bedchamber at the court of Karl IX in 1604 and inspector-general of all foreign troops in Swedish service by 1609. Their genealogy is interesting in that no John Stewart of Ochiltree can be traced in the Scottish peerage. However, Andrew's godfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26460/', "Andrew Stewart, second Lord Ochiltree")</script>, who signed a letter proving Hans Stuart's nobility in 1585. This was accompanied by an open letter from James VI of Scotland that referred to Hans as &#145;our dear relative&#146;. These documents allowed Hans Stuart to use the same coat of arms as James Stuart, earl of Arran, the second son of Lord Ochiltree, suggesting a relationship which remains elusive.<br>
<br>Andrew Stuart emigrated to Sweden and became a gentleman of the bedchamber at the court of Duke Karl of S&ouml;dermanland (later King Karl IX) by 1592. He was known in Sweden as Anders the elder to distinguish him from his nephew, who also served in the Swedish army. In reward for his military services Andrew the elder received land in 1599 from Karl IX in Ledingelunda (or Lagerlund), part of the parish of K&auml;rna in Sweden. During this period he also married Elisabet Anrep, daughter of Adolf Anrep and Gertrud von Nieroth, although the exact date remains unclear.<br>
<br>At the beginning of 1600 Stuart became a commander of the Swedish forces at Fellin in Livland and by 1602 he was serving as governor of Dorpat. His administrative duties continued when in 1604 he assumed responsibility for the Norra M&ouml;re region of Kalmar. He later received further lands in Stars&auml;ter (renamed Stuarts&auml;ter) in Vists parish and Lida in Kvillinge parish.<br>
<br>Stuart continued to serve in the army and became colonel in chief for the &Ouml;stg&ouml;ta infantry in 1605. However, he continued to pursue work outside his military life. During the Kalmar War between Sweden and Denmark&#150;Norway (1611&#150;13), Stewart joined the Swedish diplomatic service and acted as their envoy to Russia in 1611. During this period Stuart also maintained contact with the court of James VI and I. Perhaps more surprising is that Stuart also had indirect communication with Christian IV of Denmark&#150;Norway through a Scottish nobleman in Danish service, Andrew Sinclair, governor of the newly conquered Swedish fortress of Kalmar.<br>
<br>Stuart's functions in later life included service in the Swedish fleet. He is recorded as having become a vice-admiral in the fleet of the riksamiral (state admiral) in 1621. He also continued to hold posts on land, acting as master of the court to Pfalzgreve Johan Casimir in 1633. Anders Stuart died on 27 December 1640, apparently from natural causes, and was buried in Vists parish church in Sweden. Together Anders and his wife, Elisabet, had three sons and two daughters: Carl (<i>c</i>.1600&#150;1637), Johan Adolf (1603&#150;1666), Anders (<i>d</i>. 1637), Christina (1600&#150;1648), and Catharina (1622&#150;1699). The sons all engaged in Swedish military service and both daughters also married soldiers.<br>
