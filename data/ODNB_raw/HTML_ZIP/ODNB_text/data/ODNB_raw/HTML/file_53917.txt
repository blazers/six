<span class="headword">Holme,  Wilfrid</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1538), <span class="occ">author</span>, was the son of Thomas Holme (<i>d</i>. 1520), gentleman, of Huntington near York, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Sir Thomas Bolton of Huby. The Holme family had acquired the manor of Huntington in the later fifteenth century and had close connections with the ruling &eacute;lite in the city of York, where the family held lands and where another branch was active in civic life. The estate at Huntington was settled on Wilfrid in 1511 on the occasion of his marriage to Elizabeth, daughter of Philip Constable of Skirton, a member of a junior branch of the Flamborough Constables.<br>
<br>Few details are known of Holme's life beyond his authorship in 1537 of a lengthy poem of 269 stanzas entitled <span class="italic">The Fall and Evill Success of Rebellion</span>, which recalled the events and issues surrounding the recent rising in the north known as the Pilgrimage of Grace. The poem takes the form of a medieval dream allegory, a form much favoured by more famous contemporary court poets such as John Skelton, and reveals Holme as a man familiar with classical and English history, though there is no evidence to suggest where he acquired this learning. Holme's poem takes a strongly reformist line, claiming that while some gentry were compelled to join the rising by the Commons, more were &#145;seduced with the Papistes devise&#146;  (Dickens, 118), and goes on to attack the state of the monasteries and to oppose saints' days, miracles, and the doctrine of purgatory. Holme strongly defends the royal supremacy, likening Henry VIII to the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> kings of Israel, and praises the monarch for abolishing mortuary fees and other clerical privileges.<br>
<br>Holme's poem provides a provincial reflection of the concerns expressed to parliament in 1529 in Simon Fish's influential pamphlet <span class="italic">The Supplicacyon for the Beggars</span>. Holme's protestant views led him to support clerical marriage, while he denounces as a dog who has returned to his vomit Sir Francis Bigod, formerly a fellow reformer who had become involved with the rebels and who was executed on 2 June 1537. The poem finishes with a reference to the Mouldwarp prophecy of Merlin, recorded in Geoffrey of Monmouth's <span class="italic">History</span> and, with other such prophecies, current among the rebels, and with a resounding acclamation of King Henry. The text of the poem, with its mixture of archaic forms and sources and its knowledge of humanist and protestant ideas, stands as a corrective to an oversimplified view of the north as a bastion of conservatism at this time, and demonstrates how cultural and religious debates in the capital and at court could reach the modest provincial gentry. Holme died before the end of July 1538, leaving lands at Haxby and Huntington which were held in trust by his kinsmen Sir Marmaduke Constable and Seth Snawsell for his eight-year-old son, Seth. His poem remained unpublished until it was printed in 1572 and again in 1573, when it formed part of the government's propaganda campaign in the wake of another recent rising in the north, which had the express ambition of deposing Elizabeth I and restoring Catholicism.<br>
