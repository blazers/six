<span class="headword">Montgomerie,  Robert Archibald James</span>  (1855&#150;1908), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born at Rothesay, Isle of Bute, on 11 September 1855, was the son of James Montgomerie MD, of Edinburgh, and his wife, Mary Campbell of Lochnell. He entered the navy on board the <i>Britannia</i> in August 1869 and became sub-lieutenant in September 1875; while serving on the <i>Immortalit&eacute;</i> in the detached squadron, on 6 April 1877 he jumped overboard to save life. It was a dark night, the sea was rough, the ship was before the wind, and the latitude was infested with sharks. Montgomerie therefore, in addition to the Albert medal and the silver medal of the Royal Humane Society, was awarded the Stanhope gold medal for the act of greatest gallantry during the year, and shortly afterwards was appointed to the royal yacht. From her he was promoted lieutenant on 13 September 1878. He was serving in the <i>Carysfort</i>, under Captain H. F. Stephenson, during the Egyptian campaign of 1882, and, landed with the naval brigade, was present at the battle of Tell al-Kebir on 13 September.<br>
<br>In January 1885 the naval brigade under Lord Charles Beresford was organized to help attempt the relief of Gordon at Khartoum, and Montgomerie, then a lieutenant of the <i>Inflexible</i>, joined it at Gubat and served in the gunboat <i>Safieh</i> in some of the operations above Metemmah. From March to July 1885 he was naval transport officer at Dongola, and was specially mentioned in Lord Wolseley's dispatches; from August 1885 to June 1886 he served on the staff of General Sir Frederick Stephenson, and was placed in command of all the armed steamers on the Nile and appointed to superintend the river transport. He was then assigned to the royal yacht, an appointment almost invariably awarded for services which otherwise would go unrequited. From the yacht he was promoted commander on 24 August 1887, and served on the East India station in the <i>Boadicea</i>, the flagship of Sir E. R. Fremantle. In October 1890 he took part in the Witu expedition, commanding the field battery, which was actively engaged. He was again mentioned in dispatches, and in May 1892 was made a CB.<br>
<br>In September 1891 Montgomerie was appointed to command the training ship <i>Lion</i>, and on 1 January 1894 was promoted captain. After commanding the cruiser <i>Bonaventure</i> on the China station and the battleship <i>Prince George</i> in the channel, he was appointed to the <i>Charybdis</i> in November 1901 for the North American station, and was commodore in Newfoundland waters during the fishery season. He served as commodore under Sir Archibald Douglas during the Venezuelan operations of December 1902, and blockaded the coast and bombarded Puerto Cabello. In April 1904 he was appointed a naval aide-de-camp to Edward VII, and in May became inspecting captain of boys' training ships. In 1904 he was created CMG, and on 5 July 1905 he was promoted rear-admiral. He hoisted his flag on 1 January 1907 in command of the destroyers and submarines in commission with nucleus crews, an appointment he held for a year. In August 1907 he was created CVO.<br>
<br>Montgomerie married in 1886 Alethe Marian, the eldest daughter of Spencer Charrington, of Hunsdon House, Hertfordshire; they had one son. Montgomerie was a distinguished athlete, and at one time was heavy-weight boxing champion of the navy. A keen sportsman, he hunted big game in many parts of the world. He died at his home, 22 Embankment Gardens, Chelsea, in London, on 1 September 1908, survived by his wife, and was buried at Hunsdon, Hertfordshire.<br>
