<span class="headword">Puleston,  John</span>  (1583?&#150;1659), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born at Kingsworthy, Hampshire, eldest son of Richard Puleston (<i>b</i>. 1548), a clergyman from Emral in Flintshire who was later rector of Kingsworthy, and his wife, Alice, daughter of David Lewis of Burcot, Oxfordshire; his younger brother was Richard Puleston (<i>b</i>. 1591), later also rector of Kingsworthy and father of the political writer Hamlet Puleston (1632&#150;1662). On 22 May 1601 he matriculated from Oriel College, Oxford, from where he went to Clifford's Inn before being admitted to the Middle Temple on 24 May 1606. He was called to the bar on 8 July 1614 and confirmed on 3 February 1616. A &#145;devout Puritan&#146;  (Prest, 386), in 1619 he was fined for serving flesh on St Matthew's day in the Middle Temple hall. At an unknown date he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1658), daughter of Sir John Woolrych of Dudmaston, Shropshire, &#145;an earnest Presbyterian&#146;  (<span class="italic">DWB</span>); they had two sons, Roger and John.<br>
<br>In 1634 Puleston became a reader and bencher of his inn. The same year, his religious stance notwithstanding, he accompanied Richard Cartwright on a visit to advise Archbishop Laud on ecclesiastical law. Also about this time he inherited from his childless uncle, George Puleston, the family estate at Emral. In 1641 Puleston petitioned parliament against the chief justice of Chester, accusing him of &#145;taking of the presents money&#146;. About September 1642 his wife and children were evicted from Emral by royalist troops under the command of Sir John Hammer. The Commons recommended him in February 1643 for the post of baron of the exchequer, but the king declined to appoint him. Puleston became treasurer of his inn in 1646 and was created serjeant-at-law by parliament on 12 October 1648. After seven of the existing fifteen common law judges had declined to continue under the Commonwealth, in 1649 parliament made Puleston a judge of common pleas, in which capacity he rode the home, midland, Oxford, and northern circuits. He served on the commissions that tried and convicted the governor of Pontefract Castle, Colonel John Morris, at York in August 1649 and that acquitted the Leveller leader John Lilburne at the Guildhall later that year. He was named under a proposed act for the establishment of a new high court of justice in April 1650 and to a commission for trying offenders at Norfolk in December 1650. He also served on the north Wales composition committee (1649), on the commission for the propagation of the gospel in Wales (1650), and, between 1647 and 1657, on numerous parliamentary commissions for Denbighshire and Flintshire.<br>
<br>Oliver Cromwell did not reappoint Puleston to the bench in 1653. At about this time his family re-occupied the Emral estate and, on 30 September 1653, Philip Henry, later an eminent nonconformist minister, was appointed tutor to Puleston's two sons there, accompanying them to Oxford the following year. His wife died in 1658, and Puleston died at Emral on 5 September 1659, and was buried there three days later.<br>
