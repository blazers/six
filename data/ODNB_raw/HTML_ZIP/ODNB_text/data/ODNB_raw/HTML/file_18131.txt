<span class="headword">Marshall,  Charles</span>  (1806&#150;1890), <span class="occ">scene-painter</span>, was born on 31 December 1806 at 1 Cumberland Street, St Pancras, London, and baptized in St Pancras on 24 May 1807, the son of Nathan Marshall, butcher (<i>d</i>. 1848), and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Randall (<i>d</i>. 1852). He studied oil painting under John Wilson, and at the age of twenty-two received a gold medal from the Society of Arts. He became a pupil of Gaetano Marinari, scene-painter at Drury Lane Theatre, and subsequently became one of the most prominent and successful scene-painters of the day. Marshall was employed by a number of London theatre managers, including Robert William Elliston at Drury Lane and David Osbaldiston at the Surrey Theatre. Under William Macready at Covent Garden and Drury Lane he designed scenery for many plays including <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>, <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span>, <span class="italic">Virginius</span>, and the first productions of Lord Lytton's plays. On the death of William Grieve in 1844, Marshall became scene-painter to the opera at Her Majesty's Theatre, London, and contributed much to Benjamin Lumley's revival of the ballet. That year he married on 15 February Anna Maria (<i>d</i>. 1883), daughter of James Kittermaster MD, of Meriden, Warwickshire.<br>
<br>Marshall is credited with introducing limelight on the stage. He originated and developed transformation scenes. In general his scenery depended more on illusion than on solid pictorial effects as practised by Clarkson Stanfield and others. In common with the other leading theatre scene-painters of the day, including Stanfield, David Roberts, Thomas Grieve, William Grieve, and William Telbin, he energetically involved himself in the production and exhibition of panoramas. At the Surrey Theatre in 1829, for instance, he exhibited a <span class="italic">Grand Moving Panorama</span> with a view of Constantinople as part of the performance, and at the Victoria Theatre in 1834 a moving panorama of the burning of the houses of parliament, completed and displayed within a week of the event. His <span class="italic">Kineorama</span>, a moving panorama of a trip from Constantinople to Cairo, which opened in London at 121 Pall Mall in March 1841, maximized the use of dioramic effects. The premises caught fire on 20 July during a performance. His most ambitious panoramas were those performed in exhibition halls rather than in theatres. His <span class="italic">Tour through Europe</span> was performed at the Linwood Gallery in Leicester Square in 1851; and his <span class="italic">Life and Exploits of Napoleon Bonaparte</span> at the Regent Gallery, 69 Quadrant, in 1853. Both panoramas toured the provinces. Scene-painters misleadingly called their moving panoramas dioramas. Marshall provided James Wyld at the Great Globe in Leicester Square with a <span class="italic">Grand Moving Diorama of a Tour from Blackwall to Balaclava</span> in 1856, and a <span class="italic">Diorama of Russia</span> in 1856&#150;7. In 1842 he designed <span class="italic">A General Representation of the City of Hamburg</span>, the scenic element in a pyrotechnic display at Vauxhall Gardens; and in 1844 he painted the scenery at the Glaciarium, a skating rink at 8 Grafton Street East, Tottenham Court Road.<br>
<br>Marshall retired in 1858. Since 1828 he had regularly exhibited landscape paintings at the Royal Academy, the British Institution, and the Society (later Royal Society) of British Artists, and landscape painting now became his principal preoccupation. He died at his home, 7 Lewisham Road, Highgate Road, London, on 8 March 1890, and was buried at Highgate cemetery. He left three children; of these two sons, Charles James Kittermaster Marshall and Roberto Angelo Kittermaster Marshall, also became artists.<br>
