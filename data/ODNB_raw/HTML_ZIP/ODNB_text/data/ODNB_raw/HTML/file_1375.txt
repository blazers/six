<span class="headword">Barham,  Nicholas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1520&#150;1577), <span class="occ">serjeant-at-law</span>, was born at Wadhurst, Sussex, the first son of Richard Barham of Wadhurst, and his wife, Alice Cradock. His was a branch of the Barham family of Teston House, Kent, which traced its descent from Robert of Barham who entered upon the estates of his kinsman Reginald Fitzurse, one of the murderers of Thomas Becket, upon the latter's flight into Ireland. Barham's legal training began at Barnard's Inn, which subsequently sued him for dues in 1546. He was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1540, where he is said to have been called to the bar in 1542. He became an ancient of the inn on 24 May 1552, and was Lent reader in 1558.<br>
<br>By 1561 Barham was counsellor to the town of Maidstone, Kent, and occupied the then conjoined offices of recorder and town clerk in succession to Henry Fisher, with whom he was returned to parliament for the borough in 1563. In 1562 Barham purchased the manor of Chillington, and Chillington Manor House in Maidstone, together with the chapel of St Faith, Maidstone, from the sons of Peter Maplesden, whose kinsman George had forfeited the manor and chapel for his part in Wyatt's rebellion. Barham's main residence, which he much improved, was the house called Digons in Knightrider Street, Maidstone, another property forfeited by George Maplesden. After Barham's death these properties were asserted to be concealed lands, upon which subject Peter Osborne wrote to Lord Burghley in July 1578 on behalf of Barham's widow, Mary (<i>d</i>. in or after 1585), daughter of John Holt of Cheshire, with whom he had two children, Margaret and Arthur; but the lands were still in the family's hands twenty years later when Arthur Barham sold them to Henry Hall. Barham built five pews for himself and his family in the south aisle of All Saints' Church, Maidstone, covenanting in return in 1570 to bear the cost of maintenance of a window in the aisle.<br>
<br>Barham was created serjeant-at-law in April 1567, joining Serjeants' Inn, Fleet Street, and was appointed queen's serjeant on 31 May of the same year. He was Sir James Dyer's principal companion as a justice of assize on the midland circuit from 1568 until his death, participating in the decision of <i>R. v. Saunders and Archer</i> (1573), a leading case on transferred malice in murder. At the bar, in addition to his common-law practice, Barham appeared frequently in the court of chancery. He argued the case of <i>Mines</i> ([1567] 1 Plowd. 313) for the crown, and was closely involved in the investigation of the Ridolfi plot and in the successful prosecutions arising from it: in January 1572 with the attorney-general and solicitor-general he conducted the prosecution before the lord high steward and his peers of Thomas Howard, duke of Norfolk, for treason, and in the following month with the attorney-general prosecuted Norfolk's servant Robert Higford in the court of queen's bench.<br>
<br>In 1573 Barham was appointed with two others to investigate and report upon a dispute between Richard Curtis, bishop of Chichester, and certain of the Sussex gentry. He was of counsel with Christopher Herenden in his attempt in the mid-1560s to upset a chancery decree against Herenden's late brother Walter in favour of Katharine, dowager duchess of Suffolk, and her husband, Richard Bertie, who had conveyed land to Walter Herenden in trust upon their flight into Poland in the face of the Marian persecution. But Barham appears to have had puritan sympathies, for he signed a petition about 1573 for John Strowde, a Kent minister who had been forbidden to preach by the archbishop. He died at Oxford on 25 July 1577 of gaol fever contracted at the trial of the recusant bookseller Roland Jenkes during the so-called &#145;black assizes&#146;, which fever killed also Sir Robert Bell, chief baron of the exchequer, and a large number of others.<br>
