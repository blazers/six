<span class="headword">Slingsby,  William Cecil</span>  (1849&#150;1929), <span class="occ">mountaineer</span>, was born on 25 May 1849 in Bell Busk, near Gargrave, Yorkshire, the eldest in the family of three sons and two daughters of William Slingsby, mill owner of Carleton in Craven, and his wife, Mary Ann, daughter of Isaac Dewhurst of Skipton. He was educated at Cheltenham College. On leaving school in 1866 he entered his father's cotton mill at Carleton in Craven, where he later became a partner; he retired in 1906. He married on 21 June 1882 Alizon (<i>b</i>. 1859), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38685/', "William Farrer Ecroyd")</script>, a worsted manufacturer and Conservative MP for Preston, 1881&#150;5. They had two sons and three daughters, of whom the youngest daughter, Eleanor, married the mountaineer Geoffrey Winthrop Young.<br>
<br>Slingsby first visited Norway in 1872 and soon discovered that he was in a country whose temperament and customs were akin to his own. In their turn the Norwegians accepted him as one of themselves. Crossing the Jotunheim in 1872 he had seen St&ouml;re Skagast&ouml;lstind, the Matterhorn of the northern Alps, and resolved to make its first ascent. On 21 July 1876, accompanied by his friends Emmanuel Mohn and Knut Lykken, he attacked the mountain up the steep glacier later known as the Slingsbybrae, reaching the col under the final rock pillar; there the Norwegians refused to go on, considering the peak inaccessible. Slingsby climbed on and reached the summit alone. He made over fifty first ascents of peaks between the Jotunheim and the North Cape. In the early twentieth century he was sometimes known as the &#145;father of Norwegian mountaineering&#146;. He promoted skiing as a sport and was among the first to introduce Norwegian skis to the Alps.<br>
<br>Slingsby's book <span class="italic">Norway, the Northern Playground</span> (1903) gives an account of his adventures and explorations, and also information about the folklore and way of life of the Norwegians. The composer Edvard Grieg was numbered among his many friends. In 1878 he first visited the Alps, where he took part in several first ascents, chiefly with A. F. Mummery. In 1885 he started climbing in the Lake District, where his name is perpetuated in Slingsby's pinnacle and Slingsby's chimney on Scafell. Slingsby died at his home, St Georges, Hurstpierpoint, Sussex, on 23 August 1929 and was buried at St Mary's Church, Carleton in Craven. His wife survived him.<br>
