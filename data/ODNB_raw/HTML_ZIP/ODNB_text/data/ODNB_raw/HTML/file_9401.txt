<span class="headword">Fielding,  Henry Borron</span>  (1805&#150;1851), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born on 17 January 1805 at Garstang, Lancashire, the fifth child and only son of Henry Fielding (1755/6&#150;1816) of Myerscough House, near Garstang, and his wife, Susanna. His father was head of Henry Fielding, Brothers, &amp; Co., calico printers, of Catterall, near Garstang, and a deputy lieutenant for Lancashire. Fielding's sensitive health made it difficult for him to pursue a career and a substantial inheritance permitted him to devote himself to the study of plants at his home, Stodday Lodge, near Lancaster, and then at Bolton Lodge, Bolton-le-Sands. In this he collaborated with his wife, <a name="cosubject_102426"></a><span class="headword">Mary Maria Fielding <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Simpson]</span></span>  (1804&#150;1895), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, whom he married on 21 December 1826. She was born at Lancaster on 25 January 1804, the daughter of John Simpson, merchant, of Lancaster, and his wife, Maria. In 1836 Henry Fielding bought the herbarium of Dr Steudel, forming the basis of what was to become one of the best private herbaria in Europe. That same year Sir William J. Hooker gave him some Arctic plants and he bought Peruvian plants collected by Andrew Mathews (<i>d</i>. 1841). These acquisitions rapidly increased the importance of his herbarium. In 1837 he purchased the collection of J. D. Prescott (consisting of 28,000 plants from Russia) and he later also bought a large part of the important collection of A. B. Lambert.<br>
<br>During the last twenty years of his life Fielding subscribed to almost every collection made by travelling botanists and bought much at sales. In 1842 the dampness of his home at Bolton-le-Sands induced him to move to a more airy house in Lancaster. Mary Fielding was active in preserving his collection; they both spent several hours each day mounting, arranging, describing, and figuring the specimens. This further increased the value of the Fielding herbarium, which was noted for its high standard of preservation and order.<br>
<br>Fielding was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1838 but his retiring disposition prevented him from taking an active public role in the scientific community. He was also a member of the London Botanical Society. In 1843 he was assisted by the botanist George Gardner in preparing his <span class="italic">Sertum plantarum</span> (1844), with figures drawn by Mary Fielding and descriptions of seventy-five new or rare plants from the Fielding herbarium. At the time of his death he was engaged in classifying a large collection of north Indian plants that had come from Gardner. He died of pneumonia at Church Street, Lancaster, on 21 November 1851 and was buried at Churchtown, Lancashire. He bequeathed the whole of his herbarium (and part of his library) to the University of Oxford, where it formed one of the key resources for the study of botany.<br>
<br>Mary Fielding lived on independent means at Church Street, Lancaster, until her death there on 22 February 1895. Six volumes of her botanical watercolours, many of Lancashire plants, dated 1830&#150;33 (Bodl. Oxf., MSS Eng. d.3354&#150;3359), represent an important source for the study of the county's flora in the early nineteenth century. Her brother Samuel Simpson (1802&#150;1881), a solicitor, had amateur botanical interests and created a herbarium, before entering the Anglican ministry. Oxford made him an honorary MA in recognition of his sister's donation to the university.<br>
