</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Manwood, Sir  Roger</span>  (1524/5&#150;1592), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in Sandwich, Kent, the second son of Thomas Manwood (<i>d</i>. 1538), draper, and Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1566), daughter of John Galloway of Cley, Norfolk. The offspring of a long-established local merchant family, he was educated at the Thomas Ellis Chantry School, Sandwich.<h2>
<a name="Earlyadvancement"></a>Early advancement</h2>Manwood was admitted to the Inner Temple in February 1548 and by July 1553 he was doing legal work for the Cinque Ports. He was called to the bar by 1555, and became counsellor to the ports and recorder of Sandwich. He was one of the borough members for Hastings in the parliament of 1555, and represented Sandwich in 1558 and in every subsequent parliament until his appointment as a judge. He also obtained important clients among local families, including Sir Thomas Cheyney, lord warden of the Cinque Ports. By 1557 he had married a twice widowed woman, Dorothy Alleyn (<i>d</i>. 1575), daughter of Richard Theobald, who had been married first to Dr John Croke and who brought Manwood her jointure lands and a stepdaughter. In that year he was suing for her jointure in the courts on a difficult technical point. Problems of leasehold were one of his specialities, and he put his knowledge into practice for both himself and his clients. His views on this are known from his readings in 1565 on 21 Hen. VIII c. 3, and his arguments, for example in <i>Winter's case</i>, were long accepted as authoritative. His second reading as serjeant-elect in 1567 was on the <span class="roman">Statute of Westminster I c. 37</span>.<br>
<br>In 1561 Manwood played the part of chief baron of the exchequer in the Inner Temple entertainment, the <span class="italic">Masque of Desire and Beauty</span>, which Robert Dudley, the Inner Temple's patron, put on for Queen Elizabeth on St Stephen's day. Sir Christopher Hatton was also involved. Manwood thus had connections to the inner circle at court, and his committed protestantism made him a safe appointment as a JP in Kent and on other commissions. In 1562 he was adjudicating piracy cases. In 1563 he arranged to establish a grammar school in Sandwich. His commitment throughout his life to education for the bright but impoverished is as clear as his desire for a clean water supply. Later he established four scholarships at Oxford and Cambridge. His benefactions to his home parish of Hackington, Kent, included a hospital with six almshouses. He also gave two new bells, augmented the income of the vicarage, and built a conduit and the fourth aisle of the church. His rapid rise in his profession made him increasingly valuable to Sandwich and the Cinque Ports and prominent in Kent. He became steward of the liberties to Archbishop Parker and steward in the chancery and admiralty court of the warden at Dover. In 1566&#150;7 Gresham in a letter to William Cecil begged him to &#145;Have my friend Mr Manwood in remembrance&#146;  (Burgon, 2.175).<h2>
<a name="Practitionerandjudge"></a>Practitioner and judge</h2>Manwood was called to the lucrative order of serjeant-at-law on 24 April 1567. As a serjeant he served as an assize judge, acted as an arbitrator, and gave legal opinions on such matters as the privileges for battery and the use of the calamine stone. In 1570 he surveyed all the grounds previously used for archery near London. On 30 March 1571 he, together with Thomas Leighton, wrote a report on the death of Cardinal Chastillon. With John Jeffreys in 1571 he arbitrated in a matter between Weymouth and Melcombe Regis. As an active adviser to the Cinque Ports he was one of their representatives in the exchequer where he handled issues of their franchises, liberties, privileges, and exemptions from loans and aids. He also remained on close terms with his old inn, and was concerned for the well-being of family and friends, especially his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18013/', "Peter Manwood")</script>. He was reluctant to become a judge. Gresham wrote on 16 April 1572 that there were others of more ancient standing, and &#145;because yet his welthe doth not serve to accept anie such office upon him&#146; he should be passed over  (Burgon, 2.478). Manwood had prepared for it, however, by settling his already considerable estates, worth approximately &pound;475 a year. On 30 May 1571 he provided for his wife and entailed the property on his only surviving son, and in default to his daughters.<br>
<br>Manwood had resigned as recorder of Sandwich on becoming a serjeant. Becoming a puisne justice of common pleas on 14 October 1572 required him to resign all other lesser offices and to cease to represent clients. In 1572 he aroused comment by appearing twice in <i>White's case</i>, first as serjeant and later as judge, even though this might have prejudiced his former client's case. He had long kept records of cases, and there are various references to reports he kept during his tenure of judicial office. He also continued to be involved with Canterbury, Sandwich, and the Cinque Ports in matters of law. Because of his expertise in their abstruse privileges, the crown required him to determine issues involving conflict between the ports and the warden. Sometimes his judgments were unpopular with the ports.<br>
<br>The privy council called on Manwood as a judge to deal with cases elsewhere involving royal rights and local privileges. He was involved in amending the laws of Star Chamber, and gave his opinion on the observation of the penal statutes. He advised on the action to be taken when assizes in Cornwall and Lancaster had charged the wrong man. He assisted Wells with its new charter of incorporation, and was helpful to Southampton, which made him free. Manwood also arbitrated in a festering controversy between Oxford University and the city. In matters of felony he was severe, and routinely charged juries who acquitted against the evidence, but he was also sceptical, so it is not surprising that Reginald Scot dedicated <span class="italic">The Discovery of Witchcraft</span> (1584) to him. In 1577 Manwood advised that a man persisting in speaking ill of the queen after the pillory and having his ears cut off might either be imprisoned for life or have part of his tongue excised. He was not abrasive to his fellow lawyers&#151;in 1578, when Plowden had given bad advice to a sheriff concerning a writ of extent, Manwood tactfully observed that perhaps Mr Plowden did not know of an entry that indicated that execution had not taken place.<h2>
<a name="Chiefbaron"></a>Chief baron</h2>Manwood's religious commitment explains his role in ecclesiastical affairs. In June 1575 he served on a commission against Anabaptists, and in April 1576 became a member of the high commission. Later he served on commissions for ecclesiastical causes, for reformation of the court of arches and audience, and at a conference concerning the powers of ecclesiastical laws to mulct and otherwise punish offenders. By 1577 he was being considered for the position of chief baron of the exchequer. Francis Walsingham promised to help, knowing &#145;no man in England so fit for it &hellip; but &hellip; he hath great enemies and those that have chiefest voice in chapter&#146;  (<span class="italic">Finch MSS</span>, 1.22). Cecil may have been this principal opponent; if so, his opposition may have rested on Manwood's profound commitment to the common law as the subject's protection, and his dislike of the intervention of the privy council at the petition of favoured individuals. Manwood's classical tags, that truth made enemies (&#145;malas causas habentes semper fugiunt ad potentes; ubi non valet veritas, praevalet auctoritas&#146;), were unpopular. However, he was knighted on 15 November and installed as chief baron on 17 November 1578. His one-time client Nicholas Bacon gave the address. In 1582 it was rumoured that Manwood had offered money to be chief justice of common pleas; if so he was unsuccessful. In July 1586 he wrote to Lord Burghley explaining how the people of Kent were grieved by purveyors and suggesting better regulations; and in 1589, when unpaid mercenaries were in distress at Sandwich, he intervened to get them paid.<br>
<br>Manwood's promotion sealed his position in society. His first wife, Dorothy, had died &#145;of a sore breast&#146; on 14 September 1575; she was buried in the church of St Gregory by Paul, London. His second marriage, <i>c</i>.1580, to Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1595), daughter of John Coppinger of All Hallows, Kent, and widow of John Wilkins of Stoke, Kent, was another indication of increased status. He married his daughter Margaret to John Leveson of Harling, and in 1587, by agreeing to a very generous settlement, he arranged with Dame Elizabeth Harte a double marriage by which Percival Harte married Manwood's daughter Anne, and Manwood's heir, Peter, married Percival's sister Frances. He was to pay &pound;200 a year for them to live with Dame Elizabeth.<br>
<br>As lord chief baron, Manwood actively protected the exchequer's jurisdiction in matters relating to the queen's prerogative and rights. In 1585 he sharply forbade Julius Caesar to hear a case in the admiralty. He maintained that cases of controversy over patentees, as well as decisions over the property of Sir Francis Englefield who had &#145;adhered to the queen's enemies&#146;, belonged in the exchequer  (Hunt. L., Ellesmere MS 482, fol. 236). He also made legal doctrine. In a case in exchequer chamber concerning variations in the meaning of the term &#145;corporation&#146; he wrote a letter to Burghley about what was and was not substantial, contradicting Burghley's own views. He required the solicitor-general to answer &#145;<i>pro bono publico</i> and to deliver himself in conscience because the matter would be cited for a precedent &hellip; to the prejudice of many other suitors&#146;  (Hunt. L., Ellesmere MS 2650).<br>
<br>Manwood sat on all the state trials, including the trial of the supporters of the Jesuit Edmund Campion, and argued for heavier punishments. When Cartwright and his puritan fellows refused to take an oath, he claimed this tended to the overthrow of the common justice of the land in all civil and ecclesiastical causes. He was also concerned with the case of Mary, queen of Scots, and sought to show that the queen had dealt honourably with Mary, whereas Mary had dealt dishonourably with the queen. In the Star Chamber case against William Davison he put the crucial argument: &#145;if the warrant were sealed yet was it not lawful to kill her because the direction was special and not general&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 1.1230). The complaints that Burghley entertained against Manwood for abuse of his office are varied. Some concerned legitimate use of his position in the queen's interest. In others, where undue pressure was alleged, the evidence that he exceeded his legal rights is slender. Those involving mutual recriminations, as in the highway robberies at Gaddeshill where Edward Hoby and Manwood accused one another of maintenance, seem insoluble.<br>
<br>After 1588 Manwood was overtly troubled by royal encroachments on the traditional rights of citizens. His enemy Sir John Smythe reported that Manwood condemned the conscription of soldiers for overseas service. In June 1591 he and most of the other judges formally complained against arbitrary impressment. By 1590 the privy council was entertaining various complaints about his possibly corrupt verdicts, but he produced adequate explanations. He increasingly seems, however, to have come into conflict with Burghley over the use of royal power to override normal process of law. The case over which he was finally humiliated concerned a gold chain, which Manwood had recovered from a goldsmith named Roger Underwood. The law seems to have been on Manwood's side, but the privy council pressured him to admit that justice demanded concessions. His rigid refusal to accept privy council authority in this offended Burghley and the council and he was obliged to submit, confessing his folly first in a letter and publicly two days later on 14 May 1592. Historians believe that he none the less again offered money to be chief justice of queen's bench, although his extant letter to Burghley (in which he gives his age as sixty-seven) refers only to his undoubted seniority as serjeant.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>After this, although his old enemies renewed their complaints, Manwood continued actively in office until his death in St Stephen's parish, Hackington, on 14 December 1592. His will, dated 12 December, left money for annual sermons to be preached at Hackington and St Mary's, Sandwich, in which mention was to be made of the frailty and vain delights of this world. He recounted all his good deeds&#151;the most recent being a hospital for poor priests in Canterbury and the gaol house of correction there&#151;as <i>rei publice</i>, the &#145;one tenth of his value being the talent in this life to me lent by Almighty God&#146;. Claiming he would &#145;do as he would be done unto&#146;, he gave large sums of money to his extended family. His widow was to receive &pound;550 a year. His heir, Peter, would inherit providing he lived five years beyond Elizabeth's death without committing treason. He was buried in St Stephen's Church, Hackington, under a monument, erected before his death, which depicts him in his robes as a baron, with two wives, five children, and a life-size wooden skeleton. His extensive lands were closely focused in eastern Kent and the Isle of Thanet. He was exceptionally litigious in a litigious age. If his adversaries described him in slanderous terms, he sued. It was said that he brought more cases of <i>scandalum magnatum</i> than any other person.<br>
<br>Manwood was a man who aroused strong feeling. His hard dealings in property transactions were legal but not necessarily equitable, as he clawed himself from nothing to own property worth at least &pound;1500 a year. His enemies revived their hatred when they judged him vulnerable. His neighbour at Shorne, Richard Burston, was not assuaged by the provision of free running water to his house, and pursued him for oppression to his death.<br>
<br>Manwood was the centre of many controversies and the subject of myth-making. Christopher Marlowe, perhaps his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, perhaps merely grateful that Manwood had released him at the London assizes in 1589, wrote a Latin eulogy, which starts:<blockquote>
<div>Here lies the dour scourge of the profligate<br>
</div>
<div>Instrument of the hardened criminals fate<br>
</div>
<div>Fearsome to vagrants, Hercules from Jove sent<br>
</div>
<div>Celebrate you old lags! If innocent,<br>
</div>
<div>Weep with dishevelled hair and mournful breast,<br>
</div>
<div>Law's light and glory now has gone to rest.<br>
</div> (Bakeless, 286&#150;7)</blockquote>Archbishop Parker, thirty years earlier, had praised Manwood's charity, describing him as a living example that not all lawyers were concerned first and last with their own well-being. Richard Mulcaster in his <span class="italic">Elementarie</span> (1581) wrote of him as one of the &#145;greate founders to learning both within the universities and in the countries about them&#146;. Sir Edward Coke said he was &#145;A reverend judge of great and excellent knowledge of the law and accompanied with a ready invention and good elocution&#146;  (Coke, pt 3, 26a). Legal historians see him as a sage of the law and a justice of proven reputation. His enemies, however, damned him: &#145;as proud a man as ever I knew&#146;, and &#145;so given to revenge&#146; that no one dared &#145;meddle in his causes&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 71, no. 1); a cruel man who oppressed his neighbours and used corruption and bribery to further his career. In 1577 Thomas Digges claimed &#145;he rejoiced that he lived in that estate where Mr Justice Manwood was not the best but that there were Superior Magistrates he doubted not were able to rule and govern him according to equity&#146;. Manwood retorted, &#145;Rule me. No there is none in England shall rule or govern me&#146;. Digges replied: &#145;I hope there is one ys able to rule you &hellip; The Queen&#146;. &#145;Tush&#146;, quoth Master Manwood. &#145;She is a woman. I say there is no man in England shall rule me and that I will make you feel&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 24, no. 30, fol. 91). Scurrilous stories circulated. When a murder was committed in Canterbury, Manwood allegedly took &pound;240 and obtained the culprit a free pardon. His legal aphorisms, such as &#145;In the Common Pleas there is all law and no conscience; In the Queens bench both law and conscience, in the chancery all conscience and no law and in the Exchequer neither law nor conscience&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of John Manningham</span>, 91), circulated widely and some became legal commonplaces.<br>
