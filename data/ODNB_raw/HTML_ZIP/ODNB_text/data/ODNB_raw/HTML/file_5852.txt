</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cole, Sir  Henry</span>  (1808&#150;1882), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born in Bath on 15 July 1808, the son of an army officer, Captain Henry Robert Cole, and his wife, Laetitia Dormer. He attended Christ's Hospital school from 1817 to 1823, and on leaving found employment as a clerk to Sir Francis Palgrave, one of the sub-commissioners at the record commission. Three years later he obtained rooms in the home of the writer, Thomas Love Peacock, whose son worked with Cole at the record commission. While living there Cole's circle of friends grew to include writers and artists, as well as young men such as John Stuart Mill and Charles Buller, who were to become known as the philosophical radicals. Cole's utilitarian connections and his employment as a civil servant were the basis for what was to be a very influential career in public service.<h2>
<a name="Reformingtherecordcommission"></a>Reforming the record commission</h2>The first indication that Cole was a man to be reckoned with was his successful campaign to reform the record commission. After a disagreement with his employer about his salary Cole decided that the time had come to expose the record commission as a hotbed of jobbery and corruption. He wrote articles, including two in <span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, describing the corruption and the lack of progress in achieving the aims of the commission, which had been set up to investigate the state of the public records which were housed in a number of more or less unsatisfactory buildings around London. Cole was removed from his post in 1835, and suffered a number of attacks on his honesty and character, but at the end of the resulting inquiry by a parliamentary committee he was reinstated, in 1837, and was made one of four senior assistant keepers at the re-formed record office of 1838. His career as a public servant was now at a higher level, but the rumblings about his motivation and honesty were never silenced.<br>
<br>Cole was a first-rate administrator with energy and commitment and an ability to pursue his aims undeterred by opposition and criticism. His superiors at the record commission gave him leave in 1838 to assist Rowland Hill (another utilitarian) in his campaign to introduce a national prepaid postage system. Cole devised a scheme by which the Post Office circulated the reform propaganda free of charge. At that time the Post Office carried newspapers free of charge. Cole edited a weekly newspaper giving news about postal reform, the <span class="italic">Post Circular</span>, which was printed and then, because it was presented as a newspaper, distributed free of charge by the Post Office. It may be that the cheap penny post was Cole's inspiration in commissioning and publishing the first Christmas card in 1843. The card depicted a family at table making a toast. Designed by J. C. Horsley RA, it was lithographed and hand coloured, selling at the considerable price of 1<i>s</i>.<br>
<br>In 1845 Cole, by now an accomplished journalist, began to contribute to the <span class="italic">Railway Chronicle</span>, producing a series of railway charts and articles on railway excursions. He joined in the campaigns for the uniform narrow gauge and for separation of freight from passenger traffic. His involvement in the commercial world paid well, and Cole earned more from his journalistic activities than he did as a keeper at the record office. With his salary of &pound;500 and his additional earnings of about &pound;750 he was a man in comfortable circumstances.<br>
<br>Cole's family life was very full. He married his cousin Marian Fairman Bond, a governess, on 28 December 1833. They had three sons and five daughters. He wrote a series of children's illustrated story books, published from 1841 as the <span class="italic">Home Treasury</span>, under the pseudonym of Felix Summerly, a name he continued to use when he began to sell &#145;art manufactures&#146; in the late 1840s. His diary records time spent with his children. He was concerned that the girls as well as the boys should have an adequate education and find suitable occupations.<h2>
<a name="TheGreatExhibitionof1851"></a>The Great Exhibition of 1851</h2>It was through John Scott Russell, editor of the <span class="italic">Railway Chronicle</span>, that Cole was introduced into membership of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce in 1845. In this society Cole found the like-minded people with whom he could work to achieve reforms and improvements in almost any aspect of life, from sewage to education, industrial design to army reform. It was Cole's involvement with the society which placed him at the centre of the group which organized the Great Exhibition in 1851, where his roles were promoter, publicist, and administrator. As a council member of the Society of Arts he worked directly for its president, Prince Albert, travelling the country to promote the exhibition, and using the press to communicate as widely as possible. Once the commission for the exhibition was established Cole was seconded from the record office and appointed to a salaried position on the executive committee. He was chairman of council of the Society of Arts in 1850 and again in 1852 and continued to be a very influential member of the society throughout his life. Although he involved himself in all aspects of the management of the exhibition his primary responsibility was for the allocation of space for the 14,000 exhibitors from Britain, eleven colonies, and thirteen foreign countries. Cole was among those who fought to prevent the dismantling of the building at the end of the exhibition; the building was eventually re-erected at Sydenham. He was party to the discussions about the possible uses of the surplus funds which seemed likely to be available at the close of the exhibition. The surplus was used, together with a sum provided by the government, for the purchase of land at Brompton, just south of the exhibition site in Hyde Park. Prince Albert, as president of the commission for the exhibition, hoped that the site could be used to promote the same aims as the exhibition&#151;the promotion of industry and the arts. Cole was to spend the next twenty years working to make &#145;South Kensington&#146; a national centre for the arts and sciences.<h2>
<a name="Schoolsofartanddesign"></a>Schools of art and design</h2>From 1848 Cole had been involving himself in the schools of design which had been established under the Board of Trade in 1836. His interest in industrial design had been stimulated by the offer of prizes by the Society of Arts in 1846. Cole had designed a tea service which won a Society of Arts prize. The tea service went into mass production at the Minton factory with great success. Cole was offered the chance to lecture at the Central School of Design, declined the offer, but began to campaign for reform of the schools and to discuss with Lord Granville, president of the Board of Trade, his concerns about copyright, patent law, and the schools of design. A select committee on the schools of design was established in 1849. After the close of the Great Exhibition, Cole, who had worked closely with Granville on the executive committee, was invited to be secretary of a new government department to control the schools, the department of practical art. He provided training for women as well as men at the schools at South Kensington, and after his retirement set up the National Training School for Music and the National Training School for Cookery.<br>
<br>In 1856 Cole's fledgeling department moved to the site purchased with the profits of the Great Exhibition. The first new building on the site was a temporary modular building, known as the &#145;Brompton Boilers&#146;, which housed the museum collections of the Central School of Design together with the collection of exhibits from the Great Exhibition which had been purchased by the Treasury at Cole's suggestion and loaned to the schools. By the time of Cole's retirement in 1873 the site housed the South Kensington Museum (later to divide into the Victoria and Albert and Science museums), the various schools of the department now called the Department of Science and Art, the Albert Hall, and the gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society. Cole, whose official responsibility was for the relatively small portion of the land which housed his department and its museums, had made himself responsible for the whole site and for making it the national centre for the arts and sciences which had been envisaged by Prince Albert. He used the device of public exhibitions which he promoted in order to justify the erection of buildings, notably that for the second Great Exhibition in 1862. He was involved in planning the Horticultural Society gardens at South Kensington and in fund-raising for the project. His determination that a large public hall suitable for exhibitions and concerts should be built at South Kensington resulted in the Albert Hall, a building opened in 1871 and used in its first few years for a series of themed international exhibitions, subsequently for a very wide variety of events, being affectionately known as &#145;the nation's village hall&#146;. Cole's power within the small kingdom of South Kensington was recognized by his popular title of &#145;King Cole&#146;.<br>
<br>Cole cared little for his personal appearance and his untidy, portly figure was ridiculed and caricatured, notably in <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> in 1871. His manner could be rather abrasive and his methods authoritarian. His civil service career ended under a cloud, when he was found to have inadequately supervised his department's less than honest accountant. Between 1876 and 1879 Cole lived in Birmingham and Manchester, and was involved with a company set up to promote a process developed by General Scott (a royal engineer employed at South Kensington in various capacities) for treating sewage. The company failed and Cole returned to London. He was created CB at the end of the Great Exhibition and was knighted in 1875. He died at his home, 96 Philbeach Gardens, Kensington, London, on 18 April 1882 and was buried in Brompton cemetery. He was survived by his wife.<br>
