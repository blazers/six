<span class="headword">MacDonnell,  Alasdair Ruadh, of Glengarry</span> <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Pickle the Spy]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1725&#150;1761), <span class="occ">spy and chief of clan Macdonnell of Glengarry</span>, was the eldest son of John MacDonnell (<i>d</i>. 1754), chief of Glengarry, and his wife, the daughter of Colin Mackenzie of Hilton. Known as young Glengarry until he succeeded his father as clan chief, Alasdair was brought up in the Roman Catholic church. He was sent to France while still a boy, and became a captain in Lord John Drummond's Scots Royals regiment in 1743, when the French were planning to invade England under pretext of restoring the Stuarts. There he met Charles Edward Stuart, who had arrived from Rome unannounced to join the expedition, and was with him in Paris among the scheming pro-Charles and pro-Pretender factions after the invasion collapsed. He visited Scotland early in 1745, but returned to France to warn that clan chiefs would support a rising only if backed by French money and arms. By the time he reached France Prince Charles had sailed for Scotland.<br>
<br>That autumn, young Glengarry sailed with the Scots Royals to reinforce the successful Jacobite army, but the <i>Esp&eacute;rance</i>, aboard which he was travelling, was captured off Deal and he was imprisoned in the Tower of London. On his release in 1747 he returned to Paris in dire poverty and in debt to the French government. Prince Charles and the Pretender both refused him financial help, and when he asked to be recommended to succeed Lochiel as colonel of the Scots-French Albany regiment, he was passed over. All the Pretender offered him was a duplicate of his grandfather's warrant as a Jacobite peer&#151;with an assurance that the document was genuine.<br>
<br>By the end of 1749 young Glengarry was living in London in dire poverty, secretly trying to obtain permission to settle in Britain. Yet only months later he was in funds, having helped himself to the Loch Arkaig treasure, gold sent from France too late to be of use to the prince in 1746. Glengarry was accused of forging James's signature to obtain this money, and became caught up in the clan quarrels surrounding it, which took him to Rome to present his version of events to the Pretender.<br>
<br>The historian Andrew Lang exposed the extent of the young Glengarry's treachery, which culminated in betrayal of the Elibank plot to kidnap the Hanoverian royal family in 1752 and the subsequent execution of Archibald Cameron. The British government had Cameron executed on an old warrant instead of bringing him to trial in order to avoid exposing their agent, who now went by the alias Pickle the Spy, from Tobias Smollett's novel <span class="italic">Peregrine Pickle</span>. Pickle continued to spy until 1754, when his paymaster, Henry Pelham, died, and he succeeded to the Glengarry chiefship on his father's death in September of the same year. He never married, and on his death in Glengarry in 1761 was succeeded by his nephew, Donald, son of his brother, Aeneas.<br>
<br>Why or when Pickle began his espionage career is not known, but it is probable that he was driven to it by poverty during his imprisonment in the Tower of London. Continuing lack of funds, clan feuds, and disillusionment with the Stuarts kept him loyal to his spymasters. His brother had been killed accidentally by a Cameron clansman at Falkirk, and he and his father had suffered imprisonment during the rising, yet afterwards neither Prince Charles nor the Pretender would provide financial support or career preferment. Although suspected, Pickle was never exposed during his lifetime; a fact that may owe something to his alignment with the prince's party and Charles Edward's stubborn refusal to accept criticism of members of his faction. Andrew Lang revealed his identity 150 years later with the help of one blindingly simple clue&#151;in his correspondence and reports Glengarry always wrote &#145;how&#146; when he meant &#145;who&#146;  (Lang, <span class="italic">Pickle the Spy</span>, 147, 162).<br>
