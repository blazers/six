<span class="headword">Byrne <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>King]</span>,  Charlotte</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Charlotte Dacre]</span>  (1782?&#150;1825), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67336/', "John King, born Jacob Rey (c.1753&#150;1823)")</script>, a moneylender and radical writer well known in London society. Her father divorced her mother, Sara, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lara, under Jewish law in 1784 before setting up home with the dowager countess of Lanesborough. In 1798 Charlotte King published with her sister Sophia [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63521/', "Fortnum, Sophia (b. 1781/, d. in or after 1805)")</script>] a volume of Gothic verses, <span class="italic">Trifles of Helicon</span>, and dedicated it to her bankrupt father to show &#145;the education you have afforded us has not been totally lost&#146;. The reappearance of poems from this volume in <span class="italic">Hours of Solitude</span> (1805), published under the pseudonym Charlotte Dacre, confirms the identity between Dacre and King; the pen-name was probably designed to suggest aristocratic connections. She also wrote verses for the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> and <span class="italic">Morning Herald</span> under the name Rosa Matilda, perhaps after the demonic lover in Matthew Lewis's <span class="italic">The Monk</span> (1796); <span class="italic">Hours of Solitude</span> had for a frontispiece a darkly glamorous portrait of herself as Rosa Matilda. The poems, full of Gothic passions and imagery, briefly influenced Byron (<span class="italic">Hours of Idleness</span>, 1807) though in <span class="italic">English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</span> (1809, ll. 755&#150;62) he would scorn &#145;the lovely ROSA's prose in masquerade&#146;. Also in 1805 she published <span class="italic">The Confessions of the Nun of St. Omer</span>, a Gothic tale of sexual repression and misbehaviour. In the preface Dacre claims the book was written at the age of eighteen and left untouched for three years during journeys abroad. The <span class="italic">British Critic</span> for December 1805  (p. 671) called it &#145;a very fine, sentimental, and improbable story written in turgid and affected language &hellip; The moral, however, is good, for it teaches the mischief which arises from the neglect and violation of social duties.&#146;<br>
<br>In the following year Dacre published <span class="italic">Zofloya, or, The Moor</span>. The corruption of the strong and sexually ruthless heroine Victoria, and her gradual enslavement to the charismatic Moorish servant Zofloya (later revealed to be Satan), is set against a sublime landscape of extreme and irrational forces. Ostensibly didactic in purpose, its evident taste for murderous horror shocked reviewers: the <span class="italic">Literary Journal</span> (June 1806, 631) thought the author had &#145;maggots in the brain&#146;; the <span class="italic">Monthly Literary Recreations</span> (July 1806, 80) deplored the &#145;odious and indecent performance&#146;. Its poetic character, psychological acuteness, and moral status were, however, praised voluminously in the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> (17 May), the paper for which Dacre mostly wrote (she also bore the first of three children by its editor in this year). The book's influence on Shelley's perfervid Gothic fantasies <span class="italic">Zastrozzi</span> and <span class="italic">St. Irvyne</span> is well documented.<br>
<br>In 1807 Dacre continued her series of sexual case studies with <span class="italic">The Libertine</span>. Again the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> defended its &#145;liberality of sentiment&#146; and &#145;utmost purity of moral&#146; against those (like the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span>) who thought it &#145;prurient trash&#146;  (Jones, 245). Her last novel, <span class="italic">The Passions</span> (1811), tried, according to its preface, to expose &#145;the danger &hellip; of yielding to the guilty violence of the Passions, or of swerving, even in <i>thought</i>, from the sacred line of virtue&#146;. Her sporadic newspaper verse of the next decade indicates a reactionary turn, and in 1822, she published the na&iuml;vely royalist <span class="italic">George the Fourth, a Poem</span>.<br>
<br>Charlotte's children with Nicholas Byrne (<i>d</i>. 1833), married owner and editor of the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, although born in 1806, 1807, and 1809, were not baptized until 8 June 1811 (at St Paul's, Covent Garden). On 1 July 1815 Byrne, now a widower, married &#145;Charlotte King spinster&#146; at St James's, Westminster. She died on 7 November 1825, &#145;in Lancaster Place, after a long and painful illness, which her purity of heart and sublime greatness of soul enabled her patiently and piously to endure&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 9 Nov 1825). She was buried at St Mary's, Paddington, on 11 November. The register records her age as fifty-three, which would put her date of birth about 1772; this is probably a mistake, but if true then her statement about her age in the preface to <span class="italic">Hours of Solitude</span> underestimates it by a decade.<br>
