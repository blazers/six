</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pulteney,  William</span>, earl of Bath  (1684&#150;1764), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 22 March 1684 and baptized in London on 28 or 29 March 1684, at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Trafalgar Square, the eldest son of Colonel William Pulteney (<i>b</i>. in or after 1655, <i>d</i>. 1715) and his first wife, Mary Floyd. His grandfather Sir William Pulteney (1624&#150;1691), a descendant of the Pulteneys of Misterton, in Leicestershire, was a substantial London landowner and MP for Westminster (1679&#150;81 and 1689&#150;91); his aunt Anne married Charles Fitzroy, second duke of Cleveland, natural son of Charles II and Barbara Villiers. Pulteney was educated at Westminster School and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 31 October 1700. He was a noted classical scholar and was chosen to deliver the congratulatory speech to Queen Anne on her visit in 1702. In parallel to his classical scholarship he developed a skill in sports, excelling particularly at horse riding and fencing. The earliest known portrait of him depicts him as a boy with a hawk on his arm.<br>
<br>Following Oxford, Pulteney made the grand tour in 1704&#150;5, his presence recorded in Padua in October 1704, Rome in 1705, and Venice and Augsburg in August 1705. While visiting Hanover in the summer of 1705 he was called home to take his seat as MP for Hedon, in Yorkshire, which he had won in the 1705 general election, at the age of twenty-one. He owed this seat to the patronage of Henry Guy, former secretary to the Treasury, who was a close friend of the family and a trustee of the will of Sir William Pulteney. On the death of his sister in 1692 Guy had settled his estates for the ultimate benefit of Pulteney.<h2>
<a name="Earlypoliticalcareer"></a>Early political career</h2>From the outset of his parliamentary career Pulteney was a whig, and voted in October 1705 for John Smith, the whig candidate for the speakership of the House of Commons. The presence of his uncle John Pulteney in the Commons makes identification difficult for Pulteney's early years in the House. However, he supported the court in February 1706 over the place clause promoted by the country whigs as an amendment to the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span>. Pulteney's political gifts saw him earmarked as a rising whig star; Thomas Wharton, first earl of Wharton, had him in mind in 1708 as his secretary following his appointment as lord lieutenant of Ireland. About this date Pulteney fell into the orbit of another rising whig, Robert Walpole, with whom he was to be associated for most of his political career, first as an ally, then as a deadly political foe. It may have been Walpole who introduced Pulteney to the Kit-Cat Club, the centre of the whig &eacute;lite's social activities. Pulteney's active social life occasionally caused him trouble; in January 1709 it was reported that:<blockquote>the Pulteney which is distinguished as Henry Guy's heir&#151;he had a quarrel with a gentleman at the Playhouse, and they went outside to decide it, but before he got out of the passage there came two more and drew their swords upon him, but the footmen and chairmen prevented any mischief that night. (<span class="italic">Wentworth Papers</span>, 71)</blockquote>However, the next morning Pulteney met the man again and knocked him down with his cane, leading to another fracas and to fears of a vendetta. In parliament Pulteney continued to toe the whig line, voting in February 1709 for the naturalization of the Palatines and in March 1710 for the impeachment of Dr Henry Sacheverell.<br>
<br>Following the installation of a tory ministry under Robert Harley (later earl of Oxford) in autumn 1710 Pulteney faced a rare challenge at Hedon in the ensuing general election, held in October. He defeated his tory rival with ease and survived a subsequent petition against his return. The death of Henry Guy, in February 1711, left him independently rich. He inherited from Guy an estate at Stoke Newington, Middlesex, another at Muswell Hill, and money and other property, eventually realizing some &pound;20,000, which was to be invested in land. Guy also left Pulteney his property at Hedon, which included the town hall, where portraits of both of them hang and which formed the basis for his political control of the borough. In parliament Pulteney continued to support the whigs, possibly with sufficient effect to ensure that his uncle John lost his government post on the Board of Trade in June 1711. On 7 December 1711 he voted for the &#145;No peace without Spain&#146; motion. In January 1712 he defended first Walpole and then John Churchill, duke of Marlborough, against charges of corruption relating to government army contracts. Pulteney kept in close touch with Walpole when the latter was incarcerated in the Tower, although intemperate language in a debate on 28 May 1712 on the restraining orders issued to James Butler, second duke of Ormond, in which he described the ministry as &#145;weak and treacherous&#146;  (Hanham), angered the tories so much that he was in danger of being sent to join him. At the opening of the 1713 session Pulteney spoke and voted against the address, and was soon a key debater in the campaign against the peace made at Utrecht and the commercial treaty with France. Nor was Pulteney's opposition confined to the debating chamber; in 1713 he penned the satirical dedication to Lord Treasurer Oxford affixed to Walpole's <span class="italic">Short History of a Parliament</span> and he was a subscriber to a fund designed to enable Emperor Charles VI to continue the war following the Utrecht settlement. In the parliamentary session of 1714 Pulteney was again at the forefront of whig critics of the ministry, particularly their attempt to expel Richard Steele from the Commons in March. Pulteney was also one of the first to allude publicly to the widening fissure in the tory ministry between Oxford and Bolingbroke in June 1714, noting that &#145;he did not know who the ministry was, or whether we had any, or how such as are reckoned can be relied on, seeing they cannot trust one another&#146;  (ibid.). Not surprisingly Pulteney was one of those whigs courted by Bolingbroke in late July 1714 in a desperate attempt to shore up his crumbling political position.<h2>
<a name="Office"></a>Office</h2>The short parliamentary session following the accession of George I, in August 1714, saw Pulteney support provision of a reward of &pound;100,000 for the capture of the Pretender. Pulteney's own prize for his steadfast support of the whig cause in the latter years of Queen Anne's reign was his appointment as secretary-at-war in October 1714. One account has Pulteney taking the post at the old salary&#151;&pound;1000 less than usual&#151;&#145;that his majesty might have &pound;1,000 a year to gratify somebody else&#146;, adding that &#145;this story he [Pulteney] tells himself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wentworth Papers</span>, 425). On 27 December 1714 Pulteney married Anna Maria (1694&#150;1758), one of three daughters and coheirs of John Gumley (<i>d</i>. 1728) of Isleworth, a mirror-glass- and cabinet-maker, who provided her with a portion of &pound;6000. Through his son-in-law's influence Gumley became deputy commissary-general of the army in 1716, MP for Steyning in 1722, and commissary-general in 1724. The new couple set up house in Arlington Street, Piccadilly. Pulteney's wife was acknowledged as very good-looking but she had attracted a reputation for having been free with her favours, at least before their marriage, and this was later to be used to punishing effect by satirists intent upon attacking her husband. Thus she appears in one print with her bare backside being used as a desk by a secretary and later she was branded &#145;Mrs Pony&#146; and &#145;Bath's ennobled Doxy&#146;. Like Pulteney she was also perceived to be interested in the accumulation of wealth, and she was notable for successfully managing her own separate fortune. Both Pulteneys were reputed to have sharp tongues, Horace Walpole later referring to &#145;my Lord and Lady Bath who live in a vinegar bottle&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 16). A son and a daughter lived beyond infancy, but neither survived their father.<br>
<br>The death of his father, in 1715, saw Pulteney inherit a life interest in the London estates settled by the will of his grandfather. This property primarily comprised part of Cleveland Row opposite St James's Palace, together with a large part of the western side of Soho and two pieces of land on the northern side of Piccadilly, at that time undeveloped. Pulteney immediately began to plan developments and improvements across the whole estate. The development in Soho is today represented by the area bounded by Wardour Street and Carnaby Street, with Great Pulteney Street at its heart. In Piccadilly the eastern portion extends from Piccadilly Circus to Sackville Street, and the western area covers Bolton Street to Down Street. It was on this portion that Pulteney built his London home&#151;known after his elevation to the peerage as Bath House&#151;to the designs of Giacomo Leoni in 1735. Surviving records show that in spite of the Pulteneys' reputation for parsimony the house was furnished and equipped expensively and in the fashionable taste of the period. The house was demolished and rebuilt in 1821.<br>
<br>In April 1715 Pulteney served on the committee of secrecy appointed to investigate the conduct of the recent peace negotiations that had led to the treaty of Utrecht and to the impeachment of the earl of Oxford. On 9 January 1716 he moved the impeachment of Lord Widdrington for his involvement in the 1715 rising, and later opposed a motion to the king requesting clemency for Jacobite recantors. He was sworn of the privy council on 6 July 1716. In the split in whig ranks in 1717 he sided with Charles, second Viscount Townshend, and with Walpole, and, following the dismissal of the first and the resignation of the second, he and Sir Paul Methuen resigned on 11 April 1717. For the next three years Pulteney was a whig in opposition to the whig ministry. As early as 4 June 1717 he made a long speech attacking William, first Baron Cadogan, a mainstay of the Sunderland&#150;Stanhope ministry, charging him with fraud and embezzlement over the costs of transporting troops. However, Pulteney was not an unthinking follower of Walpole, and refused to join him in January 1718 in voting with the tories to reduce the standing army. Pulteney voted against the repeal of the occasional conformity and schism bills in January 1719 and opposed the <span class="roman">Peerage Bill</span> in December 1719.<br>
<br>Pulteney's first real cause for disagreement with Walpole followed the negotiations in April 1720 that saw Walpole return to political favour with a leading role at the Treasury and a promise that those whigs who had resigned with him would be brought back into office. When the other whigs were given office at the end of the session all Pulteney was offered was a peerage, which he refused with some indignation. His reasons for declining this offer were probably political because his estate could certainly bear the burdens of a peerage and he may have felt that Walpole was deliberately sidelining him as a dangerous rival for power. Pulteney's recent foray into the South Sea Company had increased his wealth, as he had sold out before the &#145;bubble&#146; burst and incidentally enhanced his reputation for understanding public finance. Further, from the resultant profits he purchased the Bathwick estate, comprising 600 acres of agricultural and nursery-garden land on the east side of the River Avon opposite Bath. Although he improved the management of this estate he did not develop it beyond providing land for the creation of pleasure gardens for visitors to the increasingly fashionable spa. It was left to another generation to build the major extension to Bath known as the Pulteney estate and exploit its valuable sources of pure spring water. Concurrently Pulteney used his own and his wife's money to purchase the Wrington estate, of about 4000 acres, in north Somerset. This completed his major acquisition of income-producing land.<br>
<br>Pulteney showed his resentment at his omission from the ministry through a series of speeches in the Commons criticizing Walpole, most notably on 14 July 1721, when he accused him of changing his mind according to whether he was in or out of office, and again, on 16 February 1722, when he spoke of Walpole's attitude to financial questions being influenced by his investments in the Bank of England. Nevertheless he was given the prestigious lord lieutenancy of the East Riding of Yorkshire in December 1721, and the Pulteney estates in London were converted from a lease from the crown into a freehold. Pulteney remained a whig, taking charge of, and reporting from, the committee appointed to examine the relevant papers, and leading the examination of Christopher Layer and other Jacobite conspirators. His extensive parliamentary work on the Layer case between January and March 1723 was rewarded in May 1723, when he was appointed cofferer of the household. These favours may have helped to keep Pulteney loyal to the ministry but they were inconsiderable when compared to a major office of state. When John, second Baron Carteret, was replaced as secretary of state in April 1724 Pulteney expected to be given the office, which instead went to Thomas Pelham-Holles, duke of Newcastle. In the following parliamentary session Pulteney openly opposed Walpole's proposal for discharging a civil list debt in April 1725, even accusing Walpole of increasing his fortune &#145;by indirect means and corruption&#146; and of squandering public money on bribing MPs. After criticizing the proposal at every stage Pulteney eventually voted for the bill, claiming that he did so at the personal request of the king. However, this did not prevent his dismissal from the cofferer's post at the end of the parliamentary session in May 1725.<h2>
<a name="Opposition"></a>Opposition</h2>Pulteney may have led only a small group into opposition, possibly as few as seventeen, but he was soon to make clear his opposition to the Walpole ministry, speaking on the address on 20 January 1726 &#145;not to oppose it, only to show in what a sad condition we were in to go to war&#146;  (Sedgwick, &#145;Introductory survey&#146;, 35). This was a precursor of the motion of 9 February 1726 for a committee of investigation into the management of the public debts. Although this initiative was defeated it did allow an opposition group to begin to coalesce around Pulteney, and this included some tories, such as Sir William Wyndham. Foreign policy proved to be another fruitful area of co-operation for the opposition, and on 16 February 1726 Pulteney attacked the treaty of Hanover (1725) for having been solely intended to serve the interests of Hanover and for reversing Britain's traditional alliance with Austria. Pulteney continued his opposition in the following session, asking on 21 February 1727 for an account of the money spent on secret service payments. However, he resisted the intrigues of Charles VI, who hoped that a change of foreign policy could be effected by a change of ministry, even going so far as to back the address of 13 March 1727 supporting the treaty of Hanover.<br>
<br>As a vehicle for their burgeoning campaign against the Walpole ministry, on 5 December 1726 Pulteney, his cousin Daniel (son of his uncle John Pulteney), and the recently returned exile Henry St John, Viscount Bolingbroke, launched <span class="italic">The Craftsman</span>, initially as a weekly single-sheet publication. It soon developed into a twice-weekly paper that achieved a circulation estimated at 13,000 at its peak, in 1731. The anonymous articles were collated by Nicholas Amherst, and not all the authors were identified, so that some pieces remain unattributable. Pulteney was a major contributor, and his scholarship, literary background, and journalistic versatility set him apart from other contributors, so that it is probable that the majority of his articles have been correctly attributed. Most of Pulteney's literary output was in the form of anonymous pamphlets that were attributed to him at the time on the grounds of a recognizable style. His ability to communicate in an approachable manner, however complex the matters of state under discussion, allowed him to win a wide range of public support and understanding. He was considered a humorous writer but his attacks on his enemies in parliament and at court were sometimes vicious, lacking in subtlety, and over-fond of intemperate language. He was able to slip quickly from the reasoned argument into the heights of passion, and in speeches he was sometimes openly abusive. No doubt his wit in particular benefited from the friendship of Jonathan Swift, John Gay, and Alexander Pope, all of whom penned anti-ministerial material. Indeed, together with Pulteney, all of them seemed to have been involved in the good-humoured banter that arose from the publication of a series of satirical verses to be sung to the tune of &#145;Molly Mogg&#146;, which ran for several weeks in <span class="italic">Mist's Weekly Journal</span> in 1726. To such a well-qualified commentator on literary merit as Philip Dormer Stanhope, fourth earl of Chesterfield, Pulteney had:<blockquote>lively and shining parts; a surprising quickness of wit; and a happy turn to the most amusing and entertaining kinds of poetry, epigrams, ballads, odes, etc, in all which he had an uncommon facility. His compositions were sometimes satirical, often licentious, but always full of wit. (<span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works</span>, 25)</blockquote>The death of George I, on 10 June 1727, provided Pulteney with a significant chance of displacing Walpole, because he had been careful to cultivate the prince of Wales, now George II. However, the new queen, Caroline, was a strong supporter of Walpole, and this defeated Pulteney's attempts to undermine him by pressing for an increase in the civil list to &pound;800,000 per annum, which Walpole was able to obtain from parliament in any case. Pulteney was even rebuffed when he was refused leave to stand for Westminster on the court interest, which when added to being &#145;never consulted in the closet and always very coldly received in the drawing room&#146;  (Sedgwick, &#145;Pulteney&#146;, 1.375) led him back into opposition. He duly renewed his attack on the government's financial policy in a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">A State of the National Debt</span> (1727), in which he examined the worsening situation between 1716 and 1725. This challenge to Walpole's financial competency led to a debate on 22 February 1728 in which the workings of the sinking fund were laid before the Commons. On 29 February Pulteney undertook to prove the allegations contained in his pamphlet, but in the resultant debate on 8 March he was defeated by a large majority. After the end of the session, in July 1728, he was even replaced as lord lieutenant of the East Riding.<br>
<br>At the beginning of the 1729 session Pulteney refused to vote against the address on 21 January in case it was seen as &#145;a want of respect to his Majesty&#146;  (Colley, 209). This had the added advantage of allowing Pulteney to exploit any openings at court caused by the growing rift between Walpole and Viscount Townshend. Indeed on 31 January 1729, when Pulteney was disparaged in the Commons for opposing the ministry merely to return to office, he responded that:<blockquote>he was so far from desiring employments that he took pains to get rid of that he had, and, should any be offered him again, his refusal would show that he did not accuse the administration out of any such view. (Sedgwick, &#145;Pulteney&#146;, 1.375)</blockquote>In November 1729 Richard Franklin, the publisher of <span class="italic">The Craftsman</span>, was prosecuted by the government, but a sympathetic jury acquitted him. The public rejoicing following this verdict no doubt prompted Pulteney to celebrate in print himself with the ballad <span class="italic">The Honest Jury, or, Caleb's Triumphant</span>.<br>
<br>Pulteney continued to harass the Walpole ministry, particularly its foreign policy. In the debate on the address on 13 January 1730 he attacked the treaty of Seville, and on 6 February he criticized the continued employment for a further year of 12,000 Hessian troops, although his public pronouncements were considerably less inflammatory than his private comments. Further criticism followed on 10 February, over allegations that the ministry had allowed the fortifications at Dunkirk to be rebuilt by the French in contravention of the treaty of Utrecht. Pulteney was true to his word about not taking office when, following Townshend's dismissal in May 1730, Walpole offered him the vacant secretaryship coupled with a peerage. His refusal led to an ever more bitter pamphlet exchange between ministerial supporters and their opponents. One of the government's leading protagonists was Pulteney's erstwhile ally John, Lord Hervey, who penned an anonymous preface to an unsigned pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Sedition and Defamation Display'd: in a Letter to the Author of The Craftsman</span>. Later, in January 1731, Pulteney replied with <span class="italic">A Proper Reply to a Late Scurrilous Libel Intitled Sedition and Defamation Display'd</span>, in which, under the mistaken belief that Hervey had written the whole pamphlet, he launched a virulent and openly offensive attack on Hervey, which included scarcely veiled accusations of homosexuality. The result of this exchange was a duel on 25 January 1731 in what later became Green Park, in which both combatants were slightly wounded. The duel was commemorated in a series of prints that show a smirking Walpole in the background. Pulteney and Walpole continued to attack each other in pamphlets in 1731, most notably following a piece by Bolingbroke in <span class="italic">The Craftsman</span> that defended his own and Pulteney's political conduct. This prompted a ministerial riposte, <span class="italic">Remarks on the Craftsman's Vindication of his Two Honourable Patrons</span>, which heaped personal abuse on Pulteney. In response Pulteney published <span class="italic">An Answer to One Part of a Late Infamous Libel</span>, which dealt with the years of the Pulteney&#150;Walpole co-operation. So bitter had the exchanges become that an enraged Walpole had the printer of the tract arrested, and George II personally struck Pulteney's name off the list of privy councillors on 1 July 1731. He was also removed from the commission of the peace. Neither could Pulteney expect much succour from the church, Bishop Gibson informing Newcastle in July 1731 that &#145;the clergy look upon Mr P[ultene]y and his friends to be their greatest enemies&#146;  (Sykes, 145), following opposition whig support for the <span class="roman">Tithe Bill</span>.<br>
<br>Pulteney was a leading opponent of Walpole's excise scheme, which was introduced into parliament in 1733. He took part in a formal consultation at Cassiobury House at Christmas 1732 with Sir William Wyndham, lords Bolingbroke and Gower, and others to plan the opposition's tactics. However Pulteney was less comfortable with the use of &#145;instructions&#146; and popular political devices for pressurizing MPs. In debate he branded the excise as a plan for arbitrary power, noting that &#145;this scheme is absolutely inconsistent with a free election of members of parliament&#146;  (Langford, 74) and coining the phrase &#145;that monster the Excise&#146;  (Wright, 21). This sobriquet was perfect for the pamphleteers and the cartoonists, who weighed into the debate against the government. With Walpole forced to withdraw his proposal and his hold on power seemingly weakening, one opposition plan for a new ministry made Pulteney both first lord of the Treasury and chancellor of the exchequer, a sure sign of his pre-eminence among the opposition. However, Walpole recovered his political poise, purged his enemies within the court, and retained power with a convincing majority following the 1734 general election. Pulteney had taken this opportunity to stand, and gain election, for Middlesex in a joint candidature with a tory, Sir Francis Child, and incidentally thereby freeing a seat at Hedon. The disappointment of the election defeat and the prospect of more years in opposition led to some recrimination among the leaders of the opposition, which Lord Hervey gleefully recorded: Pulteney and Lord Bolingbroke &#145;hated one another; Lord Carteret and Pulteney were jealous of one another; Wyndham and Pulteney the same; whilst Lord Chesterfield had a little correspondence with all, but was confided in by none of them&#146;  (Hervey, 1.305).<br>
<br>Pulteney was involved in the litigation following the death, in December 1734, of Henry Newport, third earl of Bradford, an old travelling companion during his years on the grand tour. Bradford had disinherited his brother Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1762) as heir of his unentailed estate in favour of his mistress Ann Smyth, whose illegitimate son, known as John Newport, he acknowledged as his own. It is said that Ann Smyth was contemporaneously the mistress of Pulteney, who acted as guardian of John Newport in the litigation between Ann Smyth and the Newport family after Bradford's death, in which she successfully defended her inheritance. On her death, in 1742, she left the reversion of her inherited estates to Pulteney in the event that her son died without lawful issue. John Newport was a lunatic but lived in Chelsea until his death, in 1783, whereupon Pulteney's heirs inherited the property. After Ann Smyth's death Pulteney was a supporter of the successful bill to prevent the marriage of lunatics, which thereby safeguarded his family's future inheritance. Such stories gave credence to Pulteney's reputation for being fascinated by money, which was characterized by Chesterfield: &#145;his breast was the seat of all those passions which degrade our nature&#146; and &#145;avarice, the meanest of them all, generally triumphed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works</span>, 25).<br>
<br>In November 1734 Pulteney had suffered another political blow, with the retirement of his main ally at court, Henrietta Howard, countess of Suffolk, who had been groom of the stole to the queen. Exhausted and depressed, Pulteney was absent from the parliamentary session of 1735, spending most of the time in the Netherlands attempting to recover his zest for politics. New opportunities for the opposition arose when Pulteney began to exploit the reversionary interest to the throne centred on Frederick, prince of Wales, who was on bad terms with his father. In this, however, he faced stiff opposition from the young &#145;patriots&#146; grouped around Richard Temple, first Viscount Cobham, and distrust between these elements of the opposition constantly bedevilled their attempts to dislodge Walpole from power. Following the marriage of Prince Frederick, on 29 April 1736 Pulteney moved an address of congratulation in the Commons. On 22 February 1737 he moved the Commons for an address to settle &pound;100,000 out of the civil list on Prince Frederick, backing it up with a host of precedents, but it failed to win much support from the tories and was defeated. However, Pulteney did not support the prince in his quarrel with the king that led to his expulsion from St James's in September 1737.<br>
<br>Pulteney returned to the fray with renewed vigour in 1738 in support of British merchant interests in their dispute with Spain. He exploited the affair of Captain Robert Jenkins's ear, which led to clamours for war with Spain, beginning in October of the following year. In February 1739 Cobham was again worrying that Pulteney and Carteret were working &#145;to get the Prince of Wales into their hands, by which they might make a property out of him&#146;  (Gerrard, 43). The opposition again found itself in disarray when they decided to secede from the Commons <i>en bloc</i> following the debate of 9 March 1739 on the convention of Pardo. When the new parliamentary session opened on 15 November 1739 Pulteney gave his full support to the war effort, in effect reminding the tories that he was an indispensable part of the opposition. However, on 21 November he moved for an address in which the king was not to enter into negotiations with Spain unless the rights of British ships in the American seas were recognized. On 21 February 1740 Pulteney signalled an attack on Walpole by asking for the papers relating to the convention of Pardo to be presented to the Commons, preparatory to an investigation that he hoped would launch impeachment proceedings, as had occurred in 1715. The government's conduct of the war saw a rise in support for the opposition and a rise in Pulteney's popularity. In January 1741 Walpole sent a perceptive missive to George II on the need to destroy Pulteney's popularity by inviting him to court and persuading him to accept a peerage as a mark of royal appreciation, for then &#145;the bee will have lost his sting, and become an idle drone, whose buzzing nobody heeds&#146;  (Graves and Cronin, 27). Pulteney supported Samuel Sandys's motion on 13 February 1741 for an address to the crown for the removal of Walpole from office. However, Pulteney was determined to be seen as supportive of the war effort, approving of the address of 8 April 1741 that provided a vote of credit to allow British obligations to be fulfilled towards Austria. At the fiercely contested general election of May 1741 Pulteney again secured election for Middlesex, but two Walpolian whigs captured Hedon, although they were later unseated on petition, for bribery. The general election was followed by an extensive progress by Pulteney from July to October in England and Wales aiming at a united opposition in the new parliament. In September Lord Chesterfield bemoaned Pulteney's preference for a negotiated entry into power and peculiar power as a party politician: Pulteney &#145;has a personal influence over many, and an interested influence over more. The silly, half-witted, zealous Whigs consider him as the only support of Whiggism, and look upon us as running headlong into Bolingbroke and the Tories&#146;  (Owen, 17).<br>
<br>Walpole's parliamentary majority in the new house was now precarious, and Pulteney pressed home his advantage by moving for a secret committee on the proceedings surrounding the convention of Pardo, which suggested that the war with Spain was being mismanaged and which the ministry defeated by only three votes, on 21 January 1742. During this debate Pulteney &#145;declared very explicitly and peremptorily, that he never would accept of any share in any administration but would always employ his influence in parliament to support the present royal family and constitution&#146;  (<span class="italic">Tory and Whig</span>, 175). The defeat of the government on an election petition for Chippenham, on 2 February 1742, heralding as it did the ministry's imminent loss of control of the lower house, saw parliament adjourned on 3 February to facilitate a change of ministry. Walpole accepted a peerage on 6 February 1742.<h2>
<a name="Officeagain"></a>Office again</h2>Even before Walpole's resignation pressure had been building up on Pulteney regarding the future composition of the ministry. A particularly heated meeting took place at the Fountain tavern on 12 February 1742, in which Pulteney faced severe questioning as to his negotiating stance with John Campbell, second duke of Argyll, arguing for a &#145;broad-bottom&#146; administration. With Walpole out of office George II instructed Newcastle and Philip Yorke, first Baron Hardwicke, lord chancellor, to invite Pulteney to form an administration, with the condition that Walpole be shielded from any inquiry into his conduct. Pulteney declined at first, in order to have the condition removed, and then, on accepting, declined major office in favour of a seat in the cabinet and readmission to the privy council, which was effected on 20 February 1742. Pulteney also played a key role in reconciling Prince Frederick to the new administration, acting as a messenger between the opposition assembled at Carlton House and the ministers meeting at Lord Wilmington's. Having played the patriot country whig for so long Pulteney no doubt feared an adverse reaction should he take a position at the head of the Treasury. Instead Pulteney put his long-term ally Lord Carteret forward for that post, but the king declined to follow his suggestion and made Spencer Compton, earl of Wilmington, first lord. Pulteney's absence from court and the Commons following the death of his fourteen-year-old daughter, Anne, in March 1742 further weakened his influence in the new ministry, packed as it was with colleagues of Walpole. When he returned to the Commons he supported, on 23 March 1742, the establishment of a committee of inquiry into the last ten years of the Walpole administration (a motion for a twenty-year inquiry having been lost in his absence) but refused to serve on it and spoke little thereafter in the chamber. He successfully opposed the repeal of the <span class="roman">Septennial Act</span> on 31 March, a long-time objective of the opposition, and on 15 April he introduced a limited place bill, dismissed by one tory as &#145;a sham bill and of no use&#146;  (<span class="italic">Tory and Whig</span>, 58), which was the only reform measure to pass into law.<br>
<br>On 13 July 1742 Pulteney was created earl of Bath. According to Chesterfield his acceptance was a deliberate act and not an error of judgement, as some have suggested. Nevertheless it did unleash a torrent of hostile commentaries and satire, as, far from heralding a new dawn in which political reform would be achieved and Walpole's corruption punished, the ex-minister went unpunished and the new Lord Bath looked on benignly from the Lords. In particular the anonymous cartoon and vindictive writings of Sir Charles Hanbury Williams did more damage to Bath's reputation than twenty years of <span class="italic">The Craftsman</span> had done to his enemies. Bath revealed his anger and distress in letters to his close friend Zachary Pearce, dean of Westminster, and he became enraged when the pamphlet justifying his position&#151;<span class="italic">Faction Detected</span>, now believed to have been written by John Perceval, first earl of Egmont&#151;was falsely attributed to Bath himself by Hanbury Williams. Nevertheless Pulteney's defence, that he was pushed into a deal with the old corps whigs because patriot politicians like George Lyttelton, William Pitt, and the Grenvilles had entered into negotiations before Walpole had resigned, appears to have had some basis in fact. This was little consolation for what Thomas Birch described as &#145;the abuse of my Lord of Bath both in prose and verse fills our daily as well as our weekly papers&#146;  (Harris, <span class="italic">Patriot Press</span>, 60).<br>
<br>Bath spoke infrequently in the Lords, but the death of Wilmington, on 2 July 1743, saw him make an attempt to become head of the Treasury. He sent a message to Lord Carteret, who was in Hanau with George II, but despite Carteret's support the king preferred the Pelhams, and Bath seems to have acquiesced in the decision. He served as a lord justice in 1743 and 1745, and on 15 November 1744 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. When George II attempted to escape from the domination of his government by the Pelhams he turned to Bath, who accepted the Treasury, received the seals of office, and kissed hands on 10 February 1746. Such was the parliamentary strength of the Pelhams that within two days Bath had relinquished the seals on finding insufficient support to carry an administration. The anonymous satirist of the <span class="italic">History of the Long Administration</span> referred to him as, &#145;the minister having to the astonishment of all wise men, never transacted one rash thing, and what is more marvellous, left as much money in the Treasury as he found in it&#146;  (Speck, 248). He now left the cabinet. In November 1746 his brother-in-law Samuel Gumley was returned in a by-election for Hedon, but he was unseated on petition in February 1747 because it was said that the ministers &#145;wanted to show the king that Lord Bath had not the interest he boasted&#146; of in the House of Commons  (Sedgwick, &#145;Introductory survey&#146;, 1.358).<h2>
<a name="Decliningyears"></a>Declining years</h2>Bath continued to attend the Lords, although with declining vigour in debate, which he explained as a desire not to rock the boat. His most important contribution probably lay behind the scenes as an adviser to John Stuart, third earl of Bute, and the Leicester House court of the young Prince George. Bath's wife died on 14 September 1758, apparently leaving her estate to her husband. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, commenting on the recent demise of both Lady Bath and Lady Burlington, thought that &#145;they have long been burdens (not to say nuisances) on the face of the earth&#146;  (Jenkins, 165) and Horace Walpole pictured the two countesses making &#145;such an uproar that &hellip; St. Peter himself turned the key [of the gates of heaven] and hid himself&#146;  (ibid.). In his widowhood Bath spent much time in the company of such bluestockings as Elizabeth Carter (1717&#150;1806), daughter of the Revd Nicholas Carter, and Elizabeth Montagu (1720&#150;1780), wife of Edward Montagu. He continued to travel with such respectable and cultured women, including a trip to Spa, in the Austrian Netherlands, and the Rhine in June&#150;September 1763, when he was described as being the life and soul of a party of very fashionable people. Bath made his last recorded speech in the Lords in 1760. Following the accession of George III he was made lord lieutenant of Shropshire on 13 March 1761. His son and heir, William, Viscount Pulteney, a soldier and MP, predeceased him, having died of an infectious enteritis while returning from a campaign in Spain in 1763.<br>
<br>Bath died at Bath House, Piccadilly, at 10 p.m. on 7 July 1764, following the effects of a chill. His body was taken in grand procession from Bath House to Westminster Abbey, where it lay in the Jerusalem Chamber before being buried on the night of 17 July in the Islip Chapel, in the north aisle. The remains of his immediate family had already been removed from St Martin-in-the-Fields to be interred with Viscount Pulteney under a slab of blue stone finely cut with the family arms. Public rioting attended the funeral, resulting in damage to neighbouring tombs. Later Bath's brother caused to be erected close by a substantial monument designed by Joseph Wilton.<br>
<br>It is difficult to be sure of Hanbury Williams's statement that written on the door of Bath House was an epitaph, &#145;Here, dead to fame, lives patriot Will; his grave a lordly seat; his title proves his Epitaph; his robes his winding sheet&#146;  (Wheatley, 30). Horace Walpole wrote that &#145;grass grows before my Lord Bath's door who nobody will visit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 16). Such venomous shafts may have reflected Pulteney's lack of political friends in later years or the fact that the domestic arrangements were poor in Bath House, then occupied by two elderly gentlemen. Such friends as Pulteney did have at the end he largely offended by the terms of his will, in which he made no provision for those in financial difficulties and made only very modest gifts to those most close, such as the jewellery he left to Elizabeth Montagu.<br>
<br>The London estate of the Pulteneys was entailed in the absence of issue on his brother, General Harry Pulteney (1686&#150;1767). Bath left the remainder of his landed and personal estate to his brother as well. This consisted of his estates at Bathwick and Wrington, Burrington and Ubley, in Somerset, and the reversion of the Bradford&#150;Newport property in Shropshire, Monmouthshire, Staffordshire, and Northamptonshire. His personal estate in the form of cash and investments was estimated variously at between &pound;600,000 and &pound;1.2 million at the time. He was certainly one of the richest men in Britain at his death, so far as disposable capital was concerned. The fortune remained intact by inheritance until the death of his kinswoman Henrietta Laura Pulteney, <i>suo jure</i> countess of Bath, in 1808, when it was dispersed for lack of Pulteney heirs.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Bath ordered the destruction of his personal papers after his death, which denied posterity a full text of his speeches, but they are often described as brilliant both in reasoning and in wit and playing heavily upon members' emotions. Contemporaneous transcripts of some of them, particularly about the time of Walpole's fall, show them to be of great length, and for years Bath was by far the most frequent speaker in parliament. His resort to vulgarity was an unattractive weakness that manifestly represents a character flaw. He was clearly hurt by unfounded attacks on him in the press, but was unwavering in his support of its freedom&#151;in a letter to Zachary Pearce he wrote: &#145;all our liberties depend on preserving the liberties of the press&#146;  (Zachery Pearce papers).<br>
<br>Pulteney's personal relationships were soured from time to time and he seems to have had only a handful of long-term friendships. The rift with Lord Hervey exemplifies his loss of good friends through his lack of self-control in matters relating to his parliamentary struggles. Hervey's desertion to Walpole was punished by Pulteney with public humiliation in outrageous personal terms, impugning Hervey's sexual habits and laying him open to prosecution for libel.<br>
<br>In contrast letters to Zachary Pearce show Pulteney as a tender, caring man capable of sustaining a long and successful marriage undoubtedly founded on love and a deep respect for his wife, the end of which caused him deep distress (his first letter on her death being penned to Pearce). Despite the relish with which Horace Walpole reported on family disagreements Pulteney's concern for his children is apparent, although they seemed to have lived in some awe of him. His refusal to countenance the marriage of his son to Frances Catherine, daughter and heir of Sir Charles Gunther Nichol, reputedly because of arguments about marriage settlements, caused some estrangement with his son and ultimately left Pulteney with no direct heirs, and hence somewhat isolated in later life as his political friends died or drifted away. His only close relative, his brother Harry, latterly lived with him at Bath House.<br>
<br>Pulteney was, however, an intensely sociable man given to enjoying being at centre stage. In his early days he raked around London with Swift, Gay, and other literary friends. Later accounts survive of some grand entertainments at Bath House when his fine collection of plate, recorded in an inventory on his brother's death, was clearly a source of great pride. He was not a collector of pictures on the scale of some of his contemporaries but, to judge by the quality of those surviving at Raby Castle, the seat of Lord Barnard, whose family ultimately inherited many of the Pulteney heirlooms, he was well advised in his modest purchases. Pulteney's library was of a significant scale but was broken up at auction in 1811. He particularly treasured two volumes of Cicero's works given to him by Pearce, which appear in the portrait of Bath now at Yale University.<br>
<br>Pulteney sat for portraits on at least seven occasions&#151;always in formal pose, increasingly overweight, and latterly appearing somewhat unapproachable and disgruntled, leaning heavily on his walking-stick, which he needed because of increasing lameness following a fall. On one occasion he returned to Reynolds's studio, after sitting for the portrait given to Mrs Montagu, to have him &#145;mend my sickly looks&#146;, although Mrs Montagu does say that the artist had captured the great intensity of Pulteney's dark brown eyes  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 28).<br>
<br>Pulteney was also a man of broad interests. He was a director of the Royal Academy of Music and a patron of his wife's nephew George Colman in promoting that playwright's first works in the early 1760s. His interest in the designs for his own London residence was matched by his role in chairing the committee for designing the new London Bridge. Philanthropic gestures included donating funds for the construction of a hospital at Bath, which now houses the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases, and the provision of a market cross at Hedon. The latter was of course his original parliamentary constituency, making the point that above all Pulteney was a political figure.<br>
