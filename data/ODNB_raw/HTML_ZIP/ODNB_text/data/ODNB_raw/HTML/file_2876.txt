<span class="headword">Booth, Sir  Felix</span>, first baronet  (1775&#150;1850), <span class="occ">distiller and promoter of Arctic exploration</span>, was the youngest son of Philip Booth, a distiller of 55 Turnmill Street, Clerkenwell, London, and his wife, Elizabeth Wallis, who had in all three sons and three daughters. Felix was the most energetic and able of his family, many of whom were distillers and wine merchants in London. When he entered the business he rebuilt the existing Clerkenwell distillery, built a second at Brentford, and took over other brewing and distilling concerns. Eventually he became the owner of the biggest distilling business in England, making principally gin, but also cognac, at his Regent's Park distillery. He used his considerable wealth to enter other businesses, such as gas lighting and banking.<br>
<br>Booth became interested in polar exploration, particularly the search for the north-west passage, and was a close friend of the explorer John Ross. Ross was unable to get official support to search for the north-west passage after the controversy and ill feeling which attended his earlier expedition and alleged discovery of mountains which were found to have been a mirage. He turned for financial backing to Booth, who initially declined to help, fearing that he would be thought to have been motivated by the government reward offered for the discovery of the passage. In 1828, however, the government offer was withdrawn and Booth, on condition of secrecy, provided &pound;17,000, which largely financed Ross's expedition in the <i>Victory</i> (1829&#150;33). During the four years the ship was away Booth anonymously sent weekly allowances to the sailors' wives. Ross's party finally returned to great acclaim. The north-west passage remained undiscovered, but they had surveyed very considerable areas and discovered the magnetic pole. Ross immortalized Booth in many land and sea features, such as the Gulf of Boothia, Felix Harbour, and Cape Felix. Sheriff's Harbour commemorated Booth's election in 1828 as sheriff of London and Middlesex, and other place names commemorated his sisters and his country houses. Booth's involvement in the voyage was made public, and he was rewarded with election to the fellowship of the Royal Society and on 27 March 1835 with a baronetcy.<br>
<br>In 1850 Booth helped finance John Ross's last voyage, when in the <i>Felix</i> he went unsuccessfully in search of Franklin. On 25 January the same year Booth died very suddenly, probably of a heart attack, at the Royal York Hotel, Brighton, Sussex. He was buried in the family vault at the church in Stanstead Abbots, Hertfordshire. As he was unmarried and childless his title passed to his nephew J. Williamson Booth. The title is now extinct. Booth's gin is still widely drunk, but the company is no longer in family ownership.<br>
