<span class="headword">Clayton, Sir  Gilbert Falkingham</span>  (1875&#150;1929), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial administrator</span>, was born on 6 July 1875 at Ryde, Isle of Wight, the eldest son of Lieutenant-Colonel William Lewis Nicholl Clayton of Sandown, and his wife, Maria Martha Pilkington. Having been educated at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, Clayton received his commission in the Royal Artillery in 1895. He served under Kitchener in the Sudan campaign of 1898, was present at the battles of the Atbara and Omdurman, and received British and Egyptian decorations. In 1900 he joined the Egyptian army, which by then had occupied the Sudan, and in 1901 he was promoted captain. In 1902&#150;3 he was district commissioner at Wau in the Bahr al-Ghazal, and from 1903 to 1908 he served as deputy assistant adjutant-general at headquarters in Cairo. He returned to Khartoum in 1908 as private secretary to the <i>sirdar</i> (commander-in-chief) and governor-general of Sudan, Sir Reginald Wingate, in which capacity he accompanied Wingate on a mission to Somaliland in 1909. In 1910 he retired from the army and transferred permanently to the Sudan government. Having won Wingate's confidence, he was promoted in 1913 to the sensitive dual position of director of intelligence and Sudan agent in Cairo. On 18 September 1912 he married Enid Caroline (<i>b</i>. 1885/6), second daughter of Frank Napier Thorowgood, civil engineer. They had five children.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the First World War, Clayton returned to active service. In addition to his other duties he now assumed the role of director of military intelligence at British headquarters. Thus at the nexus of Anglo-Egyptian and allied military and political intelligence, Clayton was the logical choice to head the new Arab bureau and assist in co-ordinating the complex diplomatic and military aspects of the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Turks. In 1917 Clayton was promoted brigadier-general and became chief political officer of the Egyptian expeditionary force that began the invasion of Palestine, where he served as military governor.<br>
<br>Clayton returned to Cairo in 1919 as adviser to the Egyptian ministry of the interior. With the end of the war, Egyptian nationalist aspirations had burst to the surface, and the importance of Clayton's sensitive position was increased during the long months of Anglo-Egyptian negotiations and political disturbances in Egypt that ensued. Like other prominent soldier-administrators on the scene, most notably Field Marshal Allenby (then high commissioner in Egypt), Clayton came to recognize the need to abolish the British protectorate. This view eventually won the day, and when the British declared Egyptian independence in 1922 Clayton's position became anomalous and he resigned.<br>
<br>Thereafter Clayton was employed in Palestine as chief secretary and acting high commissioner from 1922 to 1925, in which capacity he assisted in negotiating a treaty between Britain and Transjordan (1922&#150;3). He was next commissioned to settle frontier disputes between Arabia and its neighbours Iraq and Transjordan. Negotiations at Kuwait (1924) having failed, Clayton concluded at Jiddah the Bahra and Hadda agreements (1925) with &#145;Abd al-&#145;Aziz ibn Sa&#145;ud, the ruler of Najd and Hejaz. In 1926 at San&#145;a&#146; he orchestrated discussions between Yahya ibn Muhammad Hamid al-Din, the imam of the Yemen, and the Aden protectorate, a negotiation that ended in failure. But negotiations with Ibn Sa&#145;ud resulted in the treaty of Jiddah (1927), which finally settled outstanding differences between Britain and Hejaz. Following his settlement of two minor issues in Arabia in the following year, he was made high commissioner and commander-in-chief in Iraq in 1929. He had barely taken up that appointment when he died from a heart attack at Baghdad on 11 September 1929, while playing polo.<br>
<br>Clayton's premature death cut short a distinguished career of great promise. In the multilateral and multifaceted arena of Near-Eastern politics Clayton, a skilled Arabist, succeeded through tact, loyalty, keen observation, and deft management of information and personalities. His years of administrative experience in the Sudan served him well in Cairo; his personal qualities and wartime experience made him an ideal emissary in Arabia. While colleagues and subordinates such as T. E. Lawrence achieved worldwide fame, the confidential nature of Clayton's successive offices necessarily obscured the importance of his achievements which have only recently attracted more attention from historians. Clayton was created CMG (1915), CB (1917), KBE (1919), and KCMG (1926), and held many foreign decorations and honours.<br>
