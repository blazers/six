<span class="headword">Lancey,  Oliver  De</span>  (<em>c.</em>1749&#150;1822), <span class="occ">army officer and politician in America</span>, was born in New York, the son of General Oliver De Lancey (1718&#150;1785), an army officer who fought against the revolutionaries during the American War of Independence, and Phila Franks, daughter of Jacob and Abigail Franks of New York. His father's brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68534/', "James DeLancey")</script>, the celebrated New York lawyer, who was chief justice of that colony between 1733 and 1760 and lieutenant-governor from 1753 to 1760. De Lancey's father and uncle were sons of Etienne De Lancey, a wealthy Huguenot of Caen in Normandy, who had emigrated to America following the revocation of the edict of Nantes (1685), and bought large estates in New York, where the brothers ranked among the colony's wealthiest and most powerful citizens.<br>
<br>Oliver De Lancey was educated in England and entered the British army as a cornet in the 14th dragoons on 1 October 1766. He was promoted to lieutenant on 12 December 1770 and to captain into the 17th dragoons on 16 May 1773. When the American War of Independence broke out in 1775 he was at once dispatched to New York to make arrangements for the accommodation and remounting of his own regiment. In the following year his father raised, equipped at his own expense, and commanded three battalions of American loyalists. De Lancey meanwhile accompanied his regiment to Nova Scotia and to Staten Island in June 1775. He participated in the expedition to Long Island, where he commanded the cavalry outposts in the action of 28 August, in which the American General Woodhull surrendered to him, but was unfortunately murdered by De Lancey's soldiers. At the battle of Brooklyn he commanded the advance of the right column of the British army under Sir Henry Clinton and Sir William Erskine, served at the capture of New York and the battle of White Plains, and was promoted major in his regiment on 3 July 1778. With this rank he covered the retreat of Knyphausen's column in Clinton's retreat from Philadelphia, was present at the battle of Monmouth court house, and was in temporary command of the 17th dragoons. He also commanded the outposts in front of the New York lines from mid-1778 to the end of 1779. De Lancey was then appointed as deputy quartermaster-general to the force sent to South Carolina, and after serving at the capture of Charles Town he became aide-de-camp to Lord Cornwallis, and eventually succeeded Major Andr&eacute; as adjutant-general to the army at New York.<br>
<br>On 3 October 1781 De Lancey was promoted lieutenant-colonel of the 17th dragoons, and he retired to England with his father at the end of the war. The king appointed De Lancey, on Lord Sydney's recommendation, to settle the military claims of the American loyalists, and as head of a commission to settle all the army accounts connected with the war. On 18 November 1790 he was promoted colonel and made deputy adjutant-general at the Horse Guards. In 1792 he became superintendent-general of barracks and in 1794 received the post of barrack-master-general, with an income of &pound;1500 a year. On 20 May of the following year George III appointed him colonel of the 17th dragoons. In September 1796 he entered parliament as MP for Maidstone, a seat which he held until June 1802.<br>
<br>De Lancey was promoted lieutenant-general on 1 January 1801, but in November 1804 the commissioners of military inquiry found serious mistakes in his barrack accounts. He was removed from his post as barrack-master-general, but in spite of the violent attacks of the political opposition, headed by John Calcraft, he was not prosecuted, and was treated rather as having been culpably careless than actually fraudulent. He did not contest his seat in 1802, and in 1806 his property of Effingham Hill in Surrey was seized to meet his liabilities. He remained a member of the consolidated board of general officers, however, and was promoted general on 1 January 1812. He eventually retired to Edinburgh, where he died on 3 September 1822. He was survived by his only son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7437/', "Oliver De Lancey (1803&#150;1837)")</script>, army officer.<br>
