<span class="headword">Blew,  William John</span>  (1808&#150;1894), <span class="occ">liturgical scholar and hymn writer</span>, the only son of William Blew of St James's, Westminster, was born in that parish on 13 April 1808, and educated with John Henry Newman at St Nicholas's School, Ealing, and at Oxford, where he matriculated from Wadham College in October 1825. He was elected Goodridge exhibitioner of Wadham in 1826, graduating BA on 13 May 1830 and MA on 13 June 1832. He was curate of Nuthurst, Sussex, from 1832 to 1840, being ordained deacon in 1832 and priest in 1834 by the bishop of Chichester. From 1840 to 1842 he was curate of St Anne's, Soho, and in 1842 became incumbent of St John's, Milton, near Gravesend, where he was free to give a Tractarian tone to the services. In 1850, owing to a difference with his bishop, George Murray (a critic of the Tractarians), he retired from active clerical work and devoted himself mainly to liturgical and theological studies. He had married after his father's death in 1845, and lived at his father's house, 6 Warwick Street, London, where he died on 27 December 1894.<br>
<br>Blew was a scholar of some repute. He published translations of the <span class="italic">Iliad</span> in 1831, Aeschylus's <span class="italic">Agamemnon</span> in 1855, and Euripides' <span class="italic">Medea</span> in English verse in 1887. He also edited two plays under the title <span class="italic">Queen Mary</span> (1876): <span class="italic">The Famous History of Sir Thomas Wyat</span> by Dekker and Webster and <span class="italic">If you Know not me, you Know Nobody, or, The Troubles of Queen Elizabeth</span> by Thomas Heywood. But his chief interest lay in ecclesiology, and probably his most solid work was his edition of the <span class="italic">Aberdeen Breviary</span> for the Bannatyne Club in 1854. In 1852 he published, with his friend Henry John Gauntlett, <span class="italic">The Church Hymn and Tune Book</span>, which reached a second edition in 1855. The hymns, which are chiefly translations from the Latin by Blew, &#145;are terse, vigorous, musical, and of great merit&#146;  (Julian). The volume also contains several original hymns by Blew. This was followed by <span class="italic">Hymns and Hymn Books</span> (1858) and in 1877 by an edition of the 1548 <span class="italic">Altar Service of the Church of England</span>.<br>
