<span class="headword">Williams,  Gareth Wyn</span>, Baron Williams of Mostyn  (1941&#150;2003), <span class="occ">barrister and politician</span>, was born on 5 February 1941 in a taxi travelling from Mostyn to Prestatyn, Flintshire (the birth was recorded at Hawarden House, Prestatyn), the son of Albert Thomas Williams (<i>d</i>. 1964), schoolmaster, of Mostyn, and his wife, Selina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Evans (<i>d</i>. 1985). The family spoke Welsh at home&#151;his father later started the first Welsh-speaking state school&#151;and Williams learned English with the aid of Linguaphone records. From Rhyl grammar school he won a scholarship to Queens' College, Cambridge, to read history. After switching to law he won the university prize in jurisprudence in 1962, and graduated two years later with a first in the LLB. He then returned to north Wales to work as a schoolteacher for a year, in order to pay for his further legal education. In 1965 he was called to the bar at Gray's Inn. On 11 August 1962, while still a student at Cambridge, he had married Pauline Clarke, a 23-year-old teacher, and daughter of Ernest Clarke, cabinet maker. They had two daughters, Martha and Emma, and a son, Daniel.<br>
<br>After qualifying as a barrister Williams returned to Wales where, based in Swansea, he built up a busy practice on the Wales and Chester circuit, and earned a reputation as a quick-witted and eloquent advocate, adept at winning over juries. In 1978 he took silk, moved to London (joining Farrar's Building in the Temple, eventually becoming head of chambers), and became a recorder. The following year he achieved national prominence through his defence of George Deakin, a businessman from south Wales who was one of those accused with the Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe of conspiracy to murder the male model Norman Scott. His defence of Deakin&#151;who admitted a conspiracy to frighten but not to murder Scott&#151;was widely regarded as one of the most effective in what the newspapers of the time invariably described as the &#145;trial of the century&#146;. Though he continued to appear in criminal trials he increasingly specialized in defamation cases, acting for both plaintiffs and defendants, and frequently appeared opposite George Carman, who had also made his name in the Thorpe trial; the contrast between Carman's ruthless cross-examination of witnesses and Williams's emollient but no less effective style was frequently noted. Both enjoyed their share of successes; Williams's appearance for the footballer Graeme Souness in his libel case against <span class="italic">The People</span> (which had accused him of mistreating his former wife) in 1995 was a particularly notable victory for Williams over Carman. Williams's other clients included Viscount Linley, Diana, princess of Wales, and the American singer Michael Jackson. From 1987 to 1989 he was leader of the Wales and Chester circuit, and in 1992 he became chairman of the Bar Council (having been a member since 1986). This latter position gave him a platform from which to promulgate his views on the legal system, which included calling for an overhaul of the judicial appointments system and for the retirement of judges at sixty-five. Although better than almost all of his contemporaries in understanding court, and reading how the judge or the jury would react, Williams had profoundly radical views on the law.<br>
<br>A lifelong Labour supporter, he was made a life peer, as Baron Williams of Mostyn, in 1992, on the recommendation of the outgoing Labour leader, Neil Kinnock. In opposition until 1997, he served as party spokesman in the House of Lords first on Northern Ireland (in whose problems he took a particular interest) and then on home and legal affairs, developing a close and mutually respectful relationship with the party's chief spokesman on home affairs, Jack Straw. Meanwhile, his first marriage having ended in divorce, on 19 August 1994 he married Veena Maya Russell, a 41-year-old divorcee and fellow barrister, originally from Durban, South Africa; she was the daughter of Dennis Russell, photographer. They had one daughter, Imogen.<br>
<br>Following Labour's election victory in 1997 Williams was appointed parliamentary under-secretary at the Home Office, with special responsibilities for constitutional issues. He was promoted to minister of state at the Home Office in 1998, simultaneously becoming deputy leader of the House of Lords. The Home Office minister in the Lords had the heaviest workload of legislation of all Lords ministers. He had to deal with the policy issues in which the Lords took the greatest interest, and had the most profound disagreements with the government. In Williams's two years in this position his dominance as a parliamentary performer became apparent, and in an impressive front bench team he emerged as among the very ablest. As Home Office minister he persuaded a reluctant Lords to reduce the age of consent in homosexual relations to eighteen, secured passage of the <span class="roman">Crime and Disorder Act</span>, and, as minister with responsibility for prisons, struck up a hugely effective relationship with Martin Narey, the director-general of the prison service, working in particular for better education and rehabilitation in prisons.<br>
<br>In 1999, on the retirement of John Morris, Williams became attorney-general. He was the best advocate to hold this office in a generation. He appeared in court much more often than his predecessors, in particular opening the public inquiries into the sinking of the bulk carrier <i>Derbyshire</i> and the Thames pleasure boat <i>Marchioness</i>. He had the trust of the legal profession, and was steadfast in private in ensuring compliance by the government with the rule of law, particularly in the context of the peace process in Northern Ireland. His standing both within the government and outside meant his views on these issues prevailed. He continued throughout his period in successive ministerial jobs with his close connection with Northern Ireland. As attorney-general he provided powerful leadership for the independent prosecution service there. He was also an effective leader of the crown prosecution service. Those in the service knew they had one of the best advocates as their leader. They willingly followed when he initiated a series of reforms, designed to take them from the doldrums into which they had sunk, towards an effective prosecuting agency, respected by the other parts of the criminal justice system. He procured favourable public expenditure settlements with the Treasury, which allowed them to be better resourced. For the first time in many years the service was given confidence it could succeed.<br>
<br>Following Labour's second electoral victory, in 2001, Williams was the obvious candidate to succeed Baroness Jay as leader of the House of Lords. His years as attorney-general had increased his already high authority in the Lords. He became lord privy seal at the same time as leader of the House of Lords. He was highly respected right across the house, from the outset. He introduced a series of procedural changes to Lords business that perhaps no other peer could have persuaded the house to agree to. As the opposition to the government became much more organized after 2001 he proved a master of ensuring both that the government got all its legislative business through, and that relations across the house remained good. He proved an adept business manager for the government, and an effective leader for the whole house. The house, while aware of his radicalism, and indeed aware of his frustration with many of the practices of the house, nevertheless trusted him to look after their interests in a non-partisan way.<br>
<br>Williams had long been interested in constitutional reform. He wanted an elected House of Lords, an independent judicial appointments commission, a supreme court, and a department of justice. In June 2003 the second and third of these items became government policy. The first and last got lost. He was pleased about the reforms adopted, though dismayed by the loss of the other two. In a highly charged atmosphere his charm, quick wit, and devastating logic proved critical in helping the government through the fall-out from these abrupt changes in policy. He never disguised his support for an elected second chamber nor his disappointment when it was rejected. His radicalism was not confined to reform of the House of Lords and the judiciary: he was, for instance, prominent in calling for the disestablishment of the Church of England, the strengthening of parliamentary watchdogs, and the removal of legal obstacles to positive action to bring about a greater representation of women in parliament.<br>
<br>A voracious reader, Williams was also knowledgeable on art, including modern art. He disliked sport, &#145;apart from the bloodsport of litigation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 22 Sept 2003). He retained strong links with his native Wales, as pro-chancellor of the University of Wales, president of the Welsh College of Music and Drama, a fellow of the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, and an honorary professor at the University College of North Wales. A keen interest in children's welfare made him an active trustee of the NSPCC. He was also a member of council of Justice (1993&#150;7) and president of the Prisoners' Advice Service (1992&#150;7).<br>
<br>Williams was one of the most successful members of the Labour cabinet, both as a parliamentarian and as an effective reformer. He died suddenly of a heart attack at his home, Poplars Farmhouse, Evenlode, near Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, on 20 September 2003, while still leader of the House of Lords. He was survived by his wife, Veena, and his four children. It was obvious to all that his death had robbed the government not just of one of its keenest intellects, but also of one of its wisest counsel.<br>
<br>Gareth Williams held well-thought-out views with great strength. He was a committed reformer. He was a man of great personal integrity. He was supremely able. He lacked personal vanity. He wanted to change the institutions of which he had been so successful a member. But he never lost the support of the two institutions where he achieved pre-eminence&#151;the Lords and the bar.<br>
