<span class="headword">Gorman,  William Moore <span class="st"> [Terence]</span></span>  (1923&#150;2003), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born at Letterkeen, near Enniskillen, co. Fermanagh, on 17 June 1923, the son of Richard Gorman (<i>d</i>. 1927), a veterinary surgeon practising in Lusaka, Northern Rhodesia, and his wife, Sarah Crawford, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Moore (<i>d</i>. 1963). He spent some of his early childhood in southern Africa, and it was his African nursemaid who named him Terence, a name that stuck. After his father's death he returned with his mother to Northern Ireland. He was educated at Mount Temple School, Rathgar, Dublin, and Foyle College, Londonderry, and went to Trinity College, Dublin, in 1941. From 1943 to 1946 he served as a radio mechanic in the Fleet Air Arm. He graduated from Trinity in 1948 in economics and in 1949 in mathematics. While at Trinity he met his future wife, Dorinda Maud (Din) Scott, daughter of Walter Thomas Scott, civil servant. They married in Dublin on 29 December 1950. The previous year Gorman had been appointed an assistant lecturer in econometrics and social statistics in the commerce faculty at the University of Birmingham. He was promoted lecturer in 1951 and senior lecturer in 1957 before going on to hold chairs in economics at Oxford (1962&#150;7) and at the London School of Economics (1967&#150;79). He then returned, as an official fellow, to Nuffield College, Oxford, where he remained until he retired in 1990.<br>
<br>Gorman was one of the foremost creators of the new field of consumer economics. He made at least four important contributions to the way economists thought about consumer decision-making. His interest in consumer behaviour seems to have begun with his undergraduate thesis at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1948, on the demand for tomatoes. Subsequently he realized that the huge range of products available meant that systematic analysis of consumer behaviour would be swamped in detail and no broad concepts would be recoverable. So the &#145;characteristics approach&#146; to consumer behaviour was born.<br>
<br>In the late 1950s, while teaching at the University of Birmingham, Gorman undertook an exchange with agricultural researchers in Iowa. In his research on quality differentials in the egg market he developed his method of looking at commodities in terms of a relatively small number of underlying characteristics. For example a food product may be thought of in terms of nutrition, colour, and so on. He realized that if utility depended just on these characteristics this theory could explain why consumers bought only a limited set of commodities. It could explain the demand for new goods, now thought of as a new bundle of the same underlying characteristics. This idea became a mainstay of consumer theory, used extensively in industrial economics.<br>
<br>In the 1960s Gorman also developed the idea of &#145;two-stage budgeting&#146; to simplify consumer decision-making. He asked the question: when is it possible to simplify decision-making across broad groups of commodities so that choices in one group can be made with only limited information about choices in others? Two-stage budgeting again became commonplace in the way economists envisaged consumer decisions across a wide range of markets, from fruit and vegetables to assets. As with Gorman's work on characteristics, he developed a new concept to match the decision-making process of consumers, but also to help the analyst to make sense of the market.<br>
<br>Gorman's third contribution to economics was the notion of adult equivalence scales as a method of comparing households. Part of the stock in trade of microeconomic policy analysis was to examine the distributional consequences of policy reforms. For instance, would a proposed tax reform lift more families out of poverty? Would it reduce inequality? The answers required households of different types to be compared. Gorman came up with a way to &#145;equivalize&#146; families of different sizes. His solution was to think of the minimum income required to achieve a level of well-being, then consider the amount that income needs to be shifted to achieve the same level of well-being for another family of a different composition. Gorman noted that because children consume different bundles of goods from adults this adjustment will differ when prices change, and he worked out a consistent way of dealing with this.<br>
<br>Finally, Gorman provided an extensive methodology for linking macro- and micro-relations in economic behaviour. How easy is it to predict the way aggregate non-durable expenditure changes with growth in national income? Gorman showed the conditions under which such a stable aggregate relationship would hold. Indeed, this was some of his first work, published in the 1950s. The conditions he derived turned out to be strong indeed and unlikely to be satisfied, especially in periods of changing distribution.<br>
<br>Gorman was infuriatingly stubborn, yet endearing. Notoriously absent-minded, he never really understood that many people&#151;even trained economists&#151;have difficulty conceptualizing economic phenomena in mathematical terms. In many ways he was the epitome of the ivory-tower academic. Yet he was one of a small number of distinguished twentieth-century academics who changed economics. Wonderfully clever and engaging, he featured on many shortlists for the Nobel prize in economics and was highly influential on the work of many Nobel prizewinners. Although his ideas were adopted in many day-to-day economic analyses, he remained largely unknown to most economists outside academia during his own lifetime. He received honorary doctorates from Southampton and Birmingham universities, the National University of Ireland, and University College, London, where he was a visiting professor (1986&#150;96). He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1978. He was also an honorary fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, and of the London School of Economics; and an honorary foreign member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and of the American Economics Association. In 1972 he served as president of the Econometric Society. His last years were clouded by Alzheimer's disease. He died on 13 January 2003 at the Manor House nursing home, Merton, Oxfordshire, following a heart attack. He was survived by his wife, Din. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
