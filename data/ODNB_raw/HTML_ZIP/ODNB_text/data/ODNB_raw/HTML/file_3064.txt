<span class="headword">Bowlby,  Thomas William</span>  (1817&#150;1860), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, son of Thomas Bowlby, a captain in the Royal Artillery, and his wife, a daughter of General Balfour, was born at Gibraltar. When very young, Bowlby was taken by his parents to Sunderland, where his father became a timber merchant. Bowlby's education was entrusted to Dr Cowan, a Scottish schoolmaster living in Sunderland. After leaving school he trained as a solicitor under his cousin Russell Bowlby of Sunderland. On completion of his time he went to London and spent some years as a salaried clerk in the office of a large firm in the Temple. In 1846 he began practising in the City as junior partner in the firm of Lawrence, Crowdy, and Bowlby. In his early legal career, Bowlby enjoyed a fair practice, but the law proved uncongenial, and through his many literary acquaintances he felt increasingly drawn to a career in writing. Although remaining a member of the firm until 1854, he went to Berlin as special correspondent of <span class="italic">The Times</span> in 1848 to report on the continental revolutions. Bowlby married Frances Marion, daughter of Pulteney Mein and sister of his father's second wife, who inherited a considerable fortune on the death of her father. During the railway mania Bowlby got into financial difficulties, which caused him to leave England for a short time, but he made arrangements for the whole of his future earnings to be applied in liquidation of his debts. On returning to England he was associated for some time with Louis Antoine Jullien (1812&#150;1860), the musical director and composer. He next went to Smyrna, where he was employed in connection with the construction of a railway. In 1860 he was engaged to travel to China as the special correspondent of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Lord Elgin and Baron Gros were fellow passengers in the steamship <i>Malabar</i>, which was lost at Point de Galle on 22 May 1860; his graphic narrative of this shipwreck was considered one of his best pieces of work. His China dispatches were informative and popular with readers of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. After the capture of Tientsin (Tianjin) on 23 August 1860, Bowlby accompanied Admiral Sir James Hope and four others to Tang-chow to arrange the preliminaries of peace. They were captured and imprisoned by the Tartar general, Senggerinchin. Bowlby died on 22 September 1860 at Tang-chow, from the effects of the treatment he received in prison. His body was afterwards surrendered by the Chinese and buried in the Russian cemetery, outside the Anting (Anding) gate of Peking (Beijing), on 17 October 1860; he left a widow and five young children, among them <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32003/', "Sir Anthony Alfred Bowlby, first baronet")</script>.<br>
