<span class="headword">Mallows,  Charles Edward</span>  (1864&#150;1915), <span class="occ">landscape architect</span>, was born at 2 Charles Street, Chelsea, London, on 5 May 1864, the second son of Lucy Barrell (1829/30&#150;1904) and George W. Mallows (1823/4&#150;1892), a master shoemaker from Bedford. His parents married in 1866 and settled at Flatford Mill, East Bergholt, Suffolk, in the household of Mallows's grandmother, also named Lucy Barrell, the widow of a grocer; Mallows's uncle ran the mill. Its Constable associations may have encouraged Mallows's leanings towards drawing and painting.<br>
<br>A student at the Bedford School of Art, Mallows was later articled to the Bedford architect Frank Mercer for three years from 1879. He gained experience working for Henry Hewitt Bridgman in the City of London for a year, then for Salaman and Wornum at 9 Old Bond Street. He attended the Royal Academy Schools. His final apprenticeship was his happiest, at the offices of William Wallace and William Flockhart from 1884 to 1886. He then set up on his own in London, accepting an offer to travel and make measured drawings of English and French cathedrals for publication in the <span class="italic">Century Magazine</span>. These drawings were added to his Academy Schools portfolio, and won him the RIBA Pugin travelling studentship in 1889.<br>
<br>After a breakdown caused by overwork Mallows returned to Bedford; he opened an office there in 1895 with the architect George Grocock, and worked with him in the arts and crafts tradition (much influenced by Richard Norman Shaw) on a variety of commissions, including cottages, schools, shops, and the restoration of churches. In 1900 he was made a fellow of the RIBA; by 1901 Mallows was the diocesan surveyor for Ely, and had designed an opera house for Bedford (though this was never built). He took a student, Frederick Landseer Griggs, whose drawings for him appeared in <span class="italic">The Studio</span>.<br>
<br>Mallows's work on gardens began with John Pyghtle White, who made well-crafted garden furniture, buildings, and ornamentation at the Pyghtle works in Bedford. Mallows was commissioned to draw for the catalogue. In 1898 White moved to Biddenham to King's Corner, a cottage designed by Mallows, who also designed the garden&#151;his first. In this can be seen the beginnings of his delight in the formality of the seventeenth century. Through White, Mallows designed other cottages in Biddenham, including Three Gables for Henry John Peacock, a farmer; and on 19 September 1899 Mallows married Henry's daughter Sybil Lindsay (<i>b</i>. 1874). Later Three Gables became home for Mallows and his family.<br>
<br>From the turn of the century Mallows worked occasionally with the landscape architect Thomas Hayton Mawson. Mallows rented rooms adjoining Mawson's at 28 Conduit Street in London until his death in 1915. In 1901 Sir Robert Affleck of Dalham Hall in Suffolk asked for a new wing to be added and a garden to complement the house. Neither the building nor Mallows's Elizabethan garden design came to anything as Affleck lost his money almost immediately and the house was sold.<br>
<br>Mallows's most important commission, Tirley Court (later Tirley Garth), was slow in its completion as it went through the hands of three successive owners. The Cheshire family house, with its central cloister, roughcast walls, and red stone dressing, was begun for a director of Brunner Mond, chemical manufacturers, in 1906, and not finished until after 1912, when Tirley Garth was leased to P. H. Prestwich, a manager of a textile firm near Manchester. Mallows asked Mawson to join him in planning the garden and landscape around the house in 1912. Mallows planned the &#145;garth&#146; as a planted courtyard with its surrounding cloister walk, and steps down to a central pool with deep blue tessellations. The very geometrical design for the garden, based on circles and rectangles, was Mallows's. There were formal beds next to the southern front overlooking grass, trees, and shrubs. The steeply sloping eastern side had tennis lawns above a semicircular, terraced bastion. A long, axial path connected the bastion to a circular vegetable garden, ending in a magnificent wooden bothy, as large as a cottage. Mawson's planting plans were for herbaceous borders, a rhododendron bed, and the trees and shrubs of the surrounding landscape. <span class="italic">The Studio</span> carried a series of articles by Mallows between 1908 and 1910 in which plans for Tirley Garth accompanied his thoughts on garden history and design.<br>
<br>Mallows was commissioned, in 1910, to remodel the remains of the old house at Canon's Park in Edgware for the industrialist Sir Arthur Du Cros MP, and to lay out new, grand gardens. Rectangular pools made a focus for the north and south gardens, and there was a long herbaceous border and walk in the east garden, looking out over lawns to a lake. Stone was generously used for terracing, for seats for the north walk, for a pergola, and for patterned brick paths. The house was sold to the North London Collegiate School in 1929, which built over the north garden. One of Mallows's last formal garden commissions, between 1913 and 1915, was for Craig-y-parc, Pentyrch, near Cardiff, for Thomas Evans (<i>d</i>. 1943), a businessman who had made money in coal and railways.<br>
<br>An accomplished draughtsman and designer of architectural gardens, Mallows perhaps never wanted the resounding successes of which he was capable. But before he could achieve more houses and gardens like Tirley Garth he died very suddenly, of heart failure, at Three Gables, Biddenham, on 2 June 1915.<br>
