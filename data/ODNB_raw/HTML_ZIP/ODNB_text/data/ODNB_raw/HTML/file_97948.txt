<span class="headword">McHardy,  John Bunch Bonnemaison</span>  (1801&#150;1882), <span class="occ">naval and police officer</span>, was born at New Providence, Bahamas, on 3 December 1801, the only surviving son of Robert McHardy, who had emigrated from Braemar to join his brother in business, and his wife, Mary Dean, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bunch (<i>d</i>. 1807), daughter of a wealthy plantation owner. On his mother's death he went to live with her sister, who was married to William Vesey Munnings, chief justice of the Bahamas. On 25 May 1812 he joined the Royal Navy as a boy third class on the <i>Tartarus</i> (32 guns) under John Pasco, who had been Nelson's signals officer at the battle of Trafalgar. After several years of seagoing experience and a navigation course at Portsmouth in 1821, he took part in actions against pirates around Cuba in 1823 and 1824 and was promoted lieutenant in August 1824. He was also active in the suppression of the slave trade. In June 1829, as commander of the schooner <i>Pickle</i> (3 guns), he captured the more heavily armed slaver <i>Voladora</i> (or <i>Bolodora</i>), carrying a cargo of slaves from Africa, off the coast of Cuba. The action was commemorated in a painting by the marine artist W. J. Huggins, engraved by Edward Duncan. When <i>Pickle</i> was paid off, in December 1830, McHardy was promoted commander. On 11 December 1830 he married Horatia Victoria Elizabeth Atchison (1808&#150;1883), daughter of his former mentor, John Pasco; they had at least fifteen children.<br>
<br>In March 1831 McHardy became inspecting commander of the Coast Guard at Burnham, Norfolk, and then Cromer (1835), moving to the Isle of Wight in 1836 to deal with an increase in smuggling. He was promoted captain in January 1840 and was placed on half pay.<br>
<br>On 11 February 1840 McHardy (whose name was often rendered as M'Hardy) was appointed to the newly created position of chief constable of Essex. Essex was one of the first nine counties to adopt the <span class="roman">County Police Act</span> of 1839, which permitted counties to set up a full-time, paid police force, financed from local taxation. Creation of county constabularies was voluntary, and only a minority of counties undertook this, and not all of those fully. The resolution of the Essex quarter sessions to establish the force had not been unanimous, and cost was a major consideration, but authority was given to recruit a chief constable, 100 constables and 15 superintendents. This was fewer than the maximum permitted ratio of 1 constable to every 1000 inhabitants, and in its early years the new force in Essex worked alongside existing part-time or volunteer parish constables. There had been thirty-one applicants for the chief constable's office, and McHardy was among the nineteen&#151;many of them former army or navy officers&#151;interviewed by the county's magistrates.<br>
<br>Although he was not formally attested as a constable until 19 May 1840, McHardy quickly began work to plan the new force, gaining authorization from the Essex magistrates to buy a copy of the Irish constabulary's rule book. He also purchased a series of forms used by the Coast Guard and adapted them for police use. The Metropolitan Police rule book was consulted, and McHardy elected to use the same supplier of uniforms for his own officers. Interviews to find the first 100 constables were held in batches from 26 February 1840 until the end of May. Recruits were on probation for fifty-six days, and many were found unsuitable for reasons that included being &#145;wanting in bodily strength&#146;  (personnel register, Essex RO, J/P 2/1). McHardy was allowed to choose his own secretary, a naval purser, as he felt it &#145;absolutely necessary&#146; that the postholder should not be a policeman in case he was perceived to be influencing the chief constable.<br>
<br>One of the chief constable's responsibilities was to frame orders to guide his officers, and McHardy issued a detailed series of memoranda, some of which were published in local newspapers. His men were reminded that no one could be promoted without being able to write good letters and reports, so it was in their own interests to devote some time every day to reading, writing, and generally improving their minds. Although preventing crime and controlling public order were seen as the main objectives of the &#145;new police&#146; McHardy steadily increased the volume and variety of their everyday work, believing that it helped to justify the cost of the force to local ratepayers. Some officers were appointed as inspectors of weights and measures and of nuisances; others became assistant relieving officers under the poor law. Liquor licensing was one of the earliest activities of the embryo police force in 1840, while public order was an increasing problem throughout the 1840s and 1850s. McHardy himself, while based at the constabulary headquarters in Arbour Lane, Chelmsford, was often present in courts around Essex as cases were prosecuted. His visibility throughout the county helped to make him widely respected, even when the system of policing was sometimes criticized as being too costly. With a modern eye for press relations he encouraged his superintendents to keep newspapers informed about problems and successes relating to crime.<br>
<br>Under McHardy the Essex constabulary was regarded as a leading example of the new county police. Its effectiveness prompted counties adjoining Essex to establish their own forces, and it provided a policing model that was adopted elsewhere. McHardy was the most prominent witness to appear before a House of Commons select committee on the police, giving evidence on three occasions in May and June 1853, and submitting lengthy written appendices. He urged the superiority of the professional force, with its county-wide command structure, over the more numerous parish constables. Five of the other witnesses who appeared before the committee had served in McHardy's force before going on to other positions, and all testified to the great efficiency of policing in Essex. McHardy also promoted the idea that county constabularies could be self-funding, providing accounts from Essex to show that such benefits as reductions in vagrancy, attributable to police interviewing applicants for casual poor relief, and increases in agricultural land values, put down to improved protection of farmers' livestock and crops, might be set against the costs of policing. He went on to propose that constabularies might serve as the nucleus of a national defence force in case of emergencies. This more speculative proposal was never acted upon, but the select committee was followed by an act of parliament in 1856 that made it compulsory for every county and borough to have a full-time, paid police force, and established a government inspectorate to judge efficiency.<br>
<br>While on naval half pay McHardy remained eligible for promotion and he was advanced to rear-admiral in February 1858, vice-admiral in September 1865, and admiral on 1 April 1870. He retired as chief constable of Essex on 31 October 1881. During his period of office the authorized strength of the Essex force had grown from 116 to 293. In his farewell address to the Essex magistrates he reflected that initially the police were viewed with some distrust as an unnecessary expense, but public confidence had gradually been won over. His influence went beyond Essex, as his force functioned as &#145;a sort of nursery for policemen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chelmsford Chronicle</span>, 6 April 1866), who went on to serve in many of the other constabularies. Two of his sons, after naval service, became chief constables: Hardy McHardy (1840&#150;1919) was chief constable of Ayr from 1876 to 1911, and Wallace Bruce McHardy (1844&#150;1896), who had served as deputy to his father in Essex, was chief constable of Lanarkshire from 1875 until his death. His fifteenth child, Malcolm Macdonald McHardy (1852&#150;1913), became professor of ophthalmology at King's College, London.<br>
<br>In retirement McHardy moved to live with his married daughter Malvina Blaxall and her husband at Clan Lodge, Sydney Gardens, Bath, where he died on 19 December 1882. He was buried in the family tomb at Holy Trinity Church, Springfield, Essex. An obituarist wrote of his &#145;rare administrative ability and tact&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 21 Dec 1882), while an early historian of police commented on the good fortune of Essex to have &#145;entrusted the control of its rural police to a really brilliant chief-constable&#146;  (Lee, 301).<br>
