<span class="headword">Peckitt,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1731, <em>d.</em> 1795), <span class="occ">glass-painter</span>, was born at Husthwaite, near Easingwold in the North Riding of Yorkshire, and baptized on 13 April 1731, the third of the six children of William Peckitt (1681/2&#150;1776), fellmonger of Husthwaite and glove maker of York, and his wife, Ann (1690&#150;1787), daughter of Thomas Hunt of Linton-on-Ouse. His grandfather and great-grandfather were also fellmongers from the North Riding, though he and his younger brother, Henry, claimed genteel origins from the medieval family of Picote of Yorkshire and assumed both a coat of arms and a crest. Peckitt appears to have helped in his father's business and to have moved with him to York before 1752 when his father had set up a glove-making business there. In the opening lines of his commission book he recorded that he began the art of painting and staining of glass at Michaelmas 1751. In 1752 he advertised in the <span class="italic">York Courant</span> that he had set up as a glass-painter in Colliergate, York.<br>
<br>Claims that Peckitt was taught by the glass-painter Henry Gyles (<i>d</i>. 1709) of Micklegate, York, are unfounded. Nor is there support for further claims that he was taught glass painting in London by William Price the younger (<i>d</i>. 1765), or that he was trained as a carver and gilder by his father-in-law, Charles Mitley of York. Mitley had died five years before Peckitt married his daughter Mary (1743&#150;1826) on 3 April 1763, and twelve years after Peckitt declared himself a glass-painter. The declaration in Peckitt's trade notice that he had discovered the art &#145;by many experiments&#146; was repeated in his letter to the Free Society of Artists of London in 1760. He continued to experiment throughout his fifty-five years as a glass-painter. In 1780 he patented an invention &#145;for blending Coloured and Stained Glass&#146;  (patents no. 1268), and by 1793 he had compiled a manuscript, intended for publication, entitled &#145;The principles of introduction into that rare but fine and elegant art of painting and staining of glass&#146;.<br>
<br>Peckitt's first recorded commission, in October 1751, was for armorials for the deanery at York. John Fountayne, dean of York from 1747 to 1802, remained Peckitt's greatest single patron, and employed Peckitt throughout his working life in the repair and restoration of York Minster's medieval glass. Before he died Peckitt bequeathed three glass paintings to the minster to be inserted in the south transept, alongside his <span class="italic">St Peter</span> (1768). These were: <span class="italic">Moses</span> (<i>c</i>.1774), <span class="italic">Abraham</span> (1780), and <span class="italic">Solomon</span> (1780) (York Minster). Peckitt also painted the east windows of Lincoln (1762) and Ripon (1791) cathedrals and the west window of Exeter Cathedral (1767) (all subsequently removed and fragmented in lesser windows in the respective churches). At the same time he adorned with armorial glass the deaneries and episcopal palaces of York, Exeter, Lincoln, Peterborough, and Armagh. Peckitt's early work chiefly comprised heraldic and genealogical subjects, historical scenes and portraits, dogs, horses, and animals for nursery windows. He also restored old glass. It was a secular subject for York Guildhall, <span class="italic">York's Car of Justice</span> after Elkaniah Settle, which earned him the freedom of the city of York in 1754. Peckitt's patrons steadily increased and his work was in demand throughout the British Isles. He even secured a commission in France, probably through his connection with Horace Walpole, who turned to Peckitt to embellish Strawberry Hill following the retirement of William Price in 1760. Under that <i>arbiter elegantiorum</i> the growth of gothick taste brought added encouragement to Peckitt and the handful of his contemporaries who practised as glass-painters.<br>
<br>Peckitt's portraits on glass, such as <span class="italic">William III</span> and <span class="italic">William, Duke of Cumberland</span> (York City Art Gallery), were much admired and in 1761 the earl of Bute commissioned a portrait of George III. Peckitt's accomplishment in this genre is best represented by his self-portrait from his portrait in oils (<i>c</i>.1760) by Johan Schuster of Saxony (both York City Art Gallery). By contrast, his <span class="italic">Presentation of Christ in the Temple</span> (1767) at Oriel College, Oxford, displays weak colours and poor draughtsmanship, the cartoons being executed by Dr John Wall of the Worcester porcelain factory. His west window for the chapel of New College, Oxford (1765), depicting <span class="italic">Christ, the Virgin and the Twelve Apostles</span>, was also criticized for the want of good cartoons and was subsequently removed to the side windows of the chapel and replaced in 1787 by Thomas Jervais's <span class="italic">Nativity and the Seven Virtues</span> from cartoons by Sir Joshua Reynolds. Peckitt eventually employed two Italian draughtsmen who were among the founders of the Royal Academy, Biagio Rebecca and Giovanni Battista Cipriani. The former drew the cartoons for <span class="italic">The Adoration of the Magi</span> (1772) and <span class="italic">The Last Supper</span> (1771), which Peckitt painted for the Gothic chapel at Audley End, Essex. Rebecca also provided the cartoons for the <span class="italic">Twenty-Four Patriarchs and Prophets</span> which were inserted in three windows of New College chapel, Oxford (1774). Cipriani's cartoon was used for the allegorical window of the <span class="italic">Muse Presenting Sir Isaac Newton and Sir Francis Bacon to George III</span> (1775) (Trinity College Library, Cambridge).<br>
<br>Peckitt was a modest, private person devoted to his wife, who described him as &#145;a kind and affectionate husband and a pious Christian&#146;  (Mary Peckitt, epitaph), and their four daughters. In his last years he began to write and in 1794 published in York a religious tract entitled <span class="italic">The Wonderful Love of God to Man, or, Heaven Opened in Earth</span>. He died at his house at Friars' Walls, York, on 14 October 1795. His wife's last tribute to him was the execution and erection of his memorial window (1796) in the church of St Martin-cum-Gregory, York, where he was buried.<br>
<br>Though much of Peckitt's work was derided and removed during the Victorian Gothic revival, he helped keep the art of glass painting alive during the eighteenth century, and contributed to the revival of an acceptable post-Reformation hagiography in the Church of England.<br>
