<span class="headword">Coleman,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1622, <em>d.</em> 1669), <span class="occ">singer and composer</span>, was baptized on 27 April 1622 at St Andrew's, Holborn, London. He was the second of seven children born to the viol player and composer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5869/', "Charles Coleman (d. 1664)")</script> and his wife, Grace. He first comes to notice in John Playford's list in <span class="italic">A Musicall Banquet</span> (1651) of teachers &#145;for the Voyce or Viole&#146;. He is, in fact, praised as Susanna Perwich's singing teacher in John Batchiler's <span class="italic">The Virgins Pattern</span> (1661), where he is described as having &#145;rare abilities in <i>singing</i>&#146;. He sang in <span class="italic">The First Dayes Entertainment at Rutland House</span> in May 1656. An anonymous report on the <span class="italic">Entertainment</span> noted that &#145;the Singers were Capt. Cooke, Ned Coleman and his wife, another wooman and other inconsiderable voyces&#146;. Coleman was to have taken the role of Alphonso in <span class="italic">The Siege of Rhodes</span> the following September. That production appears to have been thwarted at the last minute by an order from Cromwell for all those who had fought on the royalist side in the civil war (thus including William Davenant, who was both author and impresario) to leave London by 6 September. <span class="italic">The Siege of Rhodes</span> was eventually performed at the Cockpit in April&#150;May 1659, but with a double cast; Coleman shared his role with Roger Hill. This first English opera was something of a family affair: Edward's father composed the instrumental music (with George Hudson), while his wife, Catherine Ferrabosco (<i>bap</i>. 1623), sang the part of Ianthe.<br>
<br>Edward Coleman's earliest known composition is the song &#145;The Glories of our Birth and State&#146;, which was written for James Shirley's <span class="italic">Contention of Ajax and Ulysses</span>, performed at Shirley's school at some time before its publication in 1659. (Coleman's song did not appear in print until 1667, in Playford's <span class="italic">The Musical Companion</span>, but was then reprinted in various anthologies up to 1680.) A number of his songs are included in the first volume of Playford's <span class="italic">Select Musicall Ayres and Dialogues</span> (1653).<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Coleman took up two positions in the court musical establishment. He became a gentleman of the Chapel Royal and was appointed to the &#145;private musick in ordinary &hellip; in the place of John Lanier for a voyce&#146;. Since Coleman's place was taken after his death by the countertenor William Turner, we may assume that he too was a countertenor. He was listed among the gentlemen of the Chapel Royal who sang at the coronation of Charles II on St George's day (23 April) 1661. Like so many of the court musicians, Coleman seems to have got into financial difficulties as a consequence of the late payment of salaries. There were two instances, in 1662 and 1663, of his assigning sums due to him from the exchequer to creditors, and the administration of his will was granted to another.<br>
<br>The only description of Coleman's singing comes from Pepys, and it is not particularly flattering. In the last few months of 1665 Catherine and Edward Coleman were frequent visitors at Pepys's house at Greenwich (where he had gone to escape the plague). Pepys noted in his diary on 8 November &#145;the best company for Musique I ever was in in my life &hellip; I have never lived so merrily &hellip; as I have done this plague-time, by &hellip; the acquaintance of &hellip; Coleman and her husband.&#146; But his entry ten days earlier had been less enthusiastic about Coleman's voice&#151;and his manners:<blockquote>By and by, I back again home, and there find him [Thomas Hill] return[ed] with Mr. Coleman (his wife being ill) and Mr. [Nicholas] Laneare&#151;with whom, with their Lute, we had excellent company and good singing till midnight, and a good supper I did give them. But Coleman's voice is quite spoiled; and when he begins to be drunk, he is excellent company, but afterward troublesome and impertinent.</blockquote>The Chapel Royal's book of remembrance records that Coleman died at Greenwich on 29 August 1669.<br>
