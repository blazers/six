<span class="headword">Ewin,  William Howell</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1731, <em>d.</em> 1804), <span class="occ">usurer</span>, was born in Cambridge, where he was baptized on 3 February 1731 at St Sepulchre's. He was the son of Thomas Ewin, formerly a grocer, and later a brewer in partnership with a Mr Sparks, and Susanna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Howell, the daughter of a Cambridge coal merchant. He had a sister named Sarah. He was educated at St John's College, Cambridge, which he entered on 15 March 1749, and graduated BA in 1753, MA in 1756, and LLD on 11 June 1766. He is said to have received a diploma of LLD from Edinburgh in or about 1778, but his name does not occur in the 1858 catalogue of graduates. At the death of his father Ewin inherited his share of the brewing business and a substantial fortune, which he largely increased by private usury. He joined the commission of the peace for the town and county of Cambridge, and in 1769, along with his former college tutor, William Samuel Powell, delayed the implementation of an act for better paving, lighting, and public order in the town. The antiquarian William Cole wrote:<blockquote>My friend, Dr. Ewin, by being much of his father's turn, busy and meddling in other people's concerns, got the ill will of most persons in the town and university. &hellip; The gownsmen bore him a particular grudge for interfering much in their affairs. &hellip; They often broke the doctor's windows, as they said he had been caught listening on their staircases and doors. &hellip; Dr. Ewin, as did his father, squinted very much</blockquote>which resulted in him receiving the nickname of Dr Squintum  (BL, Add. MS 5804, fol. 68<i>b</i>).<br>
<br>In January 1777 it was reported that Ewin had loaned money to William Bird, a scholar at Trinity College, at a high rate of interest. Between 1775 and 1776 Bird, then a minor without a father, had been lent &pound;750 and was required to repay Ewin a total of &pound;1090; failure to do so had led to Bird's imprisonment in a sponging-house for debtors. This &#145;usurious affair&#146;, as Cole terms it, came to light at a very unlucky time, for Ewin had been promised the chancellorship of the diocese of Ely, which was to fall vacant in the following May. However, eighteen months elapsed before the university took action. The trial took place at the vice-chancellor's court on 14 October 1778, and on 21 October Ewin was sentenced to be suspended from all degrees taken, or to be taken, and expelled from the university. The delegates on his appeal confirmed the suspension, but revoked the expulsion. He thereupon applied to the court of king's bench for a mandamus to restore him to his degrees. After lengthy discussions the court awarded the writ in June 1779, on the ground that, as no university statute expressly forbade usury or the lending of money to minors, the vice-chancellor's court had no jurisdiction in the case. Lord Mansfield, however, censured Ewin's conduct in the strongest terms, and stigmatized him as &#145;a corrupter of youth and an usurer&#146;. He suggested that Ewin be removed from the commission of the peace and that a statute should be passed to meet such cases in the future  (Cooper, 4.388&#150;9, 392). On 20 October 1779 Ewin was restored to his degree of LLD, but two years later was dismissed from the county commission.<br>
<br>Eventually Ewin settled at Brentford where, according to his obituary, &#145;his strict attention to the administration of parochial concerns&#146; and his readiness to &#145;condemn every species of idleness and imposition, created him many enemies, particularly among the lower orders of people&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>). He died at Brentford Butts on 20 or 29 December 1804, aged seventy-three, and was buried in the chapel of New Brentford, with a monument by John Flaxman. He is thought to have left property amounting to over &pound;100,000 to his sister Sarah, who died in 1808.<br>
