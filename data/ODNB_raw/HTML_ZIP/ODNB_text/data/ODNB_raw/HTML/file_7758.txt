<span class="headword">Dodson,  John George</span>, first Baron Monk Bretton  (1825&#150;1897), <span class="occ">politician</span>, born at 12 Hertford Street, Mayfair, Westminster, on 18 October 1825, was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7757/', "Sir John Dodson (1780&#150;1858)")</script> and his wife, Frances Priscilla <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pearson. He was educated at Eton College from 1838 where he won in 1841 and 1842 the prince consort's prizes for modern languages. He matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 9 June 1843, and graduated BA in 1847, when he obtained a first class in classics, and MA in 1851. In 1853 he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn.<br>
<br>On leaving Oxford in 1847 Dodson spent two years in travel in the East, going as far as Baghdad, and on his return journey visiting Albania and Montenegro. He stayed for three months in 1848&#150;9 in Cyprus, and his account of that island, which was then little known, was reproduced in successive editions of Murray's <span class="italic">Handbook</span> down to 1872. His eastern tour was soon followed by travel in other parts of the world&#151;the United States in 1853 and the Crimea during the Crimean War. He possessed great facility as a linguist, which he retained throughout his life. An ardent mountaineer, he was a member of the Alpine Club. He published his narrative of an ascent of &#145;the passages of the Glacier du Tour and of the Col de Miage in September 1859&#146; in <span class="italic">Peaks, Passes, and Glaciers</span> (2nd ser., 1.189&#150;207).<br>
<br>Dodson unsuccessfully contested the division of East Sussex in July 1852 and March 1857 as a Liberal, but in April 1857 he was returned at the head of the poll and held the seat until February 1874. At the general election of 1874 he was elected for the City of Chester, and was again returned in April 1880, being shortly afterwards re-elected on receiving an office under the crown. But subsequently the earlier election was declared void on petition, and, although the second election remained unimpugned, he could neither sit nor vote. He consequently found a new seat at Scarborough, and represented that constituency from July 1880 until 1884, when he became a peer.<br>
<br>For three years (1858&#150;61) Dodson was prominent in urging in the House of Commons the repeal of the hop duties, which Gladstone removed in 1861. In 1863 he carried through the House of Commons the act enabling university electors to vote by post (which led to Gladstone's defeat as MP for the university). He unsuccessfully introduced in 1864 a bill for the abolition of tests at the universities. From February 1865 to April 1872 Dodson was chairman of committees and deputy speaker of the House of Commons, and on 10 May 1872 he was sworn of the privy council. He was an authority on parliamentary procedure, and his speech on private bill legislation on 18 February 1868 was printed. He was financial secretary to the Treasury from August 1873 to February 1874, and for three years (1874&#150;6) he was chairman of the committee of public accounts.<br>
<br>In April 1880, on the formation of Gladstone's second ministry, Dodson was made president of the Local Government Board with a seat in the cabinet. During his first year of cabinet office he carried the government's <span class="roman">Employers' Liability Act</span> through the Commons but failed to produce a local government bill satisfactory to the cabinet. On 20 December 1882 he was transferred to the post of chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, an office he retained until October 1884, when he retired from the government. He was created Baron Monk Bretton of Conyboro and Hurstpierpoint on 4 November 1884 (on this curious combination in a title see <span class="roman">GEC</span>, 5.330). He filled political office competently and was reckoned a sound man of business, but his abilities &#145;did not appear on the surface, and many people were puzzled at the success he attained&#146;  (West, 1.55). In the making of policy he was fussy and pedantic. Like H. C. E. Childers, he made less impact on Victorian Liberalism than a more determined person in his position could have done.<br>
<br>In 1886 Lord Monk Bretton declined to accept Gladstone's home-rule policy, and thenceforth took no prominent part in politics. During the parliamentary recess he always lived a retired life in his country home at Conyboro, Sussex, and played a great role in county business. He was the first chairman of the East Sussex county council (1889&#150;92). He wrote seven articles for the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> and contributed to the collections of the Sussex Archaeological Society an article on Sussex roads (15.138&#150;47); he chaired the society's meetings in 1870, 1872, and 1875.<br>
<br>On 3 January 1856 Dodson married Florence, second daughter of William John Campion of Danny, Sussex. They had one son and three daughters. Lady Monk Bretton died on 17 February 1912, aged eighty-one. Monk Bretton died at 6 Seamore Place, London, on 25 May 1897 and was buried in the churchyard of Barcombe, Sussex, the parish of his estate of Conyboro.<br>
