<span class="headword">More,  Alexander Goodman</span>  (1830&#150;1895), <span class="occ">naturalist</span>, was born on 5 September 1830 in London, the first of three children of Alexander More (<i>d</i>. 1886). He was a delicate child and when, in 1834, his younger brother, George, died of scarlatina, the family moved to Renens, Switzerland. More was educated by a nursery-governess until he was nine, when he went to live with a tutor. When almost eleven he was sent to Mr Bailey's School in Clifton where he remained for two years, and in February 1842 he entered Rugby School. He was a good scholar and, although always sickly, a keen athlete. By this time his parents and sister, Frances (Fanny) Margaret, had settled at Bembridge, Isle of Wight. More entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1851 to study the classics, but bouts of illness disrupted his studies and he left in February 1855 without graduating. While at Cambridge he became friendly with the botanists Charles C. Babington (1808&#150;1895) and the Revd William W. Newbould (1819&#150;1886), and with the ornithologists F. D. Goodman and Edward Newton.<br>
<br>For the next twelve years More occupied himself studying natural history and visiting Ireland, especially co. Galway where his friends the Shawe-Taylors lived. Sometimes his sister, also a keen naturalist, accompanied him. He observed plants, birds, and insects. It is clear from More's numerous publications and correspondence that he was an all-round naturalist, interested in both plants and animals. He corresponded with a number of other naturalists, including Charles Darwin (1809&#150;1882).<br>
<br>More displayed a strong bias towards the study of distribution patterns. His major ornithological work, <span class="italic">On the Distribution of Birds in Great Britain during the Nesting Season</span> (1865), reported the results of a survey for which he employed the same scheme of districts that Hewett C. Watson (1804&#150;1881) had defined for recording plant distribution. More had also used the same scheme in an earlier paper, &#145;On the geographical distribution of butterflies in Great Britain&#146;, which he wrote in collaboration with Thomas Boyd. <span class="italic">Contributions towards a Cybele Hibernica, being outlines of the geographical distribution of plants in Ireland</span>, published in 1866, was compiled by More in collaboration with David Moore (1808&#150;1879), director of the Royal Dublin Society's Botanic Gardens, Glasnevin. They also read a paper on the climate, flora, and crops of Ireland at the International Horticultural Exhibition and Botanical Congress, London, in May 1866. These botanical works contained one of the first maps to show plant distribution patterns by means of isopleths and points.<br>
<br>In January 1867 More was appointed assistant naturalist in the Royal Dublin Society's Natural History Museum; the museum was transferred to government control in 1877. Following the death of Dr Alexander Carte in 1881 More was promoted to curator, but ill health obliged him to retire in July 1887. He never married. After their mother's death in 1888 he and his sister made their home in Dublin. More continued to write about a wide variety of topics and was working on a second edition of <span class="italic">Cybele Hibernica</span> when he died at his home, 74 Leinster Road, Rathmines, co. Dublin, on 22 March 1895. He was buried at Mount Jerome cemetery, Dublin.<br>
<br>More (known simply as A. G. More) was a member of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh, the British Ornithological Union, and the Royal Irish Academy, and was elected to fellowships in the Linnean Society of London, and the Royal Society of Edinburgh. After his death Nathaniel Colgan (1851&#150;1919) and Reginald Scully (1858&#150;1935) completed the second edition of <span class="italic">Contribution towards a Cybele Hibernica</span> (1898). On its title-page was the byline &#145;founded on the papers of the late Alexander Goodman More&#146;; the omission of any reference to David Moore caused embarrassment to Fanny More, and she apologized to his son, Frederick Moore. David Moore had previously honoured his colleague by naming <i>Isoetes morei</i>; this large quillwort from Lough Bray, co. Wicklow, is now considered to be a form of <i>Isoetes lacustris</i>.<br>
