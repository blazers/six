<span class="headword">Pole,  John  de la</span>, second duke of Suffolk  (1442&#150;1492), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was born on 27 September 1442, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22461/', "William de la Pole, first duke of Suffolk (1396&#150;1450)")</script>, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54434/', "Alice Chaucer (d. 1475)")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandfinancialdifficulties"></a>Early years and financial difficulties</h2>Although the Suffolk earldom was poorly endowed, perhaps worth no more than the 1000 marks (&pound;666 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.) qualifying income for an earl, Alice herself inherited a considerable estate from her father, Sir Thomas Chaucer (<i>d</i>. 1434), of Ewelme, Oxfordshire, and held substantial dowers from both her previous husbands, John Phelip and Thomas Montagu, earl of Salisbury. Including &pound;359 of royal annuities, the income of John de la Pole's parents was assessed at only &pound;1667 for tax in 1436. His father's career as Henry VI's favourite brought promotion to marquess (1444) and duke (1448) of Suffolk and substantial royal grants, including the lordship of Pembroke. William de la Pole's access to royal favour, especially royal wardships, promised further acquisitions of property by his son's marriage to either Anne Beauchamp or Margaret Beaufort, two great heirs respectively of the dukes of Warwick and Somerset. Following Anne's death in 1449, John de la Pole did indeed marry his distant cousin Margaret Beaufort (1443&#150;1509) in his father's lifetime, and in 1450 was dispensed by Pope Nicholas V (1443&#150;1509) to remain married. It was claimed that Duke William had intended this match to bring his son the crown: &#145;presumyng and pretendyng her [Margaret] to be next enheritable to the Crowne of youre Reame, for lakke of issue of your Soverayne lord&#146;  (<span class="italic">RotP</span>, 5.177). During the 1440s John de la Pole appeared destined for a more financially secure career than any previous member of his family. It was not to be.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1450, Duke William was impeached by the Commons and, although not convicted, was first exiled and then murdered. His moving letter of advice to his young son, written on 30 April, survives. Successive attempts to attaint Suffolk as a traitor and to confiscate his possessions were thwarted, but the royal grants that had served to endow his dukedom were resumed. Duke John was exempted from none of the <span class="roman">Acts of Resumption</span> of 1450&#150;56: hence he lost the constableship of Wallingford, Berkshire, and the stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds to which he had been appointed jointly with his parents as an infant in 1445. The desired and anticipated accretions by marriage did not materialize. Moreover, the new duke's mother, Duchess Alice, retained not only her dowers and her inheritance, but also from Easter 1453 her dower of one-third from Duke William. Until she died in 1475, Duke John held only two-thirds of the original Suffolk endowment, valued at just &pound;278 a year, a fraction of the normal endowment of a duke, and inadequate even for an earl or a baron. Certainly he could not maintain the estate worthy of a duke. On her death, Alice's Suffolk dower and jointure did indeed pass to Duke John, but her dowers from her previous two husbands inevitably reverted to their families, and her executors enjoyed the issues of her own enfeoffed estates for an indeterminate period. Moreover, Duke John by then had to provide for an eldest son. In 1478 he &#145;must make a shift for money and that in all haste&#146;  (<span class="italic">Paston Letters and Papers of the Fifteenth Century</span>, 1.611) and had to pledge jewellery to the king. Unfortunately his proximity to the house of York never brought the material advancement that could reasonably have been expected.<h2>
<a name="Yorkistattachment"></a>Yorkist attachment</h2>John de la Pole was a mere child at his father's death; although included in commissions from 1457, aged fifteen, he was not to come of full age until 1463. The reversion of the wardship of his person and lands on his father's death had been granted to his mother in 1444 and was confirmed in 1450, but it was resumed in 1450 and the lands were farmed out. His marriage with the seven-year-old Margaret Beaufort was easily set aside in 1453, when Henry VI, forgetful of his obligation to the duke's father, allocated Margaret and her inheritance to his own elder half-brother, Edmund Tudor. In return for a loan of 2000 marks, the estates were then farmed by the dowager duchess of Somerset. No alternative heiress was found for Suffolk. Instead in 1458 he married Elizabeth (1444&#150;1503/4), the daughter of Richard, duke of York, and Cecily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Neville. Their son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22458/', "Richard de la Pole")</script>, was a later claimant to the English throne. Elizabeth was John's equal in rank, hailing indeed from the highest nobility, and York secured a second duke for his second daughter. Elizabeth brought only a marriage portion totalling 2300 marks (&pound;1533): while this was a substantial sum for Duchess Alice, it fell far short of other marriage portions in this period&#151;it was only a third of what York paid for his elder daughter's marriage&#151;and was payable in instalments, which the financially embarrassed York was ill-placed to pay and some of which were still unpaid in 1472.<br>
<br>From Suffolk's side the match was made by the duchess, apparently on 1&#150;2 February 1458, when the king was negotiating the political reconciliation of York to the heirs of the lords killed in 1455 at St Albans, and to the queen and the Lancastrian government. It had been York who had pressed for the attainder of Duke William. The marriage was intended to reconcile the de la Poles with a former political enemy, include them in national reconciliation, and tie them to York, who was destined for a prominent role in the ruling regime. Such calculations were misjudged: Suffolk became bound to the opposition to regime and dynasty, and again hazarded the future of his house. The &#145;Loveday of St Paul's&#146; of 24 March 1458, which it was hoped would end hostilities between the Yorkists and their enemies, brought no permanent peace. York was soon leader of opposition to the crown, driven into exile, and attainted at the Coventry parliament of 1459, when de la Pole himself was allegedly degraded from his dukedom to become mere earl of Suffolk. Benet's chronicle states that this was for marrying York's daughter.<br>
<br>While this story cannot be substantiated&#151;there are too few references to the young duke at this stage of his minority&#151;it was not unjustified on grounds of qualifying income. If incorporated in an act of parliament now lost, like that of George Neville, duke of Bedford, in 1478, it was repealed with the acts of the Coventry parliament in 1460 and in practice earlier. The Lancastrian regime briefly appointed him a JP in 1460. It was kinship to York that caused him to join the Yorkists in the spring of 1461 at the battles of St Albans (7 February 1461) and Towton (29 March), which resulted in the accession of his brother-in-law, York's eldest son, as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8520/', "Edward IV")</script>. He was steward of England at King Edward's coronation. As &#145;brother&#146; of the king, among those who put him on the throne, and one of only two adult dukes, should not he have shared in the fruits of victory that King Edward was to dispense so lavishly?<h2>
<a name="Limitedroyalserviceandrewards"></a>Limited royal service and rewards</h2>Any such hopes were to be disappointed. Suffolk's inability to live at the level appropriate for a duke may have been a factor, although his dignity was explicitly confirmed on 23 March 1463 and his eldest son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22449/', "John de la Pole")</script>, the king's nephew, was created earl of Lincoln in 1467. It was only in 1463 that he was allowed to enter his lands: although this occurred three months earlier than the usual age of maturity, it compares unfavourably with the king's brothers, who came into their estates five years early. It immediately followed service against the northern Lancastrians and his attendance at the reinterment at Bisham Priory, Berkshire, of the earl of Salisbury, a Yorkist victim of Wakefield, and preceded his nomination as trier at the parliament of 1463. On 6 April 1465 he was granted 100 marks a year during Duchess Elizabeth's life, until the king could provide land of equal value.<br>
<br>Suffolk featured prominently in state ceremonials, such as the tournament of Lord Scales against Antoine, count of La Roche, the Bastard of Burgundy, in 1467, and the coronation of Edward IV's queen, Elizabeth, in 1465, at which he bore the sceptre. He escorted Edward IV to London following his release by Warwick in September 1469, participated in the Lincolnshire campaign and Losecote Field early in 1470, was mistrusted by Henry VI's readeption government, and justified their mistrust by joining in Edward IV's victorious Barnet and Tewkesbury campaign in the spring of 1471. He duly took the oath of allegiance to the king's newly born heir, Prince Edward, on 3 July 1471, and did homage to the latter's brother, Prince Richard, in 1477. He may have been entrusted with the custody of Queen Margaret of Anjou in 1472. He was appointed high steward of Oxford University in 1472, elected a knight of the Garter about 1473, and was lieutenant of Ireland for four months from March to July 1478. In 1479&#150;80 he alienated property to Edward IV's favourite foundation and chosen resting-place, St George's Chapel, Windsor.<br>
<br>As a royal duke and the king's brother-in-law, Suffolk was useful to Edward IV. Undoubtedly he was proud of his dignity, for in 1471 he refused to attend parliament because he was unable to bring a retinue sufficient for his worship. But Suffolk was never a royal councillor. No other major grants came his way. Seen in the wider context of the family policy of Edward IV, who endowed his brothers more lavishly than any predecessor, selected only dukes and earls for his consort's sisters, and secured some of their husbands with substantial endowments, the under-resourced duke of Suffolk fared badly indeed. Apart from Wallingford and the Chiltern Hundreds, he secured little more than the custody of the lands of Lord Lovell in 1471, valuable in themselves and complementary to his own, but not including the marriage of the heir. His misfortune surely reflects unfavourably on the duke himself: on his compatibility with the king, and on his ability. That Duchess Elizabeth fared so much less favourably than her elder sister, Anne of Exeter, implies a weakness of character on her husband's part. Suffolk did not stand aloof from factional politics; he was a loyal member of the Yorkist house and shared in several of its victories that were far from predetermined for success. Luck, rather than studied calculation, explains his escape from the consequences of any major defeats and disasters. He avoided supporting causes that were lost, quickly acquiescing in the successions of Richard III and Henry VII.<br>
<br>Suffolk's rank, rather than the extent of his estates, explains his presence on the commissions of the peace of Norfolk and Suffolk (in 1460, and from 1464), Oxfordshire (from 1466), and Berkshire (from 1468). He seems to have been as frequently at his mother's house at Ewelme as at his other East Anglian seats. Suffolk tried to influence the choice of sheriff in 1460 and, in co-operation with the duke of Norfolk, the election of Norfolk MPs in 1472. That he felt his relative poverty acutely is suggested by his unsuccessful attempt to buy part of the Fastolf inheritance in 1461, by his unjustified claim to Heylesdon and Drayton, Suffolk, and by his interest in other disputed property in 1462. In 1465 his men attacked Hellesdon, destroying the house and ransacking the church, and in 1467 he bought up the rights of Fastolf's feoffees for a song; maintenance and violence was alleged on other occasions. Suffolk escaped unpunished. His royal connections caused King Edward to turn a blind eye, but the duke was unable to secure the intervention on his side of either the king or the chancellor.<h2>
<a name="Latercareeranddeath"></a>Later career and death</h2>Suffolk's later career was overshadowed by political events in which he played only a small part. He served on Edward IV's invasion of France in 1475 with 40 men-at-arms and 300 archers, a retinue that fell far short of those of other royal dukes. He remained of use to Richard III and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12954/', "Henry VII")</script>, his nephew by marriage, and bore the sceptre at both Richard's coronation and that of Henry's queen, Elizabeth of York. Although only cheap and insubstantial honours were granted to him, he continued to emphasize his dignity, in 1487 declining to attend a Garter feast for which insufficient provision had been made. His compliance with the state trial of his brother-in-law Clarence was secured by the lieutenancy of Ireland, which he presumably expected to last longer than it did, and a favourable (but small-scale) exchange of lands that gained him two Oxfordshire manors. His son Lincoln succeeded Richard III's own son as president of the council of the north, and was perhaps designated as his heir. Such favours did not embrace Suffolk, who even lost Wallingford to his erstwhile ward, Francis, Lord Lovell. Though Suffolk was not at Bosworth, Lincoln was, but escaped forfeiture. Suffolk was immediately reappointed to the constableship of Wallingford forfeited by Lovell, and was a trier in Henry VII's first parliament. In 1487 Lincoln rebelled with Lambert Simnel, taking the lead and perhaps seeking the crown, and was slain at the battle of Stoke. Suffolk himself was not implicated and was apparently still trusted: he was a trier at that year's parliament and took the muster of the Brittany expedition the next year, but lost his constableship of Wallingford. More seriously, when Lincoln was attainted for his treason and suffered forfeiture in 1487, Suffolk was allowed to save those family lands held by his son, but this concession applied to his life only, so that on his death it was an attenuated inheritance burdened by his duchess's dower that passed to his next son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22446/', "Edmund de la Pole")</script>, who gave up the title of duke in return for forfeited land. Still apparently living on 14 but dead by 20 May 1492, Suffolk was buried with his duchess at his college of Wingfield, Suffolk; alabaster effigies were erected over their tombs.<br>
