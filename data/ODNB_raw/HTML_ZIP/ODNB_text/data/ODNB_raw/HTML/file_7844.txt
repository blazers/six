<div class="para">
<span class="headword">D'Orsay,  G&eacute;d&eacute;on Gaspard Alfred de Grimaud <span class="st"> [Alfred Guillaume Gabriel]</span></span>, styled Count D'Orsay  (1801&#150;1852), <span class="occ">artist and dandy</span>, was born in Paris on 4 September 1801, second son of Albert, Count D'Orsay, a general in Napoleon's <i>grand arm&eacute;e</i>, and Eleanore de Franquemont, an illegitimate daughter of the duke of W&uuml;rtemburg and an Italian adventuress, Anne Franchi. His elder brother died in infancy. As befitted the son of a general, but against his staunchly imperial sympathies, Alfred D'Orsay joined the army of the restored Bourbon monarchy in 1821 with a commission in the <i>garde du corps</i>, shortly before embarking for England to attend the coronation of George IV. In England, he quickly gained a reputation as a dandy, as his biographer W. Teignmouth Shore observed: &#145;It was &hellip; no small feather in D'Orsay's cap that he came to London an unknown man, was seen, and by his very rivals at once acknowledged as a conqueror. His youth, his handsome face, his debonairness, his wit, were irresistible&#146;  (Shore, 36).<br>
<br>D'Orsay returned to France the following year and was quartered with his regiment at Valence on the Rh&ocirc;ne, where, on 15 November 1822, he first became acquainted with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2640/', "Marguerite Gardiner, countess of Blessington")</script>, and her husband, the first earl. He accepted their invitation to travel with them and resigned his commission. On 31 March 1823 they arrived at Genoa where they met Byron, who sat to D'Orsay for his last portrait. Byron found him &#145;clever, original, unpretending &hellip; he affected to be nothing that he was not&#146;  (Shore, 51). Also at Genoa, on 31 August 1823, Lord Blessington made his will, leaving all his Irish property to the daughter of his first marriage, provided she married D'Orsay. The fifteen-year-old Lady Harriet Anne Jane Frances Gardiner (1812&#150;1869) was married to D'Orsay at Naples on 1 December 1827. The couple put up no false front of happiness: they were cold, distant, and barely civil to each other. D'Orsay's interest in his new wife was merely financial; his romantic interest was in Lady Blessington. Their affair had begun some time before the marriage, and, although the earl could hardly have remained in ignorance of it, he took no action. Indeed, the possible relationships between the members of this <i>m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois</i> have produced speculations that it was Blessington who was D'Orsay's admirer, and that D'Orsay himself was impotent  (Sadleir, 44&#150;8).<br>
<br>From Italy, the entourage moved on to Paris, where Lord Blessington died on 23 May 1829. The following year the family returned to London. Although Lady Harriet left D'Orsay and returned to her relatives in Ireland in 1831, her husband seems to have been undisturbed by either their estrangement or the scandal it caused. He busied himself by acting as host of Lady Blessington's fashionable, though bohemian, salon, first at Seamore Place, Mayfair, and then at Gore House, Piccadilly. Together they wielded a kind of influence over the artistic world of London, and gathered around them many of the social and literary celebrities of their time. Despite their precautions (D'Orsay officially lived not at Gore House, but next door) their affair was common knowledge, and had the effect of keeping away from the salon anybody with pretensions to moral respectability.<br>
<br>In London, D'Orsay was both a sculptor and a painter, specializing in portraiture. In 1845 he painted the portrait of Wellington, who is said to have exclaimed, &#145;At last I have been painted like a gentleman!&#146;, adding immediately, &#145;I'll never sit to any one else!&#146;  (Shore, 232). His statuettes of Napoleon and Wellington were very popular, as were engravings of many of his portraits, including those of Queen Victoria, Dwarkanath Tagore, and Lord Lyndhurst. More than 125 profile sketches of his contemporaries were published by Mitchell of Bond Street, including among them nearly all the artistic, literary, and fashionable celebrities of the time. Some sixty-one of his pencil and chalk portraits are in the National Portrait Gallery, as are the 1845 portrait of Wellington and a self-portrait in marble.<br>
<br>D'Orsay was chronically irresponsible about money: &#145;he never denied himself that which he could obtain for love or by owing money&#146;  (Shore, 131&#150;2). Handsome, perhaps beautiful, he early developed a taste for elegant living, but had no family money to support his tastes; highly vain and profoundly selfish, he assumed he had an entitlement to live as he wished. Sadleir comments that D'Orsay decided to &#145;capitalise his only assets, sell his looks and fascination to the best possible advantage&#146;  (Sadleir, 47). The number of his creditors suggests he did this to some effect. He used some of the money he borrowed for philanthropic purposes, and was one of the founders of the London Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de Bienfaisance, but far more went on the gaming tables, the racetrack, his clothes, horses, and carriages. In 1838, in exchange for a legal separation and his relinquishing of all claims to the Blessington estate, Lady Harriet paid over &pound;100,000 to his creditors&#151;and yet still unpaid debts remained.<br>
<br>More important in D'Orsay's estimation than paying the debts he had incurred, was the frequenting of Gore House by the exiled Louis Napoleon (later Napoleon III). An intimate friendship grew up between the two Frenchmen, or so D'Orsay, the loyal Bonapartist, thought. Other regulars at Gore House by 1840 included Disraeli, Bulwer, Ainsworth, Dickens, Thackeray, and Marryat, drawn in part at least by D'Orsay's charm. Considered the &#145;prince of dandies&#146;, and widely regarded as the handsomest man in England (although French), his dandyism served no ulterior motive; unlike his admirer Disraeli, whose &#145;amateur&#146; dandyism was always a means to a political end. Indeed, Disraeli included a favourable portrait of D'Orsay (as Count Mirabel) in his 1837 novel, <span class="italic">Henrietta Temple</span>. Even Tennyson was charmed: &#145;Count D'Orsay is a friend of mine, co-godfather to Dickens's child with me&#146;  (Shore, 266); the child rejoiced in the name Alfred D'Orsay Tennyson Dickens.<br>
<br>And still the debts mounted. By 1849, D'Orsay could no longer avoid his creditors, and, like the previous &#145;prince of dandies&#146;, Beau Brummell, he fled to France. Lady Blessington admitted defeat, sold almost all of her possessions, and joined him in Paris, where she died shortly after her arrival. Her death was a blow from which D'Orsay never fully recovered. Louis Napoleon had also returned to France from exile, and had been elected president of the new republic in 1848. D'Orsay hoped for an appointment from him, as the reward of loyalty and friendship, but Louis Napoleon was reluctant to entrust to him any affairs of state. The president finally offered him the position of director of the Beaux-Arts. Within a few months of the appointment, however, D'Orsay contracted a spinal infection, which was to prove fatal. He died on 4 August 1852 in the house of his sister Ida, duchesse de Gramont. His erstwhile friend, now Napoleon III, was conspicuous among the mourners at his funeral. D'Orsay was buried next to Lady Blessington in the grey stone pyramid which he had designed and built for her at Chambourcy, near St Germain-en-Laye.<br>
