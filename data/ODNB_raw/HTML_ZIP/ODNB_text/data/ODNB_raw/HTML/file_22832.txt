<span class="headword">Proby,  John Joshua</span>, first earl of Carysfort  (1751&#150;1828), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 12 August 1751, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22831/', "John Proby, first Baron Carysfort in the peerage of Ireland (1720&#150;1772)")</script>, politician, and his wife, the Hon. Elizabeth Allen (<i>bap</i>. 1722, <i>d</i>. 1783), elder daughter of Joshua Allen, second Viscount Allen, and Margaret Du Pass. He was educated at Westminster School (<i>c</i>.1764&#150;<i>c</i>.1767) and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated MA in 1770. He succeeded his father as second Baron Carysfort on 18 October 1772, and took his seat on 12 October 1773 in the Irish House of Lords, where he soon became a prominent debater. On 19 March 1774 he married Elizabeth Osborne (<i>d</i>. 1783), daughter of Sir William Osborne, eighth baronet, MP, of Newtown, co. Tipperary, and Elizabeth Christmas. They had three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>On 2 March 1780 Carysfort joined Lord Charlemont and others in protesting against the address, and in February 1780 he wrote a letter &#145;to the gentlemen of the Huntingdonshire committee&#146;, which was subsequently printed and distributed by the Society of Constitutional Information, advocating the shortening of parliaments, a fuller representation of the people, and &#145;a strict &#339;conomy of the public treasure&#146;. He intended to contest the University of Cambridge at the general election in that year, but he did not go to the poll. He was elected a knight of St Patrick on 5 February 1784, and installed in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, on 11 August 1800. Carysfort opposed the Fox&#150;North coalition in 1783, even though he had previously been leader of the administration in the Irish House of Lords. He rejected a peerage from the Foxite whigs, but accepted an offer from the duke of Rutland, Pitt's viceroy in Ireland. His political allegiance was confirmed by his second marriage, on 12 April 1787, to Elizabeth Grenville (1756&#150;1842), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11489/', "George Grenville")</script> and Elizabeth Wyndham (<i>d</i>. 1769) and sister of the marquess of Buckingham, the new lord lieutenant, and of William Grenville, Pitt's foreign secretary. Henceforward, he was a steadfast supporter of Pitt and Grenville. On 16 February 1789 he protested against the opposition address to the prince of Wales requesting him to exercise the royal authority in Ireland during the king's illness. As a reward for his support of the lord lieutenant's policy he was appointed, on 15 July, joint guardian and keeper of the rolls in Ireland, and was sworn a member of the Irish privy council. On 20 August 1789, in fulfilment of an engagement by the previous viceroy, the duke of Rutland, he was created earl of Carysfort in the peerage of Ireland at his wife's insistence, after Buckingham had persuaded him to withdraw his pretensions.<br>
<br>Carysfort was ambitious to follow his father as member for Huntingdonshire, but the representation of the county was monopolized by Lord Sandwich and the duke of Manchester and he had to settle for the purchase of a seat at East Looe, Cornwall, in 1790 on the recommendation of Buckingham. When parliament was dissolved at the end of the session, he was nominated by Lord Exeter for the borough of Stamford as a compensation for not &#145;disturbing the peace&#146; of Huntingdonshire by challenging the predominant interests  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>). He continued to represent Stamford until he was made a peer of the United Kingdom. In April 1791 he supported Wilberforce's motion for the abolition of the slave trade, and he opposed Fox's amendment to the address on 14 December 1792, declaring that, though a friend to moderate reform, he would have no truck with French extremism. He warmly advocated the claims of the Irish Roman Catholics, who had &#145;the same interests as the protestants, and ought to have the same privileges&#146;, as a reward for their loyalty to the existing orders  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 30.78&#150;9). He supported the address to the king in November 1797, and maintained that the French government was founded on a system of &#145;monstrous ambition and exorbitant pretensions&#146; which were &#145;hostile to the re-establishment of tranquillity&#146;  (ibid., 33.1017&#150;18).<br>
<br>Carysfort was in Ireland when the rising broke out in 1798. He declared that the time was ripe for a union of Great Britain and Ireland, and on 21 April 1800 he described Pitt's measure as &#145;wise, politic, and advantageous to the two countries&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 35.83). He expected a British peerage in return for his support, and he duly received a United Kingdom barony as Baron Carysfort of Norman Cross, Huntingdonshire, on 21 January 1801. He took his seat in the Lords on 27 November 1802. Meanwhile, Grenville had sent him as envoy-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary to Berlin on 24 May 1800, a post which he retained until October 1802. He supported Grenville after the latter's resignation from office with Pitt and continued to do so for the remainder of his career. On 20 January 1805 he attacked the foreign policy of Pitt's second ministry, and moved an amendment to the address, but was defeated by fifty-three votes.<br>
<br>On the formation of the &#145;ministry of all the talents&#146; in February 1806 Carysfort was sworn of the privy council (12 February) and became joint postmaster-general (20 February). On 18 June he was further appointed a member of the Board of Trade, and on 16 July, a commissioner of the board of control. He resigned these three offices on the accession of the duke of Portland to power in the spring of the following year. He signed a protest against the bombardment of Copenhagen on 3 March 1808. He retained his interest in Ireland and on 31 January 1812 he spoke in favour of Lord Fitzwilliam's motion for the consideration of the state of Irish affairs. He supported the second reading of the <span class="roman">Preservation of the Peace in Ireland Bill</span>, but spoke at length against the Irish <span class="roman">Seditious Meetings Bill</span> in July 1814. He spoke for the last time in the House of Lords on 23 November 1819.<br>
<br>Carysfort, who wrote a pamphlet on parliamentary reform, published in 1783, and a collection of poems and dramatic works, was &#145;esteemed a good and elegant scholar&#146;, but as a speaker &#145;his utterance is disagreeably slow, tedious and hesitating, perpetually interrupted by the interjections Ah! Ah!&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 3.71). He died at his house in Upper Grosvenor Street, London, on 7 April 1828, aged seventy-six. He was buried in Elton church, Huntingdonshire, where a tablet was erected to his memory. His second wife survived him and died at Huntercombe, near Maidenhead, on 21 December 1842, aged eighty-six. Of the five children from his first marriage, his eldest son, William Allen, Viscount Proby, MP for Buckingham from 1802 to 1804, was a naval captain and died of yellow fever at Surinam on 6 August 1804 while commanding the frigate <i>Amelia</i>. His second son, John Proby, a general in the army, succeeded as second earl of Carysfort, and died unmarried and insane on 11 June 1855, when the title passed to his younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22830/', "Granville Leveson Proby, third earl of Carysfort (1781&#150;1868)")</script>, a naval officer.<br>
