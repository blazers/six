<span class="headword">Wyatt,  Samuel</span>  (1737&#150;1807), <span class="occ">architect and engineer</span>, was born on 8 September 1737 at Blackbrook Farm, Weeford, Staffordshire, the third of the seven sons and two daughters of Benjamin Wyatt (<i>d</i>. 1772), farmer and timber merchant of Weeford, who also practised as a builder and architect, and his wife, Mary Wright. Samuel began in his father's business as a carpenter, thus earning the nickname the Chip. In 1760 he was employed, first as carpenter and then as clerk of works, at the building of Kedleston Hall, Derbyshire, under Robert Adam, an experience which constituted his architectural education. In 1768 he returned to Weeford; he was first employed as an architect in 1769, on an addition to Blithfield Hall, Staffordshire. He began a close association with his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30105/', "James Wyatt (1746&#150;1813)")</script> after the latter's return from an Italian grand tour, notably at the Pantheon in Oxford Street, London (1769&#150;71), where the domed interior put into practice on a larger scale constructional lessons learned in the saloon at Kedleston. After the death of their father in 1772, the family firm passed to their eldest brother, William; in 1774 Samuel and James each set up independent practices as architects in London.<br>
<br>Samuel Wyatt's career included business as a building contractor and timber merchant as well as architecture, in which he was predominantly concerned with medium-sized country houses: Doddington Hall, Cheshire (1777&#150;98), Hooton Hall, Cheshire (1778&#150;88; dem.), Herstmonceux Place, Sussex (1777), and Belmont Park, Kent (1787&#150;92). He was also extensively employed in designing and building London houses, and made a speciality of the design of model farm buildings, including nearly fifty at Holkham for Thomas William Coke of Norfolk, first earl of Leicester. Other ambitious farm buildings by Wyatt can be found at Sandon, Staffordshire, Thorndon, Essex, and Somerley, Hampshire. During the 1780s he was manager and principal promoter, as well as builder and architect, of the Albion flour mill at Blackfriars. This was the most advanced industrial building of its time, designed to be steam-powered (with engines supplied by Samuel's partners in the enterprise, Matthew Boulton and James Watt). It was one of the first such buildings to incorporate a brick raft foundation, here intended to spread the downward load on the soft Thames bank. The street frontage incorporated Wyatt's own house. The mill burnt down in 1791. Wyatt was appointed surveyor of Trinity House, and clerk of works at Chelsea Hospital in 1792, and surveyor of Ramsgate harbour in 1794. In 1793 he was appointed surveyor to the Royal Mint, but was dismissed in 1794 for inattention to duty.<br>
<br>Wyatt's architectural work was predominantly in a chaste neo-classical manner, with the use of domed segmental projections; in his interiors he made play with geometrical plans, displaying a liking for oval and octagonal spaces which derived originally from Adam. In some of his later work, such as Trinity House at Tower Hill, London (1793&#150;6), his finest urban building, and Hackwood Park, Hampshire (1805&#150;7), he developed a simpler and more monumental style. He saw himself as an engineer architect, and designed a number of lighthouses, three of them&#151;Longships, Cornwall (1792), St Agnes, Isles of Scilly (1806), and Flamborough Head, Yorkshire&#151;as part of his lighthouse duties, one at Dungeness, Kent (1792), for a private client, Thomas Coke of Norfolk, and one (dem.) for Ramsgate harbour, where he was responsible for a series of buildings on the quayside. He experimented with cast iron, and made extensive use of Coade stone and also of slate&#151;from the Penrhyn quarries managed by his brother Benjamin (<i>d</i>. 1818)&#151;for cladding and other purposes. He invented a &#145;sympathetic hinge&#146; by which both leaves of a double door opened simultaneously, and in 1787 devised a prefabricated &#145;movable hospital&#146; for use in the colonies. In 1799 he was consulted about a tunnel under the Thames, and in 1800 he submitted a proposal for a cast-iron replacement for London Bridge.<br>
<br>An unsympathetic contemporary, Humphry Repton, described Wyatt as &#145;slow, plodding, heavy in carriage, dull in conceiving the ideas of others and tedious in explaining his own&#146;  (H. Repton, &#145;Autobiography&#146;, BL, MS 62112, fol. 198), a portrait which was something of a libel on this progressively minded architect. Wyatt became a member of the Society for the Promotion of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, and of the Society of Civil Engineers. He was a close friend of many of the pioneer midlands industrialists, notably Matthew Boulton, whose house at Soho, Birmingham, was designed by James and Samuel Wyatt. In spite of the Albion mill disaster, he achieved his proclaimed ambition of making a fortune, largely out of his building business. In 1765 he married Ann Sherwin, daughter of the land agent at Kedleston Hall. They had no children, but on the death of his brother William in 1780 he adopted William's four-year-old daughter. Wyatt died suddenly of an &#145;apoplexy&#146; at the surveyor's house, Chelsea Hospital, on 8 February 1807 and was buried in the hospital cemetery.<br>
