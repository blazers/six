<span class="headword">Low, Sir  John</span>  (1788&#150;1880), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company and political officer in India</span>, born at Clatto, near Cupar, Fife, on 13 December 1788, was the eldest son of Captain Robert Low of Clatto, and his wife, the daughter of Dr Robert Malcolm. He was educated at St Andrews University, attending the sessions of 1802&#150;3, and in 1804 obtained a Madras cadetship on the nomination of J. Hudleston. On 17 July 1805 he was appointed lieutenant in the 1st Madras native infantry. For the part taken by six of its companies in the uprising at Vellore the regiment was disbanded in January 1807, the loyal men and the officers (Low included) being re-formed into the 24th Madras infantry; in 1816 it was renumbered the 1st Madras infantry, for its conduct at the battle of Sitabaldi. Low became captain in the regiment in 1820, major 17th Madras infantry (late 2nd battalion 24th Madras infantry) in 1828, and lieutenant-colonel 19th Madras infantry in 1834. In 1839 he obtained the colonelcy of the 1st Madras infantry, which he held up to his death.<br>
<br>Low saw in his early years varied military service. He was attached to the office of the quartermaster-general from 11 May 1810, rejoined his regiment in February 1811, was attached to the 59th regiment in the Java expedition of 1811, and was wounded at the storming of Fort Cornelis. He was afterwards brigade major in the Ceded Districts, and was Persian interpreter and head of the intelligence staff to Colonel Dowse in the southern Marattha country in 1812&#150;13; he was in commissariat charge of Brigadier William Tuyl's force sent against the Guntur rebels in 1816, and was present at the final defeat of the Maratthas at Mehidpur in Malwa, on 21 December 1817, as extra aide-de-camp to Sir John Malcolm. In March 1818, as first political assistant to Malcolm, he was employed with a force of over 3000 men and ten guns in pacifying the Chindwara district, and his services were afterwards publicly acknowledged. He efficiently performed the delicate task of inducing the peshwa, Baji Rao, to place himself under British protection; and when Baji Rao retired to Bithur, near Cawnpore, Low was appointed resident there. He filled that post for six years to the entire satisfaction of governors-general the marquess of Hastings and Lord Amherst. From that time onwards Low's services were chiefly political, although later at Lucknow and afterwards at Hyderabad his functions included the control of large local contingents of Indian troops. In 1825 he became political agent at Jaipur. In 1830 he was appointed by Lord William Henry Cavendish-Bentinck political agent at Gwalior, where he displayed much determination and wisdom in defeating the intrigues of the regent Ba&iuml;. In 1831 he was sent as resident to Lucknow. Low married in 1829 Augusta Ludlow, second daughter of John Talbot Shakespear of the Bengal civil service, and sister of Sir Richmond Shakespear, one of Low's assistants at Lucknow; they had four sons and two daughters. The eldest son, William Malcolm Low (1835&#150;1923), Bengal civil service, was Conservative MP for Grantham from 1886 to 1892. Another son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34607/', "General Sir Robert Cunliffe Low")</script>.<br>
<br>In 1837 the long misrule in Oudh caused the court of directors to agree to a proposal of Lord William Bentinck for the temporary assumption by the East India Company of the government of that state. Low was certain that this effective annexation would be misunderstood by the inhabitants, and suggested instead deposing the king and placing the heir-apparent on the throne. The new governor-general, Lord Auckland, left the decision to Low. Meanwhile the king died suddenly&#151;from poison, or possibly from strong drink. A pretender, the favourite of the late king's chief widow, had been placed on the throne, the palace and city swarmed with turbulent soldiers, and the rightful heir was a prisoner. Summoning a Bengal regiment to his aid, Low, after unsuccessful negotiation, had the gates of the palace blown open and the pretender seized. The rightful heir was then installed by the British resident. In recognition of his services Low received the special thanks of the court of directors, and was made CB (20 July 1838). Low was not the author of the Oudh treaty which was subsequently quashed. Ill health compelled him to return to Britain in 1842, after thirty-eight years of almost uninterrupted service in India.<br>
<br>Low returned to India in 1847, and in 1848 was appointed governor-general's agent in Rajputana and commissioner at Ajmer and Mewar, where he remained until 1852, when he was sent by Lord Dalhousie to Hyderabad, in succession to James Stuart Fraser, as resident with the nizam. There he negotiated the treaty by which Berar was assigned to the British government in return for the organization and maintenance of the Hyderabad subsidiary force. For his services on this occasion he again received the special thanks of the court of directors. On 22 September 1853 Low was appointed a member of council.<br>
<br>In 1854 he was promoted major-general. Low's experience of Indian princes was by then unrivalled. In two able minutes (both dated in February 1854) he protested against the impolicy and injustice of the Nagpur annexation; but on this, as on other occasions, his views were largely ignored by Dalhousie. In the deliberations that ended with the annexation of Oudh, Low strongly advocated interference, showing in a minute drawn up in March 1855 that the paramount government was bound, by considerations of justice as well as by treaty obligations, to interfere. The king, he showed, would never become an efficient ruler, and the non-enforcement of Lord Hardinge's threats of seven years previously had had a widespread influence for dissatisfaction and uncertainty. When, early in May 1857, news arrived of the mutinous refusal of the 7th Oudh irregulars to use the greased cartridges, Low advocated leniency. He refused to credit the troops with disloyalty or disaffection, but only with fear that biting the cartridges would injure their caste. The news of the outbreaks at Meerut and Delhi was received a day or two later, and Low&#151;in opposition, it is said, to his civilian colleagues&#151;advised a determined and immediate effort for the recovery of Delhi, an enterprise which might have cut short the uprising. In April 1858, when the rising was practically suppressed, Low returned to Britain, receiving, as on many previous occasions, the thanks of the government of India. Lord Canning described his services as &#145;invaluable&#146;, and acknowledged that he had exceptional knowledge of the people of India. Low was promoted lieutenant-general in 1859 and general in 1867, and was placed on the retired list in 1874. He was made KCB in 1862, and GCSI in 1873. He died at Strathallan, Upper Norwood, Surrey, on 10 January 1880, in his ninety-second year, and was buried at Kemback, Fife. His wife survived him.<br>
