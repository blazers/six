<span class="headword">Williams,  John</span>  (1792&#150;1858), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and classical scholar</span>, was the youngest child of John Williams, vicar of Ystradmeurig in Cardiganshire, and Jane, daughter of Lewis Rogers of Gelli, high sheriff of Cardiganshire. His father, <a name="cosubject_29519"></a><span class="headword">John Williams</span>  (1745&#150;1818), known as yr Hen Syr, <span class="occ">Anglican clergyman and schoolmaster</span>, was the eldest son of David Williams of Swyddffynnon, one of the earliest &#145;exhorters&#146; among the Welsh Methodists. He was educated at Ystradmeurig grammar school under Edward Richard, whom he later succeeded as master in 1778. Under his mastership Ystradmeurig became for a time the leading school in Wales. Ordained deacon in 1768 and priest in 1770, he also held several clerical appointments in the diocese of St David's and was the author of <span class="italic">A Dissertation on the Pelagian Heresy</span> (1808). Two of his brothers, Evan and Thomas, established a publishing business in the Strand, London (1792&#150;1835), which brought out a large number of books relating to Wales; another brother, David (1751&#150;1836), was the father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29489/', "Charles James Blasius Williams")</script>. During his latter years John Williams senior was assisted, and eventually succeeded, at Ystradmeurig School by his eldest son, David (1785?&#150;1825), a fellow of Wadham College, Oxford.<br>
<br>John Williams (the youngest son) was born at Ystradmeurig on 11 April 1792. He was educated chiefly at his father's school, then started teaching at the age of fifteen at Chiswick School, Chiswick, Middlesex, and at Ludlow School before going up to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1810 to read classics. He graduated BA with first-class honours in 1814 (DD, 1831; MA, 1838). In 1814 Williams was appointed a tutor at Winchester College, and personal assistant to the headmaster, Dr Henry Dison Gabell. His next four years were unhappy: he was the first non-Wykehamist to be appointed, and was greatly resented by the governing body of New College, Oxford, and by the staff and pupils. Unrest at the school culminated in the &#145;schoolboy rebellion&#146; in 1818, when the pupils locked themselves in and occupied the roof, and the military had to be called in. John Williams was made the scapegoat and was forced to resign. Gabell was later (1824) to provide for Williams a glowing testimonial which refuted the Wykehamists' slanders.<br>
<br>Williams then taught for two years at Hyde Abbey School in Winchester (1818&#150;20). In 1820, following the death of Eliezer Williams, vicar of Lampeter, Thomas Burgess (1756&#150;1837), bishop of St David's, appointed Williams vicar of Lampeter, in Cardiganshire, and master of Lampeter grammar school, a private or &#145;adventure&#146; school which had been established a few years earlier by Eliezer Williams. It had already an excellent reputation; it had eighty pupils (including fifteen divinity students) and two assistant masters. John Williams added to the school's lustre, and seems to have moved it to better accommodation on the Falcondale estate on the outskirts of the town. Lampeter was subsequently chosen for a new theological college in the diocese of St David's&#151;St David's College, Lampeter&#151;which opened in 1827. John Williams had hoped to become its first principal, but became involved in a crucial disagreement with Bishop Burgess about the precise nature of the new college.<br>
<br>While he was at Lampeter in the early 1820s he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 16 Aug 1854), only daughter of Thomas Evans of Llanilar, Cardiganshire. They had six daughters; the eldest, Jane Eliza, in 1861 married Major Walter Colquhoun-Grant, 2nd dragoon guards, who died the same year in India; subsequently she became lady principal of Kidderpore House, Calcutta, where she died in 1895.<br>
<br>One of John Williams's closest friends at Balliol had been John Gibson Lockhart, the future son-in-law and biographer of Walter Scott. In 1820, presumably on Lockhart's recommendation, Scott sent his second son, Charles, to Lampeter as a private pupil to be tutored for entrance to Oxford; Scott was so impressed with Williams that Lampeter soon received the sons of other eminent Scotsmen, including William Forbes Mackenzie, the son of Colin Mackenzie, the deputy keeper of the signet.<br>
<br>Scott and Mackenzie were two of the leading protagonists in the establishment of a new proprietary day school in Edinburgh, the Edinburgh Academy, in 1824. It was intended to raise the standard of classical education in Scotland and to put Scottish pupils on an equal footing with boys from English public schools for entry to English universities. Scott wrote to Williams asking for advice about a suitable candidate for the rectorship; to his surprise and delight, Williams (realizing that he had no prospects in Lampeter) offered himself as a candidate. Scott, a tory, lobbied tirelessly to have him appointed in the face of stiff opposition from some of the whig directors of the school. His campaign paid off, and Williams was appointed to the post five months before the school opened on 1 October 1824.<br>
<br>Williams's rectorship was an outstanding success. In September 1827, however, he suddenly resigned to become professor of Roman language and literature in the new London University. It was an unfortunate decision: he had hoped for ecclesiastical preferment by forging a link between this new secular college and the Church of England. He soon discovered, however, that the church wanted nothing to do with &#145;that godless institution in Gower Street&#146;&#151;indeed, Anglicans were planning a new Anglican institution, King's College, so before he had taken up his chair Williams resigned it. Scott and his fellow directors of the Edinburgh Academy were dismayed. In his <span class="italic">Journal</span> (26 June 1828) Scott noted:<blockquote>Wrote a long letter to Lockhart about Williams' situation saying how by sitting betwixt two stools he<div> 
<br>
</div>
<div>&#151;had fallen with heavy thump<br>
</div>
<div>Upon his reverential rump.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Williams stayed on in Edinburgh, working on his notes for <span class="italic">The Life and Actions of Alexander the Great</span> (1829) and for his magnum opus, <span class="italic">Homerus</span> (1842), on the essential unity of the Homeric poems. His successor as rector of the Edinburgh Academy (the Revd Thomas Sheepshanks) proved disastrous and resigned in May 1829. Williams was reappointed and stayed on as rector until 1847 (although he applied unsuccessfully for the post of headmaster of the King Edward VI Free School at Birmingham in 1838).<br>
<br>When he retired the directors praised him in their 1847 <span class="italic">Report</span>:<blockquote>He leaves the School, matured chiefly through him, in an admirable system. He has exhibited in his own Classes a model of perfect teaching, and he has established witnesses of his kindness, vigour and success, in grateful and eminent pupils, scattered over every quarter of the globe.</blockquote>His &#145;grateful and eminent pupils&#146; included: Archibald Campbell Tait (dux of the school in 1826 and 1827), who became archbishop of Canterbury (1869&#150;82); James Clerk Maxwell (1831&#150;1879), the great Scottish physicist; Peter Guthrie Tait (1831&#150;1901), the mathematician; Edward James Harland (1831&#150;1896), who established the shipbuilding firm of Harland and Wolff; John Campbell Shairp, principal of St Andrews University and later professor of poetry at Oxford; and a host of others.<br>
<br>Williams and Scott remained close friends. In his <span class="italic">Journal</span> Scott recorded his admiration for Williams: &#145;Mr Williams was there, whose extensive information, learning and lively talent makes him always pleasant company&#146;  (29 June 1827); &#145;he is a heaven-born teacher&#146;  (28 Aug 1827); &#145;the best Schoolmaster in Europe&#146;  (25 June 1828). Williams also had a special interest in the early history of the Celtic races, and particularly of the language and literature of Wales, and his enthusiastic conversations with Scott on Welsh history prompted the writing of <span class="italic">The Betrothed</span> (1825), Scott's only Welsh romance. On Scott's death in 1832 Williams conducted the funeral service in the ruins of Dryburgh Abbey.<br>
<br>During his years at Edinburgh Williams maintained his connections with Wales and his concern for his Welsh heritage. In 1833 he was appointed archdeacon of Cardigan (albeit an absentee). He hoped to return to an ecclesiastical or educational post in Wales, and in 1836 considered resigning the rectorship to work on literature and a history of Wales. Since its foundation in 1837 he was associated with the Welsh Manuscript Society. He would have left Edinburgh earlier if offered a suitable Welsh ecclesiastical preferment, and in 1840 was very disappointed at not being appointed bishop of St David's. He continued to hope for a see. A few weeks after he retired from the Edinburgh Academy in 1847 he was appointed, reportedly through the influence of Benjamin Hall, the first warden of a new school at Llandovery, in Carmarthenshire, the Thomas Phillips Foundation at Llandovery (also called the Welsh Education Institution, now Llandovery College), which had just been endowed by Thomas Phillips (1760&#150;1851), to teach not only the usual classical curriculum, but also Welsh and science, and to provide the church with Welsh-speaking clergy. The school opened in temporary accommodation in March 1848, pending permanent buildings which were completed by May 1851; Williams's prestige was crucial in raising the necessary funds. Williams wanted to develop the school into a collegiate institution which might supersede the college at Lampeter. He and Benjamin Hall openly attacked Lampeter for the inefficiency of its training and its neglect of Welsh studies. By the time ill health forced Williams to retire in 1853 he had raised Llandovery to prominence among the schools of Wales.<br>
<br>The last five years of Williams's life were devoted chiefly to literary work. He resided in Brighton, and for three months in 1853 he stood in for one of his old pupils, Frederick Robertson, at Trinity Chapel. Subsequently he lived in Oxford, but in 1857 he went to Bushey Heath, in Hertfordshire, where he died on 27 December 1858 and was buried on 4 January 1859 in Bushey churchyard. He was considered one of the greatest classical scholars Wales has produced. The man who ministered to him at the end and conducted the funeral service was his most distinguished pupil, Archibald Campbell Tait, then bishop of London.<br>
<br>At his death Williams left behind him several unfinished works, including some slight portions of an autobiography (<span class="italic">Bye-gones</span>, 1874, 159). His eldest daughter, Mrs Colquhoun-Grant, acted as his literary executor and collected further materials for biographical purposes, but most of his papers and correspondence were lost in July 1878 in the wreck of the steamship <i>Europa</i>, in which she was returning from India, off the coast of Spain.<br>
