<span class="headword">Williams,  Eliezer</span>  (1754&#150;1820), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and genealogist</span>, was born at Pibwr-lwyd, Llangynnwr, near Carmarthen, and baptized in Llandyfaelog church, Carmarthenshire, on 4 October 1754. He was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29534/', "Peter Williams (1723&#150;1796)")</script>, Methodist minister, and his wife, Mary Jenkins (1726&#150;1822), and was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29536/', "Peter Bailey Williams (1763&#150;1836)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29534/', "Williams, Peter")</script>]. After an elementary education at home, he was educated in the free grammar school of Carmarthen. About 1770, while he was still at school, he assisted in preparing for publication the annotations of his father's Welsh Bible and his <span class="italic">Mynegeir Ysgrythurol</span> (&#145;Welsh concordance&#146;) (1773).<br>
<br>Williams matriculated at Jesus College, Oxford, on 3 April 1775, and graduated BA in 1778 and MA in 1781. He became curate of Trelech, and was ordained deacon in 1777; subsequently he accepted the curacy of Tetsworth, Oxfordshire, and in December 1778 he was admitted to priest's orders. Soon afterwards he was chosen second master of the grammar school at Wallingford, Berkshire, and he also undertook the cure of Acton, a village in the neighbourhood. In 1780 he was appointed chaplain of her majesty's ship <i>Cambridge</i>, then under the command of Admiral Keith Stewart, and he became tutor to Lord Garlies (afterwards earl of Galloway), who was nephew of the admiral and midshipman in the same ship.<br>
<br>After being two or three years at sea Williams, at the request of Lord Galloway, relinquished his chaplaincy and became tutor in the earl's family in Galloway House. He was afterwards presented by Lord Chancellor Thurlow to the vicarage of Cynwyl Gaeo with Llansawel, Carmarthenshire, to which he was instituted on 14 September 1784. After going to London, he became evening lecturer at All Hallows, Lombard Street, and chaplain and private secretary to a gentleman named Blakeney. He assisted in investigating the pedigree of the ancestors of the earl of Galloway for the purpose of establishing the earl's claim to the English peerage, and ultimately his labours were crowned with success. About 1794 he published <span class="italic">A Genealogical Account of Lord Galloway's Family</span>, and this was followed by three other similar works.<br>
<br>Williams married first, in 1792, Anne Adelaide Grebert (<i>d</i>. 1796), a native of Nancy in Lorraine; and secondly, in 1796, Jane Amelia Nugent, daughter of St George Armstrong of Annaduff, near Drumsna, co. Leitrim (she died on 31 December 1811).<br>
<br>On the death of his patron in 1799 Williams moved to Chadwell St Mary's, Essex, of which parish he became the curate; and in addition he held the appointment of chaplain to the garrison of Tilbury Fort. Soon afterwards he published anonymously <span class="italic">Nautical Odes</span>, commemorating the achievements of the British navy. On 14 July 1805 he was inducted to the vicarage of Lampeter, Cardiganshire. There he opened a grammar school for the education of young men, with a view to their entering the church. He ran this institution with great success for nearly fourteen years.<br>
<br>Williams died at Lampeter on 20 January 1820 and was buried there. His <span class="italic">English Works</span> was published in London in 1840, with a memoir by his son from his second marriage, St George Armstrong Williams. These works include several essays on subjects of Welsh and Celtic interest which reveal his attachment to his native land.<br>
