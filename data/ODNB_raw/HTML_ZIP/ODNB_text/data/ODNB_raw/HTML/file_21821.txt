<span class="headword">Pemberton, Sir  Francis</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1624, <em>d.</em> 1697), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was baptized at St Albans on 18 July 1624, son of Ralph Pemberton, mayor of St Albans in 1627&#150;8, and of Frances, daughter of Francis Kempe. Pemberton studied at St Albans grammar school before entering Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in August 1640; he graduated BA in 1644 and in November of that year moved to the Inner Temple. His father and brother supported parliament in the civil war and served on county committees in Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire, but Francis continued his studies, although he also spent some of this period in gaol for debt. Roger North suggested that incarceration was just what the young man needed to focus his mind on learning the law and that his fellow inmates provided him with his first opportunities to give legal counsel.<br>
<br>On 7 November 1654 Pemberton received his call to the bar. Little is known of his life in the decade following, though his practice grew sufficiently to permit his marriage on 12 October 1667 to Anne Whichcott (<i>d</i>. 1731), a London widow. Her father, Sir Jeremy Whichcott, settled the manor of Milton, Cambridgeshire, upon the couple. In the years following Pemberton bought Trumpington and other lands and manors in the area; in 1692 he extended this estate by buying up properties there from his recently bankrupted brother-in-law.<br>
<br>By the late 1660s Pemberton had earned a high professional reputation. In 1668 he assisted in the prosecution of the Bawdy House rioters for treason. Pepys described him as &#145;an able lawyer&#146; in his handling of a prize case, and noted the &#145;heaps of money&#146; on his table, though he later complained of Pemberton's sloppy work  (Pepys, 9.61, 63). But Pemberton prospered: he was chosen a bencher of the Inner Temple in 1671 and Lent reader of his inn in 1674; he became a serjeant-at-law on 21 April 1675.<br>
<br>In May and June 1675 an angry House of Commons attacked Pemberton for a breach of privilege because he had appeared as counsel in the House of Lords in property litigation involving Thomas Dalmahoy, a member of the Commons. Sir Nicholas Crisp had asked Pemberton to serve as his counsel before the Lords; aware that Dalmahoy was an MP, Pemberton initially declined the request, but the Lords then ordered him to represent Crispe. When he did so, the Commons responded by voting by 154 to 146 to commit Pemberton and his co-counsel for a breach of the lower house's privilege. But the confinement order apparently meant little, for a few days later the speaker of the House of Commons encountered Pemberton in Westminster Hall where he neglected to doff his hat to the speaker. When Pemberton and his fellow counsel were imprisoned again, the Lords issued a writ of habeas corpus for their release. Pemberton, caught in a feud between the two houses, was trapped between contending claims about whose writs of habeas corpus or orders of commitment should be obeyed. Only parliament's prorogation on 9 June brought his release, though not a resolution to the question of precedence raised by the dispute. Later that year Pemberton nearly found himself in a similar contest between Lords and Commons when asked to provide counsel in the Lords for Dr Thomas Shirley against Sir John Fagg, another MP, though this time Pemberton appears to have avoided serving.<br>
<br>The remainder of 1675 looked brighter: on 12 August Pemberton became king's serjeant, and on 6 October he was knighted. On 1 May 1679, upon a general reformation of the bench in Westminster Hall, Pemberton was made a justice of king's bench. He thus was one of those presiding in the early Popish Plot trials, including that of Sir George Wakeman. In the libel trial of the bookseller Benjamin Harris, only Pemberton's insistence prevented Chief Justice Sir William Scroggs from imposing a whipping as well as a heavy fine. By October 1679 rumours were already about that he would resign or be removed. On 16 February 1680 Pemberton was indeed removed for being &#145;too much opposite to the court interest&#146;  (Luttrell, 1.36), perhaps because he told the king there were limits to his power to continue collecting the excise.<br>
<br>In later years Gilbert Burnet suggested that Scroggs's dislike of Pemberton led to his removal from the bench. If so, Pemberton must have been delighted when Scroggs himself was removed and Pemberton replaced him as chief justice of king's bench on 11 April 1681. Despite the change, at least one observer thought that &#145;Pemberton is as great a rogue as his predecessor&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1680&#150;81</i>, 270). His first important task, in May, was to preside in the trial of Edward Fitzharris, which some believed Pemberton had been specially appointed to handle. Declaring Fitzharris's libel &#145;a piece of the art of the Jesuits&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 8.386) Pemberton sent him off to his execution.<br>
<br>At the same time Pemberton was called upon to release the earl of Danby from imprisonment according to a royal pardon. But Pemberton answered the earl's request by noting that as Danby had been committed on a charge in one court&#151;parliament&#151;the chief justice of another court&#151;king's bench&#151;could not take notice of a pardon delivered to him. When the attorney-general, Sir Robert Sawyer, again pleaded Danby's pardon, Pemberton answered that the king had declared he would rule according to law, and thus he would make the law his rule in this matter as in all others. Pemberton remanded the earl. After his return from the assize circuits, where he had energetically pursued alleged Catholics, Pemberton proved just as tough on the earl of Shaftesbury during his arraignment for treason. That autumn Pemberton provided a damning summation of the evidence against Lord Grey of Warke for his liaison with Lady Henrietta Berkeley, for which Grey was convicted, though the judgment against him was never entered.<br>
<br>Pemberton's star was rising at court, where he was reportedly a favourite of the queen. Some talked of his being made lord chancellor in the spring of 1682. Though this came to nothing, Pemberton took the oath of a privy councillor in December of that year and was made chief justice of common pleas the month following. While a more lucrative office, it is not clear that this move was a promotion. Having heard the initial pleadings in the <i>quo warranto</i> against London in king's bench, many thought Pemberton had been translated to common pleas for fear that he would rule against the crown after full arguments had been heard. As Roger North later opined, Pemberton &#145;never showed so much regard to the law as to his will&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lives</span>, 2.40), and thus was not trusted in so important a matter. None the less, Pemberton did preside over the trial of Lord Russell for treason, and though his summation of the evidence could not have helped Russell in the jurors' eyes, Pemberton was not thought vigorous enough against Russell. Pemberton was again removed from the bench in September 1683; his exit from the privy council soon followed. There was little left for him but to return to his lucrative practice.<br>
<br>Pemberton continued his involvement in the leading legal actions of the day though he, like others, refused to serve as counsel to Arthur Godden when he sued Sir Edward Hales in a case testing the king's claim to have a power to dispense with statutory requirements meant to bar Catholics from office. Pemberton offered his strong opinion against the legality of the grant of a university degree to a Benedictine monk, Alban Francis, without the requisite oaths. And in June 1688 Pemberton declaimed against the dispensing power when he served as one of the counsel defending the seven bishops on the charge that they had libelled the king.<br>
<br>After the revolution of 1688 Pemberton found himself once again the target of parliamentary ire for a judgment he had given years earlier that allegedly breached the privileges of the house. He suffered another brief spell as the Commons' prisoner. But Pemberton soon continued his successful legal practice, arguing important matters in the House of Lords and elsewhere until June 1697, when, while attending hearings in Westminster Hall, he contracted a cold. Pemberton died on 10 June 1697 at his house in Highgate, survived by his wife and seven of their eleven children. He was buried at Highgate Chapel, from which his monument was removed to Trumpington when the chapel was demolished in 1833. In his typically priggish manner, Roger North declared Pemberton's morals &#145;debauched&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lives</span>, 2.38). But John Evelyn reports that at the time of his departure from the bench in 1683 Pemberton was considered &#145;the very learnedst of the judges and an honest man&#146;  (Evelyn, 3.342). Twice imprisoned by a zealous Commons and twice appointed to and removed from the judiciary in a period in which the bench was regularly broken up, Pemberton proved himself an able lawyer and a prudent judge, rarely pleasing and often offending people of all political persuasions.<br>
