<span class="headword">Lucas,  James</span>  (1813&#150;1874), <span class="occ">eccentric</span>, was born on 21 December 1813 in Hackney, Middlesex, the second (but first surviving) son and fourth child of James Lucas, a wealthy West India merchant and partner in the Liverpool-based firm of Chauncey, Lucas, and Lang, and his wife, whose maiden name was Beesly. He was educated at a private school in Clapham, from which he ran away at the age of fourteen, and then at a school in Richmond for a short time. Proving to be an awkward youth, he was sent to a medical man at Whitwell, a Mr Hicks, with a view to moral restraint and discipline, but quickly ran away back to his home, Elm Wood House, at Redcoat's Green, Great Wymondley, near Hitchin, which his father had purchased. An attempt to place him with a clergyman for his moral education met with no greater success. When thwarted he would shut himself in his bedroom for days on end. &#145;His meals were taken to him and left at his door, which he did not object to eat, but resolutely refused to return the plates. At length the plates and dishes became scarce in other parts of the household, as his bedroom contained nearly the whole supply in the way of crockery&#146;  (Tuke, 363). His father's death in 1830 gave encouragement to this promising start on a life of eccentricity, for his mother humoured all his many whims and saw nothing odd about his going hunting in a nankeen suit or with his shirt outside his breeches, his riding in a carriage with his hair in curl papers, or his unsuccessful courting of a local lady with a pair of doves in a cage, although medical opinion was later to regard these as undoubted symptoms of incipient madness. But it was his mother's death in 1849 which removed all restraints on oddity and launched him on the life of a hermit.<br>
<br>Mrs Lucas died on 24 October 1849, but Lucas refused to part with her corpse until the following January, when his younger brother (who was their mother's executor) intervened and enforced her interment. This caused James to barricade himself into the kitchen of Elm Wood House, which was to be his abode for the next twenty-five years. He rarely left the one room, let alone the house. Window panes were broken by stones thrown at the time of the &#145;papal aggression&#146; in 1850, as he was thought to have Catholic tendencies, and were replaced by iron bars through which he could be viewed, if permitted by the guards he employed to protect him from harassment. Particularly after Charles Dickens visited him and wrote him up in the Christmas 1861 number of <span class="italic">All the Year Round</span>, thinly disguised as Mr Mopes, he became an object of fashionable curiosity; he was visited by Lord Lytton, Sir Arthur Helps, John Forster, and others, and became known as the Hertfordshire Hermit. Dickens thought he was a fraud, &#145;an abominably dirty thing&#146;, an intolerably conceited sluggard, &#145;a slothful, unsavoury, nasty reversal of the laws of human nature&#146; who ought to be put on a treadmill  (Tuke, 370). Others, although inarticulate, probably took a more generous view. He was fond of children and tramps. On Good Fridays he doled out sweets, coppers, and gin and water to upwards of 200 children; he was visited by swarms of tramps, giving them gin and pennies, always more to Catholics than protestants. A rich man&#151;he left some &pound;120,000 at his death&#151;he lived on a simple but ample diet of bread, cheese, red herrings, eggs, milk, and gin. Always suspicious that people were trying to poison him, he rejected many of his supplies; after his death a whole cartload of hard, untouched loaves, suspected of being poisoned, was taken away by a farmer, and after soaking in water they were fed to his chickens. He was also infested with rats, and kept his victuals in baskets hanging from the ceiling as a precaution. Once thought to be a good-looking man, 5 feet 6 inches tall, rather muscular, and with dark hair and eyes, he lived in filth and squalor, unwashed, clothed only in an old blanket, and sleeping simply on the ashes that built up to a depth of several feet (fourteen cartloads were removed after his death). But his conversation remained lucid and well informed, his memory was good, his conviction of the illegitimacy of the queen and his refusal therefore to execute any document requiring a stamp was consistently maintained, and he managed his bank account and his cheque book competently.<br>
<br>Lucas's manner of life being so bizarre and irrational, medical opinion puzzled over how to classify him, and in the end the best view was that this was &#145;a case of moral insanity, madness of action rather than language&#146;  (Tuke, 371). He died of apoplexy on 19 April 1874, at Titmore Cottage, near Elm Wood House, and was buried beside his mother in Hackney churchyard on 21 April. Moral insanity or no, the sensational and curio trades had no doubt of his value, and within weeks of his death 10,000 copies of a biographical sketch had been sold, and a brisk trade was going on in a range of mugs and tea services carrying pictures of the hermit and his strange dwelling.<br>
