<span class="headword">Evans,  Evan Herber</span>  (1836&#150;1896), <span class="occ">Congregational minister and college head</span>, the eldest son of Josiah Evans (1814&#150;1876), a blacksmith, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> James (1817&#150;1894), was born at Pant-yr-onnen, near Newcastle Emlyn, Carmarthenshire, on 5 July 1836. He spent some early years with his grandfather Jonah Evans at Pen-yr-herber, whence, in 1873, he adopted his second name. He received his early education at the private grammar school of John Davies in Adpar, Newcastle Emlyn, and at the British School in Llechryd. He was apprenticed to a local draper at Rhydlewis from 1850 to 1853 and after a year's further service in Pontypridd and Merthyr Tudful he moved to Liverpool. Here, in 1857, he started to preach in the Welsh Congregational church (the Tabernacle), Great Crosshall Street, then under the pastorate of John Thomas (1821&#150;1892). After twelve months' preparatory training at the Normal College, Swansea, he entered the Memorial College, Brecon, in 1858, where he remained for four years. He was ordained as pastor of Libanus church, Morriston, on 26 June 1862, and almost immediately he became one of the leading Welsh preachers. After three years at Morriston (during which time a debt of &pound;2000 was paid off the chapel) he moved in October 1865 to Caernarfon to undertake the charge of a small church, Salem, established only two or three years previously, and still heavily in debt. Before he left it, in April 1894, it had the largest congregation of any Congregational church in north Wales, the chapel having been enlarged in 1890.<br>
<br>Evans was elected chairman of the Union of Welsh Independents in 1886, and delivered his address, entitled &#145;The answers of Christ to the questions of the age&#146;, at Aberd&acirc;r.<br>
<br>On 20 September 1865 Evans married Jenny (<i>b</i>. 1841/2), only daughter of John Hughes, jeweller, of Caernarfon; she died on 10 May 1875, leaving an only daughter, Lizzie, who married the Revd O. L. Roberts of Liverpool. On 28 September 1877 Evans married, secondly, Annie Ellen (1842/3&#150;1927), the only daughter of Owen Jones, of Waterloo House, Caernarfon, who survived him. Their only child, Owen Herber, died in infancy on 27 May 1883.<br>
<br>In 1891 Evans was elected chairman of the Congregational Union of England and Wales, and his first presidential address, entitled &#145;The free churches and their opportunities&#146;, delivered at the City Temple, London, was described by Dr A. M. Fairbairn of Mansfield College, Oxford, as &#145;magnificent&#146;. His second address, delivered at Bradford in October 1892, &#145;A living church&#146;, was (by special vote of the assembly) ordered to be printed in a cheap form for general circulation. In 1891 he became lecturer on homiletics at Bala&#150;Bangor Congregational college. In 1894 he became its principal.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Evans took an active part in local politics; he was elected on the first school board at Caernarfon in 1874, and on the first county council in 1888. He declined, however, to stand as Liberal candidate for Caernarfon boroughs in May 1885 and April 1890. In 1895 he was appointed to the commission of the peace for Caernarvonshire, apparently an honour never previously conferred on a Welsh dissenting minister. He was awarded an honorary doctorate in divinity by the University of Miami, Ohio, in 1887.<br>
<br>Evans acted as editor of <span class="italic">Y Dysgedydd</span> (&#145;The instructor&#146;), one of the monthly magazines of the Welsh Congregationalists. From December 1873 to May 1880 he shared its editorship with Robert Thomas &#145;Ap Vychan&#146;, but had sole charge of it from 1880 until his death. A selection of his editorial notes was issued shortly after his death by his son-in-law, O. L. Roberts, under the title of <span class="italic">Nodiadau Herber</span> (1897). His brother, the Revd W. Justin Evans, also edited a volume of his sermons entitled <span class="italic">True and False Aims and other Sermons</span> (1897) including reprints of his two addresses from the chair of the Congregational Union. A volume of his Welsh sermons, entitled <span class="italic">Goleuni yn yr hwyr</span> (1904), was edited by his son-in-law. Evans had just completed, before his final illness, a chapter which he was contributing to a biography of Dr John Thomas of Liverpool, and a short life of David Rees of Llanelli, which appeared posthumously.<br>
<br>But it was as a preacher that Evans was chiefly remembered: unoriginal in content, his sermons were practical rather than dogmatic, but his physique, his voice, the cast of his sermon, his entire personality, all combined to win him a position unequalled by any living preacher. Probably no other Welsh preacher so often appeared in English pulpits; between 1873 and 1877 he turned down several calls to minister to Congregational churches at Bishopsgate, Bath, and Brighton, and Westminster chapel and Harecourt chapel, London. Evans died on 30 December 1896 at his home, The Roft, Upper Bangor, and was buried there on 4 January 1897 in the Glanadda cemetery.<br>
