<span class="headword">Kenneth II</span> <span class="st"> [Cin&aacute;ed mac Ma&iacute;l Choluim]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 995), <span class="occ">king in Scotland</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17857/', "Malcolm I (d. 954)")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8166/', "King Dubh (d. 966)")</script> was his older brother. Kenneth, who may have married a daughter of one of the U&iacute; D&uacute;nlainge kings of Leinster, became king after the death of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6870/', "Culen")</script> in battle with the Britons of Strathclyde in 971 and reigned for twenty-four years and two months. He immediately plundered Strathclyde, but suffered a serious defeat at &#145;Moin Vacornar&#146;. He repeatedly invaded England, on one occasion capturing a &#145;son of the king of the Saxons&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 1.512). A contemporary account of the submission of Welsh kings to King Edgar of England at Chester in 973 is elaborated in later versions to include Kenneth as one of the kings who rowed a boat with Edgar at the helm. What is more certain is that <i>c</i>.975 King Edgar formally acknowledged Kenneth's rule over Lothian, which may have been annexed to the Scottish kingdom when Edinburgh fell to King Indulf at some time between 954 and 962. It is possible, however, that Lothian was temporarily lost to the earls of Northumbria in the last year of Kenneth's reign, 994&#150;5.<br>
<br>Kenneth killed Olaf (brother of King Culen) in 977, which apparently brought a lull for two decades in the rivalry between the two branches of the royal dynasty&#151;the descendants of Constantine I (<i>d</i>. 876), to which Kenneth belonged, and the descendants of King Aed (<i>d</i>. 878), to which Kenneth's predecessor, Culen, had belonged. Kenneth was a benefactor of the church, and founded the monastery of Brechin, in Angus, perhaps as a C&eacute;li D&eacute; community: there were C&eacute;li D&eacute; there until the early thirteenth century. It may, however, be conjectured that Brechin was founded for strategic reasons as much as religious motives. It is situated in the north of Strathmore, the broad and fertile valley which runs north-east from the Gowrie (north of Perth) to the Mearns (in modern Kincardineshire), and may have lain in disputed territory. Kenneth apparently had trouble in Strathmore which led eventually to his death. He allegedly killed the only son of Finguala (Finella), the daughter of Conchobar, earl of Angus, at Dunsinane in the Gowrie; and, in revenge, Finguala arranged for Kenneth's assassination in 995 at Fettercairn in the Mearns&#151;not 12 miles from Brechin. He was succeeded by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6116/', "Constantine III")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6870/', "Culen")</script>].<br>
<br>With his Irish wife, Kenneth had at least one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17858/', "Malcolm II, king of Scots")</script> from 1005 to 1034. Boite mac Cinaeda was probably another son of Kenneth II (rather than a son of Kenneth III), but possibly born to a different mother. Boite had a grandson who was killed by Malcolm II in 1032, and he also had a daughter, Gruoch, successively the wife of Gille Comg&aacute;in, ruler of Moray (<i>d</i>. 1032), and of Macbeth, ruler of Moray and king of Scots (<i>d</i>. 1057).<br>
