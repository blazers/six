<span class="headword">James,  Minnie Stewart Rhodes</span>  (1865&#150;1903), <span class="occ">librarian and author</span>, was born on 7 July 1865 in Aldeburgh, Suffolk, the daughter of Henry Haughton James, late commander in the Indian navy, and his wife, Sophia Helen Courthope. Minnie James was one of the first women in Great Britain to become head of a major library, and was an outspoken proponent of librarianship as a profession for women and of the training of library assistants.<br>
<br>Little is known of James's education and early life until 1887, when she was appointed assistant librarian at the People's Palace, London. She became head librarian in 1889. The People's Palace, located on the Mile End Road, was founded in 1886 to provide technical training and recreation for the people of the East End of London. As she explained in a paper read at the World's Congress of Librarians in Chicago in July 1893, later published in the <span class="italic">Library Journal</span> in the October of that year, James played an important role in building the collections of the People's Palace Library. Her writings display respect and sympathy for the library's working-class clientele, whom she tried to accommodate by Sunday opening (between 3 p.m. and 10 p.m.) and by the acquisition of novels and other light reading. James left the library, however, in 1894, discouraged by the under-funding of the recreational side of the People's Palace (of which the library was part) in comparison to its technical instruction side. In fact, the library was closed for some years from 1901, although it eventually became the library of Queen Mary College, University of London.<br>
<br>Minnie James next served for a short time as the curator of the Library Association museum, a permanent exhibit of library equipment kept at the Library Bureau in Bloomsbury. The Library Bureau was a branch of the Library Bureau, Boston, Massachusetts, a manufacturer of library equipment founded in 1876 by Melvil Dewey. Known for developing the vertical file system, two-colour typewriter ribbon, and other products, the Library Bureau eventually became a subdivision of the Rand Kardex Bureau. In 1897 James was appointed librarian of the Library Bureau in Boston, Massachusetts, where she remained until her death.<br>
<br>Throughout her career James was active in the Library Association, which she joined in 1889. She was instrumental in getting the Library Association involved in the training of library assistants: she was a founder of the Library Association summer school in library science, first held in 1893, and an active member of the association's education committee and of the Library Assistants Association. She was also active in the American Library Association and in the Massachusetts Library Club.<br>
<br>Well read, liberal-minded, and articulate, James was the author of over twenty-five articles about her work at the People's Palace Library, the need for training of library assistants, and the employment of women in libraries, among other subjects. Her &#145;The progress of the modern card catalog principle&#146;, in <span class="italic">Public Libraries</span> of May 1902, was reprinted many times. She was particularly concerned with the reluctance of British libraries to hire women, especially in comparison to the United States, where library education was available and women were employed in libraries in much greater numbers: &#145;Women are peculiarly fitted for such work&#146; she wrote, &#145;and it is a source of great wonderment to everyone who has considered the subject that so few such women have been employed in British libraries in really responsible positions&#146;  (M. James, &#145;Women librarians and their future prospects&#146;, <span class="italic">Library Association Record</span>, June 1900, 292&#150;3).<br>
<br>About 1900 Minnie James's health began to fail. She spent the spring of 1901 in the Bahamas, producing a paper on the public library system there (it appeared in the <span class="italic">Library Association Record</span> in 1901). On 5 June 1903 she died of typhoid fever in St Botolph Hospital in Boston. Minnie James was a valued colleague and friend, as evidenced by the many tributes written after her death. The obituary in <span class="italic">Library Journal</span> (June 1903) noted that, as a woman &#145;of a most winning vivacity and charm, all who knew her will remember her with affection and will feel her death as a personal loss&#146;.<br>
