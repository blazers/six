<span class="headword">Woods, Sir  Albert William</span>  (1816&#150;1904), <span class="occ">herald</span>, was born on 16 April 1816 at Hampstead, Middlesex, the youngest of four sons and the fifth of six children, all apparently illegitimate, mentioned in the will of Sir William Woods (1785&#150;1842), Garter king of arms. He was the second son and third of the father's four children with Mary Ann Young; the two eldest sons were with Elizabeth Blake. Mary Ann Young, variously described as the daughter of a greengrocer in St Paul's Churchyard, a banner maker in the College of Arms, and Woods's cook&#150;housekeeper, was the sole executrix of his will. The paternity of Sir William Woods is uncertain; there was a tradition that he was an illegitimate child of Charles Howard, eleventh duke of Norfolk and earl marshal (1746&#150;1815), although he bore the arms matriculated in the Lyon Office, Edinburgh, in 1812 by George Woods of London, brother and heir of the comedian William Woods, of the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh. Sir Albert Woods also bore these arms until 22 December 1891, when a new grant reshuffled the charges in his father's arms. Nothing is known of his education, which was described by his son-in-law Sir Arthur Naylor Wollaston (1842&#150;1922) as private. Sir Anthony Wagner in <span class="italic">Heralds of England</span> records that he dropped his aitches and that Edward Bellasis (1800&#150;1873), serjeant-at-law, puzzled whether there really was an &#145;h&#146; in herald after a visit to the College of Arms in 1869  (p. 516).<br>
<br>About 1832 Woods began working in his father's office, and on 27 June 1837 was appointed Fitzalan pursuivant-extraordinary, as such attending the coronation of Queen Victoria. On 2 August 1838 he was appointed Portcullis pursuivant, following his father's appointment as Garter king of arms on 23 July 1838. On 1 December 1838 he married&#151;at St George's, Camberwell, on her twenty-first birthday&#151;Caroline (1817&#150;1911), daughter of Robert Cole, merchant, of Rotherfield, Sussex, with whom he had two children: William Francis Woods (1840&#150;1870), the father of Albert William Woods (1865&#150;1890), Rouge Dragon pursuivant in 1886, whose gambling led to bankruptcy in 1889; and Caroline Marianne (1844&#150;1902), wife of Sir Arthur Naylor Wollaston and mother of Sir Gerald Woods Wollaston (1874&#150;1957), Garter king of arms (1930&#150;44). Woods was promoted Norfolk herald-extraordinary on 28 October 1841 and Lancaster herald on 9 November 1841, and held the latter post with that of gentleman usher of the scarlet rod of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath, with the annexed office of Brunswick herald, to which he was appointed on 24 November 1841. Following the reorganization of the order in 1857 and the abolition of those offices he was made registrar and secretary of the Order of the Bath, as embodied in the new statutes of the order dated 31 January 1859.<br>
<br>On 28 July 1842 Woods was appointed inspector of regimental colours, in succession to his father, who had died on 25 July. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London on 25 March 1847. On 5 August 1869 he was appointed king of arms of the Order of St Michael and St George, and, on 2 November 1869, Garter king of arms, in succession to Sir Charles George Young. He was knighted on 11 November 1869, and was appointed registrar of the Order of the Star of India (instituted 23 February 1861), of the Order of the Indian Empire and of the Order of the Crown of India (both instituted 1 January 1878), and of the Royal Order of Victoria and Albert. As Lancaster herald and as Garter, Woods was in attendance on six investiture missions to foreign sovereigns. He was a knight of grace and director-general of ceremonies of the order of St John of Jerusalem in England, and also a prominent freemason, being grand director of ceremonies from 1860 until his death. He was appointed CB in 1887, KCMG on 21 May 1890, KCB on 22 June 1897, and GCVO on 30 June 1903.<br>
<br>Woods was determined that his grants should mark a definite period in heraldry and that no nineteenth-century grantee could expect a simple coat. Sir Anthony Wagner wrote that Woods &#145;was businesslike, energetic and possessed immense knowledge of ceremonial, precedence and the day to day business of his office&#146; but added that he &#145;was not an historian or a scholar and his influence on heraldic design has been thought deplorable&#146;  (Wagner, <span class="italic">Heralds of England</span>, 516). A portrait of Woods in <span class="italic">The Genealogist</span> in 1892, when he was aged seventy-seven, referred to his working as hard as any man half his age, and to his courteous and able exercise of his duties. By 1897 he was very seriously ill, yet continued to assemble all paperwork for his many offices from his home at 69 St George's Road, Warwick Square, Pimlico, while Sir William Henry Weldon (1837&#150;1919), then Norroy, acted as his deputy for ceremonial purposes and Sir Henry Farnham Burke (1859&#150;1930), then Somerset herald, prepared the coronation of Edward VII, in 1901&#150;2. The impact of Woods's increasing debility was all the greater because he had, in the words of one contemporary, &#145;obtained somehow or other a veto and authority in all heraldic matters which few if any earlier Garters ever had&#146;  (A. C. Fox-Davies, in <span class="italic">Genealogical Magazine</span>, 7.480&#150;82). Fox-Davies knew of no evidence of &#145;delay or inattention&#146;  (ibid.) but in December 1903 a secretary employed by Woods found 150 grants of dignities in the Order of the Bath, signed by Queen Victoria, and a further 485, signed by Edward VII, which had not been sent to the intended recipients. In the same year Sir William Alexander Baillie-Hamilton (1844&#150;1920), then officer of arms of the Order of St Michael and St George, lamented:<blockquote>a great deal of the business of several of the Orders is still nominally in the hands of a nonagenarian hermit concealed in St. George's Road, who is of course long past his work, and is nothing worse than an obstruction, but who clings tenaciously to his fees and his prerogatives. (Galloway, 154)</blockquote>Woods died, of heart disease, at his home in Pimlico on 7 January 1904, and was buried at Norwood cemetery, London, on 11 January. Like his predecessors he had been appointed for life, and his refusal to retire led directly to the formation, on 1 April 1904, of the Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, which took away from Garter and the other heralds the registration and secretarial work connected with most orders of chivalry.<br>
