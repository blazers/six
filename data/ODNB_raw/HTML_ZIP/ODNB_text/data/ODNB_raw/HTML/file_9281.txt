<span class="headword">Fenn,  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1540&#150;1584), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and martyr</span>, was born at Montacute, near Yeovil, Somerset, became a chorister of New College, Oxford, and was elected to a scholarship at Corpus Christi College (31 July 1554), and a fellowship on 26 November 1558. Fenn graduated BA on 22 November 1559, but was stripped of his academic standing for refusing to subscribe to the royal supremacy. Forced to leave Corpus Christi, he took up a teaching position at Gloucester Hall instead. When expelled from Oxford in November 1560 he acted as a private tutor in Somerset, where he also married and had two children, Francis and John. Following the death of his wife he became steward to Sir Nicholas Poyntz, a Catholic gentleman at whose suggestion he left the country to study for the priesthood.<br>
<br>Fenn arrived at the English College, then at Rheims, on 5 June 1579, was priested at Ch&acirc;lons-sur-Marne (1 April 1580), and returned to England a month later (10 May). He was apprehended at Brympton, Somerset, so was presumably working from Poyntz's household. He was sent to Ilchester gaol and, although not yet known to be a priest, was loaded with irons. The council ordered him to be brought to London where, following an examination by Walsingham, he was committed to the Marshalsea by September 1581. Fenn continued his pastoral work in prison and seems to have had &#145;a particular charity for pirates, whom he visited as much as he could&#146;  (Challoner, 91). When one of his penitents became Catholic, Fenn was identified as a priest and was moved to close confinement in the Tower on 4 September 1584. He was indicted the following day and was accused of conspiring to assassinate the queen. Fenn was condemned to death and was executed by hanging, drawing, and quartering at Tyburn on 12 February 1584, together with four other priests. &#145;His quarters were disposed on four gates of the city, and his head upon London Bridge&#146;  (Challoner, 93). He was beatified in 1929 by Pope Pius XI.<br>
<br>Fenn's two brothers were also priests, John Fenn and Robert Fenn BCL, who had to resign his fellowship of New College in 1562. Gibbons's <span class="italic">Concertatio</span> commented that Robert Fenn &#145;ob Catholicae veritatis testimonium, exilium, carceres, vincula, et cruciatus immanes constantissim&egrave; perpessus est&#146; (&#145;in testifying to the Catholic faith, he was subjected to exile and imprisonment and most frequently bound and tortured&#146;; Gibbons, 410).<br>
