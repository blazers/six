<span class="headword">Knox, Sir  Thomas George</span>  (1824&#150;1887), <span class="occ">consul</span>, was born in January 1824, the eldest surviving son of James Spencer Knox (1789&#150;1862), rector of Maghera, co. Londonderry, and his wife, Clara (<i>d</i>. 1862), youngest daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2195/', "Hon. John Beresford")</script> (son of the first earl of Tyrone); he was grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15795/', "William Knox")</script>, bishop of Derry. Of robust constitution and always strongly anti-French, Knox arrived in Siam in 1851, after selling out of the army in which he had served in India and China. Like other countries in the East, Siam under King Mongkut was just beginning to open its doors to Westerners after nearly two centuries of fairly strict seclusion; Knox was involved from the start in local politics, first as a military adviser, and then as the husband of a woman of the local nobility, Prang (<i>d</i>. 1888), daughter of Phraya Somkok of Bangkok, with whom he had a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1857, in the interval following the death of the first British consul, Knox was appointed to the indispensable office of interpreter to the new consulate. In 1864 he succeeded the second consul, Sir Robert Schomburgk, and was successively promoted consul-general and agent and consul-general.<br>
<br>These were years marked by complicated political upheavals in Siam, quite beyond the comprehension of Knox's Foreign Office chiefs in London. Rather than backing British imperial interest in the country, Knox seems to have seen himself as a champion of its sovereignty, and, after the succession of the young King Chulalongkorn (<i>r</i>. 1868&#150;1910), as his virtual guardian. Inevitably this provoked suspicion and jealousy among some Siamese, including the king himself, and Knox's successor as consulate interpreter, Henry Alabaster, after quitting the service in 1871 joined Knox's enemies. In late 1874, when he was on home leave, other consular subordinates tried, with only limited success, to prevent the king's party upsetting the existing power balance; in 1879 another faction seized power in protest at the elopement of Knox's elder daughter, Fanny, with Phra Pricha Kolakan, an associate of the king. Knox asked for a gunboat to bolster his position, but, amid Afghan and Zululand crises, Lord Salisbury instead colluded in what was really a huge blow to British prestige in the area by recalling Knox and retiring him with the KCMG as a consolation. His wife remained behind in Bangkok, and his son-in-law was executed.<br>
<br>Knox died at Eaux Chaudes in the Pyrenees on 29 July 1887, his wife the following year in Siam. His widowed elder daughter lived a migratory life between Europe and south-east Asia, while his younger daughter, Caroline, married Louis Leonowens, the teak trade magnate, only son of Anna, the governess made famous by the film <span class="italic">The King and I</span>. In the meanwhile, the so-called Siam question over the fate of the country, the climax to the late nineteenth-century colonial scramble for south-east Asia, came properly to a head despite the best efforts of Knox's successors, W. G. Palgrave and E. M. Satow.<br>
