<span class="headword">May,  Henry John</span>  (1867&#150;1939), <span class="occ">co-operative movement activist and internationalist</span>, was born on 16 July 1867 at 98 Villas Road, Plumstead, Kent, the son of Henry May, painter, and his wife, Mary Jane (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Kimber). After an elementary education he joined the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society (RACS) as a shop boy in 1880. Aged seventeen May followed his father into the Woolwich arsenal as an engineering apprentice. Parental influence also prompted his involvement with the management of the RACS. May subsequently chaired the education committee and edited the society's magazine, <span class="italic">Comradeship</span>. By the age of thirty he had joined the RACS management committee.<br>
<br>May became an active co-operative propagandist and secretary of the south metropolitan district board of the Co-operative Union. He sat on the southern sectional board, joining the union's central board in 1898. From 1905 to 1913 he held the paid appointment of secretary to the southern sectional board. An advocate of co-operative participation in politics, May was secretary of the joint parliamentary committee of the Co-operative Congress from 1909 to 1918. During the First World War, May was a member of the War Emergency Workers' National Committee established by labour and co-operative leaders to defend workers' interests. He also led co-operative representations to government on matters including food control and taxation. There followed service on governmental bodies, including the food rationing committee. May represented co-operation on the royal commission on income tax of 1919&#150;20 and the national railway wages board from 1921. This service was recognized when May was appointed OBE.<br>
<br>Wartime experience confirmed May's belief in the direct political representation of co-operation. In 1917 he became secretary of the new co-operative parliamentary representation committee. May stood, unsuccessfully, as its first candidate in the 1918 Prestwich by-election and in Clackmannan at the subsequent general election. However, he withdrew from parliamentary campaigning to devote himself to co-operative internationalism.<br>
<br>May's work with the International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) had begun fortuitously when he deputized for its then secretary, Dr Hans M&uuml;ller, at the ICA Congress at Glasgow in 1913. May assumed the post permanently, along with the editorship of the ICA <span class="italic">Bulletin</span>. During the First World War, he upheld co-operative neutrality amid what he saw as an imperialist and capitalist conflict. Contact was maintained with co-operators in belligerent countries and included publication of English, French, and German editions of the <span class="italic">Bulletin</span>.<br>
<br>After the war, May re-established good relations between French, German, and Belgian co-operators, restoring the ICA's triennial congresses. He travelled throughout Europe, cementing links with national co-operative movements, and he visited North America in 1928. He wrote extensively for the <span class="italic">Bulletin</span>, from 1928 enlarged as the <span class="italic">Review of International Co-Operation</span>. May secured recognition for the ICA, and it was involved with the World Economic Congress of 1927 and of 1933, and with the League of Nations.<br>
<br>In 1913 the ICA represented 20 million co-operators in twenty countries; by 1930 this had increased to 56 million members in forty countries. Yet co-operative autonomy was threatened by the rise of totalitarianism, first in Italy and the Soviet Union. May's pacifism and his work with the National Peace Council and the International Peace Campaign did not preclude vigorous resistance to fascism during the 1930s. However, his personal diplomacy on behalf of German, Austrian, Bulgarian, Spanish, and Czech co-operators enjoyed little success. May co-ordinated relief for victims of the Spanish Civil War and for refugees from continental Europe. In 1937 he attempted unsuccessfully to initiate an ICA boycott of Japanese goods following aggression against China. By 1939 only twenty-eight national co-operative movements were ICA members. Thus, for May, co-operative neutrality could not be maintained in the war against fascism.<br>
<br>May died suddenly of cancer on 19 November 1939 at Eltham, London, survived by his wife, Ada Martha. He was cremated on 25 November and interred at Plumstead cemetery on 26 November. Despite wartime travel restrictions, several European representatives attended and co-operative journals carried overseas tributes. The &#145;movement's No. 1 internationalist&#146;, as he was described by <span class="italic">Co-operative News</span> on 2 December 1939, was celebrated for his idealism and his brave defence of co-operation against totalitarianism.<br>
