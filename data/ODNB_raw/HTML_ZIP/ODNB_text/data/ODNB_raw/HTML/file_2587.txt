<span class="headword">Blakely,  Fletcher</span>  (1783&#150;1862), <span class="occ">non-subscribing Presbyterian minister</span>, was born on 13 May 1783 at Ballyroney, co. Down. He was the youngest son of Joseph Bleakly, a farmer, and was named after the Revd William Fletcher (<i>d</i>. 1824), Presbyterian minister of Ballyroney, who gave him his early education; both his parents died when he was very young. In 1799 he entered Glasgow University (at which time he spelled his name Bleakly), and is said to have graduated  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) though he is not included in the university's roll of alumni. On 19 September 1809 he was ordained by Bangor presbytery as minister of Moneyreagh, co. Down, in succession to Samuel Patton.<br>
<br>In 1810 Blakely married Margaret Lindsay (1783&#150;1825), daughter of David Lindsay of co. Down. They had four children: Jane, who married the Revd William Cochrane; Sarah (1814&#150;1844); David (1816&#150;1854), inspector of Irish national schools; and William Joseph (1818&#150;1842), Unitarian minister at Billingshurst, Sussex.<br>
<br>Although Blakely was raised a Calvinist he gradually turned to Unitarian views. He was the first self-styled &#145;humanitarian preacher&#146; in Ulster. Under his influence Moneyreagh became so well known for heterodox opinion that it was popularly said of Moneyreagh that it was the place &#145;where there is one God and no devil&#146;. When, in 1821, the English Unitarians sent John Smethurst (1792&#150;1859) on a mission to Ulster, the Moneyreagh meeting-house was one of the five meeting-houses which were open to him.<br>
<br>In 1829 Blakely led his entire congregation to join the remonstrant secession from the synod of Ulster. He had throughout the previous synodical debates been one of the most powerful associates of Henry Montgomery, the leader of the New Light party, and helped him to form the Remonstrant Synod. On 27 April 1836 a public testimonial bore witness to his &#145;successful advocacy of the rights of conscience and human freedom&#146;. Locally he also worked hard for popular education, for tenants' rights, and for the promotion of the flax industry. He was a joint editor from 1830 to 1833 of the <span class="italic">Bible Christian</span>. His early tracts and sermons, published anonymously, include <span class="italic">A Dialogue</span> (1817), <span class="italic">On the Bible and other Standards of Faith</span>, which was followed by <span class="italic">The battle of the two dialogues &hellip; a conversation between a rev. Covenanter and a rev. Presbyterian on the impropriety of adhering to any standard of faith except the Bible</span> (1818). In reply to it John Paul, minister in the Reformed Presbyterian church at Carrickfergus (<i>d</i>. 1848), published his first work, <span class="italic">Creeds and Confessions Defended</span> (1819). Blakely's later works were <span class="italic">The Doctrine of the Trinity not Comprised on the Faith</span> (1846) and <span class="italic">An Explicit Avowal of Truth the Best Mode of Teaching it</span> (1853). He resigned his charge on 22 September 1857 but continued to preach until his successor, John Jellie, was installed on 27 September 1859. He died on 25 February 1862 at Cradley, Worcestershire, the residence of his son-in-law the Revd William Cochrane. Fletcher Blakely was a prominent Unitarian and a committed advocate of religious and civil liberty. He was buried in the graveyard of Moneyreagh non-subscribing Presbyterian church on 1 March 1862, and a monument was erected there to his memory.<br>
