<span class="headword">Wyld,  James, the younger</span>  (1812&#150;1887), <span class="occ">cartographer and geographical publisher</span>, was born in North Street, Lambeth, Surrey, on 20 November 1812, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30130/', "James Wyld the elder")</script> and his wife, Elizabeth Legg. He was baptized in the Ebenezer Chapel, Mayfair, on 26 December 1812. He was educated at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich but joined his father's firm which from about 1830 traded as J. Wyld &amp; Son. The premises were frequented by politicians and others in public life, who came for maps of areas of topical interest. These included a map of Afghanistan with notes and the routes of troops at the time of the First Anglo-Afghan War, a &#145;Map of the gold regions of California&#146; (1849), &#145;Notes on the distribution of gold throughout the world, with a gazetteer of the gold diggings of Australia&#146; (3rd edn, 1853), and maps of the Ottoman empire and Black Sea at the time of the Crimean War. His <span class="italic">Popular Atlas</span> contained lithographs of the maps he issued in cheap monthly numbers. Wyld profited from the railway mania of 1836&#150;7 when he supplied the prospectus maps and plans that railway companies had to deposit to get parliamentary approval for their schemes; but when the mania collapsed he was left with heavy claims against unsuccessful companies, which he pursued in vain in the courts. The experience did not deter Wyld from further railway map publishing and he also published guide and travel books, illustrated with maps, and an extensive range of cycling maps. The timing of his map publications and their format show that he, like other cartographic publishers, was something of an opportunist and had a keen eye for publishing innovations, although, unlike many contemporaries, his maps were always of high quality, a fact acknowledged when he was accorded the title of geographer to Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.<br>
<br>Wyld's most spectacular enterprise was his &#145;great globe&#146;, exhibited in Leicester Square between 1851 and 1861 to coincide with the Great Exhibition. It was 60 feet high and 40 feet in diameter and lit by gas. On its inside painted plaster of Paris reliefs illustrated the physical features of the earth at a horizontal scale of one inch to ten miles and a vertical scale of three inches to ten miles. The object of some ridicule, it was none the less extremely popular. It was surrounded by a large spherical building entered from four loggias opening into each side of the square. In the building maps, atlases, and other globes (inevitably mostly Wyld's own) were displayed.<br>
<br>Wyld was Liberal MP for Bodmin for most of the period 1847&#150;68 and used his position to castigate the surveyors of the Ordnance Survey and other official bodies for inefficiency and profligacy, an attitude shaped in large part by the threat they posed to his livelihood. He helped to found the Association of Surveyors in 1843 and the Surveyors' Institution in 1848 to unite non-government surveyors against official surveyors, but both societies failed. Despite his opposition, his firm was one of only six agencies appointed to sell Ordnance Survey maps after 1866. After retiring from parliament he represented Cornhill ward on the City's court of common council from 1871 to 1886. As a founder governor of the City and Guilds London Institute and as master in 1875&#150;6 of the Clothworkers' Company, he helped to promote technical education, notably in Manchester, Leeds, and Bristol. His scientific reputation led to his being elected fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1839, and awarded membership of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur and a gold medal for science from the king of Prussia.<br>
<br>Wyld married Ann, only daughter of John Hester, on 27 February 1838. On his death on 17 April 1887 at 29 Trebovir Road, South Kensington, he left a daughter and a son, <a name="cosubject_41111"></a><span class="headword">James John Cooper Wyld</span>  (1844&#150;1907), <span class="occ">barrister and map publisher</span>, who was born in St Pancras, London, on 4 April 1844. The son was educated at King's College, London, and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, after which he was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1866. He became a special pleader on the western circuit and a deputy judge in the county courts. He was elected fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1888, but was not very much interested in geography and was reputedly arrogant and dismissive about all aspects of the map trade, which he little understood. Under him the family firm declined fatally, suffering particularly from competition from the energetic and talented Edward Stanford, from whom Wyld now had to get his Ordnance Survey maps and whose own maps were superior to Wyld's. Wyld blamed his difficulty in retaining good engravers on the Ordnance board, continuing his father's animosity towards government cartography. The stock and goodwill of the Wyld business were acquired by George Washington Bacon in October 1893. Wyld died on 30 January 1907 at his home in Ashley Road, Thames Ditton, Surrey. He was probably unmarried and childless.<br>
