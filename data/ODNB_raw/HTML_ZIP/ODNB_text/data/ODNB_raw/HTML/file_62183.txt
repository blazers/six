<span class="headword">Mowbray,  Alfred Richard</span>  (1824&#150;1875), <span class="occ">church publisher and printer</span>, was born on 28 November 1824 at Leicester, the elder son of William Mowbray (<i>b</i>. 1798), lace manufacturer, and his wife, Ann. In early life Mowbray was attracted to the teachings of the Oxford Movement with its object of bringing about a catholic revival in the Church of England. He subsequently trained as a teacher at St Mark's Teacher Training College in Chelsea, where he was noted as a high-churchman. At the age of twenty-one he was appointed headmaster of the church school in Bingham, Nottinghamshire, and in 1848 he married one of the teachers on his staff. This was Susan [<a name="cosubject_62183"></a><span class="headword">Susan Mowbray</span>  (1829&#150;1911)], youngest child of William Thomas, a Bridgwater innkeeper, and his wife, Hannah. She trained as a teacher at Whitelands College in London from 1843 to 1845. The Mowbrays had seven surviving children, two sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>A stained-glass window in Bingham church, designed by Mowbray and still visible in the late twentieth century, is indicative of his continuing enthusiasm for things ecclesiastical. This moved him, after various other teaching posts, to accept a call to go out to New Zealand to further the work of Bishop Selwyn in creating the new cathedral in Wellington. At this time, however, a visit to Oxford led Mowbray to an encounter with the Revd Thomas Chamberlain, vicar of St Thomas's and an ardent follower of the Oxford Movement in its later ritualist phase. Chamberlain's resolve was to do for the slum poor of his parish what Pusey and Keble had been doing for the intellectual classes, and to teach the truth, as the Oxford Movement saw it, of the Christian faith in simple pictorial but effective ways. He persuaded Mowbray to stay in Oxford and help him in this work.<br>
<br>Mowbray's first involvement was in the social work of the parish, in which he was immensely active. He also formed the Oxford Churchman's Union among undergraduates of the university. But he soon came to see that, if the teaching of the catholic movement were to be more widely spread, there was need for a bookshop to sell tracts and other publications, together with other aids to devotion. For this purpose he opened the first Mowbray bookshop at 2 Cornmarket, Oxford. This prospered so much that he extended his work to church printing and publishing in larger premises at 116 St Aldate Street. Leaflets, tracts, books, and ecclesiastical <i>objets d'art</i> of all kinds now poured from this establishment. In his novel <span class="italic">Jude the Obscure</span> (1895) Thomas Hardy gives a description of what can safely be taken to be Mowbray's shop, since it was unique in Oxford at the time. Jude enters the place and sees that &#145;it contained Anglican books, stationery, texts and fancy goods; little plaster angels on brackets, gothic framed pictures of saints, ebony crosses which were almost crucifixes, prayer books that were almost missals&#146;  (Hardy, pt 2, chap. 2).<br>
<br>A shop was opened in London at 20 Warwick Lane, close to St Paul's Cathedral, and Mowbray's son (Samuel) Edwin was put in charge of it. Some of the firm's publications had immense sales, such as Mowbray's <span class="italic">Plain Tracts</span>, which ran to over two hundred titles. It also published magazines such as the first <span class="italic">Communicants' Manual</span>, <span class="italic">The Bread of Life</span>, and <span class="italic">The Gospeller</span> (a monthly parish newspaper later succeeded by <span class="italic">The Sign</span>), which came to have a national distribution.<br>
<br>Mowbray died of heart failure on 17 December 1875 at his home, 116 St Aldate Street, Oxford, aged only fifty-one, and was buried in Holywell cemetery later that month. Edwin Mowbray returned to Oxford after his father's death to run the business as general manager, but was found dead in his bath in October 1897, overcome by escaping gas fumes. Alfred Mowbray's widow, Susan, then took over the business and supervised its transformation into a limited company in May 1903. She died on 25 May 1911 at 26 Winchester Road, Oxford, and was buried in Holywell cemetery beside her husband. Her daughters Marion and Agnes also served as directors, and the latter set up a trust to distribute the income from her shareholding in the firm among surviving family members. This was only terminated in 1988 when the company was taken over by another large bookselling firm.<br>
<br>The bookshop and publishing business founded by A. R. Mowbray was popularly known as Mowbrays. Over many years, and sustained by Susan Mowbray and later generations of the family, through its sale of books, prayer books, church furnishings, and vestments, it made a recognizable mark upon Anglican life, both in Britain and overseas.<br>
