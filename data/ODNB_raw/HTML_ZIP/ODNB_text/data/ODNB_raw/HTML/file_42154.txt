<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stephenson,  William Lawrence</span>  (1880&#150;1963), <span class="occ">retail executive</span>, was born on 13 January 1880 at Scarborough, Yorkshire, the son of Frederick James Stephenson and his wife, Eliza Toder. His father, the manager of a small upholstery business, was determined that his son should learn a trade and take up a commercial career. After leaving school in Hull, therefore, Stephenson was apprenticed at the age of seventeen to Edwin Owen, a Birmingham general merchant who concentrated on the export of British goods to American department stores. Stephenson's talent and drive took him through all the main sections of the business, and he was made chief buyer by the age of thirty. His first links with the Woolworth organization, of which he was to become the chairman in Britain, came in 1904, when he met and helped Frank Woolworth who was on a buying trip. In 1909 he married Lillian, the daughter of Joseph Drake, a provision merchant from Shipley; they had three daughters and a son.<br>
<br>Stephenson's career underwent a major change when he was recruited by Woolworth in 1909 to be part of the management team for the organization's expansion into the British market. From the very outset Stephenson fitted in well with the ideas of Woolworth and he was eager to learn the business of store management and store development under the guidance of Fred Woolworth, Frank's cousin. He worked long hours and rapidly acquired the knowledge needed to run the new stores. Perhaps the major assets Stephenson brought to the organization were his flair for buying in bulk, matched by the excellent links he had with British manufacturers, skills he had honed as a buyer for Edwin Owen, where he learned the importance of having high turnovers associated with low margins. The premature death of Fred Woolworth in 1923 left Stephenson, who had been Woolworth's understudy, in charge of the organization's British venture. Stephenson proved to be an inspirational leader and a good judge of character which enabled him to build a strong team of store managers. He proved slightly less popular with employees when unionization in the stores was strongly opposed. Under Stephenson's management Woolworths expanded rapidly, increasing their stores from 100 in 1923 to 529 by 1933, and becoming a household name. Stephenson oversaw the expansion personally, inspecting as he did all the proposed new store locations.<br>
<br>After 1932 Stephenson passed on some of his tasks to a new managing director, although as chairman he still retained overall control, and he was especially active during the war years. Indeed, it was his vision and planning that equipped the organization for a rapid post-war recovery. He was also active in many other areas and from 1936 held directorships on the boards of General Investment Trust, the Phoenix Assurance Company, and Porkellis Property. In 1933 he was also on the Board of Trade's council dealing with industry and art. During the war Beaverbrook asked him to be director-general of equipment in the Ministry of Aircraft Production, a position which Stephenson accepted with alacrity. To his great regret, he found it a frustrating time largely because of his incompatibility with the civil service staff. He finally resigned from the board of Woolworths in 1948.<br>
<br>Stephenson was a complex character who never sought any personal fame or recognition but was content to see the Woolworth organization do well from his efforts. He was very much a family man, religious, who neither drank nor gambled. He had little time for politics and did not tolerate fools or boasters. Away from work he took enjoyment in golf and fishing; he also became interested in stock breeding, which he practised on his estates at Blandford and Bere Regis. His greatest passion, however, was yachting and he completed his first season in 1932 after the purchase of <i>White Heather II</i> in that year. The following year he commissioned C. E. Nicholson to design the fast, all metal, cutter <i>Velsheda</i>, which was a contender for the America's Cup. For several years he was a commodore of the Royal Motor Yacht Club.<br>
<br>Stephenson died at his home, Rudheath, 152 Canford Cliffs Road, Bournemouth, on 7 May 1963, following a debilitating stroke in 1959.<br>
