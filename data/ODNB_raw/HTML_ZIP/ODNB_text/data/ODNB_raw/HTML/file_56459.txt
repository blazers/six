<span class="headword">Martindale <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Spicer]</span>,  Louisa</span>  (1839&#150;1914), <span class="occ">women's activist</span>, was born on 25 June 1839 at 9 York Place, City Road, London, the eldest child of James Spicer (1807&#150;1888), head of a wholesale stationers, and his wife, Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Edwards. The Spicers' was a homoeopathic, Congregationalist household (eventually Louisa was joined by five brothers and five sisters), which, while conforming to the patriarchal structure typical of Victorian families, also allowed space for self-development in which Louisa revelled. At fourteen years of age she was sent to a fashionable private school near Hyde Park, which did little to instil in her anything but a sense that the formal education she received was wanting in breadth, scope, and inspiration. Travels abroad, and there were many in her life, were more fulfilling, and at eighteen she accompanied her parents on her first venture to Europe, a religious jamboree organized by the Evangelical Exchange. Upon her return to the family's Elizabethan home on Woodford Green, she founded a small society, the Mutual Improvement Association, and threw herself into a &#145;lady bountiful&#146; role by founding Sunday schools and the Ray Lodge Mission Station in 1865, a &#145;democratic&#146; working-class alternative to the often alienating experience of organized religion. On 2 May 1871 she married a 37-year-old widower and father of four, William Martindale, a merchant. Their marriage ended abruptly after only a few years when he succumbed to heart trouble about 1874, and Martindale was left a widow with two small daughters, Louisa and Hilda (a third daughter, Mary, had died in infancy). From this time onward mother and daughters lived a peripatetic life that took them from Penzance to Germany, Switzerland, Lewes (which proved too conservative and intellectually stultifying for Louisa), and finally to Brighton. There Martindale held open houses for governesses and shop assistants, became a moving force in establishing the Women's Liberal Association in 1891, the Women's Co-operative Movement, and a dispensary for women staffed by women (later the New Sussex Hospital for Women and Children). She also worked on behalf of her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48204/', "Albert Spicer")</script>, who had been elected to Monmouth Boroughs in 1892, and involved herself with the British and Foreign Bible Society, the Women's Suffrage Society, and the German church.<br>
<br>Louisa Martindale had become interested in women's rights in 1867, and firmly believed that the Liberal Party would enfranchise women. In the 1890s she spoke in her brother's constituency on the topic of women's admission to county councils, wrote lectures on the &#145;rights&#146; of women (personal, property, and as citizens), on women in India, and co-operative kitchens, and corresponded with Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy. She supported women's right to preach, and built a Congregational church in Horsted Keynes, Sussex, where she moved in 1903, to serve this end. She welcomed the arrival of the suffragettes as a breath of fresh air, but always believed that the vote would be won by non-militant means, and worked within the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. As a pacifist she believed that women should become public and political creatures in order to promote peace. On 15 March 1914, a few months before the First World War erupted, Louisa Martindale died from pneumonia at Cheeleys, her home in Horsted Keynes; she was buried in Horsted Keynes. She was &#145;saved&#146;, her daughter Hilda writes, &#145;from what would have been a great sorrow to her&#146;  (H. Martindale, 39)&#151;war, and the realization that women would get the vote in 1918 arguably as a result of their war work. The careers of her two daughters, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45785/', "Louisa Martindale")</script> as a gynaecologist and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34912/', "Hilda Martindale")</script> in the civil service, were a personal testament to Martindale's commitment to the cause of women's rights.<br>
