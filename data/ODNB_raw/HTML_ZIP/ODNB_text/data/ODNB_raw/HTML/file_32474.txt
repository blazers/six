<span class="headword">Cockerell,  Douglas Bennett</span>  (1870&#150;1945), <span class="occ">bookbinder</span>, was born on 5 August 1870 at Clifton Cottage, Sydenham Hill, London, the fourth child of Sydney John Cockerell (1842&#150;1877), coal merchant, and his wife, Alice Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1900), elder daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2125/', "Sir John Bennett")</script>, watchmaker and politician. He came from a middle-class family, but the death of his father threw them on hard times. Douglas was a failure at St Paul's School, Hammersmith&#151;he could not read until he was twelve&#151;so he was sent to Canada when he was fifteen, with &pound;5 in his pocket. By the age of twenty he was managing a bank at Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, where &#145;he liked the cowboys very much indeed&#146;  (Rorke, 71).<br>
<br>After returning to London in 1891, Cockerell got a job as secretary of the Chiswick School of Arts and Crafts in west London. In 1892 his older brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32475/', "Sydney Carlyle Cockerell")</script> began to work for William Morris, and through him Cockerell was drawn to the little workshops of the Arts and Crafts movement. In 1893 he was apprenticed to T. J. Cobden-Sanderson at the Doves Bindery in Hammersmith. Here he learned to bind books in a traditional way, sewing the sections onto cords whose ends were fixed securely to the boards; covering the book, usually in leather; and decorating the binding if required. Firms at the top end of the trade in London, such as Zaehnsdorf and Rivi&egrave;re, still worked in this way in the late nineteenth century, but most books were bound by partly mechanized methods, the sections sewn together, and cloth-covered boards simply glued around them.<br>
<br>In 1897 Cockerell set up his own bindery at 6 Denmark Street, off Charing Cross Road, London, moving to 29 Gilbert Street (later Gilbert Place), Bloomsbury, in 1899, and to Ewell, on the outskirts of London, in 1902. The bindery usually consisted of three employees, with some help from Florence Arundel (<i>c</i>.1870&#150;1912), a craft jeweller whom Cockerell married on 5 August 1898. There were also a number of women pupils, who found opportunities in craft bookbinding denied them in the trade, where women were confined to sewing.<br>
<br>The construction of Cockerell's bindings followed the standards set by Cobden-Sanderson, but he had his own style of decoration. Whereas Cobden-Sanderson thought of the decoration of books as the embellishment of great literature, Cockerell thought of it more soberly, as the expression or flowering of the book's construction, arranging his simple vocabulary of flowers and leaves and scrolling lines into roundels, panels, and arabesques that echo the proportions and structure of the book.<br>
<br>If Cobden-Sanderson was the pioneer of craft bookbinding, Cockerell became its acknowledged teacher about 1900. He taught bookbinding at the London county council's new Central School of Arts and Crafts on two evenings a week from 1897 until 1905, and then again until 1935 from 1921. In 1899 his concern over the poor quality of bookbinding leather led to an enquiry by the Society of Arts and a report whose specifications for binding he wrote, or at least inspired. In 1901 he published <span class="italic">Bookbinding and the Care of Books</span>, in which he set out the principles and methods of craft bookbinding, dismissing ordinary trade bindings as &#145;casing&#146; rather than binding. <span class="italic">Bookbinding and the Care of Books</span> remains the basic handbook of craft bookbinding today.<br>
<br>But in the early 1900s Cockerell began to build bridges between his high standards and the trade. In 1904 he was appointed &#145;controller&#146; of a new trade bindery opened by W. H. Smith &amp; Son in Goldsmith Street off Drury Lane. His Ewell bindery became a specialist annexe of W. H. Smith, whose output ranged from top-quality work, based on the specifications of the Society of Arts, to ordinary trade bindings. Between these two extremes stood an improved trade binding devised by Cockerell, with cloth covers and tapes inserted into split boards, which seems to reflect his belief that &#145;Binding can be, and is, produced that is sound in construction and pleasant to look at, and at the same time is reasonably cheap&#146;  (Cockerell, <span class="italic">Bookbinding: a Lecture</span>, 2). In 1907 the bindery moved to new, model premises in Letchworth Garden City, and Cockerell with it.<br>
<br>By that date the Cockerell family included two children, Catherine, known as Casty, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39955/', "Sydney Morris Cockerell, known as Sandy")</script>. A third child, Oliver, was born in 1908. Four years later Florence Cockerell died of tuberculosis. Published sources do not tell us much about Cockerell as a person, and we do not know what he felt at this time. He was a kindly, gentle man, who loved to grow flowers, &#145;to cut with a scythe and give away&#146;, as he put it  (Rorke, 73). But he remains elusive behind the formal language of obituaries and memoirs. On 14 January 1914 he married (Bessie) Marion Gilford (<i>c</i>.1872&#150;1956), a local doctor who had been guardian of his children since their mother's death.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Cockerell was involved in demanding work for the Ministry of Munitions, for which he was made MBE. Afterwards he was appointed adviser on printing to the Imperial War Graves Commission, and oversaw the massive task of printing and binding the registers of the dead which can be found in each cemetery.<br>
<br>The spirit of the Arts and Crafts movement lived on in the Cockerell family in the 1920s. Casty Cockerell became a jeweller and in 1924 Sandy went into partnership with his father as Douglas Cockerell &amp; Son. The binding of manuscripts and early printed books with a view to their conservation was increasingly important in this phase of Douglas Cockerell's career. His approach, grounded in traditional structure and materials, lent itself to that kind of work, and in 1935 he rebound the celebrated fourth-century biblical text the <span class="roman">Codex Sinaiticus</span> for the British Museum. This approach came to be recognized as the &#145;Cockerell tradition&#146; in British craft bookbinding. It was born of the romantic enthusiasms of the Arts and Crafts movement at the turn of the century, but it lasted beyond them because Cockerell's insistence on sound workmanship answered the conservation needs of university and cathedral libraries.<br>
<br>Douglas Cockerell died at his home, 298 Norton Way South, Letchworth, on 25 November 1945. After his death, the Cockerell tradition was carried on principally by Sandy Cockerell at the bindery, and by Roger Powell, who had worked there from 1935 to 1947. The bindery closed down with Sandy's death in 1987, after almost ninety years of work.<br>
