<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bagot,  Richard</span>  (1782&#150;1854), <span class="occ">bishop of Bath and Wells</span>, was born at Daventry, Northamptonshire, on 22 November 1782, son of William, first Baron Bagot, and his wife, the Hon. Elizabeth Louisa St John (<i>d</i>. 1820), daughter of the second Viscount Bolingbroke. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1041/', "William Bagot, second Baron Bagot")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1037/', "Sir Charles Bagot")</script> were his brothers. Richard was educated at Rugby School from January 1790 until 1799, when he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, graduating BA in 1803 and MA in 1806. He was awarded a DD (by diploma) in 1829. In 1803 Bagot was elected to an All Souls fellowship, which he resigned when he married Lady Harriet Villiers, daughter of George Bussey, fourth earl of Jersey, on 22 December 1806. They had eight sons and four daughters, all of whom survived their father. Ordained in 1806, Bagot was presented by his father to the rectory of Leigh, Staffordshire, and in 1807 to the rectory of Blithfield, the family seat. Family connections&#151;his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1038/', "Lewis Bagot")</script> was bishop successively of Norwich and St Asaph&#151;ensured further preferment. In 1812 he became a prebendary of Lichfield Cathedral, and in 1817 was elected to a canonry of Worcester. Bagot was appointed dean of Canterbury in 1827, and in 1829 he was elevated to the bishopric of Oxford, holding the deanery <i>in commendam</i>.<br>
<br>Bagot was of a modest, retiring, and nervous disposition; his nerves never recovered from an accident while dean of Canterbury in which he swallowed cotton wool used to stop a tooth. He utterly refused the bishopric of Oxford when it was first offered him by the duke of Wellington, and accepted it only on the assurance of William Howley that the diocese would &#145;never give him trouble&#146;  (Paget to Eden, 22 Jan 1879, Ollard MSS). It was Bagot's misfortune that the rise of the Oxford Movement and all its consequences proved Howley wrong, and exposed the bishop to a limelight which by nature he would have shunned.<br>
<br>The bishop of Oxford stood in an anomalous position in relation to the university: he was not ordinary within the colleges, though he ordained for some. Bagot's difficulties were compounded because, unlike his predecessor, Charles Lloyd, he lacked academic standing within the university and did not have a reputation for scholarship. The diffident bishop, nicknamed King Log on account of an undeserved reputation for lack of activity, seemed a most unlikely candidate for Tractarian reverence as an episcopal specimen successor of the apostles. Yet the Tractarians were to have few more genuine friends on the episcopal bench.<br>
<br>Bagot's birth and tory family background gave him the credentials of a moderate high-churchman of the old school; he attempted to tighten church discipline and episcopal authority in the diocese. In 1831 he deprived the Calvinist H. P. Bulteel from his curacy at St Aldates for preaching antinomianism, while in the last year of his episcopate, in 1845, Bagot took the Revd James Hawker Langley, perpetual curate of Wheatley, to the ecclesiastical courts for extempore preaching. His first episcopal charge in 1834 was distinctly high church in tone, and indeed his personal regard for Newman and Pusey was great. His forbearance, sympathy, and trust earned the respect of many Tractarians. In 1836 he took delight in Newman's new church at Littlemore, despite its supposedly &#145;papistical&#146; features. In 1838 Newman dedicated his <span class="italic">Lectures on Justification</span> to the bishop. According to his private chaplain and nephew, Francis Paget, Bagot was able to retain a larger degree of personal influence with the Tractarian divines than an abler man might have attained.<br>
<br>Bagot consistently resisted intense low-church and evangelical pressure to act firmly against the Tractarian movement. The bishop's charge of 1838 restated the high-church themes of his earlier charge and vigorously denounced the ecclesiastical commission. In spite of some mild words of caution, which an over-sensitive Newman misinterpreted as evidence of coldness and rebuke, the tenor of the charge was broadly favourable to the authors of the <span class="roman">Tracts for the Times</span>, who were praised for recalling forgotten truths such as the authority and discipline of the church. Subsequently the bishop went out of his way to reassure Newman that he had not meant to censure the tracts. Bagot did not agree with the Tractarians <i>tout court</i>; his main concern was to check the rise of party division within the diocese, and he blamed opponents of the Tractarians primarily for fostering party spirit. When anti-Tractarians such as C. P. Golightly sought to establish a protestant martyrs' memorial in Oxford in 1838, partly as a deliberate hit at the Tractarians, Bagot attempted to defuse the situation by persuading Pusey to subscribe to the memorial, though he had no such success with Newman. On other occasions Newman's almost exaggerated respect for his diocesan as &#145;my pope&#146; raised difficulties and caused the bishop embarrassment. Bagot privately pleaded with Newman to check the extravagances of his younger followers, because they tended &#145;to retard the progress of sound and high Church principles which you would inculcate&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Letters and Diaries of John Henry Newman</span>, ed. C. S. Dessain and others, 31 vols., 1&#150;10, 2nd edn, 1978&#150;, 7.190).<br>
<br>
<span class="roman">Tract 90</span> (1841) and the subsequent excesses of the movement put an increasing strain on Bagot's friendly relationship with the Tractarians. Always dependent on the counsel of Archbishop Howley, he was vulnerable to Lambeth pressure to take a somewhat firmer line with the Tractarians. The bishop's chaplain, Francis Paget, later likened Bagot's position between &#145;Blomfield's on the one side, and Golightly and such like cattle on the other&#146; as akin to that of &#145;a railway servant, caught and pressed &hellip; between the buffers of two engines&#146;  (Paget to Eden, 24 Jan 1879, Ollard MSS). In the period 1841&#150;2, Bagot showed extreme deference to the advice of other bishops and clergy. He requested Newman to bring the series of <span class="roman">Tracts for the Times</span> to an immediate close and to state more clearly his view of the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>. In a published letter to the bishop Newman appeared to comply with this request, having persuaded Bagot to yield from his original intention of getting Newman to &#145;suppress&#146; <span class="roman">Tract 90</span>. While Bagot appeared satisfied and Howley congratulated him on his handling of the affair, others complained that the bishop had been &#145;hoodwinked&#146;: that Newman not only did not withdraw <span class="roman">Tract 90</span> from circulation but, in opposition to the bishop's wishes, had a new edition printed. Low-church critics accused Bagot of &#145;swelling the sails of Puseyism&#146;  (Mead, 129).<br>
<br>Bagot struck a more critical note in his 1842 charge, which criticized theories by which &#145;the Articles may be made to mean anything or nothing&#146;, expressing fears and warnings for the disciples rather than leaders of the movement. In his later dealings with the Tractarians, over the poetry professorship contest in late 1841 and the controversy over the suspension of Pusey from preaching in 1843 for an unsound sermon on the eucharist, Bagot acted notably less sympathetically towards them. Although he could please neither side in the controversies, Bagot's careful line won the plaudits of high-church supporters of the movement such as William Palmer of Worcester, who dedicated his <span class="italic">Narrative of Events Connected with the Publication of the &#145;Tracts for the Times&#146;</span> (1843) to the bishop.<br>
<br>Bagot's nervous character was a family trait, but whereas his elder brother gave way to nervous breakdowns, the bishop &#145;struggled to conceal the infirmity with all his power&#146;  (Ollard MSS). The strain of the Tractarian controversy, &#145;an ever present source of inward misery&#146;, finally took its toll. Bagot was for some years eager to be transferred from the Oxford diocese. The more candid among the Tractarians recognized that his going away would be perilous for them, and they hoped to avert it. By 1845, after pleading with the prime minister, Sir Robert Peel, and satisfying himself on the situation of the episcopal residence and the local climate, Bagot was translated to the see of Bath and Wells. He then suffered a complete nervous collapse. For a time his diocese was administered, in accordance with a special act of parliament, by the bishop of Gloucester and Bristol, Henry Monk. Bagot recovered, but the theological turmoil associated with the Oxford Movement pursued him to the last. In 1853&#150;4 Bagot was caught up in the controversy involving one of his archdeacons, George Anthony Denison, whose teaching on the real presence in the eucharist was deemed inconsistent with Anglican formularies. Bagot differed from Denison in his interpretation of the church's eucharistic doctrine, but feared that low-church views of the sacrament would be sanctioned by any legal adjudication. Just before his death, the bishop put his hand to a quasi-censure or admonition of Denison; later, to the dismay of Bagot's family, Denison published his correspondence with Bagot, in which the bishop lamented Denison's speculations as to the eucharist. Latterly in failing health, Bagot died at Brighton on 15 May 1854, through &#145;a complication of disorders&#146;. His wife survived him, and died on 18 October 1870. Newman offered a mass for the repose of her soul.<br>
