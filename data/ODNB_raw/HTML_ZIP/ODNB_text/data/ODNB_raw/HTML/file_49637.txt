<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Beytagh,  Gonville Aubie  ffrench-</span>  (1912&#150;1991), <span class="occ">dean of Johannesburg</span>, was born in Shanghai, China, on 26 January 1912, the son of Leo Michael ffrench-Beytagh, the managing director of a cotton company, and his wife, Edith, formerly McIlraith. His father was a lapsed Irish Catholic seminarian. His mother left home when he was still young. He had a somewhat anarchic upbringing in China, followed by the irksome discipline of an English evangelical public school, Monkton Combe (which he disliked), and a slightly more tolerable time at Bristol grammar school. In England he was placed, with his brother and sister, under the legal guardianship of Miss Esylt Newbury, the daughter of a vicar, who operated a benign but restrictive regime. Desperate to be free from such constraints, just before his seventeenth birthday in 1929, he went to New Zealand to enrol on an agricultural course at Waitaki high school. He was soon expelled and embarked on two years of roaming, taking casual jobs, getting into fights, and sleeping rough. As a result of a chance encounter with a distant relative he renewed contact with his mother, now remarried and living in South Africa, and was persuaded to go to that country in 1933. (At first he was classified as an &#145;Asiatic&#146; by the immigration authorities, obsessed by racial categorization even in the period before apartheid.) He found work as a clerk for a mining company in Johannesburg.<br>
<br>Searching for some purpose and order for his life, ffrench-Beytagh came into contact with the Johannesburg branch of Toc H, whose membership included Alan Paton. He experienced a yearning for Christian faith and a dawning sense of vocation to the priesthood. Geoffrey Clayton, bishop of Johannesburg, encouraged this commitment, and sent him for ordination training to St Paul's College, Grahamstown, at that time an all-white college. &#145;The college turned out to be a rather mausoleum-like, dull, brick structure which to me had the psychological impact of a prison&#146;, commented ffrench-Beytagh in his autobiographical <span class="italic">Encountering Darkness</span> (1973). Clayton urged him to persevere, and they remained close friends.<br>
<br>Gonville ffrench-Beytagh was ordained in 1938. Strongly aware of the anarchic tendencies in his personality, and subject to intense bouts of depression, he found great spiritual support in a catholic Anglican spirituality which combined discipline and regularity (he rose daily at 4 a.m. to say the office, and, as a priest, celebrated mass daily), with a sense of freedom and an understanding for the moral waywardness and intractability of the human personality. His pastoral ministry during the war years was pursued with great energy and revealed his gifts as a counsellor and spiritual adviser. His political consciousness remained undeveloped at this stage. He had little contact with non-Europeans in his ministry until he was appointed as priest in charge of St Alban's mission for the coloured (mixed race) community of Johannesburg. Nevertheless, after 1948 he had little sympathy with the National Party's racial policies, and he resigned his South African passport in protest at the passing of the 1953 <span class="roman">Bantu Education Act</span>, to which his bishop, Ambrose Reeves, was vigorously objecting.<br>
<br>In 1954 ffrench-Beytagh was invited to become dean of Salisbury Cathedral in Southern Rhodesia. Again his work was primarily among white Anglicans. But his liberal opinions on race, and his disdain for the reactionary nature of settler politics in Southern Rhodesia, gave an increasingly political edge to his ministry.<br>
<br>In 1965 ffrench-Beytagh returned to South Africa as dean of Johannesburg. For the first time his work brought him into intimate contact with Africans, as the cathedral was beginning to explore ways of embracing all communities in order to become a multiracial congregation. He now became involved in activities which in South Africa were construed as political. In church councils he spoke out against moves to suspend membership of the World Council of Churches (WCC) in protest against the fund to combat racism and WCC support for liberation movements in southern Africa, a campaign which infuriated white South Africa. He led a campaign against the continued house arrest of Helen Joseph, a member of the cathedral's congregation. He strongly criticized apartheid for the damage it caused to family life for Africans, and its criminalization of even the most law-abiding. It was in line with this concern that, when Defence and Aid (the organization for the support of political prisoners and their relatives) was banned in 1967, ffrench-Beytagh determined to continue its work. He set up a personal fund, using money given for this purpose by Alison Norman, a friend from his time in Rhodesia who was now living in Britain. He was careful to steer clear of any hint of association with the leaders of Defence and Aid, including Canon Collins in London, and with those who had worked locally for the organization, such as Winnie Mandela. But as far as the government was concerned ffrench-Beytagh's operation was merely a subterfuge for the continuing activities of Defence and Aid. The security machinery increasingly kept track of the dean's activities, using informers and <i>agents provocateurs</i>.<br>
<br>In 1970 ffrench-Beytagh was arrested and charged under the <span class="roman">Terrorism Act</span> of 1967. He was accused of incitement to overthrow the government, for example by urging members of Black Sash, the liberal women's organization, &#145;to support and prepare for a violent revolution&#146;. He was also indicted for pursuing links with banned organizations such as the African National Congress and the South African Communist Party, for possessing their literature, and for using the money supplied by Alison Norman (who was named as a co-conspirator) to further the aims of those organizations to subvert the regime. His accusers included a member of his congregation, Ken Jordaan&#151;in fact an undercover security officer who had himself incited ffrench-Beytagh to make incautious statements&#151;and a putative member of Black Sash who was actually a government plant. The judge, finding him guilty on three counts, sentenced ffrench-Beytagh to the mandatory five years' imprisonment. This was overturned on appeal in 1972, and ffrench-Beytagh immediately left the country&#151;a decision the wisdom of which he always doubted, and for which he felt a continuing sense of guilt.<br>
<br>Gonville ffrench-Beytagh became a curate at St Matthew's, Great Peter Street, Westminster, and in 1974 rector of a City of London church, St Vedast's. He became honorary canon of Canterbury Cathedral in 1973. His ministry of spiritual counselling and his frank writings and discussion on clinical depression, including <span class="italic">Facing Depression</span> (1978), were combined with an abiding concern for the dehumanizing effect of apartheid (&#145;the blasphemy of apartheid&#146;, as he called it), and with a concern for prisoners of conscience. He retired in 1987, to live in an informal community organized by Alison Norman, who continued to give him practical and emotional support. His collection of meditations, <span class="italic">A Glimpse of Glory</span> (1986), with its extended commentary on George Herbert's poem &#145;Prayer&#146;, well illustrate the style and sources of his spirituality. He never married. He died at the London Hospital, Mile End, London, on 11 May 1991.<br>
