<span class="headword">Threlkeld,  Caleb</span>  (1676&#150;1728), <span class="occ">physician and botanist</span>, the third son of Thomas Threlkeld (1646&#150;1712) and Bridget Brown (<i>c</i>.1654&#150;1712), was born on 31 May 1676 at Keibergh, Kirkoswald, Cumberland. By 1696 he was enrolled as a student in the University of Glasgow; he matriculated into the third class (logic) that year, but did not graduate. He married, on 7 March 1698, Elizabeth Dalrymple, whose father was described as the feudatory laird of Auchin Houry, near Glasgow. He was home in Cumberland by 1699, where John, first of their six children born in England, was baptized on 1 May 1699 in Kirkoswald parish church. From 1700 Threlkeld served as minister at Huddlesceugh Independent Chapel, near Kirkoswald, until his dismissal by chapel elders in November 1712  (TNA: PRO, RG4/566, p. 8). Meanwhile he also studied botany and medicine, collecting and observing plants in Cumberland and elsewhere&#151;for example, during 1707 he botanized around Newcastle upon Tyne.<br>
<br>In 1712 Threlkeld applied to the University of Edinburgh for the degree of doctor of medicine. Having been examined by the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, he was admitted to the degree, the third awarded by the university, and graduated on 20 January 1713. On 26 March 1713 he left Cumberland for Dublin; it is uncertain when his wife and family joined him, but a daughter, Mary, was born in Dublin and died there in February 1715, aged three. In Dublin he practised as a physician and was greatly respected by poorer members of the community. He also preached on Sundays in a conventicle.<br>
<br>Threlkeld botanized about Dublin, collecting specimens and compiling what its title-page defined as the &#145;first essay&#146; on the native flora of Ireland, published in Dublin on 27 October 1726; two subsequent issues are known (Dublin, 1727; London, 1727). <span class="italic">Synopsis stirpium Hibernicarum</span> contained records of over 500 flowering plants, gymnosperms, ferns, and various other cryptogams; 119 plants were recorded from specified localities and over 400 vernacular Irish names were noted.<br>
<br>Threlkeld was accused of plagiarism by Johann Jacob Dillenius (1684&#150;1747), editor of John Ray's <span class="italic">Synopsis methodica stirpium Britannicarum</span> (3rd edn, 1724). This accusation is difficult to maintain. A botanical author frequently relies on the works of his predecessors and Threlkeld acknowledged at least four separate sources for <span class="italic">Synopsis</span>: his own collections, a manuscript attributed to the Revd Richard Heaton (<i>fl</i>. 1633&#150;1666), notes supplied by Dr Thomas Molyneux (1661&#150;1733), and previously published works. Only seventy-five records of Irish native species could have been gleaned from works published before 1726, and most of the alleged lavish, unacknowledged borrowing from John Ray was translated textual material such as accounts of medicinal properties.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Synopsis stirpium Hibernicarum</span>, which, <i>inter alia</i>, contained the earliest printed account of the myth of St Patrick's sermon on the Holy Trinity illustrated by a shamrock, has provoked many contrary opinions. William Sherard (1658&#150;1728) called it &#145;a wretched piece&#146;  (Nichols). Nathanial Colgan (1851&#150;1919), author of <span class="italic">Flora of the County Dublin</span> (1904), described the same book as a &#145;piquant medley of herbal and homily in which this medical missionary from Cumberland delivers himself of his opinions on botany, medicine, morals, theology, witchcraft and the Irish question&#146;  (Colgan, xx). The publication of <span class="italic">Synopsis stirpium Hibernicarum</span> provoked a letter from &#145;Hibernicus&#146; (Francis Hutcheson), printed in the <span class="italic">Dublin Weekly Journal</span>, lambasting Threlkeld's remarks on the political implication of the introduction of the potato into Ireland.<br>
<br>Threlkeld died on 28 April 1728, probably in his home at Mark's Alley, Francis Street, The Coombe, Dublin, and is reported to have been buried in the Cabbage Garden cemetery, near Kevin Street, Dublin. His herbarium&#151;&#145;From twelve Years Observation I collected Specimens for an <i>Hortus Siccus</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Synopsis stirpium Hibernicarum</span>, preface)&#151;has not survived intact, although possible fragments are in Trinity College, Dublin.<br>
<br>
<i>Threlkeldia</i>, a genus of shrubs in the beet family, endemic in Australia, was named by Robert Brown after Threlkeld.<br>
