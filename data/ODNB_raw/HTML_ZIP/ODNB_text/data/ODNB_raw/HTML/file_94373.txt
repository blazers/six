<span class="headword">Reckitt,  Albert Leopold</span>  (1877&#150;1947), <span class="occ">chemical manufacturer and benefactor</span>, was born at Dulwich Wood Park, Upper Norwood, London, on 24 May 1877, the son of George Reckitt (1825&#150;1900), manager of the London office of Reckitt &amp; Sons Ltd, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jackson (1836&#150;1923). Both parents were devout Quakers, in the tradition of the Reckitt family since the seventeenth century. Albert's grandfather, Isaac Reckitt (1792&#150;1862), founded Reckitt &amp; Sons as a starch manufacturer in Hull in 1840 and upon his death in 1862 left the by then thriving starch and blue business to a partnership of George Reckitt and his two younger brothers, Francis and James (later Sir James) Reckitt. George realized his share after a disagreement and went into insurance, a venture that failed and saw him back in the company as manager of the London office (then based at 40 King William Street) by 1870. Of Albert's ten brothers and sisters only two survived past adolescence: his elder brother George Frederic, who joined the London business only briefly before being consigned to a mental home, and his elder sister Juliet, who (like Albert himself) never married, and was active in women's suffrage and social work through most of her life.<br>
<br>Albert Reckitt was educated at Rugby School, leaving in 1894 to study natural sciences (including chemistry) at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1895. He graduated BA with second-class honours in 1898, duly proceeding to MA in 1902. On his father's death in 1900 he became manager of the London office of Reckitt &amp; Sons, holding the position for the rest of his life, and in 1904 became a director of the company. In 1921 he became one of the first trustees of the Sir James Reckitt Trust, set up in support of Quaker charities and the people of Hull. He made his own contribution in establishing and endowing the Albert Reckitt Social Club in Hull Garden Village for the benefit of employees of the company, in memory of his father. In 1922 the London headquarters moved from King William Street to 40 Bedford Square, where he also took up residence. By this time Reckitt &amp; Sons was a multinational company and, as London was the chief calling point of international visitors, he was heavily involved in the business's enterprises abroad.<br>
<br>Reckitt had a deep interest in archaeology and was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He also put money towards financing Sir Leonard Woolley's excavations at Ur in Mesopotamia, in gratitude for which he was given various artefacts from there; these were left in his will to the Fitzwilliam Museum and Museum of Archaeology in Cambridge. In his capacity as a chemist he worked closely from 1929 with bacteriologist W. C. Reynolds to develop the medically endorsed and widely successful Dettol antiseptic disinfectant liquid, which was marketed by Reckitt &amp; Sons from 1933. Regarded as an important development in the science of antisepsis, Dettol was initially marketed for hospital use, especially in maternity cases to combat puerperal fever, but soon became a household name.<br>
<br>Reckitt became vice-chairman of the company under his cousin, Philip Bealby Reckitt, after the 1938 merger with its competitor J. and J. Colman of Norwich. After Philip's death in 1944 he remained chairman of Reckitt and Colman until his own death of a heart attack at his home at Bedford Square on 5 June 1947. He was buried on 10 June at Camberwell old cemetery, Forest Hill Road, London. His estate was valued at &pound;549,354.<br>
<br>Although Reckitt did not actively practise Quakerism as his parents had, he gave generous support to a variety of Quaker and other charities. Besides Dettol and the flourishing company he headed (Reckitt and Colman merged with Benckiser NV in 1999 to form Reckitt Benckiser plc, included in the FTSE index of the 100 largest quoted companies on the London stock exchange) his lasting legacy took the form of three trusts that he set up in 1946, the year before his death, to continue this support. These were confirmed under his will, but the law at the time permitted freedom from estate duty only if he had lived a further five years. In the event, 70 per cent duty was charged on his endowments, a large part of which had to come from the sale of ordinary shares in the company at a time when their value was low. Thus the trusts endowed in his will were reduced to less than a quarter, in most cases, of their intended value.<br>
<br>Not being worth maintaining as independent bodies, Reckitt's research trust became a fund of the Royal Society in 1951 and his archaeological trust was transferred to the British Academy in 1950, where it funds, among other things, a biennial series of Reckitt lectures. His charitable trust set aside monies for Cambridge University and Trinity College; this capital was handed over directly to those bodies in 1950 and the university's share was used to pay the stipend of the curator of the Whipple Museum of the History of Science, and to assist with the museum's practical needs. The charitable trust itself continued to operate independently under the terms of its original deed, supporting the charities Reckitt had supported in his lifetime (although the exact list alters at the discretion of the trustees). The majority of these were charitable institutions of which Reckitt had some personal knowledge in his lifetime, many based in London.<br>
