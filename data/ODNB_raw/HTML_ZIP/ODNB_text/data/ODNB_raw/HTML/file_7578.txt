<span class="headword">Wilde,  Samuel  De</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1751, <em>d.</em> 1832), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was baptized at the Dutch church of Austin Friars, London, on 28 July 1751, the eldest of the two sons of a Dutch woodcarver, also Samuel De Wilde (<i>d</i>. 1753), who had settled in England by 1748 when he married De Wilde's mother, Frances Havart, at St James's Church, Westminster, London. On 19 November 1765 De Wilde was apprenticed for seven years to his godfather, Samuel Haworth, a woodcarver in Denmark Street, Soho. However, he soon showed a talent for painting, broke his apprenticeship, and entered the newly formed Royal Academy Schools on 9 November 1769. At the Royal Academy he would have encountered artists such as Johann Zoffany, whose theatrical portraiture later became a major influence.<br>
<br>We know little of De Wilde's early work: etchings signed P. Paul and mezzotints inscribed S. Paul produced in the 1770s have been attributed to him, but with no real justification. He first exhibited his small portraits at the Society of Artists in 1776 and continued showing there until 1778. From that date onwards he exhibited at the Royal Academy, broadening his <i>&#339;uvre</i> from 1782 onwards with scenes of <i>banditti</i> and fancy pictures. However, he became best-known for his theatrical portraits, which were exhibited almost every year at the academy from 1792 until 1821. He also sent three paintings to the British Institution in 1812.<br>
<br>De Wilde's career in theatrical portraiture began with the start of the publication by John Bell (1745&#150;1831) of the second issue of the <span class="italic">British Theatre</span> in January 1791. Before this the only painting by De Wilde with a theatrical connection seems to have been <span class="italic">William Shuttlewood, the Actor, Aged 21</span> (1788; Yale U. CBA), but this represents an actor in everyday dress. Each number of the <span class="italic">British Theatre</span> consisted of a play accompanied by a vignette and a full-length portrait of a leading actor or actress of the day as one of the characters. Bell chose De Wilde as the portraitist and puffed him in his newspaper, <span class="italic">The Oracle</span>, on 8 April 1791 with the statement: &#145;Zoffany has hitherto been considered as the most celebrated Painter of small whole lengths, but comparison now gives DE WILDE a place as his superior&#146;  (Mayes, &#145;John Bell&#146;, 101). He provided his prot&eacute;g&eacute; with a studio in the British Library, his bookshop on the Strand, and invited potential subscribers to visit the artist at work. De Wilde was extremely productive, painting no fewer than thirty-six character portraits in 1791 and thirty-three in 1792. These paintings show actors and actresses in costume with props, set against a theatrical backdrop. <span class="italic">Thomas Blanchard as Ralph in &#145;The Maid of the Mill&#146;</span> (engraved 1791; Garrick Club, London) is a good example of the series, inspired by Zoffany's theatrical portraits of the 1760s. In total De Wilde provided ninety-three pictures for the series before Bell ran into financial problems and both employer and employee were evicted from the British Library by George Cawthorn, a rival bookseller. The last number of the <span class="italic">British Theatre</span> to bear Bell's imprint was published in August 1795. Only two of De Wilde's plates appeared under Cawthorn's regime and it is likely that these were found in the British Library after the seizure.<br>
<br>By this date, however, De Wilde's career was established. In 1804 business was thriving to the extent that, despite having a studio at his home in Leicester Square, he began to rent additional rooms from the duke of Bedford at 9 Tavistock Row, Covent Garden. Many actors and actresses came from the nearby Drury Lane and Covent Garden theatres to sit to him there and his theatrical portraits adorned numerous publications, including the <span class="italic">Monthly Mirror</span>, John Cawthorn's <span class="italic">Minor British Theatre</span>, and William Oxberry's <span class="italic">New English Drama</span>. <span class="italic">Sarah Harlowe as Beatrice in &#145;The Anatomist&#146;</span> (1805; Royal Collection) is typical, representing a single figure against a plain background. These portraits were also published independently as prints and highly sought after by collectors such as Charles Mathews, whose collection now forms the basis of that of the Garrick Club. As well as painting in oil, De Wilde came to specialize in soft pencil or crayon with light washes of watercolour. His usual fee in 1810 and 1811, as noted in his diary, was &pound;2 12<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. for a watercolour drawing while oil paintings varied upwards in price from a few guineas.<br>
<br>De Wilde's success was clearly wavering by 1810, however, as the diary also records financial loans from friends and he stopped exhibiting at the Royal Academy almost a decade before his death. Some suggest this was due to failing eyesight while others ascribe it to old age and a sense of lack of recognition, particularly as he was never a candidate for election to the Royal Academy  (Mayes, <span class="italic">De Wildes</span>).<br>
<br>Samuel De Wilde died on 19 January 1832 and was buried in the burial-ground adjoining Whitefield's Tabernacle in Tottenham Court Road, London. All that is known about his wife is that she was called Eleanor and that they had two children, Louisa Harriet (<i>b</i>. 1801) and <a name="cosubject_7578"></a><span class="headword">George James  De Wilde</span>  (1804&#150;1871)<span class="occ"></span>. George was born in London on 19 January 1804 and was originally intended for an artistic career. However, he soon showed a predilection for writing and, following a temporary post at the Colonial Office, began working for the <span class="italic">Northampton Mercury</span> <i>c</i>.1830. He became editor for the paper and a major figure in Northampton society, serving as governor to the local infirmary and helping to found the Northampton Central Art Gallery. In 1825 he married Mary Caroline Butterworth, with whom he had five children; after her death he married, in 1845, Louisa Packer, with whom he had a further two children. He died in the <span class="italic">Mercury</span> offices on 16 September 1871.<br>
