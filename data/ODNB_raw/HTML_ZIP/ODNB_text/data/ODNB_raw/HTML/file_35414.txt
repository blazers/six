<span class="headword">Paton,  William</span>  (1886&#150;1943), <span class="occ">minister of the Presbyterian Church of England and missionary</span>, was born on 13 November 1886 at Brixton, London, son of James Paton (<i>d</i>. 1943), sales manager of the Singer Sewing Machine Company, and his wife, Elizabeth Dunlop. The elder brother of five sisters, his family was of Scottish Presbyterian descent. He attended Whitgift School and Pembroke College, Oxford (1904&#150;8), gaining a second class in Greats. At Oxford, he became an active member of the Student Christian Movement (SCM) in response to the preaching of Frank Lenwood. He studied theology at Westminster College, Cambridge (1908&#150;11), and in July 1912 married Grace Mackenzie Macdonald, eldest daughter of the Revd David Macdonald, Presbyterian minister at Bexhill. At the time of their marriage she was secretary to Ramsay MacDonald (no relation). They had two daughters and four sons, the third of whom was the pharmacologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53130/', "Sir William Drummond MacDonald Paton")</script>. Paton was employed until 1921 as secretary to the SCM, and ordained as a Presbyterian minister in 1917.<br>
<br>Paton's work with the SCM, at a time when the watchword of its senior department, the Student Volunteer Missionary Union, was &#145;The evangelisation of the World in this generation&#146;, resulted in a strong sense of calling to missionary service. After a visit to India in 1917&#150;18, Paton returned there in 1921 as secretary of the Indian Young Men's Christian Organisation. Soon afterwards, he was appointed first secretary of the National Christian Council of India, Burma, and Ceylon. While in India he gained direct experience of Hinduism and Islam, and his considerable literary output then and in later years was primarily devoted to asserting the superiority of Christianity while admitting the importance of presenting it with cultural sensitivity. He was convinced that &#145;The work of the missionary is always to prepare for a self-governing Church, and when it is beginning to appear, to subordinate himself to it&#146;  (Sinclair, 67). This emphasis on helping indigenous churches to autonomy was a hallmark of his missionary endeavours throughout his career. In addition to these activities he was instrumental in alerting the League of Nations to the extent of the opium trade, and a consistent advocate of Christian education, particularly of Indian women.<br>
<br>In 1927 Paton returned to England as a secretary of the International Missionary Council (IMC), the office which he held until his death. He was instrumental in the organization of the IMC's Jerusalem meeting in 1928 and the Tambarum meeting in 1938: large ecumenical gatherings for prayer and the discussion of missionary strategy. He travelled widely, undertaking several further trips to India and the United States, and a world tour in 1935&#150;6. In 1938 he became general secretary of the provisional committee of the World Council of Churches at the invitation of William Temple, then archbishop of York, and despite his premature death in 1943 Paton has been aptly described as a &#145;selfless, highly efficient bureaucrat, administrator general of ecumenism&#146;  (Hastings, 304). Yet this bureaucratic efficiency was ever a means to an end; through it he sought to eliminate the institutional obstacles to the preaching of &#145;Christ crucified&#146;. Paton's faith was simple, protestant, and orthodox. When Grace converted to Anglo-Catholicism in 1918, and again to Roman Catholicism in 1934, he supported her decision as &#145;God's will for you&#146;, but was unable to follow her: partly because of the Erastianism he detected in Anglicanism, partly because of his instinctive disinclination towards sacramentalism  (Jackson, 26). Yet the ecumenical atmosphere of his own home, the zeal of his wife for social reform (see her own <span class="italic">The Child and the Nation</span>, 1915), and his enthusiastic role as father of six children were influences which complemented a public life in which immense labours were approached with apparently boundless energy and a boyish sense of humour.<br>
<br>A pacifist and member of the Fellowship of Reconciliation in the First World War, Paton moved towards &#145;political realism&#146;  (Jackson, 61&#150;81) in the twenties and thirties. His first-hand experience of the exploitation of emperor worship for nationalistic purposes in Japan left him with no illusions about totalitarianism, and he was one of the few British churchmen to condemn the Munich agreement in 1938. However, he continued to uphold the rights of conscientious objectors during the Second World War, and campaigned against the banning of pacifist speakers on the BBC in wartime. In co-operation with Bishop George Bell of Chichester, Paton sought the release of German refugees who were imprisoned by the British government as &#145;enemy aliens&#146;. He also negotiated with the Treasury for the transmission of funds to European foreign missions deprived by war of their normal means of support. A consistent advocate of Jewish mission, he also devoted himself to fund-raising for the victims of Nazi antisemitism.<br>
<br>Paton was a prolific writer, his twenty-four books focusing primarily on Christian mission in the context of other world religions. His first book, <span class="italic">Jesus Christ and the World's Religions</span> (1916; rev. edn, 1926), was his most successful, selling more than 50,000 copies, and encapsulated his attitude to mission in the assertion that Christian scholars must &#145;treat other religions sympathetically but remain convinced of the supremacy of the revelation of God in Christ&#146;  (<span class="italic">World's Religions</span>, 1). Other works included his biography, <span class="italic">Alexander Duff</span> (1923), of the nineteenth-century missionary to India, the apologetic <span class="italic">A Faith for the World</span> (1928), and <span class="italic">The Faiths of Mankind</span> (1932). From 1927 onwards Paton was co-editor of the <span class="italic">International Review of Missions</span>.<br>
<br>Paton's sudden death on 21 August 1943, after an operation for an ulcer while on holiday in Kendal, was lamented by many beyond his own denomination; the archbishop of Canterbury, William Temple, testified at his memorial service at St Paul's that &#145;if any man &hellip; could be called indispensable for doing what seemed to many of us the most important tasks entrusted to the Christian people, it was he&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Paton's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_51275"></a><span class="headword">David Macdonald Paton</span>  (1913&#150;1992), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 9 September 1913 in Hampstead, London. He was educated as a scholar at Repton School when Geoffrey Fisher, later archbishop of Canterbury, was headmaster, and at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he obtained a second in classical moderations in 1934 and a third in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1936. From 1936 to 1939 he was midlands secretary of the SCM. He was ordained deacon in 1939 and priest in 1941. In 1940 he went to Hong Kong as curate of St Stephen's Church, and in 1941 he moved to China as a missionary, working mainly in the east Szechwan region. After leaving China (1944) he was chaplain and librarian of Westcott House, Cambridge (1945&#150;6). In 1946 he married China-born Alison Georgina Stewart, with whom he had three sons. From 1947 to 1950 he was back in China as chaplain to the bishop of Fukien. He was then vicar of Yardley Wood, Birmingham (1952&#150;6). His first book, <span class="italic">Christian Missions and the Judgement of God</span> (1953), criticized the colonial mentality of many missionaries and denounced &#145;rice Christianity&#146;. From 1956 to 1959 Paton was a disappointing secretary of the SCM Press. He was more successful as secretary from 1959 to 1963 of the Council for Ecumenical Co-operation of the Church Assembly, and from 1964 to 1969 of its missionary and ecumenical council. He then served as rector of St Mary de Crypt and St John the Baptist, Gloucester, from 1970 to 1981, and as vicar of Christ Church, Gloucester, from 1979 to 1981. He attended the 1975 World Council of Churches assembly at Nairobi and edited its official report, <span class="italic">Breaking Barriers</span> (1976). He was honorary canon of Canterbury Cathedral from 1966 to 1980, then canon emeritus and a chaplain to the queen from 1972 to 1983. His numerous publications included <span class="italic">Anglicans and Unity</span> (1962) and <span class="italic">RO: the Life and Times of Bishop Ronald Hall of Hong Kong</span> (1985), and many book reviews. Although he was regarded by some as &#145;arguably the most farsighted English Anglican this century&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>), senior office eluded him. He died at Harpenden, Hertfordshire, on 18 July 1992 after a long illness, and was survived by his wife and three sons.<br>
