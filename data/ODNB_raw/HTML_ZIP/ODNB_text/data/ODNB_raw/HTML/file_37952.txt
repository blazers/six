<span class="headword">Shaw, Sir  John</span>, first baronet  (<em>c.</em>1615&#150;1680), <span class="occ">customs farmer</span>, was the second in the family of three sons and two daughters of Robert Shaw, wine merchant, of Southwark, Surrey, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of John Domelawe, wine merchant, of London. His father, who was descended from an armigerous Cheshire family, was ruined by taking a share in the wine-licensing patent of 1631. Shaw settled in Antwerp before the civil war as factor to the great Somerset clothier John Ashe of Freshford, whose daughter he married before 1654. Ashe was a prominent parliamentarian; but Shaw advanced &pound;1810 for the purchase of arms for the king's army, and during the interregnum he provided the principal channel of communication between the English royalists and the exiled court. According to Edward Hyde, earl of Clarendon, without him the king at one time could not have got bread.<br>
<br>After returning to England at the Restoration, Shaw became MP for Lyme Regis and one of Clarendon's chief business advisers. He held such a multiplicity of posts that Sir William Coventry described him sarcastically as &#145;a miracle of a man&#146;  (Pepys, 8.398). He was a commissioner of customs, trade, and plantations, and joint paymaster of the Dunkirk garrison until 1662, when he took a share in the great farm of the customs. On obtaining a lease of the crown manor of Eltham, Kent, in 1663, he employed Hugh May to build him a house. He was fortunate to have been accepted as a member of the new customs syndicate in 1667 before Clarendon's fall deprived him of his patron; but the lease was cancelled four years later, when the farmers sought guarantees against the heavy defalcations to be expected in the imminent Dutch war. Thenceforth Shaw held only minor offices, but was still reckoned a government supporter, though &#145;apt to make the gout his excuse&#146;  (Browning, 3.104) for absence from the House of Commons.<br>
<br>Shaw was knighted in 1660 and created a baronet, with three of his partners, in 1665. He and his first wife, Sarah Ashe, who died in 1662, had a son, who succeeded to the baronetcy, and a daughter. On 24 December 1663 he married Bridget, daughter of Sir William Drury of Besthorpe, Norfolk, and widow of a Cheshire landowner, Charles, fourth Viscount Kilmorey; they had two sons and another daughter. He died in his town house in Bloomsbury Square on 1 March 1680, and was buried at Eltham. His younger children were well provided for, and his heirs retained the lease of Eltham until 1839. His widow married as her third husband the royal physician, Sir John Baber.<br>
