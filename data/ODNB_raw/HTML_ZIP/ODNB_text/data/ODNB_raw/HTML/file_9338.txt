<span class="headword">Fergusson,  Robert Cutlar</span>  (1768&#150;1838), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the eldest son of Alexander Fergusson of Craigdarroch, Dumfriesshire, Scotland. He was said to have been well educated, and Mrs Riddell of Glen Riddell, a friend of the poet Robert Burns, thought him in 1793 &#145;everything that is elegant and accomplished&#146;. Fergusson had by then published a tract, <span class="italic">The proposed reform of the counties of Scotland, impartially examined, with observations on the conduct of the delegates</span> (1792), which argued for a widening of the franchise. He went on to study English law at Lincoln's Inn, and was called to the bar on 4 July 1797.<br>
<br>Fergusson's acquaintance with reformers led to his employment as counsel for John Allen, a personal friend, who was tried with James O'Coigly, Arthur O'Connor, and others for high treason at Maidstone on 21 and 22 May 1798. At the trial a number of leading whigs (Erskine, Charles James Fox, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the duke of Norfolk, Lord John Russell, and others) came forward as witnesses for O'Connor. The jury retired at 12.50 a.m. and returned at 1.25 a.m. O'Coigly was found guilty, and the others not guilty. Towards the end of the trial some Bow Street runners were seen in court ready to re-arrest O'Connor on another charge of high treason if he were acquitted. Immediately after Mr Justice Buller had sentenced O'Coigly, and before he had formally discharged the others, O'Connor stepped out of the dock and made a dash for the door. A free fight ensued with the constables trying to seize their man, while friends of the prisoners tried to help him escape. In the confusion lights were overthrown, and sticks brandished. However, O'Connor was seized and brought back.<br>
<br>Fergusson, along with the earl of Thanet and others, was tried for his alleged part in this riot and rescue attempt at the bar of the king's bench on 25 April 1799. Although the evidence against him was tenuous, he was found guilty, fined &pound;100, and ordered to be imprisoned for a year and to find sureties for his good behaviour for seven years. In the same year, he published an account of the proceedings with his own commentary, entitled <span class="italic">The whole proceedings &hellip; by the king's attorney-general against the Rt. Hon. Sackville, earl of Thanet, Robert Fergusson, esq. &hellip;</span>.<br>
<br>Soon after his release Fergusson emigrated to Calcutta, where he practised as a barrister, acting as standing counsel to the government from 1813 to 1818 and as king's advocate from 1818 to 1825. Having amassed a large fortune in India, he returned to Scotland in 1826, where he stood as a Liberal candidate for the stewartry of Kirkcudbright against General Dunlop of Dunlop, and squeaked home by a majority of one. He was a vigorous supporter of all Liberal policies, and was particularly energetic and eloquent in promoting the Liberal position on Poland. In 1834 he was made judge advocate-general, and on 16 July was sworn of the privy council. He went out of office but returned with Lord Melbourne's government. He was director of the East India Company from 1830 to 1835. On 17 May 1832 he married Marie Jos&eacute;phine Auger de Beauchamp, a French aristocrat; they had two children.<br>
<br>Fergusson died in Paris on 16 November 1838, and was buried in the family vault in Craigdarroch in Scotland. He was survived by his wife and children.<br>
