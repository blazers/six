<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Herbert,  Jocelyn</span>  (1917&#150;2003), <span class="occ">theatre and film designer</span>, was born at 12 Hammersmith Terrace, Hammersmith, London, on 22 February 1917, the second of three daughters and second of the four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31222/', "Alan Patrick Herbert (1890&#150;1971)")</script>, author and politician, and his wife, Gwendolen Harriet, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35641/', "Harry Quilter")</script>, art critic. Although he was called to the bar, Herbert's father never practised as a barrister but instead made his name as a writer of wit, joining <span class="italic">Punch</span> in 1924. He had equal success in the theatre, frequently bringing home the cast of his plays to rehearse. Between 1935 and 1950 he was an independent MP for Oxford University; he was knighted in 1945. Herbert's mother had no formal profession, but was an accomplished painter and pianist, and the family attracted a distinguished circle of friends, Robert Graves, Victor Pasmore, Joyce Grenfell, and Naomi Mitchison among them.<br>
<br>Herbert was a shy child. After stints at boarding school and at St Paul's Girls' School, London, she was sent at the age of fifteen to Paris to learn French and the piano, and went every day to paint at the studio of Andr&eacute; Lhote. Crucially she saw the Compagnie des Quinze at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre du Vieux-Columbier, a company founded by Jacques Copeau and at this time led by his nephew Michel Saint-Denis. It was &#145;a revelation &hellip; the sort of theatre, serious theatre, of a kind one had never seen before&#146;  (BL NSA, C465/13).<br>
<br>After studying drawing at Leon Underwood's school in London, Herbert went to Vienna for nine months, where, as well as learning German and attending the opera, she became alert to the rising political tensions of the 1930s. In England she enrolled at the Slade School of Fine Art to study theatre d&eacute;cor under Vladimir Polunin. Although she acknowledged Polunin's skills as a teacher, his limited vision of theatre frustrated her and, hearing that Michel Saint-Denis was intending to establish a school in London, she asked to be admitted. On joining the London Theatre Studio (LTS) in 1936, she began to absorb an approach to theatre that would underpin her future. Like his uncle, Saint-Denis sought to clear the stage of unnecessary clutter and, as Herbert recalled, &#145;was looking for a design that had poetry in it but wasn't naturalistic&#146;  (interview, BL NSA). More than this, his &#145;attitude to the theatre was a way of life, a search for perfection in which everyone's talents contributed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jocelyn Herbert: a Theatre Workbook</span>, 15). Students, whether aspiring actors, designers, or technicians, learned to understand one another's skills. Alongside Saint-Denis, Herbert's teachers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32801/', "George Alexander Cassady Devine (1910&#150;1966)")</script> and the design trio known as Motley, Elizabeth Montgomery and Sophia and Margaret (&#145;Percy&#146;) Harris.<br>
<br>On 11 November 1937 Herbert married the lawyer and art patron Anthony Baruh Lousada (1907&#150;1994), son of Julian George Lousada, solicitor, and her years at the LTS were curtailed when she became pregnant with the first of their four children (three daughters and one son). Setting aside her career while she brought up her family, it was not until 1956, when she was almost forty, that she embarked on her professional life, joining Devine's English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre as a scene painter. The skills and convictions that had taken root at the LTS found their ideal environment amid the extraordinary chemistry of the writers' theatre that Devine was nurturing. On the Court's tiny, beautifully proportioned stage, Herbert worked with directors and writers, relatively inexperienced themselves, to create the first productions of plays that were to define post-war British theatre. Her first major design was for the British premi&egrave;re of Ionesco's <span class="italic">The Chairs</span> in 1957. Not finding a solution using any of the director Tony Richardson's ideas (&#145;I hadn't yet learned that I didn't have to do exactly what a director asked for&#146;; <span class="italic">Jocelyn Herbert: a Theatre Workbook</span>, 21), she returned again and again to the text&#151;the approach she followed all her life&#151;and was relieved when Richardson responded to the sketch she best liked, &#145;a place which had no architectural reality&#146;  (ibid.). The creation of a haunting and specific environment using the minimum of elements was one of Herbert's greatest strengths.<br>
<br>The late 1950s saw Herbert's initial collaborations with three people with whom she went on to form deep friendships and vital working relationships: Samuel Beckett, John Dexter, and Lindsay Anderson. For Beckett she designed the first English-language production of <span class="italic">Endgame</span> (1958), the world premi&egrave;res of <span class="italic">Krapp's Last Tape</span> (1958) and <span class="italic">Footfalls</span> (1976), and the first English productions of <span class="italic">Happy Days</span> (1962) and <span class="italic">Not I</span> (1973), all for the Court, and <span class="italic">Play</span> (1964) for the National Theatre at the Old Vic. Between 1959 and 1960 she worked with Dexter on the first productions of Arnold Wesker's <span class="italic">Trilogy</span>. Their ground-breaking production of Wesker's <span class="italic">The Kitchen</span> (1959) saw the lighting rig and the Court's bare back wall left exposed to the audience, a visually shocking revelation at the time. Dexter's genius for staging met its ideal partner in Herbert and their collaborations were to take them to the Paris Op&eacute;ra and the Metropolitan Opera House in New York, as well as into the West End, to the Haymarket Theatre, Leicester, and to India. Once Lindsay Anderson had got over his alarm at the way Herbert kept removing elements from the set she had put on stage during rehearsals for their first production (the world premi&egrave;re of John Arden's <span class="italic">Serjeant Musgrave's Dance</span>, in 1959), she became his preferred designer. They worked most fluently alongside David Storey, creating the first productions of five of Storey's plays, spanning <span class="italic">Home</span> (1970) and <span class="italic">Early Days</span> (1980). Although she was never as happy working for the cinema, Herbert's film credits included <span class="italic">If &hellip;</span> (1968), <span class="italic">O Lucky Man!</span> (1973), and <span class="italic">The Whales of August</span> (1987) for Anderson.<br>
<br>Herbert's deepest relationship was with George Devine, and by the end of the 1950s they were living together at Rossetti Studios in Chelsea. (Herbert was divorced from Lousada in 1960; he subsequently married Patricia McBride, and was knighted in 1975.) Financed largely by their work on Tony Richardson's film <span class="italic">Tom Jones</span> (Herbert was costume designer and colour consultant, Devine played Squire Allworthy), they rescued and rebuilt a dilapidated cottage, Andrew's Farm, in Long Sutton, Hampshire. In 1965 Herbert designed the premi&egrave;re of John Osborne's <span class="italic">A Patriot for Me</span>, and it was while he was corseted in an evening dress for the drag ball scene that Devine collapsed and suffered a stroke. He died in 1966 and thereafter Andrew's Farm became a vital place of sanctuary for Herbert. But if Herbert was without Devine's physical presence, his spirit and his values never left her. Her role on the council of the English Stage Company and her work on the annual George Devine award ensured the continuation of his influence.<br>
<br>Herbert's extraordinary ability was to remain fresh in her approach while not compromising the ideals which had formed her. The most rejuvenating collaboration of the latter part of her career was with the poet Tony Harrison, with whom she worked on his translation of <span class="italic">The Oresteia</span>, directed by Peter Hall for the National Theatre in 1981, first for the Olivier auditorium and, in 1982, at Epidaurus. (Herbert had been a member of the building committee for the National's new home on the South Bank, and had firm views on how the Olivier should be used.) Inspired by a profound understanding of Greek drama, Harrison and Herbert developed a creative relationship in which the written and visual form of the plays they evolved informed one another, and in many ways Harrison's demands&#151;whether for lions, tigers, and a bear for an amphitheatre in Austria, or an epic month-long journey across Europe in a truck dragging a mighty golden statue for his Channel 4 film <span class="italic">Prometheus</span> (1998)&#151;provided exactly the challenge that Herbert needed.<br>
<br>Herbert's influence as a designer was immense, and her humanity and strength made her as pivotal a figure for a great many people in their daily lives as in the theatre. She was tall, with a natural beauty that seemed to increase as she aged. She was working with Tony Harrison on 6 May 2003, the day she died at Andrew's Farm, of heart disease. Her ashes were scattered at Andrew's Farm. She was survived by her four children.<br>
