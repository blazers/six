<span class="headword">Warren,  Matthew</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1642, <em>d.</em> 1706), <span class="occ">nonconformist minister and tutor</span>, was baptized on 4 December 1642 at Otterford, Somerset, a younger son of John Warren, &#145;a gentleman of good estate&#146;, and his wife, Anne  (Calamy, 2.747). He was educated at Crewkerne grammar school and St John's College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 3 July 1658. At the Restoration he left Oxford and went to Reading for a year with his tutor but then returned to Otterford and began to preach. He held no benefice but was silenced by the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> in 1662.<br>
<br>Warren began a school which developed into an academy for training young men for the nonconformist ministry, one of the first to run such an academy (though such institutions had their antecedents in the training of godly ministers before the civil war). When he began to teach is uncertain but his earliest known pupil is John Shower, who joined him in 1671. About twenty of Warren's pupils are known, including Christopher Taylor (in whose ordination at Lyme Regis on 25 August 1687 Warren took part) and Henry Grove, who eventually succeeded Warren as tutor of the academy. After a year or two Warren moved his academy from Otterford to Taunton. In 1672 he was licensed under the declaration of indulgence as a presbyterian minister for the house of John Hill in Withypool, 24 miles away on Exmoor. The following year, on 14 April, he married Martha Rossiter in St Mary Magdalene Church, Taunton.<br>
<br>In 1687 Warren and Emmanuel Harford were called to be joint ministers of Pauls Meeting Presbyterian Church, built in Taunton in 1672 but closed in the disturbed times leading up to the Monmouth rebellion and opened again under James II's declaration of indulgence. Harford was linked to Warren by marriage. Warren continued to run the academy and the students, lay and ministerial, lived in his house as part of his family, the course normally lasting five years. Warren lectured in Latin, the usual language of converse in the academy. Warren, Harford, and the ministerial students preached in the village chapels in the vicinity, including Bishops Hull, Pitminster, and Hatch. Warren thought that the best system for ministerial training was <span class="roman">Bible</span> study but encouraged freedom of thought and the study of contemporary learning. Students seeking a church were issued with a certificate of proficiency signed by both Warren and Harford. Warren preached occasionally at meetings of the Exeter Assembly of presbyterian and congregationalist ministers, which gave bursaries to some of his students, but which in 1695 complained that some of them had Baptist beliefs.<br>
<br>Warren's son, another Matthew, is recorded in a Pauls Meeting document of 1699 as participating in a pastoral visitation. On 14 April 1692, after Martha's death, Warren married Elizabeth Baker at St Mary Magdalene; they had a son, also called Matthew, who was baptized at Pauls Meeting on 9 July 1704 when Warren was sixty-one, and who is recorded in the register of baptisms that Warren had started in 1699. Warren also took part in the town life of Taunton, acting as a conservator of the River Tone in 1698.<br>
<br>Warren died on 14 June 1706 at Taunton, and was buried in St Mary Magdalene, where there used to be a memorial to him. In his will he set aside &pound;400 to be put out at interest for the education and maintenance of his son until he reached adulthood; the rest of his estate he left to his widow. John Sprint of Milborne Port preached his funeral sermon which was published with a memoir, thought to be by Christopher Taylor, who also wrote a Latin epitaph for Warren. Calamy, whose account drew heavily on the memoir, wrote that:<blockquote>Many young gentlemen that now behave worthily in civil stations, and others that are useful in the ministry, owe their education to him: and all that knew him, own him to have been well qualified for the service he did them, by a good share of useful learning joined with humility, modesty and good humour, which were his distinguishing characters. (Calamy, 2.747)</blockquote>Harford died two months after Warren, and Sprint also preached his funeral sermon. Warren and Harford began their ministry with a small, fearful congregation but finished with a confident following of almost two thousand. Pauls Meeting in Paul Street became Taunton United Reformed Church in 1972.<br>
