<span class="headword">Low,  David</span>  (1768&#150;1854), <span class="occ">Scottish Episcopal bishop of Ross and Argyll and the Isles</span>, was born in November 1768 in Brechin, Forfarshire, one of four children. He came from a traditional Episcopalian family which was staunchly Jacobite, and his father, a tradesman, was particularly solicitous of his education. Educated in the local school, he later attended Marischal College, Aberdeen, in preparation for his ordination in the Scottish Episcopal church. Episcopalian necessity dictated that he receive his theological education in the home of one of the more learned clergy, in Low's case with Bishop George Gleig at Stirling. He was then tutor to the family of a Mr Patullo of Balhouffie, Fife, for a year and a half. Appointed to the tiny nonjuring congregation at Perth, he was ordained deacon on 5 December 1787 and priest on 4 February 1789. In September 1789 he was elected priest of the nonjuring congregation at Pittenweem, an appointment he retained until his death. Much of his local influence was due to his alliance with influential local gentry, particularly Archibald, earl of Kellie. Low's ministry was hampered by shyness and a disposition to solitude, which could become irritability under pressure. This did not prevent him from also ministering to nearby congregations in Craill and Cupar. Low's personal appearance was described by a contemporary as &#145;most striking&#151;thin, attenuated, but active&#151;his eye sparkling with intelligence&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 2nd ser., 43, 1855, 423).<br>
<br>In 1819 Low was elected bishop of the united dioceses of Ross and Argyll and the Isles; he was consecrated bishop at Stirling on 14 November 1819. Marischal College consequently awarded him a DD in 1820. Two of his charges to his diocesan clergy, in 1823 and 1826, were his only publications, although he retained a particular interest in genealogy. He was a constant, though necessarily intermittent, visitor throughout his huge dioceses with their small Episcopalian populations. To support them, he was instrumental in 1831 in founding the Episcopalian Gaelic Society to provide Gaelic religious literature and financial support. Low was also active in the wider support of his church, lobbying influential peers and MPs during the 1820s for the resuscitation of the <i>regium donum</i> grant to the Episcopal church, which became regular again in 1830. He also pressed for the removal of the legal disabilities on Episcopalian clergy ministering in England, a restriction resulting from the legal toleration granted to the Episcopal church in 1792. This concern made Low hostile to Episcopalian traditions at odds with the Church of England; he desired the suppression of the Scottish communion office traditional to nonjuring episcopalianism. He was elected bishop of Moray in 1838.<br>
<br>Low was a central figure in the legal mitigation of Episcopalian disabilities in 1840, but his most enduring legacy to his own church was a consequence of his unmarried state and frugal nature. As incumbent of one of the few wealthy Episcopalian incumbencies, he was able to become a generous benefactor to various Episcopal causes, such as the Episcopalian Church Society for the development of church infrastructure and Trinity College, Glenalmond, as a public school and seminary. When Argyll and the Isles became a separate diocese in 1847, he was able to endow it with &pound;8000. Low kept up a regular correspondence with American Episcopalians, which resulted in the award in 1848 of an honorary DD from Hartford College, Connecticut, and another from Geneva College, New York. He was also an early connection between the Episcopal church and the Oxford Movement in the Church of England through his practice of inviting English priests to tour his dioceses with him during the summer months. In 1838 John Henry Newman's curate, William Copeland, was his chaplain.<br>
<br>In his last years Low was able to overcome his lack of self-confidence to an extent and became in Episcopalian circles a figure venerated for his personal connections with the penal days of their church. He died at his home in the restored Pittenweem priory on 26 January 1854. His funeral at the Pittenweem Episcopal Church was on 1 February 1854; he was buried at a specially consecrated site adjacent to the chancel of the priory's chapel.<br>
