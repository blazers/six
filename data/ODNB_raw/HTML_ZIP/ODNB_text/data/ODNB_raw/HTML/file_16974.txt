<span class="headword">Long,  Robert Ballard</span>  (1771&#150;1825), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, one of the six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16964/', "Edward Long (1734&#150;1813)")</script>, judge and historian of Jamaica, and his wife, Mary Ballard (<i>d</i>. 16 July 1797, aged sixty-two), widow of John Palmer, and daughter and heir of Thomas Beckford of Jamaica, was born in Chichester on 4 April 1771, the elder of twin sons. His brother was Charles Beckford Long (<i>d</i>. 1836) of Langley Hall in Berkshire and his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16963/', "Charles Edward Long (1796&#150;1861)")</script>. He was educated at Dr Thomson's school, Kensington, Harrow School (1780&#150;89) under Dr Drury, and at the University of G&ouml;ttingen, in Hanover, where he took a course of military instruction. On 4 May 1791 he was appointed cornet in the 1st King's dragoon guards, in which he became lieutenant in April and captain in November 1793. He served with the regiment in Flanders under the duke of York in 1793&#150;4, and was deputy adjutant-general to General Sir George Don in the winter retreat to Germany in 1794&#150;5. He returned home from Cuxhaven in January 1796, and after serving at Portsmouth as brigade major and aide-de-camp to General Sir William Pitt, whose friendship subsequently helped his career, he became a major in the York rangers (though he probably did not serve with them). He bought the lieutenant-colonelcy of the Hompesch mounted riflemen from the regiment's proprietor, Baron Hompesch, Long's father paying &pound;2000 for this. Long became lieutenant-colonel of the regiment on 3 March 1798, and commanded it in Ireland against the 1798 uprising when it was employed under General John Moore in Wexford. In 1800 he was transferred to the York hussars, a fine foreign unit, which he commanded, chiefly at Weymouth, until it was disbanded in 1802 at the peace of Amiens. After studying at the senior department, Royal Military College, High Wycombe, Long was appointed lieutenant-colonel in the 16th light dragoons, and was transferred in December 1805 to the 15th light dragoons, of which Ernest, duke of Cumberland (later Ernest I of Hanover) was colonel. Cumberland repeatedly interfered, and relations between him and Long were hostile. Nevertheless Long remained lieutenant-colonel of the 15th for the rest of his life. Under Long's command the regiment was converted in 1806 to hussars, and its distinctive headdress was copied from the York hussars. Long was appointed brevet-colonel on the staff in Spain in 1808. He landed on 15 January 1809 at Corunna, the night before the battle, at which he was present, but held no command. He was adjutant-general to Lord Chatham on the disastrous 1809 Walcheren expedition. In 1810 he joined Wellington's army in Portugal, with the rank of brigadier-general, and commanded a brigade of cavalry under General William Carr Beresford in the actions of Campo Maior and Los Santos, and under Sir Rowland Hill in the operations of 1811&#150;12. At Campo Maior, on 25 March 1811, he initially fought well; then he &#145;lost his head completely&#146;  (Fortescue, <span class="italic">Brit. army</span>, 8.133). Near Santa Marta on 15 May 1811 Long retreated, in the judgement of Beresford and his staff, with unjustified haste and showing insufficient resistance. Near Elvas on 23 June 1811, partly through Long's faulty dispositions, the British lost relatively heavily in casualties and captives; Wellington reprimanded Long. He commanded a brigade, composed of the 19th and 13th light dragoons, at the battle of Vitoria, 21 June 1813 (gold medal), and in Hill's operations in the Pyrenees and the investment of Pamplona. Wellington privately considered Long incompetent and, at Wellington's request, the commander-in-chief (Frederick, duke of York) in December 1812 recalled Long, against his wishes. Long returned, indignant, and declined an offer of a command in Scotland.<br>
<br>After his return home Long, who had become major-general in 1811, and was made lieutenant-general in 1821, resided in various places before finally settling at Barnes Terrace, Surrey. He died at Berkeley Square, London, on 2 March 1825, and was interred in the family vault in the church at Seale, Surrey.<br>
<br>Long had disagreements with Marshal Beresford when under his command in the Peninsula. After Long's death his nephew, Charles Edward Long, published in 1832 and 1833 two pamphlets, attempting to vindicate his uncle's conduct, especially at Campo Maior, from criticism in W. F. P. Napier's <span class="italic">History of the Peninsular War</span> (6 vols., 1828&#150;40), and in some letters of Lord Beresford  (see <span class="italic">Naval and Military Gazette</span>, April and 31 Aug 1833). Long's Peninsular War correspondence, edited by T. H. McGuffie, was published in <span class="italic">Peninsular Cavalry General (1811&#150;13)</span> (1951).<br>
