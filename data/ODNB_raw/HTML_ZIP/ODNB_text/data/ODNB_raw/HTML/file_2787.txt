<span class="headword">Bolckow,  Henry William Ferdinand</span>  (1806&#150;1878), <span class="occ">ironmaster</span>, was born at Sulten, Mecklenburg, Germany, on 8 December 1806, the son of Heinrich B&ouml;lckow, of Varchow, Mecklenburg, and his wife, Caroline Dussher. He had at least five sisters and a brother. About 1821 his parents placed him in a merchant's office at Rostock. He made the acquaintance there of Christian Allhusen, who soon migrated to Newcastle upon Tyne, where, in 1827, Bolckow joined him in a corn merchant's business. After twelve years of dealings Bolckow had accumulated more than &pound;40,000; he then severed his partnership in Newcastle, and instead entered into one with a practical ironmaker, John Vaughan. Bolckow became naturalized in 1841, and that year he and Vaughan opened an iron and engineering works on the Tees at the small coal-shipping port of Middlesbrough. In 1846 they started blast furnaces to produce iron at Witton Park in co. Durham, and in 1850 Vaughan began to exploit the Cleveland ironstone near to Middlesbrough. By 1855 the partners had a dozen blast furnaces making iron on Teesside and the spectacular growth of the district's industry and population was proceeding: from 8000 in 1851, the population of Middlesbrough increased to 40,000 in 1871.<br>
<br>The success of the partners' business enabled them to multiply their possessions: besides ironworks, they acquired collieries, limestone quarries, additional ironstone workings, and brickfields. Middlesbrough received a charter of incorporation in 1853 and Bolckow was elected the first mayor. He married Miriam Hay <i>n&eacute;e</i> Poole, widow of C. Hay, about 1840, but she died in 1842. In 1851 he married Harriet, the only daughter of James Farrar of Halifax. She died on 13 August 1890.<br>
<br>In 1864 the partnership of Bolckow and Vaughan was formed into a limited liability company with a capital of &pound;2,500,000, Bolckow becoming chairman of the company on 1 January 1865. In 1868 he presented to the inhabitants of Middlesbrough the Albert Park, at a cost of more than &pound;20,000. In the following year he spent &pound;7000 in the erection of the St Hilda's schools. When the town was granted parliamentary representation Bolckow was unopposedly elected the first member on 16 November 1868, and held that position until his death. In the election of 1874, when he was returned as a Liberal, he was opposed.<br>
<br>Bolckow built up a fine collection of pictures, mainly by contemporary artists. A JP, and sometime deputy lieutenant for the North Riding of Yorkshire, he was also a knight of the order of the Wendish Crown. He died at Ramsgate, Kent, on 18 June 1878, and was buried in Marton churchyard, near Middlesbrough, on 22 June. He left an estate valued at under &pound;800,000. The major part of this passed to a nephew, Carl F. H. Bolckow, who assumed the chairmanship of Bolckow, Vaughan &amp; Co. Ltd. One of his sisters, who predeceased him, was the wife of the Teesside ironmaster W. R. I. Hopkins.<br>
