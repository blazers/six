<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bateman,  Henry Mayo</span>  (1887&#150;1970), <span class="occ">cartoonist</span>, was born on 15 February 1887, of English parents, at Moss Vale, Sutton Forest, New South Wales, Australia, the only son and the elder of two children of Henry Charles Bateman (1857&#150;1940), then a farmer and later an export packager, and his wife, (Amelia) Rose Mayo, formerly Brooks (1865&#150;1956). The family returned to England in 1888.<br>
<br>Nicknamed Binks, Bateman was educated at Forest Hill House, which he left at the age of sixteen to study drawing and painting at Westminster School of Art, London, and then at Goldsmiths' College at New Cross, and for two or three years in the London studio of Charles van Havenmaet. In 1903 his first published drawing appeared in <span class="italic">Scraps</span> and the tentative beginnings of his long association with <span class="italic">The Tatler</span> magazine occurred the following year. He found it unusually difficult to choose between a career as a fine artist and one as a cartoonist but on his twenty-first birthday he decided to fulfil a childhood ambition &#145;to make people laugh&#146;, which correct choice of m&eacute;tier was nevertheless followed by a prolonged nervous breakdown.<br>
<br>In 1909 the diffident, moody young Bateman, in his own words, &#145;went mad on paper&#146;  (<span class="italic">H. M. Bateman by Himself</span>, 61). He began drawing people not as they looked but as they felt&#151;then an unusual concept. Among his earliest influences were Phil May and Tom Browne, but especially two artists of comic genius&#151;Henry Ospovat and, particularly, Emmanuel Poir&eacute; (Caran d'Ache). In his introduction to <span class="italic">Caran d'Ache the Supreme</span> (1933) Bateman described him as &#145;the greatest master of the art of telling a story in pictures&#146;. Both artists provided the impetus towards Bateman's refreshing and occasionally disconcerting freedom of expression. The humour of his line was an intrinsic part of the cartoon. According to P. V. Bradshaw, &#145;If he seldom saw beauty in his subjects he always supplied it in his line&#146;  (Bradshaw, pt 16, p. 7). There was youthful cynicism in his humour and &#145;a certain suspicion of virulence&#146;  (ibid., 5). This was partly based on an awareness of convention and the grudging acceptance of its constraints rather than a rebellion against it. Bateman neither looked nor acted the part of the bohemian artist. He dressed conventionally, as many artists dressed in those days, even at the drawing-board.<br>
<br>For the (glossy) <span class="italic">Sketch</span>, and billed as &#145;Our Untamed Artist&#146;, Bateman caricatured theatre personalities from life. He also sketched imaginary (and hilarious) but totally convincing pianists, singers, and music-hall performers, but above all he drew suburbia&#151;viewed at first hand from his home, Parkstone, 40 Nightingale Lane, Clapham, London. According to one contemporary observer, cited by Anderson, &#145;It is fair and reasonable to call Clapham the capital of Suburbia&#146;  (Anderson, 51). In his pre-First World War cartoons for <span class="italic">London Opinion</span>, <span class="italic">The Sketch</span>, and <span class="italic">The Bystander</span> every nuance of gentility was noted and later brought together in his first collection of cartoons, <span class="italic">Burlesques</span> (1916); others appeared in <span class="italic">Suburbia</span> (1922).<br>
<br>Bateman attempted to overcome shyness and to release pent-up energies by taking lessons in boxing and, incongruously, tap-dancing. After volunteering for military service in 1915 the far from robust cartoonist was hastily returned to civilian life where the ignominy of rejection accentuated a tendency towards depression which was partly assuaged by numerous fishing expeditions in the company of his closest friend, the author and gourmet William Caine. Until his sudden death in 1925, Caine was also the subject of many Bateman cartoons. <span class="italic">Punch</span> began publishing his work in 1915, at a time when an increasing melancholy somehow transmogrified into an even livelier humour. He brought to perfection the strip without words, of which &#145;The Boy who Breathed on the Glass in the British Museum&#146; (British Museum, London) is a classic example. Many of his best cartoons in this genre were reprinted in <span class="italic">A Book of Drawings</span> (1921), with an introduction by G. K. Chesterton. His output was prodigious and highly paid.<br>
<br>Bateman was an active if reserved member of the Chelsea Arts Club and the London Sketch Club, but even these amiable islands of male <i>bonhomie</i> in a male-oriented world could not altogether cheer him up. After the First World War he moved from London to Reigate, Surrey, where for fourteen years he lived quietly but industriously. He was not entirely a recluse. On 29 September 1926, at St Mark's Church in Hamilton Terrace, Maida Vale, London, he married Brenda Mary Collison Weir (1903?&#150;1988), the daughter of Octavius Weir, a country gentleman from Stratford St Mary, Suffolk; the couple had two daughters. Bateman and his wife were like chalk and cheese: at first the novelty of their differences wore well but not for long. He was at the height of his fame, yet his wife&#151;who adored his cartoons&#151;wistfully observed, &#145;I thought he'd be more funny than he was&#146;  (interview, &#145;The Man who Went Mad on Paper&#146;). This lament lasted throughout their marriage.<br>
<br>The genesis of a series which would in time bring Bateman worldwide fame began in 1912 with &#145;The Missed Putt&#146;, which he considered to be the first of <span class="roman">The Man Who &hellip;</span> cartoons which illustrated social gaffes and clangers based on middle- and upper-middle-class aspirations, snobbery, manners, and etiquette. The first of the full-colour, double-page spreads in <span class="italic">The Tatler</span> appeared in 1922 with &#145;The Guardsman who Dropped It&#146; (Cavalry and Guards Club, London), soon followed by many more in similar vein, such as &#145;The Man who Lit his Cigar before the Royal Toast&#146; and &#145;The Man who Asked for a Double Scotch in the Grand Pump Room at Bath&#146; (Grand Pump Room, Bath). In most drawings, with humour strengthened by accurate observation, a serenely innocent figure, or someone crushed with embarrassment, is surrounded by a writhing assembly ululating with outrage.<br>
<br>Further collections of Bateman's work appeared: <span class="italic">Rebound</span> (1927), <span class="italic">Brought Forward</span> (1931), and <span class="italic">Considered Trifles</span> (1934). One-man exhibitions were held, beginning with one at the Brook Street Gallery, London, in 1911, followed by two at the Leicester Galleries, London, in 1919 and 1921, and another in Sydney, Australia, in 1938. As the Second World War began, a luxury edition of the best of <span class="roman">The Man Who &hellip;</span> had to be abandoned when a bomb destroyed the plates. <span class="roman">The Man Who &hellip;</span> was essentially formulaic and in time Bateman grew bored with the repetition; his style became &#145;tricksy&#146; (his own word) and lost the zest of earlier works. Cartooning also took its toll of his &#145;straight&#146; draughtsmanship, though his little volume <span class="italic">The Art of Drawing</span> (1926) was and remains a classic exposition of basic skills. Apart from his autobiography (<span class="italic">H. M. Bateman by Himself</span>, 1937) he wrote and illustrated several books, including <span class="italic">The Evening Rise</span> (1960), and illustrated many more. Among his authors were Lewis Carroll, George Robey, William Caine, and A. P. Herbert. Advertisers bid for <span class="roman">The Man Who &hellip;</span> to promote Shell, Colman's mustard, Guinness, the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>, and Kensitas, Lucky Strike, and Bar-One cigarettes, among many (perhaps too many) others.<br>
<br>Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, as a highly paid cartoonist Bateman decided he could afford the luxury of semi-retirement. With advancing years his moroseness and some surprising meannesses increased and in 1947 he separated from his family, moving to Brook Cottage, Sampford Courtenay, Devon, where he lived from 1953 and indulged in and wrote about his lifelong recreation of trout fishing with the fly. The Inland Revenue, which had once provided him with some of his funniest cartoons, became the object of a sad, paranoiac obsession, resulting in (mostly unpublished) cartoons containing his virulence but not the beauty of line nor much of the humour of his earlier work. That bee-in-a-bonnet apart, he was in old age an upright figure, as clipped, neat, and peppery as the &#145;Colonels&#146; (1924) he drew with relish and affection, and, when he chose, he could be an amiable host. An exhibition of his work was held at the Fine Art Society, London, in 1962.<br>
<br>In the late 1960s, tired of a post-war Britain in which he felt totally alien, Bateman moved to the Maltese island of Gozo where, with the Royal Lady Hotel at Mgarr as his base, he painted landscape watercolours which failed to achieve the high standards he set himself. Humour was his forte. Thanks to the ubiquity of embarrassment his best cartoons, and there are many, will ring comically true as long as human nature persists.<br>
<br>H. M. Bateman died of heart failure on 11 February 1970 while taking his usual solitary morning walk. He was buried in the English church on Malta. Posthumous exhibitions of his work were held at the Leicester Galleries, London, in 1974, and the Langton Gallery, London, in 1978, 1980, and 1981. Some of his drawings are in the collection of the Cartoon Art Trust.<br>
