<span class="headword">Tofte <span class="st"> [Tafte]</span>,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1562, <em>d.</em> 1619/20), <span class="occ">poet and translator</span>, was baptized in the parish of St Magnus the Martyr, London, on 15 January 1562, the younger son of William Tofte, a fishmonger (<i>d</i>. 1563) and his wife, Mary, the daughter of John Cowper, fishmonger and alderman for the ward of Bridge Without. The family seems to have originally been in the wool trade in the Guildford area. C. A. O. Fox claims he was the Robert Tafte (aged nineteen) who matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, on 24 November 1581. He could also be the Robert Tafte, gentleman, who was paid for carrying official letters to Sir Edward Stafford, ambassador to France, in October 1590. Tofte did at times use the spelling Tafte for his name  (Williams, 286). It seems he never married, and had a private income.<br>
<br>Tofte travelled around Italy from March 1591 to June 1594, and showed a keen interest in things Italian, which resulted in a manuscript, &#145;Discourse of the five laste Popes&#146; (now Lambeth MS 1112). Although he took a dispassionate interest in Roman Catholic theology and church organization, he remained firmly protestant. He also became very familiar with the conventions of pastoral poetry. Renaissance pastoral depicted love and other pleasures in an idealized country setting, while often commenting on contemporary events, both public and private, and like the medieval courtly love poem it was a safe cover for declaring one's passion for an unattainable lady. Before Tofte left Italy he began <span class="italic">Laura</span>, a collection of short pastoral poems, and a short sonnet sequence &#145;moste parte conceived in Italie, and some of them brought foorthe in England&#146;.<br>
<br>On his return to Britain in 1594 Tofte was embroiled in a lawsuit before the court of queen's bench over the banking arrangements for his trip. Tofte claimed that he had paid William Garraway, a London merchant, &pound;45 16<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. for bills of exchange that were to be cashed in Venice for 200 ducats. But Garraway's agent refused to honour the bills. Tofte sought damages of &pound;100 for loss of credit. It is not known how the matter was resolved. In 1597 he published <span class="italic">Laura</span>, dedicating it to Lady Lucy Percy, the daughter of the eighth earl of Northumberland, and <span class="italic">Two Tales Translated out of Ariosto</span>. At this time he was living in the inns of court, but in 1598 he took rooms in Mistress Goodall's house near Barnard's Inn in Holborn. That year he published a translation of Matheo Maria Boiardo's <span class="italic">Orlando inamorato</span>, and his most important work, <span class="italic">Alba</span>, a cycle of poems on unrequited love dedicated to Anne Herne, the wife of Sir Edward Herne and sister of Sir John Brooke, to whom one of the prefatory poems is written. It is now extremely rare, and was edited in 1880 by Alexander Grosart.<br>
<br>Like Philip Sidney's <span class="italic">Astrophil</span>, <span class="italic">Alba</span> is probably autobiographical. It seems that Alba was a young married woman of the Caryll family with whom Tofte was infatuated. Grosart suggests she was Mary Caryll, the daughter of Sir Thomas Caryll of Bentone, Sussex. She married Sir Richard Molyneux of Sefton, who became Viscount Molyneux of Mayborough. She seems to have led Tofte on for many years before finally dropping him. Even the forematter of <span class="italic">Alba</span> observes pastoral convention: the last eight of its lyrics are arranged in the form of the song contest common in classical pastoral  (cf. Virgil, <span class="italic">Eclogues</span> III, V, and VII). A number of these poems play on Tofte's nickname, Robin Redbreast. <span class="italic">Alba</span> is also notable for a reference to Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Love's Labour Lost</span>, in which Tofte saw a parallel to his own predicament.<br>
<br>In March 1599 came <span class="italic">Of Mariage and Wiving: an Excellent, Pleasant and Philosophicall Controversy</span>, Tofte's translation of Ercole Tasso's <span class="italic">Dello ammogliarsi piacevole</span>, in which Tasso argues against marriage and his brother, Torquato, defends it. This book was burnt at Stationers' Hall on 4 June 1599 under the provisions against satire. Another work on a similar theme, <span class="italic">The Bachelor's Banquet</span> (1603), a version of <span class="italic">Les quinze joies de mariage</span>, was probably by Tofte, and promised, in its full title, discourses on &#145;the variable humours of women, their quicknesse of wittes, and unsearchable deceits&#146;. By this time it seems Tofte was acquiring a reputation for misogyny. His next work appeared in 1608, <span class="italic">Ariosto's Satyres</span>, published under the name of Gervais Markham, which Tofte bitterly resented. In the preface to his <span class="italic">Blazon of Jealousie</span> (1615) he writes:<blockquote>I had thought for thy better contentment to have inserted (at the end of the Booke) the disastrous fall of three noble Roman Gentlemen, overthrowne thorow jealousie, in their Loves; but the same was, with <span class="roman">Ariosto's Satyres</span> (translated by mee out of Italian into English Verse, and Notes upon the same) Printed without my consent or knowledge, in another man's name.</blockquote>The publisher reissued the book in 1611, without the name of the translator. Tofte's other translations are <span class="italic">Honours Academie</span> (1610), from the French of Nicolas de Montreux, and Benedetto Varchi's <span class="italic">Blazon of Jealousie</span> published &#145;with special notes&#146; in 1615.<br>
<br>Tofte was buried at St Andrew's, Holborn, on 24 January 1620. His long will specifically excludes &#145;my kinnesfolkes whose underserved unkyndenes and ingratitude towardes me hath estranged my harte from them&#146;. Apart from the poor of the parish and certain friends, the beneficiaries of his will are a network of cousins belonging to the Urrie family of Thorlie, Isle of Wight, and the Day family of West Drayton, Middlesex. Tofte left a considerable estate, bequeathing about &pound;750 in cash and almost the same amount in personal effects.<br>
