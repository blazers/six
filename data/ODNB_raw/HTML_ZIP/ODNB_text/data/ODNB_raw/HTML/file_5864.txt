<span class="headword">Cole,  William</span>  (1753&#150;1806), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Mersham, Kent, on 8 December 1753. The names of his parents are not recorded, but his education was much assisted by a friend of his mother's, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5121/', "John Chapman (bap. 1705, d. 1784)")</script>, archdeacon of Sudbury and rector of Mersham. Cole's obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> may suggest that he was Chapman's son. He was sent to Ashford School, then to a private school at Bierton, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. He was admitted as a king's scholar at Eton College in 1766, and he was there a favourite of the headmaster, Dr John Foster. On 11 August 1773 he was made scholar of King's College, Cambridge, where he was a fellow from 1776 to 1781. He graduated BA in 1778 and proceeded MA in 1781.<br>
<br>In 1777 Cole returned to Eton as an assistant master but was dogged by ill health, having ruptured a blood vessel in his lungs as an undergraduate. On 14 March 1779 he was ordained priest by Edmund Keene, bishop of Ely. He resigned from Eton for health reasons in 1780 and became tutor to George Spencer, marquess of Blandford, and Lord Henry Spencer, the sons of George Spencer, fourth duke of Marlborough, to whom he became chaplain. He dedicated his &#145;Oratio de ridiculo&#146; to the duke&#151;the work won the first of Sir William Browne's medals at Cambridge University. This was printed along with some Latin verse in 1780. Cole later published several sermons, and wrote the Latin preface to <span class="italic">Gemmarum antiquarum delectus</span>, an account of Marlborough's collection of antiquities published in two volumes in 1780 and 1791. In 1781 he was inducted to the rectory of Waddesdon (first portion), Buckinghamshire, on the presentation of the duke of Marlborough, but resigned it in 1788 when collated to the rectory of his birthplace, Mersham, by John Moore, archbishop of Canterbury. He held the rectory until his death. In 1792 he was appointed prebendary of Westminster and in 1795 received the degree of DD by the archbishop's diploma during the visitation of the diocese of Canterbury. In 1795 he married Mary, second daughter of the legal authority <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2536/', "Sir William Blackstone")</script>; they had no children. In 1796 he was presented to the vicarage of Shoreham, Kent, by the dean and chapter of Westminster. Following several years of ill health, Cole died on 25 September 1806, and was buried in the north aisle of Westminster Abbey on 4 October.<br>
