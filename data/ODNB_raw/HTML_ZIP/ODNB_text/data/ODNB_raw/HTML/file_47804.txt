<span class="headword">Luard,  Henry</span>  (1792&#150;1860), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 4 December 1792, the fifth son of Captain Peter John Luard (<i>d</i>. 1830) of Blyborough Hall, Lincolnshire, and his wife Louisa, daughter of Charles Dalbiac, of Hungerford Park, Wiltshire. Luard was one of eight brothers; he had no sisters. His eldest brother inherited the Lincolnshire property on the death of their father in 1830. Of the remaining six, three entered the army, two the church, and one took up a medical career.<br>
<br>By contrast, Henry Luard, the only son not educated for a profession, was taken on at an early age by a mercantile trading house, probably in the City of London. His intuitive grasp of figures was recognized at once and he was quickly promoted to the responsible position of ledger keeper. This provided him with a sound commercial education, laying the groundwork for a long career in banking and commerce. A man of stout physical appearance, Luard, with widespread family connections and a number of distinguished musical attainments, moved easily between the business world of the City and the pleasant diversions of polite metropolitan society. On 13 November 1824 he married Jane, daughter of William Richards of Clatford, Hampshire. Together they had four sons, the eldest being <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17116/', "Henry Richards Luard")</script>, university registrary.<br>
<br>By the 1830s Luard's career was firmly in the ascendant, with appointments as director of the London Life Association and deputy chairman of the Southampton Dock Company. Luard was chiefly known, however, for his role as general manager of the London and County Bank between 1841 and 1856. Established in 1836, the London and County Bank was one of the new wave of joint-stock banks formed in the metropolis following the liberalization afforded by the <span class="roman">Bank Charter Act</span> of 1833. Despite considerable business success, the bank quickly gained a reputation as a somewhat unlucky institution, and its first two decades were marred by ill-judged and, on occasion, fraudulent activities on the part of its most senior managers. Luard's appointment in 1841 was, in fact, occasioned by the unexplained disappearance of the previous general manager Thomas Dighton in connection with serious errors of commercial judgement.<br>
<br>Showing strong determination of character, allied to his long-standing financial experience and an iron constitution, Luard worked unceasingly to remedy the bank's affairs, instituting a series of structural reforms in the operation and management of the bank. That he did so with the full co-operation, even admiration, of his colleagues is clearly evident in the report of a testimonial organized in 1853 by his branch managers:<blockquote>to record their high and grateful sense of the valuable and effective management of Henry Luard, Esq., the company's general manager. To his urbanity and gentlemanly deportment, combined with those rare talents which so eminently qualify him for the responsible post he fills, may be attributed, they feel, in a very great degree, the well-regulated and gratifying harmony which has characterised the conduct of their business for the several past years. (<span class="italic">Bankers' Magazine</span>, 13, 1853, 752)</blockquote>Within three years such sentiments must have carried a distinctly hollow ring: on 25 March 1856 Henry Luard resigned as general manager of the London and County Bank, on the grounds of irregular conduct of the bank's affairs which had left him deeply indebted both to the bank and to several other parties connected with it. An internal investigation following the suicide of the bank's chairman, John Sadler MP, who had been forging shares, revealed a number of dubious transactions, including unsecured loans (likely to produce a loss of &pound;10,000 for the bank) in favour of parties to whom Luard was personally indebted. It appeared also that his personal finances bordered on insolvency.<br>
<br>Despite this fall from grace, which brought such a sudden end to Luard's banking career, recognition is due for the many sound advances in the treatment of bank employees that he helped to promote, of which the establishment of a provident fund for their long-term protection was of especial note. Within a few short years Luard was dead. His body was found in a field at Thornbury, Devon, on 20 May 1860. An inquest held on the 21st revealed that he died suddenly, of unknown causes.<br>
