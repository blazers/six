<span class="headword">Bolam,  Silvester</span>  (1905&#150;1953), <span class="occ">newspaper editor</span>, was born on 23 October 1905 at 84 George Street, Willington Quay, Tynemouth, Northumberland, the son of Thomas Bolam, a foreman blacksmith, and his wife, Amelia English. He was educated at Tynemouth Municipal High School and Armstrong College, Newcastle (then part of Durham University), graduating in economics in 1926. On 21 April 1934 Bolam married Annabel Cecilia (<i>b</i>. 1906), daughter of John Scorer, coal fitter; they were to have two children.<br>
<br>Initially destined for a business career, on graduating Bolam instead took a job on the <span class="italic">Newcastle Journal</span>. After making his mark amid the ferocious newspaper competition of the late 1920s, he moved to Manchester to work for the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>, then in 1936 joined the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> as a sub-editor. Leaving in 1938 to rejoin the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>, he was told by H. G. Bartholomew, editorial director of the <span class="italic">Mirror</span>, &#145;you'll be back&#146;  (Griffiths, 118). Within ten months he was, as joint night editor beginning a rise through the <span class="italic">Mirror's</span> executive ranks. His success was built on &#145;disciplined habits of work and an imperturbability rare among newspaper executives&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 28 April 1953). A gifted newspaper technician, he was noted for skill in making heavy subjects accessible and had a close working relationship with the cantankerous, wayward Bartholomew, whom he praised for &#145;the sense of purpose he created in the young men around him&#146;  (Griffiths, 118).<br>
<br>In July 1948 Bolam succeeded Cecil Thomas as editor. His four and a half years in charge were to see the <span class="italic">Mirror</span> displace the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> as Britain's best-selling daily paper. Soon after he became editor Bolam memorably expressed his credo:<blockquote>Sensationalism does not mean distorting the truth. It means the vivid and dramatic presentation of events so as to give them a forceful impact in the mind of the reader. It means big headlines, vigorous writing, simplification into everyday language and the wide use of illustration by cartoons and photographs. (Cudlipp, <span class="italic">Walking on the Water</span>, 174)</blockquote>Bolam is mainly remembered for his imprisonment in March 1949, for contempt of court. He admitted an error of judgement in printing a story in the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> which might prejudice the trial of John Haigh, who was subsequently executed for murder. However, Lord Goddard, the lord chief justice (clearly aware of Bolam's editorial stance), chose to interpret it as &#145;a matter of policy, pandering to sensationalism for the purpose of increasing the circulation of this paper&#146;  (<span class="italic">World's Press News</span>, 31 March 1949). Bolam was sent to Brixton gaol for three months, the first national newspaper editor gaoled for reasons relating to his paper since 1901.<br>
<br>Bolam was philosophical about his imprisonment: &#145;Most executive journalists never get the chance to think. If you have 18 hours a day by yourself for three months you have a valuable opportunity for reaching objectivity, for clearing your mind, for setting your sights&#146;  (Griffiths, 118). Nevertheless, his <span class="italic">Mirror</span> colleague W. N. Connor (better known as Cassandra) believed it &#145;may well have been solid claustrophobic hell for a man whose hobby happened to be mountaineering&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, 1 May 1953).<br>
<br>In July 1949 Bolam returned to the paper, edited in his absence by Alex Little, a former classmate at Tynemouth Municipal High School. He remained editor for a further three and a half years. However, the period was not entirely happy. In 1951, recognizing that the behaviour of his mentor, Bartholomew, had become impossibly erratic, he cast the decisive vote in a board-room coup against him. His relations with Bartholomew's successor Cecil King, who found him far too earnest, were poor, and in January 1953 he left the post, resigning ostensibly because of a disagreement with the management  (<span class="italic">World's Press News</span>, 30 Jan 1953), although the history of the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> describes him as &#145;a deferential editor sacked for disagreeing with his superiors&#146;  (Edelman, 156).<br>
<br>Bolam was a serious-minded man, a slight figure with a goatee beard and &#145;the mild manner of a professor of languages&#146;  (<span class="italic">Newcastle Journal</span>, 28 April 1953), whose dedicated Christianity earned him the nickname Bish. His <span class="italic">Mirror</span> colleague Hugh Cudlipp recalled him as a &#145;friendly, wiry bird with a dozen interests&#151;books, art, music, the countryside&#146;  (Cudlipp, <span class="italic">Publish and be Damned!</span>, 251&#150;2).<br>
<br>He died suddenly on 27 April 1953 at his home, Lincoln House, West Road, Guildford, his wife surviving him. He was cremated on 30 April at St John's crematorium, Woking, Surrey.<br>
