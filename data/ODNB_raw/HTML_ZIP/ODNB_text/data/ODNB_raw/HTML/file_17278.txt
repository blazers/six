<span class="headword">Lyon,  John</span>, eighth Lord Glamis  (<em>c.</em>1544&#150;1578), <span class="occ">nobleman and administrator</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17277/', "John Lyon, seventh Lord Glamis (b. c.1521, d. in or before 1559)")</script>, and Janet, daughter of Robert Keith, Lord Keith, and sister of the fourth Earl Marischal. He succeeded to the lordship on the death of his father in 1558, inheriting with it the extensive possessions acquired by successive generations of the Glamis family. These territories were largely concentrated in Angus (Forfarshire), where by the sixteenth century they had been erected into a burgh of barony, giving their lords widespread power and influence in that county. In 1561 Glamis married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1581), daughter of William Abernethy, fifth Lord Saltoun. They had four children, a son, Patrick, who became ninth Lord Glamis, and three daughters: Elizabeth, who married Patrick, sixth Lord Gray and, after divorcing him, William Ker, son of the redoubtable Sir Thomas Ker of Ferniehurst; Jean, who married successively Robert Douglas the younger of Lochleven, Archibald Douglas, eighth earl of Angus, and Alexander Lindsay, first Lord Spynie; and Sibilla, who appears to have remained unmarried.<br>
<br>Glamis was certainly a participant in the tortuous and violent events of the 1560s, if in a mainly unspectacular way. Thus in 1565 he supported Mary's marriage to Darnley, but shortly afterwards showed his approval of the earl of Moray's subversive actions against the queen by taking part in the so-called chaseabout raid against her in August of that year. In February 1567 he was in Edinburgh at the time of Darnley's murder, but there has never been any suggestion that he was involved in that affair. Thereafter, he was initially in favour of Bothwell marrying Mary and was present at their wedding. But like many other noblemen he became disillusioned with Bothwell, and after Mary's forcible abdication in 1567 he became a member of the king's party. Its leader, Moray, now appointed him a privy councillor, and for the next decade he was seldom missing from the council's meetings.<br>
<br>Following Moray's assassination in January 1570 Glamis was a pallbearer at his funeral in St Giles's, Edinburgh. He received further promotion when the new regent, the earl of Lennox, appointed him an extraordinary lord of session. However, it was to be during the regency of his distant kinsman, James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton (they were first cousins, once removed), that the career of Glamis really took off. He had had experience of Morton in 1571 when the pair of them had acted as commissioners in talks between the Scottish and English governments held at Berwick, and when Morton was installed as regent in November 1572 Glamis quickly emerged as a key figure in his government. Thus, in February 1573, following the regent's settlement with the Hamilton and Gordon families known as the pacification of Perth, Glamis became one of the three officials responsible for mediating in any disputes which arose north of the River Tay. Later that year he reached the pinnacle of his career when, on the death of the fifth earl of Argyll, he became chancellor, on 12 October 1573. He was notably active the following year, when in August 1574 he accompanied Morton to the north-east of Scotland in an expedition designed for &#145;the establishment of justice and punishment of disordouris and enormittis attemptit aganis our Soverane Lordis authoritie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 2.388).<br>
<br>Glamis was also closely involved in executing the regent's ecclesiastical policy. Here, the return from abroad of the fiery Andrew Melville posed a distinct challenge to Morton, who in March 1575 appointed the chancellor to head a committee responsible for drafting an acceptable church settlement. In an attempt at finding a solution to this question, in 1576 Glamis contacted Theodore Beza, Calvin's successor at Geneva. However the latter's reply, attacking bishops and emphasizing the separate authority of the kirk, was not one likely to have appealed either to the regent or to his commissioner.<br>
<br>March 1578 was a climactic month for Glamis. On the 10th Morton's resignation as regent was confirmed by a royal proclamation at Stirling, while exactly one week later, on 17 March 1578, the chancellor himself was killed in a street brawl in the same town. The role played by Glamis in the temporary overthrow of Morton is debatable. On the one hand Calderwood and Hume of Godscroft claim that the chancellor joined Morton's opponents as soon as the crisis occurred. Certainly there is some evidence that Sir Thomas Lyon of Baldukie, the brother of Glamis, was involved in the negotiations for the regent's dismissal. On the other hand, on the day before Glamis was killed Morton wrote to him confidentially, asking him to use his influence with the boy king on his behalf. And on hearing of the death of Glamis, the ex-regent commented that it was &#145;an unhappy chance quhilk no doubt is to my great greif&#146;  (Thomson, Macdonald, and Innes, 1.105). Certainly, there is nothing here to suggest that Morton felt aggrieved at, or betrayed by, Glamis in 1578. Glamis's death came as a result of a scuffle between his own followers and those of David Lindsay, eleventh earl of Crawford, as they passed each other in the narrow streets of Stirling. Glamis was shot through the head, possibly, as Hume of Godscroft suggests, because he was &#145;a tall man of stature and higher than the rest&#146;  (Hume, 2.255).<br>
<br>A somewhat elusive figure in modern eyes, Glamis was undoubtedly highly regarded by contemporaries and by seventeenth-century historians. Thus Andrew Melville composed a Latin epigram to his memory, while the English ambassador observed that he was &#145;very wise and discreet but of no party or favour&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1574&#150;81</i>, 253). In the following century David Calderwood described Glamis as &#145;a learned, godly and wise man&#146;  (Calderwood, 3.397), but the best obituary notice is perhaps that of Bishop John Spottiswoode, who commented that &#145;the death of the chancellor was much lamented falling out in the time when the king and country stood in most need of his service&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of the Church</span>, 2.283).<br>
