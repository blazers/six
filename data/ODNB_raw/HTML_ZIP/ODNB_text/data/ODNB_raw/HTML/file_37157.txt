<span class="headword">Barne, Sir  George</span>  (<em>c.</em>1500&#150;1558), <span class="occ">merchant and local politician</span>, was the son of George Barne, grocer, of London, though the family seems also to have had connections in Wells, Somerset. His sister may have been the mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62232/', "Nicholas Culverwell (d. 1569)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70079/', "Culverwell family (per. c.1545&#150;c.1640)")</script>], who later served as his apprentice. He was a member of the Haberdashers' Company, and prospered from various sectors of English commerce, both traditional and novel. He exported cloth and imported wine from Spain, and he was a leading figure in new enterprises. With William Garrard he was a &#145;principal doer&#146; in promoting the first voyage to Muscovy of 1553, a founder and active member of the Russia Company, and a promoter of voyages to west Africa in 1553 and 1554.<br>
<br>Barne also took a full part in City politics. He was alderman from 1542 and lord mayor in 1552&#150;3, when the crown passed precariously from Edward VI to Mary. He was knighted on 11 April 1553 and was one of the City fathers signing the letters patent of Edward which made Lady Jane Grey queen. Though consequently treated with some suspicion by the Marian regime, there is no evidence that he had strong protestant convictions: his loyalties were to the City and those who, like himself, were members of its &eacute;lite.<br>
<br>Barne married Alice Brooke (<i>d</i>. 1559) of Shropshire, with whom he had at least three sons and two daughters, all of them involved directly or by marriage in London commerce. His heir, George, married William Garrard's daughter, Anne, and was subsequently governor of the Russia Company, mayor in 1586&#150;7, and MP. Of his daughters, Anne married, first, Alexander Carleill, another Muscovy merchant, and, second, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28624/', "Sir Francis Walsingham")</script>; and Elizabeth married John Rivers, lord mayor in 1573&#150;4. Barne died on 18 February 1558. He and his wife were both buried at St Bartholomew by the Exchange, London. At the time of his death he had property in London, Southwark, and Hertfordshire.<br>
