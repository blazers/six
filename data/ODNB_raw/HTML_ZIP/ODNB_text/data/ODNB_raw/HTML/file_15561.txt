<span class="headword">King <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bernard]</span>,  Frances Elizabeth <span class="st"> [Fanny]</span></span>  (1757&#150;1821), <span class="occ">philanthropist and author</span>, was born on 25 July 1757 at Lincoln, the third daughter and eighth child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2242/', "Sir Francis Bernard, baronet (1712&#150;1779)")</script>, provincial lawyer and later governor of New Jersey and Massachusetts, and Amelia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Offley (<i>c</i>.1719&#150;1778), daughter of Stephen Offley of Norton Hall, Derbyshire. Her nine brothers and sisters included the philanthropist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2251/', "Sir Thomas Bernard")</script>, founder of the Society for Bettering the Condition and Improving the Comforts of the Poor.<br>
<br>In 1758 Francis Bernard was appointed governor of the colony of New Jersey in North America, and departed with his wife and four of their children. Frances, described by her great-niece Sophia Higgins, the family biographer, as &#145;unusually delicate&#146;  (Higgins, 1.221), was left under the care of Mrs Beresford, a near relative of her father's, who lived at the Manor House, Nether Winchendon, Buckinghamshire. Sophia Higgins described Frances's education, conducted by her elder sister Jane (<i>b</i>. 1748) and Mrs Beresford, as consisting of solid reading, French, music, and needlework, as well as household duties. According to her anonymous memoirist, who may have been her future son-in-law, John Collinson (<i>c</i>.1791&#150;1857): &#145;Here those good principles of religion and active and succouring charity were instilled, which influenced her future life and led her to co-operate with her family in assisting the poor&#146;  (<span class="italic">Female Scripture Characters</span>, v). King later acknowledged her debt to Jane, dedicating her <span class="italic">Female Scripture Characters</span> &#145;To a beloved sister, as a grateful memorial of the early instruction and pious example from whence her best blessings have sprung&#146;.<br>
<br>On Sir Francis's return from America in 1769 Frances Elizabeth joined her family, first in Lincoln and subsequently at Nether Winchendon (from May 1772) and Aylesbury (from September of the same year). In her study of the family, Sophia Higgins argues that Frances, known as Fanny to her friends, aged seventeen, was a &#145;remarkable&#146; and &#145;self-reliant&#146; girl, due to her almost total separation from her near relatives for her first eleven years  (Higgins, 2.274). Her first literary work, <span class="italic">The Rector's Memorandum Book, being Memoirs of a Family in the North</span>, was written in 1774, the year of her sister Jane's marriage to Charles White, although the text was not published until 1814 and 1819. Her exemplary Christian heroine was represented as educating all the children in the village and nursing the sick. Forced to make an unhappy marriage, she nevertheless demonstrated her spiritual superiority over her unkind husband by her Christian submissiveness, and died a pious and early death.<br>
<br>After her mother's death in May 1778 King often stayed with friends and relatives, for example, in Wendover and Yorkshire. She may also have continued a school superintended by her mother in Nether Winchendon. Family letters cited by Higgins suggest she became engaged to the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15588/', "Revd Richard King (1748&#150;1810)")</script>, a friend of her brother Scrope, at Nether Winchendon about 1780. According to Higgins this was against the wishes of her brothers, due to King's lack of income, offhand manner, and political views. Nevertheless, Frances affirmed that &#145;It must rest solely within myself to guide my own conduct&#146;  (Higgins, 3.36, citing a letter then at Nether Winchendon). On 17 August 1782 they were married in London. The couple resided at King's livings of Steeple Morden, Cambridgeshire, and at Worthin, Shropshire, which he was granted about 1782, finally settling at Steeple Morden in 1809. The marriage was described as very happy, as the dedication to <span class="italic">The Beneficial Effects of the Christian Temper on Domestic Happiness</span> (2nd edn, 1807) suggests.<br>
<br>In 1783 Frances Elizabeth King gave birth to twins, Henry and Amelia. Henry died, aged one. Julia Priscilla was born in 1786, and Elizabeth in 1792. King frequently cared for children besides her own offspring, for example fostering her orphaned nephew between 1791 and 1793, and later looking after her grandchildren. Several young girls came to live with King, including the daughters of Lady Ingilby (and at one time Ingilby's son) and a Miss Richardson about 1794. In April 1802 her elder daughter, Amelia, married John Collinson, and in 1808 Julia married her cousin, Thomas Baker.<br>
<br>The Kings' daughter Elizabeth died in 1801, after which Frances's health, already affected by rheumatism, deteriorated. Following the peace of Amiens, Richard and Frances King stayed in Paris for eight months in 1802, after which Mrs King published <span class="italic">A Tour in France</span> (1803), based on her journal. This describes philanthropic institutions, the dress and customs of the peasantry, and the author's being shocked by French Sunday rituals.<br>
<br>On their return the Kings stayed in Phillimore Place, Kensington, London. Mrs King supported her brother Thomas in establishing the work of the Society for Bettering the Condition and Improving the Comforts of the Poor (SBCP) in Clapham, particularly among women. The area was divided into districts, each with a female sub-treasurer, in which women established and supervised numerous schools. Higgins cites the manuscript SBCP minutes of the ladies' committee meetings which show Mrs King's involvement: for example, on 17 December 1802 at the second meeting, held at her house in Kensington, money was collected to relieve a poor woman. Further activity included a circular, the result of Thomas and Frances's consultations, which was printed in 1803 as the appendix to the fourth volume of the reports of the SBCP, and a copy of the address sent to female subscribers which, though unsigned, is attributed to King by Higgins.<br>
<br>Frances King was also active in her husband's parishes in the establishment of schools for children of the poor and in other philanthropic societies. Her conduct of the parish library which she founded at Steeple Morden&#151;reading aloud to parents and children, then discussing the books and lending them to children&#151;was described by her sister-in-law in the third volume of the <span class="italic">Reports of the Society for Bettering the Condition and Improving the Comforts of the Poor</span> (cited in Higgins, 3.291). Her comments on the work of other teachers appear in an article in the fortieth report of the SBCP (1817) in which King wrote approvingly of Mrs Gray's reading, writing, and needlework school in Bishopwearmouth, drawing particular attention to the way the girls were taught and the strict segregation of the sexes. Two surviving letters indicate that King knew Hannah More, and was still subscribing to More's Shipham sickness club in 1810.<br>
<br>On her husband's death in 1810 King went to live near her two married daughters, whose husbands&#151;John Collinson and Thomas Baker&#151;held livings at Gateshead and at Whitburn, co. Durham, respectively. Her memoirist claimed that<blockquote>for a period of more than ten years [she] was there also a mother to the poor, a &#145;Dorcas full of good works and almsdeeds which she did&#146;. She not only established a large Sunday school, a Sick Fund and Clothing Society, but was constant in her superintendance of these institutions, and in visiting the poor at their own houses. (<span class="italic">Female Scripture Characters</span>, vii)</blockquote>All this, it was claimed, was without losing the retiring aspect of the female character.In her published work Mrs King made clear her intention to remedy important omissions made by divines. In <span class="italic">The Beneficial Effects of the Christian Temper on Domestic Happiness</span>, King lamented how Bishop Beilby Porteous's treatise <span class="italic">The Beneficial Effects of Christianity on the Temporal Concerns of Mankind</span> had noted only its public benefits, and had not carried the precepts of Christianity into domestic life. As support for her argument she cited William Paley's <span class="italic">Evidences of Christianity</span>. In her <span class="italic">Female Scripture Characters</span>, first published in 1811, she points out that the Revd Thomas Robinson, author of <span class="italic">Scripture Characters</span> (1793), had omitted all but two female figures. King's &#145;characters&#146; included both &#145;good&#146; and &#145;bad&#146; women from the <span class="roman">Old</span> and <span class="roman">New Testament</span>: Eve, Jezebel, Susanna, Martha and Mary, and Dorcas. Her description of Dorcas, for example, was followed by a homily about the value of learning to nurse the sick, instruct the ignorant, and teach the young. King recommended that a day a week should be set aside (including for children and servants) for work for the poor, but did not regard visiting prisoners as part of female charity. Another recommendation was that women should take the lead in family prayers for the entire household. King's study &#145;Martha and Mary&#146; included her views on female education, with a description of Andrew Bell's monitorial system and a critique of a model of education based on &#145;accomplishments&#146; for middle-class girls which neglected the mind. Higgins claimed that this book was intended for middle- or upper-class girls; her memoirist, that it was widely used in schools.<br>
<br>King's writings illustrate the contrasting &#145;feminist&#146; elements in the writings of early nineteenth-century evangelical philanthropic women, including Hannah More. On the one hand, King insisted on the absolute differences between the functions and capabilities of the sexes. Thus, the proper place of women was within the home, subordinate to their husbands in everything not inconsistent with their duty to God. However, she unequivocally asserted that men were far more likely to be deficient in their domestic duties than women, and that men often treated women as if they existed only for their convenience. She argued that there was no reason to suppose that &#145;Religion is of any sex&#146;  (King, <span class="italic">Beneficial Effects</span>, 36), and urged men to appreciate their wives and to be mindful of their domestic duties. King's memoirist also points out the contrasting aspects of her personality: &#145;affectionate and indulgent, she could be strict upon occasion, and know how to enforce authority: possessing a disinterested and almost romantic generosity, she managed with cleverness and scrupulous accuracy all details of business&#146;  (<span class="italic">Female Scripture Characters</span>, vii). An engraving by Edward Scriven after a portrait by Edward Hastings, which shows King wearing a widow's veil, suggests she was a formidable character.<br>
<br>Frances King died at Gateshead on 23 December 1821. She left &pound;1018, which included legacies of &pound;50 each to her sisters Mrs White and Mrs Smith and the three other single women, and the residue of &pound;768 to her grandson, the naval officer and explorer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5965/', "Richard Collinson")</script>; her other grandchildren were General Thomas Bernard Collinson and Julia Stretton, author of <span class="italic">Margaret and her Bridesmaids</span> and other popular novels.<br>
<br>King represents the exemplar of the godly parson's wife, a vocation she advised her female readers to recommend to their daughters and which she saw as mirroring that of the ministry for men. Her life story illustrates how early nineteenth-century women could hold what are now regarded as conservative views on the position of women in society, yet exercise considerable power within their own communities through their interpretation of the proper sphere of female responsibility, while commanding respect from the wider audience who read her books. She received a glowing obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1822) and occupies a place among the pantheon of &#145;exemplary&#146; religious and philanthropic women of the 1770s&#150;1820s, which includes Sarah Trimmer, Hannah More, and Mary Bosanquet.<br>
