<span class="headword">Nash, Sir  Walter</span>  (1882&#150;1968), <span class="occ">prime minister of New Zealand</span>, was born at 93 Mill Street, Kidderminster, Worcestershire, on 12 February 1882, the son of Arthur Alfred Nash (<i>d</i>. 1913), a wool weaver and dyer, and later a clerk, and his wife, Amelia Randle (<i>d</i>. 1919), also a weaver. He had four elder brothers and one younger sister. Nash was educated at St John's church school in Kidderminster, beginning at the age of three. He soon revealed an exceptional memory and won a scholarship to King Charles I Grammar School, but the family could not afford the required uniform, so he left school when he was eleven. Thereafter he had a variety of jobs, from messenger boy to an analysis clerk in the Ariel bicycle works in Birmingham, where the family had moved about 1896. Then he opened two sweet and tobacco shops in Selly Oak, where on 16 June 1906 he married Lotty May (1880?&#150;1961), head assistant at the Selly Oak post office and the daughter of Thomas Eaton, a plumber. They had three sons.<br>
<br>Apart from helping his father, a Conservative Party agent, on election days, and showing a keen interest in land taxation, Nash revealed little concern for politics in England. He began, however, the very extensive reading which assisted his later political career.<br>
<br>His wife wanted to travel, and in 1909 Nash sold his business and sailed for New Zealand with about &pound;800. He settled in Wellington and entered a partnership in a firm of tailors. One of his partners misled him about the firm's debts and Nash lost what money remained after furnishing a house. Then he became a commercial traveller in cloths for suits, and proved a very successful salesman.<br>
<br>In Wellington, Nash became very active as a fund-raiser for the Church of England Men's Society, until the bishop discovered that he thought usury a sin and had refused to deposit the funds at interest. Through a radical parson he met the leaders of the political labour movement, Harry Holland and Peter Fraser. He was angry at the brutal actions of special police (mounted farmers) during the 1913 strike, and he joined the New Zealand Labour Party, formed in 1916. His socialism was not Marxist. He was, rather, a Christian socialist, whose thought was chiefly influenced by reading John Ruskin, William Morris, F. D. Maurice, and Lev Tolstoy. In 1916 he became a partner (and accountant) in a firm of tailors in New Plymouth, where he started the first Labour Party branch, and where in 1919 he stood with other Labour candidates unsuccessfully in the municipal elections. His introduction of profit sharing in his firm led to trouble with the chief partner (and suggested that he was not perhaps born to make profits).<br>
<br>Nash set off for England, where he acquired the New Zealand agencies for several publishers. He represented the New Zealand Labour Party at the Second Socialist International in Geneva in 1920. There he met Sidney Webb, F. W. Jowett, and other famous socialists. He spoke once only, criticizing Webb's report on socialization as disguised capitalism.<br>
<br>After returning to New Zealand, Nash opened a bookshop and publisher's agency in Wellington&#151;work more to his taste than selling cloths or suits. But in 1922 he was elected secretary of the Labour Party, and by the mid-1920s this took up all his time. Nash was a near perfect secretary. He (and Fraser) made the Labour Party into a national organization. Nash introduced efficient office methods, raised funds, and opened branches. He remembered every detail&#151;indeed his memory for facts, figures, and names of people was extraordinary. Most of the other Labour leaders had trade-union, and some of them revolutionary, socialist backgrounds. Nash brought an element of middle-class and Christian respectability.<br>
<br>As well as working for the party Nash helped start the Institute of International Affairs and the Institute of Pacific Affairs. He represented New Zealand at conferences of the latter in Hawaii and in Canada, where he met many leading figures and gained in confidence. His knowledge of world affairs was exceeded by only a handful of people in New Zealand.<br>
<br>After two unsuccessful attempts, in a by-election in 1929 Nash was elected to parliament as the member for Hutt in Wellington, though he also continued as party secretary until 1932. While neither was the leader (Holland and then M. J. Savage held the official position), Fraser and Nash played the biggest part in formulating the policies which, in time of depression, led to the election of the first Labour government in 1935. Nash wrote the election manifesto. He became minister of finance, customs, and later marketing in Savage's ministry (1935&#150;40) and minister of finance and deputy prime minister under Peter Fraser (1940&#150;49). He and Fraser (whose intelligence and political shrewdness Nash greatly admired) made an outstanding team. Nash's contribution to the extensive reforms of 1935&#150;8 was very great. He introduced a system of guaranteed prices for dairy produce. Although caucus rejected his own income-related contributory scheme of pensions, he played a major role in formulating and (as minister of social security) piloting through parliament in 1938 the great system of pensions, child allowances, and free medicine which was the most extensive system of social security in the world at that time.<br>
<br>In 1936&#150;7 Nash spent months in England unsuccessfully trying to negotiate a new trade agreement whereby Britain would buy virtually all New Zealand's exports at agreed prices and New Zealand would import an equivalent value of British goods. In 1939 he again visited London trying to raise funds to redeem a maturing loan. New Zealand was suffering from over-importing as a result of local inflation, and Nash reacted rather belatedly by introducing import licensing. To this British leaders objected. Nash was given a rough time and succeeded in raising funds only on most arduous terms. Ironically, within a few months New Zealand was at war on Britain's side and Britain was taking New Zealand exports under a bulk purchase agreement.<br>
<br>By 1940 it was clear that the British could not defend New Zealand against attack. In November 1941, just before Pearl Harbor, Nash was appointed minister to Washington&#151;New Zealand's first diplomatic representative in a foreign country. In the United States he was an outstanding success at his chief task, getting New Zealand known. He was a member of the Pacific war council and, for a time, of the war cabinet in London. He retained his cabinet rank in New Zealand and returned temporarily to present his 1943 budget.<br>
<br>Much of Nash's time was taken up with post-war planning. In 1944 he chaired a meeting of the International Labour Organization; he attended the international meetings at Bretton Woods, Geneva, and Havana at which the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were created. At these meetings he took an active part. Their aim was to improve post-war economic conditions and to decrease the risk of future depression and war. The Labour caucus refused to agree to New Zealand joining the IMF&#151;and opposition leaders such as Sidney Holland agreed with the Labour majority. The IMF was criticized, among other reasons, for involving restrictions on New Zealand's independence.<br>
<br>In 1949 the Fraser government lost office. Peter Fraser died in 1950 and Nash became leader of the opposition, to be confronted almost immediately with one of the greatest crises in his career. A wage dispute involving the partly communist-led Waterside Workers' Union in January 1951 encouraged the National Party government to declare a state of emergency and take a range of draconian actions against the unionists and their families. Nash spoke in support of the rights of the workers, but he was much criticized by an anti-union (and cold war) public for saying that his party was &#145;neither for nor against&#146; the strikers. Labour was defeated in a snap election in 1951 and again in 1954, when many voters cast protest votes for Social Credit, not Labour.<br>
<br>At last, in 1957, at the age of seventy-five, Nash became prime minister, elected on a policy which included increased family benefits and pensions, easier access to housing loans, and a tax rebate of up to &pound;100 when the pay-as-you-earn method of tax collection was introduced. On the day he took office he was informed that overseas funds had dropped disastrously because of over-importing. It seemed like 1939 all over again. This time the government probably overreacted with its severe &#145;black budget&#146; and import controls. In the circumstances of economic severity, and with a parliamentary majority of only one, the government's scope was restricted. It did abolish compulsory military training, introduce equal pay in the civil service, and carry out the reforms mentioned above. It also promoted industrial development. But the public recalled with disappointment the contrast between Labour's promises and the financial stringency which followed. The party was defeated in the 1960 election.<br>
<br>Nash was less impressive as prime minister than as minister of finance. Although he was quite extraordinarily energetic, he was almost equally dilatory in making decisions. He attended endless petty functions from which a prime minister could have been excused for more exacting duties. He seemed too absorbed in details rather than in broad policy decisions. He was, as always, in some respects, inconsiderate of his assistants. He himself needed only four or so hours' sleep (plus catnaps) and he expected others to be available as required at almost all times. Increasing fame was paralleled by vanity. He amassed the largest private collection of papers in New Zealand, which filled his garage and, after culling, weighed 10 tons. Every scrap referring to his career&#151;even air tickets&#151;was filed away.<br>
<br>While prime minister Nash travelled abroad constantly, talking to Khrushchov, de Gaulle, Macmillan, Eisenhower. The British high commissioner in New Zealand, Sir George Mallaby, wrote that he was the only New Zealand politician with &#145;some pretensions to being a world figure&#146; and that &#145;other world statesmen were ready to listen&#146;  (Mallaby, 78). Nash led New Zealand delegations to every conceivable conference. He continued as leader of the opposition until 1963 and was an MP until his death. His active sympathy for the underdog remained undiminished to the end, as did his hatred of militarism. In 1965 he spoke vehemently at the first two teach-ins against the Vietnam War.<br>
<br>Nash was sworn of the privy council in 1946 and was appointed CH in 1959 and GCMG in 1965. He received honorary doctorates from Cambridge, Victoria University of Wellington, Tufts College, and Temple University. He entered Hutt Hospital, Wellington, after a heart attack on 21 May 1968 and died there on 4 June. His remains were cremated at Karori crematorium, Wellington, on 7 June.<br>
