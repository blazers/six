<span class="headword">Piercy,  William Stuckey <span class="st"> [Bill]</span></span>, first Baron Piercy  (1886&#150;1966), <span class="occ">financier</span>, was born on 7 February 1886 at 4 Kinross Street, Bermondsey, London, the only son and eldest of the four children of Augustus Edward Piercy and his second wife, Mary Ann Margaret Heaford. In 1893 Augustus Piercy was killed in an accident while working as an engineer for Vickers Ltd, leaving the family short of money. Piercy attended a local school in Hoxton, London, but he left in 1898 at the age of twelve to begin work with the City office of Pharaoh Gane, the timber brokers. He attended evening school, and matriculated in 1909, and with two small scholarships began a part-time BSc economics course at the London School of Economics (LSE) in 1910. He won the Gladstone memorial prize in 1911 and 1913, and in 1912, when he won a university scholarship, he became a full-time student. In 1913 he graduated BSc (economics) with first-class honours. He specialized in economic history, being taught by Dr Lilian Knowles, and served as secretary and president of the students' union in 1913&#150;14. He obtained a Mitchell research studentship and was appointed as a lecturer in history and public administration at the LSE, but the outbreak of the First World War halted this promising academic career.<br>
<br>Between 1915 and 1917 Piercy worked in the Ministry of Munitions, helping to design the munitions levy which contributed significantly to financing wartime expenditure. In 1917 he went to Washington, DC, as secretary of a mission to negotiate food purchases with Herbert Hoover, US food administrator, and thereafter remained in the United States working with the allied co-ordinating committee and helping to establish the British Ministry of Food of which he became a director. In 1919 he returned to England and was appointed CBE in recognition of his wartime work.<br>
<br>In 1919 Piercy became marketing director for Harrisons and Crosfield, East India merchants. At the same time, he undertook some part-time lecturing for the LSE, specializing in Far Eastern trade and helping to develop the new commerce degree at the school. In 1925 he moved back to Pharaoh Gane as a director, where he worked to restore the softwood trade which had been disrupted by the Russian Revolution. This and other business took him to Scandinavia, the Russian borders, and Germany. Having toyed with the idea of studying the teaching of business administration in universities in the United States, before attempting to implement such practices in Britain, he decided instead to enter the City, becoming a member of the stock exchange and a partner of Capel-Cure and Terry in 1934. With Capel-Cure until 1942 and also with Fenns Crosthwaite from 1937 to 1942, he both made his fortune and played a crucial role in organizing the first unit trusts.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Piercy returned in his fifties to public service, initially during 1940 and early 1941 as a special assistant in the export credit guarantee department and then, from May 1941, as head of the British Petroleum mission to Washington. Chosen as an independent figure from outside the oil industry, he supervised the negotiation and organization of petrol purchase under the &#145;lend-lease&#146; arrangements and also assisted in the introduction of &#145;pooled&#146;, rather than brand, distribution of petrol during the war. He then began to serve as principal assistant to the deputy prime minister, Clement Attlee, working under Evan Durbin, then a lecturer at the LSE. In January 1945 Durbin and Piercy swapped positions, with Piercy becoming the full-time salaried assistant. During the war he switched from being a Liberal to becoming a member of the Labour Party. He was an important member of Nicholas Davenport's XYZ group, a gathering of financiers and economists sympathetic to the Labour Party, and whose members included his close friend from the LSE, Hugh Dalton, as well as Hugh Gaitskell, Durbin, Douglas Jay, and Thomas Balogh. As a member of this group he became involved in plans to establish a National Investment board and was largely responsible for writing the draft legislation for the nationalization of the Bank of England. He considered attempting to stand as a Labour candidate in the 1945 general election but decided instead in summer 1945 to accept an invitation from his friend Lord Catto to become the first chairman of the newly established Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation (ICFC). Catto and Piercy had become friends during their time together at the Ministry of Munitions, since when Catto had gone on to become governor of the Bank of England. Had Dalton not resigned as chancellor of the exchequer after the November 1947 budget leak, it seems highly probable that Piercy would have succeeded Catto in 1949 as governor. On 14 November 1945, following the election of the Attlee government, Piercy was created a baron.<br>
<br>The ICFC was incorporated on 20 July 1945 to fill the so-called &#145;Macmillan gap&#146; in the financing of small- and medium-sized businesses. Reluctantly established and financed by the banks at the prompting of Catto, the ICFC required all of Piercy's skill and mental dexterity to see it through some difficult early years. Under his stewardship the ICFC grew to become an established financial corporation, having assets of some &pound;70 million and having lent over &pound;120 million by the time he resigned as chairman in 1964. In 1952, during his time at the ICFC, he established the Estates Duties Investment Trust (EDITH), which acquired minority interests in private and small companies so as to enable the shareholders to make provision for estate duty. He remained as chairman of EDITH until his death in 1966. The ICFC eventually grew into 3i, a major lender of development capital to industry.<br>
<br>In 1915 Piercy married Mary Louisa Pelham (1885&#150;1953), who had been secretary of the LSE students' union when he had been its president. They had one son, Nicholas Pelham Piercy, who succeeded his father in the barony, and three daughters. Through her mother, Mary Pelham was related to Lord Balfour of Burleigh, who as chairman of Lloyds Bank (1946&#150;54) and the Committee of London Clearing Bankers (1950) was of some help to Piercy during the ICFC's difficult early years. Mary Piercy predeceased her husband, dying in 1953.<br>
<br>Piercy was a complex, intellectual, diffident enthusiast, with that mix of sharp wit and occasional deviousness which often characterizes self-made successful individuals. He maintained his academic and extra-financial interests throughout his life, being a director of the Bank of England between 1946 and 1956, and serving as a governor of the LSE until his death. He was also a member of the senate and court of the University of London, a fellow (1922&#150;66) and president (1954&#150;5) of the Royal Statistical Society, president of the National Institute of Industrial Psychology (1946&#150;63), trustee (1946&#150;65) and chairman (1960&#150;65) of the Wellcome Trust, and chairman of the committee of inquiry on the rehabilitation, training, and resettlement of disabled persons which reported in November 1956. Apart from his Masonic activities, his other interests included book collecting and walking.<br>
<br>In 1964 Piercy, aged seventy-eight, married the 32-year-old Veronica Warham, who had been appointed as secretary to the ICFC chairman in October 1954. She did much to ease his final years as a reluctantly ageing man with a strong tendency to overwork. Two years later, on 7 July 1966, Lord Piercy died of a heart attack at the Grand Hotel in Stockholm while attending a meeting of the Kuwait international advisory committee of which he was a member. Lady Piercy survived him.<br>
