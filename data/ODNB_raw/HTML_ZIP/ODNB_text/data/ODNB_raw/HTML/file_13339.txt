<span class="headword">Hincks,  William</span>  (1793?&#150;1871), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister and naturalist</span>, was born on 16 April, about 1793, in Cork, the second of five sons and two daughters born to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13338/', "Thomas Dix Hincks (1767&#150;1857)")</script>, Irish Presbyterian minister, and his wife, Anne (1767&#150;1835), daughter of William Boult of Chester. His brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13335/', "Edward Hincks")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13336/', "Francis Hincks")</script>. He was educated in his father's school and in 1809&#150;14 was a student at Manchester College, York.<br>
<br>In 1814 Hincks was ordained in his father's chapel in Prince's Street, Cork; the next year, after a ministry of more than two decades, the elder Hincks moved to Fermoy Academy, and in 1816 William Hincks was appointed to George's Chapel, Exeter, following Lant Carpenter (1780&#150;1840) as junior colleague to the Revd James Manning (1754&#150;1831); his yearly stipend averaged &pound;205. In 1817 he married Maria Ann Yandell (1788/9&#150;1849), who had been adopted by the wife of William Jillard Hort (1764&#150;1849), minister at Cork from 1817 to 1849; the eldest of the Hinckses' eight children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13337/', "Thomas Hincks (1818&#150;1899)")</script>, became a reputable zoologist and a Unitarian minister whose theological views diverged sharply from his father's.<br>
<br>In 1822 William Hincks moved to an even more prestigious congregation, Renshaw Street, Liverpool, where he was active in the intellectual life of the town. In 1827, with reluctance, he was persuaded to accept the tutorship in mathematics and philosophy at Manchester College, York, along with management of student residence, fees from which supplemented his salary; to these posts he brought abundant energy and a buoyant personality. One student noted occasions when Hincks was less than fully in command of mathematics, but to his mind it was a pursuit inferior to metaphysics, to which he brought full command of the natural religion and necessitarian philosophy then dominant among the Unitarians. Throughout his life an active botanist, a subject that meshed well with his religious convictions, he also lectured on botany at the York medical school.<br>
<br>A serious dispute in 1838 with the college committee&#151;itself preoccupied with the declining state of the college and the imminent retirement of the principal, Charles Wellbeloved (1769&#150;1858)&#151;about income and outlay on the student residence led to Hincks's resignation in 1839. He accepted the ministry at Stamford Street Chapel in London, taking students at University College, London, as boarders and doing private tutoring as well. In 1842 he added the editorship of a newly founded Unitarian newspaper, <span class="italic">The Inquirer</span>. The perils of the paper's early days were considerable, with uncertain readership and rapid turnover in ownership, but by 1843 Hincks had established it firmly, with a readership of about 900, and had become proprietor as well. Doing much of the work himself, he had scope to indulge his passion for politics&#151;which his pupil W. R. Wood thought more important to him than science or philosophy&#151;and he confidently defended the Unitarian tradition descended from Joseph Priestley (1733&#150;1804) and Thomas Belsham (1750&#150;1829) against the rising revisionism associated with James Martineau (1805&#150;1900). A general, not merely a denominational paper, <span class="italic">The Inquirer</span> may never have been livelier than it was in those early years.<br>
<br>In 1847 Hincks stepped down. Ownership of <span class="italic">The Inquirer</span> was transferred to the printer Richard Kinder (1814&#150;1884), and the editorship, after a brief period in committee, passed to John Lalor (<i>d</i>. 1856). At loose ends and suffering financially&#151;Stamford Street at best paid &pound;60 a year&#151;Hincks undertook an unsuccessful lecture tour of the United States and in 1849 returned to native soil as professor of natural history at the newly founded Queen's College, Cork. His wife died that year, and on 6 October 1852 he married Sarah Maria Hodges (<i>b</i>. 1806/7), the widowed daughter of George Lucas, a farmer.<br>
<br>In 1853 Hincks was made professor of natural history at University College, Toronto, despite powerful support for another candidate, Thomas Henry Huxley (1825&#150;1895). Hincks's experience and scientific conservatism must have influenced the decision, but one cannot overlook Huxley's wry observation that testimonials, however strong, could hardly prevail against the superior qualification of having a younger brother, Francis Hincks, as Canadian premier.<br>
<br>Hincks's books, papers, specimens, and apparatus were all lost in the sinking of the ship carrying them to Canada, but his teaching may have been more seriously hampered by outdated methods&#151;reliance on rote memory and adherence to the &#145;quinarian&#146; system of biological classification associated with William Swainson (1789&#150;1855) and William Sharp Macleay (1792&#150;1865), a fashionably persuasive innovation when Hincks was at Manchester College. Recollections of Toronto students depict a large, florid man with perfect manners who was accorded the indulgence owing to a &#145;character&#146;.<br>
<br>As he had done at Cork, Hincks built up the natural history collections of the University Museum, a forerunner of the Royal Ontario Museum. In 1869&#150;71 he served as president of the Canadian Institute, whose journal he edited, and to which he contributed twenty-five articles, among them efforts to revise the quinarian system and to reassert the divine plan of creation against the rising doctrine of evolution by natural selection. He was also acting minister of the Unitarian church in Toronto from 1853 to 1857 and officiated from time to time thereafter. He died in Toronto of kidney disease on 10 September 1871 and was buried in the necropolis there on 13 September.<br>
