<span class="headword">Pierson,  Abraham</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1611?, <em>d.</em> 1678), <span class="occ">minister in America</span>, was possibly the person of that name baptized on 22 September 1611 at Guiseley, Yorkshire, the son of Thomas Peerson. He matriculated, described as &#145;of Yorkshire&#146;, as a pensioner from Trinity College, Cambridge, in Michaelmas 1629 and graduated BA in 1632. On 23 September 1632, at the collegiate church of Southwell, he was ordained deacon in the diocese of York. At the visitation of that year, together with Henry Ayscough, rector of All Saints, Pavement, York, he was reported for failing to warn churchwardens of their duty to identify absentees from church. On 8 December 1632 he appeared at the chancery court (the court of the archbishop's vicar-general) at York for preaching unlicensed as curate in the same parish.<br>
<br>On 19 March 1640 Pierson failed to attend when summoned before the high commission at York; despite further orders he had still not appeared by 30 April, when the court appears to have accepted his disappearance. It is clear that he had set sail for America, probably in the early months of 1640. He joined the Congregational church at Boston on 5 September 1640. Earlier in the year a group of colonists from Lynn, Massachusetts, had settled on the east side of Long Island, but were displaced by the Dutch, and shortly afterwards founded a colony on the west side, at Southampton. Meanwhile, the settlers who remained at Lynn requested Pierson to join them as pastor, and the Boston church granted him permission. Hugh Peter recorded the gathering in November 1640 of a church at Lynn and &#145;the ordination of Abraham Pierson as their guide in the spread of Gospel knowledge&#146;  (<span class="italic">DAB</span>, 14.588). The Lynn settlers shortly proceeded to the new settlement at Southampton, where Pierson married Abigail, daughter of John Wheelwright, a merchant of Exeter, with whom he had a son, Abraham (1645&#150;1707), the first president of Yale College. Southampton was then part of the Connecticut colony, but Pierson sought a stricter religious environment and moved to the colony of New Haven, which had fallen under the influence of the puritan John Davenport. Settling in Branford, he shared ministerial responsibilities with John Sherman for three years before his ordination as the community's pastor in 1650.<br>
<br>Part of Pierson's pastoral brief involved evangelical activities among the Native Americans, for which he was paid a salary by the commissioners of the united colonies; he learned Quiripi, and with the help of Thomas Stanton translated into that language <span class="italic">Some Helps for the Indians, Shewing them how to Improve their Natural Reason and to Know God</span> (1658). His distaste for the loose religious principles of Connecticut did not abate. When in 1662 the Connecticut governor received a royal charter that included the New Haven territory, Pierson was prominent in the battle against absorption. He and his church signed a covenant for their settlement stating that only church members could act as burgesses or magistrates in its civil government, but by 1665 their efforts to fight off Connecticut had failed. In response Pierson led a number of Branford residents to the banks of the Passaic River, where they founded a new settlement, New-work, or Newark. He served as the town's minister from 1666 until his death there on 9 August 1678.<br>
