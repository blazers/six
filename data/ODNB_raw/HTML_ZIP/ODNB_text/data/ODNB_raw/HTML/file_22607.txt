<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Potter,  Christopher</span>  (1590/91&#150;1646), <span class="occ">college head and dean of Worcester</span>, nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22605/', "Barnaby Potter (bap. 1577, d. 1642)")</script>, was born at Kendal, Westmorland. After schooling at nearby Appleby he entered Queen's College, Oxford, in early 1606, obtained a &#145;poor boy's&#146; scholarship on 29 October 1609, and graduated BA on 30 April 1610. Ordained deacon in May 1613, he became a college chaplain on 5 July and proceeded MA on 8 July. He was elected a fellow on 22 March 1615 and ordained priest the following June.<br>
<br>Potter was much influenced by the thoroughly Calvinist provost of Queen's College, Henry Airay. In 1618 he published Airay's <span class="italic">Lectures upon the Whole Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians</span>, with a dedication to Archbishop George Abbot evincing a characteristic dislike of polemic. Foreshadowing his own later defence of clerical property, Potter published in 1621 the late provost's <span class="italic">Just and necessary apology touching his suit in law for the rectory of Charlton on Otmore in Oxfordshire</span>. Potter meanwhile became a zealous and popular lecturer at Abingdon in Berkshire. In December 1616 he was nominated by Matthew Sutcliffe to his college at Chelsea for controversies against Catholics and sectaries.<br>
<br>Potter obtained his BD degree and a university preaching licence on 9 March 1621. In 1623, with permission from Queen's, he travelled to France and the Low Countries, visiting Antwerp and probably Paris. He became familiar with the Dutch Remonstrant position and with controversies in the Catholic church. The experience possibly initiated his rejection of extreme predestinarianism and adoption of eirenic approaches to religious differences.<br>
<br>On 17 June 1626 Barnaby Potter resigned as provost of Queen's, having canvassed for Christopher to succeed him. As a chaplain to Lord Keeper Coventry and a potential channel of ecclesiastical patronage, the nephew was duly elected. Within a few months, aided by Coventry, the earl of Carlisle, and Sir George Goring, and exploiting his knowledge of French to write to the queen, he obtained from Charles I through Henrietta Maria the advowsons of three rectories and three vicarages in Hampshire for the college; he himself became rector of Stratfield Saye. Three of Coventry's sons were later entrusted to Queen's, and Potter became by his influence chaplain to Charles I. The provost regularly received intelligence from Coventry and other friends at court in the years ahead. Potter's <span class="italic">The History of the Quarrels of Pope Paul V. with the State of Venice</span> (1626), a translation of Paolo Sarpi, was dedicated gratefully to Coventry.<br>
<br>On 17 February 1627 Potter obtained his DD degree, but received from John Prideaux, regius professor of divinity, slights on doctrinal grounds which he later often recalled as unjust and unchristian. At an unknown date between his election as provost and July 1628 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1692), daughter of Charles Sunnybanke, canon of Windsor. The couple had three sons, <a href="#cosubject_22606">Charles [<i>see below</i>]</a>, Christopher, and Edward, and one daughter, Anne.<br>
<br>Queen's became a magnet for young men of promise, as Provost Potter improved academic discipline, promoted study of Hebrew, Arabic, and Greek, and insisted on regular preaching by turns in the chapel. He also proved a judicious administrator: his memorandum book shows concern to collect debts and maximize income from property.<br>
<br>In 1631 Potter succeeded his brother as rector of Binfield, Berkshire, but significantly exchanged it after a few weeks for a prebend of Chichester Cathedral with the approval of Bishop Richard Montagu, a bugbear of committed protestants. Anthony Wood's assertion that Potter was a creature of Bishop William Laud, and thus regarded as an Arminian  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.180), muddies a complex relationship and Potter's religious position. Thomas Crosfield believed Laud had prevented Potter obtaining a prebend at Ely in 1626, while Potter preferred Coventry as university chancellor in 1630. When Laud obtained that office there was friction when in 1631 Queen's elected a new principal of St Edmund Hall with what Laud saw as indecent haste to pre-empt his interference. However, while Potter made some objections to Laud's university statutes of 1634 and 1636, in 1635 he wrote him a shrewd letter praising his projected metropolitical visitation of Oxford and simultaneously seeking to shield Queen's behind the archbishop of York's peculiar visitatorial jurisdiction.<br>
<br>Despite ongoing frictions, 1631 probably saw the turning point in the relationship. Potter had felt himself under siege for abandoning the shibboleth of Calvinist orthodoxy since at least December 1628. He published his sermon at the episcopal consecration of his uncle in March 1629, widely regarded as Arminian, to reassure the fathers of Queen's men, but in July he felt obliged to write a vindication  (later printed in J. Plaifere, <span class="italic">Appello evangelium</span>, 1650) to an old friend and Queen's man Mr Vicars, who suspected he had turned Arminian for mercenary motives. Potter denied he was an Arminian; though he also stated, &#145;I love <i>Calvin</i> very well, and, I must tell you I cannot hate <i>Arminius</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Appello evangelium</span>, 413). In June 1630 he privately recommended to the college non-polemical debate of the eternal decree of reprobation and of free will. Reported outside, this provoked bitter attacks by Oxford Calvinists, especially at the Act that summer. On 25 August he produced a manuscript apologia rejecting the absolute decree of reprobation as &#145;repugnant to &hellip; Scripture, &hellip; contrary to the &hellip; mercy of &hellip; God, &hellip; contrary to the constant judgm[en]t of antiquity, of many reformed Churches, and of plaine reason&#146;  (MS Rawl. C. 167, 227<i>r</i>). In the same month he criticized the proceedings of the Synod of Dort  (Queen's College, MS 390, 51<i>v</i>). He shared the enthusiasm for Grotius of Lord Falkland's Great Tew circle, in which Coventry's sons were involved, and encouraged Thomas Crosfield and Francis Coventry during 1631 to translate that author's <span class="italic">True Religion Explained</span>, which was published anonymously the next year. In 1631 he himself published anonymously a new edition of the <span class="italic">Stratagemata Satanae</span> of Jacobus Acontius, a humanistic and heterodox Italian protestant who held that there were very few essential articles of faith, and that those were to be found only in scripture, and who advocated general tolerance. Much of Oxford would have known Potter was behind this.<br>
<br>Events came to a head in summer 1631 when Giles Thorne traduced Potter as a Pelagian in a Latin university sermon. When Thorne and others were tried before Charles I at Woodstock on 22 August, Potter insisted he had directed Queen's men to Augustine and other anti-Pelagian writers of antiquity. His case was accepted and the hearing seems to have produced greater trust between him and Laud, who approvingly entered into his account of his chancellorship the improvements to Queen's chapel between 1630 and 1636. In September 1632 Laud entrusted his godson, William Chillingworth, to Potter for resolution of doubts preparatory to reception back into the Church of England. In 1633 he was prepared to help Potter obtain a Windsor canonry, even against his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Peter Heylyn, although the expected vacancy did not occur. Potter published in that year <span class="italic">Want of Charity</span> in answer to <span class="italic">Charity Mistaken</span> by the Jesuit Edward Knott (Matthew Wilson). Undertaken &#145;in obedience to your Ma[jes]ties particular commandement&#146;, it was dedicated to the king, and expressed too ecumenical and inclusive an attitude to non-Jesuitical Catholics for many protestants. For a second edition in 1634 Potter sought and used Laud's criticisms, a point not lost on William Prynne at the archbishop's trial. A response to Knott's reply was left to Chillingworth in his <span class="italic">Religion of Protestants</span>, which Laud had Potter examine in 1637. While, however, Potter subscribed to a form of &#145;rational theology&#146; akin to that of Chillingworth, they by no means agreed on everything.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Potter pursued, and received abuse for, his individualist theological stance. In September 1632 he was named in satirical verses, &#145;The academicall army of epidemicall Arminians&#146;, scattered around the university, while in November he contrasted favourably in college the doctrinal latitude allowed by the Church of England with the narrowness of the Irish and French protestant churches. A 1636 Oxford squib claimed that at Queen's, &#145;Dr. Potter is converted and they preach much of the salvation of the Heathens&#146;  (U. Nott. L., MS C1. c, 84b). Gerard Langbaine, in dedicating his <span class="italic">A Review of the Councell of Trent</span> (1638) to the provost, indicated that this translation of Gallican Guillaume Ranchin was at Potter's suggestion. It needed a preface disclaiming Catholic doctrinal content.<br>
<br>Potter concurred with Laud on academic discipline, exhorting his college in August 1634 to obey the chancellor's new statutes and promoting conformity to dress codes. His suggestion of the usefulness of portable statutes for students possibly inspired the broadsheet printed <span class="italic">Synopsis</span> of 1635, and Potter certainly had Crosfield prepare for publication in early 1638 on Laud's behalf a volume entitled <span class="italic">Statuta selecta</span> for student use. Moreover, in 1634 he encouraged bowing at the name of Jesus, praised the beautifying of churches, and guided discussion on defence of church property which led to outspoken attacks on the sacrilegious behaviour of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I.<br>
<br>With Laud's backing Potter was presented by the king to the deanery of Worcester on 31 December 1635. In 1637 he was chosen a JP for Oxford. Having declined Laud's offer of the vice-chancellorship in 1638 on the grounds of ill health, Potter finally accepted in 1640 only to face a troubled tenure answerable to a critical parliament. However, he refined procedure in public examinations for the BA degree, finished improvements to the Convocation House, and vindicated university control over Oxford markets against a hostile city. On 30 April 1641 Potter presented the university's petition in support of episcopacy and cathedral establishments to the king at Whitehall and received a supportive response. Finally the beleaguered Laud timed his own resignation as chancellor for the end of Potter's mandate so as to save him from the tender mercies of his certain successor, the earl of Pembroke.<br>
<br>Potter proved a firm royalist. He was one of seven heads who subscribed to the 1642 protestation only with reservations. In July 1642 he personally lent &pound;400 to the king and ensured his college provided &pound;800 by making up a deficiency himself. It appears from a repayment made to his son in 1662 that he lent at least another &pound;1000 on security. Potter's arrest was ordered by parliament on 12 July 1642. That year he resigned the college rectory of Bletchingdon, Oxfordshire, which he had held since 1632, and became rector of his father-in-law's old parish of Great Haseley.<br>
<br>According to Hearne, Potter later preached at Uxbridge before the treaty commissioners. In April 1645 he was one of those commissioned by the governor of Oxford to take an oath of loyalty from academics. His Worcestershire property was sequestered by parliament for delinquency. He was nominated dean of Durham by the king in January 1646, but he died at Queen's College on 3 March of that year prior to installation, and was buried in the college chapel.<br>
<br>David Lloyd described Potter as &#145;a strict Puritan &hellip; when preacher at <i>Abingdon</i>, in his doctrine, and always one in his life&#146;  (Lloyd, 544). By his will of 21 February 1646 Potter declared that he died<blockquote>abhorring all secte, sideinge and tyranny in Religion and holding Communion with all holy Christians through the world that love the same Lord Jesus in sincerity, &hellip; Agreeing with all such in things that are necessary &hellip; (which I take to bee but fewe and cleerely revealed in the <span class="roman">New Testam[en]t</span>). (Oxford University Archives, arch. wills OP, 84)</blockquote>After small benefactions to his college, the poor, and relatives, the residue of goods and lands went to his wife, three sons, and daughter. His widow soon married his successor as provost, Gerard Langbaine.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_22606"></a><span class="headword">Charles Potter</span>  (1634&#150;1663), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, eldest son of Christopher Potter and his wife, Elizabeth Sunnybanke, was born at Queen's College and admitted there in summer 1646, shortly after his father's death. Chosen student of Christ Church in 1647, he graduated BA on 27 June 1649, and proceeded MA on 15 July 1650. His &#145;Theses quadragesimales&#146;, defending in exercises Pythagorean positions, much commended at the time but according to Wood really the work of his tutor, Thomas Severne of Christ Church, was published at Oxford in 1651 and dedicated to his stepfather, Gerard Langbaine.<br>
<br>Potter travelled abroad, joining the exiled court of Charles II and the household of James Crofts, later duke of Monmouth. Correspondence received by Joseph Williamson in France suggests that his stepfather and others were very worried about his living extravagantly there and mortgaging property to support his lifestyle during 1657 and 1658. He became a Roman Catholic, and at the Restoration was made usher to the queen mother, Henrietta Maria. In early 1662 he was repaid money lent by his father to Charles I and awarded another sum for faithful service, amounting to &pound;2000. He died at lodgings in Duke Street, the Strand, London, in December 1663, and was buried in St Paul's, Covent Garden, near his great-uncle, Barnaby Potter.<br>
