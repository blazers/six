<span class="headword">Clifton,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1553&#150;1616), <span class="occ">separatist minister in the Netherlands</span>, was born at Normanton, Derbyshire, the eldest son of Thomas Clifton of Normanton and his first wife. On 12 February 1585 Clifton was instituted to the vicarage of Marnham near Newark, Nottinghamshire. On 11 July 1586 he was instituted to the rectory of Babworth, near Retford, in the same county. That September he married Anne (<i>c</i>.1555&#150;1613), daughter of I. Stuffen of Warsop, Nottinghamshire. The couple had at least three sons born at Babworth: Zachary (12 May 1589), Timothy (29 September 1595), and Eleazer (1 November 1598). Three daughters, also born at Babworth, died in infancy.<br>
<br>In May 1591 Clifton was charged in the Nottingham archdeaconry court with various misdemeanours, including failure to read the injunctions, to announce saints' days, to wear the surplice, and to use the cross in baptism. No punishment seems to have been imposed. However, on 15 March 1605, having been warned several times, Clifton was presented in the court of chancery at York for nonconformity to the new canons. He was ordered to confer with William Palmer, chancellor of York Minster, and in the hope of his future conformity was respited until 12 April. Then, in a hearing before Archbishop Matthew Hutton, he was deprived of his living and suspended from the ministry. On 6 March 1607 he was cited in the chancery court for continuing to preach unofficially, as the &#145;pretended minister&#146; or curate at Bawtry, a village near Scrooby, in south Yorkshire. William Bradford, first governor of Plymouth, New England, recalled having enjoyed his &#145;illuminating ministry&#146; in this period  (Burgess, 90). Clifton did not answer the charge; he was excommunicated on 20 March, but five days later this was suspended in the hope of his appearance; on 24 April he failed to attend and the sentence was reimposed.<br>
<br>By this time Clifton had formally separated from the Church of England. Although undoubtedly leader of the Scrooby group, which supplied the nucleus of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93695', "Pilgrim Fathers")</script>, he was associated by this time with John Robinson and John Smyth, the future Baptist, of nearby Gainsborough. Clifton appears to have had differences with both men, even before all three took ship for the Low Countries. On arrival in Amsterdam in August 1608, he can only have been about fifty-five, but he appeared as &#145;a grave and fatherly old man &hellip; having a great white beard&#146;  (&#145;A dialogue or summe&#146;, <span class="italic">Publications of the Massachusetts Colonial Society</span>, 22, 139). In the factional disputes developing among the &eacute;migr&eacute;s, Clifton soon aligned himself with the separatist &#145;Ancient church&#146; of Francis Johnson and Henry Ainsworth. In spring 1609, John Robinson, weary of internecine conflict, decamped to Leiden with his followers. These included most of the original Scrooby members, but not Clifton, who remained with Johnson in Amsterdam. Meanwhile, Smyth had embraced believer's baptism, and in early 1610 Clifton issued <span class="italic">A Plea for Infants and Elder People</span> against him. In December, when Ainsworth abandoned the Ancient church, Clifton replaced him as its teacher. It seems that he was not ordained to this position, perhaps because Johnson felt that the Dutch synods would have interpreted the reimposition of hands upon him as a denial of the legitimacy of his English episcopal ordination. It was in his capacity as teacher of the church that Clifton issued <span class="italic">An Advertisement Concerning a Book</span> (1612) against his predecessor. According to the family <span class="roman">Bible</span>, his wife, Anne, died in Amsterdam on 3 September 1613, &#145;aged fifty-eight&#146;. Richard Clifton died on 20 May 1616, also at Amsterdam, &#145;aged sixty-three&#146;, and was buried in the South Church there. Their sons Timothy and Eleazer died in the city on 7 June 1663 and 18 January 1669 respectively.<br>
