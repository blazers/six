<span class="headword">Ball,  John</span>  (1654&#150;1745), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, was born in November 1654, the eldest of five children of William Ball (1624&#150;1670), presbyterian minister, who was ejected from Winsham, Somerset, in 1662, and his wife, Susanna. He studied with Henry Hickman (<i>d</i>. 1692) at his school at Dunthorp, near Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, and Ames Short (1617&#150;1697) at Lyme Regis, Dorset, before conducting his own academy for conformists and nonconformists in Dorset. Following Monmouth's rebellion in 1685 he fled to the Netherlands as tutor to two young men, Colonel Henley and Colonel Trenchard, and studied medicine at Utrecht. He settled in Honiton some time before his ordination on 20 January 1696, and in 1705 he reunited the Presbyterians with the Baptists at the Bridge Meeting. He regularly attended the Exeter assembly from 1696, serving five times as moderator. He was fluent in French and Dutch and had facility in Greek and Hebrew, while &#145;Latin flow'd from him as Water in a Pipe&#146;  (Walrond, 16). He regularly preached from the Hebrew psalter.<br>
<br>Ball was one of the leaders of the orthodox dissenters in the dispute with James Peirce (1674&#150;1726) in the Exeter controversy which occurred between 1716 and 1719, and he insisted all ministers make an orthodox declaration concerning the Trinity. He published <span class="italic">Arius Detected and Confuted</span> (1719), as part of the debate, to which Peirce replied in <span class="italic">Plain Christianity Defended</span> (1719). <span class="italic">An Answer to some Common Objections</span> (1727) evoked an eirenic response by Joseph Hallett (1691&#150;1744), <span class="italic">The Reconciler</span> (1727). His last works were <span class="italic">The Importance of Right Apprehensions of God with Respect to Religion and Virtue</span> (1736) and a sermon preached in 1730, <span class="italic">Some Remarks on a New Way of Preaching</span> (1737). In the latter he defended revealed truth and rejected Locke's advocacy of reason. This provoked a response from Henry Grove in 1737.<br>
<br>Ball, who was married, died at Honiton on 6 May 1745 in his ninety-first year, supported by his granddaughter, a daughter of John Lavington (1690?&#150;1759); he left his family well provided for. Walrond had stressed his disregard for money and his puritanism in dress and diet, which prompted a deist opponent to comment &#145;that Man is what a Minister should be&#146;  (Walrond, 19).<br>
