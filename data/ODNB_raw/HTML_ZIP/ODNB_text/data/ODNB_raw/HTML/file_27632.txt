<span class="headword">Townshend <span class="st"> [Townesend]</span>, Sir  Roger</span>  (<em>c.</em>1430&#150;1493), <span class="occ">justice and law reporter</span>, was the son of John Townshend (<i>d</i>. 1466), a prosperous yeoman farmer of Raynham in Norfolk, and his wife, Agnes. He was probably born in the early 1430s, since he entered Lincoln's Inn in 1454. Within six years he was treasurer of the inn, and he probably gave his first reading around 1462; his second was in 1468 and his third in 1475. During the 1460s he built his practice at the bar, and in the year-books for 1467 we find him confidently disputing with Chief Justice Markham in the king's bench. He was acting as legal adviser to the Paston family by 1465, when he assisted them in the Fastolf will dispute and in a king's bench case reported in the year-books; at the same period he was assisting the duke of Norfolk. His services extended to moneylending, and an unredeemed Paston mortgage brought him the manor of East Beckham in 1470. Townshend served as a justice of the peace for Norfolk from 1466 until his death, and he was twice elected to parliament: first for Bramber in 1466, through the duke of Norfolk's influence, and then for Calne in 1472. By the 1470s he was sufficiently eminent in the law to act for the duke of Buckingham and the queen mother, and on 24 June 1478 he was created serjeant-at-law. Three years later he was appointed a king's serjeant, and he was reappointed to the office by Richard III. He began sitting as an assize judge in the last year of Edward IV's reign, going on the northern circuit until 1488, when he changed to the less arduous home circuit. His appointment as a justice of the common pleas came on 20 September 1485, and he sat in that court until the term in which he died, receiving his knighthood at Whitsun 1486.<br>
<br>In 1467 or 1468, Townshend married Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1499), daughter of William Lunsford of Lunsford, Sussex. Their eldest son, Roger, grandsons Robert and Giles, and great-grandson Henry all made careers in the law and became benchers of Lincoln's Inn. By the time of his death, on 9 November 1493, he had spent around &pound;3800 on land purchases, and was a major sheep farmer, owning 12,000 sheep in 1490 (in a famous judgment of 1487 he held a shepherd liable for negligence in losing a flock of sheep). His worldly success had carried the family into the gentry class; the hall, parlour, and chapel at Raynham were soon filled with armorial glass, and the visitation books garnished with bogus pedigrees. The justice expressed a wish to be buried in St Katherine's Chapel, Raynham, or in the Whitefriars if he died in London. Stow recorded an inscription in the Whitefriars to a Sir Thomas Townshend, which is probably an error for Roger. Roger's widow desired a tomb to be made for herself and her husband's bones at Raynham; the tomb chest survives, but even in the seventeenth century it bore no inscription.<br>
<br>Townshend had some obscure connection with the organization of a library in Lincoln's Inn, and kept over forty books at his home, besides the law library which he must have had in London. His name is remembered by legal historians as that of the first known reporter of cases, discounting the considerably more obscure figure of John Bryt in 1410. The year-books <span class="roman">1&#150;2 Edward IV</span> were printed by Pynson with the explicit &#145;secundum Townsend&#146;, and there are other references to reports under his name from the years 1458, 1460, and 1486. It is clear, therefore, that Townshend started keeping reports soon after joining Lincoln's Inn, and was still doing so as a justice nearly thirty years later. In view of this continuity, it seems highly likely that many of the other year-books during this period were written by him. Only a few personal jottings on circuit survive, in an autograph notebook at Raynham, and it is not clear whether the year-books which formed part of his estate, including a &#145;boke in papyr of dyverse yeres&#146;, were of his own making.<br>
