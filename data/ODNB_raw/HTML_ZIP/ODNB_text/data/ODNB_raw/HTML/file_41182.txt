<span class="headword">Wilkinson,  Robert</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1470, <em>d.</em> in or after 1515), <span class="occ">composer</span>, is of unknown parentage and upbringing. At Michaelmas 1496 he was appointed to the staff of Eton College as clerk of the parish of Eton, whose church was the college ante-chapel. From this humble beginning his musical talents took him, with surprising rapidity, to appointment as a lay singing-man of the chapel choir in January 1499, and as master of the choristers one year later. His occupation of this office seems to have been entirely uneventful; his stipend was increased on two occasions. An episcopal visitation of the college in April 1515 found no fault with the choir under Wilkinson's direction (its unclean surplices excepted). The degree of conscientiousness informing the choir's work in his time is suggested by the necessity for a visitation four years after his departure to require more of the singing-men to be diligent about their duties.<br>
<br>Wilkinson's principal surviving monument for posterity is the wonderful collection of late fifteenth-century church polyphony known as the Eton choirbook [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94452', "Composers of the Eton choirbook")</script>]. Compiled <i>c</i>.1502&#150;5 for performance by his choir, it contained ninety-three Marian antiphons and <span class="roman">Magnificats</span>, most being of great length and technical virtuosity. Its original inclusion of seven of Wilkinson's own compositions indicates the degree of influence which he exercised in its compilation. It is a tribute to contemporary standards of training that this ambitious collection was assembled for a body of singers consisting of but four or five chaplains, Wilkinson and four or five singing-men, and eight or nine chorister-boys (possibly enhanced by a handful of competent supernumeraries from among the fellows and schoolboys).<br>
<br>While enterprising in their choice of texts, two of Wilkinson's compositions included within the original layer are now wholly lost, and three exist only as fragments. One survives complete, as does the second half of another; both appear to be early works, manifesting somewhat imperfect integration of their stylistic components. Three of the lost or fragmentary pieces were for six voices, exhibiting already Wilkinson's particular delight in sheer sonority. His masterpiece was the <span class="italic">Salve regina</span> for nine voices, added to the Eton choirbook after his death and now one of the greatest splendours of the collection. Its unique scoring for two trebles, alto, four tenors, and two basses lends massive sound to its full passages, and affords scope for much resource in its kaleidoscopic display of combinations of voices for reduced ensembles. Also added to the choirbook was Wilkinson's setting of the apostles' creed as a canon thirteen-in-one over a plainsong ostinato; however, though highly diverting to sing, this is not of great musical consequence. Wilkinson vacated his offices at Eton College early in August 1515. No further trace has been found, but the manner in which he received a generous gratuity during his final year there suggests that his departure was not by death but to other employment, now unknown.<br>
