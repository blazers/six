<span class="headword">Pullen,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1146), <span class="occ">theologian and cardinal</span>, derived his surname from Latin <i>pullus</i>, meaning either &#145;dingy&#146; or &#145;small animal&#146;. It is very unlikely that he is the Master Robert called Amiclas (&#145;Poor Man&#146;) who appears in the contemporary poem <span class="italic">Metamorphosis Goliae episcopi</span>, as well as in the <span class="italic">History</span> written by William of Tyre. Pullen may have come from Sherborne in Dorset and he may also have studied in a school for clerks in northern France, perhaps at Laon or Paris, in the early years of the twelfth century. He should not be confused with Robert, archdeacon of Exeter, who studied at Laon and became bishop of Exeter in 1138. But he probably taught for a time in Exeter before 1133, where he may have had Gilbert Foliot (<i>d</i>. 1187) among his pupils. He then moved to Oxford, and from 1133 to 1138 (in the words of the Osney annalist) &#145;he began to lecture at Oxford on the holy scriptures, which had been neglected in England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ann. mon.</span>, 4.19). Several of his sermons of this period have survived, and he must also in these years have begun work on his <span class="italic">Sentences</span>, which systematically treat of the main areas of theology. He was not, as has been suggested, a canon of Osney Abbey.<br>
<br>According to the chronicler John of Hexham, Pullen refused a bishopric offered him by Henry I; he would seem an unlikely choice, and anyway in his lectures he expressed his belief in free elections. He soon moved to Paris where he taught, supported by the revenues of the archdeaconry of Rochester which he obtained possibly before 1137. John of Salisbury (<i>d</i>. 1180) describes him as a man &#145;of joyful memory&#146;, and as &#145;commendable alike in his life and his learning&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ioannis Saresberiensis Metalogicon</span>, 21, 72), who taught him theology at the cathedral school of Paris as the successor of Gilbert de la Porr&eacute;e, who had left to be bishop of Poitiers in 1142. Bernard of Clairvaux wrote, probably in 1142, to apologize to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95165/', "Ascelin")</script>, bishop of Rochester, for detaining Pullen at Paris &#145;on account of the wholesome doctrine that is in him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sancti Bernardi opera</span>, 64). The revenues that supported Pullen were hotly disputed by the monks of Rochester. Ascelin tried to force Pullen to return and appealed to Rome. He obtained a judgment from Celestine II allowing him to appoint a new archdeacon unless Pullen were to successfully appeal by 14 May (Pentecost) 1144. Pullen did appeal and Bernard reproached Ascelin for &#145;stretching out his hand upon the goods of the appellant after his appeal was made&#146;  (ibid.). Bernard also mentioned that Master Robert had many friends in the curia.<br>
<br>This action must have brought Pullen to Rome. His creation as cardinal-priest of St Martin, certainly by 4 January 1145, represents an unusual promotion, for no Englishman had hitherto become a cardinal, and Pullen was a teacher apparently lacking administrative experience. Gilbert Foliot wrote to congratulate his &#145;dearest master&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Charters</span>, 84) but did not quite conceal his surprise before going on to beg for favours. John of Salisbury, too, gives a hint of surprise in writing that the pope &#145;made a chancellor out of a scholastic doctor&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ioannis Saresberiensis Metalogicon</span>, 22): Pope Lucius II, who succeeded Celestine II in March 1144, appointed Pullen chancellor of the Roman church, in which post he appears between 31 January 1145 and 22 September 1146. Lucius allowed Pullen to nominate his successor at Rochester; the bishop recorded his disappointments in a letter. Pullen appointed his nephew. This was Paris (Parisius), who is found as archdeacon between 1145 and 1190; he also held a prebend in London.<br>
<br>On the accession to the papacy in 1145 of Bernard's friend, Eugenius III, Bernard wrote to Pullen warmly commending the new pontiff to him, and inviting him to become &#145;our Eugenius's consoler and counsellor&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sancti Bernardi opera</span>, 309&#150;10). Pullen disappears from papal documents after 22 September 1146, probably through death or ill health. He had probably been responsible for an increase in the number of Englishmen working in the curia, including his pupil John of Salisbury, Nicholas Breakspear (who later became Pope Adrian IV in 1154), and (perhaps) Boso, who became Adrian's biographer. He illustrates the growing interaction between scholastic and administrative activity during the second quarter of the twelfth century. He used his position in Rome to promote the interests of his relatives, including his cousin Joseph, prior of Sherborne Abbey, who brought a complaint against the bishop of Salisbury to Rome by June 1145, and obtained thereby confirmation of a substantial list of privileges and rights for his abbey.<br>
<br>Pullen's <span class="italic">Sentences</span> are a synthesis of theology in eight books, beginning with God's existence and the work of creation, and closing with the last judgment and the final state. They are characteristic of the early scholastic period, being comprehensive in scope but not as long as later collections were to become. They were presumably finished before 1144, as they arise from classroom teaching, which included carefully structured discussions of questions and of varying opinions about the teachings of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. They are not as systematic as Peter Lombard's, which were completed by 1158, but they left a mark on the latter work. Pullen was remembered, and his opinions recorded, to the end of the twelfth century.<br>
<br>Nineteen sermons ascribed to Pullen are found in Lambeth Palace Library, MS 458, and Hereford Cathedral Library, MS O.viii.2. They were evidently addresses delivered to clerical scholars (<i>fratres carissimi</i>) as an integral part of Pullen's teaching of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. The line of division between theology lectures and sermons was thin, but the link between both and the exposition of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> was strong: a selection of biblical books and of passages within them underlies Pullen's teaching of both the <span class="roman">Old</span> and <span class="roman">New</span> testaments. His style in both his <span class="italic">Sentences</span> and his sermons is discursive and homiletic, and also moralizing and admonitory. He also left an ascetical treatise on conversion and amendment of life entitled <span class="italic">Sermo de contemptu mundi</span> or <span class="italic">De omnibus humane vite necessariis</span>. A further twenty-six sermons ascribed to one Master Robert Pulo in Paris, Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, MS Lat. 2945, are not in fact Pullen's.<br>
