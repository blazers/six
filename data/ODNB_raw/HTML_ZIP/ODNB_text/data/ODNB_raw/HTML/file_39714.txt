<span class="headword">Plowman,  Mark <span class="st"> [Max]</span></span>  (1883&#150;1941), <span class="occ">pacifist and writer</span>, was born on 1 September 1883 at Northumberland Park, Tottenham, the fourth son of Mark Plowman (<i>d</i>. 1929), brickworks owner, and his wife, Anna Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hunt. He was educated at &#145;various inferior private schools&#146;  (<span class="italic">WWW</span>, iv), including Paradise House School, leaving at sixteen to go into his father's business. At the age of twenty Plowman renounced the restrictive creed of his parents, who were members of the Plymouth Brethren sect. Yet he continued to work for his father for more than a decade, before breaking free into the life of literary journalism. This was soon interrupted by his military service in the First World War and conversion to a lifelong pacifism.<br>
<br>Superficially, Plowman's journey towards pacifism was an erratic one, from medical orderly, via combatant infantry officer, to a court martial following the resignation of his commission and dismissal from the army. However, his published correspondence reveals an interior logic to his moves. Plowman married Dorothy Lloyd Sulman (<i>b</i>. 1886/7), writer, on 1 May 1914 and avoided the first rush of enthusiastic volunteers, waiting until December 1914 to enlist. To his brother he wrote on 18 December that he was &#145;wondering about trying the R.A.M.C. Repairing's bloody enough work&#146; but at that juncture he preferred it to combat  (Plowman, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 28). It was with a kind of resigned and relieved fatalism that he accepted his own participation in the &#145;bloody mess of war&#146;, as he wrote to a friend five days later: &#145;When everything is a horrible muddle this really seems an easy way as well as a right way out of it&#146;  (ibid., 31). After some months as a wagon orderly with the 4th field ambulance at its Essex headquarters, Plowman decided to transfer to a fighting regiment, applying for a commission to do so. To his close friend Hugh de Selincourt he wrote:<blockquote>Who am I that I should say to another man&#151;You do my killing? &hellip; One either believes in active resistance or non resistance. If I lived in an ideal world I should believe in non resistance &amp; to make that dream reality I shall always throw in my tiny weight. That's my direction. (ibid., 36)</blockquote>By the summer of 1916 he was in France with the 10th Yorkshire regiment, soon experiencing the horrors of the front. He continued to examine the contradictions of his position in correspondence with de Selincourt, prefiguring the Peace Pledge Union in October 1916:<blockquote>I want to exploit the fear of war &hellip; I want to start an International League of individuals sworn never to take up arms &hellip; And so I'm here in mud &amp; blood &amp; all the damned insanity of war &amp; I wouldn't be out of it, <i>things being as they are</i>. (ibid., 56, 57)</blockquote>In January 1917 Plowman was concussed by a shell-burst and invalided home:<blockquote>If only I could get decently wounded now I should be most awfully glad I'd been out here &hellip; nothing has surprised me except the way in which some of the men &#145;stick it&#146;. And that will always be a romance in my mind. (ibid., 59)</blockquote>He was in hospital or convalescent homes or on leave for the first seven months of 1917; by May he had &#145;come to think the Army has had all the useful service it will ever get out of me &hellip; I'm too tired of it&#151;too entirely soul sick of it&#146;  (ibid., 69). During this period, before he was transferred to the reserves, he wrote his pamphlet <span class="italic">The Right to Live</span>, then on 14 January 1918 he submitted the resignation of his commission on grounds of conscience: &#145;I have always held that &hellip; war is a &#147;relic of barbarism&#148;, but my opinion has gradually deepened into the fixed conviction that organised warfare of any kind is always organised murder&#146;  (ibid., 92).<br>
<br>Plowman was as a result dismissed from the army; the subsequent delays and uncertainties of the conscription procedure spared him the likely sentence of imprisonment as a conscientious objector and he returned to family life and his work as a writer. Despite his conversion, he was at this time dismissive of pacifists: &#145;The best men went to the Front and died&#146;  (Plowman, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 261), and it was not until 1927 that his recollections of active service, <span class="italic">A Subaltern on the Somme</span>, appeared. In the same year he also published <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Study of Blake</span>, the fruit of his reading, of collaboration with Geoffrey Keynes and correspondence with the Blake scholars S. Foster Damon and Joseph Wicksteed. During the latter part of the decade Plowman suffered physically from a duodenal ulcer and emotionally from the death of his elder son Christopher Mark (Tim) at the age of eleven, of pneumonia during apparent recovery from meningitis. Ten years after Tim's death, Plowman wrote that &#145;since then, I have only lived as it were at one remove&#146;, comparing &#145;what little I know of the Divine Vision&#146; with its appearance through the broken heart of Enitharmon  (ibid., 622).<br>
<br>Plowman first met the writer and critic John Middleton Murry early in 1929 and the remaining years of his life were marked by a growing friendship and debate with Murry and an active, though still highly critical, involvement in pacifist affairs as the world situation deteriorated. Plowman's literary and editorial activities in his last dozen years included work on Dent's <span class="roman">Everyman</span> and editorship of <span class="italic">The Adelphi</span>. Of particular value to posterity was his encouragement of and assistance to Mrs Wood (formerly Jessie Chambers, &#145;Miriam&#146; of <span class="italic">Sons and Lovers</span>) in the completion and publication of her memoir of Lawrence: <span class="italic">D. H. Lawrence: a Personal Record</span> by &#145;E. T.&#146; (1935).<br>
<br>Although he lacked the benefit of a university education, Plowman's passionate commitment to literature, which achieved scholarly status in his work on Blake and with which his pacifist philosophy was closely connected, provided both his raison d'&ecirc;tre and the livelihood for himself and his family. Although organization was not his forte, Plowman took on the general secretaryship of the Peace Pledge Union in March 1937 and &#145;<i>sacrificed</i> a year to the P.P.U.&#146;  (Plowman, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 629), six months of it in the demoralized aftermath of the death of its founder, the Revd Dick Sheppard. This period was made more difficult by Plowman's conviction that pacifism and practical action could not be separated, a view not shared by the majority of those of influence in the Peace Pledge Union, which led to Plowman's promotion of the Langham voluntary service scheme in 1939. It has been argued that for Plowman, as for Clifford Allen and Fenner Brockway, his socialism &#145;was a complete surrogate for &hellip; former Christian beliefs&#146;  (Ceadel, <span class="italic">Semi-Detached Idealists</span>, 49). Although there was an element of political protest against industrial society in Plowman's reaction to the carnage of the western front, his situation was in fact more complicated. In April 1938 he wrote a long letter to Middleton Murry explaining in some detail his views on Christianity and their relation to his pacifism. In his late teens Plowman had gone &#145;through the hoop of the metaphysical Christ&#146;; a few days before writing this letter to Murry, he had had a &#145;moment of illumination&#146;, which revealed that the orthodox Christian view of God was &#145;as <i>God at one remove</i>&#146;  (Plowman, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 629). Whereas to Plowman &#145;Christ &amp; God in every man are One&#151;the Divine Humanity&#151;the essential person. And it's <i>that</i> recognition&#151;&amp; that alone, it seems to me&#151;which has power to save the world&#146;  (ibid., 630). This view had been prefigured in a cryptic fashion in his 1918 commission resignation statement that &#145;killing men is always killing God&#146; and it was reinforced by his post-war immersion in the works of Blake.<br>
<br>In September 1939 Plowman went to The Oaks, Langham, Colchester, the Adelphi Centre set up by Middleton Murry, expecting to wind it down by the end of the year. Instead he plunged into the practical pacifism he advocated, sheltering some twenty elderly evacuees from the East End and working a co-operative farm of 70 acres with a group of young conscientious objectors. Despite the arduous work coupled with the pressures of producing <span class="italic">The Adelphi</span>, Plowman was able to provide his fellow pacifist Vera Brittain with inspirational support when she stayed several times at The Oaks in the spring of 1941, a time when she felt &#145;stranded and lonely&#146;  (Berry and Bostridge, 411&#150;12). In turn, she paid him generous tribute in her &#145;Letter to peace-lovers&#146;, following his death at The Oaks on 3 June 1941, a sick man worn out by the complications and responsibilities of running The Oaks  (Plowman, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 11).<br>
<br>In 1944 a substantial selection of Plowman's letters, edited by his widow, was published and it is through them, rather than his poetry, which has not stood the test of time, that his generous and enthusiastic, but often tormented, spirit survives.<br>
