<span class="headword">McDavid, Sir  Herbert Gladstone</span>  (1898&#150;1966), <span class="occ">shipowner</span>, was born on 19 May 1898 at 4 Upper Stanhope Street, Liverpool, the eldest child of Denis McDavid, a tailor's cutter, and his wife, Octavia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Christian. His grandfather was Jacob Christian, a ship's steward born of African descent in Antigua, West Indies. Octavia's brothers George William Christian and Arthur Christian worked for the Liverpool merchant and shipowner John Holt.<br>
<br>McDavid was educated at the Liverpool Institute and joined Alfred Holt &amp; Co., owners and managers of the Ocean Steamship Co. Ltd (the Blue Funnel Line), in 1915. At the beginning of 1917 he enlisted in the Liverpool Scottish, was captured, and made a prisoner of war. Quickly mastering German, he acted as an interpreter, failed in an escape attempt, and by late 1918 was virtually running the prisoner-of-war camp. For his outstanding services he was awarded the meritorious service medal.<br>
<br>After returning to Blue Funnel after the war McDavid developed his leadership qualities and learned much during the difficult years between 1928 and 1935. Technical efficiency was not enough: there had to be full understanding between the carrier and its customers, a principle adopted throughout Holts. McDavid made a particular mark as leader of a team of outward cargo canvassers reporting to Leonard Cripps. Throughout his career he travelled widely to ensure he was aware of the needs of his customers.<br>
<br>Holts acquired the Glen Line in 1935 and McDavid was transferred to their London office in 1936 to strengthen the management team. Like Blue Funnel, Glen ran cargo liner services to the Far East, but from London and east coast ports rather than Liverpool and the west coast. McDavid was appointed a director in May 1938, serving under C. E. Wurtzburg, who had been appointed managing director in 1937. A priority of the new owners was renewal of the fleet, achieved partly by transfer from Blue Funnel, and Glen's ten ships were earning increased profits by 1938, thanks to the new management and general improvement in trade. Eight ships were ordered in 1936&#150;7 for the twice-monthly fast service to Malaya, Hong Kong, China, and Japan. The Glenearn class were among the largest and fastest cargo liners of their day, with a capacity of about 19,000 cubic metres and a speed of 18 knots. Four were ordered from overseas yards. Delivery began in 1938, but war intervened before all could be delivered. <i>Glengarry</i> was nearing completion in a Copenhagen yard when the Germans invaded; characteristically McDavid enlisted the help of the Admiralty in an unsuccessful attempt to seize the ship.<br>
<br>Many of the Glen ships were requisitioned at the outbreak of the Second World War, and the remaining Far East service ceased at the end of 1941. McDavid was seconded to the Ministry of War Transport in 1941 as deputy director of sea transport and led a small team dealing with the shipping of cargoes for the fighting services. He devised new methods of loading and unloading ships and landing craft so that material was ready for use as soon as possible, and took a leading role in the planning of the landings in north Africa, Sicily, Italy, and Normandy. He was appointed CBE in 1944 for services rendered during the Normandy invasion. His capacity for hard work and his dependability endeared him to military and civil service colleagues alike. After the end of the war he was appointed director of sea transport to oversee the return to peacetime conditions, a task almost completed when he returned to Glen in 1946. In 1947 he was made an officer of the order of Orange Nassau (Netherlands) and received the American medal of freedom with silver palm.<br>
<br>Six of the Glen Line's eight new ships survived hostilities, including to everybody's surprise the <i>Glengarry</i>, and by September 1948 Glen had fifteen ships and was providing the twice-monthly fast service and a slower secondary service. On Wurtzburg's death in 1952 McDavid was appointed managing director, and he became chairman in June 1954. He was also chairman and managing director of McGregor, Gow and Holland Ltd, and chairman of McGregor, Gow and Robinson Ltd. In 1956 Holts began planning a new fleet to serve both Glen and Blue Funnel, but McDavid pressed for Glen to have priority, often to the annoyance of the Liverpool-based Ocean Steamship Co. managers, and insisted on larger and faster ships to meet the greater competition at east coast ports. His views prevailed, and four Glenlyon class ships were ordered in 1960 and delivered in 1962&#150;3. With a service speed of 20 knots and sufficient in reserve, they maintained Glen's position. Four Glenalmond class ships, similar to the Blue Funnel Priams, were ordered shortly before McDavid retired at the end of 1963. Under McDavid's leadership Glen made healthy profits, but within a decade of his retirement the company's trade had disappeared and the Glen Line quietly faded away.<br>
<br>McDavid continued as a part-time non-executive director of Glen Line until late 1965, and was also appointed to the board of the Ocean Steamship Co. Ltd and made a partner in Alfred Holt &amp; Co. He represented Ocean on the Far Eastern Conference and was its chairman from 1963 to 1965. His status in London shipping circles was reflected in his membership of such organizations as the Baltic Exchange, the General Council of British Shipping, the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights, and the Port of London Authority, on which he served from 1958 to 1964. He continued to advise the government on shipping matters and was recalled to organize shipping during the Suez crisis in 1956, for which he was knighted.<br>
<br>From the early 1950s McDavid was dogged by illness, often needing assistance, and he was unable, during his short retirement, to pursue his hobby of fly-fishing. Mac, as he was universally known, never married, but he enjoyed the company of a wide circle of friends, who remembered his high spirits and his affection for his colleagues. Patience and enthusiasm made him a natural teacher. He died at his London flat, 35 Dorset House, Gloucester Place, on 14 October 1966, of bronchopneumonia and heart failure. He was cremated on 20 October at Golders Green crematorium, and a memorial service was held on 24 November at All Hallows Barking by the Tower, London. His brothers Arthur and Gordon had also worked for Holts, Arthur (<i>d</i>. 2002) rising to be a captain and Gordon (<i>d</i>. 1942) an engineering officer.<br>
