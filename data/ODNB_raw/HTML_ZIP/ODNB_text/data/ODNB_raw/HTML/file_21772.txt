<span class="headword">Peers,  Richard <span class="st"> [Dic]</span></span>  (1645&#150;1690), <span class="occ">translator and author</span>, was born in Lisburn, co. Antrim, the son of Richard Peers, a tanner. Young Richard became his father's apprentice, but &#145;being weary of that employment, gave his father the slip &hellip; obtaining a prosperous gale&#146; to Bristol  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.290), whence his uncle sent him to a school in Carmarthenshire. He then (possibly helped by the local schoolmaster, Jeremy Taylor) obtained a scholarship at Westminster School, which was, under Richard Busby, a centre of classical learning and versification. Peers proceeded to Christ Church, Oxford (matriculated 22 July 1664), and was elected a student in 1665, at the age of twenty (&#145;over ripe for the university&#146; according to Wood); he graduated BA in 1668 and MA in 1671. His limited income was supplemented by working for fellow undergraduates, &#145;for 'twas usual with him to make the exercises of idle scholars, either for money or something worth it from the buttery book&#146;  (ibid.); the practice was not uncommon, the exercises in question probably being Latin verse &#145;themes&#146;. If his college superiors knew of this activity, they are unlikely to have had strong objections. Peers published Latin verses under his own name, including a page of elegiacs for the <span class="italic">Epicedia</span> (1670) lamenting the death of George Monck, duke of Albemarle.<br>
<br>Peers also wrote English poems as a student, published as <span class="italic">Four Small Copies of Verses on Sundry Occasions</span> (1667) and reissued, probably in the same year, as <span class="italic">Poems by R. P. Student of Ch[rist] Ch[urch] Oxon.</span> They probably failed to fulfil Peers's hopes for fame; his colleague Humphrey Prideaux later described them as &#145;musty ballads&#146; producing &#145;little credit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Humphrey Prideaux</span>, 24). Peers addresses his academic patrons, Busby and John Fell, and offers an epitaph on a gentleman loyal to the king, who:<blockquote>
<div>Ne're followed a blind faith's fantastick guess,<br>
</div>
<div>Ne're courted Faction in a <i>Modish dress</i>.<br>
</div> (Peers, 8)</blockquote>The most interesting poem in the collection is the fourth  (pp. 11&#150;20), &#145;To the Memory of Abraham Cowley&#146;, thirty-one stanzas in the form later used for Gray's <span class="italic">Elegy</span>, of which it is a not unworthy predecessor. Cowley's &#145;<i>Pindarick</i> Muse so bravely soar'd&#146;; even former opponents:<blockquote>
<div>Confess him now of Modern <i>Wits</i> the best,<br>
</div>
<div>And next Immortal <i>Spencer</i> to be nam'd.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Cowley's situation is described with an impressive neatness of touch:<blockquote>
<div>He from the Noise and Injuries of Court,<br>
</div>
<div>Does only so to silent Groves repair,<br>
</div>
<div>As half-tir'd Passengers to <i>Shades</i> resort<br>
</div>
<div>From the offensive fury of the Air.<br>
</div> (stanza 27)</blockquote>Peers was trusted by Dr Fell with a large share (together with Richard Reeves of Magdalen) in an important piece of work, the translation into Latin of Anthony Wood's <span class="italic">History and Antiquities</span> (begun 1670). He was to discover a disadvantage of translating living authors: they can hit back. According to Wood (whose account, written after Peers's death, may retain some personal bias) his initial work was poor, but gradually improved &#145;by great diligence and observation&#146;, so that he became &#145;a compleat master of the Latin tongue, and what he did was excellent&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>). The Latin edition appeared in 1674. Wood greatly resented changes that Fell and Peers had made to his text. Few translators can have endured worse relationships with their authors. Peers and Wood had fist fights in the printing house at the Sheldonian theatre, in a local cookshop, and elsewhere. Peers always lost, &#145;with a bloody nose or a black eye&#146;, and became afraid to meet Wood &#145;for fear of another drubbing&#146;; when Peers became pro-proctor, they were both terrified to meet each other, according to Prideaux (<span class="italic">Letters of Humphrey Prideaux</span>, 8&#150;12; Madan, 299). Peers did exercise his proctorial powers on others, and was reprimanded by the vice-chancellor for &#145;over hasty, and in his opinion imprudent&#146; arrests  (<span class="italic">Letters of Humphrey Prideaux</span>, 38).<br>
<br>In 1674 Peers proposed to publish &#145;some seaman's journall of the Streights of Magellan&#146;, which Prideaux thought &#145;a very ridiculous designe&#146;, beneath a scholar's dignity; that apart, &#145;Dic doeth nothing but drinke ale&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Humphrey Prideaux</span>, 24&#150;8). In 1675 Peers was cheated out of the living of Shrivenham, Berkshire, by Benjamin Woodruffe, who had promised to plead Peers's case while in London, and &#145;effectually doe his businesse for him; as accordingly he did in another sense, the next news we heard beeing that Woodruffe had it for himselfe&#146;  (ibid., 42&#150;3). On 18 September 1675 Peers finally obtained preferment as a reward for his translation, being elected esquire bedell of arts; Wood rather churlishly claims that he would have prevented the appointment, if he had been present. Peers had previously been chosen as grammar lecturer for two years, a post his supporters exerted themselves to retain for him: their effort was wasted, when he &#145;indiscreetly, or rather knavishly&#146; resigned it to a rival behind their backs, &#145;which hath soe much incensed the Dean that it is supposed he would turn him out at Xmas &hellip; none of us have ever since spake to him unlesse it be to obbraid him with his knavery&#146;  (ibid., 44&#150;5). Peers created a precedent, a shocking academic sin. The bedell's post, however, proved profitable; he made &#145;above &pound;200&#146; in his first year, and eventually left his college studentship at the end of 1676  (ibid., 55).<br>
<br>Peers continued to be involved in various publication projects: in 1682 he compiled a large volume on the Netherlands for Moses Pitt's <span class="italic">English Atlas</span>, and in 1684 he contributed to a translation of Nepos. Peers married &#145;an Oxford lady&#146; (since marriage would ordinarily have entailed the loss of his studentship, it must have depended upon his appointment as bedell): they had a son, <a href="#cosubject_21773">Richard [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Wood accuses Peers of neglecting his studies to marry and keep &#145;low, drunken company&#146;; &#145;he enjoyed the comforts of the world&#146;, allegedly to excess, being too fat by 1687 to perform some of his ceremonial duties. Peers had been promoted to esquire bedell of physic, and on 6 July 1688 was licensed to practise medicine. According to Wood:<blockquote>in the latter end of the reign of king James II he applied his mind to the study of physic, having been secretly informed that his beneficial place was to be bestowed on a person more agreeable with the times; but fearing his bulk and fatness, which he had obtained by eating, drinking, and sleeping, would hinder his practice, he quitted that project &hellip; and was resolved, when turned out, to withdraw into the country, and teach a private school. (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.290)</blockquote>From that fate he was saved by the revolution of 1688. Towards the end of his life he compiled the first list of Oxford graduates, covering the years 1659&#150;88 (published 1689; see <span class="italic">Hist. U. Oxf.</span> 4: <span class="italic">17th-cent. Oxf.</span>, 508n.). Peers died at Holywell, Oxford, on 11 August 1690, and was buried in St Aldate's Church.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_21773"></a><span class="headword">Richard Peers</span>  (1685&#150;1739), <span class="occ">clergyman and author</span>, was born in All Saints' parish, Oxford, on 15 July 1685, the son of Richard Peers and his wife. He attended Trinity College, Oxford (matriculated, 1701; scholar, 1702; BA, 1705; MA, 1708), and was vicar of Hartley Wintney, Hampshire (1710&#150;11), and of Faringdon, Berkshire (1711&#150;39). The younger Peers wrote several popular religious works. His <span class="italic">Character of an Honest Dissenter</span> was the cause of some controversy, with replies from opponents in 1716, 1717, and 1718. <span class="italic">A Companion for the Aged</span> was reprinted many times, well into the nineteenth century. He died at Faringdon on 20 July 1739.<br>
