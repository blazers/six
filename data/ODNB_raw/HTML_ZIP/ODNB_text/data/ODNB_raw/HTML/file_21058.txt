<span class="headword">Oxford,  John  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1200), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Norwich</span>, was the son of Henry of Oxford, sheriff of Oxfordshire (<i>d</i>. 1164). He had become rector of St Peter's-in-the-East and of St Mary's, and also rural dean of Oxford, by <i>c</i>.1160, when he was already active in royal administration, frequently attesting charters of Henry II both in England and on the continent. It was, however, the king's dispute with Thomas Becket that propelled him to the front rank of royal councillors. He was probably one of a group charged with drawing up the constitutions of Clarendon, and in February 1164 he was dispatched on the first of several missions to the papal curia and other European courts to argue the royal case. In May 1165, during an embassy to negotiate the marriage of the king's daughter Matilda to Henry the Lion, duke of Bavaria and Saxony, he was present with Richard of Ilchester at the imperial Council of W&uuml;rzburg, and here he allegedly swore that Henry II and his dominions would renounce obedience to Alexander III (<i>r</i>. 1159&#150;81) and would recognize the emperor Frederick Barbarossa's rival pope, Paschal III. Although John strongly denied this, Becket's circle henceforth contemptuously dubbed him <i>iurator</i> (&#145;the oath-taker&#146;). Also early in 1165 John received the deanery of Salisbury, and Becket argued that this was against papal prohibition and effected by royal coercion. John headed the list of those excommunicated by the archbishop at V&eacute;zelay on Whitsunday (12 June) 1166, a sentence confirmed by the pope. This did not, however, disrupt his diplomatic career, and in November 1166 he obtained papal absolution, to the fury of Becket's supporters, who were alarmed by the apparent success of his latest mission to the papal court. He returned to England early in 1167, and convened a council to transmit to the higher clergy of England the instructions of king and pope.<br>
<br>The anticipated settlement was, however, delayed, and for the next three years John was still involved in negotiations relating to the dispute. In August 1169 he was present at discussions between Henry II and the papal legates at Domfront, and subsequently went once more to the papal curia, now at Benevento. When peace was eventually made between archbishop and king at Fr&eacute;teval, it was John who escorted Becket back to England at the end of November 1169, and he who averted an ugly incident when royal officers attempted to intercept the archbishop at Sandwich. He had left Becket before the martyrdom a month later, which ended an episode in his own life. His role is difficult to assess. At times he appears to be an agent, even the instigator, of royal malevolence; occasionally, however, he seems to have been a moderator, attempting to restore peace on reasonable terms. The abuse heaped on him by Becket's adherents is, however, certainly a recognition of his influence in these years of conflict.<br>
<br>After a period of silence John's diplomatic career resumed following his elevation to the bishopric of Norwich in December 1175. The next year he was dispatched to Sicily to finalize negotiations for the marriage of another of the king's daughters. Ralph de Diceto preserves a vivid account of his tribulations on this mission, presumably from John's own mouth. In 1185 he was sent to mediate between the king of France and the count of Flanders. In England he was present at important councils, such as Henry II's arbitration between the kings of Castile and Navarre in March 1177, and at Geddington two months later when the king reached an agreement with the Welsh princes. Between 1176 and 1189 he attested some sixty royal charters, although now these were all issued in England. Most notably, he served Henry II in a judicial capacity. In April 1179 he was appointed with the bishops of Ely and Winchester as one of three chief justices who were to superintend a general eyre of the realm. This fusion of ecclesiastical and secular office, condemned by Becket, was now vigorously defended by Richard of Dover (<i>d</i>. 1184), Becket's successor as archbishop of Canterbury. Thereafter John frequently delivered judgments at Westminster, and as late as 1189 was on eyre in the eastern and south-eastern counties. He was one of the most active justices in the later years of Henry II's reign. He appeared frequently in the company of the new king, Richard I, in late 1189, and in February 1190 was one of the group that crossed to Normandy to discuss the problems arising from the conflict of the two justiciars. In October 1191 he attended the council convened to protest at William de Longchamp's treatment of Archbishop Geoffrey of York. He also acted as justice on eyre at York in 1192 and on the eastern circuit in 1194&#150;5. He was, however, no longer at the centre of policy making, and it is very possible that his relationship with Richard I had become strained after John, who had set out on the third crusade, obtained absolution from his vow from Pope Clement III (<i>r</i>. 1187&#150;91) and returned home from Italy&#151;he was subsequently amerced by the king. His last appearance on the national stage was at the coronation of King John, just a year before his own death on 2 June 1200.<br>
<br>John's elevation to the episcopate in December 1175, at the king's behest, may in one sense be seen, with the promotion of other leading opponents of Becket to Ely and Winchester two years earlier, as a triumph for Henry II's interpretation of the correct relationship between the crown and the English church. In fact, however, John as bishop was far from subservient to the king's government, and was rebuked very publicly by Henry II for his excommunication of the earl of Arundel during a dispute over their respective rights in Lynn. Several times before 1170 John had met Pope Alexander III, one of the great legislators of the medieval church, and after 1175 he participated actively in the expansion and definition of Roman canon law instigated by that pope and his successors. He attended the Third Lateran Council of 1179, and although not one of the most prominent of those employed by the papacy to judge cases in England, he was commissioned as papal judge-delegate by Alexander III on at least five occasions between 1176 and 1181, and in at least three cases thereafter. Three of his letters to the pope requesting the elucidation of doubtful points of canon law were incorporated into the universal law of the church in the <span class="italic">Decretals</span>, or <span class="italic">Liber Extra</span>, of 1234.<br>
<br>The evidence for John of Oxford's administration of his diocese is provided by over 160 surviving <i>acta</i>&#151;this is as many as for the previous three bishops over eighty-three years, and many more have certainly been lost. Their content, as is usual with such collections, is extremely varied&#151;confirmations, institutions, to benefices, institutions and judgments. A large number, however, relate to the regulation of the parochial ministry in East Anglia, and it is notable that, although on fifty-seven recorded occasions he granted the revenues of parish churches to monastic houses, in forty-five of these, in marked contrast to his predecessor, he made specific provision for the service of the church. There is strong circumstantial evidence that, after his retirement from court in the early 1190s, he devoted himself in person to the regulation of his large diocese along lines advocated by more prominent reformers.<br>
<br>John of Oxford's episcopate was, however, marred by a long-running dispute with his monastic cathedral chapter at Norwich. Like many of his contemporaries, including the primate, he was hostile to such institutions, not least because they deprived bishops of lucrative prebends with which they might reward their own clerks. The monks of Norwich complained that Bishop John had inflicted serious financial losses on them, had usurped their patronage of parish churches, had interfered capriciously in the internal administration of their community, and had forbidden them to appeal against his unilateral actions. Pope Celestine III in 1194 and Pope Innocent III in 1200 ruled in favour of the convent, and the bishop's successor, John de Gray (1200&#150;14) made a determined effort to reach an agreement with the monks of Norwich.<br>
<br>John of Oxford was, during the middle years of his career, the object of much abuse from Becket's circle, and, as a bishop, from his own cathedral chapter. The records reveal that he was one of the most active of Henry II's administrators throughout his long reign, employed indifferently in diplomatic, judicial, and financial tasks. It may point to a parallel breadth of intellectual interests that he had links with the astronomer Daniel of Morley, whose <span class="italic">Philosophia</span> was written at John's request. After 1175 John experienced no dramatic conversion, but the evidence of his own <i>acta</i> and of papal decretals addressed to him suggests that he did attempt to apply reforming principles in his own diocese and that he did not shrink, on the rare occasions when he felt it necessary, from confrontation with the secular government. In general, however, he was one of those who believed, like Gilbert Foliot and Hubert Walter, that the interests of the church in England were best served by co-operation with the crown. His criticism of Thomas Becket, expressed to the aged Empress Matilda in 1164, that the archbishop was striving to extend the privileges of the clergy for the sake of ambition and worldly gain, may have been more than propaganda, and a genuine statement of his personal view.<br>
