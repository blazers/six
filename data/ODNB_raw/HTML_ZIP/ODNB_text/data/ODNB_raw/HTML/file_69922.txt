<span class="headword">Scott,  Jean <span class="st"> [Janet]</span></span>, Lady Ferniehirst  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1548, <em>d.</em> after 1593), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was the eldest of the three daughters of Sir William Scott the younger of Buccleuch (1520&#150;1552) and his wife, Grisel (<i>d</i>. after 1552), second daughter of John Betoun of Creich. Jean's grandfather had married as his second wife Janet, daughter of Andrew Kerr of Ferniehirst, but in spite of this close connection a violent feud erupted between the Scotts and the Kerrs, near neighbours on the border with England, and in 1552 the situation worsened still further when Jean's father was killed in a skirmish by the Kerrs. In 1565 both families decided on a reconciliation, and a complicated agreement was drawn up, involving various marriages between Scotts and Kerrs. Sir Thomas Kerr, now laird of Ferniehirst, was the only leading member of his family to refuse to take part in the pacification. Ironically, not one of the arranged marriages took place, but when Sir Thomas's first wife, Janet Kirkcaldy, died, leaving him with five small children, he married Jean Scott, daughter of the murdered Sir William. Their wedding in 1569 finally ended the feud, and Jean and Sir Thomas settled down happily together, although when her brother Sir Walter Scott died in 1574, &pound;1000 of her dowry was still unpaid. From the time of her marriage she was known as Lady Ferniehirst as the laird's wife.<br>
<br>Sir Thomas Kerr was a man of integrity, but his principles resulted in great disruption to their family life. Long active in support of Mary, queen of Scots, he sheltered leaders of the English northern rising at his castle of Ferniehirst, near Jedburgh, in 1569, and as a result an invading English force demolished the building the following spring. He was forced to go into exile on the continent in 1573 after helping his former father-in-law, Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange, in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to hold Edinburgh Castle for Mary, and although he was allowed to return in 1581, he was back in France again in 1583. During the early 1580s Jean was a regular correspondent of Mary, queen of Scots, and in her role as an intermediary between James VI and his mother, did much to keep the exiled queen's cause alive in Scotland. She also ran her husband's estates for him, and on 15 January 1583 he granted her power of attorney to deal with his debts in both France and Scotland.<br>
<br>Jean's activities on her husband's behalf can be glimpsed in a letter she wrote to him from Falkland Palace on 1 September 1583 telling him that she had spent the past month at court trying to persuade James VI to allow him to return. Thanks to the support of the earl of Huntly, her efforts had finally been successful. Sir Thomas could now come back whenever he pleased, she said, and she signed herself in the conventional style of the time, &#145;Your humble and faythfull bedfallou till deith, Jene Scot&#146;  (NA Scot., GD 40, Lothian MSS, portfolio IX). Sir Thomas was restored to public life, but after an incident on the border in 1585, when the English warden's son-in-law Francis, Lord Russell, was killed, he was held partly responsible. He was imprisoned in Aberdeen Castle, where he died the following March, leaving Jean with three sons and a daughter. One of her sons was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4754/', "Robert Carr")</script>, James I's favourite, who became earl of Somerset.<br>
<br>It is not known when Jean Scott died. She is last recorded in 1593, in the only surviving portrait of her, by an unknown artist, which shows her still in deepest mourning, gazing sorrowfully at the viewer. Her hair is concealed by a veil with a widow's peak, she has heavy ropes of pearls round her neck, and her spousing ring can clearly be seen on her right hand, which rests on a book. Above her head is the inscription &#145;Ubi amor, ibi fides&#146; (&#145;where there is love there is faith&#146;). Like many women of her time, she had supported her husband in both public and private life, finding genuine love and contentment in her arranged marriage.<br>
