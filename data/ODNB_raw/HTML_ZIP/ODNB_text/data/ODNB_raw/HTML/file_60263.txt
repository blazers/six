<span class="headword">Allott,  Kenneth Cyril Bruce</span>  (1912&#150;1973), <span class="occ">literary scholar and poet</span>, was born on 29 August 1912 at Cynon surgery, Llanwynno, Mountain Ash, Glamorgan, the elder son of Hubert Cyril Willoughby Allott, a general practitioner, and his wife, Rose Finlay. The family moved to Nenthead, Cumberland, where Kenneth's brother, (Denys Neville) Guy, was born in November 1914. In about 1916 the family moved to Whitchurch, Shropshire, where Allott and Guy, attended local schools before being sent in 1923 to Beaumont College in Berkshire, a Jesuit-run Roman Catholic public school which later joined with Stonyhurst School. By the age of thirteen Allott was reading Kant, and he informed his younger brother that he had renounced his faith. While Allott was at Beaumont his parents separated and Allott's father went to live with a nurse whom he had met during the war. Allott's mother died a few years later&#151;Allott believed from a broken heart. From the age of about fourteen Allott and his brother were brought up by his mother's sisters, Sarah and Mary Finlay. Following the wishes of his aunts, the boys attended St Cuthbert's Roman Catholic Grammar School in Newcastle upon Tyne, where Allott was known as Speedy because he spoke so quickly.<br>
<br>In 1934 Allott graduated with first-class honours from Newcastle's Armstrong College. In 1935 he gained a diploma in education, and in 1936 he became a BLitt student at St Edmund Hall, Oxford. His BLitt dissertation, an edition of the poems of the seventeenth-century Catholic writer William Habington, was published by Liverpool University Press (1948). On 10 July 1936 Allott married Surya Kumari Lall (<i>b</i>. 1913/14), the daughter of Kundan Lall, a barrister. They had a daughter and a son. Soon after the awarding of his BLitt degree, in 1938, Allott began teaching at Burgess Hill School in London, and also at this time began reviewing for the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> and working with Geoffrey Grigson on the poetry magazine <span class="italic">New Verse</span>. He was, along with many other young writers, an observer for Charles Madge's social survey group, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92530', "Mass-Observation")</script>.<br>
<br>In 1940 Allott successfully applied as a conscientious objector and in 1942 he and his family moved to Gateshead, where he had been appointed an extramural lecturer. In 1943 he was appointed a staff tutor at Vaughan College, an extramural college in Leicester, and in 1945 an assistant lecturer in the English department at Liverpool University. In 1948 he was promoted to a lectureship at Liverpool. In November 1950 his first marriage was dissolved, and on 1 June 1951 he married <a href="#cosubject_102474">Miriam Farris [<i>see below</i>]</a>, a fellow lecturer in the English department. In 1955 he was appointed to a senior lectureship and, after a period (1962&#150;3) as acting head of department, in 1964 he became the first holder of the university's newly established Andrew Cecil Bradley chair in modern English literature.<br>
<br>Throughout his academic career Allott was engaged in writing fiction and poetry. In 1937 he had published, in collaboration with Stephen Tait, a comic novel entitled <span class="italic">The Rhubarb Tree</span>, and also a play, <span class="italic">A Room with a View</span>, based on E. M. Forster's novel. He published two collections of poetry, <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1938) and <span class="italic">The Ventriloquist's Doll</span> (1943), and is perhaps best remembered for the widely anthologized &#145;Lament for a Cricket Eleven&#146;. His poetry was influenced by Auden and Eliot, and is characterized by an elegiac tone, by flashes of surrealism, and by a keen sense of morality. He was regarded by many&#151;including Francis Scarfe, who devotes an entire chapter on Allott's work in his <span class="italic">Auden and after: the Liberation of Poetry, 1930&#150;41</span> (1942)&#151;as one of the most promising young poets of his day.<br>
<br>During the 1960s and early 1970s Allott held several visiting professorships&#151;at the University of Otago, and with the British Council in New Zealand and in India (New Delhi). During this period he was a member of the advisory boards of <span class="italic">Victorian Poetry</span> and <span class="italic">Victorian Studies</span>, and was also general editor of the five-volume anthology <span class="italic">The Pelican Book of English Prose</span> (1956), and a general editor of the <span class="italic">Oxford History of English Literature</span>.<br>
<br>Allott was an outstanding scholar and a leading authority on Victorian literature. He edited selections of the work of Winthrop Mackworth Praed and Robert Browning, wrote essays on Keats, Shelley, and Clough, and edited the standard Longmans annotated edition of Matthew Arnold's <span class="italic">Complete Poems</span> (1965). His other scholarly works include a biography of Jules Verne (1940) and a book written with Miriam Allott, <span class="italic">The Art of Graham Greene</span> (1951). He reviewed regularly for the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>. Allott was always youthful in appearance, witty, enthusiastic, an extremely popular lecturer, and a great lover of cats. He was also a heavy smoker, believing wrongly that his lungs would be protected because of an earlier illness from tuberculosis (<i>c</i>.1949&#150;50).<br>
<br>Besides his academic work on Victorian literature Allott was a champion of new writing. At Oxford he co-edited the literary magazine <span class="italic">Programme</span>, and was assistant editor of the influential poetry magazine <span class="italic">New Verse</span> from 1936 to 1939. His anthology <span class="italic">The Penguin Book of Contemporary Verse</span> (1950; revised and enlarged, 1962) was used widely in schools and colleges.<br>
<br>Kenneth Allot died at Broadgreen Hospital, Liverpool, on 23 May 1973, of lung cancer. He was cremated at Anfield cemetery, Liverpool. Allott's <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> was published posthumously in 1975.<br>
<br>Allott's second wife, <a name="cosubject_102474"></a><span class="headword">Miriam Allott <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Farris]</span></span>  (1920&#150;2010), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, was born on 16 June 1920 at 48 Drive Mansions, Fulham, London, the daughter of Labib Farris, an Egyptian medical student, and his wife, Ada Violet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rennie. Her parents had married in Birkenhead a few months before her birth. She was educated at the English School in Cairo, the Froebel Demonstration School (where she was a contemporary of Iris Murdoch), and the University of Liverpool (where she was a contemporary of Frank Kermode). After graduating during the Second World War with a BA in general studies she taught at Rock Ferry School, in the Wirral, while also studying for her PhD in English literature at Liverpool, where she joined the staff as a lecturer in 1948. She was a gifted teacher and of striking appearance, with black hair and &#145;chiaroscuro eyes&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 Sept 2010). Her <span class="italic">Novelists on the Novel</span> (1959) was widely read. After her husband's death she completed and saw to publication his Longman edition of Matthew Arnold's poetry, followed by her own selection of Keats's poetry. She was also a noted scholar of E. M. Forster. She succeeded her husband as A. C. Bradley professor of modern literature at Liverpool, finishing her career as a professor at Birkbeck College, London, from 1981 to 1985 before returning to Liverpool.<br>
<br>Miriam Allott was an active supporter of many organizations, including the Liverpool Association and the Liverpool Playhouse. She was a discerning collector of nineteenth-century English pictures, including several by the watercolourist David Cox and travel illustrations by Edward Lear, and built an extensive library of nineteenth-century editions and subsequent critical studies. In later life she suffered from osteoporosis, arthritis, and latterly breast cancer. She died at her home, 21 Mersey Avenue, Liverpool, on 17 August 2010, of bronchopneumonia. She had no children, and left her house to Liverpool University to fund a lectureship in English, and her books and pictures to the university library and Victoria Gallery and Museum.<br>
