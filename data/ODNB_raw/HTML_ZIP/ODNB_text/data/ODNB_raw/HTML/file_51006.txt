<span class="headword">Ketelbey,  Abel</span>  (1675/6&#150;1744), <span class="occ">barrister and politician</span>, was the first surviving son of Edward Ketelbey (<i>d</i>. 1725), of Bitterley Court, Shropshire, and his wife, Anne (<i>bap</i>. 1656), daughter of Abel Gower of Baughton St John's, Worcestershire. He matriculated (aged fifteen) at Balliol College, Oxford, on 1 July 1691, entered the Middle Temple on 11 July 1693, and was called to the bar on 19 May 1699. On 18 February 1704 he married Mary Williams at St Ethelburga's, Bishopsgate, London. They had one daughter, also named Mary. In the same year he was made a freeman of Ludlow, Shropshire.<br>
<br>In March 1709 Ketelbey purchased 500 acres in South Carolina, and consequently was made a landgrave of the colony, although there is no evidence that he actually visited his property. In July 1709 he acted as a witness to the will of the governor of Carolina, Colonel Edward Tynte, made in preparation for his return to the colony. By 1710 Ketelbey was coming to the fore as a lawyer in London. Narcissus Luttrell noted in January that Ketelbey had acted in the queen's bench for three men accused of drinking Henry Sacheverell's health, and in December 1710 he signed a legal appeal to the House of Lords. He served as agent for Carolina between 1712 and 1716 and, presumably because of his colonial links, in July 1713 he was proposed for membership of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. In 1715 in particular he was active in representing the colony at the Board of Trade and Plantations, putting the case of the planters and merchants for government relief in the face of pressure from the indigenous population and the adjoining French settlements. However, in 1716 he was discharged from acting as agent for Carolina. In December 1716 he was retained as counsel by many of the Jacobite prisoners facing trial in Carlisle, following the failure of the rising of 1715. He reportedly received at least &pound;500 in fees but, as many of those charged entered guilty pleas, it is not certain how many trials he actually attended. In October 1719 he appeared at the Old Bailey as defence counsel for John Matthews, a nineteen-year-old printer accused of printing and publishing a libel, <span class="italic">Vox populi, vox Dei</span>, arguing that the law in this case was &#145;making that high treason which was never high treason before&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 15.1364). Nevertheless, Matthews was found guilty and executed.<br>
<br>Ketelbey's appearance in such a high-profile trial may indicate that his political ambitions were becoming more apparent. Following the death of Sir Thomas Powis in April 1719 he was elected recorder of Ludlow. Another indication of a new direction to Ketelbey's career may be that the one-time counsel for Jacobites came to defend a government whig. In 1720 his appearance at Hereford assizes as counsel for the lord chancellor, Thomas Parker, first Baron Macclesfield, against Thomas Coningsby, first earl of Coningsby, resulted in a pamphlet by Coningsby, <span class="italic">The First Part of the Earl of Coningsby's Case Relating to the Vicarage of Leominster</span>, which was voted a scandalous libel by the House of Lords on 21 February 1721 for the accusations it levelled against Macclesfield and his agents.<br>
<br>Ketelbey was returned to parliament for Ludlow in the general election of 1722, combining with Acton Baldwyn to defeat one of the incumbents, Humphrey Walcot. The other sitting MP, Sir Robert Raymond, the attorney-general, had been forced to find a seat in Cornwall. Returning, perhaps, to a previous political alignment, in November 1722 Ketelbey acted as defence counsel for the Jacobite conspirator Christopher Layer in a high-profile treason trial in the king's bench, which acted as the forerunner to the bill of pains and penalties proffered against Francis Atterbury, bishop of Rochester, in 1723. Ketelbey argued successfully that Layer's chains should be removed during the trial, but failed in his attempts to have the case thrown out owing to a defective indictment. Thereafter he attempted to puncture the prosecution case by questioning the credibility of the crown's witnesses, but without effect as Layer was found guilty and eventually executed.<br>
<br>Ketelbey is recorded as having spoken occasionally in the House of Commons and indeed on one of the days on which he appeared in court in the Layer trial (26 November 1722) he was appointed to a select committee on a petition from the merchants and traders to the Carolinas, Spain, and Portugal. On 7 March 1724 he offered a clause to the house watering down the bill amending the act which ordered the registration of Roman Catholics in Scotland and those in Great Britain refusing the oaths for the security of the government, and on 2 December 1724 he supported the introduction of a bill to deal with the &#145;evil-minded Persons&#146; who had settled in Wapping, &#145;under the Pretence of being Shelterers for Debt&#146; but instead committed &#145;great Violences and Outrages&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 20.352).<br>
<br>Ketelbey's busy legal career may have been responsible for his failure to win a seat at the 1727 general election. He stood as one of the tory candidates at Great Bedwyn, Worcestershire, under the patronage of Charles, Lord Bruce, but came bottom of the poll. Bruce's father, Thomas Bruce, second earl of Ailesbury, an exiled Jacobite, wrote after the election that Ketelbey had done more than merely practise his profession &#145;for his name hath been so often in print in relation to trials on the crown side&#146;  (Lawson, 189). As Ketelbey was one of the leading pleaders in the king's bench and in chancery in 1720 and was still a leading pleader in 1740, his essentially professional approach, which led to him representing both the government and its opponents, clearly had a political cost.<br>
<br>In August 1724 Ketelbey's daughter had married Robert Johnston (<i>d</i>. 1743), the younger of the two sons of Gideon Johnston, commissary of Carolina (<i>d</i>. 1716), who had been sent to England to be educated in 1712, and after being entered at the Middle Temple had been called to the bar in May 1724. Robert Johnston Ketelbey, as he became, was made a sergeant-at-law in 1736, his sponsors being Lord Bruce (Ketelbey's political patron) and John, second Baron Carteret (a proprietor of Carolina). Ketelbey's grandson, Abel Johnston Ketelbey, was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1736, while Ketelbey was serving as treasurer of the inn.<br>
<br>Ketelbey died on 5 December 1744 at Lamb's Building, in the Middle Temple, and was buried at Bitterley, Shropshire. As he had outlived his son-in-law, &#145;Mr Serjeant Ketelbey&#146;, who had died in June 1743, he was succeeded in his estate by his grandson.<br>
