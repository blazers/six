<span class="headword">Hunt,  Edgar Hubert</span>  (1909&#150;2006), <span class="occ">musician</span>, was born on 28 June 1909 at 2 Upper Byron Place, Clifton, Bristol, the only son and elder child of Hubert Walter Hunt (1865&#150;1945), organist and master of the choristers at Bristol Cathedral, and his wife, Clara Harriett Clements, teacher and singer, daughter of James Clements, village schoolmaster, of Haddenham, Buckinghamshire. On his father's side he came from a long line of church musicians: his grandfather had been a tenor lay clerk at St George's, Windsor. He was educated at Bristol grammar school, and in 1927 he took up a flute scholarship at Trinity College of Music, London. He was awarded the college's diploma in 1930, but remained at Trinity until 1933, having more lessons while unsuccessfully attempting a MusB degree of Durham University. In 1933 he was apprenticed to the music reader in the music printing factory of Novellos, and remained there for a year after finishing his apprenticeship in 1936.<br>
<br>It was at Trinity that Hunt became interested in the recorder, through the director of studies, Joseph Cox Bridge, the former organist at Chester Cathedral who in 1886 had discovered the &#145;Chester recorders&#146; in the vaults of the cathedral. Hunt first heard recorders played in 1928, at a recital by the German Singers in Bristol, and fell in love with the pure sound of the instrument. He bought a treble recorder made by Oskar Dawson, and after teaching himself to play from <span class="italic">The Modern Music Master</span> (1731) he visited the Haslemere festival for the first time in 1930. Wanting to teach schoolchildren the recorder (he already taught the flute and the clarinet), but finding there was no recorder tutor available in England, he wrote his own, <span class="italic">A Concise Tutor for Descant, Treble and Tenor Recorders for Use in Schools</span> and <span class="italic">A Practical Method for the Recorder</span> (both 1935). There were no inexpensive recorders available either, unlike the situation in Germany, where recorders had been mass-produced since the early 1930s. But Hunt discovered that these recorders had a simplified fingering system, which meant that they had a limited range, poor sound quality, and were out of tune in most keys. In 1934 he persuaded one German maker, Wilhelm Herwig, to produce recorders with what he called &#145;English fingering&#146;, based on eighteenth-century fingering. He passed the Herwig agency on to a Liverpool firm, and recorder playing began to be introduced into elementary schools. Hunt was supported in this by Cyril Winn, chief inspector of schools. With his ensemble, Old Music with Old Instruments, he gave concerts in schools around the country so that the children could see and hear the instruments. But although he wanted every child to play the recorder, he fought all his life against the notion that the recorder was just something to play before moving on to a &#145;real&#146; instrument.<br>
<br>Already teaching flute at Trinity, Hunt started recorder evening classes in 1935, and it was thanks to him that in 1937 Trinity started setting external recorder examinations, the first examination board to do so. In 1938 he was responsible for Trinity establishing the school of old music at Old Devonshire House, Bloomsbury; this was the first early music department in a music college in Europe. It closed at the outbreak of the Second World War, but was revived in 1947 as the department of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century music, with Hunt as head&#151;he taught recorder, baroque flute, and viola da gamba&#151;and Trinity became the first music conservatory in the world to award recorder diplomas.<br>
<br>In 1937 Hunt began to work for Schott &amp; Co., the music publisher. He had been publishing recorder music since 1934, and in 1938 Schotts published the first of many collections of music arranged for recorder by him, <span class="italic">Twelve National Airs</span> and <span class="italic">Twelve Christmas Carols</span>. In 1937, with his friends Max and Stephanie Champion, and with Carl Dolmetsch, he founded the Society of Recorder Players. He started, and from 1937 to 1941 co-edited, <span class="italic">Recorder News</span>, the journal of the society. In the first months of 1940 he produced <span class="italic">Edgar Hunt's Recorder News-Letter</span>, and broadcast illustrated talks on the recorder. He was also invited to direct the first summer school for recorder players at Downe House, near Newbury, in 1939; these continued until 1960. On 11 June 1938 he had married Elizabeth Willingham Voss (<i>d</i>. 1966), daughter of Edward George Voss, an industrial chemist who worked in the oil industry before becoming a schoolmaster; they had one daughter. Elizabeth Voss had founded the quarterly <span class="italic">The Amateur Musician</span> in 1935, for which Hunt started to write soon after it began, starting a &#145;Home music supplement&#146; in which he published recorder music.<br>
<br>As the outbreak of the Second World War became imminent, and the supply of cheap wooden recorders from Germany was no longer available, Hunt, in collaboration with Mark Barnes of Barnes and Mullins, began to design plastic recorders. These were manufactured by Schotts throughout the war. From 1941 to 1946 Hunt served in the Royal Artillery in India and was commissioned into the Inter-Services Broadcasting Unit in New Delhi, but after the war he returned to Trinity and to Schotts, where he was in charge of recorder music and recorder marketing, and had a workshop where he tested and repaired Schott recorders. He and Walter Bergmann built up the recorder catalogue and Schotts became the leading publisher of music for the recorder. His many editions included Anthony Holborne's <span class="italic">Pavans, Galliards, and Almans</span> (1599) arranged for recorder consort, a complete edition of John Dowland's consort music, and the four Handel recorder sonatas. He spent much time in the British Museum discovering a previously unknown repertoire for the recorder. The Society of Recorder Players was revived in 1946, and Hunt was elected chairman; he retired from this position in 1972. In 1948 he was one of the founders of the Recorder in Education Summer School; he was chairman until 1989, having been a tutor every year since the beginning. From 1962 to 1968 he collaborated with Jean Henry in organizing Anglo-French recorder courses, and from 1975 to 1995 he taught at Jean Henry's Rencontres Internationales de Musique Ancienne et Danses du Cour. He also ran courses on Renaissance music and dance at Missenden Abbey for many years.<br>
<br>Although he had first become interested in the recorder as a historical instrument, Hunt also encouraged contemporary composers to write for it. His favourite modern solo work for the recorder was Rubbra's <span class="italic">Meditazioni sopra &#145;Coeurs d&eacute;sol&eacute;s&#146;</span>, commissioned by Dolmetsch at Hunt's suggestion for his Wigmore Hall recital in 1949.<br>
<br>Hunt published <span class="italic">The Recorder and its Music</span> in 1952. This became the standard work in English, and was revised and updated in 1977. He also edited the <span class="italic">Recorder and Music Magazine</span> from 1974 until 1991, writing extensively for it, and although he was not a harpsichordist, in 1974 he started and until its demise in 1986 edited the <span class="italic">Harpsichord Magazine</span> (latterly the <span class="italic">English Harpsichord Magazine</span>). He wrote tutors for the bass recorder (1974) and the crumhorn (1975), and in 1977 brought out <span class="italic">Robert Lucas Pearsall, &#145;the compleat gentleman&#146;, and his Music (1795&#150;1856)</span>, based on a lifetime's research by his father, Hubert Hunt. He was a founding member of the Galpin Society, started in 1946 to further the study of the history of musical instruments.<br>
<br>Hunt retired from Schotts in 1974, and from Trinity in 1981. Despite his enormous influence on the revival of recorder playing in England he was a modest and unassuming person who preferred to keep out of the limelight, while working quietly behind the scenes. Described by many as the perfect English gentleman, he was good-humoured, tactful, patient, and generous with his time. A dedicated teacher, he wanted to make the recorder and its music available to as many people as possible. He died on 16 March 2006 at Wycombe Hospital, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, of bronchopneumonia. He was survived by his daughter, Rosemary. As a tribute Colin Hand wrote <span class="italic">Quartet in Memoriam Edgar Hunt</span> (2006); a memorial concert was held on 11 November 2006 at the Old Royal Naval College chapel, Greenwich.<br>
