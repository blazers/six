<span class="headword">King,  John</span>  (1788&#150;1847), <span class="occ">history and portrait painter</span>, was born in Dartmouth, Devon, and at twenty entered the Royal Academy Schools. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1814 and from 1817 showed there almost annually until 1845. The majority of his subjects were drawn from the <span class="roman">Bible</span> or from Shakespeare. From 1821 he was also a fairly regular exhibitor at the British Institution, but from 1824 at least half the works he showed there were portraits. King had moved to Bristol by early 1824, for in June a local newspaper reported that his painting of Jeremiah, for whom he had used a Bristol sitter, had sold on the opening day of the British Institution exhibition to Earl Fitzwilliam.<br>
<br>In October 1825 King lectured at the Bristol Institution on his recollections of the fine arts of Flanders, implying an earlier visit to the continent. There is, however, little evidence of King entering into the social life of the Bristol artists [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95531', "Bristol school of artists")</script>]. He has been confused with the Bristol surgeon and friend of so many Bristol artists, Dr John King (born Johann Koenig, (1766&#150;1846)). Dr King was to review King's work, finding it singularly unoriginal and conventional. King may have moved back to London as early as 1826, but he maintained close contacts with Bristol and exhibited there until at least 1839. He completed an enormous and now lost painting, <span class="italic">The Incredulity of St Thomas</span>, for St Thomas's Church in Bristol in 1828 and in 1830 his altarpiece for St Mark's Chapel on College Green, Bristol, was installed (later high in the north transept). In 1828 King exhibited a portrait of the Plymouth-born artist James Northcote RA whose grandiose Shakespearian subjects King may well have striven to emulate, and in the following year he exhibited a portrait of Francis Danby ARA (City Museum and Art Gallery, Bristol), whom King claimed as a friend. He died, presumably unmarried, of apoplexy at Dartmouth on 12 July 1847. Samuel Redgrave noted that his paintings, &#145;most of which remained on his hands, were sold by auction the same year, and produced only small sums&#146;  (Redgrave, <span class="italic">Artists</span>, 251). King bequeathed all his estate to his niece Sarah Elizabeth King of Brixham, Devon.<br>
