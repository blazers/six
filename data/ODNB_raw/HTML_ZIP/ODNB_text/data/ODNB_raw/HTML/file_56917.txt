<span class="headword">Barrow,  George</span>  (1853&#150;1932), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born in London on 11 December 1853. He was the fifth child (and the third son) in the family of eight of John George Barrow (<i>b</i>. 1805/6), a general practitioner at the Royal College of Surgeons, and his wife, Eleanor (<i>b</i>. 1827/8). After study at the Philological School under Dr Abbott, Barrow matriculated at London University in 1871, holding a Turner scholarship. Admitted to King's College, he studied science, winning prizes in mathematics and geology. He then entered employment as secretary to the distinguished geologist and banker George Poulett Scrope, who, being aged, deaf, and blind, engaged him to read loudly for six hours a day. Presumably giving satisfaction in this, Barrow was recommended to Andrew Ramsay and was appointed to the geological survey on Scrope's death in 1876. Barrow gained much mineralogical knowledge from Allan Dick of the Royal School of Mines, and eventually advanced to district geologist for the London region in 1909. He retired in 1915.<br>
<br>Barrow's early survey work was carried out around Cleveland, Yorkshire, whence he moved to the south-eastern highlands of Scotland, to south-west England, to the midlands, and, finally, to the London region. In the midlands, Barrow worked on the Staffordshire coalfields and around Cheadle. In the south-west, he studied the Isles of Scilly and granitic regions such as Bodmin, with their &#145;aureoles&#146; of metamorphosed rocks. In the London area, he was active in economic geology, studying the water supply and advising on the construction of the underground system. It was, however, in Scotland, where he worked from 1884 to 1900, that Barrow made his most notable contributions, through his study of metamorphic rocks of the south-east Grampians, particularly in the lonely region between Glen Esk and Glen Clova in Forfarshire. Here he found it possible to analyse the region's schists according to their subsidiary minerals&#151;biotite, garnet, staurolite, kyanite, and sillimanite. Barrow took these to indicate the degree of metamorphism of the original argillaceous rocks, resulting from the action of different intensities of heat and pressure. Thus Barrow found an invaluable tool (for which there were some less well-developed precedents) for subdividing and mapping metamorphic rocks, and the notion of such &#145;Barrovian zones&#146; has become well established in geological theory.<br>
<br>However, though Barrow's originality was recognized and admired by his colleagues, his tenacity of views was not always appreciated. For example, extrapolating his zone concept, he held that the three main metamorphic regions of Scotland (later called Lewisian, Moinian, and Dalradian) were derived from the same source, being of Lewisian age but metamorphosed to different degrees. This notion was not accepted, and indeed was not formally published, apart from some comments to a paper by Cecil Tilley (1925). Eventually, Barrow's disagreements with his colleagues became such that it was thought best to move him from Scotland to the less controversial geology of the English midlands.<br>
<br>Barrow is recorded by his colleague Edward Greenly as having the demeanour of a schoolboy, but possessed of &#145;one of the most daring minds that modern geology has known&#146;  (Edward Greenly, <span class="italic">A Hand through Time</span>, 1938). He had the reputation of being a keen sportsman, a good shot and expert fisherman. He was awarded the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall's Bolitho medal (1912), and the Geological Society's Murchison medal (1913). He was president of the Geologists' Association for 1916&#150;18 and led many of its field excursions in south-east England. Barrow died of angina at Clovelly, Haddon Road, Chorleywood, Hertfordshire on 23 July 1932.<br>
