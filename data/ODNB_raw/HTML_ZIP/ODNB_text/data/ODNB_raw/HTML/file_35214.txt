<span class="headword">Newman,  Ernest</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>William Roberts]</span>  (1868&#150;1959), <span class="occ">music critic</span>, was born William Roberts in Everton, Lancashire, on 30 November 1868, the only child of Seth Roberts, a tailor, and his second wife, Harriet Spark, whose first married name was Jones. Both parents also had families by their first spouses. William Roberts was brought up in the Anglican faith which he later violently rejected. From an early age he studied the piano and as a boy became interested in vocal music, especially opera. He attempted some composition and studied harmony and counterpoint without formal instruction. He quickly became acquainted with a large quantity of music, including all the Wagner operas, through reading scores, a practice he later advocated with enthusiasm. From St Saviour's School in Everton he won a scholarship to the middle school of Liverpool College and graduated as a student at University College, Liverpool, in 1886, having studied English literature, philosophy, and art. He intended to pursue a diplomatic career, but due to ill health he was unable to take the examinations for the Indian Civil Service before reaching the age limit of nineteen. Instead he became a clerk in the Bank of Liverpool (1889&#150;1903), meanwhile contributing to a number of progressive journals, not only on music but on literature, religion, and philosophical subjects.<br>
<br>Newman became president of the Liverpool branch of the National Secular Society in 1894 and began contributing to Charles Bradlaugh's journal, the <span class="italic">Nationalist Reformer</span>. It was at the National Secular Society that he met J. M. Robertson and initiated a friendship that continued until Robertson's death in 1933. Robertson's writings, especially his <span class="italic">New Essays towards a Critical Method</span> (1897), exercised a decisive influence, reflected in his lifelong study of the philosophy of criticism and in the preface to his first book, <span class="italic">Gluck and the Opera</span> (1895), which he wrote as Ernest Newman. The pseudonym was intended to signify his outlook as a &#145;new man in earnest&#146;, but it corresponded to some psychological need, since he thereafter adopted it in private as well as public life, although he never legally ratified the change. In 1897 he published <span class="italic">Pseudo-Philosophy at the End of the Nineteenth Century</span>, a criticism from the point of view of &#145;aggressive Rationalism&#146; of writings by Benjamin Kidd, Henry Drummond, and A. J. Balfour, under the name Hugh Mortimer Cecil, but he did not use this name again. This volume was a penetrating and cogent refutation of mock scientific writing and subjective theological speculation. It displayed the three most prominent characteristics of his critical thought: scepticism, dialectic skill, and passion for accuracy.<br>
<br>Although Newman had often referred to music in his writings on other subjects, it was not until 1894 that he began to write regularly on the subject. His first articles were written for Granville Bantock in his <span class="italic">New Quarterly Musical Review</span>. He also owed to Bantock commissions to write programme notes for his concerts and later (in 1903), when Bantock was principal of the Birmingham and Midland Institute school of music, an invitation to join the staff. In 1905 Newman published his <span class="italic">Musical Studies</span> and left Birmingham to become music critic of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. His trenchant pen and independence of view sometimes upset the Hall&eacute; committee and Hans Richter, but established his critical reputation as a champion of Bruckner, Sibelius, Strauss, and Elgar.<br>
<br>From the very start of his career as a music critic Newman tackled head-on the most perplexing aesthetic issues of the day. He convincingly challenged accepted notions and the opinions of renowned philosophical thinkers&#151;as when, for example, during the course of his second book, <span class="italic">A Study of Wagner</span> (1899), he denounced Herbert Spencer's theories of the origin and function of music. In 1906 the <span class="italic">Birmingham Post</span> recalled him to Birmingham, where he remained until 1919. During these years he wrote studies of Wagner (1899 and 1904), Strauss (1908), Elgar (1906), and Hugo Wolf (1907). This last book remained for thirty years the best monograph on its subject and was translated into German. In 1914 came <span class="italic">Wagner as Man and Artist</span>, which showed Newman's analytical powers, his independence&#151;it was critical of <span class="italic">Mein Leben</span> and consequently not well received at Bayreuth&#151;his appreciation of the Wagnerian music drama, and his extreme care over documentation. In the second chapter Newman makes his position regarding the composer's philosophical intentions unequivocal, writing of &#145;one of the most curious of Wagner's hallucinations&#151;the idea that the musical stage can be the dispenser of profound philosophy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wagner as Man and Artist</span>, 19). Here for the first time is the expression of Newman's inability to accept the ideological framework of Wagnerian music drama; he may have abandoned rationalist propaganda, but not the tenets of his philosophical position. This book led him on to his great work: <span class="italic">The Life of Richard Wagner</span>, in four volumes published between 1933 and 1947. This in turn gave rise as a by-product to a study, <span class="italic">The Man Liszt</span> (1934). In counteracting the false portrait of Liszt built up by earlier biographers Newman went to the other extreme. His rationalist perspective prejudiced him against accepting Liszt's religious conviction, which in turn blinded him to other qualities. Making a case through carefully selecting information was a feature of Newman's criticism which could be as misleading as it was persuasive; <span class="italic">The Man Liszt</span> tarnished his critical integrity.<br>
<br>In 1919 Newman moved from Birmingham to London, where he had been appointed music critic of the Sunday newspaper, <span class="italic">The Observer</span>. He joined the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> in 1920 and remained with that newspaper until his retirement in 1958 (but had a five-month stint in 1923 as guest critic of the <span class="italic">New York Evening Post</span>). During these years he not only wrote regular reviews and a more substantial weekly article, but also a large number of programme notes, weekly articles for the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> (1919&#150;24) and the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> (1924&#150;8), and a huge number of articles for music periodicals. From 1930 he made weekly broadcasts on music for the BBC, as well as writing a sporting column for the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>.<br>
<br>Newman's lack of sympathy for the main trends in contemporary music, and his disillusionment with the apparent chaos of criticism in responding to it, led him to attempt a philosophy of criticism in his <span class="italic">A Musical Critic's Holiday</span> (1925). In an age in which the past and future of music seemed irreconcilable it was natural for a rationalist to try to discern standards that maintained continuity in order to give criticism an objective basis. While his attempt to provide a physiology of criticism in <span class="italic">The Unconscious Beethoven</span> (1927) had no lasting impact, his efforts to bring a psychological perspective to the biography of composers were more significant.<br>
<br>A collection of his articles was published in 1919 entitled <span class="italic">A Musical Motley</span>, and from the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> two other selections were made by Felix Aprahamian in 1956 and 1958. These serve to show Newman's great range, which was sometimes overlooked because of his undoubted predilection for the nineteenth century and for opera. On the latter he published his most enduring and widely read works: <span class="italic">Opera Nights</span> (1943), <span class="italic">Wagner Nights</span> (1949), and <span class="italic">More Opera Nights</span> (1954). He had translated most of Wagner's opera texts by 1912 and he translated Felix Weingartner's <span class="italic">On Conducting</span> (1906) and Schweitzer's <span class="italic">J. S. Bach</span> (1911).<br>
<br>Newman was married twice: first, on 3 February 1894, to Kate Eleanor Woollett (<i>d</i>. 1918), daughter of Henry Woollett, an artist descended from the engraver William Woollett; second, in 1919, to Vera Agnes Hands, daughter of Arthur Hands, a Birmingham jeweller. There were no children of either marriage.<br>
<br>Newman rigidly refused all honours until in extreme old age he no longer had the energy to decline them. Finland conferred on him the order of the White Rose in 1956; Germany the Grosse Dienstkreuz in 1958; and the University of Exeter the DLitt in 1959. In 1955 he was presented with a Festschrift, a collection of essays by colleagues and admirers: <span class="italic">Fanfare for Ernest Newman</span>, edited by Herbert van Thal, who later edited a further selection of Newman's writings in <span class="italic">Testament of Music</span> (1962). A large collection of Newman's notebooks, correspondence, and other papers was donated to the Lila Acheson Wallace Library at the Juilliard School, New York, in 1976 by Walter Legge.<br>
<br>Ernest Newman died at Tadworth, Surrey, on 7 July 1959 and was cremated two days later. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
