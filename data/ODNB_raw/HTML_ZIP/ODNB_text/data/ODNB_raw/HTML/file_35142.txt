</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Muir,  (John) Ramsay Bryce</span>  (1872&#150;1941), <span class="occ">historian and politician</span>, was born on 30 September 1872 at Otterburn, Northumberland, the oldest of five children of the Revd Alexander Bryce Muir and his wife, Jane, daughter of Thomas Rowatt of Edinburgh. Muir's father, Reformed Presbyterian minister at Otterburn and later Birkenhead, Cheshire, died while Ramsay was a child. After private schooling in Birkenhead, Muir attended University College, Victoria University, Liverpool, from 1889 to 1894, and Balliol College, Oxford, where he held a Brackenbury scholarship and gained first classes in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1897) and modern history (1898).<br>
<br>From 1898 to 1899 Muir was assistant lecturer in history, under T. F. Tout, at the University of Manchester. In 1899 he became lecturer in history, and in 1906 professor, at his Liverpool alma mater, where he remained until resigning in 1913. At Liverpool, Muir was active in faculty politics, being influential in promoting student self-government and in securing a university charter in 1903. A visiting lectureship at the University of Punjab in India (1913&#150;14), preceded Muir's assuming the professorship of modern history at the University of Manchester. His tenure at Manchester was interrupted in 1917&#150;19 by service on a commission investigating Calcutta University and Indian post-secondary education. He resigned his professorship in 1921 to begin the political work that monopolized most of the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Muir was a prolific writer of textbooks and popular works on history, international relations, economics, and politics, including the widely used <span class="italic">Short History of the British Commonwealth</span> (2 vols., 1920&#150;22). He was also co-author (with George Philip and Robert McElroy) of several respected historical atlases. Although Muir projected works of original scholarship, notably a biography of Warren Hastings, his busy life as teacher and subsequently politician precluded them, and his career as a historical writer was &#145;unfinished&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). His only researched study was a <span class="italic">History of Liverpool</span>, published in 1907.<br>
<br>After the First World War, Muir became interested in the revival of the Liberal Party through a programme of economic and social reform. His book <span class="italic">Liberalism and Industry</span> (1920), endorsed by the National Liberal Federation, was widely viewed as initiating a Liberal renaissance. He was one of the founders, in 1921, of the Liberal summer school, an annual colloquium on contemporary issues, intended to restore interest and confidence in the party as an instrument of change. Under Muir's leadership and inspiration, the school&#151;held in alternate years at Cambridge and Oxford&#151;survived until 1939, although after 1931 it was in decline like the Liberal Party itself. Throughout its existence and beyond, the summer school was a source of ideas for all political parties.<br>
<br>Muir was an assiduous Liberal journalist and propagandist. After sale of <span class="italic">The Nation</span> in 1922 to a consortium headed by John Maynard Keynes, Muir was considered for the editorship, but he and Keynes were unable to agree on terms. In addition to contributing frequently to <span class="italic">The Nation</span> from 1923 to 1930, Muir was editor of the <span class="italic">Weekly Westminster</span>, a subsidiary of the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span>, from 1923 to 1926. He also edited during the 1930s the <span class="italic">Westminster Newsletter</span>, a weekly commentary on Liberal Party affairs.<br>
<br>During the 1920s and 1930s Muir was deeply involved in Liberal electoral politics and party organization. A member of the House of Commons for Rochdale for only a few months during the 1923&#150;4 parliament, he unsuccessfully contested this constituency in 1922, 1924, and 1929, as well as other seats in general and by-elections in 1926, 1931, and 1935. He was active in the Liberal and Radical Candidates' Association during the 1920s.<br>
<br>Muir was a prominent figure in the National Liberal Federation (NLF) and the Liberal Central Association, the party's London headquarters. Service as chairman of the party's executive, the organization committee, in 1930&#150;31 was followed by the chairmanship (1931&#150;3) and presidency (1933&#150;6) of the NLF. He was a driving spirit behind the party reorganization of 1936, and briefly (in 1936) acted as vice-president of the new Liberal Party Organization (LPO). From 1936 until his death he chaired the education and propaganda committee of the LPO and contributed to party literature. During the early part of the Second World War, Muir was a volunteer writer and lecturer for the Ministry of Information. He died, unmarried, at his home, Roseneath, Elm Park Road, Pinner, Middlesex, on 4 May 1941.<br>
<br>Muir was an articulate if not especially creative political thinker. His ideas in many ways constituted a regression from the radical, social democratic &#145;new Liberalism&#146; of the early 1900s to a more traditional, individualistic Liberalism. He placed his faith in rational progress and enlightened capitalism, while seeing much room for improvement in the industrial system. He was critical of socialism, which he thought encouraged class conflict, and trade unions, which he believed tyrannized over their members. He viewed defence of private property and personal freedom, and promotion of equal opportunity, as more important obligations of the state than provision of welfare. He maintained that only the industrious and thrifty were worthy of any but minimal social benefits, and that high taxation undermined the motivation needed to create and increase national wealth. Government, he argued, should create a level playing field for free enterprise but resist unnecessary intervention in the economy. He defended free trade, even after it became a political liability in the 1930s.<br>
<br>Muir's ideas paralleled those of David Lloyd George, whose leadership of the Liberal Party in the late 1920s he generally supported although never fully trusted. He was an important contributor to the policy studies sponsored by Lloyd George which in 1928 produced <span class="italic">Britain's Industrial Future</span>, better known as the yellow book.<br>
<br>Ramsay Muir was impressive and dignified in appearance, and possessed a mellifluous, resonant voice. He was in great demand and much admired as a public speaker, and during his brief parliamentary tenure was respected by colleagues and journalists for his debating skill. He became renowned for his proficiency in digesting and simplifying complex data, in both speech and writing&#151;although he had a weakness for polysyllabic words. He avoided rancour and never belittled opponents. His habitual manner of grave courtesy was relieved by quiet humour and the ability to laugh at his own foibles. Muir's charming eccentricities&#151;as well as his generosity, modesty, sincerity, and idealism&#151;endeared him to many.<br>
