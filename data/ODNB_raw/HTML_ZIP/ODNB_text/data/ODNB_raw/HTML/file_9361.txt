<span class="headword">Ferrers,  Henry  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1093<span class="mult">x</span>1100), <span class="occ">magnate and administrator</span>, was the eldest son of Walkeline de Ferrers (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1040), and inherited his father's Norman patrimony, centred on Ferri&egrave;res-St Hilaire. It is not known whether Henry de Ferrers fought at Hastings; although it is impossible to arrive at precise dates, he may have begun to acquire lands in England as early as 1066&#150;7. The pattern of Ferrers's tenure by 1086, as revealed in <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>, resulted from grants both from the personal holdings of Anglo-Saxon thegns and of old Anglo-Saxon administrative units. Serving William I, perhaps first as castellan of Stafford, Ferrers received the lands of three Anglo-Saxon antecessors. Probably about 1066 or 1067 he was granted the lands in Berkshire and Wiltshire of Goderic, former sheriff of Berkshire. By about the end of 1068 he also held the lands of Bondi the Staller in Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Northamptonshire, and Essex. Following the dispossession of Siward Barn for his part in the 1071 revolt, Ferrers acquired his substantial estates, comprising lands in Berkshire, Essex, Gloucestershire, and Warwickshire and also in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. The latter in particular complemented Ferrers's major territorial acquisition of Appletree wapentake, which stretched from eastern Staffordshire across most of south Derbyshire, and which he probably received in the wake of William I's defeat of the rebellion in the north in 1070&#150;71. It was centred on Tutbury, Staffordshire, previously held by the new earl of Chester, Hugh d'Avranches. This large and compact estate was supplemented by lands in north Derbyshire and western Leicestershire.<br>
<br>It was two manors from Appletree wapentake which formed Ferrers's original endowment of Tutbury Priory, which he founded with his wife, Bertha, in (probably) 1080. Mid-twelfth-century evidence indicates that from its foundation Tutbury was a dependency of the Norman abbey of St Pierre-sur-Dives. As a key administrator in Derbyshire and Staffordshire, Ferrers appears regularly as a witness to the extant <i>acta</i> of the Conqueror and William Rufus. His particular prominence in English <i>acta</i> confirms his place among the most powerful Anglo-Norman magnates. In 1086 he was a <i>legatus</i> (&#145;commissioner&#146;) on the west midland circuit of the Domesday survey.<br>
<br>Henry de Ferrers had four children with Bertha. The eldest is likely to have been William, who inherited the family's Norman estates and was a firm supporter of Duke Robert Curthose. Engenulph did not long outlive his father and Ferrers's English lands passed to his third son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9365/', "Robert de Ferrers (d. 1139)")</script>, whom King Stephen later made an earl. A daughter, Amicia, married Nigel d'Aubigny, probably the brother of Henry I's butler. Ferrers was still alive in September 1093, when he was among the addressees of a royal charter, but had almost certainly died by 14 September 1100 when Engenulph attested an early charter of Henry I; he was buried in Tutbury Priory.<br>
