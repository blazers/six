<span class="headword">Towneley,  Christopher</span>  (1604&#150;1674), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, the third surviving son of Richard Towneley (1566&#150;1628) of Towneley Hall, Lancashire, and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1634), daughter of Ralph Ashton of Great Lever in the same county, was born at Towneley on 9 January 1604. As the family was Roman Catholic, his education was probably provided privately; he may also have gone abroad for the purpose, as his elder brother did. The statement in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> that he became &#145;an attorney, but probably did not long follow his profession &hellip; disabled by being a recusant&#146; derives from the nineteenth-century local historian F. R. Raines, who did not note his sources  (Raines, <span class="italic">Journal of Nicholas Assheton</span>, 26&#150;7n.).<br>
<br>After his father's death in 1628 Towneley probably lived with his mother at Hapton, helping her to run her estates, until her death in 1634; an inventory of her goods assigns his name to a chamber there, and notes that he owed his mother over &pound;60. He was one of her executors. He then lived at Moor Isles, about 4 miles north of Towneley, until his marriage towards the end of 1640 (or early in 1641). His wife was Alice (<i>bap</i>. 1593), daughter of John Bradyll of Portfield, Whalley; she was Towneley's second cousin on his mother's side, and the widow of his distant relation Richard Towneley of Barnside and Carr. In 1644 Towneley is again described as of Hapton, but soon afterwards he and his wife moved to Carr Hall, south-west of Colne, where they lived until her death (which is said to have occurred in 1657). He then returned to Moor Isles.<br>
<br>In the civil war Towneley's brother Charles died in the royalist cause &#145;at the battle of Hesom Moor, at the raising of the siege of York, 2 or 3 August 1644&#146;  (Whitaker, 2.190). Christopher also fought (Webster says he was captured at Marston Moor) and the estates of both were sequestered, with respectively a third and a fifth of the annual profits allowed for the support of their families. Alice's receipt of &pound;80 indicates that Towneley was reckoned to enjoy an annual income of &pound;400. He petitioned to compound on 30 April 1646, but was listed among &#145;imperfect cases&#146; when his petition could not be found. Family property in Lincolnshire and Lancashire was subsequently declared forfeit and sold, but Towneley Hall was preserved; Towneley seems to have had charge of it as a trustee for his nephew Richard until the latter came of age in 1649. In 1650 Towneley was in the Upper Bench prison, presumably as a royalist.<br>
<br>Towneley is remembered for two of his intellectual interests: the encouragement of astronomy and the collection of documentary evidence for local history. Both these pursuits were aided by resident amanuenses. The young Jeremy Shakerley lived at Carr Hall in the late 1640s and complained that, in return for his work, &#145;meat and drinke is all I can expect&#146;; one of his letters to William Lilly also records that Towneley was committed to a highly mathematized astrology, &#145;loves Calculations well, and &hellip; will scarcely so much as erect a figure (though about any trivial occasion) without his Diagrams and Logarithms&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 423, fol. 121<i>r</i>). An unfinished list of Towneley's books compiled between 1647 and 1649 confirms his interest in mathematics, astronomy, and astrology; the same volume also contains medical notes. The benefits of access to the books were acknowledged by Jonas Moore in the preface to one of his treatises, which said the content was translated from an original supplied by &#145;Mr Christopher Towneley of Carr (a great promoter of Arts and lover of all Ingenuity and ingenuous men&#146;, who had given &#145;not onely the use of his Library, but Copies of such Mathematical Manuscripts as he had by him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Conical Sections</span>, appended to <span class="italic">Moor's Arithmetick</span>, 2nd edn, 1660).<br>
<br>A later account in Edward Sherburne's historical catalogue of astronomers makes Towneley the pivotal figure linking Jeremy Horrocks, William Crabtree, William Gascoigne, and William Milburne:<blockquote>happily brought to the Acquaintance of one another by the means of Christopher Townley of Carr in Lancashire Esquire, who stuck not for any cost or labour to promote as well Astronomical as other Mathematical Studies by a diligent Correspondence kept and maintained with the learned Professors in those Sciences; upon which account he was very dear to All the Four; and for which Reason, as for the Particular Respect I owe him, he merits to be named in this Catalogue. (Sherburne, 92&#150;3)</blockquote>Sherburne was a biased witness, but his claims were not without foundation. Towneley certainly helped to make the astronomical work of some of this group known, as Flamsteed later recalled: &#145;after all their deaths Mr Christopher Towneley of the Car in Lancashire and Sir Jonas More went to Mr Crabtree's house where his Widdow gave them all his papers these they secured and afterwards sorted&#146;  (CUL, RGO 1/65A, fol. 112<i>v</i>). Letters passed on to Richard Towneley included the final version of Horrocks's lunar theory, which Flamsteed eventually published in Horrocks's <span class="italic">Opera posthuma</span> (1673).<br>
<br>Towneley's passion for collecting documentary evidence found its main expression in antiquarian studies. He assembled material for a history of Lancashire in collaboration with Dr Richard Kuerden, who reported about the end of 1659: &#145;We muster our Antiquityes or paper forces (I mean Mr T. and myself) very neare an Hundred Thousand strong, in transcript&#146;  (Ormerod, 8). No publication resulted, but Towneley shared information with other antiquaries, particularly Roger Dodsworth and William Dugdale; he was also a friend of John Hopkinson of Lofthouse, Yorkshire. The collection he built up has been much used by later local historians, especially Thomas Whitaker, who dubbed Towneley &#145;the indefatigable transcriber&#146;. It was dispersed on the sale of the Towneley library in 1883, and is now divided between Chetham's Library, Manchester Central Library (the Farrar collection), and the British Library.<br>
<br>Towneley died at Moor Isles in August 1674 and was buried at Burnley on 30 August 1674. An inventory of his goods survives; his manuscripts were valued at 40<i>s</i>. (the figure of 11<i>s</i>. in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> derives from a misreading), a further 80<i>s</i>. was included for printed books, &pound;3 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. for a clock, and 10<i>s</i>. for surveying instruments.<br>
