<span class="headword">Ramsay,  William</span>, first earl of Dalhousie  (<em>d.</em> 1672), <span class="occ">politician and army officer</span>, was the eldest son of George Ramsay, first Lord Ramsay of Dalhousie (<i>d</i>. 1629) and Margaret Douglas, daughter and heir of George Douglas of Helenhill, brother of William, earl of Morton, and Robert, earl of Douglas. Ramsay's parents were married in 1593. Ramsay himself married in 1617 Margaret Carnegie (<i>d</i>. 1661), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4717/', "David Carnegie, first earl of Southesk")</script>. They had four sons and three daughters: George (the second earl), John, James, and William; Marjory, who married James Erskine, earl of Buchan; Anne, who married first John, earl of Dundee, and second Sir Henry Bruce of Clackmannan; and Magdalene, who died unmarried. After Margaret's death in April 1661 Ramsay married Jocosa (<i>d</i>. 1663), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/599/', "Sir Allen Apsley")</script> and widow of Lyster Blunt of Maple Durham.<br>
<br>Ramsay was chosen to represent the burgh of Montrose in the Scottish parliament in 1617 and 1621. On 21 July 1618 he obtained from the king a charter of the barony of Dalhousie and of the lands of Carrington, Edinburghshire. He succeeded his father as Lord Ramsay of Dalhousie in 1629, and on the occasion of the coronation of Charles I in Scotland was created earl of Dalhousie and Lord Ramsay and Carrington by patent dated 29 June 1633.<br>
<br>Dalhousie was among those of the commissioners appointed for the subscription of the king's covenant who were covenanters, and he subscribed the libel against the bishops presented the same year to the presbytery of Edinburgh. In late March 1639 he had a horse regiment from Edinburghshire, which went to secure the eastern borders with Balmerino's, Cranston's, Home's, and Lothian's cavalry regiments, and Sir Robert Munro's infantry regiment. He also signed the letter of the covenanting lords to the earl of Essex and served as colonel in the covenanting army which took up a position on the Duns Law to bar the progress of the king's army northwards. His regiment disbanded on 20 June.<br>
<br>In 1640 Dalhousie raised 800 foot from Lothian for a regiment in which his eldest son served as lieutenant-colonel. On 20 August 1640 Dalhousie's foot was part of the covenanting army which crossed the Tweed and invaded England. Dalhousie's unit brigaded with Lord Boyd's and Dundas of Dundas's infantry at Newcastle. It left England on 21 August 1641, disbanding six days later. At the parliament held in Edinburgh in November 1641 Dalhousie's name was inserted in a new list of privy councillors, to displace certain others chosen by the king. He served as president of parliament in 1641, 1644, and 1645. In the politics of the 1640s Dalhousie has been identified as one of the &#145;Royalist or pragmatic&#146; nobles among the covenanters  (Young, 62).<br>
<br>Dalhousie was engaged in the campaign in England in 1644, in command of a horse regiment levied from Berwickshire, Lothian, and Stirlingshire. Dalhousie's horse served at the siege of York and broke with the other allied cavalry regiments at Marston Moor, but rallied to assist the siege of Newcastle. He was called out of England with his regiment to proceed to the north of Scotland to aid Argyll against Montrose, but his son held the field command. The regiment saw active service in England and Scotland until August 1646 when it became a reserve force; it was disbanded on 9 February 1647. Montrose's second son, James, Lord Graham, who had been confined in Edinburgh Castle, was delivered over to Dalhousie to be educated.<br>
<br>On 24 October 1646 Dalhousie was appointed high sheriff of the county of Edinburgh (this was to be confirmed by parliament on 12 July 1661). On 4 May 1648 he was nominated colonel of horse for Edinburghshire, with his son as alternate colonel, for the engagement on behalf of Charles I. He did not accept the offices, but he did support the engagement, which he had been constrained to repudiate by 1 June 1649. In 1651 he or his heir was nominated by Charles II colonel for Edinburghshire but due to the English occupation they could not levy any men. For having sided with Charles II he was fined &pound;1500 on 12 April 1654, which was reduced to &pound;400 on 6 April 1655. Dalhousie died, &#145;a very old man&#146;, in November 1672  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>).<br>
