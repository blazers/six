<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Russell,  James Burn</span>  (1837&#150;1904), <span class="occ">medical officer of health</span>, was born on 5 May 1837 at 16 Robertson Street, Glasgow, the elder child of David Russell (1808&#150;1871), printer, and his wife, Agnes (1816&#150;1839), daughter of John Cassels, a grain merchant of the burgh of Calton (now part of Glasgow), and his wife, Jean Harvie. His mother died when he was aged two and his father emigrated to Australia several years later. Russell and his sister were brought up in Rutherglen, near Glasgow, in the home of their grandfather James Russell, Glasgow's first steamboat harbour-master and veteran of the battle of Waterloo.<br>
<br>Russell attended Glasgow high school before entering Glasgow University in 1854 and graduating BA in 1857. He showed literary flair, winning prizes for essays, writing verse, and teaching himself Anglo-Saxon. His natural philosophy teacher was Professor William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin), who recruited him as his assistant on his 1858 expedition to lay an Atlantic cable; they were nearly lost at sea during a storm of exceptional ferocity. On his return Russell enrolled in Glasgow University medical school, where his teachers included Joseph Lister. After graduating MD CM in 1862 he worked as a houseman at Glasgow Royal Infirmary and then as assistant medical officer of Glasgow poorhouse, with responsibility for the fever wards.<br>
<br>In 1865 Professor William Gairdner, who three years earlier had become the city's first medical officer of health, put Russell in charge of the city's first municipal fever hospital, and in 1870 he was given command also of the new Belvidere Fever Hospital. Russell's marriage to Helen Fenton Davidson (1842&#150;1884), daughter of the Revd Peter Davidson, minister of Queen Street United Presbyterian Church, Edinburgh, took place on 3 September 1868, and a son and two daughters were born in the 1870s; but soon afterwards his wife was committed to Glasgow Royal Asylum at Gartnavel, where she died in 1884.<br>
<br>It was as Glasgow's first full-time medical officer of health, from 1872 to 1898, that Russell made his greatest contributions to public health. He was selected from a field of forty-five candidates after the town council had decided to rescind Gairdner's part-time appointment and replace him with a full-time medical officer of health&#151;the first such appointment in Scotland. Russell faced a formidable task amid the squalor and overcrowding created by Glasgow's rapid industrial expansion. No other city in Britain had as high a proportion of one-room and two-room houses. However, by the time Russell left his post Glasgow was internationally renowned for its public health services; mortality had dropped from 29 to 21 per 1000 and was lower than that of Liverpool and Manchester. Deaths from tuberculosis and other respiratory diseases had declined more sharply than in the rest of Scotland and the city led the fight against childhood diseases.<br>
<br>Russell initially had no medical staff but worked through the sanitary inspectors, particularly the epidemic inspectors, widening the scope of their work. Taking a scientific approach he established a set of small-area health statistics unmatched in Britain, and propounded the law of occupancy, relating death rates to room density. He used his literary skills to overcome public apathy and ignorance, writing prolifically and becoming a moving public speaker, this despite a crippling shyness which made it difficult for him to speak even at committee meetings. In the 1880s his lectures, &#145;The Children of the City&#146; and &#145;Life in one room&#146;, prepared the way for reform by opening middle-class eyes to the realities of slum life. Russell worked closely with a group of enlightened town councillors on the health committee to initiate local legislation on public health and building standards, and he energetically enforced existing laws&#151;tracking down smallpox vaccination defaulters, warring with irresponsible landlords, pouncing on jobbing butchers who were selling suspect sausages, denouncing industrialists for polluting the environment, and pursuing the miscreants through the law courts with a regard to detail that made him almost invincible.<br>
<br>Russell's influence extended beyond the city. In a series of investigations which did much to establish the connection between enteric fever and infected milk he travelled by train and gig to inspect waterlogged farm steadings, and his memorandum on the sanitary requirements of dairy farms, issued in 1888, was widely circulated. His paper on tuberculosis, published in 1896, which typified Russell's broad, environmentally conscious approach to public health, received international recognition. In the 1890s Russell was a key figure in Glasgow's great age of municipal enterprise, which attracted civic delegations from the United States. Yet his outspokenness attracted controversy, and the strong statutory powers that he and the health committee wielded made them a target for criticism, particularly among opponents of sanitary reform.<br>
<br>In 1898 Russell resigned to become medical member of the Local Government Board for Scotland, where he rigorously enforced the provisions of the <span class="roman">Scottish Public Health Act</span> of 1897. Despite deteriorating health he remained at his post&#151;sometimes working from his bed&#151;until his death at a private hospital at 41 Drummond Place, Edinburgh, on 22 October 1904. Glasgow sanitary inspectors formed a guard of honour at the Glasgow necropolis on 26 October, following a funeral service held at Morningside Congregational Church, Edinburgh. A memorial service was held at Elgin Place Memorial Church, Glasgow, on 6 November.<br>
<br>Russell was a committed Congregationalist and, from 1886, an active Liberal Unionist. He was a president of the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow. In 1889 he received the first Bisset-Hawkins memorial medal of the Royal College of Physicians of London for zeal in promoting public health. He declined a knighthood. In addition to numerous contributions to the <span class="italic">Glasgow Medical Journal</span> (which he edited for several years) and the <span class="italic">Sanitary Journal</span>, he was the author of <span class="italic">The Evolution of the Function of Public Health Administration</span> (1895). A posthumous collection of his writing, <span class="italic">Public Health Administration in Glasgow</span>, edited by his successor as medical officer of health, A. K. Chalmers, was published in 1905.<br>
