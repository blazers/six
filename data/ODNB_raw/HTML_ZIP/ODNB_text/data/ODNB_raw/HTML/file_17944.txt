<span class="headword">Mann,  Gother</span>  (1747&#150;1830), <span class="occ">army officer and military engineer</span>, was born on 21 December 1747 at Plumstead, Kent, the second son of Cornelius Mann and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gother. His father, a first cousin of Sir Horace Mann (1701&#150;1786), went to the West Indies in 1760 and died at St Kitts on 9 December 1776. Gother was left in the care of his uncle, Mr Wilks of Faversham, Kent, and after passing through the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, was commissioned practitioner engineer and ensign on 27 February 1763. He was employed on the Sheerness and Medway defences until 1775, and promoted sub-engineer and lieutenant on 1 April 1771. On 1 March 1768, at St Nicholas's, Rochester, Kent, he married Ann, second daughter of Peter Wade of Rushford Manor, Eythorne, Kent, rector of Cooling, vicar of Boughton Monchelsea, and minor canon of Rochester Cathedral. They had five sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>In late 1775 Mann was sent to Dominica, West Indies. He was promoted engineer-extraordinary and captain-lieutenant on 2 March 1777. He commanded a militia detachment when the island was invaded by the French in September 1778. The little garrison resisted but were outnumbered, and surrendered on honourable terms. Mann was a prisoner of war for a few months, and on 19 August 1779 he was appointed to the engineer staff of Great Britain. He then reported on the east coast defences. In 1781 he accompanied Colonel Braham, the chief engineer, on an inspection of the north-east coast of England to assess coastal defences, as seven corporations had petitioned on the subject.<br>
<br>In 1785 Mann went to Quebec as commanding royal engineer in Canada. Promoted captain on 16 September, he was employed throughout the country on civil and military duties, planning against American invasion, erecting fortifications, improving ports, and laying out townships including Toronto and Sorel. In 1788 he reported to the governor, Guy Carleton, first Baron Dorchester, on military posts, harbours, and navigable river routes, showing the posts' faults and decline.<br>
<br>Mann returned to Britain in 1791, and in June 1793 he joined the duke of York's army in the United Provinces. He was present at the sieges of Valenciennes (which capitulated on 28 July) and Dunkirk (from 24 August to 9 September), and at the battle of Hondschoote or Menin (12&#150;15 September). He was promoted lieutenant-colonel on 5 December 1793. On his return to England in April 1794 he was briefly employed under the master-general of the ordnance in London, and then was again commanding royal engineer in Canada until 1804. Described by the colonial secretary, Lord Hobart, as &#145;an officer of so much merit and experience&#146;  (Kendall, 485), Mann reported on the St Lawrence canals and, understanding their commercial and military importance, proposed repairs and alterations. He also reported on the necessity of an adequate permanent defence system at Quebec, advocating more fortifications there, some of which were later constructed. From August 1801 until he left in 1804 he was the second most senior officer in Canada, and successfully requested brigadier's pay because of his additional duties. After his return to England he continued to be concerned with Canadian defence. His services in Canada were rewarded by a grant, on 22 July 1805, of 22,859 acres of land in the township of Acton in Lower Canada. Mann became colonel in the army on 26 January 1797, colonel in the Royal Engineers on 18 August 1797, and major-general on 25 September 1803. From 1805 until 1811 he was employed on particular services in Ireland and on various committees in London. On 13 July 1805 he was made a colonel-commandant of the corps of Royal Engineers; on 25 July 1810 he became lieutenant-general, and on 19 July 1821 general. From 23 July 1811 until his death he was inspector-general of fortifications. In February 1815, on behalf of officers of the Royal Engineers, he protested to the earl of Mulgrave, master-general of the ordnance, at the paucity of honours awarded to them at the end of the war, alleging it cast a stigma on the honour and reputation of the corps. To the inspector-general's responsibilities were added in 1822, at Wellington's instigation, the construction and maintenance of barracks in the United Kingdom. Mann was offered a baronetcy, but declined it as he lacked the financial resources to support it. He was appointed president of the committee to examine cadets for commissions on 19 May 1828. He died on 27 March 1830 at Lewisham, Kent, and was buried in the churchyard at Plumstead, Kent.<br>
<br>Of Mann's sons, Gother served in the artillery, Cornelius in the engineers, John in the 28th regiment, and Frederick William in the marines and later in the staff corps. Cornelius's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17949/', "William Mann (1817&#150;1873)")</script> was an astronomer. Plans by Gother Mann are in the British Library and Canadian archives.<br>
