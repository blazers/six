<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Casson,  Elizabeth</span>  (1881&#150;1954), <span class="occ">medical practitioner</span>, was born at Cae Derwen, Denbigh, on 14 April 1881, the sixth of seven children of Thomas Casson (1843&#150;1911), bank manager, and his wife, Laura Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thomas (1843&#150;1912). The actor and theatre director <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55524/', "Sir Lewis Thomas Casson")</script> was her brother. Despite growing up in nonconformist Wales she was raised an Anglican and this deep faith was formative throughout her personal and working life. Her childhood and teenage years were spent in a particularly musical and artistic family and, although refusing to learn an instrument herself, she took pleasure in drawing, acting, painting, and singing.<br>
<br>When the family moved to London, Casson was educated at St Mary's College in Paddington. She reluctantly attended secretarial college in London, afterwards working as secretary to her father, who had started a business building organs. After his retirement, she took employment as a housing manager and worked for the social reformer Octavia Hill between 1908 and 1913. As part of this work she was secretary of a community hall at Southwark (Red Cross Hall). She organized recreational activities for residents in the hall, which was designed with creative pursuits in mind. It had a concert hall, and walls were covered in murals by the artist Walter Crane. Her later work in occupational therapy, and her interest in art-based activities, was deeply influenced by this time with Octavia Hill, whose own interest in arts and crafts had been shaped by her friendship and working relationship with John Ruskin.<br>
<br>Casson's uncle, Sir Isambard Owen, was then vice-chancellor of the University of Bristol and promised her a place on a medical course if she matriculated. At the age of thirty Casson made her career change. After struggling for two years to pass her Latin exams, she matriculated in London and registered at the University of Bristol on 1 October 1913. She lived in Hereford House, Clifton, while working to gain her medical degree. She graduated MB in 1919. She proceeded to her MD in 1926, becoming the first female doctor of medicine to graduate from the University of Bristol.<br>
<br>After qualifying in 1919 Casson took up a resident appointment at the West Herts Hospital in Hemel Hempstead. However, she only held the position for a year and apparently found it difficult to adjust to the atmosphere of &#145;bored idleness&#146; in the hospital  (Oxford Brookes Special Collections (OBSC) DH/3/1/1.34). The turning point came one day close to Christmas, when Casson arrived at work and found an entirely different atmosphere in the women's wards. She noted that &#145;the patients were working happily in groups making flowers and leaves and using all their artistic talents with real interest and pleasure. I knew from that moment that such occupation was an integral part of treatment and must be provided&#146;  (OBSC DH/3/13, 34).<br>
<br>In 1921 Casson took up a new appointment as medical officer at the Royal Holloway Sanatorium at Virginia Water, where the process of therapy had long involved some voluntary artistic and occupational activities. As she built on her work with Hill her interest in the nascent health care discipline of occupational therapy began to grow. She described hearing the psychiatrist Sir David Henderson speak of an occupational therapy programme in Scotland as her &#145;first real introduction&#146; to the subject, an interest that grew when she visited an occupational therapy department in New York's Bloomingdale Hospital in 1926  (OBSC DH/3/1/1.34). During this period Casson consolidated her professional status by qualifying for the diploma in psychological medicine from the University of London in 1922, and winning the Gaskell prize (1927) of the Royal Medico-Psychological Association.<br>
<br>Within a few years Casson had become determined to open her own facility for treatment by and the teaching of occupational therapy. A simple cable exchange between Casson and her brother Lewis secured the funds that she required: &#145;Can you lend me a thousand pounds?&#146; &#145;Yes&#146;  (OBSC DH/3/13, vii). In 1929 she founded Dorset House as a residential clinic for women with mental disorders in Clifton, Bristol. A year later, she launched the first UK school of occupational therapy at the same location, with Casson as medical director and Constance Tebbitt as principal. Dorset House continued to operate as both an educational and a therapeutic facility, as students often worked with Casson's own patients.<br>
<br>Casson pursued a vision of a therapeutic &#145;community where every individual was encouraged to feel that she had a real object&#146;  (OBSC DH/3/1/1.35). This approach not only drew upon Hill's community ethos, but also anticipated the post-war &#145;therapeutic community&#146; movement. Within the school she led occupational and artistic therapies that were initially for the promotion of psychological wellbeing. Activities included dance, drama, and countryside excursions. Drawing upon her own creative childhood, Casson cast herself in Dorset House's annual drama production; in 1934, she played Mr Collins in <span class="italic">Pride and Prejudice</span>.<br>
<br>Casson's work in Bristol was not limited to the developments at Dorset House. In 1936, six years after she first offered to provide occupational therapy free of charge, the Health Committee at Southmead Hospital in north Bristol gave Casson a six-month trial. After the success of this trial, she was appointed as an honorary consultant in occupational therapy on half salary, and later full salary.<br>
<br>Although Casson's work in Bristol was pioneering in many ways, it was not an isolated example. Over the course of the 1930s occupational therapy was increasingly recognized as an important health care discipline. The inaugural meetings of the Scottish Association of Occupational Therapy and the UK Association of Occupational Therapy were held in 1932 and 1935 respectively. The Second World War also created a particular impetus for the development of the physical aspects of occupational therapy, a trend that was reflected in Casson's work but not necessarily driven by it. In 1939 Casson set up the Allendale Curative Workshop in Bristol, where craft activities were used to help treat orthopaedic injuries and fractures.<br>
<br>The original Dorset House school and treatment facility grew in size, with about 800 patients resident over the period 1929&#150;41. It relocated during the Second World War to Bromsgrove. War damage to the Bristol premises prevented a return there, and in 1946 the Dorset House School of Occupational Therapy relocated to Oxford. Casson moved her patients to St Margaret's in Clevedon, Somerset, which she personally subsidized to maintain low rates for those requiring treatment. In 1948 the school was taken over by a limited non-profit making company but Casson maintained involvement as vice-chairman and medical director. A year later she created the Elizabeth Casson Trust for the purposes of continuing education and treatment in occupational therapy, of which Dorset House school was the primary beneficiary.<br>
<br>In her personal life Casson was known as both characteristically determined and fun-loving. Younger relatives viewed Casson as holding a &#145;patriarchal&#146; role in the family and as being intensely passionate about her work. Her nephew, who recalled &#145;Aunt Elsie's&#146; unique dress sense and strong personality, described her as &#145;a real eccentric in that she saw herself as normal and other people as somewhat eccentric&#146;, while possessing &#145;infectious enthusiasm for whatever she was engaged in&#146; and &#145;deep Christian beliefs&#146;  (John Casson, OBSC DH/3/13, vii). Her kindness extended to family, students, patients, and to a beloved Welsh terrier named Bran.<br>
<br>Casson was awarded an OBE in 1951 for her work at Dorset House, the same year that she was elected an honorary fellow of the World Federation of Occupational Therapists. After a short period of failing health from obscure anaemia she died on 17 December 1954 at St Mary's Private Hospital, Bristol. Her body was buried at Backwell churchyard, Somerset, overlooking the Welsh mountains. Since 1973 the College of Occupational Therapists has hosted a prestigious Dr Elizabeth Casson memorial lecture.<br>
