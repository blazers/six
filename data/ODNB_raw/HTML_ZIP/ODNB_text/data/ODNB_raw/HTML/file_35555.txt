<span class="headword">Pole, Sir  Felix John Clewett</span>  (1877&#150;1956), <span class="occ">railway manager and industrialist</span>, was born at Little Bedwyn, Wiltshire, on 1 February 1877, the second son of Edward Robert Pole, the local schoolmaster and an active churchman, and his wife, Emma, the youngest daughter of Charles Clewett of Wincanton, Somerset. He attended school in the villages of Little Bedwyn and Ramsbury.<br>
<br>At the age of fourteen, upon the nomination of Walter Hume Long, MP for North Wiltshire and later a director of the Great Western Railway (GWR), Pole joined the GWR as a telegraph lad clerk. After two years he was promoted to the company's headquarters at Paddington in London, where he served in the offices of the telegraph superintendent, chief engineer, and (from 1904) general manager. In 1899 Pole married Ethel Maud (<i>d</i>. 1966), the daughter of Horace Flack, a shoemaker in the West End of London; they had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>The general manager's office was a promising department for a man who was not qualified in technical subjects and who had a flair for verbal and written communication and negotiation. Pole edited and revived the moribund staff magazine (<span class="italic">Great Western Magazine</span>) and became deeply involved from 1909 in the work of the conciliation boards. His abilities brought him rapid promotion. He was made head of the staff and labour department in the general manager's office in 1912 and in June of the following year was appointed chief clerk, a position he retained until 1919. He was rejected for military service in the First World War owing to poor eyesight. By March 1919 he was assistant to the general manager, then in the following August, after the death of the general manager (Frank Potter), he became assistant general manager to Charles Aldington. Aldington's ill health provided Pole with many opportunities to show his abilities. When Aldington was forced to retire Pole succeeded him in June 1921, at the age of forty-four, at &pound;6000 a year.<br>
<br>Two major tasks confronted Pole: to weld together the thirty-three companies which, under the <span class="roman">Railways Act</span> of 1921, were now to form the enlarged GWR and to restore financial stability after wartime government control. The first was relatively straightforward because of the much greater size of the GWR compared with the other merging companies. In a number of cases the GWR already had financial and operational links and similar organizational structures and practices. However, Pole's skilful reconciliation of differing traditions and personalities helped to minimize friction and delay. The second he sought to accomplish through firmer control of departmental expenditure, with fixed targets, more intensive use of rolling stock, and a drive for increased traffic. Good customer relations and publicity were also given high priority. He frequently addressed chambers of commerce, rotary clubs, and civic functions.<br>
<br>Receptive to new ideas, Pole pursued an imaginative, progressive policy, supported by his board. Strengthening of track and bridges enabled the most powerful (King class) locomotives in the country to be designed to haul heavier, high-speed trains. However, he largely failed in his efforts to persuade the industrialists and coalowners of south Wales to adopt larger capacity wagons. Fundamental to all of these initiatives was Pole's attempt to reform, with some success, the existing administrative arrangements, so that his office would have more control over major decisions and expenditure and there would be better co-ordination between departments. During his general managership there were substantial fluctuations in profitability. However, in Pole's last full year with the GWR (1928) the returns on revenue and capital, and the level of dividends, showed an improvement over the position he had inherited in 1921, despite the depressive effect on revenues of the ailing south Wales coal industry.<br>
<br>Pole's understanding of the importance of good human relations was evident in his efforts through the <span class="italic">Great Western Magazine</span>, official meetings, and staff functions to foster a sense of &#145;family&#146; among all ranks and to reinforce this through the attention which, for example, was given to reducing the accident rate among employees and the establishment of housing schemes. However, although he accepted the legitimacy of trade unions in normal negotiations, he was a firm negotiator. During the general strike (May 1926), when he was chairman of the railway General Managers' Conference, his energetic and resourceful action helped to break the strike. He regarded the strike as a &#145;deep conspiracy against the state&#146;  (<span class="italic">Great Western Magazine</span>, 38, June 1926, 215) and as a betrayal of the corporate paternalism which he had advocated throughout his career. Returning workers were dealt with severely by the company.<br>
<br>When he left the GWR to become the executive chairman of Associated Electrical Industries Ltd (AEI) in July 1929, Pole was earning &pound;8000 a year. He received a gratuity of &pound;5000 and a pension of &pound;1000. His new salary was &pound;10,000. He was retained by the GWR as a consultant but not, to his regret, as a director. However, he maintained some of his transport interests: in 1931 he revisited the Sudan and visited Egypt and Palestine to advise on railway policy and development; in 1933 he became a director of Airports Ltd; in 1934 he reported to the Northern Ireland government on transport conditions in the province (advocating co-ordination); and he was chairman (1936&#150;45) of the government's Central Housing Advisory Committee on private enterprise housing.<br>
<br>AEI was a newly formed group of companies (British Thomson-Houston, Ferguson Pailin, Edison Swan, Metropolitan-Vickers, and others), the second largest electrical group in the country in the late 1920s. The group was a full-line producer and innovator of electrical goods. Pole's first task was the integration of these large undertakings, with their conflicting traditions, practices, and capital structures. Initially he pursued a policy, supported by the group's American parent, of retaining autonomous units, with central direction through an executive committee of the holding company's board and inter-company committees. Pole sought to kindle a sense of identity within the group but the recession of the early 1930s revived old rivalries, delaying the co-ordination of manufacturing and marketing activities. However, a start was made by combining British and American interests in Australia, establishing AEI (India) Ltd, and concentrating the manufacture of electric motors, traction equipment, lamps, and so on. By frequent consultation with the key managers, Pole won their co-operation. Staff welfare was improved and a pension scheme was introduced. The group's involvement in national and international rings (which led Pole to travel very widely), the revival of the home market, and the group's improved efficiency and record of product innovation led to good profits from the mid-1930s.<br>
<br>Disillusioned with <i>laissez-faire</i>, Pole came to believe in planned capitalism based on large competing firms, joining the executive committee of Harold Macmillan's Industrial Reorganisation League in 1934. AEI benefited from the rearmament boom and made a large contribution to the war effort of 1939&#150;45. The Trafford Park works, Manchester, materially assisted in winning the battle of Britain by producing radar.<br>
<br>Pole resigned the chairmanship in 1945, owing to blindness, but remained a director to 1955. He mastered braille and continued many former activities, including the chairmanship of the <span class="italic">Reading Standard</span> and his lifetime pastimes&#151;fishing and natural history. Like his father he was a conscientious Anglican. He had been knighted in 1924 in Stanley Baldwin's dissolution list (Baldwin had been a GWR director, 1908&#150;18). Selected for the office of high sheriff of Berkshire in 1947, he renounced the honour because of his disability. Pole died at 16 Bath Road, Reading, on 15 January 1956.<br>
