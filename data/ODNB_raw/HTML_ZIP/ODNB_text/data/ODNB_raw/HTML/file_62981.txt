<span class="headword">Malcolm,  John, of Poltalloch</span>  (1805&#150;1893), <span class="occ">art collector and landowner</span>, was the second surviving son of Neill Malcolm (<i>d</i>. 1837), twelfth laird of Poltalloch, who owned extensive landed estates in Argyll and sugar plantations in Jamaica, and his wife, Mary Anne (<i>d</i>. 1830), daughter and sole heiress of Dr David Orme, the noted physician of London and of the Lamorbey estate, near Sidcup, Kent. He was brought up in the family's London home in Hanover Square and at Lamorbey. Educated at Harrow School (1819/20 to 1823), he matriculated on 6 February 1824 at Christ Church, Oxford, and graduated BA in 1827 and MA in 1830. He studied at Lincoln's Inn in 1829 but was not called to the bar. In 1832 he married Isabella Harriett (<i>d</i>. 1858), daughter of the Hon. John Wingfield Stratford, with whom he had three sons, John (<i>b</i>. 1833), Edward, and William (<i>b</i>. 1840), and a daughter, Isabella. During their early married life they lived at the village of Hunton, near Lamorbey, where Malcolm served as a justice of the peace and deputy lieutenant for Kent; later he served likewise for Argyll.<br>
<br>In 1857 Malcolm succeeded as fourteenth laird of Poltalloch on the death of his elder brother, Neill. He inherited the Poltalloch seat&#151;a vast, uncomfortable mansion near Lochgilphead, Argyll&#151;and also the family's grand London town house at 7 Great Stanhope Street off Park Lane. In the following year Malcolm's wife died. In addition to his inherited estates in Scotland and the profitable sugar and rum plantations in the West Indies, Malcolm ran, as an absentee landlord, a highly successful cattle station named Poltalloch which he had established with his brother Neill in the young colony of South Australia in 1839 and to which he imported the finest breeds of cattle from Scotland. In June 1873 Malcolm sold this and another cattle station, with 4000 head of livestock, for the prodigious sum of &pound;175,000.<br>
<br>It was Malcolm's enormous wealth that enabled him to become one of the leading collectors of his day. In 1860 he purchased <i>en bloc</i> the remarkable collection of Renaissance drawings formed by the great connoisseur J. C. Robinson, then superintendent of the art collections of the South Kensington Museum, later the Victoria and Albert Museum. The great strengths of this core collection of some 554 sheets were the works of Italian Renaissance masters, including thirteen drawings attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, twenty-three to Michelangelo, and thirteen to Raphael, many of which had been acquired by Robinson from the London dealers Messrs Woodburn, who had bought the famous collection of Sir Thomas Lawrence. On Robinson's advice Malcolm continued to add to his collection; the large Michelangelo cartoon <span class="italic">Epifania</span> (BM) was purchased at the Woodburn sale of June 1860 for the ridiculously low sum of &pound;11 0<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., with Robinson acting as his buyer. In March 1866 on Robinson's advice he purchased 135 lots, mostly of seventeenth-century Dutch drawings, at the Leembruggen sale in Amsterdam, and later that year Malcolm bought eighty-three lots, including twenty-four Claude drawings, at the posthumous sale of the Oxford divine Dr Wellesley. By 1866 Malcolm's collection had grown to some 708 old-master drawings. In 1869 Robinson published his <span class="italic">Descriptive catalogue of the drawings by the old masters, forming the collection of John Malcolm of Poltalloch, esq.</span>, in which he outlined the principles guiding the formation of Malcolm's collection, which by then numbered 870 drawings: to collect genuine specimens of the highest aesthetic quality, by the greatest masters, and with a distinguished provenance. These criteria defined Malcolm as belonging to a new breed of connoisseur whose highly disciplined and selective approach differed from the often indiscriminate accumulations of earlier collectors of drawings.<br>
<br>Malcolm's connoisseurship as a collector was largely formed by his involvement initially with the Fine Arts Club, on his election in 1862, and more importantly its successor, the Burlington Fine Arts Club (BFAC), of which he was a founding member in 1866. His close and lifelong friendship with the collector William Mitchell, dating from the early 1860s, was also significant. Sidney Colvin, keeper of the British Museum's print room, later recalled that Malcolm's &#145;passion as a collector [was] to a large extent stimulated as well as directed by an inseparable <i>fidus Achates</i> in the person of a bachelor friend &hellip; William Mitchell&#146;  (Colvin, <span class="italic">Memories</span>, 207). The pair were involved with the inner running of the BFAC, lent regularly to its shows, worked together in building up their complementary collections, and were a familiar sight at the salerooms in London and on the continent. By 1870 Malcolm's position as Britain's most important collector of old-master drawings was confirmed by his loan of twenty-three Raphaels and seventeen Michelangelos to an ambitious exhibition of drawings by these two artists at the BFAC, with the Royal Collection as the second largest lender. Malcolm also formed an important collection of old-master prints as well as a very fine group of Venetian Renaissance glass, Limoges enamels, a famous St Porchaire faience <i>biberon</i>, and other distinguished <i>objets d'art</i>.<br>
<br>On 30 May 1893 Malcolm died at Poltalloch House, and he was buried under the terms of his will (2 May 1888) in the family vault of the Episcopalian chapel at Poltalloch next to his &#145;dear wife&#146;. The obituary in the <span class="italic">Oban Times</span> (3 June 1893, 5) described Malcolm as &#145;a model landlord&#146; noted for &#145;the consideration shown towards his numerous tenants&#146;. His eldest son, John Wingfield Malcolm, succeeded to the title and his estates; Malcolm bequeathed to him the sum of &pound;100,000 and his collection of old-master drawings and prints.<br>
<br>A few days before he died Malcolm presented the famous <span class="roman">Sforza Book of Hours</span> to the British Museum's department of manuscripts (now in the British Library); this is one of the world's finest Italian Renaissance illuminated manuscripts, which J. C. Robinson had purchased in Spain in 1871 and then sold to Malcolm after his initial offer to the British Museum had failed. Less than a month after Malcolm's death his heir donated the Michelangelo cartoon to the British Museum and placed Malcolm's collection of almost 1000 drawings and more than 400 prints on deposit in the print room. Determined that the Malcolm collection should not suffer the same fate as the Thomas Lawrence collection, which had been dispersed following the Treasury's refusal to acquire it for the nation, the keeper Colvin revealed the richness of Malcolm's collection in a loan exhibition at the British Museum in March 1894. With the support of Mitchell, who in January 1895 had presented his unrivalled collection of German woodcuts to the print room, Colvin negotiated to purchase from the heir the Malcolm collection for the nation for the sum of &pound;25,000. In his report to the trustees Colvin argued that the Malcolm collection of drawings &#145;has long been celebrated &hellip; as the richest that has ever been brought together in England since the dispersal of the Lawrence collections&#146;. Following the trustees' successful application to the Treasury, this single acquisition in September 1895 raised the museum's holding of old-master drawings to a level comparable with the celebrated collections of the Louvre, Paris, and the Albertina, Vienna.<br>
