<span class="headword">Spence,  Peter</span>  (1806&#150;1883), <span class="occ">industrial chemist and alum manufacturer</span>, was born on 19 February 1806 in Brechin, Forfarshire, Scotland, the younger son of a hand-loom weaver of Brechin, and his wife, whose family had been farmers for generations. Spence was educated at the parish school in Brechin, but began his working life very early, apprenticed to a grocer, an uncle, in Perth. After finishing his apprenticeship he set up a business with this uncle, but it failed.<br>
<br>In 1832 Spence married Agnes (<i>d</i>. 1883), second daughter of Francis Mudie, linen manufacturer, of Dundee. They had four sons and four daughters. In the same year he joined a gasworks in Dundee, where he acquired a good knowledge of practical chemistry and patented minor innovations in manufacture (for example, of Prussian blue). In 1834 he set up on his own in London as a general chemical manufacturer. He did not prosper, and moved to Burgh by Sands, near Carlisle. There his fortune changed after his discovery in 1845, after much experimentation, of a new and rapid method of making alum from coal shale (colliery refuse) and the ammoniacal liquor by-product of gasworks. Alum, an outstanding mordant, was an essential chemical for the printing and dyeing of textiles and was also used in the treatment of sewage and in paper manufacture. In 1846 he moved his main manufacture to Pendleton, near Manchester, and became the principal supplier of this important substance. He opened a second factory in Gode in 1854. His ammonium alum gradually displaced the potash alum which had been made principally at Whitby. Spence was awarded a medal for his process at the exhibition of 1862. In the 1860s he had become interested in copper smelting, and in 1866 he set up a company in Gode to develop his ideas. He was forced to sell this in the 1870s, after the failure in Redonda, in the West Indies, of his company formed to mine phosphate deposits and convert them to fertilizers.<br>
<br>As a staunch Congregationalist Spence was active in social reform, notably in promoting total abstinence. He also campaigned against pollution but suffered the irony of being prosecuted himself for pollution in 1857, which caused him to move his works to Miles Platting. He never forgave the chemist Edward Frankland, who had been a colleague, for appearing for the prosecution. He was an active member of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, his papers to it showing a wide range of interests. Spence died at his home, Erlington House, Whalley Range, Manchester, on 7 July 1883.<br>
