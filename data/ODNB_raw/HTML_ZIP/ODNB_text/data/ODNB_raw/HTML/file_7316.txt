<span class="headword">Davy,  John</span>  (1763&#150;1824), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born at Creedy Bridge, Upton Hellions, near Crediton, Devon, the illegitimate son of Sarah Davie or Davy, on 23 December 1763. He was brought up by his maternal uncle, a blacksmith of Upton Hellions, who played the cello in the church band. When under the age of five Davy could play simple tunes on the fife after one or two hearings. Before he was six, he stole some horseshoes from a neighbouring smith and devised a set of chimes on which he imitated the bells of Crediton church. On hearing of this, the rector, James Carrington, showed him a harpsichord, which he soon learned to play, and he also began the violin. Carrington recommended him to the Revd Richard Eastcott, of Exeter, who gave him piano lessons and persuaded his friends to article him, by the age of twelve, to William Jackson, organist of Exeter Cathedral. Davy's progress in composition was rapid, and he soon became a competent performer on the organ, violin, viola, and cello. After completing his articles he lived for some years in Exeter as an organist and teacher.<br>
<br>A passion for the stage, which led him to act with William Dowton at the local theatre, caused Davy to move to London, where he played the violin at Covent Garden. About 1790 he had published a set of glees as his op. 1, but theatres were slow to encourage his real gift, which was for instrumental music. He wrote two stage pieces for Sadler's Wells, though success did not come until 1800 with <span class="italic">What a Blunder!</span> for the Little Theatre, Haymarket. He spent most of his career collaborating with various indifferent theatre composers and contributing songs and numbers to their works and to pasticcios for Covent Garden. A number of his songs were very popular in their day, and he also wrote some successful harp music. But he became depressed, his work deteriorated, and he took to drink. He died, impoverished, in May's Buildings, St Martin's Lane, London, on 22 February 1824, and was buried in the churchyard of St Martin-in-the-Fields on the 28th at the expense of two London tradesmen, one a native of Crediton.<br>
