<span class="headword">Coborn,  Charles</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Colin Whitton McCallum]</span>  (1852&#150;1945), <span class="occ">music-hall entertainer and songwriter</span>, was born Colin Whitton McCallum on 4 August 1852 at 25 Sydney Square, Mile End, London, the son of Colin McCallum (1799&#150;1872), shipbroker and freeman of the City of London, and his wife, Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whitton, a district visitor, the daughter of a customs officer at Wapping. Educated privately, he had a series of clerical jobs in the City (1866&#150;71) and was later a commercial traveller in briar pipes, artificial hair, and women's fur collars. An early talent for impersonating a drunken man led to his first salaried engagement as a twice-weekly music-hall artist (1872) at the Alhambra, north Greenwich. Originally appearing under the stage name Charles Laurie, he changed it to Coborn, after Coborn Road, Poplar. In 1875 came his first full week's engagement, at the Gilbert Music-Hall, Whitechapel (where Whitechapel underground station was later built), as well as his first performance outside London, at the Oxford, Gravesend, and his first pantomime, at Sandgate, Kent. He toured the midlands, the north of England, Scotland, and Ireland (1877&#150;8), and first appeared on the regular West End variety stage (29 September 1879) at the Middlesex, Drury Lane, followed (20 October) by a six-month engagement at the Oxford, where the manager, J. H. Jennings, billed him as &#145;The Comic of the Day&#146;. He married (26 January 1882) Ellen Stockley of Dublin; they had four sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Coborn was an active campaigner for improved working conditions in music-halls, and he was largely instrumental in forming the Music-Hall Artistes' Association (1885) and later the Music-Hall Benevolent Fund. But such union activities eroded his popularity with managers, and he was often unemployed. He first sang &#145;Two Lovely Black Eyes&#146; on 21 May 1886 at the Paragon Music-Hall, Mile End. It was a parody of a song successful in America, and Coborn plugged the chorus (in eight languages) so successfully that it became highly popular and the subject of political cartoons in <span class="italic">Punch</span>. The tune was even taken up by the Salvation Army, and was still being sung by the prince of Wales in Whitechapel in the 1920s. Its success secured Coborn a fourteen-month stint at the Trocadero and three years at the London Pavilion. In 1891 he bought Fred Gilbert's song &#145;The Man who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo&#146;, which was based on the gambling exploits of a certain Charles Wells, and, donning evening dress, top hat, eyeglass, and buttonhole, Coborn portrayed a tough man about town. The song was again illustrated in <span class="italic">Punch</span>, and Coborn later acted in a film of the same name, made in Monte Carlo in 1919.<br>
<br>In 1900&#150;01 Coborn toured the United States and Canada, and on his return formed his own concert party. During the First World War he entertained the troops and produced a home-made periscope, which was fully tested by the army for use in the trenches. In the 1920s he did fourteen long-distance walks for charity. His autobiography, <span class="italic">The Man who Broke the Bank</span>, was published in 1928. A church sidesman and lay reader, he continued to make occasional appearances until shortly before his death at 27 Elgin Mansions, Paddington, London, on 23 November 1945.<br>
