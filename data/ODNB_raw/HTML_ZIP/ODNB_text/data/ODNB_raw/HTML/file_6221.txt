<span class="headword">Cooper,  John  Gilbert</span>  (1722&#150;1769), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 24 August 1722 at Lockington, Leicestershire, the eldest of five children of John Gilbert (<i>bap</i>. 1672?, <i>d</i>. 1773) and Dorothy (<i>bap</i>. 1695, <i>d</i>. 1727), daughter of William and Martha Bainbrigge. His father inherited the estate of a relation, John Cooper of Thurgarton Priory in Nottinghamshire, on condition that he took Cooper's name and arms. He therefore introduced a private bill into the House of Lords; this received royal assent on 5 May 1736, after which date father and son both took the name John Gilbert Cooper.<br>
<br>Gilbert Cooper received his early education in Sutton Coldfield, proceeding to Westminster School in 1733, and to Trinity College, Cambridge, as a fellow-commoner in 1740. He studied at Gr&ouml;ningen University for eight months from February 1743, after which he toured the United Provinces and Germany, returning to England in May 1744.<br>
<br>Gilbert Cooper's poetic career began in 1742, with the anonymous publication of a poem, <span class="italic">The Temples of Virtue and Pleasure</span>. <span class="italic">The Power of Harmony</span>, a philosophical poem heavily influenced by Lord Shaftesbury's <span class="italic">Characteristicks</span> and Mark Akenside's <span class="italic">The Pleasures of Imagination</span>, followed in 1745. Gilbert Cooper also contributed extensively to <span class="italic">The Museum</span> (1746&#150;7), a periodical published by Robert Dodsley and edited by Akenside; his contributions were usually signed Philaretes.<br>
<br>On 22 October 1748 Gilbert Cooper married Susanna (1723&times;5&#150;1751), the eldest daughter of William Wright, recorder of Leicester. His father now settled on him lands in Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire, and Gilbert Cooper began extensive works on Thurgarton Priory, to which he and his family moved early in 1751. The marriage produced three children: Henry (1749), who died aged one day, and for whom Gilbert Cooper wrote a Latin epitaph, much criticized for its pomposity and apparent insincerity; Susanna (1750&#150;1802); and John (1751&#150;1822). His wife died on 10 November 1751, seven weeks after the birth of John.<br>
<br>Gilbert Cooper became embroiled in a literary controversy on the publication of his historical work, <span class="italic">The Life of Socrates</span> (1749). In it he showed little respect for established scholarship; and in particular he singled out the works of William Warburton for attack. Warburton retaliated in a note to <span class="italic">An Essay on Criticism</span> in his edition of Pope (1751), and Gilbert Cooper swiftly replied in a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Cursory Remarks on Mr Warburton's New Edition of Mr Pope's Works</span>, complaining that Warburton's comments had been personal. His complaint is undercut by his own, very personal, attack on the future bishop's work as &#145;nothing but [what] the inflamed Brain of a rank Monk could conceive, or the Oyster-selling Maids near <i>London-Bridge</i> could utter&#146;  (p. 5). Dr Johnson was perhaps recalling this controversy when he retorted, on hearing that Gilbert Cooper had called him &#145;the Caliban of literature&#146;, &#145;I must dub him the Punchinello&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 2.129).<br>
<br>Gilbert Cooper's next work, <span class="italic">Letters Concerning Taste</span> (1754), was the first book-length contribution in English to the subject. The perspective adopted is both philosophically informed and critically analytic, an approach which was to prove influential. In the later 1750s he turned again to the publication of poetry, including <span class="italic">Epistles to the Great, from Aristippus in Retirement</span> (1757); <span class="italic">The Call of Aristippus</span> (1758); and a translation of Jean-Baptiste-Louis Gresset's mock-heroic tale of a nunnery parrot, <span class="italic">Ver-vert</span> (1759). These three works were in a French metre introduced into English by Gilbert Cooper, in which octosyllabic couplets are interspersed irregularly among octosyllabic lines rhyming on different patterns. He published nothing new after 1759, although a manuscript comedy, &#145;The Lover's Resolution&#146;, dated 1762, survives (Nottinghamshire County RO, M9660), and in 1764 the Dodsleys published a selection of his poetry.<br>
<br>From November 1755 Gilbert Cooper lived mainly in London, where he became actively involved in the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce; he is said to have resigned when he failed to be elected as the society's vice-president. Gilbert Cooper died at his house in Mayfair on 14 April 1769, having suffered from kidney stones, and was buried on 21 April at Thurgarton.<br>
