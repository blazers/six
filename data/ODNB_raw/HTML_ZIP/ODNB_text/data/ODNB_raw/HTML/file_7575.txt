<span class="headword">Duwes <span class="st"> [Dewes]</span>,  Giles</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Aegidius  de Vadis]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1535), <span class="occ">musician and royal tutor</span>, was perhaps of Norman origin; the village of Le Vey on the plain of Caen was then called Wez and Latinized as Vadum. One of the many useful foreigners who served Henry VII, Duwes first appears in the Tudor household accounts about the turn of the sixteenth century as a professional musician. His will mentions a wife named &#145;Jhone&#146; and four children: Henry, Arthur, Gwylliam, and Margaret. Because he named all but one of these children after his royal pupils, they must have been born later than their royal counterparts and probably following his entrance into royal service. Arthur was old enough by 1515 to enter Henry VIII's household as a professional lute player. Giles had therefore probably entered Henry VII's service by the mid-1490s. As &#145;Luter unto oure derrest Son the duke of Yorke&#146;, Duwes was formally a member of Prince Henry's household by November 1501. In the course of music tuition, he bought lute strings for &#145;the Quene of Scottes lewte&#146; (Princess Margaret) in July 1502 and &#145;for My Lady Mares lute&#146; in 1507. From 1502 onwards he drew his regular half-yearly salary of 10<i>s</i>. as a lute player from the king's privy purse. At the funeral of Henry VII in 1509 he appears in the household roster as one of three &#145;Mynstrells of the Chambre&#146;.<br>
<br>Duwes's role as French tutor may have begun informally as a consequence of his music lessons. In his French grammar, <span class="italic">An Introductorie for to Lerne to Rede, to Pronounce, and to Speke French Trewly</span> (1533?), he recalls that he had already served the Tudor court &#145;therty yeres and more&#146; as &#145;schoolmaster for the French tongue&#146;, an observation that seems to date the beginning of his French teaching career to about the turn of the century. He also claims to have taught French to all of Henry VII's children (Arthur, Henry, Margaret, and Mary), as well as to Henry VIII's daughter, Mary, and to Henry Courtenay, the future marquess of Exeter  (Duwes, <span class="italic">Introductorie</span>, 895&#150;6). His career as a French tutor to Prince Arthur probably began in 1500, when the poet Bernard Andr&eacute; retired, and it ended with Arthur's departure for Wales (November 1501), where the prince died. During the same period, he must have given Princess Margaret French lessons along with her lute instruction. Soon after she left for Scotland in 1503 Duwes, now described as Prince Henry's &#145;Master to lute French&#146;, had begun to teach both French and lute playing to the new heir apparent, and in that capacity he attended the funeral of Queen Elizabeth. From 1507 on (by which time he would have begun teaching French to both Princess Mary and Henry Courtenay), the household account books routinely identify him as &#145;Master Giles Luter&#146;, the unusual title (no other household musician is so described) apparently referring to his dual role as schoolmaster and entertainer.<br>
<br>From April 1506 a dramatic increase in his salary (from 10<i>s</i>. to 10 marks half yearly) probably represents Duwes's assumption of the royal librarian's duties, in addition to his tutorial and entertainment responsibilities, on the departure of his predecessor, Quentin Poulet. At the accession of Henry VIII, Duwes's position as keeper of the king's library at Richmond was formalized by a patent on 20 September 1509 at annual salary of &pound;10 &#145;during pleasure&#146;, and this patent was then renewed on 24 March 1512 &#145;for life&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 1(1), 190(27); 1(1), 1123(56)). During his long tenure as keeper of the royal library, Duwes presided over a collection that served both as a working library and as an impressive ornament of the royal estate. In 1521 he composed &#145;Dialogus inter naturam et filium philosophiae&#146; in the Richmond Library, completing it, he says, on &#145;17 ides July&#146;. An alchemical treatise, it circulated widely both in its original Latin and in a late sixteenth-century English translation. In it, the goddess Natura appears to an earnest, if befuddled, student of philosophy to explain the &#145;dark riddles, labyrinths, tropes, intricate allegories, metaphors, and shadows&#146; which have nearly discouraged him from the further pursuit of alchemy  (BL, Sloane MS 3580B, fol. 186<i>v</i>). In February 1535, a few weeks before Duwes's death, two French visitors drew up a list of 143 of the volumes then in the Richmond Library. Though containing a few English works, the inventory suggests that Duwes oversaw a predominately Latin and French-language collection full of chronicles, history, Latin classics, religion, and theology, together with a few volumes of poetry and romance.<br>
<br>After the accession of Henry VIII, Duwes found that his old pupil seemed eager to bestow favour and wealth upon him. In 1510 the king appointed him keeper of &#145;le Prince Warderobe&#146; in the city of London, one of the large warehouses used as a storehouse for the royal household, and also increased his salary to 40<i>s</i>. per month. In 1515 he accepted Duwes's son, Arthur, into his household, initially as a lute player at a monthly salary of 10<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., later as a lute teacher for Henry Fitzroy, duke of Richmond. Through the next twenty-five years there followed numerous gifts, lucrative concessions to import Toulouse woad and Gascon wine, and a licence to keep up to &pound;1000 of the customs duties on his imported or exported goods over a five-year period.<br>
<br>Between 1525 and 1528 Duwes accompanied the Princess Mary as one of her &#145;gentleman waiters&#146; to the Welsh marches, where he served for the last time in his familiar roles as music teacher and French language tutor. His royal pupil apparently flourished under his supervision, for a French embassy of 1527 reported that she spoke French well, and others remarked upon her mastery of the lute. His <span class="italic">Introductorie</span> emerged from this experience as a result of an explicit royal command &#145;to reduce and to put by writtyng&#146; the methods he had used for over thirty years to teach the language to his royal pupils  (Duwes, <span class="italic">Introductorie</span>, 897). In response, he produced a pioneering work on French language pedagogy in two books, a grammar and a series of model dialogues in French and English. The dialogues provide an illuminating, if perhaps idealized, glimpse of court life in Princess Mary's household. In one, he frames a dialogue on the subject of love between the princess and John ap Morgan, the treasurer of her chamber (whom he playfully styles &#145;her husband adoptif&#146;); in another, he represents Mary as &#145;crased&#146; for lack of ap Morgan's company. In still others, her almoner teaches her the meaning of the mass or practises speaking French with her in &#145;the Park of Tewksbury&#146;, which Mary visited in September 1526. In several, Duwes excuses his absences from lessons because of sickness, once explicitly the gout. Duwes often represents himself as a philosophical interlocutor, now expounding St Augustine's ideas on peace, now St Isidore's on the nature of the soul. Throughout, he represents himself as a witty and avuncular schoolmaster on mutually affectionate terms with his pupil. He published his <span class="italic">Introductorie</span> in 1533 or 1534, dedicating it of necessity not only to King Henry and the Lady Mary but also to the new queen, Anne Boleyn. At the same time, as a final expression of royal favour, his wife was appointed to Mary's household as one of her gentlewomen.<br>
<br>By 1534 Duwes's tenure as royal librarian was ending. On 11 March William Tyldysley was granted a patent to establish his right to succeed Duwes in &#145;the office of Keeper of the King's Library in the manor of Richmond or elsewhere, whenever it shall happen to be vacant&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 7, no. 419(11)). Duwes made his will on 20 December 1534, apparently expecting impending death. He thus mentions a series of bequests in the form of &#145;tokens&#146; which he had already wrapped and labelled and to which he had affixed his seal for the &#145;knoolege&#146; and &#145;behooff&#146; of his beneficiaries. He also left a large collection of musical instruments&#151;&#145;clavicordes, virginalles, recordes, regalles&#146;&#151;to his sons Arthur and Gwylliam, but specifically reserved his lute and his &#145;bookes of musyck and frensshe&#146; for his son Arthur alone. A few months later, on 12 April 1535, Duwes died and a second patent was issued to confirm William Tyldysley's actual possession of the now vacant office. He was buried in the London church of St Olave Upwell, and his will was proved on 24 April 1535. A gift of a &#145;Frountlet&#146; to a &#145;maistres Colson sometyme maistres giles&#146; recorded among the Princess Mary's privy purse expenses for January 1538 may suggest that his widow married again after his death.<br>
