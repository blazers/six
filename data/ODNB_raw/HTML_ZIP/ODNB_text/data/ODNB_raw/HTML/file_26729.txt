<span class="headword">Wortley,  James Archibald  Stuart-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>James Archibald  Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie]</span>, first Baron Wharncliffe  (1776&#150;1845), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 6 October 1776, the second but eldest surviving son of James Archibald Stuart (1747&#150;1818), lieutenant-colonel of the 92nd regiment of foot, and Margaret, daughter of Sir David Conyngham, bt, of Milncraig, Ayrshire. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26716/', "John Stuart, third earl of Bute")</script>, was his grandfather, and John, first marquess of Bute, his uncle. His father's mother (the countess of Bute) was Mary, only daughter of Edward and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19029/', "Lady Mary Wortley Montagu")</script>; she had been created a peeress on 3 April 1761 as Baroness Mountstuart. In 1794 the father succeeded on her death to her Wortley estates in Yorkshire and Cornwall, and took the name of Wortley on 17 January 1795. In 1803 he took the additional name of Mackenzie on succeeding to the Scottish property of his uncle, James Stuart Mackenzie of Rosehaugh.<h2>
<a name="Thearmymarriageandearlypoliticalcareer"></a>The army, marriage, and early political career</h2>The younger James Archibald, who eventually dropped the last surname of Mackenzie, was educated at Charterhouse (1789&#150;90). He entered the army in November 1790 as an ensign in the 48th foot. In the following May he transferred into the 7th Royal Fusiliers, and on 4 May 1793 obtained a company in the 72nd highlanders. He served in Canada from 1792 to 1794 and at the Cape from 1795 to 1797. On 10 May 1796 he became lieutenant-colonel, and on 1 December colonel of the 12th foot. In 1797 he was sent to the Cape with dispatches from George, Lord Macartney, and on 27 December purchased a company in the 1st foot guards. He left the army at the peace of 1801. On 30 March 1799 he married Lady Elizabeth Caroline Mary, daughter of John Creighton, first earl of Erne (1738?&#150;1828), and his second wife, Mary Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1842). Lady Granville said of her that &#145;She has all the charm of intelligence without the tax of <i>esprit</i>&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>). The marriage associated him with Lord Liverpool and his supporters.<br>
<br>In 1802 Stuart-Wortley succeeded his father in the House of Commons as MP for the family borough of Bossiney, which he continued to represent until his father's death in 1818. Although he was not a prominent MP, he gained a reputation for independence of view. On 21 May 1812, in the aftermath of Spencer Perceval's assassination, he moved a resolution on his own initiative for an address to the prince regent, calling for &#145;a stronger and more efficient administration&#146;. The motion, seconded by Lord Milton, was carried against ministers by a majority of four  (<span class="italic">Hansard 1</span>, 23, 21 May 1812, 249&#150;84). Next day ministers resigned, and Lord Wellesley was commissioned to form a government. Negotiations with the whigs having come to nothing, and Stuart-Wortley having failed in a secret attempt to bring Liverpool and George Canning together, on 11 June he moved a second motion, deploring the failure and ridiculing the whigs; it was eventually negatived without a division.<br>
<br>Henceforth Stuart-Wortley acted with the moderate tories as an independent supporter of the Liverpool ministry. He was encouraged to stand for Yorkshire where his estates lay, but after taking soundings did not press his claim. He continued to take a minor part in politics, deprecating harsh treatment of the princess of Wales in 1814, advocating retrenchment in the army in 1816, and voting that year with the opposition against the creation of new governmental offices.<br>
<br>In 1818 Stuart-Wortley was returned unopposed for Yorkshire. His colleague as MP was Lord Milton (afterwards Earl Fitzwilliam). Stuart-Wortley at once found himself involved in fiscal policy, supporting retrenchment and moderate tariff reform, and presenting merchants' petitions. He played in important role in preventing riots in Yorkshire in 1819, but he opposed parliamentary reform. On the other hand, he proposed a property tax to relieve the poor from the burden of taxation. In May 1820 he declared against further protection to agriculture, holding that the distress of that interest bore no proportion to that of manufactures  (<span class="italic">Hansard 2</span>, 1, May 1820, 116, 117).<br>
<br>In questions of foreign policy Stuart-Wortley shared the views of Canning. On 21 June 1821 he moved for copies of the circular issued by the members of the Holy Alliance at Laibach, stigmatizing their proceedings as dangerous to the liberties of both England and Europe. The motion was negatived by 113 to 59  (<span class="italic">Hansard 2</span>, 5, 21 June 1821, 1254&#150;60). In April 1823 he defended the ministerial policy of neutrality between France and Spain, and moved and carried an amendment to a motion condemning it. He also acted with the liberal sections of both parties in supporting Catholic emancipation, to which he had announced himself a convert as early as 1812, and on 28 May 1823 he seconded Lord Nugent's motion for leave to bring in a bill to assimilate the position of English and Irish Roman Catholics. But his attitude to the question lost him his seat in 1826.<br>
<br>Stuart-Wortley's position towards economic questions probably also unfavourably affected his relations with some of his constituents. In February 1823 he had supported both by speech and vote Whitmore's bill to amend the corn laws. On 7 July 1823, in opposing the <span class="roman">Reciprocity of Duties Bill</span>, he gave his opinion that it would be impossible to retain for any considerable time the protection given to agricultural produce  (<span class="italic">Hansard 2</span>, 9, 7 July 1823, 1439).<br>
<br>In 1824 Stuart-Wortley brought in a bill to amend the game laws. Its object was twofold: to abolish the system by which the right to kill game was vested in a class and to make it depend on the ownership of the soil, and to diminish the temptations to poaching by legalizing the sale of game. The bill was often reintroduced in succeeding years, and it was not until 1832 that a measure which embodied its main provisions became law.<h2>
<a name="WharncliffeandtheReformBill"></a>Wharncliffe and the Reform Bill</h2>On 12 July 1826, having been defeated in his Yorkshire constituency, Stuart-Wortley was created Baron Wharncliffe of Wortley. In 1829 he introduced a standing order into the House of Lords that required a special meeting of shareholders to be held to approve any application to parliament to vary the powers of the company as originally constituted. The order became known as the Wharncliffe order and the special meetings as Wharncliffe meetings. He abandoned his earlier hostility to parliamentary reform and in 1831, after carrying an amendment raising the voting qualification at Leeds, he took charge of the <span class="roman">Grampound Disfranchisement Bill</span>, the object of which was to transfer its representation to that town. When the House of Lords proposed instead to give additional members to the county of York, Wharncliffe advised the abandonment of the measure. On 28 March 1831, by moving for statistics of population and representation, he initiated the first general discussion of the reform question in the House of Lords. While making an able and hostile analysis of the government bill, he declared his conviction that no body of men outside parliament would back resistance to a moderate measure  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 3, 28 March 1831, 983 et seq.). On the rejection of the first <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> in committee of the House of Commons, on 22 April 1831 he moved an address to the king praying him to refrain from using his prerogative of proroguing or dissolving parliament. As Lord Brougham was replying, the king was announced, and, after a scene of great confusion, the prorogation took place. When on 3 October that year the second <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> came up for second reading in the upper house, Wharncliffe moved that it be read a second time six months hence. He objected that the proposed ten-pound franchise was a bogus one, that the measure was designed to delude the landed interest, and he took exception to its populational basis. He refrained, however, from any defence of nomination boroughs. After a brilliant debate the second reading was defeated by 199 to 158. Two days later Wharncliffe presented petitions against the measure from bankers and merchants of London, and maintained that the opinion of the capital was opposed to the bill. But he had lost confidence in the possibility of successful resistance. In an interview with &#145;Radical Jones&#146; [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15058/', "Jones, Leslie Grove")</script>], he was impressed by his prediction of the dangers which would follow the rejection of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>. Within a month of the defeat of the measure Wharncliffe and Harrowby were approached by the whig government through their sons in the Commons (Wharncliffe's son John was MP for Bossiney). After a meeting of the two fathers and sons at Harrowby's house in Staffordshire, a memorandum was drawn up as a basis for negotiation. The memorandum was shown to the cabinet and approved. But many tories declined to accept Wharncliffe's compromise. The City of London refused its adhesion, and Lord Grey broke off the negotiations. Grey sent the king Wharncliffe's memorandum, and William IV expressed regret at the failure of negotiations, but thought what had passed was calculated to be useful. On 11 December a further meeting between Wharncliffe, Harrowby, and Chandos on the one side, and Grey, Brougham, and Althorp on the other, proved equally fruitless. Nevertheless, in January 1832, Wharncliffe advised the tories to support the second reading of the new bill and afterwards modify it in committee. He impressed on Wellington the danger of coming into collision with crown, Commons, and people in a useless struggle. His remonstrance failed to move the duke, and Wharncliffe determined to act independently of him. In two interviews with William IV (on 12 January and in early February), he assured the king that as he and his friends were determined to support the second reading there was no need of a creation of peers. On 27 March Wharncliffe and Harrowby made their first public declaration of their intention to support the bill, Wharncliffe being, according to Greville, &#145;very short and rather embarrassed&#146;. On 9 April their support secured for the second reading a majority of nine.<br>
<br>Wharncliffe felt acutely his separation from the tory party, and on 7 May voted for Lyndhurst's amendment postponing the disfranchising clauses, by which the progress of the bill was again delayed. His position was now very difficult  (<span class="italic">Croker Papers</span>, 2.174); he had offended both his own party and the whigs. Grey resigned on the carrying of Lyndhurst's amendment, and Wellington, when seeking to form a government, was advised by Lyndhurst not only to offer office to Wharncliffe's son, but to consider well before he decided not to include Wharncliffe himself. The whigs soon resumed office, and the bill was proceeded with. On 24 May Wharncliffe moved an amendment to prevent persons voting for counties in respect of property situated in boroughs, and said he was not reconciled to the bill, which went further than the occasion required. The following day he proposed that the ten-pound qualification should be based on the assessment for poor rate  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 13, 24 May 1832, 19, 111, et seq.). He abstained from voting on the third reading, but signed the two protests drawn up by Lord Melros  (ibid., 377&#150;8). Anxious to regain the favour of his party, Wharncliffe in 1833 sent Wellington a sketch of a proposed policy in the new parliament, with which the duke concurred.<h2>
<a name="Laterpoliticalcareer"></a>Later political career</h2>In February 1834 Greville described Wharncliffe as &#145;very dismal about the prospects of the country&#146;. On 13 December of the same year Wharncliffe was invited by Peel to join his first ministry, notwithstanding the lukewarmness of his recent opposition to the <span class="roman">Irish Tithe Bill</span>. He accepted the office of lord privy seal after receiving an assurance that the policy of the new ministry would be liberal in character. In January 1835 he acted as one of the committee to arrange the <span class="roman">Church Reform Bill</span>. In April he retired with his colleagues, and remained in opposition during the next six years. During these years Wharncliffe found time to edit the letters and works of his ancestor, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. His edition appeared in five volumes in 1837, and superseded Dallaway's. It was reissued in 1861 and 1893.<br>
<br>When Peel returned to office in the autumn of 1841, Wharncliffe became lord president of the council. His return to tory favour was marked by his appointment as lord lieutenant of Yorkshire in 1841. As lord president, he was, according to Greville, fair, liberal, and firm. &#145;He really, too, does the business himsel.f&#146; On the other hand, he was not so successful as leader in the upper house. He was too liberal in education matters for the high-church party, and did not have sufficient weight in cabinet to enforce the execution of his views. He took part against Peel in the cabinet discussions which preceded his change of policy on the subject of the corn laws, though Peel expected Wharncliffe would ultimately come round. However, on 19 December 1845 he died unexpectedly, of &#145;gout and apoplexy&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>) at Wharncliffe House, Curzon Street, London. Greville, who knew him well, said no man ever died with fewer enemies. Wharncliffe was an important representative of moderate tory opinion. He offered the party a way out of its difficulties in 1830&#150;32 which brought him enduring hostility from the party, the more staunchly held the more the need for moderate reform became recognized. His role in preventing the need for the creation of peers preserved the powers of the Lords unchanged for the rest of the century; for the tories, at least, this was a priceless service.<h2>
<a name="Wharncliffeschildren"></a>Wharncliffe's children</h2>Wharncliffe and his wife had three sons and one daughter, Caroline, who married the Hon. John Chetwynd Talbot.<br>
<br>The eldest son, <a name="cosubject_26730"></a><span class="headword">John  Stuart-Wortley</span>, second Baron Wharncliffe  (1801&#150;1855)<span class="occ"></span>, born at Egham, Surrey, on 23 April 1801, graduated BA from Christ Church, Oxford, in 1822, with a first class in mathematics and a second in classics. He represented Bossiney from 1823 to 1832, Perth burghs in 1830, and the West Riding of Yorkshire from 1841 until his succession to the peerage. He acted with the Huskissonian party until appointed secretary to the Board of Control on 16 February 1830 in the last tory ministry before the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>. He shared his father's views on the reform question. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Forfarshire in 1835, and twice failed to obtain election for the West Riding of Yorkshire, but in 1841 won a great triumph for his party in that constituency. He was an enlightened agriculturist and a cultivated man. He was elected FRS in 1829. Besides publishing pamphlets on the abolition of the Irish viceroyalty, on the institution of tribunals of commerce, and a letter to Philip Pusey on drainage in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Agricultural Society</span>, he was author of <span class="italic">A brief inquiry into the true award of an equitable adjustment between the nation and its creditors</span> (1833), and translator and editor of Guizot's <span class="italic">Memoirs of George Monk</span> (1838). He died of consumption at Wortley Hall, near Sheffield, on 22 October 1855, and was buried at Wortley. With his wife, Georgiana, third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24395/', "Dudley Ryder, first earl of Harrowby")</script>, he had three sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Edward Montagu Granville Stuart-Wortley, born on 15 December 1827, was on 15 January 1876 created earl of Wharncliffe and Viscount Carlton; he died on 13 May 1899.<br>
<br>The first Lord Wharncliffe's youngest son, <a name="cosubject_26729"></a><span class="headword">James Archibald  Stuart-Wortley</span>  (1805&#150;1881)<span class="occ"></span>, was born in St James's Square, London, on 3 July 1805. He graduated BA from Christ Church, Oxford, in 1826, and was soon after elected fellow of Merton. He was called to the bar from the Inner Temple in 1831, and took silk ten years later. In 1844 he became counsel to the Bank of England, and in the following year was appointed solicitor-general to the queen dowager and attorney-general to the duchy of Lancaster. In 1846 he was sworn of the privy council, and was judge-advocate-general during the last months of Peel's second administration. In 1851 he became recorder of London, and was solicitor-general under Lord Palmerston in 1857. From 1835 to 1837 he represented Halifax as a Conservative and from 1842 to 1859 sat for Buteshire (after 1846 as a Peelite). Stuart-Wortley married, in 1846, the Hon. Jane Lawley [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55213/', "Wortley, Jane Stuart- (1820&#150;1900)")</script>], only daughter of Paul Beilby Thompson, first Baron Wenlock. Despite the assistance of various Peelites, including William Ewart Gladstone, she was unable to prevent the onset of severe bouts of depression which effectively ended his public career. He died at Bolton House, Grantham, on 22 August 1881. His second son, <a name="cosubject_56112"></a><span class="headword">Charles Beilby  Stuart-Wortley</span>, Baron Stuart of Wortley  (1851&#150;1926), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, became a QC and was tory MP for Sheffield. He was under-secretary for the Home Office in 1885 and again from 1886 to 1892; he was created Baron Stuart of Wortley in 1917. He was an urbane man with wide intellectual interests. His first wife was Beatrice (Bice) Trollope (1853&#150;1881), daughter of the writers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27755/', "Thomas Adolphus Trollope")</script>, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27754/', "Theodosia Trollope")</script>, and niece of the novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27748/', "Anthony Trollope")</script>. She died in childbirth the year after they married. His second wife was Caroline, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18713/', "Sir John Millais")</script>.<br>
