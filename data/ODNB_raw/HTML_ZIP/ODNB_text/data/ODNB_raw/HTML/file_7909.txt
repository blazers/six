<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Douglas,  John Sholto</span>, ninth marquess of Queensberry  (1844&#150;1900), <span class="occ">sportsman and controversialist</span>, was born in Florence on 20 July 1844, the first son of Archibald William Douglas, eighth marquess (1818&#150;1858), and Caroline Margaret (1821&#150;1904), daughter of Lieutenant-General Sir William Clayton of Harleyford, Buckinghamshire. He was the brother of the author and traveller <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32836/', "Florence Dixie (1855&#150;1905)")</script>. Such formal education as he received was gained at the naval training school, Portsmouth, before his transfer to the naval training ship <i>Britannia</i>. Douglas became Viscount Drumlanrig in 1856, the year in which he first went to sea as a twelve-year-old midshipman. He remained a sailor after inheriting the marquessate in 1858, following his father's apparent suicide, and became a lieutenant in the navy in 1859. He returned to dry land only in 1864 to matriculate at Magdalene College, Cambridge. While an undergraduate he became engaged to Sybil Montgomery (1845&#150;1935), daughter of Alfred Montgomery, commissioner of the Inland Revenue, and Fanny Charlotte Wyndham, daughter of George, first Baron Leconfield. The couple married at St George, Hanover Square, on 26 February 1866.<h2>
<a name="SportandtheQueensberryrules"></a>Sport and the Queensberry rules</h2>At Cambridge Queensberry distinguished himself at hunting, steeplechasing, running, and cricket: he left after two years without graduating, and would maintain throughout his life that he had &#145;never known a degree to be worth twopence to anybody&#146;  (Roberts, 27). His sporting education would indeed prove more useful to him than any academic work he might have undertaken. In 1866 he embarked on a tour of the United States in the company of the duke of Manchester and the lightweight boxing champion J. G. Chambers to promote the sport of boxing, then somewhat in disrepute, across the Atlantic. The chief outcome of the trip was the formulation of the Queensberry rules, devised to replace the permissive London prize ring rules of 1839. The rules established the fundamental provisions which have governed the sport ever since, concerning, for instance, the conduct of fighters, the length of rounds, and the duration of the count following a knock-out. Though Queensberry was said to have been responsible for the definition of boxing weights, most of the Queensberry rules were drawn up by Chambers, the aristocratic title being adopted in the hope of enhancing the sport's respectability. Queensberry's own pugilism was not, in fact, always respectable&#151;as a sailor he had briefly been imprisoned following a fracas in Madeira, and in 1872 he would be fined 20<i>s</i>. by Bow Street magistrates for assaulting a man who had attempted to prevent him assaulting a hotel porter&#151;but he was said to be the finest amateur boxer of his time and was at one point amateur lightweight champion. He was also said, though, to care more for steeplechasing than for boxing. He gained his first success in the Dumfriesshire Hunt Club chase in 1865, but &#145;his ambition as a rider was greater than his abilities&#146;, according to one authority: in the course of his career he would break both arms and legs, twice fracture his collar bone and frequently sustain concussion  (Roberts, 71). He rode his last winner at Sandown Park in 1883. Though a member of the Grand National Hunt committee, he never realized his ambition of winning the National. A last-minute substitution deprived him of a ride on the victorious Old Joe in 1886&#151;a cause of lasting distress to him.<br>
<br>Queensberry was also a keen huntsman, becoming master of the Worcester foxhounds in 1870. His move south reflected his alienation from his wife. Four sons were born in the first six years of the marriage&#151;Francis Archibald (1867&#150;1894), Percy Sholto Douglas (1868&#150;1920), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32869/', "Alfred Bruce Douglas (1870&#150;1945)")</script>, and George Sholto (1872&#150;1932)&#151;but marital friction was evident almost from the start. Queensberry returned to the family home of Kinmount in Dumfriesshire in 1872, when he was elected a representative Scottish peer, but from that year he and his wife &#145;met only to quarrel&#146;  (Roberts, 70). His children grew up under the wing of a doting mother, and would side with her in the developing family dispute. &#145;The truth is that we hardly ever saw him&#146;, Lord Alfred Douglas said of his father, &#145;while his own public conduct was hardly such as &hellip; to command the sort of slavish obedience to his orders which he seemed to expect from his children&#146;  (A. Douglas, <span class="italic">Without Apology</span>, 236). Queensberry's private conduct was hardly more edifying: he underlined his estrangement from his wife by establishing a London home in James Street, Marylebone, where he entertained a succession of mistresses.<h2>
<a name="Politicsthepeerageandprivatehedonism"></a>Politics, the peerage, and private hedonism</h2>Queensberry's peerage did not confer the right to sit in the House of Lords, which he attained only by virtue of election by the body of Scottish peers. He had hoped for elevation to the British peerage by Derby's government in 1867&#151;his father had been a Conservative and he would generally vote with the tories as a representative peer&#151;but the Conservatives' defeat in 1868 ended any immediate prospect of a British title. The position of a Scottish elective peer was generally secure enough, and Queensberry was re-elected in 1874, but he was unseated by his peers in 1880, in explicit reaction to his unorthodox views on religion, which he expressed with increasing emphasis during the 1870s. Queensberry had been brought up a high-churchman, though his mother and one of his brothers converted to Catholicism in the early 1860s. The sequence of family tragedies which befell Queensberry&#151;the premature deaths of his father, two brothers, and his eldest son, three of them probably by suicide&#151;would have tested anybody's faith. It is not clear whether Queensberry's move towards agnosticism was prompted by the death of his brother Francis in a mountaineering accident on the Matterhorn in July 1865, but it is the case that the most extended statement of Queensberry's creed took the form of a poem, <span class="italic">The Spirit of the Matterhorn</span>, written in Zermatt in 1873. He published the poem in 1881, dedicating it to the peers of Scotland who had denied him re-election. It represents an unconventional attempt to come to terms with the concept of death without recourse to consoling doctrines of the afterlife. Queensberry denied that the soul was an entity separate from the body and refused to categorize as &#145;God&#146; a power which he believed &#145;undefinable by man&#146;  (preface, 5&#150;6). He argued that in death souls slept, surrendering their individuality &#145;in the great essence of an Eternal Power&#146; before gaining fresh identities in new human frames: &#145;for death is life and life eternity&#146;  (ibid., 17, 21). This process tended towards the perfection of man (indeed, the sinful were held to &#145;possess no right to be progenitors&#146;), a perfection defined as &#145;man's complete adaptation, socially, morally and physically, to his surroundings&#146; (ibid., 24; preface, 15). The poem is an idiosyncratic confection of theism, humanism, and social Darwinism (Herbert Spencer was the only authority cited in Queensberry's 1881 preface, and Alfred Douglas believed Spencer and Huxley to be the only non-fiction writers to have captured Queensberry's attention). It defined Queensberry, in his own mind, as an agnostic rather than an atheist, but the distinction carried little weight in the eyes of polite society when, influenced by the freethinkers G. J. Holyoake and Moncure Conway, he fell into the company of the London secularist community. Queensberry became president of the British Secularist Union on its formation in 1877. This body was a secession from Charles Bradlaugh's National Secular Society, and Queensberry played little part in the debates over Bradlaugh's refusal to take the parliamentary oath in the early 1880s, but he did attain notoriety in November 1882 with a public protest to interrupt a performance of Tennyson's stage play, <span class="italic">The Promise of May</span>, with its unflattering portrayal of a freethinker. In 1884, though, the disbandment of the British Secularist Union robbed Queensberry of his public platform, and he returned to a life of private hedonism. This life was led largely in London. At the Pelican Club in Gerrard Street he entertained his fellow sporting aristocrats with songs delivered in what Alfred Douglas remembered as a pleasant baritone voice. He continued to entertain women at James Street and various hotels, conduct which provided the grounds for his eventual divorce from Sybil in November 1887, when two servants testified to his adultery with Mabel Gilroy of Camden Town (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 24 Jan 1887; Ellmann, 366).<h2>
<a name="Secondmarriage"></a>Second marriage</h2>Queensberry's second marriage, at Eastbourne register office on 7 November 1893, remains mysterious. The new marchioness, whom Queensberry was said to have met on the Eastbourne promenade, was Ethel, daughter of Edward Charles Weeden of Eastbourne. The union was unsuccessful. After only four months of marriage, spent entirely in hotels in London and the Isle of Wight, Ethel petitioned for annulment, alleging at an <i>in camera</i> hearing in October 1894 that Queensberry had been &#145;wholly unable to consummate [the marriage] by reason of the frigidity and impotence of his parts of generation, &hellip; incurable by art or skill&#146;. Queensberry claimed in response to be &#145;apt for coition as will appear on inspection&#146;, but the annulment was eventually granted on the grounds not only of frigidity and impotence, but also of &#145;malformation of the parts of generation of the said Respondent&#146;. What effect this private humiliation had on Queensberry's attitude during the legal contest with Oscar Wilde, over the next few months, remains unknowable, but he is unlikely to have felt entirely temperate about sexual issues  (TNA: PRO, J77/532/16267).<h2>
<a name="OscarWilde"></a>Oscar Wilde</h2>The context for the battle with Wilde was another family tragedy, the death of Queensberry's eldest son, Francis, Viscount Drumlanrig, in October 1894. Drumlanrig had become a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the prime minister Lord Rosebery during Rosebery's tenure of the Foreign Office in 1892&#150;4. Rumours that he had been drawn into a homosexual relationship with the statesman led to Queensberry's quixotic trip to Bad Homburg in the hope&#151;unrealized&#151;of horse-whipping Rosebery. Queensberry, like many others, believed his son's death during a shooting party to have been suicide. His sensitivity to any hint of homosexuality in the family had already been evident in his claims that his father-in-law was a homosexual  (Hyde, <span class="italic">Douglas</span>, 8) and in his insistence that Alfred Douglas should not follow his closest prep school friend to Eton College  (Roberts, 150). The ill-concealed sexual basis of Alfred's friendship with Oscar Wilde provided a constant public provocation to Queensberry. He attempted first to humiliate Wilde with an exercise in audience participation similar to his Tennyson protest, arriving for the first performance of <span class="italic">The Importance of being Earnest</span> with a bunch of carrots which he hoped to throw at Wilde. Denied entry to the theatre, he sought other means of goading Wilde, and succeeded spectacularly with a card left at Wilde's club, said to depict him &#145;posing as a somdomite [<i>sic</i>]&#146;. Wilde's response, an ill-advised libel action, brought not only Queensberry's acquittal, to public acclaim, but also the clear advertisement of Wilde's homosexuality&#151;a criminal offence under the 1885 <span class="roman">Criminal Law Amendment Act</span>. Wilde was prosecuted, convicted, and imprisoned and Queensberry lionized, &#145;taking the place of the great Duke of Wellington in the hearts of the British people&#146;, in Alfred Douglas's sardonic words  (Roberts, 255).<h2>
<a name="Declinedisintegrationanddeath"></a>Decline, disintegration, and death</h2>This unfamiliar adulation did not last long, and Queensberry lapsed rapidly during the remainder of the decade into obscurity, decline, and death. It seems likely&#151;though this is a conjecture and an induction&#151;that he fell victim to syphilis, a common&#151;and commonly concealed&#151;cause of aristocratic death in the late Victorian period. It is clear that neither the impotence nor the &#145;malformation&#146; attested in the 1894 annulment were the lifelong afflictions of a man who had fathered four children and been divorced for adultery. Syphilis would be consistent both with Alfred Douglas's claim that his father's mental powers deteriorated rapidly after the age of forty  (A. Douglas, <span class="italic">Without Apology</span>, 247) and with his temperamental volatility in his relationships with those around him. He disowned his second son, Percy, &#145;that so-called skunk of a son of mine&#146;  (Douglas and Colson, 63), for marrying a clergyman's daughter in 1893, affected an emotional reconciliation with him on his return from Australia, assaulted him in the street during the Wilde trial (both parties were bound over for &pound;500), and finally acknowledged a deathbed visit by spitting at his son and heir. Syphilitic dementia would be consistent with the delusions of Queensberry's last years, when he believed that he was being persecuted by the &#145;Oscar Wilders&#146;  (Hyde, <span class="italic">Trials of Oscar Wilde</span>, 10), and syphilitic paresis could explain his early death on 31 January 1900, attributed publicly to &#145;a serious illness of a paralytic nature&#146; after a stroke two months earlier had confined him to a bed in his club in Welbeck Street (<span class="italic">Dumfries and Galloway Standard</span>, 3 Feb 1900; Roberts, 270). One who had once invoked as man's destiny the &#145;perfection of the body and the mind&#146;  (J. S. Douglas, 21) endured the erosion of both in his final months. Queensberry was cremated at Woking crematorium on 2 February 1900, his ashes being buried at the family burial-ground at Kinmount the following day. The burial-ground was part of only 2000 remaining acres of the 30,000 acres of Scottish estate that Queensberry had inherited. The rest had been sold, as had paintings by Kneller, Lely, Stubbs, and Reynolds in 1897, to fund his London lifestyle, his allowances to his first wife and sons, and the costs&#151;estimated at &pound;2000&#151;of pursuing Wilde.<br>
<br>The Victorians could be most tolerant of the shortcomings of their aristocracy, but Queensberry's combination of profligacy and violence, of adultery, promiscuity, and family neglect, went beyond the limits of society's tolerance. <span class="italic">The Times</span>, in a critical obituary (1 February 1900), considered him representative of &#145;a type of aristocracy which is less common in our time than it was a century ago&#151;the type which is associated in the public mind with a life of idleness and indulgence&#146;. An eighteenth-century Queensberry had in fact been the model for the dissolute Lord March in Thackeray's <span class="italic">The Virginians</span>, and <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> (2 February 1900) observed that &#145;it cannot be said that the eighth [ninth] Marquis &hellip; did anything to bring the title into better repute&#146;. Newspaper obituaries were notably sparse for one who had been a celebrity only five years earlier, and those that did appear made little effort to extend the usual courtesies to the dead. The <span class="italic">Dumfries and Galloway Standard</span> (3 February 1900) noted soberly that &#145;a want of certain commonplace but useful and admirable qualities&#146; had prevented him from playing an appropriate role in public life. <span class="italic">The Field</span> (3 February 1900) even questioned his competence as a boxing referee.<br>
<br>Queensberry left a relieved family which, Wilde claimed, had &#145;often discussed the possibility of getting him put into a lunatic asylum so as to keep him out of the way&#146;  (Hyde, <span class="italic">Trials of Oscar Wilde</span>, 29). Within three weeks of the funeral Wilde recorded receiving Percy and Alfred Douglas in Paris, &#145;in deep mourning and the highest spirits. The English are like that&#146;  (Hyde, <span class="italic">Douglas</span>, 126). Driven by this sense of euphoric release, Percy, who succeeded to his father's title, dissipated what remained of the family fortune in less than eighteen months, being sued for bankruptcy in December 1901.<br>
