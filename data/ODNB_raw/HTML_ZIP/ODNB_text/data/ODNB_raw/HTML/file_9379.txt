<span class="headword">Fyche <span class="st"> [Fich]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1518), <span class="occ">Augustinian canon and ecclesiastical writer</span>, was almost certainly Irish by origin. He is said by Anthony Wood to have studied at Oxford, but is first recorded in 1468 as a canon of Holy Trinity Cathedral priory, Dublin. He was probably related to other men named Fyche who occur in connection with the churches of Dublin, notably Richard Fyche (<i>d</i>. 1482), who was receiver-general to the archbishop of Dublin, and Geoffrey Fyche, who was dean of St Patrick's when he died in 1537. Thomas Fyche was increasingly involved in the administration of his house: in 1478, for instance, he acted as Holy Trinity's proctor at a parliament held at Trim; in 1490 he made a rental for some of its properties; and in 1494 he was said to be the priory's proctor-general at an inquest into its claims to tithes of salmon from the River Liffey. By August 1503 he had become sub-prior, an office he held until his death.<br>
<br>It was doubtless for administrative purposes that Fyche made two compilations relating to Holy Trinity's interests and responsibilities. The so-called <span class="italic">Liber albus</span>, a collection of charters, papal bulls, leases, rentals, and other memoranda, made between November 1504 and January 1518, declares on folio 57 that &#145;I am the book of the cathedral church of the Holy Trinity of the city of Dublin, made by Brother Thomas Fyche, canon of the same&#146;  (Lawlor, 30). A book of obits, which also includes a list of the cathedral's relics (of particular value since these were destroyed in 1538), although it continued to receive entries until 1558, has been attributed in its original form to Fyche, on the strength of the similarity of its handwriting to that of the <span class="italic">Liber albus</span>. It records the names of benefactors going back to the twelfth century, along with members of the priory's confraternity, and also the cathedral canons. The latter include Thomas Fyche himself, who died on 17 January 1518 and was buried in the cathedral. His book of obits was published in 1844, a calendar of the <span class="italic">Liber albus</span> in 1908.<br>
