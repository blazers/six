<span class="headword">Fremantle,  William Henry</span>  (1831&#150;1916), <span class="occ">dean of Ripon</span>, was born in Swanbourne, Buckinghamshire, on 12 December 1831. He was the second son of the politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10160/', "Thomas Francis Fremantle, first Baron Cottesloe (1798&#150;1890)")</script>, and his wife, Louisa Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1875), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20390/', "Field Marshal Sir George Nugent, first baronet")</script>. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33268/', "Sir Edmund Robert Fremantle (1836&#150;1929)")</script>, the admiral, was his younger brother. His uncle, the Revd William Robert Fremantle (1807&#150;1895), then rector of Claydon, near Swanbourne, and William Henry's predecessor as dean of Ripon, was an important early influence, instilling him with an early evangelicalism and a lifelong love of children and games.<br>
<br>Fremantle's education was conventionally classical yet unusually progressive. At Cheam School he came under the influence of Charles Reiner, later tutor to Prince Albert Edward, a German liberal exile whom he described as &#145;without exception the best teacher I have ever known&#146;  (<span class="italic">Recollections</span>, 10). The way in which Reiner was obeyed without recourse to punishment persuaded Fremantle that a &#145;nation [so] ruled would have few rebellious subjects&#146;  (ibid., 11). This was a lesson he subsequently sought to apply far beyond the confines of the nation state. In Dr Hawtrey's Eton College his gregariousness won him the chairmanship of Pop, while his studiousness secured the Newcastle medal in 1849. That same year he went up to Balliol College, Oxford, where he first encountered his lifelong mentor, intermittent colleague, and inconstant patron, Benjamin Jowett. Chastened by a second in classical honours moderations, Fremantle's undergraduate career nevertheless ended in triumph with a first in <i>literae humaniores</i> and the university prize for an English essay on the subject &#145;The influence of commerce on Christianity&#146;, both in 1853. The following autumn he was elected to a prize fellowship at All Souls College.<br>
<br>Oxford also grounded Fremantle in the liberal theology that marked him for the rest of his life. In this Jowett was a direct, if oblique, influence; Arthur (later Dean) Stanley, professor of ecclesiastical history from 1856, a more profound inspiration. However Fremantle's own reading in German biblical criticism, his extensive foreign travels&#151;Italy provoked a profound anti-papism&#151;and his broad-ranging sympathies, especially with the French Huguenots, led if not to original conclusions then certainly to contentiously idiosyncratic emphases in his doctrine. He identified church and nation, arguing that the church was organized in the state for civic purposes and through ecclesiastical institutions for religious worship; indeed, it was commonly observed that the only part of his teaching which was obscure was &#145;the doubt whether the Prime Minister ought to be <i>ex officio</i> Archbishop of Canterbury, or the Archbishop of Canterbury <i>ex officio</i> Prime Minister&#146;  (Anson, 11). Yet in so doing, he effectively subordinated clerical to lay authority; hence Tractarians suspected him of Erastianism. This also opened his establishment to all theists, including nonconformists, and that was distasteful to many other Anglicans. On the other hand his belief in the fact, but not the miracle, of the virgin birth&#151;similarly, his insistence that the resurrection of Christ represented no violation of natural law&#151;convinced evangelicals that he was dogmatically unsound. Finally, his profession of <span class="italic">The Gospel of the Secular Life</span> (1882), which understood Christianity to be no more (nor less) than the faithful fulfilment of common duties best expressed in terms of service to society generally and its victims particularly, may have nurtured a great Balliol tradition of Christian social thought, traceable from Arnold Toynbee to R. H. Tawney, but it simultaneously outraged the sensibilities of most contemporary protestant Englishmen.<br>
<br>Fremantle was a strikingly good-looking man: tall, well-built, long-faced, with a high forehead and distinguished by luxuriant sideburns. He was mild of manner and temperamentally guileless. Despite or perhaps because of this, he pursued a continually controversial career. Ordained in 1855, then placed in a college living in Lewknor, he soon began proceedings against All Souls for its failure to implement the competitive principle in fellowship elections set down by the university ordinance of 3 April 1857. Appealing first unsuccessfully to the visitor and then through queen's bench, Fremantle and his co-plaintiffs, Godfrey Lushington and Arthur Watson, won their case in 1864, effectively forging the prize fellowship which endures to this day. Whatever the college thought of this act of principled defiance, Bishop Tait of London was impressed. Accordingly, in 1861 he invited Fremantle to become resident chaplain at Fulham Palace. He also encouraged the young cleric to furnish historical justification for his own, similarly principled, support of the vindicated defendants in the famous <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span> case brought before the privy council. The result (jointly edited with George Brodrick) was <span class="italic">A collection of the judgments of the judicial committee of the privy council in ecclesiastical cases relating to doctrine and discipline</span> (1865), an enduring contribution to scholarship.<br>
<br>On 6 August 1863 Fremantle married Isabella Maria (<i>d</i>. 1901), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8393/', "Sir Culling Eardley, third baronet")</script>, the founder of the Evangelical Alliance. They had three sons and two daughters. Two years later he was appointed rector of St Mary's, Bryanston Square, London, a crown living. His seventeen years there, dedicated to achieving practical form for the ideal of a Christian community, either by doing good works among the poor with Octavia Hill or in the establishment of a parish council, both encouraging the widest local participation in general religious life, were probably the happiest of his career. At any rate, if he was honoured by his appointment as canon of Canterbury in 1882, he was compromised by his contemporaneous election as chaplain, fellow, and tutor of Balliol. In persuading Fremantle to assume these offices Jowett intended to blunt Tractarian domination of the new theology school. At least in Balliol, he succeeded. Fremantle, in turn, hoped to build up liberal theology in the university. Active opposition from the &#145;Pusey House&#146; wing of the faculty, coupled with Jowett's sly indifference, ensured that he failed. His Bampton lectures for 1883, published as <span class="italic">The World as the Subject of Redemption</span> (1885), fell on deaf ears. His article &#145;Theology in its changed conditions&#146; (<span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>, March 1887, 442&#150;59) was denounced from the university pulpit. He was debarred from lecturing on the English Reformation as one of the official theology faculty lecturers, and even forbidden by the rural dean of Oxford from holding an informal conference of theological tutors to promote religion among the undergraduates.<br>
<br>It was accordingly with relief that Fremantle accepted the deanery of Ripon in 1895. Here, to a degree at least, he prospered. With the active support of his bishop, Boyd Carpenter, he was able to turn the cathedral city into a liberal protestant stronghold. More still, he became something of a link between the broad-church theology of mid-nineteenth-century Oxford and the emerging modernist movement of early twentieth-century Anglicanism. He was a founder member of the Churchman's Union (For the Advancement of Liberal Religious Thought) in 1898, and contributed suitably modernist articles to house journals such as the <span class="italic">Church Gazette</span> (launched that year), the <span class="italic">Liberal Churchman</span> (from 1904), and the <span class="italic">Modern Churchman</span> (after 1911). He also organized the first Conference of Modern Churchmen, held appropriately enough at Ripon, in July 1914. All the while his writings continued alternately to stimulate and outrage: most notably a lecture &#145;Natural Christianity&#146;, delivered in 1902 and published in a longer version nine years later, which led to his being denounced in the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>.<br>
<br>As if this was not enough, Fremantle now increasingly pursued an informal third career as chief Anglican spokesman for international peace, a quest first begun with <span class="italic">Pleading Against War</span> (1885) and subsequently continued through numerous exhortations, pamphlets, and campaigns. He became an advocate for the international arbitration of disputes and a champion for mutual reductions in arms. His all too obvious failure in 1914 caused him great pain. Following the death of his first wife, he married, on 16 April 1903, Sophia Frances, daughter of Major T. G. Stuart. Fremantle died at his London home, 25 Barkston Gardens, South Kensington, on 24 December 1916, and was buried in Essendon, Hertfordshire, three days later. He was survived by his second wife and four of his children, who included Sir Francis Edward Fremantle (1872&#150;1943), a medical officer of health and Conservative MP, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94974/', "Henry Eardley Stephen Fremantle")</script>, a journalist and politician in South Africa.<br>
