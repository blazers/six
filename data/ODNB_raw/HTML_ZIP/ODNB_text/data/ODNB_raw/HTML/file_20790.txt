<span class="headword">Onslow,  George</span>, first earl of Onslow  (1731&#150;1814), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 13 September 1731, and baptized on 20 October 1731 at St Anne's, Soho, London, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20788/', "Arthur Onslow (1691&#150;1768)")</script>, speaker of the House of Commons, and his wife, Anne (1703&#150;1763), the daughter of John Bridges of Thames Ditton, Surrey. He was educated at Westminster School (from 1739) and Peterhouse, Cambridge (from 1749). On 26 June 1753 at Thames Ditton he married Henrietta (1731&#150;1809), the eldest daughter of Sir John Shelley (1692&#150;1771), of Michelgrove, Surrey, and his second wife, Margaret Pelham, the youngest daughter of Thomas Pelham, first Baron Pelham. They had four sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Onslow was brought into parliament for Rye, a Treasury borough, in April 1754 by the duke of Newcastle, who was his uncle by marriage. He declared that his election cost him &#145;not a single shilling save my moiety of the entertainment&#146;  (<span class="italic">Buckinghamshire MSS</span>, 520). At the general election in April 1761 he was returned for his father's seat of Surrey, which he continued to represent until his accession to the House of Lords. Newcastle had already provided him with the sinecure of outranger of Windsor Forest, worth &pound;400 a year, and in 1761 he was given the office of surveyor of the king's gardens and waters, which he described as &#145;a very genteel office&#146;. He lost both posts in 1763 during the &#145;massacre&#146; of Newcastle's followers, and he became an enthusiastic supporter of Pitt and Temple in opposition. He also supported Wilkes, presenting the latter's petition to the Commons in November 1763, and was active in opposition to the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span> in May 1765, when he seconded Rose Fuller's motion for making the queen regent and opposed Morton's motion for reinstating the name of the princess dowager. In June 1765 he urged Temple to accept the Treasury &#145;for the sake of the country&#146;, but a month later he took on the post of a lord of the Treasury on the formation of Lord Rockingham's first administration. He remained in office, however, on Rockingham's split with Chatham in November 1766, and thereby became one of Newcastle's men who placed their loyalty to government above loyalty to the whig party. He was admitted to the privy council on 23 December 1767.<br>
<br>In spite of his former friendship with Wilkes, on 14 April 1769 Onslow moved that Wilkes's fourth election for Middlesex was null and void, and on the following day he carried a resolution by a majority of fifty-four that Colonel Luttrell &#145;ought to have been returned&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cavendish's Debates</span>, 1.386). On 14 July 1769 he was accused in the <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span> by Horne Tooke of having accepted &pound;1000 to procure a place for a person in America. Onslow denounced the story as &#145;a gross and infamous lie from beginning to end&#146;, brought an action for libel against Tooke, and obtained damages for &pound;400, but judgment was arrested by the court of common pleas in Easter term 1771 on technical grounds.<br>
<br>Onslow became a prominent defender of the rights and privileges of the House of Commons, and on 25 January 1770 he opposed Dowdeswell's resolution that the house was bound on matters of election &#145;to judge according to the law of the land and the known and established law and custom of parliament&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 16.790&#150;91). In the same session he introduced a bill taking away all privileges of parliament from the servants of members, which, with the aid of Lord Mansfield in the House of Lords, became law (10 Geo. III, c. 50). When the members of the House of Commons were turned out of the House of Lords on 10 December 1770, Onslow, in retaliation, immediately proposed that the Commons should be &#145;cleared of strangers, members of the House of Lords, and all&#146;, but he voted against Dunning's motion for a committee to inspect the journals of the House of Lords. On 7 February 1771 he opposed Sir George Savile's attempt to bring in a bill for &#145;more effectually securing the rights&#146; of electors. In the same session he took an active part with his cousin and fellow MP <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20789/', "George Onslow (1731&#150;1792)")</script> in excluding strangers from the gallery of the House of Commons, and in calling the printers of newspapers to the bar of the house for publishing the debates. In April 1772 he supported a motion for leave to bring in a bill for the relief of protestant dissenters, and strongly advocated the propriety of granting them relief from subscription. On 8 July 1773 he was created DCL of Oxford University.<br>
<br>As his part in the Middlesex election controversy had made him unpopular with the county electors, Onslow retired from the seat for Surrey in 1774, though he retained his place at the Treasury until 1777. He was created Baron Cranley, in the county of Surrey, on 20 May 1776, and took his seat in the House of Lords on the following day. On 8 October of the same year he succeeded his cousin Richard as fourth Baron Onslow, and on 30 October was sworn in as lord lieutenant of Surrey. He spoke for the first time in the House of Lords on 16 April 1777, when he urged that some provision should be made for the discharge of the king's debts, and &#145;launched into encomiums of the personal and political virtues of the sovereign&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 19.163&#150;4). On 13 May 1778 he voted against the attendance of the House of Lords at Chatham's funeral, though he &#145;formerly used to wait in the lobby to help him on with his great-coat&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Horace Walpole</span>, 7.65). It was not surprising that Junius called him &#145;a false, silly fellow&#146;  (Junius, 1.198). He spent the rest of his career as a courtier. He was appointed comptroller of the household on 1 December 1777 and became treasurer of the household in December 1779 until his appointment as a lord of the bedchamber in September 1780, a post which he retained until his death.<br>
<br>During his father's lifetime Onslow had been heavily dependent on his official salary of &pound;1000 per annum and was reportedly in financial difficulties, but in 1768 he inherited his father's pension of &pound;3000, which he kept secret from his creditors. On succeeding to the Onslow title in 1776, he acquired estates reputed to be worth &pound;18,000 a year. He supported the <span class="roman">Fox&#150;North India Bill</span> at first, but, on discovering the king's wishes, voted against it when it was defeated in the Lords. He appears to have spoken for the last time in the Lords on 19 March 1788, when he supported the third reading of Pitt's <span class="roman">East India Declaratory Bill</span>.<br>
<br>Onslow was in the royal coach, in his capacity of lord-in-waiting, when the king was mobbed on his way to open parliament on 29 October 1795. The king calmed him down and gave him a stone thrown into the carriage on their return. Onslow served as colonel of the Surrey regiment of fencible cavalry from 23 May 1794 to 27 March 1800. In 1798 Tierney moved in the House of Commons for an inquiry into Onslow's conduct with regard to the manner in which the act to provide for the defence of the realm had been carried into effect in the county of Surrey, but the motion was lost by 141 votes to 22. Onslow, whom Walpole described as &#145;a noisy, indiscreet man&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 4.218), was created Viscount Cranley and earl of Onslow on 19 June 1801. His wife died on 27 May 1809, and Onslow himself died at his seat, Clandon Park, Surrey, on 17 May 1814, aged eighty-two. He was buried in Merrow church, near Guildford, on 22 May.<br>
<br>Onslow was succeeded by his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_20796"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Onslow</span>, second earl of Onslow  (1754&#150;1827), <span class="occ">politician and eccentric</span>, who was born on 15 March 1754 at Imber Court, Surrey. Commonly known as Tom Onslow, he was MP for Rye from 1775 to 1784, and for Guildford from 1784 to 1806. He married first, on 30 December 1776, Arabella (<i>d</i>. 1782), the third daughter and coheir of Eaton Mainwaring-Ellerker of Risby Park, Yorkshire, and his wife, Barbara; they had three sons and one daughter. Following Arabella's death, aged twenty-six, on 11 April 1782, he married, on 13 February 1783, Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1819), the daughter of William and Elizabeth Hale of King's Walden, Hertfordshire, and the widow of Thomas Duncombe of Duncombe Park, Yorkshire; they had only one child, a daughter.<br>
<br>Onslow was a crony of the prince of Wales and shared his passion for driving four-in-hand, which is commemorated in one of Gillray's caricatures and in the lines:<blockquote>
<div>What can little T. O. do?<br>
</div>
<div>Why, drive a phaeton and two!!<br>
</div>
<div>Can little T. O. do no more?<br>
</div>
<div>Yes, drive a phaeton and four!!!!<br>
</div> (T. Wright and R. H. Evans, <span class="italic">Historical and Descriptive Account of the Caricatures of James Gillray</span>, 1851, 463)</blockquote>Wraxall commented that he was short in stature, and &#145;destitute of any elegance or grace&#146; and that &#145;he passed the whole day in his phaeton, and sacrificed every object to the gratification of that &#147;ignoble ambition&#148;, as he himself called it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historical and Posthumous Memoirs</span>, 5.309&#150;10). Gronow recalled that he possessed &#145;four of the finest black horses in England [and] &hellip; his carriage was painted black, and the whole turn-out had more the appearance of belonging to an undertaker&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 2.113).<br>
<br>Onslow supported the Foxites, but rose in the Commons on very few occasions; in 1781 he presented a petition of &#145;a numerous body of the innholders of England&#146;, complaining of the billeting of soldiers on them. His most notorious service to the prince was his mission to Mrs Fitzherbert in 1784 to tell her that the prince had attempted suicide and that she must go to him to save his life. In December 1785 he accompanied the prince to Mrs Fitzherbert's house and stood guard, with a drawn sword, at the door while they were married in secret. Later, for reasons which are unknown, he fell out with the prince; he voted for Pitt's regency proposals in 1789, and against the abolition of the slave trade in 1796. He died on 22 February 1827, aged seventy-two, at Clandon Park.<br>
