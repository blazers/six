<span class="headword">Turner,  Eric</span>  (1918&#150;1980), <span class="occ">motorcycle manufacturer</span>, was born on 18 July 1918 at Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, the son of William Edmund Turner, headmaster, and his wife, Elsie Emma, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hartwell. He was educated at Chesterfield School, 5 miles from Staveley. Nothing else is known about the years prior to 1940, when he qualified as an accountant just after the outbreak of war. He was an associate and later a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants. Turner left accounting to join the Royal Army Service Corps as a driver. He served in France, and was briefly a staff sergeant, just before Dunkirk. By the age of twenty-six he was a lieutenant-colonel in command of 100 Dakotas and 3000 men airlifting troops into Burma to fight the Japanese in 1943&#150;4. In 1943 he married Zena Doreen Schellenberg, who died about 1973; they had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>On demobilization, Turner reverted to accountancy, joining the Blackburn aircraft company at Brough in Yorkshire as chief accountant despite his total lack of relevant experience. He became company secretary two years later and a director in 1950. He was made managing director at thirty-two, the youngest head of an aircraft company in the country. Although lacking in executive experience, he tried to get to know his staff and to weld them into a team. &#145;I am expert in nothing&#146;, he said  (Rae, 74&#150;7).<br>
<br>In 1959 Turner agreed to join the board of Birmingham Small Arms (BSA) and he became chief executive and deputy chairman on 1 January 1960. He absorbed the chairmanship in June 1961 when Jack Sangster retired. Shortly afterwards he served as president of the British Cycle and Motor Cycle Association, for the year 1962&#150;3. This was the time when a trade treaty was signed with Japan giving Japanese-made goods, including motorcycles, most favoured nation treatment in Britain without corresponding entry to the Japanese market. The industry protested fruitlessly but BSA, despite the managing director Edward Turner's visit to Japan in 1960, failed to act to meet the new threat.<br>
<br>Turner was the first chief executive of the BSA group following the reorganization associated with the dismissal of Sir Bernard Docker as chairman in 1956. He was picked specifically for his accountancy expertise, but as a man with no experience of the industry he was a remarkable choice, and he may have been headhunted at the suggestion of consultants Lazards and Deloitte, Plender; his appointment turned out to be a disastrous misjudgement. The group, with its head office in Small Heath, Birmingham, and 20,000 employees in factories around Britain, had 34 per cent of its sales in motorcycles, 15 per cent in Daimler cars and buses, 13 per cent in steel and titanium, and 21 per cent in small arms and engineering; Turner switched products, appointed new directors and executives, and introduced new functions such as research and personnel, but the changes upset rather than developed the organization's strengths.<br>
<br>Turner may have sought teamwork, &#145;a long broad view&#146;  (Ryerson, 171), and a &#145;consistent profitability&#146;  (Hopwood, 240, 243) but he was hardly successful. New men were brought in, many from the aircraft industry then in recession, rather than existing ones promoted, notably on the motorcycle side; one such was Lionel Jofeh. These newcomers were &#145;ignorant and unsympathetic to the problems of motorcycle design and production&#146;  (Smith, <span class="italic">DBB</span>) and the outcome was a series of unsuccessful models that reached the market too late in the season and were unacceptable. &#145;The decision that change was needed was right; the method of introducing it questionable; the outcome disastrous&#146;  (ibid.). Over &pound;1 million was lost in orders and returned motorcycles in 1967&#150;8, &pound;8 million in 1970&#150;71, and &pound;3 million in the following two years. Turner, after sacking Jofeh, resigned himself and BSA was forced to its knees, never to rise fully again.<br>
<br>To a degree the tension lay between the accountant and the engineer, the new thinking on value engineering, computerization, and research versus traditional, well-tried methods used by men who knew and loved motorcycles. For example, 300 newcomers were taken on in the research unit established at Umberslade Hall, with virtually no communication with the experienced staff at Small Heath 20 miles away. Ryerson described &#145;the management at BSA (as) very highly skilled, and &hellip; very bad&#146;  (Ryerson, 137&#150;40), concerned with making money but not with the means to do so. Ryerson saw BSA's collapse as the result of a &#145;quiet, steady merciless erosion of the company due to lack of true, deepseated commitment and sense of purpose in the manufacture of motorcycles&#146;  (ibid., 167).<br>
<br>Turner left BSA in 1971 aged fifty-two. He was already a director of English and Scottish Investors, and had been, until 1967, of Associated Electrical Industries. He was on the advisory council attached to the export credits guarantee department (1965&#150;70), on the Malta Industrial Development Board (1959&#150;65), and chairman of the finance committee of the University of Aston in Birmingham (1968&#150;76); Aston awarded him an honorary DSc when he left office. He was also chairman of the right-wing Economic League (1967&#150;72) and president of the Birmingham chamber of commerce (1971&#150;2), being concerned with the integration of midlands industry into the Common Market. He moved into the insurance brokerage business and became an underwriting member of Lloyds.<br>
<br>In 1974, shortly after the death of his first wife, Turner married Eileen Laura Svrljuga. Prior to leaving BSA, he had become a founder director of what is now the National Exhibition Centre, which opened just outside Birmingham in 1976. He served for ten years to 1979. In that year, Turner moved from Dale Cross Grange, Barnt Green, near Birmingham, where he had lived for many years, to live with his daughter at Windlesham in Surrey. Ill health may have caused the move, for he died of lung cancer at the age of sixty-two on 21 September 1980, at his daughter's house, at Lennoxwood, Westwood Road, Windlesham. The business career that had started so well when he was young terminated early and blighted.<br>
