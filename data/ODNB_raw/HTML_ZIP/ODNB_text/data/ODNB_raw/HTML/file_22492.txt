<span class="headword">Ponsonby, Lady  Emily Charlotte Mary</span>  (1817&#150;1877), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 17 February 1817 in Margaret Street, London, the third daughter of the six daughters and eight sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22500/', "John William Ponsonby, fourth earl of Bessborough (1781&#150;1847)")</script>, politician, and his wife, Lady Maria Fane (1787&#150;1834), the daughter of John Fane, tenth earl of Westmorland. The family was important in social and political circles; her brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22494/', "Frederick George Brabazon Ponsonby (1815&#150;1895)")</script>, who was to become the sixth earl of Bessborough, and she herself became Lady Emily upon the succession of her father to the earldom in 1844. She was also the niece of the author Lady Louisa Ponsonby, better known by her married name, Lady Lamb.<br>
<br>Relatively little is known of the life of Lady Emily Ponsonby. She was her father's eldest unmarried daughter, and consequently, upon the death of her mother, it fell to Lady Emily to manage his household and establishment at Bessborough, co. Kilkenny. She also acted in a vital capacity as his secretary, entrusted with much important political correspondence, as the illegibility of the earl's handwriting was notorious. A great deal of responsibility devolved upon her in the last three to four years of her father's life, as he found writing increasingly difficult after a serious fall from a horse, and his correspondence had grown with his assumption of the duties of the lord lieutenantship of Ireland (1846&#150;7).<br>
<br>Most of Lady Emily Ponsonby's &#145;gently didactic&#146; novels  (Blain, Clements &amp; Grundy, <span class="italic">Feminist comp.</span>, 863) were therefore published anonymously after the death of her father, but continued to draw upon her earlier life's exercise of filial duty. <span class="italic">The Discipline of Life</span> (1848) is typical, relating the story of two sisters in &#145;the trials and temptations of common life&#146;  (preface), and advocating self-sacrifice for women; a sequel, <span class="italic">Pride and Irresolution: a New Series of the Discipline of Life</span>, appeared in 1850. Her other works include: <span class="italic">Mary Gray, and other Tales and Verses</span> (1852), <span class="italic">Edward Willoughby</span> (1854), <span class="italic">The Young Lord</span> (1856), <span class="italic">Sunday Readings, Consisting of Eight Short Sermons Addressed to the Young</span> (1857), <span class="italic">A Mother's Trial</span> (1859), <span class="italic">Katherine and her Sisters</span> (1861), <span class="italic">Sir Owen Fairfax</span> (1866), and <span class="italic">A Story of Two Cousins</span> (1868). As some of the titles demonstrate, her fiction was largely set firmly within the upper classes; it challenged few conventions with its uniformly beautiful heroines and consistently happy endings. Her final novel, <span class="italic">Olivia Beaumont and Lord Latimer</span>, appeared in 1873.<br>
<br>Lady Emily Ponsonby should not be confused with another novelist of the same period, Catherine Ponsonby, who appears to have been no relation; Catherine Ponsonby's novels include the regional tales <span class="italic">The Border Wardens</span> (1844), and <span class="italic">The Desborough Family</span> (1845).<br>
<br>Lady Emily Ponsonby died of asthma and bronchitis on 3 February 1877 at her home, 3 Mount Street, Grosvenor Square, London.<br>
