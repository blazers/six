<span class="headword">Peebles,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1390/91), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Dunkeld</span>, is of unknown origins, though his name and early career suggest he was probably born and raised in the diocese of Glasgow. He attended the University of Paris from about 1351 to 1355, but did not obtain any formal legal degree before returning to serve in the court of, and as a legal official for, the bishop of Glasgow between 1355 and 1363. In 1363 he resumed his studies in France, and by June 1365 he had become a bachelor in both civil and canon law. By the time of his return to Scotland in 1368, moreover, he had obtained a doctorate in canon law. On his homecoming Peebles entered the service of David II and in 1369 he acted as the king's envoy to Rome, probably to represent the Scottish king in his divorce action against Queen Margaret. Peebles also enjoyed patronage from one of the most influential and powerful Scottish magnates of the time, William, first earl of Douglas; shortly before 13 March 1370 he was given charge of the church of Douglas, a benefice in the gift of the earl. After King David's death on 22 February 1371 Peebles passed into the service of his successor, Robert II. Peebles was identified as a royal clerk in the first parliament of Robert's reign and received a royal pension of 20 merks from November 1372 to early 1377. In September 1374 he was appointed to the archdeaconry of St Andrews previously held by William Grenlaw and in the following month succeeded Grenlaw as the collector of papal dues in Scotland. Between 11 February and 30 March 1377 Peebles was appointed chancellor of the kingdom, replacing John Carrick. He became bishop of Dunkeld in 1378 after first the death of Bishop Michael Monymusk in March 1377 and then the premature demise of Monymusk's elected successor, Andrew Umfray, at Rome between 1 July and 7 September 1377.<br>
<br>As chancellor, Peebles was a frequent witness to Robert II's charters and a regular auditor of the exchequer. He was also a very active diplomat, taking part in Anglo-Scottish negotiations in the 1370s and 1380s, while in September 1384 he and Cardinal Walter Wardlaw, bishop of Glasgow, represented the Scottish crown at a conference at Leulinghen in France which arranged a general cessation in Anglo-Scottish and Anglo-French hostilities until May 1385. While in France, Peebles and Wardlaw seem to have concluded the agreement which saw Jean de Vienne, the French admiral, lead an expeditionary force to Scotland in the summer of 1385 as part of a combined Franco-Scottish assault on northern England on the expiry of the Leulinghen truce. On the whole, Peebles appears to have been a highly competent and respected administrator, employed by successive rulers because of his expertise and reliability.<br>
<br>Political changes in Scotland during 1388, however, may have reduced Peebles's influence in the royal administration. In a parliament on 2&#150;7 April 1389 he was openly criticized for issuing letters of sasine in favour of Sir Malcolm Drummond, who was involved in a dispute with Archibald Douglas, lord of Galloway, over the inheritance of the second earl of Douglas, killed at the battle of Otterburn in August 1388. Archibald was an ally of Robert, earl of Fife, who had been appointed guardian of the kingdom on 1 December 1388. Peebles, on the other hand, may have been more sympathetic to the claims of Malcolm Drummond, the brother-in-law of the second earl and the son-in-law of the first earl of Douglas, one of Peebles's early patrons.<br>
<br>Peebles took part in another diplomatic mission in France in the final months of 1389, but had returned to Scotland by January 1390. On or about 18 March 1390 he demitted the office of chancellor, perhaps because of age or infirmity, and Alexander Cockburn appeared as custodian of the great seal. The last reference to Peebles suggests that he performed the coronation of Queen Annabella on 15 August 1390. He died before 1 February 1391, when Robert Sinclair, bishop of Orkney, was translated to the diocese of Dunkeld as his successor.<br>
