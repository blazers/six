<span class="headword">Sherwin,  William</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1645, <em>d.</em> in or after 1709), <span class="occ">engraver and inventor of a method of mezzotinting</span>, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25395/', "William Sherwin (1607&#150;1690)")</script>, a Church of England clergyman, and his wife, Dorothea Swan, was born at Wallington, Hertfordshire, where his father was rector, about 1645. Nothing is known of his training, and his first datable plate is a portrait prefixed to Richard Atkyns's <span class="italic">History of Printing</span> in 1664. He had established his own shop in London in Little Britain by 1669, when he published John Leeke's translation of Vignola, entitled <span class="italic">The Complete Architect</span>. From this time he seems hardly ever to have worked for another publisher. He published few books and hardly any plates made by other engravers.<br>
<br>1669 is the date on Sherwin's portrait of Charles II, which is the earliest dated mezzotint by an Englishman. The Latin dedication of this and its pair, a portrait of Queen Catherine, to Prince Rupert states that the process was revealed to the artist through the prince's kindness. James Granger, however, states that Sherwin had in fact discovered the secret for himself, using a loaded file to lay the ground. Since the method of laying the ground is the key to the process and had been Rupert's contribution to the development of the mezzotint, Rupert suspected that the secret had been betrayed by his servant. But Sherwin managed to disprove this, and Rupert instead helped him perfect his technique.<br>
<br>John Chaloner Smith lists twenty mezzotints made by Sherwin between 1669 and 1703, all of which are so rare that it is clear that Sherwin never managed to exploit the process, whose huge development from the end of the 1670s lay in the hands of others. Sherwin also made numerous portrait engravings, which have never been catalogued, as well as a handful of architectural plates and at least one landscape etching.<br>
<br>The number of Sherwin's prints apparently diminishes after 1676, the year in which he was awarded a patent for inventing a new method of printing calicoes. This seems to be the earliest date for calico printing in Europe, for the first Dutch factory at Amersfoort was only established two years later. Sherwin established a factory at West Ham Abbey in the Lea valley, and in 1696, in a petition in defence of the calico industry, he stated that he and his next neighbour employed about 400 men. He had a secondary factory in London, at Well Yard, near St Bartholomew's Hospital.<br>
<br>In 1672 Sherwin married Elizabeth, the daughter of Thomas Pride, one of Cromwell's aides, and his wife, who was a niece of General Monck. This link may have given him access to the capital he needed to establish such a large business. It certainly cannot have come from his print-making, for this never became a large affair. The quality of his work, although always competent, is not high, for he had no real ability in drawing. The Monck relationship led Sherwin and other relatives into a protracted lawsuit after the intestate death of the second duke of Albemarle in 1688, and the last evidence for Sherwin's being alive is a revival of the lawsuit in 1709.<br>
