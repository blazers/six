<span class="headword">Watts, Sir  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1550&#150;1616), <span class="occ">merchant and privateer</span>, was the son of Thomas Watts of Buntingford in Hertfordshire, where he was born. He married Margaret Hawes, daughter of Sir James Hawes, who was lord mayor of London from 1574 to 1575. They had eight children, four sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>During his early career Watts developed extensive trading interests with Spain, the Canary Islands, and the Azores. He was a founder member of the ill-fated Spanish Company of 1577, in which he served as an assistant and chief councillor. The development of these interests was cut short by the outbreak of the war with Spain in 1585; thereafter Watts turned his attention to privateering. He had ships at sea on voyages of reprisal throughout the war years, becoming the most important merchant-promoter of privateering in England. He sent squadrons of privateers to the Caribbean in 1588, 1590, 1591, 1592, 1594, and 1597. Four of his vessels were employed on Sir Francis Drake's voyage to the West Indies in 1595. In addition he contributed six vessels to the earl of Cumberland's Caribbean venture of 1598. He was an investor in several other important expeditions, including Drake's voyages to Spain and Portugal in 1587 and 1589, James Lancaster's voyage to Pernambuco in 1595, and John Chidley's abortive voyage to the South Seas in 1589. During the armada campaign of 1588 he served as a volunteer aboard his own ship, the <i>Margaret and John</i> of 200 tons, and was involved in some of the fiercest fighting off Calais. In 1597 he was also one of the promoters of an ambitious, but abortive, attempt to take over the Magdalen Islands at the mouth of the St Lawrence and establish English control over the walrus fishery.<br>
<br>Although Watts's Caribbean venture of 1590 was linked with the relief of the English colony at Roanoke, his main interests throughout the 1580s and 1590s were focused on privateering. The renown he earned in the business is confirmed by the Spanish ambassador's description of him, in 1607, as &#145;the greatest Pirate that has ever been in this Kingdom&#146;  (Brown, 1.99). Though unfair, there is no doubt that Watts, and the captains he employed on his ships, were often prepared to resort to unscrupulous methods in the search for plunder. Indeed, the seizure of neutral ships or cargoes involved him in several long-running and potentially expensive suits. Nevertheless, Watts reaped a rich reward from privateering. The 1591 expedition returned with prize goods that Watts estimated to be worth &pound;31,380, although their real value was probably nearer &pound;40,000. Not all of his ventures were as successful as this, but Watts was one of the few promoters to make a profit from privateering. By 1603 he was a wealthy man, with capital to spare for other commercial or colonial interests.<br>
<br>Despite his privateering interests, Watts never abandoned trade entirely. He became a member of the Levant Company in 1592. He was a member of the East India Company in 1600, and served as its second governor from 1601 to 1602. He also played a prominent role in the re-establishment of the Spanish Company in 1604. He became an active member of the Virginia Company of London, serving as a member of its council in 1609. In 1615 he was a founder member of the Somers Island Company.<br>
<br>Commercial success enabled Watts to become a prominent figure in the City corporation of London. A freeman of the Clothworkers' Company, he was an alderman from 1594 to 1616: representing Aldersgate ward from 1594 to 1601, Tower ward from 1601 to 1605, Aldersgate from 1605 to 1606, and Langbourn from 1606 to 1616. He served as sheriff from 1596 to 1597. In the later 1590s he was involved in the collection of money in the City for the redemption of English captives in Algiers. Although caught up in the earl of Essex's attempted uprising in the City in 1601 and removed to the Tower, there is no evidence to suggest that he was a party to the conspiracy. He was knighted on 26 July 1603, shortly after the coronation of James I. He was mayor of London from 1606 to 1607, and in that capacity entertained the king to dinner on 12 June 1607. In the last year of his life he was appointed colonel of the north regiment of trained bands, following their division into four regiments.<br>
<br>Watts died early in September 1616 and was buried at Ware, in Hertfordshire, on the 7th. He left the manor of Mardocks in Hertfordshire to his eldest son, John, and various bequests for the relief of the poor in his native village of Buntingford, as well as &pound;10 to Christ's and &pound;20 to St Thomas's hospitals in London. His son John followed him into the East India Company, becoming a &#145;seaman of great note&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP col.</span>, 1.97), who served in the naval expeditions to Cadiz in 1625 and the &Icirc;le de R&eacute; in 1627.<br>
