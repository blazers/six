<span class="headword">Williams, Sir  Dawson</span>  (1854&#150;1928), <span class="occ">medical editor</span>, was born on 17 July 1854 at Ulleskelf in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the eldest of the seven children of John Mack Williams, rector of Burnby, and his wife, Ellen, daughter of Nicolas Monsarrat, who was of Spanish and Huguenot descent. He was educated at Pocklington grammar school and University College Hospital, London, having been unable, probably for financial reasons, to attend Cambridge University. Williams had an outstanding career as a medical student and graduated MB, BCh (1879), and MD (1881). He was elected MRCS in 1878, MRCP in 1885, and FRCP in 1895. On qualifying he served briefly as house physician and ophthalmic and obstetric assistant at University College Hospital. He soon moved to the Victoria Hospital for Children and, later, the Brompton Hospital for Consumption. In 1884, after having considered a career in the Indian Medical Service, he took up the post of assistant physician at the East London Hospital for Children at Shadwell (he was full physician from 1894). A specialist in paediatrics, his only book, <span class="italic">Medical Diseases of Infancy and Childhood</span> (1898), dealt with this field.<br>
<br>In 1881, having obtained an introduction to Ernest Hart, the editor of the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span>, Williams took up medical journalism in order to supplement his income. In the following year he married Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1917), the daughter of Robert Kirkpatrick-Howat, of Mabie, Kirkcudbrightshire. They had one daughter. When Williams joined the <span class="italic">BMJ</span> it marked the beginning of a forty-seven-year association with the British Medical Association's medical weekly. Initially simply a contributor, he became the journal's hospital reporter in 1884, its principal sub-editor in 1886, and its assistant editor in 1895. All of these posts were held on a part-time basis while he built up a practice as a consulting physician and performed his hospital duties. As Hart's health failed in the 1890s, Williams became, in all but name, editor of the <span class="italic">BMJ</span>. With his predecessor's death, in January 1898, he formally assumed the editorship at an initial salary of &pound;650 per annum, with extra payments for contributions. The vacancy was not advertised and no other candidate was considered for the post. Hence Williams was the first <span class="italic">BMJ</span> editor appointed through internal promotion. In 1902, at the BMA's insistence, he resigned his hospital appointment and became the journal's first full-time editor. He held the post for three decades, relinquishing it only shortly before his death. No other <span class="italic">BMJ</span> editor before or since has had such a long tenure of office.<br>
<br>Unlike his predecessor Williams had little interest in social medicine or medical politics. He believed the journal's prime function was to nurture medical science or, as he put it, have &#145;post-graduation training brought to the practitioner's door&#146;  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 10 March 1928, 422). Under his influence the <span class="italic">BMJ</span>'s scientific standing, already high when he became editor, was further enhanced, particularly in the early 1900s when it carried numerous ground-breaking papers, by such luminaries as William Gowers, Victor Horsley, Almroth Wright, William Leishmann, and Patrick Manson. In terms of campaigning journalism, Williams's main target was the highly profitable trade in quack medicine. Yet, as later became embarrassingly plain, the <span class="italic">BMJ</span>'s own advertising pages were themselves full of advertisements for proprietary medicines. The First World War provided one of Williams's greatest challenges as editor. A decline in advertising revenue, coupled with spiralling costs, paper shortages, and the destruction of the premises in which the journal was printed, all made for a testing time. By 1917, the year of his wife's death, Williams was without any editorial assistance. Nevertheless, no <span class="italic">BMJ</span> issue was lost, and editorial standards were sustained, not least through an outstanding series of articles on medicine and surgery on the western front. After the war Williams's achievements, not least as a prominent member of the BMA's medical war committee, were recognized by the conferment of several honours. He became CBE in 1919, and in 1921, &#145;too late to do any good&#146; as he once observed  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 10 March 1928, 417), he was awarded a knighthood. Also in 1921 the BMA conferred its gold medal of merit upon him. Williams received honorary degrees from the universities of Sheffield, Glasgow, and Durham. Had he retired in 1918 his editorship could have been counted an outstanding success. However, afraid of enduring a long retirement, he stayed on for another decade, during which time the journal became somewhat staid and unimaginative.<br>
<br>Williams ran the <span class="italic">BMJ</span> as a benevolent dictatorship. R. Scott Stevenson, a sub-editor who worked with him in the 1920s &#145;never lost the feeling in his presence that I was a schoolboy up in front of the headmaster&#146;  (Stevenson, <span class="italic">Goodbye Harley Street</span>, 83). Until illness, including recurrent bouts of bronchitis, took its toll, Williams cut an imposing figure, being well over 6 feet tall. For a while he suffered from an &#145;acute neurosis&#146;, which prevented him from working, and in July 1910 he suffered serious injuries, including a fractured leg, in a road traffic accident near Horsham. These confined him to a nursing home for six weeks. However, when he recovered he was cured of the neurosis. In 1920 heart problems were diagnosed and he was given only two weeks to live. Although he confounded this prognosis he continued to experience cardiac irregularity. In 1927, when he was in his seventy-third year, the BMA decided it was time to appoint a new editor. Williams, however, was unwilling to relinquish a position he had held for so long; he was persuaded to retire on 19 January 1928&#151;the thirtieth anniversary of his appointment&#151;only by the inducements of three months' salary in lieu of notice and a grant of &pound;1000 in compensation for loss of office. His remuneration at the time of retirement was &pound;2000 per annum, though with no additional payments for articles, this practice having been abolished during the war. His departure was marked by a leading article in <span class="italic">The Times</span> (2 January 1928). Williams died of heart failure on 27 February 1928 at his country home, Well End, near Bourne End in Buckinghamshire. His funeral took place at Little Marlow cemetery on 2 March.<br>
