<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Long,  George</span>  (1800&#150;1879), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born at Poulton, Lancashire, on 4 November 1800, the eldest of four children of James Long, a West Indies merchant, and his wife, Isabel Brodbelt. Educated at Macclesfield grammar school, he wanted to enter the army, but on the death of his father it was decided that he should seek his fortune at Cambridge, where he entered Trinity College as a sizar in 1818. In 1821 he was bracketed Craven scholar with T. B. Macaulay and Henry Malden. He graduated BA in 1822 as thirtieth wrangler and senior chancellor's medallist; in 1823 he was members' prizeman, and gained a fellowship at Trinity over the heads of Macaulay and Malden. In 1824 he was chosen professor of ancient languages in the new University of Virginia where Thomas Jefferson (third president of the United States) was rector. Long was a frequent guest of Jefferson who called him &#145;the boy professor&#146;. He developed a deep love for America, marrying there in 1827 Harriet <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gray (<i>d</i>. 1841), widow of Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Selden, judge of the supreme court of Arkansas. They had four sons and a daughter who died in infancy.<br>
<br>In 1828, at the invitation of Lord Brougham, Long returned to England as professor of Greek in the newly founded University of London (afterwards University College, London). His 1830 lectures, published as <span class="italic">Observations on the Study of the Latin and Greek Languages</span>, are of interest as an early instance of the use of the comparative method in classical philology. Long held the Greek chair until August 1831 when he resigned in protest at the dismissal of Professor G. S. Pattison and became editor of the radical <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of Education</span> (10 vols., 1831&#150;5), published by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (SDUK), of whose committee Long was an active member. He made the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal</span> a champion for the reform of secondary education, attacking the public schools and calling for new schools to meet the needs of the middle classes. He was later a supporter of the Central Society of Education. Long had a special interest in geography. In 1830 he was one of the founders of the Royal Geographical Society and was for many years a member of the council, serving as honorary secretary from 1846 to 1848. He wrote a paper on its teaching to <span class="italic">The Schoolmaster</span> (1836), and contributed to volumes 3 and 12 of the Royal Geographical Society's <span class="italic">Journal</span>, and to William Smith's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography</span>. He edited for the SDUK <span class="italic">The Geography of America and the West Indies</span> (1841) and wrote with G. R. Porter <span class="italic">The Geography of Great Britain</span> (1850). His <span class="italic">Atlas of Classical Geography</span> (1854) and smaller <span class="italic">Grammar School Atlas of Classical Geography</span> became standard works.<br>
<br>From 1833 to 1846 Long was engaged on the laborious task of editing for the SDUK the twenty-nine volumes of the <span class="italic">Penny Cyclopaedia</span>. He was himself an extensive contributor and an unwearied editor, the regular issue of the monthly parts being never interrupted. He simultaneously contributed to the SDUK's <span class="italic">Biographical Dictionary</span> (7 vols., 1842&#150;4; the letter &#145;A&#146; only). In 1842 Long became professor of Latin in University College, in succession to his great friend and former colleague at Virginia, Thomas Hewitt Key. He resigned the chair in 1846, and for a short time was lecturer on jurisprudence and civil law in the Middle Temple, having been called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1837. He wrote all the articles on Roman law in William Smith's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities</span> (1842) and published in 1847 <span class="italic">Two Discourses on Roman Law</span>. In his knowledge of Roman law he stood alone among English scholars of his time, and he contributed greatly to the revival of its study in England. But that lay in the future.<br>
<br>Exasperated by the indifference of his students, who were not then obliged to attend law lectures, and by the lack of encouragement which the Middle Temple authorities gave to his teaching, Long became a schoolmaster. From 1849 until midsummer 1871 he held the position of classical lecturer at Brighton College, a new school founded on progressive lines. There he found his m&eacute;tier, applying the principles he had advocated in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal</span>. He used visual aids and insisted that a classical author be read as a modern one. An inspiring teacher, he was revered and held in affection by his pupils. He established for the infant school a formidable reputation in classical scholarship. Those years also produced his most important books. He edited various Latin texts, notably for the <span class="roman">Grammar School Classics</span> series. In conjunction with Brighton's principal, Revd Arthur J. Macleane (<i>d</i>. 1858), he established and edited the <span class="roman">Bibliotheca Classica</span>, contributing himself an edition of Cicero's <span class="italic">Orations</span> (4 vols., 1851&#150;8). He also published an admirable translation of Marcus Aurelius with the title <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Emperor M. Aurelius Antonius</span> (1862) and began the publication of his reflective but vigorous <span class="italic">Decline of the Roman Republic</span> (5 vols., 1864&#150;74). In his <span class="italic">Essays in Criticism</span> Matthew Arnold praised Long for treating Roman history &#145;not as a dead and dry matter of learning&#146;, but as having &#145;a side of modern applicability and living interest&#146;. During the American Civil War Long staunchly supported the South and the 1869 edition of his <span class="italic">Marcus Aurelius</span> commended Robert E. Lee. Later Long urged Lee &#145;to write his &#147;Commentaries&#148; to stand beside those of Caesar&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1871 Long retired to Portfield, near Chichester, &#145;to tend my little garden and rose trees&#146;. He lived a frugal life with his parrot George, his dog Caesar, and his housekeeper, Esther Lawrence, who was an executor of his will and is buried in his grave. In 1873 he was granted a civil-list pension of &pound;100 a year for his services to learning. He once confessed that &#145;I live for my pen&#146;, but in old age complained ruefully that it &#145;never made me a living&#146;; at one time his Cambridge medal was in pawn. Although he was said to have married three times, it is probable that he was only married twice; his second wife, of German extraction, ran off with one of his Brighton College pupils. Long died on 10 August 1879 at 2 Rhine Villas, Portfield, near Chichester, after six months' illness. He was buried at Portfield cemetery. A memorial tablet was erected at Brighton College, and a scholarship established there in his memory.<br>
<br>As a teacher and writer Long exercised much influence on classical scholarship in England, which he wanted to save from &#145;dusty pedantry&#146;. He was a man of extensive learning, gifted with a powerful memory and &#145;a clear judicial intellect&#146;. He was even more remarkable for a rare simplicity, elevation, and integrity of life. &#145;No one&#146;, an obituarist remarked, &#145;ever lived the life recommended by Marcus Aurelius more completely&#146;  (<span class="italic">Spectator</span>, 23 Aug 1879).<br>
