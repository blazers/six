<span class="headword">Read,  Katharine</span>  (1723&#150;1778), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born on 3 February 1723 in Dundee, Forfarshire, the daughter of Alexander Read of Turfbeg, a Dundee merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wedderburn (1699&#150;1756), daughter of Sir John Wedderburn, baronet. The family's strong Jacobite connections and the ensuing failure of the 1745 rising may have been a contributing factor in the decision to send her to Paris in 1745 to study crayon painting under Maurice-Quentin de La Tour. She remained in Paris until 1751, when she moved to Rome with the financial support of her brother, Captain Alexander Read. Her chaperone was the Abb&eacute; Peter Grant, the Roman agent for the Catholic church in Scotland. It was through the Abb&eacute; Grant's connections that she was able to establish a clientele from the Italian aristocracy and the transient British expatriate community who were in Rome on the grand tour. She was hopeful that her stay in Rome would enable her to establish herself as a professional artist in Britain, stating in a letter of 1752 to her brother, &#145;I have staid one year in Rome for Improvement, I must certainly stay in it another for Name, and then you'll see I'll top it with the best of them&#146;  (K. Read to A. Read, 6 Jan 1752, priv. coll.).<br>
<br>Read returned to Britain and set up her studio in London in 1753, establishing a reputation as one of the most fashionable portrait painters in crayon which she sustained for over twenty years. Inevitably she was compared to her male counterparts, as one critic stated: &#145;After <i>Cotes</i>, our best painter in crayons, (and perhaps the only good one) is Miss Read. She likewise paints very well in oil. Her pencilling is free and easy, and her colouring has a great deal of truth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Observations on the Pictures now in Exhibition at the Royal Academy, Spring Gardens, and Mr Christie's</span>, 1771, 6). She painted members of the royal family, including <span class="italic">A Portrait of her Majesty [Queen Charlotte] with the Prince of Wales</span> (exh. Free Society of Artists, 1763) and <span class="italic">The Two Young Princes of Wales</span> (exh. Free Society of Artists, 1765) which depicts the prince of Wales with his brother, Frederick. An example of her oil painting is <span class="italic">The Countess of Sussex</span> (Ranger's House, Greenwich, London). An indication of the prices paid for her work is revealed in a letter of 1772: 12 guineas for a Madonna; 20 guineas for a portrait in crayon; 35 guineas for a half-length portrait in oils  (Read to Lord (?), 17 Feb 1772, priv. coll.). She also appears to have had connections with literary circles, painting the actor David Garrick and executing two portraits of his wife, Eva Maria Garrick (Victoria and Albert Museum, London).<br>
<br>Katharine Read remained unmarried and lived for some years with her niece, Helena Beatson. Beatson demonstrated much artistic talent, a fact noted by Frances Burney on one of her visits to Read's studio  (<span class="italic">Early Diary</span>, 284). In February 1777 Read, accompanied by her niece, travelled to India in the hope of establishing a practice for herself in Madras. In October 1777 Helena Beatson married Sir Charles Oakley, bt, governor of Madras. With her health failing, Read set sail for the Cape in 1778, and <i>en route</i> died on a Dutch ship on 15 December 1778; she was buried at sea. Her will of 1777, revised on 29 January 1778, details her substantial assets, accrued through her earnings as a professional crayon painter.<br>
