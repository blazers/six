<span class="headword">Widmore,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1681, <em>d.</em> 1764), <span class="occ">historian and librarian</span>, was baptized on 27 June 1681 at St Michael's, Warfield, Berkshire, the son of Christopher Widmore, a bailiff, of Kingsclere in Hampshire, and his wife, Elizabeth. He attended Sedbergh School from about 1693 until 1698 when he was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge. He graduated BA in 1702, MA in 1708.<br>
<br>Widmore was ordained priest by the bishop of London in September 1705 and served as curate at St James's, Dukes Place, in the City of London. By 1711 he was serving as curate of St Margaret's, Westminster, and it was doubtless at this period that he first became familiar with the monastic archive of Westminster Abbey and with its chapter library. In December 1731 the abbey's librarian, Thomas Moore, who had held office for over forty years, was given leave to appoint Widmore as his deputy, doubtless with an understanding that the latter would succeed him. Moore died two years later and Widmore's appointment as librarian was confirmed by the dean and chapter in February 1734. For the next twenty-five years Widmore devoted his efforts to the study of the abbey's history and to the care of its books and records. Hitherto the dean and chapter's library had grown almost exclusively by donation and bequest, but Widmore began to purchase books too, making substantial and important additions to the collections in the course of his custodianship.<br>
<br>About 1735 Widmore began to examine and sort the abbey's records, compiling a catalogue which was finally completed in 1741. From this labour emerged his two publications, both significant contributions to the historiography of Westminster and the first printed accounts to draw their conclusions directly from the original sources. <span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Time of the First Foundation of Westminster Abbey</span> appeared in 1743 and refuted the then widely held notion that Westminster owed its foundation to King Sebert in the early seventh century. In <span class="italic">An History of the Church of St. Peter, Westminster</span>, published by subscription in 1751, Widmore provided a more substantial history of the institution, carried down to his own time. An appendix contained transcribed documents and lists of officials.<br>
<br>Widmore also devoted much time to the salvaged collections of the Cotton Library which were still stored at Westminster following the fire at Ashburnham House in 1731. He paid particular attention to the charters, and his reports were heavily relied upon by the committee of trustees of the newly formed British Museum when it surveyed the collections in 1754. The following year, at the request of the trustees, he spent four months cataloguing the 3800 volumes bequeathed to the Cottonian Library by Arthur Edwards (<i>d</i>. 1743). In 1756 Widmore was recommended to be one of the librarians of the new museum, but he was never appointed to that office.<br>
<br>Widmore corresponded with the antiquarian Browne Willis and with the biographer John Ward, sending to the latter amendments for a second edition of <span class="italic">Lives of the Professors of Gresham College</span>. In spite of these and other scholarly connections he was never a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and his letters (which survive in the British Library) convey little impression of his character beyond that of a studious man, generous with information gleaned from the records in his care.<br>
<br>On 12 May 1760 Widmore preached at the first of two services for the bicentenary of Westminster's foundation as a collegiate church. In the same year he was appointed rector of Lasham in Hampshire where he lived quietly in retirement though retaining both his post and his house at Westminster. He was unmarried. He died at Lasham on 9 November 1764 and was buried there, probably in the chancel, on 15 November. The church at Lasham was completely rebuilt in the nineteenth century and no gravestone or monument has survived. In his will Widmore bequeathed more than forty books to the library at Westminster and there appears to be no foundation for John Nichols's assertion that his private library was sold in 1765.<br>
