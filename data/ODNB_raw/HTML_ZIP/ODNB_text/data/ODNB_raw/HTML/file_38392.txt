<span class="headword">Woodyer,  Henry</span>  (1816&#150;1896), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in Guildford, Surrey, in August 1816, the youngest of three children and the only son of Caleb Woodyer (1766&#150;1849), a surgeon and accoucheur, and his wife, Mary Ann Eleanor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Halsey (1788&#150;1864). He was educated at Eton College (1829&#150;35) and then at Merton College, Oxford (1835&#150;8). After a brief period working in the office of William Butterfield, Woodyer set up in business on his own at 4 Adam Street in London's Adelphi. He married Frances Martha Bowles (1830&#150;1852) on 5 August 1851; she died in childbirth on 21 June of the following year, leaving Woodyer and an infant daughter, Hester Fanny. Together father and daughter moved to Grafham Grange near Dunsfold in Surrey, and became constant companions for the next thirty-nine years.<br>
<br>The majority of Woodyer's clients were, like him, devout &#145;high&#146; Anglicans. Many of his early commissions were from family friends and associates. Thereafter his clients were often his own friends, whom he had met at Eton and Oxford. He developed an image of self-confidence and stand-offishness, and, at Grafham, lived the life of a rather bohemian and mildly eccentric cultured country gentleman. He smoked fragrant cigars, carried his drawings in a rolled up umbrella, and wore a loose-fitting blue serge suit, a crimson tie, a soft black hat, and a long dark Inverness cloak. Though never rich, he enjoyed the pleasures of life, and for relaxation sailed his yacht&#151;the <i>Queen Mab</i>&#151;in the Mediterranean. His architecture is as distinctive as his image. Yet while his best designs are full of imaginative touches, his style is somehow neurotic. He was always keen to strike out, to exaggerate, to be idiosyncratic, especially in his use of narrow windows, extra-steep roofs, peculiar dormer windows, acute arches, and slightly odd proportions. Even the details of his designs have a tense, agitated quality, undue prominence being given to unimportant details, to nervy lines, and to spiky tracery. But there is also originality, especially in his spires, chancel screens, and mechanical font covers. Even his restorations are original, with distinctive touches in place of an emphasis on the copying of ancient work.<br>
<br>Woodyer's most notable designs are for the churches at Highnam in Gloucestershire (Holy Innocents, 1849&#150;51), Christ Church in Reading (1861&#150;2 and 1874&#150;5), and the restoration of All Saints', Wokingham (1862&#150;4). He was also responsible for designing buildings for a number of religious communities, including the House of Mercy at Bovey Tracey in Devon (1865&#150;8), a similar establishment at Clewer (1854&#150;82), the Community of All Hallows at Ditchingham in Norfolk (1859&#150;64), St Peter's Convent at Horbury in the West Riding of Yorkshire (1862&#150;4), and All Saints' Hospital at Eastbourne (1869&#150;70). Beyond that his output was mainly connected with churches&#151;new and restored&#151;parsonages, and local schools, though he also designed Cranleigh School (1863&#150;5)&#151;the quadrangle and chapel in an asymmetrical form of Tudor&#151;and was responsible for certain minor extensions and restorations at Eton (1857&#150;60 and 1876&#150;7). He also maintained a sizeable country house practice.<br>
<br>Woodyer's daughter married in 1891, and two years later he moved to Padworth Croft, near Reading. He died there of heart failure on 10 August 1896 and was buried four days later in Grafham churchyard.<br>
