<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Taunt,  Henry William</span>  (1842&#150;1922), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born in Penson's Gardens, St Ebbe's, Oxford, on 14 June 1842, the only son of Henry Taunt (<i>c</i>.1821&#150;1882), a plumber and glazier, and his wife, Martha Darter (<i>c</i>.1813&#150;1886). He was educated at Penson's Gardens Sunday school and St Ebbe's national school and also at the church school in West Ilsley, Berkshire, his mother's home village. After leaving school about 1852, he worked with his father and in several shops in Oxford before joining Edward Bracher, an early Oxford photographer, in 1856. He started as a basic utility hand and took his first photograph, a group in Exeter College quad, about 1858. When Bracher sold his business to Wheeler and Day, the High Street stationers, in 1863, Taunt became their photographic manager. On 17 September 1863 he married Miriam Jeffrey (1837/8&#150;1929), an Oxford dressmaker, the daughter of Stephen Jeffrey, a gardener; the couple had no children.<br>
<br>In 1868 Taunt set up as a photographer on his own account, opening a small but central shop at 33 Cornmarket Street in 1869. His photographs of the Oxford area and the River Thames soon attracted praise and he publicized them through magic-lantern lectures and in his book, <span class="italic">A New Map of the River Thames</span> (1872), which included paste-down prints and his own survey of the river between Oxford and London. In 1874 he moved to larger premises at 9&#150;10 Broad Street and he had a branch at Easton Street in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, between about 1875 and 1889. In 1889 Taunt leased Canterbury House in Cowley Road, renamed it Rivera after the River Thames, and established his main photographic and printing works in the grounds. A dispute over renewal of the lease of his Broad Street shop forced Taunt into bankruptcy in 1895 with debts which he estimated at over &pound;3000. He moved his central premises to 41 High Street and later to no. 34 but, from 1906, he operated solely from Rivera. By 1922 he had amassed over 60,000 negatives, though his assistants, notably Randolph Adams, took many of the later photographs. In his later years he became a prolific author of local histories and guidebooks, publishing over fifty titles; he also diversified into printing and became a major publisher of picture postcards. Between 1893 and 1906 he was a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society.<br>
<br>Taunt was a tall, distinguished-looking man with a full beard, almost invariably seen wearing nautical garb and a yachting cap. He was a competent musician and was at one time organist and choir leader at St Mary Magdalen Church in Oxford; his sense of fun was demonstrated by humorous poetic jingles and annual children's entertainments but he was also a fierce campaigner, battling for clean city water in 1880 and against electric tramways in 1906. A Conservative nationally, he deplored local party politics and stood unsuccessfully as an independent candidate for the city council's west ward in 1880 and 1881. He never suffered fools gladly and was convicted of assault in 1878 after a fight with an apprentice. Henry Taunt died at Rivera on 4 November 1922 and was buried on 9 November in Rose Hill cemetery, Church Cowley Road, Cowley; his wife survived him. Like many other nineteenth-century photographers, Taunt documented the local urban and rural scene but his artistic temperament and historian's eye raised his work on to a higher plane and gave it an enduring appeal.<br>
