<span class="headword">Robertson, Sir  Robert</span>  (1869&#150;1949), <span class="occ">chemist and explosives expert</span>, was born on 17 April 1869 at Cupar, Fife, the eldest of four children, and the only son, of John Alexander Robertson, dentist, and his wife, Euphemia, daughter of Andrew Russell, a farmer of Balmerino, Fife.<br>
<br>Educated at Madras Academy (the Bell&#150;Baxter School), Cupar, and St Andrews University, where he graduated in both arts and science (1890), Robertson was for a short time an assistant in the laboratory of the Glasgow city analyst. In 1892 he was appointed to the staff of the royal gunpowder factory at Waltham Abbey, where the military were in the process of introducing smokeless nitro- compounds as explosive replacements for black powder. He made a study of the chemistry of nitrocellulose and ethylene glycol dinitrate, and successfully incorporated the results into his doctoral thesis at St Andrews in 1897.<br>
<br>As chemist in charge of the laboratory of the factory from 1900, Robertson studied the purification of gun cotton (nitrocellulose), and developed an improved method that allowed greater stability of cordite, the propellant used in British ammunition. He became an acknowledged expert on the stability of explosives, and in 1906 he accompanied Sir Frederic Lewis Nathan on a mission to investigate explosions which had occurred in magazines in India. In 1903 he married Kathleen (<i>d</i>. 1938), daughter of Hugh Hutton Stannus, a lecturer in applied art at South Kensington and Manchester.<br>
<br>Robertson was appointed in 1907 as superintending chemist of the research department at Woolwich arsenal, at a time when defects in ammunition used during the South African War were being studied. During the following years he organized very wide investigations of old and new explosives, their stability, power, and sensitivity, including particularly tetryl and trinitrotoluene (TNT). During the First World War he was responsible for the development of the manufacture and use of TNT, and of the explosive mixture &#145;amatol&#146;, which made possible a much larger and cheaper supply of high explosive. Another vital development was his introduction of an alcohol&#150;ether mixture in place of acetone, which was scarce, in the production of propellants.<br>
<br>In 1921 Robertson was appointed government chemist. The work of his department, which provided chemical advice and services to other departments (particularly the board of customs and excise), was considerably increased between 1921 and 1936 by the introduction of various new import duties, and by legislation involving chemical control. Robertson placed much emphasis on promoting independent research activity among staff of the laboratory. As an innovation, he introduced occasional seminars at which staff (including himself) would read research papers. These meetings, held after hours, were not popular and were abolished soon after he left. He also served on numerous government committees.<br>
<br>During this period Robertson pursued important fundamental research. In collaboration with John Jacob Fox, who succeeded him as government chemist, he made a detailed study of the infra-red absorption of the gases ammonia, phosphine, and arsine and interpreted the main features of their spectra. This pioneering work stimulated the growth of infra-red spectroscopy both in Britain and abroad. Subsequently he made a detailed examination of the infra-red and Raman spectra of diamonds, of which a certain proportion showed several abnormal physical properties.<br>
<br>After his retirement from the government laboratory in 1936, Robertson continued his experimental work at the Royal Institution, of which he was treasurer. In 1937 he became director of the Salters' Institute of Industrial Chemistry.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of war in 1939 Robertson rejoined the research department at Woolwich and was placed in charge of a major branch at University College, Swansea, where he directed general chemical work on explosives and was at the same time chairman of several government committees.<br>
<br>Robertson was a man of great personal vigour. Described as &#145;a broad-shouldered man of small stature &hellip; with a deep voice&#146;  (Hammond and Egan, 205), he was an able administrator who worked hard and expected his staff to do the same, but his domineering temperament made him unpopular. He had a wide range of interests, and was an active supporter of scientific societies both national and international. He held office twice as vice-president of the Chemical Society, was president of the Faraday Society (1922&#150;4), and vice-president of the Institute of Chemistry. He also presided over the chemistry section of the British Association at Toronto in 1924. Robertson was elected FRS in 1917 and received the society's Davy medal in 1944. He was appointed KBE in 1918, and received the honorary degree of LLD from St Andrews University in 1923.<br>
<br>Robertson died at his home, 51 Bedford Court Mansions, Bedford Square, Bloomsbury, London, on 28 April 1949, as a result of influenza and broncho-pneumonia. He was survived by one son and one daughter.<br>
