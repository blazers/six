<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thomson, Sir  William</span>  (1678&#150;1739), <span class="occ">judge</span>, born in London, was the second son of Sir William Thompson (<i>d</i>. 1695), king's serjeant-at-law, and his wife, Mary Stephens. He received his early education at Brentwood grammar school before matriculating at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1691, where he took a BA in 1695. Both William and his elder brother, Stephen (later attorney-general of Virginia), had already been entered at the Middle Temple in 1688, and he was called to the bar there in 1698. On 16 February 1701 he was married to Joyce Brent, a widow, of St Clement Danes, Middlesex. He became recorder of Ipswich in 1707, and was returned to parliament for Orford, another Suffolk borough, on 29 January 1709.<br>
<br>Although a relative newcomer to parliament, in March 1710 Thomson took a prominent part in the whig-inspired impeachment of Dr Henry Sacheverell, being principally responsible for the Commons' case on the third article (that Sacheverell had declared the Church of England was in danger under the present administration). He clearly gave satisfaction, because immediately afterwards he was also retained as junior counsel in the proceedings against some ringleaders of the riots inspired by Sacheverell's cause. While such a high profile resulted in the loss of his parliamentary seat at the general election which followed, Thomson capped the year by marrying on 4 November an heiress&#151;Julia, daughter of Sir Christopher Conyers, baronet, of Horden Durham, and widow of Sir William Blackett, baronet, of Newcastle upon Tyne, and said to have a fortune &#145;upwards of &pound;20,000&#146;  (Luttrell, 6.651). He was returned again for Ipswich in September 1713, and although unseated on petition, 1 April 1714, regained the seat at the first election after the accession of George I, and continued to hold it until he became a judge.<br>
<br>As a reliable whig lawyer and parliamentarian Thomson was useful to the new Hanoverian regime, and in March 1716 he acted as one of the Commons' managers at the trial of the Jacobite earl of Wintoun. In the preceding year (3 March 1715) he had succeeded Sir Peter King as recorder of London, a position of considerable political and professional importance, which involved regular attendance on the Old Bailey bench and reports to the king in cabinet about the eligibility of condemned criminals for pardons. Shortly afterwards he was knighted, and in February 1717 he also became solicitor-general. By his unique combination of these offices he appears to have had a major impact on the administration of criminal law in the capital, for he introduced into parliament the <span class="roman">Transportation Act</span> of 1718 (4 Geo. I c. 11), a measure which created an effective form of secondary punishment by providing for the transportation of non-capital and pardoned convicts to the colonies, and also included provisions against the kind of trade in organized property crime which was then being carried on by Jonathan Wild. Two years later he promoted another statute (6 Geo.I c. 23), which established arrangements for financing the carriage of the convicts across the Atlantic.<br>
<br>Despite these successes, in 1720 Thomson overreached himself in the House of Commons by accusing the attorney-general, Nicholas Lechmere, who was a privy councillor, of benefiting corruptly from fees for matters referred to the attorney by the council. After some witnesses had been heard the charges were voted &#145;malicious, false, and scandalous&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 7.644), and on the following day Thomson's patent as solicitor-general was revoked. In fact the main reason for his dismissal seems to have been his association with the ousted Walpole&#150;Townshend group of whigs, which he had signalled in 1719 by voting against the ministry's <span class="roman">Peerage Bill</span> in the House of Commons. He continued as recorder of London, however, and in 1724, after the return of Walpole and Townshend to office, he received a patent giving him precedence in court after the law officers of the crown, with a pension of &pound;1200 a year. This may have been reward for services rendered at the Old Bailey, where he remained an important member of the bench, playing a significant role in the final conviction of Wild in 1725. Further promotion followed, first in the shape of the administrative place of cursitor baron of the exchequer (1726), and finally in November 1729, when he became one of the judicial barons of the exchequer. Remarkably he continued to hold the recordership at the Old Bailey, and died in possession of both offices on 27 October 1739, at Bath. Both his marriages were childless.<br>
