<span class="headword">Strong,  Philip Nigel Warrington</span>  (1899&#150;1983), <span class="occ">archbishop of Brisbane</span>, was born on 11 July 1899 at the vicarage, Sutton on the Hill, Derbyshire, the third son of John Warrington Strong (<i>d</i>. 1942), Church of England priest, and his wife, Rosamond Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wingfield Digby, fourth daughter of John Digby Wingfield Digby, of Sherborne Castle, Dorset. His childhood was spent at his father's vicarage at Dodford in Northamptonshire and at his maternal grandfather's second family seat, Coleshill Park in Warwickshire. He was educated at King's School, Worcester (1909&#150;17), where the services in the nearby cathedral became ingrained into his consciousness. Brought up at home in a devoutly evangelical tradition emphasizing preaching and the scriptures, at Worcester he became accustomed to a more sacramental religion, with frequent communion services. He had no particular aptitude as a scholar and failed to win the scholarships for which he entered at Oxford and Cambridge universities. At Selwyn College, Cambridge, in 1917, however, he was awarded a Patteson studentship, established for prospective missionary candidates in memory of John Coleridge Patteson, the first Anglican bishop of Melanesia.<br>
<br>In early 1918 Strong was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers, at a time when the tide of war was turning against Germany. He joined the 33rd division under the command of his cousin Major-General Sir Reginald Pinney. After returning to Cambridge in 1919 he studied for the theological tripos, obtained a first class in his early examinations, but did not proceed to honours. His other main interests, besides taking a prominent part in the religious societies, were in the debates of the Cambridge Union and in rowing for his college. He graduated BA in 1921 and proceeded MA three years later.<br>
<br>On 21 December 1922 Strong was made deacon in the chapel of Auckland Castle, the episcopal palace of Hensley Henson, bishop of Durham. He was ordained priest in the chapel exactly a year later. He was assistant curate at St Mary's, Tyne Dock, South Shields, from 1922 to 1926, and vicar of Christ Church, Meadow Lane, Leeds, in the diocese of Ripon, from 1926 to 1931. Henson had a high opinion of him and in 1931 called him back from Ripon to the diocese of Durham as vicar of the church of St Ignatius the Martyr at Sunderland. Another who was impressed was Cosmo Gordon Lang, archbishop of Canterbury, who in 1936 was entrusted by the Australian bishops with the choice of a bishop of New Guinea to succeed Henry Newton.<br>
<br>In his room at Lambeth Palace on 27 October 1936, the night before Strong's consecration as bishop in St Paul's Cathedral, London, Lang pointed dramatically to the crucifix and said to Strong, &#145;There will be more of that in your life than there has been in mine&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 8 July 1983). Strong's trials came six years later, when Japanese forces invaded Papua New Guinea. In the panic that followed an unauthorized radio message from the government headquarters at Samarai ordering the evacuation of white expatriates, Strong broadcast on 31 January 1942 urging his staff to stay: &#145;missionaries do not think of themselves in the hour of danger and crisis, but of the Master who called them to give their all&#146;  (Wetherell, 222&#150;3). Though he later counselled young women missionaries to leave, as a result of his leadership the Anglican staff elected to remain. Twelve were killed, including the Papuan teacher Lucien Tapiedi. He himself experienced bombing and machine-gunning by a Japanese plane. He suffered deeply from bitter personal criticism in Australia for not having insisted on the removal of his staff to safety. Yet his much publicized visits to Australia, as bishop of a diocese partly occupied by enemy forces, undoubtedly made him something of a national figure in Australia for a brief period in 1942 and 1943.<br>
<br>A further crippling blow was suffered in January 1951 when Mount Lamington volcano in northern coastal Papua, in the heart of the densest Anglican population, erupted and killed 3500 of Strong's flock, as well as almost all his Papuan and expatriate staff in the area. Among Strong's clergy active in the rehabilitation of the Mount Lamington population was David Hand, who had been advanced to the episcopate as first assistant bishop of New Guinea in 1950. Another of Strong's more significant decisions was to nominate, ten years later, the first Papua New Guinean national bishop, George Ambo, at a time when the appointment of Papuans as heads of organizations was still thought by many to be decades away.<br>
<br>During the Pacific war Strong had been nominated to the vacant archbishopric of Brisbane but had declined. In 1962 the archbishop election committee again nominated him. This time he accepted. Like other former missionary bishops, he found it hard to adjust to church government through a diocesan synod, council, and committees. He had grown accustomed to wielding supreme power and he sometimes did not find it easy to reconcile himself to a shared form of authority. Moreover, he found it difficult to accept many of the liberal changes of the 1960s. He opposed any relaxation in the six o'clock closing of Queensland hotels. In his attitude towards alcohol he did not differ from his teetotal cousin Sir Reginald Pinney, who in 1916 had stopped the 33rd division's customary tot of rum at the dawn &#145;stand-to&#146;. Strong also believed all forms of gambling to be wrong, and opposed the remarriage of divorcees as contravening the command of Jesus. He had little sympathy with theological trends in this period and regarded Bishop John Robinson's controversial book <span class="italic">Honest to God</span> (1963) as an onslaught on the church's traditional faith. By theological conviction and social habit Strong tended towards an unquestioning support of government. He was innately deferential to people of rank and title. He saw little value in the student street marches in Brisbane that broadened from opposition to the Vietnam War to resistance to the Queensland state government's constraints on civil liberties.<br>
<br>Elected primate of the Church of England in Australia in 1966, Strong presided over its general synods of 1966 and 1969. In his presidential addresses as primate at the two synods he depicted the &#145;new theology&#146; as a symptom of &#145;defeatism&#146; and its advocates as a &#145;kind of fifth column&#146; within the church, contributing to a widespread undermining of faith in the Christian religion (Church of England in Australia, <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Second General Synod</span>, 1966, 26, and <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Third General Synod</span>, 1969, 24). Many younger clergy regarded him as out of touch with the modern world.<br>
<br>After retirement in 1970 (in which year he was knighted KBE; he had been appointed CMG in 1958) Strong lived in the cathedral close at Wangaratta, Victoria, assisted by his long-time secretary, Elsie Manley. In retirement his preaching, though it continued to be criticized for its length, lost nothing of its punch and power. (Strong's preaching had reached a worldwide audience at the memorial service to Harold Holt, prime minister of Australia, in Melbourne in December 1967.) He died, unmarried, at Wangaratta Hospital on 6 July 1983 and was buried in Wangaratta cemetery on 11 July after a funeral service at Holy Trinity Cathedral, Wangaratta. A memorial service was held on 21 October 1983 at St Paul's Church, Knightsbridge, London.<br>
<br>Significant though his work was in Australia, Strong's greatest impact was felt in Papua New Guinea. There his influence outlived his twenty-eight-year rule and persisted into the 1990s through the episcopates of his successors David Hand and George Ambo. Something of a missionary bishop's spiritual authoritarianism came through in the monarchical style of Strong's episcopates. He had much leeway to make up in developing some form of conciliarity, but his authoritarian rule was conditioned by an intense personal humility.<br>
