<span class="headword">Malden,  Henry</span>  (1800&#150;1876), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was the fourth son of Jonas Malden, surgeon, of Putney. He was educated privately, first at the school of the Revd William Carmalt at Putney, and afterwards by the Revd M. Preston at Aspenden Hall, near Buntingford, Hertfordshire, where Macaulay was a fellow pupil. In October 1818 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge. He won the Craven scholarship in 1821, being bracketed with Macaulay and George Long (1800&#150;1879), and was chancellor's classical medallist in 1822. He graduated BA in 1822 and MA in 1825, and was elected fellow of Trinity in 1824. While at Cambridge he wrote for <span class="italic">Knight's Quarterly Magazine</span> on Longus (no. 2) and on the later Greek philosophy (no. 3). He was also the author of a poem, <span class="italic">Evening</span>, published in a volume edited by Joanna Baillie. In 1824 he was strongly recommended for the post of rector of the Edinburgh Academy, but failed to obtain it. On 19 March the following year he married Elizabeth Frances (<i>d</i>. 23 Nov 1835), eldest daughter of John Taylor MP.<br>
<br>In 1831 Malden succeeded George Long as professor of Greek at University College (then the University of London), and filled this chair until his resignation in 1876. He took an active part &#145;in promoting the compromise that led to the erection, in 1836, of the University of London as an examining body, and the incorporation of the Gower Street institution as University College&#146;. He published in 1835 an essay entitled &#145;On the origin of universities and academical degrees&#146;, which was written as an introduction to the report of the argument before the privy council in support of the application of the University of London for a charter empowering it to grant degrees.<br>
<br>In 1831, when it faced closure after a difficult first year, Malden was appointed headmaster of University College School jointly with Thomas Hewitt Key, the two men agreeing to take on the school at their own risk. Malden resigned in 1842, though he continued to teach the sixth form Greek until 1868. Malden remarried in 1843; his second wife was Georgina Augusta, daughter of Colonel Drinkwater Bethune of Thorncroft. He died on 4 July 1876 at his residence, 39 Belsize Square, South Hampstead. A Malden medal and scholarship (of the value of about &pound;20), open to men and women, were established in 1878 by the subscribers to the Malden memorial fund. The medal, by M. Macphail, bears a portrait of Malden.<br>
<br>Malden was a man of a gentle and retiring disposition. His scholarship was &#145;singularly elaborate and minute&#146;. A tribute by a former pupil, probably R. H. Hutton, recalled his &#145;fastidious method&#146;, deliberately cultivated to counter contemporary critics of the new university in London who alleged that it would dispense superficial instruction  (Bellot, 93&#150;4). He was a contributor to the <span class="italic">Philological Museum</span>, edited by Connop Thirlwall in 1830; to the <span class="italic">Classical Museum</span>, edited by Dr Leonard Schmitz between 1843 and 1850; and to the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Philological Society</span>. He reviewed Niebuhr's <span class="italic">Roman History</span> in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> (56, 1833) and also published for the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge a <span class="italic">History of Rome to <span class="smallcap">BC</span> 390</span> (1830).<br>
