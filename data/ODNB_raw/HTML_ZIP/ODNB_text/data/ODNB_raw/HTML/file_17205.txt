<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lupton,  Thomas Goff</span>  (1791&#150;1873), <span class="occ">landscape, portrait, and subject engraver</span>, was born in Clerkenwell, London, on 3 September 1791, the son of William Lupton, a goldsmith, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clarkson. Lupton was apprenticed to the mezzotint engraver and portrait and historical painter George Clint in 1805. He exhibited portrait drawings at the Royal Academy between 1811 and 1820. On 30 May 1818 Lupton married Susannah Oliver (<i>b</i>. 1800?), and they had six sons and one daughter. Clint had engraved two plates for J. M. W. Turner's <span class="italic">Liber Studiorum</span> (<i>c</i>.1806&#150;19), and after Lupton completed his apprenticeship, he engraved, under Turner's close supervision, his first mezzotint plate for the series, <span class="italic">Solway Moss</span> (1816; original watercolour untraced), which as Lupton later claimed &#145;placed me at once among my brother scrapers, an artist&#146;  (Pye and Roget, 65). Lupton also engraved for the <span class="italic">Liber Studiorum</span> the published plates of <span class="italic">Dumblain Abbey, Scotland</span> (1816, original watercolour, <i>c</i>.1806&#150;7, Tate collection), <span class="italic">Water Cress Gatherers</span> (1819; original watercolour untraced), and <span class="italic">Ben Arthur, Scotland</span> (1819; original watercolour untraced), as well as the unpublished subjects <span class="italic">Dumbarton</span> (1820s; original watercolour untraced) and <span class="italic">Ploughing Eton</span> (1820s; original watercolour, Tate collection), and may have also worked on <span class="italic">Stonehenge</span> (1820s; original watercolour, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) although this plate is traditionally attributed to Turner. He continued to work with Turner, with whom he became especially friendly, and who valued highly Lupton's expertise and sensitivity. After Turner's death in 1851 Lupton provided important anecdotal information to early commentators on the artist including John Ruskin, John Pye, and Walter Thornbury.<br>
<br>Lupton played a significant role in the evolution of the use of steel plates for engraving, an important issue, since copper plates were unable to produce large numbers of impressions and were consequently uneconomic. William Say had successfully engraved a soft steel plate in 1820, but found the medium unsympathetic, and abandoned his investigations. Lupton experimented, first with nickel and the Chinese alloy tutenag, and subsequently with steel. In 1822 he successfully engraved Clint's portrait of the actor John Shepherd Munden (original painting untraced) in mezzotint on steel, for which he was awarded the Society of Arts' Isis gold medal on 30 May 1822. Lupton used steel for the remainder of his career. His early engravings on steel include the <span class="italic">Infant Samuel</span> (original painting untraced) of 1822, after Sir Joshua Reynolds, the <span class="italic">Passage Boat</span>, and <span class="italic">A Group of Cattle</span> after Cuyp published by W. B. Cooke in 1824, and five plates after Turner's designs for the <span class="italic">Rivers of England</span> (1823&#150;7) in the 1820s. In 1826 Lupton collaborated with Turner on the <span class="italic">Ports of England</span> (1826&#150;8), acting as engraver and publisher, but by 1828 only six mezzotints of the proposed twelve had been published, and the remaining six did not appear until 1856, after Turner's death, when the complete series was published by Ernest Gambart as the <span class="italic">Harbours of England</span> with a commentary by John Ruskin. Lupton also collaborated with Turner on single large mezzotint plates of <span class="italic">Calais Pier</span> (original painting, exh. 1803, National Gallery, London) and <span class="italic">Folkestone</span> (original watercolour untraced), but they remained unpublished in his lifetime. <span class="italic">Calais Pier</span> was abandoned because of the excessive alterations demanded by Turner, but was eventually published in 1892 by Henry Graves on behalf of the Artists' General Benevolent Institution. Between 1858 and 1864 Lupton re-engraved fifteen of the <span class="italic">Liber Studiorum</span> subjects on steel for a projected series to be published by Colnaghi and dedicated to John Ruskin, but the plates were never issued.<br>
<br>Lupton was a highly regarded, versatile, and prolific engraver. In addition to his accomplished work for Turner, he also engraved numerous portraits after artists such as Henry Perronet Briggs, George Clint, Thomas Lawrence, and Joshua Reynolds, as well as illustrations for <span class="italic">Gems of Art</span> (1823), <span class="italic">Beauties of Claude Lorrain</span> (1825), and Lady Charlotte Bury's <span class="italic">Three Great Sanctuaries of Tuscany</span> (1833). His finest single plates include <span class="italic">Wellington Surveying the Field of Waterloo</span> after Benjamin Robert Haydon (1841; original painting, 1839, NPG); <span class="italic">Lord Byron</span> after Thomas Phillips (1824; original painting, 1814, Gov. Art Coll., British embassy, Athens); and <span class="italic">The Eddystone Lighthouse</span> (1824; original watercolour untraced) and <span class="italic">Sunrise, Whiting Fishing at Margate</span> (1825; original watercolour untraced) after Turner. Lupton became friendly with John Ruskin in the 1850s, and engraved a number of plates for his publications, notably the <span class="italic">Stones of Venice</span> (1851&#150;3). Lupton taught Ruskin's prot&eacute;g&eacute; George Allen, who subsequently made engravings for Ruskin's books. Lupton also took on William Oakley Burgess as his pupil in the late 1830s. An active supporter of the Artists' Annuity Fund, Lupton was president between 1836 and 1838. Lupton died on 18 May 1873 at his home at 4 Keppel Street, Russell Square, London, where he had lived for thirty-six years. His youngest son, Nevil Oliver Lupton (<i>b</i>. 1828), became a landscape painter; he was awarded the first Turner medal at the Royal Academy in 1857, and exhibited landscapes regularly there until 1857.<br>
