</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jenkins,  Peter George James</span>  (1934&#150;1992), <span class="occ">journalist and author</span>, was born on 11 May 1934 at 5 Penn Road, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, the elder child and only son of Kenneth Edmund Jenkins (1906&#150;1993), a pharmaceutical chemist, and his wife, Joan Evelyn Croger (1907&#150;1981), a teacher. From 1938 he grew up at Bury St Edmunds, where his father kept a leading chemist's shop, and from 1945 was a boarder at the nearby Methodist school, Culford. Though his parents were outsiders (Welsh and Londoner) and he was to develop Labour sympathies, his upbringing&#151;he later wrote&#151;was so like Margaret Thatcher's that &#145;I know [her]&#146;: he knew at first hand the shopkeeper's sense that the 1945 Labour victory was the triumph of Antichrist. He too had longed to flee &#145;the excruciating tedium of petty bourgeois life in a small provincial town&#146;  (Jenkins, <span class="italic">Mrs Thatcher's Revolution</span>, 82&#150;4).<br>
<br>His early years were marked by estrangement from his alcoholic father&#151;part of a family conflict that was to end in his parents' separation. After two years' national service in the Royal Navy (1952&#150;4), which briefly commissioned him sub-lieutenant, he read history at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, taking a first in part one and in part two a second (division one). Because his father (who wanted him to settle in Bury as a solicitor) would not help to maintain him at Cambridge, he launched as an undergraduate into freelance journalism. He had long wanted to write; after a year in the United States on a Harkness fellowship, in 1958 he joined the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, where gifted young reporters were set to producing quick, well-researched background articles.<br>
<br>Jenkins made his mark and, in 1960, became deputy to the labour correspondent of <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, John Cole, whose job he took over in 1963. Also in 1960, he married the first of his two wives, each descended from the &#145;intellectual aristocracy&#146; but distinguished in her own right. With Charlotte Strachey (1935&#150;1970), a woman of fine-drawn beauty but frail health, he lived to begin with in a milieu part intellectual, part raffish. Through both family background and closeness to Newmarket, he had a lifelong passion for horse racing and, at first, a marked gambling streak; he fancied at one time becoming a gentleman jockey, often dressed like a bookmaker, and enjoyed the cockles-and-champagne aspect of the sport. The purchase of a house in then barely gentrifying Crescent Grove, Clapham, and the birth of a daughter, marked a settling down, but Charlotte developed Hodgkin's disease and, after thirty months' distressing illness, died on 2 April 1970. He then married on 28 December 1970 Mary Louisa (Polly) Toynbee (<i>b</i>. 1946), altogether a stronger person, who herself became a leading journalist and author; they had two daughters and a son, and combined busy careers with many friendships and a warm, hospitable family life.<br>
<br>Writing on labour affairs while trade unions were still an estate of the realm lay at the heart of serious political journalism. Jenkins did far more than report industrial disputes. He won a series of resounding scoops on matters then important: the draft report (1963) of the National Economic Development Council on incomes policy, another&#151;damning&#151;draft report on the newspaper industry, George Brown's preference for devaluation over deflation (1966), Harold Wilson's attempt to create a legal framework for industrial relations. The last was the subject of a vigorous, revealing instant history, <span class="italic">The Battle of Downing Street</span> (1970); Jenkins's witty handling was typified by his dubbing James Callaghan, instrumental in preserving the unions' hold over the Labour Party, &#145;the keeper of the cloth cap&#146;. He got these stories from ministers and senior officials who liked and respected him as an equal; few&#151;Richard Crossman was one&#151;tried to manipulate him. Scoops apart, he learned the art of piecing together bits of information to understand what was going on in Whitehall.<br>
<br>To keep him, <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> in 1967 matched the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>'s offer to make him political columnist; he became policy editor from 1974. His interests were in the world at large; he modelled himself, as far as British conditions allowed, on Walter Lippmann's famous column, writing two, three, or four times a week. His main themes were the relative decline of Britain, which he felt keenly, and the need, throughout Europe but especially in the Labour Party, to replace the socialist ideal with social democracy, combining liberal economics with the pursuit of collective social goals. His close friend Anthony Crosland inspired this consistent belief, as did the example of West Germany; Jenkins was a fixture at the annual Anglo-German K&ouml;nigswinter conference and strongly supported British commitment to the European Community. In the 1980s he both influenced and was influenced by the &#145;gang of four&#146; who founded the Social Democratic Party. Though he became an outstanding analyst of British politics, he could drop everything to report vividly what the people in the street (or the picket line) had to say.<br>
<br>A stint as Washington correspondent (1972&#150;4) brought out his courage: before the Watergate scandal broke, he wrote that Richard Nixon's re-election &#145;should be viewed with repugnance and deep foreboding&#146;; it would confirm American society in its &#145;deform[ation] by callousness, brutality and greed&#146; and obscure &#145;the simple moral fact that killing people&#151;even Asians&#151;is wrong&#146;  (Jenkins, <span class="italic">Anatomy of Decline</span>, 49&#150;51). He showed similar courage in opposing the Falklands War: &#145;by what gigantic lack of proportion&#146; was the loss of the islands &#145;to be seen as a major national humiliation?&#146;  (Taylor, 232).<br>
<br>By the 1980s Jenkins's writing had shed some of its irreverent wit and acquired gravitas. Restless at <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, he found little satisfaction at the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> (1985&#150;7) but bloomed again as associate editor of the new <span class="italic">Independent</span>. He started reviewing plays (for <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, 1979&#150;81) and writing them. <span class="italic">Illuminations</span> (1980), about a Crosland-like politician, had a short run; though often effective, it was old-fashioned in construction. A television comedy series, <span class="italic">Struggle</span> (1983), made fun of the &#145;loony left&#146;&#151;observable in his home borough of Lambeth in London. With a long-standing interest in visual art and in Italy, he wrote for the revisionist journal <span class="italic">Modern Painters</span> and bought a house in Umbria. He became a prison visitor. His chief interest remained writing about politics. In a penetrating book, <span class="italic">Mrs Thatcher's Revolution</span> (1987), he argued that although Thatcherism was more style than ideology, and the changes wrought were part of a European trend, the prime minister had significantly changed British society by curbing the unions and dispelling the sense of decline. What was now needed was to enlarge the rights of the citizen as consumer, parent, tenant, and patient. With this in Jenkins's mind went continuing scepticism about the Labour Party; in 1992 he considered voting Conservative. If he had lived he would doubtless have rallied to Labour under Tony Blair, but while he was at the height of his powers a lung disease, fibrosing alveolitis, failed to respond to treatment; he died in University College Hospital, London, on 27 May 1992, and was buried at Putney Vale on 1 June.<br>
<br>Jenkins was of striking appearance, short, top-heavy (soon tubby), with a large head and expressive features, dark eyes, and thick eyebrows often puckered in amusement. He was unusually spontaneous: his moods showed. His sense of fun and enjoyment communicated itself&#151;summed up by the motto on his gravestone, &#145;seize the day&#146;; so at times did his impatience or his justified sense of his own worth. By some he was disliked, by others loved; few were indifferent to a personality with a strong tang.<br>
