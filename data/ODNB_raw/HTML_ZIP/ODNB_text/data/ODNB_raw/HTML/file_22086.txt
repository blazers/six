<span class="headword">Phayre, Sir  Arthur Purves</span>  (1812&#150;1885), <span class="occ">administrator in Burma</span>, born at Shrewsbury on 7 May 1812, was the second son of Richard Phayre, of Claremont, Shrewsbury, and his wife, Maria, daughter of James Leech Ridgeway, publisher, of 169 Piccadilly, London. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22088/', "Sir Robert Phayre")</script> was his brother. Educated at Shrewsbury School, he entered the Indian army and was gazetted ensign in the 7th Bengal native infantry in August 1828, serving in Gorakhpur and Azamgarh. His first connection with Burma, the country with which his life was mainly associated, came in 1834, when he was sent to Moulmein to raise a Mon corps of military police for service in Tenasserim which, together with the province of Arakan, had been ceded to the British in 1826 at the close of the First Anglo-Burmese War. Promoted lieutenant in 1835, Phayre was appointed senior assistant to the commissioner of Arakan in 1837, and served as a district officer at Akyab, Kyaukpyu, and Sandoway. In 1846 he became principal assistant to the commissioner of Tenasserim, and after volunteering to serve with his regiment in the Punjab campaign of 1848, returned to Burma in April 1849 as captain and commissioner of Arakan, in succession to his former chief, Captain Archibald Bogle. The foundations of Phayre's administrative abilities and of his intimate knowledge of Burmese language and history were laid during these early years in Burma. His talents caught the attention of Lord Dalhousie, governor-general of India, who selected him in December 1852 to become commissioner of the Lower Burma province of Pegu, annexed at the close of the Second Anglo-Burmese War. Phayre was promoted major in 1855 and lieutenant-colonel in 1859. He was responsible for planning the early development and lay-out of Rangoon as the capital of the new province of Pegu, which flourished under his administration. In late 1854 he accompanied a Burmese mission to Calcutta and the following year, as envoy of the governor-general, led a return mission to the court of King Mindon for the purpose of establishing treaty relations. He was accompanied on the 1855 mission to Amarapura by, among others, Thomas Oldham, superintendent of the geological survey of India, the photographer Captain Linnaeus Tripe, Colesworthy Grant as official artist, and Captain Henry Yule as secretary. Phayre's mission, although it did not succeed in obtaining a treaty, collected much valuable information about Burma, its people, and its government, and achieved fame through Yule's report, published in 1858 as <span class="italic">A Narrative of the Mission Sent by the Governor-General of India to the Court of Ava in 1855</span>. In 1862 the three provinces of Tenasserim, Arakan, and Pegu were formed into a united administration and Phayre was appointed first chief commissioner of British Burma. Phayre led a second mission to the Burmese court at Mandalay in 1862, when a commercial treaty was negotiated, and a third mission in 1866 when he was promoted colonel. Owing to ill health, he retired as chief commissioner in February 1867 and the following month left Burma, never to return.<br>
<br>Phayre, having declined Sir Stafford Northcote's offer of the prestigious post of resident at Hyderabad, travelled extensively in India, the Far East, and America. After returning to Britain in 1870, he settled at Bray, near Dublin, for four years. In November 1874 he was appointed by Lord Carnarvon to the governorship of Mauritius. His administration was both successful and popular, and he held office until the end of 1878, when he in effect retired from the Indian army, though remaining on the supernumerary list of the Bengal staff corps. In recognition of his distinguished services he was made a CB in 1863, KCSI in 1867, and GCMG in 1877, and he received military promotion to major-general in 1870 and to lieutenant-general in 1877. On his return from Mauritius he settled again at Bray, and occupied himself in compiling his <span class="italic">History of Burma, including Burma proper, Pegu, Taungnu, Tenasserim and Arakan, from the earliest time to the end of the first war with British India</span> (1883; repr. 1969). This pioneering work was based substantially on the <span class="italic">Mahayazawin</span> or &#145;royal chronicles&#146; and other Burmese sources. One of his last public acts was to write a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> (13 October 1885) expressing his approval of military intervention in and annexation of independent Upper Burma. He died, unmarried, at 12 Goldsmith Terrace, Queensborough Road, Bray on the night of 14&#150;15 December 1885, and was buried at Enniskerry.<br>
<br>As a soldier&#150;administrator, Phayre had a deep devotion to duty and was a zealous official correspondent, while his understanding of Burmese matters was exceptional. His firm and just administration laid the foundations of the prosperity of the lower Burma provinces under British rule, and his scholarly knowledge of Burmese language, literature, and history made an important contribution to Anglo-Burmese relations and to the historiography of Burma.<br>
<br>Phayre's publications, besides <span class="italic">The History of Burma</span>, were <span class="italic">Coins of Arakan, of Pegu and of Burma</span> (part of the <span class="roman">International Numismata Orientalia</span>, 1882), and many articles in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal</span> as detailed in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society</span> (8, 1886, 111) and the <span class="italic">British Library Journal</span> (1975, 69).<br>
