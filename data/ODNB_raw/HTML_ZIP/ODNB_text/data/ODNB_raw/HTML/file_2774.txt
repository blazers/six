<span class="headword">Bohun,  Humphrey (III)  de</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1144, <em>d.</em> 1181), <span class="occ">constable to Henry II</span>, was the son and heir of <a href="#cosubject_53236">Humphrey (II) de Bohun [<i>see below</i>]</a> and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/102428/', "Margaret de Bohun (c.1121&#150;1196/7)")</script>, the eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10820/', "Miles of Gloucester, earl of Hereford")</script>. The family name was derived from St Georges de Bohon in the Cotentin, from where Humphrey (III)'s great-grandfather, Humphrey &#145;with the beard&#146;, came to England with William the Conqueror. During William Rufus's reign this Humphrey's son, normally described as Humphrey (I) de Bohun, married Maud, the daughter of Edward of Salisbury, and as a result acquired estates based on Trowbridge, Wiltshire. He died <i>c</i>.1123, leaving <a name="cosubject_53236"></a><span class="headword">Humphrey (II)  de Bohun</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1164/5)<span class="occ"></span>, who with his mother, Maud, founded the Cluniac priory at Monkton Farleigh, Wiltshire, evidently in fulfilment of his father's wishes. In 1130 Humphrey (II) de Bohun still owed relief for his father's land, plus 400 marks for the purchase of a royal stewardship. As steward he witnessed charters of Henry I towards the end of his reign, and also King Stephen's Oxford charter of liberties in 1136. However, he deserted to the Empress Matilda on her arrival in England in 1139 and successfully defended his castle at Trowbridge against the king. In 1144 he received from the empress confirmation of his lands and of his &#145;stewardship in England and Normandy&#146;, with a grant of other estates. He was loyal to the Angevins in the civil war, witnessing as steward both for the empress in the 1140s and for Henry II, before and after his accession as king, between 1153 and 1157. However, during the year 1158 he was deprived of former royal demesne which he was holding in Wiltshire. None of the royal charters he attested can with certainty be dated to 1158 or later, and it may be that he fell out of the king's favour. On the other hand he was present at the promulgation of the constitutions of Clarendon in January 1164. He was dead by Michaelmas 1165, when his son Humphrey (III) de Bohun owed 300 marks as relief. In the following year his widow, Margaret, who had become coheir to Miles of Gloucester following the deaths of her brothers, answered for the knights' fees which formed her share of the inheritance, and which passed to Humphrey (III) de Bohun along with the Bohun lands in Wiltshire.<br>
<br>Humphrey (III) de Bohun attested several of Henry II's charters as constable, an office previously held by Miles of Gloucester, and distinguished himself on the king's side in the war of 1173&#150;4. He was in the royal army at Breteuil in August 1173, and with the justiciar Richard de Lucy later sacked Berwick and led troops into Lothian against William the Lion, king of Scots, before having to return south to deal with rebellion in England. In October 1173 he featured prominently in the defeat and capture of the earl of Leicester and others at Fornham near Bury St Edmunds. He witnessed the treaty of Falaise between Henry II and the king of Scots at the close of 1174. Through his marriage, which took place between February 1171 and Easter 1175, to Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1201), daughter of Henry of Scotland, earl of Northumberland (<i>d</i>. 1152), and widow of Conan (IV), duke of Brittany (<i>d</i>. 1171), he became brother-in-law to the king of Scots. He died while a member of the army led into France towards the end of 1181 by Henry II's sons to assist Philippe II against the count of Flanders, and was buried at Llanthony (Secunda) Priory, Gloucestershire. He left a daughter, Matilda, and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2773/', "Henry de Bohun")</script>, who in 1187 was a minor in the custody of Margaret de Bohun, the widow of Humphrey (II) de Bohun.<br>
