<span class="headword">Blacker, Sir  George Francis</span>  (1865&#150;1948), <span class="occ">obstetrician</span>, was born in Dublin on 23 October 1865, the fourth child of Commissary-Major-General Latham William Blacker (1829&#150;1916), who came from a military and landed family in co. Tyrone, and his wife, Harriette de Maine (<i>d</i>. 1908), daughter of Captain John Bagot-Smith. Little is known about Blacker's childhood except that between the ages of thirteen and seventeen he was educated in England, at Cheltenham College. He retained a lifelong affection for his school, and later in life held office as president of the Old Cheltonian Society.<br>
<br>After matriculation Blacker became a student at University College, London, attending first the faculty of arts (1883&#150;5) and then the faculty of medicine (1885&#150;6 and 1891&#150;2), where he proved to be a gifted scholar. He won an exhibition and gold medals in his intermediate examinations in July 1888 and achieved a first-class pass in the London MB examinations in 1891, when he was also awarded a gold medal; he went on to win a further two gold medals in the MD examination in 1893. Obstetrics and gynaecology became Blacker's speciality and although at the time obstetricians were classed as physicians (he was elected fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1902), Blacker continued to pursue the surgical side of his specialism. In 1890 he was elected Atkinson&#150;Morley surgical scholar at University College Hospital, and in 1891 he took his surgical fellowship (FRCS).<br>
<br>Except for the period of the First World War, when he served as a captain with the Royal Army Medical Corps (he was mentioned twice in dispatches), Blacker devoted his working life to his own teaching hospital. His first appointments at University College Hospital were very junior but they marked the beginning of a distinguished career; by 1893 he was elected assistant obstetric physician, he was appointed obstetric physician in 1900, and physician in 1927. However, his foremost interest was in medical education and it was in this sphere that Blacker made his greatest contribution. During his first tenure as dean of the medical school, from 1912 to 1915, he supported the report of the 1913 royal commission on university education in London, and advocated the creation of full-time medical professorships. His second term as dean, from 1917 to 1926, proved most eventful for University College Hospital was one of the medical schools to respond to a government initiative by reforming its system of teaching. Not only was Blacker responsible for developing the new clinical unit system but when the Rockefeller Foundation donated gifts to the hospital, in excess of &pound;1 million in support of this and other projects, he gained wide recognition for his invaluable administrative services.<br>
<br>During the early 1920s Blacker became involved in the professional debate concerning the reform of obstetric teaching. This had been initiated by T. Watts Eden at the Royal Society of Medicine while Blacker was president of its obstetrics and gynaecology section (1917&#150;18). For his part Blacker upheld proposals which advocated the extension of midwifery teaching facilities to all medical students in London, and the establishment of four or more new centres where tuition and practical experience could be gained in all aspects of midwifery, gynaecology, and maternal and child welfare.<br>
<br>In addition to his teaching and practice, at various times Blacker acted as an examiner in midwifery to the universities of London, Liverpool, and New Zealand. He was also a keen committee man, and during his membership of the Obstetrical Society of London (1893&#150;1907) and of the obstetrics and gynaecology section of the Royal Society of Medicine (1907&#150;48) he sat on a great number of them. These activities left him little time for writing but he did make occasional contributions to medical journals and was noted for editing the seventh edition of Galabin's renowned text, <span class="italic">Practice of Midwifery</span>, published in 1910. He also took a keen interest in the use of radium in gynaecology and, in 1929, was president of the Radium Institute at Mount Vernon Hospital.<br>
<br>Blacker was appointed CBE in 1920, and was knighted in 1923. He married Shirley Elvina (<i>b</i>. 1879/80), second daughter of Canon Thomas James Bowen, at St Mary's Church, Tormarton, Gloucestershire, on 8 November 1904; their only child, George Patrick Demaine (1906&#150;1974), was born two years later. Blacker was apparently an energetic and cheerful man, whose leisure activities included fishing and, on retirement, working with the British Red Cross Society. In all other respects he led a quiet and modest life, retiring first to Shedfield in Hampshire in the early 1930s before finally settling at Frensham in Surrey in 1940. He died, of a heart attack, at his home, Oak Hill Cottage, Frensham, on 21 May 1948.<br>
