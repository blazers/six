<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stewart,  James</span>, earl of Arran  (<em>c.</em>1545&#150;1596), <span class="occ">courtier and administrator</span>, was the second son of the eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26460/', "Andrew Stewart, second Lord Ochiltree (1521?&#150;1594?)")</script>, and his first wife, Agnes Cunningham (<i>d</i>. in or after 1557), daughter of John Cunningham of Caprington. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26517/', "William Stewart of Monkton")</script> was a younger brother. The details of Stewart's early life are unknown, but he is said to have received an unusually good education. He may have been sent to study in France, where he subsequently became a mercenary; he fought in the army of the estates of Holland against the Spaniards and saw service in Sweden, Germany, and perhaps Russia, before returning home with the rank of captain in late 1577 or early 1578.<h2>
<a name="SettlinginScotland"></a>Settling in Scotland</h2>A handsome man, eloquent, intelligent, and of great presence and considerable charm, Stewart impressed the young James VI and attached himself to the king's great-uncle, Robert, sixth earl of Lennox. However, Esm&eacute; Stewart (<i>c</i>.1542&#150;1583), seigneur d'Aubigny, James's fascinating cousin, arrived from France in September 1579 and rose rapidly in the royal favour. James Stewart, by now having an affair with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69924/', "Elizabeth Stewart (c.1554&#150;1595?)")</script>, the recently married countess of Lennox, deserted his patron in favour of Aubigny. The elderly Lennox was persuaded to resign his earldom to Aubigny, and Elizabeth left her husband for the dashing captain. Soon Stewart was sharing in the new earl of Lennox's rapid advancement, receiving with his father a grant of the lands of Bothwellmuir in Lanarkshire, which in August were transformed into a barony. He was also granted various escheats, along with revenues from the church lands of St Andrews and Leuchars. On 15 October 1580 he became one of the gentlemen of the king's chamber.<br>
<br>James VI was still too young to rule for himself, and Scotland was being governed by the increasingly unpopular fourth earl of Morton, formerly regent and now head of the council. At Lennox's bidding, at a privy council meeting on 31 December 1580 Stewart accused Morton of murdering Lord Darnley, and the regent was imprisoned and later executed. For the next twenty months Lennox and Stewart virtually ruled Scotland, Lennox as the prime favourite but with Stewart retaining his influence over the young monarch and gathering honours and appointments as a result. In January 1581, to the fury of the Hamiltons, Stewart obtained the guardianship of his distant relative James Hamilton, third earl of Arran, who had been insane for nearly twenty years. In February he replaced his own father on the privy council and in March he was appointed captain of the king's guard. On 21 April 1581 the king created him earl of Arran and he took up residence in Arran's handsome tower house at Kinneil, in Linlithgowshire. By this time Elizabeth Stewart had managed to divorce her husband for impotence, and the new earl of Arran married her on 6 July 1581. She was already three months pregnant with their first child.<h2>
<a name="Favouriteandchancellor"></a>Favourite and chancellor</h2>Arran and Lennox (recently made a duke) were by now bitter rivals. Although Arran's resignation at the end of the year as captain of the king's guard eased the tension between them, their uneasy relationship continued until a group of nobles led by the earl of Gowrie decided to end their rule. In what became known as the Ruthven raid Gowrie and his ultra-protestant friends seized the king, on 22 August 1582, and held him at Gowrie's castle of Ruthven. Arran at once rode to the rescue but was taken prisoner, while Lennox was ordered to leave the country. For the next ten months the Ruthven lords ruled Scotland. Arran was released from Ruthven Castle in November 1582 after the king's intervention, and when James finally escaped from the Ruthven lords in June 1583 Arran joined him at Falkland, where, according to the French envoy Fontenay, he encouraged the young king to waste his time in amusement and idle recreation. Arran was soon attending privy council meetings again and further honours were showered upon him. He became keeper of the strategically important Stirling Castle when the second earl of Mar was forced to give it up, and in October he was elected provost of Stirling. By the end of that month, the Ruthven raiders, apart from Gowrie, had been either imprisoned or driven into exile. Arran was visited at Kinneil by his grateful monarch for two nights in November, and on 10 December he became an extraordinary lord of session.<br>
<br>In spring 1584 the exiled Ruthven raiders attempted to recover power. They seized Stirling Castle on 18 April, and issued a proclamation declaring their loyalty to the king but denouncing &#145;that godlesse atheist, bloodie Haman and seditious Catiline, James Stuart, called Erle of Arran, the onlie disturber and unquietter of the whole countrie&#146;  (Calderwood, 4.28). However, the king marched against them; they fled, and Gowrie (arrested on 15 April, after dithering as to whether to join the other raiders) was executed on 4 May. His lands were then divided between the third earl of Montrose and Arran, who received Dirleton Castle and other properties in East Lothian. Arran was now acting as chancellor in place of the sixth earl of Argyll, who was sick, and under his conservative administration parliament on 19 May passed the <span class="roman">Black Acts</span>, asserting the king's authority over church as well as state.<br>
<br>Arran pursued a policy of friendship with England and, though Elizabeth I did not trust him, in June 1584 she appointed the governor of Berwick, Baron Hunsdon, to meet him for a discussion about the possibility of an Anglo-Scottish league. In August Arran was made captain and keeper of Edinburgh Castle and on the 13th he met Hunsdon 5 miles outside Berwick, at Foulden church, deeply impressing the English contingent. Sir Edward Hoby told his uncle, Baron Burghley:<blockquote>[Arran] not only comported himself with a noble dignity and grace but was in truth a king, binding and loosing at his pleasure &hellip; surely he carrieth a princely presence and gait, goodly of personage &hellip; very resolute, very wise and learned and one of the best spoken men that ever I heard: a man worthy of the Queen's favour, if it please her. (Tytler, 6.218&#150;19)</blockquote>None the less, their growing number of enemies hated Arran and his wife for their perceived arrogance and rapacity, deploring his violent temper and noting with horror that when Lady Gowrie knelt before the king, as he rode to parliament that August, Arran thrust her aside so brutally that she fainted and was left lying on the street until the royal procession had passed.<br>
<br>Arran's ineluctable rise continued unabated. In September 1584 he became chancellor of Scotland on the death of Argyll, and in October he was elected provost of Edinburgh. By February 1585 he had been appointed lieutenant-general of the realm, and James VI and his court sought shelter at Dirleton when there was a serious outbreak of plague in Edinburgh. Arran made even more enemies, however, when he ordered the execution of John Cunningham of Drumquhassill and his son-in-law Malcolm Douglas of Mains, for having conspired in favour of the banished lords. Cunningham had been greatly respected as a leading supporter of the protestant church, and there was much indignation at his death. Arran also had a new rival: Patrick, master of Gray, who had returned to Scotland after some years in France and was high in the king's favour. Young, handsome, charming, and extraordinarily devious, Gray also ingratiated himself with Elizabeth I when James sent him south to discuss the proposed Anglo-Scottish league.<h2>
<a name="Downfallanddeath"></a>Downfall and death</h2>Gray began to build up opposition to Arran and his machinations culminated that summer in Arran's arrest. When Arran attended a day of truce on the borders on 27 July 1585, Sir Francis Russell, son of the second earl of Bedford, was killed in a fracas. On Gray's prompting Edward Wotton, the English ambassador, deliberately put it about that Arran had arranged Russell's death so that the Anglo-Scottish league would be stalled. Wotton told James this version of events, but though the king imprisoned Arran in Edinburgh Castle he allowed him to return to Kinneil after a few days and let it be known that he would still like Arran to be one of the commissioners for the proposed league. Terrified that Arran would be restored to favour and would take revenge on him, Gray sent word to Elizabeth that she should delay the discussions of the league and allow the banished lords to return to Scotland. Elizabeth took this advice. The lords reached Stirling at the beginning of November, denounced Arran, knelt before the king, and begged for his forgiveness. Arran fled. Locking the Northbrig Port of Stirling behind him and throwing the keys into the River Forth, he made for the west, where a ship was waiting to carry him to France. The insane James Hamilton became earl of Arran once more, while the man who had supplanted him reverted to being Captain James Stewart, or Lord Quondam, as his enemies sardonically called him.<br>
<br>Despite being stripped of his titles, lands, and offices, Stewart remained in Scotland. After several months spent in the west and possibly in Ireland, he eventually went north to join his wife on her Lovat jointure lands in Inverness-shire. There he did his best to construct a new power base by courting the friendship of the clan chiefs in the area. Determined to regain his former position of prominence, he rode to Edinburgh in the autumn of 1592 when he heard that his successor as chancellor, John Maitland, now Lord Thirlestane, had retired from court, apparently out of favour. The king received Stewart kindly but the church ministers preached against him, and his influential nephew the third Lord Ochiltree warned him that he would have to make his peace with the church if he hoped for reinstatement. Although Stewart agreed to appear before the presbytery, his lack of repentance for the death of Cunningham of Drumquhassill and other misdeeds was all too obvious and his appeals were rejected.<br>
<br>For the next four years Stewart divided his time between his relatives in Ayrshire and his wife in Inverness-shire. She seems to have died in September 1595, and with the death of Lord Thirlestane a few weeks later Stewart decided to try once more to regain the king's favour. He travelled south with the young second duke of Lennox, who had for the past two years been the king's lieutenant in the north but had resigned his office. Lennox managed to arrange for Stewart to have some conversation with James and, apparently encouraged by his reception, Stewart decided to visit Ayrshire. A friend (or in one version of the story, a witch) warned him that he was risking his life by riding through Douglas territory to get there, for the earl of Morton's relatives had not forgotten that he had been directly responsible for the regent's fall from power. Stewart brushed the warning aside and continued his journey. On 1 December 1596 he was intercepted near Symington by James Douglas of Torthorwald, Morton's nephew, who with a small band of retainers attacked him and hacked him to death. Douglas triumphantly carried off Stewart's head on the tip of his lance. In 1608 Douglas was himself killed by William Stewart, one of Stewart's nephews.<br>
<br>The historian of the Lovat family wrote of James Stewart of Bothwellmuir, &#145;He was a pretty man, a great spirit of bravery and courage: but he was a man full of violence and, when he was in place of rule, executed it with much cruelty&#146;  (Mackay, 221). Stewart's efforts as chancellor to create a league with England and subdue the church ministers did not in fact derive from personal ambition but were in keeping with James VI's own wishes. However, the Scottish nobility were consumed with envy when they saw the extent to which Stewart enjoyed James's favour. The ultra-protestants loathed him, and he made so many enemies in his ruthless rise to power that in the end even the king's protection could not save him.<br>
