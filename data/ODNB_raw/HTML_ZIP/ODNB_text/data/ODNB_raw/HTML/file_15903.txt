<span class="headword">Lake, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1561, <em>d.</em> 1630), <span class="occ">administrator and politician</span>, was the son of Emery (or Almeric) Lake (1519&#150;1594), a minor customs official in Southampton. His date of birth is not known, but he was baptized on 11 October 1561 at St Michael's Church, Southampton, and according to one report was educated at the town's grammar school. It was presumably there that he acquired the good command of Latin which helped advance his career.<h2>
<a name="Therisingadministrator"></a>The rising administrator</h2>By 1584 Lake was in the service of Sir Francis Walsingham, principal secretary of state, and earned the nickname of Swiftsure for his speedy dispatch of business. A sign of Lake's increasing importance was his appointment as one of the clerks of the signet in 1589. It may have been to provide against the possibility of Walsingham's death that Lake acquired the reversion of the town clerkship of Southampton in 1584, but when the secretary did die, in 1590, Lake salvaged his career by adhering to the powerful Cecil family, through whose influence he was elected to the parliaments of 1593 and 1601. On 29 June 1591 he married Mary (1575&#150;1642), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24405/', "William Rider")</script>, alderman and later mayor of London. His first child, Thomas, was probably born in 1595. His second son, Arthur, was baptized in 1598, at which time Lake was living near Charing Cross.<br>
<br>Following Queen Elizabeth's death in March 1603 the council sent Lake to Scotland to inform King James of the state of affairs in his new kingdom. Lake made a good impression, not only on the king but also upon his Scottish followers, and in May 1603 was knighted. There are indications that Robert Cecil, James's principal English minister, resented Lake's growing influence, but he could not counter the influence of the Scots at court, who continued to support their prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Lake also had the advantage of accompanying James on his frequent hunting expeditions, during which, if Sir Anthony Weldon is to be believed, he &#145;would tell tales, and let the king know the passages of court, and great men &hellip; and discovered their bawdry, which did infinitely please the king's humour&#146;  (Weldon, 1.368). In June 1604 the Spanish count of Villa Mediana, on a special embassy to England, reported that James held Lake in high esteem &#145;as he trusts him the most and gives him many duties to perform. He is mentioned for the office of First Secretary which Cecil now holds&#146;  (Loomie, 54).<br>
<br>Lake sat for Launceston in the first parliament of James I's reign, and took advantage of his membership to pilot through a bill securing his title to the Canons estate at Stanmore in Middlesex, which he had purchased two years earlier.<br>
<br>Continuing tensions between the ambitious Lake and Robert Cecil, now earl of Salisbury, came to the surface in 1609 when the minister lessened his workload by dividing his secretarial duties between Lake and Sir Thomas Edmondes. Lake was to be responsible for home affairs, which implied continuous attendance upon the king, but when James left town for Royston in November, Salisbury ordered Edmondes to accompany him. Lake, regarding this as a calculated slight, protested so forcefully that Salisbury reversed his decision. James's attitude was indicated by his appointment of Lake as his Latin secretary in December 1609.<h2>
<a name="FromthedeathofSalisburytotheparliamentof1614"></a>From the death of Salisbury to the parliament of 1614</h2>In April 1612 Salisbury, by now a dying man, set out for Bath to take the waters. He left the signet in Lake's hands &#145;and gave him many good words to the King at the delivery of it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 1.346). Following Salisbury's death in May, James ordered that all official communications should be sent to Lake, but he declined to give him the title of secretary, retaining it for future bestowal. Lake's financial position had been improved by the death of Sir William Rider, his father-in-law, in 1611, and he now offered &pound;15,000 for the secretaryship. However, James still temporized. One well-informed observer suggested that there were two major impediments to Lake's appointment. The first arose from doubts about &#145;his soundness in religion&#146;; the second from the arrogance and ill temper of his wife, who was frequently compared to Xantippe, the termagant spouse of Socrates  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 1.367). There is little doubt that Lake was a covert Catholic, in contrast to his younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15896/', "Arthur Lake")</script>, who became bishop of Bath and Wells in 1616. Lake's London house was next door to that of the Venetian ambassador, who allowed him to make a gateway through the party wall so that he and his family could attend Catholic services in the embassy chapel. The ambassador also reported that at various times Lake and his wife sent him &#145;devotional things, to take care of them, when they were afraid that the house might be searched&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1615&#150;17</i>, 597&#150;9).<br>
<br>Lake's Catholic leanings won him the patronage of the lord treasurer, the earl of Suffolk, who by March 1614 had persuaded James to appoint him as secretary. However, the committed protestants on the council warned the king that this would be unacceptable to members of the forthcoming parliament and would frustrate James's hopes of a harmonious session. James therefore appointed Sir Ralph Winwood, whose protestantism was unequivocal. Lake had to be content with being made a privy councillor. He sat in the 1614 parliament as a knight of the shire for Middlesex and made an early attempt to resolve the dispute over the prerogative taxes known as impositions by proposing that a conference should be held in James's presence. Some weeks later he warned the Commons against drawing up a petition against the new order of baronets on the grounds that this &#145;would not only call the prerogative but the judgment and discretion of the King in question&#146;  (Jansson, 157, 326). As the session drew to its unhappy close he urged members to choose the constructive course of voting supply, rather than being &#145;dissolved without doing any other good&#146;  (ibid., 423), but the house was in no mood for compromise, and the Addled Parliament ended in failure.<h2>
<a name="Secretaryofstateandfamilyscandals"></a>Secretary of state and family scandals</h2>Many Catholic sympathizers distrusted parliament as an institution that gave voice to extreme anti-popish sentiments, but Lake seems to have been an exception. When the privy council discussed how to improve the royal finances in September 1615 he argued that a satisfactory relationship between the king and parliament was essential for the monarchy's reputation. He therefore advocated summoning another parliament, but only after the king had agreed to curb his extravagance.<br>
<br>Lake's implied criticism of James's open-handedness might well have harmed his chances of promotion, but the situation was changing in his favour as the king, disillusioned with parliament, turned towards Spain. Lake's pro-Spanish leanings&#151;no doubt strengthened by the Spanish ambassador's award to him of an annual pension of &pound;500 in 1614&#151;now made him acceptable to James, and in January 1616 he was at last appointed secretary of state. Foreign relations remained the province of Winwood, as senior secretary, but Lake strengthened his position by arranging a marriage between his daughter, Anne [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70622/', "Cecil, Anne")</script>], and Lord Ros, grandson of the earl of Exeter, who was himself the son of Elizabeth I's chief minister, William Cecil, Lord Burghley. Ros was a Catholic, and Lake persuaded James to appoint him ambassador-extraordinary to Spain in order to promote good relations between the two courts.<br>
<br>Further evidence of Lake's standing with the king came in 1617 when he was chosen to accompany James on his state visit to Scotland. However, when Winwood died, in October 1617, the king rejected Lake's request to be given the post of principal secretary. He offered him a barony instead, but when it was pointed out that this would create resentment among the other barons, since Lake, by virtue of his office, would take precedence over them, James changed his mind. Lake was given a choice between the peerage and the secretaryship and chose the latter.<br>
<br>Despite the fact that he was still only junior secretary, Lake seemed well placed for future advancement. But at this very moment he was overtaken by a crisis brought on by his own family. Lake's daughter, Anne, and her husband, Lord Ros, were an ill-assorted couple, and they were soon living apart. Lady Ros insisted that her husband should provide for her upkeep by transferring to her a property in Essex. Failing that, she would make public details of his sexual inadequacy. Lake added to the pressure by threatening that unless Ros complied no exchequer funding would be available for his mission to Spain. Ros was prepared to give way, but his grandfather, the earl of Exeter, had some rights in the property, which he refused to relinquish. This enraged Lady Ros, who had a domineering temperament. She and her mother joined forces to attack the countess of Exeter, the earl's young wife, whom they blamed for his intransigence. They accused her of attempting to poison Lady Ros, and produced a paper, said to be in the countess's hand, in which she acknowledged her guilt. The countess denounced this as a forgery, and the case was brought before the court of Star Chamber.<br>
<br>The entire Lake family, as Chamberlain observed, had now &#145;fallen into a labyrinth, whence they know not how to get out&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 2.145). Lake was not directly implicated, but mounting evidence that his wife and daughter were guilty of forgery as well as slander did little for his reputation. His position was further weakened by accusations of bribery made against his patron, the lord treasurer. Lady Suffolk, who was said to have received the bribes paid to her husband, had taken temporary refuge in the country, but could not for long resist the delights of London. When James heard she was back in town he threatened to have her forcibly removed. Lake reported this to Suffolk, but James accused him of betrayal and virtually suspended him from office. Lake sought assistance from James's new favourite, George Villiers, marquess of Buckingham, offering &pound;15,000 by way of inducement. Buckingham spurned the offer, but Lake was more successful in his appeal to the favourite's mother, who persuaded him to intercede with James on Lake's behalf.<h2>
<a name="Downfallandlastyears"></a>Downfall and last years</h2>By August 1618 Lake appeared to be once more securely established in office, but in February of the following year the Star Chamber gave its judgment in the Exeter case. The countess's charges against Lake's wife and daughter were upheld, and the two women were fined &pound;15,000 and committed to the Tower of London. Lake himself was condemned on the grounds that he had used his official position to secure the imprisonment of two servants of the Ros and Exeter families who had declined to give false evidence against their masters and mistresses. Lake was stripped of the secretaryship, fined &pound;5000, and sent to join his family in the Tower.<br>
<br>Lake remained incarcerated until July 1619, when he was released on health grounds. He continued to protest his innocence of the charges made against him, but he had no wish to return to prison and in January 1620 he reluctantly agreed &#145;to make his personal submission and acknowledgement in the Star Chamber &hellip; and to confess the judgment there given upon him to be most just for his gross credulity, indulgence and ignorance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 2.284).<br>
<br>Lake did not give up hope of recovering his position, particularly after the disgrace of Secretary Naunton in January 1621. Yet his exclusion from power turned out to be permanent, and he blamed this upon Buckingham. Following his election to parliament in 1626 Lake took an active part in the impeachment proceedings against the favourite, but the failure to topple Buckingham merely confirmed that Lake's political career was over. He lived a retired life at Canons until his death on 17 September 1630; he was buried on 19 October in the parish church of Little Stanmore.<br>
<br>King James is said to have described Lake as &#145;a minister of state fit to serve the greatest prince in Europe&#146;  (Fuller, 14), and there is no doubt that he was a speedy, efficient, and trustworthy administrator. However, Lake's Catholic tendencies and pro-Spanish leanings ceased to be advantages after the collapse of the Spanish marriage negotiations in 1623, and even if James had restored him to the secretaryship it is unlikely that he would have continued in office under Charles I. Lake did not welcome his enforced retirement, but, as Fuller observed, he had the consolation of &#145;having achieved a fair fortune, which he transmitted to posterity&#146;  (Fuller, 14).<br>
