<span class="headword">Currie <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lamb]</span>,  Mary Montgomerie</span>, Lady Currie <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Violet Fane]</span>  (1843&#150;1905), <span class="occ">poet and writer</span>, was born on 24 February 1843 at Littlehampton, Sussex, the eldest among the four children of Charles James Savile Montgomerie Lamb (1816&#150;1856) and (Anna) Charlotte, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gray (<i>bap</i>. 1824, <i>d</i>. 1880), eldest daughter of Arthur Hopwood Gray, draper and, allegedly, smuggler, of Bersted, Sussex. Mary Lamb's grandfather was Sir Charles Montolieu Lamb, second baronet, of Beauport, Sussex, who married Mary, daughter and heir of Archibald Montgomerie, eleventh earl of Eglinton; her great-grandfather was Sir James Bland Burges, afterwards Lamb. At sixteen Charles Lamb eloped with Anna Charlotte, then nineteen. A few weeks after her birth, Mary was sent to her grandparents at Beauport, near Battle, accompanied by a letter from her father confessing his secret marriage. Sir Charles and Lady Mary Lamb had the infant baptized on the billiard table and adopted her. Her father immediately departed with his wife on a tour of Europe and the East, and returned to England a year and a half later a devotee of &#145;the Oriental life&#146;, a proponent of European revolution, and an avowed agnostic.<br>
<br>Mary Lamb's upbringing at Beauport thereafter was, by her own account, unorthodox in the extreme. She wore Turkish dress, as did both her parents, &#145;went barefoot, had no bed, wore no nightgown, and was summoned by the clapping of hands&#146;. She acquired her father's opposition to established religion and his vegetarianism, and throughout her life encouraged romantic tales of her mother's &#145;gipsy blood&#146;. She also absorbed the influence of her father's many literary friends and acquaintances, including Edward Bulwer-Lytton, George Borrow, and Edward Fitzgerald. Charles Lamb died in 1856, blind and deserted by his wife, without succeeding to the baronetcy. Lady Sophia Eglinton, wife of the fourteenth earl, took over Mary Lamb's education and brought her out in London society, where she soon met with considerable success. She etched the illustrations for a reprint of Tennyson's <span class="italic">Mariana</span> (Worthing, 1863) and began to pursue a literary career.<br>
<br>On 27 February 1864 Mary Lamb married Henry Sydenham Singleton (1818/19&#150;1893) of Mell, co. Louth, and Hazeley, Hampshire, an Irish landowner. Her first book-length publication, a volume of passionate love poetry entitled <span class="italic">From Dawn to Noon</span>, appeared in 1872 under the pseudonym Violet Fane. The name was taken from a character in Disraeli's <span class="italic">Vivian Grey</span> (she later claimed to have forgotten the source) and remained her primary <i>nom de plume</i>, though for newspaper and magazine publication she sometimes preferred anonymity, the single initial &#145;V&#146;, or, on occasion, Pamela, Kajin, or Vera. <span class="italic">From Dawn to Noon</span> rapidly became a <i>succ&egrave;s de scandale</i>. The poems were widely understood to be addressed to Clare Vyner, a wealthy Yorkshire squire with whom Mary Lamb had fallen in love in the early 1860s and whose refusal to marry her had precipitated her into the match with the much older Singleton. Several more volumes followed: <span class="italic">Denzil Place: a Story in Verse</span> (1875), published in America as <span class="italic">Constance's Fate</span> (savaged by the press for its sympathetic portrayal of an adulterous woman), a more sentimental verse narrative, <span class="italic">The Queen of the Fairies</span> (1876), and a drama in prose and verse, <span class="italic">Anthony Babington</span> (1877). Her <span class="italic">Collected Verses</span> was published in 1880.<br>
<br>A beautiful and charming woman, with a reputation for original and witty conversation, Violet Fane was a well-known figure in London society of the 1870s and 1880s. W. H. Mallock dedicated his satire <span class="italic">The New Republic</span> (1877) to her, and represented her as the unhappily married and captivating Mrs Sinclair &#145;who has published a volume of poems, and is a sort of fashionable London Sappho&#146;  (p. 27). Oscar Wilde frequented her house in Grosvenor Place and solicited two poems from her for the <span class="italic">Woman's World</span> magazine. Other members of her coterie included Robert Browning, Algernon Swinburne, A. W. Kinglake, Alfred Austin, the duchess of Argyll (Princess Louise), James McNeil Whistler, and Lillie Langtry. Mrs Singleton's love affairs grew ever more complicated, and a source of much gossip in the scandal sheets of the day. In the early 1870s she exchanged illicit vows with Philip Henry Wodehouse Currie of the Foreign Office (see below). Their liaison rapidly became an open secret, and she acted as his hostess at entertainments for foreign dignitaries. Her involvement with Vyner nevertheless continued for several years, and in 1880 she also had a more discreet affair with Currie's cousin, the poet and traveller Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, whose diaries provide the most detailed account of her life beside her own (incomplete and unpublished) memoirs.<br>
<br>Mary Singleton's love life provided the inspiration for most of her verse and prose. In 1877&#150;8 she wrote a series of sketches for Edmund Yates's magazine, <span class="italic">The World</span>, collected as the <span class="italic">Edwin and Angelina Papers</span> (1878). The barely disguised account of her acrimonious relationship with her husband (the morose &#145;Edwin&#146;), and her affair with Currie (&#145;D'Arcy&#146;) made it her most scandalous publication to date. Three novels followed: <span class="italic">Sophy, or, The Adventures of a Savage</span> (1881), which drew heavily on memories of her childhood at Beauport and proved her most popular work, going through three editions in its first year; <span class="italic">Thro' Love and War</span> (1886), in which the heroine shamelessly pursues a military man she meets in a railway carriage; and her study of modern womanhood, <span class="italic">The Story of Helen Davenant</span> (1889). She returned to poetry with <span class="italic">Autumn Songs</span> (1889), and in 1892 her poems were again collected, this time handsomely bound in two volumes in a limited edition of 365 copies. In the same year she published her sole work of translation, <span class="italic">Memoirs of Marguerite de Valois, Queen of Navarre</span>.<br>
<br>Henry Singleton, with whom Mary had two sons (Harry and John) and two daughters (Clara and Sophy), died on 16 March 1893, and on 24 January 1894 Mary Singleton married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32674/', "Sir Philip Henry Wodehouse Currie (1834&#150;1906), later Baron Currie of Hawley")</script> and newly appointed British ambassador to Constantinople. She followed him to Pera, where they lived until 1898, then on a second ambassadorial posting to Rome. During her time abroad she published regularly in English magazines, principally the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Magazine</span> and <span class="italic">Ladies' Realm</span>, and produced two volumes of poetry: <span class="italic">Under Cross and Crescent</span> (1896) and <span class="italic">Betwixt Two Seas: Poems and Ballads Written at Constantinople and Therapia</span> (1900). To the amusement of the British press, Sultan Abdul Hamid II, seeking favour with the British embassy, ordered a translation of her poems into Turkish. In her last years she contributed to a number of periodicals, using her own name. Her prose essays were reprinted in <span class="italic">Two Moods of a Man</span> (1901) and <span class="italic">Collected Essays</span> (1902). The Curries retired to Hawley, Hampshire, in 1903, accompanied by Clara's daughter Pera, whose upbringing they had taken over. Lady Currie died of heart failure on 13 October 1905 while staying at the Grand Hotel, Harrogate. She was buried in the family vault at Mattingley church, Hawley, near Winchfield, Hampshire, on 18 October.<br>
<br>During her lifetime several of Violet Fane's poems were set to music, notably &#145;For Ever and For Ever&#146; by Sir Paolo Tosti. Lillie Langtry's memoirs capture the predominant response of contemporaries to her work, recalling her as a writer of &#145;ardent love poems, which in those hypocritical days were considered highly improper&#146;. Regarded, in her own time, as a late-Victorian Laetitia Landon, she is now more likely to find attention as a writer of (in Wilfrid Scawen Blunt's words) &#145;very superior society verse&#146;.<br>
