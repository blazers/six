<span class="headword">Plume,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1630, <em>d.</em> 1704), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and educational benefactor</span>, was baptized on 18 August 1630 at All Saints', Maldon, Essex, the second son of Thomas Plume, alderman of Maldon, coal merchant and landowner, and his third wife, Helen. Educated at Chelmsford grammar school, Plume was admitted to Christ's College, Cambridge, on 24 February 1646, matriculating on 11 July of that year. He graduated BA in 1650.<br>
<br>The details of Plume's life are unclear in the decade following his graduation. He did not follow his father's presbyterian leanings, but instead received clandestine episcopal ordination during the 1650s. He may have been living near Cheam in Surrey, where the staunch Anglican John Hacket had been allowed to retain the rectory when deprived of his other livings; it was certainly during this period that Hacket became Plume's friend and mentor. Hacket's influence may have secured Plume the vicarage of Greenwich, to which he was instituted by Richard Cromwell on 22 September 1658. Hacket also helped secure Plume's admission as BD at Cambridge, <i>per literas regis</i>, in 1661. Hacket was instituted as bishop of Lichfield the same year, and employed Plume as his agent in London, particularly in purchasing books. On 16 March 1667 Hacket noted that he had promised Plume &#145;the next prebend that shall be void&#146; at Lichfield, but died three years later before honouring this promise  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 54, fol. 108). He left Plume two volumes of manuscript sermons, which Plume published as <span class="italic">A Century of Sermons upon Several Remarkable Subjects</span> (1675), with <span class="italic">An Account of the Life and Death of J. Hacket</span>.<br>
<br>During the 1660s Plume accumulated other benefices, including the sinecures of the deserted parish of Merston, Kent, in 1662, and Little Easton, Essex, in 1665. On 10 June 1679 Plume was instituted as archdeacon and prebendary of Rochester, and lived at Longfield Court, the archdeacon's residence, until his death there on 20 November 1704. He was buried at Longfield four days later.<br>
<br>Plume used his prosperity to create a purpose-built library in his native town. Before his death he purchased approximately 7400 books and pamphlets. W. J. Petchey argued that these were bought deliberately to create a public library, and not merely as Plume's personal collections. Most were English publications, mainly pre-1649, but there were also works published in Aberdeen, Waterford, Amsterdam, Antwerp, Paris, Lyons, Cologne, Leipzig, and Geneva, and from Poland, Sweden, and Denmark. They included texts in Hebrew, Persian, Syriac, Coptic, and Greek as well as Latin and English, and included protestant and Catholic sermons and other works of religious controversy and theology, editions of medieval chronicles, legal treatises, and classical texts, and editions, biographies, and books on astronomy, political theory, and education. They also included titles previously owned by Francis Bacon, Cardinal Richelieu, the duke of Pomerania, and the elector of Brandenburg. The library also contained 1530 pamphlets, mostly in English on English subjects. By his death Plume had assembled the books and converted the rooms above his endowed school in Maldon to house them. The library, significantly, contained no space for expansion, and only &pound;1 per annum was provided for the acquisition of new books. Plume appears to have intended his bequest as a definitive repository of knowledge which could be drawn upon by neighbouring clergy and gentry. The pre-1649 bias in the library's contents may have indicated Plume's desire to return to pre-civil war learning, and to advance the physical and intellectual restoration of the church.<br>
<br>In his will Plume restored dissolved chantry lands near Maldon to spiritual purposes by endowing a weekly lectureship in the town, and funding six poor boys at his school. He also paid &pound;200 to establish a workhouse to employ the poor of Maldon. Plume's other charitable bequests were intended to strengthen the church and relieve poverty in Kent. He donated four houses, &#145;the Archdeacon's Almshouses&#146;, to the parish of Deptford, and gave &pound;100 to Bromley College. He also established a charitable fund to enable the marriage of ten young women under the age of twenty-four (five from Chatham, five from Rochester). His will stated that despite being a bachelor this bequest was to show that he &#145;had no ill opinion of marriage&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/481, fol. 103<i>v</i>). He gave &pound;1000 to augment parish livings in the diocese of Rochester and to fund a weekly lecture at Dartford or Gravesend.<br>
<br>Plume's other bequest was &pound;1902 12<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. to erect an astronomical observatory and create a professorship of astronomy and experimental philosophy at Cambridge. The intentions behind this bequest are obscure. There is nothing to support the eighteenth-century view that Plume made the bequest after reading Huygens's <span class="italic">Cosmotheros</span> on John Flamsteed's recommendation. This work was published at the end of Plume's life (1698), and was &#145;an imaginative exercise akin to science fiction&#146;  (Petchey, <span class="italic">Intention</span>, 3&#150;4). Although Plume's vicarage at Greenwich was adjacent to the new Royal Observatory, Plume had no demonstrable links to the Royal Society, and his library shows no bias towards cosmology. His will envisages the professor dispensing applied knowledge &#145;of Astronomy, the Globes, Navigation, natural Philosophy, dialling and other practicall parts of the Mathematicks&#146;, rather than engaging in pure research  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/481, fol. 106<i>r</i>). The professor was to have few other formal duties.<br>
<br>Plume left the exact provisions of the post to the discretion of the trustees, Francis Thompson DD of Gonville and Caius College, Dr Covell, master of Christ's College, Richard Bentley, master of Trinity College, and William Whiston, Lucasian professor of mathematics, with the advice of Isaac Newton and Sir John Ellis, master of Caius. The chair was established by letters patent on 11 June 1707, and funded by lands purchased at Balsham, Cambridgeshire.<br>
<br>Under Bentley's auspices an observatory was constructed over the great gate at Trinity. In 1737 it contained &#145;divers large Telliscops&#146;, other &#145;Mathematicall Instruments&#146;, and &#145;a double barrelled Pneumatick Machine&#146; with a cupola containing &#145;two Telliscopes&#146;  (CUL, Add. MS 3466). Thereafter the observatory and professorship were neglected, and the observatory was removed in 1797.<br>
