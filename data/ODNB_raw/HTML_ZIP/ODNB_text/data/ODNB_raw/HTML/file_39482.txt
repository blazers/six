<span class="headword">Hardoon,  Silas Aaron</span>  (1851&#150;1931), <span class="occ">merchant and property owner</span>, was born in Baghdad, one of the six children of Aaron Hardoon. He moved with his family to Bombay about 1856. His family was poor and he received only an elementary education, possibly supported by the local Baghdadi Jewish community.<br>
<br>Hardoon's career was made within the trading diaspora of Baghdadi Jews in India and in east Asia. Employed while still in his teens by David Sassoon &amp; Co., the major Baghdadi Jewish merchant house in Asia, he was transferred to its Hong Kong office about 1868, and then to its Shanghai branch in 1874. In its early years the firm competed with Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. in exporting opium from India to China. About 1882 Hardoon left David Sassoon &amp; Co. and after a brief engagement as cotton broker, he joined E. D. Sassoon &amp; Co. (a firm established by one of the sons of David Sassoon) either in 1886 or 1887. In the later nineteenth century E. D. Sassoon &amp; Co. was advancing into cotton mills, brewing, paper mills, shipping, tramways, and banking. Hardoon acted as manager and, after 1893, as partner, and mainly handled opium imports and purchase of properties. He severed his association with this enterprise in 1911.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in 1901 Hardoon had founded the Hardoon Company, which also dealt in opium and real estate. It remains difficult to assess the degree of his involvement in the opium trade, but it was probably not the focus of his operations. The key to his commercial success was his continuous and far-sighted purchase of properties in the central district of the Shanghai international settlement, where the value of land rose dramatically after the beginning of the century. In 1916 he became the major owner of properties along Nanking Road, which was the main commercial thoroughfare. He served as councillor of the Conseil Municipal Fran&ccedil;ais of the Shanghai Concession Fran&ccedil;aise from 1892 until 1903. He was also elected, from 1900 until 1904, to the same position in the British-dominated Shanghai municipal council, where he represented the interests of E. D. Sassoon &amp; Co.<br>
<br>Apart from his economic achievements, Hardoon is mostly remembered for his strong ties with Chinese society. His marriage on 26 September 1886 to Liza Roos (1864&#150;1941), more commonly known as Luo Jialing, a Eurasian Buddhist who identified almost exclusively with her Chinese background, reinforced these links. They married according to Chinese rites, but in 1928 they also entered into a British civil marriage in the Shanghai British consulate-general. Although Hardoon and his wife did not have any offspring, they jointly adopted eleven foreign children who were brought up as Jews. Luo Jialing also adopted numerous Chinese children under her Chinese surname Luo.<br>
<br>Hardoon sponsored the reprinting of the canon of sacred Buddhist texts (accomplished about 1913), and also funded other Buddhist enterprises, such as the construction of the Pingshe retreat house. Such projects were conceived under the influence of his wife. After the foundation of the Chinese republic in 1911, Hardoon also financed educational and cultural activities within the most conservative Chinese intellectual circles, and he became well respected as a philanthropist. The Peking government duly bestowed on him at least twelve decorations in the seven years following 1917, including, in 1924, the first-class decoration of the Zhaowu order with Big Belt, possibly the highest honour ever conferred on a foreigner.<br>
<br>Hardoon remained a regular contributor to the religious and philanthropic activities of the Shanghai Jewish community. In 1925 he donated the funds to build the Beth Aharon Synagogue. His participation in community affairs was, however, considered lukewarm compared with his more enthusiastic support for Chinese causes and attracted censure from the Jewish community.<br>
<br>When Hardoon died, on 19 June 1931 at his private residence in Bubbling Well Road, Shanghai, his assets were estimated to be worth $35 million. He was buried on 21 June in his private garden in Shanghai, and Buddhist monks and Daoist priests attended his Jewish Orthodox funeral. An obituary in the <span class="italic">Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury</span> (3 July 1931) described him as a &#145;unique local character&#146;: &#145;He was a blend of all faiths and hopes, a talented man who lived his life in an exotic setting as he thought best&#146;  (<span class="italic">Israel's Messenger</span>, 3 July 1931). Above all, however, he was during the last quarter of his life the pre-eminent property owner in the international settlement and one of the richest foreigners in east Asia.<br>
