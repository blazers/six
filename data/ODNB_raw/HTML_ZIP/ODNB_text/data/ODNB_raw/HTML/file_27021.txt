<span class="headword">Taylor,  Charles</span>  (1756&#150;1823), <span class="occ">engraver and biblical scholar</span>, was born on 1 February 1756 near Brentwood, Essex, the eldest of the five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27032/', "Isaac Taylor (1730&#150;1807)")</script>, engraver, and his wife, Sarah Hackshaw Jefferys (1733&#150;1809). Evidence about his schooling is unclear, but he probably spent time at Sir Anthony Browne's school, Brentwood, before briefly attending a school in the City of London. At the age of sixteen he was articled to his father as an engraver and is believed to have studied under Francesco Bartolozzi. On 27 May 1777 he married Mary Forrest (<i>b</i>. 1754), daughter of Edward and Mary Forrest of Isleworth, Middlesex, and Carmarthen; they had one son and two daughters. Taylor spent the following twelve months in Paris, still then regarded as the principal school of engraving. The precise nature and scope of his studies in Paris are obscure, but he appears to have frequented the king's library. As a scholar he appears to have been largely self-taught, mastering not only Latin and Greek, but also Hebrew and &#145;two or three modern languages&#146;  (Taylor, &#145;The family pen&#146;, 2&#150;3).<br>
<br>On his return to London in 1778 Taylor set up home and business at 114 High Holborn, producing engravings after pictures by Robert Smirke and Angelica Kauffmann. Early in 1780 he moved to 8 Dyers Buildings, Holborn, but was briefly forced to flee with his family when Landell's distillery near by was set on fire during the Gordon riots. At this time he was involved, with his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27033/', "Isaac Taylor (1759&#150;1829)")</script>, whom he briefly employed, in the engraving and publishing of illustrations to the plays of Shakespeare  (<span class="italic">The Picturesque Beauties of Shakespeare</span>, 1783&#150;7), which attracted favourable notice from John Boydell. In 1785 he moved to 10 Holborn and finally, in 1796, to 108 Hatton Garden. In the late 1780s he began to publish, under the pseudonym Francis Fitzgerald, volumes also containing the work of other engravers, including <span class="italic">The Cabinet of Genius</span> (1787) and <span class="italic">The Elegant Repository and New Print Magazine</span> (1791&#150;2).<br>
<br>Although Taylor's income came from engraving and later also from publishing, in both of these fields he was surpassed, respectively, by his brothers Isaac and Josiah (1761&#150;1834). In his brother Isaac's opinion, &#145;he had some artistic feeling, but no delicacy of touch&#146;  (Taylor MSS, HD 588/4/14). Charles Taylor's renown was founded upon a quite different accomplishment. In his seventeenth year he had by chance come upon a copy of Calmet's <span class="italic">Dictionnaire historique et critique de la Bible</span> (1734). This massive work of scholarship fired his imagination, and he determined then and there that he would produce a new edition of it, in English, with a commentary of his own. It was a further twenty-six years before, in 1797, he felt ready to begin to publish the results of his labours. There is evidence that he at first sought sponsorship for the project in his own name. The rebuff that he received, at least from the bishop of London, was perhaps what persuaded him to publish anonymously, and thereafter, as further instalments and then further editions appeared, to refuse to acknowledge any connection with the work, beyond those of publisher and engraver. In the judgement of his nephew, Isaac Taylor, the work itself was too important to Charles Taylor to allow him to risk its being discounted by the academic establishment through association with himself&#151;&#145;a layman, a Nonconformist, a member of the university&#146;  (Taylor, &#145;The family pen&#146;, 9&#150;10). The reception by the learned world of the first sample of his revision and commentary (in the form of dissertations entitled &#145;Fragments&#146;), illustrated by himself, was enthusiastic, enhanced no doubt by the mystery then surrounding the identity of the author. Even the archbishop of Canterbury enquired diligently who he might be. Taylor's edition of Calmet, which drew upon a wide range of new sources, especially in Jewish and oriental literature, became for many years a model for biblical scholarship.<br>
<br>Eventually the edition of Calmet was a financial, as well as a scholarly, success. However, in January 1798, shortly after its publication, Taylor was in sufficiently straitened circumstances to be briefly imprisoned for debt at the suit of one Robert Wright, a carpenter. He later inherited the bulk of his father's fortune, including properties in London and Essex, but this seems not at all to have altered his frugal and industrious way of life. Taylor also edited two periodicals, the <span class="italic">Literary Annual Register</span> and its successor, the <span class="italic">Literary Panorama</span>&#151;to which he contributed well-received articles on political economy and state policy. For some years he served as honorary librarian to the London Library Society, founded in 1785. Indeed, in 1801 the library itself was moved to his premises at 108 Hatton Garden, where it remained for several years. He wrote several other books and pamphlets on art and on religious topics, including <span class="italic">Facts and Evidences on the Subject of Baptism</span> (1815) and <span class="italic">A Familiar Treatise on Perspective</span> (1816).<br>
<br>Charles Taylor was, like his brother Isaac and like his forebears on his mother's side, a dissenter, and a regular worshipper at the Old Meeting-House in Fetter Lane, Holborn. He was, however, by temperament a deeply conservative man and, despite an early flirtation with the ideas of the Arian theologian William Whiston, as orthodox in his theological opinions as he was extraordinary and even eccentric in his intellectual range and habits. He was, in apparent contrast to his father, who had supported Wilkes, a &#145;thorough-going Tory&#146;  (Taylor, &#145;The family pen&#146;, 9). In appearance he was, according to his nephew Isaac:<blockquote>a man&#151;then just past mid-life&#151;powerful in bony and muscular framework&#151;singularly hirsute&#151;well limbed, well filled out, erect in walk, prominent and aquiline in feature&#151;teeming, as one should say, with repressed energy. (ibid., 4)</blockquote>His niece, Ann Gilbert's, picture is of a:<blockquote>tall figure, slightly bending, or appearing to do so, from the habit of constantly walking with his left arm under his coat behind, his full grey hair turned loosely back, a plain, shrewdly good-natured countenance, with always a welcome, a queer speech or a pun, on his lips. (Gilbert, 153&#150;4)</blockquote>Charles Taylor's brother Isaac, by no means an envious or ungenerous man, &#145;never regarded him as learned&#146;  (Taylor MSS, HD 588/4/14) and attributed his achievements to a facility for epigraphy, acquired through a natural shrewdness supplemented by practice, and to a quite extraordinary memory, which gave him almost total recall of anything he read even many years afterwards.<br>
<br>Charles Taylor died of asthma on 13 November 1823, at his home, 108 Hatton Garden, London, and was buried with several of his maternal forebears in the family vault in the Bunhill Fields burial-ground, Finsbury, London.<br>
