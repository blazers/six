<span class="headword">Thornton <span class="st"> [Meynell]</span>,  Alicia</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1804), <span class="occ">horsewoman</span>, is of uncertain lineage (her name is sometimes given as Alicia Meynell), the daughter possibly of a Norwich watchmaker or an Essex landowner. Her fame rests very largely on a race she rode, side-saddle over 4 miles, at Knavesmire at the 1804 York races. It was proclaimed in <span class="italic">The Times</span> of 14 August as &#145;unprecedented in the annals of the turf&#146;, and was run before what was probably the century's biggest crowd attracted by a sportswoman. Her opponent was her brother-in-law Captain T. Flint, and the match appears to have arisen after she had beaten him in an informal gallop. The stake was 500 guineas a side, but there was said also to be a large side-bet made by the wealthy landowner <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27364/', "Colonel Thomas Thornton")</script>, described as her husband, whose horse Vinigrillo she was riding. <span class="italic">The Times</span> of 28 August claimed that there was well over &pound;2 million depending on the match.<br>
<br>On the race day Alicia was a striking sight in her close-fitting leopard-coloured jacket with blue sleeves and cap, and with a buff skirt enveloping her side-saddle. Although Flint had demanded that she should ride always on his left side, so inhibiting her use of the whip, she led for most of the race: &#145;her <i>close-seated</i> riding astonished the beholders, and inspired a general confidence in her success&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sporting Magazine</span>, August 1804, 227). After 3 miles, however, her saddle girth slipped, she could not keep up the pace, and then her horse went lame, to the disappointment of most of the crowd. Some days later, on 1 September, a letter appeared above her name in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, complaining of Flint's discourtesy and challenging him to a rematch. This never took place as Thornton refused to pay the 1000 guineas side-bet, maintaining that the wager was purely nominal, to heighten interest: York was then trying desperately to draw back the crowds it had lost with the recent ending of public hangings on the course on the morning of the races.<br>
<br>Subsequently, at the next year's meeting, in August 1805, the captain horsewhipped the colonel, who later took him to court&#151;and won. This incident took place immediately after Alicia had ridden again, this time beating the best-known jockey of the day, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52816/', "Frank Buckle")</script>, albeit with a considerable weight advantage. Again her riding amazed spectators, and stage imitations of her feats followed. Her performances also raised considerable interest in the sporting press on the problems of riding side-saddle, with one eminent breeches maker intriguingly claiming that &#145;by means of a simple contrivance, he could remove all objections to a lady's sitting astride&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sporting Magazine</span>, September 1804, 281). As for Alicia, she seems to have disappeared from public view. Although she was referred to in court and elsewhere as Mrs Thornton there are strong doubts about her true marital status. She was said to have eloped with a soldier in 1806. Colonel Thornton was reported to be a widower when he married, in July 1806, Eliza Cawston of Mundon, Essex, described, more soberly than Alicia ever was, as &#145;an accomplished lady of some fortune&#146;  (Egan, 133).<br>
