<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clifford, Sir  Hugh Charles</span>  (1866&#150;1941), <span class="occ">colonial governor and author</span>, was born in London on 5 March 1866, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5651/', "Major-General Sir Henry Hugh Clifford (1826&#150;1883)")</script> and grandson of the seventh Baron Clifford of Chudleigh. His mother was Josephine Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1913), only child of Joseph Anstice, of Madeley Wood, Shropshire, a professor of classics at King's College, London. A member of a west country recusant family, he was educated at Woburn Park under Mgr William Joseph Petre. Although he passed for Sandhurst, reduced family circumstances following the death of his father resulted in his taking immediate employment offered by a kinsman, Sir Frederick Weld, who was governor of the Straits Settlements.<br>
<br>Clifford arrived in Malaya in 1883 aged seventeen. The British then administered the colony of the Straits Settlements while in the west coast Malay states residents were establishing an &#145;advisory system&#146; to disguise British control under a cloak of Malay sovereignty. Clifford's first posting outside Singapore was as secretary to Hugh Low, the venerable resident of Perak. In 1887 Weld dispatched Clifford on a mission to the east coast state of Pahang, where he successfully persuaded its ruler to accept British control of external affairs. Clifford was then appointed British agent in Pahang, but his powers were limited and within a year Sir Cecil Clementi-Smith, Weld's successor as governor, compelled the sultan to upgrade the British agent to resident. A senior official, John Rodger, was appointed to this position while Clifford sailed to England with acute dysentery. He returned in 1890 as superintendent of Ulu Pahang (the interior), where between 1891 and 1895 he led the suppression of armed resistance. Once this was settled, Clifford was advanced to resident of Pahang, which in 1896 became part of the Federated Malay States. For Clifford adventure gave way to administration as he moved from the frontier to the secretariat. In 1900 he was seconded to the British North Borneo Company and served as governor of North Borneo until a dispute with the directors led to his resignation. He returned briefly to Malaya, but in September 1901 sickness once again overwhelmed him. Poisoning was suspected and he sailed for England, apparently broken in health.<br>
<br>During 1901&#150;3 he slowly recuperated in his mother's grace-and-favour apartment in Hampton Court palace and supplemented his half pay by writing. Clifford had become fluent in Malay, recorded his observations, and assiduously collected data on indigenous peoples. He presented papers to learned societies, such as the Royal Geographical Society, and produced <span class="italic">Further India: being the story of exploration from the earliest times in Burma, Malaya, Siam, and Indo-China</span> (1904). He also contributed articles on topical subjects to the press and wrote semi-autobiographical short stories, the first collection being published as <span class="italic">East Coast Etchings</span> (1896) and in a revised form as <span class="italic">In Court and Kampong</span> (1897). Other stories followed in <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">Temple Bar</span>, <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, and <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>; and further collections appeared: <span class="italic">Studies in Brown Humanity</span> (1898), <span class="italic">In a Corner of Asia</span> (1899), and <span class="italic">Bushwhacking and other Sketches</span> (1901). His first novel, <span class="italic">Since the Beginning</span>, came out in 1898. Thus, when ill health obliged him to write for a living, he was building on an established reputation and within a literary circle which included Joseph Conrad. His stories cover the poignant interaction of Europe and Asia, illustrated by the predicament of the political officer alone in an alien and potentially hostile environment or the fatal impact of modernization upon Malays. For example, Saleh, the eponymous hero of two novels, is educated in England but rejected by the English when he woos his host's daughter. On his return to his father's court he dies while leading an armed rising. In the foreword to <span class="italic">Saleh: a Sequel</span> Clifford spells out the dangers of the British &#145;endeavouring to impose on their Oriental brethren education of a purely Occidental type&#146;, which the fictional British officer endorses with the lament: &#145;May God forgive us for our sorry deeds and for our glorious intentions!&#146;<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1903 Clifford was passed fit for tropical service, but was not restored to Malaya. As colonial secretary in Trinidad (1903&#150;7) and Ceylon (1907&#150;12) he managed well-established bureaucracies, but, when he was promoted to governorships in west Africa, he encountered rudimentary ones. As governor of the Gold Coast (1912&#150;19) he overhauled the administration, reformed the legislative council, invested in public works, and vastly improved the living conditions and hence the morale of public servants. In doing so he paved the way for developments under his successor, Sir Gordon Guggisberg. When he was promoted governor of Nigeria (1919&#150;25) Clifford set about rectifying what he condemned as the administrative chaos of Sir Frederick Lugard's amalgamation of Northern and Southern Nigeria. Superhuman stints in the office and extensive tours of the countryside resulted in voluminous dispatches, addresses, and memoranda. He revelled in the written and spoken word, shifted paper at speed, made systems, and made them work. In each territory he was indefatigable, bringing to administration the same vigour that had characterized his youthful exploits on the frontier and usually applying to the problems of &#145;native administration&#146; the yardsticks of Malaya. But his manic energy and occasional bouts of depression exhausted subordinates and worried superiors.<br>
<br>Hugh Clifford was twice married: first in 1896 to Mary Ann, or Minna (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1870), daughter of Gilbert &agrave; Beckett. They had one son and two daughters. Their son was killed on the Somme in 1916, as was Clifford's younger brother. Minna died following an accident in Trinidad in 1907. In 1910 he married Elizabeth Lydia Rosabel (1866&#150;1945), daughter of Edward Bonham and widow of Henry de la Pasture. Writing as Mrs de la Pasture she was a popular novelist; her daughter from her first marriage published under the name of E. M. Delafield.<br>
<br>In 1925 Clifford was promoted to Ceylon, where he remained just two years until Malaya became vacant, but long enough to set in train a major constitutional review carried out by the Donoughmore commission (1927&#150;8). For Clifford the years spent away from Malaya had been years of exile, but his governorship of Malaya (1927&#150;9) is more remarkable as the last chapter in a personal odyssey than for its impact on the country. Ironically, his greatest administrative achievements had been outside Malaya, particularly in west Africa. By now he was over sixty, exhausted, and on the verge of breakdown. Some say it was the agony of trying to reconcile modern Malaya with the land of his youth that precipitated collapse; but the demands of more than forty years of overseas service had taken their toll, resulting in increasingly eccentric behaviour. Signs of mental imbalance cut short his term, and in October 1929 he departed Malaya for ever. It was a distressing end to a major proconsular career. Instead of enjoying a respected retirement&#151;it was rumoured that a peerage might have been added to his GCMG (1921) and GBE (1925)&#151;he was eventually confined to The Priory at Roehampton, where he died of broncho-pneumonia on 18 December 1941, ten days after the start of the Japanese invasion of Malaya.<br>
<br>Well over 6 feet tall and bald from early adulthood, Clifford was an imposing man with strong emotions and an almost theatrical physicality. His exploits were legendary, while his disputes assumed a magnificence that obscured their frequently petty origins. Personal magnetism and a self-indulgent charm earned him the reputation of a ladies' man and revealed a romanticism touched with tragedy which permeated his life and cast a cruelly pathetic shadow over his last years.<br>
