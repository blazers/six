<span class="headword">Barker, Sir  William</span>  (1909&#150;1992), <span class="occ">diplomatist and Russian scholar</span>, was born on 19 July 1909 at 3 Plank Lane, Leigh, Lancashire, the eldest of the three children of Alfred Barker, master baker and later licensed victualler, and his wife, Annie, formerly Arden (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Atherton). He was educated at Leigh grammar school; Liverpool University, where he took first-class honours in Russian studies; and Charles University, Prague, where he obtained a doctorate for a dissertation on &#145;the influence of Lord Byron on the poet, dramatist, and journalist J. V. Fri&#269; (1829&#150;1890)&#146;. The thesis was supervised by Professor Vil&eacute;m Mathesius and Professor Ji&#345;i Hor&aacute;k. Barker taught for a number of years at the English grammar school in Prague, but returned shortly before the Second World War to take up a post in adult education in Durham. On 19 August 1939 he married Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1911), a graduate teacher, daughter of Thomas Beirne, coalminer. They had a daughter and a son.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war Barker joined the intelligence corps and was at first posted to the Bletchley Park code-breaking centre; but following the fall of France he was transferred to serve as a liaison officer with the Czechoslovak forces in Britain. In April 1943 he was seconded to the Foreign Office, and two years later he returned to Prague as first secretary in the British embassy when it was reopened at the end of the war. From 1947 to 1951 he served in Moscow, where, as head of the embassy's &#145;Russian secretariat&#146;, he made his mark as an expert interpreter of Soviet politics. Postings followed to Oslo (1951&#150;4), Boston, Massachusetts (as consul-general, 1954&#150;5), Washington DC (1955&#150;60), and Moscow again (1960&#150;63) as minister. Thereafter he held a fellowship at Harvard University Centre for International Affairs (1963&#150;4); and was assistant under-secretary of state in the Foreign Office (1965&#150;6) and ambassador to Czechoslovakia (1966&#150;8). After retirement from the diplomatic service in December 1968 he was appointed Bowes professor of Russian at Liverpool University, a post he held from 1969 to 1976.<br>
<br>As a Slavonic linguist Barker was one of only a handful to emerge in Britain between the wars (remarkably, another was his own school contemporary G. H. Bolsover, later director of London University school of Slavonic and East European studies). By temperament a thinker rather than a man of action, he would probably have devoted his life to education had it not been for the war. His versatility however was attested by the fact that, though entering the Foreign Office at the relatively late age of thirty-four, he attained the highest rank in the service. His subsequent return to his alma mater, though personally gratifying, left insufficient time to consolidate his earlier scholarly promise.<br>
<br>Barker's two areas of expertise&#151;linguistic and cultural studies and political analysis&#151;complemented each other perfectly. This was well illustrated by his contact with and reaction to the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchov. In April 1956 Barker was summoned from Washington to act as principal interpreter with Khrushchov and Bulganin during their celebrated visit to Britain. This experience gave him valuable insight into the Soviet leader's personality. He referred to it when delivering his inaugural lecture, &#145;N. S. Khrushchev: an assessment&#146;, at Liverpool on 4 December 1969: in this he offered a severely critical appraisal of Khrushchov as a state and party leader, concluding, however, with a typically humane comment: &#145;But you can't help liking the man!&#146;.<br>
<br>The USSR was the state whose politics were the most important subject of Barker's attention as diplomat and academic; but Czechoslovakia was the Slav country which he first encountered and in which he lived for longest. When he returned there in October 1966 as ambassador, his pre-war experience and wartime and post-war contacts with Czechs and Slovaks stood him in good stead. Nevertheless, the Warsaw pact countries' invasion in August 1968 presented this mild-mannered, meticulous man with the toughest challenge of his career: how to organize the assembly, protection, sustenance, and repatriation of hundreds of British subjects who were caught in Prague. With the aid of the embassy staff and his immediate family he succeeded in this magnificently.<br>
<br>Bill Barker was a modest, kindly, and gracious but intellectually rigorous person, devoted to his family, and a distinguished servant of his country. He was appointed OBE in 1949, CMG in 1958, and KCMG in 1967. He was also awarded the Czechoslovak order of the White Lion. He died from a cerebral thrombosis on 8 January 1992 at his home, 19 Moors Way, Woodbridge, Suffolk. He was survived by his wife and their two children.<br>
