<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bertie,  Francis Leveson</span>, first Viscount Bertie of Thame  (1844&#150;1919), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 17 August 1844 at 48 Charles Street, Mayfair, the second son of Montagu Bertie, sixth earl of Abingdon (1808&#150;1884), and his wife, Elizabeth Lavinia (<i>d</i>. 1858), only daughter of George Granville Vernon Harcourt MP, of Nuneham Courtenay, Oxfordshire. He was educated at Eton College, and entered the Foreign Office by competitive examination in 1863. There he progressed steadily up the professional ladder. From 1874 to 1880 he was private secretary to the Hon. Robert Bourke (afterwards Lord Connemara), parliamentary under-secretary of state for foreign affairs, and in 1878 he was attached to the special embassy of lords Beaconsfield and Salisbury to the congress of Berlin. As acting senior clerk in the Eastern department from 1882 to 1885, years of crisis and tension in central Asia and the Near East, Bertie impressed his superiors with his industry and judgement. Four years later he gained substantive promotion to the rank of senior clerk, and in 1894 became one of the office's two assistant under-secretaries. But sensing that he had reached the peak of his official career in London, he began, after the turn of the century, to seek a post abroad. He had the backing of Edward VII, to whose circle he belonged, and with his assistance he was appointed ambassador to Italy in 1903 and to France in 1905. He retained the Paris embassy for the next thirteen years.<br>
<br>By the time of his transfer to Rome, Bertie was already well known for his hard work, firm resolve, and strong language. Short in temper as well as stature, he was punctilious of etiquette and prone to Rabelaisian outbursts when others failed to meet his rigorous standards. He was a man of great likes and even greater dislikes, easily offended and slow to forgive. Yet, at Paris, where his junior staff nicknamed him &#145;the Bull&#146;, he was also remembered for his geniality, coarse humour, and love of gossip. Neither the arts nor literature were of great interest to him and he engaged in few outside pursuits other than shooting and fishing. He nevertheless maintained great state at the Paris embassy, to which he claimed a hereditary title. One of his ancestors, Lord Norreys of Rycote, had been an envoy of Elizabeth I to the French court; and, on 11 April 1874, Bertie had married Lady Feodorowna Cecilia Wellesley (1840&#150;1920), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29006/', "Henry Wellesley, the first Earl Cowley")</script>, the British ambassador at Paris during the reign of Napoleon III. As if to affirm his right and status, on full-dress occasions Bertie would drive to the neighbouring Elys&eacute;e Palace in a sumptuous coach ornamented with silver fittings and with his coat of arms upon its panels. His robust personality and independence of mind drew from Lord Vansittart, who served him at Paris, the tribute that he was &#145;not only a great ambassador&#151;and therefore troublesome&#151;but <i>the</i> very last of the great ambassadors&#146;  (Lord Vansittart, <span class="italic">The Mist Procession</span>, 1958, 53).<br>
<br>Bertie had, however, found it difficult to adjust to the part of envoy. During his last years at the Foreign Office he had exercised considerable influence in framing policy. He was instrumental in promoting the idea of an Anglo-Japanese alliance as a means of containing Russian ambitions in the Far East, and he fostered the careers of younger diplomats such as his cousin Sir Charles Hardinge. But he was soon bored by Rome and complained that as ambassador he was &#145;only a d&#151;d marionette&#146;. Matters were different at Paris. There he became identified with the transformation of the <i>entente cordiale</i> from a colonial settlement to a close working relationship which had all the appearances but, until 1914, few of the formal obligations, of an alliance. A practitioner of <i>Realpolitik</i>, Bertie initially saw in Britain's friendship with France a means of preventing the emergence of a hostile continental coalition. Later he came to regard it as a way of maintaining the balance of power in Europe against a potentially dominant Germany. Since the 1890s he had been increasingly critical of German diplomacy and he was one of the first Foreign Office officials to recognize the threat posed to Britain by the expansion of the German navy. He opposed any attempt to improve Anglo-German relations that might sap French confidence in the entente, and when in 1905 and 1911 Germany challenged French pretensions in Morocco he urged the British government to give full support to France. Meanwhile, he remained suspicious of the intentions of France's ally Russia, and was at first inclined to blame Russia and Serbia, rather than Germany and Austria-Hungary, for the war crisis of July 1914.<br>
<br>Sir Edward Grey, the British foreign secretary from 1905 to 1916, valued Bertie's advice and allowed him wide discretion in handling relations with the French. After the outbreak of the First World War he agreed that Bertie, who had been due to retire in 1914, should remain ambassador until the end of hostilities. But Bertie soon found himself bypassed by ministers and others engaged in military liaison and planning. Unable to exert his authority over the numerous British missions that emerged in Paris, he was drawn into a personal feud with Lord Esher, who posed as a representative of both the War Office and the prime minister, David Lloyd George. The latter had little respect for traditional diplomatic methods and evidently sympathized with Esher's claims that Bertie was ineffective and out of touch with French opinion. When, in April 1918, Bertie fell ill, Lloyd George initiated a political reshuffle involving Bertie's replacement by the secretary of state for war, the querulous Lord Derby. After returning by hospital ship to England, in June 1918, Bertie recovered slowly but, following an operation, died at 9 Mandeville Place, Marylebone, London, on 26 September 1919; he was buried three days later in the chancel wall of Thame parish church.<br>
<br>Bertie was created KCB in 1902, GCVO in 1903, GCMG in 1904, GCB in 1908, and a privy councillor in 1903. He also received the grand cordon of the French L&eacute;gion d'honneur. He was raised to the peerage under the title of Baron Bertie of Thame in 1915, and advanced to a viscountcy on his retirement in 1918. He had one son, Vere Frederick (1878&#150;1954), who succeeded him as second viscount.<br>
