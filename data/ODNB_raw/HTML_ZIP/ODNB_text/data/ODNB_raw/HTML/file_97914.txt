</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">St Johnston, Sir  (Thomas) Eric</span>  (1911&#150;1986), <span class="occ">police officer</span>, was born at 48 All Saints' Road, King's Heath, King's Norton, Worcestershire, on 7 January 1911, the only son (he had a younger sister) of Thomas Gerald St Johnston (1882&#150;1968), a wine and spirit merchant, and his wife, Ethel Mary Frances Flora, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ryley (<i>b</i>. 1887), whose family were bicycle manufacturers in Coventry. After attending a preparatory school and Bromsgrove School (1924&#150;9), he entered Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he took a third in part one of the mathematical tripos and a second in part two of the law tripos (1932) and excelled at sport. From 1929 to 1935 he held a commission in the Territorial Army. Influenced by his father's cousin, the colonial governor Sir Reginald St Johnston (1881&#150;1950), he was a candidate for the colonial service, but the economic depression had reduced the number of posts, and he missed selection. He had started to read for the bar at the Middle Temple, and was called in 1934.<br>
<br>Unlike nearly all of his ambitious contemporaries St Johnston saw the potential of a career in the Metropolitan Police under Lord Trenchard, who was keen to recruit more graduates. His first job at Scotland Yard, in 1932, was as a civilian junior executive officer in the crime department, initially on a salary comparable with a constable's. After Trenchard set up the Hendon Police College he gained a place on the third course in September 1935, passing out in 1936 at the head of his class of thirty-four. As with many able policemen of his generation, Hendon shaped his career. &#145;Hendon men&#146; dominated the upper ranks of the British police in the 1950s and 1960s, often to the chagrin of those police officers who were not its graduates.<br>
<br>Initially St Johnston followed the customary route for Hendon graduates without police experience: eight months as a constable and four as a sergeant, before being appointed to the rank of junior station inspector in 1938. But his career also exemplified the link between Hendon careers and the Second World War. In June 1940 he was advised by G. H. R. Halland, his commandant at Hendon, now working as an inspector of constabulary, to apply for the post of chief constable of Oxfordshire, and (despite arriving at the interview with a black eye sustained in an arrest the night before) he gained this position at the age of twenty-nine. The Oxfordshire force was run on essentially Victorian lines and had failed to implement many wartime measures. After rectifying this, his next task, at the behest of another patron and inspector of constabulary, Frank Brook, was an attachment in 1943 to the chiefs of staff to the supreme allied commander, the allied staff planning the occupation of Europe. With the rank of lieutenant-colonel he wrote the operating manual for the policing of liberated and occupied countries, and helped to train the officers who would staff the organization. He was in Paris for the liberation in August 1944, and shortly afterwards, in October 1944, took up a new substantive post as chief constable of co. Durham: the Home Office wanted an energetic chief in post to deal with any labour trouble in the event that the mines were not nationalized after the war. In Durham he continued to emphasize modernization, training, and technology: from there, in October 1950, he went to run Lancashire, which with over 3000 officers was the largest force outside London.<br>
<br>As chief constable of Lancashire, with headquarters in Preston, St Johnston relished establishing uniformity over his wide command and modernizing its organization, accommodation, and equipment. In 1953 an advanced police radio system was inaugurated, and an underwater search unit of police divers was set up in 1955, followed in 1957 by a radar instrument to detect speeding motorists. He lobbied successfully to be allowed a year's sabbatical in 1957, and attended the Imperial Defence College, the only police officer to do so between 1946 and 1969. He was awarded the queen's police medal in 1958.<br>
<br>St Johnston's greatest impact on British policing came about through the 1960 royal commission on the police. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) had agreed to arrive at a collective response to the commission and St Johnston was assigned the task of chairing a sub-committee on the scope of the police's role. He characteristically reinterpreted this remit to justify commenting on the best form of police organization. Like nearly all of his colleagues (and the Home Office) he wanted chief constables to be less accountable to police authorities; unlike most of the rest of them he shared the Home Office's desire to amalgamate the borough forces into their surrounding counties, having personally resented the need to co-ordinate the activity of the Lancashire constabulary with the many independent borough forces that were contained within or bordered the county. When his attempt to convince ACPO to send a minority report to the commission failed, he issued his own manifesto, with the tacit approval of the Home Office, which condemned most existing forces as too small to be efficient. A few chief constables supported its uncompromising demand for centralization, but most felt that St Johnston had stepped out of line and weakened their collective voice: he described the reactions of some as &#145;pretty violent&#146;  (St Johnston to T. A. Critchley, 23 Jan 1961, TNA: PRO, HO 272/105).<br>
<br>St Johnston's submission set out options of regional, national, and county control of forces: when he gave evidence he strongly favoured the last of the three, &#145;countyization&#146;, while apologizing for the word itself. He was drawn to the efficiency of nationalization but did not &#145;think the country wants it or that we are ready for it&#146;  (TNA: PRO, HO 272/38). The commission, which was keen to receive his evidence, recommended a scheme akin to countyization, justified in the terms presented to them by St Johnston. This was embodied in the 1964 <span class="roman">Police Act</span>, which brought about the amalgamation of forces. By the mid-1970s this had reduced the number of forces in England and Wales from over 120 to 43, in a structure that would endure for the rest of the century and beyond.<br>
<br>St Johnston's innovations in Lancashire became known to a wider public through his enthusiasm for motorized policing. His use of special unmarked crime patrol cars, equipped with two-way radios, inspired the television series <span class="italic">Z Cars</span>, set on Merseyside and made with the initial co-operation of the Lancashire constabulary. First broadcast in January 1962, <span class="italic">Z Cars</span> presented a less benign view of police work than the long-running <span class="italic">Dixon of Dock Green</span>, and early episodes aroused some disquiet about the less than perfect police characters they portrayed. St Johnston was also associated with the introduction in 1965 of an entirely motorized patrol system, using the so-called panda cars (painted light blue with a distinctive white band) so as to be instantly visible, to address policing problems in the new town of Kirkby, where juveniles represented a relatively large proportion of the population but a shortage of police manpower made it impossible to organize sufficient foot patrols to deal with outbreaks of vandalism and minor thefts. This mobile beat system was innovative, though not entirely original, given that similar developments had earlier occurred in Aberdeen and elsewhere. At Lancashire he also supported the development of an effective personal radio, which was issued to every policeman in his force from 1964. He regarded this as having &#145;revolutionised&#146; the work of the man on the beat  (St Johnston, 203). St Johnston was knighted in January 1967, when he left Lancashire.<br>
<br>The royal commission on the police had recommended that the vacant post of chief inspector of constabulary be filled. On the early death in September 1966 of his friend and Hendon contemporary Sir Edward (Ted) Dodd, who had held the position since 1963, St Johnston was appointed his successor, from February 1967, with the promise from his patron, the home secretary Roy Jenkins, that he would be considered for the post of metropolitan commissioner. In the event, when that position fell vacant in 1968, Jenkins's successor James Callaghan preferred another Hendon man, John Waldron, perhaps seeing St Johnston as a better innovator, reorganizer, and staff man than he was an operational commander.<br>
<br>As inspector of constabulary St Johnston was a strong supporter and public champion of &#145;unit beat policing&#146; in which many foot patrols were replaced by cars, with universal wireless communication. Reliance on control of police by radio through a limited number of wavelengths, combined with a highly mobile population, also drove his desire for forces to amalgamate their command structures for the sake of efficiency. He complained to the royal commission: &#145;It is possible for someone to steal a car and to go through six different police areas within the hour, with six separate wireless systems&#146;  (TNA: PRO, HO 272/38). In 1969 he institutionalized the practice of sabbaticals for high-flying police officers. He travelled widely as a policeman and maintained an international outlook, notably with contacts in the USA including O. W. Wilson, the exemplar of police professionalism in the mid-twentieth century. Despite some lobbying on his own behalf for a larger global role, he never supplanted Sir Arthur Young as the government's choice for official police fact-finding visits in the 1950s and 1960s.<br>
<br>St Johnston retired in 1970, having stamped his mark on the British police service since 1940. Unlike nearly all of his predecessors in leading positions within the police he was as much at home with trade union and Labour Party figures as he was with county society and Conservatives. Keen to make an impression upon any post he held, he was very quick to suggest detailed and thought-out courses of action to his superiors, and was noted for his &#145;forceful manner, his initiative, and his tireless energy&#146;  (Brigadier-General McSherry to Sir Frank Brook, 11 Dec 1944, St Johnston papers). His personal success was as much in opposition to his fellow officers as in conjunction with them: when comparing himself with Ted Dodd, he admitted that unlike himself Dodd was &#145;very popular in the Police Service&#146;  (St Johnston, 264).<br>
<br>In retirement St Johnston settled at Great Rissington, Gloucestershire, where he pursued business interests as a company director of Group 4 security, chairman of Interflow Ltd, and as a member of Lloyd's. His autobiography was published in 1978. Throughout his life he was active in public life and welfare work, for such causes as the King's Camp in the 1930s, and the Sail Training Association in the 1960s. He also rose in the freemasons and in the Order of St John, sitting on its chapter general. His personal life was less happy than his professional one: his first marriage (3 April 1937) to Joan (Joanna) Wharton (1914&#150;1974), daughter of Alwyn Wharton, physician and surgeon, ended in 1969 when she divorced him; they had one son and two daughters. On 12 December 1969 he married Margaret Emily (<i>b</i>. 1914), widow of Lieutenant-Colonel Stanley Jameson-Till MC, and daughter of Arthur Crust, landowner. A &#145;catastrophic error&#146;  (St Johnston, 290), this marriage ended in divorce in 1979. On 4 July 1980 he married Thelma Elizabeth Condy (<i>b</i>. 1932), daughter of George Barrington Thomas, company director, and former wife of Archibald Condy. St Johnston died in Cheltenham General Hospital on 17 March 1986.<br>
