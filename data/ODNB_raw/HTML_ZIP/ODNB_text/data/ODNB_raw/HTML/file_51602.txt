<span class="headword">Stacy <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Widdrington]</span>,  Enid</span>  (1868&#150;1903), <span class="occ">socialist and campaigner for women's rights</span>, was born on 10 June 1868 at 2 Fairlea Villas, West Park, Westbury, Gloucestershire, the eldest child of Henry Edward Stacy, an Irish artist, and his wife, Rosina Julia Deeley, the daughter of a midland hardware merchant. In 1881 the family moved to Bristol where Henry Stacy had a studio in Cotham. Enid was an able scholar and at sixteen took honours in her senior Cambridge examination. She studied at Bristol University, where she won the Whitworth scholarship. In the late 1880s she had a tutoring job at Redland High School for Girls in Bristol, and it was there that she became friends with Katharine Bruce Glasier (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Conway) who was later to become a leading figure in the Independent Labour Party (ILP).<br>
<br>The two women shared an interest in John Ruskin, Robert Browning, and high-church Anglicanism, but their lives were changed by the wave of strikes which occurred in Bristol in 1889. After an inspiring speech by the labour leader Tom Mann, Enid Stacy joined the Gasworkers' Union and threw herself into organizing work. She took part in the Bristol cotton workers' strike of November 1890, became honorary secretary of the Association for the Promotion of Trade Unionism among Women, and in 1892 led a long strike among Bristol confectionery workers. Katharine Bruce Glasier recalled that Enid Stacy often came home at midnight &#145;with draggled skirt and swollen feet after hours of patient standing about in the effort to win laundrywomen to a trade union&#146;  (<span class="italic">Labour Leader</span>, 12 Sept 1903). Enid Stacy's participation in strikes and her frequent clashes with the police meant that she lost her job as a schoolteacher in the early 1890s, and from then on she gave a full-time commitment to propaganda for socialism and women's rights.<br>
<br>Enid Stacy had been brought up in a Christian socialist household. Her younger brother Paul was joint founder of the Bristol and Clifton Christian Socialist Society and they had many friends in the Guild of St Matthew. During the labour unrest her circle of socialist friends widened. Her father's studio became a meeting-place for members of the Bristol Socialist Society and national leaders such as Edward Carpenter, William Morris, and Eleanor Marx. Katharine Bruce Glasier wrote in her pamphlet, <span class="italic">Enid Stacy</span>, that the studio:<blockquote>still lingers in my memory as some enchanted Hall of Dreams of an almost impossible beauty. There was music and song and dance &hellip; night after night bands of Socialists, young and old, would meet for study and debate, and terribly practical work too, for the unemployed and unskilled workers then enrolling in Will Thorne's Gas Workers' and General Labourers' Union.</blockquote>At first Enid Stacy concentrated on trade union organizing and committee work, but by the early 1890s she was already speaking several times a week for the Fabian Society and the Labour church on topics such as women and the labour movement. She attended the founding conference of the Independent Labour Party in 1893 and in the same year began to live in the controversial Starnthwaite home colony for the unemployed near Kendal. She was one of the leaders in a dispute between the colonists and a clergyman who had founded the group and had to face forcible eviction. It was at this point that Enid Stacy's reputation as an exceptional speaker began to grow. In 1894 she addressed 122 meetings in 33 townships in Lancashire, Cheshire, and Cumberland and from 1895 was employed by the ILP as a travelling lecturer. Sylvia Pankhurst described her as a &#145;big, handsome woman with a very clear complexion&#146; whose voice could carry to the back of any room  (Pankhurst, 127).<br>
<br>Enid Stacy was tireless as a propagandist. She supported ILP candidates at Bristol and Preston in the 1895 general election and made speaking tours with the <span class="italic">Clarion</span> van. She was never afraid to enter into the thick of a fight&#151;at one meeting of the unemployed in Liverpool, when the police tried to prevent speakers from addressing the crowd, she:<blockquote>clung manfully to the railings and endeavoured to assert the right to free speech, but the minions of the law tore her rudely away. But &#145;Our Enid&#146;, not to be daunted, mounted a tramcar standing by, and from the roof addressed the maddening throng, and dared the law in all its authority to come outside and put her out&#151;which they didn't. (Tuckett, 45)</blockquote>Enid Stacy's most enduring contribution to the revived socialist movement was to bring socialism and women's rights together. She was one of the few ILP leaders who spoke out in favour of women's suffrage. In the mid-1890s she became friends with Esther Roper, secretary of the Manchester National Society for Women's Suffrage, who shared her interest in the needs of working women. Enid Stacy spoke at the first annual meeting of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies in Manchester in 1898 and also joined Esther Roper at a suffrage deputation of women graduates to Westminster in 1903. She developed her ideas in articles for the socialist journal, the <span class="italic">Clarion</span>, where she was critical of the male prejudice of the labour movement. Her most systematic attempt to develop a theoretical framework to bring socialist and feminist ideas together was her essay, &#145;A Century of Women's Rights&#146;, published in the influential socialist anthology <span class="italic">Forecasts of the Coming Century</span> (1897), edited by Edward Carpenter. In this she argued that women's legal rights were just one phase of the suffrage movement and that equality as a citizen could only come about with socialism. She was forward-looking in calling for fairer divorce, equality within marriage, and women's right to choose whether or not to have children, as well as for the vote. She also sought freedom for women as workers, arguing that protective legislation should apply to both sexes.<br>
<br>Enid Stacy was a member of the national administrative council of the ILP for three years and in 1896 attended the International Congress of Socialists in London as one of two delegates from the Arbroath ILP. The other was the Revd Percy Widdrington (<i>b</i>. 1873/4), a devout Anglo-Catholic, whom Enid married on 29 May 1897. They lived in Newcastle until 1901 when they moved to the parish of Calderbrook in Lancashire. After the birth of a son Enid continued to spend six months of the year touring. She died suddenly of an embolism on 4 September 1903 at Littleborough, near Rochdale, and was buried at Calderbrook church; her husband survived her. Her friends believed that her early death was partly due to overwork and Sylvia Pankhurst claimed that she &#145;undermined her originally fine physique by unresting labours, constant open air speaking, constant journeying, poor food, uncomfortable quarters&#146;  (Pankhurst, 127&#150;8). Enid Stacy was one of the best-known female propagandists for socialism in the 1890s and did all she could to further the advent of women into politics.<br>
