<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Seton,  George</span>, fifth Lord Seton  (<em>c.</em>1530&#150;1586), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25120/', "George Seton, fourth Lord Seton (c.1508&#150;1549)")</script>, and his first wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. in or before 1539), daughter of John Hay, Lord Hay of Yester. In 1542 he went to the University of Paris in the company of William Maitland of Lethington, whose family lived nearby. He was first served heir to his father on 19 May 1550, and by contract dated 2 August that year he married Isabel (<i>c</i>.1529&#150;1604), daughter of Sir William Hamilton of Sanquhar, high treasurer and lord provost of Edinburgh. They had one daughter and five sons.<br>
<br>Although all other evidence strongly suggests that Seton remained a staunch Catholic, Adam Wallace's arrest for heresy while at Seton's house at Winton in Haddingtonshire in 1550 and Seton's own exposure to the teachings of John Willock after the latter returned to Scotland from Emden in the autumn of 1558 may be the basis for John Knox's claim that Seton was an apostate. His personal connections at this time, however, all suggest a close attachment to the monarchy and the established religion. His aunt Katherine was prioress of the Dominican nunnery of St Catherine of Siena, on the outskirts of Edinburgh; his sister Marion was a maid of honour in the entourage of the regent, Mary of Guise; his stepmother, Marie Pieris, was a lady-in-waiting to the regent; his half-sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70083/', "Mary Seton")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69949/', "Queen's Maries")</script>] accompanied Queen Mary to France in 1548. He was one of the eight commissioners chosen by parliament on 17 December 1557 to conclude the agreement with France, for the marriage of Queen Mary to the dauphin in April the following year.<br>
<br>In October 1557 Seton had been appointed lord provost of Edinburgh in succession to Archibald Douglas of Kilspindie. During his absence in France a number of presidents acted in his stead, including his friend Sir Richard Maitland of Lethington, father of William Maitland. Seton's reappointment as provost in October 1558 took place against a background of growing resentment among the burgh's merchants of the fiscal demands made by the regent. The next twelve months saw a series of conflicts between the town council and its provost, including the imprisonment of two bailies and the town clerk. These episodes seem to have been caused by a clash of personalities rather than religious differences, but by May 1559 they had come to a head with the prediction by the council of civil disorder and the counter-threat of Seton that he would impose order with his &#145;kin friends&#146;  (<span class="italic">Records of the Burgh of Edinburgh</span>, 3.38). But the hard-line provost was accused by the council of abandoning his post when the burgh's two friaries were sacked in mid-June 1559. In the unfolding crisis Seton found it difficult to serve two masters&#151;the capital and the queen regent. When faced with the prospect of the town being sacked by the army of the lords of the congregation, the council, one-third of whom had protestant sympathies, adopted a policy marked by ambiguity and conciliation. Seton acted as the regent's agent when sent with the earl of Huntly on 29 July to negotiate a truce with the protestant lords. The regent's proposals included the offer of a religious referendum in the town, a prospect which neither the protestant minority nor the council, anxious to defend its liberties, welcomed.<br>
<br>During the next two months, with Knox installed as protestant minister in the burgh church of St Giles but with the Catholic mass still being said elsewhere, and the forces of the congregation withdrawn, the council met frequently, but Seton attended only once. At the time of the next election, at Michaelmas 1559, the regent resorted to a leet imposing Seton and a loyalist set of office holders on the town. Three weeks later, shortly after they deposed Mary of Guise as regent, the protestant lords used this leet as a pretext for dismissing the Seton-led council and imposing one of their own, led by the protestant laird of Kilspindie. The Kilspindie council was in turn thrown out of office and the Seton regime restored when the congregation withdrew from the burgh on 6 November. But the strength of support for the regent was much depleted: one report of 10 November described only Seton, James Hepburn, earl of Bothwell, and Borthwick as unambiguously loyal. In the capital Seton found it difficult to restore normality after the damage caused by coup and counter-coup, although the mass was restored and St Giles's reconsecrated. The Seton council was again dismissed when an English army entered the town in April 1560; the regent retreated into Edinburgh Castle, and Seton joined the French troops defending the heavily fortified citadel of Leith.<br>
<br>Shortly after the death of Mary of Guise on 11 June 1560 but before the conclusion of the treaty of Edinburgh on 6 July and the evacuation of French forces some nine days later, Seton left for France. He arrived in Paris on 3 July. On 1 October, however, he obtained a passport to return to Scotland, via England. It is likely that he was engaged on an unofficial mission on Queen Mary's behalf and that the explanation he offered Nicholas Throckmorton, English ambassador in Paris, that he wanted, despite the fact that he had been &#145;evilly used&#146; in Scotland, to &#145;go home and live and die a good Scotchman&#146; was spurious  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1560&#150;61</i>, no. 666). In April 1561, at Joinville, the queen conferred pensions on three of his sons.<br>
<br>Seton accompanied the queen on her return to Scotland in August 1561. He was quickly appointed to the privy council. Early in October 1561, in the face of a series of provocations from the hard-line protestant town council of Edinburgh, Mary tried to impose a leet of loyalists to replace Kilspindie as provost. Seton, still highly unpopular in the town, was on it. Given his previous record as provost, Knox's charge that Seton was &#145;a man most unworthy of any regiment&#146;  (Knox, 1.242) had some substance. In the event, a compromise was reached and Seton never again reached burgh office or was proposed for it by the queen. His future role lay rather in the royal court.<br>
<br>Yet here, too, there were difficulties. Efforts were made to effect a reconciliation between Seton and his powerful East Lothian neighbour Bothwell: on 10 November 1561 in the presence of the queen they concluded a bond to end a long-running feud. This feud, the threats he had made to his fellow Edinburgh councillors in 1558&#150;9, and a heated quarrel between Seton and William Maitland of Lethington on the High Street of Edinburgh in October 1564, which led Mary to conclude that he should leave the country for a time, together suggest that Seton had an uncontrollable temper. They give some credence to Knox's jibe that he was &#145;a man without God, without honesty and oftentimes without reason&#146;  (Knox, 1.192).<br>
<br>None the less, Mary's first new year home was spent at Seton, and it is likely that it was then that the poem &#145;New year gift&#146; of Alexander Scott, an elegant but ambiguous appeal for religious and other reform, was first performed. The close links between the queen and her volatile Catholic courtier were confirmed in 1563, when Seton was made master of the royal household. The appointment underlined the division within the royal administration between the household, which was French in tone, largely Catholic, and drawn mostly from families of middling rank, such as the Setons, and the privy council, the active part of which was solidly protestant and mostly of higher status. Yet Mary's court remains an intriguing enigma, and Seton's role in it unexplained. Certainly, the portrait which Seton commissioned about 1577, showing him elaborately dressed and wielding his staff of office, with his family coat of arms, complete with its royal or double tressure, and knight's armour prominently displayed, reveals an ambitious courtier, risen to prominence through royal service. Also revealing of the ambitions of this middling family was the elaborate &#145;armorial&#146;, a pictorial history of both the Seton and royal dynasties, and the family house at Seton itself, which was among the earliest private dwellings in Scotland to claim the status of a palace.<br>
<br>In the crisis years of 1567&#150;73 Seton was one of the queen's most committed supporters. Mary's and Bothwell's army spent the night at Seton House before the confrontation at Carberry on 15 June 1567, and Seton fled north with the disgraced Bothwell before abandoning him. He was involved in the intrigue for Mary's escape from Lochleven on 2 May 1568, welcoming her at the lochside and taking her to his house at Niddrie. He was captured at Langside on 13 May. Imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle, he gained his liberty early in 1570 on the defection of the keeper, Sir William Kirkcaldy, to the Marian cause. In August the queen's party sent him from Aberdeen on a major embassy to win continental support (accompanied by the refugee earl of Westmorland and countess of Northumberland). For the next two years he pursued wide-ranging negotiations with Mary herself, the duke of Alba in the Netherlands, Philip II, Catherine dei' Medici, and the English Catholic party. One of the conditions which he tried to impose on Alba was that no council of blood would be set up in Scotland, as it had been in the Netherlands. He rebuked Catherine in 1571 for siding with England and abandoning the Franco-Scottish alliance that had stood &#145;sen Charles Mannis dais&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 3.592), but was himself eager for Spanish support and may well have been involved in the Ridolfi plot. He intrigued daringly with the Scottish troops in Dutch service in the hope of winning them over to Alba's side. He gained Spanish subsidies and endeavoured to persuade the queen's party that its best hopes lay with Spain.<br>
<br>Although nominally forfeited in August 1571, Seton retained effective possession of Niddrie. However, during 1572 the king's party gained the upper hand in the civil wars. Seton was a diehard &#145;queen's man&#146; who stayed aloof from the submission of most leading Marians on 23 February 1573 in the pacification of Perth, but he eventually submitted in April and even professed protestantism. Evidently, however, he intended to continue the struggle by other means. He kept in touch with Mary (who retained his sister Mary Seton in her service until 1583), and visited the continent from time to time on her behalf. In 1574 Seton's daughter Margaret married Lord Claud Hamilton, the leading supporter of the Catholic interest among the Hamilton family. Seton was in the minority who voted against the earl of Morton's restoration as regent in May 1578, and was discomfited by the Hamiltons' downfall in 1579.<br>
<br>Seton's fortunes revived with Morton's overthrow. In February 1581 the new regime proposed sending him as an ambassador to England in February 1581, an appointment the English angrily rejected in view of his record. He sat on the assize that condemned Morton on 1 June. He was close to the royal favourite Esm&eacute; Stewart, duke of Lennox (though not to his associate James Stewart, earl of Arran), and was briefly admiral of Scotland. He intrigued with the French ambassador against the Ruthven regime that overthrew Lennox in 1582. In January 1584, after the Ruthven lords' downfall, he was sent as Scottish ambassador to France, officially for the re-establishment there of the Scots guard; he hoped to have his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25125/', "Sir John Seton (c.1553&#150;1594)")</script> appointed to its command. He renewed his contacts with English Catholics on the way and assured Mary that he would use the mission to her best advantage, but his efforts achieved little. He was one of those captured at Stirling when the pro-English lords overthrew Arran on 2 November 1585.<br>
<br>Seton died on 8 January 1586, aged about fifty-five. He was survived by his wife, Isabel, who died on 13 November 1604, aged about seventy-five. She, like him, was buried in Seton church. Their eldest son, George, master of Seton, had died in March 1562; their second son, Robert (<i>c</i>.1552&#150;1603), succeeded as sixth Lord Seton, was a favourite of James VI, and became earl of Winton in 1600. Of the three younger sons, Sir John Seton became Lord Barns; Alexander was prior of Pluscardine and later earl of Dunfermline; and Sir William Seton of Kyllismore, sheriff of Edinburghshire and postmaster-general of Scotland. Like their father, each of the surviving sons profited through royal service.<br>
