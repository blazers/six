<span class="headword">Owen, Sir  Francis Philip  Cunliffe-</span>  (1828&#150;1894), <span class="occ">museum director and exhibition organizer</span>, born on 8 June 1828, was third son of Captain Charles Cunliffe-Owen RN and Mary (<i>d</i>. 1841), only daughter of Sir Henry Blosset, formerly chief justice of Bengal. He entered the navy at the age of twelve but, owing to ill health, abandoned the profession after five years' service in the Mediterranean and the West Indies. In 1854 he married Jenny (<i>d</i>. 1894), daughter of Baron Fritz von Reitzenstein, of the Royal Prussian horse guards. They had six daughters and two sons, one of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46861/', "Sir Hugo von Reitzenstein Cunliffe-Owen")</script>, became a successful tobacco entrepreneur. Also in 1854, the influence of an elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21004/', "Henry Charles Cunliffe-Owen")</script>, obtained him a post in the recently established Department of Science and Art. The department's secretary, Henry Cole, appointed him as one of the superintendents of the British section of the Universal Exhibition held at Paris in 1855, a task for which Owen's excellent knowledge of French proved to be a great advantage. The collaboration between the two men blossomed into an extremely successful partnership in the promotion of international exhibitions, and their combined efforts helped shape the course of these events during the latter half of the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Owen's successful administration in Paris in 1855 led to his appointment in 1857 as deputy general superintendent of the newly established South Kensington Museum, and he was promoted to the post of assistant director in 1860, subordinate to Cole, who served as director. In 1862 the second great London Exhibition was held, and Owen acted as director of the foreign sections. Soon afterwards, in 1864, he was elected a member of the Society of Arts, which was instrumental in promoting Cole's initiatives in the fields of education and exhibition. For the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1867, Owen was again made second in command to Cole, as assistant executive commissioner. His years of labouring under Cole were rewarded when he was appointed secretary of the royal commission appointed to represent Britain at the Vienna International Exhibition in 1873, answering directly to the prince of Wales. In the same year Cole retired from both the posts he held at South Kensington, and one of them, the directorship of the museum, was conferred upon Owen.<br>
<br>The next international event was the Centennial Exhibition held at Philadelphia in 1876. Owen was appointed executive commissioner for Great Britain and visited America for the purpose of making the preliminary arrangements. After he resigned, the post was filled by Herbert Sandford. In 1878 Owen was once again made secretary of the royal commission to the Universal Exhibition of that year in Paris. At the close of the exhibition he was made a KCMG and CIE, having been appointed CB after Vienna. Among his many foreign decorations was that of grand officer in the French L&eacute;gion d'honneur. In 1879 he was also appointed to the council of the Society of Arts.<br>
<br>Owen subsequently turned his great experience in organizing exhibitions to account in Britain. Taking up the somewhat unpromising scheme for a fisheries exhibition in 1883, he succeeded in transforming it into a great public success and a fashionable amusement. This was followed up by the International Health Exhibition in 1884, the Inventions and Music Exhibition in 1885, and, finally, the Indian and Colonial Exhibition of 1886. Owen controlled to a very great extent the administration of all these 1880s exhibitions, relying on the active support of the prince of Wales and the co-operation of the duke of Buckingham and Sir Frederick Bramwell. Although Owen was made a KCB after the Indian and Colonial Exhibition, he did not receive the direction of the Imperial Institute, which was founded in 1887 as a development of that event.<br>
<br>After some years of failing health owing to heart disease, Owen retired from his post at the South Kensington Museum in 1893. As a museum director, he was considered nothing more nor less than a capable administrator, who possessed little expert knowledge of his own and was sometimes criticized for not valuing it enough in others. He was clearly best suited to the work of organizing exhibitions and seems to have been happiest when engaged in that capacity. He died at 13 Kirkley-cliff, Lowestoft, Suffolk, on 23 March 1894.<br>
