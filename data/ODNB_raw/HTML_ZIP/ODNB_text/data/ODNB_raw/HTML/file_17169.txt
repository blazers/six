<span class="headword">Lukin,  Henry</span>  (1628&#150;1719), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born on 1 January 1628 in Great Baddow, Essex. He was the younger son of Henry Lukin and his second wife, Hannah. After studying at Mansfield School (under Halliwell) he went to Christ's College, Cambridge (8 July 1645), where he joined his elder brother William (admitted 1641). He was ordained and adopted puritanism, then became rector of Chipping Ongar, Essex, on 23 March 1659. Soon afterwards he resigned and perhaps was associated with Lindsell, a parish 3 miles from Great Dunmow, but without benefice or cure. At the Restoration he was in France, probably as tutor for about three years with Sir William Masham, second baronet, of High Laver, Essex. He was still abroad at the passing of the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> (1662) and, according to Calamy, was &#145;silenced &hellip; tho' not ejected&#146;. In 1663, after Masham died, Lukin returned to England and lived for many years with Mrs Masham (apparently Sir William's mother, Elizabeth) of Matching Hall, near which he preached regularly. Under Charles II's declaration of indulgence Lukin was licensed a Congregationalist on 11 April 1672. Calamy described him as a &#145;man of great note and eminence &hellip; a judicious and learned divine&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nonconformist's Memorial</span>, 1.529&#150;30).<br>
<br>Most of Lukin's written works were learned but practical devotional guides or instructional manuals for his friends and hearers. <span class="italic">The Practice of Godliness</span> (1658; 3rd edn, 1690), dedicated to Mrs Masham, gave brief rules directing Christians how to keep their hearts holy and how to order their behaviour. <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Holy Scripture</span> (1669) exhaustively catalogued the types of figurative language in the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, showed readers how to interpret and apply their meanings to salvation and obedience, and encouraged them to claim God's promises revealed in the text. <span class="italic">The Interest of the Spirit in Prayer</span> (1674) was a classically puritan work with its emphases on: the role of the Holy Spirit, practical moral application, &#145;experimental&#146; knowledge of the Christian graces, genuine piety instead of formalism, God's grace and providence, and man's impotence and total dependence on God. In <span class="italic">The Chief Interest of Man</span> (1665; 3rd edn, 1718), Lukin reflected on his cosmopolitan experiences, and used biblical citations, historical examples, and practical insights to argue the benefits of religion for building strong societies. Identifying Christianity as the religion best fitted to do this because it possessed the greatest truth he called for unity among Christians in moral living: &#145;let us pray like Calvinists, endeavour like Arminians, act like Legalists, hope like Antinomians; be Papists in our works, Protestants in our Faith&#146;  (pp. 188&#150;9). This was an uncommonly latitudinarian perspective for a Congregationalist of his day. In 1705 Simon Priest produced a Latin translation of this entitled <span class="italic">Lucrum hominis praecipuum, sive, De religione tractatus</span>. Lukin's <span class="italic">A Remedy Against Spiritual Troubles</span> (1694) was a practical theological discourse derived from sermons and transcribed for a friend to guide him from faith to assurance and holiness. Lukin's other major works were <span class="italic">The Life of Faith</span> and <span class="italic">A Discourse of Right Judgment</span>, both published in 1660.<br>
<br>Lukin was also a key source of information about the ejected dissenting ministers of Essex, which Edmund Calamy was gathering for inclusion in his <span class="italic">Abridgment of Mr. Baxter's &#145;History&#146;</span> (1702). Through the Masham family Lukin became a close friend of the philosopher John Locke, who lived with Sir Francis Masham, the third baronet, and his wife, Damaris, at Otes, Essex, from 1691 until his death in 1704, and supposedly was with him when he died. Lukin died on 13 September 1719 at Matching Green, Essex. Afterwards Lauchlan Ross of Abbots Roothing and George Wiggett of Hatfield Heath supplied the ministry at Matching Green every Sunday morning. Their successors continued this until 1743, when George Ross became the minister there. Shortly after this Ross left the neighbourhood, the congregation dispersed, and the chapel was closed.<br>
