<span class="headword">Wilson,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1601&#150;1653), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Catterlen, near Penrith in Cumberland, of yeoman parents. He was sent to school at Blencow and matriculated in 1618 as a sizar from Christ's College, Cambridge, where his tutor was Joseph Mede, the famed biblical scholar. Wilson graduated BA in 1622 and proceeded MA in 1625. After gaining his BA he worked, at Mede's suggestion, as a schoolmaster in the house of John Bristow, the minister of Charlwood, Surrey, for about four years. He then entered the ministry, but his puritanism made it difficult for him to find a congenial living. He briefly served first at Capel, Surrey, and then at Farlington, Hampshire, which he found to be &#145;an ignorant, Heathenish place&#146;. His third living was at Teddington, Middlesex, where he had &#145;great success &hellip; and much acceptance amongst them that feared the Lord&#146;. On a return visit to his native county Wilson used the opportunity to preach in Penrith about his strict sabbatarian views  (Swinnock, 6&#150;7). Wilson's first wife, about whom no details are known, died within months of their marriage of a &#145;consumption&#146;, and on 9 November 1630 at St Stephen, Coleman Street, London, he married Damaris Cable, the daughter of James Cable, merchant, of London. The couple had eleven children, of whom nine survived their father.<br>
<br>In 1631 Wilson was headhunted by a puritan group led by Alderman Robert Swinnocke of Maidstone, who presented him to the parish of Otham, Kent. Here Wilson was in competition with the perpetual curate of Maidstone, Robert Barrell, who was involved in long-running disputes with the town council about fees and tithes. The Maidstone puritans also complained about the &#145;deadness and dulness&#146; of Barrell's ministry and preferred instead to attend Wilson's services, despite censure in the church courts. In 1635 Wilson refused to read the <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span> and was suspended until 1639. During this period he was repeatedly called before the court of high commission at Lambeth and in September 1640 was cited by the diocesan courts for not reading the prayer against the Scots. Sir Edward Dering, knight of the shire for Kent, raised Wilson's case in November 1640 in his first speech to the Long Parliament. In February 1642 Sir Edward Partridge, MP for Sandwich, successfully moved in the house that Wilson should be appointed town lecturer in Maidstone. At the end of that year he was chosen as one of the Kent representatives to the Westminster assembly of divines appointed to advise parliament on reform of the church.<br>
<br>Wilson published a catechism for children, <span class="italic">A Childes Trade</span> (1645), and two of his sermons to the House of Commons. The first, <span class="italic">David's Zeale to Zion</span>, preached on 4 April 1641, was dedicated to Dering and called generally for further Church reforms. The second, <span class="italic">Jerichoes Down-Fall</span>, was preached on 28 September 1642 and was more outspoken. Wilson made plain his support for &#145;root and branch&#146; reform and argued that there was no <i>jus divinum</i> for prelacy. He attacked Archbishop William Laud by name and urged the members of the Commons to reform both church and state. In June 1644 Wilson also testified at the archbishop's treason trial about his suspension. Despite being a member of the Westminster assembly, Wilson did not neglect his duties in Maidstone and he also preached regularly at the assizes, although none of his local sermons was printed. Wilson regarded preachers as &#145;the strength of a land, the charets [<i>sic</i>] of Israel and horsemen thereof&#146;. As a preacher he was described as &#145;one that did divide the word aright &hellip; a Boanerges, a Son of Thunder&#146;. In 1644 he was appointed perpetual curate at Maidstone, where he enforced sabbath observance and set an exemplary and godly example. Prior to this Maidstone was characterized as &#145;a very prophane town&#146;, but under Wilson's aegis one of the assize judges observed that &#145;in all his circuit he never came to a town where the Lords Day was so strictly observed&#146;  (Swinnock, 40&#150;41).<br>
<br>Wilson died in 1653 after contracting a &#145;violent feaver&#146; and was buried on 23 March at Maidstone. He appointed his widow, Damaris, his executor, and left &pound;100 to each of his four sons and five daughters.<br>
