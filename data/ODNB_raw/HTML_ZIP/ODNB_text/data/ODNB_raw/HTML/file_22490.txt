<span class="headword">Pond,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1767, <em>d.</em> 1836), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, the second child of John Pond and Arabella Raven, was baptized twice at the church of St Katharine Coleman in the City of London, first &#145;privately&#146; on 18 November and then &#145;publickly&#146; one week later; his elder sister, Arabella, was baptized at the same church on 19 December 1766. His father was very successful in trade and retired to Dulwich. Pond had a very varied education. According to a contemporary obituary he was sent away to school at Hadleigh, near Barnet, at the age of seven, and a few years later went to the free grammar school at Maidstone. By the age of fourteen he was at home and received private tuition from William Wales, the mathematics master at Christ's Hospital, who had been one of the astronomers on Cook's second voyage; Pond is said to have drawn the attention of Wales to discrepancies in Greenwich observations which could be attributed to imperfections in the instruments, but Wales did not transmit this criticism to the astronomer royal Nevil Maskelyne, who was a close friend. Pond was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, as a pensioner, on 1 April 1784 and matriculated later in the same year. He intended to study mathematics but was distracted by a great enthusiasm for chemistry. Ill health forced him to interrupt his studies, and he spent a few years in Spain and the south of France. Details of his career at Cambridge are few, but there is no record of him taking a degree. He was admitted at the Inner Temple on 3 November 1794 but cannot have stayed long for, in a letter to William Herschel written from Lisbon in August 1795, he stated that he had been there already for eight months, having been forced to leave England because of his health. In the same letter he remarked that he was sufficiently recovered to resume his &#145;astronomical amusements&#146; and asked Herschel to dispatch the 7 foot reflecting telescope which he had ordered during the previous year. His main interest at that time seems to have been in double stars, and it is said that he observed also in Italy, Malta, Egypt, and Constantinople.<h2>
<a name="TheWestburyobservatory"></a>The Westbury observatory</h2>By 1799 Pond had returned to England, where he settled in Wells, Somerset, and set up an observatory at Westbury-sub-Mendip. He had acquired from his friend Edward Troughton an altazimuth instrument with a vertical circle of 2 foot 6 inches diameter, with which he observed the declinations of bright stars during 1800&#150;01, in order to investigate further the accuracy of the Greenwich quadrants. A feature of Pond's technique was the frequent reversal of his instrument through 180&deg; in azimuth. The brass quadrant, by Bird, had been in use at Greenwich since 1750 and Pond suspected that it had become distorted. By the end of the century the art of graduating complete circles had been perfected by Ramsden and by Troughton himself, and so-called circular instruments were being brought into use at a number of observatories. In June 1806 Pond read a paper to the Royal Society in which he described his methods and compared his observations, combined with those from other circles at Armagh and Palermo, with the results from Greenwich. This clearly demonstrated that all the circles confirmed that there was a serious error in the Greenwich measurements of the declinations of stars south of the equator. This important paper was communicated to the Royal Society by the chemist Smithson Tennant, who, although six years older than Pond, had evidently been a close friend for a number of years, since he had earlier managed financial transactions with Herschel on his behalf while he was abroad; they would have been near contemporaries at Cambridge. Within six months of the publication of Pond's paper a committee of the board of visitors of the Royal Observatory recommended that an instrument closely following Troughton's design be provided there. Pond was invited to attend a subsequent meeting of the committee which accepted a revised proposal by Troughton that, instead of an altazimuth, a larger, mural circle should be purchased. Pond was invited to join the board, but apparently never attended a meeting before becoming astronomer royal himself.<br>
<br>On 26 February 1807 Pond was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and on 16 April in the same year he married Ann Gordon Bradley (1789&#150;1871) at the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields. He had impressed Humphry Davy during a visit by the latter to Westbury in 1800, and from the end of 1808 he became closely involved with the Royal Institution. During each of the following two years he gave courses of lectures on physical and popular astronomy. He was elected a member in 1810, and for the next five years was a member of its scientific committee on mathematics, mechanics, and mechanical inventions. In 1809 he published a translation, in two volumes, of the <span class="italic">Syst&egrave;me du monde</span> by Laplace.<h2>
<a name="Astronomerroyal"></a>Astronomer royal</h2>On Maskelyne's death, Pond was appointed astronomer royal by the prince regent, and took up his office at Greenwich on 13 April 1811. The new mural circle by Troughton was delivered in 1812, and for the next few years Pond made an extensive series of observations on bright stars in order to establish a standard catalogue of declinations to complement Maskelyne's catalogue of right ascensions of thirty-six standard stars. In 1816 a new transit instrument, also by Troughton, replaced the one which had been in use for over sixty years. Pond's great contribution to positional astronomy was in the improvement of declination measurements. In 1822 he devised a very elegant method of determining the horizontal reference by combination of observations made directly and by reflection in a mercury horizon; this enabled the true zenith distance to be derived without recourse to the use of a plumb line or spirit level. A second circle, similar in all respects to the Troughton circle, was being constructed by Thomas Jones for the new Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope. In 1823 Pond persuaded the Admiralty that this circle should be set up permanently at Greenwich, and from 1825 he used both circles in parallel, observing directly with one and by reflection with the other. The accuracy achieved by this technique was demonstrated more than sixty years later by S. C. Chandler, who detected variation of latitude in Pond's observations; further evidence is given by the investigation by Richardson, one of Pond's assistants, who derived a value of the constant of aberration of starlight which is very close to the true value. The culmination of Pond's career was the publication in 1833 of a catalogue of the positions of 1113 stars.<br>
<br>Between 1817 and 1825 Pond was engaged in a celebrated controversy with the Revd John Brinkley, Andrews professor of astronomy at Dublin, over the measurement of stellar parallaxes. In 1808 Brinkley instigated a programme with the new 8 foot Ramsden circle at Dunsink which was aimed at detecting parallaxes of certain bright stars. By 1810 he announced that he had measured parallaxes of a second of arc or more for four stars, and sought confirmation of his results from Pond. Brinkley's mathematical techniques were far superior to those of Pond, but Pond was able to demonstrate that, while his observations showed some apparent variations with season, they were not as large as those found by Brinkley. As a further check, Pond installed two special telescopes which were fixed in the declinations of the stars Alpha Aquilae and Alpha Cygni, and compared the observations of these stars, each with a comparison star at the same declination, but he could not confirm Brinkley's results for these two stars.<br>
<br>Pond's prowess as a practical astronomer received recognition at home and abroad. He was highly regarded by Bessel, and by his own successor, G. B. Airy. In 1817 he was awarded the Lalande prize from the French Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences, of which he was a corresponding member, and in 1823 the Copley medal of the Royal Society. He published his researches in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> and the <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society</span>, and in the volumes of <span class="roman">Greenwich Observations</span>. It cannot be said, however, that his general management of the affairs of the observatory was entirely successful. The quality of the <span class="italic">Nautical Almanac</span> deteriorated in his earlier years, and further criticism came from Stephen Lee, assistant secretary of the Royal Society, who, in a letter to its president in 1825, charged Pond with incompetence and drew attention to many numerical inconsistencies in some of the printed <span class="roman">Greenwich Observations</span>. Many of these were trivial, and Pond was exonerated by a committee of the society, but he conceded his own &#145;little want of vigilance as an editor&#146;. He resisted an offer from the Admiralty for the appointment of a superior class of assistants, indicating that what he wanted were &#145;indefatigable hard-working and obedient drudges &hellip;&#146;. This was in line with his dedication to his prime duty of routine observation.<br>
<br>During his last years Pond was afflicted by ill health, which caused his absence from the observatory for long periods. Discipline among his staff became lax, and he resigned on 30 September 1835. During his twenty-four years at Greenwich the structure of the Royal Observatory was fundamentally changed; the number of assistants was increased from one to six, and, in spite of administrative shortcomings, the tradition of excellence became firmly established. Pond died at his home at Blackheath on 7 September 1836 and was buried at Lee, Kent, in the same tomb as his predecessor, Edmond Halley.<br>
