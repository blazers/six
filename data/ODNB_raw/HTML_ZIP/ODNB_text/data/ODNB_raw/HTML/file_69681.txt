<span class="headword">Bewick,  Thomas, apprentices</span>  (<em>act. </em>1777&#150;1828), <span class="occ">wood-engravers</span>, were twenty-nine young men trained in the Beilby&#150;Bewick workshop between 1777, when <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2334/', "Thomas Bewick (1753&#150;1828)")</script> joined <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1966/', "Ralph Beilby (bap. 1743, d. 1817)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73669/', "Beilby family")</script>], and the time of Bewick's death in 1828. Eight of them were indentured during the twenty years of the partnership up to 1797, and twenty-one thereafter. Most of the information on the apprentices is to be found randomly in the workshop records, with some important supplementary material in Bewick's <span class="italic">Memoir</span> and his surviving correspondence. Their wages, loans, deductions, and occasional treats are recorded in varying detail, and their initials appear with tantalizing sparseness and irregularity beside the entries for specific engravings on which they had worked. The terms of engagement were founded on the universally accepted seven years from the fourteenth birthday, though often adjusted by circumstance: some would come on trial before their fourteenth year, others whose promise was late in being recognized might be taken on as late as eighteen; two came from other masters to complete their time. Negotiations with parents or guardians were not always straightforward, because if a premium was required, it could be hard to find, and subscriptions had to be raised. The terms could vary a great deal. Those set for John Anderson in 1792 required his father to pay a 60 guinea fee and provide his board and lodging for the first three years, after which his son would be paid 5<i>s</i>. a week for the remaining four years. Those who stayed on in the workshop after their apprenticeship was over would be likely to be paid on piece-work and could earn a guinea to &pound;1 18<i>s</i>. a week.<br>
<br>Lawyers prepared the indentures, and the official &#145;binding&#146; of the apprentice to master was often recorded as an occasion for celebration at an inn, with drink and music on the small-pipes. The apprentices came from varied walks of life: the occupations of their parents and guardians ran the gamut from a &#145;poor cottager&#146;, and a keelman, to a city lawyer, and an officer in a militia regiment. Their training would have been rigorous, covering all the skills of a general metal-engraving workshop, following the pattern of Bewick's own training under Beilby so vividly described in his <span class="italic">Memoir</span> (pp. 39&#150;41). No account has yet come to light that gives a precise idea of the daily training routines of the apprentices; but we do know from the survival of many wood blocks&#151;most of them bought by Julia Boyd and printed in her <span class="italic">Bewick Gleanings</span> (1886)&#151;that copying Bewick's own finished engravings was a regular exercise for his pupils.<br>
<br>Fourteen of them eventually specialized in wood-engraving and of these eleven came to prominence in the trade, all but two in London. Two others became distinguished engravers, of silver and of copper, and settled in their specialities on their own in the north. Eight of the group, Bewick's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2332/', "John Bewick")</script>, his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2333/', "Robert Elliot Bewick")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65041/', "Bewick family")</script>], <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19897/', "Charlton Nesbit")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5609/', "Luke Clennell")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12532/', "William Harvey")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14534/', "John Jackson (1801&#150;1848)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14915/', "Robert Johnson")</script>, and his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14895/', "John Johnson")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14915/', "Johnson, Robert")</script>], are noticed elsewhere; eight others in chronological order&#151;John Laws, John Anderson, Henry Hole, Mark Lambert, Edward Willis, Isaac Nicholson, Henry White, and William Temple&#151;are treated separately in what follows.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_69681"></a><span class="headword">John Laws</span>  (1765&#150;1844), <span class="occ">silver-engraver</span>, was born at Heddon Laws near Heddon on the Wall, Northumberland, the son of a farming family. He was apprenticed to Beilby and Bewick between March 1782 and March 1789, beginning at about seventeen and leaving finally in June 1790 to work from his home at Heddon. In Bewick's <span class="italic">Memoir</span> (p. 195) he is noticed as being brought up as a silver-engraver, specializing in ornamental and &#145;bright&#146; engraving (faceted work which reflects light, executed with a lozenge graver), at which he was unrivalled in his time. He was greatly respected and did much for the Newcastle silversmiths, and various other craftsmen such as saddlers, gunsmiths, and clock- and watchmakers. A keen amateur naturalist and taxidermist, he took a year's break in America as a relief from the workbench and to improve his birds' nest and egg collection  (Angus, 9). An important pattern book survives with his descendants, along with a ledger recording his work which shows that while his farm had latterly become his major preoccupation, he was working on silver within weeks of his death on 14 August 1844, aged seventy-nine.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_482"></a><span class="headword">John Anderson</span>  (1775&#150;1808?), <span class="occ">wood-engraver</span>, was born at Foveran, Aberdeenshire, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/475/', "James Anderson (1739&#150;1808)")</script>, farmer, and his wife, Margaret Seton (<i>d</i>. 1788). James Anderson had written a number of papers on agricultural and other topics, and took a degree of LLD at Aberdeen before moving to Edinburgh where in 1790 he began publishing a periodical, <span class="italic">The Bee</span>. Its need for illustration led him to apply to Bewick, and from this connection his son John was taken on as an apprentice on 10 September 1792. Three years later he proved an unruly pupil and the partners were preparing to sue him for neglecting his work, insolence, provocation, wilfully bad work, and for totally absenting himself from their service  (Weekley, 144). In May 1795, after settling part of an arbitrator's fee, Anderson's name disappears from the books, and he may have moved south with his father in 1797. That he had talent there is no doubt, and he was taken up in particular by the printer Thomas Bensley and the booksellers Vernor and Hood. His first acknowledged work, sixteen large vignettes after George Samuel, appears in Maurice's <span class="italic">Grove-Hill</span> printed by Bensley in 1799, followed by the first edition of Bloomfield's <span class="italic">The Farmer's Boy</span> in 1800, a work often falsely credited to Bewick. Although no signature has been observed on his work, his handling of tree foliage is very distinctive in its repetitive groupings and horizontal bias; he made full use of &#145;white line&#146; and rich contrast. In 1799 his hand can be seen in an edition of <span class="italic">The Letters of Junius</span>, in title cuts for Zimmerman's <span class="italic">Solitude</span>, and in a few vignettes and figures in his father's periodical <span class="italic">Recreations in Agriculture, Natural History, Arts &amp;c</span>, first published in London in that year. His career was short-lived. Henry Hole wrote tantalizingly to Bewick (5 July 1805) &#145;Mr John Anderson is certainly gone to Botany Bay, but more of this hereafter&#146;. The obituary of his father, who died in 1808, notes that John had &#145;lately&#146; predeceased him  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, Dec 1808). A &#145;speculation&#146; has been referred to  (Redgrave, <span class="italic">Artists</span>), and it could be that he was involved in some enterprise which either led to or forced his departure overseas. He should not be confused with his contemporary in America, Alexander Anderson, who copied Bewick's <span class="italic">Quadrupeds</span> and several of the works of John Bewick.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_13500"></a><span class="headword">Henry Fulke Plantagenet Woolocombe Hole</span>  (1782&#150;1852), <span class="occ">wood-engraver</span>, was the son of a captain in the Lancashire militia who, for marrying a butcher's daughter, had been dispossessed of the family's Devon estate, Ebberley Hall, near Torrington. He was apprenticed to Bewick between October 1794 and 3 October 1801, when he was responsible for a few of the engravings in the second volume of the <span class="italic">British Birds</span>. He appears to have come to the workshop aged about twelve, having lost his father. Bewick was obviously fond of him, and when he left for Liverpool, he took with him a letter of introduction to Thomas Vernon (4 Dec 1801), in which Bewick hoped Vernon might be able to provide advice and introductions, saying that his &#145;late pupil &hellip; knows little of mankind &hellip; has read a good deal, is of a poetic and romantic turn of mind, is unsettled, and does not know where to cast Anchor&#146;. Hole found his feet and eventually had enough work to seek the workshop's assistance with a long series of cuts for a <span class="roman">Bible</span>: his commissioning letter of 14 September 1804 was wildly optimistic in expecting to get fifteen finished within a week, despite saying &#145;something showy will be the most appropriate, for <i>fineness</i> or <i>labour</i> of execution is out of the question&#146;. Other work that came from Liverpool connections were cuts for <span class="italic">The Nurse</span> translated by William Roscoe from the Italian (3rd edn, 1804), and for the printer John McCreery's poem <span class="italic">The Press</span>, part 1 (1803). His large engraving <span class="italic">Seed Sown</span>, for Ackermann's <span class="italic">Religious Emblems</span> (1809), shows him to have been a skilful interpreter of the work of John Thurston. As a member of the Liverpool Academy he exhibited in 1814 his engraving <span class="italic">An Attempt to Restore the Old Method of Crosslining on Wood</span>  (Redgrave, <span class="italic">Artists</span>). Through the intervention of Roscoe, Hole went to see his uncle in Devon, who to his astonishment, after a tour of the house and grounds and a good dinner, immediately made over the estate to him  (Meyer). Twenty years after the completion of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> cuts, Bewick had still not had final payment  (letter, 11 Oct 1826). Although claiming that the debt was the responsibility of Troughton, the publisher, Hole was no doubt encouraged to settle by Bewick's passing reference to adding a full account of his apprentices in his <span class="italic">Memoir</span>. He died at Roborough, Bickington, Devon, on 19 August 1852.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_69680"></a><span class="headword">Mark Lambert</span>  (1781&#150;1855), <span class="occ">copper-engraver</span>, was born at Fourstones, Hexham, Northumberland. Nothing is known of his background, and Bewick fails to mention him in his <span class="italic">Memoir</span>, but he and his son Mark William were to establish the most successful copper-engraving and printing business in Newcastle, to which the diffident Robert Bewick would have lost much trade in his later years. Lambert was probably apprenticed to Bewick in July 1797, although the records of him are curiously shorter on detail than in other cases: there is a cryptic entry &#145;Letter from Mark&#146; of 8 April 1797, and he first appears on the wages for 19 June 1802 with &#145;Mark out of his time&#146; on 14 July 1804, and a final payment on 1 September of that year  (Beilby&#150;Bewick workshop record). When independent, Lambert was primarily a writing engraver of great accomplishment, providing bill heads, trade cards, and bookplates on copper for local custom, along with ciphers and armorial work on silver; pictorial work was taken on by other hands such as the artist J. W. Carmichael, William Collard, and George F. Robinson, who worked with the firm for many years from 1841. Nearly all Lambert's work is signed and some of his own early bookplate vignettes have frequently been attributed to Bewick. He died on 28 September 1855.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_69684"></a><span class="headword">Edward Willis</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1784, <em>d.</em> 1842), <span class="occ">wood-engraver</span>, was the son of James Willis and his wife, Margaret Carr, of Swalwell, co. Durham, and was baptized at Whickham on 14 March 1784. He was a cousin of George Stephenson the railway engineer. Willis was apprenticed in August 1798 and ended his time on 17 August 1805, with Bewick recording in the work book &#145;never a cross word passed between us the whole seven years&#146;. Willis remained in Newcastle and continued to engrave for the workshop, contributing some tailpieces to <span class="italic">The Poetical Works of Robert Burns</span> (Alnwick, 1808), until his departure for a four-year stay in London in 1809. He returned to Newcastle in 1813, after the death of his wife, to continue working for Bewick over the next four years, contributing briefly to the <span class="italic">Fables of Aesop</span> before finally returning to London in May 1817, where he died on 10 February 1842. Willis was Jackson's and Chatto's principal source for their list of attributions in the <span class="italic">Treatise on Wood-Engraving</span> (1839). His work was not distinguished and tended to move away from the &#145;white line&#146; of his master; Bewick remarked that while with him he was &#145;on a par with Charlton Nesbit, but did not equal the mechanical excellence Nesbit had attained to in London&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoir</span>, 199). His signature &#145;Willis&#146; appears occasionally in a running hand. He was a slow and deliberate workman, and was described by F. W. Fairholt as &#145;a Chinese engraver, without an idea of doing aught but mechanically cut out lines drawn out on wood for him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 1866, 179&#150;80). His exact work on Thomas Hood's pen-and-ink sketches for <span class="italic">Whims and Oddities</span> bears this out.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_20137"></a><span class="headword">Isaac Nicholson</span>  (1789&#150;1848), <span class="occ">wood-engraver</span>, was born at Melmerby, Cumberland, baptized at Melmerby on 8 March 1789, and bound on 18 August 1804, completing his time on 6 July 1811. He was the only wood-engraver apprentice to remain in Newcastle all his life, continuing in the workshop for some time before setting up on his own. He worked on the reproductive cuts for Thornton's <span class="italic">Herbal</span> (1810) and on some of the blocks for <span class="italic">Recreations in Natural History</span> (1815) which had been prepared by Luke Clennell: these display all the vigour and freedom of Clennell's draughtsmanship but the cutting moves towards black line reproduction, which is often seen in Nicholson's small vignettes, where backgrounds of rock predominate, and in his groups of bunched foliage. A few of the cuts in the <span class="italic">Fables of Aesop</span> (1818) were from his hand and merit Bewick's record in the <span class="italic">Memoir</span>: &#145;both a good Apprentice &amp; a good Artist&#151;his engravings on Wood, are clearly or honestly cut, as well as being accurately done from his patterns&#146;. He also did much work for Emerson Charnley, the Newcastle bookseller, in particular the vignettes for his <span class="italic">Select Fables</span> of 1820, and for the titles of a long series of annual <span class="italic">Fisher's Garlands</span>, too often attributed to Bewick, although many were engraved after Bewick's death. One was a blatant copy of one of the finest tailpieces in the <span class="italic">Birds</span>, the angler in the river, and roused Bewick to turn to the law for redress  (letter to Charnley, 22 May 1826). To compare the two provides a valuable means of observing Bewick's mastery. Nicholson died on 18 October 1848.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_69683"></a><span class="headword">Henry White</span>  (1784&#150;1851), <span class="occ">wood-engraver</span>, was the son of Jonathan White, hatter and sword cutler in London, who died not long after his bankruptcy. He came to the workshop on 15 September 1804 after serving the first four years of his time with James Lee in London. Lee's death prompted White's uncle and guardian, H. S. Speck, to seek another master for him, much to the natural irritation of Lee's widow to whom, after four years' experience, he had become very useful. He was of course immediately useful to Bewick. He was involved in some of the cuts for Thomson's <span class="italic">The Seasons</span> (1805), for which Thurston had provided the drawings, and he engraved all the principal subjects and some tailpieces for Catnach and Davison's edition of <span class="italic">The Poetical Works of Robert Burns</span> (Alnwick, 1808). He had a somewhat dry manner which compares poorly with the vigorous effects of Clennell, who also worked on <span class="italic">The Seasons</span>. He left the workshop for London a few months after his time, in January 1808. Bewick remarked that in London &#145;he chiefly turned his attention, to the imitation of sketchy <i>cross hatching</i> on Wood, from the inimitable pencil of Mr Cruickshanks, &amp; perhaps some other artists in this same way&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoir</span>, 199&#150;200). The work for which White is now specially remembered is to be found in Major's edition of Walton's <span class="italic">Complete Angler</span> (1824), and in Yarrell's <span class="italic">History of British Fishes</span> (1836): all of it mechanically excellent, but reproductive and reflecting nothing of what he might have absorbed from the example of Bewick.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_69682"></a><span class="headword">William Temple</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1798, <em>d.</em> 1837), <span class="occ">wood-engraver</span>, was baptized at All Saints, Newcastle upon Tyne, on 6 May 1798, the son of William Temple and his wife, Mary Gill. He was bound on 15 August 1812 and took to wood-engraving as readily as his fellow apprentice William Harvey. They were singled out by Bewick as being his principal assistants, along with his son Robert, in getting out the <span class="italic">Fables of Aesop</span>, for which Bewick prepared the drawings in great detail on the wood. Robert appears to have contributed the least to the enterprise; after Harvey left for London in September 1817 there were still some twenty or so blocks to be cut and these were probably the work of Temple. The tailpieces of a man negotiating a snowdrift on stilts, and the funeral cort&egrave;ge at Ovingham which ends the book, are Temple's work and both show a particularly delicate handling of the fine tracery of the branches in the winter trees. At the end of his time his father's death took him away to support the running of the family drapery business and wood-engraving lost a promising talent.<br>
<br>Of the remaining lesser figures, David Martin (<i>fl</i>. 1758&#150;1781) and Abraham Hunter (1759&#150;1808) were the earliest to join. Although Martin had been a fellow apprentice towards the end of Bewick's time, and contributed to the <span class="italic">Select Fables</span> of 1784, he apparently had little aptitude for his work and moved to other things  (letter, 11 May 1819). Hunter, who appears to have left the workshop by July 1780 after about three years, set up a rival business in Newcastle and there are indications that the later relationship with his masters was not an easy one  (Bewick, letter, 30 Sept 1788). Others to follow Hunter were Johnson, another cousin of Robert Johnson and as a wood-engraver and draftsman a minor contributor to the <span class="italic">History of British Birds</span> and the <span class="italic">Poems of Goldsmith and Parnell</span>; Henry Barnes, indentured and in the workshop between 1791 and 1794; Charles Hickson, apprenticed in 1795, a ward of Sir John Lawson and an idle braggart who absconded in 1800; John Harrison (1785&#150;1818), a nephew of Bewick, who after leaving the workshop in 1814 specialized as a writing engraver; George Armstrong, apprenticed for two years, 1804&#150;6, before setting up as a partner in Armstrong and Walker, engravers in Newcastle who were later to train John Jackson; John Bewick (1790&#150;1809), another Bewick nephew who died after four years as an apprentice wood-engraver; John Armstrong, apprenticed in 1813 and staying after his time until leaving for the London wood-engraving trade in 1825; Matthew Bewick (1801&#150;1832), the third nephew in the workshop, who was apprenticed in 1817 and continued as a copperplate printer; Alexander Reid, son of a Leith bookseller, apprenticed in 1817&#150;24, an irritation to his master with nothing known of his subsequent career; Thomas Young, apprenticed in 1818&#150;25 and William Hardy, apprenticed in 1827&#150;34, who remain obscure; and finally James Reevely, who joined the workshop in 1824, and as a competent wood-engraver became Robert Bewick's right-hand man. It should be noted that Ebeneezer Landells, who was later a prominent figure in the London trade, both as engraver and as first editor of <span class="italic">Punch</span>, had been intended for Bewick's workshop and is often incorrectly referred to as his pupil. Although payments for indenture papers and a sketchbook were recorded in 1822, it appears that, as Bewick and Landell's father could not agree terms, the boy went to Isaac Nicholson, who had by then established his own business in Newcastle.<br>
