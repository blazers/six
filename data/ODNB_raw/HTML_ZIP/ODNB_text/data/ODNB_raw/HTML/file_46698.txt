<span class="headword">Roberts,  Ernest Stewart</span>  (1847&#150;1912), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born on 11 April 1847 at Swineshead, Lincolnshire, the eldest of the eight children of Stewart Blacker Roberts, a country doctor, and his first wife, the daughter of a Dr Milson of Swineshead. He was educated at Boston grammar school to the age of seventeen, then privately until he won a scholarship at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1865; in Caius he lived for the rest of his life, as scholar (1865&#150;70), junior fellow (1870&#150;80), senior fellow (1880&#150;1903), college lecturer in classics (1870&#150;1903), tutor (1876&#150;1903), president (1894&#150;1903), and master (1903&#150;12).<br>
<br>Roberts was an able classical philologist, and author of the substantial <span class="italic">Introduction to Greek Epigraphy</span> (2 vols., 1887&#150;1905), the second volume written in collaboration with E. A. Gardner. As master he also edited <span class="italic">The Works of John Caius</span> (1912). But his life's work was as tutor and master, remodelling the college and guiding its students. He lived through a period of rapid change in the university, which from being little more than a provincial seminary was to become a notable centre of &#145;education, religion, learning and research&#146;, and in this change Roberts played a leading role. He was devoted to the college and in many ways naturally conservative&#151;and this made it easier for him to carry more cautious colleagues with him in pursuit of his ideals. He believed, as many in other colleges were coming to believe&#151;inspired especially by the example of Trinity&#151;that the fellows should form a cadre of teachers, and he presided over the appointment of effective college lecturers not only in classics (his own field) and mathematics (the traditional core of the Cambridge curriculum), but law, modern languages, history, and natural sciences. No aspect of college life escaped his notice. He took orders (1877), regarding this as still proper for a tutor, and fostered the chapel and the college mission. He was devoted to the boat club and invited every freshman to join it. He believed, as many did in that age, that military training was the best way to secure peace, and himself became eventually Lieutenant-Colonel Roberts, officer commanding the university corps. Outside the college he showed sympathy with the education and higher education of women. He became a central figure in Cambridge as well as in the college (he was vice-chancellor 1906&#150;8), yet he was a quiet, unostentatious man, quite without eloquence; he was good-looking, with a pleasant bearded face. He lacked the intellectual eminence of Henry Sidgwick, philosopher and founder of Newnham, but his dedicated vision of what a college should be helped him to carry the senior fellows who governed the college over many shoals.<br>
<br>On 3 August 1886 Roberts married Mary Harper, daughter of Hugo Daniel Harper, principal of Jesus College, Oxford. His devotion to the college was such that he insisted on a tutor's house being formed in its innermost court, which he and his wife and three children exchanged for the master's lodge in 1903. He died there after a heart attack on 16 June 1912, survived by his wife.<br>
