<span class="headword">Lynam,  William Francis</span>  (1832/3&#150;1894), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in Galway, co. Galway, Ireland. Very little is known about his early life, except that he had a brother, James, but by 1863 he was living at Churchtown House, Dundrum, co. Dublin. He was commissioned in the 5th Royal Lancashire militia in 1867 and retired in 1881 with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In 1887 he moved to Clontarf, co. Dublin. He was editor of <span class="italic">The Shamrock</span>, a weekly paper originally owned by Richard Pigott and later by William O'Brien. He also contributed to the <span class="italic">Irish Emerald</span> and the <span class="italic">Weekly Freeman</span>. He was best known, however, as the author of the &#145;Mick McQuaid&#146; stories, which appeared in <span class="italic">The Shamrock</span>. They comprised conversations between the optimistic McQuaid and the pessimistic Perry Garrity. The stories lightheartedly criticized the methods and manners of the growing class of rural dealers, land agents, and lawyers, and their control and use of local institutions. The first story, &#145;Mick McQuaid's Conversion&#146;, began to appear on 19 January 1867. Other stories included &#145;Mick McQuaid, Under Agent&#146; (1869&#150;70), &#145;Mick McQuaid, MP&#146; (1872&#150;3), &#145;Mick McQuaid's Spa&#146; (1876&#150;8), and &#145;Mick McQuaid Alderman&#146; (1879&#150;80). Many Mick McQuaid stories were reproduced as penny numbers and the first three series were issued as a quarto volume of nearly 600 pages, <span class="italic">The Adventures of Mick McQuaid</span>, in 1875. <span class="italic">Darby the Dodger</span>, a stage comedy in which a rural trader is given his come-uppance by his long-suffering neighbours, followed in 1877. William O'Brien, in particular, attempted to do away with McQuaid but this damaged sales and he was restored to the paper. Other Lynam characters in <span class="italic">Shamrock</span> serials included Dan O'Donovan, Corney Cluskey, and Sir Timothy Mulligan but none achieved anywhere near the popularity of Mick. Lynam's writings were so well known that Carrolls used the name of Mick McQuaid for one of its brands of pipe tobacco. Mick had himself smoked Carrolls' tobacco during his philosophical debates with Garrity. For one of Carrolls' designs in the 1920s, it is said that the artist drew on the facial features of David Lloyd George, H. H. Asquith, and Horatio Bottomley for a caricature of Mick.<br>
<br>William Francis Lynam died of liver failure on 17 August 1894 at his home, 2 Warrenpoint, Clontarf, co. Dublin, aged sixty-one. He was a Roman Catholic and is said to have been &#145;a man of much piety&#146; and to have &#145;lived a very retired life&#146;  (Brown, 178). He never married. Unusually for the ephemeral world of serial fiction, Mick McQuaid stories were frequently republished and, indeed, were still being reprinted twenty-five years after their author's death.<br>
