<span class="headword">Mather,  Ebenezer Joseph</span>  (1849&#150;1927), <span class="occ">founder of the Royal National Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen</span>, was born on 12 June 1849 at Foregate Street, Stafford, the son of Henry Penkett Mather (<i>c</i>.1805&#150;1886), a shoe manufacturer, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Douthwaite. Although raised a member of the Plymouth Brethren, Mather later joined the Church of England (about 1883) and remained an Anglican for the rest of his life. Following his education at Mr Charles Hammer's private academy, Rhyll, in 1861, Mather worked as a junior clerk in a Worcester bank and later as a market gardener. He became an auditor about 1869 and was licensed as a broker of the City of London. On 4 September 1872 he married his first wife, Caroline Eliza (1849&#150;1925), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lough, at Islington register office; they had eight children, two boys and six girls. In 1880 he was appointed as secretary to the Thames Church Mission (TCM), which had been founded in 1844 following the demise of the Episcopal Floating Church Society, to continue the Church of England's work among seafarers on the Thames.<br>
<br>In 1881 Samuel Hewett, owner of the Short Blue [fishing] Fleet, invited Mather to visit his employees in the North Sea. Following this visit, and in the light of growing public concern with conditions in the fleets, Mather gave a paper on Christian work at sea to the Newcastle church congress in October 1881. He also urged the TCM committee to employ a &#145;sailing Bethel&#146; for evangelistic work among the fishing fleets, and the <i>Ensign</i> was launched on 14 June 1882, the new venture becoming known as the Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen (MDSF). The TCM committee, however, found the development increasingly burdensome, and in 1884 sought to separate the two aspects of its work. This led, in 1886, to the MDSF being reconstituted as an independent organization under the direct control of Mather and a new council (which included Sir Frederick Treves, R. M. Ballantyne, Dr A. T. Schofield, and G. A. Hutchison). The MDSF quickly moved off in new directions involving the establishment of &#145;sailing hospitals&#146; and a highly publicized campaign against the North Sea liquor trade engaged in by vessels known as copers (&#145;coopers&#146;). These developments, however, led to severe financial worries, and in 1887 Mather published his history of the MDSF, <span class="italic">Nor'Ard of the Dogger</span>, in an attempt to increase public support. With the growing financial burdens, Mather found himself the butt of increasing criticism. He became the subject of inquiry by his council regarding financial irregularities, and was forced to resign in August 1889. When the magazine <span class="italic">Truth</span> picked up the story, Mather, encouraged by R. M. Ballantyne, sailed in January 1890 for Australia, where he spent two years researching details for a popular travel book which he published as <span class="italic">The Squatter's Bairn</span>.<br>
<br>Details about the remaining thirty-seven years of Mather's life are very sparse. He spent some time as an editor with the <span class="italic">Church Family Newspaper</span>, and in 1918 was awarded a civil-list pension of &pound;50 p.a. &#145;in consideration of his valuable work in connection with the Fishermen's Mission and of his inadequate means of support&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fish Trades Gazette</span>, 6 July 1918). In retirement he lived on Canvey Island, Essex, where he published (anonymously) his biography, <span class="italic">Memories of Christian Service</span>. Following the death of his wife he married his nurse, May Ethel Timewell (1873&#150;1957?), on 16 June 1925, but was to survive only two further years before dying, at their home in Cotswold Gardens, Canvey Island, of heart failure on 23 December 1927. He was buried in the grounds of the nearby church of St Nicholas.<br>
