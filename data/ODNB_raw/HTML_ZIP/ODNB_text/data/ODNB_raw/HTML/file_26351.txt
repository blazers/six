<span class="headword">Steell,  Gourlay</span>  (1819&#150;1894), <span class="occ">animal painter</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 22 March 1819, the son of John Steell (<i>fl</i>. 1800&#150;1829), a well-known woodcarver, and his wife, Margaret Gourlay. Like his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26352/', "John Steell (1804&#150;1891)")</script> the sculptor, he began his art studies under the guidance of his father, and continued them in the school of the board of manufacturers under William Allan, and in the studio of Robert Scott Lauder. At the early age of thirteen he exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy a model of a greyhound (1832) and in 1835 a life-sized study, <span class="italic">Portrait of a Cape of Good Hope Bloodhound</span>. From that time forward works by him were seldom if ever absent from the annual exhibitions of that body, of which he was elected an associate in 1846 and an academician in 1859. In his earlier years he was much employed as a draughtsman on wood for book illustration, and he devoted himself a good deal to modelling, of which he was for some years teacher in the Watt Institute, Adam Square, Edinburgh, in succession to his father. He also modelled many groups of horses, dogs, and cattle, which were afterwards cast in silver by Edinburgh silversmiths.<br>
<br>Steell was a good shot and a keen angler, and throughout his life was fond of outdoor amusements. On 8 April 1840 he married Jemima Gowan, but following her early death he married, on 30 September 1852, Jessie Anderson. With his second wife he had two daughters and two sons, the eldest of whom, David George (1856&#150;1930), also became a painter of animal and sporting subjects. In 1857 Steell exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy <span class="italic">Llewellyn and Gelert</span>, a picture which attracted much attention, as did also a <span class="italic">Highland Raid, or, How the MacGregors Lived and Died a Hundred Years Ago</span> (exh. Royal Scottish Academy 1858), representing the Macgregors defending the cattle which they had raided against an attack of the royal troops. The latter was purchased for their prize distribution by the Royal Association for the Promotion of the Fine Arts. Perhaps his best-known work is <span class="italic">A Cottage Bedside at Osborne</span> (1865; exh. Royal Scottish Academy, 1880), depicting Queen Victoria reading the <span class="roman">Bible</span> to a sick fisherman, which became very popular through the engraving by William Henry Simmons. Following the death of Sir Edwin Landseer in 1873, Steell was appointed animal painter to Queen Victoria for Scotland. He painted the royal dogs and horses, as well as <span class="italic">The Pass of Leny: Cattle Going to Falkirk Tryst</span> (1876; Royal Collection) and a replica of <span class="italic">Llewellyn and Gelert</span> (1880; Royal Collection). He held a similar office with the Highland and Agricultural Society and had a virtual monopoly of animal and sporting commissions in Scotland.<br>
<br>Steell's reputation further increased with <span class="italic">A Challenge</span> (exh. RA, 1877) and <span class="italic">The Trysting Place, or, Garhonzie Bridge, Callander</span> (exh. Royal Scottish Academy, 1882; Glasgow Museum and Art Galleries). <span class="italic">Dandie Dinmont and his Terriers</span> (exh. Royal Scottish Academy, 1867?), engraved by James Stephenson, was one of many pictures suggested by incidents in Scott's <span class="roman">Waverley</span> novels. As well as many portraits of favourite pets and prize animals, Steell painted two large hunt pictures: one of the earl of Wemyss (1863) and another, <span class="italic">Equestrian Portrait of Colonel Carrick Buchanan, Accompanied by his Huntsman and Fox-Hounds</span> (exh. RA, 1871; exh. Royal Scottish Academy, 1872), which were both engraved. He also painted several equestrian portraits, including <span class="italic">The Earl of Eglinton and Winton</span> (exh. Royal Scottish Academy, 1877) and <span class="italic">Andrew Gillon of Wallhouse Esq., Late Master of the Linlithgow and Stirlingshire Foxhounds</span> (exh. Royal Scottish Academy, 1878), and one of his best designed works was <span class="italic">Lord President Inglis and a Shooting Party at Glencorse, or, A Shooting Party</span> (1868; exh. Royal Scottish Academy, 1869).<br>
<br>Many of Steell's later works were large studies of animals executed in oil, tempera, and charcoal, chiefly for the decoration of highland mansions, of which he was an admirable draughtsman, and highland cattle were a favourite for his uncommissioned works. He succeeded William Fettes Douglas as curator of the National Gallery of Scotland in 1882. Steell died at his home, 23A Minto Street, Edinburgh, on 31 January 1894, and was interred in the cemetery at Morningside, Edinburgh. His wife had predeceased him. His last picture, entitled <span class="italic">Lochaber No More</span> (exh. Royal Scottish Academy, 1894), which he left nearly finished, was rendered doubly pathetic by the artist's death.<br>
