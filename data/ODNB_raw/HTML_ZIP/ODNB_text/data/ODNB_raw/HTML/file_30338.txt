<span class="headword">Adamson, Sir  John Ernest</span>  (1867&#150;1950), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born at Westgate Common, Wakefield, Yorkshire, on 11 January 1867, the son of Tom Adamson, engine fitter, and his wife, Eliza Stokoe. He attended St Michael's elementary school, Wakefield, and went on to St Mark's College, Chelsea (1889&#150;91), where he trained as a teacher. He was subsequently appointed to the staff of the St Mark's College Training School. In 1891 he became a tutor and lecturer in the theory and method of teaching at South Wales Training College, Carmarthen, while studying for a BA at London University, which he obtained in 1894. He subsequently gained an MA in philosophy (1901). On 23 April 1897 he married Gwendolyn Mary (<i>b</i>. 1872/3), daughter of John Howell Thomas, of Starling Park, Carmarthen.<br>
<br>In 1902 Adamson moved to South Africa where he was to play a major role in the shaping of educational policy in the reconstruction era. On the recommendation of Sir Michael Sadler he was appointed principal of the new Normal College in Pretoria which was to provide teachers for the new Transvaal Colony, and in 1905 he became director of education for Transvaal, a post which he occupied with distinction until 1924. He first worked under Viscount Milner's military regime with Patrick Duncan as minister of education. He very effectively brokered an agreement which brought the Christian national schools of the post-war era into the ambit of state education.<br>
<br>When the Transvaal achieved responsible government in 1907, Adamson worked closely with the new minister of education, J. C. Smuts, to lay the foundations of a new education system which found expression in the <span class="roman">Transvaal Education Act</span> of 1907. The new system was designed to promote reconciliation and to balance the rights and demands of the Dutch and English sections of the population in the highly volatile political context of the time. The fact that he learned Dutch and Afrikaans and showed great sympathy with the cause of his former enemies was of great assistance in these delicate negotiations.<br>
<br>Adamson's role in the development of educational policy in Transvaal can be seen in the context of the growth of a new form of educational administration that sought to link schooling with a systematic approach to social reconstruction. His outstanding achievements were the introduction in 1916 of compulsory schooling for all white children between the ages of seven and fifteen and the successful accommodation of both sections of the white population to the new state educational system with his sympathetic treatment of language and religious issues. His annual reports as director of education from 1906, and the reports of the council of education (an advisory body on educational policy chaired by Adamson from 1913) provide invaluable sources for the study of education in Transvaal from the end of the South African War to the early years of union. After 1910 he served under three successive administrators of Transvaal: Johan Rissik (1910&#150;15), A. G. Robertson (1915&#150;24), and J. H. Hofmeyr (1924&#150;9), retiring from his post after the defeat of the South African Party in 1924.<br>
<br>As director for nineteen years Adamson was active in all fields of educational policy development&#151;provision, governance, legislation, finances, curriculum development (especially post-1916), medium of instruction and language issues, inspection and supervision, teacher training, teaching methods, teachers' conditions of service, non-sectarian religious teaching, and high-school selection. He paid a great deal of attention to the issue of equal educational provision for all white inhabitants of the province, with special attention to the demand for adequate schooling in the countryside and the provision of appropriate vocational education. With hindsight he can perhaps be criticized for showing too little concern for the education of the indigenous people where he advocated a policy of &#145;proceeding cautiously&#146;, despite the lively debate that surrounded this issue at the time. Yet he was to note in 1920 that &#145;neither from the missionary side nor from the side of the Government is responsibility towards native education recognised and accepted as it should be&#146;.<br>
<br>Adamson's major academic work was <span class="italic">The Individual and the Environment: some Aspects of the Theory of Education as Adjustment</span> (1921) for which he received a DLitt from London University in 1920. It represents a rather dense summary of contemporary British educational philosophy focused around the notion of education as an &#145;adjustment&#146; to &#145;the world of nature&#146;, &#145;the world of civilization&#146;, and &#145;the world of morality&#146;. Perhaps the most striking aspect of the work to the modern reader is its extremely abstract and general nature and the absence of any significant reference to his South African experience in nearly 400 pages of text, perhaps reflecting the gulf between the formal study of philosophy of education at that time and the everyday world of policy development and educational practice in colonial South Africa. Other writings include <span class="italic">The Theory of Education in Plato's &#145;Republic&#146;</span> (1903), <span class="italic">The Teacher's Logic</span> (1904), <span class="italic">Externals and Essentials</span> (a collection of essays, 1933), &#145;Education for a brave new world&#146; (1941 unpublished), a book of poetry, <span class="italic">Songs of the South</span> (1915), and numerous articles and presentations on educational topics.<br>
<br>Adamson was appointed CMG in 1923 for his exceptional service, and was knighted in 1924. He was a member of the councils of the University of the Cape of Good Hope (1906&#150;17) and the University of South Africa (1918&#150;24), and was vice-chancellor of the latter from 1922 to 1926. Following his retirement as director of education for Transvaal, he was principal and professor of education at Rhodes University College (1924&#150;30).<br>
<br>In 1935, while Sir Percy Nunn was on leave of absence, Adamson undertook most of his teaching duties at the London Institute of Education for six months. During the latter part of his career he also chaired a South African union government committee of inquiry into subsidies to universities, university colleges, and technical colleges (its report was published in 1933) and another into the position of languages in the South African education system (it reported in 1941). Much of our knowledge of his life comes from the biography by G. P. van Rooyen in the form of a PhD dissertation (University of Potchefstroom, 1951) which emphasizes his role as a pioneer educational planner and a friend of the Afrikaner. Adamson, who was a talented musician and an ardent golfer until his eightieth year, died on 25 April 1950 at Muizenberg, near Cape Town, South Africa. His wife predeceased him; they had no children.<br>
