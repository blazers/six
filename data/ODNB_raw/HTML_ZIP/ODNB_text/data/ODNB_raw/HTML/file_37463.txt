<span class="headword">Goddard,  Guybon</span>  (1612&#150;1671), <span class="occ">lawyer and parliamentary diarist</span>, was the only son of Thomas Goddard of Stanhoe and his wife, Mary, daughter of William Guybon of Watlington; both families were of long standing in Norfolk. He matriculated at Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1629, entered Lincoln's Inn on 5 February 1631 (by which time his father had died), and was called to the bar in 1639. In 1642 Goddard married Mary, daughter of John Greene, serjeant-at-law, a match that brought him useful connections, notably with Edward Bysshe, who was appointed Garter king of arms by parliament in 1646.<br>
<br>In pursuit of a professional legal career Goddard was prominent in the affairs of King's Lynn over three decades&#151;freeman in 1645, deputy recorder from 1645 to 1651, and then recorder (succeeding Miles Corbet) until the Restoration. In 1656 he secured from the protector a new charter for the borough. During the 1650s he sat on various commissions, including the commission for the assessment in Norfolk and the commission for oyer and terminer in London. A bencher of Lincoln's Inn in 1657, he became a judge in the sheriff's court of London in 1659. Ten years later he was appointed a serjeant-at-law.<br>
<br>Something of an antiquary, Goddard collected a great deal of (chiefly) Norfolk documents upon which later historians were to draw, notably Francis Blomefield (1705&#150;1752) for his classic <span class="italic">History</span> (1739) of the county. In common with many contemporary lawyers he also combined this taste with a concern for current politics. He was elected to the first protectorate parliament in 1654 for King's Lynn, and again to the second in 1656, this time on a double return which was rejected. Returned for Castle Rising &#145;without any seeking or soliciting&#146; on his part to Richard Cromwell's parliament in 1659, again on a double return, he was allowed to sit but was inactive until the election was overturned a few days before the dissolution in April. He did not sit in any subsequent parliament. For both the 1654 and the 1659 Commons he kept a sort of diary. That for 1654 was printed in 1828 by J. T. Rutt as an introduction to his edition of the diary of Thomas Burton MP. Rutt also drew upon the 1659 record to annotate, supplement, and modify Burton's. Into his transcript of the 1654 diary he slipped brief extracts from the Commons journals while silently omitting&#151;largely on grounds of illegibility&#151;&#145;a great variety of phrases, borrowed from the ancients&#146;  (p. cxcii), interspersed in the speeches.<br>
<br>For 1654 Goddard produced not a plain &#145;on-the-spot&#146; piece of reporting, but rather more of a compilation, in which he summarized proceedings and debates, naming very few participants, but indicating the general drift of attitudes and conclusions, occasionally at length but often very briefly. Compared with the diaries of Burton or of Sir John Gell for 1659, his diary is somewhat slight, but as the only internal account and commentary on the debates it has unique value. Goddard gives the impression of a house working seriously and in accordance with traditional procedures towards the performance of its roles, especially the legislative one. Though in the event this was an addled parliament, it was by no means fain&eacute;ant: a good many bills, public and private&#151;quite apart from the major one intended to revise in a parliamentary way the &#145;Instrument of government&#146;&#151;were introduced and pursued, as Goddard, who was a conscientious attender, suggests, mostly without acrimony, though references to &#145;the court party&#146; and &#145;the soldiery and courtiers&#146; indicate underlying partisanships. Unfortunately and inexplicably, he breaks off in mid-sentence (about finance) on 18 December, leaving the reader uninformed on the major discussions leading to the abrupt dissolution on 22 January 1655.<br>
<br>The diary is rather colourless, no doubt like its author, but there are some shrewd comments and occasional lively touches. On the first day some members cry &#145;sit still&#146; when summoned to the painted chamber to hear the protector. In November they are making &#145;themselves a little merry with puns&#146;. Tearing into the instrument, some behave &#145;as if they had been in the schools, where each man had liberty to propose his own <span class="italic">Utopia</span>, and to frame commonwealths according to his own fancy&#146;. Goddard himself seems to have leaned towards &#145;the more moderate sort&#146; in these matters, as is shown by his reaction to the protector's requirement of a written recognition by MPs on 12 September that government by a single person and a parliament was an unalterable fundamental. He and fellow Norfolk members dined together and decided (most of them) to comply with &#145;the breach of privilege&#146; rather than to risk putting &#145;the nation into another combustion and confusion&#146;. Guybon Goddard, oddly for a scribacious lawyer, died intestate in 1671.<br>
