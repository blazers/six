<span class="headword">Morrison,  Walter</span>  (1836&#150;1921), <span class="occ">businessman, politician, and benefactor</span>, was born in London on 21 May 1836, the fifth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19326/', "James Morrison (1789&#150;1857)")</script>, of the firm of Morrison, Dillon, &amp; Co., and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1887), daughter of John Todd, of the same firm. Walter Morrison inherited a share, which grew considerably during his own lifetime, of his father's vast fortune made in wholesale textiles, drapery, and haberdashery during the Napoleonic wars and later expanded through merchant banking and judicious investment in North America. He was educated at Eton College and at Balliol College, Oxford, where, like two of his brothers, he became a redoubtable oar, and gained a first-class degree. The mental and physical vigour shown in his youth was maintained throughout a long life.<br>
<br>Morrison left Oxford in 1858, made a &#145;grand tour&#146;, which included Egypt, Palestine, and the United States, and entered the House of Commons in 1861 as Liberal member for Plymouth. He held that seat until the Liberal d&eacute;b&acirc;cle of 1874, stood unsuccessfully for the City of London in 1880, parted from Gladstone over his Irish programme, and twice subsequently (1886&#150;92 and 1895&#150;1900) represented, as a Liberal Unionist, the Skipton division of Yorkshire, in which his home was situated. He finally retired from candidature in 1900 after a broken career in parliament extending over nearly forty years. It was a career, however, which was neither conspicuous nor, in all probability, congenial.<br>
<br>A man of strong convictions and great independence, but neither an orator nor an ambitious politician, Morrison was never at any period an enthusiastic party man. In his early Liberal days his interests were largely centred on the co-operative movement for improving working-class dwellings. In the years following his break with Gladstone all his energies and resources were thrown into opposing home rule for Ireland.<br>
<br>Morrison's intermittent absorption in politics did not keep him from a careful stewardship both of his private fortune and of the various business interests from which it arose. In particular he joined in 1874 the board of the Central Argentine Railway, in which his family possessed a large stake, became its chairman in 1887, and soon afterwards paid a protracted visit to South America which resulted in an elaborate report and the eventual absorption of the Buenos Aires and Rosario line. To the end of his life his portfolio included an unusually large holding in this company. The British Aluminium Company, in which his brother Charles was the largest investor, also stood out from the pack, as did a politically inspired investment in the Sligo, Leitrim, and Northern Counties Railway. These exceptional holdings had a nominal value of &pound;149,000, &pound;112,287, and &pound;93,489 respectively. He was also director of a number of local concerns and chairman of the Craven Bank, travelling constantly between London and Yorkshire in discharge of these duties. His wealth grew partly by inheritance from a childless brother and sister who died before him, and partly through the simplicity of his personal tastes. At his death, his stocks and shares amounted to a nominal &pound;3.5 million in several hundred companies located mainly in Britain (54 per cent) and Latin America (16 per cent).<br>
<br>Despite all his miscellaneous interests, a remarkably large part of Morrison's time was spent at Malham Tarn, the wild moorland estate in Craven which had been acquired for him when he came of age, from the Listers of Gisburn. Here he indulged his love of walking, of folklore, and of local leadership. Always something of an aloof and self-centred figure, he played host at Malham to a number of eminent Victorians, including Henry Fawcett, John Ruskin, Charles Darwin, John Stuart Mill, Sir William Harcourt, and especially Charles Kingsley. As his guests, they witnessed numerous innocent eccentricities. These included a refusal to imbibe the wines of imperial France (he instead placed republican chianti on his dining table); the substitution of blue crockery for yellow following his break with Gladstone; and a smoking room papered with 6 inch Ordnance Survey sheets of the surrounding countryside to prevent the servants from tidying them away. It was at Malham Cove, below the house, that Kingsley had the idea of <span class="italic">The Water Babies</span>, and Walter Morrison was his &#145;Squire&#146;.<br>
<br>At Malham, away from the glare of publicity, Morrison planned his benefactions. He played a considerable part in the development of the northern universities&#151;a single anonymous gift of &pound;10,000 to the new school of agriculture at Leeds was revealed almost by accident after his death. For Giggleswick School, where he was chairman of the governors for many years, he built and furnished down to the smallest detail, in celebration of Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee, that remarkable &#145;chapel with a dome&#146; which was the expression both of his lifelong interest in oriental architecture and of his personal predilections in English history. The pews, of wood from the Argentine province of Tucuman, bore witness to a major source of his wealth. The windows of the clerestory display his judgement of English history and politics, placing Arnold, Livingstone, and Gordon alongside such older figures as Wykeham, Columba, and King Alfred. He supported Lord Roberts's campaign for national service; for some years he made an annual contribution of &pound;10,000 to King Edward's Hospital Fund, and contributed to innumerable relief funds during both the South African and the European wars. He was a founder of the Palestine Exploration Fund, a society dedicated, in the words of the archbishop of York, to the rescue of Palestinian history &#145;from darkness and oblivion&#146;, and regarded himself in that connection as the &#145;discoverer&#146; of Kitchener. His gift of &pound;15,000 funded the Hittite excavations at Carchemish undertaken by the British Museum, and underpinned the short-lived Society of Biblical Archaeology.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life Oxford University became the special object of Morrison's benefactions. Fired perhaps by his experience at Giggleswick, he offered to rebuild the new chapel at Balliol College on the lines of the old, which he greatly preferred; on the rejection of this somewhat startling proposal, he gave &pound;30,000 to the university to support a readership in Egyptology, a professorial pension fund, and the study of agriculture. Finally, in 1920, he endowed the Bodleian Library with a single payment of &pound;50,000, which placed him among its chief benefactors. The honorary degree of DCL, which was conferred upon him in the following year, was the only public recognition which he received, or indeed would have valued. He died at Sidmouth, Devon, on 18 December 1921, and was buried at Kirkby Malham. Morrison left an estate with a gross value of &pound;2 million, the greater part of which passed to his nephew, James Archibald Morrison.<br>
