<span class="headword">Allfrey,  Phyllis Byam  Shand</span>  (1908&#150;1986), <span class="occ">author and politician</span>, was born in Roseau, Dominica, British West Indies, on 24 October 1908, the second daughter of Francis Byam Shand (<i>b</i>. 1879), a lawyer who had come to Dominica from England in the early 1900s, and Elfreda Millicent Crompton Nicholls, whose family had settled in the islands in the mid-seventeenth century. Phyllis Byam Shand was named after her ancestor William Byam, who first settled in Barbados, but eventually moved to Antigua, where he became governor. He was doubtless the Byam whom Aphra Behn describes with vehement negativity in <span class="italic">Oroonoko</span> (1688). Phyllis Shand's parents were married in St George's Church in Roseau on 27 March 1905, and had three other daughters: Marion (<i>b</i>. 1906), Celia (<i>b</i>. 1910), and Rosalind (<i>b</i>. 1912). Phyllis Shand and her sisters grew up in Roseau, where they were educated somewhat haphazardly at home, with various tutors educating them in poetry, arithmetic, religious studies, and French. Phyllis also practised drawing and music, and started writing plays at an early age. Her first short story was published in <span class="italic">Tiger Tim's Weekly</span> when she was thirteen.<br>
<br>Having followed her sister Celia to England when Celia married Jack Richmond Allfrey, Phyllis Shand met and married Jack's brother, Robert Edward Allfrey (1906&#150;1986), on 22 May 1930. Shortly after the wedding they went to the United States, where Robert Allfrey had been offered a job as a hydraulic engineer. Their two children were born in Buffalo, New York: Josephine, nicknamed Phina, in February 1931, and Philip in April 1935. The family returned to England in June 1936. In London, Phyllis Allfrey took a job as secretary to the author Naomi Mitchison, a job that brought her into contact with prominent Fabian socialists of the time. She then served as London county council welfare officer to assist those whose homes had been bombed, and she offered her own home as a haven for Dominicans migrating to England. During this period she began to write professionally, winning an international award for her poem &#145;While the Young Sleep&#146;. In 1940 she published <span class="italic">In Circles</span>, a collection of thirteen poems she had written from 1936 to 1939. Three of the poems reflect West Indian themes. In 1942 she published &#145;Uncle Rufus&#146;, a short story about her childhood in Dominica, in the London <span class="italic">Tribune</span>.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1940s Phyllis Allfrey wrote numerous short stories, some of which were published in an assortment of magazines including <span class="italic">The Windmill</span>, <span class="italic">Pan Africa</span>, and the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. By 1950 she had collected another set of poems, which she published under the title <span class="italic">Palm and Oak</span>. The two trees named in the title represented her own ancestry&#151;West Indian and European&#151;which she described as &#145;tropic&#146; and &#145;nordic&#146;. Increasing literary success encouraged her to more sustained writing. The Allfreys' two children were in school, and during this peaceful period Phyllis Allfrey wrote <span class="italic">The Orchid House</span>. The novel was published quickly, with a British edition from Constable in 1953, to be followed by an American edition from Dutton in the same year. In 1954 Librairie Stock published a French edition, <span class="italic">La maison des orchid&eacute;es</span>. Writing the novel &#145;drove me towards my home island&#146;  (P. Allfrey to E. Campbell, n.d.), and the Allfreys returned to Dominica in 1954.<br>
<br>In Dominica, Phyllis Allfrey was caught up in the island's social and economic politics. She co-founded the Dominica Labour Party to help the island's underpaid tropical fruit workers, and for the next two decades her political activity overshadowed her creative writing. Her most significant political success occurred in 1958, when she won an all-island election for the cabinet of the newly created federal government of the West Indies. As minister of labour and social affairs, she moved with Robert and her adopted African-Caribbean daughter, Sonia, and Carib son, David, to federation headquarters in Trinidad. There they lived until 1961, when the West Indies Federation collapsed. Upon their return to Dominica, they ran the <span class="italic">Dominica Herald</span>, and then, in 1965, they founded a weekly newspaper, <span class="italic">The Star</span>.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Orchid House</span> was republished in London in 1982 by Virago Press, followed by an American edition in 1985 by Three Continents Press. During her newspaper years, Phyllis Allfrey continued to write poetry and short stories in addition to political essays and editorials for <span class="italic">The Star</span>. Poor health and poverty caused the Allfreys to give up <span class="italic">The Star</span> in February 1982, allowing time for Phyllis to work on her novel <span class="italic">In the Cabinet</span>. Phyllis Shand Allfrey died of malnutrition and colon cancer in the Princess Margaret Hospital, Roseau, Dominica, on 2 April 1986, <span class="italic">In the Cabinet</span> remaining unfinished. Although she died in great poverty, she was accorded a federal minister's funeral in Roseau, where she was buried in the Anglican cemetery. Robert, who died before the end of the year, was cared for in his final months by their adopted Carib son, Robbie. Robert lies in the cemetery in the Carib Reserve not far from the one-room cabin that he and Phyllis had built.<br>
