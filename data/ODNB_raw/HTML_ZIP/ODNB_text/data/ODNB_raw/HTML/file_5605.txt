<span class="headword">Clement,  William Innell</span>  (1779/80&#150;1852), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor</span>, was born probably in London, of humble parents, and received only a scanty education. He married, first, at St Clement Danes, Westminster, on 13 April 1800, Jemima Jones; and second, at St Andrew's, Holborn, on 19 July 1811, Maria Isabella Jones. He became one of the leading newsvendors in London, and in 1814 extended his press activities when he bought <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, which had been founded in 1791. Two years later he was accepting moneys from the government in return for supporting them, and for distributing free copies of the paper. Clement aimed at making <span class="italic">The Observer</span> the leading Sunday newspaper&#151;&#145;a seventh-day paper&#146;; and by not printing until four o'clock on Sunday morning he was able to provide the latest news.<br>
<br>In 1819 Clement's deputy publisher, George Goodger, revealed that <span class="italic">The Observer</span> sold 10,850 copies on a Sunday, plus a further 2000 of its Monday print, all of which were stamped. However, he believed that 10,000 other copies, unstamped, were given away, under the pretence of being specimen copies. Postmen were each sent approximately 200 copies of the paper, and were asked to distribute them without charge. One postman said he &#145;was given two or three shillings for his trouble. He delivered them to the lawyers, doctors and gentlemen of the town&#146;  (Griffiths, 154). Clement himself admitted that free distribution of <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, on behalf of the government, extended to Bath and Dublin.<br>
<br>Apart from owning <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, Clement was by this time also the publisher of William Cobbett's <span class="italic">Weekly Register</span>, but it proved not to be a happy relationship: Cobbett, upon the suspension of the <span class="roman">Habeas Corpus Act</span> in 1817, fled to America and remained there until 1819. In the summer of 1820 Clement, based at 192 Strand, London, sold the property and his newsvending business to W. H. Smith, and the following year, upon James Perry's death, he bought the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> for &pound;42,000, retaining John Black as editor. However, the purchase of the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> was not a success, and he had been obliged to raise the greater portion of the money by bills. Through these transactions he became involved with Messrs Hurst and Robinson, upon whose bankruptcy he suffered greatly.<br>
<br>To make <span class="italic">The Observer</span> an even more popular and influential paper, Clement continued to spend money on the title, and he was fortunate that in Lewis Doxat he had a most successful editor-manager. Doxat, who served the paper for fifty-three years, revelled in the fact that &#145;he never wrote an article on any subject whatever&#146;. During those years, Clement believed in &#145;a well-paid and well-informed staff&#146;, and as a result, with the use of new typography and woodcuts, the contents of the paper improved greatly&#151;especially at the time of the Cato Street conspiracy in 1820, when circulation doubled. However, Clement overreached himself when, ignoring the express injunction of the lord chief justice who presided over the trials of the Cato Street conspirators, he &#145;unlawfully and contemptuously&#146; published in <span class="italic">The Observer</span> an account of the trials of Thistlewood and Ings. Clement was fined &pound;500 for contempt of court, but the fine was never paid.<br>
<br>In 1824 or 1825 Clement bought <span class="italic">Bell's Life in London</span>, which was to become the leading sporting paper and extremely prosperous; during the next twenty years he saw its circulation rise from 3000 to more than 30,000. The editor was Vincent George Dowling, who remained in charge until his death in October 1852. Dowling was also the chief reporter on <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, and in the pay of the Home Office. During those years Lord Palmerston wrote editorials for the paper in support of his foreign policy, and he paid Clement from secret service funds. At his peak, in 1828, Clement owned four major London titles: <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, <span class="italic">Bell's Life in London</span>, and <span class="italic">The Englishman</span>. But, within six years, despite support from the whigs, he was forced to sell the loss-making <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> to Sir John Easthope for an estimated &pound;16,500. William Clement remained in charge of <span class="italic">The Observer</span> until his sudden death from apoplexy at Hackney, Middlesex, on 24 January 1852. He was buried at Kensal Green cemetery on 31 January.<br>
