<span class="headword">M'Carthy <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Gu&eacute;roult]</span>, Sir  Charles</span>  (1764&#150;1824), <span class="occ">colonial governor and army officer</span>, came from the Irish sept of the name. He was the second son of Jean Gabriel Gu&eacute;roult and Charlotte Michelle, granddaughter of Michael MacCarthy, who went to France with James II. An uncle, Charles Thaddeus Fran&ccedil;ois MacCarthy, knight of St Louis, and an officer of the guards of Louis XV, persuaded M'Carthy to adopt his mother's maiden name. M'Carthy's elder brother (1765&#150;1793), a captain in the Irish brigade in the French service, died unmarried; a sister married Charles Fran&ccedil;ois, Comte Fontaine de Morv&eacute;, and died childless.<br>
<br>After the revolution the Irish brigade, formerly in the service of France, was reorganized in British pay and M'Carthy was appointed on 1 October 1794 ensign in the regiment of James Henry, Count Conway&#151;afterwards called the 5th regiment of the Irish brigade&#151;with which he served in the West Indies. He was made a lieutenant on 31 December 1795 and captain on 1 October 1796. In 1800 he was appointed captain 52nd foot and, on 14 April 1804, major in the New Brunswick fencibles (afterwards the Old 104th foot), a fine body of backwoodsmen which he commanded for several years. On 30 May 1811 he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in the Royal African Corps, and the year after was made governor of Senegal and Gor&eacute;e. When these settlements were returned to France under the treaty of 1814 M'Carthy was transferred to Sierra Leone as governor, and when Cape Coast Castle was taken out of the hands of the Royal African Company, he was sent to govern there as well. On 22 November 1820 he was knighted (KCMG), and on 19 July 1821 attained the rank of colonel.<br>
<br>In December 1823, M'Carthy received news that the Asante, incensed at the protection given to the Fante, were moving down in force against Cape Coast. After arranging the defence of the settlement by African auxiliaries, on 10 January 1824 M'Carthy set out with a small advance force, consisting of a company of the Royal Africans, and some colonial militia and volunteers. Exhausted with marching in the heavy rains, and having expended its ammunition, on 21 January 1824 the little band was routed by an overwhelming force of Asante. M'Carthy was mortally wounded, and his head taken by the Asante as a war trophy. M'Carthy had tried to advance Christianity and Western customs, particularly in the villages set up for recaptives.<br>
