<span class="headword">Horn,  Alexander</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Maurus]</span>  (1762&#150;1820), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk and political agent</span>, was born in north-east Scotland on 28 June 1762, the son of Alexander Horn and Jeanette, his wife (<i>d</i>. 1807). His father was descended from the Horns, lairds of Westhall (Oyne, Aberdeenshire). He entered Regensburg seminary in December 1772, took the Benedictine habit and religious name Maurus in 1778, and was professed on 29 September 1779. He was ordained priest, probably about 1785.<br>
<br>Clearly possessing academic ability, about 1789 Horn was apparently considering work on Marianus Brockie's <span class="italic">Monasticon Scoticum</span>. At this time the Scots' monastic library was being praised in print by visiting bibliophiles. Horn was librarian in 1790 and had bought incunables, and later was to receive great praise for his work as librarian. His interests, however, widened. From about 1790 he acted as agent in Regensburg, seat of the imperial diet, for the British ambassador in Munich, and in 1791 published anonymously a tract condemning France's activities against the empire: <span class="italic">Kurze and unparteiische Darstellung aller Tractaten und Vertr&auml;ge, auf welche Frankreich seine dermaligen Angriffe auf das deutsche Reich gr&uuml;nden sucht</span>. Another such paper was delivered by his fellow Scottish monk Ildephonse Kennedy to the Bavarian Academy of Sciences in Munich. Horn now cultivated influential people, had close ties with the princely family of Thurn and Taxis&#151;his brother, also a monk, was later <i>Hofrat</i> (court official) and confessor to them&#151;and led a social life, being described by an English visitor in late 1794 as &#145;such a wild young fellow, that it is a real shame that he should have the monkish habit&#146;  (Fremantle, 2.9). John Robison's sensational work published in 1797 on the alleged international conspiracy of freemasons, illuminati, and Jacobins contained important material supplied by Horn.<br>
<br>In 1799 Horn travelled with the British ambassador in Munich to England, where he had dealings with members of William Pitt's cabinet, particularly Earl Spencer, then returned to Regensburg as official British agent. This was the time of secularization of religious houses in south Germany. Horn used his bibliographical expertise to deal in rare books and manuscripts, including some from these houses, and helped to build up Spencer's magnificent collection. When in 1802 secularization in Regensburg itself became imminent, he appealed to the British government on behalf of the Scots monastery and (with more success) to the cardinal protector of Scotland in Rome, as the Scots abbey enjoyed exemption from all church authority except the Holy See. He and his abbot, Benedict Arbuthnot, also sought the aid of Napoleon's Scottish Catholic generals, Macdonald and Lauriston. In the event the monastery continued in being, though with restrictions.<br>
<br>In 1804 Napoleon succeeded in having the British ambassador expelled from Munich. Horn was then British charg&eacute; d'affaires in Regensburg (1804&#150;6), dealing most successfully with the diet and heading a network of informants. When Rome in 1805 intervened at Napoleon's request, he chose to give up his monastic commitments and continue his political work. Having for a time acted clandestinely in Regensburg, he went to Austria as a British diplomat and agent. His reports from Linz, Vienna, and Prague show him to have been an acute observer in close touch with important political and military persons. In 1808&#150;10 he was the sole British diplomat in central Europe. When Austria fell in 1810, he went to London and received a generous government pension.<br>
<br>Horn's later years are obscure. After returning to Regensburg in December 1813 he was expelled by order of Montgelas. He then lived with a pension at Frankfurt am Main. At some point he married a Baroness von Gumppenberg. In April 1820, with permission from Munich, he planned to return to Regensburg with the princess of Thurn and Taxis, but died, either shortly before or after, on 16 April. He is included in the monastic necrology, indicating that he was reconciled with the church authorities or perhaps, in such traumatic times for monasticism, was not considered an apostate from religion.<br>
