<span class="headword">Cole, Sir  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1576, <em>d.</em> 1653), <span class="occ">army officer and landowner in Ulster</span>, was baptized on 7 October 1576 at St Mary Woolnoth, London, the only son of Emmanuel Cole (<i>c</i>.1542&#150;1592?), a member of the Goldsmiths' Company, of St Botolph, Aldersgate, and his first wife, Margaret Ingram (<i>d</i>. 1578), aunt of Sir Arthur Ingram. He was born into a London business family with derivation, as certified by heralds, from the gentry family of Cole of Slade in Devon. His early years and education are obscure and he did not attend either university or an inn of court.<br>
<br>Cole saw military service in the Netherlands before the turn of the century and then fought in Ireland during the Nine Years' War. Present at the siege of Kinsale in 1601 and having served as a lieutenant under Captain Richard Hansard for two years, Cole was selected to carry letters to Sir Robert Cecil and the privy council in England on 13 December, with a recommendation from Sir George Carew, president of Munster, for a command of his own. From October 1603 he was in Ulster as captain of boats and barges at Ballyshannon and on Lough Erne, but with peace and then a somewhat conciliatory policy towards Ulster he sought through former lord deputy Sir George Cary, in January 1607, a recommendation from principal secretary Salisbury for a foot company in the Low Countries. However on 15 May 1607 he secured royal instructions to lord deputy Chichester to confirm this office to him, and it was granted by patent, on a reduced stipend, on 10 September following. He became constable of Enniskillen, formerly Maguire's stronghold, in April 1609 and received substantial payments for building works on the fort and castle there (which may have included the watergate) over the next few years. When the plantation in Ulster was implemented from 1610 he was well positioned to acquire a servitor's estate nearby, and shortly thereafter he purchased another estate in the neighbourhood, Portora, which had been granted to a Scottish undertaker. He subsequently acquired some additional portions of land which had been granted to restored Irish owners.<br>
<br>Cole was the founder of the modern plantation town of Enniskillen, co. Fermanagh (which had over fifty new male inhabitants, English and Scottish, by 1630 and a new church), built on an island in Lough Erne and incorporated in 1613, and was granted the land designated to promote urbanization there in 1612. The town consisted of two zones or sectors, military and civil, and Cole received a grant of the fort zone in a cost cutting exercise in 1623, which integrated both under his ownership. He thus occupied a prominent position in the plantation in co. Fermanagh, and was on a number of occasions sheriff of the county and involved in the contentions of early plantation society there. Cole was knighted by lord deputy Sir Oliver St John in 1617. He married in Ireland Susanna, or Susan (<i>d</i>. in or before 1653?), widow of Stephen Seagar, lieutenant of Dublin Castle, and daughter of John Croft of Lancashire. Cole also maintained contact with relatives in London, one of them a lawyer of the Inner Temple and official of the court of wards. In 1633 he was briefly imprisoned for his refusal to pay contributions after the end of subsidies.<br>
<br>Sir William was a member of parliament for County Fermanagh both in 1634 and in 1640, and sat on various parliamentary committees, the most important that concerning the Commons' petition of remonstrance of 7 November 1640, and was on the committee sent to the king in England to present the grievances of the house. With the outbreak of the rising in 1641 (of which he had received some forewarning, passed on to the authorities in Dublin), Enniskillen was not captured, and Cole was one of those granted a commission by the king in November to raise troops to combat the rebellion. He received payments from the English parliament for the supply of his forces in 1642 and 1643. In December 1644 he was, however, accused before the committee of both kingdoms in London of partiality towards some of the Irish of co. Fermanagh, but responded that this had saved the lives of many protestants. He insisted too that he had been one of the first colonels of the British regiments in Ulster to take the oath of the solemn league and covenant, and he was in London for the trial of Connor, Lord Maguire, in February 1645. He sought substantial supplies from the committee of both houses for Irish affairs (after the battle of Benburb) in July 1646, and received a lesser amount in that and the following year. Cole's military actions during the 1640s are in some cases known: for example men of Enniskillen took part in the battle of Clones in June 1643. He also regained Crevenish Castle in co. Fermanagh after the cessation in September that year. In October 1645 Enniskilleners with others took part in a successful engagement in co. Sligo, but in November a detachment of Owen Roe O'Neill's army carried out an attack on his winter quarters on Boa Island in Lower Lough Erne, which, though this force was afterwards pursued by Cole's men, may have deterred him from taking part in a second intended intervention in Connaught. Eventually Enniskillen was seized from him by some of his own officers in March 1649 for the royalist cause, but it reverted to Commonwealth control in 1650.<br>
<br>Sir William was in London again, apparently, in 1651, but died in October 1653 in Dublin, where he had relations among its growing New English population; he was buried there in the same month in St Michan's Church. He may have been predeceased by his wife, who was not mentioned in his will. His eldest son, Michael, who predeceased him, having died during the confederate wars, had about 1640 married Katherine, daughter of Sir Laurence Parsons of King's county, while his second son, John, who acquired property in co. Dublin, married Elizabeth, daughter of John Chichester of Dungannon. His daughter Mary married the Revd Robert Barclay, the Scottish born dean of Clogher (Cole's agent in London in 1643), and his elder daughter, Margaret, married Sir James Montgomery, son of the Scottish settler Sir Hugh Montgomery. Cole's descendants became earls of Enniskillen and built the mansion house Florence Court in the eighteenth century, where what is taken to be a portrait of him hangs.<br>
