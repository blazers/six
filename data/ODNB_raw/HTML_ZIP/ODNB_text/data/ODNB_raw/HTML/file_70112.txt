<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Green,  Bernard <span class="st"> [Benny]</span></span>  (1927&#150;1998), <span class="occ">jazz saxophonist, writer, and broadcaster</span>, was born at 260 Meanwood Road, Leeds, on 9 December 1927. His father, David Green, was a tailor and saxophonist and had met his mother, Fanny Fryer, while he was playing with a band in Leeds. They were married in London in 1926 and lived with David's father, an immigrant Russian-Jewish tailor, at 1 Greenwell Street in the Tottenham Court Road area of London, a chaotic family home where music and gambling were endemic. Benny Green was born in Leeds because his mother preferred to be looked after by her own family at this crucial time, but the family were soon back in London to live round the corner from Greenwell Street, in a basement flat in Cleveland Street. Here he grew into the streetwise but sentimental cockney-Jewish character who eventually became a well-loved radio figure, spoilt by doting aunts and on his way to fulfilling a casual prophecy that he would not do a day's paid work until he was twenty-one. He was first educated at Clipstone junior mixed school &#145;on the slummy edge of Marylebone&#146; and then, as he put it, &#145;uneducated&#146; at Marylebone grammar school  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 24 June 1998). After leaving without scholastic distinction in 1941, he continued a sporadic education at the North London emergency secondary school, mainly educating himself, with great success as it turned out, by a thorough indulgence in whatever enthusiasms he happened to discover. These did not include national service, which he endured for 167 days in 1946&#150;7 before contriving his release.<br>
<br>Benny Green's own writings and a sensitive, amusing, and perceptive book, <span class="italic">Benny Green: Words and Music</span> (2000), by his son Dominic Green see his life as falling into two distinct parts&#151;the early days as a footloose saxophonist, and then, after a complete change in the late 1950s, a second career as a highly professional and wide-ranging writer and broadcaster. Encouraged by his father, he took up the saxophone in 1941, and he started to play professionally in 1943 along with his boyhood friends Ronnie Scott and Harry Klein. He earned a modest living as a jazz musician, achieving the distinction of being voted &#145;most promising new jazz musician&#146; in a <span class="italic">Melody Maker</span> poll in 1953. There had been a brief period of study at the Royal College of Music and a period with the band led by the pianist Ralph Sharon, and in 1953 he joined Ronnie Scott's nine-piece band (which was later expanded). A high point was two days in the ranks of the visiting Stan Kenton orchestra. In 1957 Green played in the Dizzy Reece quintet, but, although an accomplished jazzman and an often outstanding soloist, he decided that he was not destined to make his true mark as a musician. A battery of letters offering his qualifications and qualities as a writer was sent around; one to the Decca Record Company resulted in a commission to write a chapter on jazz saxophone in <span class="italic">The Decca Book of Jazz</span> (1958)&#151;a competent and discerning piece that was one of the best in the book&#151;followed by a number of record sleeve notes. Green began to write a weekly column for the <span class="italic">New Musical Express</span>, and in 1958 took over from Kingsley Amis as jazz columnist for <span class="italic">The Observer</span>. His experience as a playing musician, a rare asset among the critics of the time, made him a particularly perceptive jazz critic; his book <span class="italic">The Reluctant Art</span> (1962) is still one of the best British books on the subject. He also wrote a jazz-slanted novel, <span class="italic">Blame it on my Youth</span> (1964), followed by <span class="italic">Fifty-Eight Minutes to London</span> (1969), which captured the night life of Brighton, always his favourite town after London. Soon after joining <span class="italic">The Observer</span> he became a regular jazz record reviewer for the BBC Third Programme and from then on was rarely absent from radio, notably presenting a Sunday afternoon record programme on Radio 2 during the last twenty or so years of his life. He was always astonished that such a fleeting medium as radio brought a celebrity to his life that years of professional playing and writing had failed to do. He was a natural talker and teller of anecdotes, and his broadcasts were enjoyed by so many because of the bonus of wit and humour that was added to the fund of knowledge and wisdom they contained.<br>
<br>Once set on his course as a writer and broadcaster, Green laid down the saxophone and thereafter made only brief returns to playing. On 4 January 1962 he married the actress (Ray) Antoinette Franklin, professionally known as Toni Kanal (<i>b</i>. 1941/2), and they eventually settled in a large house beyond Watford on the A41 and had five children. Beyond jazz he had a great width and depth of other interests. He was film critic for <span class="italic">Punch</span> from 1972, and this work overlapped with a period as literary critic for <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>. His literary interests embraced H. G. Wells; George Bernard Shaw&#151;resulting in one of his best books, <span class="italic">Shaw's Champions</span> (1978), on Shaw's interest in prize-fighting; P. G. Wodehouse&#151;leading to <span class="italic">P. G. Wodehouse: a Literary Biography</span> (1981), which dwelt on his theatre writings; and Jerome K. Jerome&#151;giving rise to a well-annotated edition of <span class="italic">Three Men in a Boat</span> (1982). He published an anthology of poems, <span class="italic">London</span> (1984), and a short, well-rounded book entitled <span class="italic">Fred Astaire</span> (1979). This last item reflected his wide interest in popular music that took in music-hall, on which subject he made one of his best broadcasts, <span class="italic">Maxie and a Lost Empire</span> (on Max Miller), and compiled an anthology, <span class="italic">The Last Empires: a Music Hall Companion</span> (1986). His own theatre writings included a revised libretto for <span class="italic">Show Boat</span> (1972), two Cole Porter compilations staged at the Mermaid, <span class="italic">Cole</span> (1974) and <span class="italic">Oh, Mr Porter</span> (1977), <span class="italic">The Quality of Mercer</span>, written with Helen Shapiro, and an anthology, <span class="italic">Words and Music</span>, given at the Ambassador's Theatre in 1984. Three musicals based on the writings of Shaw were less successful.<br>
<br>Throughout Green was a prolific journalist and wrote over 2000 scripts for radio, contributed to numerous magazines, wrote record sleeve notes and introductions to archival photographic books, read prolifically, and talked incessantly. His other great passion was cricket. He claimed that one of his great experiences was watching Denis Compton score 167 at Lord's in 1947. From this love came such compilations as <span class="italic">The Cricket Addict's Archive</span>, four volumes of <span class="italic">The Wisden Anthology</span> (1979&#150;83), <span class="italic">The Lord's Companion</span> (1987), <span class="italic">The Wisden Papers</span> (3 vols., 1989&#150;91), <span class="italic">The Concise Wisden</span> (1990), and <span class="italic">A History of Cricket</span> (1988). &#145;Since I retired as a saxophonist&#146;, he contentedly wrote, &#145;I've never gone to work. I just pursue my hobbies&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>).<br>
<br>It was ironic that, not having smoked until he was twenty-six, Green then succumbed through the sheer boredom of sitting in a touring band's coach. It was seventeen years before he gave up the habit, and by then it had induced the cancer that ended his career. He died in the Royal Marsden Hospital, Chelsea, on 22 June 1998. At the time he was working on books on Gilbert and Sullivan and Ronnie Scott.<br>
