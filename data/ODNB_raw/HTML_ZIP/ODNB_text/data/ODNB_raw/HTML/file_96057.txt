<span class="headword">Rayner,  John Desmond</span>  (1924&#150;2005), <span class="occ">rabbi and liturgist</span>, was born Hans Sigismund Rahmer, in Berlin, Germany, on 30 May 1924, the only son and younger child of Ferdinand Josef Adolf Rahmer (1887&#150;1942?), chief French correspondent at Deutsche Bank, and his wife, Charlotte, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Landshut (1897&#150;1942?). The Rahmers, entirely unobservant Jews, lived in the lower-middle-class Berlin suburb of Lindenhof, where Hans was the only Jewish child at the local school. After 1933, as antisemitism grew in Germany, his parents sent him to the Zionist Theodor Herzl Schule, where he learned excellent English, but his education was cruelly interrupted by the events of Kristallnacht, on 9 November 1938, after which his father was arrested by the SS. At that point the Rahmers hoped to emigrate. Hans's uncle, Kurt Landshut, was already in Uruguay, and promised to get them visas. The family was forced to leave its home in Lindenhof, which had been declared <i>Judenrein</i> (Jew free), and moved to a cramped shared apartment in Berlin's west end. It was to that home that Ferdinand Rahmer returned seven weeks after his arrest, with Hans unable to recognize as his father the man &#145;standing on the doorstep like a skeleton, with filthy clothes hanging loosely from him&#151;he looked like a scarecrow&#146;  (<span class="italic">Before I Forget</span>, 19). Shortly afterwards the family heard that Kurt Landshut had been swindled over the visas, so the Rahmers made every effort to get their children out of Germany. Hans came to England to board at Durham School, arriving, on 11 August 1939, on one of the last &#145;kindertransports&#146; that brought some 10,000 Jewish children to the UK.<br>
<br>Hans Rahmer went to live with the family of Robert William Stannard, rector of Bishopwearmouth, co. Durham, who soon became his family&#151;Uncle Will and Aunt Muriel. They succeeded in getting a nursing place for his sister Erica at Sunderland Royal Infirmary, and she arrived on 25 August 1939. Hans attended Durham School, and, later, with restrictions in place for German refugees in case they were Nazi agents, was transferred to Giggleswick School, from which he won an open scholarship in modern languages to Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He took that up in 1947, after four years in the Durham light infantry, during which he changed his name from Rahmer to Rayner.<br>
<br>At some point in 1946 his hope against hope that his parents might have survived was finally dashed&#151;he had received a last Red Cross note from them early in 1943, sending their love and asking him to &#145;pray to beloved God&#146;. They had apparently been arrested on 13 December 1942 and deported the following day, by cattle-truck, with about 800 people, of whom none survived, to Auschwitz.<br>
<br>While staying with the Stannards and the Wilkinsons, another clergy family, John Rayner became increasingly attracted by their liberal, open-minded brand of Anglicanism. He began to think seriously about religion, and discovered Liberal Judaism, first in Liverpool and then in London, so that the young man whose parents had practised nothing, and who had had a bar mitzvah at his own request in the little synagogue of a Jewish old people's home in Berlin, became convinced that he wanted to be a religious leader. He changed from modern languages at Cambridge to moral sciences (gaining a first) and then to Oriental languages, specializing in Hebrew. He became president of the Cambridge University Jewish Society and founded the Cambridge Progressive Jewish group. From then on, his service to the Jewish community was in no doubt.<br>
<br>Rayner was ordained into the Liberal Jewish ministry by Rabbi Israel Mattuck in June 1953, and served the South London Liberal Synagogue in Streatham as their first full-time paid minister until 1957, when he received the &#145;call&#146;, as he described it, to the Liberal Jewish Synagogue in St John's Wood, to be associate minister to Rabbi Leslie Edgar. The south London years were happy times. On 19 June 1955 he married Jane Priscilla Heilbronn (<i>b</i>. 1931), a secretary, and daughter of Lionel Heilbronn, manufacturer's agent, and his wife, Pauline; they had two sons and one daughter. In the early years of their marriage they lived penuriously&#151;the salary was minuscule&#151;in Upper Norwood, and made many friends. Rayner was particularly remembered in the congregation not only for his brilliant sermons and his unfailing devotion to pastoral care, but for his car, which, due to his lack of money, was an old, failing Austin Seven named Gomer after the prophet Hosea's wife, who had been unfaithful but whom he loved just the same. The Liberal Jewish Synagogue, with its place at the heart of the Liberal Jewish movement at the time, suited John Rayner perfectly. All three Rayner children were born in the first few years of his time there (Jeremy in 1957, Benjamin in 1959, Susan in 1962), and, following Leslie Edgar's retirement on health grounds in 1961, he became senior minister, only agreeing to do so if the congregation would give him two years' absence to study for rabbinic ordination at the Hebrew Union College&#150;Jewish Institute of Religion, in Cincinnati. He was ordained there privately in 1965.<br>
<br>Upon his return from America, Rayner's life's work in liturgy and teaching began. He produced, together with his great friend the American rabbi Chaim Stern, the sabbath, festival, and high holy day prayer books for the Liberal movement (in 1967, 1995, and 1973 respectively). He produced one passover <span class="roman">Haggadah</span> for the Liberal movement in 1962, with John Rich, and then in 1981 edited a wholly new <span class="roman">Haggadah</span>, with new material and detailed notes, as well as writing pamphlets, lectures, and articles. Among his books were <span class="italic">Judaism for Today</span> (1978) with Bernard Hooker, <span class="italic">The Jewish People</span> (1987) with David Goldberg, and three collections of sermons and lectures.<br>
<br>Rayner's sermons were beautifully crafted, often very moving, and always passionately felt. People often did not agree with him, but he was recognized as one of the country's greatest preachers, <i>inter alia</i> by <span class="italic">Harpers and Queen</span> magazine in 1976. He was also the foremost Jewish liturgist of the twentieth century. His knowledge and expertise were unparalleled, and his capacity to find words from the early versions of traditional prayers that fitted with modern Liberal Jewish theology was truly astonishing, such that his notes to each prayer book were consulted by scholars the world over. To add to that, though he was never fully acknowledged for it, his prayer books became the basis of modern American Reform liturgy as well. His collaboration with Chaim Stern was a felicitous one. Though Rayner wrote elegant prose, Stern had more of the poet in him; the combination of Rayner's learning and scholarship with Stern's own compositions created an excellent contemporary liturgy. Their prayer books received widespread approval, even from those not wholly sympathetic to their universalistic theology. Rayner used to quote with embarrassed amusement the letter he received from another great scholar, Jakob Petuchowski, after <span class="italic">Service of the Heart</span> was published (in 1967), that ended with &#145;all good wishes to you, your family, and all mankind&#146;  (Rayner, &#145;The liturgy of Liberal Judaism&#146;, lecture at Northwood and Pinner Liberal Synagogue, 17 Feb 2002, privately printed, 8). He also piloted the use of gender inclusive language, particularly in relation to God, and introduced a radical change when he substituted &#145;you&#146; in addressing God for the &#145;Thou&#146; of the old Liberal liturgy.<br>
<br>Rayner taught at Leo Baeck College, becoming honorary director of studies on his return from the United States. He lectured in rabbinic literature, codes, and liturgy for some thirty-five years, inspiring his students with his knowledge, and, perhaps even more, his devotion to the texts. All this, with his unrelenting schedule of pastoral and congregational duties, led to ill health. He underwent coronary bypass surgery in 1980 and again in 1995, and the after-effects of an aneurysm operation in November 2003 left him confined to a wheelchair. Yet he never stopped. He was life president of Liberal Judaism, a vice-president of Leo Baeck College, and president of the London Society of Jews and Christians. He was appointed CBE in 1993 for his inter-faith work. But, all the honours he received in his lifetime notwithstanding, it was his courage and integrity that marked him out. He never flinched when being attacked by fellow Jews for his views on the state of Israel, and his assertion that many of its policies were unethical and indefensible; and he was fearless in his sermons encouraging his congregation to strive for a truly ethical, socially aware, prophetically inspired Judaism. For him, Liberal Judaism was no easy way to be Jewish&#151;it was harder than traditional Judaism. It required the informed and enlightened conscience, and it required enormous effort.<br>
<br>Rayner's courage and integrity were leavened with a playful sense of the absurd. He produced pastiche Shakespeare speeches on the burning Jewish issues of the day, wrote words to Christmas carol tunes to tease confirmation class students, and told joke after joke at dinner or at the end of a class. But he was a deeply serious scholar and religious leader, who truly believed that Judaism could be &#145;a major force for good and therefore for the survival of humanity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Before I Forget</span>, 185). He died of cancer of the liver and colon at his home, 37 Walmington Fold, Woodside Park, Barnet, London, on 19 September 2005, optimistic to the end, still working on a book, and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium four days later. He was survived by his wife and their three children.<br>
