<span class="headword">Orr,  James</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em> the Bard of Ballycarry]</span>  (1770&#150;1816), <span class="occ">radical and poet</span>, born in the parish of Templecorran, co. Antrim, was the only child of James Orr, a linen weaver, who also farmed a few acres of land near Ballycarry. The family, like most of its neighbours, was of Scots descent and Presbyterian. The younger Orr never attended school, but was taught by his parents to read and write. He joined his father in weaving, and like several of his contemporaries began at an early age to write verse. This was locally popular, and many of his poems appeared in the Belfast <span class="italic">Northern Star</span>. Orr's political beliefs were influenced by millennial hopes for the amelioration of mankind; these, and enthusiasm for education and freemasonry, are all found in his writing. He came to be known as the Bard of Ballycarry. He took part in the battle of Antrim on 7 June 1798, and is credited with having saved some lives on that occasion, by dissuading his fellow insurgents from unnecessary violence. After the failure of the uprising he escaped to America and published poetry in newspapers there. He returned to Ireland in a very short time, and came into possession of the tenancy of the farm on his father's death. His application in 1800 to join the yeomanry was rejected; his radical sympathies were still too obvious. In 1804 he issued a small collection of his poems by subscription at Belfast. Some of his later poems, originally published in newspapers, including the once well-known &#145;The Irishman&#146;, were collected after his death and at his request published for the benefit of the poor of Ballycarry. Several newspaper essays on morality, in prose, may have been by Orr, but have not been republished. His best writing is in the Ulster-Scots language of his own area; the poems have considerable fluency, charm, and power, and the accuracy of his observation of the linguistic and social characteristics of his community partly accounts for Orr's contemporary and continuing popularity in Ulster. His ambitious and often accomplished poems in the standard language, more accessible for a modern audience, provide evidence of the balance between local involvements and wider interests which is represented in Orr's personality as well as in his verse. Orr is probably Ulster's most important eighteenth-century poet; his work is increasingly recognized by scholars as of more than local significance. A sketch of his life by his friend A. McDowell prefaces the posthumous poems, published in 1817, and also appears in a collected edition published by Ballycarry people in 1935; a selection of his poems appeared in 1977 and another in 1992.<br>
<br>Despite or perhaps partly because of his popularity and literary success, Orr drank heavily in the years after the deaths of his parents; this is said to have caused his own death at Ballycarry, co. Antrim, on 24 April 1816. He was unmarried. He was buried in Templecorran churchyard, and a large monument with masonic motifs was erected over his grave.<br>
