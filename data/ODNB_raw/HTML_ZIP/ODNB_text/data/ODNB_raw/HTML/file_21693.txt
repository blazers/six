</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pearce,  Zachary</span>  (1690&#150;1774), <span class="occ">bishop of Rochester</span>, was born on 8 September 1690 in the parish of St Giles, High Holborn, the son of Thomas Pearce (1666/7&#150;1752), a wealthy distiller who retired at the age of forty to Little Ealing, Middlesex. Zachary was educated first at a private school in Great Ealing, then at Westminster School. He was elected a queen's scholar on 12 February 1704 and remained at Westminster until he was nineteen. The school liked to keep able boys as long as possible and Pearce attributed his linguistic and philological skills to this long initiation. He matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, on 8 June 1710, became a scholar in 1711, and graduated BA in 1713&#150;14. In his early years at Cambridge he indulged himself in some humorous writing, contributing a fanciful account of a silent club to <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> in 1713 and an essay on quacks to <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> in 1714 under the pseudonym Ned Mum. In 1716 he published a scholarly edition of Cicero's <span class="italic">De oratore</span> which established his academic reputation. He dedicated this to the lord chief justice, Thomas Parker, who prevailed on Richard Bentley, master of Trinity, to award him a fellowship of the college that year.<br>
<br>Bentley agreed to this only on Parker's assurance that he would soon appoint Pearce to a benefice. Having proceeded MA that year, Pearce was made a deacon on 22 December 1717 and ordained priest on 8 June 1718 by William Fleetwood, bishop of Ely. On the appointment of Parker (by then Lord Macclesfield) as lord chancellor on 12 May 1718, Pearce became his household chaplain, and was instituted rector of Stapleford Abbots, Essex, in December 1719, and on 10 March 1720 rector of St Bartholomew by the Exchange, the most valuable living in the City of London in the lord chancellor's gift. Macclesfield also persuaded Thomas Pelham-Holles, duke of Newcastle, to make Pearce one of the king's chaplains after Newcastle had noticed Pearce saying grace at a dinner and remembered they had been at school together. Pearce was a royal chaplain from 1721 to 1739. He celebrated his progress and acknowledged his background by his marriage in February 1722 to Mary (1702/3&#150;1773), daughter and heir of another wealthy Holborn distiller, Benjamin Adams. Pearce stated that they lived together happily for fifty-one years, although none of their children survived early infancy.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Pearce's career continued its advance. Macclesfield presented him to the living of St Martin-in-the-Fields on 10 January 1724, and the grateful Pearce dedicated his Greek edition of <span class="italic">De sublimitate</span> by Longinus to him later that year. 1724 also saw Pearce receive a Lambeth DD from William Wake, archbishop of Canterbury. When Macclesfield was impeached in 1725 Pearce lost a good patron, but remained faithful to the person, attending his trial every day, and afterwards retained his friendship and dined regularly with this &#145;great and good man&#146;  (Pearce, <span class="italic">Commentary</span>, 1.xvi). He soon acquired new patrons: another old Westminster schoolboy, the politician William Pulteney, who became earl of Bath in 1742, remained a close friend and patron for forty years and left Pearce an emerald ring in his will; William Clayton, from 1735 Baron Sundon, MP for Westminster from 1727 to 1741, was a parishioner at St Martin-in-the-Fields and Clayton's wife, Charlotte, introduced Pearce to Queen Caroline who, shortly before her death in 1737 promised him the next deanery. When the deanery of Wells fell vacant in 1739 Pearce applied to Sir Robert Walpole, but Walpole needed to reward political allies in the borough of Wells and left the deanery unfilled until the death of the dean of Winchester. Pearce was then instituted dean of Winchester on 1 August 1739 and Wells received its necessary political appointment.<br>
<br>Pearce was a scholar who did not search out controversy, but engaged in it when required in his earlier years. When Francis Atterbury, bishop of Rochester, was committed to the Tower of London on a charge of high treason for his support of the Jacobite succession, Pearce published two letters <span class="italic">To the Clergy of the Church of England</span> (1722), in which he denounced the bishop as a man &#145;full of ambition&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letter</span>, 5) who sought to replace the present royal family with &#145;one grown up under the very Wing of the Papal See&#146;  (Pearce, <span class="italic">Letter</span>, 8); he defended the government action as &#145;reasonable and necessary&#146;  (<span class="italic">Second Letter</span>, 15). Echoing Swift's comments on Bolingbroke, Pearce denounced the tory ministers of Queen Anne during 1710&#150;14 as &#145;Persons who retired from the Guidance of the Realm, to the loose and lascivious Pleasures of a Mistress's Bed; and rose in the Morning to a Council of State, from the jolly Noise of the Glass and Bottle&#146;  (<span class="italic">Second Letter</span>, 24). Soon, he moved from this vigorous support of whig orthodoxy to the defence of traditional Christian doctrine. In <span class="italic">The Miracles of Jesus Vindicated</span> (1729) Pearce attacked Thomas Woolston's series of discourses on the miracles, and in <span class="italic">A Reply to the Letter to Dr Waterland</span> (1731) he challenged Conyers Middleton's 1731 attack on Daniel Waterland's <span class="italic">Scripture Vindicated</span> (1730), accusing Middleton of seeking to weaken the authority of Moses. His attack in 1733 on Richard Bentley's new edition of <span class="italic">Milton's &#145;Paradise Lost&#146;</span> (1732) was a strictly literary work in which he opposed Bentley's &#145;imaginary emendations&#146;  (<span class="italic">Commentary</span>, 1.xxxiii). He was an acquaintance of Sir Isaac Newton and discussed Newton's <span class="italic">Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended</span> with the author shortly before Newton's death in 1727, and then attended his funeral.<br>
<br>Pearce's concern for orthodoxy and order within the church led him in 1756 to refuse George Whitefield permission to preach in Long Acre Chapel, but Whitefield ignored the prohibition and wrote a series of long letters of personal justification to Pearce suggesting &#145;France and Rome and Hell might be the common butt of our resentment&#146;  (Pearce papers, WAM 64773). Pearce was resolute in his opposition and soon a raucous mob outside the chapel regularly drowned Whitefield's words with the &#145;unhallowed noise&#146;  (Pearce papers, WAM 64775) of drums, copper furnaces, clappers, marrowbones, and cleavers. Whitefield threatened to publish the correspondence if this &#145;premeditated rioting&#146;  (Pearce papers, WAM 64777) continued and Pearce warned him it was illegal to publish the letters of a peer without permission. But the clamour ceased and Whitefield begged Pearce &#145;to accept my hearty thanking for stopping the noise that used to be made, since I hear it was owing to Your Lordship's admonitions&#146;  (Pearce papers, WAM 64778). However, despite this conciliatory act, Pearce remained hostile to the irregular activities of enthusiasts and evangelicals. In 1769 he reproved Sir Sidney Stafford Smythe for attending Selina Hastings, countess of Huntingdon's chapel in Tunbridge Wells and so encouraging &#145;great Irregularities with regards to the Discipline and good Order &amp; Government of the Ch. of England&#146;  (Pearce papers, WAM 64547&#150;8). Two years later, he described the design of the Feathers tavern petitioners as &#145;a wild, dangerous and impractical one &hellip; of a most mischievous nature&#146;  (Pearce papers, WAM 64474).<br>
<br>Although an anonymous critic in 1743 described Pearce as &#145;a Court-Clergyman, a Hunter of Preferments; a man who is for obtaining a Mitre, by Methods which ought in Justice to exclude him from a Curacy&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Letter to Dr Z. Pearce</span>, 18), in the memoir Pearce later wrote of his own life between 1710 and 1768 he portrays himself as a reluctant careerist who never sought high office. There is a degree of independent evidence to support this. In an age when most clerics' letters to their patrons are fulsome, Pearce's are concise and businesslike, at times almost terse. In 1746 he assured John Potter, archbishop of Canterbury, that he was financially secure and had no desire for a bishopric. Nevertheless he was offered Bangor in 1748. He declined and was summoned by Newcastle, who told him that although he could not hold the deanery of Winchester <i>in commendam</i> with Bangor, he could retain St Martin-in-the-Fields. Pearce declined again and was summoned to Lord Chancellor Hardwicke, who asked him &#145;If Clergymen of learning and merit will not accept of Bishopricks, how can the Ministers of State be blamed, if they are forced to fill them with others less deserving?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Commentary</span>, 1.xxiii), whereupon Pearce consented and was consecrated on 21 February 1748. Much of Pearce's reluctance was due to the remoteness of Bangor. On 26 January 1748, hearing of the death of Robert Butts, bishop of Ely, and presuming there would be a vacancy &#145;in one of the English Bishopricks now held by a Bishop educated at Cambridge&#146;, he had written to Newcastle begging &#145;that, instead of having my election to Bangor confirmed, I may be appointed to such English Bishoprick as shall become vacant&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 32714, fol. 111). In 1747 Thomas Secker claimed to be afraid to meet Mrs Pearce after his role in the Bangor appointment which forced her &#145;to quit the place [Winchester] she is so fond of&#146;  (Pearce papers, WAM 64681).<br>
<br>When Pearce's father died on 14 August 1752 he inherited his large fortune and three years later he told Archbishop Thomas Herring he wished to resign Bangor and enjoy a private life. With one exception, he had made annual visits to his remote diocese since his consecration, but now his health was poor. In a letter of 17 August 1752 Pearce complained to Herring: &#145;I went thro' many difficulties to get to this place, and many more have I undergone in my Visitation of my Diocese since my arrival here, by reason of bad roads and bad weather&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 32420, fol. 77). Herring, who had been at Bangor himself, sympathized about the remote country, dilapidated palace, and dangerous roads, and remembered experiencing &#145;on Horseback &hellip; the Terrors of those ugly stretches&#146;  (Pearce papers, WAM 67575). In his commonplace book, Pearce mocked both Welsh spelling and sobriety with the single word &#145;ddrrunnkq&#146;  (Pearce papers, WAM 64896, fol. 18). Herring had little difficulty persuading him to move from Bangor to Rochester, which see was traditionally held together with the deanery of Westminster. Pearce was duly installed as dean of Westminster on 15 April and bishop of Rochester on 9 July 1756. However, this was his final move; when the see of London became vacant in 1761 he resisted Lord Bath's urging to seek further promotion, and in 1763 he made a genuine effort to resign both his bishopric and his deanery. After a long correspondence with Thomas Secker, archbishop of Canterbury, about the legal precedents for a bishop resigning, both men agreed resignation should be made to the king, not the metropolitan. In an interview with the young king Pearce explained that, at seventy-three, he was too old for the job and wanted to devote his remaining years to devotion and study, wishing &#145;to have some interval between the fatigues of business and eternity&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 3.109). The king agreed, but his ministers were anxious about the implications of such a precedent on their control of the system of preferment, and the royal permission was withdrawn. In 1764 Pearce's patron Lord Bath suggested he resign just the deanery and so &#145;get rid of the troublesome part of your preferment, &amp; preserve the honourable part of it, which you may do with very little trouble&#146;  (Pearce papers, WAM 64724). The church hierarchy was anxious lest the link between Rochester and Westminster be broken. Thomas Newton, bishop of Bristol, begged him not to separate the bishopric and the deanery, pointing out how convenient the dean's house was for attending the House of Lords. However, five years later, the king did agree to his resignation of the deanery of Westminster.<br>
<br>On 1 October 1773, at Greenwich, Pearce confirmed around 700 of the laity, but the effort was too much for this 83-year-old man. The next day he was unable to speak and he never regained his former powers of easy articulation. His wife died on 23 October 1773. His paralysis increased; almost unable to swallow, he languished through months of lingering decay and died at his family home in Little Ealing, Middlesex, on 29 June 1774. His chaplain remembered him as tall of stature, venerable in appearance, and softly spoken. A sympathetic obituary claimed &#145;he was never puffed up with the general applauses of the world, but of a humble deportment&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 45, 1775, 421), while another remembered his &#145;regularity of life, tranquillity of mind, and simplicity of diet&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 46, 1776, 406). His extensive library contained the works of Rabelais and Rochester and two editions of Petronius's <span class="italic">Satyricon</span>, and his commonplace books reveal a man with a keen sense of humour, who was no prude; one holograph entry records that a<blockquote>Judge reprimanded a man who had ravish'd a Girl for picking sticks of his hedge, but was brought in not guilty at his trial; Sir, says he, you must leave off these practices, or you won't have a stick left in your hedge. (Pearce papers, WAM 64896, fol. 11)</blockquote>Pearce was buried next to his wife in the church at Bromley, Kent, close to the palace of the bishops of Rochester. He left his library to the dean and chapter of Westminster and his manuscripts to his chaplain; he endowed an almshouse in Bromley, Westminster Hospital, and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and built a registry for the records of the bishops of Rochester; his fortune was inherited by his brother, William Pearce of Abingdon Street, Westminster.<br>
