<span class="headword">Thompson,  William</span>  (1733&#150;1799), <span class="occ">Methodist minister</span>, was born at Newtonbutler, co. Fermanagh; little is known about his parentage or early life. It is reported how, as a young man undertaking a business journey to Dublin, Thompson heard a Methodist preach and experienced an evangelical conversion. On becoming a Methodist preacher in 1757 he crossed to Britain, where he laboured at various locations, including Newcastle upon Tyne, Leeds, Edinburgh, and Glasgow. About 1758 he was pressed as a sailor but was released through the intervention of the countess of Huntingdon. In 1764, while preaching in Lancashire, Thompson &#145;caught a violent cold by sleeping in a damp bed&#146;, an illness which apparently &#145;laid the foundation, and was the principal cause of those dreadful spasms in his stomach, which he laboured under for many years, and which, in the judgement of some of his friends, occasioned his death&#146;  (Atmore, 226). In 1769 he married in Edinburgh, though details of his wife are unknown.<br>
<br>Thompson was one of the hundred preachers appointed by John Wesley in his <span class="roman">Deed of Declaration</span> in 1784, which provided for the government of the Methodist Connexion after his own death. While serving as assistant minister of the Halifax circuit Thompson met with a group of preachers at Halifax, Yorkshire, in 1791 and produced a circular which suggested, among other things, that Wesley, having recently died, should be succeeded by a president and secretary who would be elected annually. This Halifax circular was sent out to the &#145;preachers in general and the assistants in particular&#146; and described the dangers which then faced the nascent Methodist church. Owing mainly to &#145;Thompson's peculiar genius for ecclesiastical polity&#146;  (Atmore, 225) and his reputation as a moderate, the Methodist conference meeting at Manchester in July 1791 elected him its first president after John Wesley.<br>
<br>Thompson was the main figure behind the &#145;plan of pacification&#146; (1795), which tried to resolve the sacramental question. This, together with his Halifax circular, constituted him one of the main architects of Methodism as it evolved following Wesley's death. Thompson's influence was also felt in his contribution as president. He was, according to Atmore, a &#145;man of remarkably strong sense, a fertile genius, a clear understanding, a quick discernment, a retentive memory, and a sound judgement&#151;one of the closest reasoners and most able speakers that ever sat in the Methodist Conference&#146;  (Atmore, 225).<br>
<br>In April 1799 ill health caused Thompson to leave Manchester and retire to Birmingham, where his eldest daughter had married a man of considerable wealth. It is reported that he &#145;suffered extreme pain in his last illness, which he bore with great patience, and with entire resignation to the Divine will&#146;  (<span class="italic">Minutes of the Methodist Conference</span>, 511). He died at Birmingham on 1 May 1799 and his body was interred in a vault in St Mary's Chapel, Birmingham.<br>
