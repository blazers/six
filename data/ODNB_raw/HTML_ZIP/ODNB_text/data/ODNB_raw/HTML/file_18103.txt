<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Marsden,  William</span>  (1796&#150;1867), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, the eldest of the eight children of David and Elizabeth Marsden, was born in Sheffield in August 1796 and baptized on 18 September 1796 at the church of St Peter and St Paul, Sheffield. After spending his early years in Sheffield he travelled to London and entered St Bartholomew's Hospital, where he was influenced by John Abernethy. While at St Bartholomew's, Marsden also served an apprenticeship to Mr Dale, a surgeon practising at Holborn Hill. Marsden also studied anatomy under Joshua Brookes. He obtained the membership of the Royal College of Surgeons on 27 April 1827.<br>
<br>Later in that year Marsden's inability to obtain admission to a hospital for an eighteen-year-old girl, whom he found on the steps of St Andrew's churchyard, gravely ill from malnourishment and disease, turned his attention to the question of hospital relief. Treatment was then granted only to those who could obtain a governor's letter or produce other evidence of being known to the subscribers to these institutions&#151;a situation which allowed subscribers to exercise considerable patronage. Marsden sought to rectify this situation by establishing in 1828 a small dispensary in Greville Street, Hatton Garden, to which the poor were admitted without such regulation. This institution at first met with great opposition, but in 1832 its value became widely recognized because, out of all the London hospitals, only Marsden's received cholera patients.<br>
<br>In 1843 the hospital was moved to Gray's Inn Road, to a site which was afterwards purchased through the generosity of wealthy friends; on it was built the Royal Free Hospital, of which Marsden became the senior surgeon. In 1838 he obtained the degree of MD from the University of Erlangen and in 1840 a handsome testimonial was presented to him by the duke of Cambridge on behalf of subscribers, in recognition of his work for the poor.<br>
<br>Marsden married twice and had one surviving child, a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34890/', "Alexander Edwin Marsden")</script>, from his first marriage (on 29 January 1820), to Elizabeth Ann (<i>d</i>. 1846). His second wife was Elizabeth, daughter of Francis Abbott, a solicitor. In 1851 Marsden opened a small house in Cannon Row, Westminster, for the reception of cancer patients. Within ten years the institution was moved to Brompton, where it later became the Royal Marsden Hospital. Marsden enjoyed a large practice, and throughout his life was a follower of Abernethy, and used his methods. Considered an acute observer by his contemporaries he employed a broad range of approaches to treatment. A busy clinician, he published only one text, <span class="italic">Symptoms and treatment of malignant diarrhoea, better known by the name of Asiatic or malignant cholera</span> (1834). He died of bronchitis at the Star and Garter Hotel, Richmond, Surrey, on 16 January 1867, and was buried in Norwood cemetery.<br>
