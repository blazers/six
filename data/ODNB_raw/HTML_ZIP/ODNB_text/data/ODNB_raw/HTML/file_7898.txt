<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hamilton,  James</span>, fourth duke of Hamilton and first duke of Brandon  (1658&#150;1712), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was born in Hamilton Palace on 11 April 1658 and baptized that same day. His father was William Douglas [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7935/', "Hamilton, William, third duke of Hamilton (1634&#150;1694)")</script>], and his mother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12046/', "Anne Hamilton (1632&#150;1716), third duchess of Hamilton")</script> in her own right, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12087/', "James Hamilton, first duke of Hamilton")</script>, and his wife, Lady Mary Feilding, whose father was William, first earl of Denbigh.<h2>
<a name="Birthandupbringing"></a>Birth and upbringing</h2>Called after his maternal grandfather, James, like his twelve brothers and sisters, took his mother's surname, for the second duke of Hamilton's entail stipulated that her husband and children were to &#145;take on, use and weir the name and armes of the house of Hamilton&#146; (Notes by third duke on the second duke's entail, Hamilton archives at Lennoxlove, RH 55/32/4; also 1693 memorandum for the fourth duke, RH 89/36/21).<br>
<br>As the eldest son James Hamilton bore the title of earl of Arran, and his birth was particularly significant, coming as it did after all the traumas suffered by the family during the civil wars. Since their marriage in 1656, Duchess Anne and her husband had worked painstakingly to retrieve her inheritance, a process completed after the Restoration in 1660. Their ambitious plans for the future centred on their heir, and the duchess was doubly attached to her first-born son because, small, dark and swarthy, he bore a close resemblance to her dead father. The duke and duchess gave careful thought to Arran's upbringing. Following the accepted practice of the Scottish peerage they decided to send him to the local school at Hamilton when he was about six. They also appointed John Bannantyne of Corehouse to be his governor. When he was eleven they anxiously consulted Sir Robert Moray as to what they should do next. In the end, however, they ignored Moray's advice that they should keep the boy at home with his governor, and instead they sent him to the grammar school in Glasgow, where he and Bannantyne lodged with Gilbert Burnet, at that time professor of theology in the university there. In 1671 Arran entered Glasgow University to read Greek and Latin, French, theology, geography, and logic. He had a singing-master, attended a dancing-school, and also learned to handle pike and musket. Both Burnet and Bannantyne complained that, high-spirited and thoroughly spoilt, he persistently wasted his time in low-born company, spent too much money, and lied to cover up his misdemeanours. &#145;Pray consider&#146;, his mother wrote to him in her usual forthright manner, &#145;what credit it will be to you that after four years being at the college you come from it a dunce&#146;  (NA Scot., GD 406/C1/5878).<br>
<br>In spite of their misgivings, the duke and duchess then sent Arran off on the grand tour. Whatever his deficiencies, the future head of the house of Hamilton must lack no advantage. After sailing to La Rochelle at the end of October 1675 the earl, his governor, and a page travelled first to Angers, where Arran made the most of his new found freedom. Bannantyne had to send home regular accounts of expenditure and when the duke of Hamilton read how much his son was spending on balls, masquerades, unnecessary clothes, and tennis he was furious. He replaced Bannantyne with James Forbes, who he hoped would be stricter, and wrote to warn Arran that if he did not regulate his expenditure better, &#145;your abode abroad will not be long, for it was to improve you in useful breeding you was sent there, and not to follow vanity and folly&#146;  (NA Scot., GD 406/C1/5878). Forbes escorted Arran to Blois, where they spent a few weeks before moving to Paris. After some carefully planned sightseeing the earl was enrolled in Monsieur Faubert's academy in the rue St Marguerite, off the faubourg St Germain. He passed the winter of 1676&#150;7 there, and when Arran was presented at court Forbes was able to report with satisfaction that Louis XIV actually smiled at the earl, &#145;which it is not very common to that king to do&#146;  (NA Scot., GD 406/5993). A few days before term ended on 4 May 1677 an unexpected letter came from the duke, instructing Forbes to take his charge to Italy.<br>
<br>Not many Scots on the grand tour went as far as Rome, in part because of the expense, in part because of presbyterian disapproval, but it was fashionable in English aristocratic circles and so Arran must have the opportunity. After a summer spent in Bourges they set off for Turin, where Arran was welcomed by the duke and duchess of Savoy, who treated him like a son. Travelling by way of Venice and Florence he and Forbes reached Rome on 20 February 1678. Arran visited all the antiquities, made friends with Philip Howard, known as Cardinal Norfolk, and sat for his portrait to Ferdinand Voet. He had by now developed a passion for paintings which was to remain with him for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>It was more than two years since Arran had left home; the duke of Hamilton had already spent more than &pound;1200 sterling on his son's travels, and he decided that it was high time that his heir came home, found a sensible Scottish wife, and settled down to produce a family. Reluctantly the earl returned to Paris, crossed the channel in the yacht <i>Merlin</i> and made his way to London, where his father was waiting. Although at first the duke reported that &#145;he carys himself discreetly and I use him as a comarade&#146; he was soon telling his wife that their son had neglected his studies abroad, wasted his time in bad company, and &#145;as for his sincerity, I fear he retains too much of the way he had when he was a child&#146;. Worst of all, the earl made it clear that returning to settle down in Scotland was, as his father remarked wryly, &#145;much the same to him as to go to the gallies&#146;  (NA Scot., GD 406/C1/8130).<h2>
<a name="Lifeatcourt"></a>Life at court</h2>After a fleeting visit to Hamilton Palace at the end of the year Arran hurried back to court where Charles II, on 25 January 1679, obligingly made his presence necessary by appointing him to be a gentleman of the bedchamber. Free at last from the oversight of father and governor Arran ran up huge debts, fought in duels, and engaged in numerous affairs, fathering at least three illegitimate children, James Abercrombie and Katherine and Mary Ruthven. In response to repeated parental urgings he also entered into marriage negotiations with a long series of aristocratic English ladies, but always withdrew before any contract could be finalized. In 1683 he was overjoyed when Charles II sent him to France as ambassador-extraordinary to congratulate Louis XIV on the birth of his grandson, Philippe, duc d'Anjou, and instead of returning home when his mission was over he stayed on. In the spring of 1684 he was made one of the French king's three aides-de-camp, along with the dauphin and the duc de Gramont, and told Lord Dartmouth proudly that this was &#145;an honour that no stranger ever had but myself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dartmouth MSS</span>, 1.115&#150;16). He also boasted that he had &#145;in prospect one of the finest ladies in France with a million&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Arran accompanied Louis XIV on two campaigns and when not on duty lived at Versailles in an apartment lent to him by the duc de Bouillon, swimming each day with the dauphin and walking with the king. He would probably have remained there indefinitely, but on 6 February 1685 Charles II died, and he was recalled to London. As a close friend of the new king, James VII and II, he was in July 1686 given command of a regiment of horse in the force raised to suppress the duke of Monmouth's rebellion. Two years later James made him a knight of the newly revived Order of the Thistle. The earl's financial problems were by now, however, acute. His debts amounted to some &pound;10,000 sterling, and his father had long since told him bluntly, &#145;untill you marry and thereby you bring in a portion [dowry] to the family, I will nether medle in your transactions nor concern myself in your debts&#146;  (NA Scot., GD 406/C1/7068).<h2>
<a name="Marriage"></a>Marriage</h2>Arran's old friend and patron Robert Spencer, second earl of Sunderland, at this point came to the rescue by suggesting that the earl marry his eldest daughter, Lady Anne Spencer (1667/8&#150;1690). Sunderland had his own reasons for suggesting the match. As James II turned increasingly to his Roman Catholic favourites Sunderland's power had been slipping away. The king was, however, relying on the duke of Hamilton in his dealings with Scotland and so Sunderland believed that he would retrieve his own position if he could form an alliance with the duke. The main difficulty lay in Arran's reluctance to commit himself to matrimony. Attractive and intelligent Lady Anne might be, but the earl did not want a wife. When, however, Sunderland suggested that they could work together to extract the best possible financial terms from the duke of Hamilton asking, for example, for a clause binding the duke to pay his son's debts, Arran was immediately won over.<br>
<br>On his arrival in London the duke of Hamilton was none too pleased to discover that negotiations had begun without his knowledge, but he was so relieved that Arran was actually considering a suitable bride that he gave his approval and set about scrutinizing the proposed conditions for the contract. He discussed the details with his wife, who remained at Hamilton, confiding to her that their son was &#145;in as much perplexety of thinking to be maried as I have been in fears not to be married to you&#146;  (NA Scot., GD 406/C1/7755). Although he was affronted by many of Arran's demands, the dowry of &pound;10,000 sterling, which he would control, reconciled him to these difficulties and the contract was finalized at last. During the ceremonial signing, on 5 January 1687, the duke noticed that Lady Anne &#145;seamed in some concern &hellip; which I thought no wonder of, for she cannot but know his wildness and she is not twenty till nixt summer&#146;  (NA Scot., GD 406/C1/7806). He went across to speak some encouraging words to her, for he liked her, and felt that if anyone could reclaim his son from his unfortunate way of life, it would be Lady Anne. She still looked very grave when the bishop of Rochester conducted the marriage in the dining-room of her father's lodgings at Whitehall on 10 January 1688, a wedding described by the diarist John Evelyn as being of &#145;extraordinary splendour&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Diary of John Evelyn</span>, ed. W. Bray, 2 vols., 1966, 2.273). However, against all expectation, she was won over by her husband's charm and fell deeply in love with him. Their first child, a daughter whom they named Anne, was born in London on 18 January 1689, only to die less than a month later.<br>
<br>That was the least of the couple's problems, for on 5 November 1688 William of Orange had landed in England. Arran had accompanied James VII and II to Salisbury and remained loyally by his side until his embarkation for France. The earl then returned to Whitehall, where he was shown into the new monarch's presence and greeted him defiantly, saying that he came by the command of the king his master. William promptly sent him to the Tower of London. Later claims that the third duke had advised the king to do so were based on a comment in Swift's <span class="italic">Memoirs of Captain Crichton</span>  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 12.75) and could have been true. His father may have seen this as the only way of restraining his heir from further folly but, on the other hand, it is unlikely that he would have sought such a public humiliation for the family.<br>
<br>Although Arran was released on a technicality when he was about to be tried in April 1689, he made no secret of his Jacobite sympathies and was incarcerated in the Tower again a few weeks later on suspicion of conspiring with the French court. It was almost a year before his father managed to negotiate his release, whereupon the earl promptly announced that he would rather stay in prison than face his irate creditors. The duke eventually managed to have him smuggled out one Sunday morning when no one was about, and Arran rode at once for Scotland, his heavily pregnant wife and his exasperated father following behind in a coach.<br>
<br>Arran and his countess went to live at Kinneil Castle in Linlithgowshire, which was small, but conveniently near Edinburgh. It seemed that, at last, he would be content to settle in Scotland, but all future plans were shattered when Lady Arran gave birth to a second daughter, Mary, but died soon afterwards of puerperal fever. Genuinely distraught, the earl left the baby with his mother and returned to London, where he began an affair with Charles II's illegitimate daughter, Lady Barbara Fitzroy. Nine months later she had his son, whom they named <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12053/', "Charles Hamilton (1691&#150;1754)")</script>. Arran also seems to have sought solace in a more unexpected quarter. When Patrick Home later gave a public oration on the earl in the College of Edinburgh, he recalled Arran's diligent researches in libraries after the death of his wife. The earl had made volumes of notes on Scottish history, which, said Home, &#145;wee hope will transmitt his fame to posterity&#146;  (NA Scot., GD 406/C1/5902). He had apparently inherited his father's fascination with historical research.<br>
<br>Unwelcome at court and still in financial difficulties, Arran was forced to spend 1691&#150;2 at Kinneil, but by 1693 he was back in London once more. The death of his father in 1694 made no difference to his position, for the family titles and estates remained with his mother, and so he spent much of his time in a renewed pursuit of wealthy heiresses. All his relatives were urging him to remarry and produce an heir, and Duchess Anne now held out the inducement that, if he did take a suitable wife, she would resign her titles to him. She would, of course, remain duchess of Hamilton and she would keep entire control of her estates, but he would have the title of fourth duke of Hamilton and he would be able to represent the family in the Scottish parliament. Thus encouraged, Arran began making serious approaches to Elizabeth Gerard (<i>c</i>.1682&#150;1744), the only child and heir of the late Digby, fifth Baron Gerard. Elizabeth was just thirteen when she came to his attention and he was nearing forty, but she was very rich, having inherited extensive properties in Lancashire and Staffordshire. Negotiations dragged on for more than three years but on 9 July 1698 Duchess Anne resigned her titles. The next day William III and II created her eldest son fourth duke of Hamilton; by 16 July 1698 the marriage contract had been signed and the wedding took place on 17 July at Bushy Park. Among James's and Elizabeth's seven children was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68355/', "Lady Susanna Keck")</script>, political manager.<h2>
<a name="FourthdukeofHamilton"></a>Fourth duke of Hamilton</h2>The new duke of Hamilton sat in the Scottish parliament for the first time on 21 May 1700, and spoke in an important debate on the Darien scheme. His mother had been the first person to subscribe to the company trading to Africa and the Indies, investing &pound;3000. The Scots blamed William III and II and the English for its subsequent disastrous failure, and the duke earned great popularity by his apparently patriotic stance. In 1702 Queen Anne succeeded William, and when negotiations began for a union of the Scottish and English parliaments the duke led the opposition. He spoke and voted against every article of the treaty of union, moving friend and foe alike to tears with his eloquence, but whenever any really decisive action was required of him he suffered a series of illnesses which seem to have been either diplomatic or psychosomatic. &#145;Everie one is sparring ether to speak or writ of your brother Hamilton to me&#146;, his mother told her eldest daughter, Katherine, on 7 September 1705, adding three days later, &#145;itt passes my comprehension to find out a tolerable face for his actings this session of parliament and I am so ashamd on his behalfe that I know nither what to say or how to look&#146;  (Atholl MS 45 V 119, 120).<br>
<br>Hamilton's supporters were bitterly disappointed by his erratic behaviour, which was occasioned not only by his awareness that his wife had brought him extensive estates in the south, but by his belief that if James VII and II were restored, he himself could become an acceptably protestant king of Scots because of his Stewart ancestry. When he went so far as to draw up a protest in the name of his mother and himself, declaring that the treaty of union should in no way prejudice their right to the crown of Scotland, not only Duchess Anne but the entire family were mortified. She refused to sign, telling him that the petition would do no good and would &#145;only expose me to be laughed at&#146;  (NA Scot., GD 406/C1/9744).<br>
<br>Hamilton seemed at first to support Cunningham of Eckatt's plan for an armed rising of the western shires, but suddenly sent a message to all those involved announcing a postponement and the scheme fell through. He then summoned the country gentlemen to Edinburgh to petition the queen for a new parliament and abruptly decided that unless their address insisted on a Hanoverian succession he could have nothing to do with it; in the ensuing arguments that plan also collapsed. When the twenty-second article of the treaty was being debated it was expected that the marquess of Annandale would move for the settlement of the Hanoverian succession. Everyone assumed that the motion would be defeated, and the duke told his friends that when that happened he would enter a protest and they would all walk out. On the day, however, he first refused to go to parliament at all, claiming that he had toothache, and then, although he was eventually persuaded to attend, he declined to present the counter-resolution. Torn between his old loyalties to the house of Stewart, his desire to please Queen Anne, and his personal ambitions, he felt unable to do anything in case he made the wrong decision.<br>
<br>After the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> was passed Hamilton remained in Scotland until the autumn of 1707, complaining that he could not afford to live anywhere else and hinting that his mother should invite him to stay permanently at Hamilton Palace. He nagged her until she gave him &pound;8000 sterling and then, leaving his two sons and three surviving daughters with her, to be brought up at her expense, he departed with his petulant young wife for the south. During the Jacobite invasion of Scotland in January 1708 he was arrested on his English estates, but he was soon released after he promised to support the whigs in the election of the Scottish representative peers. He himself became a representative peer that summer, and moved to London, renting a large house in St James's Square. He never visited Scotland again.<br>
<br>On the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell, Hamilton abandoned the whigs and was rewarded by the incoming tory administration with the lord lieutenancy of Lancashire. Still preoccupied with his claim to the throne, he was very conscious that Queen Anne's children had all died, and he seems to have decided to ingratiate himself with her in the hope of being recognized as her heir. In 1709 he astonished his friends by calling his third son Anne in her honour. In December 1710 he became a privy councillor and on 11 September 1711 was created a peer of Great Britain with the titles of duke of Brandon and Baron Dutton. There then ensued a long wrangle over whether a Scottish representative peer could sit in parliament by virtue of having been made a peer of Great Britain, and he never actually did so. He was also embroiled in a complicated lawsuit with his wife's family. One of the clauses in his marriage contract with Elizabeth had stated that he would pay her mother &pound;10,000 for her expenses in bringing up his wife. He failed to hand over the money and Lady Gerard sued him. When she died, leaving her daughter only 5<i>s</i>. and a diamond necklace, Lady Gerard's brother Charles, second earl of Macclesfield, continued the legal proceedings, eventually passing on the Gerard claims to his own heir Charles, fourth Baron Mohun. By 1711 Hamilton was insisting that Mohun owed him &pound;43,979 12<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>., the alleged profits from the Gerard estates during Elizabeth's minority together with the value of her parents' personal property.<br>
<br>In autumn 1712 Queen Anne appointed Hamilton to be her ambassador to France, and on 26 October conferred upon him the Order of the Garter. This alarmed the whigs, who feared that he was being sent to negotiate the succession of Prince James Francis Edward Stuart to the British throne, but instead of carrying out his plans and going to Paris at once, Hamilton delayed his departure at the last moment and on 13 November encountered Lord Mohun at the law courts. Mohun was drunk, they quarrelled violently, and the following day Mohun sent him a message challenging him to a duel. The duke accepted. Accompanied by his illegitimate son, seventeen-year-old Charles Hamilton, he left his St James's Square house between seven and eight o'clock on the morning of 15 November 1712. He and Mohun met in Hyde Park. The duke had been involved in many duels in the past but he was fifty-four now, stout and out of condition, and his opponent was a much younger man with an unsavoury reputation for violence. The signal was given. Fighting with his sword in his left hand, for he was ambidextrous, the duke wounded Mohun fatally in the chest. Even as Mohun fell dying he managed to slash at his adversary's unprotected right arm, severing an artery. The duke staggered away, collapsed against a tree, and died there a few moments later. His furious friends declared that the fatal blow had been struck, not by Mohun himself, but by his second, General George MacCartney. Excited pamphleteers elaborated on the murder theory, MacCartney fled, sightseers flocked to Hyde Park to carry away as macabre souvenirs fragments of the tree where the duke had died, and Thackeray later used the duel in his novel <span class="italic">Henry Esmond</span>. The death of the duke was no mere fiction, of course, but a dreadful reality for his family. His widow shed not a single tear but stormed and raged against her dead husband as well as against Mohun and MacCartney, while Duchess Anne sat motionless in her chair in Hamilton Palace, overwhelmed by the tragedy of her son's wasted life. Hamilton was buried in Hamilton parish church. MacCartney was eventually tried for murder and acquitted, but there is little doubt that he had played a sinister part in the whole affair, fanning the flames of Mohun's hatred of Hamilton.<br>
<br>Lively and engaging, a lover of fine art, and an enthusiastic Francophile, James Hamilton might have had a very different career had he not been weighed down by his devoted parents' demands on him. It was their tragedy and his that, unable to live up to their expectations, he took refuge in subterfuge and evasion, told people whatever they wanted to hear, and was all too easily led into an extravagant and profligate way of life by his self-seeking friends. Swift thought him &#145;a worthy good-natured person, very generous but of a middle understanding&#146;, Macky described him as &#145;brave in person, with a rough air of boldness; of good sense, very forward and hot for what he undertakes, ambitious and haughty, a violent enemy, supposed to have thoughts towards the crown of England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 17.252), and Gilbert Burnet remarked, &#145;I am sorry I cannot say so much good of him as I could wish, and I had too much kindness for him to say any evil without necessity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 6.130). &#145;He has ben&#146;, Duchess Anne had said sadly, &#145;many a sore hart both to his father and me&#146;  (Atholl MS 45, V, 122).<br>
