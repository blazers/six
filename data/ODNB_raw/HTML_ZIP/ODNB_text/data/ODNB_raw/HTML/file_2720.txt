<span class="headword">Blunt,  John Henry</span>  (1823&#150;1884), <span class="occ">ecclesiastical historian and theological writer</span>, was born at Chelsea on 25 August 1823, where he was educated in a private school. For some years after leaving school he was a manufacturing chemist, but in 1850 he entered University College, Durham, intending ordination in the Church of England. In 1852 he became licentiate in theology; he was ordained deacon in 1852 and priest in 1855. In 1855 he became an MA of Durham. After filling a number of curacies he was appointed in 1868 vicar of Kennington, near Oxford, by the warden and fellows of All Souls College. In 1873 he was presented by W. E. Gladstone with the crown living of Beverston in Gloucestershire, which he retained until his death. In June 1882 his university made him a doctor of divinity.<br>
<br>In his earlier years Blunt was a constant contributor to church reviews and magazines, and the author of many pamphlets and sermons. In 1855 his first volume, <span class="italic">Atonement</span>, was published. He afterwards became a voluminous writer in the fields of theology and ecclesiastical history. His theological dictionaries collected much valuable matter in a convenient form. His <span class="italic">Annotated Book of Common Prayer</span>, which went through many editions, is still of some value. <span class="italic">The Reformation of the Church of England</span> (1868) was republished in a variety of formats. It reflects his high-church views. His <span class="italic">Directorium pastorale</span> (1864) and his <span class="italic">Book of Church Law</span> (1872) were both standard works for the late Victorian church.<br>
<br>Blunt was a man of great mental and physical energy, and his passion for literary work in all probability hastened his death. He died rather suddenly at 47 St Stephen's Avenue, Shepherd's Bush, London, on 11 April 1884 (Good Friday), and was buried in St Mary's church cemetery, Battersea. At the time of his death he was working on <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia of Religion</span>, published posthumously (1884), and a dictionary of religion, completed by William Bentham (1887).<br>
