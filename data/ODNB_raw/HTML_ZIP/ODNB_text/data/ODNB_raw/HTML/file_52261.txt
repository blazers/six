<span class="headword">Olney,  Sarah  Allen</span>  (1842&#150;1915), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was born at Saltash, Cornwall, on 12 May 1842, the daughter of Henry Allen Olney, solicitor, and his wife, Jane Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Carpenter, who became the proprietress of a successful private school in the west of England. She had at least three sisters and two brothers. She spent much of her early life abroad, studying in Italy, France, and Germany, and became an excellent linguist. On returning to England she passed the higher local examinations and the external LLA examination of the University of St Andrews. In 1879 she became assistant mistress at the Girls' Public Day School Company (GPDSC) School at St John's Wood, where her sister Rebecca Allen Olney (1846/7&#150;1927) was headmistress. The company appointed her the first headmistress of Blackheath high school, which opened in 1880 with sixty-eight pupils, a figure which was to quadruple during her period of office. She taught both mathematics and English, encouraging an enthusiasm for Shakespeare and Milton. While she ensured that academic standards were high (girls won scholarships at Oxford and Cambridge), her ideas of a rounded education included an insistence on neatness, and she instilled a certain feminine style and elegance among her pupils, whose social skills she carefully scrutinized. Both she and her sister were among the signatories to the petition to the House of Lords in 1885 in favour of the <span class="roman">Women's Suffrage Bill</span>.<br>
<br>In 1886 Sarah Allen Olney resigned from Blackheath and with her sister, who also gave up her headship, set up a private school, The Elms, at Hampstead, which met a demand among better-off parents for a more socially exclusive type of school. The success of this venture, which had about 100 pupils, both day girls and boarders, illustrated the continuing vitality of privately run schools for girls at the end of the century, despite the challenge from the movement which backed public day schools for girls. Indeed, the new school caused defections from the St John's Wood School (renamed South Hampstead high school), alienating the Allen Olney sisters from the friendship of the GPDSC. In July 1894 Sarah Allen Olney gave evidence on behalf of the Private Schools Association to the royal commission on secondary education (the Bryce commission), having visited sixty-nine such schools in twenty-nine towns to gather information. She cited the views of parents who considered that schools made dependent on public provision and subject to state control &#145;would entail the loss of the originality, vitality, and stimulating force of schools carried on by private enterprise&#146;  (&#145;Royal commission on secondary education&#146;, 15.1). In describing her own school, she emphasized the high standards which were maintained by entering girls for the Cambridge local and London matriculation examinations, but pointed out that the wealthier class of parents remained &#145;much averse to allowing their daughters to work for examinations&#146;  (ibid.). She was personally a strong supporter of teacher registration.<br>
<br>After their retirement the Allen Olney sisters divided their time between their home at 18 Buckland Crescent, Hampstead, and travels abroad. Sarah Allen Olney, who never married, died at Ormea, Cuneo, Italy, on 10 September 1915.<br>
