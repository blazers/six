<span class="headword">Munro <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em> Munro-Ashman]</span>,  Anna Gillies Macdonald</span>  (1881&#150;1962), <span class="occ">campaigner for women's suffrage and magistrate</span>, was born at 32 Gladstone Street, Glasgow, on 4 October 1881, the elder daughter of Evan Macdonald Munro (<i>c</i>.1854&#150;1913), schoolmaster of Edinburgh, and his wife, Margaret Ann MacVean (1858&#150;1892) of Glengilp, Knapdale, Argyll. The family lived in Edinburgh until the death of Anna's mother in 1892, when Anna, with her sister, Eva, was taken to live at Venturefair House, Townhill, Dunfermline, the home of Revd Jacob Primmer, a Church of Scotland minister whose wife was Evan Munro's sister.<br>
<br>As a young woman Anna Munro became involved in social work among the working classes in London through the Wesleyan Methodist Sisters of the People, which she joined because she admired their socialist ideals rather than out of religious conviction. It is ironic that when she later became president of this movement her duties included conducting services of worship, as she had all but abandoned any church connection on moving south. It was while working in London's East End that she became aware of the activities of the women's suffrage movement. She joined the Women's Social and Political Union and founded its Dunfermline branch in 1906. She later followed her friend Teresa Billington-Greig into the Women's Freedom League (WFL), becoming her private secretary in 1907. In January 1908 she was imprisoned in Holloway for six weeks for her part in demonstrations outside the home of the cabinet minister Richard Haldane. From 1908 to 1912 she served as organizing secretary for the Women's Freedom League Scottish council. She helped organize an annual holiday campaign, aimed at reaching the Glasgow workers as they enjoyed their summer holidays on the Clyde coast. Setting up summer headquarters of the WFL in Rothesay on the island of Bute, they then held meetings at Dunoon, Kirn, and Largs. She also helped organize the 1911 census protest, whereby members of the WFL encouraged women to refuse to participate in the census&#151;on the principle of &#145;no taxation without representation&#146;. In 1912 Anna Munro was one of four members of the WFL who marched the entire route of the Women's Freedom League Edinburgh&#150;London march. She addressed the rallies in Edinburgh and London at both ends of the route.<br>
<br>In addition to her Scottish campaigning, Anna Munro also travelled in rural areas of England in a horse-drawn caravan, conducting open-air meetings from the tailboard. She apparently displayed great eloquence, speaking entirely without notes, and addressing large gatherings. She was a tall, elegant, attractive woman, and was apparently admired by many of the men who attended the meetings, although she made it her policy not to reply to any letters she received from men. However, following one of her meetings at Thatcham, near Reading, she received a letter from Sidney Ashman, who had been present at the meeting with his sisters. She agreed to meet, mistakenly thinking that &#145;Sidney&#146; was one of the sisters whom she had spoken to at the meeting. Romance blossomed, and the couple were married on 4 April 1913 at Wandsworth register office, London. They set up home in the Reading area, where Sidney was beginning to build up a business in road haulage. Shortly after their marriage Anna Munro was imprisoned for her part in holding an illegal suffrage meeting in Hyde Park. Their two children, a son and a daughter, were born while they were living in their first home at Park Farm, Thatcham. They lived at Aldermaston, from 1923 until 1929 when they bought their own home, Venturefair, at Padworth, near Reading. Throughout her married life Anna Munro continued to campaign for women's rights, remaining active in the WFL right up until its disbanding in 1961. Although she and her husband had adopted the surname Munro-Ashman on their marriage, Anna continued to be known as Anna Munro in all her WFL activities. This was a conscious choice, made so as not to jeopardize her husband's growing business. She also chose not to stand for parliament on the grounds that it might interfere with her husband's business, and because it would mean her being away from her children too much. Although she was a dedicated socialist, she seems to have had the ability to hold her socialist views comfortably alongside her upper-middle-class standing. She was not on visiting terms with the local &#145;gentry&#146;, and was much more comfortable in the company of the working-class people of Beenham, a mining village near Reading, among whom she campaigned during elections, taking them to the polls in her Daimler motor car. One of her greatest rivals was J. H. Benyan of Englefield Manor, a leading local landowner, who publicly opposed her being made a magistrate. He is reported to have said that this would happen only &#145;over his dead body&#146;, and she was not in fact appointed a magistrate until after his death in 1935. She served as a magistrate until the late 1950s, retiring from the bench only when she was forced to do so because of hearing difficulties.<br>
<br>Anna Munro was a supporter of the temperance movement and president of the National British Total Abstinence Movement, and her parties were noted for the non-alcoholic cocktails which she very expertly created. In later life she served on various local committees, and as both chairman and president of the local Labour Party. She also campaigned against compulsory vaccination. Her own children had not been vaccinated because she was opposed, not to vaccination itself, but to compulsion in any form. She encouraged her own children in their chosen careers, her son as a doctor and her daughter as an almoner at the local hospital. On 11 September 1962 Anna Munro suffered a heart attack and died that day at her home at Venturefair, Padworth. Having left instructions in her will, she was cremated at Reading crematorium. She was survived by her husband.<br>
