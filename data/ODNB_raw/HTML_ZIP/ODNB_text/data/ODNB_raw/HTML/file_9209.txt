<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Faulknor,  Robert</span>  (1763&#150;1795), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born in Northampton, the eldest son of Captain Robert Faulknor and Elizabeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Ashe). Faulknor was the fifth generation of his family to serve in the Royal Navy. His father commanded the <i>Bellona</i> (74 guns) during the Seven Years' War and captured the French <i>Courageux</i> (74 guns) in 1761 after an action lasting 55 minutes; his grandfather was Captain Samuel Faulknor of the <i>Victory</i>, which was lost with all hands on the Casqueds rocks on 5 October 1744; his great-grandfather was Captain William Faulknor, who was lieutenant-governor of Greenwich Hospital at his death in 1725. Faulknor's uncle, Captain Jonathan Faulknor, commanded the <i>Victory</i> under Admiral Keppel in the action off Ushant on 27 July 1778, and his first cousin Jonathan Faulknor died as rear-admiral of the red in 1809.<br>
<br>Faulknor's family moved to Dijon, France, where his father died on 9 May 1769. Elizabeth Faulknor returned with the children to Northampton where the two sons were placed at a grammar school. Faulknor was entered at the Royal Naval Academy, Portsmouth, in 1774 and completed his term there in March 1777. He joined the <i>Isis</i> (50 guns), commanded by the Hon. William Cornwallis on the North American station, and followed him to the <i>Bristol</i> (50 guns) and then the <i>Lion</i> (64 guns), serving in several engagements between 1779 and 1780.<br>
<br>Between December 1780 and March 1783 Faulknor served in the <i>Princess Royal</i> (98 guns) and <i>Britannia</i> (98 guns), winning the praise of Rear-Admiral Sir Joshua Rowley, who considered him &#145;a young man of great merit&#146;  (Ralfe, 310). In March 1783, at the end of the American War of Independence, the <i>Britannia</i> was paid off but Faulknor, one of a small number of officers employed during the years of peace, was appointed to the sloop <i>Merlin</i> and then, in December 1783, to the <i>Daphne</i> (20 guns).<br>
<br>During the Nootka Sound crisis in May 1790 he was appointed to serve in the <i>Impregnable</i> (98 guns). Six months later he was promoted commander, but he had to wait until April 1791 to be given his first command, the fireship <i>Pluto</i>, which he retained until September 1791. He then remained on half pay until June 1793 when, Britain being at war with France, he was given the sloop <i>Zebra</i> cruising in the English Channel. Shortly after, following his mother's lobbying of Lord Chatham, the <i>Zebra</i> was attached to Sir John Jervis's expedition to the West Indies. In February 1794 during the attack on Martinique, the <i>Zebra</i> and the <i>Asia</i> (64 guns) were ordered to anchor close under the walls of Fort St Louis to cover an attack by troops and seamen in smaller craft under the direct command of Captains Riou and Nugent. The <i>Asia</i> failed to reach her allotted position but Faulknor, taking the <i>Zebra</i> in close to the fort, personally led his men in scaling the walls. During this he experienced a lucky escape when a wooden cartouche box strapped to his waist was struck by grapeshot leaving him unharmed. Although the fort had probably already been entered by the force under Riou and Nugent, Faulknor's action was witnessed by Jervis who publicly praised him and promoted him captain of the frigate <i>Rose</i>. Several months later Faulknor was given the heavier frigate <i>Blanche</i> (32 guns), and the expedition moved to attack the island of Guadeloupe. On 21 April, while leading a party of his seamen in the attack on Fort Fleur d'Ep&eacute;e, he was attacked by two French soldiers, lost his sword, and was knocked to the ground, but he was rescued by his own men.<br>
<br>Known for being &#145;fiery, fierce, and ungoverned in his passions&#146;, a weakness which even he had to admit to, Faulknor wrote on one occasion of his own &#145;unfortunate rashness and impetuosity&#146; (Gilpin, 113; Ralfe, 3.314). During the attack on Guadeloupe, Faulknor became involved in an angry altercation with an engineer who was critical of the battery erected by men under his command. During the course of this exchange a quartermaster of the <i>Boyne</i> (98 guns), Jervis's flagship, made some form of contemptuous comment and Faulknor ran him through with his sword, killing him instantly. The seamen working on the battery promptly refused to serve under him and a mutiny was averted only by the intercession of other officers. Faulknor was immediately court martialled.<br>
<br>While maintaining that he had been provoked Faulknor was, nevertheless, remorseful. Waiting for his court martial he wrote to Lieutenant Hill of the <i>Zebra</i> that his concern was<blockquote>less for my own fate, than that of being accessory to the death of any human being not the natural enemy of myself or my country &hellip; the hasty and sudden punishment I unhappily inflicted on the spot will be a source of lasting affliction to my mind. (Ralfe, 3.314)</blockquote>Although acquitted by the court martial his remaining days were troubled. He became morose and his crew claimed that he was restless, pacing his cabin during the night.In December 1794 the <i>Blanche</i> was detached to cruise off the French-held island of Desirade. On 4 January 1795 the crew of the <i>Blanche</i> discovered the French frigate <i>Pique</i> off Pointe &agrave; Pitre, Guadeloupe. Although it appeared initially that the French ship was trying to avoid an action, the two ships came to close engagement in the early hours of 5 January. After an hour and three-quarters the <i>Pique</i> ran her bow on board the <i>Blanche</i>, from which position she could bring virtually none of her guns to bear on the English frigate which had by this time lost her main and mizen masts. Faulknor and members of his crew quickly lashed the French ship's bowsprit to the remains of the <i>Blanche</i>'s main mast to prevent the <i>Pique</i> from manoeuvring. Although wounded, Faulknor continued to direct the action until killed by two musket shot. Two hours later the <i>Pique</i> surrendered to the <i>Blanche</i>, now commanded by Lieutenant Frederick Watkins. Faulknor was buried the day after his death on the Isles des Saintes. Following the news of Faulknor's death a memorial was erected in St Paul's Cathedral, London.<br>
