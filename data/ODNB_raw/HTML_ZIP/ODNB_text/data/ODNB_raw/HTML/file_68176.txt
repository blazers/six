<span class="headword">Lancaster <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Rawlinson]</span>,  Lydia</span>  (1683&#150;1761), <span class="occ">Quaker minister</span>, was born on 8 March 1683 at Graithwaite, Lancashire, the seventh of the eight children of Thomas Rawlinson (<i>d</i>. 1689) and Dorothy (1644&#150;1737), only daughter of Thomas Hutton of Rampside. Brought up in a Quaker family Lydia described herself as one drawn to thoughts of God from infancy. When she was about seven years old she was moved to floods of tears by the ministry of a visiting Friend, and from the age of fourteen she struggled with the conviction that she was being called to be a minister herself. She resisted this calling for ten years&#151;a period which her contemporaries saw approvingly as a time when she grew in wisdom and experience but which she herself remembered as a &#145;long howling wilderness&#146; of unfaithfulness  (<span class="italic">Extracts from the Letters</span>).<br>
<br>Soon after the beginning of her ministry, in 1708, Lydia began to travel, at first to local meetings and then, in 1710, as far as London. In 1712 she went to Ireland, in 1717 to Scotland, and in 1718 she visited America in the company of her brother Abraham's wife, Elizabeth Beck Rawlinson (1670&#150;1750), and Thomas Chalkley, among several others. Lydia's travels, however, although undertaken under a sense of religious duty, were, as she says herself, &#145;sometimes pretty trying, not having such care taken at home in my absence as might have been desired&#146;  (<span class="italic">Extracts from the Letters</span>). She had married, on 21 January 1707, Bryan Lancaster (1686&#150;1747), a tanner of Kendal. There were no children of the marriage and there are hints in contemporary records of sorrows and affliction, some of it possibly financial, brought upon Lydia by her &#145;nearest temporal connexion&#146;, her husband  (testimony to Lydia Lancaster from Lancaster monthly meeting, 1762, Lancs. RO, Preston). Bryan Lancaster's name is conspicuous in its absence from Quaker records. In 1729 Lydia moved with her aged mother to Colthouse, near Hawkshead, a small rural settlement next to a Quaker meeting-house, but there is no mention of her husband on the removal certificate. Her mother died in 1737, and by 1743 Lydia was evidently living at Colthouse with her husband, who died in 1747.<br>
<br>Lydia Lancaster's ministry was generally acknowledged to be expressive and powerful but her experience gave her another dimension for &#145;being instructed in sorrow she was favoured with a sympathizing heart and knew how to partake in the affliction of others&#146;  (testimony to Lydia Lancaster from Lancaster monthly meeting, 1762, Lancs. RO, Preston). Throughout her ministry Lydia was a staunch supporter of Quaker women's meetings for business at local level. In 1746 she put her name to a petition aimed at extending them to national level, although this was not accepted and no such body was set up until 1784. Lydia was not concerned with the equality of women as such but that they might be encouraged to take up their religious duties as much as the men were. In her local meetings Lydia, drawing on her own experience, was both stern and encouraging, &#145;particularly to the timorous and backward&#146;  (ibid.). She is remembered as always bidding farewell with a sort of blessing to those women who made the effort to come to women's meetings, and she continued to attend meetings herself right up to her last days.<br>
<br>At the end of her life Lydia lived in Lancaster, free from financial worries and, she says, &#145;mostly alone, for that is what I most delight in and have done most of my time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Extracts from the Letters</span>). She still travelled in the ministry, taking long journeys in 1749 and in 1754. In 1760 she and Grace Chamber travelled together to Welsh yearly meeting, to Bath, Bristol, and to London. Lydia died on 30 May 1761 at Lancaster and was buried there in the Quaker burial-ground. Though she published nothing in her lifetime her influence continued. Many years after her death, in 1840, her family descendant and namesake, Lydia Ann Barclay, edited and published a selection of extracts from her letters, feeling that they might be of use to future generations.<br>
