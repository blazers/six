<span class="headword">Piatkoff <span class="st"> [Piaktow]</span>, Peter</span> <span class="st"> [<em>nicknamed </em>Peter the Painter]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1910), <span class="occ">revolutionary</span>, is the most celebrated, but not necessarily the most important, of a group of eastern European revolutionary immigrants who briefly startled Britain and the world with a series of violent crimes in London in 1909&#150;11, culminating in the &#145;siege of Sidney Street&#146;, where two of them met their deaths in a house fire after a gun battle with police. His notoriety arose from his mysterious escape during these events, and the alliteration of his popular nickname, Peter the Painter. To this day, however, no one can be certain who he was (he used numerous aliases, including Schtern, Straume, Makharov, Dudkin, and various alternative spellings of these), how long he lived in Britain&#151;it may have been only a couple of months&#151;and what he was doing among the other refugees: whether he was their leader, just a follower, a genuine revolutionary, a mere criminal, or a tsarist police spy. Doubts have even been expressed as to whether he existed at all. None of the following biographical &#145;facts&#146; about him, therefore, is altogether reliable.<br>
<br>One version has him born in the northern Russian city of Pskov on 20 June 1883, but not under that name (which is originally Polish). The contemporary Russian authorities claimed he was really Evan Evanovitch Jakle. Another version claims he was born on 19 July 1883 in the district of Goldingen (Kuldiga), in the province of Courland in (Russian) Latvia, where both accounts agree he was raised on a farm. In 1905 he was accused of complicity in the Russian revolution of that year, and arrested by the tsarist police, but escaped. After living in several European countries, including a short period studying medicine and then painting doors in Marseilles, he arrived in England in October 1910, immediately settling among the Latvian &eacute;migr&eacute; community in London's East End. He was also an amateur artist.<br>
<br>Two months later, on 16 December 1910, came the event that brought his fame. A group of his Latvian comrades attempted a raid on a jeweller's shop in Houndsditch, supposedly for political motives (&#145;appropriation&#146;). They were surprised by the police, and in the course of their getaway shot and killed three of them. This followed a similar incident in Tottenham in January 1909, when a policeman and a boy had been murdered by two other Latvian desperadoes, Jacob Lepidus and Paul Hefeld. It was the use of guns that made these incidents particularly shocking; decent English burglars apparently never used them. These events also came at a time of almost unrestricted immigration of Jewish refugees into Britain (though neither Peter nor any of his male associates was Jewish), stirring up a nativist backlash in the East End in particular; and of uneasiness about foreign socialism and anarchism (the two ideologies were often confused) more generally. After the Houndsditch fiasco the robbers went on the run. One of them, <a href="#cosubject_93675">George Gardstein [<i>see below</i>]</a>, accidentally shot by one of his own colleagues, died shortly afterwards. Some others barricaded themselves in no. 100 Sidney Street, off the Commercial Road in Stepney, in the East End of London, where they were besieged by armed police and a detachment of Scots Guards. After a long and dramatic exchange of fire between them on 3&#150;4 January, attended at one point by the home secretary, Winston Churchill, the house caught fire. When the flames were quenched the charred bodies of two of the gang, <a href="#cosubject_93676">Sokolow</a> and <a href="#cosubject_93677">Svaars [<i>see below</i>]</a>, were found in the ruins.<br>
<br>Peter's part in these events is unclear. He was probably not present at the Houndsditch robbery. Some authorities have him masterminding the plot none the less, partly because his room was used as a meeting place for the gang, and partly because he looked a higher class of foreigner than the others, and so more capable of plotting. His landlady described him as &#145;quite a gentleman&#146;. This comes over in the &#145;wanted&#146; notice that was issued for him later, which makes him look like Napoleon III; those of the others make them look like thugs. There is no firm evidence for this, however, and other accounts have him playing a very minor role, such as the contact with the &#145;fence&#146;&#151;possibly Leon Beron, who two weeks later (31 December) was found murdered on Clapham Common with the letter &#145;S&#146; cut into each of his cheeks. Another refugee called Stinie Morrison was convicted of that, but there are doubts over his guilt.<br>
<br>A third possibility is that Peter was a tsarist agent, planted in London in order to provoke the Latvians into an atrocity that would force the British government to rethink its policy of toleration for refugees. There is no evidence for this hypothesis either, but it was given credence by his utter disappearance after these events, aided, some suspected, by the British police. Stories proliferated about his fate. Some have him fleeing abroad a couple of days after the Houndsditch affair. (There was no firm sighting of him after 18 December 1910.) Others place him in 100 Sidney Street until the very last moment, when he tunnelled through a wall into an adjoining house, whence he melted into the crowd of onlookers and then got away. For years afterwards people reported spotting him as far apart as Winnipeg in Canada, Perth in Australia, and back in Russia&#151;working for the post-1917 Cheka (or secret police). None of these is reliable.<br>
<br>There is no doubt, however, about either the involvement or the ultimate fate of the three men who died. <a name="cosubject_93675"></a><span class="headword">George Gardstein</span>  (1885?&#150;1910)<span class="occ"></span> was probably the leader of the gang (his name too has many variants and alternatives, including Garstin, Poloski, Poolka, Morountzeff, Mourimitz, Maurivitz, Morintz, Morin, and Levi). He was another Russian, born around 1885, who started as a social democrat but then turned to anarchism. He was accused of involvement in murderous terrorist acts in Warsaw in 1905. When he arrived in England is unclear; in 1910 he had lodgings at 44 Gold Street, using the name P. Morin. He was responsible for acquiring a metal-cutting tool for use in the robbery, aided by the Italian anarchist Errico Malatesta. After sustaining gunshot wounds in the Houndsditch raid he was carried by his accomplices back to Peter's lodgings at 59 Grove Street, where he died from his injuries on 17 December 1910.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_93676"></a><span class="headword">William <span class="st"> [Joseph]</span> Sokolow</span>  (1885?&#150;1911), also known as Marx, was a <span class="occ">watchmaker</span> by trade. About the same age as Gardstein, he was also born in Russia, but was politically active in Riga (Latvia), where he was arrested on suspicion of murder and robbery in 1905. Again, when he escaped to England is unclear. He may have been responsible for shooting one of the policemen during the Houndsditch raid, after which he took refuge in the lodgings of his friend Betsy Gershon at 100 Sidney Street, where he died in the fire on 4 January 1911. He was buried in unconsecrated ground at the City of London cemetery, Ilford, Essex.<br>
<br>We know a little more about <a name="cosubject_93677"></a><span class="headword">Fritz Svaars</span>  (1882<span class="mult">x</span>5&#150;1911)<span class="occ"></span>, who was also known as Peter Trokhimchik, Karl Dumnek, Louis Lambert, and Adolf Brown, and by other aliases. A native of Libau (Liep&#257;ja) in Latvia, he was aged between twenty-five and twenty-seven (accounts differ) in 1910. He was another who was arrested for terrorist offences in Riga in 1905 and on two occasions later, but escaped each time (Russian prison security was clearly not all it might have been), spent a period as a sailor, and found time to carry out some robberies in the United States&#151;the American police put a reward of $2000 on his head&#151;before arriving in the East End in June 1910 and taking lodgings with Sokolow at 29 Great Garden Street. He had a wife and family in Latvia, whom he hoped eventually to take to Australia, but while in London became the lover of a Russian-Jewish immigrant from Kiev, Luba Milstein (1890/91&#150;1973), who worked as a dressmaker. From November 1910 he shared lodgings with Peter at 59 Grove Street. Svaars's death in the fire did not douse rumours that he too might have been a tsarist <i>agent provocateur</i>; but as these mainly came from his alienated cousin <a href="#cosubject_93678">Jacob Peters [<i>see below</i>]</a>, they should be treated sceptically. Like Sokolow, Svaars was buried at Ilford. After his death Milstein gave birth to their son.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_93678"></a><span class="headword">Jacob Peters</span>  (1886&#150;1938)<span class="occ"></span>, also known as Colnin, and variants, did not die during the course of these events, but he was probably the most historically significant of the group. The cousin of Fritz Svaars, he was born in Courland in 1886, the son of Christopher Peters, a farm labourer. Moving to Riga, where he joined the Latvian Social Democratic Party, he was arrested for revolutionary activities in 1905, tortured in captivity (apparently his fingernails were torn out), then tried and acquitted on murder charges that may have been trumped up. He arrived in England via Germany and Denmark in October 1909, worked as a tailor's presser, and became secretary of his party's London branch. He was involved in the Houndsditch robbery, and may have shot one or more of the policemen, but was surprisingly acquitted of all charges at his trial in early May 1911&#151;an outcome which has been attributed to the ineffective handling of the prosecution case by Archibald Bodkin. Remaining in England, he worked in a tailor's shop in the Holloway Road and married, on 9 September 1916, (Harriett Naomi) May Freeman (1893/4&#150;1942), daughter of William Freeman, like Jacob's father a farm labourer. They lived at 18 Canonbury Street, Islington, and had had a daughter in 1913. He established the Latvian Social Democratic Bolshevik Foreign Bureau in London. The revolution of February 1917 drew him back to Russia, where he became a member of the military revolutionary committee of the Petrograd soviet during the revolution of October 1917; he was one of the Bolshevik captors of the British diplomat Robert Bruce Lockhart. In 1919&#150;20 he helped organize the dreaded Cheka, becoming known as the Executioner. His wife and daughter went to join him in Russia in 1921, but found that he had obtained a divorce and married a Russian woman. Peters fell victim to Stalin's purges: arrested in December 1937, he is believed to have been executed in 1938.<br>
<br>A number of women were involved in these events, and have become part of the legend. <a name="cosubject_93679"></a><span class="headword">Lena <span class="st"> [Nina]</span> Vassileva <span class="st"> [Vasilyevna]</span></span>  (1887/8&#150;1963)<span class="occ"></span>, aged twenty-three in 1911 and described as a tailoress and cigarette maker, came from Yekaterinoslav in south Russia; her father was reputed to be a chef at the imperial palace in St Petersburg. When and why she came to England is unknown. She worked in a cigarette factory, lodged with Svaars, Sokolow, and Peters at Great Garden Street, and became Gardstein's lover. After the robbery she was discovered destroying documents; she was tried with Peters in May 1911, found guilty, and sentenced to two years' imprisonment. The jury urged that she should not be deported to Russia, as she would be executed there. She was released on 20 June 1911, when the court of criminal appeal decided that there was insufficient evidence to link her with the Houndsditch break-in. The authorities therefore failed to convict anyone for the robbery or siege. She continued to live in the East End until her death, at St Bartholomew's Hospital, Smithfield, London, on 24 February 1963.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_93680"></a><span class="headword">(Sara) Rosie Trassjonsky <span class="st"> [Selinsky]</span></span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1885)<span class="occ"></span>, was born in Chinik, Grodnow, Russia, to a Jewish family, and arrived in London around August 1910. She had a deformity which gave her the appearance of a hunchback. She is supposed to have been Peter Piatkoff's girlfriend. She tended the dying Gardstein in Peter's room; afterwards she was arrested, but acquitted of complicity in the robbery at a preliminary legal hearing in early March. The stress of the whole affair, however, affected her mind, and in April 1911 she was committed to Colney Hatch lunatic asylum. In June 1911, following a summons on behalf of the London county council that she be &#145;deported as an alien lunatic in receipt of poor relief&#146;, a magistrate made an order recommending her deportation  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 June 1911, 3). It is not known whether this was carried out, or when she died.<br>
<br>If the object of all this was to provoke Britain into toughening her asylum laws, it did not work. The political backlash&#151;&#145;Oo let 'em in?&#146;, words apparently shouted at Churchill&#151;soon subsided, ineffective against the much more powerful British sense of pride in a policy of toleration that had a long tradition, and had only been slightly dented by a new <span class="roman">&#145;Alien Act&#146;</span> in 1905: the first for fifty-five years that enabled governments to ban or expel immigrants at all. The legislation was used very sparingly by the Liberal government of the day, and never against political refugees, who were expressly exempted from it. An immigrant only had to claim political persecution to be allowed in automatically. Extradition treaties similarly exempted political offenders, even proven assassins and terrorists. This was one reason why the police of the time were keen to paint the Houndsditch gang as &#145;ordinary&#146; criminals, and not genuine ideologues: it meant that they had a better chance of getting rid of them if they wanted to. It was also designed to undermine any public sympathy that might be created for them by their image as torture victims of the hated Russian secret police. For many people that went a long way to excusing them. As a result, Churchill was able to resist calls for tougher laws quite easily. &#145;I must say&#146;, wrote Rodolf Rocker, another anarchist refugee, &#145;that in any other country the consequences would have been more serious&#146;  (Fishman, 293).<br>
<br>In the end the main legacy of these people was the myth they created: one of a number of violent ones that the East End has always delighted in (such as Jack the Ripper and the Kray brothers), spiced up in this instance by anti-tsarism, and the success of Peter the Painter&#151;something of a Scarlet Pimpernel figure&#151;in making fools of the despised British police. The episode became the subject of a number of novels, and of at least two feature films: Alfred Hitchcock's <span class="italic">The Man Who Knew Too Much</span> (1934; re-made 1956), and Robert S. Baker and Monty Berman's <span class="italic">The Siege of Sidney Street</span> (1960). These all perpetuated the main features of the myth. Most of the facts of the case, however, are still disputed.<br>
