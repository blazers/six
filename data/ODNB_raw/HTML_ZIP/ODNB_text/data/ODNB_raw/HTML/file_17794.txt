<span class="headword">Maguire,  Robert</span>  (1826&#150;1890), <span class="occ">religious controversialist</span>, was born in Dublin on 3 March 1826, the son of William Maguire of Dublin, inspector of taxes there. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA in 1847, MA in 1855, and BD and DD in 1877. In 1849 he was ordained to the curacy of St Nicholas's parish, Cork. In 1852, in the wake of the controversy over the <span class="roman">Ecclesiastical Titles Act</span>, he moved to London and became clerical secretary to the Islington Protestant Institute, which had for its object &#145;the awakening of Protestant Christians to the progress of Popery&#146;. Maguire's efforts increased the number of members from 600 to 1400. In a controversy with Frederick Oakeley, Roman Catholic priest of Islington, and his schoolmaster, William Weale, Maguire published <span class="italic">The Early Irish Church Independent of Rome till <span class="smallcap">A.D.</span> 1172</span> (1853), which had a large sale.<br>
<br>In July 1856 Maguire was elected Sunday afternoon lecturer at St Luke's, Old Street, and in the following October perpetual curate of St James's, Clerkenwell, one of the few livings in which the parishioners themselves had the right of presentation. His election led to legal proceedings, and he was not inducted until 3 May 1857. While at Clerkenwell he soon became popular as a preacher and lecturer. His extensive writings in the 1850s were highly controversial, disputing the claims of Roman Catholics and Tractarians alike, but he also distinguished himself in 1859 during a debate at Exeter Hall with J. B. Langley of the National Sunday League. In 1864 he was appointed morning lecturer at St Swithin's, Cannon Street. After the Fenian explosion at Clerkenwell (13 December 1867) Maguire was appointed chairman of the relief committee, raising more than &pound;10,000 for the victims. In 1875, on Disraeli's recommendation, he was presented to the rectory of St Olave, Southwark. His later writings were more expository and devotional. His editions of Bunyan's <span class="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</span> (1859) and <span class="italic">The Holy War</span> (1863) were very popular, the former being translated into German. His first wife, Effie, died on 13 June 1864, and he married on 5 August 1869 Margaret Mary, daughter of Edward Erastus Deacon, barrister. Maguire died at 6 Lesmore Road, Eastbourne, Sussex, on 3 September 1890, and was survived by his wife.<br>
