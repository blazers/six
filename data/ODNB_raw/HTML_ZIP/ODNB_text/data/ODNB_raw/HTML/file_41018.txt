<span class="headword">Garcke,  Sidney Emile</span>  (1885&#150;1948), <span class="occ">road transport administrator</span>, was born on 6 January 1885 at 52 Bassein Park Road, Shepherd's Bush, London, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41019/', "Emile Oscar Garcke (1856&#150;1930)")</script>, founder of the British Electric Traction company, and his wife, Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Withers. He attended the University of London before starting work with BET. He was invited to join the board in 1907 and in 1908 he married Clare Lorraine. They had at least one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>BET interests in the west midlands, where they owned or operated numerous tramways, included a bus company in Birmingham which had been experimenting with motors. Garcke was sent to help deal with the problems of running buses in a big city, and when it was decided to revert to horse-drawn transport he persuaded his board to let him transfer the motor vehicles to a less demanding area. In due course this led to the formation of the East Kent Road Car Company, and, more importantly, to the system of &#145;area agreements&#146;, designed to avoid competition, which Garcke negotiated with Walter Wolsey of Thomas Tilling. These agreements generated a closer working relationship, and Garcke became chairman of the joint holding company, Tilling and British Automobile Traction, formed in 1928. His relationship with Sir J. F. Heaton, the chairman of Tillings, was an uneasy one; none the less he supported Heaton's settlement with the railway companies, which prevented them from acquiring control of the major British bus operators.<br>
<br>Garcke was a member of the first council of the Institute of Transport, founded in 1919, and was awarded the institute's Road Transport (Passenger) medal in 1923. He was also a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. He unsuccessfully contested the Kingswinford division of Staffordshire as a Conservative in the general election of 1929. In line with BET policy, he served from time to time as chairman or director of several of the company's bus operating subsidiaries. In 1943 he joined the board of Dennis Brothers, bus and coach manufacturers, becoming chairman in 1945. When H. C. Drayton succeeded R. J. Howley as chairman of BET, Garcke retired from the board.<br>
<br>Garcke played a significant part in the establishment of the motor bus industry, and is said to have remarked that whereas his father laid down tram lines, he was responsible for digging them up, as BET moved from electric traction to the internal combustion engine. He was made a CBE in 1941 in recognition of his contribution to the establishment of the bus industry, to which he bequeathed the system of agreed territorial monopolies which the leading companies have sought to maintain ever since, with varying degrees of success. He died at his home, Felhurst, Grand Avenue, Hove, Sussex, on 3 October 1948.<br>
