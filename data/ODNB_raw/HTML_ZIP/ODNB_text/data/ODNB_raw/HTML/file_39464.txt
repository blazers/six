<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Shaw,  (George William) Hudson</span>  (1859&#150;1944), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and public lecturer</span>, was born on 6 August 1859 at 2 Spencer Villas, Francis Street, Potter Newton, Leeds, first child of Edward Walker Shaw (1824&#150;1871), civil engineer, and Margaret Helen Hudson (1833&#150;1913). Shaw's father died young, leaving the family in difficulties. When his mother, now remarried, emigrated to Australia, a wealthy aunt became his guardian and sent him to Bradford grammar school and then to university. He went up to Oxford in 1879 under the non-collegiate scheme, and was soon captured by Balliol. He won the Stanhope prize (1882), was president of the union (Hilary term 1883), and enjoyed sports, but failed to shine in his modern history final examinations.<br>
<br>After graduation Shaw was again saved from Australia, this time by an anonymous benefactor (later revealed to be Bolton King), whose support allowed him to undertake ordination in the Church of England. He began to prepare for ordination in 1884, and he also impetuously married Edith Emma Hirst on 1 January; a son was born that year. In some poverty himself, Shaw was burning to serve the urban poor. In 1886 Michael Sadler persuaded him that a travelling lectureship under the Oxford University extension scheme would satisfy his vocation. For much of his twenty-five years with the extension scheme he would combine lecturing with the charge of small parishes.<br>
<br>The Revd Hudson Shaw was a short, stocky man, forthright in expressing himself. A compelling orator, he spoke with a somewhat harsh and identifiably northern accent. As a history lecturer he was popular everywhere, but his special value to Oxford was his appeal to working men. They flocked to follow even such topics as the history of Florence and Venice; lecture courses on his favourite English social reformers, above all John Ruskin, brought him what Sadler called an &#145;almost mystical&#146; reputation in the industrial north  (Royden, 34). Shaw had a special feeling for south Lancashire; his commitment to extension work at centres such as those in Ancoats (which he called Ancoats University), Bolton, and Oldham was repaid in the adulation of his student followers.<br>
<br>In 1890 Balliol elected Shaw to a fellowship in recognition of his services as a public lecturer. Three years later came the first of several highly acclaimed tours in the eastern United States. Beneath this outward success private problems multiplied. On 21 April 1890, after the untimely death of his first wife in 1888, he had married a withdrawn and unworldly cousin, Agnes Josephine (Effie) Ringrose. It was another impulsive act, intended to give Effie and her widowed mother some security. After three years Effie bore a son and the unwanted experience plunged her into mental invalidism. Shaw's own vulnerability had been evident for some years: he suffered from mysterious physical complaints and often after the end of the lecture season succumbed to severe depression. In 1901 he met the much younger <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35861/', "Maude Royden (1876&#150;1956)")</script>; their relationship, initially a pastoral prop to her career in social work, soon turned into a chaste love affair and contributed its own rewards and difficulties. In 1905 Shaw's elder son abandoned an Oxford education and fled to America; there the wayward Arnold became agent to J. C. Powys, lecturer and author, and predeceased his father. Arnold's less mercurial half-brother, Bernard, qualified as an engineer, but was killed in the First World War.<br>
<br>The success of the Workers' Educational Association (WEA) was the turning point of Shaw's public career. Originating in 1903 within the extension movement, it embraced him as its first chairman; by 1908, however, it had assumed a stance of virtual opposition under a younger and more politically acute leadership. Shaw preached that the fate of democracy lay not with working-class assertiveness, but with religion and education, church and university, but his somewhat moralizing and patriarchal liberalism seemed outmoded; he was no longer honoured as a prophet. He did subsequently support the WEA, but off the record continued to insist that it should have remained a subordinate part of the extension system.<br>
<br>Perhaps it was no coincidence that in 1909 Shaw suffered his worst breakdown. He never properly resumed lecturing. In 1912, at a ceremony marking his final departure from Oxford, Sadler recalled building up the extension scheme and his friend's place as &#145;the keystone to the arch&#146;  (<span class="italic">University Extension Bulletin</span> 13, 4&#150;5). Out of sheer loyalty Shaw had previously refused offers of more lucrative or sedate employment elsewhere; now influential friends settled the matter by obtaining for him the crown living of St Botolph without Bishopgate in the City of London. At St Botolph, Shaw did not serve quietly; seemingly he could not help taking a combative stand in the diocese, and his efforts to have Maude Royden preach from his pulpit led to unseemly confrontations with the bishop of London. Eventually he turned to less provocative causes, particularly Albert Schweitzer's hospital at Lambarene, but, sick and isolated from fellow clergy, he was becoming an absentee rector. He retired in 1935.<br>
<br>Effie Shaw died in February 1944. On 2 October of that year Hudson Shaw was married to Maude Royden; on 30 November, at their home, the Old Cottage, Bayley's Hill, Sevenoaks, Kent, he too died. He was buried in the Weald churchyard, Sevenoaks on 4 December. He had long outlived his own reputation. There was a brief posthumous revival of celebrity with the publication of <span class="italic">A Threefold Cord</span> (1947), Royden's candid portrayal of her relationship with the Shaws.<br>
<br>Shaw's publications were scanty and always incidental to some other purpose. His Stanhope prize essay was published. The syllabuses he wrote were routinely issued by Oxford and the American Society for Extension of University Teaching. His syllabus on Ruskin, written in a blaze of energy shortly after the master's death, assumed the proportions of a small textbook. The occasional sermon or lecture delivered at extension summer meetings, invariably revealing of the author's passions, appeared in print.<br>
