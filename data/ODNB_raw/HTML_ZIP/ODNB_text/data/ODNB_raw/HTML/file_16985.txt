<span class="headword">Longfield,  Mountifort</span>  (1802&#150;1884), <span class="occ">jurist and economist</span>, was born at Church Hill, Desertserges, near Bandon, co. Cork, the second son of the Revd Mountifort Longfield, vicar of Desertserges, and his wife, Grace, daughter of William Lysaght of Fort William and Mount North, near Mallow in co. Cork. He had two brothers and three sisters. After first being educated by Thomas Dix Hincks, probably at Fermoy Academy, Longfield entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1818 and graduated as moderator and gold medallist in natural science in 1823. He was elected a fellow of the college in 1825, but as jurist, for at that time the college regulations required all fellows to be in holy orders, except five, of whom one was elected as &#145;medicus&#146;, the other four as jurists. Called to the Irish bar in 1828, Longfield proceeded to the degree of MA in the same year and to LLD in 1831. In that year he lectured in the law school of Trinity College as deputy for the professor of feudal and English law, Philip Crampton. In 1832 a new professorship of political economy was established in Trinity College; Longfield applied for it and was appointed, on the results of an examination set by Richard Whately, archbishop of Dublin, who funded the chair. This appointment was tenable for five years only, and in 1834 Longfield, who had drawn attention to himself by his zeal and ability as a teacher of law when serving as deputy for Crampton, was appointed to succeed him in the regius professorship of feudal and English law, resigning his fellowship in order to do so. He held this office for the rest of his life, although from 1871 he employed a deputy to carry out its duties.<br>
<br>Longfield had already earned a high reputation as a real property lawyer when he became a QC in 1842. When the <span class="roman">Incumbered Estates Act</span> became law in 1849 he was selected to be one of the three commissioners by whom it was administered. With the extension of the act to unincumbered estates in 1858, the commission was replaced by the landed estates court, of which Longfield then became a judge. He continued to sit in this court until 1867, when he retired and was sworn of the Irish privy council.<br>
<br>In his later years Longfield maintained an interest in economic and social questions. In 1847 he became one of the founder members of the Dublin Statistical Society (later renamed the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland) and in 1863 succeeded Whately as its second president. He was also active in the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science and gave the opening address as president of its social economy section at its Dublin meeting in 1861. Longfield was appointed a commissioner of Irish national education in 1853, and also gave much voluntary service to the Church of Ireland, acting as an assessor to its general synod on several occasions after its disestablishment in 1869; at that period he was also instrumental in developing new methods for financing the church. His experience in the landed estates court led Longfield to recognize the need to strengthen the legal rights of tenants to compensation for improvements. In an essay published by the Cobden Club in 1870 he outlined what came to be known as the &#145;Longfield scheme of parliamentary tenant-right&#146;, which attracted wide interest and support, but which Gladstone felt unable to incorporate into his first <span class="roman">Irish Land Bill</span>.<br>
<br>In 1845 Longfield married Elizabeth Penelope, daughter of Andrew Armstrong, of Kilsharvan, co. Meath; there were no children of the marriage, and she died in 1882. Longfield died at his home, 47 Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin, on 21 November 1884, and was probably buried in the city's Mount Jerome cemetery. Although he had virtually retired from public life a decade earlier, at his death he was still known and highly regarded as a learned and impartial judge, a man of vigorous and independent mind, with more liberal views on social and economic issues than might have been expected in his day from a long-established expert in real property law.<br>
<br>Longfield's former position as the first incumbent of the first chair of political economy to be founded in Ireland received little or no mention in his obituaries&#151;not surprisingly, for he had left the chair almost half a century earlier; it was a forgotten interlude in a long and distinguished legal career. Almost twenty years later, in 1903, the American economist E. R. A. Seligman published two articles in the <span class="italic">Economic Journal</span>, &#145;On some neglected British economists&#146;, which drew attention, among others, to the work of Longfield as evidenced in the three volumes which he published during his tenure of the Whately chair: <span class="italic">Lectures on Political Economy</span>, <span class="italic">Four Lectures on Poor Laws</span>, and <span class="italic">Three Lectures on Commerce and one on Absenteeism</span> (1834&#150;5). Since then it has come to be recognized by economists throughout the world that in these lectures Longfield produced work of outstanding originality, and his posthumous reputation in economics eclipsed that which he had in his own lifetime as a jurist. In 1833 when Longfield gave his first lectures on political economy, which (as his appointment required) he afterwards published, the theories of value and distribution developed by David Ricardo and propagated by James Mill dominated the subject. Having shown that he understood these theories better than many contemporary interpreters, Longfield rejected them and presented his own analysis in five lectures. His explanation of value emphasized market prices rather than natural values, stressing utility as of at least equal importance with labour costs in determining value. His theory of distribution was perhaps his most original contribution: in it he put forward a theory of profits as determined by the marginal productivity of physical capital and of wages as determined, not by subsistence, but by the specific productivity of each labourer.<br>
<br>Unlike Ricardo, Longfield took an optimistic view of the long-term prospects for economic development, and predicted that the effects of increased population would be offset by technical progress in agriculture and that increased capital accumulation, while lowering profits, would improve the productivity of labour and allow real wages to rise, with consequent economic and social benefits. While his two other published courses of lectures dealt primarily with current Irish economic problems, in his <span class="italic">Lectures on Commerce</span> he again showed his originality as an economic theorist, specifically treating the case of trade in more than two commodities and explaining the causes of international specialization in terms of variations in factor endowments. He thus foreshadowed developments in this field which were not generally known and accepted until almost a century later. Longfield's ideas in political economy had considerable influence on his successors in the Whately chair&#151;indeed he really founded a distinctive &#145;Trinity College Dublin school of value theory&#146;&#151;but until Seligman wrote they remained completely unknown to economists outside Ireland, and this state of affairs Longfield himself appears never to have sought to alter.<br>
