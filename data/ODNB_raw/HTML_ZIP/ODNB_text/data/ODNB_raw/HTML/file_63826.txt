<span class="headword">Mason,  Stewart Carlton</span>  (1906&#150;1983), <span class="occ">educational administrator</span>, was born on 28 February 1906 in St John's Wood, London, the only child of Carlton Willicomb Mason, musician, and his wife, Alys Kastor. Educated at Uppingham School, but denied family support because of his desire to teach, he was able to take up an exhibition at Worcester College, Oxford, where he read Spanish and French, only through the generosity of a wealthy patron. Accordingly, after graduating in 1928 he taught first at Berkhamsted (1930&#150;31) and was then a modern languages master at Harrow School under Cyril Norwood, whom he greatly admired. In 1937, momentously as it turned out, he joined the inspectorate and as an inspector in Cambridgeshire was deeply impressed by the work of the chief education officer, Henry Morris.<br>
<br>In 1941 during wartime secondment to the Admiralty, a first marriage having been dissolved, Mason married Ruth Elizabeth Wise; they had four sons. In 1944 he went as inspector to Leicestershire, from where his family originated and where the chief education officer, Sir William Brockington, was in his seventies. Seizing his opportunity, there being no deputy director, he virtually compiled single-handedly the authority's development plan for implementing the 1944 <span class="roman">Education Act</span> and duly succeeded Brockington in 1947.<br>
<br>Something of a mystic, Mason was convinced that &#145;all the fates&#146; had determined this almost unprecedented career reorientation and he eagerly set about guiding this nominally conservative but largely non-political shire authority through the immediate post-war years. During his first decade, supported by the paternal Sir Robert Martin, chairman of both the county council and the education committee, he laid the foundations of what became a vast collection of fine art for the embellishment of schools, while, at the same time, designating strategically placed &#145;community colleges&#146; on the Cambridgeshire model. Simultaneously, he supported his music adviser, Eric Pinkett, in the creation of the internationally renowned Leicestershire Schools Symphony Orchestra. He encouraged the primary schools, meanwhile, to adopt the progressive practices which had enchanted him at the village school at Quy in Morris's Cambridgeshire&#151;practices which attracted many American observers to Leicestershire in the 1960s.<br>
<br>Hitherto Mason had unquestioningly supported the tripartite structure of post-1944 universal secondary education but, gradually, he became disturbed by the injustices that eleven-plus grammar-school selection could impose on families, including his own. Accordingly, in March 1957, after much pondering, he persuaded the authority to accept a &#145;limited experiment&#146; in a two-tier system of secondary education which, consisting of high schools for those aged eleven to fourteen and upper (grammar) schools for those aged fourteen to eighteen, not only eliminated the dreaded selection examination but also effectively guaranteed access to grammar schools to all children whose parents promised to keep them there until the age of sixteen. By 1969 the &#145;Mason plan&#146;, described in his booklet <span class="italic">The Leicestershire Experiment and Plan</span> (1960; rev. edn, 1964), covered the whole county&#151;the first shire authority to turn comprehensive; it was Mason's finest achievement.<br>
<br>In 1959, with Leicestershire's reputation as a patron of fine art fully established, Mason was invited to serve on the National Advisory Council on Art Education and virtually began a second career. First as vice-chairman (1961&#150;70) and later chairman (1970&#150;74) of the National Council for Diplomas in Art and Design he not only presided over the reorganization of art education but, believing, as an employer of artists in a qualification-conscious world, that artists needed degrees, led it against virulent opposition into the mainstream of higher education via the Council for National Academic Awards. He also served on both the advisory council of the Victoria and Albert Museum (1961&#150;73) and the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries. Similarly, at regional level he chaired the visual arts panels of both the East Midlands Arts Association (1971&#150;5) and, having retired to Suffolk, the Eastern Arts Association (1972&#150;80), where he converted the local Tolly Cobbold art exhibition into a national competition for contemporary artists.<br>
<br>Significant though these activities were, however, Mason's greatest and most lasting achievement outside the education field was made as a trustee of the Tate Gallery (1966&#150;73), when in the summer of 1972, salvaging a previously abandoned scheme, he engineered the establishment of the Institute of Contemporary Prints at the Tate under the Sir Robert McAlpine Trust. Through the generosity of donors and Mason's assiduity as curator (1972&#150;6) in approaching artists, some 3000 prints were acquired which the gallery could never have afforded to buy. Whereas print acquisition hitherto had been the province of the Victoria and Albert and British museums, the Tate now had its own core collection; a fitting memorial to Mason's work on behalf of both artists and the art-loving public.<br>
<br>Mason died of spinal cancer at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London, on 23 November 1983, survived by his wife. He was fortunate to have been ideally placed to exploit the massive post-war educational expansion at a time when local education authorities provided scope for people with vision. Not everything he touched turned to gold, however, and in the harsher climate of subsequent decades some of the innovations in both primary and secondary schools that he encouraged may have appeared controversial and even ill-advised. There was also a protracted dispute between himself and Robin Pedley, a lecturer in education at Leicester University, over the origins of the idea of the two-tier system of secondary school reorganization. His adversarial style, moreover, did not always endear him to those in high places, which possibly explains why he was made CBE in 1968 but he never received the coveted knighthood. Nevertheless, there is no denying the contemporary national impact of the developments that he fostered across a remarkably broad front. Many had been pioneered elsewhere, but his bringing them together in a single authority designates him as one of the great directors of education of the post-war era.<br>
