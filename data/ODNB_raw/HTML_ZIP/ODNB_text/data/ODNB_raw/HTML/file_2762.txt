</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boehm, Sir  (Joseph) Edgar</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Josef Erasmus B&ouml;hm]</span>, baronet  (1834&#150;1890), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 4 July 1834 in Vienna, the youngest son of Josef Daniel B&ouml;hm (1794&#150;1865), court medallist, engraver, and director of the imperial mint at Vienna, and his wife, Maria Aloysia Lussman (1797&#150;1839), daughter of Dominic Lussman. Josef Daniel B&ouml;hm was a Hungarian who settled in Vienna in 1813 and formed a major art collection which served as a basis for his son's education. From 1848 to 1851 the younger Boehm attended Leigh's art academy (later Heatherley's) in London and then returned to Vienna, where he studied medal design and modelling at the Akademie der Bildenden K&uuml;nste. After visiting Italy he worked in Paris from 1859 to 1862, where he was influenced by contemporary realist practice.<br>
<br>Boehm's marriage in 1860 to (Louisa) Frances (Fanny) Boteler (<i>c</i>.1835/6&#150;1890) was one reason for his decision to settle in London in 1862. Another was the dreary and insular state of English sculpture. Boehm could capitalize on his recent Parisian experience and thus increase his impact. In his sculpture he avoided anachronistic classical idealism. He believed that art which is &#145;not of its time is failing in the all essential element of common sense&#146;  (Meynell, 336). He was equally confident whether carving in marble or modelling in terracotta, a material more common in French sculpture than in English. From the outset critical opinion was divided about Boehm. Francis Turner Palgrave, for example, commented that his &#145;showy work delighted the vulgar&#146;  (Stocker, &#145;Sculpture&#146;, 92), a sentiment echoed by Thomas Woolner, who used his influence to delay Boehm's election to the Royal Academy.<br>
<br>Boehm's first work to attract major interest was a statuette of William Makepeace Thackeray (1864, National Portrait Gallery, London). Its success led to an edition of seventy plaster casts. Anthony Trollope admired Boehm's rendition of &#145;the figure of the man exactly as he used to stand before us&#146;  (Stocker, <span class="italic">Royalist and Realist</span>, 63). Thackeray's waistcoat, watch strap and glasses, and his inelegant pose&#151;with hands in pockets&#151;immediately distinguished Boehm's realism from the neo-classical mainstream. Boehm also sculpted equestrian statuettes, a genre which as a passionate horseman naturally attracted him. His eye for a horse is evident in bronzes of racehorses and hunters, for example <span class="italic">Johnny Armstrong</span> (1863, National Horseracing Museum, Newmarket). Sporting sculpture has been so neglected by art historians that Boehm's introduction of it, under the influence of the French <i>animalier</i> Pierre-Jules M&egrave;ne, has passed virtually unnoticed. It was, however, admired by contemporary critics, including Edmund Gosse, who noted &#145;the refinement and delicacy&#146; of his horses  (ibid., 307).<br>
<br>Portrait busts form the majority of Boehm's works. In their quantity and quality they reveal how he effectively cornered the market of the famous and the fashionable. His sitters included James Whistler, John Ruskin, Thomas Huxley, Herbert Spencer, and Franz Liszt. His busts reflect his diversity, ranging from the vivid alertness of <span class="italic">W. E. Gladstone</span> (1879, plaster, Victoria and Albert Museum, London) to the sensuously neo-rococo <span class="italic">Adeline, Countess of Cardigan</span> (1869, marble, Deene Park, Northamptonshire). Adeline reappeared as a loving widow in Boehm's monument to James Thomas Brudenell, seventh earl of Cardigan (1868&#150;70, St Peter's, Deene, Northamptonshire). Some of Boehm's fifty-seven documented church monuments, such as those in Westminster Abbey to Benjamin Disraeli (1881&#150;3) and Arthur Stanley (1882&#150;4), are highly convincing as portraiture. He collaborated with Philip Webb and Edward Burne-Jones in the charming, lyrical relief commemorating Charles and Mary Howard (1879&#150;81, Lanercost Priory, Cumberland).<br>
<br>Boehm's work attracted Queen Victoria's attention in 1869. His talents, together with her regard for his &#145;very gentleman-like, clever and excessively modest&#146; personality  (Stocker, <span class="italic">Royalist and Realist</span>, 80), led to an association which lasted until his death in 1890. In all, he received over forty royal commissions, and he gave lessons to Princess Louise, Queen Victoria's daughter. In 1880 he was appointed sculptor-in-ordinary to the queen and in 1889 was created a baronet. Royal patronage made other sculptors jealous but it was a mixed blessing for Boehm. Some commissions were straightforward, such as the life-sized marble figure of the queen's collie, <span class="italic">Noble</span> (1884, the Royal Collection). Queen Victoria's main concern with more ambitious sculptures was for precise renderings of uniform, costume, and likeness. Gosse's gibe that Boehm &#145;sacrificed humanity to buttons&#146; thus rings true  (ibid., 239). His talent for creating what his patrons wanted, his efficiency in delivering the goods, and his gentlemanly inability to refuse a commission meant that he sacrificed imaginative creativity. Among his finest works for Queen Victoria are the effigies of her father, the duke of Kent (1872&#150;4), and her daughter Princess Alice (1878&#150;80), both in the Royal Mausoleum, Frogmore, Windsor. The former is swathed in an impressive marble cloak, while the latter pays moving tribute to Alice's maternal affection.<br>
<br>Boehm's most famous work is his life-sized statue of Thomas Carlyle (1875; bronze version of 1882, Chelsea Embankment Gardens, London). A close friendship arose between sculptor and sitter, which led to Boehm's undertaking research for Carlyle on portraits of John Knox. There are close links between the <span class="italic">Carlyle</span> and Jean-Antoine Houdon's <span class="italic">Voltaire</span> (1778, Com&eacute;die-Fran&ccedil;aise, Paris), a work which Boehm greatly admired. In the portrait Boehm fulfils his belief in treating modern dress <i>con amore</i>, while his truthfulness to life and dislike of classical affectation made him the perfect artist for Carlyle. The statue was unanimously praised at the 1875 Royal Academy show and won a silver medal at the Paris Universal Exhibition in 1878.<br>
<br>Other notable examples of Boehm's fifty-seven known public monuments include the craggy bronze of Field Marshal Sir John Fox Burgoyne (1877, Waterloo Place, London) and the carefully researched historical portraits of John Bunyan (1872&#150;4, St Peter's Green, Bedford) and Sir Francis Drake (1882&#150;3, Tavistock, Devon; 1882&#150;4, The Hoe, Plymouth). One of his most ambitious monuments, to the duke of Wellington (1884&#150;8, Hyde Park Corner, London), was less successful. The central group of Wellington and his mount, Copenhagen, fails to cohere with the corner figures of Napoleonic war veterans, added by the memorial committee as an afterthought. Even less satisfactory was his effigy of Queen Victoria for the jubilee coinage (1887). During its protracted history, changes in design were repeatedly made but the outcome pleased no one, least of all Boehm. With its small crown threatening to slip from the queen's head, the effigy was ridiculed by cartoonists and public alike and was soon replaced.<br>
<br>These failures lowered Boehm's reputation, and his consequent distress probably hastened his death. His late work, however, did not necessarily deteriorate in quality. An example is <span class="italic">Cupid and the Mermaid</span> (1889), which exists in two versions at Woburn Abbey, Bedfordshire&#151;a large outdoor statue and a bronze statuette. The latter, a lithe, lively work, beautifully cast by the Compagnie des Bronzes in Brussels, shows Boehm's willingness to learn from the New Sculpture movement of Alfred Gilbert and Edward Onslow Ford. Like much of the New Sculpture, it was also influenced by Italian Renaissance bronzes.<br>
<br>Boehm died suddenly on 12 December 1890 at his home, The Avenue, 76 Fulham Road, London, and was buried on 20 December in St Paul's Cathedral. Frances Boehm had died four months earlier. Boehm was survived by three daughters and a natural son. Princess Louise's presence in Boehm's studio when he died provoked press gossip and subsequent, unsubstantiated speculation upon their possible sexual relationship. All accounts agree about Alfred Gilbert's central role in comforting Princess Louise in her distress. What followed was significant: the rapid advancement of Gilbert's career as a sculptor of royalty and the destruction of almost all Boehm's papers.<br>
<br>Boehm's talented studio assistants included Gilbert, Alfred Drury, &Eacute;douard Lant&eacute;ri, and Robert Glassby. Even allowing for their role, they cannot fully account for the huge total of 360 different works documented in Boehm's name. A collection of 156 letters addressed to Boehm (Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles) which escaped destruction reflects his significance in the Victorian art world. He was frequently consulted by his friend Frederic Leighton, and also by George Frederic Watts, for help with their respective sculptural projects. In turn, he took advice from Gilbert about themes, interpretations, and techniques. Boehm admired Auguste Rodin, another correspondent, and helped secure acceptance of <span class="italic">The Age of Bronze</span> at the 1884 Royal Academy show. Despite his delayed election as an associate member of the academy (1878), Boehm was loyal to the institution and lectured there as well as serving as a visitor at the schools. He was elected to full membership in 1881. In addition, he was elected to the Rome and Florence academies in 1880 and 1881 respectively, and to the Akademie der Bildenden K&uuml;nste in Vienna in 1890.<br>
<br>Boehm's art-historical neglect was caused by factors beyond the critical unfashionability of Victorian sculpture. The more innovative talents behind the New Sculpture obscured his own achievements. He was the victim of his own success and consistency. Burne-Jones noted how &#145;it sickened him to let &hellip; life go by and be so little of what he could have been as an artist&#146;  (Stocker, <span class="italic">Royalist and Realist</span>, 281). When Boehm did attempt imaginative, large-scale works, they were less convincing than his portraiture. Gosse observed that <span class="italic">St George and the Dragon</span> (1885, Swanston Street, Melbourne, Australia) lacked &#145;not size, for it is enormous, but largeness, which is quite another thing&#146;  (ibid., 290). In his important essay &#145;The New Sculpture, 1879&#150;1894&#146; Gosse portrayed Boehm as a dominating personality who sought to monopolize prestigious sculptural commissions and to exclude rivals. This, however, is contradicted by his kindness towards and encouragement of other, younger sculptors. An example was his role in securing Gilbert the commission for the Shaftesbury memorial (1886&#150;93) in Piccadilly Circus, London. While he cannot be given the traditional art-historical accolade of a &#145;genius&#146;, Boehm was the most popular, prolific, and successful sculptor of late nineteenth-century England. Examples of his work are in the Royal Collection; the Tate collection; the National Portrait Gallery and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London; St George's Chapel, Windsor; and Westminster Abbey and St Paul's Cathedral, London.<br>
