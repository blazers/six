<span class="headword">Hodgson,  William Ballantyne</span>  (1815&#150;1880), <span class="occ">educationist and economist</span>, the elder son of William Hodgson, printer, friend, and works manager of James Ballantyne (1772&#150;1833), was born at 23 Gardner's Crescent, Edinburgh, on 6 October 1815. He had a brother and a half-sister on his mother's side. His father intended him for the law and, after attending Edinburgh high school from 1823, he worked for a short time in a lawyer's office. But he loathed legal study, preferring to pursue the literary interests he had developed as an omnivorous reader since early childhood. In 1829, when just turned fourteen, he entered Edinburgh University, but did not graduate. Breaking away from the strict Calvinism of his upbringing, he became strongly influenced by the phrenological writings of George Combe, which offered a more hopeful message of human perfectibility and opened up possibilities of rational progress. With Combe and others he helped to found, in 1832, the Edinburgh Ethical Society for the Practical Application of Phrenology, which later became the Edinburgh Philosophical Association, and published articles in the <span class="italic">Phrenological Journal</span> between 1836 and 1841. He lectured in literature, education, and phrenology in the towns of Fife, publishing in 1837 an address on education delivered to the Edinburgh Association of the Working Classes.<br>
<br>On 1 June 1839 Hodgson was appointed secretary to the mechanics' institute in Liverpool. As well as providing popular evening lectures, the Liverpool institute had a library, sculpture gallery, and two non-sectarian schools (catering mainly for middle-class pupils), to which Hodgson added a third, for girls, in 1844. Under him the institute, which was one of the most innovative educational institutions of its time, flourished. On 11 March 1846 he received the degree of LLD from Glasgow University. From 1847 to 1851 he was principal of Chorlton high school. In 1849 (and again in 1864&#150;6) he was a vice-president of the College of Preceptors. Shortly after his appointment at Liverpool he met and married (1841) Jane, third daughter of George Lissant Cox, of Liverpool, who lapsed into invalidity within a month of their marriage.<br>
<br>Hodgson was a strong Liberal in politics. He declined the editorship of two newspapers in Liverpool and Manchester, not wishing to abandon teaching, but was an active supporter of the Anti-Corn Law League and became associated with Cobden and Bright. He later belonged to the Financial Reform Association and the Liberation Society (which advocated church disestablishment). He mixed in Unitarian circles, admiring in particular the views of William Johnson Fox, whose works he edited (1865), and making the acquaintance of George Eliot, upon whom he practised mesmerism when she visited James Martineau's home in the Lake District in 1844. She found him a congenial companion on subsequent meetings at the home of John Chapman, the owner of the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>, to which he contributed an article on languages in the school curriculum (October 1853). In 1854 he was party to James Martineau's unsuccessful move to wrest control of the <span class="italic">Review</span> from Chapman, which led to the establishment of the rival <span class="italic">National Review</span>.<br>
<br>In 1851 Hodgson travelled abroad, partly for the sake of his wife's health, remaining in Paris from October 1851 to July 1852 before moving on to Germany and Italy. After returning to Edinburgh in 1853, he attended classes at the College of Surgeons to qualify himself for teaching physiology. He strongly believed that the laws of health, &#145;sanitary science&#146;, should be taught as part of the school curriculum; emphasizing their importance to women, he included ladies' classes in his popular lectures on the subject. Like his friend William Ellis, the promoter of secular schools, he also stressed the importance of teaching political economy, &#145;social science&#146;, insisting that all classes (and both genders) should understand the laws regulating the production and distribution of wealth. His lecture at the Royal Institution, London, was published as <span class="italic">On the Importance of the Study of Economic Science as a Branch of Education for All Classes</span> (1855) and went through three editions. He also prompted the establishment of the Edinburgh Phrenological Association in 1855. In 1858 he was appointed an assistant commissioner of inquiry into popular education, for the commission chaired by the duke of Newcastle, and produced a report on elementary schools in the south and west of London.<br>
<br>Hodgson's wife died, childless, on 1 July 1860, and he married, on 14 January 1863, Emily, second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28590/', "Sir Joshua Walmsley")</script>, the radical MP, with whom he had two sons and two daughters. From 1863 to 1868 he was examiner in political economy to London University, and was a member of the council of University College, resigning on 19 January 1867 in support of James Martineau, who had been rejected for the vacant chair of mental philosophy. Believing in the educability of the whole population, he was a strong supporter of the campaign for the higher education of women, publishing his views in <span class="italic">The Education of Girls and the Employment of Women and the Upper Classes: Two Lectures</span> (2nd edn, 1869). As early as 1848 he had pressed for the Royal Institution of Manchester to admit women to its classes. He backed Emily Davies's campaign to admit girls to Cambridge local examinations (1864), and subsequently he delivered lectures on economics to the North London Collegiate School for Ladies (whose headmistress, Frances Mary Buss, was a close associate), the Ladies' Institute at Belfast, and to ladies' classes at the Birmingham and Midland Institute. He gave evidence on women's education to the schools' inquiry commission in November 1865. He looked forward to a time when men and women students would be taught together in the same classes, and was not enthusiastic about Emily Davies's proposed college for women at Hitchin. Hodgson and his wife were members of the Married Women's Property Committee, and he belonged to the Women's Suffrage Association and the National Anti-Contagious Diseases Acts Association.<br>
<br>During the 1860s the Social Science Association provided a platform for Hodgson's views on the importance of teaching economics to schoolchildren. His 1867 critique of the narrowness of the elementary school curriculum laid down by the revised code, <span class="italic">Exaggerated Estimates of Reading and Writing as Means of Education</span>, continues to interest historians of literacy (see <span class="italic">History of Education Quarterly</span>, 26, 1986, 377&#150;93). Under the auspices of the Social Science Association he published papers under the title <span class="italic">The True Scope of Economic Science and Competition</span> (1870). By then his reproofs against strikers and trade unions rather overshadowed his original, equally important objective, to warn capitalists against the folly of speculation and &#145;panics&#146;. Although a popularizer of orthodox economics, he was not a rigid Ricardian, and his lectures were enlivened by numerous and sometimes humorous examples drawn from his vast reading. His influence was largely the result of his wide circle of friends: he produced no significant work of economic theory. In politics he remained a Liberal, though he had broken with John Bright over the American Civil War&#151;Hodgson, who feared the Americanization of British institutions, supported the Confederates&#151;and was alarmed by the 1867 <span class="roman">Reform Act</span>.<br>
<br>On 17 July 1871 the Merchant Company of Edinburgh elected him as the first holder of the newly founded chair of commercial and political economy and mercantile law at Edinburgh University. Though his lecture delivery was somewhat monotonous, he was regarded with affection by his students: they recalled his &#145;long dark hair, slight figure, and face indicating keen intellect, sensibility and humour&#146;, and his habit of wearing a black silk skull cap in classes  (<span class="italic">Life and Letters</span>, 244). On returning to Edinburgh he bought Bonaly Tower, Midlothian, a fortified tower partly rebuilt by Henry Cockburn, Lord Cockburn (1779&#150;1854), in 1838, where he liberally entertained his students (see J. Small, <span class="italic">The Castles and Mansions of the Lothians</span>, 1883). At his death his friend Professor John Stuart Blackie (1809&#150;1895) wrote <span class="italic">The Burn o'Bonaly</span>.<br>
<br>Hodgson's strong opposition to vivisection led him into controversy when a new medical school was established in the university in 1875. Education was his life's work, and much of his later activity was directed to improving the standing of teachers. He belonged to several educational associations, favoured teacher training, and advocated the founding of professorships of education. In 1875 he was made president of the Educational Institute of Scotland, and in 1880 president of the Edinburgh chamber of commerce. Hodgson, who had suffered from heart disease for many years, died of angina pectoris on 24 August 1880 while attending an educational congress in Belgium. He was buried at the Grange cemetery, Edinburgh, survived by his wife. A posthumous work, <span class="italic">Errors in the Use of English</span> (1881) arose from the project of his later years to compile an English dictionary.<br>
