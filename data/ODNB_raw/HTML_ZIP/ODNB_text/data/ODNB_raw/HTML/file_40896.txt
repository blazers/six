<span class="headword">Moriarty,  Cecil Charles Hudson</span>  (1877&#150;1958), <span class="occ">police officer</span>, was born at Tralee, co. Kerry, on 28 January 1877, the son of Thomas Alexander Moriarty, rector of Millstreet, co. Cork, in the then disestablished Church of Ireland, and his wife, Rosa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hickson. He was a grandson of Thomas Moriarty, dean of Ardfert, co. Kerry. He graduated BA (senior moderator in history, law, and political economy) at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1898, winning the Large gold medal. He entered the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) in 1899, coming first in the open examination for cadetships and officer entry. A rugby football forward, he represented Ireland against Wales at Cardiff in March 1899, when Ireland won the triple crown. He also reputedly played hockey to a good standard. On 25 April 1906 he married, at Kensington, London, Muriel Una (1881/2&#150;1965), elder daughter of George Tilson Shaen-Carter JP, of Belmullet, co. Mayo. There were three daughters of the marriage.<br>
<br>Moriarty's RIC career followed the customary pattern of the officer recruit. He became a first-class district inspector in 1902, serving variously in Derry, co. Mayo, co. Longford, co. Clare, and Queen's county, and in 1912 gained the degree of LLB from Trinity College, Dublin. In 1913 he was called to work at RIC headquarters.<br>
<br>In 1918 Moriarty was among eighty applicants for the newly established and sole post of assistant chief constable of the Birmingham city force, one of the larger English borough forces of the day but still not quite one-fifth the size of the RIC. He was one of two RIC officers among the final five candidates, the other three being military officers. Moriarty was successful and was appointed in June 1918, a particularly warm testimonial about his qualities from the RIC's inspector-general having been sent to Birmingham's chief constable, Charles Rafter (also formerly of the RIC). The decision to create the post of assistant chief constable was taken as part of a watch committee review of the organization of the force's headquarters and was supported and possibly prompted, local legend has it, by the inspector of constabulary, though not with any enthusiasm on the part of the chief constable, who had ruled alone since his appointment in 1899.<br>
<br>Circumstances after the First World War delivered to Moriarty an important responsibility for police training for which he proved especially well suited, and a responsibility moreover that had to be exercised in the new environment created by the <span class="roman">Police Act</span> 1919. At that time there were still more than 200 forces in England and Wales. Some of them were very small and few aspired to offer more than the most rudimentary training for their recruits. Often officers were in effect briefly apprenticed to older, more experienced constables, and given some class instruction based on the force's standing orders before being released to sink or swim on their own beats. The <span class="roman">Police Act</span> 1919 created more standard conditions of employment, including promotion and discipline, which moved the forces in the direction of a national police service, albeit still well short of becoming a national police force.<br>
<br>In Birmingham an authorized strength of 1431 had declined to 853 effectives by 1918 as a result of the manpower demands of the war (disregarding further temporary reductions, as officers were used even to bring in the harvests). Not only was it necessary to train recruits to fill the gaps resulting from the war and a later increase in the size of the Birmingham force's establishment to 1586 in 1921, but Birmingham's training facilities in Digbeth (later expanded under Moriarty) also gave Birmingham the capacity to train the officers of other forces, including some from abroad. By 1939, 3710 officers from 77 different English and Welsh forces had passed through Digbeth.<br>
<br>Partly perhaps because of his background in the RIC, whose strength of 10,000 was second only to that of the Metropolitan Police and which had acquired more sophisticated management than the run of forces in England and Wales, Moriarty was quick to understand what the changes of 1919 implied for the heightened professional ethic of the police. He was the guiding force behind the development of an intensive training curriculum at Digbeth, both at recruit and other, continuing, levels. The system not only paid attention to the specific police knowledge that officers needed but strove also to raise the level of general educational attainment of the men, most of whom had only an elementary education up to the age of thirteen. He insisted that the post-war legislation meant that the police was to be regarded as a profession and required commensurate training.<br>
<br>Moriarty explained his philosophy and practice in detailed articles in 1929 in the inaugural volume of the <span class="italic">Police Journal</span> and in the more popular weekly <span class="italic">Police Review</span>. However, his most significant and lasting contribution to police training and professionalization lay in his publication in the same year of <span class="italic">Police Law: an Arrangement of Law and Regulations for the Use of Police Officers</span>. While the development of modern policing had been accompanied by various attempts at primers for policemen, none had been so ambitious or thorough. Moriarty would have been familiar with his predecessors: a former RIC inspector-general, Andrew Reed, had produced <span class="italic">The Irish Constable's Guide</span> in the 1880s and Howard Vincent, the first director of criminal investigation at Scotland Yard, was responsible for the long-running <span class="italic">Police Code</span> from 1881. Both were summary, limited, and to an extent hortatory manuals of conduct, arranged alphabetically. There were also more localized initiatives based essentially on the experience of particular forces, in London reliant on internal publications like <span class="italic">Duty Hints</span> (1907), which related to the Metropolitan Police's <span class="italic">General Orders</span> and <span class="italic">Instruction Book</span>.<br>
<br>Moriarty's <span class="italic">Police Law</span> was instantly recognized as a classic. In a full-page article in the <span class="italic">Police Review</span> F. J. O. Coddington, a barrister, writer on police law, and later stipendiary magistrate in Bradford, had no doubt: &#145;This book will at once take rank as the standard textbook for the education of the Policeman.&#146; It drew on and generalized for England and Wales the experience of the Birmingham training regime in the context of the post-war police service, both to assist with training and to underpin the national police promotion system. In 1930 Moriarty followed up <span class="italic">Police Law</span> with <span class="italic">Police Procedure and Administration</span>, a work directed more towards explaining the historical and legal background to the functions of the service than to setting out the criminal law itself. <span class="italic">Questions and Answers on Police Duties</span> appeared in 1935. The final editions of all the works for which Moriarty was personally responsible&#151;including the fourteenth edition of <span class="italic">Police Law</span>&#151;were published in 1954. By then Moriarty had expanded and deepened <span class="italic">Police Law</span> and thereafter the editorship was taken over by successive chief constables until the book's last, twenty-fourth edition in 1981. For over fifty years <span class="italic">Moriarty</span> (as <span class="italic">Police Law</span> became known) was a staple of recruit training in the national system of district training centres set up after the Second World War, of which Digbeth had been a precursor.<br>
<br>Moriarty himself stayed at Birmingham, becoming chief constable in 1935 on the death (at the age of seventy-five) of his predecessor. He oversaw the expansion of the force and its facilities, and the introduction of a continuous duty system where his predecessor had adamantly favoured a split-shift system hated by the men. Moriarty also played important roles nationally. He was involved in the re-establishment of the Police Mutual Assurance Association on a sound footing as the Police Mutual Assurance Society after the crisis of 1920&#150;21, continuing as a trustee and later as a vice-president. He was the sole member not of chief-constable rank who was appointed to the ground-breaking Dixon committee on detective work and procedure, which was appointed in 1933 and reported in 1939. It led among other things to the establishment in Birmingham of one of the two national detective training schools outside London. The records show Moriarty taking a full part in the committee's work, with a knowledge of the law more than equal to that of his chief-constable colleagues and always pressing for practical solutions to problems.<br>
<br>Moriarty was appointed OBE in 1925, received the king's police medal in 1929, was advanced LLD (by Trinity College, Dublin) in 1932, and appointed CBE in 1938. Moriarty retired at the age of sixty-four in 1941, making way&#151;probably with a push from the watch committee&#151;for a much younger man to face up to the rigours of wartime policing. Continuing to update his books, he retired to Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire, where he died at his home, Albyns, Bromyard Road, on 7 April 1958. That none of Moriarty's works ever&#151;properly&#151;featured as prizes awarded to the best Birmingham performers in national promotion examinations is one thing. That nowhere in the records of the watch committee was his authorship of any of his publications ever mentioned or acknowledged seems quite another.<br>
