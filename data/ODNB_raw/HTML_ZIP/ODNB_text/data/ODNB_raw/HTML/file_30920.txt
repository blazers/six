<span class="headword">Charnley, Sir  John</span>  (1911&#150;1982), <span class="occ">orthopaedic surgeon</span>, was born on 29 August 1911 in Bury, Lancashire, the only son and elder child of Arthur Walter Charnley, pharmacist, and his wife, Lily (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Hodgson), a nurse. He was educated at Bury grammar school and Manchester University, where he graduated BSc in anatomy and physiology (1932) before entering his clinical studies. Three years later he gained his MB ChB and in 1936 he became FRCS. He held various surgical appointments at Manchester Royal Infirmary and at Salford Royal Hospital, and it was obvious that he had an outstanding future in surgery. He volunteered for service in the Royal Army Medical Corps in May 1940. After a spell as resident medical officer at the evacuation of Dunkirk he was graded as an orthopaedic surgeon and was posted to the Middle East as a major and officer in charge of no. 2 orthopaedic centre, Cairo.<br>
<br>On demobilization Charnley returned to Manchester Royal Infirmary where he was appointed assistant orthopaedic surgeon and then consultant. In 1950 he published <span class="italic">The Closed Treatment of Common Fractures</span>, a unique analysis of manipulation in the treatment of fractures, which revealed Charnley's unusual talent for drawing on engineering concepts. This work was a challenge to his colleagues and destroyed many myths and rigidly held concepts. His mechanical ideas and skills were again seen in his development of simple and direct compression arthrodesis techniques for the knee, ankle, and even hip. This resulted in another monograph, <span class="italic">Compression Arthrodesis</span> (1953). However, compression arthrodesis of the hip never became widely accepted. Recognizing this, Charnley began to work on the mobility of the hip in painful hip conditions due to arthritis. His discoveries were made possible by his outstanding ability in working with materials, his engineering techniques, and his skills at the lathe, which he utilized at his home in Hale.<br>
<br>Charnley had seemed to be a confirmed bachelor and lived with his mother, until on a ski slope in Switzerland in 1957 he met Jill Margaret Heaver, daughter of James Cedric Heaver, an officer in customs and excise. Three months later they were married. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>In 1961 Charnley established a centre for hip surgery at Wrightington Hospital, Wigan, where he had been the visiting orthopaedic surgeon. There he pioneered one of the greatest contributions to world surgery for thousands of patients. At that time very little was known about the science of biological materials and lubrication, elasticity of tissues, or the acceptance of artificial materials within bone and joint tissues. All of these were critically studied to produce the Charnley prosthesis. The prototype, which utilized Teflon plastic, was a failure, but eventually a new polyethylene material became available. At the same time Charnley designed sterile-air operating enclosures, specialized hip instruments, and total body exhaust systems within impervious gowns, all to reduce infection. Over the years he published the successes, failures, and subsequent results of his procedures. His masterly report and monograph, <span class="italic">Acrylic Cement in Orthopaedic Surgery</span>, appeared in 1970. This was followed by <span class="italic">Low Friction Arthroplasty of the Hip</span> in 1979. Orthopaedic surgeons had long been waiting for such a breakthrough, and began to flock to the hip centre in Wrightington from all over the world. Here they were welcomed and allowed to observe the master surgeon's complex operations and his techniques and methods to avoid complication and catastrophe.<br>
<br>Charnley held honorary appointments at Manchester University, in the department of mechanical engineering, and at the Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. He was given many honours and awards, among them an honorary fellowship of the British Orthopaedic Association (1981) and the Lister medal of the Royal College of Surgeons (1975). He received the honorary DSc from the University of Leeds and Queen's University, Belfast (both 1978), and the honorary MD from Liverpool (1975) and Uppsala (1977). He was appointed CBE in 1970 and became the first orthopaedic fellow of the Royal Society in 1975. In 1972 Manchester University recognized their outstanding graduate by making him professor of orthopaedic surgery, a post he held until 1976. The citizens of Bury made him a freeman of the borough in 1974, and he was knighted in 1977.<br>
<br>Charnley was a man of small stature, but had a strongly built physique, which expressed his dynamic, non-stop activity, both mental and physical. He was incisive in thought, work, and deed, and was driven not so much by compassion or ambition as by his &#145;single-minded determination to solve a problem&#146;  (Nisbet and Woodruff, 119). Charnley died in Manchester on 5 August 1982.<br>
