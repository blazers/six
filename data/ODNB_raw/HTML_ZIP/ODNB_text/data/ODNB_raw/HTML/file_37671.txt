<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lewis,  (Dominic) Bevan Wyndham</span>  (1891&#150;1969), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born Llewelyn Bevan Wyndham Lewis, on 9 March 1891 at 63 Seaforth Road, Seaforth, Litherland, Lancashire, the eldest son of David John Lewis, pharmaceutical chemist of Seaforth, and his wife, Cecelia Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mayer. He was educated at Cardiff intermediate school, where he showed academic promise, winning four distinctions in the senior honours certificate of the Central Welsh Board at seventeen. His ambition to read law at Oxford, however, was never fulfilled. He enlisted as a private in the Welsh regiment on 1 September 1914, and served with the 11th battalion (the &#145;Cardiff pals&#146;) in France, where he was shell-shocked twice, and in Macedonia, where he caught malaria. He was invalided home in 1918, and demobilized, still a private, at the time of the armistice. On 29 October 1918 he married Winifred Mary (Jane) Holland (<i>b</i>. 1893/4), daughter of David Holland, marine surveyor, of Cardiff. They had one daughter, the actress Angela Wyndham Lewis.<br>
<br>In 1919 Lewis was offered a job by R. D. Blumenfeld, editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>. For six months he was a sub-editor, but then began to write a column for the paper called &#145;By the way&#146;. He signed it Beachcomber. He thus pioneered in Britain the discursive, witty, exuberant, and surreal style of humour he bequeathed to his close friend J. B. Morton, who took the column over in 1924 and developed it through half a century into an art form. Lewis's marriage ended in 1926, and in the same year Jane married the writer J. B. Priestley. Lewis meanwhile moved on to the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, where until 1930 he wrote a column called &#145;At the Sign of the Blue Moon&#146;. His prolific imagination was never more happily displayed.<br>
<br>Lewis lived much in France, and immersed himself in its history and literature. After his first book, <span class="italic">A London Farrago</span>, appeared in 1921, he published almost annually a volume of satire or humour, but he had a parallel career as a biographer, writing vigorous and scholarly lives of writers like Fran&ccedil;ois Villon (1928), Pierre de Ronsard (1944), Fran&ccedil;ois Rabelais (1957), Moli&egrave;re (1959), and Cervantes (1962); studies of Louis XI (<span class="italic">King Spider</span>, 1930), and Charles V (<span class="italic">Emperor of the West</span>, 1932). His life of Boswell (<span class="italic">The Hooded Hawk</span>, 1946) vividly displayed his power of conjuring up the past. He had been received into the Roman Catholic church in 1921 (dropping his first name, Llewelyn, in favour of Dominic), and for all their drive and gusto, his books show a strong Catholic bias.<br>
<br>Lewis also wrote skits, burlesques, and film scenarios, and he was an inspired anthologist. Particularly amusing was <span class="italic">The Stuffed Owl</span> (1930), an anthology of bad verse he compiled with Charles Lee. On 22 July 1933 he married Dorothy Anne (<i>b</i>. 1900/01), daughter of Bertie Henry Robertson, in a civil ceremony. They had two sons. He returned to the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> from 1933 to 1936, when he joined the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> as the columnist Timothy Shy. He also wrote the &#145;Mustard and the Cress&#146; column in the <span class="italic">Sunday Referee</span> from 1930 and was a regular contributor to <span class="italic">The Tatler</span> from 1933. He was made a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1947. He collaborated with the artist Ronald Searle by writing the text for <span class="italic">The Terror of St Trinian's</span> (1952). He published his last book, on Goya, in 1968.<br>
<br>Lewis was a leading member of an influential group of Catholic writers who flourished between the wars, including Hilaire Belloc, G. K. Chesterton, J. B. Morton, Compton Mackenzie, and Evelyn Waugh. Many of them used to meet regularly at Shirreff's wine bar under Ludgate Circus where, despite a lifelong stammer, Lewis more than held his own; he was indeed described by Belloc as the wittiest man he had ever known. He described himself as &#145;impulsive, lazy, easily imposed upon, distinctly Celt, full of strong loves and hates&#146;. Among the former were wine, France, Spain, the Pyrenees, Elgar, and tradition; among the latter, financiers, socialists, bluestockings, officials, and novelty. He suffered with good humour the misfortune of sharing his name with Percy Wyndham Lewis, the Canadian artist. He was a gentle, courteous, convivial, slightly bemused romantic, born out of his time. He died in Altea, Spain, on 21 November 1969.<br>
