<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Barnes, Sir  George Reginald</span>  (1904&#150;1960), <span class="occ">radio and television director and college head</span>, was born in Byfleet, Surrey, on 13 September 1904, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53561/', "Sir Hugh Shakespear Barnes (1853&#150;1940)")</script>, lieutenant-governor of Burma, and his second wife, Edith Helen, sister of Sir Kenneth Barnes, principal of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and the actresses Irene and Violet Vanbrugh. Educated at the Royal Naval College at Osborne and Dartmouth, he was ultimately rejected for the navy because of his eyesight. But his interest in naval affairs never diminished, however varied and strong his other interests. With Commander J. H. Owen he published in 1932&#150;8 four volumes of the private papers of the fourth earl of Sandwich and he always cherished the dream of finding time to write a study of the British navy in the early nineteenth century.<br>
<br>From Dartmouth, Barnes went to King's College, Cambridge, where he obtained a second class in part one of the historical tripos (1924) and a first in part two (1925). There was some expectation that he would try for the Foreign Office but the pull of the navy proved too strong and he returned to Dartmouth for three years (1927&#150;30) as an assistant master. In 1927 Barnes married Dorothy Anne, daughter of Henry Bond, master of Trinity Hall, Cambridge (1919&#150;29); they had one son. In 1930 he went as assistant secretary to the Cambridge University Press where he developed &#145;a fine taste and a good judgement in the economics as well as the aesthetics of the trade&#146;, and revised the <span class="italic">Hand-List of Cambridge Books</span>, extending it to 1800.<br>
<br>In 1935 Barnes joined the British Broadcasting Corporation, where his strong social conscience gave an educational impetus to his work. He believed that public taste needed guiding: that it should be led, not followed. Coupled with this belief was his sense of responsibility towards listener minorities and the complex needs of each individual listener. In 1941 he was appointed director of talks in succession to Sir Richard Maconachie, under whom he had worked since Maconachie joined the corporation in 1937; in 1945 he became Maconachie's assistant controller of talks. In that year he made his first visit to the United States, from which he returned with his horizons widened and with a final access of assurance which never deserted him.<br>
<br>When the Third Programme was established in 1946 Barnes was the obvious choice to give the idea practical form. He aimed at the highest standards in both programme and performance: &#145;We shall live or die by the amount we are prepared to experiment &hellip; We will experiment with new forms of radio, new writers, new performers, and new presentations&#146;  (private information). His own lifelong devotion to music found scope which he described as &#145;vast and even thrilling&#146; in the Third Programme's long-term plan to give the finest available performances of music of every style and epoch, with special emphasis on rarely heard works of interest and beauty. Comparably large in conception was the great series of programmes entitled <span class="italic">Ideas and Beliefs of the Victorians</span> (1948).<br>
<br>In 1948 Barnes joined the BBC's board of management as director of the spoken word and in October 1950 he was appointed to the newly created post of director of television. The BBC's five-year plan to expand and develop its television service, giving priority to &#145;coverage&#146;, had been under way for a year. New transmitters were opened at Sutton Coldfield (1949) and Holme Moss (1951) and the Lime Grove Studios were taken over early in 1950. But the service was still based on Alexandra Palace and &#145;for two nightmare years&#146;, as Barnes later recorded in the <span class="italic">BBC Quarterly</span>, &#145;every piece of scenery and every property for the half-dozen different productions each day had to be transported twenty-four miles&#146;  (Barnes, 66). It was not until 1954 that concentration at Shepherd's Bush was achieved.<br>
<br>The enormous increase in range that BBC television obtained during the six years of Barnes's directorship is reflected in an increase in licences from 343,882 (1950) to 5,739,593 (1956). Among the many new ventures were the first experimental schools television programmes (May 1952); the televising of the coronation of Elizabeth II (June 1953); the first large-scale Eurovision link-up of eight countries (June 1954); the inauguration of a daily <span class="italic">News and Newsreel</span> (July 1954); and ceaseless experiment with colour television (the first colour television outside broadcast, transmitted on closed circuit to the children's hospital, Great Ormond Street, was of the coronation). In October 1953 on a visit to Lime Grove Studios the queen knighted Barnes with a sword which had been smuggled in from Buckingham Palace.<br>
<br>In 1955 the Independent Television Authority began commercial television. In the previous year Barnes had stressed the necessity of a second channel for the BBC to provide a planned alternative programme in order to cater for the varying tastes of its public; in 1956 he emphasized the need to maintain high standards and avoid the exclusive pursuit of mass popularity:<blockquote>The audience figures that are being bandied about in the fine shouting-war that is going on are not a criterion of excellence. To seek success in popularity alone is a trivial use of a great invention. Mass without mind always comes a cropper &hellip; (private information)</blockquote>In 1956 Barnes became principal of the University College of North Staffordshire, which had been unfortunate in the death of its first two principals (Lord Lindsay of Birker and Sir John Lennard-Jones) within a few years of their appointment. A similar fate was to strike Barnes, who died at Keele on 22 September 1960, after no more than four years of stimulating service to the new foundation. A memorial fund was devoted to the development and teaching of music in the university which Barnes had done much to improve. His concern was ever with quality, whether in music, the visual arts, or human relationships. From a wide circle of friends he entertained at Keele distinguished writers, politicians, painters, and scholars, whose visits greatly enriched the life of a small and relatively isolated university; and by his own diligence in accepting public engagements he sought in his turn to make Keele more widely known. A frail-looking man, he possessed great resilience and inner strength, nourished by his deep concern for the life of the chapel. His naval training imbued him with a sense of service and he devoted all his energy and practical idealism to the furtherance of the things of the mind and of the spirit that he valued.<br>
<br>At one time or another Barnes served on many bodies concerned with the interests he had at heart. They included the council of the Royal College of Art, the British Film Institute, the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries, the Council of Industrial Design, the Wedgwood Society (formed early in 1955 with Barnes as first chairman), the British Pottery Manufacturers' Federation, and the committee appointed in January 1958 by the Gulbenkian Foundation to inquire into the needs of the arts in Britain. He received the honorary degree of DCL from Durham in 1956.<br>
