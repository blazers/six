<span class="headword">Davies,  Francis</span>  (1605&#150;1675), <span class="occ">bishop of Llandaff</span>, was born on 14 March 1605 of non-gentry parentage in Glamorgan, probably in the border vale of that county. He matriculated from Jesus College, Oxford, on 10 November 1621, graduated BA on 26 February 1625, and proceeded MA on 14 March 1628. He became rector of Pen-tyrch and Radur, in his native part of Glamorgan, in 1630, and rector of Llan-gan, which he held with Llantrithyd, in 1638. He received preferment to the prebendary of St Andrews, in Llandaff Cathedral, in 1639. At some point soon after this he gave up the living of Llantrithyd. He took the degree of BD on 22 June 1640, after election to a fellowship at Jesus College.<br>
<br>As one who was making rapid progress in the Anglican hierarchy in Llandaff diocese Davies was opposed to church reforms of the 1640s, and was ejected from Pen-tyrch and Llan-gan some time between 1646 and 1650. His offence, according to his sympathizers, was having refused to accept the directory of worship produced by the presbyterian Westminster assembly. An even more compelling reason for his ejection was that he was among the Laudian clergy who had helped lead a revolt in Glamorgan in summer 1647 against the county committee of parliament. Even so, after the introduction of the <span class="roman">Act for the Propagation of the Gospel in Wales</span> in 1650 there was evidently more local sympathy towards him than towards some other Anglican ministers. He enjoyed a number of concessions: he retained the fourth part of the valuable living of Llan-gan, and the tithes there were let to his brother, Maurice Davies; and in 1655 it was ordered that even though unmarried he should receive the allowance to ejected ministers' families, known as &#145;fifths&#146;, from the vicarage of Pen-tyrch. Another clergyman brother of his, Rice Davies, received small sums from the state-controlled tithes, and occasionally officiated at Pen-tyrch using the outlawed <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. Despite threats by Major John Gawler, of the Cardiff Castle garrison, Francis Davies &#145;received the small tithe of Radur for the space of ten years without any molestation&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Walker c. 4). It was said that because of Davies's &#145;great piety, learning and excellent parts&#146;  (Jenkins, 38), his discreet benefactor during these years was Colonel Philip Jones, prominent among the lay propagators. As another way of augmenting his income during the 1650s Davies kept a school in one of the parishes where he had influence. Evidently the arrangements for his maintenance collapsed around 1656, according to Davies's nephew because Philip Jones tired of them, but more probably because Jones lived virtually continuously in London during the protectorate, and others were by then responsible for running the state church in Glamorgan. To secure an income Davies, through the good offices of friends, moved to London to become for three or four years the chaplain of Penelope, countess of Peterborough, whose husband, Henry Mordaunt, second earl of Peterborough, was a prominent royalist.<br>
<br>At the Restoration Davies was thus well placed to recover his livings. In August 1660 he petitioned for the archdeaconry of Llandaff, pleading his attempts to maintain the king's cause and the prayer book liturgy, and was supported by Gilbert Sheldon, the cleric closest to Charles II. Having been restored to his livings Davies was made archdeacon of Llandaff on 6 August 1660 and was installed in October. He took the degree of DD on 21 May 1661. A local ally of Davies's was Sir John Aubrey of Llantrithyd, a leading high-church royalist. While archdeacon he had the whip hand over ministers of the king who had ousted him in the previous decade, but was sufficiently conciliatory to offer a living to Samuel Jones of Brynllywarch, Llangynwyd, who in return propounded a series of questions to Davies on the validity of the liturgy and orders of the Anglican church. On 24 August 1667 Davies was consecrated bishop of Llandaff and gave up his other livings except a Llandaff prebendary which he held <i>in commendam</i> with the bishopric. Although well connected with the dominant party in church and state he was content to devote himself to restoring the fabric and reputation of his cathedral. He remained resident in the diocese, at Matharn, re-established the cathedral library, broken up during the Commonwealth, and installed what became the largest bell in the Llandaff bell-tower. He never married, and in his will dated 6 March 1675 disposed of a very small estate to his brother Rice and several servants, nephews, and a niece. He died on 14 March, his seventieth birthday. He was buried before the altar in his cathedral; having been long lost the gravestone came to view again after enemy bombing of Llandaff in 1941. Davies's nephew, another Francis Davies, provided John Walker with material on east Glamorgan for his 1714 martyrology, <span class="italic">The Sufferings of the Clergy</span>.<br>
