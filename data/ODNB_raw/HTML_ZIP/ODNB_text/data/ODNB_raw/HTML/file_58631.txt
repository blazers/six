<span class="headword">Smithson,  Annie Mary Patricia</span>  (1873&#150;1948), <span class="occ">author and nurse</span>, was born on 26 September 1873 at 22 Claremont Road, Sandymount, Dublin, the only child of Samuel Raynor Smithson, barrister, and his wife, Margaret Louisa Carpenter (<i>d</i>. 1917). Baptized Margaret Anne Jane, on her conversion to Catholicism in 1907 Smithson took instead the names Anne Mary Patricia. Her mother and father were first cousins and her father died when she was young. About 1881 her mother married her second husband, Peter Longshaw, who owned a chemical factory in Warrington in Lancashire. Smithson disliked her stepfather and referred to him always as Mr Longshaw. There were five children of the second marriage.<br>
<br>Smithson spent the first few years of her life living with her mother and her grandparents in Sandymount, Dublin. On her mother's remarriage the family moved first of all to Warrington, and when her stepfather's business failed they returned to live in Dublin. At this time the family were poor and rented flats at various locations around the city. They also rented a house in Bray in co. Wicklow. After her stepfather's death the family moved to Dalkey, co. Dublin. Smithson believed herself to be poorly educated. She had sporadically attended various day schools in Dublin, Warrington, and Bray, and for a brief period was also a boarder at a girls' boarding-school in West Derby. She was removed from school in Bray at the age of fifteen to take care of the children in the family.<br>
<br>Smithson had wanted to become a journalist. Her maternal aunt Susan Carpenter (<i>d</i>. 1929) had been one of the few women journalists working on London newspapers in the first decades of the twentieth century. However, Smithson instead trained as a nurse. She spent fifteen months in the Chelsea Hospital for Women in London and went to Edinburgh in October 1898 to train as a Queen Victoria jubilee nurse. She spent two years at the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh and returned to Dublin in December 1900 for six months' training as a district nurse. Her first appointment was in Portadown but she moved to the village of Millton in co. Down in September 1901 to take up duty there. Here she worked with Dr James Manton in the local dispensary. She fell in love with Manton, a married man. Deciding they had no future together, she left Millton in January 1906. Smithson remained deeply attached to Manton but, while he continued to write to her, they did not meet again. On her conversion to Catholicism Smithson burnt all of Manton's letters.<br>
<br>Smithson returned to the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh to continue her training and also worked as a night nurse in a women's hospital in Glasgow. It was while Smithson was in Glasgow that she began to attend Catholic church services. Although brought up in the Church of Ireland, she had attended services of the Plymouth Brethren in Dublin in the late 1880s. On her return to Dublin in January 1907 she continued to receive instruction in the Catholic faith from a Sister of Charity, and in March of that year she was received into the church. While Smithson gives no reason for her conversion, she appears to have been quite unhappy for a time&#151;particularly after the ending of her relationship with Manton.<br>
<br>Smithson's work as a district nurse took her to many different parts of Ireland. For a brief spell in 1913 she suffered from tuberculosis and spent some time in Peamount Hospital. She was sympathetic to the cause of Irish nationalism: she canvassed for Sinn F&eacute;in in the 1918 general election and became a member of Cumann na mBan, the women's auxiliary to the Irish Volunteers, to which group she gave lectures on first aid. She supported the republican side during the civil war and acted as a nurse to the republicans in the besieged Moran's Hotel in Dublin at the outbreak of the civil war. She was arrested and imprisoned in Mullingar for about a week while travelling to the west of Ireland to help the republicans there. Her republican sympathies led to a request that she resign from the queen's nurses committee, which she did, and she took up private nursing as a consequence. Smithson's stepsister and her family moved to Dublin in 1932 and she shared a house with them in Rathmines in Dublin until her death.<br>
<br>Smithson was elected a member of the General Nursing Council in 1924. In July 1929 she became the secretary of the Irish Nurses' Union (later the Irish Nurses' Organization). Smithson became a member of the Central Midwives' Board in 1934, and was also active on the National Council of Trained Nurses. She wrote regularly for the <span class="italic">Irish Nurses' Magazine</span> and edited the <span class="italic">Irish Nurses Union Gazette</span>. In circumstances that remain mysterious, Smithson was forced to resign from her post as secretary of the Irish Nurses' Union in 1942.<br>
<br>It is as a novelist that Smithson is best remembered. Her first book, <span class="italic">Her Irish Heritage</span>, was published in Dublin in 1917 and dedicated &#145;To the memory of the men who died, Easter 1916&#146;. In all Smithson was to publish twenty novels and two collections of short stories. Most of her novels, which are strongly nationalist, were best-sellers. Contrasts are made between Irish and English characters, with the English usually coming out worse. There are often conflicts between Catholic and protestant characters, and conversion to Catholicism is a regular feature. The plots are highly romantic and include many incidents taken from Smithson's own experiences. <span class="italic">Carmen Cavanagh</span> (1921), for instance, is the story of a district nurse in Donegal. <span class="italic">Sheila of the O'Beirnes</span> (1929) is narrated by a young girl who runs away from her mother and from her school after her mother's second marriage. In <span class="italic">The Walk of a Queen</span> (1922), a title echoing a phrase from Yeats' play <span class="italic">Cathleen ni Houlihan</span>, set in the years 1917&#150;21, the hero, who has unwittingly betrayed the cause of Ireland, substitutes himself for his twin brother and suffers the death penalty. In a number of the works children are orphaned and mothers often appear as selfish, worldly women. Her autobiography, <span class="italic">Myself and Others</span>, appeared in 1944. Smithson died of heart failure at 12 Richmond Hill, Dublin, on 21 February 1948 and was buried in Rathfarnham cemetery.<br>
