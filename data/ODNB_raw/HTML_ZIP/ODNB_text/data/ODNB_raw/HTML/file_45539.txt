<span class="headword">Gerard <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em> de Laszowska]</span>,  (Jane) Emily</span>  (1849&#150;1905), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 7 May 1849 at Chesters, Jedburgh, Roxburghshire, Scotland, the eldest daughter of Colonel Archibald Gerard (1812&#150;1880) of Rochsoles, Lanarkshire, and his wife, Euphemia Erskine (1818&#150;1870), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23895/', "Sir John Robison (1778&#150;1843)")</script>, the distinguished inventor. She was also directly descended from Gilbert Gerard (1760&#150;1815), Church of Scotland minister and theological writer, Alexander Gerard (1728&#150;1795), philosophical writer, and Archibald Alison (1757&#150;1839), Scottish Episcopalian minister and writer. Her sister <a name="cosubject_45539"></a><span class="headword">Dorothea Mary Stanislaus Gerard <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em> Longard de Longgarde]</span></span>  (1855&#150;1915), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born at New Monkland, Lanark, Scotland, on 9 August 1855. They had two other sisters and three brothers, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33376/', "General Sir Montagu Gilbert Gerard (1842&#150;1905)")</script>.<br>
<br>The family lived in Vienna from 1863 to 1866, and moved in aristocratic &eacute;migr&eacute; circles. Emily, who had been educated at home until she was fifteen, took lessons with, and became a lifelong friend of, Margarita of Parma, niece of the Bourbon pretender to the French throne and later wife of Don Carlo VII, pretender to the Spanish throne. Emily finished her education studying European languages for three years in the convent of the Sacr&eacute; Coeur at Riedenburg, near Bregenz, Austria, and Dorothea spent four years in the convent of the Sacr&eacute; Coeur in Graz. Although their family background was Scottish Episcopalian, their mother had converted to Catholicism in 1848, and both sisters were raised in that faith.<br>
<br>On 14 October 1869 Emily married Chevalier Miecislas de Laszowski (<i>d</i>. 1904), a member of an old Polish noble family and an officer in the Austrian army, and moved with him to Brzezum, in what later became Poland, where she was joined by her sisters following the death of their mother in 1870. She had two sons. Dorothea married Julius Longard de Longgarde, who eventually became a field marshal lieutenant, also in the Austrian army, in 1886. They lived in Galicia and had one daughter.<br>
<br>Despite residing in Austria and other central European countries for most of their adult lives, the sisters, who used the name Gerard professionally, became active participants in the later nineteenth-century British literary community, both independently and as collaborators. Emily Gerard wrote a number of stories for <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> (which were later reprinted in <span class="italic">Bis</span>, 1890, and <span class="italic">An Electric Shock and other Stories</span>, 1897), and reviews of contemporary French and German fiction, both for <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span> and for <span class="italic">The Times</span> (London), whose obituary notice praised her as &#145;an able critic of German literature&#146;. She began to write fiction in 1879, collaborating with her sister Dorothea on their first major work, <span class="italic">Reata</span>, about a Mexican girl adapting to European customs, which was published as a serial in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> (beginning in April 1879), as were a number of their subsequent novels. <span class="italic">Beggar My Neighbour</span> (1882), a story of feuding brothers, <span class="italic">The Waters of Hercules</span> (1885), and <span class="italic">A Sensitive Plant</span> (1891), dedicated to Margarita of Parma, concerning a timid young girl coming to terms with a ruthless mother and her beautiful unruly daughter, were published under the collective pseudonym E. D. Gerard, or E. and D. Gerard. They stopped writing together after Dorothea's marriage but a number of their individual works cross-refer: a character in Dorothea's <span class="italic">A Queen of Curds and Cream</span> (1892) appears in Emily's <span class="italic">A Foreigner</span> (1896).<br>
<br>In her fiction Emily Gerard frequently employed central European characters and settings, and it is likely that <span class="italic">A Foreigner</span> (1896), which featured a cross-cultural marriage, was shaped by her own experiences. She also wrote about the Transylvanian culture and landscape, drawing on the knowledge of the area, particularly of Hermannstadt and Kronstadt, gained during the two years (1883&#150;5) that her husband had been posted there. She wrote on the vampire myth in &#145;Transylvanian superstitions&#146;, an article that Bram Stoker used for research when writing <span class="italic">Dracula</span> (1897), and where he discovered the term &#145;nosferatu&#146;. While these articles appeal to a taste for anecdotes about what were, in nineteenth-century Britain, exotic and little-known regions, they also include some consideration of wider political matters. In &#145;Transylvanian peoples&#146; published in the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> (1887), for example, Emily Gerard concludes by suggesting that central European cultures might eventually become important in wider European affairs, giving British audiences reason to learn about them. She collected her observations in <span class="italic">The Land beyond the Forest: Facts, Figures and Fancies from Transylvania</span> (1888).<br>
<br>Even though Emily Gerard wrote six novels of her own in addition to reviews and short stories, it was Dorothea who became the better-known writer. She was more prolific, publishing at least thirty-seven books of her own and some shorter magazine pieces. Her work, also influenced by her European experiences, often touches on potentially controversial or unconventional topics. She opens <span class="italic">Orthodox</span> (1888), for example, with a depiction of the reflexive antisemitism of a Polish army officer, and <span class="italic">The Million</span> (1901) features a radical, discontented Polish villager as a central character. But on the whole her fiction is more escapist than polemical, and explorations of larger social issues such as antisemitism or, as in <span class="italic">A Queen of Curds and Cream</span> (1892), the cultural gaps between English and central European characters, are subordinated to sentimental romance plots. She was praised for this conventionality at the time; <span class="italic">The Churchman</span> recommends her novel <span class="italic">The Rich Miss Riddell</span> (1894) as &#145;clean, interesting, and wholesome&#146; entertainment  (Gerard). <span class="italic">One Year</span> (1899), a novel about love and suicide set in Galicia, is often considered to be her most powerful work, however.<br>
<br>Both <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> and <span class="italic">The Times</span> comment on Dorothea's wider appeal in their articles on Emily's death, <span class="italic">The Times</span> observing that Emily &#145;had not won equal popularity with that of her sister&#146;  (p. 7), despite Emily's being &#145;a capable novelist, with an excellent gift for telling a story&#146; as <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> pointed out  (p. 86). Yet Dorothea's greater popularity did not mean that she won more critical respect; in its obituary for Dorothea, <span class="italic">The Times</span> coolly described her as being &#145;hardly a novelist of the first order&#146;, although it conceded that she &#145;could write naturally and with spirit &hellip; in her own straightforward and fluent style&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 18 Nov 1915, 11).<br>
<br>Emily Gerard died on 11 January 1905 in Vienna, where she was buried two days later; she and her husband had made their home there following his retirement from active service. Dorothea Gerard, who had also settled in Vienna, and had lived the last few years of her life as a recluse, died there on 29 September 1915.<br>
