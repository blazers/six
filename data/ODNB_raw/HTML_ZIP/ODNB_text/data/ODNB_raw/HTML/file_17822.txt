<span class="headword">Maitland,  Frederick</span>  (1763&#150;1848), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born on 3 September 1763, was the youngest son of General Sir Alexander Maitland, first baronet (1728&#150;1820), colonel 49th foot, and his wife, Penelope (<i>d</i>. 22 December 1805), daughter of Colonel Martin Madan MP and sister of Martin Madan, bishop of Peterborough. Charles Maitland, sixth earl of Lauderdale, was his paternal grandfather. On 1 September 1779 Frederick was appointed ensign in the 14th foot. He served with a company of his regiment doing duty as marines on the <i>Union</i> (90 guns, Captain J. Dalrymple) in the channel in 1779&#150;80, became lieutenant on 19 September 1782, and was on board Admiral Darby's fleet at the relief of Gibraltar in October 1782. He afterwards served for fifteen months in Jamaica.<br>
<br>In 1784 Maitland was transferred to the 30th foot, and placed on half pay; he devoted his leisure time to study. After returning to the West Indies in 1787 he was for a time assistant quartermaster-general in Jamaica. He married at Barbados, in November 1790, Catherine, daughter of John Prettijohn of that island. They had nine children. He had obtained his company in the 60th Royal Americans in 1789, and brought the dispatches announcing the capture of Tobago in April 1793. The sloop <i>Fairy</i> (18 guns, Captain John Laforey), in which he came home, was engaged during the voyage with a French 32-gun frigate, which escaped. Maitland was brevet major and aide-de-camp to Sir Charles Grey [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11525/', "Grey, Charles, first Earl Grey")</script>] at the relief of Nieuport and Ostend in 1794, and deputy adjutant-general, with the brevet of lieutenant-colonel, at the capture of Martinique, Guadeloupe, and St Lucia in the same year. He was promoted major, 9th foot, in 1794, and lieutenant-colonel in 1795, when he was transferred to the 27th Inniskillings. He went back to the West Indies in 1795, as military secretary to Sir Ralph Abercromby, with whom he served at St Lucia, St Vincent, Puerto Rico, and elsewhere, in 1795&#150;7. While returning home in the <i>Arethusa</i> (38 guns, Captain T. Woolley), he was present and commanded the cabin guns of the frigate at the capture of the French corvette, <i>La Gaiet&eacute;</i>, south-east of Bermuda, on 20 August 1797. He afterwards served on Abercromby's staff in Scotland, and in the expedition to the Netherlands in 1799.<br>
<br>As a brevet colonel Maitland returned once more to the West Indies in 1800, and was quartermaster-general there for six years. He commanded a brigade at the capture of the Danish, Swedish, and Dutch West India islands in 1800&#150;01. He was transferred as lieutenant-colonel from the Inniskillings to the 29th, was appointed brigadier-general in 1804, and commanded a brigade at the capture of Surinam. He became a major-general in 1805, and in 1807 was second in command, under General Bowyer, at the recapture of the Dutch and Danish islands, which had been restored at the peace of Amiens. At St Thomas's he received the sword of the governor, Van Schogen, at the spot on which he had received it six years before. He commanded a brigade at the capture of Martinique in 1809 and the subsequent operations at Les Saintes.<br>
<br>Maitland had been appointed lieutenant-governor of Grenada in 1805, and except when absent on active service, as in the West Indies, administered the civil government of the island. This he did until 1810. He was an upright and painstaking administrator. Although his legal knowledge was self-acquired, his decisions as vice-chancellor were never reversed save in a solitary instance on a technical point of law. Privately he was opposed to the abolition of slavery. He became a lieutenant-general in 1811, and on 1 January 1812 was appointed second in command in the Mediterranean under Lord William Bentinck [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2161/', "Bentinck, Lord William Henry Cavendish- (1774&#150;1839)")</script>]. In that capacity he commanded the Anglo-Sicilian army sent from Sicily to the east coast of Spain to make a diversion on Suchet's left flank. The situation in Sicily prevented Bentinck from detaching a force of the strength expected by Wellington, and the motley corps of 9000 British German Legion, Swiss, Sicilians, and Neapolitans, with which Maitland arrived off Palamos on 31 July 1812, was too ill-provided with commissariat and field-train to justify a landing there. Maitland proceeded to Alicante, landed his troops, and opened communication with the Spanish generals in Murcia. After some desultory movements he began to entrench his camp at Alicante at the end of August 1812. But his health was broken, and at the beginning of November, having done nothing, he resigned the command to General Mackenzie, and returned home. He received the lieutenant-governorship of Dominica on 30 June 1813 in recognition of his past services.<br>
<br>Maitland, a full general in 1825, had been appointed in 1810 colonel in succession of the 1st Ceylon regiment and in 1833 he became colonel in succession of the 58th foot. A memoir by him on the defences of Mount's Bay, Cornwall, is extant  (<span class="italic">Dispatches of &hellip; the Duke of Wellington</span>, 7.149&#150;51). He died at Tunbridge Wells on 27 January 1848, aged eighty-four. His wife, and three of their children, survived him; his eldest brother, Sir Alexander Maitland-Gibson (or Gibson-Maitland), second baronet, deputy governor of the Bank of Scotland, survived him by only a few days.<br>
