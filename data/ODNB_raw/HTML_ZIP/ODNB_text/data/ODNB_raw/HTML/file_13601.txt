<span class="headword">Holmes,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1748, <em>d.</em> 1805), <span class="occ">biblical scholar</span>, was baptized at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 30 November 1748, the son of Edmund Holmes of the parish and his wife, Mary. He became a scholar of Winchester College in 1760, and matriculated from New College, Oxford, on 3 March 1767. In 1769 he won the chancellor's prize for Latin verse, the subject being &#145;Ars pingendi&#146;. He graduated BA in 1770, was elected fellow of the college, and graduated MA in 1774, BD in 1787, and DD in 1789.<br>
<br>Holmes was appointed to the college rectory of Stanton St John, Oxfordshire, and held the post until his death. He became prebendary of Lyme and Halstock in Salisbury Cathedral on 23 May 1790, prebendary of Moreton-with-Whaddon in Hereford Cathedral on 12 August 1791, prebendary of the seventh stall in Christ Church, Oxford, on 28 April 1795, and dean of Winchester on 20 February 1804. In addition to these positions, Holmes was professor of poetry at Oxford, 1783&#150;93. He was the Bampton lecturer for 1782, and gave a fast-day sermon to parliament on 9 March 1796. On 14 December 1797 he was elected FRS.<br>
<br>Holmes's works are wide-ranging: he published <span class="italic">Alfred: an Ode</span> (1778) and an ode for the duke of Portland which was set to music by Philip Hayes (1793), as well as his Bampton lectures (1782), the fast-day sermon (1796), a sermon on the resurrection (1777), and various tracts. In 1788 he began his weightiest work: the collation of the manuscripts of the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span>. The work was intended to draw on all the known manuscripts of the Greek text, including oriental versions, and for seventeen years, despite the difficulties caused by the wars, he managed to collate various readings from manuscripts in libraries throughout Europe. The delegates of the Clarendon Press allowed him &pound;40 a year for three years on condition that he exhibited his work annually, and deposited it in the Bodleian Library. He received additional support from annual subscriptions for the project, which attracted financial contributions from academia, the clergy, and the aristocracy. Major donors in 1789 included the universities of Cambridge and Dublin, Beilby Porteus, and nineteen other members of the bishop's bench. Annual accounts of the progress of the work, with lists of subscribers, were published from 1789, and in 1795 Holmes published specimens of the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span> together with Latin letters to Shute Barrington. Part of <span class="roman">Genesis</span> was published in 1798. Holmes's last volume (numbered 142) of collations was deposited in the Bodleian Library in 1805. Following Holmes's death at his home in St Giles', Oxford, on 12 November 1805 the work was continued by James Parsons, and completed in 1827. It was not published, despite attempts by Oxford University Press to raise funds for its publication in 1816.<br>
