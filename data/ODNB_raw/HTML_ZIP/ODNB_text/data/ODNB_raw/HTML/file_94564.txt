<span class="headword">Chipembere,  Henry Blasius Masauko</span>  (1930&#150;1975), <span class="occ">politician in Nyasaland and Malawi</span>, was born on 5 August 1930 at Kayoyo village, Nkhotakota district, Nyasaland, the fourth of the eight children of Habil Chipembere (1900&#150;1976), an Anglican priest, and his wife, Drusilla Mwarabu. He was educated at Blantyre secondary school and then Goromonzi secondary school in Southern Rhodesia. In 1952 he entered Fort Hare University College in South Africa. When he returned to Nyasaland after graduation he took up an appointment as a district assistant in 1955, soon after a bitter campaign of opposition to the creation of the Central African Federation had ended in failure.<br>
<br>In 1955 African representation in the Nyasaland legislative council was increased to five members who were to be elected through the provincial councils the following year. Chipembere was one of the Nyasaland African Congress (NAC) candidates, who won all five seats. They began a takeover of the leadership of the NAC and sharpened its campaign for secession and eventual self-government. In 1957 Chipembere married Catherine Mary Ambali (<i>b</i>. 1932), another staunch Anglican.<br>
<br>All the new leaders of the NAC had ability but their youth militated against them in the villages, where age was deemed a necessary characteristic of leadership. Attempting to solve this problem, Chipembere took the lead in persuading the NAC to press Hastings Kamuzu Banda, a supporter of the NAC who had lived abroad for decades, to return and lead the movement. Only later in exile would Chipembere accept that his decision had been a tragic error. Initially it appeared a masterstroke. In the months after Banda's return the upsurge of enthusiasm for secession was such that the NAC congress had either to be given way to or crushed. The governor, Sir Robert Armitage, with the co-operation of the federal government, declared a state of emergency in March 1959, and around 1300 NAC activists were arrested. Banda and the small group of young leaders were detained in Southern Rhodesia, while most detainees were held at Kanjedza in Nyasaland. Meanwhile a group of teachers began the Malawi Congress Party (MCP) as a continuation of the banned NAC under a different name. The first of the leaders to be released, Orton Chirwa, became president of the MCP and then handed over the presidency to Banda after the latter's release on 1 April 1960. Chipembere and the other young leaders were brought back to Kanjedza on 1 April but were not released. They sat in Kanjedza for six months while it emptied of ordinary detainees. Banda, meanwhile, negotiated with Britain for the secession of Nyasaland from the federation with a view to gaining independence. He also took over the MCP, making it his own in a way the NAC had not been.<br>
<br>In September 1960 the young leaders were at last released from Kanjedza, and Chipembere became treasurer-general of the MCP. He immediately delivered a series of fiery speeches increasing the tension in the bitter dispute with London over when the first elections for a new assembly should be held. As a result, in January 1961 he was charged with sedition and sentenced to three years in prison. When the elections were held finally in August 1961 the MCP won decisively, with Chipembere's father gaining a seat, promising to vacate it on his son's release from prison. In February 1963, when Nyasaland had gained internal self-government, Chipembere, newly released from prison, became minister of local government. The move towards full independence was now rapid but so was the increase in tension between the ever more authoritarian Banda and the other members of the cabinet. The crisis came soon after the granting of independence in July 1964.<br>
<br>From very early in their relationship Banda had patronized the young men. By September 1964 he was politically emasculating them. With Chipembere (by then minister of education) absent in Canada, Banda dismissed three key ministers; two others resigned in sympathy. Chipembere returned immediately and attempted to bring about reconciliation, but to no avail, and subsequently he too resigned. The other former ministers very soon felt forced to flee the country while Chipembere returned home to the small Malawi enclave on the east shore of Lake Malawi. He was promptly &#145;restricted&#146; to that district. He, however, gathered a force of dissidents there and attempted, in February 1965, to move on Zomba, then the capital, where he hoped there would be a popular uprising against Banda. His attempt failed and he was then smuggled out of the country with the help of British and American diplomats.<br>
<br>After a brief stay in the United States Chipembere went to Dar es Salaam, where many exiles from Malawi had settled. There he taught at Kivukoni College from 1966 to 1969. He then returned to the United States to study for a PhD at the University of California, Los Angeles, while he worked as an assistant professor of history at California State University, Los Angeles. On 24 September 1975 he died in Los Angeles as a result of the diabetes from which he had suffered for many years. He was buried in Hollywood.<br>
