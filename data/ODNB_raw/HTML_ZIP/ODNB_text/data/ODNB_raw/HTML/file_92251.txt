<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lewis,  (John Frederick) Norman</span>  (1908&#150;2003), <span class="occ">traveller and author</span>, was born on 28 June 1908 at Clifton, Carterhatch Lane, Enfield, Middlesex, the fourth child of Richard George Lewis (d<i></i>. 1936), a pharmacist, and his wife, Louise Charlotte,<i> n&eacute;e</i> Evans (<i>d</i>. 1950). His parents became practising spiritualists after their elder sons failed to reach maturity. The family was Welsh. Bullied at Forty Hill church school, Lewis spent a year with relatives in Carmarthen before returning to attend Enfield grammar school (1920&#150;25). Marriage to Ernestina Maria Luisa Carmela Caterina Corvaja, the Spanish-educated daughter of Sicilian immigrants, broadened his horizons in the 1930s. He lived with his polyglot in-laws in Bloomsbury and made a living from photography and the sale of cameras, trading under his father's name. The R. G. Lewis business, based in High Holborn, grew into a chain of eight shops across southern England and remained in his ownership until 1978.<br>
<br>A trip to Spain in 1934 was described in Lewis's first book, <span class="italic">Spanish Adventure</span> (1935), and also&#151;quite differently&#151;in his last, <span class="italic">The Tomb in Seville</span> (2003). <span class="italic">Sand and Sea in Arabia</span> (1938) contained photographs of his travels in the Red Sea with the Hungarian journalist Ladislas Farago. During the Second World War he served as a sergeant in the field security section of the intelligence corps, helping maintain order in allied-occupied Algeria, Tunisia, Italy, and Austria. His memories formed the basis of <span class="italic">Naples '44</span> (1978), a powerful portrayal of a devastated city.<br>
<br>Lewis struggled to adjust to civilian life in 1946. Agreeing to separation from his wife and son, Ito, who had moved to Latin America, he set up home in London with Hester Reid (1909&#150;1994), a Scottish military nurse he had met in Africa three years earlier. She changed her surname to his, and they had two children, Karen and Gareth, before splitting up in 1948. Lewis wrote two novels that reflected his wartime experiences: <span class="italic">Samara</span> (1949), set in Algeria, and <span class="italic">Within the Labyrinth</span> (1950), set in Italy. His publisher, Jonathan Cape, suggested further travel writing and financed a three-month trip to French Indo-China in 1950. The result was <span class="italic">A Dragon Apparent</span> (1951), a great and immediate success, soon followed by <span class="italic">Golden Earth</span> (1952), about Burma. Both vividly depicted traditional societies on the brink of radical upheaval. Thereafter magazines and Sunday newspapers every so often commissioned his impressions of other troubled lands, among them Guatemala, Paraguay, Haiti, Liberia, and Cuba. With characteristic deadpan humour, he claimed to prefer inaccessible places with despotic governments, mosquitoes, and malaria. Lewis was a tall, bespectacled man, slender and slightly stooped, with a clipped moustache and soulful eyes. He retained a trace of north London in his voice; his manner was self-effacing. Though he later teamed up with the photographer Don McCullin for a number of expeditions, he generally liked to travel alone, relying on his ability to get by in six foreign languages (French, Spanish, Arabic, Russian, German, and Italian). Collected in book form, his articles appealed especially to readers who were fond of the colourfully seedy, raffish, and bizarre. They relished his finely crafted prose and sharp eye for eccentricity. An understated style perhaps offset exaggerated content. &#145;Whatever I tell you, cut by a half or two thirds&#146;, he cautioned a journalist  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). Lewis was rather cavalier about dates and sometimes disguised places. For instance, he wrote of Farol in Catalonia and his home at Long Crendon in Essex; neither appears on any map.<br>
<br>As well as travel books Lewis published a dozen more novels, typically cold war thrillers concerning CIA agents, guerrilla insurgencies, and assassination plots in South America or north Africa. These prompted comparisons to Graham Greene, who much admired his work (although they never met). <span class="italic">The Volcanoes above Us</span> (1957), <span class="italic">The Sicilian Specialist</span> (1975), and <span class="italic">A Suitable Case for Corruption</span> (1984) were notable examples. Other books&#151;from <span class="italic">The Day of the Fox</span> (1955) to <span class="italic">Voices of the Old Sea</span> (1984)&#151;testified to his deep love of Spain before mass tourism. The <span class="italic">New Yorker</span> serialized <span class="italic">The Honoured Society</span> (1964), an expos&eacute; of the Sicilian Mafia.<br>
<br>Long a detached observer of humanity, latterly Lewis felt compelled to speak out against the damage inflicted in the name of progress: mankind had gone wrong when it invented money, navigation, and universal religions. He valued most highly of all his writings a report published in the <span class="italic">Sunday Times Magazine</span> of 23 February 1969 entitled &#145;From fire and sword to arsenic and bullets&#146;, which publicized atrocities against Indians in Brazil, and inspired the founding of the Primitive People's Fund (renamed Survival International in 1971), a charity seeking to defend the rights of tribal communities. Insensitive American evangelists were his target in <span class="italic">The Missionaries</span> (1988). <span class="italic">A Goddess in the Stones</span> (1991) described the effects of industrialization on rural India, while <span class="italic">An Empire of the East</span> (1993) offered a critical view of Indonesian rule in Aceh, Irian Jaya, and East Timor.<br>
<br>Reprints issued in the 1980s won Lewis new readers and critical acclaim as the doyen of British travel writers. He lived from 1959 at the Old Parsonage, Finchingfield, Essex, with (Maureen) Lesley Burley (<i>b</i>. 1930), an airline ground stewardess from Australia, whom he formally married in 1975. Their children were Gawaine, Kiki, and Samara. Old age did not deter him from venturing abroad in order to add to his precious stock of notebooks. At home he wrote 700 words a day, always in the morning. His other interests included watching birds and cultivating rare lilies. Suffering from Alzheimer's disease, he died of bronchopneumonia and heart failure at the community hospital, Saffron Walden, Essex, on 22 July 2003. He was survived by his wife, Lesley, and his six children.<br>
