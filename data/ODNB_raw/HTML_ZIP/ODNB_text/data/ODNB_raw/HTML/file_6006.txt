<span class="headword">Colville,  Alexander</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1597), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6010/', "Sir James Colville of Easter Wemyss (d. 1540)")</script> and his second wife, Margaret Forrester (<i>d</i>. in or before 1562). Under his parents' marriage contract of 21 May 1536 Colville received an annual allowance of &pound;100, but in May 1562 he renounced this in return for payments totalling 1000 merks. In February 1567 he received a charter of the abbey of Culross, succeeding his uncle William Colville as commendator. On 12 May of that year he was present when Queen Mary announced before the court of session that she had not married Bothwell under duress. In December 1571 Colville became a lord of session, and about the same time he began collecting decisions of the court of session. Between 1570 and 1572 he attended the national conventions which successively elected the earls of Lennox, Mar, and Morton as regent. On 20 January 1574 he was authorized to pay only 100 merks for the thirds of the benefice of Culross, a substantial reduction from the 500 merks which the kirk commissioners had originally required him to remit. From November 1575 he sat as a privy councillor. In November 1578 he was appointed to the parliamentary commission to review the laws of the realm, and at the same time he acted as an arbitrator in the Gordon&#150;Forbes feud.<br>
<br>Colville subscribed to the &#145;Defence of the king of Scots&#146; as a supporter of the Ruthven raid in August 1582, and when that regime collapsed in June 1583, to be followed by a royalist reaction, he became for a time less involved in government. He ceased to collect session decisions in 1584, and in May and June 1585 temporarily vacated the bench in favour of his nephew John Colville, the chanter of Glasgow. But with the return of the Ruthven exiles he again became active in public affairs, serving as one of the lords of the articles (4 December 1585)&#151;as a privy councillor in at least sixty sessions from December 1585 to December 1596, and on four conventions of estates between 1588 and 1596. On 6 March 1590 he was made a commissioner to enforce anti-Jesuit legislation for the shires of Clackmannan and Kinross, and in 1592 he was named to a commission to reform hospitals. With his wife Nicholas [<i>sic</i>], daughter of Alexander Dundas of Fingask, he had nine children. Alexander Colville died in May 1597.<br>
