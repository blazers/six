<span class="headword">Dakin,  Henry Drysdale</span>  (1880&#150;1952), <span class="occ">biochemist</span>, was born at 60 Fitzjohn's Avenue, Hampstead, London, on 12 March 1880, the youngest of a family of five sons and three daughters of Thomas Burns Dakin and his wife, Sophia, formerly Stevens. His father was then the owner of a sugar refinery in London, but later acquired an iron and steel business in Leeds, and moved there with his family in 1893. Dakin, after a brief period at the Merchant Taylors' School, London, therefore transferred at the age of thirteen to the Leeds modern school. On leaving school he was apprenticed to the Leeds city analyst, T. Fairley, before he entered, in 1898, the Yorkshire College, Leeds. In later years he recalled this early and strict scientific discipline of an analyst's laboratory as valuable training for his lifelong devotion to the then newly emergent science of biochemistry.<br>
<br>Dakin's course for the BSc brought him at once into contact with Julius B. Cohen, then the lecturer in organic chemistry at the Yorkshire College. It was with Cohen that Dakin began to acquire his lasting interest in the optical activity of organic compounds, its influence on their biological activities, or on their acceptability as nutrients. His specially vivid interest in the selective action of a natural enzyme on one component of a racemic compound led Cohen to give him the nickname Zyme, which his friends were to use as a familiar mode of address for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>After obtaining his BSc in 1901 from the University of Manchester, and spending a further year with Cohen as his personal assistant and demonstrator, Dakin was awarded a research exhibition by the 1851 Commissioners, and worked with it at the Jenner (later the Lister) Institute under S. G. Hedin; at Heidelberg, with A. Kossel; and for a final period again at the Lister Institute. These researches covered enzymatic actions on proteins and, selectively, on racemic esters of mandelic acid; on arginase and protamines; and on the synthesis of the hormone adrenaline and related active bases.<br>
<br>At that juncture the physician and biochemist Christian A. Herter (1865&#150;1910) of New York was enquiring in London for somebody with suitable scientific and personal qualifications for an appointment with him in a private laboratory for biochemical researches which he had installed, and fully equipped, on two upper floors of his Madison Avenue mansion. Dakin accepted this unusual opportunity, for which, indeed, he had unique qualifications; and, in the event, he was to spend the rest of his working life in developing its special possibilities. Its conditions accentuated in him an inborn shrinking from any kind of publicity, which prevented him from taking part in any open meeting, discussion, or ceremony. He was elected FRS in 1917 but an invitation to deliver the Croonian lecture was met by a penitent refusal; and the award to him of its Davy medal (1941) was accepted only because, in wartime conditions, it could be presented in his own library. Congenial colleagues, however, were always welcomed to free and lively discussions of researches in private. Dakin had, indeed, a genius for quietly intimate friendships. Meanwhile publications of his own important researches in biochemistry were issuing in a steady stream from the Herter Laboratory.<br>
<br>After Herter died in 1910 his widow, Susan Dows Herter (<i>d</i>. 1951), was eager to maintain the laboratory, with Dakin thenceforward in sole charge of its uses. In 1916 their personal devotion was confirmed by their marriage. Dakin, though chronically unfit for active service, had hastened to Britain to offer his services for any national purpose. He eventually found opportunity for researches on the antiseptic treatment of wounds, and became an active advocate and exponent of the use of a buffered hypochlorite solution. This he used to great purpose in the <i>Aquitania</i> (then serving as a hospital ship for the Dardanelles) after having arranged for the installation of an electrolytic tank, with which an unlimited supply of the hypochlorite solution&#151;Dakin's solution&#151;could be made from sea water.<br>
<br>The Dakins moved later from Madison Avenue to a house and estate at Scarborough-on-Hudson, some 30 miles upriver from New York. There the laboratory was reinstated in a special building, and Dakin continued his researches, with their characteristic, unhurried perfection, almost until his death, on 10 February 1952, a year after that of his wife. They had no children. He had received honorary doctorates from Leeds, Yale, and Heidelberg. Dakin was cremated and his ashes buried, as he had requested, in his wife's grave.<br>
