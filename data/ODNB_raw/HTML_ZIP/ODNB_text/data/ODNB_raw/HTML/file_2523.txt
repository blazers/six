<span class="headword">Blackhall <span class="st"> [Blakhal]</span>,  Gilbert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1671), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was evidently descended from the Blackhalls of Barra, Aberdeenshire, though his parentage is unknown. His brother George (<i>d</i>. 1656) was a merchant who became a Jesuit coadjutor (lay brother) in Spain. Gilbert served as a soldier on the continent before, in 1626, enrolling in the Scots College in Rome, where he was ordained as a priest on 30 March 1630. The following year, on the recommendation of a cousin, he became confessor to Lady Isabelle Hay, eldest daughter of the earl of Erroll, in Paris. With the support of the viceroy of the Spanish Netherlands, the infanta, Clara Eugenia, Blackhall arranged her settlement in a house of aristocratic canonesses in Mons in 1637. He then travelled through England to Scotland, arriving there in August 1637, and took up work as a missionary priest in Aberdeenshire. Basing himself in Aboyne Castle (from July 1638) he served as priest to the widowed Lady Aboyne (Sophia Hay, sister of his former charge), as well as ministering to Catholic households between Aboyne and Aberdeen, and between Aberdeen and Strathbogie (Huntly). The outbreak of the covenanters' rebellion against Charles I had intensified persecution of Roman Catholics, and to the dangers of the situation were added the complications of bitter disputes between Jesuits and secular priests like Blackhall. The unsettled times also forced him, not unwillingly, into the role of Lady Aboyne's military adviser, organizing the defence of her castle against highland raiders. &#145;Know that I was a soldier befor you could weepe your owne nose&#146;  (Blakhal, 85), he contemptuously told the captain of a gang of Camerons after disarming his men.<br>
<br>Shortly before her death early in 1642 Lady Aboyne entrusted Blackhall with ensuring that her only surviving child, Henrietta Gordon, was brought up as a Catholic and not perverted to protestantism. This he undertook with his customary tenacity. He visited the girl's grandmother, the dowager Lady Huntly, in France, in 1643 but she refused to help, whereupon the obscure priest boldly approached Anne of Austria, queen of France, and through her obtained a letter from Louis XIII to the marquess of Huntly, Henrietta's guardian, promising her a position at court. Back in Scotland, however, he found Huntly unwilling to help, and that Henrietta had converted to protestantism. None the less he managed to persuade her to allow him to smuggle her to France and Roman Catholicism.<br>
<br>In his <span class="italic">Narration</span>, a lively narrative of his services, which he completed in 1653 and addressed to Henrietta at the French court, Blackhall complains of the lack of thanks he had received from his three ladies. Both Isabelle Hay and Henrietta Gordon had conceived a hearty dislike of him through his well-meant meddling in their lives&#151;and Lady Aboyne had inconveniently died. In between his complaints Blackhall provides valuable glimpses of a robust and energetic Roman Catholic priest at large in covenanting Scotland. His swaggering boldness and liking for drink and song, no doubt legacies of his military past, on occasion helped to deflect suspicion from him when he was in danger of detection. He served briefly as principal of the Scots College in Paris in 1653, but nothing further is known of him except that he visited Scotland about 1668 and died in Paris on 1 July 1671.<br>
