</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Streat, Sir  (Edward) Raymond</span>  (1897&#150;1979), <span class="occ">cotton trade administrator</span>, was born on 7 February 1897 at 2 Brunswick Terrace, Prestwich, Lancashire, the fifth of the six children of Edward Streat (1856&#150;1918), a commercial traveller, and his first wife, Helen (Nellie) Wallis (1859&#150;1908). His father, who was born in Chaddleworth, near Newbury, Berkshire, and went to Manchester at an early age to find work, was a Wesleyan Methodist of sincere convictions, an ardent freemason, and an active member of the local Liberal Party; his mother was a cultured woman. Streat attended Manchester grammar school; although a good student, he left in 1913 to become an office boy. Several months later, not yet eighteen years old, he enlisted in the 10th Manchester regiment, against his father's wishes. He had been a &#145;delicate&#146; child but he survived the First World War, having seen active service in France, where he was slightly wounded. Looking back, he commented that &#145;really it was the experiences as an infantry officer which broadened my social armoury&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lancashire and Whitehall</span>, 1.xiii).<h2>
<a name="Manchesterchamberofcommerce"></a>Manchester chamber of commerce</h2>After being demobilized as a captain in early 1919, Streat became secretary to the director of a Manchester insurance firm. Six months later, out of 600 applicants, he was made assistant secretary to the Manchester chamber of commerce; following the death of the secretary, the board of directors, in January 1920, by a margin of one vote, appointed Streat secretary. It was a bold appointment: he was only twenty-two years old, and he became the highest-ranking permanent paid official of the richest, the largest, and probably the most influential chamber of commerce in the country. Without any member of his family having any connection with the cotton industry, he found himself secretary of an organization dominated by merchants in the cotton trade. He remained at the chamber for twenty years until in 1940 he was appointed chairman of the Cotton Board, a position he held until 1957. He married on 16 March 1921 Doris Davies (1896&#150;1976), a friend from his school days, the daughter of Amos Davies, a manufacturer; they had three sons&#151;Basil, Tony (who died from wounds during the Second World War), and Christopher&#151;and established their home at Wilmslow, Cheshire.<br>
<br>For thirty-eight years Streat was at the centre of the cotton industry's attempts to cope with the drastic decline of its trade. No one else played such a leading part in Lancashire's struggle to find a workable solution over so long a period. Neither a businessman nor a civil servant, Streat belonged to a relatively new occupational group, the professional secretary. His duty as secretary of the Manchester chamber of commerce was to record the proceedings of meetings, but, with his energy, vision, charm, and tact, he exercised initiative in administration and played an active role in the formation of the chamber's policy and in negotiations. He built up the staff from half a dozen in 1920 to fifty in 1939; he trained assistant secretaries who went on to become secretaries of other chambers of commerce; he wrote the annual report and the presidents' speeches; he edited the chamber's magazine, the <span class="italic">Monthly Record</span>; he contributed articles to newspapers; and he served as a link between the chamber and other Lancashire organizations. He was also a link between the chamber and the international chamber of commerce, and served as a member of its delegation to the World Economic Conference held at Geneva in 1927 under the auspices of the League of Nations. He built up personal contacts with civil servants, MPs, and key figures, gaining a reputation for providing an authoritative briefing paper quickly, and he came to play an intermediary role, taking proposals and counter-proposals from one group to another, and earned an accolade as &#145;a tennis ball with a decided spin of its own&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lancashire and Whitehall</span>, 1.531). He contributed innovative ideas such as that for the Lancashire Industrial Development Council, which, from its inaugural meeting in 1931, worked to bring new industries into Lancashire.<br>
<br>During the inter-war years the troubles of the cotton trade overshadowed the chamber's other activities. Because many of the industry's difficulties revolved around the loss of export markets and questions of tariffs, quotas, and trade agreements, the chamber became the principal voice of the cotton trade, wielding considerable influence. India presented the most complex problems. In the early 1930s Streat was among those who believed it was useless for Lancashire to seek safeguards in the <span class="roman">Government of India Bill</span>. In 1933 he was a member of the British textile mission to India led by Sir William Clare Lees, and he formulated the compromise which led to an agreement. He was a central witness in the Privileges Affair of 1934. In 1935 he was a member of the delegation which presented Lancashire's case before the Indian tariff board and obtained a reduction of duties on most British cotton goods. He was also part of the delegation representing Lancashire's interest in negotiations in India that eventually resulted in the Anglo-Indian trade agreement of 1939. By the 1930s, however, Japanese competition was taking more of Lancashire's trade than was being blocked by Indian tariffs. Streat played a central role in long negotiations which in 1934 led the British government to impose a system of quotas, restricting imports of Japanese goods throughout colonial markets, and doing more than anything else to slow down the contraction of Lancashire's export trade. In addition he was particularly active in urging the reluctant Board of Trade to use the protective tariff brought in by the <span class="roman">Import Duties Act</span>, 1932, as a bargaining counter in renegotiating trade agreements to Lancashire's advantage as the world moved from multilateral to bilateral trade relations.<br>
<br>The reduced demand for exports after 1920 left Lancashire with the problem of how, in a horizontally divided industry, to adjust industrial capacity and reduce equipment and labour to match the new conditions. In 1925 the sectional organizations joined to form the Joint Committee of Cotton Trade Organizations, which included representative employers, merchants, and trade unionists; Streat served as its honorary secretary.<h2>
<a name="CottonBoardchairman"></a>Cotton Board chairman</h2>Streat's appointment as chairman of the Cotton Board in June 1940 evolved out of his broad experience with the problems of the export trade in cotton goods and his work at the Export Council, which he served as secretary on loan from the chamber from February 1940. The Cotton Board was not a government department but a statutory body, financed by a levy on the industry. Based in Manchester, it consisted of eleven members drawn from employers and trade unionists in the different sections of the industry, appointed by the president of the Board of Trade with an independent chairman. As chairman, and with his authority strengthened by a knighthood in 1942, Streat pushed ahead plans to promote exports until the advent of lend-lease subordinated exports to the needs of the war economy. The board rationed the remaining export trade, organized the concentration of the finishing section, planned and operated a scheme for the care and maintenance of the closed mills and their reopening at the end of the war, and established the &#145;utility scheme&#146; supplying standard cotton cloths to meet civilian needs. Also, implementing an idea of Streat's, it set up the Colour, Design and Style Centre, which worked to bring manufacturers and designers together to raise the standard of design.<br>
<br>From 1942 Streat was particularly active in discussions of post-war plans for industry, and he attended the Nuffield College weekend conferences on post-war reconstruction. A Wesleyan turned Anglican, he was among the Manchester business and university leaders who publicly supported the archbishop of Canterbury's &#145;religion and life campaign&#146;, which affirmed Christian principles as the basis for economic and political action after the war. Furthermore in 1943 he wrote the <span class="italic">Report</span> of the Cotton Board's Post-war Reconstruction Committee. The <span class="roman">Industrial Organization and Development Act</span>, 1947, empowered the Board of Trade to set up &#145;industrial development councils&#146; modelled on the Cotton Board for various industries. Under the act, a new Cotton Board took over the assets and activities of the existing board, and Streat continued as chairman.<br>
<br>At the end of the war the cotton industry had lost 40 per cent of its operatives and the reopening mills faced a sellers' market without sufficient labour. The board promoted measures to reorganize the industry and increase productivity, as well as to attract workers and increase exports. Aware of the threat of Japanese competition, Streat worked for a voluntary agreement among textile-exporting countries to share the shrinking world trade in cotton goods. He travelled to the USA twice in 1949 to secure the collaboration of American manufacturers and went to Japan and India in 1950 for talks with government representatives and industrialists. After 1952 large-scale duty-free imports from India, Hong Kong, and eventually Pakistan shook the confidence of the Lancashire industry. Despite protests and deputations, including one to Churchill in 1955, Streat and the Cotton Board were unable to alter government policy, and in 1957, lacking a sympathetic policy from the government, and with continuing sectional conflict, Streat decided to step down as chairman at the age of sixty.<h2>
<a name="Universityadministrator"></a>University administrator</h2>Although the lucrative directorships Streat hoped for did not materialize he was able to bring his skills and experience to bear during a period of unprecedented growth and change in universities. In 1957 he succeeded Ernest Simon as chairman of the council of Manchester University. He had been associated with the university since his election to the court of governors in 1938. He was elected to the council in 1943 and became treasurer in 1951; he helped work out the financial partnership between the government and university that supported the Jodrell Bank telescope (where a tree was planted in his memory after his death). While his time in the cotton industry had been characterized by an atmosphere of decline, Streat's eight-year tenure as chairman of Manchester University council were years of expansion, ample finance, and ready implementation of new ideas. He guided the university through the Robbins report of 1962, student revolts, and a new charter. His contributions were recognized with an honorary LLD in 1963. Outside Manchester he was visiting fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford, from 1944 and an honorary fellow from 1959.<br>
<br>While chairman of the Cotton Board, Streat had served a number of related organizations, particularly those concerned with the application of science to industry and technical education. He was a member of the advisory council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (1942&#150;7); president of the Association of Technical Institutions (1944&#150;5); a member of the General Advisory Council of the BBC (1947&#150;52); and president of the Textile Institute (1948&#150;51). Later he served on the North Western Electricity Consultative Council (1960&#150;68). Weekend rounds of golf and family summer holidays provided most of his recreation. He was a lively companion and a renowned organizer of games at family parties. People who knew him before the war in particular spoke of his extrovert high spirits and the irresistible attraction of his personality. After 1940 the heavy burden of the jobs he carried out and the anxiety and doubt, both national and personal, dampened his spirits, but he kept his resilience and his broad and generous way of thought. He died at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford on 13 September 1979 and was cremated at Oxford crematorium on 20 September.<br>
