<span class="headword">Fyffe,  Edward Wathen</span>  (1853&#150;1935), <span class="occ">tea and fruit importer</span>, was born on 31 December 1853 in Woodchester, Gloucestershire, the younger son of Ebenezer Wathen Fyffe and his wife, Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dunn. His father was head of a long established tea trading business in London, which became E. W. Fyffe, Son &amp; Co. Fyffe was brought up in the Gloucestershire village of Box, near Minchinhampton. After an attempt at farming, he entered the family firm and on his father's death was left in sole charge, his elder brother having taken holy orders.<br>
<br>Fyffe appears to have been reasonably successful, undertaking a trip to Ceylon to establish personal contacts with the growers at the start of his career. He married Ida Stanton Brown (1859&#150;1911), daughter of a Baptist minister, in 1884. They had two daughters within a very short time of each other, which led to a sharp deterioration in Ida's health, diagnosed as tuberculosis. As was customary in those days, a sojourn in a warmer climate such as that of the Canary Islands was advised. The family spent most of 1887 there with the result that Ida recovered completely, becoming well enough to enjoy social life and travel. In that way Edward became acquainted with the recent traumatic downturns in the islands' economy and was able to assess its potential.<br>
<br>Sir Alfred Jones, of the Elder Dempster Line, had already been encouraging the growing and export of bananas and tomatoes, to replace the islands' former main export, cochineal, now obsolete owing to the invention of aniline dyes. Elder Dempster's coal-carrying vessels picked up the fruit as cheap deck cargo on their return journey to Liverpool, but there was no organized distribution network in the UK for bananas and in the London fruit market they were regarded as an expensive luxury. Fyffe investigated the possibility of shipping the fruit directly to London himself. The problem, of which Elder Dempster and other shippers were equally aware, was the difficulty of bringing the fruit to Britain in good condition. Fyffe decided to confine himself to providing an import agency in London. It was a skilfully negotiated arrangement, in which the responsibility for the provision of fruit in reasonable condition fell on the grower. Evidence is lacking regarding its precise terms, but it is clear that Fyffe's long stay in the Canaries secured for him the confidence of a number of expatriate Britons who had become large landowners there. They agreed to back his venture and he sold their consignments on a commission basis. The first cargo of fruit arrived in September 1888, realized a reasonable profit, and from then on regular shipments were made. Most was sold in Covent Garden, with a small quantity being sold directly to the better class of London fruiterer. He met little competition in London until 1892, when Elder Dempster extended its activities from Liverpool.<br>
<br>By 1897 the growers' &#145;syndicate&#146; decided to buy Fyffe out, even though they had enjoyed great prosperity on his account. The reasons for this are obscure. Fyffe had taken a partner, James Hudson, in 1896 and the firm had changed its name to Fyffe, Hudson &amp; Co. This now became a private limited company in which the Canary Island expatriate growers held all the preference and ordinary shares.<br>
<br>After he was bought out, Fyffe retired from business altogether, apart from a brief period as chairman of Hilliers Bacon Curing Factory, whose founder was related to his wife. During his brief involvement with the trade, he had seen banana imports grow from 10,000 to nearly a million hands a year. He left the company in sound enough shape to induce Elder Dempster to merge its fruit department with it in 1901 under the style of Elders and Fyffes Ltd. By that time Jamaica had become a major source of supply.<br>
<br>Fyffe enjoyed a long retirement. He lived at Trullwell, Box, until his death, indulging his golfing interests and working for the National Trust. He does not appear to have been a man of great business ambitions. He took an opportunity that came his way quite fortuitously and built on it as far as he could, but was quite happy to retire gracefully at the age of forty-four. After his wife died in 1911 his daughters, both unmarried, continued to live with him. He died at Trullwell on 17 October 1935, leaving an estate of &pound;38,493, which, in its time, and considering his long retirement, represented a considerable amount of wealth.<br>
