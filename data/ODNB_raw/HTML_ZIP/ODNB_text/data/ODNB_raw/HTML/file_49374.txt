<span class="headword">Cumin <span class="st"> [Comyn]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1160), <span class="occ">ecclesiastic and administrator</span>, was notable for his infamous attempt to usurp the bishopric of Durham between 1141 and 1144. His family origins, possibly from Bosc-Bernard-Commin near Rouen, are obscure. There were several families of Norman clerks in England with connections to cathedral towns such as Bayeux and Rouen, and the Cumin family seems to have been one of them. Several Cumins appear in the chanceries of Henry I and Henry II and in a clerical or ecclesiastical context in Rouen and Bayeux. A John Cumin, probably of the same family, was an administrator prominent in the service of Henry II before becoming archbishop of Dublin in 1182.<br>
<br>The earliest reference to William Cumin occurs <i>c</i>.1121, when he appears as a witness to a gift by Ranulf, chancellor of England, to Bernard the Scribe. He was a pupil and prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Geoffrey Rufus, who became chancellor of England in 1123 and in 1133 bishop of Durham, and Cumin's career advanced with that of his patron. Shortly after 1125 Cumin had become archdeacon of Worcester, and it seems probable that Geoffrey Rufus took his prot&eacute;g&eacute; with him when he became bishop of Durham. At Durham it appears that Cumin came into contact with David I of Scotland (<i>r</i>. 1124&#150;53), who made him chancellor of Scotland by 1136. William Cumin was thus another prominent member of the Norman occupation of the Scottish royal household so much encouraged by David I after his accession in 1124. Two of Cumin's nephews, William and Osbert, took advantage of the family's breakthrough in Scotland. Symeon of Durham's chronicle describes nephew William as an accomplished young knight trained in the art of warfare and administration, while Osbert was in the service of David's son, Henry, earl of Northumberland.<br>
<br>As chancellor, William Cumin became actively involved in David's policies of absorbing the English northern counties into his kingdom and of supporting Empress Matilda and the Angevin cause against King Stephen in the English civil war. Captured when King David and his army were defeated at the battle of the Standard, near Northallerton in the North Riding of Yorkshire, on 22 August 1138, he was set free in September on the instructions of Alberic, the papal legate. Cumin's ambitious attempt to become bishop of Durham in 1141 fitted in well with the Scottish king's policy in northern England.<br>
<br>In late 1140 or early 1141 Cumin was the guest at Durham of his former patron, Geoffrey Rufus. Realizing that Rufus was near death, Cumin decided to try to secure the see for himself, but Rufus died before William had won all the support necessary for his successful candidature. Nevertheless, buoyed by the Scottish king's support, Cumin took over the administration of the see; but Roger Conyers, the constable, refused to pay homage to him and the prior and one of the archdeacons insisted on a canonical election. Cumin's position was briefly strengthened by Empress Matilda's approval of his candidature, but the papal legate excommunicated him. By 1142 King David appears to have distanced himself from Cumin, and so from 1142 to 1144 William acted as an independent adventurer striving, according to the chronicle of Melrose, &#145;with blind ambition&#146; to be made bishop. He used violence, and even attempted deceit through a forged letter from the pope purporting to support his candidature.<br>
<br>Cumin's intimidatory tactics could not prevent a canonical election taking place at York in 1143, when William de Ste Barbe, dean of York, was chosen bishop of Durham. It was not for another year that Cumin surrendered his claim to the bishopric, by which time two of his nephews, William, his favourite, and Osbert, had died in the conflict; William de Ste Barbe had also won the crucial support of David's son Henry. In return for renouncing his claims to the bishopric, Cumin secured the secular fortunes of his family through another nephew, Richard, who was given the castle and honour of Richmond. William Cumin himself, after imprisonment and cruel treatment by Richard de Luvetot, sought to revive his career in the south, where he received the support of Gilbert Foliot, then abbot of Gloucester. By 1146 William was in favour with Theobald, archbishop of Canterbury, who pressed his case for absolution before the pope <i>c</i>.1152. Thanks to favour from the Angevin party, Cumin began to regain his benefices in England. He appears prominently in witness lists to Henry of Anjou's charters of <i>c</i>.1153, and again in 1154 and 1156, after Henry had become king of England. By 1156&#150;7 Cumin had recovered his archdeaconry of Worcester. But he was no longer archdeacon by 1161, and it seems probable that he died <i>c</i>.1160. By this time the secular fortunes of his family had a firm foundation, first in Tynedale, Northumberland, and then in southern Scotland, through the favour given by the Scottish royal family to Cumin's nephew Richard. William Cumin's dramatic but unsuccessful attempt to become bishop of Durham should not obscure his part in the foundation of what was to become the most powerful baronial family in thirteenth-century Scotland.<br>
