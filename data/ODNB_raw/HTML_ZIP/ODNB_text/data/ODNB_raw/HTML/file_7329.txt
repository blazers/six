<span class="headword">Dawe,  Henry Edward</span>  (1790&#150;1848), <span class="occ">painter and printmaker</span>, was born on 24 September 1790 in Kentish Town, London, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7330/', "Philip Dawe (1745?&#150;1809?)")</script>, an engraver and caricaturist. Initially he was taught by his father, and then, like his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7328/', "George Dawe (1781&#150;1829)")</script> and his younger brother, James Philip (1794&#150;1879), he studied in the Royal Academy Schools. As one of the jobbing engravers employed by Turner in the production of his <span class="italic">Liber Studiorum</span> he created four prints: <span class="italic">Rievaulx Abbey</span> (1812), <span class="italic">Mill Near the Grand Chartreuse</span> (1815), <span class="italic">Twickenham&#151;Pope's Villa</span> (1819), and <span class="italic">Bonneville, Savoy</span> (1819).<br>
<br>In 1824 Dawe exhibited two engraved portraits at the newly founded Society of British Artists. These were probably mezzotints of Russian military leaders from a number which were being advertised for sale in London and St Petersburg from 1822 onwards. They were after originals by George Dawe and drawn from the numerous portraits of Russian military men which he was painting for the war gallery in the Winter Palace at St Petersburg. In 1824, when his engravings were exhibited at the Imperial Academy of Arts in that city, Henry Dawe was awarded the title of naznachennyi (associate). The St Petersburg journal <span class="italic">Otechestvenniye Zapiski</span>  (<span class="italic">Home Notes</span>, no. 206, p. 413) said that such was the strength of his engravings that they seemed to have been drawn in ink with a bold hand.<br>
<br>Keen to maximize his earnings and to establish the copyright monopoly granted him for prints made after his portraits for the war gallery, George Dawe intended to publish a folio of the complete set. To this end, he invited his younger brothers Henry and James Philip and his sister Mary Margaret to settle in the Russian capital, where he had established a large workshop in a house near the palace square and where his collaborator, Thomas Wright, Margaret's husband-to-be, was already in residence. They arrived in 1824. George Dawe's health began to give way and he never finished his commission, so that when the gallery was inaugurated on 25 December 1826 it lacked fourteen portraits. Henry made about twenty-four prints after his brother's depictions of these military men before the project came to an end.<br>
<br>After his return to London in 1827, Henry Dawe continued engraving both in line and mezzotint, producing works after a wide range of artists both past and contemporary. These were mostly shown at the annual exhibitions in Suffolk Street, to which he also contributed several paintings. In 1828, at the British Institution, he showed <span class="italic">The Coronation of George IV</span>; and in 1832 at the Society of British Artists, of which he had been elected a member two years previously, he exhibited a portrait of the new king, William IV, whom he had previously painted as duke of Clarence. He issued prints of both works. The majority of Dawe's later paintings were genre paintings typical of their time, with subject matter ranging from <span class="italic">The Wreck of George the Fourth, Convict Ship</span> (1836) to <span class="italic">The Holiday, or, Granny in a Rage</span> (1845), completed three years before his death. None are preserved in major galleries. He did not use his full name when signing his works, using instead &#145;Henry Dawe&#146; or &#145;Hen<sup>y</sup> Dawe&#146;.<br>
<br>Dawe was a skilful worker in mezzotint, but unfortunately for him at a time when the laborious and time-consuming medium had been superseded by steel-engraving and lithography. The varied subject matter of his paintings, some of which were engraved by himself or other artists, ensured them a degree of brief popularity among the public at large. Apparently an amiable man, happily married to Mary with whom he had surviving daughters, he lived for many years in Bartholomew Place, Kentish Town. In 1842 he retired to Windsor, where he died six years later, at 13 High Street, on 28 December 1848.<br>
