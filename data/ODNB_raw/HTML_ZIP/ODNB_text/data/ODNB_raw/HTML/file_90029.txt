<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bromley,  (Lionel) Peter John Stuart</span>  (1929&#150;2003), <span class="occ">horse-racing commentator</span>, was born on 30 April 1929 at 29 Derwent Road, West Derby, Liverpool, the son of Leonard Bromley, dental surgeon, and his wife, Kathleen Muriel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gibbs, who were then living at 51 Rocky Lane, Liverpool. He first developed an interest in horses after the family moved to the Cotswolds. There he taught himself to ride and in 1945 was introduced to jump racing at Cheltenham; it remained his favourite racecourse. Educated at Cheltenham College, he later attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, at which he discovered another lifelong passion, shooting. His skill with the rifle won him the Bisley cup in 1951 and also enabled him to train with the British modern pentathlon squad for the 1952 Olympic games. He narrowly missed final selection.<br>
<br>From 1948 to 1953 Bromley served as a cavalry officer with the 14/20 King's hussars and, when stationed at Fleet in Hampshire, he schooled horses for the local racehorse trainer Frank Pullen, competing in several point-to-points. On resigning his commission he became assistant to Pullen but a serious riding accident resulted in a fractured skull, a year-long convalescence, and the end of his aspirations as a jockey. He moved to Kent, and applied for a job with the British Racecourse Amplifying and Recording Company to become one of the first racecourse commentators. It is alleged that his first commentary, at Plumpton, contained the line, &#145;Atom Bomb has fallen!&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 5 June 2003). On 21 August 1954 he married Mary Josephine Hobson, the 23-year-old daughter of Alec Hobson, secretary of the Royal Horticultural Society of England. They had one daughter, Mary Clare.<br>
<br>During the next few years, Bromley honed his race reading skills at courses in south-east England and worked as a freelance for Independent Television and the BBC, which he joined full-time in 1959 as its first accredited sports correspondent. This ground-breaking appointment was overshadowed, however, by the death of his wife in a car accident that year, leaving him to bring up his young daughter. He married, on 8 May 1962, Joanna MacRobert Massie, a 23-year-old secretary, and daughter of Duncan MacRobert Massie, company director. They had two daughters, Liz Anne and Jane.<br>
<br>Bromley was the BBC racing correspondent for more than four decades. He had initially been offered a position alongside Peter O'Sullevan and Clive Graham as part of the television racing team, contributing to such weekly programmes as <span class="italic">Sportsview</span> and <span class="italic">Grandstand</span>, but he soon decided to concentrate on radio. His first commentary for BBC Radio was the Newmarket stakes in May 1959, his last the Epsom Derby in 2001. He worked for the Light Programme, Radio 2, and Radio 5 Live, undertaking commentaries in France, Ireland, Hong Kong, America, and South Africa, as well as calling the principal races each year in Britain. He was also responsible for the introduction of the daily racing bulletin on Radio 2 in 1964. His passion for the sport soon took him beyond the commentary box. As an owner his first and most successful purchase was Treasury Bond, unbeaten as a two-year-old in 1975. He later wrote <span class="italic">The Price of Success</span> (1982), the authorized biography of his trainer, Ryan Price, and <span class="italic">My Most Memorable Races</span> (1988).<br>
<br>Bromley became the radio voice of BBC racing, bringing the spirit and excitement of the racecourse into the homes of his listeners and creating, in his own words, &#145;a whole library of word pictures of great races&#146;  (Bromley, <span class="italic">Memorable Races</span>, 141). His preparation was meticulous. Before the advent of colour television and newsprint he painstakingly compiled his own charts of the jockeys' silks for easier identification, and after major races he would present these colourful records to winning owners, trainers, or jockeys. In his time as racing correspondent he witnessed an increase in racing coverage from fifty races a year in the 1950s to over 200 in the 1980s, and fought to maintain the presence of the sport on national radio as its general appeal waned. He still called around 150 races a year when he retired in 2001, having described over 10,000 during his career. His reputation was such that he had persuaded his employers to let him stay on until he reached the landmark of 200 classic race commentaries, a feat he finally achieved at the age of seventy-two.<br>
<br>Bromley's retirement was tragically short. Having spent much of his life in Berkshire, he moved to Essex to be nearer his daughters and grandchildren. There he continued to train gun dogs and to take an interest in field sports but within a year of his final commentary he was diagnosed with cancer of the pancreas. He died at the Oaks Hospital, Oaks Place, Mile End Road, Colchester, on 3 June 2003. He was survived by his second wife, Joanna, and his three daughters.<br>
