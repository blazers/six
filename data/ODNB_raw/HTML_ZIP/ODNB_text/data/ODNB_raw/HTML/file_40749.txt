<span class="headword">Dingwall,  Eric John</span>  (1891?&#150;1986), <span class="occ">anthropologist and librarian</span>, was born in Nuwara Eliya, Ceylon, the only son of Alexander Harvey Dingwall (1860&#150;1936), a tea planter, and his wife, Catherine Emily, formerly Marson (1863?&#150;1932). He seems not to have known his date of birth, but for official purposes would put down 21 April 1891. His death certificate gives his year of birth as 1890. He was educated at Fairleigh School, Weston-super-Mare (his father had retired there), then privately, and at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he read modern languages, taking his BA in 1915 and his MA in 1918. From 1915 to 1918 he worked in Cambridge University Library, becoming an assistant librarian. In 1918 he married Doris Dunn, daughter of S. P. Dunn JP, of Bradfield, Berkshire.<br>
<br>Dingwall came from an affluent family and was astute in financial matters (he left an estate valued at &pound;678,246). This enabled him to engage freely in his many unusual interests, of which the earliest was perhaps conjuring&#151;he joined the Magic Circle in 1909 and ultimately became an honorary vice-president. Related was his interest in the performances of mediums and clairvoyants. In 1920 he joined the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) and in 1921 he went to New York as director of the department of physical phenomena in the American SPR. From 1922 to 1927 he was research officer of the SPR in London. In these two capacities he sat with many notable American and European mediums (mainly physical mediums). His most important reports (all of them negative or noncommittal) are to be found in the <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> of the SPR. In 1922 with Harry Price he republished, with an added bibliography, <span class="italic">Revelations of a Spirit Medium</span> (1891), a classic expos&eacute; of the methods of fraudulent mediums, and in 1927 he brought out a brief handbook, <span class="italic">How to Go to a Medium</span>.<br>
<br>Dingwall's interests and outlook were very different from those of the SPR's ruling body, and disagreements mounted over apparently successful experiments on telepathy for which the classical scholar, Gilbert Murray, had been the subject. Dingwall felt that essential control conditions had been neglected because of Murray's great eminence. In 1927 his tenure as research officer was allowed to lapse. Meanwhile Dingwall had become increasingly interested in anthropology and the study of aberrant human customs, particularly sexual ones. In 1925 and 1927&#150;9 he registered as a research student at the University of London, where his anthropological work, published as <span class="italic">Male Infibulation</span> (1925), <span class="italic">The Girdle of Chastity</span> (1931), and <span class="italic">Artificial Cranial Deformation</span> (1931), obtained him a PhD (1929) and a DSc (1932). He was the &#145;editor&#146; (really the translator and reviser) of the work by H. H. Ploss, M. Bartels, and P. Bartels, <span class="italic">Woman: an Historical, Gynaecological and Anthropological Compendium</span> (3 vols., 1935). All these works, like most of Dingwall's writings, are permeated with great quantities of bibliographical information. During this period he also published two highly characteristic short books, <span class="italic">Ghosts and Spirits in the Ancient World</span> (1930) and <span class="italic">How to Use a Large Library</span> (1933).<br>
<br>From 1935 (by which time his marriage had ended) to 1937 Dingwall travelled extensively in Europe, North and South America, and the West Indies, studying &#145;rare and queer customs&#146;, and &#145;abnormal mental phenomena&#146;. From 1941 to 1945 he was attached to the Ministry of Information and to a department of the Foreign Office, but always remained very secretive about this work.<br>
<br>In 1946 Dingwall offered his services to the department of printed books of the British Museum, and was appointed an honorary assistant keeper. He worked principally on the &#145;private case&#146; of erotic material, to which he added many rarities, often at his own expense. In addition he dealt by post and telephone with numerous enquiries on out of the way subjects, and went on doing so from his home when age made it harder for him to travel. He remained closely in touch with the scientific and medical literature on sexual behaviour, normal, abnormal, and criminal, and would occasionally give lectures on the last to groups of police officers.<br>
<br>Psychical research, which Dingwall saw as a key area in an ongoing struggle between rationality and superstition, continued to intrigue and exasperate him. He was strongly but not undeviatingly sceptical about psychic phenomena. His post-war publications included <span class="italic">Some Human Oddities</span> (1947) and <span class="italic">Very Peculiar People</span> (1950), which contain, <i>inter alia</i>, sympathetic essays, with extensive bibliographies, on such psychic enigmas as St Joseph of Copertino, D. D. Home, and Eusapia Palladino. His trenchant scepticism found expression in <span class="italic">The Haunting of Borley Rectory</span> (with K. M. Goldney and T. H. Hall, 1956) and <span class="italic">Four Modern Ghosts</span> (with T. H. Hall, 1958). <span class="italic">Abnormal Hypnotic Phenomena: a Survey of Nineteenth-Century Cases</span> (4 vols., 1967&#150;8), which he edited and in considerable part wrote, raised the scholarly history of mesmerism and hypnosis to a new level. In 1956 came his most commercially successful book, <span class="italic">The American Woman</span>, an unflattering social and historical analysis which was much resented by its targets, but sold well (no doubt to American men).<br>
<br>On 13 December 1954 Dingwall married a psychologist, Dr Norah Margaret Davis (<i>d</i>. 1976), daughter of Edgar William Davis, clergyman, and a year or two later left Cambridge (where he had lived for over twenty years) to set up home in a pleasant small estate at Crowhurst in Sussex. He had become rather well known. Few people could claim to be an authority on so many different subjects, and few were so ready to pass on information and references. He had, however, certain eccentricities. He was an avid and enterprising collector not just of books, but of photographs, clocks, automata, porcelain, workshop tools, and all sorts of oddments. It was typical of him that he once bought the wreck of a magnificent cage of automaton singing birds from a passing rag-and-bone man, restored it, and ultimately presented it to the British Museum. He tended to see persons and issues in black or white, and would scent plots, deception, and double-dealing rather readily. He did not hesitate to make these opinions known, but beneath his edgy and combative exterior lay a real vein of generosity and kindness.<br>
<br>Dingwall was blue-eyed, of middle height, and spare build, and he possessed a restless energy. Though short-sighted, he was keenly observant. He had a sharp and incisive voice, and was an excellent public speaker and a highly entertaining conversationalist. The death of his wife on Christmas eve 1976, soon after they had moved into a flat in St Leonards, Sussex, was a crippling blow, but with great fortitude Dingwall stayed on alone, working steadily until his own death from heart disease in St Helen's Hospital, Hastings, on 7 August 1986. He arranged to have his carotid artery severed prior to cremation in Hastings.<br>
<br>Dingwall's massive card indexes, his notebooks, and newspaper cuttings, were left to the University of London Library. The bulk of his remaining estate was divided between the British Library and the horological section of the British Museum's department of medieval and later antiquities.<br>
