<span class="headword">Price,  David</span>  (1762&#150;1835), <span class="occ">orientalist and army officer</span>, was born in Merthyr Cynog, near Brecon, where his father, also named David Price (<i>d</i>. 1775), was curate. The latter soon afterwards became rector of Llanbadarn Fawr, near Aberystwyth, and David Price was brought up until the age of six or seven by his grandfather in Brecknockshire. He then joined his parents in Aberystwyth, and began his classical education under his father. In 1775, however, his father died, leaving a widow and five children, of whom David was the eldest boy. He was then educated at Christ College, Brecon, until October 1779, when he was awarded a Rustat scholarship and matriculated on 5 November 1779 as a sizar of Jesus College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>By the summer of 1780, however, Price was nearly penniless (partly through his own carelessness) and had to leave Cambridge. Despairing of his prospects in Britain, he volunteered for the army of the East India Company, in which through the influence of friends of his father he obtained a cadetship. He sailed for India in the <i>Essex</i> on 15 March 1781, and, after an eventful passage  (see Price, 15&#150;26), reached Madras in August. Price was destined for Bombay, but volunteered for temporary service in the south and took part in the siege of Negapatam and the capture of Trincomali in Ceylon as the <i>Essex</i> passed those places. The ship completed its voyage to Bombay on 22 April 1782; in November he was appointed to the 2nd battalion of Bombay sepoys, which, under Captain Daniel Carpenter, did service in Malabar against Tippu, sultan of Mysore, up to the peace of 1784. He was promoted lieutenant in February 1788, and in the next war with Tippu (1790&#150;92) he served in Captain Little's battalion at the siege of Dharwar, where he was severely wounded on 7 February 1791 and lost a leg. He was therefore moved to the guard of Sir Charles Malet, political minister at Poona. In 1792 he was transferred by the governor of Bombay, Jonathan Duncan the elder, to a staff appointment at Surat, where he had enough leisure to develop a keen interest in Persian studies, and began to collect Persian manuscripts and study Persian historical classics such as the <span class="italic">Akbar-namah</span> of Abu'l-Fazl. In 1795, being then brevet captain, he was nominated judge-advocate-general to the Bombay army, a post he retained until his departure from India. He became full captain in September 1797 and served as military secretary and interpreter to Colonel Dow in Malabar (1797&#150;8), where he twice narrowly escaped being cut off. During the last war against Tippu (1799), Price served as Persian translator to the commander of the Bombay army, General James Stuart. He was present at the capture of Seringapatam, and the army appointed him their prize agent to handle the record amount of booty taken; thereafter he was free of financial worries.<br>
<br>After this Price returned to Bombay and resumed his Persian studies. He was promoted major in March 1804, and in February 1805, after twenty-four years' continuous service, he returned to Britain. He finally retired from the East India Company's service on his marriage, to a relative, in October 1807. Thenceforward he lived at Watton House, Brecon, and became a magistrate, and deputy lieutenant of Brecknockshire. He devoted himself to writing long, leisurely works on Arabian, Persian, and Indian history. Of these the best-known and the most important is <span class="italic">Chronological retrospect, or, Memoirs of the principal events of Mahommedan history &hellip; from original Persian authorities</span> (3 vols., 1811, 1812, 1821). This covers the period from the death of Muhammad to the accession of Akbar. The earlier volumes are based chiefly on the Persian chronicles of Mirkhand and Khandamir, and are most detailed and accurate with respect to Persian history; but in the last volume Abu'l-Fazl is largely used. It is written in the over-ornate style of Price's sources, but it is the painstaking work of a genuine scholar anxious to do full justice to his authorities. Without pretending to any striking grasp or generalization, it is nevertheless useful and was for many years almost the only English work of reference for some branches of Eastern history. Price's other main works were his <span class="italic">Essay towards the History of Arabia antecedent to the Birth of Mahommed</span> (1824, from the Persian text of Et-Tabari); the translation of the unique <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Emperor Jahangueir</span> (1829; new edn, 1972); <span class="italic">Account of the Siege and Reduction of Chaitur &hellip; from the Akbar-namah</span> (1831); and <span class="italic">The Last Days of Krishna</span> (1831). These last three were published by the Oriental Translation Fund, of which Price was a committee member, and which awarded him its gold medal in 1830. He also wrote <span class="italic">Memoirs of the early life and service of a field officer on the retired list of the Indian army</span> (published anonymously in 1839). He was a member of the Royal Asiatic Society, to which he bequeathed over seventy valuable oriental&#151;chiefly Persian&#151;manuscripts  (see <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society</span>, [1st ser.,] 3, 1836, xii&#150;xiv). He died at Watton House on 16 December 1835. His widow had a memorial inscribed in Brecon parish church paying tribute to his &#145;unassuming simplicity&#146;, &#145;high moral courage&#146;, &#145;universal benevolence&#146;, and &#145;genuine piety&#146;  (Poole, 312&#150;13).<br>
