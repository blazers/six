<span class="headword">Power,  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1626&#150;1668), <span class="occ">natural philosopher and physician</span>, was born in Annesley, Nottinghamshire, the eldest son of John Power (<i>d</i>. 1638) of Halifax, cloth merchant and landlord, and his wife, Jane (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Jennings). After attending school in Halifax, Power matriculated at Christ's College, Cambridge, on 15 December 1641 when his age was given as fifteen. He graduated BA in 1644 and MA in 1648. At Cambridge the physician and author Thomas Browne, a friend of his father, advised him to pursue medicine, and Power complied, declaring his intention to &#145;review the whole body of Philosophy, especially Naturall&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 256&#150;7), as he did so. Browne recommended that his prot&eacute;g&eacute; read works by Harvey, but also by Paracelsians such as Croll and Hartmann. As a result, even as Power pursued his medical studies he became fascinated by the intricate wonders revealed by practical anatomy, chemical philosophy, and botany. Such interests were being fostered by a number of Cambridge virtuosi, especially the physician Francis Glisson, who had become the focus of a medical and natural philosophical circle in which Power now participated to the full. He came increasingly to feel that the key to appreciating Creation was to be sought in a synthesis of Cartesian and Paracelsian approaches. This was hardly Browne's view; but Power did inherit something of Browne's rich prose style, and his eagerness to draw elaborate imaginative analogies across the natural order.<br>
<br>Power graduated MD in 1655, and settled in Halifax. He married, at a date unknown, Margaret, daughter of Anthony Foxcroft. His interests in natural philosophy and natural history were furthered by friendship with another gentleman impressed by the Cartesian philosophy, Richard Towneley of Towneley Hall, near Burnley. The Towneleys were a Catholic family that had pursued such interests since before the civil war. Now they and Power co-operated in natural philosophy, procuring expensive equipment from London to facilitate their investigations. By 1661, Power said, they had &#145;4 as rare telescopes (as England affordes)&#146;  (Webster, 158). In the 1650s they conducted experiments on the atmosphere, inspired by Jean Pecquet's <span class="italic">Experimenta nova anatomica</span> (Paris, 1651), a primarily medical work that also included an account of Pascal's Puy de D&ocirc;me trial. Their investigations may have led to the issuing of a report in the autumn of 1661 entitled <span class="italic">Mercurial Experiments Made at Towneley Hall in the Years 1660, and 1661</span>; no copies survive, but the report later became part of Power's <span class="italic">Experimental Philosophy</span>.<br>
<br>The nascent Royal Society in London was in need of men such as Power and Towneley. John Tillotson informed the society of their activities; Croune, the society's register, was forthwith ordered to open a correspondence with Power. The latter responded by forwarding some of his by now extensive experimental researches, which were read at the society. The experiments on air were of especial interest, since they arrived at a moment of international controversy over Robert Boyle's researches on the subject. The society immediately recruited Power as a helper in its experimental and natural historical work, and he was elected a fellow on 1 July 1663 (having been proposed as early as May 1661).<br>
<br>Power visited the society in June 1663, and demonstrated his microscopical observations before the virtuosi. During his London stay he arranged for publication of these and other observations by the society's new &#145;printers&#146; (strictly speaking, booksellers), John Martyn and James Allestry. The result was Power's only surviving publication, the book on which his reputation is founded: <span class="italic">Experimental Philosophy</span> (1664 [1663]). This work incorporated material dating back over the previous decade. Its three books dealt respectively with microscopy, the air, and magnetism. Its reputation, then and since, has chiefly rested on the first of these, which was the first book in English about microscopy, and included a number of pioneering descriptions of microscopic observations.<br>
<br>However, Power's descriptions were soon eclipsed by the splendidly illustrated pages of Robert Hooke's <span class="italic">Micrographia</span>, which meant that the source of <span class="italic">Experimental Philosophy</span>'s initial fame was also the cause of its later obscurity. Readers inevitably tended to assume that both books were aiming at the same ends, and that Hooke's was &#145;an aggrandized version of the <span class="italic">Experimental Philosophy</span>&#146;  (Webster, 161). Yet Power's elaborate descriptions were really more akin to the literary conceits of Browne than the visual world of Hooke (Samuel Butler used Power's style as a vehicle for satirizing the experimental enterprise in general). Power's descriptions were perhaps intended as aids to a kind of rhapsodic reflection while readers peered through microscopes, rather than as substitutes for such observing. When Samuel Pepys read Power, for example, he did so with a new microscope to hand, as he and his wife struggled together to master &#145;the manner of seeing anything&#146; through it  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, ed. R. Latham and W. Mathews, 1970&#150;83, 5.241); this experience does not seem to have been the case when he read Hooke. Moreover, in Power's eyes the sections on the air and magnetism were also important. Each illustrated a central element of his peculiar Cartesian/Helmontian philosophy: infinite divisibility, the elasticity of air (and the absurdity of a vacuum), and the use of electricity and magnetism to refute a geostatic cosmology such as that of Jacques Grandami.<br>
<br>The publication of his research marked the peak of Power's involvement with the London experimental community. In 1664 he transferred his medical practice to Wakefield, and contacts with both the Towneleys and the Royal Society diminished. In relative seclusion, Power synthesized his earlier work on anatomy and chemical physiology into a general treatise, which he entitled <span class="italic">Historia physico-anatomica</span>. Dedicated to Lord Delamere, it was never published, and was preserved only in manuscript. Its explanations were couched in terms of the kind of circulating system beloved of mid-seventeenth-century thinkers. Power envisaged &#145;Animal Spirits&#146; that were subtle enough to bridge the divide between the corporeal and the incorporeal. These spirits were a central unifying theme of the <span class="italic">Experimental Philosophy</span>. Simultaneously both physical and chemical, Power believed that they had been the first products of Creation. They permeated the universe, circulated within the bodies of all living creatures, and were &#145;the main (though invisible) Agent in all Natures three Kingdoms Mineral, Vegetal, and Animal&#146;  (Power, 61).<br>
<br>Power died in December 1668, and was buried on 23 December at the church of All Saints, Wakefield. His work shows both the variety of opinions among the first generation of experimental philosophers and the vitality of natural philosophy beyond London and the Royal Society. Power's philosophy was a creative appropriation of both Paracelsian and Cartesian principles, inspired by what may always have been his prime interest, medicine.<br>
