<span class="headword">Waithman,  Robert</span>  (1764&#150;1833), <span class="occ">political reformer</span>, was born at Wrexham, Denbighshire, Wales, the son of John Waithman (<i>d</i>. 1764), a joiner, of Bersham, and Mary Roberts, who married on 29 January 1761. When Robert was only four months old, his father died; in September 1776 his mother married Thomas Mires, a furnaceman, of Bersham. At an early age Waithman was placed under the instruction of a Mr Moore by his uncle, before moving to Reading about the year 1778 where he worked as a shop assistant and then to London where he was apprenticed in the trade of a linen draper. In 1786 he opened his own store at the south end of Fleet Market, later moving his business to other premises at the corner of Fleet Street and New Bridge Street from which he reportedly amassed a considerable fortune by the time of his retirement. On 14 July 1797 he married his first cousin, Mary Davis (1761&#150;1827), of Red Lion Street, Holborn, with whom he had several sons.<br>
<br>The outbreak of the French Revolution aroused Waithman's interest in politics and he honed his oratorical skills about 1792 as a frequenter of a debating society at Founders' Hall in Lothbury, in the City. His first real taste of politics came as a liveryman of the Framework Knitters' Company when he was elected as a common councilman for the ward of Farringdon Without in December 1795, although his public career had begun on 23 January 1795 when he seconded a successful motion at a common hall against the war with France. Maintaining his position on peace, a petition for an end to the revolutionary war presented by Waithman was approved by the livery on 19 February 1800 and he published his arguments in the same year as a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">War proved to be the cause of the present scarcity, and enormous high price of every article of consumption, with the only radical remedies</span>. About this time, Waithman was involved in founding the Society of the Independent Livery of London, along with a number of prominent common councilmen and liverymen of the City of London as well as Thomas Hardy, the founder of the London Corresponding Society. The Independent Livery emerged as a significant lobbying group in City politics, championing the cause of the people at a time of high prices, pushing for a petition campaign against the war and for parliamentary reform, and seeking a repeal of income tax. Waithman was an influential member of the Independent Livery, frequently voicing his ideas on reform at this level, although he was unsuccessful in 1802 when he campaigned as parliamentary candidate for the organization.<br>
<br>Waithman carried his reformist ideas further in 1805 when he proposed at a common hall that a petition be presented to parliament for an inquiry into fiscal management, successfully carrying a petition to parliament on this issue three years later as well as an address to George III for an investigation into the convention of Cintra. In 1808 he also published a <span class="italic">Letter to the Governors of Christ's Hospital</span>, which revealed that places in the school were being reserved for children of wealthy parents, in exchange for political patronage, rather than being left vacant for those with lower incomes. Within a year he had called for complete parliamentary reform and on 6 June 1810 he carried a motion to petition the House of Commons on the issue of political representation. He regularly supported radical occasions and dinner meetings; he was among a group of over 1200 people which assembled at a reformist dinner held in the Crown and Anchor tavern on 1 May 1809. Later that year he attended the anniversary dinner commemorating the acquittals at the treason trials of 1794 and at much the same time he became acquainted with the freethinking banker&#150;brewer Timothy Brown, and with William Cobbett through a subscription committee for Gwyllym Lloyd Wardle. For six years, between 1809 and 1814, he was also convener of annual dinners of a group known as the Livery of London, Friends of the Constitutional Reform of Parliament, and one of his speeches to the common council on electoral reform and the management of public money was published in 1817.<br>
<br>Despite his public reformist stance, Waithman made sure that he distanced himself from more radical elements of the reform movement during the Regency years. As such he conducted a running battle against the active Spencean movement, engaged himself in a prolonged confrontation with Henry Hunt, and disengaged himself from the philosophical tenets of Robert Owen. He did, nevertheless, openly support issues associated with the liberty of the press at a time when radical publicists such as Thomas Wooler, William Hone, and Richard Carlile faced prosecution. On 29 December 1817 he attended a dinner at the City of London tavern to celebrate &#145;trial by jury and liberty of the press&#146; and he participated in opening a subscription for the embattled William Hone.<br>
<br>With his success as a City politician, Waithman also acquired an interest in parliamentary politics. After two abortive campaigns in the early nineteenth century, he contested the 1812 election as a candidate for the City of London but was defeated. Six years later, however, he was voted as one of the four City representatives, defeating the tory candidate, Sir William Curtis. Making his d&eacute;but in parliament on 25 January 1819, Waithman advocated a revision of the criminal code and a notable speech on parliamentary reform made on 1 July of that year was published in 1823. Soon after his election, in July 1818, he was chosen as alderman for his ward of Farringdon Without, replacing the deceased Sir Charles Price, but failed to regain his parliamentary seat in 1820. Despite this loss and his failure in 1831 to be elected city chamberlain, Waithman was successful, during the intervening years, in attaining the post of sheriff of London and Middlesex in 1820&#150;21, during which time he sided with the popular radicals in support of Queen Caroline; he was re-elected to parliament in 1826 and retained his seat at the elections of 1830, 1831, and 1832. Moreover, he served as lord mayor of London between 1823 and 1824, a term of office satirized by his political opponents in <span class="italic">Maxims of Robert, Lord Waithman, Somewhile Chief Magistrate of London</span> (1824).<br>
<br>Throughout his political career, Waithman was a consistent advocate of peace, triennial parliaments, and an extension of the suffrage to taxpaying householders as well as a vocal anti-cornlaw campaigner. These sentiments alienated him from more conservative whigs and the tories stigmatized him as something of a rabble-rouser. By contrast, popular radicals such as William Cobbett and Henry Hunt, Waithman's long-time adversary, thought his reform programme was too moderate in not calling for annual parliaments and universal suffrage. Waithman's distance from most members of the radical fraternity is exemplified by the view expressed by Samuel Bamford, who, in recalling his introduction to Waithman about 1820, described him as &#145;a dissatisfied, bilious looking man. He had recently experienced some provoking opposition in the city, and seemed as if both mind and manners were soured. I had no desire to meet him again&#146;  (Bamford, 232). Most contemporaries, however, would have agreed with the assessment of Waithman's career offered by <span class="italic">The Times</span> newspaper on the occasion of his death:<blockquote>The magistracy of London has thus been deprived of one of its most respectable members, and the city of one of its most upright representatives. &hellip; His natural parts, his political integrity, his consistency of conduct, and the energy and perseverance with which he performed his duties, placed him far above the common run of persons whose reputation is gained by their oratorical displays at meetings of the Common Council. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 Feb 1833, 3)</blockquote>Waithman died, at the age of seventy, on 6 February 1833 at his house in Woburn Place, London. Eight days later, an impressive cort&egrave;ge of twenty-seven carriages proceeded from the Guildhall to the church of St Bride, Fleet Street, where Waithman was buried. To perpetuate his memory, Waithman Street in London was named in his honour and a subscription was raised by the St Bride's Society to set up an obelisk as a testimonial to his political importance. The obelisk was erected in June 1833 at the southern end of Farringdon Street, opposite the site of Waithman's first shop, and following relocation to Bartholomew Close in 1951 it was resited in Salisbury Square in 1972 where it now stands.<br>
