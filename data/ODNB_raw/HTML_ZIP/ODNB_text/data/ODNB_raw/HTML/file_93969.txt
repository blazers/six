<span class="headword">Smeathman,  Henry</span>  (1742&#150;1786), <span class="occ">explorer and entomologist</span>, was born in Scarborough, Yorkshire, on 9 February 1742, the youngest of eight children born to William Smeathman, a distiller and brandy merchant, and his wife, Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Redhead. William and Alice had married on 29 January 1732 at St Benet Paul's Wharf, London, and had later moved to Scarborough. Henry Smeathman was baptized on 13 February 1742 at the Old Meeting House, the Independent chapel in Scarborough, as were his four brothers and three sisters: William (1734), Charles (1735), Rebecca and Alice (1737), Thomas (1738), Alice (1740), and John (1741). From an early age Henry Smeathman showed an interest in natural history and sketching, and according to his sister-in-law, Elizabeth (married to his brother Thomas), he was keen to learn and improve himself. After the early death of his father, Smeathman was educated by a curate in Scarborough, and after the curate's death was taken under the care of Philip Sharp, a friend of his late father's. He worked at various jobs, among them cabinet-making and upholstery, and at some time worked as an insurance broker. He then went to live with his brother Thomas and his wife, Elizabeth, and studied theology  (Pettigrew, 252). At some point during the 1760s Smeathman undertook a course in elocution and grammar with Mr Rice, which he later practised, and recommended to others in the pages of <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> (1781). By 1768 he had obtained a post as a tutor for a gentleman's family in Birmingham. By this time he had met the naturalist John Abbot, and seems to have made contact with members of the Aurelian Society, in particular Dru Drury.<br>
<br>The second Aurelian Society was formed in 1762, with the artist and entomologist Moses Harris as secretary. As well as Drury, members included the Linnaean-trained naturalist Daniel Solander, the gardener and nurseryman James Lee, the naturalist Emanuel Mendes da Costa, and Smeathman. This society, dedicated to the study and collection of insects, continued until 1766 and its members witnessed the word &#145;entomologist&#146; enter common usage. By cultivating relationships with natural historians from the society, Smeathman was able to benefit from their expertise, and gain access to prestigious eighteenth-century entomological collections. In 1771 Smeathman was sponsored to make a journey to Sierra Leone and the Guinea coast, primarily for the collection of specimens, in particular, insects. His main sponsors were Dr John Fothergill, Dru Drury, and Joseph Banks. Margaret Cavendish Bentinck, duchess of Portland, later became a sponsor.<br>
<br>Smeathman left England on 26 October 1771, on board the <i>Fly</i>, a trade ship carrying barrels of rum to West Africa. He spent the years 1771 to 1775 based in Sierra Leone; his main residence being on the Banana Islands, off the coast of Sierra Leone. The Banana Islands were the home of James Cleveland, an African-European slave trader who supplied hospitality and became Smeathman's protector. During his years in Sierra Leone, Smeathman collected thousands of specimens&#151;mainly insects&#151;which he dispatched, to Drury, aboard the trade ships departing from Bunce Island, the British slave-trading establishment in the Sierra Leone River estuary. Smeathman also sent plants to Linnaeus in Sweden. While in Sierra Leone Smeathman explored the coastal and riverine areas; he also travelled to the Isles de Los. He kept a journal and regularly corresponded with Drury and other naturalists. He undertook a territorial surveillance of the region and made a number of geographical, botanical, zoological, and ethnographic observations, which he recorded in his journals and letters. He studied termites, experimented with rice cultivation, and planted a botanical garden. He married (by native custom) into one of the African-European slave-trading families in the Sherbro district of Sierra Leone; no further details of his wife are known. He was known as the Flycatcher, a term which was used to describe insect collectors. His account of the difficulties connected with collecting, preserving, and transporting specimens in tropical countries is related in Dru Drury's <span class="italic">Illustrations of Natural History</span> (vol. 3, 1782), which also figures some of Smeathman's specimens.<br>
<br>Smeathman left Sierra Leone, and his wife, in early 1775 and travelled aboard a trade ship <i>en route</i> to England via the West Indies. He arrived in Tobago as the American War of Independence was beginning. An American vessel captured the ship in which he was returning home and Smeathman lost his books and collections. He remained in the West Indies for a further four years, studying plantation agriculture, collecting specimens, and attempting to eradicate cane ants which were causing devastation to the sugar plantations on certain islands. Large rewards were offered at the time for ridding the islands of these ants. Smeathman proposed using &#145;train oil&#146;, oil made from the blubber of large whales, as a means of killing the ants and the aphids they feed on. Like other proposed remedies, this did not work, and it was the hurricane of 1780 that eventually destroyed this particular blight or &#145;blast&#146; of sugar pests.<br>
<br>Smeathman returned to England in August 1779. He proposed to publish an account of his travels in Africa and the West Indies, and a printed prospectus for this unpublished work is in the British Library. During the late 1770s and early 1780s debating societies flourished in London, and Smeathman not only gave lessons in oratory, but also opened his own debating society, the Lyceum, in 1781. At the beginning of that year he presented his treatise on tropical termites to the Royal Society. His address at this time was Clements Inn. Published in <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> in February 1781, Smeathman's &#145;Some account of the termites found in Africa and other hot climates&#146; was the first detailed account of tropical termites, their life cycles and habits. Smeathman's hand-coloured sketches of the internal structure of the termite mound, the royal chamber, and the different types of termites accompanied his handwritten account, and these sketches were engraved by James Basire for the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>. Smeathman's treatise on tropical termites demonstrated his expertise in entomological knowledge at a time when entomology was developing into a separate and distinctive field of study within the wider discipline of zoology. This groundbreaking treatise later earned him the title of Father of Termitology  (M. Maeterlinck, <span class="italic">The Life of the White Ant</span>, 1929, 19). It was published as a separate volume by John Nichols in 1781; a French translation appeared in Paris in 1786, and a German in G&ouml;ttingen in 1789.<br>
<br>Apart from his interest in natural history and, in particular, entomology, Smeathman was concerned with the possibility of creating a settlement in Sierra Leone. Having, as he said, seen &#145;equinoctial lands in a state of nature&#146; in Sierra Leone, and Caribbean islands in &#145;high cultivation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of John Fothergill</span>, 580), in 1783 Smeathman proposed a settlement in Sierra Leone for former slaves and other free men, based on plantation agriculture. He had continually made connections and comparisons across tropical regions&#151;between termites, polyps, edible insects, cultivation, and people. Thus human colonies built on plantation agriculture in the Caribbean, he reasoned, could be replicated in Sierra Leone (though without the need for slave labour). He wrote to the Quaker physician Thomas Knowles regarding his proposal; but his Quaker friends, as pacifists, were unwilling to support his plan as it involved the settlers being supplied with arms. Smeathman was unable to find British sponsors for his &#145;plan of settlement&#146; and by the end of 1783 he was in Paris, lecturing on termites at the (French) Royal Society of Physicians, seeking subscribers for a proposed book on his voyages and travels, and sponsors for his settlement plan. While in Paris he took part in balloon experiments and drew a design of a Montgolfier balloon with wings. He hoped to finance his African plan with proceeds from his invention of an aerostatic vessel, which could be directed in flight. Unsuccessful in obtaining sponsorship for any of his projects, Smeathman returned to England at the end of 1784, and in 1785 he obtained the post of secretary to the newly formed (and short-lived) General Chamber of Manufacturers of Great Britain, whose chairman and founder was Josiah Wedgwood.<br>
<br>In 1786 Smeathman's plan of settlement for Sierra Leone was published. The Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor and Granville Sharp championed Smeathman's plan, which in May 1786 the Treasury agreed to finance. Smeathman himself was appointed agent for the enterprise. The settlers were to be drawn mainly from London's black poor population, many of whom were freed slaves. The project was regarded as philanthropic, and was supported by many abolitionists and evangelicals. Smeathman died of fever on 1 July 1786, at his apartments in Cannon Street, London; he had previously suffered from malaria in Sierra Leone and the Caribbean. Smeathman's dual role in the worlds of natural history and colonial policy was reflected in his obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. His death delayed the expedition to Sierra Leone for some months; eventually Smeathman's clerk, Joseph Irwin, was appointed agent, and the first ship of settlers arrived in Sierra Leone in May 1787. The settlement, in and around Freetown, was taken over by the Sierra Leone Company in 1790 and in 1808 Sierra Leone became a crown colony. Thomas Winterbottom's <span class="italic">An Account of the Native Africans in the Neighbourhood of Sierra Leone</span> (vol. 1, 1803) included Smeathman's &#145;Some account of the termites&#146; as an appendix.<br>
<br>Smeathman's collecting activities resulted in thousands of specimens being transported from west Africa to Europe, to enhance the cabinets of his sponsors and other naturalists and collectors. Joseph Banks named a species of passion fruit tree after him (<i>Smeathmannia</i>), and Johan Christian Fabricius named a species of moth after him (<i>Pyralis Smeathmanniana</i>). Smeathman's unpublished papers at the Linnean Society include a paper on the Sierra Leone tarantula (with an illustration by Moses Harris); a paper on polyps; an account of the harmattan wind; and a table of the weather at the Banana Islands. His unpublished journals and correspondence, together with a paper entitled &#145;Useful hints for those who intend to visit or settle in Africa and other hot climates&#146;, were later transcribed by Adam Afzelius, a pupil of Linnaeus who followed in Smeathman's footsteps in Sierra Leone, and are contained in the library of Uppsala University in Sweden.<br>
<br>Smeathman was a pioneer in African entomology at a time when African insects were rare in British cabinets. He combined natural history investigation with an agrarian improvement programme, and his plan of settlement for Sierra Leone laid the blueprint for what was to follow in that country's colonial history.<br>
