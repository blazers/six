<span class="headword">Ayscough,  George Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1779), <span class="occ">soldier and author</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/951/', "Francis Ayscough (1701&#150;1763)")</script>, dean of Bristol and sometime preceptor to Prince George, and his wife, Anne (1714&#150;1776), daughter of Sir Thomas Lyttelton and sister of George, first Baron Lyttelton. Ayscough was commissioned in the 1st regiment of foot guards, from which he obtained leave in September 1769, perhaps on grounds of ill health, to tour the continent. An anonymous account of his travels entitled <span class="italic">Letters from an officer in the guards to his friend in England: containing some accounts of France and Italy</span> was published in 1778. Ayscough journeyed through France and Italy with &#145;a curiosity to see mankind in all situations&#146;  (Ayscough, 54). His itinerary took him to Lyons, Avignon, Provence, and Marseilles, from where he took ship for Genoa and went on to Pisa. In Italy he also visited Florence, Rome, and Venice (which greatly disappointed him), Padua, Verona, Milan, and Turin before crossing the Alps.<br>
<br>Ayscough's admission in his memoir that his &#145;way is always to speak [his] mind, right or wrong&#146; signals a judgemental, bullish personality, whose outbursts appear comic to the modern reader. Of the French he writes:<blockquote>During this and several former expeditions to the Continent, I have studied the manners of the French nation, and I have found them volatile, even to a degree of childishness. To all <i>rules</i> there are, doubtless, exceptions; but a Frenchman is, in general, an unlettered prejudiced fop. (Ayscough, 23)</blockquote>Reflecting on his experiences in Rome he writes:<blockquote>I felt a kind of enthusiastic delight at the first sight of Rome, but this was dampened by the recollection that this city, which was once inhabited by a nation of heroes and patriots, was now in the hands of the most effeminate and superstitious people in the universe. (ibid., 140)</blockquote>Nevertheless he records, with evident satisfaction, having met Pope Clement XIV in Rome, and having received his benediction.<br>
<br>By June 1772 Ayscough seems to have been resident in St Anne's parish, Westminster. He was promoted to the Order of the Bath and made an application to the College of Arms to confirm his right to bear the arms of Ayscoughs, which can be traced to a branch of the family resident in Yorkshire in the fourteenth century. On 4 January 1774 he sold the manuscripts of his late uncle, Lord Lyttelton, and publishing rights, to James Dodsley for a down payment of &pound;250 plus &pound;150 payable within six months. Dodsley agreed to pay a further &pound;200 if the miscellaneous <span class="italic">Works</span> of Lord Lyttelton, edited and published by Ayscough in the same year, were produced by him as a second edition. The surviving portion of a letter from James Bate to his sister dated 5 March 1774, put into a commonplace book kept by members of the Ayscough family during the eighteenth century, seems to indicate that Ayscough married&#151;his wife's maiden name may have been Cockburn&#151;and had a son. Bate refers to Ayscough having become &#145;unfortunate&#146; which, in view of his transactions with Dodsley, may refer to financial difficulties.<br>
<br>In December 1776 Ayscough's version of Voltaire's tragedy <span class="italic">S&eacute;miramis</span> (1748) was staged at Drury Lane. The play, dedicated to Ayscough's brother-in-law Sir James Cockburn and published by J. Dodsley, incorporated an epilogue by Richard Sheridan. The editor of the <span class="italic">London Review</span> dismissed the piece as &#145;not worth quarrelling about&#146;  (Kendrick and others, 466). Nevertheless, Ayscough's tragedy was performed eleven times, earning the author three crowded benefit nights. It appears that Ayscough recruited his brother officers to attend the first night of the play and he addressed them directly in his prologue, promising them &#145;<i>(this great bus'ness ended) / He'll gladly re-assume the</i> Sash <i>once more</i>&#146;. Ayscough died on 14 October 1779.<br>
