<span class="headword">Coleridge,  John Duke</span>, first Baron Coleridge  (1820&#150;1894), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at 7 Hadlow Street, London, on 3 December 1820, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5887/', "Sir John Taylor Coleridge (1790&#150;1876)")</script>, barrister and judge, and his wife, Mary (1788&#150;1874), the daughter of the Revd Gilbert Buchanan DD, vicar of Northfleet and rector of Woodmansterne. Reporting his birth in a letter to John May  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. lett. c. 289 ), his father observed &#145;The Lord Chancellor for 1865 made his appearance this morning about 6&#146;. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5881/', "Henry James Coleridge")</script> was his younger brother. Coleridge was educated at Eton College (from which he was very nearly expelled for an unspeakable offence in May 1833) and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was elected a scholar in 1838. He was a frequent speaker at the Oxford Union, of which he was president in Michaelmas term 1843. On 27 February 1840 he moved a motion highly critical of the way in which the House of Commons was handling the issue of parliamentary privilege. His speech impressed the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, and the motion was carried by fifty votes to nine. He was also a member of the Decade, a select debating society in Balliol, whose other members included Jowett, Clough, and Matthew Arnold. He took a keen interest in the Tractarian movement and was profoundly influenced by John Henry Newman. Severe and prolonged illness in 1842 interrupted his studies and he graduated with an ordinary pass degree. Ill health was a recurrent feature of his life, assailing him in 1855, when he became recorder of Portsmouth; in the form of typhus in October 1859; most dramatically in March 1863, when he was taken suddenly ill in the middle of a case at Exeter assizes; and in the long vacation in 1871 in the middle of the Tichborne trial. He took his MA in 1846, however, and was elected to a fellowship at Exeter College, which he held from 1843 until his marriage on 11 August 1846 to Jane Fortescue Seymour, third daughter of the Revd George Turner Seymour of Farringford Hill on the Isle of Wight, and sister of his Balliol contemporary, J. B. Seymour.<br>
<br>Coleridge was called to the bar by the Middle Temple on 6 November 1846, and practised from chambers in 3 King's Bench Walk until 1864. It was a difficult time for a young barrister with a family and with uncertain health. In 1847 there were nearly twice as many barristers on the western circuit as there had been thirty years earlier; the <span class="roman">County Courts Act</span> 1846 had removed the small cases, and there was a general lack of civil business. The turning point in Coleridge's career came at Exeter assizes in March 1853 with his defence of George Sparkes, the Clayhidon murderer. He made a brilliant speech, ending with a quotation from <span class="italic">Othello</span> and the words of the communion collect, which &#145;produced an immense sensation&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). As his seniors, Montague Smith, Robert Collier, and Thomas Phinn, took silk, he built up a large junior practice. In 1855 he resisted the temptation to become clerk of the assize on the midland circuit, and was appointed recorder of Portsmouth, a position he held until 1866. By the summer of 1860 he had the largest junior practice on the western circuit. In that year his fees reached &pound;4000.<br>
<br>Coleridge was reluctant to apply for silk because of the risks involved, but in February 1861 Lord Chancellor Campbell offered a silk gown both to him and to his fellow Devonian, personal friend, and professional rival, John Karslake. They took silk together on 25 February 1861 and were elected together as benchers of the Middle Temple. The western circuit had never been stronger than it was in those years. The leader was Montague Smith, a future judge of the common pleas and the privy council, and there were three future attorneys-general, Collier, Karslake, and Coleridge. Those four completely dominated the circuit, and when Karslake became solicitor-general in 1866 Coleridge became leader of the circuit until 1868. He relied heavily on his juniors, Montague Bere and, especially, Charles Bowen, who first appeared before him at Portsmouth sessions in October 1861. In 1867, the last full year before he became solicitor-general, his fees amounted to &pound;12,200.<br>
<br>Coleridge was always politically ambitious. In August 1847, when Gladstone was elected for Oxford University, Coleridge was joint secretary of his London committee. For many years he was tempted to enter parliament himself. By education and family background he was a high-church tory, and he was approached several times as a candidate in the Conservative interest. But over the years his churchmanship became broader and his politics more liberal. &#145;Democratic feeling and convictions only strengthen with me every year I live &hellip; <i>Delenda est aristocratia</i>&#146;  (letter to Sir William Heathcote, 19 August 1860, Coleridge, <span class="italic">Life and Correspondence</span>, 1.259&#150;60). He was finally adopted as Liberal candidate to contest Exeter at a by-election in 1864 and though defeated after a short and rough campaign, which convinced him of the necessity for the ballot, he won the seat at the general election in the following year. He made his maiden speech on 21 March 1866 to propose the second reading of the <span class="roman">Tests Abolition (Oxford) Bill</span>, and he was actively involved in the campaign to abolish religious tests in the universities until it finally succeeded in 1871. Oxford University made him a DCL in 1877, and Exeter College elected him to an honorary fellowship in 1882. In the same parliament he made major speeches against marriage with a deceased wife's sister, which he opposed firmly throughout his life, and, at Gladstone's request, moved the instruction at the committee stage of the 1867 <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> to impose a &pound;5 annual rating limit on the franchise.<br>
<br>Re-elected for Exeter after a tight contest at the general election in November 1868, Coleridge was asked by Gladstone to be solicitor-general. He refused, apparently because of friction between himself and Collier, the attorney-general, on circuit many years before. When his refusal became public and Gladstone insisted, he agreed to accept the office, and was knighted (12 December 1868).<br>
<br>In the new parliament Coleridge spoke again on university tests and in favour of Irish church disestablishment and also on law reform; but much of his time was occupied with private practice. He was leading counsel for the plaintiff in <i>Saurin v. Starr</i>, the convent case, which lasted most of February 1869. He obtained a verdict of &pound;500 damages, and finally established his professional reputation in London. He successfully defended Overend and Gurney against a charge of fraudulent conspiracy in a nine-day trial in December in the same year. His income in 1869 was over &pound;19,000. From May 1871 to March 1872 he spent an enormous amount of his time on the Tichborne case, with the able and devoted assistance of Charles Bowen, to the detriment of both men's health. His cross-examination of the plaintiff lasted three weeks, and his opening speech for the defendants lasted twenty-three days. By painstaking attention to detail he was able to overcome the widespread public bias in favour of the claimant, and the jury stopped the case on 6 March 1872. His attention to the case was hardly distracted in November 1871 when Collier was appointed to the court of common pleas and then immediately to the privy council, and Coleridge became attorney-general. On 3 May 1872 the practice of allowing the law officers to devote so much time to their private practice was attacked in the House of Commons, and Coleridge made a characteristically eloquent and successful defence.<br>
<br>In November 1873 Chief Justice Bovill died suddenly, worn out, it is said, by the Tichborne case, and Gladstone appointed Coleridge as chief justice of the common pleas and gave him a peerage (the only chief justice of the common pleas since 1688 to receive a peerage, apart from Lord Gifford in 1824). When Sir Alexander Cockburn died on 20 November 1880, Gladstone, who had returned to power that year, appointed Coleridge as lord chief justice of England in his place, and the offices of chief justice of the common pleas and chief baron of the exchequer (vacant by the death of Sir Fitzroy Kelly) were abolished. &#145;He [Gladstone] did nothing for me till I entered Parliament, but he did everything for me afterwards&#146;, Coleridge commented in a letter to Grant Duff, on 16 November 1886  (Coleridge, <span class="italic">Life and Correspondence</span> 2.354).<br>
<br>Soon after Coleridge's appointment to the bench his mother, father, and wife (a distinguished portrait painter whose sitters included J. H. Newman) died in quick succession (1874, 1876, and 6 February 1878 respectively). He was devastated and for a while withdrew from society, and rifts began to appear in his family. Particular difficulties arose over his daughter, Mildred, who met Charles Warren Adams, secretary of the Anti-Vivisection Society, of which Coleridge was a keen supporter. The rest of her family thought that he was thoroughly undesirable, and when she left home to live with him, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32489/', "Bernard John Seymour Coleridge (later second Baron Coleridge)")</script> wrote her a long letter to say so. This led to two libel actions in the Queen's Bench Division, for two days in November 1884 and for eight days in November 1886, when the chief justice was sued in his own court and all the family linen was washed in public. Mildred married Charles Adams on 24 June 1885. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32491/', "Stephen William Buchanan Coleridge")</script>, the third of Coleridge's four children, also became a prominent anti-vivisectionist.<br>
<br>In August 1883 Coleridge went to America as a guest of the New York Bar Association and visited New York, Boston, Chicago, and Washington. He had always been interested in America and had a number of American friends, like Ellis Yarnall, with whom he corresponded for forty years. On his way home he met Amy Augusta Jackson, daughter of Henry Baring Lawford, of the Bengal civil service. They were married on 13 August 1885. With her he found happiness again. He died at his London home, 1 Sussex Square, on 14 June 1894 and was buried at Ottery St Mary on 22 June. His second wife died on 24 May 1933.<br>
<br>Coleridge presided over the trial of many <i>causes c&eacute;l&egrave;bres</i>: <i>Lonsdale v. Yates</i>, the <span class="italic">World</span> libel case in 1884; <i>R. v. Dudley &amp; Stephens</i>, who had killed and eaten the cabin-boy, the only case in which a sentence of death has been passed in the Royal Courts of Justice (1884); <i>Wood v. Cox</i>, the racing libel case (1888); <i>O'Donnell v. Walter</i> (1888); and the great Baccarat case, <i>Gordon-Cumming v. Wilson</i> in which the prince of Wales gave evidence in court (1891). But he did not leave his mark on English law. He rarely sat on appeal, and, since cases tried on circuit were no longer reported, his decisions in civil and criminal cases on circuit have not been preserved. He was not a great lawyer: indeed his close friend Jowett went so far as to say: &#145;I don't think him a first rate intellect&#146;  (Quinn and Prest, 93). And his administration of the Queen's Bench Division left much to be desired. But he will be remembered for his silver-tongued eloquence and as a trial lawyer, both at the bar and on the bench.<br>
<br>Coleridge was tall and handsome, and had an extremely beautiful voice. His language was refined and forcible, and no one could, on occasion, produce a greater sense of solemnity with less effort. He had an abrasive manner, which not infrequently caused friction with his colleagues, but no one could have been more loyal to his friends. He had a great love and wide knowledge of English literature, especially of the poetry and drama of the Elizabethan period. During his early years at the bar he wrote for <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, and the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>; and there were frequent literary quotations in his speeches at the bar and in parliament, and in his judgments and summings-up on the bench. William Butterfield designed an enormous and splendid library for him at his Devonshire seat, Heath's Court, Ottery St Mary, to contain 12,000 volumes, including a substantial collection of Elizabethan literature.<br>
