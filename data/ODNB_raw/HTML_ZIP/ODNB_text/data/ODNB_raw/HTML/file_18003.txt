<span class="headword">Mante,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1733, <em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1802), <span class="occ">army officer and historian</span>, was baptized Thomas Mant on 3 December 1733 at St Faith's parish church, Havant, Hampshire, the eldest of the eight children of Thomas Mant (1702&#150;1768), an estate manager, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1781), the daughter of the Revd Joseph Bingham (1668&#150;1723), rector of St Faith's, Havant, a church historian and antiquarian, and his wife, Dorothea Pococke (1672&#150;1755). Nothing is known of his early years until his appointment as senior second lieutenant of the 94th company of marines on 25 June 1756. On 1 November 1759 he transferred to the 56th company of marines as its junior first lieutenant. As a marine officer he participated in the West Indies campaigns of 1759 and 1762, and by 7 June 1762 he was one of seventeen assistant engineers engaged by the earl of Albemarle for the siege of Havana. By 24 June 1762 he was a lieutenant in the 77th regiment of foot, which left for New York late in August 1762 after the capture of Havana from Spanish forces. Following the peace of 1763 newer regiments such as Mant's 77th were disbanded, but Mant's company joined Colonel Henry Bouquet's campaign against Pontiac's coalition of Native American tribes during the summer of 1763. His next post was brigade major in Colonel John Bradstreet's expedition in 1764 to make peace with Pontiac's coalition.<br>
<br>Having been placed on half pay, Mant spent the years 1765&#150;73 primarily in London working on numerous projects. As agent for John Bradstreet, now a general in America, he worked unsuccessfully from 1765 to 1768 with the Board of Trade to set up a colony in Detroit with himself as lieutenant-governor and Bradstreet as governor. He was also unable to earn an adequate income, and his constant borrowing from Bradstreet and Sir Charles Gould, judge advocate-general of the army, alienated these powerful figures who might have advanced his career. Mant was employed during this London period by John Robinson, secretary of the Treasury and head of foreign intelligence, to gather intelligence concerning a possible war with France. On 29 June 1769 he married Mary Silver at St Peter's parish church, North Hayling, near his ancestral home of Havant.<br>
<br>Mant's first period in London is noteworthy for his literary activity. He prepared four books for the press: his masterpiece, the <span class="italic">History of the Late War in North America</span> (1772) and three translations of works on military tactics by Colonel Joly de Maizeroy or his school, <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Use of Defensive Arms</span> (1770), the two-volume <span class="italic">System of Tactics</span> (written in 1769&#150;71, though not published until 1781), and the <span class="italic">Elementary Principles of Tactics</span> (1771). The three works on military science provide the theoretical foundation for his <span class="italic">History</span>, and the four works should be regarded as a tetralogy of 1600 pages offering an epic portrait of men at war. His <span class="italic">History</span> has been widely praised by historians, and some passages have been quoted repeatedly, such as the description of the horrors of thirst and yellow fever at the siege of Havana in 1762. Mante changed the spelling of his name between 1770, when his <span class="italic">Defensive Arms</span> was published under the name Thomas Mant, and 1772, when his <span class="italic">History</span> was published under the name Thomas Mante.<br>
<br>The change in name reflects Mante's permanent move in 1773 to Dieppe, Normandy, where he had lived intermittently since 1769. In 1769 he had been recruited by General Grant de Blairfindy, who regarded him as &#145;peut &ecirc;tre le plus grand g&eacute;nie de l'Europe&#146;  (Cole, 102), to spy for the French ministry of war against Britain. Mante was in the employ of the French authorities until 1774, when payments stopped because of suspicions that he was a double agent. However, he was still able to work in France as an excise officer and then, during the years 1775&#150;8, as the owner of an estate near Dieppe for raising British sheep. This project was a failure, and in 1778 Mante's heavy indebtedness threw him into debtors' prison. He was nevertheless able to convert his failure as a farmer into a book, published in 1778 as <span class="italic">Trait&eacute; des prairies artificielles, des enclos, et de l'education des moutons de race angloise</span>. The work was officially approved by the keeper of the great seal, and Louis XVI gave his &#145;Am&eacute; le sieur de Mante&#146;  (Cole, 120) and his heirs the privilege to publish. From debtors' prison Mante inscribed a copy to Benjamin Franklin, American ambassador to France in 1778, from whom he received several gratuities.<br>
<br>After being released from prison early in 1781, Mante returned to London destitute and in poor health. He was rebuffed by both family and friends as a traitor, but he found a new friend in the London publisher Thomas Hookham, who in 1781&#150;2 published Mante's novels <span class="italic">Lucinda</span> and <span class="italic">The Siege of Aubigny</span>, which were paraphrases from French sources. Mante's main effort during this second London period, however, was his monumental <span class="italic">Naval and Military History of the Wars of England</span> (<i>c</i>.1795&#150;1807). While relying heavily on the histories of Hume and Smollett in the early volumes, he trusted his own expertise in volumes 5 and 6 covering the wars of 1714&#150;71. His account of the Seven Years' War in America, in which he had been both participant and chronicler, however, lacks the richness of detail so characteristic of his earlier <span class="italic">History</span>. Mante wrote only half of volume 7, and an unnamed editor completed volume 7 and wrote volume 8, covering the period 1791&#150;1807. Mante died about 1802 while working on his seventh volume and after publishing under a pseudonym nineteen essays entitled &#145;Retrospect of the eighteenth century&#146; in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1800&#150;01).<br>
