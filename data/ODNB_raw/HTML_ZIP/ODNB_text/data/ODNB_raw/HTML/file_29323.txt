<span class="headword">Whittaker,  George Byrom</span>  (1793&#150;1847), <span class="occ">publisher and bookseller</span>, was born on 6 February 1793 at New Alresford, Hampshire, the eldest of five children of George Whittaker (1761&#150;1833), Church of England clergyman and headmaster, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Budd (1769/70&#150;1827). Whittaker's father was well remunerated from 1795 as headmaster of Southampton grammar school, and he was the author of several popular educational works, amassing sufficient wealth to advance several thousand pounds to his son. In 1807 Whittaker was apprenticed to Charles Law, a long-established and prosperous wholesale bookseller and publisher of 13 Ave Maria Lane, London, and on obtaining his freedom in 1814 he acquired the business, trading under the name Law and Whittaker until 1818. The concern was greatly enlarged under Whittaker's vigorous management, and he became one of the three leading wholesalers serving the country trade. Within a decade he had also expanded the publishing side of the business to such an extent that Thomas Frognall Dibdin bracketed it together with Longman &amp; Co. as one of &#145;the two greatest Publishers in England&#146;  (Dibdin, xii), an accolade supported by evidence that Whittaker was second only to Longmans in the numbers of new titles listed in the <span class="italic">English Catalogue of Books</span> for this period.<br>
<br>Part of the reason for this success was capital investment, and in 1826 it was estimated that Whittaker possessed copyrights which had originally cost him &pound;160,000, and which were still worth at least &pound;63,000. Much of the capital came from his brother, William Budd Whittaker, who was a partner in the firm from 1818 to 1824, but other members of the family also invested heavily in the business, and in 1826 their total holding was valued at &pound;53,534. In addition, Whittaker had a reputation as a kindly and approachable man, who established relationships of considerable trust with his authors, and it is also evident that he made some inspired business decisions. About 1821, for instance, he acquired for a price estimated to be in excess of &pound;30,000 the copyrights of the hapless William Pinnock's sixty-four educational catechisms, which continued to sell in extraordinary numbers throughout Whittaker's lifetime, the more so since many were carefully and extensively edited by his own, often celebrated, authors. He also possessed a third share (estimated to be worth &pound;5600) in the copyrights of another failed publisher and educational author, Sir Richard Phillips. These purchases indicate Whittaker's particular strength in educational publishing, a speciality inherited from Law; in addition to elementary and school books (including some of his father's), he published numerous works intended for university students. These were generally published in partnership with the university booksellers, especially J. and J. J. Deighton in Cambridge, and included both mathematical and classical works. However, Whittaker's publishing business was general in nature, and included numerous literary works. One of his earliest literary discoveries was Mary Russell Mitford, whose immensely successful first novel, <span class="italic">Our Village</span>, he began to publish in 1824.<br>
<br>Whittaker's commercial standing was such that he was elected sheriff of London and Middlesex on 24 June 1823, when only thirty years old. His personal wealth was considerable, and he reportedly possessed seven hunters. However, in the autumn of 1825 he was defrauded by an American-born writer, William Grenville Graham, who had forged bills in Whittaker's name. When the forgery was discovered, Whittaker's bankers demanded a list of his acceptances, and discovered that he had ventured an extensive and unsuccessful speculation in hops. Although the business was still fundamentally sound, the state of financial panic then prevailing resulted in his being denied the usual amount of discount, and as a result he had to stop payment. His debts and liabilities were estimated at over &pound;270,000, but the creditors agreed to leave the management of Whittaker's affairs in the hands of trustees (Self &amp; Co.), in preference to a commission of bankruptcy. Whittaker continued to trade, with financial assistance from the printer Richard Gilbert, who had married his sister Anne in 1823, and was even able to persist with the publication of his splendid edition of Georges Cuvier's <span class="italic">Animal Kingdom</span> (16 vols., 1827&#150;35), for which the translation and the engraving of the plates alone cost &pound;7000. The trustees administered his affairs well, soon restoring him to his old position in the trade, and at the end of 1828 he was released by his creditors, although they had not received the full debt.<br>
<br>Whittaker was allowed to purchase the remainder of his copyrights, and resumed business in partnership with David Gale Arnot (until 1835) and Joseph Skipper Treacher (until 1838), soon also being joined by William Cumber Hood. The new firm flourished, and in 1830 supplanted Simpkin and Marshall as Robert Cadell's London partner in the publication of the collected edition of Sir Walter Scott's <span class="roman">Waverley</span> novels (48 vols., 1829&#150;33). It also continued to attract new literary authors, among them Frances Trollope, whose <span class="italic">Domestic Manners of the Americans</span> (2 vols., 1832) passed through four editions in a year. The later years of Whittaker's life were reportedly not characterized by the activity of his youth, but he did continue to cultivate some larger projects, including John Payne Collier's new edition of Shakespeare's works (9 vols., 1844). He died of cholera on 13 December 1847 at his home, 20 Upper Phillimore Place, Kensington, London, and was interred in the catacombs at Kensal Green cemetery. Whittaker never married, and most of his property passed at his death to Anne and Richard Gilbert, the business being continued by his nephew Robert Gilbert, in partnership with William Cumber Hood.<br>
