</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilson, Sir  Henry Hughes</span>, baronet  (1864&#150;1922), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born on 5 May 1864 at the family home of Currygrane, near Edgeworthstown, co. Longford, Ireland, the second son of the seven children of James Wilson (1832&#150;1907), a landowner, and his wife, Constance Grace Martha, eldest daughter of James Freeman Hughes of Stillorgan, co. Dublin. Wilson came from a modestly prosperous protestant family who had settled in co. Antrim in the seventeenth century, made money in the Belfast shipping trade, and by the early nineteenth century had become established as landowners in co. Dublin, co. Westmeath, and co. Longford. He was educated at home by a succession of French governesses before attending Marlborough College from 1877 to 1880.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Although he was set on soldiering Wilson failed the entrance exams for both the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and eventually entered the army through the Longford militia. He passed the examination for the regular army in 1884 and secured a commission in the prestigious rifle brigade; the following year he joined the 1st battalion in India. He was a strikingly tall figure, about 6 feet 4 inches in height, lean, and fit, who took much pleasure in the hunting&#150;shooting&#150;fishing pleasures of his age and class. As a subaltern he gained a reputation for cleverness and quick wit. He was also inclined to bursts of buffoonery which both entertained and unsettled his more straight-laced colleagues. In May 1887, while engaged in policing duties along the Irrawaddy River in Burma, he was seriously wounded over his right eye, and towards the end of the year he was invalided home. The scar from this injury added to his craggy features which led his rifle brigade colleague John Cowans to name him &#145;the ugliest officer in the Army&#146;  (Callwell, 2.10). While on sick leave in Ireland he became engaged to Cecil Mary Wray (1862&#150;1930) of Kingstown (later D&uacute;n Laoghaire), co. Dublin, daughter of the late George Gore Wray, who had been a land agent and modest landowner. Wilson spent much of his sick leave and subsequent service with the 2nd battalion working for the Staff College entrance exam, which he passed in May 1891; and on 3 October he married Cecil Wray, who for the rest of his life remained a constant support and inspiration in both his army career and his Irish Unionist political sympathies. They had no children.<br>
<br>Wilson's successful completion of the two-year Staff College course in 1893 set him on an army career which was mostly spent in staff appointments. Indeed he emerged as one of the ablest staff officers of his generation. For three years from 1894 he served in the intelligence department of the War Office as the army's youngest staff officer. From 1897 to 1899 he held the coveted brigade majorship of the 3rd infantry brigade at Aldershot which became the 4th light brigade in the force dispatched to South Africa following the outbreak of the South African War in 1899. Wilson saw action at the disastrous battle of Colenso during &#145;black week&#146; in December 1899, and also the defeat at Spion Kop in January 1900. By all accounts he did well, and certainly impressed his brigade commander, Major-General Neville Lyttelton. After the relief of Ladysmith (at which he was present), Lord Roberts, the commander-in-chief in South Africa, a fellow Irishman who was to prove a valuable patron, took Wilson onto his staff, eventually as assistant military secretary. Wilson accompanied Roberts home at the end of 1900 and remained with him for a further year.<h2>
<a name="WarOfficeandStaffCollege"></a>War Office and Staff College</h2>After a year of regimental duty commanding the 9th provisional battalion at Colchester (February 1902 to February 1903), Wilson returned to the War Office, where he served as assistant adjutant-general for military education and training and assistant director of staff duties (1903&#150;6). Here he was part of a group of army officers who had experienced the manifest staff deficiencies exposed by the South African War and who were pressing for administrative reform in the British army, particularly the establishment of a general staff, more or less on the German model. By 1906 this had been achieved as part of the army reforms introduced by the new secretary for war, Richard Burdon Haldane. Within the War Office, Wilson's responsibilities covered military education, which fitted him well for his next appointment: as commandant of the Staff College with the rank of brigadier-general. From 1907 to 1910 he was an inspiring and notably successful commandant. The post admirably suited his gifts as a teacher: his infectious enthusiasm, his ready wit, and his genius for lecturing. Reflecting his own penchant for sweeping political and strategic analysis, he encouraged his students to think expansively. One recalled how he &#145;fascinated us by his sparkling brilliance, his interest in outside affairs, his personality. He lifted us bodily out of the rut of everyday soldiering&#146;  (Nicholson, 169). Wilson also stressed practical exercises, such as staff tours and battlefield visits, though a thoroughgoing emphasis on pure practical staff work was left to his successor as commandant, William Robertson.<br>
<br>One of Wilson's greatest concerns during these years was to prepare the British army for what he regarded as the inevitable war between France and Germany. A life-long Francophile, Wilson believed&#151;like many other soldiers&#151;that Britain's place was at France's side. He spent a number of holidays cycling along the Franco-German frontier to familiarize himself with the territory threatened by a German invasion. His unusually close friendship with the French general Ferdinand Foch, whom he first met in 1909, did much to facilitate close Anglo-French co-operation, then and later. His command of the French language, which he spoke willingly and enthusiastically, if not always absolutely accurately, also marked him out from most other senior British officers.<h2>
<a name="Directorofmilitaryoperations19101914"></a>Director of military operations, 1910&#150;1914</h2>Wilson became director of military operations (DMO) in the War Office in August 1910. Here his devotion to the French alliance had its impact on British strategic policy making. Military conversations, approved by the army's political masters, about the possibility of the British providing direct assistance to the French had begun in 1905, but only under Wilson did they assume real substance. Despite the growing strength of the entente with France, opinions in London were divided as to the action Britain should take in the event of a Franco-German conflict. A strong lobby, naturally well represented in the Admiralty, held to the traditional &#145;blue-water&#146; strategy, by which military intervention on the continent was to be avoided and Britain's naval strength deployed to enforce a blockade on the enemy. For the navalists, not to mention those attracted to isolationism, a direct &#145;continental commitment&#146; such as that proposed by Wilson was anathema.<br>
<br>These differences came to a head at a celebrated meeting of the committee of imperial defence on 23 August 1911 prompted by the Agadir crisis. Here Wilson deployed all his brilliance as a lecturer lucidly to explain the War Office plans to send British forces to help the French repel a German advance. He completely outshone the first sea lord, Sir Arthur Wilson, whose exposition of the Admiralty's apparently inchoate plans for blockade and possible amphibious operations against Germany signally failed to impress the politicians, who decided in favour of the War Office. Armed with this support Wilson devoted his energies to perfecting the detailed arrangements for deploying the British expeditionary force (BEF) in northern France. In April 1913 he observed that his two immediate predecessors as DMO had secured permission<blockquote>to &#145;work out all the details&#146; of a scheme of combined operations with the French against the Germans. When I became D.M.O. I conceived it to be my most important duty to continue this work and so far as human foresight was possible to complete a scheme which would be at once useful and practical. (Wilson MSS, HHW 3/7/2)</blockquote>In this he succeeded.During these years Wilson, who was promoted major-general in November 1913, began to dabble in political matters. He actively supported the campaign for compulsory national service headed by his old chief Lord Roberts. A widening circle of acquaintances included a number of key Conservative opinion makers. Leopold Amery and Lord Derby, old friends from South African days, were joined by H. A. Gwynne (editor of the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>), Bonar Law, Lord Milner, Geoffrey Robinson (editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>), and back-bench MPs such as Sir Charles Hunter. Wilson was passionately committed to the political union between Ireland and Great Britain. Along with Roberts he was very sympathetic to the armed resistance to home rule being planned by Ulster Unionists in the years immediately preceding the First World War, and he played a central (if ultimately somewhat equivocal) role in the &#145;Curragh incident&#146; of March 1914, when a number of army officers with Unionist convictions resigned their commissions rather than follow orders which they believed were aimed at coercing Ulster into a home rule Ireland. Throughout the crisis Wilson worked behind the scenes in support of the Ulster cause (though he stopped short of resigning) and kept leading opposition politicians fully informed of developments.<h2>
<a name="TheFirstWorldWar"></a>The First World War</h2>On the outbreak of war in August 1914 Wilson became sub-chief of the general staff of the BEF under Sir Archibald Murray. The successful mobilization of the force and its deployment to France was perhaps his greatest military achievement. Murray's health soon broke down and Wilson effectively took charge of the BEF headquarters staff. Although he was occasionally pessimistic, during the nightmare retreat from Mons his cheerfulness and good spirits are said to have played a crucial role in keeping up morale at the British headquarters. He also maintained very close communication with Foch, who by this time was deputy to the French commander-in-chief. Although Sir John French, the commander of the BEF, was keen to replace Murray with Wilson, both Lord Kitchener (secretary for war) and Asquith (prime minister) objected to the move. Wilson's activities during the Curragh incident had earned him a reputation for intrigue which blackened him in the eyes of Liberal politicians and some army colleagues (including Sir Douglas Haig, who succeeded Sir John French in December 1915).<br>
<br>In January 1915 Sir William Robertson became chief of staff and Wilson was appointed chief liaison officer to the French headquarters. This was an important job which Wilson did well, but it did not fully stretch his capabilities, nor did it provide much of an outlet for his restless intelligence. He remained in close touch with many military colleagues and politicians at home, to whom he indiscriminately expressed his trenchant views about the deficiencies of the higher direction of the war. He felt that Asquith was an insufficiently vigorous prime minister and increasingly came to believe that Lloyd George would make a much better war leader.<br>
<br>Like many others Wilson did not foresee that the conflict would turn into a long war of attrition. Having persistently pressed for conscription in Britain before the war, he at first ridiculed Lord Kitchener's drive to raise a mass volunteer army, fearing that the concentration on raising &#145;shadow armies&#146; at home would &#145;prevent a lot of good officers, N.C.O.s and men from coming out&#146; to France  (Callwell, 1.178). It soon became clear, even to Wilson, that there would be no quick conclusion to the war, though he continued to believe that conscription (eventually enforced in 1916) was the only fair and effective means to raise the manpower required. During 1915 his relations with both Kitchener and Asquith improved. Kitchener began to consult him regularly, and on the day Wilson was knighted (KCB) Asquith gave him a private interview&#151;&#145;He listened very attentively, &amp; in the end was very civil&#146;  (Wilson, diary, 1 July 1915). In August Wilson was offered the command of a corps, but turned it down after French told him that both he and Kitchener particularly valued his liaison work and preferred him to stay in his existing position.<br>
<br>At the end of 1915 Sir John French was replaced as commander-in-chief of the BEF by Sir Douglas Haig, who in December gave Wilson command of 4th corps, a formation based around B&eacute;thune which saw little action during his command, as all energies were concentrated on the Somme to the south. It was the only time, apart from his service as a subaltern in Burma, when he commanded troops in the field. Wilson worked hard at training and his celebrated talks came to be much in demand. One officer noted a lecture on &#145;&#147;Days before the war&#148; &hellip; extraordinarily funny with many dirty stories!&#146;  (diary of Captain L. Beaumont Tansley, 17 April 1916). In May when his immediate superior, General Monro, went on leave Wilson temporarily took charge of the First Army. His reputation suffered when an enemy attack captured three-quarters of a mile of his line near Vimy Ridge and a planned counter-attack was vetoed by Monro on the grounds that it would be too costly. Haig seems to have counted this&#151;among other things&#151;against Wilson, for when Monro was posted to Mesopotamia in August, Wilson was passed over for the command of the First Army. In October, moreover, the corps was reduced to a headquarters and put into the reserve.<br>
<br>On 1 December 1916 Wilson was selected to be the British military representative on a full-scale Anglo-French mission to Russia, a belated attempt to shore up the eastern ally. The mission stayed in Russia for only a short time during January and February 1917 and in retrospect the exercise was almost completely futile. Any arrangements were quickly overtaken by revolution, which Wilson anticipated. &#145;According to all the accounts I get&#146;, he wrote in his diary on 31 January, the emperor and the empress &#145;are heading straight for ruin&#146;  (Wilson, diary).<br>
<br>After Lloyd George became prime minister in December 1916 Wilson's fortunes rose. Although by no means blind to his faults, Lloyd George thought Wilson &#145;had undoubtedly the nimblest intelligence amongst the soldiers of high degree&#146;. Because of &#145;his lucidity of mind and therefore of expression&#146;, which was denied to his military colleagues, &#145;he was specially helpful in a council of civilians&#146;  (Lloyd George, 5.2818). The prime minister used Wilson as an alternative source of military advice to either Haig or Robertson, who had been chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) since December 1915. On his return from Russia, Wilson, with the rank of lieutenant-general, once again became chief liaison officer at the French headquarters (March 1917). Here he did much to improve relations between Haig and General Nivelle, but when the French spring offensive in Champagne failed badly Nivelle was replaced by P&eacute;tain, who mistrusted Wilson as a Nivellite and declared him <i>persona non grata</i>. In June Wilson resigned the appointment and returned to London. For the next two months he was unemployed and even toyed with the notion, raised by some of his Conservative friends, of going into parliament. This option was put to one side when at the beginning of September he accepted the eastern command, with its headquarters in London, from Robertson. Wilson remained at the centre of affairs.<br>
<br>All through 1917 Wilson pressed Lloyd George&#151;and anyone else he could buttonhole&#151;to improve the co-ordination of allied policy making. Lloyd George was attracted to the idea of some sort of high level inter-allied body, not only because it might make the prosecution of the war more efficient, but also as a mechanism for restricting the powers of Robertson and Haig whom he personally held responsible for the inconclusive and costly progress of the war in the West. In October the serious Italian reverse at Caporetto brought the matter of allied co-ordination to a head, and early the following month the prime minister secured French and Italian consent to the creation of a supreme war council which would supervise policy at a high level. Wilson, with the temporary rank of general, became the British permanent military representative (1 December 1917), a position in which he now challenged Robertson as the government's chief military adviser.<br>
<br>Over the next two months the supreme war council completed much useful, mostly prosaic, work in the co-ordination of the allied war effort. Little of this was particularly contentious, but in January 1918 Wilson developed a scheme for a combined general reserve of troops for the western and Italian fronts which provoked a fierce debate as to who should control it. Against Robertson's strenuous objections the council accepted Wilson's plan (backed by Lloyd George) for an executive war board, comprising the permanent military representatives, to control the proposed reserve. Robertson refused to work under the new arrangement and Lloyd George took the opportunity to manoeuvre him out of his position and replace him with Wilson, who became CIGS with effect from 18 February 1918.<h2>
<a name="ChiefoftheImperialGeneralStaff"></a>Chief of the Imperial General Staff</h2>For the next year or so Henry Wilson was at the centre of British military and strategic policy making, in a position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> Lloyd George akin to that of the cabinet secretary, Sir Maurice Hankey. He saw the prime minister virtually every day, and attended cabinet meetings on a regular basis. Much has been made (not least by Lloyd George himself) about the struggles in the First World War between the &#145;Frocks&#146; (politicians) and the &#145;Brasshats&#146; (soldiers), particularly over strategic matters. In fact Robertson and Wilson did not differ markedly in their strategic analysis. Both men knew that the western front was the crucial theatre of operations for the defeat of Germany; both also appreciated that Britain's imperial interests required the commitment of troops in other places, especially in the Middle East. The main difference between them lay in their relations with the prime minister and his colleagues. Robertson believed that war strategy should be left entirely to the military and he was most reluctant to share the views of the general staff with civilians. Wilson had fewer such scruples and possessing &#145;a talent for explicit statement rare among tongue-tied soldiers&#146; was able to &#145;hold his own in debate with any politician&#146;  (Buchan, 4.174). The supersession of Robertson by Wilson also marked the increasing truth of the adage, as Clemenceau was fond of quoting, that &#145;war is too serious a business to be left to soldiers&#146;. In circumstances approaching &#145;total war&#146;, where all national resources, civil as well as military, have to be mobilized the civilian leaders have unequivocally to take charge and to employ military leaders able and willing to work with them. For these individuals military skills were less important than the sort of political skills at which Sir Henry Wilson excelled.<br>
<br>The main crisis of Wilson's time as CIGS&#151;the great German push which began on 21 March 1918&#151;at last, with the appointment of Foch as &#145;generalissimo&#146;, prompted the unification of allied military command for which Wilson had long been pressing. When the offensive ran out of steam, and even after the allies began to advance in August, the speedy collapse of the enemy caught many by surprise. As late as mid-October Wilson thought that the German army was &#145;<i>not</i> beaten&#146;  (<span class="italic">Military Correspondence</span>, 56). Following the armistice of November 1918 he spent much time in Paris heading the military section of the British delegation to the peace conference. Lloyd George continued to consult him on a very frequent basis, for example when drawing up the &#145;Fontainebleau memorandum&#146; (March 1919), which laid down important guidelines for the peace treaty with Germany. In July 1919 Wilson was promoted field marshal, and in August he was created a baronet, receiving the thanks of parliament and a grant of &pound;10,000.<h2>
<a name="Afterthewar"></a>After the war</h2>Wilson's status as an intimate prime ministerial adviser, however, did not very long survive the end of the peace conference in mid-1919. Once Lloyd George turned to wider questions of domestic and foreign reconstruction, Wilson's value as a confidant began to decline. Faced with an overextended empire in the aftermath of the war, and an upsurge of internal dissent, all Wilson could recommend was &#145;get out of those places which do not belong to you and cling on like hell to those which do&#146;  (Jeffery, 50). Although he was uncompromisingly anti-communist, he did not, like his political master Winston Churchill (secretary for war, 1919&#150;21), support direct British intervention on the anti-Bolshevik side in the Russian civil war. Nor did he favour committing British troops to propping up client regimes in the Middle East, or (as Lloyd George favoured) to underpin Greek hegemony around the Aegean Sea. He became increasingly gloomy about the prospects for Britain and the empire. &#145;And so we are off into the New Year&#146;, he confided to his diary on 1 January 1920, &#145;&amp; if L.G. &amp; his wretched Cabinet do not take up the reins and <i>whip</i> of Government we shall be in a worse mess this day year&#146;  (Wilson, diary).<br>
<br>Wilson was especially exercised about the fate of Ireland. He would contemplate no policy there other than the forcible crushing of Sinn F&eacute;in and the IRA, though he heartily deplored the indiscipline and excesses of the paramilitary &#145;Black and Tans&#146; who were brought in to reinforce the Royal Irish Constabulary. He was disgusted when Lloyd George decided to negotiate with the Irish nationalist leaders in mid-1921 and he simply refused to speak to the prime minister for the rest of his time as CIGS. When Sir Henry retired in February 1922 he became a member of the United Kingdom parliament for the Northern Ireland constituency of North Down, but had scarcely begun his new political career when he was assassinated (22 June 1922) by two Irish republicans on his doorstep at 36 Eaton Place, London. He was given a state funeral and was buried in St Paul's Cathedral, London, on 26 June. Irish concerns suffused most of Wilson's activities towards the end of his life. His appointment as security adviser to the new Northern Ireland government reflected the regard in which he was held by Ulster Unionists. For all his militant unionism, however, he retained a strongly held opinion&#151;not always welcome in Belfast&#151;that the maintenance of security in the province should be as non-sectarian and as disciplined as possible.<br>
<br>The shocking circumstances of Wilson's death served to inflate his reputation, which remained high until the injudicious publication in 1927 of numerous extracts from his diaries in C. E. Callwell's official biography, <span class="italic">Field-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson, his Life and Diaries</span>. The impression given by the quotations was that of an overambitious, self-serving monster, with such violent passions and prejudices as to appear at times actually unbalanced. Subsequent assessments have generally dismissed Wilson as little more than Lloyd George's willing and pliant pawn, though Bernard Ash's biography, <span class="italic">The Lost Dictator</span> (1968), proposed that had he lived Wilson might have emerged as a quasi-fascist political leader. At the end of his career Sir Henry Wilson was a disappointed man. In the army he had, perhaps, been a frustrated politician and as it turned out he had little chance to prove himself in the House of Commons. Reporting on Wilson speaking in parliament, Austen Chamberlain noted that the field marshal, &#145;as always, was incisive, dangerous and mischievous&#146;  (Chamberlain to Winston Churchill, 11 May 1922, Chamberlain MSS, AC 35/1/11). It seems that these qualities both contributed to his achievements and undermined them. Although a very able and articulate man, he was too mercurial&#151;and too obsessed with Irish affairs&#151;to inspire wholehearted trust among all his military and political colleagues.<br>
