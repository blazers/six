<span class="headword">Hughes <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Rogers]</span>,  Victoria</span>  (1897&#150;1978), <span class="occ">lavatory attendant and author</span>, was born on 22 June 1897 at Woodbury Lane, off Blackboy Hill, Bristol, the fifth of ten children of Alfred William Rogers, a scaffolder, and his wife, Ellen Rogers. She was educated at Anglesea School in nearby Worrall Road, Clifton, and, like many Bristol girls in the early twentieth century, took her first job in the Wills tobacco factory in Bedminster. It was on her regular walk to work that she met Richard Hughes (1896&#150;1965), an apprentice ironmonger. His family disapproved of their subsequent engagement, so he moved in with hers. They married on 16 July 1916, the day that Richard left for the Somme with the Royal Berkshire regiment. After the armistice he returned to Bristol suffering from trench foot, a limp, and failing eyesight. Jobs were scarce even for the fully fit, and Victoria eventually became the main breadwinner for her husband and their two daughters, Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1920) and Barbara (<i>b</i>. 1931).<br>
<br>Hughes was, in her own words, &#145;a homely little housewife&#146; who attended a church fellowship and led a happily conventional existence, with hobbies like sewing, cycling, and &#145;the ambitious kind&#146; of cooking. But she found unexpected fame at the age of eighty as the author of <span class="italic">Ladies' Mile</span> (1977), a book of personal reminiscences which revealed a hitherto hidden aspect of the city's social life. Although the book reportedly shocked Bristol's civic dignitaries when it was published and serialized in a local newspaper, it has since been acknowledged as a valuable contribution to the city's social history.<br>
<br>For thirty-three years until her retirement in May 1962 Hughes worked as what she described as a &#145;loo lady&#146; at a public convenience in Stoke Road on Bristol's Durdham Downs. Her official duties involved issuing tickets, cleaning, and selling sanitary supplies. Although she considered her work a lowly&#151;even embarrassing&#151;way to make a living, in the summer of 1929 she welcomed the opportunity to earn 4<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. for two days a week at the toilets next to Clifton suspension bridge. She was eventually offered the full-time post at Stoke Road for 2 guineas, paid in cash every Thursday. There she realized that many of the women who regularly visited the lavatory were involved in prostitution on the nearby Ladies' Mile.<br>
<br>Nothing in her upbringing had prepared Hughes for these encounters, which both shocked and fascinated her. Though always resolutely respectable herself, she became a companion and confidante to scores of prostitutes during her time as an attendant. She cheered them up with tea and sympathy in her little office where she kept a kettle and her knitting, and helped them out of difficult and dangerous situations with money, advice, and, occasionally, direct intervention. In a collection of notebooks she recorded with compassion and humour the events and characters involved in Bristol's sex trade between the depression and the early 1960s. The notebooks formed the basis for <span class="italic">Ladies' Mile</span>, whose editor, David Foot, described it as the work of an &#145;honest, loyal, hard-working and unworldly&#146; author who &#145;happened to be a first-class observer with a natural turn of phrase, wry and happily unsophisticated&#146;  (p. vii). Hughes herself maintained that there was<blockquote>nothing especially sensational about prostitution &hellip; As a maritime city, Bristol's whores have usually found it a good market place. But what went on among the trees on the Downs before, during and after the last war is still, I feel, a little piece of the city's history.</blockquote>To the women she met Hughes hoped that she<blockquote>showed some compassion &hellip; They, in turn, gave me a sort of companionship and warmth &hellip; My job was to take the pennies and not to moralise. I'll leave others to huff and puff about what went on.  (pp. 58&#150;9)</blockquote>From 1958 the Hughes family lived in a terrace house at 255 Gloucester Road, Bishopston, Bristol, which was where Victoria died from cancer on 30 August 1978. She was cremated at Canford cemetery, Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol, on 6 September. On 22 September 2003 a Bristol city council blue plaque was unveiled above the door of the Stoke Road ladies' toilets, commemorating &#145;Victoria Hughes (1897&#150;1978), who befriended and cared for prostitutes when she worked here as a lavatory attendant from 1929 to 1962&#146;.<br>
