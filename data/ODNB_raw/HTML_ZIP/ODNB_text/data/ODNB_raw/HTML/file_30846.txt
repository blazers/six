<span class="headword">Abrahams,  Doris Caroline</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Caryl Brahms]</span>  (1901&#150;1982), <span class="occ">writer and songwriter</span>, was born at 28 Morland Road, Croydon, Surrey, on 8 December 1901, the only child of Henry Clarence Abrahams, a wholesale jeweller, and his wife, Pearl, one of the twenty-one children of Moses and Sultana Levi, who had arrived in England from Constantinople about 1873. She was educated privately, at Minerva College in Stonygate, near Leicester, and at the Royal Academy of Music, where she failed her LRAM. At the academy, already an embryo critic, she did not care to listen to the noise she made when playing the piano. She began to write light verse for a student magazine and then for the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>. At this time she adopted her pseudonym so that her parents, who envisaged a more domestic future for her, would be unaware of her literary activities; she became generally known as Caryl Brahms.<br>
<br>Ballet class as a child and her later exposure to the Diaghilev Ballet in the south of France encouraged Brahms to apply to Viscountess Rhondda to write ballet criticism for <span class="italic">Time and Tide</span>. She also wrote on opera and the theatre for the same newspaper, the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, and many others. In 1930 Gollancz published her volume of children's verse, <span class="italic">The Moon on my Left</span>.<br>
<br>At this time Brahms met S. J. Simon (Secha Jascha Skidelsky), a White Russian student of agriculture, an international bridge player, and an inspired humorist. In the early thirties they contributed captions for &#145;Musso, the home page dog&#146; cartoons by David Low in the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>. In 1936, during which Brahms also edited a popular primer, <span class="italic">Footnotes to the Ballet</span>, they collaborated on a novel, <span class="italic">A Bullet in the Ballet</span> (1937), their classic comedy thriller which introduced the Stroganoff Ballet Company. Another Stroganoff novel, <span class="italic">Casino for Sale</span>, followed in 1938. <span class="italic">The Elephant is White</span> (1939) again deployed a cast of eccentric Russian <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</i>. In 1940 they hit on a new and original vein of wild, anachronistic, historical humour with <span class="italic">Don't, Mr Disraeli!</span> (1940), a novel set, &#145;not in the Victorian Age but in its literature&#146;. They brought a similar approach to the Elizabethan age in <span class="italic">No Bed for Bacon</span> (1941). Their other novels were <span class="italic">No Nightingales</span> (1944), <span class="italic">Six Curtains for Stroganova</span> (1945), <span class="italic">Titania has a Mother</span> (1944), and <span class="italic">Trottie True</span> (1946). A stage version of <span class="italic">A Bullet in the Ballet</span>, starring L&eacute;onide Massine and Irina Baronova, foundered in Blackpool.<br>
<br>In 1948 Brahms and Simon had just begun their last collaboration, <span class="italic">You Were There</span> (1950), when Simon died suddenly. Brahms finished the book alone, continued to write fiction, and increased her criticism of theatre and opera as well as ballet. Her collected book of theatre notices, <span class="italic">The Rest of the Evening's my Own</span>, was published in 1964. She followed it with <span class="italic">Gilbert and Sullivan</span> (1975) and with <span class="italic">Reflections in a Lake</span> (1976), a study of Chekhov's four great plays.<br>
<br>In 1954 Brahms had met Ned Sherrin, who asked permission to adapt <span class="italic">No Bed for Bacon</span> as a stage musical. Seeing that he challenged no comparisons with Simon, she suggested a collaboration. The production of the musical at the Bristol Old Vic was not a success but it laid the foundation of a partnership which over the next twenty-eight years produced seven books, many radio and television scripts, and several plays and musicals for the theatre including <span class="italic">I Gotta Shoe</span> (1962&#150;3), <span class="italic">Sing a Rude Song</span> (1970), <span class="italic">Liberty Ranch</span> (1972), <span class="italic">Nickleby and me</span> (1975), <span class="italic">The Spoils of Poynton</span> (1968, from Henry James), and latterly <span class="italic">Beecham</span> (1980) and <span class="italic">The Mitford Girls</span> (1981), both of which had respectable West End runs.<br>
<br>In her sixties, Brahms's enthusiasm for ballet waned. She became a devotee of show-jumping and the All-England course at Hickstead took the place of Covent Garden in her life as she argued that the horses moved more gracefully than contemporary ballerinas. She also began to write songs for the BBC television programme <span class="italic">That Was The Week That Was</span> (1962) and, as a lyric writer, she won an Ivor Novello award (1966) for the title song of <span class="italic">Not So Much a Programme More a Way of Life</span>. Her song compilations were a feature of <span class="italic">Side by Side by Sondheim</span> (1976) and the television series <span class="italic">Song by Song</span> (1979&#150;80). The latter also became a book (1984). In 1978 she was appointed a governor of the National Theatre.<br>
<br>Physically Brahms's aspect seemed not to change for the last three decades of her life, until a noticeable enfeeblement in the last two years. She was dark, tiny, with a very prominent nose on which she permanently perched large dark, forbidding spectacles. Her pouter-pigeon figure and thrust-forward chin matched her combative approach to life. She sparred energetically with colleagues and bank managers and conscientiously encouraged young artistes. Her work with Simon will surely survive as an example of the most sensitive and innovative comic fiction during the middle years of the twentieth century. She died of heart failure on 5 December 1982 at her home, 3 Cambridge Gate, Regent's Park, London. She was unmarried.<br>
