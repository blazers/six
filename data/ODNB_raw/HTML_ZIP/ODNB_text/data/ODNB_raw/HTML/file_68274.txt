<span class="headword">Crane,  Elizabeth</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1606), <span class="occ">religious activist</span>, was the eldest daughter of Sir Robert Hussey of Linwood, in Lincolnshire, who died in 1546, and his second wife, Dame Jane. Born towards the end of the reign of Henry VIII, she seems to have married Anthony Crane, a clerk controller in the royal household and resident of the parish of St Mary Aldermanbury, London, soon after Elizabeth's accession. On 8 April 1560 Anthony and Elizabeth Crane received a grant of the manor of Ockham, in Surrey, which Anthony gained permission to alienate six years later, before in 1571 obtaining a reversionary lease of the manor of East Molesey, also in Surrey, where since 1564 he had been a justice of the peace and member of the quorum. Anthony Crane was buried in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields on 18 August 1583, in his nuncupative will leaving all his goods to his wife and their daughter, Mary. About 1588 Mary Crane married an Aldermanbury merchant, Gerard Gore.<br>
<br>As early as 1572 Anthony Crane appears to have been associating with those forward protestants who, according to the hostile testimony of Richard Bancroft, erected a presbytery at Wandsworth, and his widow continued her connection with the reformers after her husband's death. On the destruction of his press in May 1588 for having printed Udall's treatise <span class="italic">The State of the Church of England Laid Open in a Conference</span>, usually known as <span class="italic">Diotrephes</span>, Robert Waldegrave and his wife brought the salvaged type to Elizabeth Crane's house in Aldermanbury. Robert Penry then procured a new press, and with her permission transferred the type to her country house at East Molesey. There that autumn Waldegrave printed John Udall's <span class="italic">Demonstration of Discipline</span>, together with <span class="italic">The Epistle to the Terrible Priests</span>, the first of the Martin Marprelate tracts, but his protector, who feared retaliation, dared not house the press any longer, and Penry had removed it to Northamptonshire by the end of October.<br>
<br>Late in 1588 or early in 1589 Elizabeth Crane married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37261/', "George Carleton (1529&#150;1590)")</script>, the stepfather of Anthony Cope and friend of Sir Richard Knightley, to whose house at Fawsley Penry had taken the press. Suspected of complicity in the Marprelate tracts, in April 1589 Carleton was required to attend daily upon the privy council, while the following October his wife was imprisoned in the Fleet with the other harbourers of the press, Sir Richard Knightley, John Hales, and Roger Wigston and his wife. George Carleton died in January 1590, some months before his widow appeared in the Star Chamber on 17 May, when, having affirmed her loyalty to the queen and denied being a papist, Anabaptist, Brownist, or member of the Family of Love, she prayed &#145;that she mighte not be forced to be her owne Accuser, or els that shee mighte have her Articles and tyme for Counsell wherby shee mighte not hurte herself or Gode's people&#146;  (McCorkle, 279). She was fined 1000 marks for refusing the <i>ex officio</i> oath and a further &pound;500 for sheltering the press, and was confined during the queen's pleasure, though the records do not reveal how long she remained in prison. She seems to have died before her daughter, who was buried in the parish of St Mary Aldermanbury on 1 March 1606.<br>
