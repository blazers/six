<span class="headword">Vertue,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1506), <span class="occ">master mason</span>, was the son of Adam Vertue (<i>fl</i>. 1475&#150;1485), an ordinary working mason at Westminster Abbey and Eltham Palace. Robert's younger brother <a name="cosubject_38093"></a><span class="headword">William Vertue</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1527) was also a <span class="occ">master mason</span>. Robert worked almost continuously as an ordinary mason on the nave of Westminster Abbey between 1475 and 1490. His standing must have risen greatly during the 1490s, for he is next recorded as the master mason for one of Henry VII's most important projects, the new riverside north range of Greenwich Palace, built in 1500&#150;04 at a cost of &pound;900. In 1501 and 1502 Robert was paid &pound;100 for reconstructing the tower which contained the king's privy lodgings in the Tower of London.<br>
<br>In 1502 Robert was also involved in the rebuilding of St Mary-at-Hill, London, and in 1501&#150;2 &#145;V[e]rtu the mason&#146;, doubtless Robert, was paid for a new window in the master's lodging at St Antony's Hospital, also in London. Robert's architecturally most ambitious work was the vaulting in the new church of Bath Abbey, rebuilt from 1501. A letter of the patron, Oliver King, bishop of Bath and Wells, which was probably written in 1503, notes that at a meeting with Robert and William Vertue the brothers had assured him that by comparison with &#145;the vaute devised for the chancelle &hellip; ther shal be noone so goodeley neither in england nor in france&#146;  (Westminster Abbey Muniment 16040). In fact the design, particularly of the aisle vaults, is notably less accomplished than that of the contemporary vaults in Henry VII's Chapel at Westminster. In 1506 Robert was one of three master masons responsible for drawing up an estimate for the stonework of Henry VII's tomb, and on 10 May of that year he witnessed the will of the designer of Henry VII's Chapel, Robert Janyns. The fact that Janyns and Robert Vertue both died in the summer of 1506 raises the possibility of a common cause: plague is perhaps the most likely.<br>
<br>Robert's will, proved on 12 December 1506, reveals that he was a citizen of London, that he was a parishioner of St Paul's, Canterbury, and that his wife was called Eleanor. They had two sons. The will's request for burial inside St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury, and its bequests to monks of the abbey suggest that Robert was responsible for the major projects in hand there in 1506, the lady chapel and the bell-tower.<br>
<br>On 5 June 1506 William Vertue contracted jointly with the London master mason John Aylmer for the main vault and flying buttresses of the choir of St George's Chapel, Windsor. It is highly unlikely that William would have been put in charge of this work if either his brother or Robert Janyns had been alive and in good health. The design was to follow in most respects the recently constructed vault over the nave (almost certainly designed by Janyns) and the work was to be finished by Christmas 1508. A second contract of December 1511, undertaken by William alone, was for the completion of the lady chapel of St George's, specifically for its vault, its parapets, and the vault of its vestibule. Only the last two elements were ever executed. In 1512, together with the master carpenter Humphrey Coke, Vertue made a &#145;platt&#146; (probably a complete set of drawings rather than just a plan) for each of the two main storeys of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and in 1516 he participated in the devising of the plat for the west range of the inner court at Eton College. Since this second plat consisted of an entire paper book there can be no doubt that it encompassed much more than plans.<br>
<br>William Vertue had been king's chief mason from 28 July 1510, but on 12 September 1519 he received a new appointment to this office jointly with Henry Redman. Vertue's documented royal works, like those of Redman, must represent only a part of what he did for Henry VIII. They amount to no more than some alterations made to Woking Palace in 1512, the modest rebuilding of St Peter ad Vincula in the Tower of London in 1519&#150;20, and a scheme for the adaptation of the Calais exchequer to provide lodgings for Francis I during his meeting with Henry VIII at the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520. William Vertue's will is dated 15 March 1527, evidently the day of his death. In it he bequeaths property in Kingston upon Thames and desires burial in the parish church there, where his unnamed wife already lay.<br>
<br>That the most ambitious of William Vertue's documented works, those at St George's, Windsor, should have been stylistically wholly dependent on designs by Robert Janyns was almost inevitable, given that they were continuations of projects begun or continued by the latter. However, the picture is not very different if one takes account of the most important of the buildings whose design has been attributed to Vertue, the crossing vault at St George's (which bears the date 1528) and the two-storeyed cloister of St Stephen's Chapel in Westminster Palace, built <i>c</i>.1526&#150;1529, for their emphasis on densely panelled surfaces enlivened by copious small-scale sculptured ornaments derives unmistakably from Janyns's chief work, Henry VII's Chapel.<br>
<br>Robert Vertue had two sons, William and <a name="cosubject_42269"></a><span class="headword">Robert Vertue</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1506&#150;1555). The latter was the younger and held the post of <span class="occ">master mason</span> to Evesham Abbey at the time of its dissolution in 1539. He can probably be credited with all or most of the splendid series of works undertaken there by Abbot Clement Lichfield (1514&#150;39). Those still extant are the detached bell-tower and the chantry chapels in the adjacent parish churches of St Lawrence and All Saints, the latter built before 1514 while Lichfield was prior. The chapels have richly decorated fan vaults heavily indebted to Robert Janyns's aisle and radiating chapel vaults in Henry VII's Chapel.<br>
