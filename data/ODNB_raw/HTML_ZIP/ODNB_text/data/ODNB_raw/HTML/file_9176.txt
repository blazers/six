<span class="headword">Farnworth,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1630&#150;1666), <span class="occ">Quaker preacher and writer</span>, was born at Tickhill, Yorkshire, the son of yeoman parents. Aged about sixteen he experienced a spiritual awakening that led him to attend sermons assiduously, read the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and pray diligently, and cease participation in sports. Some four or five years later he questioned formal religiosity, repudiating paedobaptism as carnal and deeming the Lord's supper a sacrifice to devils. For about a year he wrestled with doubts before rejecting the clergy and formal worship. A key influence in his spiritual pilgrimage was an unspecified work by John Saltmarsh that persuaded him to embrace antinomian tenets, the doctrine that spiritual perfection can be attained in this life, and unmediated revelation. For refusing to worship with the family of his employer, Thomas Lord (the uncle of the Quaker preacher and writer Thomas Aldam), whom he had served seven years, he was dismissed. By 1651 he had arrived at a religious outlook similar to that of George Fox, whose preaching at Balby that year convinced him to become a Quaker.<br>
<br>After leaving his second employer, whom he had served for a year as a husbandman, Farnworth became a Quaker preacher and rapidly attained a stature as one of the movement's leaders while still in his twenties. In the spring of 1651 he was with Fox when the latter travelled from Bradford, Yorkshire, to Pendle Hill, Lancashire, although he apparently declined to climb its summit with Fox. The success they enjoyed in the north-west was reflected in the observation of Wakefield residents that the men had &#145;made more noice in the Country then the comeinge uppe of the Scotish army&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of George Fox</span>, 1.38). In July Farnworth and James Nayler, whom he had counselled to &#145;be of one heart &amp; one minde&#146; went to Swarthmoor Hall to see Fox  (Swarthmore MSS, 1.372). Farnworth also preached in Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, and Derbyshire, and by year's end was holding nightly meetings that attracted nearly 200 at Malton, Yorkshire.<br>
<br>By 1652 Farnworth was corresponding with Fox and Margaret Fell as well as Nayler, and on 2 December he sent a general epistle containing spiritual counsel to Friends. About the same time he wrote <span class="italic">A Discovery of Truth and Falshood</span> (1653), in which he articulated standards of behaviour for magistrates and contrasted the church of Christ with the rotten church of Babylon. Other works quickly followed, including <span class="italic">The Generall-Good to All People</span> (April 1653), an attack on a petition from Yorkshire ministers urging parliament not to establish religious liberty; Farnworth was optimistic that &#145;light is rising in Parliament, and people, to see the deceits of the Priests&#146;  (p. 27). In <span class="italic">An Easter-Reckoning</span> (April 1653) he set forth principles for social conduct, and two months later, in <span class="italic">Englands Warning-Peece</span>, he responded to Thomas Robbins's <span class="italic">The Sinners Warning-Piece</span>, accusing him and other professional ministers of deceitfully fashioning a trade out of the words of saints. <span class="italic">Light Risen out of Darkness</span>, completed in July but not published until early 1654, refuted John Pomroy's <span class="italic">A Faithful Discovery</span> (1653) and defended the Quakers' position on such subjects as the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, the church, and the place of silence in worship. Farnworth's close relationship with Nayler is reflected in his epistle to the latter's <span class="italic">Several Petitions Answered</span> (1653) in which he denounced persecuting priests as members of Satan's synagogue, and in an epistle to Nayler's <span class="italic">A Discovery of Faith</span> (1653). In addition to writing or contributing to thirteen books in 1653, Farnworth continued to travel, spreading the Friends' message in Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire, and Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Continuing the intense pace in 1654, Farnworth was one of the most productive Quaker writers along with Fox, Nayler, and Richard Hubberthorne. The most important of his works from this time, <span class="italic">The Heart Opened by Christ</span>, published by June 1654, included a brief spiritual autobiography as well as a warning to the triers not to approve clergy whom God had repudiated. Envisioning himself as David battling Goliath, Farnworth disputed with Baptists at Harlaston, Staffordshire, in September, with clergy in Leicestershire in October, and with Independents at Chesterfield, Derbyshire, in November. He recounted the Leicestershire debates in <span class="italic">A Character whereby the False Christs &hellip; may be Known</span> (1654), in which he denounced his opponents as false prophets who led people astray, and the Staffordshire confrontation in <span class="italic">Truth Cleared of Scandals</span> (1654), in which he defended the Quakers' belief in spiritual ordinances, &#145;new Songs&#146; of the Spirit, and the doctrine of perfection. After observing alleged Ranters in Leicestershire he wrote <span class="italic">The Ranters Principles &amp; Deceits</span> (1655) during the late summer of 1654, arguing that Christian liberty entails freedom from sin, not licentious conduct. From Warwickshire in November he produced <span class="italic">Witchcraft Cast out</span> (1655), levelling charges of witchcraft against Nicholas Greaton, a minister from the Lichfield area, and Daniel Bott, a Quaker convert who lapsed and returned to the Baptists. Despite its title, in <span class="italic">A Woman Forbidden to Speak in the Church</span> (1655) Farnworth argued that the Spirit could speak through women as well as men in the church, and he cited examples of &#145;women-laborers in the Gospel&#146;  (pp. 7&#150;8). His own spiritual labours in 1654 took him throughout the north midlands, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, and Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Farnworth accompanied Fox to the latter's home village of Fenny Drayton (then Drayton in the Clay), Leicestershire, in January 1655, and included Fox's account of that trip in <span class="italic">The Spirituall Man Judgeth All Things</span> (1655). The believer has the right to judge, Farnworth asserted, because the things of God can only be discerned spiritually. The same month he wrote <span class="italic">The Pure Language of the Spirit</span> to explain the Quakers' use of &#145;thee&#146; and &#145;thou&#146; and to defend the right of those called to go naked as a spiritual sign. In February he and Thomas Goodaire (Goodier) disputed with two ministers from the Worcestershire association at Chadwick, but their primary target, Richard Baxter, refused to debate. Farnworth and Goodaire thereupon sent him written queries, to which he replied in <span class="italic">The Quakers Catechism</span> (1655). &#145;Chiefe Priests&#146; in Leicestershire were Farnworth's target in <span class="italic">A Rod to Drive out the Wild Bores</span> (1655). In it he espoused the Quaker case against tithes and proclaimed that the gospel was taught by divine revelation, not human wisdom. In Worcestershire in March he completed <span class="italic">The Brazen Serpent</span>, setting forth his views on such topics as predestination, the new covenant, justification, and the atonement. Still interested in debating with Baxter, Farnworth and Goodaire disrupted him as he preached at St Swithin's, Worcester, in May, an act that resulted in Goodaire's imprisonment. Farnworth also visited southern Wales in 1655.<br>
<br>With an appetite for controversy, Farnworth joined Nayler on 31 May 1655 in debating a small group known as the Manifestarians, led by Thomas Moore, at Glentworth, Lincolnshire. Farnworth challenged them to a fortnight's fast during which they would ingest only water and preach without recourse to books. <span class="italic">Antichrists Man of War</span> (1655), a refutation of Edmund Skipp's <span class="italic">The World's Wonder</span> (1655), was composed in the spring and is noteworthy for Farnworth's claim that Quakers could heal by laying hands on the sick, as he had reputedly done himself in 1651. In June he turned his attention to John Stalham's <span class="italic">Contradictions of the Quakers</span> (1655), a critique of which he provided in <span class="italic">The Scriptures Vindication Against the Scotish Contradictors</span> (1655). Stalham retorted in <span class="italic">The Reviler Rebuked</span> (1657), which includes a statement about Farnworth's early life from a Yorkshire minister. Farnworth also replied to Thomas Pollard's <span class="italic">The Holy Scripture Clearing it Self</span> (1655), an attack on his <span class="italic">Truth Cleared</span>, in <span class="italic">The Holy Scriptures from Scandals are Cleared</span> (1655); in the same work Farnworth responded to John Griffith's <span class="italic">True Gospel Faith</span>. While at Banbury, Oxfordshire, to attend the trial of Anne Audland in September, Farnworth was incarcerated for refusing to doff his hat to the mayor. Offered his freedom if he paid the gaoler's fees and left town, he refused and remained in prison for eight months. While there, in January 1656 he refuted the Worcestershire association's <span class="italic">Agreement &hellip; for Catechizing</span> (1655) in <span class="italic">A True Testimony Against the Popes Wayes</span> (1656), charging that the association was perpetuating forms of worship established by archbishops and bishops if not the papacy itself.<br>
<br>During the ensuing five years Farnworth's activity decreased, possibly, as has been suggested, because he was troubled by the Nayler affair, but ill health, exacerbated by imprisonment, is a more likely explanation. William Penn reported that Farnworth's health was poor during the last sixteen years of his life. Moreover, his reduced activity began before Nayler's ill-fated entry into Bristol in October 1656. Farnworth was in Westmorland in August 1656 and then at Balby in November for a meeting of Quaker elders from Lincolnshire, Derbyshire, and Nottinghamshire; they issued an important epistle on church order and discipline. Early in 1658 he wrote <span class="italic">Truth Exalted and Truth Abased</span> (1658), expressing his conviction that this was the end time, warning his readers against false Christs, attacking the psalter of Sternhold and Hopkins because only God can teach Christians to sing, and concluding with provocative queries to parish priests. A year later in <span class="italic">A Confession and Profession of Faith</span> he espoused the Quaker view of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and magistracy and defended the Friends from charges that they were Jesuits and vagabonds. William Dewsbury reported to Margaret Fell in October 1661 that Farnworth had been powerfully raised up and was visiting Friends.<br>
<br>Farnworth was again imprisoned, this time at Nottingham in the autumn of 1662. This was the context for <span class="italic">The Quakers Plea with the Bishops</span> (1663), composed in November 1662, in which he responded to a bill of presentment accusing Quakers of recusancy; he denied the charge on the grounds that the Friends, &#145;the sanctified and beloved people of God&#146;  (p. 4), were the church. While in prison he saw a copy of a paper by Lodowick Muggleton and was prompted to send him a letter denouncing his claim to possess a divine commission and to be one of the two witnesses in <span class="roman">Revelation</span>. Muggleton printed the letter with his reply in <span class="italic">The Neck of the Quakers Broken</span> (1663), pronouncing a sentence of eternal damnation on Farnworth for blaspheming the Spirit. In the same book Muggleton replied to Farnworth's <span class="italic">Truth Ascended</span> (1663), a sustained argument against Muggleton's claims. Well after Farnworth's death, Muggleton referred to him in <span class="italic">The Answer to William Penn</span> (1673) as a fat red dragon filled with fury. In August 1663 Farnworth turned his criticism against the dissident Quaker John Perrot, whom he accused of doctrinal innovations. Four months earlier Farnworth had written <span class="italic">The Spirit of God Speaking in the Temple of God</span> (1663), in which he defended the Quakers' practice of waiting silently until the Spirit moved them to speak.<br>
<br>In April 1664 Farnworth went to London, where he spent his final years. It was probably at this time that he acquired the modest legal knowledge reflected in some of his late works. In <span class="italic">Gospel Liberty Sent Down from Heaven</span> (May 1664), a tract in defence of freedom of conscience, he averred that the <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span> guaranteed such liberty to godly people, including Quakers, who were innocent of all plotting. Pursuing his case in <span class="italic">Christian Religious Meetings</span> (June 1664), he contended that the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> permitted the godly, again including Friends, to gather for worship because such meetings were not seditious. His legal interests were even more evident in <span class="italic">The Liberty of the Subject by Magna Charta</span> (August 1664), for here he cited not only <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> but also Sir Edward Coke's <span class="italic">Institutes</span>, assorted statutes, and the patristics to argue for the legality of Quaker meetings and the rights of citizens. Again writing with the intensity that characterized his early years as a Friend, Farnworth pressed his case for the right of Quakers to meet under the <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span> in <span class="italic">Christian Tolleration</span> (1664), <span class="italic">The Publique Worship</span> (1664), and <span class="italic">A Tolleration Sent Down from Heaven</span> (December 1665). An epistle exhorting Friends to remain faithful in times of persecution, composed in August 1664, was published with letters from John Whitehead and Thomas Green in <span class="italic">A Tender Visitation of Heavenly Love</span> (1664), and he reiterated this theme in <span class="italic">A Loving Salutation</span> (May 1665), which also included an epistle by Thomas Salthouse.<br>
<br>Farnworth's last tract, <span class="italic">Truth Vindicated</span> (1665), refuted a letter by Perrot, and in May 1666 he and ten other Friends signed &#145;A testimony from the brethren&#146; denouncing Perrot and his followers. Probably drafted by Farnworth, &#145;A testimony&#146; emphasized the importance of subordinating individual judgement to the meeting, recommended that Quaker writings be reviewed before publication, and called for more organization. Farnworth died of a fever on 29 June 1666 in the parish of St Thomas the Apostle, London. An intense, dedicated man who wrote more than forty books and pamphlets and liked to preach from <span class="roman">Revelation</span>, he once attacked a reputed Ranter who had disrupted a meeting at Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, shoving him against a wall and stuffing cloth in his mouth. Josiah Coale described him as &#145;a man of great abilities, and parts, and knowledge&#146;, adding that &#145;the Sword of his mouth was very sharp&#146;  (<span class="italic">Last Testimony</span>, 5, 7).<br>
