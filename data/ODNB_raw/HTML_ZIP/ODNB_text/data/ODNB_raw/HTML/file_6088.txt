<span class="headword">Connor,  George Henry</span>  (1822&#150;1883), <span class="occ">dean of Windsor</span>, eldest son of George Connor, master in chancery in Ireland, was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA in 1845 and proceeded MA in 1851. He was ordained deacon in 1846 and priest in the following year. After officiating for some time at St Thomas's Chapel, Newport, Isle of Wight, he was curate at St Jude's, Southsea, and subsequently at Wareham, Dorset. He married in 1852 Maude Worthington, eldest daughter of John Worthington of Kent House, Southsea, with whom he had two sons and several daughters. His daughter Emily Henrietta married Ernest Wilberforce, successively bishop of Newcastle and Chichester.<br>
<br>Connor was appointed vicar of Newport, Isle of Wight, in 1852. Here it was due to his initiative and energy that the parish church was rebuilt at a cost of &pound;22,000. The foundation stone was laid by the prince consort. He also built a vicarage and some almshouses, and effected improvements in the schools. He became acquainted with Queen Victoria, then living chiefly on the Isle of Wight, and he was for years honorary chaplain and chaplain-in-ordinary to the queen, chaplain to the governor of the Isle of Wight, and official and commissary of the archdeaconry of Wight. Following the death of G. V. Wellesley, dean of Windsor and an important conduit between the queen and her prime minister, W. E. Gladstone, the queen appointed Connor to the vacant deanery in October 1882, without consulting Gladstone. This was a serious, if characteristic, error. Connor left Newport amid the general regret of his parishioners. He had no sooner entered on his new duties than his health broke down. He was not, in fact, suited to the pressures of so prominent a deanery. He preached once in St George's Chapel, and several times in the private chapel. It taxed his strength severely to be present on the occasion of the christening of Princess Alice of Albany on 26 March. He died on 1 May 1883 at the deanery, Windsor.<br>
