<span class="headword">Ba Maw</span>  (1893&#150;1977), <span class="occ">chief minister of Burma and wartime head of the Burmese administration</span>, was born on 8 February 1893 at Maubin in the Irrawaddy Delta, Lower Burma, then a province of British India, the son of Maung Maung Kye, an official in the court of the last Burmese king, and his wife, Thein Tin. Educated at the universities of Rangoon and Calcutta, he served as a teacher at the Government High School, Rangoon, and a lecturer in English at University College, Rangoon, from 1916 to 1920. After departing to study at the University of Cambridge he was called to the bar at Gray's Inn, London, in 1924, and in the same year earned a doctorate from the University of Bordeaux, where he wrote a psychological study of Buddhist mysticism. After he returned to Burma he established a legal practice. During this period he married Khin Ma Ma, with whom he had three sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Urbane and sophisticated, Dr Ba Maw, as he was known, came to prominence as a Burmese nationalist when, in 1932, he defended the leader of an abortive peasant revolt, Hsaya San, in a highly publicized trial, appearing as a supporter of rebellion but remaining within the law. Entering the legislative assembly as a member of the Anti-Separation League, he supported Burma's remaining part of India in order to speed its self-government, but when it became inevitable that the province would be separated he switched sides. While serving as minister of education in the governor's cabinet between 1934 and 1937 he formed the Hsinyeitha (&#145;Poor Man's&#146;) Party to fight in new elections in 1936. Though his party was relatively unsuccessful, Ba Maw's political skills allowed him to form a coalition cabinet in 1937 and he thus became separated Burma's first premier. His government was brought down in 1939 by student demonstrations led by Aung San, Nu, and others, together with his major legislative opponent, Saw. Radical nationalists accused him of being pro-imperialist and aiding foreign capitalists. Resigning as leader of the opposition and a member of the legislature in 1940, he joined his former student opponents in forming the Freedom Bloc, which opposed Burma's assisting Britain in the war against Nazi Germany. Arrested under the defence of Burma rules and detained in Mogok prison until his escape in 1942 during the Japanese invasion, he emerged as the most senior nationalist leader not seen as a collaborator with the British colonial authorities.<br>
<br>In August 1942 Ba Maw was chosen as the head of the Japanese-sponsored &#145;Burmese executive administration&#146;. When in 1943 the Japanese sought to grant Burma partial independence within the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, Ba Maw was again chosen to head the new regime. The government he formed in August of that year, with Aung San serving as minister of defence and Nu as foreign minister, had limited powers, since he had been obliged to enter into a secret treaty with the Japanese which gave the occupying military forces dominant authority. Taking the titles <i>nainggandaw adipadi</i> and, assuming royal pretensions, <i>adipati ashin minkyi</i>, as head of state and premier Ba Maw advocated a policy of &#145;one voice, one blood, one nation&#146;. The war years were a period of extreme poverty and distress for most of the people of the country as Burma was fought over twice, with the near collapse of civil administration in much of the country. Ba Maw's ability to govern was greatly constrained, but his period of office was noteworthy for the importance he placed on gaining the support of the avowedly apolitical Buddhist monkhood.<br>
<br>During the British reconquest of Burma in 1945 Ba Maw protected some of his colleagues from reprisals as they turned their attention to assisting the allies against the Japanese. Nevertheless, when, in March, Aung San led the Burma National Army off to fight the Japanese in conjunction with the British Fourteenth Army, Ba Maw remained behind in the capital until the inevitability of the British victory became apparent, when he joined the retreating Japanese army, eventually reaching Japan. There he surrendered to the British embassy in January 1946. He was detained in Sugamo prison until it was decided not to prosecute him as a war criminal. Returning to Burma, he attempted to re-enter politics and organized the Maha Bama (&#145;Greater Burma&#146;) Party, but by then his popularity had been superseded by such younger nationalist leaders as Aung San and Than Tun of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League.<br>
<br>Detained briefly in Tharrawaddy prison for his political activities and outspoken criticism of the first post-independence government in 1948, on his release Ba Maw returned to the Rangoon bar and re-established his legal practice. Writing occasional newspaper articles, by the early 1960s he had established a role for himself as an elder statesman. His memoirs of the war years were written during that time and eventually published in the United States as <span class="italic">Breakthrough in Burma</span> (1968). He died on 29 May 1977 in Rangoon.<br>
