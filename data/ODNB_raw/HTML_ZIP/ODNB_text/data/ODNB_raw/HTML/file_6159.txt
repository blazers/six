<span class="headword">Cooke,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1755, <em>d.</em> 1820), <span class="occ">government official and political pamphleteer</span>, was baptized on 27 June 1755 at Denham, Buckinghamshire, the third and only surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6188/', "William Cooke (1711&#150;1797)")</script>, provost of King's College, Cambridge, and his wife, Catherine, the daughter of Richard Sleech, a canon of Windsor. He was educated at Eton College (1760&#150;72) and, from 16 May 1773, at King's College, Cambridge, whence he graduated BA in 1777 and MA in 1785, and was a fellow from 1776 to 1786.<br>
<br>Cooke entered government service in 1778, when he became private secretary to Sir Richard Heron, the chief secretary of Ireland during the vice-royalty of John Hobart, second earl of Buckinghamshire, and in the course of the next twenty-two years he became the most prominent English member of the Dublin Castle secretariat. He was therefore private secretary to Heron's successors, William Eden and Richard Fitzpatrick. He held a succession of posts in the Irish administration and parliament from 1778&#151;as second chamberlain of the exchequer (1778&#150;86), clerk of the stationery stores (1781&#150;4), second clerk of the House of Commons (1786&#150;9, 1798), and education commissioner (1788)&#151;before occupying the more influential positions of under-secretary for the military department, from 7 April 1789 to 1796, and for the civil department, from 5 June 1796 to 21 October 1801. In addition the Irish administration had him returned an MP for the nomination boroughs of Lifford (1789&#150;90) and Old Leighlin (1790&#150;1800) and topped up his official perquisites of &pound;1414 per annum and, by 1801, a house in the Phoenix Park, with several sinecures. It is a measure of his standing as a leading member of the secretariat of Dublin Castle that, despite being English, he was unanimously voted the freedom of Dublin in 1796 and that of the Guild of Merchants in 1798.<br>
<br>Cooke's career in Ireland prospered because he was clever and ready to support British policy there. His intellect was widely admired: in 1782 Lord Mornington recommended him to the incoming chief secretary, William Grenville, on the ground of the &#145;very high character&#146; he had acquired &#145;for his knowledge and talents in his line&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fortescue MSS</span>, 1.164); and in 1800 Lord Cornwallis, then viceroy, referred to him as &#145;a very clever fellow&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of &hellip; Cornwallis</span>, 3.310). He did not wear his intelligence lightly, however. Cornwallis was not alone in criticizing his lack of an &#145;accommodating temper&#146;  (ibid.), and Edmund Burke took such criticism to extremes with his remark that Cooke was &#145;a shallow hot headed puppy, proud and presumptuous, and ill behav'd&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 9.339). Cornwallis also alleged that by the time of his vice-royalty Cooke guarded his position at the castle jealously, failed to delegate to others, and, being &#145;no man of details himself&#146;, left ordinary business &#145;behindhand, and in great confusion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of &hellip; Cornwallis</span>, 3.315). However, it has to be said that there was little love lost between the two men, Cooke being coruscating in his criticism of his chief's administration.<br>
<br>With the exception of Earl Fitzwilliam's administration in 1795, when he was temporarily dismissed because of his influence and his identification with Pitt's regime, Cooke served successive Irish administrations in a variety of ways. There is circumstantial evidence of his involvement in managing the Irish parliament for the castle in the early 1780s and no doubt of that role later, especially during the Regency crisis and, most notably, during the passage of the Union (1799&#150;1800). In the last case he was, in his own opinion, the official most &#145;deeply engaged in all the promises&#146; made to individuals to reward them for their support of the measure or to win that support  (Cooke to Auckland, 8 Oct 1801, Sneyd MSS), and therefore involved in the irregular funding of them through the English secret service fund. He was also routinely called upon to advise and to frame policy with the British government: for example, on the commercial propositions in 1785; on the ramifications in Ireland of the Portland whigs' taking office in 1794; and, most importantly, on the Union, when he played a prominent role in drawing up the relevant bills and, on the eve of Pitt's resignation, in working up drafts of measures to enable Catholics to sit in the imperial parliament and to reduce the burden of tithe. Throughout the Union episode his frequent correspondence with Castlereagh, Grenville, and Auckland is a major source of information on the disposition of the Irish politicians and the progress of the measure. Indeed, his influence in Dublin and his connections in London made him the vital bureaucratic link between the Irish administration and the British government.<br>
<br>Cooke was most widely known, however, as a pamphleteer. There is a strong possibility that he was the author of <span class="italic">A Letter to a Venerated Nobleman Lately Retired from this Kingdom</span> (1795), in which Fitzwilliam was accused of setting back the Catholic question by his alleged indiscretions. He certainly wrote the anonymous <span class="italic">Arguments for and Against a Union between Great Britain and Ireland Considered</span> (1798), which was regarded as a statement of the government's thinking and was &#145;very universally read&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fortescue MSS</span>, 4.404). In this Cooke argued that the union would benefit both countries and eventually bring about political benefits for Catholics&#151;a cause on which he had come to believe that concession &#145;risks nothing, and denial risks everything&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs &hellip; of Viscount Castlereagh</span>, 4.41&#150;6). He even went so far in a &#145;Most secret&#146; letter to Grenville on 15 January 1799 as to advise the government that it should make it clear to the Catholic hierarchy that concession would be made &#145;at an early period&#146; after the Union in order to secure its passage in Ireland. However, on an issue that became a matter of repeated controversy in parliament until 1829, he later denied that he had had any communications with Catholics or protestants in Ireland on the subject <i>before</i> Pitt declared his intention to retire. On the other hand, his commitment to Catholic relief after Union was sufficiently strong to determine him to resign his post and return to England as soon as he heard of the king's veto and Pitt's replacement by the anti-Catholic Addington. As he put it as early as 9 February 1801 (in words that tend to confirm Cornwallis's opinion of his temper):<blockquote>How can I, with my natural eagerness and indiscretion, (which official habits for twenty years have not been able to tame) sit a quiet, torpid, useless clerk at a desk, going through mere common drudgery, and disapproving every measure that is taken by the Government &hellip;? (ibid., 4.28)</blockquote>Cooke's departure, however, was protracted and acrimonious. In the immediate aftermath of the change of ministers he remained determined to leave Ireland, stressing now the needs of his many relatives in England, but was persuaded to remain for the time being by Lord Hardwicke, the new viceroy, on the ground that he was the best person to oversee the fulfilment of the Union promises. Indeed Hardwicke and the new chief secretary, Charles Abbot, asked him to go to London in spring 1801 to help with the &#145;secret business&#146; of filling up the holes in the Secret Service Fund made by Cooke's promises, from which the new Irish administration wished to keep its distance  (Cooke to Auckland, 8 Oct 1801, Sneyd MSS). At approximately the same time, however, Cooke took severe umbrage at Abbot's being appointed Irish lord privy seal and at the appointment of a new fellow under-secretary&#151;on the ground of their ignorance of the country. With family pressures mounting, he renewed his decision to leave Ireland and, unbeknown to Hardwicke and Abbot, used part of the time he spent in London to make an arrangement with Lord Pelham, one of his former chiefs in Ireland and the incoming home secretary, by which he would become Pelham's under-secretary and Sir George Shee would replace him in Ireland. Cooke argued later that he believed that, in the new post-Union conditions, the authority of the home secretary over Irish matters had increased and that he would, in effect, have a decisive say in all major appointments. He also alleged that, although he had asked Pelham to broach the subject with Hardwicke himself, Pelham had dissembled and enjoined him to keep quiet.<br>
<br>When the arrangement did become known, a serious row broke out which had public and personal dimensions. Contrary to Cooke's interpretation of the respective powers of the viceroy and the home secretary, Hardwicke saw himself as a king's representative who should settle policy in collaboration with the prime minister and the cabinet rather than act under the Home Office. He and Abbot therefore regarded Cooke's action as &#145;a most monstrous and inadmissible presumption&#146; by a public servant who had no right &#145;to govern and dispose of Lords Lieutenants and Secretaries of State&#146; as he pleased  (Abbot to Hardwicke, 1, 6 July 1801, BL, Add. MS 35711, fols. 67, 76). They therefore vetoed the intended exchange of posts.<br>
<br>Cooke reacted bitterly. &#145;I do not deserve this after 23 years service here and my labours in the Rebellion and Union&#146;, he pleaded to Auckland  (6 Aug 1801, BL, Add. MS 34455, fol. 425), and later he told Pitt that he had been excluded from the discussion of policy following Abbot's arrival in order to force his retirement. Abbot, for his part, accused Cooke of publicly criticizing the government both during and after his time in London, and of describing his own intended reforms of the Irish administration in exaggerated and alarmist terms. It was even suspected that Cooke had colluded with Lord Clare and others in feeding such alarms to the government's opponents at Westminster. The otherwise temperate Hardwicke had seen enough and, although it removed the master of the complicated Union promises from the castle, consented to Cooke's retirement, which took place on 21 October 1801; he received a salary of &pound;1000 for the sinecure post of keeper of the records of the Irish parliament, two other sinecures worth &pound;500 each, and the imminent reversion of a post worth &pound;800 a year.<br>
<br>Following his return to England Cooke was unemployed until the formation of Pitt's second administration in May 1804, when he was appointed under-secretary to Lord Camden, the new secretary for war and the colonies. Camden knew of Cooke, for he had been Cornwallis's predecessor as viceroy and, more particularly, was the father-in-law of Lord Castlereagh, Cooke's chief during the making of the Union. There was considerable respect and friendship between Cooke and Castlereagh, and both men had taken part in the horse-trading involved in passing the Union. Cooke served the remainder of his career first as Camden's and then as Castlereagh's under-secretary for war and the colonies, from 1804 to 1806, and then as Castlereagh's secretary at the Foreign Office, from 1807 to 1809, and again from 1812 to 1817. Although he and Castlereagh corresponded in private frequently, the evidence of his influence is slight. Under Camden (1804&#150;5) he evidently conducted the military and colonial business of the department single-handed, and he claimed to be one of the prime movers in making the ill-fated assault on Buenos Aires (1806&#150;7) an object of war policy for which the Grenville administration was criticized. Later he was reputed to be the author of pamphlets defending George III's conduct leading to the resignation of the Grenville government and that of Castlereagh in his dispute with Canning (1809). In winter 1814&#150;15 he accompanied Castlereagh to Vienna and to Italy, partly to support his chief in the peace negotiations and partly to further ongoing talks with Cardinal Consalvi about securing an agreement with the Vatican on a settlement of the Catholic question. Two years later, in 1817, he retired, to Castlereagh's very considerable regret.<br>
<br>Cooke had married, on 10 August 1791, Isabella (<i>d</i>. 1821&times;4), the daughter of Hamilton Gorges of Kilbrew, co. Meath, an Irish MP, who endowed her with a portion of &pound;10,000. They had no children, and the absence of any evidence of a social life seems to suggest that Cooke was the dedicated &#145;civil servant&#146;. He even thought like one: &#145;<i>thinking</i>&#146;, he once remarked to Lord Clare regarding the Catholic question, &#145;ought perhaps to make but a small part of my duty&#146;; and on another occasion he told Castlereagh that &#145;vanity, ambition, interest&#146; were the dominant passions in all governments and that a belief in &#145;utopian systems&#146; which &#145;will not do&#146; was one of the weaknesses of politicians  (<span class="italic">Memoirs &hellip; of Viscount Castlereagh</span>, 4.41&#150;6, 50&#150;52). He died at his home in Park Lane, London, on 19 March 1820. Much to the regret of historians, he left no papers behind him.<br>
