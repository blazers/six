</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Simpson, Sir  Joseph</span>  (1909&#150;1968), <span class="occ">police officer</span>, was born at Doseley, Dawley, Shropshire, on 26 June 1909, the second of four children and the elder of two sons of Joseph Simpson (1875&#150;1952), mechanical engineer, and his wife, (Ann Mary) Dorothea (Dora), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Maw (1874&#150;1950). He was educated at Oundle School and at Manchester College of Technology, where he studied textile engineering with the intention of entering the cotton industry. He excelled at athletics, specializing in the long jump and hurdling, and just missed selection for the British team at the 1928 Olympic games in Amsterdam. At the world university games in Darmstadt in 1930 he won the 400 metres hurdles, setting a new German record.<h2>
<a name="Hendonhighflyer"></a>Hendon high-flyer</h2>In 1930 Simpson joined the Metropolitan Police, entering the training establishment at Peel House in November 1930, and starting as a constable in Wembley in February 1931 before moving to E division (Bow Street). His choice of career may have been influenced by the opportunity to continue his sport, while the economic crash of 1929 accelerated the shrinking of the textile industry for which his degree qualified him. The Metropolitan Police was seeking to take advantage of the difficult job market by appealing to public-school men and university graduates in the hope of raising the educational calibre of the force, and Simpson's appointment was cited in the press as an example of this new type of recruit. He was additionally notable on account of his athleticism: &#145;If you see Constable Simpson in the street near Bow Street, and you feel like running, it would be just as well to think twice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>, 4 Aug 1931). The Met offered such &#145;gentstables&#146; job security and excellent promotion prospects at a difficult time; what social status it conferred was less clear. As one wrote to a newspaper, &#145;The young man often finds himself shunned and despised by his former friends and demoralised by the crudeness of section house life, where privacy does not exist and manners are unappreciated and unknown&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, 7 Oct 1933). Simpson may have written the letter; he certainly thought enough of the article to paste it into a personal scrapbook.<br>
<br>Such grievances were partially assuaged when, in 1934, the Metropolitan Police commissioner Hugh Trenchard established Hendon College, where promising members of the Met and highly qualified new recruits enjoyed levels of comfort unusual in a training college. Simpson was one of the first Hendon intake, passing out second in the year in July 1935 after gaining second prize in the king's police (British empire) gold medal essay competition. Hendon graduates were promoted to the rank of junior station inspector, which Simpson assumed on returning to the Met in A division (Westminster) in 1935. While still a constable he had begun to study law, was admitted to Gray's Inn, and returned to Hendon in May 1936 as an assistant law instructor. He was called to the bar in January 1937. On 20 December 1936 he married Elizabeth May Bowler (1910&#150;1970), daughter of Percy Bowler of Chorlton upon Medlock. The couple had two sons, Joseph Mark (<i>b</i>. 1939) and Benjamin David (<i>b</i>. 1942); a daughter died at birth in 1946.<br>
<br>Clearly marked as a high flyer, Simpson was supported by G. H. R. Halland, commandant at Hendon, in his successful application in 1937 for the post of assistant chief constable of Lincolnshire, the force that Halland had left to come to Hendon. He was twenty-seven years old. Some criticized Trenchard's Hendon experiment as an attempt to create an officer class in the police service, and Simpson, who considered the college &#145;a very brave experiment that was not unsuccessful&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 May 1959), rose as quickly as any Hendon alumnus. On the outbreak of war he was seconded to the office of the regional commissioner appointed under the <i>ad hoc</i> wartime system of local administration, another institution that enabled rapid promotion. He served first as regional police staff officer, then as acting inspector of constabulary, in the Nottinghamshire and the Cambridgeshire civil defence regions. In March 1943, aged thirty-three, he became the youngest chief constable in the country when he was appointed to head the Northumberland force. In December 1946 he took up the position of chief constable of Surrey, serving for almost ten years before returning to the Met as assistant commissioner in February 1956.<h2>
<a name="MetropolitanPolicecommissioner"></a>Metropolitan Police commissioner</h2>Simpson succeeded Sir John Nott-Bower as commissioner of the Metropolitan Police in September 1958, and received a knighthood in 1959. During his ten years in command of the Met Simpson had to address the problem of policing an affluent society. He had cut his teeth in the police service during the depression years, and in a contemplative introduction to his first annual report as commissioner regretted that &#145;neither the absence of real poverty nor the more progressive methods employed in dealing with delinquents appear to have done anything to reduce the volume of crime&#146;; in fact indictable crime had risen by nearly 60 per cent since 1937  (<span class="italic">Report of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis for the Year 1958</span>, 7). Traffic crime and crimes involving cars increased with the spread of car ownership: Simpson reported a massive 34 per cent increase in thefts from unattended vehicles in his annual report for 1961. Prosperity also encouraged burglary: Simpson noted a 14 per cent rise in housebreaking and burglary in 1964, &#145;the worst year of the century for crime&#146;  (<span class="italic">Report, 1964</span>, 7).<br>
<br>Despite rising crime the Met's authorized establishment had not been increased since the war. A less obvious effect of affluence was to make it impossible to recruit and retain enough men even to meet the existing figure. Full employment eroded the advantage of job security and police pay was inadequate to offset London's high cost of living: &#145;they are not very impressed, I think, by what are known as invisible emoluments&#146;, Simpson told the select committee on estimates shortly after his return to the Met, &#145;it's what they get in their pay packets that counts&#146;  (&#145;Select committee on estimates&#146;, <span class="italic">Parl. Papers</span>, 1957, question 341, 21 Feb 1957). He was unusually forthright about policemen's pay, gaining an eye-catching headline with his evidence to the royal commission on the police in 1960 that &#145;They are humiliated by the fact that their wives earn as much as they do, under much more agreeable conditions&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13 May 1960). The wastage rate among young recruits was compounded by the belated discovery of the drawbacks inherent in a policeman's lot: the discipline, long hours, and often poor conditions of work and accommodation.<br>
<br>Many of the initiatives associated with Simpson's time as commissioner were driven in part by the need to make manpower go further: the expansion of the use of motorcycle patrols, particularly in suburban areas, to replace beat constables; the introduction of traffic wardens in 1960; and the plan, implemented after Simpson's death, to train civilian scene-of-crime officers to relieve CID men of the burden of evidence-gathering, for petty crimes. These measures helped secure Simpson's reputation as a modernizing commissioner, but he continued to worry about the distancing of police from public, particularly as a result of expanding motorized patrols.<br>
<br>At heart Simpson remained an advocate of the beat policeman. He accepted that it was impossible in London to expect the degree of co-operation between police and public that he had experienced in shire forces&#151;unlike in rural areas, &#145;nobody will tell a constable who has pinched a transistor radio from Savoy Street&#146;  (&#145;Select committee on estimates&#146;, <span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1966, question 383, 14 Feb 1966)&#151;but he never strayed from the belief that &#145;The policeman who counts from a public standpoint is the policeman who stands on his feet and who can talk to the public&#146;  (&#145;Royal commission on the police&#146;, <span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1962, para 38, p. 1158, memorandum of evidence by the commissioner of police of the metropolis). The result was that, by the mid-1960s, every policeman in the Met was working twelve hours per fortnight longer than the maximum time prescribed in the force's regulations, which Simpson believed overstretched the force and lowered morale within it.<h2>
<a name="Policinginthe1960s"></a>Policing in the 1960s</h2>For much of Simpson's term as commissioner the public image of the Met was problematic. Car ownership brought much of the &#145;respectable&#146; public into unfamiliar and unanticipated conflict with the police. The royal commission on the police found that car, bus, and taxi-drivers (who fought a particularly bitter guerrilla war with the Met after the introduction of minicabs to London's streets in 1961) formed the largest group of complainers. The National Council for Civil Liberties and other liberal pressure groups were also prominent among the critics. Simpson's commissionership was marked by a wave of political demonstrations unprecedented since the 1930s, from the anti-nuclear rallies of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the more radical Committee of 100 in the early 1960s, through the protests against apartheid in South Africa and UDI (unilateral declaration of independence) in Rhodesia, to the demonstrations against the war in Vietnam from the middle of the decade: the first and more violent of the demonstrations outside the American embassy in Grosvenor Square, in March 1968, occurred days before Simpson's death. When protest turned to violence, as at Grosvenor Square, it was possible to treat the episode primarily as a public order question, but in the case of the largely peaceful anti-nuclear protests delicate issues of civil liberty arose, which the officers on duty&#151;generally unsympathetic to the protesters&#151;did not always handle well.<br>
<br>Civil disobedience was one area in which the business of policing took on a political aspect in the 1960s. Another was race relations. Simpson's last annual report, for 1967, contained an outspoken defence of police relations with ethnic minorities: &#145;never had the immigrant groups less cause for complaint than now&#146;  (<span class="italic">Report, 1967</span>, 16). It is unlikely that Simpson really believed this contentious issue to have been settled by that point. Simpson's term as commissioner had begun only days after the eruption of racial unrest in Notting Hill in 1958. The threat of heightened racial tension in London after the murder of the Antiguan Kelso Cochrane in Notting Hill in May 1959 led Simpson to confer with the commissioner of the West Indies Federation, Garnett Gordon, in July, in order to &#145;establish a channel of liaison&#146; between the Met and the Federation  (Whitfield, 65&#150;6). Simpson's candid account of the meeting, referring at one point to the &#145;sort of weaknesses and defects which we experience in coloured people&#146;, indicates inadvertently the ground still to be covered by the Met in its approach to race relations. Although the Met was hardly alone among British police forces in its failure to attract black recruits, the poor progress made in this direction was arguably more damaging in London than elsewhere. At the same time Simpson did become increasingly anxious to impress upon white officers their duty to show tact towards London's blacks, accepting in 1963 the desirability of stressing &#145;the need for greater care in dealing with coloured people&#146; in probationers' courses  (ibid., 128). Riots in the USA in the mid-1960s showed the potential of racial hatred to generate serious public disorder; Simpson's understanding of this risk was evident in one of his last published pieces, warning the rank-and-file readership of <span class="italic">The Job</span>, the Met's new in-house newspaper, of the danger of a &#145;disastrous&#146; breakdown of communications with black people, and stressing the responsibility of every policeman &#145;to avoid having a situation develop which resembles that already existing in large American cities&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Job</span>, 8 Dec 1967).<br>
<br>In different ways the issues of civil rights and race relations underlined the need for more sensitive and intelligent policing in London. Simpson understood that an educated and enlightened public, conscious of its civil rights and politically aware, would no longer accept the direction of a policeman without question, and that this new public was dealing with sometimes unenlightened and under-educated police officers. The memory of his own early career shaped his views, and he expressed concern that the police service was losing out in the competition for &#145;the man who has a high intelligence quotient and a potentially good chance of succeeding academically&#146;  (&#145;Select committee on estimates&#146;, <span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1966, questions 355, 383, 14 Feb 1966). Since the war only twenty-five graduates had joined the police forces of England, Wales, and Scotland. Simpson expanded and promoted the police cadet scheme introduced by his predecessor, and the cadet ranks were said to include a high percentage of grammar school boys, but this was an uphill struggle. The creation of specialist squads within the force&#151;most notably the obscene publications squad and the drugs squad in 1963&#151;though meeting an obvious operational need, was partly designed to provide some officers with a focus and an opportunity to specialize lacking in the often mechanical police routine. He was concerned that the remarkable generation of Hendon men were reaching the end of their careers, and that there should be men competent to take their places, but he expected a showdown with the Police Federation over any proposals that favoured graduate recruits  (evidence to royal commission on the police, 22 March 1961, TNA: PRO, MEPO 2/10114, p. 36). In a plaintive article in <span class="italic">The Job</span> he asked &#145;why should university be any more of a dirty word than secondary modern?&#146;, suggesting that many hearts and minds in the ranks remained to be captured  (<span class="italic">The Job</span>, 24 Nov 1967).<h2>
<a name="TheMetunderscrutiny"></a>The Met under scrutiny</h2>Public criticism of the Met's accountability, transparency, and even probity was meanwhile deeply irksome to rank-and-file policemen who were already overworked, exacerbating problems of morale. In November 1963 Simpson convened a meeting of representatives&#151;an inspector, a sergeant, and a constable&#151;from each of the Met's twenty-three divisions, at which the top brass was told that &#145;if the [public] habit of complaining about the way they do their duties is growing, they want to be sure that their superiors are backing them up&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 30 Nov 1963). He reacted with appropriate vigour to criticism of the force that he considered unjust, following the miscarriages of justice brought about by Sergeant Harold Challenor in Soho in 1964, and to an ATV <span class="italic">Law in Action</span> investigation into the Met's treatment of suspects in 1966.<br>
<br>Simpson found the disciplining of corrupt policemen the most unpleasant part of his job, but, mindful of the force's fragile morale, he was a determined opponent of any external complaints tribunal. In his private testimony to the royal commission on the police he argued that chief constables should be trusted to deal with their own men. His view that the Met's complaints procedure was &#145;essentially a domestic matter&#146;  (evidence to royal commission on the police, 22 March 1961, TNA: PRO, MEPO 2/10114, 23) was consistent with this, but the rejection of external scrutiny was proving increasingly unacceptable to the Home Office. The liberal-minded Roy Jenkins, who became home secretary in December 1965, attributed the Met's institutional failings to its introversion, and especially its unwillingness to employ police from other forces. Jenkins used his power as home secretary to secure the appointment of Robert Mark, former chief constable of Leicester, as assistant commissioner at Scotland Yard in 1966. The appointment was intended to make waves and did so: if Simpson did not ostracize Mark in the manner of the established assistant commissioners, he apparently saw him as something of a Trojan horse, and although he eventually reconciled himself to Mark's appointment, &#145;he could not bring himself to say so&#146;  (Mark, 92). Mark's appointment was interpreted as a move to bring the Met under closer Home Office control, as was Jenkins's initiative early in 1967 to appoint a team of management consultants to overhaul the force's organization.<br>
<br>Simpson had already presided over reorganizations during his early years at Surrey and when London government was restructured in 1963&#150;5. A fresh bout of reconstruction was unwelcome, and it was generally felt that it contributed to the stress that killed him. He had spent a month as an in-patient at St Thomas's Hospital in May&#150;June 1965 after a myocardial infarction, after which he had apparently been warned to curb a working day that routinely lasted fifteen hours  (<span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>, 20 March 1968). However responsive or otherwise he was to that advice, it is unlikely that the demands of the job at that point could have allowed much respite. A further heart attack on 20 March 1968 led to his death, at his home, 7 Roedean Crescent, Roehampton, London. He received something close to a state funeral at Westminster Abbey on 29 March, reflecting the acknowledgement that he had been the greatest Metropolitan Police commissioner since Trenchard.<br>
<br>Simpson's work was, of course, unfinished, and we cannot know how he would have handled the major scandals that afflicted the Met in the 1970s. It is clear, though, that some of the reflexes developed in response to relatively limited criticism in the 1960s&#151;the assumption that public and media attacks were ill informed or even malicious and that wrong-doing could be handled internally&#151;damaged the Met severely when far more substantial charges were laid against the drug squad and the obscene publications squad in the 1970s. As commissioner, Simpson had undertaken a very difficult balancing act, as he sought to raise the calibre of the Met without in the process damaging further the bruised morale of the force he had inherited. He had achieved considerable success in this operation by listening to the views and the grievances of his men and by coming almost instinctively to the force's defence at a time when it was believed throughout the Met that &#145;the Police Council, Home Office, MPs, church magazines, courts of criminal appeal, magistrates and the press all appeared to be against the police&#146; (Whitfield, 57, account of meeting with chief superintendents in January 1966). The vice squad superintendent and future assistant commissioner Gilbert Kelland noted that where the retirement of Simpson's predecessor, Sir John Nott-Bower, &#145;had hardly been noticed by the force&#146;  (Kelland, 99), Simpson's death in office evinced deep and genuine sadness from men of all ranks who saw him&#151;the first commissioner to rise from the Met's own ranks&#151;as &#145;one of us&#146;. The Met's renewed self-esteem reflected a necessary recovery of morale from the low point of the late 1950s, but a more bullish resistance to outside criticism threatened to become a liability when the force faced a reforming Home Office and a crusading press, pursuing genuinely damaging allegations. Had Simpson lived to retiring age it is likely that he would not have enjoyed his last few years in post, as the case for greater accountability and for external scrutiny became ever harder to resist, and his own reputation might well have suffered in the process. At the time of his death, though, what Kelland called Simpson's &#145;moderately iconoclastic&#146; approach to the reform of a notoriously intractable organization  (ibid., 133) had achieved tangible results, during what his erstwhile Hendon colleague Ranulph Bacon described as &#145;ten of the most progressive years our Service has ever known&#146;  (<span class="italic">Police Review</span>, 29 March 1968).<br>
