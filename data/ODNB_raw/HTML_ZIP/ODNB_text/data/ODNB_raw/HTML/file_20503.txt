<span class="headword">O'Connell, Sir  Maurice Charles</span>  (1812&#150;1879), <span class="occ">soldier, administrator, and politician in Australia</span>, was born on 13 January 1812 at the military barracks in what became Wynyard Square, Sydney. He was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20504/', "Sir Maurice Charles Philip O'Connell (1768&#150;1848)")</script>, lieutenant-governor of New South Wales, and his wife, Mary Putland (1782/3&#150;1864), daughter of former governor William Bligh. In 1814 the family were transferred with his father's regiment to Ceylon, where Maurice lived until the age of seven, when he was sent for his education to Britain. He attended Dr Pinkney's School at East Sheen, Surrey, then Edinburgh high school, followed by studies in Dublin, then at the Coll&egrave;ge Charlemagne in Paris. At the age of sixteen he joined the 73rd regiment, and later described himself as &#145;zealously devoted&#146;  (McDonald, 116) to the military profession. He served with his regiment in Gibraltar, Malta, and Jersey, and was made lieutenant in January 1834. On 23 July 1835 O'Connell married Eliza Emiline (1813&#150;1903), daughter of Colonel Philip Le Geyt of the 63rd regiment. They had no children.<br>
<br>In September 1835 O'Connell left for Spain as part of the British Legion, to fight in the First Carlist War, leading a regiment of volunteers he had raised in Ireland. During two years in Spain he rose to the rank of brigadier-general in the legion, and received three Spanish decorations. On returning to Britain he was reappointed a lieutenant in the 51st regiment, and in June 1838 purchased the commission of captain in the 28th regiment. Soon afterwards, he travelled to serve with his regiment in New South Wales in the company of his father, who had been appointed to the command of all military forces in the colony, and to whom he became assistant military secretary. In 1842, when his regiment was transferred to India, O'Connell chose to remain in New South Wales, before selling his commission two years later and becoming established as a horse breeder and pastoralist.<br>
<br>O'Connell then took an interest in the politics of the colony, and in 1843 stood for a place in the newly created New South Wales legislative council. Although closely aligned with the &#145;exclusives&#146; of the town  (<span class="italic">Brisbane Courier</span>, 24 March 1879, 3) and being a &#145;rather conservative&#146; candidate  (Shaw, 216), he also received significant support from the Irish population&#151;a result, it seems, of his family's connection with the Irish nationalist leader Daniel O'Connell, a cousin of his father. Rioting during the election by his sympathizers, including &#145;500 supporters dressed in green&#146;  (McDonald, 118) who declared he &#145;was standing for the Roman Catholic church and freedom for Ireland&#146;  (Shaw, 216), was said to have lost him much support among other voters. He was defeated easily, but in August 1845 was elected to the council to represent the Port Phillip (later Victoria) district, an event that &#145;greatly gratified&#146; the governor, George Gipps, as O'Connell had defeated a leading spokesman of the squatter opposition to the government  (Shaw, 350).<br>
<br>O'Connell remained in the council for three years, before being appointed crown lands commissioner for the Burnett pastoral district, then in the far north of the colonized area of Australia. In 1854 he was appointed official resident in the development of Port Curtis as a government post. The establishment of this post has been called &#145;one of Sydney's most devious acts of self-interest&#146;  (Fitzgerald, 109), as it clearly had the aim of fostering a township (to be known as Gladstone) as a capital for the soon to be formed colony of Queensland. It was feared in New South Wales that the likely southern location of the new capital, at Brisbane, would mean that the northern parts of the older colony would look to it rather than to Sydney.<br>
<br>Excessive expenditure, with little return in terms of development, was incurred to achieve this aim, and for this O'Connell received the blame when the political atmosphere in New South Wales altered. Henry Parkes succeeded in having a select committee of inquiry into the post of resident established in August 1855. The committee criticized not only the apparent waste of government funds but also O'Connell's capabilities. Particularly condemned were his &#145;capriciousness and want of consideration&#146; in dealing with those under him, and the fact that his inordinate &#145;love of power&#146; affected his ability to encourage the district's development  (McDonald, 97). The position of government resident was abolished, and O'Connell returned to the post of lands commissioner. He was briefly reinstated as resident in response to a gold rush in the area in 1858, but again relieved of the post when Queensland was established in late 1859.<br>
<br>O'Connell resented the offer to return again to relatively junior positions and began a long campaign to receive compensation for the abolition of his post and the financial sacrifices he claimed his time at Port Curtis entailed. A later historian has suggested that his appointment to the Queensland legislative council in May 1860 was probably made &#145;for diplomatic reasons&#146;  (McDonald, 119). He was a minister without portfolio for three months in the Herbert government before being offered the presidency of the council in August 1860. As president, he acted in the place of the governor of the colony on four occasions, in gaps between viceregal appointments, and in 1868 was knighted.<br>
<br>O'Connell was embroiled in controversy on two occasions during his time as president. As acting governor in 1871 he was accused of accepting a bribe for agreeing to dissolve parliament. The resultant debate brought into the open his parlous financial state, and he was forced to admit that unpaid debts owing to the Bank of Queensland on his pastoral properties meant that the bank's official liquidator was about to take action against him. In 1875 his family connections to Daniel O'Connell again led to political difficulties. He attended a function commemorating the centenary of the nationalist leader's birth. During the ceremonies a toast to the health of the pope preceded the loyal toast to the queen. This caused a degree of outrage, and O'Connell was forced quickly and clearly to restate his loyalty to the monarch.<br>
<br>Most remembered of O'Connell was his tendency to appear &#145;hot of temper, sometimes inconsistent, inordinately proud&#146;  (McDonald, 88). Politically, he was &#145;very conservative &hellip; described as a high Tory&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brisbane Courier</span>, 24 March 1879, 3). He was provincial grandmaster of the freemasons of the Irish constitution, colonel of the Queensland volunteer brigade, and president of the Australasian Association and the Queensland turf club.<br>
<br>O'Connell remained president of the council until he died of throat cancer, while staying at Parliament House in Brisbane during renovations to his own home, on 23 March 1879. He was buried at Toowong cemetery, Brisbane, on 25 March.<br>
