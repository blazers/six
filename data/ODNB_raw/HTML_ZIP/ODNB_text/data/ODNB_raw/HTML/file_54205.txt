<span class="headword">Forrester family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1360&#150;<em>c.</em>1450), <span class="occ">administrators</span>, illustrates the growing importance of burgess families in Scottish politics during the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. <a name="cosubject_46960"></a><span class="headword">Sir Adam Forrester</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1405)<span class="occ"></span> combined a mercantile career with royal service. A merchant by 1363, he became clerk of the rolls in 1366, then served as exchequer auditor, deputy chamberlain, chamberlain of the queen's household, sheriff of Lothian, keeper of the great seal, and ambassador to England and Europe. He was custumar of Edinburgh from 1375 to 1405. In the 1380s he supervised fortification work at Edinburgh Castle. He lent large sums of money to the crown, and was financial agent for the earl of Caithness, the bishop of Aberdeen, and others. As a burgess of Edinburgh, he represented the town in parliament in 1370 and was alderman in 1373 and 1378. In 1387 he was party to a contract to enlarge St Giles's Church. Forrester came to possess extensive lands, including Niddrie and Drylaw near Edinburgh, Traquair in Peeblesshire, and Fingask in Aberdeenshire; Fingask was granted to him by the bishop of Aberdeen as a reward for his services. In 1376 he acquired Corstorphine in Edinburghshire, which became the family seat; he probably built Corstorphine Castle. He also held lands in Edinburgh, including property in Forrester's Wynd, where he lived for a time.<br>
<br>Forrester's first wife was probably Agnes (<i>d</i>. before 1405), daughter of John Dundas of Dundas, who held Fingask in Perthshire. His second wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. after 1429), was possibly a Forrester. Adam and Margaret had at least three children, <a href="#cosubject_54205">John [<i>see below</i>]</a>, Marie (<i>d</i>. after 1439), and Thomas (<i>d</i>. after 1431), who held the lands of Drylaw. Marie married first Andrew Leper, an Edinburgh burgess, and second, <i>c</i>.1402, Alan Farnlie, custumar of Edinburgh with John from 1406 to 1425.<br>
<br>Forrester was knighted by 1403, perhaps because of service at the battle of Hamildon Hill in 1402, where he and his son John were taken prisoner. He endowed three chaplains in the chapel of St John the Baptist which he founded in Corstorphine, beside the parish church. He was probably also a benefactor of St Machar's, Aberdeen, where his obit was recorded. He died on 13 October 1405, probably at Corstorphine Castle, and was probably buried either in St Giles's or in his chapel at Corstorphine. A tomb and a burial slab at St John's are traditionally associated with him, although their identification is not certain.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54204"></a><span class="headword">Walter Forrester</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1355, <em>d.</em> before 1426), <span class="occ">bishop of Brechin</span>, son of Marion Forrester (<i>b</i>. before 1353, <i>d</i>. before 1391) and brother of Patrick Forrester (<i>d</i>. after 1406), burgess of Dundee, was probably kin to Adam Forrester. The link cannot be established conclusively, but the two men moved in similar circles, and Walter witnessed documents of family interest to the Forresters of Corstorphine, and also served on peace commissions with Adam's eldest son, John. Walter's career embraced both Scottish royal service and university life in Paris. He studied at the University of Paris in the 1370s, graduating BA in 1375. In 1379 he returned to Scotland and by 1384 he was a canon of Aberdeen. He was royal wardrobe clerk (1380&#150;93), and also served as keeper of the privy seal, king's clerk, and auditor of the exchequer. In August 1390 he helped to arrange Robert II's funeral and Robert III's coronation, and in the same year he resigned his lands of Inverdovet in Fife to his brother Patrick. About 1393 he went back to Paris to graduate MA, and became involved in university affairs; he supported the withdrawal of obedience from the Avignon pope Benedict XIII (<i>r</i>. 1394&#150;1417) in 1398.<br>
<br>After returning to Scotland Forrester served on the duke of Rothesay's governing council, and acted as exchequer auditor (1399&#150;1404), king's secretary (1402&#150;5), and clerk of the rolls (<i>c</i>.1403&#150;25). He was rewarded for his service to Robert II and Robert III, and for his future service to Prince James, with a life annuity from 1406. In 1405 he went to France, possibly to arrange for Prince James's proposed stay. He remained abroad, and in 1407 was made bishop of Brechin by Benedict XIII, to whose allegiance he had returned. His royal service in Scotland resumed under the duke of Albany after 1408. He participated in embassies to discuss James I's release from captivity in England, and was also influential in Scottish policy towards the papal schism. Forrester was abroad again from 1422 to 1424, and during this period visited the curia in Rome, presenting a petition there. He died before April 1426.<br>
<br>Sir Adam Forrester's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_54205"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Forrester</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1448<span class="mult">x</span>50)<span class="occ"></span>, had been knighted by 1406. He was deputy chamberlain (1406&#150;22), master of the king's household, custodian of the great seal, auditor of the rolls, and custumar of Edinburgh (1405&#150;31). He helped to negotiate James I's release from England, and became his trusted servant; he was appointed chamberlain in 1424 and was on the king's council in 1437. In 1425 Corstorphine and adjacent lands were erected into a barony. After James I's murder in 1437 the earl of Douglas became Forrester's patron. Chancellor William Crichton (<i>d</i>. 1454) burnt his Corstorphine lands in 1445 because the family had aided Douglas in an attack on the Crichtons at Barnton, Edinburghshire. Forrester last served as chamberlain in 1448; whether he retired owing to waning Douglas influence or to infirmity is unclear. In 1448 the pope allowed Forrester and his wife, Marion, &#145;old and stricken in years&#146;, a private confessor. Forrester was patron to St Giles's, where he founded an altar <i>c</i>.1425, and St Machar's. He and his mother endowed two more chaplains in St John's Chapel at Corstorphine in 1429; he obtained papal recognition of it as a collegiate church in 1444, and it became the family's burial place.<br>
<br>Forrester married first Margaret (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1408); second Jean St Clair (<i>d</i>. before 1422), daughter of the earl of Orkney; and third, <i>c</i>.1422, Marion Stewart (<i>c</i>.1380&#150;<i>c</i>.1448) of Dalswinton, Dumfriesshire, widow of Sir John Stewart of Garlies, Kirkcudbrightshire. From either his first or second marriage he had four children: Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. after 1408), who married Sir Alexander Lauder of Halton; John, his heir (<i>b</i>. before 1425, <i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1456), who married into the Edinburgh family of Wigmer; Henry (<i>b</i>. before 1425, <i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1473), who married Helen, daughter of John Farnlie of Braid; and Jonet (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1488), who married Robert, Lord Maxwell (<i>d</i>. 1485). John Forrester (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1437), who held Kirkmahoe benefice in Dumfriesshire, was probably an illegitimate son. Forrester died between 20 September 1448 and 20 September 1450; he was buried in St John's Church, Corstorphine. A tomb near the altar is assumed to be that of Sir John and one of his wives. The Forresters were among the most successful of those fourteenth-century mercantile families who used their financial talents in royal service to rise into the gentry.<br>
