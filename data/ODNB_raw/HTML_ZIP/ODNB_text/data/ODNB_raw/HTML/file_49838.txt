<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Joyce,  Eileen Alannah</span>  (1912&#150;1991), <span class="occ">pianist</span>, was born Eileen Joyce (she acquired her middle name, Alannah, later) on 21 November 1912 near Zeehan, Tasmania, the only child of Joseph Joyce, a failed mining prospector and itinerant labourer of Irish descent, and his wife, Alice, of Spanish descent. She was reportedly born in a tent, her only home during her earliest years, and went barefoot with only a pet kangaroo named Twink for company. Later she was taken by her parents to the Australian mainland, where the family lived in an iron shack in the outback of Western Australia, between Perth and the town of Boulder. A priest found her a place at the Loreto Convent School, Osborne, where one teacher was Esther Pickering (mother of Sir John Drummond, controller of BBC Radio 3 and director of the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts). She was obliged to sit with other non-paying pupils at the back of the class and was usually known as Ragged Eilie. An instinctive musicality began to appear unbidden whenever she was near a piano, and she soon learned the rudiments of music (and of civilized living) from the instruction she received there. The school authorities brought her to the attention of the Australian composer&#150;pianist Percy Grainger when he was visiting the area in 1926 (she was then aged fourteen). The &#145;rebellious redhead&#146; (as Esther Drummond remembered her) was to Grainger &#145;the most transcendentally gifted child&#146; he had ever heard, an opinion endorsed by the famous German pianist Wilhelm Backhaus while on an Australian tour.<br>
<br>Backhaus urged that Joyce should be sent to his own alma mater, the Leipzig conservatory, an idea that could not be entertained in her existing circumstances until Grainger added deeds to words and took it on himself to lead a fund-raising campaign for her. In due course the inexperienced girl was shipped out alone to what must have been the terrifying environment of a leading European music centre, where not merely the language was alien; she regrettably left no account of how she adjusted to this change. She spent three years in Leipzig as a pupil first of Max Pauer, the conservatory director, and then of the redoubtable Robert Teichm&uuml;ller, a martinet-style teacher whose methods almost broke her spirit but effectively laid the foundations of her astonishing technical facility. This was polished later in London by Tobias Matthay (Uncle Tobs to her) and Adelina de Lara, the last surviving pupil of Clara Schumann, who featured Eileen Joyce in some duet performances, then by the distinguished Artur Schnabel in Berlin.<br>
<br>Joyce's brief but brilliant professional career began in earnest when Teichm&uuml;ller introduced her to the conductor Albert Coates, for whom she performed Prokofiev's third concerto, then a rarity on account of its technical difficulty. Much impressed, Coates recommended her to Sir Henry Wood, with whom she made her major d&eacute;but at his 1930 Promenade Concerts playing the same concerto, followed some months later by the even rarer Busoni <span class="italic">Konzert-Fantasie</span> for piano and orchestra, and then by Franck's <span class="italic">Symphonic Variations</span> under Sir Thomas Beecham. During the 1930s her repertory multiplied at a prodigious rate and came to number some seventy-five concertos and over 500 solo works.<br>
<br>Joyce had begun to make gramophone records even in advance of her formal concert d&eacute;but as a result of the odd circumstances of her fortuitous introduction to the medium. To prepare herself for an audition she went to the Parlophone studios to make a private recording of the Liszt F minor &eacute;tude, <span class="italic">La leggierezza</span>, to check on her performance. Returning to collect the disc and pay the fee, she was politely refused and instead invited by the label's director to record something else for the other side. This she did, playing a dazzling flamboyant study in A[flat] by Paul de Schlozer. Parlophone, amazed, paid her a fee and turned the recordings into her first public issue. Her performances of both pieces were included on a CD issued much later by EMI Records, <span class="italic">The Eileen Joyce Album</span>.<br>
<br>On 16 September 1937 Joyce married Douglas Legh Barratt (1899/1900&#150;1942), stockbroker, son of Legh Barratt, stockbroker. They had one son before Barratt's death in 1942. After her marriage, Joyce continued performing under her maiden name. Shortly before the destruction of London's Queen's Hall in an air raid in 1941, she appeared there in the &#145;manifesto concert&#146; devised by J. B. Priestley to stimulate support for cultural activity in wartime and to boost the ailing London Philharmonic Orchestra. She later toured with the orchestra to a succession of blitzed cities, often to perform in the most improvised conditions at best. During this time she developed a liking for playing three (sometimes four) concertos in one programme, accompanied by corresponding changes in the glamorous concert gowns she favoured to set off her striking physical image, a tactic which somehow drew sceptical critical views of her musical achievement. (According to Sir John Drummond, she &#145;had destroyed her serious standing through her obsession with changing her dresses. It was a bonus for the popular press, but did nothing for the music&#146;  (Drummond, 495).) She countered such views by claiming to suit the colour of her dress to her own esoteric views of the music concerned, as well as to relieve habitual nervousness before the next item. Most in demand were the more popular classics, notably the concertos of Grieg, Chopin, and Rakhmaninov, but she kept an interest in some newer trends, and gave the UK premi&egrave;res of both the concertos by Dmitry Shostakovich.<br>
<br>After the war ended in 1945, Joyce moved on to the international circuit, returning as a celebrity to her native Australia in 1948. She later visited South Africa, the USA (where she was dubbed by a leading New York critic &#145;the world's greatest unknown pianist&#146;), the Soviet Union, India, and many areas in the Far East, where in 1960 she suddenly announced her impending retirement. Her heavy performing schedule (she sometimes gave fifty concerts a season in London alone) took its toll: her fingers at times required taping for their protection, and associated muscular stress obliged her to seek increasing medical attention. Apart from giving an isolated charity concert in 1966, she moved into retirement with her second husband, Christopher Mann (whom she had married in or before 1951), on a farm near Sir Winston Churchill's old home at Chartwell, Kent. In 1981 she was appointed CMG, an unusual distinction for a performing artist. Her academic honours included honorary degrees from Cambridge and from the universities of Western Australia and Melbourne. She died on 25 March 1991, and was survived by her husband and the son of her first marriage.<br>
