<span class="headword">Curtin,  John</span>  (1885&#150;1945), <span class="occ">prime minister of Australia</span>, was born in Creswick, Victoria, on 8 January 1885, the eldest of the four children of John Curtin (1854&#150;1919), a policeman, and his wife, Catherine Bourke (1859&#150;1938). Both parents were Irish-born. Curtin's father was invalided out of the police force in 1890 and spent the next eight years as a hotel manager in Melbourne and several towns in rural Victoria before settling, poor and unemployed, in the Melbourne suburb of Brunswick. Educated at a succession of schools, young John had to leave to become the family breadwinner. He was a printer's devil, page-boy, office boy, and labourer, then in 1903 became an estimates clerk for an iron manufacturer. As he later recalled, the last was a &#145;school of profound computations&#146; in which:<blockquote>for seven years, I calculated, measured, and otherwise evolved the precise cost to a gentleman profiteer of importing iron from Germany, running it through an abominable noisy machine, and passing it on to a nicely organized trust, preparatory to its consumption by the building contractors of Australia. (Ross, 9)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Earlypoliticalcareer"></a>Early political career</h2>Jack Curtin joined the Brunswick Political Labor Council and the Victorian Socialist Party, under the respective tutelage of two gifted English immigrant agitators, Frank Anstey and Tom Mann, and soon gained a reputation as a boy orator on the Yarra Bank and on Melbourne street corners and as a contributor to the weekly <span class="italic">Socialist</span>. He also found time to play amateur cricket and football. In 1908 he moved the resolution to change the name of the Political Labor Council to the Australian Labor Party and, despite his affiliations with the Victorian Socialist Party, also moved that the party should never ally itself with others. He described himself as a utopian revolutionary socialist and criticized those Labor men, Anstey included, who joined that &#145;upholstered gas-works&#146;  (Day, 158) known as parliament rather than working in the industrial movement.<br>
<br>In 1911 Curtin accepted a full-time post as secretary of the Victorian Timberworkers' Union and was soon very active recruiting members, founding and editing a newspaper, and campaigning for the <span class="roman">Workers' Compensation Act</span> (1914). In the federal elections of 1914 his ambition overruled his ideology and he stood unsuccessfully for the seat of Balaclava&#151;&#145;a first-rate fighter with the mild appearance of a curate&#146;  (Ross, 33), wrote the Sydney <span class="italic">Bulletin</span>. Violently against the war, disillusioned by union routine and corruption, and drinking far too hard, Curtin resigned his post in November 1915 to work on a short-term project for the politically and industrially powerful Australian Workers' Union, but he had to enter a private hospital in mid-1916 to dry out. Though Curtin later abstained for long periods, he never fully overcame his drink problem and smoked forty cigarettes a day until his last months.<br>
<br>Curtin was back into the political fray in August 1916, when he was appointed secretary to the national executive of the Australian trade union anti-conscription campaign. He agreed with the Hardie&#150;Vaillant resolution of the Socialist International of 1910 in favour of a general strike to prevent war, and argued that socialism would conquer both war and poverty. He addressed many meetings, including one of 50,000 on the Yarra Bank, wrote pamphlets, and worked &#145;with the energy of a tornado&#146;  (Ross, 50). Conscription was defeated in two plebiscites, but at the cost of splitting the Labor Party and losing government. In the aftermath of the first vote Curtin, who had refused a call-up for local military service, was gaoled for three days. During the second campaign he was fined for preaching revolution.<br>
<br>In February 1917, with a salary rise, Curtin was appointed editor of the <span class="italic">Westralian Worker</span>, which was supported by the Australian Workers' Union, in Perth, Western Australia, and on 21 April he married Elsie (1890&#150;1975), daughter of Abraham Needham, a Tasmanian fellow socialist, in a local register office&#151;she being a Methodist and Curtin a lapsed Catholic. A daughter was born in late 1917 and a son in 1921. Curtin began remaking himself as a moderate and respectable journalist, and in due course bought his first house in the fashionable beachside suburb of Cottesloe, a train ride from his downtown office.<h2>
<a name="Entersparliament"></a>Enters parliament</h2>Curtin tried again to enter the federal parliament in 1919, standing unsuccessfully for Perth. In 1921 he supported the insertion of the socialization objective into the Labor platform, but he was an implacable opponent of the communists, earning their lasting enmity when he opposed the Fremantle seamen's strike of 1924. During the 1920s he was a moving spirit in the Western Australia branch of the Australian Journalists' Association and instrumental in introducing a journalism diploma at the university. In 1924 he travelled to Geneva as an Australian delegate to a meeting of the International Labour Organization, and in 1927&#150;8 he served on a federal royal commission into child endowment, filing a minority report in favour. He failed to win the federal seat of Fremantle in 1925 but finally won it in November 1928. Barring an interlude from 1931 to 1934, he held Fremantle for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>In Canberra, Curtin quickly became a back-bencher to watch, though he narrowly missed election to the front bench when Labor formed government at the end of 1929. His major preoccupation was with financial reform to alleviate unemployment&#151;the expansion of credit via changes in the reserve bank rules. Instead, the government adopted the deflationary premiers' plan in 1931, and the party split again, as it had over conscription. Curtin was unheeded when he argued for maintaining party unity at the expense of office and allowing the conservatives to implement the draconian plan. In the subsequent election he lost his seat.<br>
<br>Curtin returned to Perth and made his living as a freelance journalist, though early in 1933 he was appointed full-time paid chairman of the advisory council to prepare Western Australia's case for the Commonwealth Grants Commission. Secession was in the air in Western Australia, and Curtin demonstrated how the state's industries suffered under the federal arrangements. In September 1934 he regained the seat of Fremantle.<br>
<br>James Scullin stepped down as Labor leader in October 1935 and Curtin, after pledging privately to abstain from alcohol, was elected by one vote as his successor. Curtin inherited a party in disarray. In New South Wales, J. T. Lang's dominant faction had been expelled from the party in 1931 and was still estranged. A unity conference brought some of the Langites into federal caucus in 1936, but these &#145;cannibals&#146;  (Day, 323) were to cause Curtin problems for years to come. As leader Curtin chose his policy ground well: avoiding the divisive financial questions, he concentrated on national defence. While the conservative Lyons government relied on imperial defence and appeasement of the dictators, Curtin stressed continental defence (army and air force over navy) and non-intervention in Abyssinia and Spain. This also masked the rift in his party between right-wing Catholics and the international socialists. Domestically, he now stood for &#145;the maximum of Socialistic benefits within the capitalist system&#146;  (ibid., 353). Curtin lost his first federal elections as leader in 1937, but made modest gains.<br>
<br>When war broke out in Europe in 1939 Labor opposed the reintroduction of compulsory military training and the dispatch of Australian forces overseas, arguing that the best contribution Australia could make to the war effort was to see to its own defences. However, when Germany invaded France and the Low Countries, Labor agreed to send reinforcements: &#145;The men are there and we will not abandon them&#146;  (Ross, 186). At the federal elections in September 1940 Labor came within a whisker of government, and the prime minister, Robert Menzies, offered Labor places in a national government. Fearing another split in his fragile party, Curtin refused, though he promised full co-operation in the war effort and agreed to join an advisory war council. Curtin's patience was rewarded a year later when, in quick succession, Menzies was overthrown and Arthur Fadden's new government lasted only forty days before two independents crossed the floor to put Labor into power.<h2>
<a name="Primeminister19411945"></a>Prime minister, 1941&#150;1945</h2>Curtin became prime minister on 7 October 1941. Shrewdly, he kept the best conservative appointees in place, among them S. M. Bruce, the former prime minister, as high commissioner in London, General Sir Thomas Blamey as commander of the 2nd Australian Imperial Force, Frederick Shedden as cabinet secretary, and Essington Lewis, the chief executive of the mining giant Broken Hill Proprietary, as munitions supremo. Curtin made his main rival, H. V. Evatt, foreign minister, and placed one of the leading Langites, E. J. Ward, in charge of the vexed area of labour and national service. He told one of his senior public servants to &#145;Carry out Menzies' policy. There's nothing wrong with his policy&#151;only see that it is carried out!&#146;  (Ross, 223).<br>
<br>No sooner was Labor in government than Australia's war changed utterly when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Manila, simultaneously bringing the United States into the conflict and threatening the invasion of Australia. Curtin broadcast a defiant message next day: &#145;We shall hold this country and keep it as a citadel for the British-speaking race and as a place where civilization will persist&#146;  (Serle, 554). His new year's message put the situation more starkly: &#145;Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom &hellip; we know &hellip; that Australia can go and Britain still hold on&#146;  (Ross, 247). It then went on to demand an all-in effort.<br>
<br>Churchill smarted at Curtin's &#145;harsh tones&#146;  (Day, 439), and Roosevelt thought the message &#145;tasted of panic and disloyalty&#146;  (Ross, 247), but the United States was already determined to use Australia as a main base, and Curtin as national leader was simply trying to establish publicly some semblance of control. Curtin gratefully accepted Churchill's offer to send the bulk of Australia's forces back to defend their home soil, but was dumbfounded when, in the light of the fall of Singapore on 15 February 1942, Churchill further suggested that the 7th division be diverted to Rangoon. Losing the Singapore base, and with it the Australian 8th division, was, in Curtin's words, an &#145;inexcusable betrayal&#146;  (Ross, 258), and he refused to sacrifice another. Curtin won the &#145;cable fight&#146;  (Day, 440), though the troops had to continue their way across the Indian Ocean without naval escort. It is much less well known that Curtin consented to Australia's 9th division's remaining in the Middle East until 1943 and to other elements of the 6th division being diverted to Ceylon.<br>
<br>Curtin welcomed the United States general Douglas MacArthur as the allied commander for the south-west Pacific area in March and placed Australia's forces at his disposal. &#145;You take care of the rear and I will handle the front&#146;  (Day, 463), MacArthur said. Curtin set about his task with great thoroughness. By means of radio and the press he &#145;made friends with the nation&#146;  (Ross, 269), coaxing and chiding them into maximum effort. With his principal lieutenant, J. B. Chifley, the treasurer, he defied party dogma to introduce industrial conscription (&#145;the manpower&#146;). There followed rationing of all kinds, fully federalized income taxes, pay-as-you-earn taxation, and the mobilization of huge numbers of women. At its peak in 1943 Labor had more than doubled the numbers in the armed forces and war work. Australia achieved 71.4 per cent engagement of its workforce in direct war activities to the United Kingdom's 75.1 per cent. Manufacturing boomed. War loans were oversubscribed. Strikes, though not eliminated, were kept under control: &#145;putting miners in gaol would not produce coal&#146;  (Day, 520). Unemployment benefits were made available and child endowment increased. The &#145;total war economy&#146; not only helped win the war but also made life in general better for the nation.<br>
<br>In November 1942 Australian volunteers and thousands of American conscripts were fighting in the islands above Australia, while Australian conscripts were restricted by their terms of enlistment to national territory. In these circumstances Curtin felt he must risk some form of conscription for overseas military service. Given his and his party's history, the decision was most difficult. Unlike W. M. Hughes in 1916, Curtin used the mechanisms of the party, carefully persuading sufficient members of the state and federal executive committees to accept a compromise: the conscripts would fight only beneath the equator in and about New Guinea, effectively in an extended defence of the mainland. Curtin carried his party, and the bill became law in February 1943.<br>
<br>In the federal elections of September 1943 Curtin and Labor were rewarded with substantial majorities in both houses, though a referendum a year later failed to secure the continuation of federal war powers into the looming peace in order to facilitate reconstruction. In January 1944 Australia and New Zealand signed a regional pact engineered by Evatt to stake British Commonwealth claims in the region after the war. This considerably annoyed the Americans, and Curtin distanced himself adroitly from Evatt's excesses when he visited Washington in April. In London for the Commonwealth prime ministers' conference mid-year, Curtin floated the idea of pooling sovereignty in a permanent Commonwealth secretariat and council, the better to integrate and co-ordinate British and dominion activities post-war, but found no interest from the Canadians, South Africans, and British. He wished to use the Commonwealth to bolster Australia's position as &#145;the bastion of British institutions &hellip; in the Southern World&#146;  (Day, 543) and act as a counterpoise to American influence there.<br>
<br>Curtin had had heart trouble for some years and suffered a serious attack in November 1944. While he returned to work briefly in the new year, he was again hospitalized in March, and he died at the prime minister's lodge in Canberra on 5 July 1945, a month before the end of the Pacific war. Though a long-time rationalist, he was buried on 8 July with Presbyterian rites in Perth's Karrakatta cemetery.<h2>
<a name="Achievement"></a>Achievement</h2>Curtin stood 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighed about 12 stone. Bespectacled and soberly dressed, he might have been a suburban bank manager. A cast in his left eye had to be hidden by his image makers. Often withdrawn and of a nervous disposition, he steeled himself for his public work, but his sincerity, superb oratorical and literary skills, mastery of his brief, consummate powers of conciliation, and sound political sense made him an exceptional war leader. His great achievement was to keep the Labor Party united and effective in government through Australia's darkest hour. To do so, he had the wisdom to abandon some of his and his party's earlier principles, and Australia was the better for it.<br>
