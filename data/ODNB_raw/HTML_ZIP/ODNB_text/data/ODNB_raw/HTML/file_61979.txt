<span class="headword">Erbery,  Dorcas</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1656&#150;1659), <span class="occ">Quaker preacher</span>, possibly born in Cardiff, was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8832/', "William Erbery (1604/5&#150;1654)")</script>, puritan minister, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1667&times;70), who also became a Quaker preacher. Young female preachers often followed the missionary tradition practised by their mothers. Thus Quaker daughters, it has been suggested, acted as female &#145;apprentices&#146; and this is indicated in the actions of Dorcas Erbery, who undertook missionary journeys with her mother and suffered with her for her Quaker beliefs. In June 1656, when accompanied by Tobias (Toby) Hodge, she was arrested and imprisoned in Cardiff gaol for disturbing a local clergyman in the market place. In the following month she was again arrested and imprisoned in Exeter, along with her mother and many other Friends, &#145;among Felons and lay generally in straw by reason of which, and the filth of the place, many of them fell sick&#146;  (Besse, 1.149). It is possible that Dorcas could have contracted a disease while in prison but was able to survive it&#151;unlike her fellow Quaker missionary Jane Ingram.<br>
<br>Dorcas Erbery, is, however, best known for her involvement on 24 October 1656 as one of the Quaker women who accompanied James Nayler, the leading Quaker preacher, during his symbolic entry into Bristol. She took a leading part in the re-enactment by Nayler of Christ's entry into Jerusalem. During her appearance before the local magistrates on 27 October Erbery told the magistrates that Nayler had earlier raised her from the dead while imprisoned in Exeter between July and August 1656: a claim which Nayler strenuously denied, commenting that only God had the power of life and death. During Nayler's court case for blasphemy at Bristol (5&#150;16 December 1656) Erbery argued that Nayler &#145;shall sit at the right hand of the Father and shall Judge the world&#146;  (Farmer, 19) and claimed further that Nayler was &#145;the only begotten son of God &hellip; I know of no other Saviour but him&#146;  (ibid., 18). Erbery's words led to suspicions that she was either mad or bewitched. Such sentiments were given greater credence when she joined Martha Simmonds and Hannah Stranger near the pilloried Nayler in emulation of the women who had assembled at the crucifixion of Christ.<br>
<br>The Nayler episode nevertheless divided the Quakers, who were now split between those expressing the ecstasy of God's word in ranting behaviour and those who used more conventional Quaker means of proclaiming their message. In 1657 George Fox specifically admonished those Cardiff Quakers who &#145;had run out with James Naylor&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of George Fox</span>, 292), notably Dorcas Erbery, who &#145;seems not to have expressed any remorse for what occurred. Indeed she may well have been among those who continued to be a disruptive influence among Quakers of the &#147;mainstream&#148; for some months after their release&#146;  (Trevett, &#145;William Erbery and his daughter Dorcas&#146;, 37).<br>
<br>Undaunted by her experience of imprisonment and the ridicule heaped upon her, Erbery remained committed to the Quaker cause. It has been suggested further that &#145;the country-wide disapproval among Friends of James Nayler's followers had done nothing to dampen the ardour of Dorcas Erbery or her enthusiasm for public ministry&#146;  (Trevett, &#145;William Erbery and his daughter Dorcas&#146;, 35). Along with her widowed mother Dorcas Erbery, as an unmarried preacher, had time to devote to the Quaker cause and remained unmarried until at least 1658. She returned to Cardiff, where she and Toby Hodge were imprisoned in the summer of 1658 for berating the local presbyterian minister, Benjamin Flower, at St John's Church. The &#145;Great book of sufferings&#146; compiled by Friends recorded that, although both Quakers were briefly released, they were nevertheless &#145;brought in againe by order of Reece Davis bailiffe&#146;  (&#145;Great book of sufferings&#146;, vol. 2, fol. 3). The protector's council called upon the keeper of Cardiff gaol for an account of their &#145;commitment and detention&#146; as they had not been brought to trial  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1658</i>, 165). The reply from the keeper stated that both Quakers were detained for their disruption of divine service on 19 July, and as no general sessions court had been held since their apprehension they were being held over until the next assize. It is likely that Dorcas had interrupted Flower on a later occasion as her mittimus was not signed until 31 August. Even after these inquiries, which seem to indicate that the Quakers had acted illegally, they were released and &#145;neverr brought to tyrall&#146;  (&#145;Great book of sufferings&#146;, vol. 2, fol. 3).<br>
<br>A further record in 1658 noted that Dorcas Erbery was again arrested and imprisoned in Bristol gaol with many other Friends for &#145;preaching and declaring the truth to the people in the public places of resort and concourse&#146;  (Besse, 1.365). She was again imprisoned in London in 1659 along with her mother and Esther Biddle, another female Quaker missionary, for public preaching. After this date, however, she disappears from the Quaker records and to date there has been little evidence as to her whereabouts thereafter. It is known that in 1658 she was unmarried, but in the will of her mother, proved in 1670, there is a reference to the unnamed children of Dorcas. No provision was made for Dorcas, which would suggest that she had died in the 1660s. Christine Trevett has suggested that, like many of her co-religionists, she may have emigrated to America or the West Indies. Indeed her sister Lydia Erbery had married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9256/', "Henry Fell")</script>, a Quaker missionary in the West Indies, and many other Friends Dorcas associated with had made their way there. What became of Dorcas Erbery is difficult to tell and it can only be conjectured that she &#145;married, embraced sobriety and died&#146; or &#145;remained a troublesome woman in the eyes of society, and a non-conformist one even in Quaker circles, so that she was sidelined quietly in Quaker records&#146;  (Trevett, &#145;William Erbery and his daughter Dorcas&#146;, 43).<br>
