<span class="headword">Villiers,  Thomas Hyde</span>  (1801&#150;1832), <span class="occ">politician</span>, born on 27 January 1801, was the second son of George Villiers (1759&#150;1827), who married, on 17 April 1798, Theresa (1775&#150;1856), only daughter of John Parker, first Baron Boringdon. Villiers's father died at Kent House, Knightsbridge, on 21 March 1827; his mother survived until 1855. Three of Thomas's brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28297/', "G. W. F. Villiers")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28286/', "C. P. Villiers")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28298/', "H. M. Villiers")</script>.<br>
<br>Villiers was educated at home and very imperfectly. He was then sent with his eldest brother, George, to St John's College, Cambridge, and, keenly conscious of his own defects, set to work to repair the loss of time. At Cambridge he mixed with Charles Austin, Edward Strutt, John Romilly, T. B. Macaulay, and other young men of ability and advanced opinions, several of them influenced by the views of Jeremy Bentham. In 1822 he graduated BA, and in 1825 MA. After taking his degree in 1822 he entered the Colonial Office, where early in 1824 Sir Henry Taylor (1800&#150;1866) became his subordinate and then his close friend.<br>
<br>The brothers lived during their earlier years with their parents in part of Kent House at Knightsbridge, but from 1825 Thomas Villiers and Taylor shared a house in Suffolk Street. In that year, Villiers joined a debating club called the Academics, where several of his college friends, and J. S. Mill, discussed politics and economics. His chief speech, an hour long, on colonization &#145;made some noise, procured him a compliment and an invitation from the chancellor of the exchequer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Henry Taylor</span>, 6&#150;7). Not long afterwards Villiers abandoned the government service to embark on politics. His chief source of income from that date until his acceptance of office arose from the agencies for Berbice and Newfoundland  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 5, 1831, 283&#150;7).<br>
<br>At the general election in June 1826 Villiers was elected for Hedon in Yorkshire, and sat until the dissolution in 1830. In 1830 and 1831 he sat, respectively, for Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire (a family borough), and Bletchingley, and voted for the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> in all its stages. Villiers travelled in Ireland in 1828 with the object of informing himself on Irish affairs, and set out his views in long letters to Taylor. A letter written by him in February 1829 was shown to R. L. Sheil, who thereupon brought about the suppression of the Catholic Association. In 1831 Villiers suggested the formation of the royal commission on the poor law, and helped in its preliminary inquiries. On 18 May 1831 he became secretary to the Board of Control under Charles Grant (afterwards Lord Glenelg). On 22 August 1831 he made a long speech in the House of Commons on the Methuen treaty with Portugal  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 6, 1831, 437&#150;9). The committees on Indian affairs, whose labours formed the basis of subsequent legislation, were organized by Villiers, with the assistance of Lord Althorp. The question of the renewal of the charter to the East India Company, which came up for consideration at this time, demanded all his faculties, and official work weighed heavily. On 2 November 1831 Villiers and Taylor entered as students at Lincoln's Inn.<br>
<br>At the time of his death Villiers was a candidate for the constituency of Penryn and Falmouth in Cornwall, and had a promising political career. After three months' suffering from an abscess in the head, he died, unmarried, on 3 December 1832 at Carclew, the seat of Sir Charles Lemon, near Penryn, where he was staying. A monument was placed to his memory in Mylor church. Villiers possessed &#145;indefatigable industry and a clear understanding, set off by pleasing address and considerable powers of speaking&#146;. It was a scheme of his to give &#145;parliamentary seats, without votes, to persons holding certain offices&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Henry Taylor</span>, 196).<br>
