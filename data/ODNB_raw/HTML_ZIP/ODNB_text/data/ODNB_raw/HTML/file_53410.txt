<span class="headword">Barrow,  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1790&#150;1870), <span class="occ">maker of mathematical instruments</span>, may have been born in Suffolk. Nothing is known of his education or apprenticeship, beyond his attendance at the London Mechanics' Institute. He married Elizabeth Mary Collins (1790&#150;1834) in 1816 at Christ Church Greyfriars, London, producing six children by 1830, three of whom outlived him. The circumstances of Barrow's second marriage, between 1839 and 1868, remain obscure.<br>
<br>Barrow was an outworker for the mathematical instrument trade in London during the 1820s. He was well known to staff of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, who in 1829 introduced him to Sir George Everest (1790&#150;1863), surveyor-general of India, who was anxious to appoint a mathematical instrument maker to set up and run a new workshop for the survey based in Calcutta. Barrow was Everest's second choice for the post. He was taken on despite his age (about forty in 1830)&#151;which might affect his ability to cope with the Indian climate&#151;because of his good reputation, his steadiness, and his desire to make something of himself. Barrow accepted a five-year contract, uprooting his wife and family of six children, because it offered a chance to acquire the capital he needed to set up on his own account in London. Despite the deaths in Calcutta of his wife and six-year-old second son, William, he extended his contract for another four years in order to achieve this.<br>
<br>Barrow had to appoint and train a group of about nine people with few existing skills and no experience. Part of the work was to maintain and repair equipment for the revenue survey, which used simple surveying apparatus such as small theodolites and perambulators (measuring wheels), the latter lasting only about two years under normal field conditions. A more important task, in Everest's eyes, at least, was to repair the magnificent 3 foot theodolite and the zenith sector that were required for the measurement of a meridional arc extending from the tip of India to the foothills of the Himalayas. Everest had also purchased new equipment for the latter purpose while in England, and Barrow was needed to help set up the instruments for use.<br>
<br>Of the problems faced by Barrow, including professional isolation, inability to speak the languages, and living above the shop, by far the worst was his rapidly deteriorating relationship with Everest. Both men were strong-willed and independent. Everest, who could speak the native languages, was in the habit of dropping into the workshop several times a day when he was in Calcutta, and commenting on the work in hand. Some eighteen months after the start of his contract, Barrow lost his temper with Everest so severely that it triggered disciplinary procedures. (One consequence of this was that much information was disclosed about the instrument-making trade in London that would not otherwise have come to light.)<br>
<br>In 1837 Barrow was ordered up country to Kaliana to undertake the conversion of two field astronomy instruments to fixed-base observatory use. This involved recasting the metal supports for the telescopes and other complicated procedures that would not have been easy in a settled permanent workshop, let alone in the middle of the countryside with no facilities at all. Everest became ever more autocratic, Barrow's mood swings became more pronounced, and at the end of the job in 1839 Barrow was sacked and dispatched home to England.<br>
<br>Barrow's next appearance in the historical record shows him taking over the business of T. C. Robinson, a manufacturer of high-precision weighing balances and other special instruments. Barrow was well qualified to carry out such work and the business flourished quietly. Further orders arrived from the survey of India&#151;Barrow's professional skills were well appreciated and no slur had been placed on his workmanship&#151;and instruments under his signature went to Nepal with Joseph Dalton Hooker, to Spitsbergen with the Swedish ship <i>Eugenie</i>, and to the observatory at the Cape of Good Hope. Work on magnetic dip circles for expeditions formed a solid grounding for the future work on compasses that was to be the mainstay of the business after his retirement.<br>
<br>Barrow became a fellow of both the Royal Meteorological Society and the Royal Astronomical Society on his return to England, but does not appear to have played an active part in either. By the mid-1860s he was living at Belmont House, Westfield, near Hastings in Sussex, where he died on 2 April 1870 in his eightieth year. Examples of his work can be found in museum collections in England, India, and elsewhere. His son Henry, born in 1822, also became an instrument maker and took over his father's firm after his death. Another son, Francis, trained as a solicitor and became an appeal agent for the India privy council. A daughter Henrietta also survived him.<br>
