<span class="headword">Baker, Sir  Thomas Durand</span>  (1837&#150;1893), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Court of Hill, Shropshire, on 23 March 1837, son of John Durand Baker (1803/4&#150;1866), vicar of Bishop's Tawton, north Devon, and his wife, Sarah Georgiana, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fowler (<i>d</i>. 1848). He was educated at Cheltenham College. Baker was commissioned an ensign in the 18th (Royal Irish) regiment on 18 August 1854, served with his regiment at the siege of Sevastopol from 30 December 1854, and was mentioned in dispatches for gallantry on 18 June 1855 during the attack on the Redan redoubt. He was promoted lieutenant on 12 January 1855. He was present when the fortress fell on 8 September, and returned to England in July 1856. For his success during the war he received the campaign medal with clasp and the Turkish and Sardinian medals. In November 1857 he embarked with his regiment for India, to help suppress the Indian mutiny which had begun in May 1857. He served during 1858 with the field force operating in central India in pursuit of Tantia Topi. Baker was promoted captain on 26 October 1858, and successfully obtained admission to the Staff College at Camberley, from which he passed out in 1862.<br>
<br>In 1863 Baker accompanied the 2nd battalion, Royal Irish regiment to New Zealand; there he served as deputy assistant adjutant-general to the forces between 20 March 1864 and 31 March 1866, and then as assistant adjutant-general until the end of April 1867. He served as assistant military secretary to Lieutenant-General Sir Duncan Cameron in the engagement at Rangiriri on 20 November 1863, and participated in the Waikato and Wanganui campaigns in 1864&#150;6. Baker was a staff officer with Major-General Carey's force during the unsuccessful assault on Orakau on 31 March 1864 when he led one of the assault columns, and was also present when it was finally captured on 2 April. For his bravery, untiring energy, and zeal in New Zealand he was mentioned in dispatches and received the campaign medal, and on 21 March 1865 was given distriction a brevet majority. After the completion of his service in New Zealand in April 1867, he was stationed in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, where he became a prominent figure in horse-racing circles, briefly owning the champion steeplechaser Babbler, ridden by his acquaintance from Cheltenham schooldays Adam Lindsay Gordon.<br>
<br>On 2 October 1873 Baker was appointed assistant adjutant and quartermaster-general of the Asante expedition, and accompanied Sir Garnet Wolseley to the Gold Coast. He served throughout the campaign, participated in the engagement at Esaman (14 October), the relief of Abrakampa (5 and 6 November), the battle of Amoaful (31 January 1874), and the battle of Ordahsu and the capture of Kumasi (4 February). In addition to his duties as quartermaster-general, from 14 October 1873 to 17 December 1874 he also performed those of chief of staff. For his services in the Asante kingdom he was mentioned in dispatches by Wolseley, who attributed to Baker's untiring energy much of the success that had attended the operations, and expressed the view that he possessed &#145;every quality that is valuable to a staff officer&#146;. Baker was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel on 1 April 1874, received the medal with clasp, and was made a CB.<br>
<br>Following his return from the Gold Coast, on 22 May 1874 Baker was appointed a deputy assistant quartermaster-general on the headquarters staff in London, and on 10 November 1875 an assistant adjutant-general. On 21 April 1877 he was made an aide-de-camp to the queen, with rank of colonel in the army. During the 1877 Russo-Turkish War he was attached to the Russian army, and was present at the principal operations in the Balkans. In November 1878 he accompanied Lord Lytton, the new viceroy, to India, as his military secretary. Baker was serving as a member of the army reform commission&#151;appointed to examine reductions in the Indian army without impairing its efficiency&#151;when, in September 1879, news of the murder at Kabul of Sir Louis Cavagnari reached Simla. When Sir Frederick Roberts was ordered to advance on Kabul to seek retribution he requested that Baker should command the 2nd infantry brigade.<br>
<br>Baker accompanied Roberts when he rejoined his division in the Kurram valley and on 19 September was present when Afghan troops attacked entrenchments occupied by his brigade at the Shutar Gardan Pass. By 1 October 1879 the whole of the Kabul field force was concentrated in the Logar valley in Afghanistan. On 6 October Baker commanded his brigade during the successful battle of Charasia and was present when Kabul was reoccupied three days later. In November Baker led a force to Maidan, on the Kabul&#150;Ghazni Road, where he repulsed an Afghan attack before returning to Kabul. On 8 November he commanded a force co-operating with other columns, between Arghandeh and Maidan, attempting to destroy a large gathering of Afghans. However, on hearing news of the failure of Massey's column he returned to Kabul. Baker attacked an Afghan force occupying the Takht-i-Shah Hill on 13 December and the following day attacked the Asmai heights, although on this occasion he was forced by superior numbers to withdraw. On 23 December Baker took part in the complete defeat and dispersion of the Afghan force which had attacked the Sherpur entrenchments. Shortly afterwards he commanded an expedition which advanced into Kohistan and destroyed a fortified post. He commanded an infantry brigade of the force with which Roberts left Kabul for Kandahar on 9 August 1880, following the arrival of Sir Donald Stewart and news of the defeat of Maiwand, to relieve the beleaguered garrison. Following a three-week march Baker took a prominent part during the battle of Kandahar on 1 September, after which the city was relieved. He then returned to England. For his services in Afghanistan he was mentioned in dispatches, received the campaign medal with three clasps and a bronze star, and on 22 February 1881 was promoted KCB.<br>
<br>On 30 March 1881 Baker was appointed a brigadier-general under Sir Frederick Roberts, to command the base and line of communications in Natal in operations being planned against the Boers of the Transvaal following the earlier disastrous defeat at Majuba Hill. However, an armistice was concluded and Baker returned home the following September without having seen any active service. On 1 April 1882 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel, appointed deputy quartermaster-general in Ireland, and, on 3 September, deputy adjutant-general in Ireland.<br>
<br>Baker returned to India on 10 October 1884 when he was nominated adjutant-general in the East Indies, with the local rank of major-general. He served during the 1886&#150;7 Burmese expedition and was mentioned in dispatches. He was promoted major-general on 1 September 1866 and then held command of a division of the Bengal army until 1890. He then returned to England, and was appointed quartermaster-general to the forces at the Horse Guards on 1 October 1890. On 29 April 1891 he was made a temporary lieutenant-general and on 15 June 1892 was awarded a good-service pension. While on leave of absence from his duties at the War Office, Baker died of dropsy at the Hotel de France, Pau, France, on 9 February 1893, after a brief illness. He was buried on 18 February in Bishop's Tawton churchyard.<br>
