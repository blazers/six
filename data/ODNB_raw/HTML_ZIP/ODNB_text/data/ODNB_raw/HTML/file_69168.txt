<span class="headword">Butler <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Fitzgerald]</span>,  Margaret</span>, countess of Ossory and Ormond  (<em>d.</em> 1542), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, was the second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9554/', "Gerald Fitzgerald, eighth earl of Kildare (1456?&#150;1513)")</script>, lord deputy of Ireland, and his first wife, Alison (<i>d</i>. 1495), daughter and coheir to Roland Eustace, baron of Portlester. Margaret married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4199/', "Piers Butler, eighth earl of Ormond and first earl of Ossory (b. in or after 1467, d. 1539)")</script>, about 1485. In March 1509 she and her husband were admitted to the confraternity of the convent of Osney, near Oxford. She exercised a personal role in aspects of the administration of the Ormond patrimony: in March 1515 and again in November 1516 she presided at hearings held in Christ Church, Dublin, regarding the earldom of Ormond being entailed to male heirs. In March 1517 she appeared in the presence of a notary and the bishop of Ferns at St Saviour's Church in New Ross, co. Wexford, with regard to a case concerning the disputed possession of a house in the town.<br>
<br>Throughout her life, in her capacity as countess, Margaret Butler was party to successive indentures, bonds, and agreements concerning the transfer or ownership or custodianship of land, chiefly in counties Kilkenny, Tipperary, and Carlow. In 1526 letters patent were issued to Piers, earl of Ormond, and to his wife, granting them various castles, honours, and lands in counties Kilkenny and Tipperary to be held in tail male. Her preservation of Geraldine interests is evident in her interception of a letter written in 1525 by her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9555/', "Gerald Fitzgerald, ninth earl of Kildare")</script>, to the earl of Desmond. In it, Kildare entreated Desmond to join forces with him, unaware, as he claimed, of the fact that Desmond was engaged in continental intrigue against Henry VIII at this time. In 1537 a grand jury of the commons of co. Kilkenny complained that Ossory, his wife, and their children indiscriminately imposed coign and livery exactions in their lordship.<br>
<br>In his will, dated 28 May 1539, Piers Butler appointed Margaret his executor, along with two of their sons, Richard and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4189/', "James Butler, later ninth earl of Ormond and second earl of Ossory")</script>. In September 1539 she and her second son, Richard, were granted all profits arising from Piers's property since his death in the previous August. In April 1540 she was resident at Kilkenny and in May of that year she signed an indenture to secure one-third of the land which James Butler was to inherit. One gains some insight into the extent of her wealth from the terms of this agreement. She was to receive the castles, towns, and manors of Donmore, Donfert, Bennitsbridge, Ballykive, and Whitsbrownstown in co. Kilkenny, Tullow and Bynecorre in co. Carlow, and Killenaule in co. Tipperary. At that time she also presented James with Ir&pound;100, twenty-four milk cows, and twenty-four stud mares. In July 1540 Margaret was in Waterford, from where she sent Henry VIII a gift of hawks. Up to her death she continued her personal participation in the administration of the Ormond estate.<br>
<br>In the Jacobean era Margaret and her husband were celebrated for having brought civilization to Tipperary and Kilkenny and for having provided a good example to the inhabitants of both counties by bringing artificers from Flanders and other countries to make tapestries, cushions, and carpets. Margaret was patron of a school near the churchyard of St Canice's Cathedral, Kilkenny, and the reconstruction of Gowran Castle, co. Kilkenny, is attributed to her. Contemporaries acknowledge that the countess was the dominant party in the marriage. The ninth earl of Kildare referred to his sister as &#145;my lady, his [Piers's] wife, by whom he is only ruled&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, vol. 2, pt 3, 123). Richard Stanihurst's account is of a formidable woman whose husband governed well:<blockquote>through the singular wisdom of his Countess, a lady of such port, that all estates in the realm crouched unto her; so politique, that nothing was thought substantial debated without her advice. She was man like, and tall of stature, very liberal and bountiful.</blockquote>He describes her as a sure friend and a bitter enemy, and praises her for having been &#145;the only means at those days whereby her husband's country was reclaimed from sluttish and unclean Irish custom to English habits, bedding, house-keeping, and civility&#146;  (<span class="italic">Holinshed's Chronicles</span>, 6.280). Margaret and Piers had three sons, James (Piers's successor), Richard, and Thomas, and six daughters, Margaret, Catherine, Joan, Ellice, Eleanor, and Ellen. In her final years she is said to have lived in a manner &#145;most Godly, in contemplation and prayer, giving alms bountifully to poor and needy people&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 4792). The countess died in early August 1542, and was buried in St Canice's Cathedral, Kilkenny, along with her husband; their tomb is adorned by a mensa monument which portrays both as idealized in features.<br>
