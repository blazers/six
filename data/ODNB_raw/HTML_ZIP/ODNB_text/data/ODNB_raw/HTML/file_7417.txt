<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dee,  Francis</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1638), <span class="occ">bishop of Peterborough</span>, was born in London, the eldest son of David Dee and Marcia Roper, who had been licensed to marry on 8 February 1578. A native of Shropshire, David Dee had graduated from Oxford in 1568; he was vicar of Sherborne, Dorset, from 1580 and rector of St Bartholomew-the-Great, London, from 1587 until he was deprived in 1605. Francis was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London, from 1591 until 1596, when he won a Billingsley scholarship at St John's College, Cambridge, where a conformist style of divinity was developing. He graduated BA in 1600, was ordained a priest on 1 May 1602, proceeded MA in 1603, and became a fellow of St John's. Within a few years Dee married Susan le Poreque; they had two children, Adrian (<i>b</i>. 1 December 1606, <i>d</i>. 1638) and Mary. The dean (Thomas Neville) and chapter of Canterbury appointed him on 31 January 1607 rector of Holy Trinity-the-Less, Knightrider Street, London, which he resigned in 1620; and on 5 April 1615 of All Hallows, Lombard Street, which he resigned in 1634. He proceeded BD in 1610 and DD in 1617. In 1618 he rose to the chancellorship of Salisbury Cathedral, which he held until 1634, and about 1621&#150;2 he held the living of Sutton-at-Hone, Kent, through the patronage of the dean (Godfrey Goodman) and chapter of Rochester.<br>
<br>In 1629 Dee was chaplain to the English ambassador in Paris and passed to Bishop William Laud a petition from an Englishman imprisoned in the Bastille. In the following year his name appears as one of the founders of Sion College, and on 30 April he became dean of Chichester; he was more assiduous than his predecessors in disciplining the cathedral clergy, and two absentee vicars were forced to resign. Dee was nominated in September 1633 for an anticipated vacancy of the see of Gloucester, but when Bishop Goodman decided not to move he was elevated instead to Peterborough through the influence of Archbishop Laud, who (assisted by Bishop Juxon) carried out the consecration at Lambeth on 18 May 1634. As bishop Dee contributed to a series of Lenten lectures at court. On the death of his first wife he married Elizabeth Winter, who survived him; they did not have children.<br>
<br>By 1634 Dee had evolved into the Laudian prelate <i>par excellence</i>. His project was to replace the word-centred piety of the Jacobeans with one which emphasized the necessity of uniform worship and aesthetic, ceremonialized sacraments dominated by the altar. His primary visitation articles were the first episcopal set yet found (Samuel Clarke had done this for the archdeaconry of Derby in 1630) to stipulate the railing-in of communion tables at the east end of the chancel; this insistence even predated the archbishop's own visitation of 1635. Dee's visitation sermon was preached by the zealot Peter Hausted, curate to Laud's chaplain, and in the same year Dee co-operated with Laud's prosecution of Charles Chauncy's resistance to the altar policy. The regime at Peterborough provoked loud opposition and in 1636 the popular Kettering lecture was abolished. Aware of the need to placate moderate opinion, the bishop contacted the influential moderate puritan Edward, Lord Montagu, eschewing responsibility for this act and claiming to have been a regular preacher himself since 1603. However, his deputies continued to harass the crucial Northampton lecture.<br>
<br>Renewing the drive for conformity in 1637 Dee used the canonical church survey to enforce liturgical practice&#151;the creation of railed, east-end altars and the full Laudian communion in which the priest administered the communion from within the rails to the clergy and laity, who received theirs kneeling. A whole raft of other orders altered the arrangement of parish churches to accommodate the new altar-focused worship, enforced the use of silver communion vessels, promoted the notion of the material church as holy, and even sought to revive the pre-Reformation practice of confession. Dee's friend John Pocklington published apologetic works defending altars and the anti-sabbatarianism of the <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span> (enjoined by the bishop in 1633), but Dee still thought it necessary to mollify the moderates, so Edward Reynolds was employed to exhort conscientious waverers to sideline their objections and conform.<br>
<br>Owing primarily to government support and the unusual zeal of his deputies, Sibthorpe and Clarke, Dee achieved a degree of formal conformity and silenced the more vocal opposition, although his report to Laud in 1637 that only three lectures remained in the diocese was hopelessly optimistic. However, he did not live to witness the explosion of resentment which was the consequence of his policies. He died at his bishop's palace on 8 October 1638 and was buried on 12 October close to his throne in the cathedral. By his will he founded two fellowships at St John's and two scholarships for pupils from Merchant Taylors' or Peterborough schools; to the college chapel he bequeathed his library and a gilt communion service. Other beneficiaries included John Towers who, as his successor, was even more draconian.<br>
