<span class="headword">Anderson,  George</span>  (1826&#150;1902), <span class="occ">cricketer</span>, was born at Aiskew, near Bedale, Yorkshire, on 20 January 1826. He early showed aptitude as a high and long jumper and as a cricketer. His cricketing ability was first noticed when the All England eleven visited Bedale in 1848 under their captain, the eminent bowler William Clarke. After some years employed as a clerk, Anderson became a professional in 1850. Thereafter, he played regularly for Yorkshire (1850&#150;69), for the Players against the Gentlemen (1855&#150;64), and for the All England eleven in their annual matches against the United All England eleven (1854&#150;64). He visited Australia with George Parr's team (1863&#150;4) but achieved little and often suffered from the effects of seasickness. In three of the nineteen matches he captained an eleven against one led by Parr, the twelve tourists being augmented by locals. On his return he had, in 1864, his best season, achieving his highest score, of 99 not out, for Yorkshire against Nottinghamshire.<br>
<br>The county club had been formally constituted in 1863. Anderson, who had been captain in the earlier years, no longer held office and, indeed, dropped out of the side on several occasions because of a dispute with Surrey over the nature of bowling actions. However, a law allowing the arm to be raised above the shoulder was introduced in 1864. His benefit match in 1869 at Dewsbury was marred by bad weather.<br>
<br>Anderson was a kindly, handsome man of fine physique; he was 6 feet tall, weighed over 14 stone, and was very strong. As a batsman he was described as &#145;the model of manliness&#146;; he had a good defence, and though he took time to get set, he was in his day one of the hardest and cleanest hitters of good bowling. In 1862 he hit a drive for eight runs at the Oval when playing for the North of England against Surrey. On retiring from professional cricket, Anderson became actuary of the Bedale Savings Bank (1873), and held the office until the bank's failure in 1894. He was described as a property agent at the time of his death from bronchitis at Aiskew, on 27 November 1902. He left at least one son.<br>
