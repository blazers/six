<span class="headword">Watson,  Thomas</span>  (1750&#150;1781), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born in London, the son of Thomas Watson (<i>d</i>. 1791), printseller, and his wife, Esther. Nothing is known of his training but he rapidly matured as a fine engraver in mezzotint and in stipple. He exhibited with the Society of Artists between 1773 and 1776, showing a series of fine mezzotints. Most of his early prints were published by himself (or more probably by his father) from Broad Street, London, in alliance with the book and printsellers Samuel Hooper and Walter Shropshire. He took Francis Haward apprentice in 1774 for a &pound;75 premium. He engraved portraits and fancy subjects with equal dexterity and interpreted a number of artists, notably Sir Joshua Reynolds and Daniel Gardner. In January 1779 Watson and Shropshire published a fine set of six &#145;Windsor Beauties&#146;, portraits of ladies of the court of Charles II after paintings by Sir Peter Lely now at Hampton Court. About that time Watson went into partnership with William Dickinson, a fellow engraver in stipple and mezzotint and another favourite engraver of Reynolds. Thomas Watson senior and Dickinson insured the contents of a brick dwelling at 158 New Bond Street on 2 February 1779, with over &pound;2000 cover allowed for the joint stock of prints. From then until 1781 Watson junior engraved or supervised the making of some twenty-eight plates that went under his own name and contributed to the establishment of a thriving business. Early in the summer of 1781 Thomas Watson junior died suddenly at Westminster, and he was buried probably at St George's, Hanover Square. The insurance policies show that his father moved from Bond Street to Carnaby Street in 1781 and the next year to 33 Strand. He continued to sell his son's prints and, apparently, to support Dickinson, who managed the Bond Street business until the elder Watson's death in 1791. A sale of &#145;Mr Watson's plates and prints&#146; took place in January 1792.<br>
