<span class="headword">Jones,  Hugh</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1782), <span class="occ">ballad writer</span>, was for most of his life associated with Llangwm in Denbighshire (and known as Huw Jones o Llangwm), but little or nothing is known about his origins. He married, but the name of his wife is unknown. References in his works suggest he had at least a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Jones's literary output is known to have included five interludes, and four of these, commissioned by unknown groups of players and composed between 1760 and 1770, have survived. One, <span class="italic">Y Brenin Dafydd</span>, was written jointly with Si&ocirc;n Cadwaladr. The lost interlude was based on the story of Myfanwy of Castell Dinas Br&acirc;n. However, there is no evidence that Hugh Jones himself, unlike his contemporary Twm o'r Nant, acted in interludes. He would have received payment for his works, and he also profited by independently printing and selling his interludes throughout north Wales. He was imprisoned on two occasions, once, it seems, for non-payment of a printing debt. <span class="italic">Protestant a neilltuwr</span>, composed about 1769&#150;70, appeared in 1783, following the author's death. Several references are made in his interludes to the custom of learning English and to the sending of children to schools across the border to acquire that language.<br>
<br>Although described as &#145;a comon ballad singer&#146;, Hugh Jones was one of the most prolific ballad writers in eighteenth-century Wales, and 100 or so of his ballads survive. These are based on traditional themes, and were composed mainly between 1749 and 1780. His ballads on drunkenness, for example, testify to the inventiveness of the ballad singers and their ability to rework the same themes. One presents a debate between a drunkard and his conscience, while another records the conversation between an impoverished drunkard and an innkeeper's wife. A conversation between a drunkard and his caring wife forms the basis of a third, and in another a cuckoo reprimands the drunkard as he leaves the tavern, early one Sunday morning, and advises him to change his ways.<br>
<br>Hugh Jones published in 1759 an anthology of ballads, composed by himself and his peers, entitled <span class="italic">Dewisol ganiadau yr oes hon</span>. The first part, however, was dedicated to the works of Goronwy Owen, Ieuan Fardd (Evan Evans), William Wynn, and others, the neo-classicists of the eighteenth century whose compositions were patterned on the works of the <i>cywyddwyr</i> of the later middle ages. In justifying the dual constitution of his volume, Hugh Jones expressed his hope that the light entertainment of the second part would lead young, uneducated (in the poetical sense) readers in the direction of the real substance found in the first.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Dewisol ganiadau</span> was followed in 1763 by <span class="italic">Diddanwch teuluaidd</span>. The well-known writer and antiquary Lewis Morris claimed in his preface that the volume was published by Hugh Jones &#145;for his own benefit&#146;, and there is no doubt that the project was his own. Inspired by the success of <span class="italic">Dewisol ganiadau</span>, he approached Lewis Morris with a request for a collection of his poems for inclusion in his anthology, and it was Jones who saw to the printing of the proposals and the poems, and to the distribution of the material once published. And profit he did; the London printer, William Roberts, was never paid for his work.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Diddanwch teuluaidd</span> was nevertheless very much a Cymmrodorion Society publication. The poets whose works were published were society members who actively sought subscribers, and Richard Morris, brother of Lewis, corrected the proofs. Since 1758 the society had contemplated publishing Goronwy Owen's work, but no progress had been made, and Lewis Morris's <span class="italic">Tlysau yr hen oesoedd</span> (1735) had long been abandoned. Although distrustful of Hugh Jones, the Cymmrodorion had no option but to co-operate with him, and the works of Goronwy Owen, Lewis Morris, and others were made available, thanks to the efforts of this humble farm labourer from Llangwm.<br>
<br>Jones died in December 1782, and was buried at Efenechdid, Denbighshire, on 29 December. According to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of Welsh Biography</span> &#145;his literary labours did a great deal to kindle and keep burning the interest of the country people in the Welsh language&#146;  (<span class="italic">DWB</span>).<br>
