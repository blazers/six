<span class="headword">Williams,  Roger</span>  (<em>c.</em>1606&#150;1683), <span class="occ">religious controversialist and founder of Providence, Rhode Island</span>, was born in London, but no record of the exact date survives. He was the third of four children of James Williams (<i>d</i>. 1621), merchant tailor, and Alice Pemberton (<i>d</i>. 1625), and grew up in St Sepulchre parish.<h2>
<a name="EarlyyearsandEnglishministry"></a>Early years and English ministry</h2>Little is known of Williams's youth, but he learned to read and write, and to take shorthand, which brought him to the attention of Sir Edward Coke. Coke employed the teenage Williams to take notes of sermons and also of speeches in Star Chamber. Williams was granted a scholarship in 1621 to study at Charterhouse School in London, probably through the intercession of Coke, who was one of the school's governors. His admiration for the great jurist was strong, and he remembered fondly their relationship in letters he wrote to Coke's daughter in the 1650s. Through his connection with Coke the young Williams became familiar with the major controversies and figures of the age, and honed his skills in logic and rhetoric. In 1623 he was admitted to Pembroke College, Cambridge, though he did not matriculate in the university until a year later.<br>
<br>Williams graduated BA in January 1627 and remained in Cambridge for another year and a half. He had, according to his later recollections, experienced God's loving touch while in his teens, an experience that set him on a course of seeking godliness, which initially drew him to the puritan critics of the English church. In winter 1628&#150;9, perhaps on the recommendation of Coke, he entered the Essex household of Sir William Masham as family chaplain. Moving in the circles of the Essex puritan gentry he also offered spiritual guidance to Joan, Lady Barrington, Masham's mother-in-law. Williams wooed Jane Whalley, a niece of Lady Barrington, who had taken charge of Whalley's care and tuition after the death of Jane's mother. His attentions were blocked by Lady Barrington, leading to an exchange of harsh letters. Following the rebuff he married, on 15 December 1629, Mary Bernard (<i>bap</i>. 1609, <i>d</i>. in or after 1676), the daughter of the clergyman and religious writer Richard Bernard, who was serving as a maid in the Masham household.<br>
<br>In July 1629 Williams had met Thomas Hooker in Chelmsford and the two had journeyed to Boston, where they were joined by John Cotton. The three clergymen proceeded to the Sempringham estate of the earl of Lincoln where gathered clergy and gentry discussed plans for investing in the Massachusetts Bay Company and moving the corporation's government to the New World. At the Sempringham meeting Williams would also have met John Winthrop, who became the colony's governor. According to his later account, Williams, <i>en route</i> for Sempringham, argued with his two fellow clergymen over the use of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, asserting that to use those forms was against God's will. Rejection of some prayer book forms had long been advocated and practised by godly clergy, and was relatively easy for ministers, such as Williams, who did not hold parochial livings. But bishops such as London's William Laud had begun to curb the practice, and the options of migration to the Netherlands or New England were being seriously considered by many.<h2>
<a name="NewEnglanddissenter"></a>New England dissenter</h2>In February 1631 Williams and his wife arrived in Massachusetts, the event being noticed by John Winthrop, who referred to him as &#145;a godly minister&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of John Winthrop</span>, 44). His reputation for godliness had been established in puritan circles. His extreme views on religious government were less well known. Invited to join the Boston church he declined &#145;because they would not make a public declaration of their repentance for having communion with the Churches of New England &hellip; and besides had declared his opinion that the magistrate might not punish the breach of the Sabbath&#146; nor any other breach of the first table of the ten commandments  (<span class="italic">Journal of John Winthrop</span>, 50). Because of these opinions the Massachusetts magistrates warned the church of Salem not to call Williams to the office of teacher, one of the two ministerial posts in New England churches. Finding his separatist views unacceptable in the Bay colony, Williams moved south to the Plymouth Plantation.<br>
<br>In Plymouth Williams was admitted to the separatist congregation and preached there until, according to William Bradford in summer 1632, he &#145;began to fall into some strange opinions, and from opinion to practice, which caused some controversy between the church and him&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of Plymouth Plantation</span>, 257). It was in Plymouth that Mary gave birth to the first of their six children. And it was there that Williams first developed his interest in the native Americans, forming friendships with tribal leaders that later stood him in good stead. The disagreement which Bradford alluded to was probably over Williams's belief that native land rights had not been taken seriously enough by the English colonists. As the controversy grew Williams requested a dismissal from the separatist congregation and returned to Salem. Despite holding views that the majority of his fellow colonists considered extreme, he was embraced for his brilliance, kindness, and, above all, his godliness.<br>
<br>In Salem Williams preached &#145;by way of prophesy&#146;&#151;the Massachusetts churches at that time still allowing lay preaching&#151;and informally assisted the pastor, the Revd Samuel Skelton. Once again he stirred controversy. He entered a debate over whether women should wear veils in church, asserting that they should adopt that comely practice in all public assemblies. He shared with the colony's magistrates a treatise in which he challenged the validity of the colonial charter, rejecting the notion that the king of England had the right to bestow Indian land on his own subjects, and adding an attack on the common practice of labelling Europe as Christendom, or Christ's kingdom. His opposition to magisterial enforcement of the first table led him to challenge the government's administration of oaths. His views may have precipitated John Endecott's act of iconoclasm in cutting the cross from the ensign of the Salem trained band.<br>
<br>The clerical and lay leaders of the colony made several attempts to persuade Williams of the error of his ways, or at least to cease proselytizing his controversial views. Disturbed by reports that the Salem congregation was about to choose Williams for one of the church offices, the colony magistrates applied pressure on the community to dissuade them from that course. Williams responded by calling on the Salem church to separate itself from the rest of the colony's congregations. Despairing of bringing Williams into line, in October 1635 the general court of the colony sentenced him to be sent back to England, deferring execution of the sentence because Williams was ill. Learning that he continued to spread his errors the magistrates voted in January 1636 to send a sheriff to execute the sentence. Warned of his impending arrest by John Winthrop, Williams fled south through winter snows, taking refuge with a tribe of native Americans. Despite Williams's banishment the magistrate and the dissenter continued to correspond, and Winthrop invested in a cattle raising venture that Williams launched.<br>
<br>Joined by his family and some friends from Salem, in spring 1636 Williams built homes at the headwaters of Narragansett Bay on land he purchased from the Narragansett sachems Cononicus and Miantonomo. He then transferred this land to the new community that he named Providence. Williams had always shown sympathy to the native population, and his strong ties with native leaders were useful to Providence, and made him a valued intermediary between the natives and the English colonies. During the following decade he studied the language and customs of the local tribes, leading eventually to his <span class="italic">A Key into the Language of America</span> (1643). The close ties with the Narragansetts that he had started to form when he lived in Plymouth enabled him to play a key role in persuading the Narragansetts to ally themselves with the English colonies in the Pequot War that broke out in 1636.<br>
<br>The residents of Providence committed themselves to a policy of toleration and the community became a haven for other dissenters who left Massachusetts. In his search for true Christianity Williams himself briefly embraced Baptist teachings in 1639 and helped found the first Baptist church in the colonies. But he came to believe that all churches invariably contained an unacceptable mixture of God's true saints and unregenerate men and women. He left the Baptist congregation a mere four months after he joined it, and prayed only with his wife for the remainder of his life. In addition to dissenters who settled in Providence others who rejected the orthodoxy of Massachusetts established communities in the neighbouring region. Most notable was the settlement of Aquidneck Island by Anne Hutchinson and some of her supporters. Another contentious dissenter was Samuel Gorton, who eventually founded Warwick. Concerned with the growth of these hives of dissenters, and jealous of the control the heretics held over some of the region's richest land, the neighbouring colonies of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Haven began to assert their own claims to the region. Faced with this threat Williams was persuaded to journey to England in an effort to seek protection from the puritan-controlled Long Parliament. Sailing from Dutch New Amsterdam because he was still forbidden to enter Massachusetts, he travelled to England in March 1643. Using contacts with some of the grandees he had known before his emigration&#151;most notably Sir William Masham, Sir Thomas Barrington, and the earl of Warwick&#151;he was able to secure a patent in March 1644 that united Providence with her sister settlements as the colony of Providence Plantations, later known as Rhode Island.<h2>
<a name="EnglishIndependent"></a>English Independent</h2>At the time when Williams returned to England the puritan cause was divided over how the national church should be reconstructed. Congregationalist friends of orthodox New Englanders, fearing the imposition of a presbyterian settlement and seeking toleration for their own practices, joined forces with sectarian groups to lobby for ecclesiastical independence. The New England experiment was energetically picked over by English religious figures seeking evidence to bolster their own arguments. Williams identified with the Independents, but used his New England experience to warn against trusting congregationalists. He befriended John Milton, who introduced him to his publisher. Williams's <span class="italic">The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution</span> (1644) recounted his suffering at the hands of the Massachusetts authorities and set forth an argument for toleration of every individual's views. His publication of <span class="italic">Mr. Cottons Letter Lately Printed, Examined and Answered</span> (1644) triggered an extended debate with John Cotton over these issues. Williams argued that government derived from the people and that magistrates had no authority from God to impose religious forms or punish citizens for failing to abide by them. It was the task of churches themselves to strive to recover the character of the primitive Christian community. According to him the early church of the apostles was characterized by the poverty of its members in worldly things, its shunning of false gods, its effort to approximate the teachings of Christ as closely as possible, and by its patiently bearing the persecution of ungodly men rather than trying to persecute others. Christ, he argued, did not come to destroy lives for the sake of religion, but to save them. The effort of governments to impose one particular way of worship was a bloody tenet because it led to the mutilation and execution of men and women seeking in their own way to worship God.<br>
<br>Cotton responded to these two works in <span class="italic">A Reply to Mr. Williams</span> (1647) and <span class="italic">The Bloudy Tenent, Washed and Made White in the Bloud of the Lambe</span> (1647). In essence he sought to argue that governments had the obligation to support the godly and to curb religious views that threatened the unity and safety of the Commonwealth. Williams had the last word in <span class="italic">The Bloudy Tenent yet More Bloody</span> (1652). This was published during a second stay in England, from 1651 to 1654, when Williams continued to use his New England experience as a basis for entering the lists in favour of toleration in England, in the process befriending Oliver Cromwell, among others. He reported many discourses with Cromwell in which the two men discussed native American affairs and the possible approach of the millennium. Having been forced to conclude that men could not on their own find the proper forms of worship before Christ came again, Williams had come to look more eagerly for the approach of the millennium, which he hoped for fervently in these tumultuous times. He also renewed his friendship with John Milton, with whom he discussed the dangers of intolerance and of a hireling ministry.<h2>
<a name="Statesman"></a>Statesman</h2>When he returned to Providence with the parliamentary patent in September 1644 Williams immersed himself in healing the divisions between the various settlements and helping to organize the new colony's government. He served from 1644 to 1647 as the chief officer, and then was chosen deputy president of the colony. It took until 1647 before the other towns in the jurisdiction came to co-operate as the patent had envisioned. But despite his best efforts Williams failed to get everyone to accept the value of the confederation that he saw as essential to their common survival. He faced a particular challenge from William Coddington, who had settled at Portsmouth, on Aquidneck Island, as part of the faction that had supported Anne Hutchinson. Coddington quarrelled with the Hutchinsons and established himself as a key figure in his own right. A merchant with strong English connections he was able to obtain a parliamentary commission making him governor of the colony for life in clear violation of the patent which Williams had obtained. It was this that had led to Williams's return to England, accompanied by John Clarke, in 1651. Though he was able to gain the nullification of Coddington's commission he failed to gain a reaffirmation of the patent that he had earlier obtained.<br>
<br>After returning to New England in summer 1654 Williams was elected president of Providence Plantations in September. Once again his major task was to quell the factionalism that was largely rooted in the colony being open to settlers of many divergent religious views and socio-economic goals. Even in Providence itself divisions arose at this time over the authority of the civil leaders to impose compulsory militia training. This particular dispute seems to have prompted Williams's most famous statement of his views on the limits of freedom and the nature of the wall of separation that should divide state and church&#151;the &#145;ship of state&#146; letter he addressed to his fellow citizens around January 1655. The letter opened with Williams denying that anything he had ever said or written could be properly construed to mean that government had no right whatsoever to punish those who transgressed against the common interests of the society. He likened society to &#145;a hundred souls in one ship, whose weal and woe is common&#146;. If &#145;Papists and Protestants, Jews, and Turks, may be embarked into one ship&#146;, all he argued in terms of liberty was that none of these groups &#145;be forced to come to the ship's prayers or worship; nor compelled from their own particular prayers or worship, if they practice any&#146;. Yet, &#145;notwithstanding this liberty, the commander of this ship ought to command the ship's course &hellip; and also to command that justice, peace, and sobriety, be kept and practiced, both among the seamen and all the passengers&#146;, and &#145;if any refuse to obey the common laws and orders of the ship, concerning their common peace and preservation&#146;, or &#145;mutiny and rise up against their commanders&#146;, or &#145;preach or write that there ought to be no commanders because all are equal in Christ&#146;, the commanders &#145;may judge, resist, compel, and punish such transgressors&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 423&#150;4).<br>
<br>The letter did not bring dissension to a halt. In the remaining years of the decade quarrels over land began to grow in intensity and Williams himself became embroiled in a bitter dispute with a Providence group headed by William Harris which asserted that the boundaries of the community were larger than Williams contended that he had acquired from the native leaders. In 1657 Williams retired from the presidency and devoted himself more to his own private interests, spending considerable time away from the settlements at a trading post which he had established along the Narragansett Bay. During this period he corresponded extensively with friends throughout the region, including John Winthrop jun., the son of the former Massachusetts governor, who was himself governor of Connecticut.<br>
<br>Williams was gratified by the success of his friend and ally John Clarke in England. Clarke secured a letter from Cromwell in 1655 that urged the citizens of Providence and her sister towns to take up the challenge of governing themselves in accord with the 1644 patent. Following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 Clarke obtained a charter for the colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations from King Charles II in 1663, and the explicit guarantee that the charter provided for religious liberty. The colony's future was further bolstered when a royal commission sent to the region in 1664 recognized Rhode Island's rights to land that had been in dispute with neighbouring colonies. While continuing to focus on his personal affairs Williams served as a colony assistant in 1664, 1665, 1670, 1671, and 1672, as well as holding lesser offices for the colony and the town of Providence.<h2>
<a name="Laststruggles"></a>Last struggles</h2>In the 1670s Williams emerged from relative obscurity to attack the growing ascendancy of the Quakers in Rhode Island. Many of the original supporters of Anne Hutchinson, such as Mary Dyer, had been convinced by Quaker missionaries in the mid-1650s and the influence of the sect had steadily spread. Despite his views on toleration Williams held an intense belief in the importance of the scriptures. Indeed, his own spiritual pilgrimage had been driven by his careful reading of the <span class="roman">Old and New Testaments</span> and his refusal to compromise what he interpreted as God's will. He believed that the Quakers had elevated their sense of an inner light above the written word of God, and was further disturbed by the religious and moral conclusions they drew from this inspiration. Furthermore he was disturbed when some Quakers used their perception of the inner light to justify disobedience to civil laws. While not seeking to proscribe their presence or influence he castigated Quaker leaders and their beliefs in public debates held at Newport and Providence in 1672, recounting his experience and views in <span class="italic">George Foxe Digged out of his Burrowes</span> (1676).<br>
<br>In 1675 King Philip's War broke out between the native Americans of southern New England and the English colonies. The conflict originated with the Wampanoag tribe and their leader, Metacom, named King Philip by the English. The land hunger of Rhode Islanders such as William Harris had undermined Williams's efforts to retain good relations with the Narragansett tribe that had welcomed him in the 1630s and sold him land. In June 1675 the Narragansetts joined the Wampanoags and other tribes in attacking the settlements. In March 1676 Providence was attacked and burnt even while Williams was negotiating with some native American leaders nearby. As the devastating war progressed Williams joined a militia company to defend the settlements, and after the conclusion of fighting in the area assisted in rounding up native Americans for sale into slavery in the West Indies.<br>
<br>In the years after King Philip's War Williams became increasingly nostalgic, remembering his youth in England, the promise of early Rhode Island, and his efforts to understand and live in peace with the native population. Distressed by recent events he wrote to his friend John Winthrop jun. asking &#145;why is our Candle yet burning but to &hellip; [serve] God in serving the public in our generation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 699). He continued to urge his fractious fellow Rhode Islanders to heal the breaches that divided them, reminding them that &#145;there is not a man in the world (except robbers, pirates, rebels) but doth submit to government&#146;  (ibid., 774). He never gave up his grudge against Massachusetts for the way that colony had treated him. In Rhode Island he was increasingly dismissed as irrelevant by fellow colonists who took for granted what he had accomplished and did not share his zealous pursuit of truth and godliness. The exact date of his death was not recorded, though it was between 27 January and 15 March 1683. He was buried with full military honours on his Providence farm.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>Roger Williams was a seeker who was driven by a sense of God's love to find the proper way to worship and praise his Lord. He refused to compromise with the orders of the English church, the magistrates and ministers of Massachusetts, or any other group. He was unwilling to accept the imperfections of any religious group, including the Baptist church which he helped found in Rhode Island. His insistent refusal to sully worship by mingling believers and unbelievers in any religious act led him to radical views denying the commonly accepted right of the state to police the first table of the commandments, and eventually to conclude that until Christ's second coming no church could achieve the perfection demanded by God. He sought to erect a wall of separation to protect religious seekers from the contamination of civil rulers, and was the chief architect of the most tolerant English society in his time. Because he grudgingly came to accept that no sect or church could escape impurity he learned to tolerate all faiths so long as their beliefs did not interfere with the efforts of the captain to steer the ship of state in its secular courses.<br>
<br>In time Williams became an icon for the cause of religious freedom, and historians and statesmen applauded him as a pioneer of American democratic traditions. Yet this distorts the nature of his life. Roger Williams was first and foremost a pious Christian who sought the best way to ensure the proper service of God. In seeking separation of church and state he was primarily concerned with defending religious seekers from civil authorities rather than, as later generations would fear, limiting the role of believers on the state. His commitment came from a concern for religion, not from indifference or a fear that its influence might become too great.<br>
