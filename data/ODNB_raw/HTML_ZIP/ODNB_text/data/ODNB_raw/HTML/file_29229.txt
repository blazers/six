<span class="headword">Whitaker,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1672), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born at Oakham, Rutland, the son of the schoolmaster <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29221/', "Jeremiah Whitaker (1599&#150;1654)")</script> and Chephtzibah, daughter of the vicar of Oakham, William Peachy. At Easter 1639 he matriculated as a sizar of Emmanuel College, Cambridge; he graduated BA in 1643. Having become a fellow of Queens' College in 1644, he proceeded MA in 1646. Like his father, Whitaker earned a reputation for his skill as a classical and oriental linguist. According to Samuel Annesley, Richard Holdsworth, master of the college, gave him the keys of the college library and set him the task of translating Eustathius upon Homer, which he performed very creditably. Having resigned his fellowship in 1647, on 2 October 1648 he was appointed by the visitors of the university as vicar of the parish of Hornchurch, Essex, an appropriated rectory of New College, Oxford. It seems that at about this time Whitaker married, for on 1 April 1652 the visitors appointed him a chaplain of New College, but found it necessary to dispense with the regulations against both marriage and non-residence; nothing is known of his wife. Following the death on 1 June 1654 of their rector, Jeremiah Whitaker, the parishioners of St Mary Magdalen, Bermondsey, unanimously elected his son to replace him. On 4 July they petitioned Cromwell to this end, and William Whitaker was admitted on 20 November 1654. He was himself succeeded at Hornchurch the following year by John Johnson.<br>
<br>Following the Restoration, Whitaker was ejected from Bermondsey, where his successor was instituted on 7 November 1662. He then gathered a congregation at Long Walk, Bermondsey, and the authorities were informed that he was preaching there in 1670. Whitaker also preached at the London house of Elizabeth Cecil, dowager countess of Exeter, and was friendly with her chaplain, Thomas Jacombe. For many years his house was full of candidates in divinity, and he had many foreign divines under his care. He was licensed to preach as a presbyterian at Court Yard, Bermondsey, on 2 April 1672, but died later that year. His funeral sermon was preached by Samuel Annesley, who published two of Whitaker's sermons in later editions of his <span class="italic">Morning Exercises</span>. In 1674 Whitaker's widow published his <span class="italic">Eighteen Sermons Preached on Several Texts of Scripture</span>. The preface, dedicated to Elizabeth Cecil, thanked her for kindnesses both to William Whitaker and to his father; Jacombe contributed a tribute to his colleague.<br>
