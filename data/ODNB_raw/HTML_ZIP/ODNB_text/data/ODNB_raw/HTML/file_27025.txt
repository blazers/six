<span class="headword">Taylor,  Edward</span>  (1784&#150;1863), <span class="occ">lecturer and writer on music</span>, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27055/', "John Taylor (1750&#150;1826)")</script>, a hymn writer and nonconformist minister, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27082/', "Susanna Taylor (1755&#150;1823)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27055/', "Taylor, John (1750&#150;1826)")</script>], a literary hostess, was born in Norwich on 22 January 1784. He came from an old Unitarian family, and his great-grandfather was the dissenting divine and Hebrew scholar John Taylor (1694&#150;1761) of Norwich. His brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27059/', "John Taylor (1779&#150;1863)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27074/', "Richard Taylor")</script>, and Arthur Taylor (<i>b</i>. 1790). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/916/', "Sarah Austin")</script> was his sister.<br>
<br>From 1808 to 1815 Taylor was in business at the corner of Rampant Horse Street, Norwich, and in 1819 he was sheriff of Norwich. His early musical education was somewhat irregular. He took lessons from John Christmas Beckwith, organist of Norwich Cathedral, and on the flute and oboe from William Fish, a well-known local musician. For the first triennial Norwich music festival of 1824 he trained the chorus, fixed the band and singers, and arranged the entire programme. He achieved some success as a singer, thanks to a fine rich bass voice and commanding presence. In 1825 he moved to London and joined his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27071/', "Philip Taylor")</script> and a cousin, John Martineau, as civil engineers at York Place, City Road. Lack of success in the business led Taylor to enter the music profession in 1827, at the age of forty-three, as a professional singer, teacher, and music journalist. That year he sang at the Norwich festival, and he conducted there in 1839 and 1842. For the festival of 1830 he translated Spohr's <span class="italic">Die letzen Dinge</span> as <span class="italic">The Last Judgement</span>, which was then performed for the first time in England. He was a great personal friend of Spohr, who was his guest at 3 Regent Square, King's Cross, in 1839 and 1847. He also visited Spohr at Kassel in 1840. In addition to <span class="italic">The Last Judgement</span>, he translated Spohr's <span class="italic">The Crucifixion, or, Calvary</span> (1836), <span class="italic">The Fall of Babylon</span> (1842), and <span class="italic">The Christian's Prayer</span> (<i>c</i>.1860), all of which were produced at Norwich festivals. His friendship with Spohr seems to have aroused animosity among other journalists, and Taylor was viewed by some as an enemy of young English composers.<br>
<br>On 24 October 1837, following the death of Richard John Samuel Stevens, Taylor was appointed professor of music at Gresham College, in the City, a post which he held until his death. In January 1838 he gave his first three lectures, which were published in the same year. He gave frequent lectures with great success in different parts of the country, and one on &#145;Madrigals&#146; which he delivered at Bristol in 1837 resulted in the formation of the Bristol Madrigal Society. His lectures did much to raise the profile of music among the general public, and he prepared the way for the sight-singing movement of the 1840s. He was the founder of the Purcell Club and Vocal Society, and from 1829 to 1843 he was music critic of <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>. In addition to the translations already mentioned, his works included a few songs, words for songs, and adaptations. He translated Friedrich Schneider's <span class="italic">The Deluge</span>, Mozart's <span class="roman">Requiem</span> under the title <span class="italic">Redemption</span> (1845), and Haydn's <span class="italic">The Seasons</span>. <span class="italic">The Vocal School of Italy in the Sixteenth Century</span> (1839, reissued in 1868) consisted of a selection of madrigals and anthems by Italian masters, adapted to English words. &#145;The cathedral service, its glory, its decline, and its designed extinction&#146; appeared anonymously (in two articles) in the <span class="italic">British and Foreign Review</span> for 1844, and was republished (again anonymously) in 1845. In 1843 Taylor edited Purcell's <span class="italic">King Arthur</span> for the Musical Antiquarian Society (which he founded with William Chappell and Edward Rimbault) and, in conjunction with James Turle, he edited <span class="italic">The People's Music Book</span> (1844) and <span class="italic">The Singing-Book</span> (1846). Some manuscripts by him were placed in the library of the Royal College of Music, including several lectures on music &#145;written and delivered by Edward Taylor at Gresham College and elsewhere&#146;, <span class="italic">Musical Illustrations to Several Courses of Lectures</span> (24 vols. and separate parts), mostly in Taylor's autograph, and his <span class="italic">Ode for the Opening of Gresham College</span> (2 November 1843), in score.<br>
<br>Taylor died at his house, Gresham Cottage, Cornlands Road, Brentwood, Essex, on 12 March 1863, and was buried in the old dissenting burial-ground, King's Road, Brentwood. He left a son, John Edward Taylor, a printer of Weybridge, Surrey, whose output appears to have included some of his father's works.<br>
