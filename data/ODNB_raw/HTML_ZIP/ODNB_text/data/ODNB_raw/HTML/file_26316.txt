<span class="headword">Starkey, Sir  Humphrey</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1486), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was the son of Richard Starkey and his wife, Margaret, of Northwich, Cheshire, and also had connections with Essex. He was living in London in 1445, and had perhaps entered the Inner Temple by 1451, although he is first mentioned as a lawyer in the year-books only in Hilary term 1454. In 1471 he was elected recorder of London, in succession to his friend Sir Thomas Urswyck, and in Trinity term 1478 became a serjeant. He resigned the recordership on being appointed chief baron of the exchequer during the short reign of Edward V, on 15 June 1483. On the accession of Richard III he was knighted, and was continued in his office. He also acted as a justice of the common pleas during the reign of Richard III and was continued in both his offices by Henry VII. The last fine levied before him was at midsummer 1486.<br>
<br>Starkey married Isabel (possibly <i>n&eacute;e</i> Walden). He died on 21 or 27 August 1486 and was buried at St Leonard, Shoreditch, where a lost monument commemorated him and his wife, with their three sons and eight daughters. By the time of Starkey's death only one son, Richard, and four daughters (Emma, Anne, Katherine, and Elizabeth) survived. He left money for Richard to be educated at Clifford's Inn and then to go to the Temple or one of the other inns of court. Richard may instead have attended Pembroke College, Cambridge, to which he bequeathed his <span class="roman">Bible</span> in 1492; he was unmarried at his death and his heirs were his sisters and their children. Starkey's widow later married William Denton, esquire, of Babraham, Cambridgeshire, where she willed burial at her death in 1496. As well as land in Shoreditch and London, Starkey held the manors of Germains in Kelvedon and Slades in Navestock, Essex, and the manors of Hever and Little Woldham in Kent. The latter, where he built a house, was later known as Starkeys.<br>
