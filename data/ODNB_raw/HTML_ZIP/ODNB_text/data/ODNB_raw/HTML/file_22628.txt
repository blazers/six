<span class="headword">Potts,  Laurence Holker</span>  (1789&#150;1850), <span class="occ">surgeon and inventor of a process for sinking foundations</span>, the son of Cuthbert Potts, surgeon, and Ethelinda Margaret Thorpe, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27380/', "John Thorpe (1715/16&#150;1792)")</script>, was born in Pall Mall, London, on 18 April 1789. He was educated at Westminster School and at a school in Northamptonshire before being apprenticed in 1805 to Mr Birch, surgeon, of Warwick. In 1810 he became a house pupil of Sir Benjamin Brodie at St George's Hospital, London; William Frederick Chambers and Charles Locock were house pupils at the same time. Potts was admitted to the Royal College of Surgeons in 1812, and he graduated MD at King's College, Aberdeen, in 1825.<br>
<br>In 1812 Potts was appointed surgeon to the Royal Devon and Cornwall Miners' militia, then quartered in Ireland. The regiment returned to Truro in 1814 and was subsequently disbanded, and Potts started in practice in the town. He had always taken a great interest in scientific pursuits, and in 1818 he took an active part in founding the Royal Institution of Cornwall. He gave several courses of lectures there and made a habit of gratuitously analysing minerals for the miners.<br>
<br>In 1820 Potts married Anne Wright, of Lambessow, Cornwall; they had four daughters and two sons who survived him. In 1828 he became superintendent and physician of the Cornwall County Lunatic Asylum at Bodmin. He resigned in 1837, and moved in the following year to Vanbrugh Castle, Blackheath, near London, where he established an institution for the treatment of spinal diseases. Here he established a workshop for the manufacture of various appliances and apparatus, of which he devised many new forms. He had at the same time a London town house, 9 Buckingham Street, Strand, to which a workshop was attached. His increasing interest in his inventions diverted his attention from his patients, and Vanbrugh Castle was eventually given up.<br>
<br>Potts's minor inventions included his patent no. 9642 of 1843 for a suspended railway, velocipede, and manual paddle boat. But the invention for which his name is generally remembered is a method of sinking foundations under water, for which he obtained a patent in 1843 (no. 9975). This involved the sinking of hollow piles of iron, open at the lower end and closed at the top by a cap. A partial vacuum being then formed within the tube by means of a pump, the coastal or river-bed materials such as shingle and sand were caused to flow up through the pile by the pressure of the atmosphere, the rush of water from below breaking up the soil and undermining the lower edges of the pile. The pile descended by its own gravity, assisted by atmospheric pressure on its closed end, and, when filled, its contents were discharged by a pump. As the tube descended the cap was removed and a fresh length attached. The tubes could be of large size, forming an alternative to cofferdams in constructing foundations. Potts claimed to have first considered the idea while in Cornwall, and may have developed it from observing the sinking of wrought iron tubes for mine shafts through sand off the coast of Cornwall, a practice which was introduced about 1801.<br>
<br>Potts's invention was well received, and at first it promised to be a great success. Potts gave evidence on 10 June 1844 before the commission on harbours of refuge, and James Walker, president of the Institution of Civil Engineers and a member of the commission, was impressed by the ingenuity of the idea, though he remained uncertain about its practical application. The matter was taken up by Trinity House, to which Walker was consultant, and on 16 July 1845 an experimental tube 2 feet 6 inches in diameter was driven into the Goodwin Sands, to a depth of 22 feet, in two or three hours. A cluster of such piles was used to form the foundation of a beacon, which was completed on 26 August 1847. Several small beacons were erected on sands lying near the mouth of the River Thames in 1845&#150;6. Sir John Burgoyne also took an interest in the invention, and a trial cylinder 4 feet in diameter was sunk at the Goodwin Sands as a possible foundation for a fortification.<br>
<br>Although Potts may originally have had maritime applications in mind, others saw alternative uses for his idea. In 1845 Potts became acquainted with Charles Fox of the firm of Fox and Henderson. The firm invested heavily in developing the device and attempted to use it wherever there was an opportunity. Undoubtedly the hope was that it would provide a cheaper alternative to the expensive temporary construction of cofferdams generally used for bridge foundations. The first large work upon which it was employed was the viaduct carrying the Chester and Holyhead Railway across Malltraeth Bay in the Isle of Anglesey. Nineteen tubes, 1 foot in diameter and 16 feet long, were successfully sunk in the sand during the summer of 1847. Potts's method was also employed successfully for sinking the piers for a railway bridge over the River Ouse at Huntingdon. Ground conditions were evidently favourable in both locations, but the system failed at the bridge over the River Nene at Peterborough: here there were boulders in the clay forming the river bed. The foundations for the south-western railway bridge over the Thames between Datchet and Windsor were laid by the same process, but on 12 August 1849, when the line was ready to be opened, one of the tubes suddenly sank, causing a fracture in the girder resting upon it. G. W. Hemans tried the operation with cylinders 10 feet in diameter in 1850, during the construction of a bridge over the River Shannon at Athlone, on the Midland Great Western Railway of Ireland, but it proved very expensive because of the cost of pumping out the air. Trouble was again caused by boulders, which the trial borings had failed to indicate. These later examples all involved cylinders of much larger diameter.<br>
<br>Potts read a paper on his method before the Society of Arts on 10 May 1848, for which he received the Isis gold medal. He devoted the last years of his life and a considerable fortune almost exclusively to the perfecting of his invention. Unhappily it was not a financial success, and experience soon proved that its application was very limited. It had, however, one very important result, as it incidentally gave rise to the system of sinking foundations by compressed air, an invention of great importance. It was intended to employ Potts's method to sink the piers of Rochester Bridge (commenced about 1849), but it was found that the river bed was encumbered with the remains of a very ancient bridge, and that the cylinders could not be forced through the obstructions. It then occurred to John D'Urban Hughes (1807&#150;1874), Fox and Henderson's engineer in charge of the work, to reverse the process, and to pump air into the cylinders to force the water out, so that the men could work at the bottom of the cylinders, as in a diving bell. As the material was excavated from the space covered by the cylinders they sank by their own weight. An &#145;air-lock&#146; provided the means of access to and from the cylinders. Although Hughes first developed the idea independently, compressed air had already been used to sink mine shafts in France by J. Triger (1801&#150;1867) in 1838, and Hughes became aware of this through Andrew Ure's <span class="italic">Dictionary</span> and was able to make use of this information in applying the invention to bridge foundations. Hughes went on to become an acknowledged expert in the application of compressed air to foundations.<br>
<br>Through his links with Fox, Potts was able to send his sons John Thorpe and Benjamin Langford Forster (1839&#150;1910) to Fox and Henderson for training as engineers. B. L. F. Potts worked closely with E. A. Cowper of this firm for many years. Potts died at 9 Buckingham Street, Strand, London, on 23 March 1850.<br>
