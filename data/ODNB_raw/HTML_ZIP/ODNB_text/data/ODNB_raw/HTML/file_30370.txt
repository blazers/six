<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Alexander, Sir  George</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>George Alexander Gibb Samson]</span>  (1858&#150;1918), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born on 19 June 1858 at 1 Russell Villas, Russell Street, Reading, the eldest son in the family of at least three sons and one daughter of William Murray Samson (1827/8&#150;1892), a Scottish commercial traveller, and his first wife, Mary Ann Hine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Longman. He was educated at private schools in Clifton, near Bristol, and at Ealing in London, but mostly at Stirling high school, which he left when he was fifteen. His intensely anti-theatrical father wanted him to succeed him in commerce, while George himself toyed briefly with a career in medicine. Instead, he was apprenticed as a clerk to the London drapery firm of Leaf &amp; Co. However, this did not dampen his ardour for the theatre and he was soon acting in amateur theatricals. In 1874 and again in 1876 he participated in a benefit performance for the Royal Hospital for Consumption given at the St James's Theatre. He also appeared as Henri de Neuville in <span class="italic">Plot and Passion</span> at the Cabinet Theatre, King's Cross, in 1875. These and other early theatrical forays were watched over with avuncular concern by his former Scottish dominie at Stirling, Duncan MacDougall, with whom George Samson corresponded regularly.<h2>
<a name="Professionalactor"></a>Professional actor</h2>Having abandoned the conventionality of trade in 1879, joined Ada Swanborough and W. H. Vernon's repertory company at the Theatre Royal, Nottingham, and dropped his last two names as being too biblical for the stage, plain George Alexander made his professional d&eacute;but on 7 September 1879 as Charles in W. B. Bernard's <span class="italic">His Last Legs</span> and Harry Prendergast in Sydney Grundy's <span class="italic">The Snowball</span>. A few more roles in Nottingham resulted in an engagement for 1879&#150;80 with the T. W. Robertson provincial touring company and juvenile leads in Robertson's <span class="italic">Caste</span>, <span class="italic">Ours</span>, <span class="italic">School</span>, <span class="italic">Home</span>, <span class="italic">Society</span>, and <span class="italic">MP</span>. Alexander's London d&eacute;but followed on 4 April 1881 at the Standard, Shoreditch, where he was Freddy Butterscotch in Robert Reece's <span class="italic">The Guv'nor</span>. Henry Irving must have discerned some potential in this early, mundane career because he hired Alexander for the Lyceum, over, it must be said, the fledgeling actor's own objections: Alexander thought he would benefit from further experience in the provinces before attempting the West End stage. Irving's perception proved to be acute, since Alexander's performance as Caleb Deecie in the revival of James Albery's <span class="italic">The Two Roses</span> (26 December 1881) was an immediate success. Irving was probably drawn by his handsome features, sense of humour, and manliness, since he also cast Alexander as Paris in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> (8 March 1882).<br>
<br>Alexander's experience broadened as he bounced among several engagements. First he was at the Court Theatre, followed by provincial tours and Shakespearian roles (Orlando, Romeo, and Benedick) with Ellen Lancaster Wallis. A brief stint at the Adelphi in 1883 led to appearances with Kendal and Hare at the St James's, where one of his roles was Octave in <span class="italic">The Ironmaster</span> (1884) by Pinero, later a collaborator and friend.<br>
<br>Irving then rehired Alexander to play De Mauprat in Bulwer-Lytton's <span class="italic">Richelieu</span> (19 July 1884), and Alexander remained with Irving for the next six years, receiving invaluable training from the acknowledged master of the profession. However, Alexander found Irving's methods with his company extremely arduous and verging on the tyrannical: five or six hours of rehearsing with Irving often left him on the brink of tears. He vowed he would be much kinder to his own company when he ventured into management. Alexander accompanied Irving on two American tours, in 1884&#150;5 and 1887&#150;8, on one occasion deputizing for Irving when he fell ill in Boston. He scored a particular success on 9 January 1886 when he took over the title role (which he had coveted initially) in W. G. Wills's <span class="italic">Faust</span> from the ailing H. B. Conway, and played it for 384 performances. His other roles (such as Shakespeare's Orsino, Laertes, and Macduff) did not garner any accolades, although his salary increased gradually.<h2>
<a name="Earlymanagerialenterprises"></a>Early managerial enterprises</h2>Doubtless chafing under Irving's regime, and entertaining his own managerial aspirations, Alexander secured the rights to Hamilton Aid&eacute;'s <span class="italic">Dr Bill</span>, while marking time in <span class="italic">London Day by Day</span> (14 September 1889) at the Adelphi for the Gatti brothers. Soon afterwards he leased the Avenue Theatre and launched into management with <span class="italic">Dr Bill</span>, which opened on 1 February 1890. Once the Gattis finally released him, Alexander assumed the title role in <span class="italic">Dr Bill</span> and so joined the ranks of London's actor&#150;managers. His other productions at the Avenue were <span class="italic">The Grandsire</span> (21 May 1890), <span class="italic">The Struggle for Life</span> (25 September 1890), and <span class="italic">Sunlight and Shadow</span> (7 November 1890). The results were mixed, and at one point he had to cope with a business manager who absconded with the box-office takings. Undeterred, however, in November 1890 Alexander signed the lease of the St James's Theatre, which began the most significant phase of his career and that theatre's history. He was to remain there until his death in 1918.<h2>
<a name="Alexandersmethods"></a>Alexander's methods</h2>At this juncture Alexander had only eleven years' professional experience; nevertheless, his managerial policy, production methods, and overall philosophy were already determined. He wanted the best acting, which he achieved by carefully casting performers of high ability; significantly Alexander did not reserve choice roles or the spotlight for himself as did other actor&#150;managers. Stage management had to be thoughtful and natural, and backed by appropriate scenery. Another objective was the encouragement of British dramatists, and of eighty-one productions at the St James's only eight were devoted to foreign writers. Alexander practised careful financial management (perhaps a reflection of his Scottish heritage), but he paid both good salaries and royalties for the finest results. From one perspective, Alexander presented a range of plays: comedy, drama, modern romances, farce, costume drama, tragedy, history plays, the occasional play about provincial life, all found a place on the St James's stage. Nevertheless, his major concern was to present plays which would attract and retain a fashionable society audience, or playgoers interested in the doings of the smart and fashionable. Hesketh Pearson characterized aptly Alexander's productions:<blockquote>In a typical St James's play the humorous characters were delightfully playful, the serious characters charmingly sentimental, and the plot savoured of scandal without being objectionably truthful. Adultery was invariably touched on and inevitably touched up; theft was made thrilling and murder romantic. (Pearson, 23)</blockquote>In these endeavours Alexander was abetted by his able wife, Florence Jane Th&eacute;leur (1857/8&#150;1946), the daughter of Edward Th&eacute;leur, whom he had married on 8 August 1882. She acted as his fashion and artistic director, as well as general adviser. She would scout for potential performers, and helped to manage Alexander's affairs, while maintaining a deceptively charming fa&ccedil;ade. In fact, she possessed a strong personality and was a firm friend.<br>
<br>Alexander's other methods were similarly focused on success. He consulted with dramatists, often working on their scripts with them, Pinero and R. C. Carton being noteworthy exceptions to this practice. Prior to rehearsal Alexander established the necessary blocking, envisioning exactly what he wanted. Rehearsals began promptly and lasted only three hours (from eleven to two o'clock) since Alexander believed longer rehearsals were unprofitable: his painful memories of Irving lingered on. This also reflected his concern for the welfare of the members of his company, with many of whom he worked repeatedly, for his was virtually a stock company. And, always, he saw himself as but one piece in the theatrical jigsaw puzzle, never the star.<h2>
<a name="TheStJamessTheatre"></a>The St James's Theatre</h2>Alexander opened his St James's management on 31 January 1891 by transferring <span class="italic">Sunlight and Shadow</span>, followed by several other offerings. His first major achievement came with Oscar Wilde's <span class="italic">Lady Windermere's Fan</span> (20 February 1892). Their association was somewhat surprising given Wilde's flamboyancy and Alexander's own intrinsic modesty and fastidiousness. But Alexander could draw on all his diplomatic skills when working with such acerbic, egotistical people. He cajoled Wilde with practical advice for improving the piece, some of which Wilde ignored, until first-night critics justified Alexander's judgement. In the end Wilde enjoyed success and controversy, and went home &pound;7000 richer.<br>
<br>Equally brilliant was Wilde's <span class="italic">The Importance of being Earnest</span> which Alexander produced on 4 February 1895, and which incidentally demonstrated that Alexander, as John Worthing, could act in farcical comedy. Again Alexander advised Wilde about the text itself: for example, he convinced Wilde to compress acts two and three into a single one. Unfortunately, the success was short-lived: Wilde's trial and conviction on charges of homosexual behaviour brought unwonted attention to the St James's. Alexander tried to keep the production going by removing Wilde's name from the production, but the ruse failed and Alexander had to withdraw the play. The incident caused a breach between the two men for several years, although Alexander later paid Wilde small monthly sums, and bequeathed his rights in Wilde's plays to the latter's son, Vyvian Holland. <span class="italic">Earnest</span> was successful eventually in 1909, when Alexander revived it and reprised Jack Worthing for 316 performances. Interestingly, in November 1895, Alexander himself skirted the law and social obloquy when he was arrested for soliciting a prostitute. He maintained stoutly he had merely given half a crown to an importunate beggar woman: a reluctant magistrate gave Alexander the benefit of the doubt.<br>
<br>More compatible in temperament, style, and method was Alexander's association with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35530/', "A. W. Pinero")</script>. Their first play together was <span class="italic">The Second Mrs Tanqueray</span> (27 May 1893), considered at the time a daring treatment of the &#145;woman with a past&#146;, although it did not really exceed the social purview of its audience. The play was significant in establishing the career of the temperamental and caustic Mrs Patrick Campbell (scouted by Mrs Alexander), who was cast as Paula Tanqueray. Alexander played opposite her as her insincere, spineless husband. While the carefully mounted production proved highly successful, Mrs Campbell irritated and annoyed Alexander: she found him distant and too dignified; Alexander thought her insufficiently decorous. They performed together again only rarely.<br>
<br>Pinero's second St James's piece, <span class="italic">The Princess and the Butterfly</span> (29 March 1897), was less successful: it achieved a respectable run, but was expensive to produce. Alexander appeared in one of his typical <i>raisonneur</i> roles, Sir George Lamorant. The production also caused a rift between the two men, largely because Pinero insisted on autocratic rights as a playwright&#150;director. When they eventually became reconciled, the result was <span class="italic">His House in Order</span> (1 February 1906), for which Alexander gave Pinero the free directorial hand he required. Its 427 performances provided Alexander with a resounding artistic and financial hit. Interestingly, Alexander, ever closely followed in such matters, set a new men's fashion by wearing a soft-collared shirt with a lounge suit as he played Hilary Jesson. Later collaborations with Pinero were <span class="italic">The Thunderbolt</span> (9 May 1908) and <span class="italic">Mid-Channel</span> (2 September 1909), both deserving better receptions, the delightful one-act <span class="italic">Playgoers</span> (31 March 1913), and the somewhat uninspired <span class="italic">The Big Drum</span> (1 September 1915).<br>
<br>Alexander's association with H. A. Jones produced similarly mixed results. <span class="italic">The Masqueraders</span> (28 April 1894) was successful (the cast included Mrs Campbell, capitalizing on her feat as Paula Tanqueray), while <span class="italic">The Triumph of the Philistines</span> (11 May 1895) flopped. More sensationally disastrous was <span class="italic">Guy Domville</span> (5 January 1895), Henry James's attempt to break into the potentially lucrative theatrical market. While well staged with a good cast, the play itself (despite praise from sympathetic critics) lacked congruity, and when Alexander mistakenly led James forward in response to first-night cries for the author, James was soundly booed off the stage by a segment of the audience. He never wrote another play.<br>
<br>However, Alexander was undeterred by such set-backs, and pressed ahead with other interests. He encouraged Stephen Phillips, whose work was rather in vogue, to write a poetic tragedy. The result was <span class="italic">Paolo and Francesca</span> (6 March 1902), which was received enthusiastically and, incidentally, launched Henry Ainley's career as a Shakespearian and romantic actor, while Alexander himself was a hit as Giovanni Malatesta. The piece ran for 134 performances. However, Alexander's interest in poetic drama was not extensive: he produced only two Shakespearian plays, <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> (2 December 1896) and <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span> (16 February 1898), both successful productions.<h2>
<a name="Latercareerdeathandreputation"></a>Later career, death, and reputation</h2>Alexander was at his best on stage in such costume romances as Edward Rose's dramatization of Anthony Hope's novel <span class="italic">The Prisoner of Zenda</span> (7 January 1896). For 255 performances Alexander was splendid in the dual roles of Rudolf and Rassendyll, roles matched perfectly with his persona as the ultimate matin&eacute;e idol, projecting immaculate refinement. Audience, play, and actor were similarly suited with J. O. Hobbes's <span class="italic">The Ambassador</span> (2 June 1898), with Alexander in the title role. However, there were also notable failures, particularly the &pound;6000 loss Alexander incurred with Jethro Bethell's musical version of <span class="italic">Turandot</span> (18 January 1913), given a lavish production. Altogether twenty-seven of his productions actually resulted in losses; nevertheless, he left an estate of more than &pound;90,000 at his death.<br>
<br>Alexander gave other notable performances. On 16 September 1895 he appeared in a royal command performance of Carton's <span class="italic">Liberty Hall</span> at Balmoral and received a silver cigar box from Queen Victoria. For the royal command performance for Edward VII on 4 December 1908 Alexander was Edward Thursfield in Alfred Sutro's <span class="italic">The Builder of Bridges</span>, while on 17 May 1911 he played Alfred Evelyn in Bulwer-Lytton's <span class="italic">Money</span> in a royal command performance for the German emperor given at Drury Lane. Also at Drury Lane, Alexander played, at the playwright's request, in Hall Caine's <span class="italic">The Prodigal Son</span> (1905), for which he received &pound;250 weekly.<br>
<br>Outside the theatre, Alexander found other outlets for his organizational abilities. From March 1907 he represented the South St Pancras division on the London county council for six years, and served diligently on several committees. But for ill health, he might have run for parliament. There was also committee work for the Actors' Benevolent Fund, the Royal General Theatrical Fund, and the Coronation Gala Performance in 1911 (given at His Majesty's), while he was also vice-president of the Actors' Association and president of the Actresses' Franchise League. Only his considerable diplomacy as chairman of the organizing committee for the Shakespearian tercentenary celebration at Drury Lane in 1916 kept the whole affair together. Characteristically he put forward F. R. Benson's name for the knighthood he received on that occasion. Alexander's own knighthood in 1911 had proved a popular award and eminently appropriate for such a dignified leader of the theatre. An honorary LLD from the University of Bristol followed in 1912.<br>
<br>When the First World War broke out, Alexander's health was already in decline. However, he continued his work at the St James's and also toiled unflaggingly for several charities, notably the Red Cross Society, the League of Mercy, and the order of St John of Jerusalem, organizing fund-raising matin&eacute;es, f&ecirc;tes, and garden parties. His health failed finally on 16 March 1918, when he died of consumption and diabetes at his country home, Little Court, Chorleywood, Hertfordshire. He was buried there four days later, mourned by such friends as Pinero, Ellen Terry, Irene Vanbrugh, Lillian Braithwaite, and C. Aubrey Smith. The staff of the St James's carried his coffin. A much larger, society-studded congregation attended his memorial service in London on 22 March 1918.<br>
<br>Alexander was no revolutionary, although a handful of his productions had a contemporary, albeit passing daring aura. However, he applied high standards to every aspect of his art and profession, and he insisted on dignity, refinement, and respectability. He nurtured his performers and encouraged native playwrights, although always with a careful business eye. In short, he knew what a St James's audience wanted and satisfied that demand thoroughly.<br>
