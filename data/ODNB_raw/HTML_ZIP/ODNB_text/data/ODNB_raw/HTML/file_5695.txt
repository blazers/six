<span class="headword">Clive, Sir  Edward</span>  (1704&#150;1771), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the eldest son of Edward Clive of Wormbridge, Herefordshire, and Aldermanbury, London, and his wife, Sarah Key, daughter of a Bristol merchant. According to family tradition, George Clive (<i>d</i>. 1780), barrister and husband of the actress Catherine (Kitty) Clive, was his brother. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1719, and to University College, Oxford, in 1722, and was called to the bar by the former in 1725. His first legal appointment seems to have been as steward of Newcastle under Lyme in 1724, a position which he held until 1740. In 1741 he became deputy justice of Carmarthen, and member of parliament for Mitchell, Cornwall, in the interest of Thomas Scawen. He remained in parliament until his appointment to the bench in 1745.<br>
<br>During this period he sought a patent of precedence from Lord Hardwicke, without success, and he made a similar unavailing application through John Carteret, Earl Granville, with the support of Chief Justice Willes. Nevertheless, in 1745 on Hardwicke's recommendation he was appointed a baron of the exchequer, in place of Sir Laurence Carter, and in 1753 succeeded Sir Thomas Burnet as a puisne justice of the common pleas, whereupon he was knighted. In 1761 he suggested to Hardwicke that Chief Baron Parker should succeed Sir John Willes as chief justice of the common pleas, and that he might himself succeed Parker, with the explanation that &#145;The honour, and the ease in point of spring circuits are the temptations to me, as I am now on the worst side fifty years of age, tho' I thank God not yet sensible of any great infirmities&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 35596, fol. 92). This proposed arrangement was not, however, adopted.<br>
<br>In 1745 Clive married Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Symons of Mynde Park, Herefordshire. Elizabeth died in 1762, and the following year he married Judith, daughter of his cousin, the Revd Benjamin Clive; she died in 1796 at Wormbridge. There were no children from either marriage.<br>
<br>Clive retired from the bench in February 1770 with a pension of &pound;1200 a year, and was replaced by Sir William Blackstone. He died the following year, on 16 April 1771. He has been identified as the subject of one of the cruel caricatures in William Hogarth's sketch <span class="italic">The Bench</span>, which was engraved in 1758, though this is open to considerable doubt. Clive had a London residence in Ormond Street. After his death his Wormbridge residence passed to his wife's nephew, Edward Bolton Clive (1765&#150;1845), great-grandson of Clive's eldest uncle, Robert Clive, who demolished it; the estate remained in the family in the early twenty-first century.<br>
