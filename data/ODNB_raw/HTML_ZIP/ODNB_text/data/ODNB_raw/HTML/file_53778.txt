<span class="headword">Bates <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Dwyer]</span>,  Daisy May</span>  (1859&#150;1951), <span class="occ">anthropologist and social worker among Aboriginal Australians</span>, was born around 16 October 1859, at Roscrea, co. Tipperary, Ireland, the third of four children of Edward Dwyer, shopkeeper and small farmer, and his wife Bridget, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hunt. Both parents died within five years and relatives cared for the children. Daisy received a secondary education which added linguistic facility to her characteristic lifetime oral fluency, selective memory, and aristocratic values. Born a Roman Catholic she claimed Anglicanism and the O'Dwyer surname.<br>
<br>Bates alleged that her migration to Australia was necessitated by tuberculosis, but her longevity under harsh conditions suggests that this was part of her increasingly fictitious persona. She sailed on the <i>Almora</i> for Queensland, disembarking at Townsville in January 1883. While a governess on Fanning Downs station near Charters Towers, on 13 March 1884 she married according to Anglican rites Edwin Henry Murrant (1864&#150;1902), a stockman who became notorious in the South African War as Breaker Morant [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52462/', "Morant, Harry Harbord")</script>]. They soon separated, and their union remained unknown until 1978.<br>
<br>On 17 February 1885 Daisy bigamously married John Bates (1856&#150;1935), drover, in the Anglican church, Nowra, New South Wales. Their son, Arnold Hamilton Bates, was born at Bathurst on 26 August 1886. Sporadic family relationships virtually ceased from 1902.<br>
<br>In 1894 Daisy Bates returned to England, gaining journalistic experience that would later sustain her when she contributed 270 newspaper articles on Aborigines. She arrived in Perth in 1899 to investigate claims in <span class="italic">The Times</span> of atrocities against Kimberley Aborigines. After visiting the north-west with her husband, she accepted an invitation from Perth's Catholic bishop M. Gibney to spend three months at the Trappist Beagle Bay mission, which enabled her to gain first-hand knowledge of the position of Aborigines.<br>
<br>Yet, when <span class="italic">The Times</span> published further allegations during May 1904, Bates surprisingly wrote defending pastoralist and government Aboriginal relations. Possibly these opinions recommended her for official employment, because she was appointed by the government of Western Australia to collect ethnographic and linguistic data. Across five years she visited Aboriginal communities, amassing data for a government-sponsored book, for which she sought advice from Andrew Lang.<br>
<br>Bates's project became diverted in 1910, when she was assigned to A. R. (Radcliffe-)Brown's Western Australian anthropological expedition. Their friction is legendary; the distressing conditions among exiled diseased Aborigines on Dorr&eacute; and Bernier islands influenced her towards welfare activities. Insight into antipathy between Bates and Brown was provided by a fellow expeditioner, Grant Watson, and by later anthropological evaluations of White and Needham.<br>
<br>The interlude in Bates's official work proved disastrous, because the incoming government terminated her appointment in 1912, reneging on publishing her book. So commenced her self-imposed years of tented isolation and penury at Eucla and Ooldea, a bizarre attraction for train passengers, including whistle-stop visits by royalty.<br>
<br>From 1932 Bates was befriended by a journalist, Ernestine Hill, who popularized her seclusion and affectionate grandmotherly Aboriginal title, Kabbarli. Bates was appointed CBE in 1934, and from 1936 she received a meagre government weekly allowance of &pound;2, later &pound;5 5<i>s</i>., to prepare her papers for the National Library of Australia (fifty-two boxes eventuated).<br>
<br>Bates is judged harshly from her later newspaper notes and <span class="italic">The Passing of the Aborigines</span> (1938), but her Ooldea years belong to her old age when both she and her writings approached mythology. Her ill-fated memoir, <span class="italic">The Native Tribes of Western Australia</span> (1985), based upon participant observation, only needed careful editing to establish its significance. Her work remains controversial, although championed by feminist writers. Bates shared the contemporary opinion that the Aboriginal peoples were doomed; she was contemptuous of people of mixed heritage and preferred male informants; she camped distant from &#145;her&#146; people. She later publicized Aboriginal cannibalism, which provided fuel for racists, but which was a travesty of reality.<br>
<br>Blue-eyed and slightly built, Bates was 5 feet 3 inches tall, a grand eccentric, aptly described in her bush setting, equipped with umbrella, &#145;gloved, veiled, tailored, sailor-hatted, cravatted, shirt-waisted, voluminously skirted&#146;  (Hill, 3). She passed her final years in mock gentility in Adelaide, where she died at the Hydro Sanatorium, Prospect, on 18 April 1951 from myocardial degeneration and senility, leaving &pound;66. She was buried on 20 April 1951 at North Road cemetery, Nailsworth, Adelaide.<br>
