<span class="headword">L&oacute;egaire mac N&eacute;ill</span>  (<em>fl. </em>5th cent.), <span class="occ">high-king of Ireland</span>, was a son of N&iacute;all No&iacute;g&iacute;allach, ancestor of the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill dynasties. He is associated with three elements of Irish mythology: the arrival of Patrick, the cattle tribute (or <i>b&oacute;roma</i>), and the Feast of Tara. His reign was dated by the seventh-century hagiographer T&iacute;rech&aacute;n to about 427&#150;63, but many or all of the dates associated with L&oacute;egaire are based on the artificially constructed chronology surrounding St Patrick and it has been suggested that he died as late as the 480s.<br>
<br>According to the hagiographer Muirch&uacute; moccu Mactheni, who wrote <i>c</i>.700, L&oacute;egaire, &#145;a great king, fierce and pagan, an emperor of barbarians&#146;  (Bieler, 74&#150;7), dominated Ireland at the time of Patrick's arrival. One night he was celebrating a pagan festival at Tara, and it was forbidden for anyone to kindle a fire before the king's was alight. However, it was also Easter eve and Patrick lit a fire which was visible from Tara. L&oacute;egaire's druids advised the king that the other fire should be put out that night, for it would otherwise never be extinguished. Patrick was summoned to L&oacute;egaire and shamed the king's druids and advisers by a series of spectacular and violent miracles. A number of attempts were made by the king and others to kill Patrick, who warned L&oacute;egaire that he must accept the faith or die. Having taken the counsel of his people, the king submitted, and was told by Patrick: &#145;Since you have resisted my teaching and been offensive to me, the days of your own reign shall run on, but none of your offspring shall ever be king&#146;  (ibid., 96&#150;9). This curse served to explain the marginal status of Cen&eacute;l L&oacute;egairi, a Brega dynasty which traced itself to L&oacute;egaire.<br>
<br>Muirch&uacute;'s account differs from that of T&iacute;rech&aacute;n, who said that L&oacute;egaire remained a pagan in spite of Patrick's miracles. He had been bidden by his late father not to accept the faith but to be given a warrior's burial on the hill of Tara, bearing arms, his face towards Leinster. L&oacute;egaire's hostility to Leinster is also seen in the chronicles, which indicate that his military activities were primarily against that province. The sons of N&iacute;all No&iacute;g&iacute;allach are said to have been bequeathed various attributes belonging to their father, and fittingly L&oacute;egaire inherited &#145;warfare&#146;.<br>
<br>L&oacute;egaire's kingship is acknowledged by the chronicles, which say that he held the &#145;Feast of Tara&#146;. This was probably originally a pagan ritual and it was celebrated only by the king of Tara, an office which later in the middle ages reflected a claim to the kingship of Ireland. L&oacute;egaire is universally accepted as king of Ireland by the regnal lists, but at such an early date neither he nor any other king can have enjoyed such authority. However, he may have ruled Connacht, for, according to T&iacute;rech&aacute;n, Patrick encountered L&oacute;egaire's daughters at the royal site of Rathcroghan, in Roscommon.<br>
<br>L&oacute;egaire is connected with legal matters in two notable ways: T&iacute;rech&aacute;n shows him acting as a judge (along with Patrick) in a dispute about an inheritance; and the prologue to the law code <span class="italic">Senchas M&aacute;r</span> says that L&oacute;egaire summoned together the best of the men of Ireland, including Patrick, in order to discuss the arrangement of their laws. In the event, L&oacute;egaire was only one of nine men entrusted by Patrick with the Christianizing of the laws, which became the <span class="italic">Senchas M&aacute;r</span>.<br>
<br>The medieval <i>b&oacute;roma</i> saga tells of the heavy tribute which Leinster was expected to pay to the king of Ireland in reparation for an ancient treachery. L&oacute;egaire invaded Leinster in order to exact the tribute and was captured following his defeat in the battle of &Aacute;th Dara. He was freed on a promise that he would remit the tribute and named the elements as his sureties. However, within three years he returned to Leinster and seized cattle. As a consequence of this he died by the elements: the sun burned him, the earth swallowed him, and the wind (that is, his breath) departed from him. However, there are alternative versions of his death. One account says that he died as a result of a curse by Patrick. Another says that there was a prophecy that he would die between Ireland and Britain. He tried to evade his fate by never going to sea, but the prophecy was fulfilled when he died between two hills called Ireland and Britain.<br>
<br>T&iacute;rech&aacute;n names two of L&oacute;egaire's daughters, and twelve sons are attributed to him, the mother of one of them being Muirecht ingen Echdach Muinremuir. He is also said to have been married to Angas ingen Ailella Tassaig of the &Eacute;oganachta dynasties of Munster.<br>
