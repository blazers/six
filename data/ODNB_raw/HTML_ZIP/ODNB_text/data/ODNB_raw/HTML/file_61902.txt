<span class="headword">Morris,  Robert</span>  (1743&#150;1793), <span class="occ">radical</span>, was born in Swansea on 4 August 1743, the elder surviving son, of two sons and four daughters, out of twelve children born to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62913/', "Robert Morris (bap. 1701?, d. 1768)")</script>, copper industrialist of Swansea, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jenkins (<i>d</i>. 1786), of Machynlleth. Educated at Charterhouse and Oriel College, Oxford (1760&#150;64), Morris enrolled in 1763 at Lincoln's Inn and was called to the bar in 1767. He assisted in the successful defence of Lord Baltimore in a notorious rape case of 1768, but was diverted from his legal career into politics by the Middlesex election episode of 1768&#150;9 concerning John Wilkes, and on 25 February 1769 was elected secretary of the new <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/73620', "Society of Gentleman Supporters of the Bill of Rights")</script>. Morris was the public face of the society, since all its notices appeared over his name until he resigned eighteen months later, pleading overwork, and he was known in the press as &#145;Bill of Rights Morris&#146;. It was Morris, Wilkes, and journalist John Almon who in 1771 concocted the scheme of deploying against parliamentary privilege the chartered rights of the City of London in order to provide a refuge there for printers reporting parliamentary debates. Morris played an active part in the plot, which secured that press freedom, contacting various printers and acting as their learned counsel with the advice that the House of Commons had no legal right to order their arrest. The City of London acknowledged his role by giving him a general retainer and bestowing on him the freedom of the City in April 1771.<br>
<br>Then occurred an escapade that ended both Morris's legal career and his political aspirations. On the death of Lord Baltimore in 1771 Morris was appointed a guardian of his illegitimate children, but in May 1772 eloped to the continent with one of them, twelve-year-old Fanny (Frances Mary) Harford (1759&#150;1832), twice illegally marrying her&#151;at Ypres on 21 May and at Ahrensburgh on 3 January 1773. Fanny soon decided to end the relationship, and returned to Britain in January 1774, Morris following in April. For a decade he fought to prevent annulment of the marriage, which was pronounced void on 21 May 1784. Morris, meanwhile, debarred from his profession, lived off his wits, gambling with loaded dice and suspected even of being a highwayman. In 1785 he turned over a new leaf, returning to south Wales on marrying a farmer's daughter, Sarah Prichard (<i>d</i>. 1789), on 28 June 1785 and inheriting the family estate of Tredegar Fawr, near Swansea, on his mother's death in 1786. Now a small squire, Morris participated in a Glamorgan by-election of 1789, writing several pamphlets to support a candidate successfully challenging the local oligarchy.<br>
<br>Respectability beckoned, but on the sudden death of his wife in 1789 Morris again threw discretion to the winds. In 1790 he obtained permission from the East India Company to practise law in Bengal, but found on his arrival that the judges there, aware of his unsavoury past, refused to allow him to do so. Morris then visited numerous gaols in Bengal, informing many prisoners that they were being illegally detained and should break out. He died of a liver complaint, and was buried in India on 29 November 1793. &#145;I do love bustle, variety and disturbance to my very soul&#146;, Morris wrote in his diary for 12 May 1774, and that may serve as his epitaph  (<span class="italic">Radical Adventurer</span>, 172). His lively and erratic career contrasts with that of his younger brother John, who so well managed the family copper business that Morriston developed as a company town, and he obtained a knighthood in 1806.<br>
