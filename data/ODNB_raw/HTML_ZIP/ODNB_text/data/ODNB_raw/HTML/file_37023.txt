<span class="headword">Wordie, Sir  James Mann</span>  (1889&#150;1962), <span class="occ">polar explorer and scholar</span>, was born on 26 April 1889 at Partick, Lanarkshire, the youngest son of John Wordie, carting contractor, and his wife, Jane Catherine Mathers Mann. He was a first cousin of Sir James Mann. He was educated at Glasgow Academy and Glasgow University, where he obtained his BSc with honours and distinction in geology in 1910. He went as an advanced student to St John's College, Cambridge, reading for part two of the natural sciences tripos (geology) and graduating in 1912. He then began research work in geology. In 1913 he won the Harkness scholarship in geology and in 1914 was appointed university demonstrator in petrology&#151;an office he held until 1917 and again from 1919 to 1923. His work brought him into touch with geologists such as Frank Debenham and Raymond Priestley, returned from the second expedition of Captain Scott. These contacts strengthened an interest in Arctic and Antarctic exploration and scientific discovery, already awakened by reading books on travel and mountaineering in his father's library and by working with J. W. Gregory.<br>
<br>In 1914 Wordie joined the Antarctic expedition of Sir Ernest Shackleton as geologist and chief of the scientific staff, and so served under a distinguished explorer whom he always acknowledged as his master. The expedition proved arduous and perilous in the extreme. Wordie himself spent a year in <i>Endurance</i> drifting &#145;beset and sinking&#146; in the Weddell Sea; a period of discomfort and danger at Ocean Camp; and a winter marooned on Elephant Island while Shackleton made his epic voyage to South Georgia for help. Wordie ably played his part in maintaining the morale of the expedition; and in spite of its failure to fulfil its exploratory intentions and in spite of the rigours he had undergone, he brought back important geological specimens and useful observations on oceanography and on the polar ice pack.<br>
<br>Wordie returned in 1917 to a country at war, joined the Royal Artillery, and saw service in France. On his demobilization, the polar regions called him back: in 1919 and again in 1920 he went to Spitsbergen as geologist and second-in-command of the Scottish Spitsbergen expedition under W. S. Bruce. In 1921 he won a fellowship at St John's College, Cambridge, and henceforward made the college, and Cambridge more generally, the base from which to set out on a long series of Arctic and Antarctic expeditions. He went to Jan Mayen and east Greenland in 1921, 1923, 1926, and 1929 (in the former he made the first ascent of Beerenberg, for he was a dedicated mountaineer); to north-west Greenland, Ellesmere Island, and Baffin Island in 1934 and 1937. The Second World War ended further polar exploration, but throughout it (indeed, from 1923 to 1949) Wordie served on the <i>Discovery</i> committee of the Colonial Office which advised on the oceanographical work undertaken by <i>Discovery I</i> and <i>II</i>. From 1937 to 1955 he chaired the committee of management of the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge of which he was a founder member.<br>
<br>The young explorer under Shackleton, the leader of expeditions which introduced many young men (notably Gino Watkins and Vivian Fuchs) to the polar world, had now become the elder statesman of Arctic and Antarctic exploration, whose advice was widely sought and always influential. During the war Wordie served for a time as director of the Cambridge sub-centre of the naval intelligence division. His knowledge of local conditions was invaluable to the planning of operation TABARIN, whose objective was the maintenance of British claims to Graham Land and adjacent territories. This grew into the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey, whose advisory scientific committee sat under his chairmanship. So it was that in 1947 Wordie was in polar latitudes for the last time, visiting South Orkney and South Shetland as well as Graham Land. But in his role of elder statesman of polar exploration he remained influential, as deputy chairman advising Fuchs when the Trans-Antarctic Expedition was being planned and as chairman of the British national committee for the International Geophysical Year (1954&#150;8). He was also chairman of the British Mountaineering Council (1953&#150;6). He is commemorated by the Wordie Glacier in Graham Land and the Wordie Crag in Spitsbergen.<br>
<br>Closely bound up with Wordie's interests in polar exploration was his service to the Royal Geographical Society. He was a fellow from 1921 and became a member of the council in the following year. He was honorary secretary from 1934 to 1948, spanning the difficult war period. After a time as foreign secretary he was president of the society, from 1951 to 1954, and in that capacity he welcomed back the expedition under Sir John Hunt which made the first ascent of Mount Everest; he became the first chairman of the Mount Everest Foundation.<br>
<br>Wordie's third great absorbing interest was St John's College, Cambridge, to which he was devoted. After election to his fellowship in 1921 he was appointed a tutor in 1923. From 1921 until 1952 (with intermissions) he was director of studies in geography. In 1933 he became senior tutor, an office which he held with that of president from 1950 until (perhaps rather to his surprise) he was elected master in 1952. He held the mastership until 1959, when his health had already begun to fail. As a tutor Wordie showed himself, though shy, an excellent judge of men, and brought his remarkable memory to bear on them, their affairs, and their family connections with unfailing accuracy. His filing system seemed, too, to depend on memory, for his large table was littered with papers from which he never failed to extract the document required. As an elder statesman and eventually master, his shrewdness and instinctively accurate judgement of people served the college well; and the college benefited also from the affection he generated in his pupils. As a committee man he was better at deciding on a line of action (usually the right one) than at justifying it in argument.<br>
<br>Wordie gained the Back grant of the Royal Geographical Society in 1920 and its founder's gold medal in 1933; the Bruce medal of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1926); the gold medal of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society (1944); and the Daly medal of the American Geographical Society (1952). He received honorary degrees from the universities of Glasgow and Hull, was an honorary fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, and was a commander of the order of St Olaf of Norway. He was appointed CBE in 1947 and knighted in 1957.<br>
<br>On 21 March 1923 Wordie married Gertrude Mary (<i>d</i>. 1971), daughter of George Thompson Henderson; they had three sons and two daughters. He died in Cambridge on 16 January 1962.<br>
