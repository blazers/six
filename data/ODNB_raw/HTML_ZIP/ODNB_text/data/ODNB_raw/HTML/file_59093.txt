<span class="headword">Brayfield,  John James</span>  (1752/3&#150;1821), <span class="occ">writer on sport</span>, was the only son of Sarah Brayfield (1732/3&#150;1820) of Camberwell, Surrey, and possibly of George Brayfield (<i>d</i>. 1785), a former governor of London's St Bartholomew's Hospital, who died suddenly in the Strand in September 1785. On 27 December 1773 he married Elizabeth Childs (<i>d</i>. in or after 1821) at St Leonard, Shoreditch, London. Little more is known of Brayfield's life apart from what appears in an obituary in the <span class="italic">Sporting Magazine</span> for March 1821. This describes him as a lifelong habitu&eacute; of London fairs, boxing matches, races, and &#145;diversions of every kind&#146; from the &#145;ring made by the first rate amateurs of the fancy&#146; (that is prizefights) down to the weekly badger-baiting in Black Boy Alley. The latter pastime was said to have been stopped by the intervention of the Society for the Reformation of Manners in 1803, though a later revival is possible. To this catalogue of spectacles Brayfield also added public hangings, being a &#145;constant at Newgate executions&#146;.<br>
<br>Brayfield was almost certainly the J. J. B. responsible for some of the more interesting and perceptive contributions to the sporting press during the early nineteenth century. The <span class="italic">Sporting Magazine's</span> essay &#145;On the art of swimming&#146; (June 1811), for example, was aimed at young readers, particularly those whom &#145;pleasure or other motives&#146; took to the coast. J. J. B. provided a discussion of buoyancy aids such as corks and bladders (of which he approved), and his thoughts on the best way to learn: walking into the sea breast-deep and then repeatedly throwing an egg towards the shore and then diving towards the object. In a more substantial article two years later, &#145;The importance of regulating the diversions of people&#146;, J. J. B. drew attention to the then widespread alarm at the degeneracy of modern popular recreations, such as gurning, sack-racing, and competitions to eat hot puddings, which he considered a far cry from the former pastimes of long bow or cudgel play. Equally deplorable was the equation of cards and dice as the &#145;chief sports&#146; of the &#145;quality of both sexes&#146;. His recommendation that country gentlemen encourage &#145;manly and innocent sports&#146; was both a means of fostering well-being and an instrument of social control by making the tenantry &#145;brave and good subjects&#146;.<br>
<br>Brayfield is thought to have lived in the parish of St Giles, Camberwell. He died aged sixty-eight and, according to the parish registers of St Botolph, Aldersgate, London, was buried, probably at St Botolph's, on 16 February 1821. He was survived by his wife, Elizabeth, who was later described as living in St Luke's parish, Middlesex, and who received an annuity in Brayfield's will  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/1642, sig. 248). Other bequests were made to a grandson, J. J. B. Willis, the son of Brayfield's natural daughter married to a John Willis.<br>
