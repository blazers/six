<span class="headword">Gopal,  Sarvepalli</span>  (1923&#150;2002), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born in Madras, India, on 23 April 1923, the only son (there were five daughters) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31577/', "Sir Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1888&#150;1975)")</script>, philosopher and president of India, and his wife, Sivakamu (<i>d</i>. 1956), daughter of Talpuru Chenchurammiah, railway stationmaster. He was educated at Mill Hill School, London, Madras Christian College, and Balliol College, Oxford, where he won the Curzon prize but took only a third-class degree in modern history, in 1947. He stayed on at Balliol to complete his DPhil, on the viceroyalty of Lord Ripon, in 1951.<br>
<br>Gopal's academic career began as a lecturer, then reader in history at Andhra University, Waltair (1948&#150;52). He then worked for the government of India, first as assistant director of the National Archives of India (1952&#150;4) and later as director, historical division, ministry of external affairs (1954&#150;66). In the latter capacity he came into close contact with Nehru. During the Indo-China War of 1962 he was Nehru's chief adviser on India's frontier with China. Having spent a year as Commonwealth Fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1963&#150;4, in 1966 he succeeded Kenneth Ballhatchet to the readership in modern South Asian history, Oxford University, and the professorial fellowship at St Antony's College that went with the appointment (St Antony's elected him an honorary fellow in 1995). He returned to India in 1971 to take up the chair in contemporary history in the newly founded Jawaharlal Nehru University. He and Romila Thapar were the main inspiration behind the university's Centre for Historical Studies. He was deeply involved in shaping the new university, but rejected three times the offer of its vice-chancellorship. He retired in 1983, becoming an emeritus professor.<br>
<br>Gopal's career as a historian began with a series of works on British policies in India and political biographies of two viceroys, Ripon (1953) and Irwin (1957), whom he used to describe in private as the &#145;good viceroys&#146;. The biographies were notable for their sympathetic treatment, unusual in a historian committed to nationalist and anti-colonial ideology. His study <span class="italic">British Policy in India</span> (1965) broke new ground at two levels. First, the work was based on unpublished archival material as well as private papers, unlike most earlier works on the subject. Secondly, he was the first historian to focus on policy formation in Whitehall and not simply in India. His very first contribution to Indian history, <span class="italic">The Permanent Settlement in Bengal</span> (1949), based on his Curzon prize essay at Oxford, had been socio-economic in its orientation. However, he spent the greater part of his creative life working on the life and work of Nehru, a three-volume study (1975&#150;84) being followed by a one-volume summary of the same (1989), the latter a truly brilliant contribution to Indian historiography. Also remarkable for its frankness was his biography of his father (1989), which is often considered his best work. He was also the general editor of the volumes entitled <span class="italic">Towards Freedom</span>, the Indian counterpart of the multi-volume <span class="italic">Transfer of Power in India</span> edited by Nicholas Mansergh: the different volumes in the series, bringing together the official and private papers on the Indian side, were edited by different editors under Gopal's general direction. He was awarded the degree of DLitt by the University of Oxford in recognition of his life's work. He also received honorary degrees from Andhra, Tirupati, Banaras, and Hyderabad universities.<br>
<br>Gopal, though primarily an academic, had a deep interest in the political evolution of India. He cherished particularly the secular and multicultural values of the Nehruvian era, and twice stood forth at great risk to his personal welfare as a defender of the democratic and secular values of the Indian polity. He refused to co-operate with Indira Gandhi when she suppressed democratic practices and institutions by declaring an emergency in 1975, and suffered considerably as a result. Again, during the controversy over the Ramjanmabhumi temple in 1992, when Hindu fanatics destroyed a mosque that, they claimed, was built on the site of a temple, he was in the forefront of academics who courted considerable danger by confronting the politics of hatred and intolerance. He was a signatory at the height of the crisis to the document entitled &#145;Political abuse of history&#146; and had already edited a book entitled <span class="italic">The Anatomy of a Confrontation</span> (1991). In 1978 he served as president of the Indian History Congress, and in retirement he served as chairman of the Indian Institute of Advanced Study (1992&#150;2002), the Madras Institute of Development Studies (1995&#150;7), and the Indian Institute of Social Studies (1995&#150;8). A leading academic and a prominent public figure, he was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, the second highest state honour in India. Deeply religious in his private life, he cherished the values of rationalism and liberal humanism, which he had absorbed from his family environment and his very fruitful association with Nehru. He lived latterly in Chennai (Madras), where he died on 20 April 2002 of kidney failure following a prolonged illness. He was survived by his wife, Indira, and cremated on 21 April at Besant Nagar crematorium.<br>
