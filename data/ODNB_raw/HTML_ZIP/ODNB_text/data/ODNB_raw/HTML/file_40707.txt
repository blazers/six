<span class="headword">Berger,  Francesco</span>  (1834&#150;1933), <span class="occ">music administrator</span>, was born in London on 10 June 1834, the son of a Bavarian mother and a naturalized Italian father, a merchant from Trieste. He studied music in Trieste with Luigi Ricci and Aegidius Karl Lickl, then went to Leipzig, where he learned piano with Felix Moscheles and composition with Moritz Hauptmann. In 1855 he settled in London and started practice as a conventional music &#145;professor&#146;, teaching young ladies the piano and accompanying singers. In later life his pupils included Marie Corelli and Sybil Thorndike. He published more than a hundred works for the piano, violin, and cello, and as many songs, duets, trios, and partsongs. &#145;The Band Passes&#146; was a minor success, and, among his educational works, <span class="italic">Pretty Little Pieces for Pretty Little Players</span> drew on melodies from Weber, Verdi, and popular tunes. Other music included a mass and an opera, <span class="italic">Il lazzarone</span>. A youthful friendship with Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins led to his providing incidental music to <span class="italic">The Frozen Deep</span> and <span class="italic">The Light House</span>, entertainments written by Collins and in which Dickens acted; Queen Victoria commanded a private performance of the latter. In 1864 Berger married Annie Lascelles, a contralto whose voice he described as being &#145;rich, mellow and of exceptional compass&#146;, who was admired by the queen and Prince Albert and for whom composers including Balfe, Wallace, and Macfarren wrote songs  (Berger, <span class="italic">97</span>, 97&#150;8). She abandoned her career on her marriage. In 1868 Berger established the &#145;Apr&egrave;s-midis Instrumentales&#146;. From 1885 he taught at the Royal Academy of Music, and later also at the Guildhall School of Music.<br>
<br>There was no reason to expect that Berger's election to the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1859, as member in 1871, as director in 1880, and, crucially, as secretary from 1884 to 1911, would give an entirely new brand of vital leadership to that once distinguished institution. Seventy years after its establishment in 1813, the society was artistically and financially moribund, impervious to a new world of public concerts. Berger found new audiences, subscribers, and alternative sources of income. With legendary displays of obsequiousness he wooed prima donnas and virtuosos including Patti and Paderewski, countering inflated demands for fees (newly transformed by America and international agents) with similarly modern images of tradition and heritage, and offering medals in place of dollars. Attempting to discipline and maintain an orchestra (never possible for long in London), he built attractive programmes from the competing requirements of quality, popularity, and nationalism in an age of live repertory. Taking the society into profit within a decade earned him a modest cheque and testimonial, headed by the lord chief justice, to his &#145;indefatigable and self-denying zeal&#146;. These feats of entrepreneurship, sustained without much faltering for a further twenty years, might have earned lasting fame and fortune in an easier business.<br>
<br>After 1911 Berger subsisted on pittances from teaching and nondescript journalism, presumably reduced by the collapse of the old drawing-room piano culture in which he had his roots. In 1930 he was granted &pound;100 from the civil list &#145;in recognition of his services to music&#146;. He published a tutor, <span class="italic">First Steps at the Pianoforte</span> (1894), and <span class="italic">Musical Expressions, Phrases and Sentences</span> (1921). He also wrote two books of memoirs, <span class="italic">Reminiscences, Impressions and Anecdotes</span> (n.d. [1913?]) and <span class="italic">97</span> (1931). They give a vivid account of London's social musical life in Victorian and Edwardian times, with glimpses of the many musicians, including Wagner and Tchaikovsky, who visited London, and an admiring portrait of Dickens. Berger retained to the end of his long life an alert face with a neat beard and a high forehead, crowned in these last years with a shock of white hair. He died on 25 April 1933, at his home, 38 Hardwicke Road, Palmer's Green, London, at the age of ninety-eight.<br>
