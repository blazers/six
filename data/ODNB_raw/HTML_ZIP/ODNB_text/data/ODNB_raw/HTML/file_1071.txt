<span class="headword">Baillie,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1653), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the son of Sir William Baillie of Lamington, an adherent of Mary, queen of Scots. His mother was a daughter of Sir Alexander Hume, lord provost of Edinburgh, and he was born illegitimate while his father's first wife, Margaret Maxwell, countess of Angus (widow of the sixth earl), was still alive. After her death in 1593 Sir William Baillie married his mistress, but the son was not thereby legitimized, and the estates were inherited by Margaret Baillie, the eldest daughter of the first marriage. In 1641 Baillie was to make an unsuccessful attempt to have the settlement of the Lamington estates reversed in his favour.<br>
<br>In early life, therefore, Baillie became a soldier. He has plausibly been suggested to be the Captain William Baily who went over to the Netherlands in 1625 in the earl of Essex's regiment and under whom the young Sydenham Poyntz served at the attempted relief of Breda. He must already have been a man of some military significance when early in 1629 he went to Sweden to serve under Gustavus Adolphus; his first commission was as lieutenant-colonel of Sir Alexander Hamilton's regiment of recruited infantry. In a &#145;list of Scottish officers that served his majesty of Sweden&#146; at the time of the king's death in 1632, he is styled &#145;William Baily, colonel to a regiment of foote of Dutch&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 3.465). He left Swedish service at the end of 1633, presumably to return to Scotland. By October 1629, when his son and heir James was born, Baillie had married Janet Bruce, daughter of Sir William Bruce of Glenhouse and granddaughter of John Baillie of Letham, Stirlingshire.<br>
<br>Back in Scotland in 1638, Baillie was employed on many important services by the covenanters. In his army commission, ratified by parliament on 11 June 1640, he is designated &#145;William Baillie of Lethem, Stirlingshire&#146;, from the Letham estate which marriage had brought him. Under Alexander Leslie, earl of Leven, he was present with the army which in 1639 encamped on Duns Law, and the following year he took part as a major-general in the incursion into England. As lieutenant-general of foot he also distinguished himself under Leven at Marston Moor, the siege of York, and the capture of Newcastle. At the first he played a prominent role with Major-General Sir James Lumsden in rallying the Scottish foot. As a reward he received command of the Angus (Forfarshire) foot, whose colonel had died from his wounds.<br>
<br>In late November Baillie was appointed to command of an army, with Sir John Urry (or Hurry) as assistant general, intended to check the raids of Montrose and his highlanders in the north of Scotland. In March 1645 he confronted Montrose in Forfarshire. Following the latter's storming of Dundee on 4 April, Baillie mounted a speedy response which could have destroyed the royalist army had his subordinate Urry pursued the plunder-laden enemy aggressively. Despite his failure, Urry became a major-general of foot and horse, but he earned the covenanters a stunning defeat at Auldearn. Through the spring and early summer Baillie devastated royalist lands until he was defeated by Montrose at Alford on 2 July. Having lost a third of his 2000-man army, he retreated to Stirling. Attributing his defeat to the fact that his forces had been unnecessarily weakened by the drawing off of recruits, he resigned his commission; but after receiving from the authorities formal approbation of his conduct, he agreed to continue in command until an effective substitute could be found. The result fully justified his scruples. For the first half of August he protected Fife from Montrose's largest army, 5000 strong. On 15 August the opposing forces again came in sight of each other at Kilsyth. The committee of estates resolved to give battle, a determination so strongly disapproved of by Baillie that he declined to undertake the disposition of the troops, and consented to be present merely that he might lessen the disastrous results of a defeat which he felt to be inevitable. The covenanters lost 3000 men out of an army of 7000, and with that the last army in Scotland to oppose the royalists. So overwhelming was Montrose's victory that Scotland for a time was at his feet.<br>
<br>In a change from his military career, Baillie served as an MP for Lanarkshire in 1645&#150;7 and 1648. For all his undoubted bravery and skill, he seemed fated to be thwarted by the incompetence and blunders of those whom he served. When the Scots, after the engagement with Charles I, resolved on an expedition into England to deliver the &#145;king from the power of sectaries&#146;, Baillie was appointed lieutenant-general of foot and colonel of Walter Scott's foot in the army raised by the duke of Hamilton. In July he argued successfully for the army to march through Lancashire. The loose order kept by the duke rendered the English royalist disaster at Preston on 17 August 1648 a foregone conclusion. In the grounds of Walton House, south of the town, Baillie mustered most of the Scottish infantry in case Cromwell tried to cross the Ribble. That night he led the council of war in deciding on a night march to join the engager cavalry under John Middleton. Baillie rallied his forces near Winwick, 3 miles from Warrington, &#145;maintaining the pass&#146;, according to Cromwell, &#145;with great resolution for many hours&#146;  (Cromwell, 1.637). On receiving an order from the earl of Callendar and Middleton to make as good conditions as he could, Baillie refused to surrender, but only 250 foot followed him to hold the bridge; the remaining men threw down their arms and fled to the moor. In despair, Baillie threatened suicide, before his officers persuaded him to surrender by promising to sign a document exonerating his conduct; he very reluctantly sent in a capitulation to Cromwell, which was accepted.<br>
<br>By 1651 Baillie had returned to Scotland. He satisfied the kirk over his repentance for his part in the engagement in June 1651. He died at Letham in 1653 and was survived by at least two sons. Both James and William (<i>b</i>. 1632) succeeded George Forrester, first Lord Forrester of Corstorphine, owing to that lord's resignation of 1650&#150;51. A contemporary Scottish historian observed of Baillie that he was &#145;a wyse and vallient souldier, expert in militairie affaires, whereof he had given a good proofe, at home and abroad&#146;  (Gordon, 114).<br>
