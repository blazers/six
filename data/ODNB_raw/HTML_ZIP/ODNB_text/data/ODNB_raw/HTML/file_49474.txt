<span class="headword">Murray,  Charles Thomas McKinnon <span class="st"> [Chic]</span></span>  (1919&#150;1985), <span class="occ">comedian and actor</span>, was born on 6 November 1919 at 26 Duncan Street, Greenock, the only surviving child of William Irvine Murray (1879&#150;1933), railway goods checker, and his wife, Isabella Forrest McKinnon (1882&#150;1958). He left school at Greenock in 1934 when he was fifteen and obtained an apprenticeship at Kincaid's marine engineering works. A few years later he formed a musical act with workmates and friends which had a fair amount of local success especially during the war years.<br>
<br>Murray married Maidie Dickson (<i>b</i>. 1922), daughter of Hugh Beaton Dickson, maintenance engineer, and Anne Sinclair, on 28 April 1945. She was an established Scottish variety performer and persuaded Chic to leave his job as a marine engineer to form a comedy/musical double act. On stage Chic at 6 feet 2 inches towered over his partner's petite 5 feet nothing. From the beginning he was determined not to be just another Scottish comic. He was a storyteller, something many audiences were slow to appreciate. Describing in detail apparently mundane activities like going downstairs and leaving the house, he made them seem extraordinary. Standing almost stationary centre stage he spoke to the audience in quiet, deadpan tones without any gestures that might deflect attention from the words. Journalist Jack House described him as &#145;a complete original, who turned familiar words and phrases into something out of this world&#146;  (House, 81).<br>
<br>Signed by the Bernard Delfont agency in 1955 the duo climbed steadily to top billing at the major variety theatres in Britain and on television but Chic was left to go solo when Maidie retired in the early 1960s. Unlike other top comics he failed to secure a regular television series as variety theatres closed and, although still busy, he allowed his career to drift. His links to the Delfont agency loosened and he was looking after his own affairs. Self-management was not his strong point and both his career and his health suffered from lack of proper attention. In 1972 he and his wife divorced.<br>
<br>Chic Murray played cameo roles in a number of films beginning with the spoof James Bond film <span class="italic">Casino Royale</span> (1967). He gained particular praise and welcome favourable publicity as the headmaster in <span class="italic">Gregory's Girl</span> (1981) and the bank manager in the television film drama <span class="italic">Saigon&#151;Year of the Cat</span> (1983). His economical style suited the camera and from a low point his career seemed to be taking off in a new direction. Somehow, perhaps due to ill health as well as ill luck, it never happened. There was one final acting success when in 1984 he played the former Liverpool Football Club manager Bill Shankly in the musical play <span class="italic">You'll Never Walk Alone</span> at the Everyman Theatre, Liverpool. He died on 29 January 1985 at 7 Bruntsfield Crescent, Edinburgh, from a perforated duodenal ulcer. His funeral service was on 1 February at Mortonhall crematorium in the city.<br>
<br>Chic Murray was successful in variety, television, cabaret, film, and on radio and was one of the most impersonated performers in show business, in itself a tribute to his unique talent. He was a major influence on younger comedians such as Billy Connolly who declared him &#145;the funniest man on earth&#146;, the artist who set the standard to which he aspired  (Yule, 269).<br>
