<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mangan,  (James) Clarence</span>  (1803&#150;1849), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born James Mangan on 1 May 1803 at 3 Fishamble Street, Dublin, the second son of the grocers James Mangan (1765&#150;1843), a native of Shanagolden, co. Limerick, and his wife, Catherine Smith (1771&#150;1846), of Fishamble Street, daughter of John Smith of Kiltale, Meath. His father had been a hedge-school teacher before taking over the business of his wife's aunt Mary Farrell in Dublin, but after some years he found himself bankrupt through ill-advised speculations in property. There are many myths surrounding Mangan's early life, mostly created by himself in his unfinished <span class="italic">Autobiography</span> (written in 1848, published in 1960). However, it seems that the family not only endured extreme poverty, but also suffered from James Mangan's ill temper and frustrations. The young James Mangan sought refuge in books and became a loner. He was educated at a Jesuit school in Saul's Court, Dublin, where he learned the rudiments of Latin, Spanish, French, and Italian. He then attended three different schools until the age of fifteen, when he was obliged to obtain employment in order to support his parents, two younger brothers and a sister (the oldest son died in infancy).<br>
<br>For seven years Mangan worked as a scrivener in the Kenrick office at 6 York Street, Dublin. He was skilled at copying documents, but detested the harsh working conditions. At the same time he continued educating himself, reading widely and writing poetry. The poet James Tighe was his friend in the office, and together with Laurence Bligh they wrote riddles and rebus and puzzle poems for William Jones's two Dublin almanacs, <span class="italic">Grants</span> and the <span class="italic">New Ladies'</span>, calling themselves the &#145;diarians&#146;. The first of Mangan's ephemeral poems was published in 1818. In 1826 his first nationalist poem was published in the <span class="italic">New Ladies' Almanac</span> as an enigma; it was later renamed &#145;To my Native Land&#146;.<br>
<br>Mangan was not the friendless person he later claimed to have been, but his severe mood swings made him feel constantly alienated from other people. He also suffered from hypochondria and the fear that he would become insane. It is possible that he started to drink heavily and became addicted to alcohol and opium or laudanum early in life.<br>
<br>Nine months after his apprenticeship ended, in winter 1825&#150;6, he found employment in a solicitor's office, Matthew Frank, at 28 Merrion Square North, Dublin, where his fellow clerks ridiculed him because of his eccentric behaviour. He became increasingly unhappy, withdrawing from his old friends and feeling suicidal.<br>
<br>Mangan never married, but he was infatuated or in love with a number of women including Catherine Hayes, whom he taught German. He was also madly in love with an auburn-haired woman called Frances, who did not reciprocate. In winter 1829&#150;30, he suffered again from unrequited love: the object of his desire has never been identified although Yeats speculated erroneously that it was Margaret Stackpole. The affair threw him into a long period of deep depression, and Mangan's early biographers believed that he was so disappointed that he never loved again. But his addictions and isolation seem to be more likely reasons why he never married: he did propose to Margaret Stackpole in 1834 but she declined. They remained friends. Nevertheless he was so ill in 1829&#150;30 that his brother John replaced him in the office. He found employment in the office of a solicitor, Thomas Leland, at 6 Fitzwilliam Square West, where he may have worked from 1830 to 1838. It seems that he was not unhappy there.<br>
<br>Mangan's first political involvement with the Irish nationalist movement dated from a repeal meeting of the law clerks of Dublin in 1830. In 1830&#150;31 he became a member of the Comet Club, an anti-tithe organization, originally composed of twelve liberal protestant and Catholic men of fashion, and from 1832&#150;3 he contributed humorous verse to their journal, <span class="italic">The Comet</span>, generally over the signature of &#145;Clarence&#146;, which he had previously adopted as his middle name. Mangan's biographers debate whether this name refers to the duke of Clarence in Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Richard III</span>, to Clarence Harvey in Maria Edgeworth's <span class="italic">Belinda</span>, or to both. From then on he was always known as (James) Clarence Mangan.<br>
<br>In 1830 Mangan published his first German translations in <span class="italic">The Friend</span>. He had mastered German in order to read German philosophy, and also worked as a tutor of German. His German was excellent, and he may have visited Germany in 1828&#150;9. If he did, this was the only time in his life when he left Dublin (although he is also rumoured once to have visited Liverpool). In 1834 his first contribution to the <span class="italic">Dublin University Magazine</span> appeared, and hundreds of poems and prose pieces followed in the same periodical, the majority being translations of German poetry. However, these were often &#145;transformations&#146; rather than literal translations. Mangan departed radically from the original, changing the poem into what he believed it was meant to be. Some of the &#145;translations&#146; were far superior to the original, and a considerable number of them were his own poetry and had no German original at all. After 1836 he mainly published in the <span class="italic">Dublin University Magazine</span>. He also wrote for the <span class="italic">Dublin Monthly Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">Dublin Penny Journal</span> (1832&#150;4), and the <span class="italic">Dublin Satirist</span> (1833&#150;6); the latter published some of his more serious poetry.<br>
<br>Mangan's poetry is characterized by inventive word play, challenging rhyme, schemes, an emphasis on the ridiculous and grotesque, and Gothic and Romantic imagery. However, Dublin born and bred, Mangan was at the same time a true urban poet, using hardly any images from nature. One of his favourite figures was the lonely spectre, a lost soul, cursed to wander without hope as a punishment for his sins. He was also interested in masks and dubious identities. Because he experimented with verse techniques, was fascinated by extreme psychological distress, and was able to give frighteningly accurate descriptions of states of anxiety, he has sometimes been compared to his American contemporary Edgar Allan Poe.<br>
<br>In 1836 Mangan became acquainted with Charles Gavan Duffy. When he started editing the <span class="italic">Belfast Vindicator</span> in 1839 Mangan published some characteristically humorous pieces in it, using the signature of the &#145;Man in the Cloak&#146;. A year later he began work on Middle Eastern poetry (Turkish, Persian, and Arabic), the <span class="italic">literae orientales</span>, in the <span class="italic">Dublin University Magazine</span>. However, he worked from other people's translations, since he was ignorant of those languages. In the same year John O'Donovan employed Mangan to make the printer's copy of the English translation of the <span class="italic">Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland by the Four Masters</span>. He had become a full-time employee of the Ordnance Survey in the summer of 1838, serving as a copyist under George Petrie, John O'Donovan, and Eugene O'Curry. All three had been involved in copying Irish manuscripts, and this acquaintance encouraged Mangan to investigate Irish documents and translate Irish poetry. However, since his Irish was not fluent enough, he relied on prose translations made for him by O'Curry, O'Donovan, and John O'Daly, which he then put into poetry. His first translation from the Irish appeared in George Petrie's <span class="italic">Irish Penny Journal</span> in 1840. Mangan worked at the Ordnance Survey until 1841, but his work was interrupted by fits of heavy drinking. At that time he was described as physically worn out and prematurely aged, wearing a huge pair of green spectacles for his weak eyes.<br>
<br>In 1842, on the request of Petrie, Dr James Henthorn Todd, fellow of Trinity College and librarian, employed Mangan as a library clerk for the work on the new library catalogue. He worked there full-time from 1842 to 1844, and then part-time until the end of 1846. John Mitchel remembered the first time he saw Mangan there in 1845:<blockquote>an acquaintance pointed out to me a man perched on the top of a ladder, with the whispered information that the figure was Clarence Mangan. It was an unearthly and ghostly figure in a brown garment; the same garment (to all appearance) which lasted till the day of his death. The blanched hair was totally unkempt; the corpse-like features still as marble; a large book was in his arms, and all his soul was in the book. (Mitchel, introduction to <span class="italic">Poems</span>, xxxv)</blockquote>When <span class="italic">The Nation</span> was started in 1842, with Duffy as editor, Mangan wrote the poem &#145;The Nation's First Number&#146;. Duffy gave him for a time a fixed salary, but already in November 1842, tensions between the two men arose over the authorship of the poem &#145;Fag an Bealach&#146;. Deeply hurt, Mangan withdrew from the paper, and only after 1845 wrote more regularly for it, contributing patriotic verse and translations from German, Irish, French, and Spanish poetry in a column entitled &#145;Echoes of Foreign Song&#146;. Mangan adopted various signatures in <span class="italic">The Nation</span>&#151;&#145;Terrae Filius&#146;, &#145;Vacuus&#146;, &#145;a Yankee&#146;, &#145;Monos&#146;, &#145;Mark Anthony&#146;, &#145;Hi-Hum&#146;, &#145;the Mourne-r&#146;, &#145;Lageniensis&#146;, and &#145;J. C. M.&#146;&#151;making it hard to attribute all his poems to him. He also supplemented his scanty income by working on a translation by his friend Owen Connellan, <span class="italic">Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland by the Four Masters</span>, for six months in 1844&#150;5. In 1845 Duffy financed Mangan's <span class="italic">Anthologia Germanica</span>, a collection of previously published translations of German poetry. This was the only collection of his poetry published in his lifetime. From summer 1845&#150;6 Mangan started writing for the staunch unionist <span class="italic">Irish Monthly Magazine</span>. This stood in contrast to his nationalist views, but he needed money desperately. He was no longer in full employment, and after the death of his father in 1843 he was the sole carer of his ailing mother, and also had to support his unemployed younger brother William.<br>
<br>Mangan is often seen as a rather unpolitical writer. However, he had a deep love for Ireland, and in 1846, disgusted by the famine, he fully committed himself to the nationalist cause, writing forceful patriotic poetry in <span class="italic">The Nation</span>, such as &#145;Dark Rosaleen (Ro&iacute;s&iacute;n Dubh)&#146;, &#145;A Vision of Connaught in the Thirteenth Century&#146;, and &#145;A Warning Voice&#146;. These poems gave him the recognition in Ireland he had not had before. By 1847 he was so poor that his friends collected money for him. His health declined further as his drinking grew worse. He started writing for the publisher James Duffy's <span class="italic">Irish Catholic Magazine</span> (1847), but the money he made from his poetry was not enough to feed him and his brother. When Duffy turned down his application for membership to the council of the Irish Confederation in February 1847, because he was not respectable enough, he was deeply hurt and again ceased writing for <span class="italic">The Nation</span> for some months.<br>
<br>When differences arose between Duffy and Mitchel, over Young Ireland policy, and Mitchel left <span class="italic">The Nation</span>, Mangan followed him and wrote for his radical revolutionary paper the <span class="italic">United Irishman</span> in 1848: Mangan's political views were closer to Mitchel's revolutionary Romanticism than Duffy's pragmatism. In a letter to Mitchel in 1848 he stated: &#145;Insignificant an individual as I am &hellip; I thoroughly sympathise with your sentiments, that I identify my views of public affairs with yours, and that I am prepared to go all lengths with you &hellip; Yours, in life and death&#146;  (Mitchel, introduction to <span class="italic">Poems</span>, ed. O'Donoghue, xxxvii). Mitchel, unlike Duffy, was very understanding of Mangan's depression and addictions. But he recognized the &#145;two Mangans&#146;: &#145;one well known to the Muses, the other to the police; one soared through the empyrean and sought the stars&#151;the other lay too often in gutters of Peter Street and Bride Street&#146;  (ibid., xxxv). After Mitchel's transportation Mangan wrote for the <span class="italic">Irish Tribune</span> (1848), edited by Richard Dalton Williams and Kevin Izod O'Doherty, and for <span class="italic">The Irishman</span> (1849), edited by Joseph Brenan, both radical papers which were quickly prohibited.<br>
<br>In May 1848 poverty and alcoholism led to Mangan's admission to St Vincent's Hospital. After he discharged himself prematurely in June 1848, he fell into the freshly sunk foundation of a house while drunk at night, and was taken to Richmond Surgical Hospital badly injured. Early in 1849 <span class="italic">The Pilot</span> carried an appeal by &#145;Honestus&#146;, describing Mangan's destitution and asking for donations. By that stage he either lived in shabby lodgings, or was homeless, and wrote his poetry, on a regular basis, in &#145;low public-houses&#146;, where he got pens and ink for free. He caught cholera in the epidemic that raged in Dublin in 1849, and in May spent some time in the cholera sheds of Kilmainham. Again, he discharged himself too early, and when his condition worsened he was taken to Meath Hospital, Long Lane, Dublin, where he died on 20 June 1849. It seems that the primary cause of his death was long-term malnutrition. He was buried on 23 June 1849 in the family plot at Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin. Because of the cholera epidemic in Dublin and the imprisonment of many of his friends, only five people attended the funeral. Allegedly, a volume of German poetry, which he had been translating, was found in his pocket, and loose papers were found in his hat. However, it seemed that some of the papers he wrote in hospital were burnt by an over-efficient nurse. A portrait of the dead Mangan was executed by F. W. Burton, and is in the National Gallery, Dublin.<br>
<br>James Clarence Mangan played a major part in establishing a distinctively Irish literature in English in the nineteenth century, but his input has often been overlooked for various reasons. A great number of Mangan's writings were published anonymously or under pseudonyms in obscure and short-lived magazines, and were very hard to trace. He also fell victim to his reputation as a poor and pathetic poet, which prevented his poems from being taken seriously. Often the focus was on his well-known patriotic songs, such as &#145;Dark Rosaleen&#146;, and his works were analysed primarily under a nationalist aspect. Furthermore, he has sometimes been seen simply as a translator and not as an original poet.<br>
<br>A collection of Mangan's poems, edited by John Mitchel, was published in 1859 with a biographical preface. A centenary edition of Mangan's poems and prose was issued by D. J. O'Donoghue in 1903&#150;4, anticipating a renewed interest in him. Yeats called him &#145;our one poet raised to the first rank by intensity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Uncollected Prose of W. B. Yeats</span>, ed. J. P. Frayne, 1, 1970), and for Joyce he was &#145;the failed standard-bearer of a failed nation&#146;, but &#145;one of the world's most inspired poets&#146;  (<span class="italic">James Joyce: the Critical Writings</span>, ed. E. Mason and R. Ellmann, 1964). But despite Yeats's and Joyce's interest a proper reassessment of Mangan has not taken place. <span class="italic">The Collected Works of James Clarence Mangan</span> edited by Jacques Chuto, Rudolf Patrick Holzapfel, and Ellen Shannon-Mangan (4 vols., 1997) is the first systematic collection of Mangan's works.<br>
