</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Herbert,  John Rogers</span>  (1810&#150;1890), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 23 January 1810 in Maldon, Essex, the son of a controller of customs. Little is known about his early life. In 1826 he went to London, sent by his family, to train as an artist in the Royal Academy Schools, which he entered on 15 December. But after nearly two years, in 1828, upon the death of his father, he abandoned his course of study and took up paid work, specifically portraiture and book illustration. While living at an address in York Place, near Portman Square, he first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1830 with <span class="italic">Portrait of a Country Boy</span>, presumably a &#145;fancy picture&#146;. He exhibited further portraits at the academy over the next few years, and small-scale subject paintings at the British Institution. Herbert's first recorded portrait, of a Scottish family in 1831, indicates conventional beginnings in the manner of Sir Thomas Lawrence. In 1834 he drew Princess Victoria. On 19 March 1833, at St George's, Hanover Square, he married Kezia Mary Dedman (1809/10&#150;1890), daughter of a shoemaker of Great Tey, Essex. <a href="#cosubject_13018">Arthur John [<i>see below</i>]</a>, probably their first child, became an artist.<br>
<br>In the late 1830s Herbert's illustrative work on a small scale gave him a penchant for illustrating Romantic literature, with exotic, Eastern, and Italian settings; two such works derived from the poetry of Byron. Italian subjects became his speciality, as in his landmark work, <span class="italic">The Brides of Venice</span> (exh. RA, 1839, and at Liverpool, where it won a prize of &pound;50). This large painting nearly 7 feet across (version, ex Sothebys, London, 17 June 1992), set in the early sixteenth century, caught the fashion for Italianate scenes, as did Herbert's vivid set of illustrations (mostly executed in 1840) for Thomas Roscoe's <span class="italic">Legends of Venice</span> (1841). It is uncertain whether he travelled to Italy in the mid-1830s, but for a young husband and father this seems unlikely. Nevertheless, the imminent change in Herbert's style at this time suggests the influence of the Nazarenes, who worked in Rome.<br>
<br>Herbert's personal life and career changed direction as he was drawn to Roman Catholicism; at the same time he developed a close friendship with Augustus Welby Pugin. The actual date of Herbert's conversion is not known; most sources indicate that it took place in 1836 when he was twenty-six. By 1838 he had already contributed to Pugin's decorative scheme for the chapel of St Mary's College, Oscott, near Birmingham, by painting the figures on the reredos. Herbert's obsession with religion is evident in his art from 1840 onwards when he exhibited <span class="italic">The monastery in the fourteenth century: boar-hunters refreshed at St Augustine's monastery, Canterbury</span> (Forbes Magazine collection, New York). The painting evoked pre-Reformation England, still wholly Catholic, with the church as benevolent provider for all. The focus on St Augustine's monastery, a holy place of pilgrimage that had fallen into ruins, illustrates Herbert's adoption of the beliefs of his friend Pugin, whose book <span class="italic">Contrasts</span> defends the beauty and nobility of medieval architecture.<br>
<br>By November 1841 Herbert had been elected an associate member of the Royal Academy; his <span class="italic">Pirates of Istria Bearing off the Brides of Venice</span> (exh. RA, 1841) marked the culmination of his interest in Italian subjects. He became master of the figure in the newly formed Government School of Design at Somerset House, where his students included Walter Howell Deverell, who later became a Pre-Raphaelite painter. Herbert set up home at 1 Gloucester Road, Old Brompton, London, with his growing family; he had at least five children by 1847.<br>
<br>Herbert continued to paint religious subjects; <span class="italic">The First Introduction of Christianity into Britain</span> (exh. RA, 1842; ex Sothebys, London, 29 March 1995) celebrates the conversion of native Britons against the backdrop of Stonehenge, a pagan site. With a new and more serious attitude, he wrote in 1845, &#145;thank God the age of splash and dash is nearly over&#146;  (Hamlyn, 47&#150;8). The new style of his work, lighter in tone and clearer in outline, set Herbert apart from many of his artist contemporaries such as Benjamin Robert Haydon, who considered that his art was &#145;German and affected&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, ed. Pope, Nov 1845). He continued to depict religious themes in <span class="italic">Sir Thomas More and his Daughter</span> (exh. RA, 1844; Tate collection), <span class="italic">The Trial of the Seven Bishops</span> (exh. RA, 1844), and <span class="italic">Our Saviour Subject to his Parents at Nazareth</span> (exh. RA, 1847; Guildhall Art Gallery, London). Such works attracted critical praise, and in February 1846 he was elected Royal Academician, submitting as his diploma work <span class="italic">St. Gregory the Great Teaching the Roman Boys to Sing the Chant</span> (exh. RA, 1845; RA). Herbert's appearance in these years reinforced his serious view of himself and his art: C. R. Leslie noted his &#145;hair, red, long and very smoothly brushed straight down. [He had] a mediaeval look both in appearance and dress&#146;  (Leslie, 176).<br>
<br>Herbert's impressive portrait of Cardinal Wiseman (exh. RA, 1842; St Mary's College, Oscott) indicates the high Catholic circles in which he moved, which also included Lady Herbert of Lea, wife of Sidney Herbert (no relation). He painted A. W. N. Pugin's portrait in a Holbeinesque style (1845; Palace of Westminster, London). With his family Herbert regularly visited Pugin's home, The Grange, Ramsgate, in Kent, during the creation and building of the designer's great work, the new Palace of Westminster. Pugin's early death in 1852 was a blow to Herbert.<br>
<br>The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood looked to Herbert as an example. He supported its journal <span class="italic">The Germ</span> when it was founded in 1849, but William Michael Rossetti did not feel that the younger artists could go much further in enlisting his approval since, as he wrote to F. G. Stephens, in effect they were trying to &#145;out-Herbert Herbert&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Letters</span>, 6). Herbert advocated painting in the open air, a central tenet of Pre-Raphaelitism. Indeed the older artist's curious monogram, which incorporated a cross, may also indicate an influence on the Pre-Raphaelites' famous monogram PRB. A family connection seems to have existed, through marriage, with James Collinson, a Pre-Raphaelite painter.<br>
<br>In 1846 Herbert was commissioned to paint frescoes in the new houses of parliament, even though he had submitted only one entry to the competitions in 1844&#151;an entry which had been disqualified because too late for consideration. But Herbert's connection with William Dyce, head of the Government School of Design, and his friendship with Pugin ensured his participation in this important scheme. Originally commissioned to paint nine <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> subjects illustrating Human Justice in the peers' robing room, he eventually produced a massive painting, <span class="italic">Moses' Descent from Mount Sinai</span> (completed 1864; House of Lords), which took fourteen years to complete, and <span class="italic">Lear Disinheriting Cordelia</span> (now fully restored), for the upper waiting hall, called the Poets' Hall. For all the artists involved fresco proved a difficult medium; Herbert eventually turned to the water-glass technique for <span class="italic">Moses</span>, for which he spent much time researching details of costume as well as technique.<br>
<br>Herbert received &pound;5000 for his houses of parliament work, thanks to his own hard bargaining. By this time he had left the School of Design, since he did not find favour with Henry Cole, director from 1857 of the South Kensington Schools of Art, the successor to the Government School of Design. Yet his fortunes improved, as indicated by a move to Church Row, Hampstead. In 1853 and/or 1854 he travelled to France, where he painted a portrait of the eminent artist Horace Vernet (exh. RA, 1855) and exhibited in Paris at the Universal Exhibition in 1855. He became a corresponding member of the Institut de France (Acad&eacute;mie des Beaux Arts) in 1869. He &#145;developed the odd habit of speaking English with a strong French accent&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 20 March 1890, 10), a report that reveals his distinctly eccentric personality. He was, however, a committed family man and painted a portrait of his two young daughters in 1851 (on loan to the Tate). After studying with his father and in the Royal Academy Schools, exhibiting two well-received historical scenes, his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_13018"></a><span class="headword">Arthur John Herbert</span>  (1834&#150;1856)<span class="occ"></span>, baptized on 28 June 1837, died on 18 September 1856, aged twenty-two after falling ill with typhoid fever at Mauriac, in the Auvergne.<br>
<br>During the 1850s Herbert became well acquainted with W. E. Gladstone, who greatly respected the artist for his strength of character, commenting, &#145;What a lofty spirit&#146; on hearing how Herbert destroyed most of his fresco of <span class="italic">Moses</span> in 1861 when the technique had failed  (Gladstone, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 6.26). Herbert exhibited a portrait of Gladstone in 1883. His religious art also attracted the attention of the royal family; Queen Victoria visited his studio in 1858 and, impressed with his work on <span class="italic">Moses</span>, commissioned <span class="italic">The Virgin's Flight into Hill Country</span> (exh. RA, 1860; later given to Princess Louise; ex Sothebys, 16 April 1986, lot 216), in which the landscape (as in his other religious works) was based on Herbert's alleged travels to Egypt and Mount Sinai in 1856 or 1857.<br>
<br>Herbert moved to Grove End Place in St John's Wood in 1856 and remained there until 1869; here he formed a close friendship with Sir Edwin Landseer, his neighbour and billiards partner. <span class="italic">Laborare est orare</span> (exh. RA, 1862; Tate collection) varied the pattern of his work with a splendid landscape of the area around St Bernard's Abbey, Leicestershire, the monastery for which it was painted, in which Herbert included himself in the foreground. C. R. Leslie noted that he was a confirmed smoker who &#145;stated that he could not work well without a cigar in his mouth&#146;  (Leslie, 176), so the Royal Academy council had to allow him to smoke on varnishing day, with the result that Herbert generally found himself positioned near a window for ventilation and therefore a good light for his paintings. His academic reputation withstood such eccentricity, and in 1865 he even received two votes in the ballot for the election of president of the Royal Academy. In 1869 he moved with his family to his newly built London residence, The Chimes, West End Lane, in Kilburn, designed by Pugin's son Edward.<br>
<br>Herbert's later style hardened, and his subject matter proved unremittingly serious. By the 1860s he appeared old-fashioned to a younger generation; in testifying at the commission into the Royal Academy, in 1863, he denounced the use of the female nude model at the academy's life school. He also took advantage of his position as Royal Academician, always sending in the full complement of paintings, and insisting that they be exhibited &#145;on the line&#146;. In his later years his distinctive appearance, &#145;his short, sturdy figure, with his olive complexion, white beard, and steely, piercing eyes&#146; seemed to reflect his fierce religious convictions  (<span class="italic">Magazine of Art</span>, April 1890, xxviii). He staged his own exhibition at the Hanover Gallery in New Bond Street, London, in 1881 to mixed reactions. Of his other sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13019/', "Cyril Wiseman Herbert")</script>, a painter, died, aged thirty-four, in 1882, shortly after receiving an appointment as curator of sculpture at the Royal Academy; Wilfrid Vincent Herbert, also an artist, painted his father's portrait (exh. RA, 1881). By 1886 Herbert had retired as an active member of the Royal Academy, his poor eyesight having long adversely affected his art. He died at his home, The Chimes, on 17 March 1890, a month after his wife's death. Both were interred (Herbert on 22 March) in the upper catacombs of Kensal Green Roman Catholic cemetery, London. The lack of a substantial posthumous biography has hindered a full assessment of Herbert's career, leaving many gaps regarding his life and work.<br>
