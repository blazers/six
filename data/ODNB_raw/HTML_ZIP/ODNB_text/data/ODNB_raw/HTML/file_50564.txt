<span class="headword">Howden,  James</span>  (1832&#150;1913), <span class="occ">marine and general engineer</span>, was born on 29 February 1832 in Prestonpans, East Lothian, the son of James Howden and his wife, Catherine Adams. His father was a market gardener and his early schooling was received in Prestonpans parish school. In 1847 he made his way to Glasgow by boat, on the Forth and Clyde Canal. Whether he chose the boat over the train for reasons of preference or of economy is not certain but it soon became clear that his lifelong career interest was to be in boats rather than trains.<br>
<br>On arrival in Glasgow, Howden took up an engineering apprenticeship with James Gray &amp; Co.&#151;a firm with an established reputation for stationary engines. His talents for technical drawing were considerable and even before his formal apprenticeship was concluded he was promoted to the position of chief draughtsman. This did not satisfy a man of his ambitions, and almost as soon as his apprenticeship was completed he sought alternative employment, before setting up on his own account in 1854, aged only twenty-two, as a consulting engineer and designer. He had already taken out a patent for rivet making and had sold the rights to a Birmingham company. Nevertheless his early career was not a great success and he had to supplement his income by teaching mechanical drawing in the Glasgow School of Art.<br>
<br>Howden's first major contract came in 1859 from Hendersons for the Anchor Line's ship <i>Ailsa Craig</i>. The order was for compound engines and water tube boilers, of Howden's own design, using steam at 100 lb pressure. This was a considerable advance on existing technology. Although he did not win every race to invent new technologies it is clear that Howden's inventive genius placed him in the forefront of several developments which were to establish Clydeside's reputation as a world leader in shipbuilding and related activities.<br>
<br>In 1862, in partnership with James Mathie, Howden purchased land at Scotland Street on the south side of Glasgow, and established the firm of James Howden &amp; Co. to manufacture engines and boilers. Shipbuilding was later added to the firm's activities, although the work of hull building was contracted out. A shortage of working capital presented problems but it did not ultimately inhibit the long-term growth of the firm. This success was undoubtedly due to Howden's growing list of patent rights, which cover almost the whole field of engineering and boilermaking. Although he spent a great deal of his time at the drawing board and in experimentation, Howden did not neglect the all-important sales dimension of his business; and he established a wide network of acquaintances in the Glasgow business community. He soon numbered many of the world's leading shipping lines among his customers.<br>
<br>The invention for which Howden is best remembered, and which added so much to his fortune, was the forced-draught system for boilers. He had begun to experiment with this in 1862 but it was not until the 1880s that he perfected it by utilizing waste gases to heat the air used in the combustion chamber. The effect of this was to provide a more efficient combustion process at varying speeds, using any quality of steam coal. The resulting improvements in efficiency and cost reduction were considerable. The system was soon in widespread use and the company's energies were devoted almost entirely to its promotion. Howden himself devoted much of his time to establishing connections with shipbuilders and shipowners of note in most parts of the world. Several ships equipped with the forced-draught system in their boilers subsequently won the Blue Riband for the fastest Atlantic crossing.<br>
<br>Howden was fully aware of the dangers of relying too much on one product, and despite the success of the forced-draught system he continued to design new engines. By 1900 his company was busy making high-speed engines of the enclosed, forced-lubrication type, which were used chiefly for generating electricity. This was followed by the Howden Zoelly impulse type of steam turbine, which the firm supplied to many municipalities, including an installation for the corporation of Manchester. Not only was this a new technology for Howden but it also involved a new marketing strategy in selling to local authorities throughout the country. At the time of Howden's death in 1913 his company was busy experimenting with land-based applications for the forced-draught system and with diesel engines, which were to revolutionize the shipping industry in the inter-war years.<br>
<br>Howden's restless spirit did not always produce marketable products, however. In 1904 he became involved with another large Glasgow company, James Finlay &amp; Co., in a process for curing tea. In the early stages of development Howden recruited a scientist from Glasgow University and set him up in a laboratory, but despite the best efforts of the men of science and business, the process could not be turned into a commercial success. Another of his business interests was a marble quarry in Greece, for which he used his business contacts to raise capital. In 1912 he raised capital among his friends for the St Helena Whaling Company. In 1912 he was involved in secret work for the Admiralty, for whom he made a recoilless gun using a non-explosive (pneumatic) propellant. He had the vision to see how useful this type of gun would be on aeroplanes, but the experiment was not a success.<br>
<br>Howden was a public figure and participated vigorously in debates in the various professional bodies of which he was a member. These included the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland, the Institution of Naval Architects, and the Institution of Civil Engineers, to whose journals he contributed many articles. An active churchman, Howden was a member of the kirk session of Wellington United Free Church. He also contributed largely, but privately, to various charitable and religious causes including Barnardo's Homes, missionary activities, and Indian orphans. A member of the Merchants' House of Glasgow and of the Incorporation of Hammermen, Howden was also a JP for the city of Glasgow. His political convictions were with the Liberal Party until Gladstone introduced the <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span>, whereupon he became a Unionist, but he did not take any active public part in politics. He was married first to Helen Burgess Adams, and then to Allison Moffat Hay, with whom he had two sons and a daughter. Both of his wives predeceased him. His principal residence was at 2 Princes Terrace, Dowanhill, Glasgow.<br>
<br>Howden was one of that enterprising group of engineers whose inventive genius and flair for business transformed the Scottish economy in the second half of the nineteenth century. Tenacious and outspoken in his views, Howden spent his working life in Glasgow, where he died on 21 November 1913.<br>
