<span class="headword">Guinness,  Henry Grattan</span>  (1835&#150;1910), <span class="occ">evangelist and trainer of missionaries</span>, was born on 11 August 1835 at Montpelier House, near Kingstown, Ireland, the eldest son in the family of one daughter and three sons of John Grattan Guinness (1783&#150;1850), captain in the army, who saw service in India; his mother was Jane Lucretia, daughter of William Cramer (an accomplished violinist and composer, and son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6591/', "Johann Baptist Cramer")</script>, musical composer), and also the widow of Captain J. N. D'Esterre, who was killed by Daniel O'Connell in a duel in February 1815. Henry's grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61601/', "Arthur Guinness (1768&#150;1855)")</script> of Beaumont, co. Dublin, established the first Sunday school in Ireland, in Dublin in 1786. During their father's lifetime the family lived variously at Dublin, Liverpool, Clifton, and Cheltenham. After education at private schools at Clevedon and Exeter, Guinness at the age of seventeen went to sea, and travelled to Mexico and the West Indies.<br>
<br>After returning to England in March 1854 Guinness experienced an evangelical conversion. In January 1856 he entered New College, St John's Wood, London, to train for the Congregational ministry; he did not complete his course. While at New College he supplied the pulpit for three months at Moorfields Tabernacle, with such success that he was invited to become the pastor. Guinness declined, but was instead &#145;ordained&#146; at the tabernacle on 29 July 1857 to the work of an itinerant interdenominational evangelist. To this work Guinness now devoted his life at home and abroad, and there followed preaching tours on the continent in January 1858, in Ireland in 1858 and 1859, and in America from November 1859 to May 1860.<br>
<br>On 2 October 1860, at the Friends' meeting-house in Princes Street, Bath, Guinness married Fanny Emma [<a name="cosubject_54189"></a><span class="headword">Fanny Emma Guinness</span>  (1831&#150;1898)<span class="occ"></span>], third child of Major Edward Marlborough Fitzgerald and Mabel Stopford, daughter of Admiral Sir Robert Stopford (1768&#150;1847). Since the age of eight Fanny Fitzgerald had been brought up by a pious Quaker couple, Arthur and Mary West, who were members of the Tottenham meeting of the Society of Friends. The Wests, along with other members of the Tottenham meeting, became associated with the early Christian (Plymouth) Brethren movement, and as a result Fanny acquired strong links with the Brethren, though remaining formally affiliated to the Society of Friends at the time of her marriage. Through her Brethren acquaintances Henry Grattan Guinness was introduced to the Brethren movement, and he acquired from the Brethren a fascination with the topic of biblical prophecy which remained with him for the rest of his life. The Guinnesses moved widely in Brethren circles throughout their marriage, though Guinness never wholly severed his connections with the Congregationalists and in his final years worshipped regularly in the Church of England.<br>
<br>After their marriage the Guinnesses travelled continuously for twelve years. They visited Canada in 1861 and Egypt and Palestine in 1862. Guinness then held a short pastorate at Liverpool, and afterwards worked in Ireland. Towards the close of 1865 he took a house at 31 Baggot Street, Dublin, with a view to forming a training home for evangelists and missionaries. In 1866 he also conducted in Dublin the Merrion Hall Mission, and there he had an important influence on the young Thomas John Barnardo (1845&#150;1905). In 1867 the Guinnesses left Dublin for Bath. Work in France occupied much of their time from 1868 to 1872. In 1873 Guinness founded the East London Institute for Home and Foreign Missions, for the training of young men and women for home and foreign missionary work. He directed the institute until his death, and his wife Fanny served as secretary, and was responsible for the budget. The institute was first located at 29 Stepney Green, and subsequently at Harley House, Bow. Barnardo was a co-director. In its first year there were thirty-two students, and after three years other branches were formed in London, and one was installed at Cliff College, Curbar, Derbyshire. Accommodation was provided for 100 men and women; over 1400 men and women were trained in the period up to 1914, when the institute closed.<br>
<br>With the opening up of the Congo and the publication of H. M. Stanley's letters at the end of 1877, Guinness and his wife resolved to concentrate on foreign missions. A monthly magazine, <span class="italic">The Regions Beyond</span>, edited by Fanny Guinness, was started in 1878. Through the initiative of Alfred Tilly of Cardiff, the Livingstone Inland Mission was formed in the Congo in 1878, and in 1880 it became a branch of the institute, with the Guinnesses as director and secretary. It was transferred to the control of the American Baptist Missionary Union in 1884. A new mission to the interior of Africa, the Congo Balolo Mission, was founded in 1889, and others followed in South America&#151;in Peru in 1897, and Argentina in 1899. The organizations were combined in 1899 to form the Regions Beyond Missionary Union, an interdenominational body whose activities were further extended to India by the formation of the Bihar mission in the Bengal presidency in 1901.<br>
<br>Although Guinness did not himself visit central Africa, he travelled in the interest of his missions to Algeria in 1879, to America in 1889 (where he inspired the creation in Boston and Minneapolis of training institutions similar to his own), to India and Burma in November 1896, and to China and Japan in 1897. A visit to Egypt in 1899&#150;1900 led indirectly to the formation in 1904 of the Sudan United Mission, as a result of the marriage in Cairo in February 1900 of the Guinnesses' second daughter, Lucy Evangeline (1865&#150;1906), to the German missionary pioneer Karl Kumm (1874&#150;1930). The Guinnesses had five daughters, of whom three died in infancy, and two sons. All the surviving children engaged in their parents' missionary efforts. The elder son, Dr Harry Grattan Guinness (1861&#150;1915), also became a director of the mission at Harley House, and took a prominent part in the agitation against the Belgian rubber atrocities in the Congo. The eldest daughter, Mary Geraldine (1862&#150;1949), later became celebrated with her husband, Dr Howard Taylor, as the biographer of James Hudson Taylor (1832&#150;1905), founder of the China Inland Mission. Lucy edited <span class="italic">The Regions Beyond</span> for several years after her mother's death in 1898; she also published books on South America and India, and was a writer of religious verse. Her father published a memoir of her in 1907. The younger son, Gershom Whitfield (1869&#150;1927), became a missionary doctor in Henan with the China Inland Mission.<br>
<br>Henry and Fanny Guinness jointly published several works on biblical prophecy. The most important, <span class="italic">The Approaching End of the Age in the Light of History, Prophecy, and Science</span>, first published in 1878, went through fourteen editions by 1918. Both also published works as individual authors, of which the best known were Fanny Guinness's <span class="italic">The First Christian Mission on the Congo</span>, which appeared about 1880, and <span class="italic">The New World of Central Africa</span> (1890). For the last seven years of her life Fanny Guinness was paralysed; she died at Cliff College, Curbar, Derbyshire, on 3 November 1898, and was buried in Baslow churchyard.<br>
<br>On 7 July 1903, Henry Grattan Guinness married Grace Alexandra, hospital nurse, youngest of the seven children of Charles Russell Hurditch, a leading figure among the Christian Brethren. She was forty years his junior. After their wedding Guinness took his young bride on a five-year world tour, which included visits to Switzerland (1903), America and Canada (1904), Japan and China (1905), and Australia and New Zealand (1906). He concluded the tour with a visit to South Africa, where he preached to racially mixed congregations. It was 1908 before they returned to England. They had two sons, John Christopher and Paul Grattan.<br>
<br>Henry Grattan Guinness received an honorary DD degree from Brown University, Providence, USA, in 1889. He was also elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in recognition of his astronomical work, which was sparked off by his interest in prophecy. He spent his last two years in Bath, where he died at his home, Lynton Lodge, Oldfield Park, of pleurisy and pericarditis on 21 June 1910. He was buried in the cemetery at Bath Abbey, survived by his second wife.<br>
