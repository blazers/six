<span class="headword">Ashford,  William</span>  (1746&#150;1824), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born in Birmingham and baptized at St Martin's parish church on 20 May 1746, the son of Richard Ashford, but made his career in Ireland. Ashford's family must have been of reasonable social standing as when he was eighteen in 1764 he went, according to Thomas Mulvany and James Gandon the younger, to Dublin as the &#145;favoured prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Mr [Ralph] Ward, then at the head of the Ordnance Department in Dublin&#146;  (Gandon and Mulvany, 141). Ward himself had been appointed in 1763 through the patronage of the earl of Kildare, later duke of Leinster who was master of the ordnance. Ashford was paid &pound;40 per annum as clerk to the controller of the laboratory section of the ordnance, where his task was to check on the armaments stored at the various forts and barracks in Ireland. The House of Commons <span class="italic">Journals for Ireland</span> record payments for his expenses in 1765: he was paid &pound;38 in early 1765 &#145;for his travelling Expences, and to Viewers to assist him to examine the Arms of the Army at the different Parts of the Kingdom&#146;  (House of Commons <span class="italic">Journals for Ireland</span>, 8, 1796, appx, li: &#145;Sums expended &hellip; for March, June and Sept. quarters&#146;); in June 1765 he was given &pound;3 &#145;for his disbursements for a Horse, hired for a labourer to assist when sent to survey arms&#146;  (ibid.) and in September 1765 &pound;2 12<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. &#145;for twentyone Days travelling Expences going to the Laboratory at Chapel-Izod [in suburban Dublin]&#146;  (ibid.). The travelling was of use to his later career as it gave him the opportunity to look at the landscape. He did not officially leave the ordnance until 1788, shortly after the death of Ralph Ward, but he may have employed a substitute from the 1770s when he started exhibiting regularly. Sketchy, undated, drawings exist of Timoleague and a mill near Bantry, both in co. Cork, and of Askeyton and Limerick city in co. Limerick. They are probably fairly early, as stylistically they are quite different from the only other known drawings, mostly of Mount Merrion, dated about 1806 (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge).<br>
<br>Ashford's first oil paintings are charming, na&iuml;ve, flowerpieces, one of which is dated 1766 (National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin). With some other still lifes, they were exhibited at the Society of Artists in Ireland between 1767 and 1771. His first landscapes were shown in 1772 in Dublin and in 1775 he sent a landscape to the Royal Academy, when an unidentified critic wrote:<blockquote>We don't remember this artist's name before in any exhibition; notwithstanding this, he is so far from being a novice in his profession, that if he is young and attentive, he may well expect to reach the first form in this department of painting. (unidentified newspaper cutting, Courtauld Inst.)</blockquote>He is likely to have attended James Mannin's classes in the Dublin Society Schools, though his name is not recorded there. He was given two premiums by the society for exhibited landscapes. There were other masters in Dublin, however, and nothing is actually known of his training. The exhibitions give many changes of address before he settled about 1792 in a house designed for him in Sandymount by a friend, the great architect James Gandon. In his will he left this house to his daughter Anne. He had two sons, William, who became a doctor, and Daniel, who was described in the 1821 census as a &#145;Limner and a Gentleman&#146;. Nothing is known of his wife.<br>
<br>After he left the ordnance Ashford visited London more frequently than earlier in his career and exhibited at both the Royal Academy (1775&#150;1811) and the Society of Artists (1777&#150;91), of which he became a fellow in 1778. He sometimes sent Dublin addresses but his frequently changing London addresses indicate that he took lodgings when there. After 1806 he sent a number of works to the British Institution exhibitions.<br>
<br>In 1790 Ashford included five pictures in a sale held in London of the work of a friend, the marine painter, J. T. Serres. In 1792 he decided to sell his collection of statues and models to the Dublin Society which paid 80 guineas for them on 15 March. Unfortunately no catalogue survives of the exhibition and neither is there any list of his collection. In 1819 he held a one-man show in the board room of the Dublin Society's house in Hawkins Street, Dublin. After his death, according to the advertisement in <span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span> for 15 May 1824, Ashford's paintings, drawings, field studies, and sketches were auctioned by Gernon's of 38 Dawson Street, Dublin, taking four days to clear (18&#150;21 May 1824).<br>
<br>A great number of Ashford's landscapes were commissioned, usually in sets for gentlemen and aristocrats such as the duke of Leinster, the earls of Drogheda, Charleville, Bessborough, and Kilmorey, and Viscount Fitzwilliam (founder of the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge). Of these, the masterpieces were for Leinster (1779) and Charleville (1801), largely because they concentrated on the patrons' parks and not their buildings. The Leinster set did include two rather poor works of the ruins of Maynooth but the two of the park at Carton are, like the park at Charleville, superb. When the latter were exhibited in 1801 an unknown diarist wrote &#145;There is here abundant scope for an exertion of the artist's genius in the delineation of foliage &hellip; the colouring so beautifully rich, and various, that I could with pleasure have spent hours in viewing them&#146;  (MS, Royal Irish Academy). If Ashford was weakest at buildings, he was excellent at the figures and animals which enliven his landscapes. He preferred summer, though his seascapes were sometimes storm scenes. One winter scene, an illustration to a poem, survives (Birmingham City Art Gallery), and one autumnal scene, <span class="italic">Jacques and the Wounded Deer</span> (1790), a scene from <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>. Ashford painted one or two Shakespearian subjects but pure landscapes and seascapes were his favourites. One totally different picture exists, <span class="italic">The Opening of the Docks at Ringsend</span> (1796, National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin). This lively scene, full of ships and people, is a mixture of genre and modern history. His later works show weakening ability and are closer to genre painting than landscape.<br>
<br>Ashford was involved in setting up the Royal Hibernian Academy and became its first president in 1823, an unusual distinction for a landscape painter. He died at his home at Sandymount Park, Dublin, on 17 April 1824 and so did not see the first exhibitions in which his work was included.<br>
