<span class="headword">Dover,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1662, <em>d.</em> 1742), <span class="occ">physician and privateer</span>, was baptized on 6 May 1662 at Barton on the Heath, Warwickshire, the third son of John Dover (<i>bap</i>. 1614, <i>d</i>. 1696), gentleman, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Vade. Thomas was grandson of Robert Dover (1581/2&#150;1652), lawyer and reviver of the Cotswold games, with whom he has occasionally been confused, and the brother of the dramatist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7953/', "John Dover")</script>. Thomas followed John to Oxford, matriculating on 1 December 1680 at Magdalen Hall. He took his BA on 1 July 1684 and moved to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, as a pensioner in November 1686, graduating MB the following year. Dover subsequently went to live and study in Westminster at the house of Thomas Sydenham. While there, Dover contracted smallpox and was treated by his mentor. After being bled and purged:<blockquote>I went abroad, by his Direction, till I was blind, and then took to my Bed. I had no Fire allowed in my Room; my Windows were constantly open, my Bed-Clothes were order'd to be laid no higher than my Waist. He made me take twelve Bottles of Small-Beer, acidulated with Spirits of Vitriol, every Twenty-four Hours. (Dover, 119&#150;20)</blockquote>Dover was cured and retained a lifelong affection for Sydenham, urging the public to &#145;[r]ead the Man whose Reason was much superior to mine, the honest and good Dr. <i>Sydenham</i>&#146;  (Dover, 103). Some time during this period Dover married Joanna (<i>d</i>. 1727); they had twin daughters, Magdalen and Elizabeth, baptized on 27 April 1688, who died within weeks. A third daughter, Sibilla, born in 1693, later married John Hunt, and a fourth, Elizabeth, married John Opie.<br>
<br>By 1695 Dover had moved to Bristol, where he set up practice. He later reports that at this time spotted fever &#145;raged much &hellip; so that I visited from twenty-five to thirty Patients, a Day &hellip; besides their poor Children taken into their Workhouse, where I engaged &hellip; to find them Physick, and give them Advice at my own Expence and Trouble, for the two first Years&#146;  (Dover, 107&#150;8). That such a practice was unusual at the time is suggested by the reaction of one of Dover's detractors, H. Bradley, who labels it &#145;[t]he first laudable action I have yet met with from this practitioner&#146;  (Strong, 161). On 9 December 1697 Dover &#145;offered himself to be Phisitian to the New Workhouse gratis&#146;  (ibid., 71). Before 1708 Dover had travelled to the West Indies, perhaps aboard a Bristol slaver; he subsequently states that he cured the surgeon Jonathan Keate of diabetes in Port Royal &#145;more than forty Years since&#146;  (Dover, 28). Dover was subsequently described as someone &#145;who hath been a sea captain for many years, and who pretends to have learnt the method of cure in the West Indies where no one is known to die of the small-pox&#146;  (Dewhurst, 54). Whether owing to an inheritance, success in his practice or in the slave trade, or a combination of these, Dover was in a position to invest heavily in the Bristol syndicate backing Woodes Rogers's 1708 privateering venture to the south seas. This was not unique for the time: the physician John Radcliffe himself speculated in a vessel bound for the West Indies, which was captured by the French.<br>
<br>Rogers's expedition was, however, responsible for much of Dover's fame and not a little of his notoriety, causing Sir William Osler subsequently to stigmatize him as &#145;Dover, the Buccaneer&#146;  (Osler, 19). Owing to his stake Dover was appointed second captain of the <i>Duke</i> under Rogers, captain of the marines and president of the council, having two votes. His reason for personally participating in the venture is unknown, but may be reflected in his subsequent revision of advice offered by Dr Radcliffe to would-be practitioners:<blockquote>Perhaps he had done better, if he had obliged those Gentlemen to practice Physick at least ten Years, before their setting out for foreign Parts: They would then have been much more capable of making such Observations, as might be of singular Use to them; and 'tis further my Opinion, that if he had ordered them to visit the most intemperate Climates, where all acute Diseases are the most violent, they would have returned Masters of greater Knowledge and Experience. (Dover, 7)</blockquote>Dover modestly added that &#145;[i]f Traveling be necessary to make an accomplished Physician, I am very sure that I have travelled more than all the Physicians in <i>Great Britain</i> put together&#146;  (Dover, 7&#150;8). Prior voyages may well have provided the contacts or inclinations leading to Dover's involvement with Woodes Rogers.<br>
<br>The privateering expedition sailed on 1 August 1708. Before sighting Tenerife, Dover helped quell a mutiny on the <i>Duke</i> when Rogers had gone aboard a Swedish vessel to examine her cargo, and he also commanded the first expedition boat to land at Juan Fernandez on February 1709, where Alexander Selkirk, Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, was rescued. The ships revictualled here, and Woodes Rogers recalls the island's<blockquote>green piemento trees, which cast a refreshing smell. Our house being made by putting a sail round four of 'em, and covering it a top with another; so that Capt. Dover and I both thought it a very agreable seat, the weather being neither too hot nor too cold. (<span class="italic">Life Aboard a British Privateer</span>, 66&#150;7)</blockquote>Unfortunately, this appears to be the last time Rogers and the doctor agreed on anything during the cruise; Rogers's <span class="italic">Cruising Voyage</span> is generally silent about Dover, although, probably significantly, it omits him from its dedication &#145;To the worthy Gentlemen my surviving owners&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life Aboard a British Privateer</span>, 4). The breach presumably stemmed from disputes over precedence and tactics, particularly the successful April attack on Guayaquil which Dover insisted on leading, although once ashore he was prominent in urging caution. Dover later transmutes this: &#145;I took by Storm the two cities of <i>Guciaquil</i>&#146;  (Dover, 100)&#151;although, again significantly, this statement in his <span class="italic">Ancient Physician</span> appeared the year of Rogers's death. Against doctors' traditional adversary, disease, Dover was more in his element. Sleeping in Guayaquil's churches, where &#145;We were very much annoy'd with the Smell of dead Bodies&#146;  (Dover, 100), some one hundred and eighty privateers came down with the plague. Dover administered physic to all, and lost only seven or eight owing &#145;to the strong Liquers which their Mess-Mates procured for them&#146;  (Dover, 102). Rogers mentions the illness without ascribing its cure to Dover. Dover does not note that one of the deceased was his brother-in-law, Samuel Hopkins. By October, Dover had transferred from the <i>Duke</i> to the <i>Dutchess</i>, and his claim to captain the captured Manila ship <i>Nostra Signora de la Incarnacia del Singana</i> was met with the protest that he was &#145;utterly incapable of the office&#146;  (Powell, 128). (In a compromise, he was made the equivalent of a &#145;social captain&#146;.) The expedition successfully returned to England via the East Indies, where Dover appears to have made at least some medical enquiries. His return of &pound;6689 more than doubled his initial outlay and temporarily made the doctor a wealthy man before he lost much of this through investments in the South Sea Company.<br>
<br>By 1717 Dover had settled in London, being admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians on 30 September 1721. Despite some early success Dover fell foul of his fellows, and was admonished by the committee of censors in 1722 on a complaint by Dr Wagstaffe over interference with his treatment of a case. Plagued by South Sea debts, Dover sold his property at Barton on the Heath in July 1727 after the death of his wife. He spent three years in Gloucestershire, where he cured several individuals during the epidemic of 1728&#150;9 and tried unsuccessfully to set up a practice in Bristol. Dover then returned to the capital, seeing patients daily at the Jerusalem Coffee House.<br>
<br>It seems clear from his writings that Dover held some beliefs which might be termed holistic: &#145;[n]ature will neither be forced nor driven, and is often very hard to be led; but will do wonders when properly assisted&#146;  (Strong, 145). He was unprejudiced in many aspects of his practice: after a surgeon refused to bleed Miss Corbett in one case about 1720, Dover noted that &#145;[c]olours were all the same to the blind&#146; and summoned &#145;a <i>black man</i> who blooded very well&#146;  (Dewhurst, 131). At the same time Dover's attitude toward professionals appears to have been acerbic and confrontational; he had little good to say about apothecaries, whom he believed overcharged, or the College of Physicians, whom he termed a &#145;clan of prejudiced gentlemen&#146;  (Dover, 150), and in criticizing treatments, he was prepared to name names. In 1732 Dover published <span class="italic">The Ancient Physician's Legacy to his Country</span>, chiefly noted for his touting of mercury as a remedy for many diseases, which inevitably led to his nickname, the Quicksilver Doctor.<br>
<br>There followed much published criticism based on Dover's suggested remedies, his attitude toward fellow physicians, and, one suspects, inspired not a little by the doctor's invitation to patients to self-diagnose. H. Bradley referred to Dover's &#145;ungentlemanlike way of treating mankind, together with his blind zealous boasting of himself&#146;, adding, &#145;I fear our worthy author &hellip; has an itch, which all the cold baths in Europe cannot heal, I mean that itch of the tongue which not being well cured in his youth became so inveterate as not to be rooted out&#146;  (Strong, 159&#150;60). Daniel Turner noted that &#145;his conversation, you know, has been much with tars, and he thinks that the most tender constitutions of our citizens will bear the same rough handling&#146;  (ibid., 163), while the author of a <span class="italic">Treatise on Mercury</span> affirmed &#145;that some nurses, and even the grave-diggers&#146; were obliged to Dover for his publication  (ibid., 161). One of Dover's supporters opined that in writing his opus, &#145;You must have been under the strong Influence of some very Inauspicuous Planet, not your Friend Mercury&#146;, adding that while the doctor's opposers &#145;swim in Shoals with the Current, &hellip; You &hellip; labour against the Stream, friendless and unaccompanied, and whoever meets you in his Way, helps to sink you&#146;. Dover's treatise did, however, go through numerous editions (largely unrevised, although he did occasionally &#145;improve&#146; his testimonials). He was the originator of the formerly well-known &#145;Dover's powder&#146;, whose composition has changed since the publication of <span class="italic">The Ancient Physician's Legacy</span>.<br>
<br>In the 1740s Dover spent time at Stanway House, in Gloucestershire, belonging to his friend Robert Tracy, to whom the <span class="italic">Ancient Physician</span> was dedicated. Dover died there in April 1742 and was buried on 20 April in the Tracy family vault in Stanway church.<br>
