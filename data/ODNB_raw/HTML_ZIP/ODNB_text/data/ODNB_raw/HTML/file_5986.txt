<span class="headword">Colquhoun,  Archibald  Campbell-</span>  (<em>c.</em>1754&#150;1820), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was the only son of John Campbell (formerly Coates), a merchant of Clathick, Perthshire, and provost of Glasgow, and his wife, Agnes, the only child of Laurence Colquhoun of Killermont, Dunbartonshire. On succeeding to the estate of Killermont upon the death of his father in 1804 he assumed the additional surname and arms of Colquhoun. He was educated at Glasgow University and admitted an advocate in 1779. In 1796 he married Mary Ann, daughter of the Revd William Erskine, Episcopalian minister at Muthill, Perthshire, and sister of William Erskine (1769&#150;1822). They had six daughters and two sons&#151;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5991/', "John Campbell-Colquhoun (1803&#150;1870)")</script>, a writer, and William Laurence Campbell-Colquhoun, who died on 16 January 1861. Their eldest child died within a year of her birth, prompting Carolina Oliphant, afterwards Lady Nairne, to write &#145;The Land of the Leal&#146;, which she sent to her old friend Mrs Colquhoun. Colquhoun himself was a good classical scholar, a sound lawyer, and an eloquent pleader. However, being wealthy and reserved, he did not seek to obtain a large practice.<br>
<br>On the downfall of the &#145;ministry of all the talents&#146; Colquhoun was appointed lord advocate, on 28 March 1807. At this time most Scottish patronage was in the hands of the Dundas family, and William Erskine, Alexander Maconochie, and Henry Cockburn were actually chosen deputes by Lord Melville before Colquhoun had received the appointment. In May 1807 Colquhoun was elected MP for the Elgin district of burghs, but after three years he resigned his seat, in pursuit of a safer one. In July 1810 he was returned unopposed as member for Dunbartonshire, with the support of the duke of Montrose, and he held this seat securely until his death in 1820. In parliament he defended Lord Eldon's bill for the reform of the Scottish judicature. As the lord advocate he took part in reforming the constitution of the court of session, and he was appointed one of the thirteen commissioners who sat for the first time on 30 November 1808 for the purpose of inquiring into the administration of justice in Scotland. The correspondence between Colquhoun and Henry Erskine, the late lord advocate, on the subject of the respective merits of Lord Grenville's and Lord Eldon's bills for the reform of legal procedure was published in the 1808 edition of the <span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span>. Colquhoun was antagonized by the failure of the ministry to appoint him lord president in 1811, but he was made lord clerk register on 4 July 1816. Erskine's friends were much disappointed by the latter event; they had hoped that the post would have been offered to him. Other than in Scottish affairs Colquhoun was not a successful parliamentary speaker. He was shouted down in March 1809 when he attempted to defend the duke of York. He voted against Catholic relief in 1813.<br>
<br>Colquhoun was sheriff of Perth from 1793 to 1807 and rector of Glasgow University from 1807 to 1809. He died on 8 December 1820, after a short illness, at the house of his son-in-law, Walter Long, at Hartham, Wiltshire, and was buried in the parish churchyard of New Kilpatrick, near Glasgow. His wife survived him for many years, and died at Rothesay on 15 May 1833.<br>
