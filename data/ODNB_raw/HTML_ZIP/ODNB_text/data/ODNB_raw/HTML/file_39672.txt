<span class="headword">Smith,  Francis</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1691), <span class="occ">bookseller and General Baptist minister</span>, was the son of Francis Smith, a Yorkshire farrier from Bradford. No further information has as yet been discovered about his family background or his birth details. On 3 May 1647 he was apprenticed to Thomas Hazard, a stationer; he was made free of the Stationers' Company on 5 May 1654. By this time Smith was living at or near the Sugar Loaf in Queen's Head Alley, London, whence his first imprint, a Baptist treatise, appeared in 1653. In 1654, with the aid of several General Baptist leaders, he opened business at Flying Horse Court in Fleet Street, engaging primarily in the distribution of Baptist pamphlets. By 1659, however, he had begun to publish politically radical and republican tracts (including Captain William Bray's <span class="italic">A Plea for the Peoples Good Old Cause</span>) and his premises were being regularly searched. In this year he opened premises near Temple Bar under the sign of the Elephant and Castle; he subsequently became known as Elephant Smith on account of this trademark sign.<br>
<br>The Restoration government regarded Smith as a threat. In 1660 he was imprisoned three times for his involvement, along with Livewell Chapman, in publishing Henry Jessey's <span class="italic">The Lord's Loud Call</span>, a republican catalogue of providential signs. Simultaneously, however, Smith was preoccupied with pastoral issues. In March he had been a signatory to the General Baptists' seminal <span class="italic">Brief Confession &hellip; of Faith</span>, which he also published. Shortly afterwards he published his own devotional work, <span class="italic">Symptomes of Growth and Decay to Godlinesse</span>. By this time Smith was married. The background of his wife, Eleanor (<i>d</i>. in or after 1696), is unknown. From the time of their marriage, however, she played a key role in her husband's business; she continued his trade during Smith's periods of imprisonment and exile, and emerged as a bookseller in her own right after his death. The couple had at least four children, two of whom, Francis junior and Eleanor junior, also joined their parents' business.<br>
<br>Early in 1661 Smith was accused of involvement in Venner's Fifth Monarchist uprising and consequently endured searches, assaults, and the confiscation of his property. He co-published a Baptist plea for toleration; in August, however, he was convicted of treason and imprisoned with others for collaborating in another collection of providential signs. Held in close confinement until the following spring, Smith petitioned persistently against his illegal treatment; he was also penalized by heavy prison fines and loss of trade. He was arrested on at least two further occasions over the next five years. In 1665 he moved his family for the duration of the plague to Dorking, Surrey, where he was again arrested; he was saved from imprisonment in Windsor Castle by the intercession of Sir Thomas Foster, JP for Middlesex and Surrey and son of Lord Chief Justice Sir Robert Foster.<br>
<br>While he produced relatively little throughout the 1660s, Smith nevertheless emerged during this period as the principal publisher of the works of John Bunyan, who, like Smith, endured persecution and imprisonment for refusing to compromise his convictions. Between 1661 and 1676 Smith published the majority of Bunyan's writings with the significant exception of the author's major work of 1666, <span class="italic">Grace Abounding</span>. By 1679&#151;when Smith incidentally published the third edition of <span class="italic">Grace Abounding</span>&#151;his increasing political activity and attendant prosecutions appear to have led Bunyan to entrust his work to more reliable booksellers.<br>
<br>Upon his return to London after the plague Smith's premises were investigated regularly by Roger L'Estrange, surveyor of the presses, and his finances were compromised by further litigation. In 1670 he was questioned about a printed critique of the <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span>. He subsequently preached to a congregation in Goswell Street and was finally arrested for violating the act. He was arrested regularly throughout 1671, eventually relinquishing his trade for six months. However, with the publication of the declaration of indulgence Smith was granted a licence to preach to two General Baptist groups in Cornhill, London, and Croydon, Surrey.<br>
<br>In 1673 Smith relocated&#151;with his trade sign&#151;to premises near the Royal Exchange, Cornhill, operating briefly from this and his old Temple Bar addresses. The following year he fell victim to profiteering by an unscrupulous warden of the Stationers' Company, Samuel Mearne, who confiscated a Baptist treatise from Smith's premises and (in a by no means uncommon piece of corruption) subsequently published it himself in a pirated imprint. The earl of Shaftesbury intervened on Smith's behalf, and the king ultimately ordered compensation; Smith testified against Mearne before the House of Lords in 1677. He continued to be hounded, at great cost to his business, by both Mearne and L'Estrange.<br>
<br>The Popish Plot and exclusion crisis marked a period of intensive political and professional activity for Smith, who associated closely with Shaftesbury and Titus Oates. In 1679 he published Popish Plot narratives, extracts from parliamentary journals, and seditious tracts. Arrested and examined on numerous occasions, he was frequently acquitted by sympathetic whig juries. In October, however, he was imprisoned and fined for selling a stinging expos&eacute; of the trial of George Wakeman, the queen's Catholic physician, who had been accused by Oates of plotting to kill the king and whose acquittal of treason after a summing-up by the judge, Lord Chief Justice Scroggs, allegedly loaded in his favour, fuelled allegations that the judge had accepted bribes. Smith was imprisoned again in December for promoting petitions for a parliamentary sitting. Throughout 1680 he distributed numerous opposition tracts and was a key whig campaigner in the shrieval elections. In September he was indicted for publishing a protest against the extravagances of municipal leaders. Despite a sympathetic jury he was detained on Judge Jeffreys's order before being released by proclamation. He testified against Jeffreys before a Commons committee in October; Jeffreys resigned as recorder the following month. Subsequently indicted for publishing Shaftesbury's <span class="italic">Speech Lately Made by a Noble Peer</span>, which explicitly questioned the integrity of the king, Smith was acquitted by a packed whig jury in January 1681.<br>
<br>Smith's career peaked dangerously in this year. His publications attacked papists and arbitrary power and objected to the dissolution of parliament. <span class="italic">Smith's Protestant Intelligence</span>, an organ of whig propaganda, appeared on 1 February. A key figure in the whig campaigns, Smith accompanied the party to Oxford in March; he distributed an outspoken anti-government tract, <span class="italic">Vox populi</span>, gratis to each member of the Oxford parliament. Returning to London upon the parliament's dissolution, he was arrested for treason in mid-April. His <span class="italic">Protestant Intelligence</span> was terminated, and he was held in Newgate prison until his release&#151;for lack of evidence&#151;in June.<br>
<br>As the tories re-appropriated power, Smith's fortunes declined. L'Estrange headed a viciously successful press campaign which satirized and discredited his &#145;Anabaptist&#146; <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i>. The tory propaganda effort identified Smith with the most fanatical republicanism, or &#145;Franksmithism&#146;  (Crist, 204), and lampooned him in a broadside ballad, <span class="italic">The Leacherous Anabaptist</span>. Increasingly isolated, Smith nevertheless continued to distribute opposition newsletters and was active in the mayoral elections that September. About this time he co-published Stephen College's libellous ballad, <span class="italic">A Ra-Ree Show</span>. Upon its author's execution Smith fled the country; he remained in exile, apparently in the Netherlands, for more than two years. His wife and his children, Francis and Eleanor, continued the business in his absence, and were themselves frequently prosecuted.<br>
<br>On returning to England in March 1684 Smith was immediately arrested; he was tried by Jeffreys in June for his hand in <span class="italic">A Ra-Ree Show</span>. Pilloried and fined &pound;500, Smith was unable to raise either money or security for his release; he remained in prison until January 1688, when he was pardoned by James II. In that year, he moved to Pope's Head Alley, establishing his business once again under the sign of the Elephant and Castle. He published very little, and early in 1689 sought financial aid from a local Baptist church. He petitioned King William for a position in the port of London, and was finally employed as a watchman in October that year. He died two years later, on 22 December 1691, and was buried in Bunhill Fields. Despite his ostensible financial ruin he left to his wife a 6 acre property in Surrey and a collection of books.<br>
<br>Described by his detractors as a &#145;pestilent&#146; and &#145;Pernicious&#146; dissenter (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1680&#150;81</i>, 358; Smith, <span class="italic">Injurious Proceedings</span>, 2), Elephant Smith was as much feared as reviled by the state officials who hounded and prosecuted him. As an opposition bookseller and whig activist he stands alone in the tenacity and openness of the uncompromising principles for which he was arrested, imprisoned on innumerable occasions, and financially ruined. Smith's political engagement was rooted in the religious convictions which he held deeply and exercised regularly. Cataloguing the relentless physical and material costs of his prosecutions and imprisonments, his autobiographical writings constantly reproached the authorities who persecuted him, and represented their author&#151;with some measure of truth&#151;as a martyr to his cause.<br>
