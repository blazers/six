<span class="headword">Elam,  Gervase</span>  (1681&#150;1771), <span class="occ">merchant and Quaker minister</span>, was born on 3 October 1681 at Heath, Skircoates Moor, Halifax, the only child of John Elam (1639/40&#150;1730), a card-maker, and his second wife, Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1682) of Kendal, daughter of Gervase Benson of Borratt, Sedbergh. Born into a devout Quaker family Elam remained a constant member of the Society of Friends throughout his life.<br>
<br>Little is known of Elam's early years and education aside from his having had one half-brother and a half-sister. In 1703 he moved to Leeds, where in the following year he gave notice to the Leeds meeting of the Society of Friends that he intended to set up as a clothier in Armley, where he was until at least 1750. On 26 August 1715 he married Elizabeth (1694&#150;1777), daughter of John and Mercy Smith of Wortley, at the Meadow Lane meeting-house, Leeds. The couple had eleven children, including seven sons, six of whom went on to develop Elam's diverse trading interests during his lifetime. The success of Elam's business rested on his investment in an expanding American market previously dominated by merchants from continental Europe. Variously working alone, with family, or with other members of the Quaker merchant community he exported a range of goods, of which the most significant was cloth, and imported tobacco with the help of family members resident in the American colonies. Elam may himself have visited Virginia in 1744. Opportunities at home were also grasped with the purchase of land and a number of properties in Leeds and the surrounding area.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Elam was an active and conscientious member of the Leeds Friends' meeting. As a young man he accompanied &#145;travelling Friends&#146; to their meetings so as to acquire the opportunity for business and social contact with fellow Quakers. He suffered frequent financial losses both in money and goods because he refused to pay tithes and other dues to the Church of England. Between 1712 and 1749 he represented the Leeds meeting on more than forty occasions at monthly meetings of the society. A generous contributor to Quaker causes and concerns, his first donation was of 15<i>s</i>. towards building a stable at the Quaker school at Camp Lane. In 1732 he was made an elder of the meeting; his duties, faithfully fulfilled, included vetting couples intending to marry, signing testimonies, and giving advice on the cloth trade.<br>
<br>Of Elam's home life little is known. His family supported him in business and religion until his death in Leeds on 14 November 1771. He was buried at the Leeds meeting burial-ground, in Meadow Lane, on 17 November and was survived by his wife and five of their children. Obituary notices appeared in &#145;A testament to public Friends dead&#146; (RS Friends, Lond.), which remarked on his &#145;late call to the Ministry&#146;, as well as in the <span class="italic">Leeds Intelligencer</span> (19 November 1771) and the <span class="italic">Providence and Rhode Island Gazette</span> (14 March 1772). Though no will has been found his son Joseph is known to have inherited Elam's property at Armley.<br>
