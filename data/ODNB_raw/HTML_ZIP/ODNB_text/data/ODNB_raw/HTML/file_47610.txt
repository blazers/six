<span class="headword">Cotter, Sir  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1705), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, was the second son of Edmond Cotter (<i>d</i>. 1660), landowner, and Elizabeth Connell, the daughter of John Connell of Barryscourt. Little is known of Cotter's early life, though he may have served with the royalists during the English civil war. His first confirmed action seems to have been involvement in an abortive attempt to assassinate a number of those involved in the execution of Charles I, who were then living as exiles in Vevey, Switzerland. However, on 11 August 1664 Cotter and two fellow Irishmen succeeded in shooting dead the regicide John Lisle on his way to church in Lausanne. Although Cotter himself neither led the mission nor actually carried out the killing, his involvement in the murder seems to have provided the foundation upon which his future advancement was based. Popular tradition says he received a knighthood and a commission in the army for this service, though the former claim is unsubstantiated.<br>
<br>In July 1666 Cotter did indeed receive a commission, but in 1667 he was captured by the French during an attempted invasion of the island of St Kitts in the West Indies. Despite accusations concerning his poor conduct in battle and of fraternization with his captors, Cotter returned to England in May 1668 and successfully petitioned for relief and back payment. Having resigned his commission in November 1673, Cotter was granted a number of administrative posts in the West Indies. Though these were held in trust by his elder brother, and exercised by deputies, they proved very profitable. Following a further mission to Switzerland in 1676, during which he provided a report on the activities of Edmund Ludlow and his remaining fellow regicides, Cotter returned to the West Indies. In 1679 he married Margaret Stapleton, the daughter of Sir William Stapleton, a fellow Catholic Irishman, with whom Cotter had fought at St Kitts and who was now the governor of the Leeward Islands. By April 1681 Cotter had assumed the rank of colonel, and was governor of the island of Montserrat, whose administration was dominated by Irishmen.<br>
<br>In September 1682 Cotter travelled to England on leave, apparently never returning to the West Indies. Earlier that year, following his petitioning, he had been awarded a pension of &pound;200 annually from the Irish revenue. Cotter then seems to have returned to Ireland, purchasing land in co. Cork to enlarge the small estate he had already established. In September 1683 he was admitted a freeman of the city of Cork, and in 1684 was acting as a magistrate in the county. Further acquisitions of land followed, and in 1686 he acted as sheriff of co. Cork. Cotter's possible participation at the battle of Sedgemoor in 1685 may have resulted in his being knighted, but again there is no proof to this effect. In 1688 he married for a second time; his wife was Ellen Plunkett (<i>d</i>. 1698), the daughter of Lord Louth, with whom he subsequently had seven children.<br>
<br>From March that year Cotter's proven loyalty to the crown and his position in the Irish Catholic &eacute;lite led to his taking on new responsibilities. These included his appointment as a lieutenant-colonel in a Jacobite regiment. He was also elected as a member for Cork city in the &#145;patriot parliament&#146; of 1689, and appointed the governor of Cork by James II on 11 February 1690. Following the flight of James II, Cotter's wife and eldest son, also <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47611/', "James Cotter")</script>, were removed to France as Cotter himself assumed command of the Jacobite forces in the south-west. His military exploits throughout the war met with mixed results, but under the subsequent treaty of Limerick he retained his lands.<br>
<br>Opposition to this was countered by declarations of support from the protestant inhabitants of Cork city and Sir Richard Cox. Cotter then turned to the life of a country gentleman, allegedly becoming a patron of Gaelic bards and musicians. He was also accused of sheltering a Catholic bishop despite the enactment of legislation excluding the hierarchy from Ireland. He died in comfortable circumstances in 1705 at Rockforest, co. Cork, where he was buried. The details of Cotter's life suggest he was a man of energy and opportunism, with a durable loyalty to both the crown and his religion. Ultimately, it may be that his career and reputation contributed to the fate of his son James, hanged for rape in 1720.<br>
