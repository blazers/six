<span class="headword">Wragg,  Edward Conrad <span class="st"> [Ted]</span></span>  (1938&#150;2005), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born on 26 June 1938 at 158 Clarence Street, Sheffield, the only child of George William Wragg, fruit and flower hawker, and his wife, Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brandstetter, a cook. His father's first wife had died and he had a half-brother from that marriage. His mother had been born in Urfahr, Austria, and Wragg's uncle had been at school with Adolf Hitler. Wragg's mother had come to the UK on a passage assisted by the Austrian government, worked in service, and met her husband when he came to the house with flowers to sell. She was ambitious for her son and rather than send him to the inner-city school local to the family's terraced home she took him on the tram to Hunters Bar primary school, then considered the best in the city. When early signs of Wragg's promise emerged his father, a strong, opinionated, and determined working-class man, was proud of him, but his mother remained the driving force.<br>
<br>Wragg inherited a fine singing voice from his mother, who had sung on Austrian radio, and every Friday he was expected to sing in his primary school assembly. He would become physically sick with apprehension but his mother insisted he do it, sending him in with a biscuit to settle his stomach. In his last year at Hunters Bar an inspirational class teacher had a lasting impact. The teacher used projects to help his pupils learn at a time when projects were not generally done in schools. He took the class on trips, including one to Sheffield reference library to show them how to use reference materials. Wragg continued to use the library when he was a university student and met former classmates there. He passed the entrance examination for the city's King Edward VII Grammar School, where he excelled and pursued his loves of music, acting, and sport&#151;he was a lifelong Sheffield Wednesday fan even though he was discouraged from playing football at King Edward's because it was &#145;working class&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). Later he coached university sides and was a qualified referee.<br>
<br>Wragg could have studied music at university but instead chose to study German at Durham University and contented his musical side by playing guitar in a skiffle band. His mother's native tongue had not been spoken at home. She and her sister, who also lived in England, had been reported for speaking in German when to do so during the Second World War risked internment, and abandoned their first language. Wragg grew up during the Second World War experiencing anti-German feeling and was the only child in his street not invited to VE-day celebrations, because he was known as the &#145;little German&#146;  (<span class="italic">Times Educational Supplement</span>, 3 Feb 2006).<br>
<br>At Durham Wragg was joined by his girlfriend, Judith King, whom he had met at a Congregational church conference at Easter 1956. The daughter of Beaumont King, steelworker, she annoyed her teachers by giving up a local authority exhibition to read geography and history at Durham to take a shorter teacher training course so that they would finish their studies at the same time. Wragg graduated with a first-class degree and a distinction in the oral, and followed this with a first in his postgraduate certificate of education. He then spent four years as an assistant master at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield, from 1960. He and Judith, who had qualified as a primary school teacher, married at Netherfield Independent Chapel, Thurlstone, Yorkshire, on 29 December that year&#151;the start of a highly successful marriage that produced three much loved children, Josie, Caroline, and Christopher. Meanwhile Wragg's ability was spotted early, and he was appointed head of German at Wyggeston Boys' School, Leicester, at the age of twenty-six. He stayed only two years but left a clear impression on his pupils. One of them, Paul Fletcher, later said: &#145;He was an inspiring teacher &hellip; His teaching style was effortless, his classroom control flawless, his humour still memorable&#146;  (http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/mpapps, 10 Nov 2005).<br>
<br>In 1966 Wragg became a lecturer in education at Exeter University, where he also studied for his PhD, awarded in 1972 (he had taken the degree of MEd at Leicester University in 1967). In 1973 he was appointed to the chair of education at Nottingham University, at thirty-five the youngest professor of education in the country. At Nottingham he led an intensive two-year project looking at mixed ability teaching that found that bright children were not sufficiently stretched as effort focused on bringing the less able up to standard. He wrote: &#145;It is probably true that only exceptional teachers can manage unstreamed classes. I have tried it myself, and it is the hardest thing I have ever done&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 Nov 2005). But he thought it should be left to the schools to decide whether to stream classes or not, rather than to &#145;some moronic teenager in the Number 10 Policy Unit&#146;, as he later put it  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 1 Feb 2005). He vehemently opposed the &#145;marketization&#146; of education. His overriding aim was to see all children get a better education, not just children lucky enough to get into good schools. He railed against the testing regime and the league tables that followed the introduction of the national curriculum by the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, but his branding as an educational establishment &#145;leftie&#146; by the political right later in his career failed to take on board the traditionalist side of this progressive educator.<br>
<br>In 1978 Wragg became director of the Institute of Education at Exeter University after he dazzled the interview board, and under his leadership it became pre-eminent in education research. During his time there he became the acerbic and witty spokesman for a generation of teachers who felt he uniquely understood what they did. For twenty-five years his columns in the <span class="italic">Times Educational Supplement</span>, and later <span class="italic">The Independent</span> and <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, poured jargon-free comic vitriol on policies that diminished and demeaned the professionalism of teachers. He was on the teachers' side. As he said in one of his columns, &#145;There is no higher calling; without [teachers] society would slide back into primitive squalor&#146;  (<span class="italic">Times Educational Supplement</span>, 19 April 2002). Successive education ministers from Shirley Williams to Estelle Morris consulted him, and if they didn't he would ring and give the benefit of his advice. He was an ideal point of contact for journalists, since he seemed to know exactly what was going on in the corridors of power. He kept on teaching in schools whenever he could and was in touch with the realities of the job. Shortly before his death he took part in a television series that he masterminded, in which a group of disaffected teenagers was taught in a specially tailored school. At one point Wragg confessed to camera: &#145;I like all the kids and love them, but I could cheerfully take them behind a tree and ruin my career by smacking the hell out of them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Times Educational Supplement</span>, 9 Sept 2005). Teachers took comfort from someone who knew how frustrating teaching could be.<br>
<br>During the course of his career Wragg wrote more than fifty books and 800 academic articles but it was his newspaper columns and his frequent appearances on television and radio that made him the most famous man in education of his day. He lampooned government ministers and educationists who had come up with what he described as wheezes, and created such unforgettable characters as Tony Zoffis (as in &#145;Tony's office&#146;)&#151;a man who supposedly always did what the prime minister of the day, Tony Blair, wanted. His arch enemy Chris Woodhead, a controversial rightwing chief inspector of schools, was described as Woodentop. But Wragg was no dogmatist. In his book <span class="italic">The Cubic Curriculum</span> (1997), which looked at theories of how children best absorb information and nurture their imagination, he said: &#145;Learners need the excitement of finding out, just as they need the confirmation of being told. It should not be a matter of one versus the other&#146;  (p. 89). As an example of his pragmatism, if asked whether he favoured &#145;phonics&#146; or &#145;look and say&#146; when teaching children to read, he would ask his interlocutor whether they favoured a fork or a knife when eating.<br>
<br>Wragg stood down as director of the Institute of Education at Exeter in 1994 but continued as professor of education until 2003, when he retired, and was made professor emeritus. He had received numerous honorary degrees and had been a specialist adviser to parliamentary select committees on education and worked on numerous educational bodies, often from the chairman's seat. He was particularly influential as chairman of the School Broadcasting Council and its successor, the Educational Broadcasting Council (1981&#150;7). He worked with Lord Puttnam to found the national teaching awards and from 2000 chaired the judging panel. His work in leading a commission investigating the struggling education system in Birmingham was seminal and helped the city's schools turn a corner. He suggested performance targets set by teachers, not governments, and entitlements to school trips and cultural visits, harking back to things that had excited his intellect and imagination as a boy. In 2008 cultural entitlements for all schoolchildren were introduced nationally. At the time of his death it was rumoured that he was about to join the House of Lords as a Liberal Democrat peer.<br>
<br>Wragg had huge energy, rising at 4 or 5 a.m. to write articles before the working day began. He lived life in the fast lane both metaphorically and literally: his much loved BMW had a driver who liked to get a move on. He was an editor's dream, delivering sparkling copy on time and to length and, if necessary, at very short notice. He was a reporter's dream, too, whose formidable memory calling up complex background made further research redundant. He was also a man of great kindness and warmth.<br>
<br>Wragg had taken up jogging in his mid-thirties and tried to jog every day. Once, in Belfast during the height of the troubles, he had jogged in his suit, his wife, Judith, having hidden his running kit because she didn't think it was safe out on the streets; he had a deliciously stubborn streak. It was while jogging one Sunday that he collapsed near his home and was taken to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, where he died on 10 November 2005 of myocardial infarction. He was survived by his wife and their three children. When the news was released website message boards at the BBC, Exeter University, and the <span class="italic">Times Educational Supplement</span> among others were inundated with messages of condolence. In February 2006 Exeter Cathedral was packed with 700 people for a memorial service. A tribute evening later that month at London's Institute of Education attracted more than 900 participants and speakers included John Prescott, the deputy prime minister; Neil Kinnock, the former leader of the Labour Party; and Rory Bremner, the impressionist and comedian (for whom Wragg had written sketches). A memorial fund was launched during the evening to provide educational opportunities for disadvantaged young people in Wragg's home town of Sheffield.<br>
