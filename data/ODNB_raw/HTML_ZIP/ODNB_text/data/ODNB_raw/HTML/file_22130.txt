<span class="headword">Phillips,  Robert</span>  (<em>b. </em>1499<span class="mult">x</span>1502, <em>d.</em> in or after 1553), <span class="occ">musician</span>, is of unknown parentage. His career at the highest levels in church music began in childhood, since in April 1514 his name occurs as a chorister boy of Henry VIII's Chapel Royal. In 1521 he was employed as a lay singing man of the household chapel of Cardinal Wolsey, and in 1527 may have been seconded to Wolsey for his embassy to France. By then, however, he had become a gentleman of the Chapel Royal, where his name first occurs in February 1524.<br>
<br>By 1537 Phillips was tutor to his own private pupils and considered himself one of the Chapel Royal's star singers, insisting that on all great occasions the performance of the longest and most virtuosic solo passages be appointed to him. His deployment of this practice at a service sung jointly with the choir of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, about 1538 earned him a passing mention as a minor villain of Foxe's book of martyrs. Foxe indicates that Phillips was an assertive adherent of traditional religion, who took particular exception to Robert Testwood, a singing man of Windsor and notorious evangelical. Upon discovering that there had been selected as the evening antiphon some setting of the text <span class="italic">Lauda vivi alpha et o</span>, Phillips contrived to ensure that he was appointed to sing a duet passage whose excessive and non-biblical hyperbole in praise of the Virgin Mary would prove an irresistible temptation to Testwood's indiscreet high spirits. Phillips did indeed succeed in goading him into a musical assertion of his protestant leanings that eventually helped to take him to the stake.<br>
<br>Phillips's absence from Chapel Royal lists of 1551 and 1552 suggests that his religious convictions caused his withdrawal during the latter part of the reign of Edward VI. Recalled by 1 August 1553, he was not present at the late king's burial on 8 August, and does not recur thereafter.<br>
