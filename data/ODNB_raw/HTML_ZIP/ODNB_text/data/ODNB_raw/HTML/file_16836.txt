<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Henry Humphrey Evans</span>  (<em>c.</em>1718&#150;1783), <span class="occ">army officer and military writer</span>, was born the son of a clergyman at Cwm Bychan Farm, in the parish of Llanbedr, Merioneth. He was educated at Jesus College, Oxford. Lloyd hoped to pursue a military career but could not afford to purchase a commission. In 1744 he went to France, where he also failed to secure an officer's posting. Disappointed, he entered a Jesuit college as a lay brother tutoring military officers in geography and field engineering. A year later he left to accompany the French army on an invasion of the Austrian Netherlands during the War of the Austrian Succession (1740&#150;48). Lloyd's sketches of the battlefield of Fontenoy (1745) attracted the attention of the French commanding engineer, and Lloyd received a commission as a junior officer in the engineer corps. With a captain's rank, he then accompanied the forces of Charles Stuart, the Young Pretender, on the ill-fated Jacobite expedition to Scotland (1745&#150;6). Lloyd left the prince's army on a secret mission carrying dispatches to rebel supporters in Wales. Later, disguised as a clergyman, he reconnoitred the south English coast in anticipation of a possible French invasion. Lloyd was arrested (probably under an assumed name since there is no official record of his imprisonment) as a suspected spy and transported to London. His friend John Drummond obtained Lloyd's release and they returned to France. Promoted major, Lloyd distinguished himself in a subsequent French campaign in the Low Countries as an engineer officer at the siege of the Dutch fortress at Bergen op Zoom (1747). Later he entered the Prussian army, but then offered his skills to Marshal Charles Louis Auguste Fouquet de Belle-Isle, returning to French service in 1754. He collected information on the various armies of Europe, subsequently published as <span class="italic">Capt. Lloyd's Lists</span> (1760). Lloyd then travelled to England disguised as a merchant and conducted another reconnaissance of the British coast for a proposed French landing. When Drummond met him in London in 1756, however, Lloyd claimed to be receiving a pension from the British government of &pound;500 a year (he was never commissioned in the British army; if true, these funds were most likely from secret service moneys).<br>
<br>On his return to the continent Lloyd joined the Austrian army with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He served as a quartermaster officer on Field Marshal F. M. Lacy's staff in the first campaigns of the Seven Years' War (1756&#150;63). Having achieved the rank of major-general, in 1760 he commanded a reconnaissance force tracking the movements of the Prussian army. That same year Lloyd changed sides and entered the Prussian service under Ferdinand, duke of Brunswick. After the war in Germany ended he attempted to obtain a position with Count Wilhelm Schaumburg-Lippe, who was preparing to defend Portugal against a Spanish invasion. Hostilities ended before Lloyd entered the Portuguese service and instead he returned to England, where he began an intermittent writing career. Colonel David Graeme of Grothy allegedly employed Lloyd in negotiating the marriage of Queen Charlotte and George III. In 1768 Lloyd was again serving the British, conducting a secret mission to Italy to organize supplies for the defence of Corsica. In 1773&#150;4 he commanded a Russian division in combat against the Turks and distinguished himself at the siege of Silistria (1773). He later commanded a Russian force opposing the Swedish. He allegedly quit Russian service after he was refused the order of St Anne because of his common birth. His travels then took him to Italy, Spain, and Gibraltar. Lloyd married a sister of the Chevalier James de Johnstone, details of whom are unknown; they had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16835/', "Hannibal Evans Lloyd")</script>, the philologist and translator.<br>
<br>Lloyd is best remembered as a writer on military strategy. His books include <span class="italic">A Rhapsody of the Present System of French Politics</span> (1779), in which he set out ways to frustrate a French invasion of Great Britain. After Lloyd's death, British agents allegedly searched his house and removed confidential papers. Lloyd's heirs were later paid by the British government not to publish further editions of his work. Subsequent editions did appear, however, under a different title, <span class="italic">A Political and Military Rhapsody on the Invasion and Defence of Great Britain</span>, during the invasion scares of 1794 and 1798. Lloyd's most enduring and influential work remains <span class="italic">The history of the late war in Germany between the king of Prussia and the empress of Germany and her allies</span> (1766). His &#145;Reflections on the principles of the art of war&#146;, also known as &#145;Political and military memoirs&#146;, was added for the second edition (1781). The <span class="italic">History</span> was translated into at least five German and three French editions, the most famous by Georg Fredrich von Templehoff (1783). A second volume of the work, compiled from Lloyd's papers after his death, was published in 1784. In these works rests Lloyd's reputation as the father of the principles of modern warfare. It was his belief that &#145;this [military] art, like all others is founded on certain fixed principles which are by their nature invariable&#146;  (Alger, 19). Lloyd's military principles referred mainly to the organization of armies and the conduct of operations, many of which he based on mathematical calculations. His enunciation of the principles of war reflected the French military school, particularly the writings of Field Marshal Maurice de Saxe (under whom Lloyd had served in 1745), and the philosophy of the Enlightenment which advocated that rational, scientific rules could be derived to predict human behaviour. Among his acquaintances, Lloyd served for a period (1759) with a well-known Milanese exponent of Enlightenment philosophy, Pietro Verri, and the two thinkers undoubtedly influenced one another. Lloyd's other works included <span class="italic">An Essay on the English Constitution</span> (1770), an elaboration on the balance of power between monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy (another manuscript on this subject, &#145;Essai philosophique sur les governments&#146;, remained unpublished), and <span class="italic">An Essay on the Theory of Money</span> (1771), a defence of the use of paper money.<br>
<br>Henry Lloyd had significant influence on military leaders and theorists in Europe and in colonial America. General George Washington, commander of the colonial army during the American War of Independence, had a well-read copy of <span class="italic">Political and Military Rhapsody</span> in his library. While Napoleon called Lloyd's military theories absurd, Antoine-Henri de Jomini, the best-known contemporary analyst of Napoleon's campaigns, credited Lloyd in his <span class="italic">Trait&eacute; de grande tactique</span> (1803), and plagiarized much of Lloyd's work in the text. Carl von Clausewitz, in his major work <span class="italic">Vom Kriege</span> (1832&#150;7), rejected Lloyd's dogmatic approach to military operations for a more comprehensive theory of warfare emphasizing the interplay between the state, politics, chance, individual action, and military affairs.<br>
<br>In the twentieth century Lloyd's theories were influential on the writings of Colonel J. F. C. Fuller. Fuller, reflecting on the military disasters of trench warfare in the First World War, believed that reviving Lloyd's principles might be instructive to future military leaders. The American Second World War general George S. Patton, who led the US Third Army during the allied campaign in Europe (1944&#150;5), retained a dog-eared copy of Lloyd's <span class="italic">History</span> in his extensive professional library. Although the notion of fixed, inviolable principles of war has long gone out of fashion in Western armies, many still retain principles of war in their doctrine as broad guidelines for the conduct of warfare. Lloyd died at The Hague on 19 June 1783.<br>
