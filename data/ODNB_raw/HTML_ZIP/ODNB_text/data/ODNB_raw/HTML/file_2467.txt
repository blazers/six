<span class="headword">Biscoe,  Richard</span>  (1687/8&#150;1748), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, of unknown parents, was educated for the nonconformist ministry at Samuel Benion's academy, Shrewsbury, from about 1706 until Benion's death in 1708, and later at Leiden University. He was ordained on 19 December 1716 at the Old Jewry meeting-house, London, by nine ministers including Edmund Calamy III, who gave the charge which was subsequently published. He was minister of the Presbyterian meeting, Newington Green, Middlesex, from at least 1714. Walter Wilson suggests he was there from 1708, presumably as assistant to John Russell who died in 1714. Dudley Ryder, the future lord chief justice, who heard him preach in October 1716 and again in December, thought him &#145;a very dull preacher&#146;. &#145;Mr Biscoe does not become the pulpit well at all. He has a very dull manner of delivery and has a very simple air in it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Dudley Ryder</span>, 355, 372). He was a non-subscriber at the Salters' Hall debate in 1719. Biscoe resigned from Newington Green on 25 December 1727, conformed, and was ordained deacon, the date of his subscription being 8 January 1728. He was presented to the rectory of St Martin Outwich, London, on 27 February. In 1729 he was admitted MA by Magdalene College, Cambridge, by royal mandate.<br>
<br>Biscoe wrote to Bishop Edmund Gibson in 1733 with comments on Gibson's proposals for church reform. In 1736 he was chosen to preach the Boyle lectures, evidence of his reputation for learning, which he delivered in a series of twenty-four sermons over three years in the parish church of St Mary-le-Bow, London. He may have been the author of the <span class="italic">Remarks</span> on Benjamin Hoadley's <span class="italic">Plain Account of the Nature &hellip; of the Lord's Supper</span> (1735); if so he already had a reputation as a controversialist. In 1736 he was appointed to the prebendary of Ealdstreet, and collated to his stall in St Paul's Cathedral on 19 October. He published his Boyle lectures as <span class="italic">The History of the Acts of the Holy Apostles &hellip; Consider'd as Full Evidence of the Truth of Christianity</span> (1742). It was translated into German and published at Magdeburg in 1751. According to William Orme, although the biblical critic John Lightfoot had collected a great deal of material on the same subject it was &#145;better digested&#146; by Biscoe  (Orme, 47&#150;8). Philip Doddridge thought highly of the work as demonstrating &#145;in the most convincing manner how incontestably the <span class="roman">Acts of the Apostles</span> demonstrate the truth of christianity&#146;  (Allibone, <span class="italic">Dict.</span>, 1.194). Biscoe was presented to the vicarage of North Weald Bassett, near Epping in Essex, on 5 April 1738 by the bishop of London. He held both his livings until his death at North Weald Bassett on 8 June 1748, at the age of sixty. He was buried in the church there on 12 June 1748.<br>
