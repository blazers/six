<span class="headword">Baxter,  George</span>  (1804&#150;1867), <span class="occ">colour printer</span>, was born at 37 High Street, Lewes, Sussex, on 31 July 1804, the second son and second child in the family of three sons and three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1732/', "John Baxter (1781&#150;1858)")</script>, printer and bookseller, and his wife, Charlotte, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Warner. He spent his childhood in Lewes, attending the Cliffe House Academy and then the town's grammar school. After school he was apprenticed to a wood-engraver. In 1825 he moved to London and in 1827 settled in Islington. On 23 August 1827 he married his cousin Mary, daughter of Robert Harrild, manufacturer of printing machinery. They had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Over the next eight years Baxter applied himself to developing and perfecting the colour printing process which brought him international fame. In 1829 he produced his first coloured print, <span class="italic">Butterflies</span>, and achieved popular acclaim in 1834 with the coloured plates for <span class="italic">Feathered Tribes of the British Islands</span> by Robert Mudie. Baxter enjoyed a fruitful collaboration with Mudie and had illustrated thirteen of his books by 1844.<br>
<br>In 1836 Baxter received a royal patent for his printing process. His technique was innovatory, combining an engraved metal plate with as many as twenty engraved wooden blocks, each printed in a separate colour. The prints combined quality and cheapness and were produced in vast numbers. For the next twenty-five years Baxter dominated colour printing, branching out into a variety of publishing areas, including decorated music sheets, notepaper, pocket-books, and his famous needle cases. He claimed to have produced 20 million prints by the end of his career. Baxter's subjects were remarkably varied and included sentimental treatments of religious and romantic themes, prints of typical London figures, and newsworthy events. His piety led him to produce some of his most powerful work for the immensely influential and prosperous missionary societies. In collaboration with John Snow, Baxter worked for the London Missionary Society from 1837 to 1843, and in 1844&#150;5 with the Baptist and Wesleyan missionary societies. His most celebrated missionary print was <span class="italic">The Massacre of the Lamented Missionary, the Rev. J. Williams and Mr. Harris at Erromanga</span> (1841).<br>
<br>Had he restricted his output to such enterprises, Baxter would undoubtedly have become very wealthy; yet he suffered commercially throughout his career because of his perfectionism and over-ambition. It is ironic that his greatest financial disasters were projects which resulted from the interest which both Queen Victoria and Prince Albert showed in his work. The large prints which he brought out by royal command to commemorate the coronation and opening of the House of Commons in 1838 and the prints he produced, after Lord Brougham had arranged an interview with Albert, to commemorate the Great Exhibition of 1851, were hopelessly delayed and proved very expensive failures. Nevertheless, Baxter's work and his royal connections made him famous during the years directly following the Great Exhibition, and he gained public recognition for his achievements: he was awarded the great gold medal of Austria (1852), and medals for his exhibits at the Great Exhibitions in New York (1853) and Paris (1855), was elected a member of the Royal Society of Arts (1855), and received the grand gold medal of Sweden (1857). The years 1850&#150;55 were also those of his greatest commercial success. A single print, <span class="italic">The Madonna</span>, sold in excess of 700,000 copies.<br>
<br>By 1856, however, Baxter was in financial difficulties as a result of competition from rival companies, and because of photography's growing appeal. His markets were poached, and his temperament appeared to decline with his financial fortunes. He became increasingly embittered, alienating both his family and personal friends. In 1859 he produced his last print, <span class="italic">Dogs of St. Bernard</span>, and in 1865 he was declared bankrupt. After unsuccessful attempts to sell his enormous stock of prints through public auctions, he retired to his wife's house, suitably named The Retreat, at Peak Hill, Sydenham, London. In 1866 Baxter suffered a blow to the head in an omnibus accident; he never properly recovered, and he died at home on 11 January 1867. He was buried at Christ Church, Forest Hill, Sydenham, and was survived by his wife.<br>
