<span class="headword">McBride,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1650&#150;1718), <span class="occ">minister of the Presbyterian General Synod of Ulster and religious controversialist</span>, may have been the son of John McBryd, merchant, admitted a freeman of Belfast in 1644. He clearly came from Scottish stock but was almost certainly born in the north of Ireland, since on entering Glasgow University in 1666 he styled himself &#145;Hibernus&#146;. Having graduated in 1673 McBride was ordained in 1679 as minister of Clare, co. Armagh. In or before 1687 he had married Margaret (<i>d</i>. in or after 1718?), daughter of William Fairlie of Tullyreavy, co. Tyrone. They had three sons and a daughter, to whom McBride was a loving if heavy-handed and even irascible parent. He left in 1688 to take charge of the parish of Borgue in Kirkcudbrightshire, and attended the national assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1692. A popular preacher, rigorously orthodox, and with a sharp if heavily sardonic wit, he was called to Ayr in 1691, but the presbytery refused to translate him. By June 1694 he was back at Clare, and attending the General Synod of Ulster, and later that year succeeded Patrick Adair at Belfast. Through his friendship with the third earl of Donegal he was able to obtain a site for a new church in Rosemary Lane (subsequently Rosemary Street), to which the congregation removed in 1695.<br>
<br>McBride's intellectual capacity and force of character propelled him to the forefront of the Presbyterian community in Ireland. As early as 1695 he was involved in canvassing the Irish parliament in a vain attempt to secure a toleration act, and afterwards threw himself into the paper war over the issue ignited by the Dublin dissenting minister Joseph Boyse's <span class="italic">Case of the Dissenting Protestants of Ireland</span>. Boyse had been answered by three Anglican clergymen, bishops Pullein of Dromore and Dopping of Meath, and a future archbishop, Edward Synge, and McBride's <span class="italic">Animadversions on the Answer to the Case</span>, published in 1697, took issue with each of Boyse's detractors: the pamphlet was undeniably effective, if remorselessly ponderous. The same year he was elected moderator of the general synod. At the beginning of the next synod, in June 1698, he preached as outgoing moderator; the sermon, a strong defence of Presbyterian church organization and of synodical authority in particular, was deemed sufficiently important to be printed. The style, &#145;minister of Belfast&#146;, accorded him on the title-page, and a passage in which he appeared to claim that synods were legal even without the consent of the secular power, enraged Bishop Edward Walkington of Down and Connor, who alerted the Dublin government. As good whigs the lords justices were unwilling to prosecute, and instead McBride was summoned to a special hearing, presided over by the lord chancellor, John Methuen, assisted by the chief justices, and in the presence of six bishops. He successfully defended himself, pointing out that the composition of the title-page was not his responsibility, and that the offending passage of text had been qualified by a saving phrase. The lord chancellor was thus able to dismiss him with nothing more than an admonition to behave &#145;rectably&#146; for the future towards the established church.<br>
<br>McBride's stature among Ulster's Presbyterians was such that in 1700 the new patent for the <i>regium donum</i> (the royal grant towards the maintenance of ministers) was lodged with him for safe keeping. He plunged into print again in 1702 with a <span class="italic">Vindication of Marriage, as Solemnized by Presbyterians in the North of Ireland</span>, a point by point refutation of the case made by the established church, in pamphlets and lawsuits, against the legality of marriages performed by Presbyterian ministers. He had thus made himself a prime target for Anglican revenge when the passage of the English statute of 1703 imposing an abjuration oath in England and Ireland exposed him to prosecution. Together with two other ministers McBride refused the oath rather than (as he saw it) commit himself to uphold episcopacy, and swear to something he could not know, the Pretender's illegitimacy. As he explained to his old friend Sir Hans Sloane, &#145;my scrupling the oaths is not from the least disaffection to her Majesty's person or government&#146; but was a simple obedience to conscience, that &#145;incommunicable jewel, the loss whereof nothing can repair or requite&#146;  (BL, Sloane MS 4043, fol. 68). Fearing arrest he spent the winter of 1703&#150;4 in Scotland, where the abjuration did not apply, but was back in Belfast to attend the synod in June 1704. However, local tory magistrates eventually secured a warrant, and in 1705 he was obliged to take refuge again in Scotland. There is a story (the supposed evidence for which is still visible) that the mayor of Belfast, who came to arrest him, was so enraged at finding the bird flown that he drew his sword and stabbed the portrait of McBride which hung in the manse.<br>
<br>McBride remained in Glasgow until 1708, supplying the Blackfriars kirk but declining a chair in divinity at the university. He was chosen moderator of Glasgow presbytery in 1708. In the meantime the General Synod of Ulster had appointed James Kirkpatrick to assist him in Belfast, and then, following a petition from some of the elders, which McBride had at first endorsed, divided the congregation into two. There were factional, and perhaps, doctrinal tensions between the two churches (Kirkpatrick and his friends being associated with advanced theological and philosophical ideas), and a group of McBride's supporters disputed the practical arrangements which the synod had made for the division. Thinking himself safe under a whig viceroy, McBride returned to Ireland to help settle matters. He was duly discharged by magistrates at Carrickfergus in respect of the earlier warrant, but within two years his situation had once more deteriorated. There were quarrels with those other Presbyterian ministers who were prepared to take the oaths, and in summer 1710 some high-flying JPs, anticipating political changes in Ireland in the wake of the impeachment of the high-church clergyman, Henry Sacheverell, in England, took out new warrants against the nonjurors. McBride returned to Glasgow while appeals were made to the English ministry. He was sufficiently encouraged to reappear in Ireland, but withdrew for a third time in 1712 following a presentment against him by the co. Antrim grand jury.<br>
<br>In McBride's absence the general synod advised ministers to take the abjuration, but only &#145;if they have clearness to it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Records of the General Synod</span>, 1.283) and at the same time renewed an earlier appointment to McBride to write &#145;an history of this church&#146;  (ibid., 1.284), with Kirkpatrick to help him. What he produced was a polemical defence of the Presbyterians' political record against tory charges of disloyalty. The particular object of McBride's indignation was his neighbour in Belfast, the Church of Ireland parson William Tisdall, whose <span class="italic">Sample of Trew-Blue Presbyterian Loyalty</span> (1709) provided the occasion for his own reply, <span class="italic">A Sample of Jet-Black Pr&#151;Tic Calumny</span>, published anonymously in Glasgow in 1713. Although concerned with contemporary political developments (and from time to time defending himself, in the third person), he offered a typically learned and laborious disquisition, essentially historical in structure and argument and lacking the verve and incisiveness of his Anglican antagonist.<br>
<br>Despite being subject to an outstanding warrant McBride returned to Ireland for good in June 1713. Orders were given for his arrest but the sub-sheriff ignored them. After the Hanoverian succession McBride remained true to his principles and would not take the oaths to George I, but the authorities now left him alone. Although increasingly infirm and racked with gout he joined his fellow nonjuror Alexander McCracken in 1716&#150;17 in opposing moves to accept a legal toleration on any other basis than subscription to the Westminster confession, a prelude to the great controversy over subscription which would divide the general synod in 1720&#150;26. He died on 21 July 1718, &#145;aetatis suae 68&#146;, and was buried in Belfast on 23 July. His wife almost certainly outlived him. Their younger children were each left a guinea in his will, since, as he said, he had already during his lifetime adequately provided for them.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_17365"></a><span class="headword">Robert McBride</span>  (1686/7&#150;1759)<span class="occ"></span>, eldest son of John, was also educated at Glasgow. He was always intended for the ministry, and while still a probationer preached on the king's birthday in 1716 to the Belfast company of independent volunteers, a sermon which was subsequently printed. In September that year he was admitted as minister of Ballymoney, co. Antrim, where he stayed for the rest of his life and was remembered as the model of a conscientious and efficient pastor. A strong supporter of orthodox theology, and of the principle of subscription, he frequently clashed with the New Light faction in the general synod, and especially with his father's successor, Samuel Haliday. At one point he was sent over to Scotland to obtain the opinion of the general assembly, and on his return found himself accused of misrepresenting the views of the non-subscribers. In or before 1726 he married the daughter of a Mr Boyd of Killabeg, co. Down. They had a daughter and two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17360/', "David MacBride")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17362/', "John MacBride")</script>, both of whom joined the Royal Navy. In 1726 he contributed a pamphlet to the controversy, the <span class="italic">Overtures Transmitted by the General Synod, 1725, in a Fair Light</span>. In 1728 he was elected moderator. He died on 2 September 1759 in his seventy-third year, and was buried in Ballymoney churchyard. A memorial tablet inside the parish church described him as &#145;truly pious, always cheerful, moderate in his principles &hellip; universally beloved and lived in friendship with the good men of all persuasions&#146;  (Witherow, 211), perhaps in unconscious irony, in view of his father's long record of conflict with the established church.<br>
