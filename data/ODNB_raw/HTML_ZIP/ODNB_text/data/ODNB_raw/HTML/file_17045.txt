<span class="headword">Love,  William Edward</span>  (1806&#150;1867), <span class="occ">impressionist</span>, the son of a merchant in the city of London, was born in London on 6 February 1806, and was educated at Harlow in Essex and at Nelson House Academy, Wimbledon, Surrey. At the age of twelve, while still at school, he began to imitate the noises of machinery and other objects, and soon went on to mimic the sounds made by musical instruments, beasts, birds, and insects. From about 1820 to 1826 he was connected with London journalism, but he then turned his attention to the theatre, and in 1827 performed throughout England and France. One year later he appeared for a benefit in a solo entertainment at the Olympic Theatre entitled <span class="italic">The False Alarm</span>, a performance whose success, it was said, led to his professional career in the theatre. Thereafter he became renowned as the best ventriloquist in England; he assumed various characters, making rapid changes in dress while talking, singing, and displaying remarkable powers of mimicry and ventriloquism.<br>
<br>In June 1829, at the start of his theatrical career, Love produced and appeared solo in <span class="italic">The Peregrinations of a Polyphonist</span>, with which he toured major English towns. He then went to Scotland, where in 1830 he brought out <span class="italic">Love in a Labyrinth, or, The Adventures of a Day</span>, and in 1833 he opened at Oxford with a piece called <span class="italic">Ignes fatui</span>. In 1834 he made his first appearance in London, and acted at the City of London assembly rooms, Bishopsgate Street, for several months. Over the following years he divided his time between touring in France, America, and the West Indies, and performing in London in such theatres as the Strand, Almack's, and the Hanover Square Rooms. On 26 December 1854 he took possession of the Upper Hall, 69 Quadrant, Regent Street, London, where he produced <span class="italic">The London Season</span>. On 8 February 1856 Love played at the Regent Gallery for the 300th consecutive night, which was reputed to be his 2406th performance in London. In 1858 he became paralysed and, in keeping with the professional benevolence of the time, his colleagues at Sadler's Wells organized a benefit for him. He died at his home, 33 Arundel Street, Strand, on 16 March 1867.<br>
