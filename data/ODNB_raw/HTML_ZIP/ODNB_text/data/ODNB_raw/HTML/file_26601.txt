<span class="headword">Story,  Thomas</span>  (1670?&#150;1742), <span class="occ">Quaker minister and journal writer</span>, was born at Justice Town, Kirklinton, near Carlisle, Cumberland, the son of Thomas Story (1630?&#150;1721?) of Justice Town and Thomasin Constable (<i>d</i>. 1674/5). Thomas's siblings included a brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26597/', "George Warter Story")</script>, dean of Limerick, and a sister, Ann Elliot. Story became proficient in music and fencing, and studied at Carlisle grammar school. He continued to work with the nonconformist minister Richard Gilpin, who trained him in law. As Story reached adulthood he began to question Anglican beliefs and practices. Already disappointed with corrupt churchmen, his near-death and visionary episodes made Story give up his sword and musical instruments and seek out dissenters in search of religious truth. Finding little comfort with Presbyterians, Story attended a Broughton Quaker meeting in 1691, where he felt immersed in the presence of God. Story made his conversion public when he refused to take an oath on behalf of a Friend. Story thus disqualified himself from practising law in England's courts and upset his father, who worried that Story could not make a decent living.<br>
<br>In 1692 Story began his life as an itinerant preacher by quietly accompanying noted ministers such as Andrew Taylor, John Bowstead, and Thomas Rudd as they travelled across England and then in Scotland, where particularly rowdy crowds taunted the Quakers. When they returned to England, Story overcame his trepidation to preach in public, and by 1695 Story was certain public ministry was his primary calling. He informed his father that he would leave home permanently and refused his offer to manage the family's lands. Story headed for London, where William Penn took him under his wing and recommended him as a clerk and record keeper for the London quarterly meeting. In 1696 Story once again travelled through England and Scotland, using his legal training and knowledge of logic to construct strong defences of Quaker doctrines. He explained to the countess of Carlisle why women should be allowed to preach, and argued with an episcopalian over the practice of baptism. Back in London, Story met Peter the Great and presented him with a copy of Robert Barclay's <span class="italic">Apology</span>. The Russian tsar asked Story about Quaker principles, particularly the Quaker refusal to bear arms; Peter was so intrigued by the religious dissenters that he attended several Quaker meetings.<br>
<br>As the century drew to a close, Story began to minister even further afield. In 1698 he accompanied Penn to Ireland, where they met with government officials, held religious meetings, and spoke up against Roman Catholicism. Soon after returning to London, Story left with Roger Gill for America and reached the Chesapeake in 1699. For more than fifteen years Story ministered widely in America, attending meetings from New England to North Carolina. During his peregrinations he addressed many colonial issues. Story preached to Africans and argued that it was wrong to enslave any Christian. Although Story described Native Americans as &#145;enemies&#146;, he also believed they could be enlightened, and compared them favourably to many Europeans. When Story travelled along war zones he refused to seek protection in forts; he also argued that Quakers should not have to serve as soldiers, and worked towards the release of imprisoned Quakers. But most of all Story sought to maintain Quaker discipline in the colonies. He condemned &#145;ranters&#146; who disturbed meetings with &#145;ridiculous noises&#146; and &#145;wet Quakers&#146; who &#145;remained carnally minded&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Life of Thomas Story</span>, 121). He took on the Quaker schismatic George Keith, as well as Congregationalists and Baptists, often using his knowledge of Greek and the <span class="roman">Bible</span> to stump his opponents. Story weathered a Philadelphia epidemic that killed &#145;six, seven, sometimes eight a day for several weeks together&#146;, but his companion Gill did not survive the 1699 scourge.<br>
<br>In 1701 Penn asked Story to represent his interests in America while he returned to England to defend his colony against an anti-proprietary bill. Penn assigned Story to the council, made him the &#145;keeper of the Great Seal, Master of the Rolls for recording patents, and for the enrolling of deeds&#146;, and appointed him treasurer of the Pennsylvania Land Company. Story agreed to serve in Pennsylvania's troubled government because &#145;the affairs of [Pennsylvania] were greatly embarrassed&#146; largely due to the work of anti-proprietary factions  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Life of Thomas Story</span>, 134). On 10 July 1706 Story married Ann Shippen (<i>d</i>. 1710), the daughter of noted Philadelphia merchant and politician Edward Shippen. Although Story planted roots in Pennsylvania, he continued to travel in the ministry and undertook a voyage to the Caribbean between 1709 and 1710. After visiting Barbados and Jamaica, which Story described as a place &#145;baptized in hell&#146;, his ship was captured by French privateers. In Martinique he disputed with Jesuits and discussed political principles with the governor. By 1710 Story was back in Philadelphia attending the Quaker yearly meeting. Thirty letters between Story and Ann detail his ministerial travels and her home life during this period. Childless, Ann died soon after Story returned, on 19 August 1710.<br>
<br>In 1714 Story journeyed again to the Caribbean and then returned to England. In the following year he travelled abroad with the historian William Sewel to the Netherlands and Germany, where some cities closed their doors to strangers to prevent the spread of plague. In 1716 he then went to Ireland, where the bishop of Ossory ordered a brief arrest. And in 1720 he served time in the Fleet prison in London for not taking an oath of affirmation. After his release Story was accused of unfair land dealings in Pennsylvania, but an arbitration court in London exonerated him. In 1726 fellow traveller and minister Ann Gooch charged Story with attempted seduction. In its investigation the London yearly meeting acquitted him due to lack of evidence. Later in life, he lobbied government leaders and church officials for Quaker interests, he tended to business on the family's Justice Town estate, purchased from his brother's widow, and he built an experimental nursery to replenish England's dwindling forests. Story continued to travel widely throughout England and Scotland. His worst reception was at Oxford University, where the scholars &#145;were the rudest, most giddy and unruly rabble&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Life of Thomas Story</span>, 323). But whether at Oxford or in Scotland the crowds became more sober towards the end of his career. Several of Story's sermons, which often focused on the &#145;kingdom of Christ in this world&#146;, were recorded, published (contrary to Quaker practice), and approved by him. Story died in 1742, possibly on 23 June, after suffering from a &#145;paralytic disorder&#146;  (ibid., 361). He was buried at the Quaker burial-ground on Fisher Street in Carlisle. He left a substantial estate in England and America, the residue of which was to be used to print his journal (unusually for a major eighteenth-century Quaker journal, in Newcastle upon Tyne, not London). His primary benefactors were his sister, his nieces, and the Shippens in Pennsylvania. He also made charitable contributions to Carlisle's meeting and to educate Quaker children in Clerkenwell.<br>
