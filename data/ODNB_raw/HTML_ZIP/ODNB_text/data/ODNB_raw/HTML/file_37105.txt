<span class="headword">Alexis Master</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1120&#150;<em>c.</em>1140), <span class="occ">manuscript artist</span>, was active at St Albans Abbey, and probably at Bury St Edmunds Abbey, in the 1120s and 1130s. The name &#145;Alexis Master&#146;, first coined in German by the art historian Adolph Goldschmidt, derives from the illustrations of the life of St Alexis which this artist contributed to the great St Albans psalter now in Hildesheim Cathedral. Otto P&auml;cht suggested that the Alexis Master should be identified as Anketil, a monk-goldsmith of St Albans Abbey, who completed a new shrine for the relics of St Alban in 1129 and spent part of his career at the Danish court as royal moneyer; this identification, however, has not met with general acceptance. C. R. Dodwell proposed that the Alexis Master was a secular artist hired by Geoffrey of Gorham, abbot of St Albans between 1119 and 1146.<br>
<br>The surviving corpus of the Alexis Master's work comprises historiated initials, full-page paintings, and tinted drawings. It is believed to span six manuscripts, being concentrated in two: the St Albans psalter, and the life and miracles of St Edmund in the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York. His chief monument is his work in the St Albans psalter: forty full-page prefatory paintings illustrating the life of Christ and other subjects; tinted drawings of the life of St Alexis and of Christ at Emmaus; the historiated initial at the beginning of <span class="roman">Psalm 1</span>; and under-drawings for other historiated initials. Made in the 1120s, the manuscript was originally intended for the St Albans monastic community. During production, or soon afterwards, the Alexis Master adapted it for the use of the recluse Christina of Markyate by adding the Alexis and Emmaus drawings, intended to echo incidents in Christina's own life.<br>
<br>The master probably travelled to Bury St Edmunds Abbey at some time between 1130 and 1135 to provide the cycle of thirty-two full-page pictures which prefaces the New York manuscript. These pictures illustrate the life, passion, and posthumous miracles of the Anglo-Saxon martyr-king Edmund. The sacrifice of formal organization to dramatic tension in the pictures has raised doubts about their attribution to the Alexis Master, but this characteristic can probably be ascribed to the natural evolution of his style.<br>
<br>The Alexis Master's full-page narrative pictures show stylistic and iconographic links with Anglo-Saxon and Ottonian art and the monumental art of Italy, which he may have visited. His pictures represent a new departure in post-conquest English manuscript art, which until his time had been largely confined to decorative initials. Through his stimulus, the art of pictorial narrative experienced a major revival in twelfth-century England. His style was inherited and perpetuated at St Albans, Bury St Edmunds, Canterbury, and Winchester. Apart perhaps from Master Hugo of Bury St Edmunds, he was the most influential English artist of his generation.<br>
