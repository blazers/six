<span class="headword">Douglas,  Philip</span>  (1758&#150;1822), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born at Witham, Essex, on 27 September 1758, one of the family of six sons and five daughters of Archibald Douglas (1707&#150;1778) and Elizabeth, daughter of Edmund Burchard of Witham. His father was colonel of the 13th dragoons and sat as MP for Dumfries Boroughs (1754&#150;61) and for Dumfriesshire (1761&#150;74). Philip was educated at Harrow School, where he was a scholar in 1777, and matriculated from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, at Michaelmas 1778. He graduated BA in 1781, when he was third in the second class of the mathematical tripos, and won the members' prize in 1782; he proceeded MA (1784), BD (1792), and DD (1795). He was elected fellow of his college in 1782 and joint tutor in 1787, and proctor of the university in 1788.<br>
<br>Ordained deacon on 26 May 1782 and priest on 10 November 1783, Douglas was made curate of Whittlesford, Cambridgeshire, in 1785. From 1 January 1795 he was master of his college, an office that he held until his death; he twice served as vice-chancellor of the university, in 1795&#150;6 and 1810&#150;11. In 1796 he was presented by the crown, on the recommendation of William Pitt, then MP for the university, to the vicarage of Gedney, Lincolnshire. On 15 June 1797 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1809), daughter of Anthony Mainwaring, of Shirrall Hall, Staffordshire, and niece of Dr Mainwaring, Lady Margaret professor of divinity. In the same year he was defeated by Thomas Kerrich in the election for principal librarian of the university.<br>
<br>By that time Douglas lived almost entirely in his lodgings, confined by poor health and the loss of sight in one eye. Despite his infirmities he presided over the installation of the duke of Gloucester as chancellor of the university in 1811, and in his address drew attention to the fact that the duke was the first of the Hanoverian dynasty to have been educated at the university. He also warmly praised the duke's support for the movement to abolish the slave trade. Douglas died in college, after a short illness, on 2 January 1822, aged sixty-three, and was buried in the chapel. He was survived by two of his children, Philip William and Mary.<br>
