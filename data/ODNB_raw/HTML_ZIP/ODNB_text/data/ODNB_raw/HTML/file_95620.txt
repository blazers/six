<span class="headword">Weir,  James</span>  (1842/3&#150;1920), <span class="occ">engineer and inventor</span>, was born near Airdrie, Lanarkshire, the fourth of the five children of James Weir, a farmer, and Jean Bishop, who was the child of Bess, the eldest and illegitimate daughter of the poet Robert Burns. No record of his exact date of birth has been found, though he was said to be thirty-two at his marriage on 3 June 1875. Following the early death of Weir senior, the family moved to Glasgow, where James attended school. Aged fifteen, he was sent to work in the offices of Hamilton and Grandison, consulting engineers in Glasgow. Following this, in 1860 he was formally apprenticed as an engineer to Randolph, Elder &amp; Co. in Govan. To raise the requisite 5<i>s</i>. a week for three years for the apprenticeship, his mother turned to needlework and dressmaking but she may also have received financial help from her eldest son, George, who was a ship's engineer. Randolph, Elder &amp; Co. was at the leading edge of marine engineering in the 1850s and 1860s, and Weir served his apprenticeship under both the original partners. He immediately showed inventiveness and skill as an engineer, and the firm gave him every encouragement, allowing him to patent a new marine governor and to supervise its construction at Smith Bros &amp; Co. This was the first of many inventions by Weir; it was fitted to the SS <i>Garland</i>, and the original model was exhibited by the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland.<br>
<br>When his apprenticeship ended in 1865 Weir went to sea as an engineer, serving first on the Sligo steamer <i>Liverpool</i>, then on the Bibby Line steamer <i>Arabian</i> that plied between Liverpool and the eastern Mediterranean. Promoted to first engineer, he left the <i>Arabian</i> in August 1870 to join the <i>Oporto</i> and subsequently the <i>Princess Royal</i>, on which George Weir, his elder brother, also served as an engineer. This was Weir's last posting and after he signed off in June 1871 he made only one more working sea voyage, as first engineer of the <i>Queen Anne</i>, owned by R. and J. Craig of Glasgow, in May 1874. From this ship he deserted after only six days, presumably following some quarrel with the ship's master.<br>
<br>While on the <i>Princess Royal</i> Weir had taken out patents for various improvements to steam machinery, and in 1871 or 1872 he went into partnership with his brother, George, as the consulting engineers G. and J. Weir and Co. The firm was based first in Liverpool but moved in 1873 to Glasgow, probably partly due to family financial reasons. At Kilmaurs on 3 June 1875 Weir married Mary Douglas Richmond (1848&#150;1931), the daughter of William Douglas, blacksmith; she had been left well off by the death of her former husband, a bonnet maker from Kilmarnock under contract with the War Office for soldiers' headgear. Her financial contribution to the young company, and desire to stay near her family, may have clinched the decision to move to Glasgow. She brought James Weir a stepson, John Ritchie Richmond, and with him had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Glasgow at that time was well on its way to being the major British and world centre of shipbuilding. Weir's genius lay in inventing and designing auxiliary devices that addressed particular marine power plant problems, and marketing them adroitly to the shipbuilders. His 1874 hydrokineter used nozzle injectors to promote circulation in ship engine boilers, reducing the time taken to raise steam. It continued in use for about sixty years. Between 1880 and 1886 he produced three more major inventions that laid the foundation of both the new company's success and Weir's fortune. The first was a device to use excess steam to heat the feed water before it entered a steam boiler, so removing the air and limescale that caused boiler corrosion and scaling. The concept of &#145;regenerative feed heating&#146; is still applied in steam plants of the twenty-first century to improve the thermal economy of the system.<br>
<br>Feed heating was indispensable at a time in Glasgow when, with the greater use of steel in construction and the adoption of triple-expansion engines, the shipbuilding industry was growing fast. While other inventors had proposed components of the feed system, Weir was the first to combine his own inventions into a unified solution to the feed water problem. His pump for the hot feed water was produced with few design changes into the 1960s, and his evaporator for distilling sea water into the fresh water needed for the boiler helped make the great passenger liners possible by increasing the range that ships could travel before taking on extra water.<br>
<br>As the Weir company had no plant of its own, all manufacturing was subcontracted. However, by 1886 the Weir brothers had accumulated enough capital to set up the Holm foundry at Cathcart, which was at that time a village on the outskirts of Glasgow. The foundry was among the first factories to use electricity in running its machines, and the company adopted an enlightened employment approach for its time, awarding performance bonuses to its workers.<br>
<br>Weir brought his stepson, John Richmond, into the business in 1889 as office manager, and his elder son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36818/', "William Douglas Weir, later first Viscount Weir")</script> of Eastwood, was apprenticed in 1893 with a view to his eventually joining the management too. For more effective business practice, in 1895 the partnership was replaced by a private limited company, G. and J. Weir Ltd. James Weir remained as chairman and largest shareholder, but George Weir, whose formerly cordial relations with James had cooled, took this opportunity to sell his shareholding to his brother and retire to Australia.<br>
<br>The Royal Navy had great demand for the kind of auxiliary equipment that Weir could provide, so he was careful to cultivate a close relationship with the Admiralty's engineer-in-chief, Sir John Durston, and his subordinates. The architect of this relationship was William Weir, who joined the board of the company in 1898 at the age of twenty-one. James Weir was requested by the engineer-in-chief himself to design a high-pressure feed pump to compete with a new French model. He also took out four further patents for various aspects of water-tube boiler design at this time.<br>
<br>In 1903, contemplating retirement, Weir bought the estate of Over Courance in Dumfriesshire, where he built a house to his own design. He started making lengthy and leisurely tours abroad and developed an interest in agricultural improvement, to which he brought the originality of mind that he had formerly applied to marine engineering problems. He sold his shares to his sons and retired as chairman in 1910, but continued to offer technical consultancy to the firm. He left his company in a healthy condition: the Holm foundry had grown from a single building employing forty men, to a works covering 13 acres and employing 1450.<br>
<br>Throughout his career James Weir was active in various professional bodies promoting engineering: he was vice-president of the Institute of Marine Engineers, a member of the Institute of Naval Architects, and on the council of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland. He wrote two small treatises, <span class="italic">Terrestrial Energy</span> and <span class="italic">Steam Engine Efficiency</span> (1891), and in his retirement he published <span class="italic">The Energy System of Matter: a Deduction from Terrestrial Energy Phenomena</span> (1912).<br>
<br>Inventive genius, good design, specialization, and an appreciation of the need to balance business risk in a buoyant but fickle market had made James Weir's success. He died at Over Courance on 10 July 1920, leaving an estate valued at over &pound;500,000.<br>
<br>Weir's name lives on in the international Weir Group of companies (which still maintains a business in Cathcart) and the Weir chair of thermodynamics and fluid mechanics, established since 1968 at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow. This university also houses a major part of its engineering faculty in the James Weir building.<br>
