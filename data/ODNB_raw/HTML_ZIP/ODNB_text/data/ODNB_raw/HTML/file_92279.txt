<span class="headword">Wilkins, Sir  Graham John <span class="st"> [Bob]</span></span>  (1924&#150;2003), <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, was born in Mudford, Somerset, on 22 January 1924, the son of George William Wilkins, the village schoolmaster, and his wife, Annie May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clarke. An elder sister (out of six children), unable to pronounce Graham, called him as an infant &#145;the beautiful Bobby&#146;, and he remained Bob for life. A scholarship pupil at Yeovil grammar school, he went on to study chemistry and mathematics at the University College of the South-West, Exeter. In 1944 he graduated and met Daphne Mildred Haynes, daughter of Charles Haynes, provision merchant. They married on 14 July the following year, when both were aged twenty-one.<br>
<br>On graduation Wilkins had been directed into wartime scientific work with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, subsequently British Petroleum, but in 1945 he left to join the Beecham Group as a research chemist. For four years he tested the properties of Macleans toothpaste, Lucozade, and shampoos. Deciding that he was &#145;better at managing people than molecules&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Observer</span>), he was dispatched at short notice to turn round a failing toothpaste factory in India. From 1954 to 1959 he ran the group's operations in the western hemisphere, building factories in Latin America. Meanwhile Beecham had, under Leslie Lazell as chairman, developed the world's first semi-synthetic penicillins. Lazell needed to oversee the creation of an organization to market these new products, and brought Wilkins home for that purpose. In Britain, Wilkins set up a team of representatives to canvass doctors, and made licensing arrangements in overseas countries until such time as he could create the company's own sales branches. He thus played a key role in transforming Beecham, until then famed as the maker of pills, powders, and household products, into a fully-fledged pharmaceutical enterprise.<br>
<br>As head of Beecham's newly created pharmaceutical division from 1964 onwards, Wilkins established manufacturing units in locations as far apart as Scotland, Belgium, and Singapore. Appointed executive vice-chairman in 1974 by Sir Ronald Edwards, Lazell's successor, he took over from Edwards as chairman in the following year. A committed Conservative, he vigorously opposed Labour's threat to nationalize selected UK pharmaceutical companies and also campaigned against official price controls, with enhanced authority as the former president of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry from 1969 to 1971. Supportive (with reservations) of the post-1979 Thatcher government, he accepted a knighthood in 1980 for services to exports.<br>
<br>As chairman of Beecham from 1975 to 1984, Wilkins encountered a number of problems. Although he launched the popular antibiotic Augmentin in 1971, no comparable new drugs followed during his period of office. Hence the pharmaceutical division's share of total turnover declined from 38 to 28 per cent and of profits from 61 to 47 per cent. He approved the acquisition of numerous companies, but those were largely on the consumer goods side, too many in non-core activities such as home improvements. Since the pharmaceutical and consumer product divisions had so little in common with one another, he was unable to enforce a unified corporate strategy. In 1984, at the age of sixty, he took early retirement (though he remained president of the Beecham Group), so as to devote more time to family life, golf, travel on Britain's waterways and abroad, and enjoyment of good food and wine.<br>
<br>Wilkins kept on his outside directorships, most notably of the merchant bank Hill Samuel. Appointed deputy chairman of the electrical giant Thorn EMI (of which he had been a director since 1978), he was dismayed when his chairman, Peter Laister, made a number of policy miscalculations which in 1985 reduced profits by 30 per cent and halved the share price. In arguably the most dramatic boardroom coup in British industry for some years, the non-executive directors ousted Laister and appointed Wilkins as chairman. He overhauled Thorn EMI's unwieldy organization by selling off non-core businesses, acquiring more profitable defence and electronic companies, and instilling into that production-orientated group the kind of marketing drive he had encouraged in Beecham. He retired from Thorn EMI in 1989; he was already chairman (from 1986 to 1990) of the Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration Board. To address the contentious issue of the long hours worked by junior hospital doctors, he persuaded the government to authorize double payments for excessive hours on call or standby duty. In 1994 he was made honorary fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and of the University of London school of pharmacy.<br>
<br>In 1989 Wilkins's wife died, and on 26 April the following year he married Helen Catherine McGregor, a co-ordinator in the International Chamber of Commerce, of which he had been chairman from 1985 to 1989. She was the daughter of Ian Robert McGregor, company director. There were no children of either marriage. A well-built man whose calmness under pressure and complete integrity won him widespread trust, Wilkins was the image of a reassuring country doctor. Yet he could be forceful and decisive, undoubtedly showing those qualities to greater effect in Thorn EMI than in Beecham. He died on 2 July 2003 of heart failure in Ashford Hospital, Stanwell, Surrey. He was survived by his second wife, Helen.<br>
