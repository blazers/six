<span class="headword">FitzClarence, Lord  Adolphus</span>  (1802&#150;1856), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Bushy Park, Middlesex, on 18 February 1802, the seventh child and fourth son in the illegitimate family of five sons and five daughters of William, duke of Clarence, later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29451/', "William IV (1765&#150;1837)")</script>, and the comic actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15119/', "Dorothy Jordan (1761&#150;1816)")</script>. He attended a boarding-school in Sunbury before being sent to sea in 1813 at the age of eleven on the <i>Impregnable</i>. He served as a midshipman on the <i>Newcastle</i> on the North American station, and subsequently in the Mediterranean. He received his commission in 1821 and served on the <i>Euryalus</i>; in May 1823 he was made commander, and served on the <i>Brisk</i> and the <i>Redwing</i> on the North Sea station. In December 1826 he was made captain, and commanded the <i>Ariadne</i> (1826), the <i>Challenger</i> (1827), and the <i>Pallas</i> (1828). On William IV's accession in 1830 he took command of the royal yacht, which position he retained under both his father and Queen Victoria, until he was promoted to flag rank in September 1853.<br>
<br>FitzClarence was devoted to his mother, who inspired his great love of the theatre: he was involved in founding the Garrick Club. As an illegitimate son of the eventual king, FitzClarence was in a difficult social situation, although few took their objections to the &#145;b&acirc;tards&#146; to the extent of the duchess of Kent, who left the room whenever any of the FitzClarences entered. With his brothers, he badgered the king to give them titles, official positions, and funds. In May 1831 he was granted the title and precedence of a younger son of a marquess, and in the following year he became GCH. In addition to the command of the royal yacht, he was appointed groom of the robes (1830&#150;33) and lord of the bedchamber (1833&#150;7). On Victoria's accession Lord Adolphus was pleasantly surprised to find himself retained as commander of the royal yacht and his allowance continued; Victoria reported that he &#145;burst into tears, and said it was unexpected, for they did not dare to hope for anything&#146;  (Esher, 1.261). In 1848 he became additionally naval aide-de-camp to the queen, an office he retained until his death, unmarried, on 17 May 1856 at Newburgh Priory, near Easingwold, Yorkshire.<br>
