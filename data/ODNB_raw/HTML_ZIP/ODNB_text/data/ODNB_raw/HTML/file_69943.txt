<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Musard family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1070&#150;<em>c.</em>1330), <span class="occ">gentry</span>, with land in Gloucestershire and Derbyshire, was of Breton origin, probably from the seigneuries of Dol-Combour and Foug&egrave;res in north-east Brittany. In 1086 three Musards, perhaps brothers, held land in England. <a name="cosubject_69939"></a><span class="headword">Hascoit Musard</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1086&#150;<em>c.</em>1100)<span class="occ"></span>, probably the eldest, was a tenant-in-chief holding a little under 89 hides across six counties, of which just over 67 hides were retained in demesne and valued at &pound;75. The most significant collection of manors lay in Gloucestershire, but there were also demesne manors in Derbyshire (where his acquisitions probably began <i>c</i>.1070), Warwickshire, Berkshire, and Oxfordshire; principal residences emerged at Greenhampstead (or &#145;la Musarder&#146;, now Miserden), Gloucestershire, where by 1146 there was a motte and bailey castle, ruinous in 1289, and at Staveley in Derbyshire; both of these were referred to as the <i>caput</i> of the Musard barony. Few details survive of Hascoit's life and career, but he appears to have lived into the early years of Henry I's reign. The <span class="italic">Liber Eliensis</span> records a tradition of his devotion to St Etheldreda and the monks of Ely, whose community he entered as a monk, and to whom he granted a manor named &#145;Estona&#146;, probably Aston Somerville, Gloucestershire.<br>
<br>Hascoit was succeeded by his son, <a name="cosubject_69940"></a><span class="headword">Robert [i] Musard</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1100&#150;1146)<span class="occ"></span>, who by the 1140s appears to have been a supporter of the Empress Matilda against King Stephen. In 1146 he was captured and, threatened with hanging, surrendered his castle, presumably Miserden, to Philip, son of the earl of Gloucester. Robert endowed the church of St Mary, Monmouth, and either he or his father granted tithes to Tewkesbury Abbey. There are references to a Richard Musard, but it is not clear if he was Robert's son or brother; however, it was to Richard's son, <a name="cosubject_69941"></a><span class="headword">Hascuil Musard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1185/6)<span class="occ"></span>, that the family estate descended in 1161/2. In 1166 Hascuil held twelve fees of the old enfeoffment, to which had been added since 1135 a half fee, a one-fifteenth fee, and two fees held in dower by the widow of Richard Musard. He made several religious endowments, including grants to the Premonstratensian abbey at Welbeck in Nottinghamshire, to the Cistercian house of Louth Park in Lincolnshire, and for a community at Birley in Derbyshire, while, in celebration of their marriage, Hascuil and his wife, Joan, between 1162 and 1182 gave half the advowson of Staveley church to the knights hospitallers and their Derbyshire preceptory at Yeaveley. Hascuil seems to have had a particular affection for the hospitallers, making further grants to them which included a part of the Miserden estate, given to the preceptory at Quenington, Gloucestershire. This interest in the military orders was maintained by several Musard tenants in the late twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and by Hascuil's grandson Robert.<br>
<br>Hascuil Musard left a widow and young heir in the custody of the sheriff of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, who in 1185&#150;6 accounted for &pound;60 for the farm of Hascuil's lands. In 1190 Hascuil's son, <a name="cosubject_69943"></a><span class="headword">Sir Ralph [i] Musard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1230)<span class="occ"></span>, owed &pound;100 for his lands, and for the right to marry as he wished. Recorded as holding fifteen fees in 1205, by 1216 he was a member of the affinity of William (I) Marshal, earl of Pembroke, and as one of his household knights is reported to have encouraged him to accept charge of the kingdom during the minority of Henry III. Sheriff of Gloucestershire between 1215 and 1225, Sir Ralph served regularly as a justice itinerant during the 1220s. He must have married at least twice, for his sons, Robert [ii] and Ralph [ii], were born at least thirteen years before his marriage <i>c</i>.1220 to Isabel, the widow of John de Neville. She died in 1228, Sir Ralph being allowed access to her inheritance except where this was lands that she had held in chief. Sir Ralph himself died in late June 1230. Like his father, he supported Welbeck Abbey with grants from Staveley and their other Derbyshire lands. He, and later his son Ralph [ii], also endowed Welbeck's daughter house at Beauchief, where Sir Ralph joined the community shortly before his death, and where he was buried. Isabel, however, left her body to St Nicholas, Exeter.<br>
<br>Shortly before Sir Ralph's death there appears to have been a family quarrel in which his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_69944"></a><span class="headword">Robert [ii] Musard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1239)<span class="occ"></span>, seized the castle of Miserden. The sheriff restored the castle to Sir Ralph, but he died soon afterwards, and in September 1230 Robert took possession of his inheritance, although the castle was temporarily retained in royal custody. His family's links with the earls of Pembroke remained important, and when Richard Marshal rebelled in 1233, abortive orders were given to raze Musard's castle, while his lands were taken into royal hands. But a promise of faithful service soon led to their restoration; they included lands in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, part of the dower rights of Robert's wife, Juliana (whose former married name was Vavassur).<br>
<br>Robert [ii] died in 1239, his son and heir, Ralph [iii], <i>c</i>.1247, when his inheritance passed to his uncle, <a name="cosubject_69945"></a><span class="headword">Ralph [ii] Musard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1264)<span class="occ"></span>. At the time of his death, this Ralph had lands valued at &pound;74, and was survived by several children and a widow, Christiana, who was still alive in 1296&#150;7. His eldest son, <a name="cosubject_69946"></a><span class="headword">Ralph [iv] Musard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1234&#150;1272)<span class="occ"></span>, was among those who joined the Montfortian faction in the barons' war. He was admitted to the king's peace in December 1266, on condition of future good behaviour, though he temporarily lost some of his lands to the royalist Alan (II), or perhaps Adam, de Plugenet, regaining them by payments under the dictum of Kenilworth. In 1272 Henry III pardoned him &pound;75 owed for the redemption of lands in Berkshire, not wanting any harm to come to Ralph. When he died his estate was valued at a little over &pound;52, of which his widow, Matilda, received interests in Saintbury, and the manor of Siddington. She later married Thomas Trailli, <i>c</i>.1301.<br>
<br>By the mid- and late thirteenth century the financial position of the Musards had become increasingly difficult. The Domesday demesne had become significantly reduced, largely as a result of subinfeudation, concentrating the demesne manors in Derbyshire and Gloucestershire. Here too there was some subinfeudation, and to this was added the pressure of dower settlements. By 1230 Ralph [i] had run up numerous debts, for which his executors were being held responsible in 1231&#150;3, and by 1266 Ralph [iv] owed money to the Jewish financiers of Worcester. The demands made under the dictum cannot have eased matters, and it is possible that the Gloucestershire manor of Eyford, which seems to disappear from the Musard estate by 1273, was sold as a result. It was certainly the case that in 1269 Ralph [iv] Musard agreed to demise the important manor of Staveley to Peter of Chester for a term of seventeen years, in return for which Peter acquitted Ralph of all his debts to the Jewish moneylenders of London, Worcester, and elsewhere, and paid a further &pound;40 in addition. Ralph [iv]'s heir, <a name="cosubject_69947"></a><span class="headword">John Musard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1267&#150;1289)<span class="occ"></span>, a minor when his father died, became a ward of the king, who exploited his rights to the full. John was finally given seisin of his lands in December 1287, but had died by 7 February 1289. His three demesne manors of Saintbury, Miserden, and Staveley were together valued around &pound;53, of which Staveley was by far the most valuable, at a little under &pound;38. By the late thirteenth century there had been a shift in the relative values of the demesnes, the role of the Gloucestershire manors diminishing in value by comparison with the key Derbyshire manor of Staveley.<br>
<br>John was succeeded by his uncle, <a name="cosubject_69948"></a><span class="headword">Nicholas Musard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1240&#150;1300), a <span class="occ">clerk</span> in orders, who was granted his lands in April 1289, and was the last in the legitimate Musard line. He had at least three sons and two daughters, but as he was rector of Staveley these children were illegitimate and thereby discounted from the inheritance, which at the time of his death, by December 1300, had been further reduced to the manor of Staveley, valued at a little under &pound;35. This was divided between his three sisters or their offspring. Nevertheless, Nicholas made provision for his children. In 1298/9 he gave lands in Staveley to his daughter Christiana and he conveyed Miserden to his son <a name="cosubject_69950"></a><span class="headword">Malcolm Musard</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1296&#150;<em>c.</em>1330)<span class="occ"></span>, who in turn granted the manor in 1296/7 to Hugh Despenser the elder, a grant which Nicholas confirmed in 1297/8. Similarly, Nicholas enfeoffed Malcolm with Saintbury, which in April 1300 Malcolm was pardoned for having entered without licence, and allowed to retain. However, in 1303 Malcolm obtained a licence to alienate this manor in mortmain to Evesham Abbey.<br>
<br>Neither of these grants by Malcolm stands in isolation. He perhaps saw ties with Hugh Despenser as a means of securing his future. By 1302/3 he had assigned the reversion of the manor of Siddington, held for life by Thomas Trailli and his wife, Matilda Musard, to Hugh, and he also granted to him various other lands and rents. He was a member of Hugh's retinue in 1305, owed him 100 marks in 1306, and as an adherent of Despenser was to have his lands confiscated in 1327. In 1311 Evesham Abbey was pardoned for having acquired a knight's fee in Aston Somerville from Malcolm in mortmain, without royal licence, while in 1316 the abbey also received lands in Warwickshire from him.<br>
<br>Malcolm Musard illustrates well the propensity for some early fourteenth-century gentry to further their prospects and careers by violence. He can be linked with offences of poaching, theft, assault, intimidation, and extortion, sometimes leading in person the gang of associates that did his bidding. He became chief forester of Feckenham, where he had scope to continue his activities, and he fulfilled a number of royal commissions, including keeper of Hanley Castle in 1321. Last recorded in 1330, he was probably dead by 1333.<br>
<br>The Musard family's arms are listed as gules three roundels argent.<br>
