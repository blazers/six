<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  Thomas  fitz John</span>, second earl of Kildare  (<em>d.</em> 1328), <span class="occ">justiciar of Ireland</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9645/', "John fitz Thomas Fitzgerald, the first earl (d. 1316)")</script>, and his wife, Blanche de Roche (<i>d</i>. in or after 1331), and was therefore generally called Thomas fitz John. On 16 August 1312 his marriage at Greencastle, on Carlingford Bay, to Joan (<i>d</i>. 1359), daughter of Richard de Burgh, the &#145;Red Earl&#146; of Ulster, was the symbol of the union of the two greatest baronial families in Ireland. On 8 September 1316, during Edward Bruce's invasion of Ireland, he succeeded to the new earldom of Kildare on his father's death. He had already served against the Scots at the battle of Skerries, near Ardscull in Kildare, in January 1316. During the early months of the following year, when Robert I, king of Scots (who was married to a sister of his wife), joined Edward on an expedition into Leinster and Munster, he took part in the campaign that turned the Scots back from Limerick. He was then appointed captain of the unruly band of dispossessed Ulster settlers that pursued the Bruces as they retreated northwards. He was thanked by Edward II for his services against Bruce and, also in 1317, he received from the king the office of hereditary sheriff for his county of Kildare, which involved full jurisdiction and liberties within the earldom.<br>
<br>In 1319 Kildare received a patent empowering him to admit to English law such of his Gaelic tenants as wished to be governed by it. In 1319 and again in 1320 he served on a commission to inquire into the treasons committed during the Bruce invasion. In September 1320 Roger Mortimer appointed him deputy justiciar; he was confirmed in office by the king in April 1321, after the English appointee, Sir Ralph Gorges, was captured during disturbances in south Wales, and acted until August. In 1322 Kildare was summoned to serve against the Scots, but does not seem to have accompanied the justiciar, the earl of Louth, on the expedition that left Ireland in August. In 1324 he was at the Dublin parliament, where the magnates of Ireland pledged themselves to arrest felons of their lineages and lordships and deliver them up to royal justice. Also in 1324 he was accused of being an adherent of Roger Mortimer and of corresponding with him after his escape from the Tower of London.<br>
<br>There may have been some truth in this, for one of the first acts of the English government after the accession of Edward III in 1327 was to reappoint Kildare as justiciar of Ireland. Nevertheless, he had been on good terms with the Despensers: in June 1323 the pope had granted a dispensation for his son, John, who was a hostage in England, to marry Joan, daughter of Hugh Despenser the younger. The Irish magnates, several of whom had also formed links with the Despenser regime, were notified of his appointment as justiciar in February 1327. He faced a series of crises. Feuds involving the Fitzgeralds of Desmond, the Berminghams, Butlers, de Burghs, and Poers were causing widespread disturbances across southern Ireland. While these had their origins in territorial disputes, the political weakness in England had allowed them to get out of hand. Kildare conducted negotiations with the parties at Kilkenny and in parliament at Dublin in May. At the same period, Robert Bruce, who may have hoped to exploit the uncertain allegiances to Edward III, landed in Ulster and forced the seneschal to agree a truce. Kildare sent an emissary north, and persuaded the king of Scots to withdraw. But as late as 23 July he and his fellow ministers reported to England their fears of a Scottish conquest. Soon after this he faced a challenge from the Irish of Leinster, who in an unusual fit of unity chose Domnall, son of Art Mac Murchadha, as their king. Domnall was quickly captured by the English of Wexford, and Kildare sent the chancellor, Roger Outlaw, to Carlow to negotiate his delivery into the government's hands.<br>
<br>Kildare, described by the Dublin annals as &#145;a prudent man&#146;  (Gilbert, 2.352), died in office on 5 April 1328 at Maynooth, and was buried in the Franciscan friary at Kildare. The previous year he had granted the advowson of Kilcullen, Kildare, to the priory of Holy Trinity, Dublin, in return for perpetual prayers for the souls of himself, his wife, and his relatives and friends. He had at least three sons: John (<i>d</i>. 1324); Richard, the third earl (<i>d</i>. 1331); and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9578/', "Maurice fitz Thomas Fitzgerald")</script>, who became the fourth earl (<i>d</i>. 1390). The countess had further children with John Darcy, Kildare's successor as justiciar, whom she married at Maynooth on 3 July 1329. When she died in 1359, having long outlived Darcy, she was buried with her first husband.<br>
