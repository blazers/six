<span class="headword">Malynes <span class="st"> [Malines,  de Malines]</span>,  Gerard <span class="st"> [Garrett, Gerald]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em>1585&#150;1641), <span class="occ">merchant and writer on economics</span>, was the son of a &#145;mint-master&#146;  (Malynes, 281). He claimed that Lancashire was the &#145;countrey&#146; of his &#145;ancestors and parents&#146;, but he was actually born in Antwerp, close to the town of Malines (Mechelen) itself  (ibid., 263). His early life remains obscure, but in 1622 he boasted fifty years of &#145;observation, knowledge and experience&#146; of trade, which suggests that his commercial career started in the early 1570s  (ibid., 8). By 1585 he had settled in London as a merchant, and, judging by his &pound;200 loan to the crown three years later, was able to establish himself as a successful European trader. He became a member of the City's Dutch church, and remained a merchant stranger without attempting to secure denizen or naturalized status. His foreign connections were further strengthened by 1590 through his marriage to Marie (<i>fl</i>. 1590&#150;1602), the daughter of his business partner Guilliame van Ameyden. This union produced at least three sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Malynes demonstrated an uncompromising ambition, and the international crises of the age presented him with several opportunities to advance himself. Keen to play the patriotic subject in his adopted country, he acted as an informant for the government, using his international contacts in France and Spain to supply the secretary of state, Sir Francis Walsingham, with news of foreign events. His business dealings were equally full of intrigue, and in the 1590s he became embroiled in a series of legal disputes which threatened to ruin him completely. He was partly to blame for these misfortunes, for he seems to have been ruthless in pursuit of financial gain. He was even charged with having arrested members of a Dutch diplomatic party for a debt, and English observers remarked upon his obstinacy and suspect motives. His key test came from a dispute with Amsterdam merchant John Honger, who accused Malynes and his father-in-law of conspiring to spirit away some &pound;18,000 which he had entrusted to them as his factors in London. Malynes counter-claimed that Honger owed him significant sums, but his adversary was backed by powerful allies such as the Dutch envoy in London, and it was Malynes who ended up in gaol. It appears that he was imprisoned twice, in 1590&#150;93 and from 1594 to at least 1596, although his enemy Honger suggested that he used the stolen money to live &#145;in riotous sort&#146; during captivity  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 6.15&#150;16). Malynes sought to use his government contacts to extricate himself from this mess, reminding Sir Robert Cecil of his services for the crown and his concern for &#145;the advancement of the true gospel and doctrine&#146;  (ibid., 262&#150;3). A bill to settle the affair was unsuccessfully submitted to parliament early in 1598, but his connections served him well, for in June 1600 it was reported that &#145;for some time&#146; he had been granted royal protection from arrest &#145;for special considerations&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1599&#150;1600</i>, 365). According to an intelligence report of September 1598, Malynes had dealings with a Spanish agent who had been in England, and thus he might have resumed his espionage duties on gaining his liberty  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1598&#150;1601</i>, 91). There is no evidence to suggest that Honger ever regained his money, and this and other civil suits were reported to be still &#145;undecided&#146; in July 1602. However, Malynes informed Cecil several months later that he was now &#145;out of danger of all arrest&#146;, and hoped that the minister would &#145;create me <i>de novo</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 12.245, 528).<br>
<br>Malynes's decision to embark on a career as an economic writer must be linked to these personal misfortunes. Perhaps inspired by his father's profession, Malynes sought to establish himself as an authority on currency and exchange, using his government contacts to resurrect his flagging fortunes. In 1600 he was appointed one of the commissioners to establish the true par of exchange, and although frequently rebuffed in the course of public debate, his concern to free the English coinage from the perceived exploitation of foreign money dealers remained the dominant theme of his life's work. So relentlessly did he explore this field that a leading modern authority sees him as &#145;something of an exchange crank&#146;  (Ashton, 4). His views were first published in two tracts which appeared in 1601&#150;2: <span class="italic">St George for England, Allegorically Described</span>, and <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Canker of England's Commonwealth</span>. The latter tract suggested that he had had the opportunity to communicate his ideas to the queen in person, and he boldly claimed that he could save the country &pound;500,000 a year. However, the dedication of the <span class="italic">Treatise</span> also highlighted his continuing notoriety, since he still feared rivals who would &#145;endeavour to make me generally odious amongst all men&#146;. He advertised his talents by more direct means, reportedly giving evidence to the Commons concerning a marine insurance bill in November and December 1601, and several months later he offered to settle the exchange between England and war-ravaged Ireland. He subsequently ransacked French history to publicize further his views on exchanges, publishing in 1604 <span class="italic">England's view in the unmasking of two paradoxes, with a replication unto the answer of Maister J. Bodine</span>.<br>
<br>During the reign of James I, Malynes sought to turn his fiscal expertise to more direct financial benefit, becoming involved in a series of projects associated with the coinage. He first turned his hand to mining, gaining the backing of Lord Eure and several London merchants to extract lead and alum in Yorkshire and silver in Durham. However, this scheme had already come to grief by 1606, despite the recruitment of mining experts from Germany and &#145;the commodiousness of foreign contracts&#146; of his partners  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 18.271). He darkly suggested that &#145;a great personage then in authoritie&#146; had let him down on this occasion in order to pursue &#145;some other private designs&#146;, and also blamed the machinations of other business associates  (Malynes, 262). Once again he turned to Cecil (now the earl of Salisbury) for aid, and may well have gained his assistance, for in 1607 Malynes was granted another royal protection against arrest, presumably to save him from his creditors. Two years later he was appointed a commissioner on mint affairs, a position which promoted further commentary on monetary schemes. In 1610 he prepared another tract on his favourite topic, <span class="italic">A Treatise of Tripartite Exchange According to the Three Essential Parts of Trafficque</span>, stating his patriotic intent to halt the nation's commercial decline. He also proudly recalled his recent summons by the House of Commons to advise on ways to halt the export of bullion. The experience also encouraged him to draft <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Royal Merchant of Great Brittayne</span> (1610), in which he lectured the sovereign on his duty and interest in attending to the nation's finances and commerce.<br>
<br>In 1612 Malynes prepared another paper attacking foreign money dealers as the cause of the country's export of bullion, and in the following year proposed to coin copper and brass farthings to ensure that small-denomination silver pieces did not leave the country. He was successful in his bid and a patent was duly granted to Lord Harrington to oversee the implementation of the scheme. However, it soon ran into trouble, and after six months only &pound;600 of the tokens had been issued, several counties having refused to take them. Harrington's death further complicated matters, and by 1617 Malynes had to contend with the competition of the countess of Bedford, who had also started to mint the coins. He again sought to use court contacts to salvage his fortune, claiming that his family stood to lose &pound;2500 on account of this project, but compensation was not forthcoming. He also appears to have met further disappointment in 1617 when lobbying to secure part of the income from duties levied on foreigners for fishing in royal waters. Ministerial patience with the truculent courtier was clearly running out, for in the following year the privy council prevented Malynes from using his royal protection of 1607 to avoid paying his arrears for rent. Personal ruin again beckoned, and in February 1619 he was back in debtors' prison, whence he petitioned the king for aid, his debtors having had the temerity to pay him back with his own tokens.<br>
<br>Demonstrating remarkable resilience, Malynes once again managed to survive this ordeal, and embraced the economic crises of the 1620s as an excellent opportunity to put forward his ideas on the currency. His rant against foreign dealers duly resurfaced in a tract of 1622, <span class="italic">The Maintenance of Free Trade, According to the Three Essentiall Parts of Traffique</span>; this constituted a direct attack on a recent work by Edward Misselden, who argued that the root of the country's monetary problem was an undervaluing of English coins, rather than the rate of exchange. Malynes took pride in declaring his long experience of advising ministers on such matters, and gave evidence to the standing commission on trade about the state of the coinage. The controversy continued into the following year, when he published <span class="italic">The centre of the circle of commerce, or, A refutation of a treatise intitled the Circle of commerce, lately published by E[dward] M[isselden]</span>, a work which described exchange as &#145;the heavenly mystery&#146;  (p. 139). However, the essential flaws of Malynes's argument were clear to see, and were most damagingly exposed by Thomas Mun, who argued more successfully that the rate of exchange was only a symptom of a deeper malaise, namely a fundamental imbalance in the nation's trade with other countries.<br>
<br>Although Malynes's reputation was severely bruised by this debate, it was during this controversy that he produced his most influential work, <span class="italic">Consuetudo, vel, Lex mercatoria, or, The ancient law merchant; divided into three parts, according to the essential parts of traffic</span> (1622). At 500 pages, it is a most impressive testimony to his commercial experience, and became the standard English-language work on the law merchant. A modern study has indeed called it &#145;the most popular merchants' handbook of its time&#146;  (Letwin, 101). Its tripartite format analysing commodities, money, and exchanges had appeared in his earlier works, and he predictably took the opportunity to indulge his views on the abuses of foreign exchanges. However, he ranged much further in his economic remit, and sought to promote several new schemes, most characteristically a regulated system of pawnbrokers to relieve the poor from the tyranny of moneylenders. He claimed to have collected a list of 1500 subscribers to back this scheme to the tune of &pound;2000 p.a., but his hopes once again had been dashed by &#145;a great personage, who (as it seemeth) was not worthy of the honour thereof&#146;  (Malynes, 335&#150;6). The general value of the work as a compendium of mercantile expertise ensured its continuing popularity among seventeenth-century publishers, with further editions in 1629, 1636, and 1686, and several excerpts were also published separately, Samuel Hartlib including a section from this &#145;great book&#146; in his edition of <span class="italic">The Reformed Commonwealth of Bees</span> in 1655. Economic historians have also found it a most useful, if not entirely unimpeachable, source.<br>
<br>In the <span class="italic">Lex mercatoria</span> Malynes confessed to be &#145;stricken in years&#146; and ready to &#145;number my days&#146;. His financial difficulties and advanced age can account for the general obscurity of his later years, although he surfaced briefly in 1641 to lobby the House of Commons for controls on exchanges, thereby displaying his unquenchable belief in the propriety of his lifelong campaign. No details concerning his date of death have been found, and, as he himself feared, his continuing money problems helped to ensure that none of his offspring rose to prominence.<br>
