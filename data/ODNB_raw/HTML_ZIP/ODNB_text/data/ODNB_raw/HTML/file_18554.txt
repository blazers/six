<span class="headword">Mendez <span class="st"> [Mendes]</span>,  Moses</span>  (1690?&#150;1758), <span class="occ">playwright and poet</span>, was probably born in the City of London. He was a grandson of the Sephardi physician Fernando Mendes and the only son of James Mendez, of Mitcham, Surrey, a stockjobber, and Anne, of the Sephardi da Costa family. He married outside of his faith to Ann (Anne) Gabrielle (<i>d</i>. 1771), daughter and coheir of Sir Francis Head, baronet, of Hermitage, Higham, Kent. It is not known when Mendez was baptized.<br>
<br>Mendez may have received part of his education at St Mary Hall, Oxford, under Dr William King. At first he intended to become an advocate in Doctors' Commons, but instead took up stockjobbing, by which he made a fortune. He had a home at Mitcham, and bought St Andrews, a large estate at Old Buckenham, Norfolk. In 1737 he became steward, and the following year grand steward, in a masonic lodge, probably the British lodge that met at Braund's Head, New Bond Street.<br>
<br>Moses and his relative Solomon Mendez (<i>d</i>. 1762?) had friends in London literary circles, including Richard Savage, James Thomson, David Garrick, and Robert Dodsley, but there is some confusion between the two because of frequent lack of forenames in contemporary correspondence. It now seems that it was Solomon who in 1739 contributed to Alexander Pope's project of an allowance for the poet Savage, which Solomon withdrew in 1742; Thomson addressed a mock epitaph to Solomon and a birthday poem to his wife. Moses gave an account of a trip to Ireland in 1744 in a poem addressed to John Ellis, but Simpson's statement that he was friends with Swift  (Simpson, 105) remains undocumented. David Garrick in 1745 called Moses &#145;very much my friend&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of David Garrick</span>, 70). Dodsley published several of his poems in his <span class="italic">Collection</span>, vol. 4 (1755). Mendez's <span class="italic">The Seasons</span> (1751), a set of Spenserian verses (a favourite form of his), opens with an elegy on Thomson's death.<br>
<br>Secure in his fortune, Mendez began a literary career. His first dramatic piece, <span class="italic">The Double Disappointment</span>, was the earliest published Jewish contribution to English literature. A farce with several songs (called a &#145;ballad opera&#146;), it had its premi&egrave;re at Drury Lane on 18 March 1746, and was revived the following season. The audience delighted in the exposing of national characters in the form of two Irish and French fortune hunters.<br>
<br>For Drury Lane, Mendez also provided three afterpieces. Most popular was <span class="italic">The Chaplet</span>, advertised as &#145;a New Pastoral Masque&#146; or &#145;a New Musical Entertainment in Two Interludes&#146;  (<span class="italic">General Advertiser</span>), with music by William Boyce, which opened on 2 December 1749 and had revivals until April 1755. <span class="italic">Robin Hood</span>, set by Charles Burney, opened on 13 December 1750 for four performances, with only the music to recommend it. <span class="italic">The Shepherd's Lottery</span>, also set by Boyce, had its premi&egrave;re on 19 November 1751, and was revived in two following seasons; it was also performed at the meeting of the Three Choirs at Hereford on 14 September 1754, under Boyce's direction. Songs from Mendez's plays, especially <span class="italic">The Chaplet</span>, were popular at the pleasure gardens and were widely disseminated in song sheets, songbooks, and magazines.<br>
<br>Mendez's poems appeared in numerous poetic miscellanies and collections; several were first printed in 1792 in the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> (February, November, and December issues, along with a biographical sketch and portrait in the October issue). In the <span class="italic">Battiad</span>, in two cantos (1750), Mendez, assisted by Paul Whitehead and Dr Ralph Schomberg, satirized the part taken by William Battie against Schomberg in the latter's dispute with the College of Physicians.<br>
<br>The nearest contemporary source describes Mendez as a &#145;Person of considerable Genius, of an agreeable Behaviour and entertaining in Conversation [with] a very pretty Turn for Poetry&#146;  (Baker, vol. 2). Mendez was created an MA at Oxford University on 19 June 1750. He died at Old Buckenham, Norfolk, on 4 February 1758, and was buried there on 8 February.<br>
<br>Mendez's wife married Captain the Hon. John Roper (1734&#150;1780) on 21 March 1760, and died on 11 December 1771. Mendez's sons Francis and James Roper were authorized to take their mother's maiden name (Head) by royal licence dated 11 May 1771. His cousin, Emanuel Mendes da Costa, was the noted English naturalist. His grandsons had military careers and served under Wellington. Sir George Head (1782&#150;1855) was assistant commissary-general and deputy knight-marshal at the coronations of William IV and Queen Victoria; and Sir Francis Bond Head (1793&#150;1875) became lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada and suppressed the rising of 1837&#150;8.<br>
