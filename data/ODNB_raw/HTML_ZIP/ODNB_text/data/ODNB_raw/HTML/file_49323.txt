<span class="headword">Lewis,  John</span>  (1836&#150;1928), <span class="occ">department store owner</span>, was born at Town Street, Shepton Mallet, Somerset, on 24 February 1836, the fifth child (of nine) and first son of John Lewis (1798&#150;1843), a cabinet-maker and baker of Town Street, and his wife, Elizabeth Speed. Orphaned when his father died, he was brought up by an unmarried aunt, Ann Speed, and educated at the local grammar school. Lewis was apprenticed at fourteen to a draper in Wells, and then worked for various firms before joining Peter Robinson of Oxford Street in 1856 as a buyer for silks and dress materials.<br>
<br>In 1864 Lewis began his own drapery business at a small leasehold shop at 132 (later 286) Oxford Street. Thus began twenty years of lonely bachelor life, which Lewis did not recollect with any fondness. The work was hard and dreary, but the location of the shop and Lewis's simple and honest trading policy&#151;based on a wide assortment of good-value merchandise&#151;proved successful. From silks, woollens, and cotton fabrics, he diversified into dress fabrics and clothing, then later furnishing fabrics and household supplies, such as china and ironmongery (though not food). Sales increased from &pound;25,000 in 1870 to about &pound;70,000 a decade later. By 1895 this expansion had allowed him to rebuild the original shop as a three-storey department store, with retail showrooms, warehouse space, and a customers' restaurant. He employed about 150 people, with 100 female staff housed in a hostel nearby, in Weymouth Street.<br>
<br>The business remained private, with Lewis continuing to build it up by working long hours. On 1 November 1884 he married Eliza Baker (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1854), a schoolmistress from a west-country family who ran a drapery business. His wife was one of the first students at Girton College, Cambridge. Lewis took no one into partnership until his two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34515/', "John Spedan Lewis (1885&#150;1963)")</script> and Oswald Lewis (1887&#150;1966), came of age. His only attempt at expansion outside Oxford Street was the acquisition of Peter Jones Ltd, Chelsea, the control of which he had bought in 1906, when he walked from his store to Sloane Square with &pound;20,000 in banknotes in his pocket. Spare capital from his business was invested quite randomly in various properties, some hundred of which were bought in his lifetime. Always an outspoken and colourful character, Lewis engaged in a running battle with his landlords (the Portland estate) to redress what he considered was an unfair balance of power between landlord and tenant; and he spent some weeks in Brixton prison in 1903 for contempt of court.<br>
<br>On his own terms, Lewis's life was a great success. By 1924 sales had reached &pound;921,000. His customers had been served well by his department store and so had Lewis. For more than twenty years he lived in a large house on Hampstead Heath with his wife and family, and he drove a good pair of horses and later ran a Rolls-Royce. He was appointed to St Marylebone vestry (later the borough council) between 1888 and 1919, and was the elected Liberal representative for the West Marylebone division of London county council between 1901 and 1904. On the other hand, he was a hard and arbitrary employer, with the persona of a Victorian curmudgeon. One staff member recalled that in the late 1920s, &#145;he still came down from Hampstead in the old Rolls Royce from time to time and would sweep round the place sacking anyone he didn't like the look of&#146;  (Macpherson, 23).<br>
<br>Lewis's son Spedan later wrote a withering portrait of his father's conservative business methods.<blockquote>His aims in life, his ideas and his methods were really quite ordinary but the ideas were held with a vigour and the methods were applied with an energy that was far indeed from being ordinary. With very little education and no friends he found himself in an occupation to which he was in many ways ill-suited. (Lewis, 5)</blockquote>The result was that by the twentieth century John Lewis had &#145;got himself into the position of being the captain of a big ship much under-engined and with those engines much under-fuelled. As a whole the staff were not nearly good enough&#146;  (Lewis, 14). These comments were no doubt partial (Spedan and his father disagreed on business matters); however, evidence for their veracity can be found in John Lewis's business performance, which was far less dynamic than that of his rivals, such as William Whiteley, Frederick Gorringe, and Owen Owen. A staff strike in 1920, persistent mismanagement and losses at Peter Jones, and his reluctance to hand over control to his sons, which effectively prevented an infusion of fresh ideas, were other features of the founder's rule.<br>
<br>John Lewis died on 8 June 1928 at his home, Spedan Tower, Branch Hill, Hampstead, London. His death allowed his son Spedan to implement his more imaginative &#145;partnership&#146; ideal, and so make the John Lewis department store nationally famous. However, the name was retained as a tribute to John Lewis's &#145;first-rate reputation for general trustworthiness&#146;  (Lewis, 15).<br>
