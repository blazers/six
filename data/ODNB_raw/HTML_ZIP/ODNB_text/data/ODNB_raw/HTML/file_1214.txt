<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ball,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1381), <span class="occ">chaplain and leader of the peasants' revolt</span>, was of obscure origins. He had been an itinerant radical preacher for nearly twenty years before the revolt. He described himself, in letters circulated during the rising, as &#145;seynte marye prist&#146; and &#145;som tyme seynte marie prest of 3ork. and now of Colchestre&#146;  (Justice, 14), suggesting that he had at one time been a chantry priest in York and afterwards moved to Colchester. At least three men called John Ball are mentioned in Colchester records of the late fourteenth century, but none can be firmly identified with the rebel leader. A suggestion that he was the son of William and Joan Ball of Peldon, a few miles south of Colchester, born <i>c</i>.1329, appears to be without foundation.<br>
<br>On 25 February 1364 Edward III issued a letter patent describing how he had granted Ball protection in response to a complaint by him that he feared injury from his enemies while pursuing his business. The king had heard, however, that Ball was instead wandering from place to place preaching articles contrary to the faith of the church, and withdrew the protection. Six months later Bishop Simon Sudbury of London requested Ball's arrest as an obdurate excommunicate. In 1366 the dean of Bocking was ordered to cite Ball to appear before Archbishop Simon Langham (<i>d</i>. 1376). Over the next fourteen years repeated attempts were made to silence Ball by excommunication and arrest, without effect. In April 1381 Sudbury, now archbishop of Canterbury, excommunicated Ball yet again, and on 29 April the sheriff of Kent was ordered to arrest him.<br>
<br>At the end of May 1381 attempts to enforce payment of the third poll tax led to riots in Essex, which spread to Kent. Knighton states that one of the first acts of the Kentish rebels was to free Ball from the archbishop's prison at Maidstone. In fact Ball would have been in the royal prison there, which was not stormed by the Kentish rebels under Wat Tyler until 11 June, when the rising was well advanced. Having already caused mayhem across northern Kent from Dartford to Canterbury, Tyler's men were by the time they attacked Maidstone gaol making a concerted move towards London. Froissart also antedates Ball's release from prison, wrongly stating that he was with Tyler at Canterbury. The claim in an Essex indictment that Ball was not in Maidstone at all, but was released by Essex rebels from the bishop of London's gaol at Bishop's Stortford on 11 June, is difficult to reconcile with the other evidence, and probably mistaken.<br>
<br>On 12 June the Kentish insurgents assembled on Blackheath and remained there until the following day. Ball preached to the rebels while they were at Blackheath, taking as his text the words:<blockquote>
<div>Whanne Adam dalfe and Eve span,<br>
</div>
<div>Who was &thorn;anne a gentil man?<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Although this couplet has become associated with Ball's name, it was a popular proverb which is recorded from at least the early fourteenth century. According to Walsingham, Ball used his text to demonstrate that &#145;all men were created equal by nature, and that servitude has been introduced by the unjust and evil oppression of men, against the will of God&#146;  (Walsingham, <span class="italic">Chronicon Angliae</span>, 321). Walsingham and others alleged that Ball was a follower of John Wyclif (<i>d</i>. 1384). This was not the case, but as R. B. Dobson has observed:<blockquote>In their understandable reaction from the deliberately propagated legend that John Ball was John Wycliffe's disciple, historians &hellip; have sometimes unduly discounted a not unimportant connection between these two ideologues&#151;that the audience for their respective messages must certainly have sometimes overlapped. (Dobson, xxxvii)</blockquote>During the morning of 13 June Richard II and his ministers attempted unsuccessfully to talk to the rebels at Rotherhithe. Following the failure of this meeting the rebels entered London where, among many acts of destruction and bloodshed, they burnt the Savoy Palace of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, destroyed the headquarters of the hospitallers at Clerkenwell Priory, and executed Simon Sudbury, the archbishop of Canterbury, and Robert Hales, the treasurer of England and prior of the hospitallers. Ball's role in these events is not clear. The chroniclers mention him, if at all, only in general terms as a leader and chief counsellor of the rebels. After the killing of Wat Tyler during an interview with the king at Smithfield on 15 June Ball fled. He was eventually arrested at Coventry and was tried by Robert Tresilian (<i>d</i>. 1388) at St Albans on 12 July. The anti-Wycliffite compilation <span class="italic">Fasciculi zizaniorum</span> contains a confession supposedly made by Ball at this time, in which he states that he was an agent of Wyclif, but this document is a fabrication. Ball was hanged, drawn, and quartered at St Albans on 15 July 1381.<br>
<br>Knighton and Walsingham reproduce six letters in English urging on the rebels. Ball is named as the author of three of these, and it has usually been assumed that he wrote them all, but their language suggests that the other three are by different hands. These letters have been chiefly celebrated for their early mention of Piers Plowman. But they should also be valued, along with Ball's famous couplet and his reported preaching, for the unique insight they provide into the radical Christian egalitarianism that constituted much of the ideology of the rebels.<br>
