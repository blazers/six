<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Liston,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1776&#150;1846), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born in London, reputedly the son of a watchmaker or of the occupant of an inferior position in the gaming houses, or of a cook's shopkeeper, in either the parish of St James's or St Ann's, Soho, although no record of his birth appears in the registers for either parish. His death certificate gives his age as seventy in 1846. He was allegedly educated at Soho School and he later worked as an usher at the Library School in Castle Street, close to the Haymarket. He made his d&eacute;but as an actor at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, on 15 August 1799, as Rawbold in George Colman's <span class="italic">The Iron Chest</span>, for Charles Kemble's benefit. He appeared in Dublin, though as little more than a spear carrier, for the winter season of 1799&#150;1800, then from 1800 to 1801 he acted at Taunton, Weymouth, and Exeter. He then joined Stephen Kemble's company, which performed in a circuit based on Newcastle upon Tyne, and made his first recorded appearance on the Newcastle stage on 3 August 1801. According to Anne Matthews, Liston's d&eacute;but on the Newcastle circuit was at Durham, during Sarah Siddons's engagement; she adds that he later revealed his comic talents to Kemble in the role of Diggory in <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span>. Apart from several months with Tate Wilkinson's York-based company in 1803, Liston remained with Stephen Kemble until May 1805; he acquired a particular reputation for his skills in low-comedy roles, for which he was regularly praised in the <span class="italic">Monthly Mirror</span> and in the Newcastle press.<br>
<br>On Monday 10 June 1805 Liston made his d&eacute;but as a low comedian at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, playing Sheepface in <span class="italic">The Village Lawyer</span>. When the Haymarket season ended he was engaged by Covent Garden, where he remained until 1822. His Covent Garden d&eacute;but occurred on 15 October 1805, when he played Jacob Gawkey in <span class="italic">The Chapter of Accidents</span>. He then played Memmo in &#145;Monk&#146; Lewis's <span class="italic">Rugantino</span> and Gaby Grim in Colman's <span class="italic">We Fly by Night</span>. It took several years before he established himself as a major comedian, but his reputation was considerably enhanced through summer seasons at the Haymarket, where, partnered with Charles Mathews, he appeared in a number of specially written plays by Theodore Hook, such as <span class="italic">Catch him who Can</span> (1806), <span class="italic">The Fortress</span> (1807), <span class="italic">Music Mad</span> (1807), and <span class="italic">Killing No Murder</span> (1809). He developed a skill in performing conceited and affected provincial characters, such as Apollo Belvi in the last-mentioned play, often embellished with comic dancing, which was also a feature of his Caper in <span class="italic">Who Wins</span> (1808) and his Lord Grizzle in <span class="italic">Tom Thumb</span>, the first role for which he won particular acclaim at Covent Garden. Apart from Lord Grizzle, Liston also achieved acclaim in other burlesque roles, especially Don Whiskerandos in <span class="italic">The Critic</span> and the title role in <span class="italic">Bombastes furioso</span>. A particular contribution of Liston's to the English stage was the conceited cockney, which first surfaced in the character of Henry Augustus Mug in Colman's <span class="italic">The Africans</span> (Haymarket, 1808) and for which he achieved particular renown as Lubin Log in James Kenney's <span class="italic">Love, Law and Physic</span> (Covent Garden, 1812). Sam Swipes in Hook's <span class="italic">Exchange No Robbery</span> (Haymarket, 1820) was another successful character in this mould. Liston created many new low-comedy parts in the comedies, farces, and melodramas played at Covent Garden and the Haymarket, as well as re-creating a number of already established roles, such as Bob Acres and Sir Benjamin Backbite. His Shakespearian performances included Bottom, Sir Andrew Aguecheek, Malvolio, Pompey, Launce, Dromio, Polonius, Slender, and Cloten, while he was also the first English-speaking Figaro in Henry Bishop's Covent Garden versions of <span class="italic">The Marriage of Figaro</span> and <span class="italic">The Barber of Seville</span>. In adaptations of the novels of Sir Walter Scott he was particularly praised for his Dominie Sampson in <span class="italic">Guy Mannering</span>, Baillie Nicol Jarvie in <span class="italic">Rob Roy</span>, and Captain Dalgetty in <span class="italic">Montrose</span>. His benefits often showed him in new guises, most notoriously as Ophelia in John Poole's <span class="italic">Hamlet Travestie</span> in 1813 and as Lord Grizzle delivering an <span class="italic">Epilogue on an Ass</span> in 1818. A desire to play more serious roles emerged in his 1809 benefit, when he played Octavian in <span class="italic">The Mountaineers</span>, and in 1829, when he played Baron Wildenheim in <span class="italic">Lovers' Vows</span> for his last Haymarket benefit.<br>
<br>Liston left Covent Garden Theatre on 31 May 1822, on which occasion his wife, Sarah, took her professional leave of the stage. Liston had married Sarah Tyrer (1781&#150;1854) at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 22 March 1807, and she had given birth to a son, John Terry, in 1813 and a daughter, Emma, in 1814. She had originally made her d&eacute;but at Drury Lane on 21 May 1801 and first appeared at the Haymarket a month later. A short, plump woman, she was first engaged at Covent Garden in 1805, where she played comic roles, such as serving maids, and was also in demand on account of her vocal powers. One of her most famous parts was Queen Dollallola in <span class="italic">Tom Thumb</span>.<br>
<br>By 1822 Liston had also become a popular attraction in the provinces, and often toured during the summer seasons in which he was not engaged at the Haymarket. At Covent Garden his weekly salary had never risen above &pound;17, considerably less than he could earn on provincial tours and than the &pound;50 he was offered to join the Drury Lane company in 1823. He made his Drury Lane d&eacute;but on 28 January as Tony Lumpkin, and remained there, when not fulfilling equally lucrative engagements in the provinces and at the Haymarket, until 1831. During these years he became a firm favourite of George IV and developed some of his most popular roles, such as Mawworm in <span class="italic">The Hypocrite</span>, Tristram Sappy in <span class="italic">Deaf as a Post</span>, Billy Lackaday in <span class="italic">Sweethearts and Wives</span>, and Paul Pry, described by Genest as &#145;a perfect piece of acting&#146;  (Genest, <span class="italic">Eng. Stage</span>, 10.318). John Poole's <span class="italic">Paul Pry</span> was first performed at the Haymarket Theatre on 13 September 1825, and had one of the most successful runs enjoyed by a play since <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> in the previous century. Liston was reputedly paid &pound;100 per week for his performance, although it was later rumoured he was paid &pound;50 or &pound;60 per night when <span class="italic">Paul Pry</span> was revived. Paul Pry, with his catchphrase &#145;I hope I don't intrude&#146;, was a unique creation, dressed in baggy striped trousers tucked into hessian boots, tail coat, and top hat, and accompanied always by an umbrella. Likenesses soon appeared everywhere: in prints, on porcelain and toby jugs, adorning cakes and pats of butter, sewn into pocket handkerchiefs, embellishing snuff boxes, and used as insignia on carts, buses, and fairground stalls. The part itself became the <i>sine qua non</i> of the low comedian: even in the 1890s J. L. Toole was still re-creating the role in a style of dress based on Liston's original costume.<br>
<br>While Liston's renown was based largely on his performance in low-comedy roles, he was sometimes also praised for parts that required a quieter and more restrained style of acting, such as Adam Brock in J. R. Planch&eacute;'s <span class="italic">Charles XII</span> (Drury Lane, 1828). These qualities were particularly in evidence during the last six years of Liston's professional career, which were spent almost entirely at the small Olympic Theatre under the management of Madame Vestris, at a salary variously reported as &pound;60 and &pound;100 per week. Liston had previously appeared with Vestris, not only in <span class="italic">Paul Pry</span>, but also as a Broom Girl, in the duet <span class="italic">Buy a Broom</span>, in 1826. He made his d&eacute;but there on 1 October 1831 as Dominique in <span class="italic">Talk of the Devil</span>, and during the next six years created a succession of largely original roles, contributing greatly to the theatre's success. In 1835 he introduced Charles Mathews the younger to the theatrical public in <span class="italic">The Old and Young Stager</span>, and the following year played with him in Planch&eacute;'s <span class="italic">The Two Figaros</span>. He took his leave of the Olympic stage on 31 May 1837, and on 5 June he played in a benefit at Covent Garden for George Herbert Buonaparte Rodwell, who was married to his daughter, Emma. His last professional performance occurred on Saturday 10 June at the Lyceum Theatre for the benefit of James Vining. He then moved to his country villa at Penn, near Windsor, but spent the final years of his life at his residence in St George's Place, near Hyde Park Corner.<br>
<br>Liston was undoubtedly the greatest comic actor of his generation. He gave detailed, well-observed performances which emphasized such human foibles as greed, conceit, affectation, and cowardice. His deadpan style was enhanced by his extraordinary face. &#145;There is one face of Farley&#146;, wrote Charles Lamb, &#145;one of Knight, one (but what a one it is!) of Liston&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, Oct 1822). His high forehead was offset by goggle eyes, a snub nose with dilated nostrils, fleshy lips, and large cheeks. Leigh Hunt noted how his mouth and chin with the throat under it &#145;hung like an old bag&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 186). The gravity of his face added to his comic effect. According to Hazlitt, describing his Sir Peter Pigwiggin in <span class="italic">Pigeons and Crows</span>, &#145;His jaws seem to ache with laughter, his eyes look out of his head with wonder, his face is unctuous all over and bathed with jests&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Works</span>, 15.359). Liston was 5 feet 11 inches in height, and in his younger days was considered one of the best-built men around London. As he grew older he grew fatter, and his typical posture in performance, judging from surviving prints, was a slouch with knees bent, bottom thrust out, and hands in pocket. He dressed his characters with great skill and enjoyed a very good relationship with his audiences, partly because of his powers of ad libbing. Although some critics accused him of buffoonery, many praised him for his quietness and repose, for the original and natural qualities of his performances, and for his effortlessness. &#145;Other actors labour to be comic. I see nothing like labour or system about Liston&#146;, wrote Boaden  (2.198). He was unique in himself and also possessed the ability to merge his special talents with the character he was creating&#151;&#145;an outline or figure was all that was wanting to his art; he infused into it the richness of his own comic imagination&#146;.<br>
<br>In his lifetime Liston embodied a number of contradictions. Solemn in private life, he was also something of a practical joker; a reader of serious literature and books on theology, he allegedly wanted to play tragedy, but his career was devoted to low comedy. He was accused by some of heavy drinking and hypochondria, but there is little firm evidence to substantiate such claims. Ludicrously dressed on stage, he was always exquisitely dressed in private life and a frequenter of such fashionable resorts as Brighton. In his last years his spirits and health declined, and he died in London, after a severe apoplectic fit, on 22 March 1846. He was buried at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
