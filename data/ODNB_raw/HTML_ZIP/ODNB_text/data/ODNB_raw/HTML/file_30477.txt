<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Askwith,  George Ranken</span>, Baron Askwith  (1861&#150;1942), <span class="occ">industrial arbitrator and civil servant</span>, was born at Waltham Abbey, Essex, on 17 February 1861, the second but eldest surviving son of William Harrison Askwith (1811&#150;1897), colonel (later general) in the Royal Artillery, and formerly superintendent of the royal gunpowder factories at Waltham Abbey, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1914), daughter of George Ranken. He was educated at Marlborough College and at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he held a scholarship, rowed in the college eight, and took first-class honours in modern history in 1884. He read law, and was called to the bar by the Inner Temple and the Middle Temple in 1886. He worked first in the chambers of Sir Henry James, through whom he became counsel for both HM commissioners of works and the crown in peerage claims. He was junior counsel for Great Britain in the British Guiana&#150;Venezuela boundary arbitration in 1899. He took silk in 1908 and in the same year, on 20 February, married Ellen (1863&#150;1962), daughter of Archibald Peel, of no profession, and widow of Major Henry Graham. They had one daughter but no son and so the peerage, to which he was controversially raised (on 24 March 1919), became extinct.<br>
<br>Askwith's peerage was bestowed in recognition of his exceptional career as the government's leading arbitrator, conciliator, and adviser on industrial relations, which commenced with his appointment to the Board of Trade by Lloyd George in 1907. He had been introduced to arbitration work by Sir Henry James as early as 1896 and by 1907 was taking more than half of the board's cases. He rapidly rose to be comptroller of the labour department in 1909 and then chief industrial commissioner in 1911. The period was one of exceptional industrial unrest. The transport strike of 1911 was particularly violent; and in 1912 over 40 million working days were lost due to strike action, the third highest total in the century. Askwith, who had become a public figure through his staged intervention in the music-hall strike of 1907, did much to defuse the tension and won the particular gratitude of the king, who summoned him to Balmoral at the end of 1911 to be knighted.<br>
<br>The secrets of Askwith's success as a mediator were his immense patience and inscrutability, his willingness to wait until the warring parties had exhausted themselves, his ability to identify the smallest element of common ground on which to build a broader agreement, and his readiness to allow the others the credit for that agreement. All his adjudications contained recommendations concerning the means by which the two sides of industry could themselves resolve future disputes. In consequence he has been described as one of the &#145;secret dictators&#146; in Edwardian Whitehall who wielded more real influence than many politicians  (Hal&eacute;vy, 261). His wider and vehemently held principles were that the state should rise above vested interest and ensure that the public interest was both considered and defended in all disputes. Consequently he championed trade boards, which brought together the two sides of poorly organized industry to establish minimum wages, but not the more bureaucratic labour exchanges. He was chairman between 1911 and 1919 of the fair wages advisory committee, by which government sought to improve industrial best practice through its contractors. He was also appointed in 1911 chairman of the Industrial Council, a body of leading industrialists and trade unionists designed to become the central authority for arbitration and conciliation, with the power to make legally binding agreements. It was unsuccessful, as was its recommendation in 1913 that the government introduce a strike-free &#145;cooling-off period&#146; before any major dispute.<br>
<br>Askwith was particularly hostile to the political opportunism which usually attended ministerial intervention in industrial disputes. After some particularly unfortunate instances in 1912, the prime minister concurred as did his minister Sydney Buxton. As a result he was given an exceptional degree of freedom and, so he later claimed, the status of a permanent secretary. This could not survive the outbreak of war. The Ministry of Munitions (initially under Lloyd George), the Admiralty, and War Office each became heavily involved in industrial disputes, and their ministers and frequently inexperienced staff made conflicting awards. On his appointment as prime minister in 1916, moreover, Lloyd George created a Ministry of Labour with former trade unionists as minister and permanent secretary. Askwith, to his disgust, was transferred to this ministry and required to report regularly to them. With labour administration descending into increasing chaos, Askwith's advice to cabinet was typically trenchant and egocentric. All disputes on government contracts should be referred solely to him as chief industrial commissioner; if unresolved they should be passed to the government's main arbitration tribunal, the committee on production, of which he happened to have been chairman since 1915. To forestall unrest, the committee would also regularly review wages in the light of inflation. These suggestions were rejected as he had neither the staff nor the economic muscle to force quick solutions. Initial responsibility remained with the contracting departments and the ministry, with the committee on production responsible only for settlements affecting grades of workers employed by more than one department. Not even this was enforced.<br>
<br>Askwith's growing acerbity led in November 1917 to a cabinet minute ordering him to comply with government policy on pain of dismissal. He was also increasingly sidelined within the ministry and was clearly unsuited after the war to head its new industrial relations department, to which the conciliation officers of the other departments were transferred. This post went to his secretary at the committee on production, Horace Wilson. The new minister requested his dismissal and although Bonar Law thought Askwith's demand for a peerage unjustified he advised Lloyd George that he was too well known to be refused.<br>
<br>Askwith immediately published an outspoken defence of his record, <span class="italic">Industrial Problems and Disputes</span> (1920), and rather more surprisingly was president from 1921 to 1930 of the National Citizens' Union, which grew out of the Middle Class Union, which was which was an intended counterweight to the more extreme demands of labour and of which his wife was an active promoter. He later became a vice president of the Federation of British Industry and a director of Monotype, among other business interests. This all gives rise to some doubts about the precise nature of his neutrality as an arbitrator. He served on various government bodies such as the 1931 royal commission on Malta, was chairman of the parliamentary delegation to Bermuda (1932), and was active in the world of education, being associated with Royal Holloway College, Cheltenham Ladies' College, and St Hilda's College, Oxford. In 1913 he was mayor of St Ives, Huntingdonshire, where he had his country residence. He died at his London home, 5 Cadogan Gardens, Chelsea, on 2 June 1942 and was cremated.<br>
<br>His widow, Ellen, Lady Askwith, published two novels, <span class="italic">The Tower of Siloam</span> (1905) and <span class="italic">The Disinherited of the Earth</span> (1908), as Ellen Graham. She was appointed CBE in 1918 for her work during the First World War, when she was a lady president of the YMCA, ran canteens for dockworkers, and started national kitchens. She later served on several government committees on issues including women's unemployment, war savings, and war memorials. Their daughter was Betty Askwith, the novelist and biographer.<br>
