<div class="para">
<span class="headword">King,  William</span>  (1650&#150;1729), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland archbishop of Dublin</span>, was born in Antrim town on 1 May 1650, the son of James King (still alive in 1701), who had emigrated to Ulster from Barra in Aberdeenshire and who was later said to have been a miller or a merchant. In 1658 he moved with his household from Antrim to co. Tyrone.<h2>
<a name="Earlylife16501691"></a>Early life, 1650&#150;1691</h2>King's later reference to the family's inability to support him while a student at Trinity College, Dublin, suggests that by that time at least it was not prosperous. A fragmentary autobiography, written some time after 1697, describes a succession of unsatisfactory early schooling experiences, with sudden breakthroughs in reading, mathematics, and later Latin being attributed primarily to the young King's own efforts. He entered the Royal School at Dungannon in 1662, and was admitted to Trinity College, Dublin, on 7 April 1667.<br>
<br>James King was, according to his son, &#145;a most rigid adherent of the Presbyterian sect&#146;  (King, <span class="italic">A Great Archbishop</span>, 2), although at the time of William's birth he was under excommunication for having refused to accept the solemn league and covenant. William King presents himself in his autobiography as having been poorly instructed in, and largely indifferent to, religion of any kind until his arrival at Trinity College. There the influence of his tutor John Christian led him to undergo a period of spiritual crisis and anxious enquiry, by the end of which he had become a convinced member of the established church. He graduated BA on 23 February 1670, and on 25 October 1671 was admitted to deacon's orders as chaplain to John Parker, archbishop of Tuam, who appointed him to the prebend of Kilmainmore, co. Mayo, on 14 July 1673. King received his MA in 1673 and was ordained on 12 April 1674, taking up residence in Parker's household. He resigned Kilmainmore on becoming provost of the cathedral of St Mary, Tuam, on 26 October 1676 and took up residence in the town of Tuam. On 27 October 1679 Parker, now archbishop of Dublin, had him appointed chancellor of St Patrick's and minister of St Werburgh's parish in the city. King later presented this demanding assignment, plunging him into a round of intense pastoral effort combined with diligent study, as having rescued him from the life of provincial inactivity into which he had been preparing to settle. During this period at St Werburgh's he engaged in his first public controversy. In response to the former dean of Derry's apologia for his conversion to Catholicism, King published <span class="italic">An answer to the considerations which obliged Peter Manby &hellip; to embrace, what he calls the Catholick religion</span> (1687). Manby's reply led King to publish <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Answer</span> (1688), to which, after a further paper by Manby, he added <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Christian Religion and Reformation</span> (1688).<br>
<br>King was appointed chaplain to the lord deputy, the earl of Arran, on 20 October 1683, and on 25 November 1684 chaplain to the lord lieutenant, the duke of Ormond. He received his BD and DD degrees from Trinity College on 11 July 1688. He was installed as dean of St Patrick's on 1 February 1689. In the same month the archbishop of Dublin, Francis Marsh, withdrew to England, having appointed King and Samuel Foley (King's successor as chancellor of St Patrick's) as commissaries to manage the diocese in his absence. When Foley, too, fled to England King was left in sole charge. He later had Anthony Dopping, bishop of Meath, elected guardian of the diocese by the city's two cathedral chapters. According to his own account this was because he feared the authority he had been given was insufficient. However it has been suggested  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 10) that he may have believed that his commission lapsed following Marsh's attainder for treason by the Jacobite parliament. King and Dopping worked closely together to maintain ecclesiastical discipline and sustain protestant morale in Jacobite-dominated Dublin. King was arrested in July 1689 and imprisoned in Dublin Castle until December. He was again detained, along with other prominent protestants, in June 1690, and was held until the occupation of the city by Williamite forces following the battle of the Boyne.<br>
<br>King's conduct in 1689&#150;91 subsequently became the subject of controversy, especially in his exchanges with the nonjuror Charles Leslie, who accused him of having abandoned his earlier principles of passive resistance by providing military intelligence to the Williamites. His own version was that he had taken no direct action and had advised no one else to take up arms; the furthest he had gone was to accept that it was lawful to accept the deliverance that providence had sent in the person of William of Orange. His arrest by the Jacobite authorities he blamed on the indiscreet publication of letters that others had sent to correspondents in England and Ulster. However, he seems to have admitted privately to James Bonnell that he had, in fact, transmitted intelligence both to the duke of Schomberg, William's commander in Ulster, and directly to England, and even to have boasted of the ingenuity with which he ensured that these letters could not be traced back to him  (Bonnell to John Strype, 21 Feb 1691, 24 April 1691, CUL, Baumgartner Papers, Strype MSS I, fols. 87, 93). In 1691 he published a detailed defence of his own and others' conduct, <span class="italic">The State of the Protestants of Ireland under the Late King James's Government</span> (1691), which established him as the leading Irish defender of the revolution. His central argument was that Irish protestants were justified in withdrawing their allegiance from James II because a ruler who sought the destruction of his subjects, as James had done when he placed them in the power of their Catholic enemies, abdicated his government over them. Even here, however, he held back from justifying direct resistance. He insisted that those who had taken up arms at Derry and Enniskillen had done so only in self-defence, and presented Irish protestants in general as having passively accepted the deliverance sent by providence or, alternatively, as having acquiesced in the <i>de facto</i> transfer of power in England, as Ireland's dependent status required them to do. The argument that James's removal had been the work of providence was stated even more clearly in <span class="italic">Europe's Deliverance from France and Slavery</span> (1691), a sermon preached at St Patrick's before the lords justices on 30 November 1690, which concluded bluntly that &#145;'twas manifestly God rather than the people set our king and queen on the throne&#146;  (p. 21).<h2>
<a name="BishopofDerry16911703"></a>Bishop of Derry, 1691&#150;1703</h2>In summer 1690 King used contacts in England to urge on the new monarchs his claims for a bishopric. He was appointed bishop of Derry on 7 December 1690 and consecrated on 25 January 1691. He took up residence in March and began a vigorous campaign to restore regular pastoral services in a diocese ravaged by war and which had been without a resident bishop for two years. His autobiography records a sharp initial conflict with clergy who were using post-war economic dislocation as an excuse not to live on their benefices. By 1693 there were twenty-eight beneficed clergy living in the diocese, compared with only ten in May 1691, as well as eleven curates. King also lobbied the government for funds for church repair and the provision of glebes and houses. He paid close attention to the provision of schools, established a library at Derry for the use of the clergy and gentry, and sought to make schoolmasters and clergy the agents of a revived system of parish-based moral discipline. When a colony of episcopalian highlanders settled at Clonmany in co. Donegal, King provided a minister able to preach and conduct services in Gaelic.<br>
<br>In addition to these efforts to improve pastoral standards in his own diocese, King joined with other reform-minded bishops, notably Nathaniel Foy of Waterford and Lismore and Dopping, to lobby the English government for a programme of church reform in Ireland, concentrating particularly on the issue of ecclesiastical appointments. In 1693&#150;4 he was one of the commissioners appointed to investigate the outstanding clerical scandal of the period when Thomas Hacket, bishop of Down and Connor, was removed, along with several of his clergy, following complaints of long-term absenteeism, neglect, and mismanagement.<br>
<br>In Derry, King came into conflict with the Presbyterians, who outnumbered conformists in the diocese and dominated urban government in Derry city and other centres. In 1694 he published <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning the Inventions of Men in the Worship of God</span>, which sought to show that the practice of the Church of Ireland in relation to music, forms of prayer, the celebration of the eucharist, and other matters was in closer conformity with scripture than that of the Presbyterians. The pamphlet was attacked by Joseph Boyse, who had earlier clashed with King over comments made during his controversy with Manby, and by the Presbyterian minister of Derry itself, Robert Craighead. King replied to Boyse in <span class="italic">An Admonition to the Dissenting Inhabitants of Derry</span> (1694), followed by <span class="italic">A Second Admonition</span> (1695). Alarm at the threat from dissent, as well as an acute concern to protect the church's legal entitlements, also played a part in King's prolonged controversy with the Irish Society of London. This began as a dispute over terms for the renewal of the society's sixty-year lease on church lands, which expired in 1694, but broadened into a conflict over the ownership of other lands and fishing rights. King was concerned to curb the power of the society, which he saw as supporting the dissenting interest, and to generate revenue for an Anglican college at Derry that would combat Presbyterian influence in the region. The society, on the other hand, had the backing of the Presbyterian-dominated corporation of the city. In November 1697 the Irish House of Lords, reversing an earlier decision of chancery, granted King possession of the disputed lands. The society, however, appealed to the English House of Lords, which overturned the Irish decision in May 1698. When King continued to assert his right, the English House of Lords tried unsuccessfully to have him brought to England to face charges of contempt. In the end the Irish executive helped to negotiate a compromise solution. The episode did not turn King into an Irish patriot. As early as 1695 he had told Bonnell that he had no hopes for the forthcoming parliament because &#145;England doth not intend we should do ourselves good, and will look to it, lest we should&#146;  (28 June 1695, TCD, MS 1995&#150;2008, no. 445). But the sense of personal grievance almost certainly contributed to his vehement response to later constitutional conflicts.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The State of the Protestants</span>, with its remorseless catalogue of the abuses endured under Tyrconnell's government, has given King an undeserved reputation as an anti-Catholic polemicist. In fact he was a strong critic of much of the anti-Catholic legislation proposed or introduced during the 1690s. He accepted without question that Catholics, on account of their dangerous principles, should be excluded from civil office. However, he regarded the promises made to them in the treaty of Limerick as an agreement binding in honour, and signed the formal protest against what he considered the fraudulently incomplete bill to ratify the treaty passed in 1697. He also condemned the draconian bill to preserve the king's person, complaining that &#145;men of no religion, nay that scoffed at all religion &hellip; should impose on men that had some, though an ill one&#146;. Specifically, he considered that the arbitrary power it was proposed to vest in magistrates was a breach of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>, while to take away men's lives or liberties for refusing to renounce an article of faith, the authority of the pope, amounted to religious persecution  (TCD, MS 750/1, pp. 134, 147&#150;50).<br>
<br>In 1702 King published his most important philosophical work, <span class="italic">De origine male</span> (<span class="roman">The origin of evil</span>). Conceived as a reply to the scepticism of Pierre Bayle and his followers, this took as its starting point the argument that we can achieve a pragmatic if necessarily incomplete knowledge of God, as a unitary, omnipotent and perfect first cause, by analogy from His works. Although God had created the best possible world, evil existed owing to the necessary imperfection of created things, the natural evil created by the movement of matter according to physical laws, and the moral evil arising from the existence of human free will. The book attracted comment from Bayle as well as from Leibnitz and others. An English translation by Edmund Law appeared in 1731 and went through five editions by 1781. King's other major philosophical work, his published sermon <span class="italic">Divine Predestination and Foreknowledge, Consistent with the Freedom of Man's will</span> (1709), sought to reconcile divine omniscience and human freedom by arguing that God's foreknowledge of events, which we know only by analogy, should not be assumed to be identical with that of humankind. Although King is often described as drawing on Lockean epistemology, Kelly (in <span class="italic">The Dictionary of Eighteenth-Century British Philosophers</span>) emphasizes instead his debt to older scholastic concepts. Berman (in his introduction to Carpenter's edition of the sermon) has characterized his overall philosophical outlook as &#145;theological representationalism&#146;, noting the debt to his fellow Irish bishop Peter Browne.<h2>
<a name="ArchbishopofDublin17031729"></a>Archbishop of Dublin, 1703&#150;1729</h2>On 11 March 1703 King was appointed archbishop of Dublin. He approached his duties with the same scrupulous concern for propriety, attention to administrative detail, and rigorous disciplinary zeal that he had shown in Derry. Writing to Francis Annesley on 24 March 1713, he admitted that he was not surprised by claims that he was excessively strict:<blockquote>&hellip; on recollection I remember I have degraded four from their orders. I have laid in jail two excommunicated clergymen who died there. I have writs or warrants out against three more. I have discovered six or seven with counterfeit letters of orders and some in good places turned out on that account. I have deprived of their living six or seven and have suspended or otherwise censured about 30. Add to these many that I have rejected from orders, several to whom I have refused benefices or institution for want of qualifications and the many I have chid or reproved, both publicly and privately. (TCD, MS 750/4/1, pp. 133&#150;4)</blockquote>In addition to measures against unsatisfactory clergy King was particularly insistent on refusing to ordain those who seemed to him unprepared or unsuited for the clerical life, or for whom there was no realistic prospect of employment. There were also more positive achievements. During King's episcopate the number of churches in repair in the diocese rose from 27 to 69, while he claimed in 1727 that he had built eleven glebe houses. As in Derry he fiercely defended the legal rights of the see. In 1704 he began what was to be a twenty-year struggle to establish his jurisdiction over Christ Church Cathedral. The dean and chapter accused King of invading their liberties as a royal foundation. He insisted that the issue was a matter of ecclesiastical discipline, alleging that the chapter had failed to supply clergymen or provide for the repair of churches in the twenty-seven parishes appropriated to it. A first legal battle, over rights of visitation, commenced in 1711; a second, arising from the chapter's refusal to admit King's nephew, Robert Dougat, whom he had appointed archdeacon of Dublin, began in 1715. Both dragged on until 1724, when the British House of Lords gave final judgment in King's favour.<br>
<br>At national level King was by now a leading spokesman for the established church. He took a leading part in the attempt to persuade Queen Anne to redirect for ecclesiastical purposes the former papal dues known as the first fruits and twentieth parts, and vigorously opposed attempts in 1707&#150;8 to secure the removal of the sacramental test. He also joined in the campaign which eventually secured a meeting of convocation in 1703. He initially saw this revival of the representative body of the clergy as the best means of tackling the church's institutional weaknesses, and on 16 January 1705 supplied the prolocutor of convocation, Samuel Synge, with a long list of proposed reforms, covering pluralities, non-residence, the qualifications of candidates of ordination, and the supply of curates in large or appropriated livings  (TCD, MS 750/3/1, pp. 67&#150;72). In 1709 the chief secretary paid tribute to his success in damping down an unproductive debate on the issue of dissent, reporting that &#145;the archbishop is looked upon as the oracle of the church party in this kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Letters of Joseph Addison</span>, ed. W. Graham, 1941, 144). However King became increasingly disillusioned at the failure of convocation to implement the sort of practical reforms he had advocated, although he placed the blame for this failure mainly on his fellow bishops, who had repeatedly failed to respond to initiatives sent up from the lower house.<br>
<br>As conflict between whig and tory intensified during Anne's reign King wrote critically of what he saw as the unnecessary importation into Ireland of the factional divisions of English politics. The only issue that concerned the protestants of Ireland, he insisted, was the maintenance of the protestant succession. His own political principles remained conservative. In 1701, for example, he complained to Bishop Thomas Lindsay of Killaloe that the powers to be given to the English privy council under the <span class="roman">Act of Succession</span> made the monarch &#145;a princeps concilii&#146;, adding that &#145;I cannot but with concern think to what a pass the king has brought the monarchy by a republican ministry&#146;  (21 March 1701, TCD, MS 750/2/2, p. 88). In December 1710 he observed that if the new tory ministry &#145;go on as they begin &hellip; they will confound whiggism&#146;  (King to Francis Annesley, 16 Dec 1710, TCD, MS 2531, p. 238). As late as January 1714 he sought to dissuade leading whigs from taking what he considered the extreme step of voting against the crown's choice of speaker.<br>
<br>The new whig ministry's choice of King as one of the three lords justices appointed on 4 September 1714 can thus be seen as reflecting his status as a known supporter of the protestant interest in its two great crises of 1688&#150;90 and 1710&#150;14, rather than any strong party affiliation. King himself supported the impeachment of the English tory leaders, but argued that the majority of the rank and file had been unaware of their Jacobite intrigues and that all well-affected men should be fairly treated. Later, however, he sought to minimize and defend as reasonable the extensive purge of tory office holders of all levels that had in fact taken place  (TCD, MS 2533, pp. 116&#150;17). Lord Coningsby, in a confidential report to George I, described him as &#145;a perfectly honest man, truly zealous for your Majesty and your service but entirely a stranger to the business he is engaged in&#146;  (PRONI, D638/145). However King's own correspondence suggests that he approached his duties confidently and systematically, dealing firmly but without undue panic with the Irish repercussions of the Jacobite rising in England and Scotland in 1715. He continued as lord justice until 6 September 1715, and was to serve again from 22 February to 27 April 1717, and from 25 November 1717 to 31 May 1719.<br>
<br>Despite this political prominence King's relationship with the new whig establishment was an uneasy one. One major reason was his continued commitment to the defence of the established church and the containment of dissent. As before, he saw the main threat as coming from the Presbyterians of Ulster. He maintained a watchful opposition to further attempts in 1715&#150;16 to secure the repeal of the test. Writing to Archbishop Wake of Canterbury on 24 March 1716 he insisted that the Ulster Presbyterians were wholly different from English nonconformists: &#145;they are a people embodied under their lay elders, presbyteries and synods, &hellip; and will be just so far the king's subjects as their lay elders and presbyteries will allow them&#146;  (TCD, MS 2533, p. 165). However, he also opposed legal concessions to Quakers on the grounds that they did not subscribe to what he considered fundamental Christian doctrines, and joined with Bishop Moreton of Kildare in attempts to force French protestant refugees to conform to the liturgy of the Church of Ireland. In the same way his vigorous opposition to the <span class="roman">Irish Toleration Act</span> of 1719 was motivated less by the negligible improvement it brought to the status of Presbyterians than by the absence of any requirement that those claiming its protection should make even the most basic profession of Christian faith, so that &#145;Jews, Turks, deists, pagans, &amp;c. may all set up for teachers&#146;  (Mant, 2.342).<br>
<br>Where Catholics were concerned King remained critical of existing policy. He supported the proposals of the Revd John Richardson in 1712 to promote a new missionary effort by producing bibles and prayer books in Irish, and criticized the lukewarm response of his fellow bishops, although he also privately suggested that Richardson had been precipitate in launching his scheme without proper backing. Shortly after the accession of George I, in January 1715, he addressed two long letters to the new lord lieutenant, the earl of Sunderland, condemning what he saw as the ruinous policy of subjecting Catholics to excessively severe penal laws that were not then enforced, and calling for a more consistent approach. He opposed bills in 1719 and 1723 which sought to impose new and harsher penalties on unregistered priests. By 1727, on the other hand, he had come to feel that policy had moved too far in the opposite direction, complaining that he did not &#145;remember Popery so rampant, or so much encouraged, as at present, except in King James's time&#146;  (Mant, 2.487).<br>
<br>When new lords justices were appointed in October 1719 King was not included, explaining to Archbishop Wake that, by his opposition to the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> and other measures, &#145;I have quite lost the favour of the government here&#146;  (Mant, 2.337). He was, however, reappointed to the lord justiceship between 31 January 1722 and 13 August 1723, although this was only, according to his own account, to facilitate the exclusion of Lord Chancellor Midleton  (TCD, MS 750/7, p. 88). Henry Downes, bishop of Killala, one of the English-born bishops who had repeatedly been made aware of King's hostility, believed that his show of indifference at being excluded in 1719 merely concealed his mortification at the implied loss of consequence. Downes was likewise sceptical of King's claims in 1722 that his reappointment to the office would kill him, suggesting that &#145;perhaps he would have been as uneasy had he been left out of the government&#146;. He also reported that King had made his fellow lords justices &#145;sick of him&#146;, because he left such &#145;invidious work&#146; as the signing of patents for pensions to them, &#145;and serves himself at the expense of their and some other greater person's honour&#146;  (Nichols, 2.497, 536, 556).<br>
<br>By this time King had emerged not only as a critic of whig laxity in religious policy but as an intransigent defender of Ireland's constitutional rights. The insistence of the British House of Lords on its entitlement to deliver final judgment in the case of <i>Sherlock v. Annesley</i> in 1719 revived the issue of legislative and judicial autonomy that had arisen in his own dispute with the Irish Society. King led the Irish lords in having the Irish barons of the exchequer taken into custody for implementing the decision of the British house, and in drawing up a &#145;Representation&#146; reasserting their status as the court of final appeal. William Nicolson, the English-born bishop of Derry, reported that he had become the &#145;darling&#146; of the mob, and that &#145;The Angel of St Patrick's is now the Guardian of the Kingdom&#146;  (McNally, 159). In 1720&#150;21 he opposed the proposal for an Irish bank, and in 1722&#150;5 he was a prominent opponent of Wood's halfpence. On 19 December 1723 the lord lieutenant, the duke of Grafton, reported to Walpole that King<blockquote>is very indiscreet in his actions and expressions, pretty ungovernable, and has some wild notions, which sometimes make him impracticable in business, and he is to a ridiculous extravagance, national. Upon some points (of which the jurdisdiction of the house of lords is a principal one) he loses both his temper and his reason. (Coxe, 2.357)</blockquote>Even after the ministry had capitulated King sought to drive home the victory by adding to the Lords' resolution of thanks a reference characterizing the surrender of the patent as an instance not just of the king's &#145;goodness&#146; and &#145;condescension&#146; but also of his &#145;great wisdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters &hellip; Boulter</span>, 1.41&#150;2).<br>
<br>King was also largely responsible for the sharp divide that emerged in the years after 1714 between bishops of Irish and English origin. In the immediate aftermath of the change of government in August 1714 the new whig ministry had taken King's advice in filling three vacant bishoprics. However the appointment of the Welshman John Evans to Meath in 1716 and of the Englishman William Nicolson to Derry in 1718 caused outrage in Irish church circles. King complained bitterly that English churchmen, having squandered the resources of their own church for short-term profit, were now beginning to invade the better managed Irish establishment, and that the disposal of the best dioceses to outsiders left native clergy with little incentive to diligence or self-improvement. In the case of Nicolson he took his revenge by insisting that he should take the most junior place on the episcopal bench in the House of Lords, despite having held an English bishopric for sixteen years. Tensions were further exacerbated when five recently appointed outsiders broke ranks to support the <span class="roman">Toleration Bill</span>, leaving King to complain to an English correspondent that the measure could have been defeated &#145;if your brethren that came from your side the water had not deserted us&#146;  (King to Annesley, 10 Nov 1719, TCD, MS 750/5, p. 200). Later, in 1722, he refused to consecrate Josiah Hort as bishop of Ferns and Leighlin, objecting to his dissenting background and claiming that he had not been properly ordained; instead Hort had to be consecrated by a specially constituted commission composed of three English bishops.<br>
<br>Following the death of Thomas Lindsay, archbishop of Armagh, on 13 July 1724 there was speculation that King might succeed him as primate. In the event the see went to Hugh Boulter. King's attitude to thus being passed over remains unclear. A well-known anecdote, first recorded by Orrery in 1752, presented him as greeting Boulter on their first meeting, from a chair in his parlour, with the sarcastic comment that he was too old to rise. King himself insisted that he had resisted pressure from friends to press his claims on the grounds that &#145;a crazy, lame and superannuated primate&#146; could be of no service to either the church or the kingdom  (King, <span class="italic">A Great Archbishop</span>, 248 n. 4). However this was precisely the sort of self-denial that Bishop Downes had earlier dismissed as spurious. What is clear is that Boulter from the start regarded King as the leader of a rival &#145;Irish&#146; faction within the church, whose influence should be systematically curbed by further appointments of Englishmen as sees became vacant. By contrast one of the executive's leading parliamentary managers, Marmaduke Coghill, reporting in September 1727 on attempts by Midleton, now openly in opposition, to woo King, believed that the archbishop could be kept in good humour for the coming session by a kind message from the king (&#145;it would captivate the old gentleman, who is highly pleased with such compliments&#146;) and possibly the bestowal of a living that he sought for his nephew  (BL, Add. MSS 21122, fol. 32).<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>William King was the single most important Irish protestant churchman of his era. He was also a central figure in Irish intellectual life for four decades. In addition to his theological writings and his <span class="italic">State of the Protestants</span> he was an early member of the Dublin Philosophical Society, to which he presented papers on a range of scientific topics. Two of these, on the origin of Irish bogs (1684) and on the use of sea shells as manure (1708), were published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>. However a mock speech printed at the time he received his DD (1688) derided his bad Latin, and a modern editor has likewise commented on the &#145;curious Latin&#146; of his autobiography  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 19). His extensive personal correspondence, mainly preserved in Trinity College, Dublin, makes him almost certainly the most thoroughly documented figure in late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century Ireland, and provides a vivid if often opinionated depiction of political and ecclesiastical affairs. Richard Mant in 1840 and Sir Charles King in 1906 presented uniformly favourable accounts of a dedicated churchman and great reforming bishop and archbishop. Contemporary opponents such as Downes and Boulter suspected that his declarations of disinterested principle could also mask personal ambition, malice, and resentment. Yet even Grafton, while deploring his political volatility, described him as &#145;charitable, hospitable, a despiser of riches, and an excellent bishop&#146;  (Coxe, 2.357). Patrick Kelly has suggested plausibly that King's childhood experiences in an Ulster devastated by civil war, and what he saw as his providential survival during the crisis of 1688&#150;90, provided the basis for his unwavering commitment to the constitution in church and state as the only guarantees against anarchy.<br>
<br>Portraits of King in middle life suggest a man of average build with broad, regular features. An anonymous contemporary account stated that he had acquired from his schoolmaster at Dungannon &#145;an habit of speaking in the Scotch dialect that he lamented all his days after, &hellip; which, with a kind of lisping and stammering natural to him, render his voice and manner of speaking very ungraceful&#146;  (G. T. Stokes, <span class="italic">Some Worthies of the Irish Church</span>, 1900, 149 n. 1). He suffered from gout from the early age of twenty-five. His autobiography records how his labours in St Werburgh's led to a collapse in his health, forcing him to go to England to take the waters at Tunbridge Wells. Complaints of illness recur throughout his later correspondence, but his survival until the age of seventy-nine suggests a strong constitution. He never married. A funeral sermon claimed that he had chosen &#145;a single life&#146; so as to be able to devote as much as possible of his resources to charity, but he himself admitted to Swift in 1712 that he had &#145;an awkward way of address to ladies&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Jonathan Swift</span>, 1.290). He died at the episcopal palace of St Sepulchre on 8 May 1729 and was buried in St Mary's Church, Donnybrook, on 10 May. He left his property, valued at &pound;17,000, to public purposes, including the Archbishop King's lecturership in divinity at Trinity College, Dublin, which he had founded in 1718.<br>
