<span class="headword">Ogston, Sir  Alexander</span>  (1844&#150;1929), <span class="occ">surgeon and bacteriologist</span>, was born at Ogston's Court, 84 Broad Street, Aberdeen, on 19 April 1844, the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20622/', "Francis Ogston (bap. 1803, d. 1887)")</script>, physician, and his wife, Amelia Cadenhead (<i>d</i>. 1852). After attending Archibald Storrie's school and the public school, Aberdeen, Ogston attended Marischal College, Aberdeen (1859&#150;65), where he graduated MB CM in 1865 and MD in 1866. During the winter of 1863&#150;4 he took the winter course at the University of Vienna; he then attended the summer session in Berlin, which was followed finally by two months in Paris. He became fluent in French and German and made friends with a number of continental physicians. After qualifying Ogston made another European visit before returning to Aberdeen, where he entered general practice. Between 1865 and 1873 Ogston was assistant to his father, who by this time was professor of medical jurisprudence at Aberdeen University. On 25 September 1867 Ogston married Mary Jane, daughter of James Hargrave of Stoke Newington, London; they had two sons and two daughters; following her death, he married on 1 August 1877 Isabella Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1847/8), daughter of James Matthews, architect; they had four sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>From 1868 to 1872 Ogston was joint medical officer of health for Aberdeen, and in 1872 he was given charge of the city's smallpox isolation hospital. After being appointed ophthalmic surgeon to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in 1868 he became junior surgeon (1870) and acting surgeon (1874); he was senior surgeon from 1880 until his resignation in 1898, when he became consulting surgeon. At Aberdeen University he was lecturer in practical ophthalmology (1869) and examiner in medicine (1873&#150;6). Following the retirement of Professor William Pirrie in 1882 Ogston became regius professor of surgery, a post he was to hold for twenty-seven years.<br>
<br>An early convert to Lister's methods, in 1880&#150;81 Ogston, using a technique devised by H. H. R. Koch, examined for bacteria in more than 100 abscesses. After obtaining samples of pus from some ninety of his patients and examining them microscopically and by staining he concluded that of two main types of cell frequently present in cultures, one always accompanies suppuration and is normally absent in &#145;cold&#146; cultures. A comprehensive study over two years confirmed that the properties of the <i>Staphylococcus</i> isolated from or tested in cultures of a variety of small mammals were independent of species, justifying the conclusion that <i>Staphylococcus</i> is a specific organism. After Ogston's death William Bulloch acknowledged &#145;his pioneer bacteriological work on inflammation and suppuration&#146;, and noted that &#145;It is not generally recognized that many of the current doctrines of infection and metastatic generalisation of bacteria really emanated from him&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, 309).<br>
<br>A tall, commanding figure, Ogston was a slow, deliberate lecturer who never used an unnecessary word or repeated himself. He particularly enjoyed making sly digs at those he considered as being &#145;armchair theorists&#146;. As a surgeon Ogston was a meticulous planner who clung to the use of the antiseptic spray &#145;so that before the operation was far advanced the well of the theatre was shrouded in a mist&#146;  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 326). Early in his career Ogston had been interested in bone surgery and the operation he devised for genu valgum was practised widely until it was replaced by William Macewen's method. Ogston published widely in medical journals between 1868 and 1902.<br>
<br>Ogston also took a keen interest in military surgery. In 1885 he set out for Egypt to take part in the war of 1884&#150;5. After service on the hospital ship <i>Ganges</i> he joined the first bearer company and worked with the wounded at Hasheen and Suakin. He was awarded the Egyptian campaign medal and the khedive's bronze star. After his return home Ogston in 1887 took advantage of being vice-president of the surgical section of the British Medical Association to deliver a thorough criticism of the conditions faced in Egypt by the British forces, especially the deficiencies in medical care. His criticisms so offended some sections of the medical establishment that he was not allowed access to the theatre of war in South Africa in 1899&#150;1900, forcing him to appeal directly to Queen Victoria to intercede on his behalf. During his seven months in South Africa, Ogston was cold-shouldered by some of the medical authorities but was well treated by the military. However, his recommendations made after the Egyptian campaign were yet to have any significant effects.<br>
<br>On his return Ogston was appointed a member of the committee to consider the future organization of the army medical corps. During the First World War he acted as operating surgeon to the Southall Auxiliary Military Hospital, during the winter of 1914&#150;15, before being given charge of a hospital detachment at Belgrade. In 1916 he became operating surgeon to the first British ambulance unit in Italy and worked with the second Italian army. He was awarded the Cavalier order of the Crown of Italy in 1920. His <span class="italic">Reminiscences of Three Campaigns</span> was published in 1919.<br>
<br>Ogston was appointed surgeon-in-ordinary in Scotland to Queen Victoria, Edward VII, and George V. He was created LLD by Glasgow University (1901) and Aberdeen University (1910), and became KCVO in 1912. Ogston died at his home, 252 Union Street, Aberdeen, in the early hours of 1 February 1929. He was survived by two sons and five daughters.<br>
