<span class="headword">Buxton,  Noel Edward  Noel-</span>, first Baron Noel-Buxton  (1869&#150;1948), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in London on 9 January 1869, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32225/', "Sir (Thomas) Fowell Buxton (1837&#150;1915), third baronet")</script> and director of a brewery company, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55114/', "Lady Victoria Buxton (1839&#150;1916)")</script>, daughter of the earl of Gainsborough. He grew up in the family house of Warlies in Essex, in a family of ten children. He was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge (1886&#150;9), where he gained a third in the historical tripos. In 1889 he went to work at the family brewery in Spitalfields, and became involved in social work in the area through the missions and the settlement movement. With his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74568/', "Charles Roden Buxton")</script> and his cousin Conrad Noel, he used to dress in old clothes and spend nights in &#145;common lodging-houses&#146; to get closer to the poor  (Anderson, 27). In 1901 he contributed to the volume of essays on the problems of city life, <span class="italic">The Heart of the Empire</span>, edited by C. F. G. Masterman. His social conscience and commitment to charitable work remained constant features in his life, and from 1919 onwards he directed part of his income to the achievement of &#145;social and economic progress&#146; through a special trust administered by the family. Buxton's social work also developed into ambitions for public service. He became a member of the Whitechapel board of guardians in 1897, and stood unsuccessfully for the London county council. He was unsuccessful in his first parliamentary contest as a Liberal candidate in Ipswich in 1900, but was elected to parliament for Whitby at a by-election in 1905, only to be voted out again the following year in the general election.<br>
<br>Buxton took a year's leave from his work at the brewery in 1892 to travel to Japan, and his encounters with Buddhism in the Far East inspired him to give up blood sports. Travel became an important influence on his life, and he published several books describing his experiences abroad. In 1896 he went to Australia to assist his father, who was then governor of South Australia. A visit to the Balkans in 1899 began a long-lasting fascination with that part of the world and a passion for the cause of oppressed minorities in the region. He helped to found the Balkan Committee in 1902, along with his brother Charles, Noel Brailsford, and James Bryce; he became its first chairman, and later (1907) its president. When the Turks suppressed a revolt in Macedonia in 1903, Buxton travelled with his sister Victoria to see conditions there for himself and to administer aid.<br>
<br>In 1904 Buxton resigned his position as a director at the brewery and began to focus his attention on the eastern counties, taking an interest in the new wave of agricultural trade unionism and encouraging the development of smallholding on his family's Norfolk estate. He was elected Liberal MP for North Norfolk in January 1910, and while campaigning in the constituency he met his future wife, Lucy Edith Burn [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70448/', "Buxton, Lucy Edith Noel- (1888&#150;1960)")</script>]; at the time she was canvassing on behalf of his political opponent. He lived first in the family properties of Runton Old Hall and then Colne Cottage, before purchasing Paycockes, a house at Coggeshall in Essex, which had been a home for the Buxton family in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. He restored the property to its original timbered appearance and presented the house to the National Trust in 1920.<br>
<br>From 1911 onwards Buxton became increasingly vocal on foreign affairs, launching initiatives to defuse Anglo-German hostility, engaging in relief work in Bulgaria with his brother the Revd Harold Buxton during the hostilities of 1912, and taking up the cause of Armenia in 1913. On the outbreak of war in 1914 he and his brother Charles travelled to Bulgaria on a mission to secure the country's support for the allies or, failing that, its neutrality. Their diplomatic efforts were unsuccessful, but the brothers became local heroes in Bulgaria after they were wounded during a Turkish assassination attempt; a street in Sofia was named Brothers Buxton Street in tribute.<br>
<br>Buxton married Lucy Burn on 30 April 1914 and they had six children: three girls and three boys. During the First World War he worked for the Admiralty, and promoted the Armenian cause on a visit to the United States in 1916. The entry of the US into the conflict seemed to spell an end to any hope of the negotiated peace which he had been promoting, and alongside this disillusionment he was also increasingly disenchanted with the Liberal Party and its leadership. He lost his North Norfolk seat at the 1918 general election, and in 1919 he joined the Labour Party, arguing that it represented what the Liberal Party should be doing but no longer did. He became a close friend and travelling companion of the Labour leader, Ramsay MacDonald. He was active in the party's committee on international questions, calling for the revision of the Versailles settlement and for economic reconstruction, and became treasurer of the Fight the Famine Council.<br>
<br>In 1922 Buxton returned to the House of Commons, winning back his old seat of North Norfolk, this time under Labour colours. Although foreign affairs remained his main political interest, he agreed to take on the agricultural portfolio, which was of particular relevance to his rural constituency. He became minister of agriculture in the first Labour government in 1924. One of the few positive legislative achievements of that short-lived administration was the <span class="roman">Agricultural Wages Act</span> which he piloted through parliament, securing the reinstitution of minimum wage legislation in agriculture. He returned as minister of agriculture in the Labour administration of 1929, but retired from the Commons on medical advice in June 1930. Despite his opposition to the principle of hereditary political power, he agreed to take the title Baron Noel-Buxton of Aylsham, Norfolk, on 17 June 1930, changing his surname to Noel-Buxton by deed poll. After he had taken his seat in the Lords, his wife briefly represented his old constituency of North Norfolk in the Commons.<br>
<br>During the 1930s Noel-Buxton's energies were directed largely towards charitable work and campaigns on the international stage. He was president of the Save the Children Fund from 1930 to 1948, and chaired the Miners' Welfare Committee from 1931 to 1934. He agitated for the worldwide abolition of slavery, a cause to which he felt a special obligation as a continuation of the work of his ancestor Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, the &#145;Great Liberator&#146;. He visited Abyssinia in 1932, on the invitation of its emperor, to advise on a programme for ending slavery in the country. He remained a critic of the Versailles settlement and was a committed advocate of the appeasement of Germany, arguing that Germany must be given a colonial role in Africa. Even during the Second World War he continued to promote the idea of a negotiated peace. In 1945 he stood down as president of the Balkan Committee, hoping that a younger and more energetic figure would take his place, but the position remained unfilled, and the organization itself collapsed soon afterwards.<br>
<br>Among his papers Noel-Buxton left a list headed &#145;My lost causes&#146;, which included Armenia, Macedonia, and Germany. At the end of his life many of the ideals for which he had campaigned seemed to have been defeated. Although he sat as a Labour MP and later as a Labour peer, he remained a liberal in his social radicalism and his approach towards foreign policy. His manner was restrained and dignified, and colleagues recalled that they had never heard him raise his voice. He wore a beard to cover the scar on his face which was a lasting reminder of the assassination attempt in Bulgaria. He died in London on 12 September 1948, and was buried in the family graveyard at Upshire in Essex.<br>
