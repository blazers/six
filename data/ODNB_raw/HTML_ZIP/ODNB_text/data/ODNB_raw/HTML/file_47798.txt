<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Leyland,  Thomas</span>  (1752?&#150;1827), <span class="occ">merchant and banker</span>, is thought to have been born in 1752, one of the two known children (he had a sister) of Richard Leyland of Knowsley, Lancashire. Nothing is known about his early life. By 1768, however, he was employed by Edward Bridge, cooper, of Liverpool. He then entered service with Gerald Dillon, an Irish trader, and by 1774 was his partner, having borrowed &pound;500 to invest in the business. It was an inspired investment; in December 1776 they won &pound;20,000 in the state lottery. Six months later Leyland married Ellen Bridge (<i>c</i>.1755&#150;1839), daughter of his former employer, who had died in 1775. The marriage failed to produce children, but Leyland received one third of Ellen's mother's estate when she died in 1782.<br>
<br>By this time Leyland was in business on his own, having dissolved his partnership with Dillon in 1781. During the next twenty years his commercial affairs blossomed as he diversified from the Irish trade into the trades in olive oil, sherry, wine, and African slaves. The last was particularly important since its capital requirements encouraged him to form alliances with other local merchants. In March 1790 investment in slaving voyages by Thomas Leyland &amp; Co. stood at over &pound;36,000. Leyland remained active in the trade until its abolition in 1807. Some voyages yielded rich dividends and undoubtedly contributed to his growing fortune.<br>
<br>Seen as &#145;a man of amazing shrewdness, sagacity, and prudence&#146;  (Hughes, 177), Leyland remained appreciative of early good fortune, naming one of his ships <i>Lottery</i>. Others, appropriately, were named <i>Enterprise</i> and <i>Fortune</i>. His growing wealth was accompanied by expanding business premises in Liverpool, and by 1800 he had offices and warehouses in Duke Street, Henry Street, York Street, and Nova Scotia. Two years later he purchased the 300 acre estate of Walton Hall, said to be &#145;a residence admirably suited for a commercial Gentleman of the first importance&#146;  (ibid., 172).<br>
<br>In 1802 Leyland became a partner in the banking firm of Clarkes and Roscoe of Dale Street. As William Roscoe had abolitionist sympathies, this was a strange alliance, but Leyland strongly supported Roscoe when he stood successfully as a whig at Liverpool in the election of November 1806. Within two months, however, Leyland had left Roscoe's firm to establish his own bank, taking his nephew Richard Bullin as partner, and in May 1807 strenuously opposed Roscoe's re-election, accusing him of a &#145;bitter mortification&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>). Interestingly, Roscoe finished bottom of the poll. In 1809 Richard's brother Christopher joined the new banking firm, now known as Leyland and Bullins. Based first in York Street and after 1816 in King Street, the bank prospered; between 1812 and 1827 customers' deposits doubled to &pound;1.2 million, while loans to the public tripled to nearly &pound;300,000. Following Leyland's death in 1827, it survived until 1901 under the guidance of the Bullins and, from 1849, the Naylors&#151;Leyland's niece Dorothy having married in 1809 John Naylor of Hartford Hill, Cheshire.<br>
<br>Until the mid-1790s Leyland's interests were almost wholly centred on business, but his political standing in Liverpool rose in tandem with his wealth. In 1796 he was co-opted on to the Liverpool town council, and two years later was elected mayor. He was re-elected in 1814 and 1820. In addition to local office-holding, Leyland was also nominated in 1816 to challenge George Canning at a parliamentary by-election in Liverpool. Noted for his parsimonious nature, Leyland was a very reluctant candidate&#151;Canning dubbed him &#145;a man of straw&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>)&#151;and refused to campaign seriously; it was, Canning claimed, &#145;a struggle with an invisible phantom&#146;  (Hughes, 176). Despite his evident lack of interest, Leyland polled nearly 750 votes compared to his rival's 1260. He refused to be nominated for the 1818 parliamentary election, but in 1823 became a JP and deputy lieutenant for the county of Lancaster.<br>
<br>Said to be &#145;a fine-looking man, with what some thought a stern and forbidding, but what we should call a firm and decided, look&#146;  (Hughes, 177), Thomas Leyland died on 29 May 1827 at his home, Walton Hall, Liverpool. He was buried in the family vault at Walton church, Liverpool. He was survived by his wife, Ellen, who died in 1839. The main beneficiaries of his will were his wife and his nephews, Richard and Christopher Bullin, who subsequently adopted the name and arms of Leyland.<br>
