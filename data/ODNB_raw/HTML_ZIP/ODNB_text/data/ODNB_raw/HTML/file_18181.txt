<span class="headword">Martin, Sir  George</span>  (1764&#150;1847), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the youngest son of William Martin (<i>d</i>. 1766), captain RN, and his wife, Arabella, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24228/', "Sir William Rowley")</script>, admiral of the fleet. His grandfather Bennet Martin MD was a brother of William Martin, admiral of the fleet. Many members of his mother's family attained naval distinction, and by her second marriage, to Colonel Gibbs of Horsley Park, Surrey, Martin was half-brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10607/', "Major-General Sir Samuel Gibbs")</script>. From an early age he was on the books of the yacht <i>Mary</i>, but he seems first to have gone afloat in December 1776, when he joined the <i>Monarch</i> as &#145;captain's servant&#146; with his uncle Captain Joshua Rowley. On 27 July 1778 he was present in the action off Ushant, and following his uncle to the <i>Suffolk</i>, was in the battle of Grenada on 6 July 1779, and in the three actions off Martinique in April and May 1780. On 16 July 1780 he was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Russell</i>. He was afterwards with his uncle in the <i>Princess Royal</i> at Jamaica. On 9 March 1782 he was promoted to the command of the sloop <i>Tobago</i>, and on 17 March 1783 was posted into the <i>Preston</i> (50 guns). He returned to England early in 1784.<br>
<br>From 1789 to 1792 Martin commanded the <i>Porcupine</i> (24 guns) on the coast of Ireland, and in 1793 the <i>Magicienne</i> (32 guns) in the West Indies. In 1795 he was appointed to the <i>Irresistible</i> (74 guns), and in her took part in the battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797. At the close of the battle Nelson, whose own ship, the <i>Captain</i>, had been disabled, hoisted his broad pennant on the <i>Irresistible</i> for a few days. On 26 April two Spanish frigates, <i>Ninfa</i> and <i>Santa Elena</i>, coming home from the West Indies and ignorant of the blockade, were chased by the <i>Irresistible</i> and the frigate <i>Emerald</i> into Conil Bay. The <i>Santa Elena</i> went on shore and broke up, but the <i>Ninfa</i> was captured and became part of the British navy fleet under the name of <i>Hamadryad</i>. The skill and dash with which Martin took the ships past a dangerous reef that blocked the approach to the bay won for him the warm commendations of Lord St Vincent.<br>
<br>In July 1798 Martin was appointed to the <i>Northumberland</i> (74 guns), in which, on 18 February 1800, he assisted in the capture of the <i>G&eacute;n&eacute;reux</i>. From May 1800 he had charge of the blockade of Malta, and on 5 September received the surrender of Valletta. In 1801 he was with the fleet on the coast of Egypt under Lord Keith. In 1803 he commanded the <i>Colossus</i> in the channel, in 1804 the <i>Glory</i>, and in November 1804 was appointed to the <i>Barfleur</i>, in which he took part in the action off Cape Finisterre on 22 July 1805. On 9 November 1805 he was promoted rear-admiral. In 1806 he was second in command at Portsmouth, and in 1807 was employed on the blockade of Cadiz. He was afterwards in the Mediterranean under the orders of Lord Collingwood&#151;for the most part on the coast of Italy or Sicily. In June 1809 he took possession of Ischia and Procida. On 23 October, with the fleet off Cape St Sebastian, he was detached in pursuit of a small squadron under Rear-Admiral Baudin. Two days later two of the pursued ships of the line ran themselves on shore not far from Cette, and on 26 October were abandoned, set fire to, and blown up. One ship of the line and one frigate got into Cette harbour; another frigate escaped.<br>
<br>On 31 July 1810 Martin was promoted vice-admiral, and was again employed on the coast of Sicily, and in co-operation with the army under Sir John Stuart, for which he received the order of St Januarius from the king of Naples. From 1812 to 1814 he was commander-in-chief in the Tagus, and in the summer of 1814 was knighted, when the prince regent visited the fleet at Spithead.<br>
<br>Martin married first, on 3 April 1804, the youngest daughter (<i>d</i>. 15 October 1806) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2159/', "Captain John Albert Bentinck RN")</script>, grandniece of the duke of Portland. He married secondly, on 2 June 1815, A. Locke (<i>d</i>. 1 March 1842), daughter of William Locke of Norbury Park, Surrey. Apparently there were no surviving children. On 2 January 1815 he was made a KCB, and a GCB on 20 February 1821. On 19 July 1821 he attained admiral, and from 1824 to 1827 was commander-in-chief at Portsmouth, with his flag in the <i>Victory</i>. In January 1833 he was appointed rear-admiral of the United Kingdom, and vice-admiral in April 1834. He was made a GCMG in 1836, and was promoted admiral of the fleet on 9 November 1846. He died at his house in Berkeley Square, London, on 28 July 1847.<br>
