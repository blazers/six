<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hill,  Wills</span>, first marquess of Downshire  (1718&#150;1793), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 30 May 1718 at Fairford, Gloucestershire, the third but only surviving son of Trevor Hill, first Viscount Hillsborough (1693&#150;1742), landowner, and Mary (1684&#150;1742), daughter of Anthony Rowe of North Aston, Oxford, and widow of Sir Edmund Denton, first baronet, of Hillesden, Buckinghamshire. His first name was received from General Sir Charles Wills, one of the sponsors at his baptism.<h2>
<a name="Familybackgroundandpoliticalbeginnings"></a>Family background and political beginnings</h2>The family's fortunes had been linked with Ulster since 1573, when Moyses Hill joined Walter Devereux, first earl of Essex, on his expedition to colonize Antrim. The connection with co. Down was established in 1607. A series of judicious marriages saw estates and titles grow, so that in 1742 Wills Hill inherited, at twenty-four, an Irish viscountcy, control of five seats in the Irish parliament, and estates that enabled him to succeed his father as lord lieutenant of co. Down, a dignity he held for the rest of his life. Moreover, in the previous year he had been elected member of parliament for Warwick. Entry into the Irish House of Lords in November 1743 completed formal proof of his Anglo-Irish political standing.<br>
<br>Thereafter, Hillsborough demonstrated an unwavering ambition to advance himself. His first success was to be created, on 3 October 1751, Viscount Kilwarlin and earl of Hillsborough in the Irish peerage. Five years later, on 17 November 1756, he acquired the British title of Baron Harwich of Harwich and so left the House of Commons. Continuing to be known as Hillsborough, he became, on 28 August 1772, Viscount Fairford and earl of Hillsborough in the British peerage. A final promotion occurred on 26 August 1789 when he was styled marquess of Downshire, though this he was obliged to accept as an Irish title. He never succeeded in becoming lord lieutenant of Ireland nor secured an Irish dukedom. This unremitting pursuit of advancement did not escape notice. It has been pointed out  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 4.458n.) that he secured a barony, two viscountcies, two earldoms, and a marquessate, making him, by this reckoning, the equal of Wellington and twice as honoured as Nelson.<br>
<br>Despite being involved in politics for almost half a century, Hillsborough attracted only fitful attention. He has no biographer and is barely mentioned in many scholarly studies. Only between 1763 and 1774 was his role in English politics of sufficient prominence to gain much notice.<br>
<br>Hillsborough was returned as MP for Warwick in May 1741; an absence of private correspondence and an equal lack of commentary&#151;nothing is known of his education or upbringing&#151;obscure his connection with the Greville family through whom he secured an unopposed election. He quickly became a regular, if hardly significant, contributor to the proceedings of the house. He first made his mark as an opposition whig, connected with Bubb Dodington and Viscount Barrington, and his speeches won the approval, not to be immutably sustained, of Horace Walpole, who noted in March 1751, when Hillsborough moved the address of condolence on the death of the prince of Wales, that:<blockquote>Lord Hillsborough was a young man of great honour and merit, remarkably nice in weighing whatever cause he was to vote in, and excellent at setting off his reasons, if the affair was at all tragic, by a solemnity in his voice and manner that made much impression on his hearers. (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; George II</span>, 1.56)</blockquote>Contemporaries noted his love of opera.By now, Hillsborough had abandoned opposition and become a supporter of government, a shift matched by that of William Greville, seventh Lord Brooke, the proprietor of his seat at Warwick. A reward was his becoming, in October 1751, earl of Hillsborough in the Irish peerage. Winning the approval of the duke of Newcastle he was appointed, in May 1754, comptroller of the household and an English privy councillor. This began his identification with the monarchy: he has been judged &#145;of all George III's ministers, the most convinced &#147;King's Friend&#148;&#146;  (Pares, 171n.).<br>
<br>A further advance was not long delayed: in December 1755 Hillsborough became, at Newcastle's instance and with Henry Fox's support, treasurer of the chamber, a position he gave up in November 1756 when the Pitt&#150;Devonshire ministry was formed. His consolation was to receive the English title of Lord Harwich and thus a place in the House of Lords. This was too high a price to be acceptable to George II but Devonshire insisted that it had to be met. Hillsborough could claim Fox, George Grenville, and Halifax as friends and he also had not incurred the hostility of William Pitt. Even so, it was a promotion that recognized the needs of ministerial reconstruction, not his political merit.<br>
<br>Marriage on 1 March 1748 to Lady Margaret Fitzgerald (1729&#150;1766), daughter of the nineteenth earl of Kildare and Mary O'Brien and sister of James, first duke of Leinster, rendered Hillsborough's connections with Fox as much family as political: the wives of Leinster and Fox were sisters, daughters of the second duke of Richmond. Their eldest daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68357/', "Mary Amelia Cecil")</script>, became a renowned political hostess. Assisted initially by a &pound;20,000 dowry, Hillsborough acquired further estates. In 1749 he bought lands at Bainbridge and developed a centre for the linen trade. He also undertook the rebuilding of Hillsborough. Additional estates were inherited in 1751 on the death of a distant relative, Marcus Trevor, second Viscount Dungannon. Absence from office and the House of Commons after 1756 made possible an increased attention to Ireland. On a visit to Ulster in September 1758 Mrs Delany was invited to Hillsborough, which she found set in &#145;a very fine cultivated country, little inferior to some parts of Gloucestershire&#146;. An intention to build a new house and bestow the present residence on the bishop of Down was announced. Despite this activity, Hillsborough still came no more than &#145;once a year for a month or two, to set forward his works&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography &hellip; Mrs Delany</span>, 3.512&#150;14). Great landlord of co. Down he might be, but that did not make him its leading resident.<h2>
<a name="TheyearsofAmericanpolicy17631772"></a>The years of American policy, 1763&#150;1772</h2>Hillsborough returned to government in September 1763, one of the ministerial changes occasioned by the departure of Bute, the death of Egremont, and the elevation of his friend George Grenville. He replaced Shelburne as president of the Board of Trade, an office he would hold until dismissed by Rockingham in July 1765. Exceptionally conscientious as an administrator, he was absent from only three of the 262 meetings of the board convened during his presidency. Against this, no influence on ministerial policy can be discerned. Even if his statement in parliament, after the event, is accepted, that &#145;he thought the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> was inexpedient, had advised against it when first proposed&#146;  (Basye, 142&#150;3), the act had been passed and Hillsborough never threatened to resign. Accounts of this major political crisis hardly mention him.<br>
<br>During Hillsborough's presidency the Board of Trade's principal task was to acquire and assess details and views relating to imperial policy and possessions. The aftermath of the Seven Years' War and the territorial gains secured at the treaty of Paris in 1763 provided an abundance of referred topics, ranging from American Indian relations and colonial land grants to the administrative incorporation of new American and Caribbean possessions and the collection of reports on tensions in the colonies. But the board, while it could formulate, did not initiate policy. That was the function of members of the cabinet.<br>
<br>The significance of American events was all too evident to an Irish peer long hostile to any growth of parliamentary powers in Dublin. In 1751 a pamphlet was published entitled <span class="italic">A Proposal for Uniting the Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland</span>; it was believed by contemporaries and is accepted by historians to have been Hillsborough's work. The author argued that a union would bring new members to Westminster willing to support the interests of prince and people, not those of &#145;an unnecessary malignant opposition to his measures&#146;  (Sedgwick, 2.141). A meeting of the Irish parliament in 1759 showed that Hillsborough was still thought to hold these views. Fears that a French invasion might occur during a Commons recess had brought proposals that emergency meetings should then be called. Opponents declared that not only would this give undue control to the administration but that Hillsborough, who was present, was leading a plot to bring about union and abolish parliament. On 5 December several thousand demonstrators engaged in an anti-union riot without and within the Dublin parliament. Although Hillsborough always gave precedence to his English ambitions, Irish mistrust remained constant.<br>
<br>In July 1765 Rockingham replaced Grenville and Hillsborough was forced from office. A year later in August 1766, on the return of Chatham, he was restored to his post. Rather curiously, he accepted on conditions of exclusion from the cabinet and the power of the board being reduced to the provision of reports. His connections with Fox and an unwillingness to encounter Chatham at close quarters may have curbed an inveterate pursuit of position. He wished, he explained to Grenville, &#145;that I might do the business in an easy manner to myself&#146;  (Thomas, <span class="italic">British Politics</span>, 288&#150;9). If this was his hope, it would not be fulfilled: the business of the board continued much as before. A further reduction of his labours was achieved at the end of 1766 when he was appointed joint postmaster-general&#151;&#145;laid up in lavender &hellip; till he shall be wanted elsewhere&#146;, as Barrington put it  (ibid., 289). It was a position that ranked two steps below cabinet level but which, in exchange for occasional light duties, provided an annual income of about &pound;2900. Thus rewarded, Hillsborough could remain, in a truly &#145;easy manner&#146;, present on the political scene.<br>
<br>It was a well-timed break from ministerial responsibilities. Had he remained at the Board of Trade, Hillsborough would inevitably have been involved in Charles Townshend's attempt, by raising an American revenue, to resolve the financial problems of an administration from which its leader, Chatham, had dissociated himself. A faltering ministry, faced with collapse after Townshend's sudden death in September 1767, required reconstruction by the duke of Grafton. Major concern with American problems warranted the creation of a new, third secretaryship of state. But who should fill it? A process of elimination by age, experience, and factional commitments left Grafton with Hillsborough. Availability, rather than merit, earned him this promotion in January 1768.<br>
<br>As the new secretary Hillsborough faced three major issues: the fate of the Townshend duties, the extent and form of western settlement, and the provision of government for Quebec. All held particular significance for an Anglo-Irish landlord, involving as they did the raising of revenues from reluctant local bodies, economic and social development in areas which resisted control, and the consequences of admitting an overwhelmingly Catholic population into a governmental system hitherto confined to protestants. Their consideration confirmed Hillsborough's conservative fears.<br>
<br>Learning of Hillsborough's appointment, American colonial agents in London offered a guarded welcome. William Samuel Johnson reported home to Connecticut that the new secretary &#145;is esteemed a nobleman of good nature, abilities, and integrity; is a man of business, alert, lively, ready, but too fond of his own opinions and systems, and too apt to be inflexibly attached to them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Trumbull Papers</span>, 252). On the other hand, it might prove the case that, as a native of Ireland possessing &#145;vast property&#146; there, he would have &#145;formed reasonable notions of the rights and liberties of the distant branches of this empire&#146;  (ibid.). Of this hope, Johnson would soon be disabused.<br>
<br>Since Hillsborough had declared that he was urging North, the new chancellor of the exchequer, to repeal the Townshend duties, Benjamin Franklin's first impressions were not unfavourable. Whatever view Hillsborough may have held, his belief in colonial subordination took priority and was challenged by American responses. In February 1768 the Massachusetts house of representatives dispatched a circular letter to the other continental colonies, urging agreement that only their assemblies should impose taxes. Informed of this by Governor Francis Bernard, the secretary issued his own circular letter, in which he announced that all American governors must combat this &#145;open opposition to and denial of the authority of Parliament&#146;, if necessary by the prorogation or dissolution of assemblies  (Thomas, <span class="italic">Townshend Duties Crisis</span>, 81).<br>
<br>It was of no avail. Eight colonies had responded positively to Massachusetts before Hillsborough's letter reached their governors, and the other four did so by the end of the year. In Massachusetts his demand for the rescinding of the circular letter was rejected on 30 June by ninety-two votes to seventeen, numbers that in the struggle became synonymous with patriots and tories. Colonial resistance, expressed through non-importation agreements, intensified after Hillsborough in June 1768 instructed General Gage to send troops to Boston. During the next four years, though the repeal of the <span class="roman">Townshend Acts</span> in March 1770, whereby only the duty on tea was retained to assert parliamentary authority, reduced popular disorder, Hillsborough devised no solutions. The long-standing difficulties created by the needs of Quebec, disputes with the colonial assemblies, the absence of effective support for governors and officials, remained unresolved. Bostonian opposition was marked by the daubing of properties of suspected tories with &#145;Hillsborough paint&#146;&#151;compounded of faeces and urine.<br>
<br>The problems of western expansion and Indian relations persisted. Decisions were needed on the territorial extent and direction of settlement and on the maintaining of frontier peace, issues that brought Hillsborough's resignation as secretary of state in August 1772. The immediate cause was a proposal to create a colony on the Ohio. To be called Vandalia, as a compliment to the queen, it would have been the first established in North America beyond the Atlantic seaboard. Hillsborough's opposition was unwavering but had led to his encouraging the project's supporters to apply for an even larger grant. Intended to ensure its rejection, this did not work. Much to the dismay of North, who resisted to the end the loss of &#145;one of the best and firmest friends I have in the Cabinet&#146;  (Marshall, 731), Hillsborough's enemies, led by Rochford and supported by Gower and Suffolk, refused to accept his indefinite avoidance of a decision. The king deplored the conflict, but admitted that it was due in part to &#145;suspicion in Lord Hillsborough&#146;  (ibid.). The secretary of state's resignation did not weaken North's position, since Dartmouth, an old friend and member of his family, agreed to accept the office. But by mid-August 1772 the case for the new colony appeared to be won, its opponent having been defeated and driven from office.<h2>
<a name="Outofoffice17721779"></a>Out of office, 1772&#150;1779</h2>As consolation, Hillsborough received a constantly coveted prize&#151;advancement in the peerage. On 28 August 1772 his Irish became a British earldom. He did not join the opposition, though he had lost authority: his attempt in May 1774 to block Dartmouth's proposal for the westward extension of the boundary of Quebec was flatly rejected. The rapidly growing resistance of the American colonies reinforced Hillsborough's opinions. When the new parliament met on 30 November 1774, he moved the Lords' address &#145;in a very long and severe speech on the colonies&#146;  (<span class="italic">Last Journals of Horace Walpole</span>, 1.410). At no time during the years of the American war did he express any sympathy for the rebels or support moves towards peace.<br>
<br>Having resigned, Hillsborough turned his attention to co. Down. Although he admitted, a month later when back at Hillsborough, to his undersecretary, William Knox, that &#145;I did not, you know, wish to resign&#146;, he claimed that he was &#145;not now at all sorry&#146;. He continued:<blockquote>I have totally forgotten that I was ever concerned in public business, and am so employed in church-building, road-making, farming and every rural occupation that belongs to an estate and a country gentleman that I go to bed every night very much tired, and find little time for anything else. (<span class="italic">Various Collections</span>, 6.108)</blockquote>By then he had remarried, following the death of his first wife on 25 January 1766. Mary Stawell, Baroness Stawell of Somerton (1726&#150;1780), whom he married on 11 November 1768, the only daughter and heir of Edward, fourth Baron Stawell, and the widow of Henry Bilson-Legge, brought Hillsborough another substantial dowry.<br>
<br>Hillsborough's resignation certainly did not serve to extinguish an ambition to become lord lieutenant of Ireland, even though this met continual rejection. When in October 1776 an appointment was giving much trouble to North, the king declared that only Hillsborough must be excluded. With landed estate solely in Ireland an unacceptable precedent would be established. Further, as the entire cabinet was aware, &#145;I am sorry to say, I do not know a man of less judgment than Lord Hillsborough, and consequently less qualified to fill that office with dignity or propriety&#146;  (George III to John Robinson, 15 Oct 1776, <span class="italic">Abergavenny MSS</span>). Departure from government did not lead to longer stays in Ulster. Although he watched zealously over the economic and political interests of his estates and dependants, visits took place in the summer months. Any political prospect, including the hope of becoming lord lieutenant, derived from London. If that hope persisted, so did his reputation for duplicity.<h2>
<a name="Returntooffice17791782"></a>Return to office, 1779&#150;1782</h2>In November 1779 Hillsborough returned to office, replacing Weymouth as secretary of state for the southern department. Typically, this represented a last political resort of an increasingly beleaguered North, not a strengthening of the ministry. It may have revived Hillsborough's Irish ambitions since the southern secretary acted as the ministerial link with the lord lieutenant and, theoretically, could thus exercise a crucial influence. There is no indication, however, that Hillsborough did so. On entering office he had declared to the lord lieutenant that he was &#145;very little acquainted with the Politics &amp; Intrigues of Dublin&#146;  (Johnston, 86). Certainly, officials dominated, even directed, the ensuing correspondence between Whitehall and Dublin. Hillsborough's presence in government attracted little attention in respect of either Irish or foreign affairs. That is not to say that Irish issues, especially demands for trade equality and the formation of the volunteers, could be overlooked. Hillsborough's opening remarks, as was his custom, sought to please. He declared that he had accepted office on the understanding that Ireland and England would be put on an equal commercial footing. He thus yielded as a matter of expediency to a popular demand whose consequences he feared more than welcomed.<br>
<br>In London during June 1780 Hillsborough's apprehensions of mob activities were renewed as the Gordon riots threatened property and his security. The continued growth in Ulster of a movement whose Dungannon convention of February 1782 gave prominence to what Hillsborough had initially applauded but now called &#145;Your cursed Volunteers and Patriots&#146;  (Bardon, 215) left him in a state of alarm. He experienced this even in Hillsborough when the visit of the lord lieutenant was greeted at a corporation dinner by a toast to the Volunteers. &#145;Ld H cried &#147;Fy, fy, fy,&#148; and each time knocked his hand on the table&#151;Do you know, Sir, there is not a toast could be more disagreeable to G'ment&#146;  (Young, 170).<br>
<br>Hillsborough's vehement reactions to challenges to authority never changed: as late in the American war as November 1781, he declared in the Lords that &#145;he hoped that the independence of America would never be admitted in that House, nor that a majority of their lordships would consent to a measure which, if it should be adopted, must prove the ruin of this country&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 22, 1781, 661). But with the failure of the war and the downfall of North's ministry, loss of office was inevitable. If he did not, others knew the price he would pay. As the duke of Rutland, lord lieutenant in 1786, remarked: &#145;Lord Hillsborough's uniform principle is <i>perseverance</i> in anything once adopted&#151;in spite of the changes which time and events may have produced&#146;  (duke of Rutland to Lord Sydney, 29 Jan 1786, <span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 3.279). His last speech in the Lords, on 24 January 1786, had provided confirmation as he once again &#145;recommended a union with Ireland as the best method of connecting and consolidating the interests of both kingdoms&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 25, 1786, 996).<h2>
<a name="Lateryears"></a>Later years</h2>This did not mark Hillsborough's final involvement in politics. That followed closely upon his securing in 1789 the Irish marquessate of Downshire. His son and heir, Lord Kilwarlin, now became earl of Hillsborough but continued, as he had since 1776, to represent County Down in the Irish House of Commons. His last election in 1783 had cost about &pound;3000, but this bore no comparison to that of 1790 which saw the family's claim to both county seats challenged by the young Robert Stewart, the later Lord Castlereagh. His family mounted an &#145;independent&#146; campaign to break the Downshire hold on both seats. A bitter, extended, and costly election ensued: polling the 6000 electors occupied sixty-nine days until Stewart won a seat.<br>
<br>The contest was sufficiently expensive to prevent Stewart from completing his Mount Stewart mansion house and to generate additional Downshire debts. If the family fortunes had benefited from advantageous marriages, settlement charges had subsequently diminished them: at Downshire's death in 1793 the estate was &pound;69,600 in debt. His end was not unexpected. There were frequent references to &#145;old age&#146; during his later years. After suffering a stroke in the autumn of 1790, he died at Hillsborough Castle on 7 October 1793, having &#145;wholly retired for some years&#146; from public and political affairs  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 63/1, 1793, 962). He was buried at Hillsborough.<br>
<br>Both contemporaries and historians have judged Hillsborough adversely: by the time of the Falklands crisis in 1770 he had become to Horace Walpole &#145;a pompous composition of ignorance and want of judgment&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; George III</span>, 3.133), while Wraxall, noting his attention to public business, thought &#145;his natural endowments, however solid, did not rise above mediocrity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historical and Posthumous Memoirs</span>, 1.381). George III did not withhold criticism of however faithful a servant: &#145;Lord Hillsborough&#146;, he complained, &#145;always puts things off to the last minute, and though an amiable man, the least a man of business I ever knew&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, ed. Fortescue, 5.418). A modern historian has commented that &#145;No historian has had a good word to say for Hillsborough&#146;  (Shy, 292), although his commitment, as distinct from his achievements, while secretary of state for America has won some recognition. Even so, the failure of British policy in the American colonies between 1768 and 1772 must be related to its direction by Hillsborough.<br>
<br>Found charming on occasion, particularly by women, to whom he was known affectionately as the Black Earl, Hillsborough sustained a political presence through persistence, not talent. He possessed no parliamentary following at Westminster and was insufficiently skilful as either minister or politician to prevail in his own right. That he should have been one of the leading Irish magnates to participate in English politics in the second half of the eighteenth century provides some indication of the comparative political talent of the peers of the two kingdoms.<br>
