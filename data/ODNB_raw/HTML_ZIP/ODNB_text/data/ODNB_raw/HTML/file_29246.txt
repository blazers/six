<span class="headword">White,  James</span>  (1759&#150;1799), <span class="occ">historical novelist</span>, was born in Dublin. He became a scholar of Trinity College, Dublin, in 1778 and graduated BA in 1780. Nothing is known about his family, or the reasons that brought him to England where he spent the rest of his life.<br>
<br>White was an accomplished translator, poet, and novelist. The first signs of his enduring interest in public affairs are already evident in his translation <span class="italic">The Orations of Marcus Tullius Cicero Against Caius Cornelius Verres</span> (1787), which coincided with the impeachment of &#145;another provincial governor&#146;, Warren Hastings of the East India Company, in which White became involved  (Tompkins, 147). This work was followed by a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Hints for a specific plan for an abolition of the slave trade and for the relief of the negroes in the British West Indies</span> (1788). In this spirited abolitionist tract, White manages to combine his polemical spirit with hard-headed arguments and a wry sense of humour in the vein of Jonathan Swift: if skin colour and facial features are valid criteria for designating human beings as &#145;a species of traffic&#146; such as &#145;elephant teeth, wax and leather&#146;, he argues, why not have laws &#145;authorizing all <i>dunces</i> to be exported from time to time and sold in the West Indies? &hellip; The kingdom would be disburthened of many able-bodied blockheads, and the duty of exportation would advantage the revenue&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hints</span>, 7). White bases his abolitionist thesis on his impressive knowledge of the relevant classical, contemporary, and legal literature. In a coherent and structured way he refutes the main arguments for slave trade one by one, appealing to both the humanity and the common sense of his readers. Fully aware of how hard it would be to convince a &#145;commercial people&#146;, such as the British, to espouse his cause, he took pains to tabulate the costs of importing and maintaining slaves, as compared to converting them into paid workers, and advocated the phasing out of slavery in conjunction with setting up a welfare programme for the benefit of black workers in the British Caribbean  (<span class="italic">Hints</span>, 12&#150;27). Some of his proposals spring from a keen sense of patriotism, often bordering on nationalism, and are in line with colonial aims. Nevertheless, his indignation at the savage practice of human trafficking is genuine: &#145;British brutality has become proverbial&#146;, he laments, unafraid to be critical of the laws and institutions that sanctioned it  (<span class="italic">Hints</span>, 12).<br>
<br>White's next two works, <span class="italic">Conway Castle</span> (a poem and the only of White's works to have received unfavourable reviews) and <span class="italic">Earl Strongbow</span>, a Gothic novel, were published in 1789&#151;a year that shook France and sent a shiver through Pitt's government in Britain. Both <span class="italic">Earl Strongbow</span> and the novels that followed it&#151;<span class="italic">The Adventures of John of Gaunt</span> (1790) and <span class="italic">The Adventures of King Richard, Coeur-de-Lion</span> (1791)&#151;attracted only moderate attention, though <span class="italic">Earl Strongbow</span> was hailed by at least one reviewer as a work in which &#145;the reflections are ingenious and just, not a few of them deep and severe&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1790). All three novels bear White's trademark penchant for satire and strong engagement with political issues. While their plots abound with labyrinthine castles, loquacious spirits, and &#145;very mouldy and mouse-eaten&#146; manuscripts  (<span class="italic">The Adventures of John of Gaunt</span>, iv), these novels often read like whimsical parodies of their Walpolian and Radcliffean prototypes. Drollery notwithstanding, White's comments on contemporary political and social issues are hard to miss, and Tompkins suggests that the character of Strongbow is a direct reference to Lord Temple, former lord lieutenant of Ireland  (Tompkins, 151).<br>
<br>In 1792 White published two translations: the <span class="italic">Speeches of M. de Mirabeau</span> and <span class="italic">The History of the Revolution of France</span>, from the work by Rabaut de Saint-&Eacute;tienne. In his preface to the latter White is overtly critical of the state of affairs in Britain. Though he takes care to emphasize that, unlike France, Britain does not need a revolution, he clearly believes that the French example should be the inspiration for political and social reform at home.<br>
<br>The bulk of White's works appeared at a time when the surge of violence in France led to widespread fear of insurrection in England, and when Jacobin sympathies, even as moderate as White's, were likely to arouse suspicion. Indeed, among the critics of Pitt's government several became the target of state-employed spies and suffered for their vociferousness. Suspicion, tension, and rumours of conspiracy theories were rife among both Jacobins and anti-Jacobins. In this context it is tempting to ask whether the &#145;freakish personality&#146;  (Tompkins, 146) that White developed towards the end of his life&#151;the main manifestation of which was the delusion that he was the victim of conspiracies&#151;might not have had some basis in reality.<br>
<br>It seems that White's mental decline was triggered by the double blow of financial hardship (for which he blamed London booksellers) and frustrated love for a nameless lady: he hardly ate, and was often seen wandering the streets of Bath (where he had, apparently, some relations) looking increasingly haggard and deranged. In between bouts of insanity, White appears to have written a series of (as yet untraced) &#145;Letters to Lord Camden on the state of Ireland&#146; which were praised for &#145;the elegance and strength of the language, the shrewdness of his remarks, and the perspicuity of his arguments&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1799, 443)&#151;further proof of White's lifelong commitment to public affairs. It appears that at some point a small collection was raised for his relief, which White (by all accounts a proud man) accepted only reluctantly. He used the money to retire to the Carpenter's Arms in Wick, Gloucestershire, where he lay himself down in his bed, refusing all food. He lasted only a few days: the coroner's inquest is dated 15 March 1799. His obituaries stated that he was unmarried.<br>
