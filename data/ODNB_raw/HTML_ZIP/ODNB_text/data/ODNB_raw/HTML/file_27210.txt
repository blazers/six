<span class="headword">Tomas ab Ieuan ap Rhys</span>  (<em>c.</em>1510&#150;<em>c.</em>1560), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was the son of Ieuan ap Rhys Brydydd, and the grandson of the late fifteenth-century master poet Rhys Brydydd and a cousin to the more famous Lewis Morgannwg (<i>fl</i>. 1520&#150;1565). He belonged to the leading family of traditional bards in the district of Tir Iarll in upper Glamorgan; however, he lived in Tythegston, not very far from Bridgend. Little is known about his life, but his earliest work undoubtedly predates the dissolution of the monasteries, and in one of his compositions he sang the praises of the abbey of Margam. Another of his <i>cwndidau</i> (short religious songs or carols), which contain many scriptural references, is a metrical version of the parable of the sower. He states in one of his poems that he had been imprisoned in the town of Kenfig, but the circumstances surrounding his incarceration are far from clear.<br>
<br>In general Tomas's work, which occasionally reflects personal and contemporary social problems, reveals that, notwithstanding his family connections and some instruction in the bardic craft, he did not have a firm grasp of the traditional bardic lore, while the poem he sang on the <i>cywydd</i> metre to the rood in Llangynwyd shows that he did not adhere, as did the professional bards, to the conservative standards of the literary language. Nevertheless, he was anxious not to be classed with the lower-grade itinerant poetasters and minstrels, who had gained a reputation for the composition of satirical verses. When his wife, of whom nothing is known, sent him &#145;to gather seed-corn in the Vale&#146;, he was enjoined never to satirize under any circumstances.<br>
<br>Even so, Tomas readily adopted in his poetry the style and metres of the inferior grade of bards and minstrels, and freely used colloquial and dialectal forms, which the master poets consistently eschewed. Moreover, he employed these metres not only in his <i>cwndidau</i>, but also&#151;and this is rather unusual&#151;in the panegyrics and elegies he sang to members of such leading county families as the Herberts, the Stradlings, and the Gamages. Another interesting feature of his work is the opposition it expresses to protestantism, as well as the evidence it provides for the poet's great sense of loss as a result of the destruction of the old Catholic faith and its time-honoured ceremonies. Not surprisingly, he was overjoyed at the accession of Queen Mary in 1553, whom he compared with the Blessed Virgin.<br>
<br>The elegy which Tomas's friend and pupil, the gentleman-poet Hopcyn Tomas Phylip (<i>d</i>. 1597) of Gelli'r-fid, Llandyfodwg, sang to him shows that he also instructed the younger generation of <i>cwndidwyr</i> who came after him. It refers to his great learning, to his profound knowledge of the scriptures, to his understanding of astrology, and to his grasp of the work of the heraldic bards, who recorded the genealogies and coats of arms of the Welsh gentry. Obviously he had received much of the instruction that was imparted to the professional poets, to whose rigorous linguistic and metrical standards, nevertheless, he did not generally adhere in his own work.<br>
<br>Tomas ab Ieuan ap Rhys also composed prophetic verses (<i>daroganau</i>) not only in the traditional measures employed by the professional bards, but also in the metre called <i>triban Morgannwg</i>, the earliest surviving examples of which occur in his work. Indeed, it was as a vaticinator, even more than as an author of <i>cwndidau</i>, that he became renowned in Glamorgan. It was probably the reputation he had acquired in this connection that later prompted Edward Williams 
    (Iolo Morganwg; 1747&#150;1826)
   to fabricate so many remarkable stories about him.<br>
