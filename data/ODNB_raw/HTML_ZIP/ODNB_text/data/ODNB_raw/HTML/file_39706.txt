<span class="headword">Stanford,  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1552&#150;1616), <span class="occ">compiler of a manuscript miscellany</span>, was the fourth son of Sir William Stanford (1509&#150;1558), judge, of Hadley, Middlesex, and his wife, Alice (<i>d</i>. 1573), daughter of John Palmer. Henry's twin sister, Margaret, married Richard Astley, groom of the jewels and plate to Queen Elizabeth. Henry graduated BA from Trinity College, Oxford (23 October 1570), was elected a fellow of the college in 1572, and proceeded MA on 14 May 1573. He was ordained about 1579, held the benefices of Checkley and Handsworth in Staffordshire, but served from at least 1580 as tutor to William Paget, heir to the barony of Paget. Stanford copied his pupil's poetical new year's gifts (1582&#150;7) to various members of this staunchly Catholic family into his private manuscript anthology, now in Cambridge University Library (MS Dd.5.75). He probably composed the verse epitaph for William's aunt, Lady Anne Lee (<i>d</i>. 1590), inscribed on her monument in Aylesbury church. Texts of the poem in Stanford's hand are preserved in this manuscript and another at Berkeley Castle.<br>
<br>William's father, Thomas, second Baron Paget, had fled to the continent after the exposure of the Throckmorton plot in 1583; he was attainted of treason early in 1587. Sir George Carey gained custody of young William, and Stanford accompanied his charge into the Carey household where he served as both tutor and chaplain. The Carey family's artistic patronage and standing at court placed Stanford in a stimulating cultural atmosphere that included access to &eacute;lite texts in manuscript circulation. His anthology preserves verse he wrote for members of the Carey family along with works by the age's leading courtier poets: Sir Philip Sidney, Sir Edward Dyer, Sir Arthur Gorges, Sir Walter Ralegh, and Queen Elizabeth herself. About 1589, through Carey's father, Lord Hunsdon, lord chamberlain of the royal household, Stanford sent verses of his own composition to Queen Elizabeth.<br>
<br>Stanford's Catholic connections caused him numerous difficulties despite his ordination in the Anglican church. On 2 September 1586, just weeks after the exposure of the Babington plot, he was examined by local authorities at Portsmouth &#145;as a man to be in som sort suspected&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/193/7), but there is no further explanation of what he was doing on the coast at this time or what punishment, if any, he received. His employment by the Pagets may also have encouraged the lawyer Richard Crumpton to seize his parsonage and glebe lands at Checkley for which Stanford sued him in chancery. As late as 3 April 1599, in a letter to Walter Bagot, Henry denied charges that he<blockquote>lived as a vagabond and recusant &hellip; When I taught Mr. Paget I was somoned uppon the same suggestions and cleared the matter in the court at Lichefeild. Lyving with my Lord Chamberlain as a dayly folower and having so many yeares byn his only houshould Chaplain, to be proscribed as a recusant cannot greatly touche me. (Bagot MS L.a.885)</blockquote>Yet Henry was at some other time touched by accusations about his faith. In an undated, holograph document addressed only to &#145;Syr&#146; and &#145;your worship&#146;, Stanford professed his belief in justification by faith, and denounced invocation of saints and the pope's supremacy, admitting in the process that &#145;I have byn so often chaleneged to hold and maynteyn erronious Doctrine&#146;  (Berkeley Castle muniments, gen. series, misc. MS 63).<br>
<br>In his will, George Carey, second Baron Hunsdon, bequeathed &pound;40 to Stanford. After Carey's death in 1603, Stanford apparently remained in the employ of his widow. He maintained a lively literary correspondence with her daughter, Elizabeth, Lady Berkeley, to whom he apparently sent his autograph copy of Ben Jonson's verse epitaph for Thomas Nashe. From time to time he instructed her son, George, in versifying, examples of which are preserved in CUL, MS Dd.5.75. Further evidence of his ties with Lady Berkeley is the sonnet in MS Dd.5.75 commending the translation of Camden's <span class="italic">Britannia</span> by her prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Philemon Holland. The poem was published in the edition of 1637.<br>
<br>Stanford was devoted to books and learning. In defending his religious position he cited specific works and passages from Gregory Nazianzen, Cyprian, Jerome, Basil, Plutarch, and Cicero. Verses that accompanied his new year's gifts to members of the Carey family mention Spenser's <span class="italic">Faerie Queene</span>, Popellimiere's <span class="italic">Historie of France</span>, <span class="italic">The Queene of Navarres Tales</span>, and Chapman's translation of <span class="italic">Homer</span>. He was one of the earliest contributors to the Bodleian Library, donating twenty-one volumes including copies of Vitruvius's <span class="italic">De architectura</span> and Copernicus's <span class="italic">De revolutionibus</span>. Additionally it has been discovered that over a hundred books in the Royal Library, all with imprints before 1601, belonged to and were annotated by Stanford. In all probability he presented them to Queen Elizabeth at about the same time that he made his gift of books to the new library at Oxford.<br>
<br>By 1610 Stanford was complaining of attacks of gout that made writing difficult. He apparently never married, and upon drawing up his will on 23 April 1614, he left &pound;200 each to his nephews Edward and Charles Stanford, sons of his eldest brother, Robert. He remembered Lady Berkeley and her son with gold rings. The will was proved on 2 November 1616; Stanford was probably buried at West Drayton, Middlesex.<br>
