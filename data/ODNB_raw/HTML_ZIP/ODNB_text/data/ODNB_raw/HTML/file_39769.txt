<span class="headword">Keene,  Theophilus</span>  (<em>c.</em>1680&#150;1718), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born into a dissenting family in London about 1680 and educated at a Presbyterian academy in Little Britain, London, in preparation for a teaching career. According to the sententious sketch of his life published by William Rufus Chetwood, Keene &#145;chose rather to quit a Fortune amongst his Wealthy Relations&#146; than to continue as a dissenter  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, ii). He learned to act first in the provinces with John Coysh, then with Joseph Ashbury's company in Dublin. At an unknown early date, he married a Mrs Wilmot. Keene was first advertised in a complex role in London at Drury Lane on 12 June 1705. In John Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Royal Merchant, or, Beggar's Bush</span> he portrayed Gerrard/Clause, an earl's stepfather, who, disguised behind a beard, has been named king of a local group of beggars. This assignment typifies Keene's line of business: serious older men, usually in tragedies, though also in tragicomedies or comedies that require maturity. Descriptions of him stress &#145;the Stamp of Majesty in his Presence, and the stern Roughness of a Soldier in his Voice&#146;; hence &#145;the Softness of a Lover&#146; did not &#145;sit so Natural upon him&#146;  (ibid., iv). Because of his &#145;manly Voice&#146; and &#145;Majestick Mien&#146;, his skill with the &#145;aweful Gesture&#146;, and his &#145;Godlike Form&#146;  (ibid., 2, 12, 18), he appeared regularly with Thomas Betterton, playing Claudius to his Hamlet, Duncan to his Macbeth, and Odmar to his Montezuma in John Dryden's <span class="italic">The Indian Emperor</span>. This fortunate early connection permanently affected Keene's playing style and later retarded his career, inclining him to favour old plays over new ones. Thus he took over Montezuma in <span class="italic">The Indian Emperor</span>, the Emperor in Dryden's <span class="italic">Aureng Zebe</span>, Mahomet in Joseph Trapp's <span class="italic">Abra-Mule</span>, and Heartwell in William Congreve's <span class="italic">The Old Batchelor</span>. The last is an example of his old man in comedy, as are Sir Edward Belfond in Thomas Shadwell's <span class="italic">The Squire of Alsatia</span> and Justice Balance in George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span>.<br>
<br>Keene was lured away from the patent company by John Vanbrugh, who signed him to the generous salary of 8<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. per acting day for the 1706&#150;7 season at his new theatre in the Haymarket  (Milhous and Hume, <span class="italic">Register</span>, no. 1866). At Drury Lane for the 1708&#150;9 season, Keene participated in a sham managerial committee, an assignment which ended in June when the owner, Christopher Rich, was silenced by the lord chamberlain following complaints from his leading actors. Keene continued there for 1709&#150;10, but Aaron Hill, who was appointed to oversee the company, so offended the actors that on 2 June 1710 they broke into the locked theatre and denied him access to the backstage area. Hill's account of the riot plausibly suggests that Keene and John Bickerstaff were being made cat's paws by more senior actors, all of whom were officially reprimanded. Keene spent the next four years in a completely subordinate position. He acquired some good supporting roles, such as Sullen in Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Beaux' Stratagem</span>, Lord Brumpton in Richard Steele's <span class="italic">The Funeral</span>, and Creon in <span class="italic">Oedipus</span> by John Dryden and Nathaniel Lee, but in Joseph Addison's <span class="italic">Cato</span> he got only the minor part of Lucius. Thus at the end of 1714 he took the opportunity to join John Rich's new company at the rebuilt Lincoln's Inn Fields theatre. There he played many of the same roles as before, but had the latitude to experiment with Macbeth, Timon in Shadwell's play of that name, Manly in William Wycherley's <span class="italic">The Plain Dealer</span>, the Governor in the musical version of Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Island Princess</span>, and Sir John Brute in Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Provok'd Wife</span>. He was less successful with the lead role in Thomas Southerne's <span class="italic">Oroonoko</span> (instead of his previous role, the Governor), and the Earl of Essex in John Banks's <span class="italic">The Unhappy Favourite</span> (instead of Burleigh).<br>
<br>At the beginning of the 1717&#150;18 season Keene and Christopher Bullock agreed to rent Lincoln's Inn Fields from John Rich and his brother. Keene, who was regarded as honest and good-natured, was probably a good choice to try to stabilize the venture, but his accomplishments are hard to assess. No financial record of this management survives, and changes in repertory take longer to accomplish than a single season. In an untimely accident on 23 July 1718 Keene was thrown from a horse, and he died two days later at his home in Cooks Court, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London. To mourn him, the rival theatres joined in a walking funeral with pallbearers from each company, and he was buried in St Clement Dane's on 30 July. The <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> suggest that Keene was widely admired and known for his charity to those in need, but no details of his private life are known. He appears to have been a reliable performer. However, the list of over 110 roles played in his short career suggests that he was more backward-looking than was ideal for a new company. Whether he could successfully have expanded his range is uncertain: he continued to bear the mark of the generation whose performing manner was influenced by Thomas Betterton and Joseph Ashbury. His wife survived him, and in 1720 was in business at Cooks Court hiring out masquerade habits; she also received benefits at Lincoln's Inn Fields until 1730, and may have been a dresser there until as late as January 1748.<br>
