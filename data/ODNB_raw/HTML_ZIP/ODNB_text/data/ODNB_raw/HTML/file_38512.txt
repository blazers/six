<span class="headword">Barrett,  Rosa Mary</span>  (1855&#150;1936), <span class="occ">social reformer and feminist</span>, was born in Jamaica, the youngest of the four surviving children of William Garland Barrett (1812&#150;1865), Congregational minister and sometime missionary to Jamaica, and his wife, Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fletcher (1811?&#150;1893). One brother was the leading Congregationalist George Slatyer Barrett; another was the scientist and electrical engineer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71319/', "Sir William Fletcher Barrett")</script>.<br>
<br>As a girl Rosa Barrett spent her pocket money on engaging a nurse to mind the children of charwomen who were out working, and in her early twenties she founded the first cr&egrave;che in Dublin at Kingstown. It became the Cottage Home for Little Children, for which she acted as honorary secretary for fifty years and which is still in operation today. Most of its first hundred admissions of children up to eight years old resulted from a family crisis&#151;usually the father's death, desertion, or drunkenness and violence&#151;which necessitated the mother working outside the home and meant that she was unable to care for her children in the daytime. In a few cases the children were placed&#151;with the surviving parent's permission&#151;for adoption with approved families in Canada. But for the most part poor mothers were enabled, by payment of a penny a day or less, to go out to work without fearing for hungry infants left to the dangers of an unsupervised home or the street. Rosa Barrett aimed to ensure a head start of proper feeding and good care for the poorest children in the community. She publicized the work of such cr&egrave;ches and the social need for them in <span class="italic">Our Kingstown Nursery</span> (1880), <span class="italic">Guide to Dublin Charities</span> (1884), and <span class="italic">The Cottage Home for Little Children: a Retrospect</span> (<i>c</i>.1905).<br>
<br>Rosa Barrett went on to found the Irish section of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) in 1889, after having discovered badly treated pauper children in a so-called &#145;home&#146; in Tuam. She called over an NSPCC inspector from London to investigate, and the persons responsible for the child neglect were imprisoned. Unfortunately the Catholic clergy were suspicious of the NSPCC on account of the number of protestants, including Rosa Barrett, on its Dublin committee. For her part, it is very possible that Rosa Barrett saw herself as something of a protestant mission worker and child rescuer in a benighted Catholic land.<br>
<br>In 1896 Rosa Barrett published a paper read before the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland entitled <span class="italic">Foreign Legislation on Behalf of Destitute and Neglected Children</span> and in 1899 she published her pamphlet <span class="italic">The Rescue of the Young</span>. Her work <span class="italic">Juvenile Criminals</span> (1900) was awarded the medal of the Howard Penal Reform League. Rosa Barrett later became the hagiographic biographer of Ellice Hopkins, the rescuer of child prostitutes and campaigner for raising the age of legal consent for girls to sixteen. Ellice Hopkins's &#145;thrilling accounts of her public work&#146; for the White Cross Men's Sexual Purity League constantly made Rosa Barrett feel ashamed  (Barrett, <span class="italic">Ellice Hopkins</span>).<br>
<br>Rosa Barrett supported other causes, including temperance, women's suffrage, and peace. Prominent in the Irish Women's Temperance Association, Rosa Barrett was also a co-founder with Lady Aberdeen of the National Women's Health Association for Ireland in 1907, which organized a public education campaign to combat tuberculosis, and she was later chosen to represent the Irish Women's Suffrage Federation in London in 1912, lobbying Irish MPs regarding Asquith's <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>. In 1915 Rosa Barrett gave her public support to the unpopular &#145;unpatriotic&#146; Women's International Congress in The Hague, which called for women's participation in foreign affairs and an alternative to war for settling international disputes. She herself was a widely travelled woman, having visited Canada, South Africa, Norway, and Sweden, among many other countries, and for several years she was the compiler of Ward Lock's <span class="roman">Irish Guides</span>.<br>
<br>Towards the end of her life Rosa Barrett completed her brother William Fletcher Barrett's book on Christian Science, <span class="italic">The Religion of Health</span> (1925). Later still she seems to have become involved with spiritualism, publishing accounts by a medium&#151;<span class="italic">The Seekers</span> (1928) and <span class="italic">Beyond</span> (1929). She died at her home, Cedarcot, 106 Handside Lane, Welwyn Garden City, on 28 August 1936. Although Rosa Barrett's practical work throughout her life was unremittingly serious and passionately altruistic, a correspondent in <span class="italic">The Times</span> (2 September 1936), who knew her personally, testified to her being a woman of keen humour and great charm.<br>
