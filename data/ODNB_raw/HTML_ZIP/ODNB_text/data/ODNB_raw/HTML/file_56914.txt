<span class="headword">Wood,  Paul Hamilton</span>  (1907&#150;1962), <span class="occ">cardiologist</span>, was born on 16 August 1907 at Coonoor, India, the second son of Richard Boardman Wood, civil servant, and Geraldine, daughter of Alfred Tomson, land agent. After his early education at Yardley Court, Tonbridge, Kent, Wood's father retired to Tasmania and Wood continued his education at Launceston College, Tasmania (1920&#150;24), and Trinity College, University of Melbourne (1924&#150;31). He excelled at sports but seems not to have displayed any outstanding academic ability at that time; a contemporary described him as &#145;busy &hellip; in the cultivation of friendships and the enjoyment of life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Medical Journal of Australia</span>, 683&#150;4). Certainly he needed two attempts to complete his final examinations before qualifying MB, BS, in 1931, and he subsequently failed to obtain a house appointment in Melbourne. He served as house physician and house surgeon at Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand, between 1931 and 1932.<br>
<br>In 1933 Wood returned to England, obtained a house-physician post at the Brompton Hospital in London, and passed the examination for membership of the Royal College of Physicians. He had still not shown himself to be in any way out of the ordinary and was uncertain about his next move. On 29 December 1934 he married Elizabeth (Betty) Josephine, daughter of John Guthrie, senior surgeon at the Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand; they had two sons and a daughter. About the same time Wood contemplated applying for an appointment at the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases. No such appointment was available but he met a fellow Australian who was resident medical officer at the National Heart Hospital and was looking for a <i>locum tenens</i>. Wood took the job and began a rise to eminence in cardiology for which only the hackneyed adjective &#145;meteoric&#146; seems appropriate. In 1935 he was invited by Francis Fraser to be one of his assistants, with full clinical and teaching duties, at the newly founded British Postgraduate Medical School at Hammersmith Hospital, and in 1937 he was appointed physician to out-patients at the National Heart Hospital. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Wood was given charge of an Emergency Medical Service unit at Mill Hill for the investigation and treatment of effort syndrome; he proved, for the first time, that this was a psychosomatic disorder. In 1940 he was awarded his MD by Melbourne University and in the same year he was elected fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, where he was Goulstonian lecturer in 1941 and Croonian lecturer in 1958. He became consultant cardiologist at the British Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith, in 1941. In 1942 Wood joined the Royal Army Medical Corps. He served in north Africa and Italy, reaching the rank of brigadier, and in 1946 he was appointed OBE.<br>
<br>After the war Wood returned to the Hammersmith as physician and senior lecturer, but he gave up this appointment in 1948, owing to increased responsibilities at the National Heart Hospital&#151;he had become dean and director of its newly formed Institute of Cardiology in 1947. He was also appointed cardiologist at the Brompton Hospital and it was at these two institutions that he spent the remainder of his career; he also maintained a private consultant practice.<br>
<br>By the late 1940s Wood was already held in high regard by his peers but it was the publication of his book <span class="italic">Diseases of the Heart and Circulation</span> (1950) which established his international reputation. Many other publications followed, mostly on those types of heart disease which could be treated surgically. He lectured throughout the world but it was at bedside teaching sessions that his unusual gifts of perception, analysis, and exposition were most prominently displayed. His ability to determine the exact nature of a patient's symptoms, by close questioning together with the sharpness of his eyes, the sensitivity of his fingers, and the acuity of his hearing, meant that he could acquire the maximum information from an encounter with a patient. These skills, together with an unusually rapid speed of thought and the ability to present his findings in precise and lucid English, were the basis of his reputation as a teacher. He was particularly noted for his ability to relate clinical findings to data obtained by investigations such as cardiac catheterization. To be able to interpret, in terms of disordered physiology, what could be seen, felt, or heard on examination was a skill which many learnt from Wood. Supreme at the bedside, he was never an experimentalist and his only weakness was his lack of formal training in physiology, which he himself lamented. Certainly some of his accounts of pathophysiology, outside his own particular field, verged on the simplistic.<br>
<br>Physically Wood was short, with a rather ascetic appearance but with what was described as an &#145;impish&#146; sense of humour. In debate he was forthright and he was certainly not always a comfortable colleague; he could make provocative, or even mischievous, interventions in discussions. Delighting in, and perhaps a little vain of, his speed of thought, with which he could appraise a new concept or demolish a weak argument, he could give offence to some who were struggling to keep up with him. Yet any tension was often dissolved by laughter and he was also described as having a warm, endearing personality.<br>
<br>Such little time as Wood had for relaxation he devoted to his home and garden, and he could apply his mind to a garden catalogue as assiduously as to a case history. Fishing near his country house, Fair Lady Lodge, West Runton, Norfolk, was another leisure pursuit. A cigarette smoker before the medical profession was fully aware of its hazards, he succumbed to a smoking-related disease. He had a heart attack while at work and made it clear that, if he were to suffer a cardiac arrest, resuscitation was not to be attempted. Wood died in the Middlesex Hospital, London, on 13 July 1962, survived by his wife and children. A memorial service was held at All Souls, Langham Place, London, on 30 July.<br>
