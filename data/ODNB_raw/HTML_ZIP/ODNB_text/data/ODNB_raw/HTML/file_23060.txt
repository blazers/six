<span class="headword">Ralph,  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1762), <span class="occ">historian and political writer</span>, was probably born between 1695 and 1710 in or near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but may possibly have been born in England. Nothing is known of his parents. By 1724 he was married to Hannah Ogden and had a daughter, Mary, who was born that year. He was living in Philadelphia and worked there as a clerk. An aspiring poet, he belonged to a literary society which included Benjamin Franklin, whom he befriended. Many years later Franklin recalled that Ralph was &#145;ingenious and shrewd, genteel in his manners, and extremely eloquent; I think I never knew a prettier talker&#146;  (Kenny, 219). In 1724, after what Franklin described as a falling-out with his wife's relatives, Ralph abandoned his family and left for London with Franklin. He never returned to America, but corresponded with his daughter, who remained there.<br>
<br>In December 1724 Ralph arrived in London. Living on money lent to him by Franklin, he set out to find work as an editor, as a copyist, and as an actor, but all without success. He had an affair with a milliner and lived with her for a time. He then moved to Berkshire in search of work, assumed Franklin's name, and found a job teaching at a village school. He wrote to Franklin asking him to look after his mistress in London. Franklin apparently misinterpreted Ralph's intentions and made sexual advances which were rebuffed. This put an end to their friendship and gave Ralph the opportunity to renege on the money he owed Franklin. In 1726 Franklin returned to Philadelphia.<br>
<br>Ralph now resumed his literary ambitions in London and in 1727 published a book of poetry, <span class="italic">The Tempest, or, The Terrors of Death</span>. This was followed by another, <span class="italic">Night</span> (1728), which sold well enough to go into a second edition. He now turned to literary polemics, for in 1728 he published an attack on Alexander Pope, <span class="italic">Sawney, an Heroic Poem Occasion'd by the Dunciad</span>. In this work of blank verse Ralph defended the Grub Street authors who had been ridiculed by Pope in the <span class="italic">Dunciad</span>. He provoked a withering counter-attack in a second edition of the <span class="italic">Dunciad</span>, in which Pope described him as a &#145;low writer&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Ralph believed that Pope's attacks turned the publishers against him and that his literary career suffered. At all events his career as a poet was over.<br>
<br>Ralph is often attributed with <span class="italic">The Touchstone</span> (1728), an anonymous work written &#145;by a Person of some Taste and some Quality&#146; which attacked the &#145;vitious Taste of the Town&#146; and bemoaned the decline of high comedy. However, a recent alternative attribution is to the translator Robert Samber. About this time Ralph caught the attention of the young Henry Fielding, and wrote the prologue to Fielding's <span class="italic">Temple Beau</span> (1730). Thus began a friendship and intermittent collaboration that lasted for more than twenty years. Fielding began managing the Haymarket Theatre in 1736 with Ralph as his assistant. Ralph owned shares in the theatre and advised him on his theatrical productions.<br>
<br>Ralph's <span class="italic">Fashionable Lady</span> was staged at the Goodman's Fields Theatre in April 1730. But he met little success as a playwright. In 1733 he was appointed surveyor of houses for Cambridgeshire, but apparently continued living in London; by the early 1750s, if not before, his home was in Chiswick. Fielding's plays satirized the Walpole ministry and led to the theatrical <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span> of 1737, which closed down the Haymarket Theatre and put Ralph in straitened circumstances. As he wrote in a plaintive begging letter to his friend Thomas Birch, &#145;all my schemes are broken as I feared&#146;  (Okie, 166).<br>
<br>Ralph now turned to political journalism and it was this that finally brought him a degree of financial security. He began writing occasionally for opposition newspapers in the early 1730s, contributing to the <span class="italic">Weekly Register</span> and <span class="italic">Daily Courant</span>. From 1737 to 1739 he covered parliament for the anti-ministerial <span class="italic">Universal Spectator</span>. In 1739 he resumed his collaboration with Fielding as co-editor of a new opposition journal, <span class="italic">The Champion</span>. Ralph wrote most of the political essays, attacking the government for its inept handling of the &#145;war of Jenkins' ear&#146; and for an array of alleged court evils, such as corruption, vice, and standing armies. He continued these broadsides for <span class="italic">The Champion</span> until 1744. In 1743 Ralph edited <span class="italic">The Critical History of the Administration of Sir Robert Walpole</span>, a compilation of anti-ministerial tracts from newspapers and pamphlets. He wrote essays for <span class="italic">Common Sense</span> in 1739 and from 1743 to 1745 he and William Guthrie wrote <span class="italic">Old England, or, The Constitutional Journal</span>, co-sponsored by the earl of Chesterfield and George Bubb Dodington. Dodington became Ralph's patron for most of the next decade. From about 1743 Ralph was his personal secretary and stayed with him occasionally at his villa in Eastbury, Dorset. When Dodington joined the Broadbottom administration in 1744, Ralph was pensioned by the Treasury at &pound;200 per year. Dodington, however, soon looked to rejoin the prince's opposition circle and in 1747 launched a new anti-court journal, <span class="italic">The Remembrancer</span>, with Ralph as editor. Ralph was the intermediary between Dodington and the prince of Wales in the negotiations that concluded with Dodington rejoining the opposition. Ralph conducted <span class="italic">The Remembrancer</span> until the death of Prince Frederick in 1751.<br>
<br>It was under Dodington's patronage that Ralph wrote his most important work, <span class="italic">The history of England during the reigns of King William, Queen Anne, and King George I, with an introductory review of the reigns of the royal brothers Charles and James</span> (1744&#150;6). It was intended as a continuation of William Guthrie's <span class="italic">History of England</span>. Ralph's history, published serially in two volumes, contained long transcriptions of documents and ran to over 2000 folio pages in length. It was misleadingly titled because Ralph never, in fact, progressed beyond William's reign.<br>
<br>Ralph's history sold poorly and won its author few plaudits, but is a work of considerable merit and marked an advance in scholarship over the more popular English history of Paul de Rapin-Thoyras. Ralph examined far more documents than Rapin and used them meticulously. He was the first historian to examine the origins of the revolution of 1688 in detail and to explore its European background. In an age when historical writing was twisted by partisan politics, Ralph wrote from a &#145;country&#146; viewpoint which allowed him to see through the special pleading of whig and tory historians, whose biases and errors he noted throughout. And Ralph wrote more about economics, in particular the financial revolution of the 1690s, than any previous historian of the period.<br>
<br>Another impressive work from this period was <span class="italic">The Other Side of the Question</span> (1742), Ralph's vivid critique of Sarah Churchill's <span class="italic">Account of the Conduct of the Dowager Duchess of Marlborough</span>. The book illustrates Ralph's country whig views. He presents Sarah and, to a lesser extent, her husband as archetypal courtiers, power-hungry self-seekers. Tory stalwarts like Henry Sacheverell fare no better in Ralph's account. In <span class="italic">Of the Use and Abuse of Parliaments</span> (2 vols., 1744) Ralph surveyed the history of parliament from the seventeenth century onwards, showing how &#145;through the craft and perfidy of kings, the degeneracy of mankind, and the extinction of that noble spirit which accompanies liberty&#146;, parliaments invariably become corrupt and tyrannical  (Okie, 159).<br>
<br>After Prince Frederick's death in 1751 Ralph joined another opposition faction led by William Beckford and the duke of Bedford, and produced yet another propaganda journal, <span class="italic">The Protestor</span>. Ralph's new organ assailed the <span class="roman">Jewish Naturalization Bill</span> of 1753 and played a key role in having it repealed. Ralph was pensioned into silence by the Pelham ministry in 1753 at &pound;300 per year. He stopped political pamphleteering but wrote occasional literary reviews for the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>. In 1758 he published anonymously his most popular and influential work, <span class="italic">The Case of the Authors by Profession or Trade Stated</span>. Drawing upon his own experiences as a Grub Street author, he argued that aristocratic patronage of literature had given way in the eighteenth century to a system in which writers were exploited by mercenary booksellers. Ralph's view of publishing in Augustan England became the conventional wisdom in the nineteenth century. His thesis was restated in books and essays by Oliver Goldsmith, Isaac Disraeli, and by Lord Macaulay.<br>
<br>In the late 1750s Ralph wisely ingratiated himself with the earl of Bute, from whom he received a pension when George III succeeded in 1760. Afflicted with gout, Ralph was about to edit yet another newspaper, this time one which was pro-Bute, when he died in Chiswick on 24 January 1762.<br>
