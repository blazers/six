<span class="headword">Wightwick,  George</span>  (1802&#150;1872), <span class="occ">architect and writer on architecture</span>, was born on 26 August 1802 at Alyn Bank, near Mold in Flintshire, the only child of William Wightwick (1775&#150;1811), a country gentleman, and his wife, Anna Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Taylor (1779&#150;1864). William Wightwick was accidentally drowned in 1811, and in 1815 George's mother married Walter Damant, a widower with three children. Following the death of his father, George had been sent to board at Wolverhampton grammar school, but after his mother's remarriage the family moved to London, where he attended Dr Lord's school at Tooting until 1817. He trained as an architect, and in 1818 was articled to Edward Lapidge of Grosvenor Square. After completing his pupillage in 1823 he had difficulty obtaining permanent employment, but gained some work through writing and making drawings for <span class="italic">The Public Buildings of London</span>, by Britton and Pugin. In 1825, following the settlement of his deceased father's affairs, Wightwick made use of the little money available to him for a year's travel in Italy, and in 1828 he privately published <span class="italic">Select Views of Roman Antiquities</span>, well received but not commercially successful. In 1827 he took employment with Sir John Soane as companion and amanuensis. It was an acrimonious relationship that lasted only eight months, but which none the less resulted in a friendship that was important for Wightwick. Later that year he moved from London to join his family in the west country.<br>
<br>Wightwick established himself in Plymouth, and was then invited to join the practice of John Foulston, the architect who had designed Plymouth's public buildings. The date and terms of this partnership are not known, but Foulston retired some six months later, leaving Wightwick to complete outstanding commissions, particularly work for the earl of Mount Edgcumbe at Stonehouse, as well as continuing with others, notably Bodmin Lunatic Asylum. On 26 August 1829 Wightwick married his stepsister Caroline Damant (1808&#150;1867); that year he became increasingly busy, designing private houses, terraces, public buildings, shops, and churches in the Plymouth area and Cornwall. Many of his commissions emanated from the social network that he energetically cultivated and which was based upon his membership of the Plymouth Athenaeum. In Plymouth he designed the mechanics' institute (<i>c</i>.1827), Athenaeum Terrace (1832), the Esplanade (1836), and the post office at Devonport (1850; dem. 1945). In Devon he designed Calverleigh Court at Tiverton (1844) and Watermouth Castle, near Ilfracombe (1845). His work took him into Cornwall, and his country houses are noteworthy: Luxtowe in Liskeard (1831), Trevarno, near Helston (1839), Penquite at Golant (1848), and particularly the alterations to Tregrehan House at St Blazey (1848).<br>
<br>Although Wightwick's buildings may seem random in variety, eclectic in style, and uncontroversial in execution, they were generally well regarded, but it was the design of his churches that provoked criticism. He designed nine churches, of which eight were built between 1834 and 1844, all to the same formula, a boxlike auditorium with only a shallow chancel and without aisles or pillars. It was Wightwick's belief that Gothic form should be modified to accommodate contemporary, popular requirements, a view he expressed in a series of articles for <span class="italic">Weale's Quarterly Papers on Architecture</span> (1844&#150;5), and which led to his downfall in the eyes of the ecclesiological establishment. Although his religiosity was later questioned, it was the depth of his convictions that defined his church design. He offended the increasingly ritualistic opinion of the high-church party, expressed in the pages of <span class="italic">The Ecclesiologist</span>, but Wightwick refused to compromise, and thus censured, his church commissions fell away.<br>
<br>In 1852 Wightwick retired with his ailing wife to Bristol, and three years later moved to Portishead. Caroline Wightwick died on 19 June 1867, and six months later, on 2 January 1868, Wightwick married Isabella (<i>b</i>. 1832), the daughter of Samuel Jackson, the watercolour painter of Clifton. Both his marriages were childless. Wightwick died at his home, 2 Adelaide Terrace, Portishead, on 9 July 1872, and was buried in the graveyard of the local Anglican church, St Peter's, alongside his first wife. His second wife survived him. He left almost all his drawings, watercolours, and papers, including his manuscript lectures, to the RIBA, his architectural work largely contained within six carefully catalogued volumes.<br>
<br>Throughout his professional life as well as in retirement Wightwick wrote extensively, and may be considered one of the first architectural journalists. Early in his career he wrote for two short-lived west country periodicals, <span class="italic">The Philo-Danmonian</span> (January&#150;June 1830), and the <span class="italic">South Devon Monthly Museum</span> (January 1833 &#150; June 1836). Later his <span class="italic">Hints to Young Architects</span> (1846) was reprinted four times, and his terms of employment were printed in <span class="italic">The Architect</span> (2, 1850). He contributed critical comment on Ruskin's <span class="italic">Seven Lamps of Architecture</span> in six articles in the <span class="italic">Architect and Building Operative</span> (November 1849 &#150; January 1850). In retirement he contributed a series of articles on architecture to <span class="italic">The Critic</span> between January 1852 and May 1858, and another series to the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Building Chronicle</span> between May 1854 and May 1857. He wrote prolifically for other national journals, including <span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span>, which published his autobiography &#145;The life of an architect&#146; in parts between 1852 and 1854, and in 1852 contributed a monthly series on local architectural matters to the <span class="italic">Bristol Times</span> under the pseudonym Robert Ramble. He was awarded the RIBA silver medal for his essay &#145;A critical study on the architecture and genius of Sir Christopher Wren&#146; in 1859. Wightwick may now be remembered as an architect, but he was also a romantic pragmatist who sought to entertain as well as to educate through writing and lecturing. In 1840 <span class="italic">The Palace of Architecture: a Romance of Art and History</span> was published, his work of fantasy that embraced all architectural styles, a volume that represented this gregarious man as truly as his functional but ideologically incorrect churches.<br>
