<span class="headword">Kennedy,  David</span>, tenth earl of Cassillis  (1727&#150;1792), <span class="occ">patron of architecture and landowner</span>, was born on 25 June 1727, the eighteenth child and third surviving son of Sir John Kennedy of Culzean, second baronet (<i>d</i>. 1742), and Jean Douglas (<i>d</i>. 1767), daughter of Andrew Douglas of Mains, Dunbartonshire. He was educated at the University of Glasgow from 1742 to 1744, and qualified as an advocate in 1752, &#145;with very great applause&#146;  (Archibald Kennedy to Sir Thomas Kennedy, 17 Jan 1751, NA Scot., GD 25/9/40). He practised in Edinburgh where he was several times a public examinator for the Faculty of Advocates. In 1754 he was one of two candidates nominated by the faculty for the post of joint professor of universal history and Greek and Roman antiquities in the University of Edinburgh, but he was not appointed. He only returned to Ayrshire in 1762 when his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/92715/', "Thomas Kennedy, ninth earl of Cassillis")</script>, purchased Newark Castle, near Ayr, and its surrounding estate for him.<br>
<br>In 1767 Kennedy announced that he was to stand for parliament as member for Ayrshire. His family's interest joined with that of John Campbell, fourth earl of Loudoun, another prominent Ayrshire landowner, and with several other influential figures, and he was successfully elected in 1768. Loudoun supported the government and Kennedy followed his lead, though he seems never to have spoken in the Commons. He had agreed with Loudoun not to contest Ayrshire again, and during his time in the Commons sought a judicial appointment. In 1770 it was thought that he might become a lord of session. In 1771 he hoped to be appointed a baron of the Scottish exchequer. Neither appointment took place. While in London he socialized with James Boswell, who thought him &#145;a good, honest, merry fellow indeed, but one so totally incapable of the business of legislation, and so devoid of the talents which distinguish a man in public life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Boswell for the defence</span>, 168) and mocked his relationship with his brother, suggesting he was entirely dependent on him. In 1774 he was again a candidate for Ayrshire, backed this time not only by Cassillis and Loudoun but by the earl of Eglinton. This alliance of the three earls was resented by the lesser landowners, and Kennedy was defeated. He succeeded his brother as earl of Cassillis in 1775, and was elected a representative peer the following year, again as an ally of Loudoun and the ministry of Lord North and also with the support of John Stuart, Lord Mountstuart, eldest son of the earl of Bute. As a representative peer he continued to support North after he had fallen from office, and from 1784 acted consistently with the opposition to William Pitt the younger's government as an ally of the duke of Portland, who was also an Ayrshire landowner. He ceased to be a representative peer in 1790.<br>
<br>No sooner had Cassillis inherited Culzean Castle, the family seat on the Ayrshire coast, than he invited Robert Adam to advise him how to refashion it. Adam's first operations, between 1776 and 1782, were to build new kitchens, to refashion the L-shaped castle into a square, to crenellate the existing garden terraces and entrance gate, and to lay out a new walled garden some distance from the castle. These enormous undertakings were described by a visitor in 1787 as doing &#145;great credit to Adam, the architect&#146;  (Moss, 70). Cassillis accelerated his brother's estate improvements, enclosing the upland farms and marginal parts of the estate. In 1787 he commissioned Adam to build a new model home farm some distance from the castle with offices for his overseer, which had previously been in the castle. This was accompanied by extensive landscaping in the policies to improve the prospect from the castle. When the home farm was completed, Adam persuaded Cassillis to embark on an ambitious scheme to replace the wing built fifteen years earlier by his brother the ninth earl with an august drum tower overlooking the sea and an imposing circular staircase. This addition was to make Culzean one of Adam's finest compositions. At the same time, probably at Adam's suggestion, Cassillis commissioned the landscape gardener Thomas White of Retford to lay out the grounds.<br>
<br>All this building work was very costly; Cassillis had inherited an already indebted estate, and by 1790 he had debts of over &pound;65,000. He fell ill in February of that year, and with his creditors pressing he had no alternative but to put a stop to any further building. The estate was effectively in the hands of receivers. Unmarried like his brother and with no direct male heir, Cassillis had sought out his third cousin once removed, Captain Archibald Kennedy, a distinguished naval officer, who had been born in New York. Captain Kennedy had made a substantial fortune in prize money during the Seven Years' War, and settled in London in 1780. As far as could be discovered, he was the nearest male heir to the earldom. In 1790 Cassillis entailed his estates to the captain and his son, an army officer, in the expectation that their wealth would not only allow the castle to be completed, but preserve it in the family. The estates were to be managed by trustees in the interest of paying off the debts. Cassillis died at Culzean on 18 December 1792, some months after Robert Adam, and was buried in the collegiate church of Maybole, Ayrshire, on 31 December.<br>
<br>It is hard to explain why Cassillis chose to rebuild Culzean on such an ostentatious scale: perhaps he wanted a more fitting building to house the ninth earl's collections, or perhaps he was simply a follower of fashion. Colonel William Fullarton of Fullwood, another Ayrshire landowner, commented wistfully in 1794, &#145;the greatest number of old families have, within the present century, been obliged to sell their property, embarrassed by the reigning spirit of conviviality and splendour, disproportionate to their income&#146;  (Fullarton, 91). As it turned out, Cassillis's decision to bequeath Culzean to his wealthy distant cousins was provident. The castle was completed over the following three decades. It was given to the National Trust for Scotland in 1945, and at the start of the twenty-first century was the trust's most visited property.<br>
