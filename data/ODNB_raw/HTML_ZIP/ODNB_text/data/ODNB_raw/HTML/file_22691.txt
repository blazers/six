<span class="headword">Poyntz,  John</span>  (1629/30&#150;1712), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, travelled &#145;in the greatest part of the Caribee Islands and most parts of the Continent of America, and almost all his majesty's foreign plantations&#146;  (Poyntz, <span class="italic">Prospect</span>, sig. A2<i>v</i>) and was especially involved in proposals to settle the island of Tobago. Several men named John Poyntz were active in the Caribbean in the later seventeenth century, but this John Poyntz was probably the third son of Sydenham Poyntz's youngest brother, Newdigate (<i>bap</i>. 1608, <i>d</i>. 1643), a royalist killed at Gainsborough, and his first wife, Sarah, daughter of Francis Foxley, of Harringworth, Northamptonshire (<i>d</i>. 1636). If so, he was baptized at nearby Benefield on 3 January 1630 and married Alice (<i>d</i>. 1712), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brown, of Dartford, Kent, probably died at Dartford, and was buried there on 12 August 1712. His wife has been buried three weeks earlier. Maclean, in his exhaustive history of the various branches of the Poyntz family (1886), makes no mention of any connection with Tobago, but the relevant calendars of colonial state papers were published only later (1898&#150;1912).<br>
<br>In 1666 four English ships commanded by a Captain John Poyntz captured a Dutch settlement on Tobago. They left behind a small garrison, which was forced to surrender to a French party from Grenada, who then abandoned the island. In a much later memorial to the council of trade and plantations (17 November 1699) Poyntz claimed that he had made eleven voyages to Tobago (many from Barbados) up to 1680, on one of which (1678&#150;9) the local &#145;emperor&#146; (of Trinidad) had named his only son after him. On 20 September 1681 Poyntz, on behalf of a group of London merchants, signed a treaty with the agent in England of the duke of Courland, to whom Charles II had granted Tobago, for 120,000 acres on the island, on which liberty of conscience would be given to all save Catholics.<br>
<br>In 1683 Poyntz published <span class="italic">The Present Prospect of the Famous and Fertile Island of Tobago</span> (2nd edn, 1695), a very well informed survey of the climate, flora, fauna, and timber of the island, which included a recommendation for barracuda, with a helpful warning to beware of its teeth, and prospects for growing cocoa, sugar-cane, and tobacco. On 26 February he petitioned the king about the colours and standards he should use there. Poyntz later alleged that his grant had aroused the hostility of the duke of York, so that an order of the commissioners of the admiralty (15 December) stopped his ship, the <i>Fountain</i>, from sailing to Tobago from Gravesend; but it might have been held up pending negotiations for the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1684). Several hundred settlers from Barbados had already moved to Tobago before the king blocked Poyntz's project; they were returned to Barbados. On 2 February 1686 Poyntz granted 1000 acres on Tobago to the antiquary John Aubrey as a reward for services he had done for Poyntz with the earls of Pembroke and Abingdon; among Aubrey's papers is a note that under William III Abingdon was to buy Poyntz's claim to Tobago.<br>
<br>The crown questioned the duke of Courland's claim to Tobago, given the many changes of possession and occupation it had seen. In answer to a further petition from Poyntz, the privy council declared (1686) that the king's grant of Tobago to the duke of Courland was void; a memorial from the Courland envoy in London (12 April 1687) also rejected the contract made with Poyntz. In his 1699 petition (2 May), which attempted to revive the scheme, Poyntz said he had considerably developed the planting and settling of Tobago, despite heavy losses during the recent war with France. Among the benefits he claimed would arise from his activities would be added security to the neighbouring English plantations in wartime, an increase in crown revenue and in the endowment of the recently constructed naval hospital at Greenwich. His settlement would also employ the poor and provide refuge for dispossessed French Huguenots.<br>
<br>Poyntz aimed to gain possession of the whole island and grant it to a charitable foundation for converting the Indians to Christianity and, in England, suppressing vice and debauchery, augmenting the salaries of indigent clergy and endowing a hospital in London for the blind poor. But the privy council declared that a free-port in Tobago would be prejudicial to the English colonies, especially Barbados, a line taken by the council of trade and plantations as early as 1686. In 1702 Poyntz made his final petition, but his claim to Tobago was conclusively rejected. In 1692&#150;3 a Captain John Poyntz filed three patents: no. 320 of 1693 for the invention of engines to remove bars, sandbanks, mud, and other obstructions that stop up ports and harbours; no. 297 of 1692 for taking up ships sunk at sea; and no. 327 of 1693 for raising water to perform mill-work.<br>
<br>Another <a name="cosubject_75180"></a><span class="headword">John Poyntz</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1639&#150;1665), also a <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was recommended by Admiral Robert Blake, in the reorganization of the fleet early in 1653, for naval employment as a clerk of the cheque, on the basis of his fourteen years' service at sea&#151;presumably all or mostly in the merchant service. Having been clerk of the cheque in the <i>Happy Entrance</i> (April 1653) and lieutenant of the <i>Dover</i> on William Penn's expedition to the West Indies (1654), he was lieutenant of the <i>Portland</i> in the West Indies (April 1655) and became captain of the fly-boat <i>Mary</i> (or <i>Mayfly</i>). He wrote to the council of state (15 November 1656) about settling planters from Nevis, St Kitts, and New England on Jamaica, and, on his return from the West Indies in March 1657, Poyntz certified (5 March) that, in the <i>Mayfly</i>, he had settled 1500 planters, including the governor of Nevis, around Port Morant, Jamaica. This activity suggests he may have been a kinsman of Sydenham Poyntz, who was governor of the Leeward Islands (1650&#150;51) and, though he effectively disappears from history at that date, was possibly a resident of Antigua in the 1650s and was mentioned as governor of Antigua as late as 1661&#150;3. While captain of the <i>Providence</i> (April 1657), serving off Dunkirk and in the channel, he twice (15 February and 22 June 1658) wrote to the commissioners of the admiralty. From December 1658 to 1660 he was captain of the <i>Wakefield</i>.<br>
<br>After the Restoration William Coventry damned Poyntz as &#145;an enemy and plunderer&#146;  (Coventry MS 98, fol. 69) and he was dropped from the service. In the Second Anglo-Dutch War Poyntz was hired by the navy as captain of the merchant ship <i>Maryland</i> and wrote to Pepys (14 November 1664) asking for &pound;18 expenses he had incurred in pressing 140 men into the <i>Maryland</i>. But Coventry described him as &#145;naught&#146;  (Coventry MS 99, fol. 92) and another captain was commanding the <i>Maryland</i> in 1665. He may have been the John Poyntz who wrote to Pepys from Dartmouth (8 February 1668), in a very assured style, undertaking to build a lighthouse and a castle on the Goodwin Sands, at his own expense, in return for ownership of the island and a levy on each ship to help maintain the light. There is a draft of a letter on this to the navy commissioners, in Pepys' shorthand, but no more seems to have been heard of the proposal.<br>
