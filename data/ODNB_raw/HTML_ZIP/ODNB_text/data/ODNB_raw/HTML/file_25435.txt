<span class="headword">Sherley <span class="st"> [Shirley]</span>, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1542&#150;1612), <span class="occ">politician and courtier</span>, was the eldest of three children born to William Sherley (<i>c</i>.1498&#150;1551), a gentleman of Wiston, Sussex, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Thomas Isley of Sundridge, Kent. Nothing is known of his education; he did not, as sometimes claimed, matriculate as a fellow commoner from Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1561. Sherley married, about 1559, Anne (<i>c</i>.1542&#150;1623), daughter of Sir Thomas Kempe of Wye, Kent. They had twelve children, including three adventurous sons: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25436/', "Sir Thomas Sherley (1564&#150;1633/4)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25423/', "Sir Anthony Sherley (1565&#150;1636?)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25433/', "Robert Shirley (c.1581&#150;1628)")</script>. Herbert referred to the Sherleys as &#145;A family not needing hyperboles&#146;  (Shirley, 234). Three other children died in infancy but six daughters survived, Jane (<i>b</i>. 1571) becoming the grandmother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20966/', "Sir Thomas Overbury")</script>.<br>
<br>Sherley was elected MP for Sussex in 1572, 1584, and 1593; he sat for Steyning, his pocket borough, in 1601 and 1604. He was appointed deputy lieutenant of the county in 1569, and was only removed from the list in 1601. He had a town house in Blackfriars and was patronized by Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester. The Sherleys have had the reputation of being a recusant family, but there is no proof that Sir Thomas had Roman Catholic tendencies. He was related by marriage to several leading local families, some of whom were recusants who leased small parts of his lands. A distant kinsman and namesake, Sir Thomas Shirley of St Botolph's Bridge, Huntingdonshire, attributed the misfortunes which befell Sherley to his having deserted &#145;the ancient religion&#146;, but there is no proof for this assertion. Sherley was a commissioner for recusancy in 1580 and a commissioner for disarming recusants in 1585. After the Throckmorton conspiracy, Anne, wife of Philip Howard, earl of Arundel, gave birth to her daughter at Wiston in April 1584, where she was kept in custody by Sherley for a year.<br>
<br>Knighted by Queen Elizabeth at Rye on 12 August 1573, Sherley's raised social status dictated the need for a larger country residence. The new house at Wiston was built between 1573 and 1575, probably on or near the site of the old part-stone manor house mentioned in 1357. From November 1577 Sherley served as sheriff of Sussex and Surrey for a year. He was also a justice of the peace for many years, together with his near neighbour Sir Thomas Bishop of Parham, referred to in 1587 as &#145;good justyces&#151;young men&#146;. Sherley's leased farms supplied him with an annual income of about &pound;1000. He also had connections with the Sussex iron industry, and a furnace erected in 1580 was supplied with wood granted to him under a patent of 1578. In 1588 he was one of fifteen Sussex gentry to pay the highest rate to the Armada fund of &pound;100, though in the same year the sheriff seized many of his goods at Wiston (including 71 feather beds and 32 Turkish carpets) for unpaid debts. He had by now begun on the downward spiral that led to his bankruptcy and disgrace in 1597.<br>
<br>Sherley accompanied the earl of Leicester to the Low Countries in 1585 to aid the rebellion against Spain. He acted as Leicester's go-between with Queen Elizabeth early in 1586 when she was angered that her favourite had accepted the governorship of the United Provinces without consulting her. Made joint treasurer-at-war with William Huddleston in the summer of 1586, Sherley was appointed sole treasurer by Queen Elizabeth on 27 February 1587. He had taken his two eldest sons, Thomas and Anthony, with him, and the three of them each retained a company, which enabled Sherley to engage in much false accounting. He used numerous methods to acquire for himself the money sent out by Lord Burghley to pay debts and equip the troops. Burghley noted in June 1587 that &pound;30,000 had been given to Sherley to pay the debts of the expedition, restore the cavalry to good order, and pay all lendings (half pay for the soldiery) until September. At the end of June Sherley had only &pound;3000 left instead of an expected &pound;18,000. He had spent &pound;8000 before he left England. The enormous sum of &pound;1.5 million is said to have passed through his hands during the ten years he was treasurer-at-war, of which large amounts disappeared into his own pockets. One of his captains revealed that Sherley loaned out much of the cash at interest. Sherley also bought up soldiers' claims to back pay and paid himself the full amount due. Peregrine Bertie, Lord Willoughby, commander of the English forces after Leicester's departure for England in December 1587, believed Sherley was making &pound;20,000 per annum.<br>
<br>Suspicious of his treasurer, Burghley constantly checked on Sherley, and finally the queen reduced his salary. By March 1597 he was bankrupt: &#145;the Queen is greatly incensed and disquieted with Sir Thomas Sherley's doings &hellip; he owes the Queen more than he is worth&#146;, wrote a contemporary  (Davies, 44). In April he was sent to the Fleet prison and probably released in January 1598. He was finally charged with owing the queen &pound;35,175, a mere fraction of what had been embezzled. Of this sum &pound;12,702 was excused and &pound;10,000 recovered by seizing Sherley's goods and putting extents on his lands. He had also obtained questionable patents on the lands of Norwich Cathedral between 1583 and 1586, paying &pound;300 for lands worth &pound;2000 p.a. The dean of Norwich endeavoured to reach an agreement with him, describing Sherley in 1588 as &#145;promising much but of a contrary mind to perform nothing &hellip; he will so plainly deny the receipt of my letters&#146;  (Shirley, 254&#150;5). Sherley also acquired a patent to sell black people from England to Spain and Portugal which did not prosper.<br>
<br>On 20 August 1602 the Wiston estate was sequestrated by the crown. The queen finally lost patience when Sherley reneged on the arrangements to repay his debts. He was able to retrieve his lands in July 1604, when three relatives stood surety for him. Shortly before this, on 15 March 1604, he was again in trouble; elected MP for Steyning, he was riding through London with King James prior to the opening of parliament a few days later when he was arrested for debt by a City goldsmith and taken to the Fleet. This raised the whole question of the privilege of freedom from arrest for MPs, and after several weeks of parliamentary activity, a special bill was passed in haste through both Houses. Sherley was released and triumphantly took his seat. The final form of this law was fixed in 1604 and is known as Shirley's case.<br>
<br>In 1610 Sherley was involved in a scheme for creating a new class of knights, which came to nothing. He is also reputed, together with Sir Robert Cotton, to have created the new honour of baronet, sold by the crown for &pound;1096 in 1611. He obtained no financial advantage from this, not surprisingly in view of his unpaid debts. In 1615, three years after his death, his eldest son Sir Thomas wrote to the king:<blockquote>My Father (being a man of most excellent and working wit), did find out the device for the making of Baronets, which brought to your Majesty's coffers well nigh a hundred thousand pounds for which he was promised &hellip; good recompence which he never had. (Davies, 240)</blockquote>Shortly before his father's demise in October 1612, Sherley the younger tried to commit suicide while in a debtors' prison. Six months later the Sherley inheritance&#151;a burden of debt&#151;fell on him like a ton weight. However, his father had done him a posthumous good turn in that he was able to claim immunity from prison by serving as an MP.<br>
<br>Sir Thomas Sherley died in October 1612, aged about seventy. The black marble obituary tablet from what must have been a grand memorial lies broken in the granary above the Wiston House stables. In 1851 it was said to be on the eastern wall of the family burial place, St Mary's Chapel in St Michael's Church at Wiston (now known as St Mary's Church), surmounted by his effigy and that of his wife, with the arms of his six daughters below. The monument itself may have been damaged during the civil war, and again during church restoration in 1862. The kneeling figures of Sherley and his wife, Anne, their noses and hands chopped off, have been placed on a window sill in the southern aisle of the church. Faint traces of colour remain on the stone. The damaged coat of arms from the monument is in the possession of the Wiston estate office.<br>
<br>It has been incorrectly assumed that the Wiston estate was sold by Sherley's eldest son to Sir John Fagge. James I gave the estate to his favourite the earl of Somerset in 1615. In 1622 it was purchased by Lionel Cranfield. He paid off the creditors of the earl of Somerset with &pound;7000, gave &pound;5400 (by instalments) to Sir Thomas Sherley the younger, paid &pound;400 to Sherley the elder's daughter Cecily, and provided an annuity of &pound;400 for Dame Anne, who spent the last year of her life partly at Parham House with her neighbour Lady Bishop, and partly in London. Wiston House has been leased to the Foreign Office as a conference centre, known as Wilton Park, since 1951.<br>
