<span class="headword">Vaughan, Sir  Henry</span>  (1587?&#150;1660/61), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was the sixth son of Walter Vaughan (<i>d</i>. 1598) of Golden Grove, Carmarthenshire, and Mary Rice (<i>d</i>. before 1588), daughter of Sir Walter Rice of Newton; he was the brother of the poet and promoter of Newfoundland, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28151/', "William Vaughan")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28133/', "John Vaughan, first earl of Carbery")</script>. He settled at Derwydd, Llandyb&iuml;e, Carmarthenshire, about 1602 or 1603, having married a widow, Sage Rice (<i>fl</i>. 1590&#150;1640), the only child of the heir of that house, Elizabeth, first wife of John Gwyn William. Vaughan was sheriff for Carmarthenshire in 1619&#150;1620, and represented Carmarthen Boroughs in successive parliaments from 1621 to 1629, except for the 1625 parliament, when he was unseated after a double return. He was elected as representative for the county on 26 March 1640 and again on 5 November 1640. During the Long Parliament he was nominated as a commissioner to root out scandalous ministers in a bill that was proceeding through the Commons. However, on 7 April 1642 a long-time opponent of his family, Hugh Grundy, presented a petition to parliament alleging misconduct against him in his care of the church, and sought to have him removed as a commissioner. Vaughan held six parish churches which he had obtained from Sir Henry Percy, son of the earl of Northumberland, at a rent of &pound;750 a year. Grundy claimed that he grossly underpaid the curates and employed &#145;six unworthy and scandalous persons that are no preachers&#146; in these churches. He further alleged that Vaughan entertained papists in his house and employed recusants in his own service  (Parl. Arch., Main MSS, 1644).<br>
<br>At the outbreak of civil war Vaughan closely followed the position of his nephew Richard Vaughan, second earl of Carbery, who had been given command of the royalist forces in south-west Wales. Indeed one commentator, writing shortly after the Restoration, described Vaughan as &#145;principled and actuated&#146; by Carbery  (E. D. Jones, ed., &#145;The gentry of south west Wales in the civil war&#146;, <span class="italic">National Library of Wales Journal</span>, 11, 1959&#150;60, 143). In 1642 he was nominated as a commissioner of array in Carmarthenshire, and made lieutenant-colonel of the foot in Carbery's regiment. On 14 January 1643 he was knighted by Charles I at Oxford and on 26 October the king appointed him sergeant-major-general of the royalist forces in the counties of Carmarthen, Cardigan, and Pembroke. Vaughan moved into these counties and was described as &#145;the instrument of much mischief&#146;, apparently treating his opponents with some brutality  (Phillips, 2.142). He was disabled from sitting in the Commons on 5 February 1644. Vaughan based his headquarters at Haverfordwest but abandoned that town in March 1644, reputedly after a panic induced by a stampede of frightened cattle, which was mistaken for the parliamentarian troops of Rowland Laugharne. He fled to Carmarthen, but that town was also taken by parliament a few weeks later.<br>
<br>Vaughan returned to Oxford and sat in the king's parliament there. He was taken prisoner at the battle of Naseby on 14 June 1645, and on 18 June was brought before the House of Commons and committed to the Tower, where he remained until his removal to the Fleet on 1 October 1647. Vaughan wrote to his wife from prison on 29 July 1648 that he was &#145;like to be in a starving condicion&#146;  (Jones, &#145;Cadets&#146;, 139). On 27 April 1644 a fine of &pound;160 had been set for him by the parliamentarian authorities and on 20 August 1645 he was assessed at &pound;500, by the committee for compounding, his estate being valued at &pound;600 a year. He was in severe financial difficulties, however, and about this time assessed his debts at &pound;3603, including &pound;20 for his &#145;lodging and diet&#146; in the Tower. He informed the authorities that &#145;all the demeans where I live was my wife's, and the best part of my estate was my wife's inheritance&#146;  (Carmarthenshire RO, Cawdor (Vaughan) MS 22/658).<br>
<br>Supporting the view that Vaughan's conduct in the war was particularly vicious is the fact of his exclusion from any pardon under the Newcastle propositions of 1646. He was similarly exempted from the general pardon of 13 October 1648, being described as a &#145;capital offender&#146;. A parliamentarian writer described him as &#145;&#147;Act-all&#148;, now prisoner in the Tower for all [the family?]&#146;, brother to &#145;the honest Richard (Tell-all)&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Earle of Carberyes Pedegree</span>, 1646). His strong affection for the king's cause was also indicated by a royalist song of 1647:<blockquote>
<div>Sir Harry Vaughan looks as grave<br>
</div>
<div>As any beard can make him.<br>
</div>
<div>Those [who] come poore prisoners to see<br>
</div>
<div>Doe for our Patriarke take him.<br>
</div>
<div>Old Harry is a right true blue,<br>
</div>
<div>As valiant as Pendraggon,<br>
</div>
<div>And would be loyall to his king<br>
</div>
<div>Had King Charles ne'er a rag on.<br>
</div> (Jones, &#145;Cadets&#146;, 140)</blockquote>Though it was reported that Vaughan was in prison in London until 1659, he was listed as a potential royal activist in Carmarthenshire during 1658. He made his will on 27 November 1660 but died at Derwydd, Llandyb&iuml;e, before 5 January 1661, when an inventory of his goods was drawn up; his will was proved at Carmarthen on 22 January. His eldest son, John, predeceased him so the estate devolved on his second son, also <a name="cosubject_28129"></a><span class="headword">Sir Henry Vaughan</span>  (<em>c.</em>1613&#150;1676)<span class="occ"></span>. He was a lieutenant-colonel in his father's regiment, and was first noticed in arms when Tenby was captured by Cromwell in 1648 during the second civil war. In his father's letter from prison of July 1648, Henry was described as being a &#145;prisoner in Denby Castle&#146;. A contemporary pamphlet called him &#145;Sergeant-Major&#146; but his memorial inscription gives his rank as &#145;Colonel&#146; (Phillips, 2.378; Harrison, 12, 84). After the Restoration he was knighted at Whitehall, on 9 January 1662. He was appointed as captain of the foot for the borough of Carmarthen in 1662 by the earl of Carbery, and served as mayor for the town in 1670. He was returned as MP for the county of Carmarthen at a by-election in January 1668, but a question arose over his eligibility to sit as he had been outlawed for debt. After consideration it was decided that his election should stand, and he retained the seat until his death (caused by a fall from his horse) on 26 December 1676. It has been suggested that he was &#145;interested in Parliament solely as a refuge from his creditors: he made no recorded speeches and sat on no committees, but he loyally supported the court party&#146;  (Naylor and Jagger, 3.628). He was buried at Llandyb&iuml;e church, where an elaborate monument was erected to his memory by his widow, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1694), eldest daughter and coheir of William Herbert of Coldbrook, Monmouthshire. Many writers have erroneously assumed the existence of only one Sir Henry Vaughan, while some have still further confounded them with their namesake, who hailed from Cilcennin, Cardiganshire.<br>
