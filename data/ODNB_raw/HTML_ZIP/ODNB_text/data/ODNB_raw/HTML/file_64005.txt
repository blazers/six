<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Proops <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Israel]</span>,  (Rebecca) Marjorie</span>  (1911&#150;1996), <span class="occ">advice columnist</span>, was born at 55 Eastbourne Road, Tottenham, Middlesex, on 10 August 1911, elder daughter of Abraham Israel, who later changed his name to Alfred Rayle, and his wife, Martha Flatau. At that time her father was a van traveller in mineral water, but he soon gave that up and bought a series of pubs, moving restlessly from one district to another. Marje, as she was always known (having been mocked as &#145;Bekky the Jew girl&#146; as a child), went to a series of London schools; she left her last, Dalston secondary school, just before she was sixteen and had three terms at Hackney Technical School. Considered &#145;the brainy one&#146; beside her pretty sister Josephine, she also had a powerful contralto voice which won her talent competitions and an offer to join the D'Oyly Carte opera company, which her mother made her turn down. And she could draw: when she left art school her father paid a premium (unknown to her) to get her taken on by a commercial art studio in London's Smithfield meat market, where she was given mainly dogsbody tasks but was taught by her friendly seniors to dress more smartly, thin her eyebrows, and paint red with nail varnish the heavy glasses she always wore.<br>
<br>At seventeen Marje set up as a freelance fashion artist, managing to sell drawings to several papers and magazines. On 21 November 1935 she married Sidney Joseph Proops (1908&#150;1988), a builder, and had a son, Robert, nine months later; but, unusually for those days, she went on working. In 1939 she was appointed resident fashion artist at the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, but when the war came, Sidney (Proopsie) joined the Royal Engineers and was posted to the midlands and then abroad; Marje and her son moved to Stoke Poges in Buckinghamshire to be near her parents in Windsor. She was able to go on selling fashion sketches, particularly of knitwear, as a freelance; and on the strength of her captions to these, the editor of <span class="italic">Good Taste</span> magazine asked her to write an article on the problems of mothers coping on their own in wartime. A pamphlet on venereal disease for female servicewomen and other commissions followed, and at the end of the war she joined the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span> as fashion editor, later graduating to woman's editor. And when the existing advice columnist, writing as May Marshall, left, Proops, unable to find a replacement, started answering the letters herself.<br>
<br>So began her career as an &#145;agony aunt&#146;, which gave her &#145;Dear Marje&#146; column iconic status in journalism and the country, a role she continued when she moved back to the <span class="italic">Woman's Mirror</span> under Hugh Cudlipp in 1954. He had been impressed by the witty, forthright replies of American columnists Abigail van Buren and Ann Landers, and reckoned Marje could emulate them, and more. At first she was alarmed by how little she knew, but her friend the psychiatrist Dr Eustace Chesser let her bring round the letters in his lunch hour and gradually schooled her in their interpretation. She built up over the years not only increasing experience but a vast knowledge of the organizations and agencies where her troubled readers could go for help. She answered, or caused to be answered by her team of trained helpers, every one of the 50,000 letters she received each year; other readers telephoned her, and occasionally she was compelled to take practical action, for example when one girl rang from a call box to say she had taken suicide pills; Marje kept her in conversation for long enough for her staff and the police to locate and rescue her.<br>
<br>Her columns were distinguished from the more conventional and moralistic work of previous advice columnists by their frankness about forbidden areas such as homosexuality, impotence, divorce, and incest; she claimed to be the first person to mention masturbation in a family newspaper. She was compassionate but could be tough with her correspondents: her journalist colleague Felicity Green described her answers as being &#145;brutally frank, sexually aware, liberal to the point of illegality&#146;  (private information). Her writing bridged in its fifty years a change in public attitudes from that in which wives wrote about &#145;submitting&#146; to their husbands to one in which, in her own words, &#145;questions about orgasms are as common as questions about mothers-in-law&#146;. She and those who followed her were even reproached for having accelerated the process, though she saw herself as struggling against hypocrisy and repression and cruelty.<br>
<br>In her own life Marje appeared to be happily married to Sidney Proops, living in London first in Golders Green, then St John's Wood, and finally Barnes, and becoming a model grandmother to her son's two children. Not until 1992 did her authorized biography, <span class="italic">Marje: the Guilt and the Gingerbread</span> by Angela Patmore, reveal that her marriage to Proopsie had been a disaster from the start, her wedded bliss a sham. Her appreciation of sex, however, was not; for many years (from about 1967) her real love was Philip Levy, the <span class="italic">Mirror</span>'s company lawyer, though there were other lovers as well. Though <i>jolie laide</i> rather than pretty, she had an excellent figure, dressed with flair and suitability, and was popular&#151;with women as well as with men. She was not a good judge of people, being inclined to like anyone who liked her (even Robert Maxwell, the <span class="italic">Mirror</span>'s maverick proprietor, who put her briefly on the Mirror board). She enjoyed the grand style, and the procession of editors for whom she worked made a point of courting her and ensuring her the chauffeur-driven luxury she expected and&#151;in terms of her value to the <span class="italic">Mirror</span>&#151;deserved.<br>
<br>She wrote features and interviews as well as &#145;Dear Marje&#146;, and her talents were widely recognized. She was woman journalist of the year 1969, and was appointed OBE in the same year. She served on Sir Morris Finer's committee on one-parent families from 1976 to 1978, and on Lord Rothschild's royal commission on betting, lotteries and gaming 1976&#150;8. She wrote two books, <span class="italic">Pride, Prejudice and Proops</span> (1975) and <span class="italic">Dear Marje</span> (1976). A rose was named after her, and in 1977 she went on display at Madame Tussaud's waxworks.<br>
<br>Both Philip and Sidney died before her in the 1980s and Marje missed them both. In her last years she was increasingly frail, having survived an early hysterectomy and breast cancer, and moving with two false hips; she died of pneumonia at Cromwell Hospital, Kensington, on 10 November 1996, having concealed her age to the last. She was following Hugh Cudlipp's advice given long before: &#145;One day&#146;, he said, &#145;your name will be in the record books and you'll want to go on working. If you let them know your age, you won't be able to.&#146; Marje reckoned that during her working life she had corresponded with 3 per cent of the British population, and had influenced countless more; in a friend's words &#145;she saved more souls than the Salvation Army&#146;. And she embodied the best of the liberal spirit of the second half of her century.<br>
