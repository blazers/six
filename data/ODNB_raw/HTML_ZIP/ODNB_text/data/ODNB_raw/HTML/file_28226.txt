<span class="headword">Vermuyden, Sir  Cornelius</span>  (1590&#150;1677), <span class="occ">drainage engineer</span>, was born at St Maartensdijk, on the island of Tholen, Zealand, in the Dutch republic, the son of Gillis Vermuyden and his wife, Sara, daughter of Cornelius Werckendet. The Vermuydens had lived in St Maartensdijk from the early fourteenth century, and Cornelius was brought up among drainage engineers. His mother came of a notable family in Zierikzee, capital of the neighbouring Isle of Schouwen, and her brother Lieven had been prominent in embanking, impoldering, and constructing the harbour of Zierikzee.<br>
<br>In England a general drainage bill had been discussed in parliament in 1585 to no effect, but from the 1590s Dutchmen competed with Englishmen in plans to drain the largest area of fen in the kingdom&#151;the Great Level, around the Wash. The first scheme was devised by Humphrey Bradley, a Brabanter, in 1593; it was followed in 1606 by that of the so-called &#145;French contractors&#146;, Cornelius Verneuil (possibly French) and Cornelius Liens. Liens came from the same village as Vermuyden and the two families were related by marriage (the mother of Cornelius Liens was Phillipine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Werckendet, great-aunt of Sara; later Cornelius Liens's brother, Joachim, married Cornelius Vermuyden's sister, Cornelia). Joachim Liens went to England in 1618 as a representative of the Dutch government, and he came close enough in court circles to be knighted by James I in 1619. When the king declared himself the undertaker of drainage in the Great Level in February 1621, it is probable that Liens had promised Dutch capital and expertise.<br>
<br>Cornelius Vermuyden arrived in England in 1621, after employment as a tax collector in his home town, and much later (in 1642) he declared that he had come by invitation to drain the Great Level; he did not say who had issued the invitation. Thereafter James I was diverted from the fen project and no progress was made. Liens put another drainage proposal to the king in 1622, this time naming Cornelius Vermuyden as his fellow undertaker, but that plan too was rejected. Still unemployed, Vermuyden was in close contact with Dutchmen in London, and in 1622 he was asked by the Essex sewer commissioners to repair, at a cost of &pound;2000, a breach in the Thames bank at Dagenham and Havering, caused by recent storms. The commissioners complained of unsatisfactory work in February 1623, but Vermuyden claimed that he had spent &pound;3600 and that the commissioners had paid him nothing.<br>
<br>At Rotherhithe on 6 November 1623 Vermuyden married Katherine, daughter of All-Saints Lapps (or Laps), a Dutch merchant in London. The Lapps were intermarried with the Croppenburghs, and Joos Croppenburgh was contracted in 1622 to drain flooded land in Erith, on the Kent bank of the Thames; he subsequently undertook land reclamation on Canvey Island, and in litigation in 1626 Vermuyden was named alongside Joos Croppenburgh in this work.<br>
<br>Events imply enduring royal favour towards Vermuyden: in 1623 he was engaged by James I to drain land in Windsor Park. In Hatfield Chase on the Yorkshire&#150;Lincolnshire border, where the crown was principal landowner, James I ordered a survey in 1622, and when the local gentry pronounced against drainage he invited comment from Vermuyden, who gave a favourable opinion. James's death in 1625 frustrated immediate action, but on 24 May 1626 Charles I signed an agreement for Vermuyden to drain Hatfield Chase, the money being promised, it is thought, by Vermuyden's Dutch associates. Sir Robert Heath, newly appointed attorney-general, was almost certainly an influential ally of Vermuyden. Work was ordered to proceed briskly, but the king undertook first to conclude agreements with the local landowners and commoners, a task that was imperfectly performed.<br>
<br>Vermuyden brought workmen from the Netherlands, straightened river courses with artificial cuts, and towards the end of 1627 claimed the work complete. In July 1628 Vermuyden bought the manors of Hatfield Chase from the crown, and on 6 January 1629 he was knighted. The allotment of lands in payment began in 1628, but this unleashed complaints that land was inundated which had formerly been dry, and the commoners who had been granted their common rights for ever on the adjoining Isle of Axholme, on which Vermuyden's works encroached, put up bitter resistance. Violent clashes with the islanders and expensive litigation continued for years, but from 1630 Vermuyden disposed of his lands there and withdrew. Blame for the enduring problems was not laid entirely at Vermuyden's door; Charles I had failed to anticipate and investigate the legal problems. But other ventures now beckoned, notably the Great Level drainage project which sprang to life in 1630. Vermuyden offered his own plan, and was contracted on 1 September 1629 to drain the area. But the contract did not proceed, perhaps because of local opposition to a foreigner (though Vermuyden had been naturalized in 1624) or perhaps because he could not raise the necessary capital. Instead, Francis, fourth earl of Bedford, was named the undertaker, his interest arising out of his ownership of an estate at Thorney; even so, Vermuyden became formally committed to the project as an &#145;adventurer&#146; and was made the director of the works, effectively being the undertaker.<br>
<br>Completion of the drainage was promised within six years, and was so judged on 12 October 1637, Vermuyden having cut a new straight course for the Great Ouse River, called the Bedford River. The 95,000 acres in payment was about to be allotted to the adventurers when vigorous objections were made from all quarters. At this point Charles I announced himself as undertaker, and the investigating commission then pronounced the drainage incomplete and defective. In response Vermuyden put forward a fresh plan, entitled <span class="italic">A Discourse Touching the Draining of the Great Fennes</span> (1638, published 1642), extending the original objectives. The Bedford scheme had aimed to make &#145;summer ground&#146;&#151;land dry in summer&#151;whereas the new objective was to make dry &#145;winter ground&#146;. The larger plan now extended over land in six counties. Civil war delayed further action until 1649, when an act for the draining of the Great Level was passed&#151;helped, it is thought, by the considerable influence of Oliver Cromwell.<br>
<br>Proceedings from 29 May 1649 until 5 April 1656 can be followed in the volumes of proceedings of the Bedford Level Corporation. The proposal to make Vermuyden director was highly contentious; the adventurers consulted other drainers with different ideas, including a Dutchman, Jan Barents Westerdyke, while Vermuyden refused to submit to their supervision, no doubt fearing that their intervention at some point would cut his work short. They for their part could not permit expenditure beyond a certain limit. Finally Vermuyden reached an agreement with the adventurers on 24 January 1650, accepting the conditions he had rejected in June 1649. The new work proceeded, and the drainage of 170,000 acres north-west of the Bedford River, the North and Middle levels, was declared complete on 24 March 1651, and the whole Level was finished on 17 February 1653. The condition of the North and Middle levels continued to be satisfactory, and, when visiting in 1657, William Dugdale saw rapeseed, wheat, and vegetables growing on the allotments of some adventurers. He was also told that sometimes during the draining 11,000 men had been at work. The condition of the South Level did not satisfy, and it remained imperfectly drained into the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Vermuyden also dabbled in other ventures. In 1630 he bought Malvern Chase, where a scheme to grow madder was briefly introduced, but he had sold the estate by 1637. Also in 1630 he bought Sedgmoor, which required drainage. He acquired an interest in the Wirksworth lead mines, in Derbyshire, in 1631, when Sir Robert Heath took possession and made Vermuyden a partner responsible for drainage. Vermuyden was continually indebted because of it, but his new sough drained deeper than before, and much lead was recovered. The work involved his sons Cornelius and John more than himself, for he put an agent in charge; nevertheless, two-thirds of the Dovegang mine still belonged to Vermuyden at his death. In 1653 he proposed a treaty of perpetual friendship between England and the Netherlands in a document, preserved in the Thurloe papers  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 2.125&#150;6), which was probably submitted to Cromwell. The plan to drain Sedgmoor was put before parliament in 1655, but it was rejected in December 1656 when the tenants and freeholders refused consent. During the civil war Vermuyden's sympathies probably lay with parliament, since Cromwell was his friend, and Colonel Cornelius Vermuyden, who fought at Marston Moor, is believed to have been his eldest son. Altogether he had thirteen children, of whom twelve were born in fourteen years; some married into worthy gentry families. After 1655 Vermuyden was described as a merchant, engaged in &#145;exchange, rechange, and chevissance&#146;, but otherwise he fades from the record until his death. He was buried at St Margaret's, Westminster, London, on 15 October 1677.<br>
<br>Vermuyden's writings convey the picture of an experienced, professional engineer. But contrary opinions on drainage strategies were inevitable, so he had many critics and opponents, and gathered a reputation for arrogance, ruthlessness, and obstinacy. A more balanced assessment results from weighing his sound decisions against mistakes and consequences that were unforeseeable; and although he was a complex figure, his significant role in the draining of the English fens cannot be disputed.<br>
