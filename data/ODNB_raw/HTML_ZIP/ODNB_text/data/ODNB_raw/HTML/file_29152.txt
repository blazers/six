<span class="headword">Wey,  William</span>  (1405/6&#150;1476), <span class="occ">author and pilgrim</span>, originated in the diocese of Salisbury. First recorded in 1430 as a fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, he was ordained acolyte and subdeacon on 7 March 1433 to the title of his fellowship. By 1439 he had proceeded MA, and in the following year was admitted a fellow of Eton College, a position he retained until about 1467. Recorded intermittently as bursar of the college between 1445 and 1465, he also retained links with Exeter, to which he gave two books in 1457. He made a collection of Latin sermons, and gave a copy of it to the Bridgettine abbey of Syon, but is better known for his accounts of his pilgrimages, to Santiago de Compostela in 1456, and to Jerusalem in 1457&#150;8 and again in 1462.<br>
<br>Wey's writings on pilgrimages, which are preserved in Bodl. Oxf., MS Bodley 565, are divided into fifteen sections. Much of the collection is in Latin, but the first three sections are in English. The last of these, &#145;A Prevysyoun&#146; giving advice in lacklustre verse to the would-be pilgrim to the Holy Land, is based upon the <span class="italic">Provisio pro peregrinis</span> which occurs later in the collection, but contains additional material and doubtless reflects Wey's wish to instruct. He states of his account of his 1457&#150;8 pilgrimage that he was asked by devout men to write it, and he took his didactic role seriously. His writings contain details of exchange rates of money, useful phrases in Greek and Hebrew, and much practical advice to travellers proposing to follow him to the Levant&#151;about distances, the need to take food and bedding, dealing with the authorities, and precautions against pickpockets and heat. They are also enlivened by much incidental detail; he describes the burial of one doge and the election of another at Venice in 1462, tells how when the pilgrims entered Jerusalem small boys threw stones at them, and in retailing rumours of the bloody exploits against the Turks of the Wallachian &#145;baro de Flake&#146; was probably the first Englishman to note the existence of the man who would eventually be transmogrified into Dracula.<br>
<br>Wey was not composing a travelogue, however, and his principal motive in writing was devotional. No doubt he expressed his faith in the sermons he records preaching at Jerusalem and Corunna. On the evidence of his writings it was a piety focused primarily upon relics and their associated indulgences. His response to Calvary, for instance, is that<blockquote>
<div>Ther ys more pardon in that hylle<br>
</div>
<div>Than eny Crystyn man can telle.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Itineraries</span>, 10)</blockquote>It was in keeping with this outlook that Wey should himself have collected a number of relics, including stones from the holy sepulchre and the cave of the nativity at Bethlehem, and made exact measurements of some of the principal shrines. His motive for doing so is disclosed by his will. About 1467 he entered the house of the Bonshommes at Edington, Wiltshire, where he died on 30 November 1476, aged seventy, and was presumably buried. He bequeathed his relics to &#145;the chapel made to the lyknes of the sepulkur of oure Lorde at Jerusalem&#146;, a chapel that also contained replicas made in &#145;bordys&#146; of the chapel at Calvary, the church at Bethlehem, and &#145;the Mounte of Olyvete and the vale of Josaphath&#146;  (ibid., xxviii&#150;xxx). He also left a map of the Holy Land. This was once identified with the map preserved as Bodl. Oxf., MS Douce 389, but the latter was clearly neither made by Wey nor owned by him.<br>
<br>Wey's writings seem to have circulated in or shortly after his lifetime&#151;they were used by the author of the tract issued by Wynkyn de Worde in 1498 as <span class="italic">Informacon for Pylgrymes unto the Holy Londe</span>. They were published in an excellent edition by George Williams for the Roxburghe Club in 1857, and have since been a rich source of information about late medieval pilgrims and travellers to Palestine.<br>
