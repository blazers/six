<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jameson,  Margaret Ethel <span class="st"> [Storm]</span></span>  (1891&#150;1986), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 8 January 1891 in Whitby in the North Riding of Yorkshire, the eldest in the family of three daughters and one son of William Storm Jameson, sea captain, and his wife (who was also his stepsister), Hannah Margaret, daughter of George Gallilee, shipbuilder. As a child she accompanied her parents on several voyages, which marked the beginning of a lifelong passion for travel. Yet despite her self-imposed exile from Whitby, the harbour town remained central to her imagination and to many of her novels.<br>
<br>Her parents' marriage was unhappy and Storm Jameson's early life was dominated by her high-tempered, bitter mother whom she both feared and loved, and who encouraged her to receive an academic education. After being taught privately and at Scarborough municipal school for a year, she won one of three county scholarships which enabled her to take a place at Leeds University, where she read English for three years, graduating in 1912 with a first-class degree. A research scholarship allowed her to go to London, first to University College, then to King's College. She was awarded her MA in 1914 for a thesis on modern European drama, which was published in 1920 as <span class="italic">Modern Drama in Europe</span>.<br>
<br>On 15 January 1913 Jameson married Charles Dougan Clarke, schoolmaster, whom she had met in her second year at Leeds; he was the son of Charles Granville Clarke, doctor of medicine, an American Quaker. Their son, Charles William Storm, was born on 20 June 1915. The pair were temperamentally ill-matched and the marriage soon foundered, though they did not divorce until 1925. Meanwhile Jameson had begun the extraordinarily prolific career of &#145;une machine &agrave; faire des livres&#146;, as she once described herself. The author of forty-five novels, numerous pamphlets, essays, and reviews, she freely admitted that she wrote too much, fuelled by her enormous energy and driven by the need to make money. Generous and spendthrift, constantly moving house and travelling in Europe whenever she could afford it, her career was shaped from the outset by her financial circumstances, which remained precarious throughout her life.<br>
<br>After refusing a job on <span class="italic">The Egoist</span>, which went to Rebecca West, Jameson worked successively for an advertising agency, the <span class="italic">New Commonwealth</span>, and Alfred Knopf, the American publisher, but after 1928 most of her income was derived from writing. Her first novel, <span class="italic">The Pot Boils</span> (1919), was widely reviewed and her popularity increased with the publication of the Mary Hervey trilogy, <span class="italic">The Triumph of Time</span> (1927&#150;31), which charted the fortunes of the Whitby shipbuilding community between 1841 and 1923. Jameson was by now happy in her personal life, having in 1926 married the historian and novelist Guy Patterson Chapman (1889&#150;1972), the son of George Walter Chapman, official receiver in bankruptcy. Chapman shared her love of France and tolerated her &#145;mania against domestic life&#146; to the extent of living with her in a hotel for six years when he became professor of modern history at Leeds in 1945.<br>
<br>In 1930 Jameson began consciously to change her writing style in emulation of Stendhal. The result was three novellas about women, including the remarkably imagined meditations of an elderly prostitute in <span class="italic">A Day Off</span> (1933). Shortly afterwards she began a Balzacian quintet, <span class="italic">The Mirror in Darkness</span> (1934), which was based on the autobiographical figure of Mary Hervey Russell. Her own dissatisfaction as well as poor reviews caused her to abandon the series in 1936, though the related <span class="italic">The Journal of Mary Hervey Russell</span> (1945) and <span class="italic">The Black Laurel</span> (1947) are among her best novels, together with those inspired by her knowledge of Europe and love of France: <span class="italic">Cousin Honor&eacute;</span> (1940), <span class="italic">Europe to Let</span> (1940), and <span class="italic">Cloudless May</span> (1943).<br>
<br>During the 1930s Jameson became passionately involved in issues of social justice and anti-fascism. Between 1938 and 1944 she was president of the English section of PEN, for which she worked tirelessly on behalf of exiled European writers, earning herself a place on the &#145;Berlin death list&#146;. After the war, though she continued to write indefatigably, her reputation as a novelist declined and the reprinting of some of her books by Virago Press in the 1980s did little to revive interest in her work. She noted her eclipse without resentment in her autobiography, <span class="italic">Journey from the North</span> (2 vols., 1969&#150;70), which contains a memorably honest self-portrait of the author as well as harrowing accounts of bereavement and war.<br>
<br>Jameson liked to remember that her Nordic ancestors had been peasants of the sea whom she resembled in her restlessness and endurance, as she did in her looks. Her large, long-sighted eyes were grey-blue, set in a round high-cheekboned face. Sensual and physically strong, she experienced a series of romantic and sexual obsessions until the time of her second marriage. She received few public honours, though her honorary DLitt from Leeds University (1943) gave her pleasure, as did her honorary membership of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. She died on 30 September 1986 in Cambridge.<br>
