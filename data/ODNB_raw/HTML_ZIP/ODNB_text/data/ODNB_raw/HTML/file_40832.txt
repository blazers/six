</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Docker,  (Frank) Dudley</span>  (1862&#150;1944), <span class="occ">industrialist and financier</span>, was born at Paxton House, South Street, Smethwick, on 26 August 1862, youngest son of Ralph Docker (1809&#150;1887), a solicitor who was for many years coroner for East Worcestershire and clerk of Smethwick's board of health, and Sarah Maria (1830&#150;1900), daughter of Richard Sankey, horse dealer, and sister of Ralph Docker's deceased first wife. Dudley Docker, as he was known, had four brothers, four sisters, and three half-sisters. He was educated privately and at King Edward VI's Grammar School, Birmingham (where he was bottom of his class), before joining his father's law firm. Legal work proved to be uncongenial, and he often subsequently expressed contempt for lawyers.<br>
<br>In 1881 Docker joined in forming Docker Brothers, dealers in varnish for blacking stoves. After a few years the company began making its own varnish and it prospered in the 1890s. It was through the firm's connections that in 1902 Docker masterminded the merger of five of the largest British rolling-stock companies to form the Metropolitan Amalgamated Carriage and Wagon Company. The name of the business was changed in 1912 to the Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon and Finance Company (MCWF). Docker became chairman of this new combine, which was the second largest employer in the midlands. He was resourceful and effective in all its operations, but his financial dexterity was specially notable. Through MCWF he became interested in electrical engineering trusts, and he led the wartime merger movement by negotiating in 1918 the joint purchase for &pound;1.2 million by MCWF and Vickers of the British Westinghouse Electrical Company, subsequently known as Metropolitan-Vickers.<br>
<br>In 1919 Docker persuaded Vickers to buy MCWF at the inflated price of &pound;12.1 million. He was a director of Vickers in 1919&#150;20, and through warehoused shareholdings and nominee directors exercised a critical influence on its fortunes in the 1920s. His role as intermediary in the transfer of control of Metropolitan-Vickers to the General Electric Company of America in 1928 was regarded as unforgivable by some colleagues.<br>
<br>Docker also had a prodigious range of other business interests. In 1906 he became a director of Birmingham Small Arms (BSA), and as deputy chairman in 1909&#150;12 he masterminded its purchase of Daimler Motors in 1910. Though he had left the board, he made crucial interventions in BSA in the early 1930s and rejoined its board in 1943. As a director of the Midland Bank from 1912 until his death he had a powerful influence on banking policy both inside the bank and nationally; his internal influence was pervasive and from 1923 he dominated the bank's Birmingham advisory committee. He was a director of several railway companies, notably the Metropolitan Railway (1915&#150;34) and the Southern Railway (1922&#150;38). He was one of the promoters of the British Trade Corporation, formed under royal charter in 1917, but he resigned from its board in 1920. The following year he formed the Electric and Railway Finance Corporation which acted as his private financial house until his death. Through it he exerted considerable power in two Belgian-based trusts, Sofina, which had worldwide interests in public utilities and electrical engineering, and the International Sleeping Car Syndicate associated with Davison Dalziel.<br>
<br>From 1906 Docker was keenly interested in midlands constituency politics and had contacts with Unionist, Liberal, and Labour candidates. He also had confidential financial arrangements with the <span class="italic">Midland Advertiser</span> and possibly the <span class="italic">Birmingham Gazette</span>. Believing in the superiority of businessmen over professional politicians and administrators he launched in 1910 the Business League Movement in the midlands working for a &#145;business government&#146; of businessmen. He was a founder of the Midlands Employers Federation in 1913, and in 1914 bought a London evening newspaper, <span class="italic">The Globe</span>, to agitate for a business policy. This brought him into conflict with the government and the paper was briefly suppressed in 1915 under the <span class="roman">Defence of the Realm Act</span>. It also led Docker into association with right-wing publicists such as Leo Maxse, to whose <span class="italic">National Review</span> he contributed.<br>
<br>Docker was founder president in 1916 of the Federation of British Industries, which he intended to act as a &#145;business parliament&#146; supplanting the responsibilities of the Westminster parliament in commercial, fiscal, and labour matters. In 1922&#150;5 he was president of the British Commonwealth Union, which confidentially funded the parliamentary candidatures of business-minded acquaintances. Some of the details of his dealings with politicians would have embarrassed them if published: Philip Cunliffe-Lister and Arthur Steel-Maitland were perhaps his most important contacts.<br>
<br>Docker was a Warwickshire magistrate from 1909 and became a companion of the Bath in 1911 after donating a heavy artillery battery for the use of his factory workers in the Territorial Army. He hated Germans and was a zealot in trying to destroy German prosperity and establish a British business hegemony. He was first chairman of the Birmingham Munitions Output Organization in 1915, and his rolling-stock company was the chief manufacturer of tanks in the First World War. His advice was solicited by government departments, and he served on several government committees, including those chaired by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47784/', "Alexander Henderson, first Baron Faringdon")</script>, on financial facilities for trade (1916) and the reorganization of commercial intelligence (1916&#150;17). The offer of a barony by the Baldwin government in 1929 was withdrawn after protests from the City of London.<br>
<br>Docker married in 1895 Lucy Constance (<i>d</i>. 1947), daughter of John Benbow Hebbert (1809&#150;1887), clerk to the Birmingham justices. Their only child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46884/', "Bernard Docker")</script>, usually referred to his father as &#145;the chief&#146;. Dudley Docker served on the committee of Warwickshire County Cricket Club until 1892, having been the highest scoring batsman at the inaugural match of the Edgbaston ground in 1886 and playing for his county against Australia in 1887. He was a keen shot, and usually spent time in Scotland each year, and a member of the Royal Thames Yacht Squadron.<br>
<br>Docker was tall and well built, with a big nose. As a young man he seemed jovial and frank, although he could be intimidating: his small, intense, unblinking eyes quelled dissidence. He was always mercenary, and had an unbeatable understanding of other mercenary men. He disliked others being in authority over him, and resented politicians or officials whom he could not bribe or browbeat. In business he was always bold, flexible, persuasive, ruthless, and opportunistic; from 1918 onwards he might be judged unscrupulous. At committee meetings Docker was taciturn and even inarticulate, but he was so shrewd and calculating that he was often able to direct deliberations by informal pressure. Increasingly he liked to operate through nominees, and was usually a good delegator. He had a retentive memory, and an acuity in financial affairs that was hard to surpass. The least gullible of men, some of his political enthusiasms were nevertheless unrealistic. Apparently he suffered from nervous strains which made him increasingly pessimistic and aggressive; he may have developed claustrophobia, and about 1916 came to dislike crowded meetings or public attention. Latterly he was secretive.<br>
<br>Docker died of Ludwig's angina and tonsillitis on 8 July 1944, at his home, Coleshill House, near Amersham, Buckinghamshire, and was buried at Coleshill.<br>
