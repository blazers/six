<span class="headword">Williams,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1787&#150;1845), <span class="occ">physician and pharmacologist</span>, was born in London; nothing else is recorded of his family or early life save that at the age of fourteen he survived shipwreck on a voyage to North America in company with his uncles, who were merchants. On 27 June 1804 he was admitted a pensioner at Trinity College, Cambridge; he matriculated in 1806 and graduated MB in 1810.<br>
<br>Williams began his medical career at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. He became MD in 1816, the year in which he moved to the united hospitals of Guy's and St Thomas's as an assistant physician; on 1 October 1817 he was elected full physician in place of the recently retired William Lister. Williams stayed with St Thomas's when the hospitals divided in 1825 and remained there until his death. At the Royal College of Physicians he was admitted as an inceptor candidate on 12 July 1816, a candidate on 23 December 1816, and a fellow on 22 December 1817. He served as censor in 1831, and was declared an elect on 20 March 1840. He served a term as president of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society of London.<br>
<br>Williams was critical of the medical therapy of his day, which employed active items such as digitalis and ipecacuanha in a wide variety of diseases. The majority of medicines were palliatives to relieve or mitigate symptoms and Williams believed it was necessary for medical science to discover specific medicines to treat and cure maladies considered irremediable. The first volume of his <span class="italic">Elements of Medicine: on Morbid Poisons</span> was published in 1836 and it was followed by a second volume in 1841. This work reveals Williams's familiarity with contemporary advances in the experimental studies of drugs and poisons carried out by Fran&ccedil;ois Magendie and others. Williams concluded that he would have to revise his therapeutic regimes if he was to make accurate observations on the action of drugs. In the preface to the <span class="italic">Elements</span> he wrote: &#145;The opportunities which a large hospital affords, have made it a duty to deviate, in some instances, from the usual routine of practice, and reduce treatment to simplest forms.&#146; He found that this approach improved the treatment of fevers. It also led to the introduction of potassium iodide as a curative agent. Following the suggestion of William Wallace (1791&#150;1837) that potassium iodide might be of value in the treatment of venereal diseases, Williams demonstrated its specific beneficial effects in the later stages of syphilis. He also reported that potassium bromide was effective in cases of enlargement of the spleen, and this resulted in the salt's being introduced into the <span class="italic">London Pharmacopoeia</span> of 1836. His observations, however, were not confirmed, and the drug was omitted from the 1850 edition of the pharmacopoeia.<br>
<br>Williams's contribution to pharmacology and therapy is noteworthy for his recognition of the problems of contemporary therapy, and for drawing attention to the importance of making accurate observations of the action of drugs in the course of treatments. Contemporary clinical practice, however, presented considerable difficulties in making such observations, as Williams's experience with potassium bromide clearly demonstrated. For this reason his practical achievements were few, and after his death a close colleague acknowledged that he was less successful in his investigations than his zeal and perseverance deserved.<br>
<br>In his later years Williams acquired a poor reputation and was accused of being lazy and uninterested in his practice. Nevertheless, a year after his death William Frederick Chambers in his presidential address to the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society of London spoke warmly of Williams and his work. Chambers was a contemporary at Cambridge and the source of the story of the shipwreck. He recalled that at university Williams was regarded as a man highly cultivated and accomplished, and much given to literary pursuits. Chambers observed that Williams's intellectual interests, which persisted throughout his life, and his lack of faith in the physic of his day, did not fit him to the dull routine and often repulsive realities of day-to-day hospital medical practice. Chambers also revealed that Williams suffered from a debilitating illness which &#145;blunted the edge of his energies and masked the vigour of his talented mind&#146;. This helps to explain why Williams, a good physician and scholar, was misunderstood in his lifetime and often misrepresented after his death.<br>
<br>Williams made his final contribution to medical literature in an article on the elementary principles of medicine, in the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia metropolitana</span> (1845). He died at his house in Lower Bedford Place, Russell Square, London, on 24 November 1845.<br>
