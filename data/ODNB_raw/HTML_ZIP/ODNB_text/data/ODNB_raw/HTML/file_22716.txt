<span class="headword">Prendergast,  Thomas</span>  (1807/8&#150;1886), <span class="occ">East India Company servant and writer on language learning</span>, was the son of Sir Jeffrey Prendergast (1769&#150;1856) and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Hew Dalrymple of Nunraw, East Lothian; they married in 1804. His father was born at Clonmel, was in the service of the East India Company, and became colonel of the 39th native infantry in 1825. He served in the Anglo-Mysore War, was knighted in 1838, was promoted to be a general in 1854, and died in 1856.<br>
<br>Thomas was nominated a writer in the East India Company's service on 23 June 1826, and became assistant to the collector of Tanjore, Madras presidency, in 1828. He was acting head assistant to the collector of Nellore on 16 January 1829, and head assistant on 9 February 1830. In 1830 he became acting sub-collector and joint magistrate of Nellore, in 1833 acting assistant judge at Guntur, and on 8 August 1834 assistant judge of Tinnevelly (or Tinnevelly), where he remained until 1838. His wife, Lucy Caroline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dalrymple, died in 1839, and their two sons, Hew and Harry, were sent to live with their grandfather Sir Jeffrey. He was afterwards for many years collector and magistrate at Rajahmundry until his retirement on the annuity fund in 1859. On his arrival in England he settled at Cheltenham, and about 1861 became totally blind. Despite this misfortune, he devoted himself to literary work, and invented what he called the mastery system of learning languages. This system is based upon the process pursued by children in learning to speak. They are impelled by instinct to imitate and repeat the chance sentences which they hear spoken around them, and afterwards to interchange and transpose the words so as to form new combinations. By frequently repeating conversational sentences Prendergast had himself acquired the Madras vernacular, Tamil, and Telugu. The system was to some extent a development of the Ollendorffian, but Prendergast elaborated its details on original lines. His success was considerable, and the various manuals in which he practically expounded his views went through numerous editions.<br>
<br>Prendergast's key works are <span class="italic">The Mastery of Languages, or, The Art of Speaking Foreign Tongues Idiomatically</span> (1864; 3rd edn, 1872) and <span class="italic">Handbook to the Mastery Series</span> (1868; 5th edn, 1882). The <span class="roman">Mastery Series</span> itself covered French (1868; 12th edn, 1879); Spanish (1869; 4th edn, 1875); German (1868; 8th edn, 1874); Hebrew (1871; 3rd edn, 1879); and Latin (1872; 5th edn, 1884).<br>
<br>Prendergast died at Meldon Lodge, The Park, Cheltenham, on 14 November 1886, and was buried in the town's new cemetery on 18 November. His son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35606/', "Sir Harry North Dalrymple Prendergast (1834&#150;1913)")</script>, GCB VC, was commander in Burma from 1883 to 1886.<br>
