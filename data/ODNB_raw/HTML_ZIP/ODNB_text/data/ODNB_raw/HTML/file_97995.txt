<span class="headword">Bond,  Lawrence</span>  (1907&#150;1974), <span class="occ">engineer and motor vehicle designer</span>, was born at 5 Penwortham Hill, Penwortham, Preston, Lancashire, on 2 August 1907, the son of Frederick Charles Bond (1873&#150;1963), a clothing maker who became a well-known local historian and artist, and his wife, Margaret Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Morphy (<i>c</i>.1876&#150;1957), from Ballinamallard, Fermanagh, Ireland. He had one sibling, a younger brother, Frederick Bond (1910&#150;1997). The family lived in the Broadgate area of Preston, close to the centre of the town and Lawrie (as he was known) was educated at Preston grammar school and afterwards served an apprenticeship.<br>
<br>In the early 1930s Bond worked in the drawing offices of Henry Meadows Ltd, engine and gearbox manufacturers, in Wolverhampton. He went on to work as a draughtsman with the Blackburn Aircraft Company at Brough, Yorkshire. At Beverley register office he married, on 22 December 1934, Mary Marjorie, daughter of Albert Lambert, house decorator. They had one daughter.<br>
<br>Bond's time at Brough was an important influence on his later design work, which frequently featured weight-saving aircraft construction techniques and materials. By 1944 he had set up his own small engineering workshop just outside Blackpool, Lancashire. Employing some 20&#150;30 workers, the Bond Aircraft and Engineering Company (Blackpool) Ltd manufactured aircraft and vehicle components under Ministry of Supply contract and had its office on Queen Street in the centre of the town. The end of the war saw the closure of his Blackpool premises and he moved to a small workshop with attached living accommodation, known as Towneley Works off Berry Lane, Longridge, Lancashire. His first marriage ended in divorce and he married, second, at Blackpool register office, on 18 January 1947, Pauline Freeman, the divorced wife of George Stanley Percival Freeman; she was the daughter of Jeffrey Mackenzie, regular soldier.<br>
<br>At Longridge, with now only a handful of staff and the work varied and often unreliable, Bond began to turn his own designs into reality, initially concentrating on his passion for motor racing. His first machine, intended to compete in the new post-war 500 cc class, was nicknamed the Doodlebug and made its public debut in 1947 at the Shelsley Walsh hill climb. This was followed by a more sophisticated Type C machine built to conform to the new national 500 cc formula of 1948. He soon became a well-known, if less than successful, figure at such events and his machines, featuring front wheel drive, aluminium semi-monocoque construction and elektron alloy castings, were extremely lightweight and attracted a lot of attention.<br>
<br>Although they established Bond's reputation as a designer, these racing cars were far from a commercial success and he turned his attention to more practical applications of his ideas. His prototype <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> litre shopping car was announced in May 1948. Economic conditions in the UK, including continuing wartime petrol rationing and restrictions on materials for manufacturing, made such a vehicle an attractive commercial proposition. Realizing the sales potential of his ultra-lightweight, three-wheel microcar, with fuel consumption of 100 miles per gallon, but not having the facilities to put it into production, he sold the design to the Preston firm of Sharp's Commercials (renamed Bond Cars Ltd from 1964). Sharp's turned Bond's concept into the successful Bond Minicar which gave post-war Britain a basic, but affordable, means of personal transport. A range of these diminutive vehicles was marketed under the Bond name and developed through consecutive designations Mk A to Mk G from 1949 up to 1966 with a total of approximately 26,500 vehicles being produced.<br>
<br>Bond next turned his attention to the design and manufacture of a series of small lightweight motorcycles and scooters. The first of these, the Bond Minibyke, an unconventional machine, again utilizing mainly aluminium construction, appeared in 1949. After producing some 150 machines at Longridge, he sold the rights to Ellis Ltd of Leeds, which built a further 600. Next came the Lilliput in 1951 under his new company name of BAC (Bond Aircraft and Engineering Company). This was a more conventional looking machine, but was not a commercial success with only some 200 being built. The Gazelle, a scooter-type machine, was introduced in the same year, but the design was soon sold after only a handful had been produced.<br>
<br>In 1953 Bond sold his Longridge workshop and began to concentrate on freelance design work rather than manufacturing, moving south to Wormley in Surrey. He worked on a number of ultimately unsuccessful projects, including his final two-wheel design, the Bond Sherpa Scooter announced in 1955. Despite these setbacks he was busier than ever. In 1956 he moved to Loxwood in Sussex to set up a new workshop, Lawrence Bond Cars Ltd, and later that year two new vehicles which he had designed were launched. The first was the Berkeley Sports, an attractive four-wheel, two-seater open tourer built by Berkeley Coachwork Ltd, using an innovative semi-monocoque shell, this time in glass-fibre. It received excellent press reviews and achieved limited competition success, continuing in production until 1961, with over 4000 being built. The second design was the Opperman Unicar, built by S. E. Opperman Ltd, a very basic four-wheel, four-seat microcar utilizing glass-fibre semi-monocoque construction. Production ceased in 1959, with only some 200 having been sold, most as &#145;build-it-yourself&#146; kits to avoid purchase tax.<br>
<br>These commercial successes enabled Bond to turn his attention once again to designing racing cars, resulting in 1960 in the Bond formula junior. This was a breakaway design featuring a forward mounted engine with front wheel drive and was the first stressed skin monocoque formula junior racing car. In the early 1960s he renewed links with Sharp's Commercials, designing a completely new three-wheeler for them, the Bond 875, a much more conventional vehicle than the previous Minicars and considered a worthy competitor to Reliant, who were dominating the three-wheeler market by this time. He also styled the company's first four-wheel model, the Bond Equipe GT, a pretty glass-fibre bodied specialist sports car based on the Triumph chassis and drive train.<br>
<br>In 1965 Bond moved north again, to Bowes in Yorkshire, intending to combine the roles of freelance designer and publican. He continued working on a number of projects and became interested in boat design, but his health deteriorated and resulted in a return to Lancashire, to live with his daughter, his only child. He died at her home, 56 Woodlands Road, Lytham, Lancashire, on 2 September 1974.<br>
<br>Bond was a talented and prolific designer who was never afraid to try out new ideas, though his obsession with weight saving, often to the point of structural weakness, proved to be the flaw of a number of his designs. This and his apparent lack of business sense, or the patience to develop his designs into commercially viable products, led to several of his ideas falling by the wayside. He was an enigmatic character, always smartly dressed, but often in the background, uncomfortable with personal publicity. His second wife, Pauline, was responsible for much of the press coverage that helped promote his projects. Best remembered for the Bond Minicar, an affordable product for the period of post-war austerity, he was not sentimental about his work and saw his designs simply as solutions to specific problems or circumstances. When, in later life, he was confronted by a group of enthusiastic Bond Minicar owners, he was puzzled that they were still driving such vehicles, when more comfortable and practical alternatives had become available.<br>
