<span class="headword">Southwell,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1608, <em>d.</em> 1677), <span class="occ">administrator and local politician</span>, was baptized on 29 March 1608 in St James, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, the son of Anthony Southwell (<i>bap</i>. 1579, <i>d</i>. 1623), undertaker in the plantation of Munster, and Margaret, daughter of Sir Ralph Shelton of Norfolk. Nothing is known of his early years or education, and at an unknown date he married Helena (1613&#150;1679), daughter of Major Robert Gore of Shereton, Wiltshire. On 22 July 1631 he was appointed collector of customs for the port of Kinsale, where he remained throughout the Irish rising of 1641, during which time it is said that he &#145;took his share in the defence of the town against the Irish&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). On the conclusion of Ormond's treaty with the Kilkenny confederates Southwell helped to provision the fleet of revolted English ships with which Prince Rupert arrived in the port in January 1649. Although it is said that he suffered for his loyalty to the Stuart cause, the commissioners subsequently appointed for the government of Ireland by the Rump Parliament were evidently reliant upon Southwell for cash loans by June 1652. On 26 November 1653 he was appointed one of the commissioners for surveying lands in the baronies of Kinalea and Kerrykuhirry in co. Cork. On 10 March 1656 he was added to a commission set up for transplanting to Connaught those liable who had not yet vacated co. Cork. At Mallow later that year, during the trial of &#145;ancient inhabitants of Cork, Kinsale and Youghal&#146;, Irish Catholics who laid claim to exemption from the transplantation orders on grounds of constant loyalty to the English interest throughout the rebellion, Southwell gave evidence as to the fidelity and good affection of those many Catholics who had remained in English quarters, and whose loyalty only came in question after their technical disqualification by right of Inchiquin's general defection in 1648. Evidently he was motivated, at least in part, by his ownership of estates purchased from such individuals in the period 1641&#150;52, properties which were themselves liable to confiscation. In 1655 Southwell's daughter Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1679) married John Percivall (Perceval), who was knighted by Henry Cromwell in 1658 and elevated to an Irish baronetcy in 1661. Another daughter, Anne, married Ralph Barney of Wyckingham, Norfolk. By 1657 Southwell shared responsibility for provisioning ships of the Commonwealth navy. On 5 October of that year he was elected chief officer, or sovereign, of the corporation of Kinsale.<br>
<br>After the restoration of Charles II, Southwell received pardon by order of the king on 25 April 1661. He resumed his services to the state in the administration of maritime and naval affairs. In October he petitioned for an award of certain forfeited lands belonging to James Mellefont and Philip Barryoge in satisfaction for a debt incurred supplying the king's fleet at a time apparently unspecified. A grant of Barryoge's property in the liberty of Kinsale, including Ringcurran, was confirmed to Southwell by letters patent on 16 June 1666, and he became governor of the fort erected there in defence against the Dutch; during the Second Anglo-Dutch War he incurred considerable personal expense in dealing with enemy seamen taken prisoner. As of 1 April 1662 he was customer for the port of Kinsale within the establishment for civil affairs in Ireland. By August 1665 he was deputy vice-admiral of Munster, and on 20 September 1670 he was appointed vice-admiral of the province, and admitted as a member of the provincial council. In 1671 he was sovereign of Kinsale once more. In 1675 order was given that the town's new charter incorporate a saving in respect of land from the fee farm rent recently granted to Southwell, on which he had built housing and other accommodation to the advantage of the port and harbour there. He died on 3 April 1677 after a long illness (probably dropsy), during which his second but only surviving son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26066/', "Sir Robert Southwell")</script>, diplomat and future secretary of state for Ireland, took comfort from his stoic discourse, remarking that &#145;Socrates and Seneca did by the help of Words and Witt, leave greater Monuments of their Firmity when they came to this great experiment; but I believe hee will expire as little concerned as either of them&#146;  (Marquis of Lansdowne, 11&#150;12). Southwell was buried alongside his infant son Thomas in the family tomb in the eastern aisle of Kinsale church. His wife and their daughter Catherine, who both died in 1679, were buried next to him.<br>
