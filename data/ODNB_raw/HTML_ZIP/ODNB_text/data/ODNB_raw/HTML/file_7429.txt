<span class="headword">Delamaine,  Alexander</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1631, <em>d.</em> 1685), <span class="occ">Muggletonian</span>, was baptized at St Andrew's, Holborn, London, on 3 October 1631, the son of the mathematician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7430/', "Richard Delamain (d. 1644?)")</script> and his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. in or after 1645). His name appears in the register of Merchant Taylors' School, London, in September 1642, alongside three of his brothers, including his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7431/', "Richard Delamaine")</script>.<br>
<br>Delamaine's brother Edward became a Baptist preacher, and Alexander may at some point have shared his brother's beliefs. By June 1654 he had become a Quaker, and as an apprentice in London came into conflict with his master: when challenged as to why he failed to attend family prayers, Delamaine accused his employer of being a hypocrite. His master struck him and summoned a minister&#151;whom Delamaine called a hireling&#151;to reason with him. The master threatened to tear up his indentures and so forfeit Delamaine's right to become a freeman and citizen of the City. The master was further aggrieved with his spiritually rebellious apprentice because he was driving customers away by &#145;my not speaking to them, as to tell them of what they ask me, or bidding them welcome&#146;  (Barclay, 327). How this quarrel&#151;known through a letter Delamaine wrote to a fellow Quaker in the north&#151;ended is uncertain. However, Delamaine did in due course become free of the Salters' Company, establishing himself as a wealthy London tobacconist who carried on his business at the sign of the Three Tobacco Pipes on Bread Street Hill. Moreover Alexander, his son with his first wife, Martha, was baptized in the parish church of St James Garlickhithe on 12 December 1661.<br>
<br>It may have been Delamaine's second marriage in 1667 to Anne Lowe, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hall (<i>d</i>. 1688), which served as the catalyst to Delamaine's conversion to Muggletonianism. On 5 July Lodowicke Muggleton wrote to Anne as &#145;now the wife of Alexander Delamaine, senior&#146;, giving her the formal blessing that she had requested from him; he wrote of the good influence upon her of her dead aunt. There was to be a more striking tribute to her from Muggleton on 3 February 1687, when he addressed her as Delamaine's widow. Even Muggleton's own daughter Sarah could not match her fidelity, prompting Sarah to say in a company of women that &#145;you, when your name was Anne Hall, were the beloved disciple of her father of all the women in London&#146;  (Delamaine, <span class="italic">Spiritual Epistles</span>, 223, 585).<br>
<br>By 1668, the year after his marriage to Anne, Delamaine was clearly committed to her beliefs, to the extent that he passed on to his prophet a remonstrating letter to himself from his brother Edward, the Baptist preacher. Muggleton had urged Delamaine, on the receipt of his first letter, to damn his brother to eternity. Because of the closeness of their relation, Alexander could not bring himself to do it. In a long letter to Edward, Muggleton with some relish repaired the omission on 16 June 1668. Alexander Delamaine went on, however, to be one of the most trusted of Muggleton's confidants. It was to Delamaine that Muggleton turned for help in poor relief for a former servant of the dead co-prophet, John Reeve. And it was to Delamaine that he turned for transmitting the joyous news to believers in Ireland of his release from prison on 19 July 1677. Delamaine chose another way of marking the occasion by bursting into verse, including this couplet:<blockquote>
<div>This, this was the day (19<sup>th</sup> July) fate sparkled disdain<br>
</div>
<div>That a dungeon should longer God's prophet detain.<br>
</div> (Frost and Frost, <span class="italic">Divine Songs</span>, 268)</blockquote>19 July&#151;along with the February celebrations of the anniversary of God's commission to Reeve&#151;became the regular &#145;holidays&#146; celebrated by the sect into the twentieth century. On one such dinner, at the Green Man in Holloway, Middlesex, on 19 July 1682, Delamaine, his wife, and daughter paid 5<i>s</i>. each; the prophet and Mrs Muggleton went free. Delamaine's greatest contribution was to complete in 1682 the transcription of the letters of Muggleton (and a few by Reeve) into one large folio book (BL, Add. MS 60171). He began on 19 April 1682 a second volume of additional letters that &#145;would not goe into my grate book&#146;. The importance of the &#145;Great book&#146;, as it came to be known to believers, cannot be underrated. The movement survived by letters; Muggleton was a gifted, as well as prolific, writer. Towards the end of his life a blessing entered into the &#145;Great book&#146; from Muggleton counted more with followers than oral blessings from him (despite the prophet's gentle remonstrances to the contrary). There is a certain fitness in the fact that the last recorded of these unnecessary written supplements to the oral blessings previously conferred was from Muggleton to Delamaine's daughter Sarah and her husband, Robert, on 14 December 1691. There are two gaps in Delamaine's collection, where letters were later torn out, for the periods September 1673 to August 1676 and October 1680 to May 1681.<br>
<br>Delamaine left behind no published writings; however, he and Thomas Greenhill from Harrow Weald celebrated their recent conversions to the faith in an exchange of letters in March 1669. He also contributed to an interesting debate with his fellow believer John Ladd in 1676 on how far &#145;Reason&#146; (the bad seed, compared with the good seed &#145;Faith&#146;) should be denigrated. Delamaine scorned &#145;reasons wiles&#146; categorically; Ladd sought &#145;a middle way&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 60138, fols. 26&#150;32<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Delamaine died in the second half of December 1685: he made his will on 16 December and it was proved on the 30th. By it he requested to be interred in &#145;the Common buriall in Bethlehem burial place in Moorfields&#146;, where three years later his widow also requested to be buried. He left various small bequests to Muggleton and his wife, and to his own son Alexander, daughter Mary, and son-in-law Robert. To his wife, Anne&#151;Muggleton's favourite woman disciple&#151;Delamaine left a staggering bequest of &pound;1685. Tobacco was a lucrative trade indeed.<br>
