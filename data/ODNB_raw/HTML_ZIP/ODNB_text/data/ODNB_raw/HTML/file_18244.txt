<span class="headword">Marwood,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1818, <em>d.</em> 1883), <span class="occ">public executioner</span>, was baptized at Goulceby, Horncastle, Lincolnshire, on 8 November 1818, the son of William Marwood, cordwainer, and his wife, Elizabeth, and followed his father into the shoemaking trade. He was married, first, to Jessie (1805/6&#150;1867), and was a master cordwainer at Bolingbroke, Lincolnshire, before opening in 1855 the shop at Church Lane, Horncastle, where he made and sold shoes. He was also a Methodist preacher in Horncastle. Shortly after the death of his first wife he married, on 13 October 1867, Ellen Andrews (1822/3&#150;1883), a widow, the daughter of John Langdale, hatter. They lived at Foundry Street, Horncastle. Neither marriage produced children.<br>
<br>Becoming interested in executions, Marwood suggested that, for reasons of humanity, criminals ought not to be choked to death. By carefully ascertaining a criminal's weight, and by employing a proportionate length of rope, he showed that the descent of the body into the pit beneath the scaffold would instantaneously dislocate the vertebrae, and thus cause immediate death. He became a pupil of the executioner William Calcraft and obtained his first engagement as a hangman at Lincoln in 1871; his &#145;longdrop&#146; system worked with success on that and many subsequent occasions. The sheriffs of London and Middlesex appointed him to succeed Calcraft (of whom Marwood said &#145;He hanged them&#151;I executed them&#146;) in June 1874, at an annual retainer of &pound;20 and a fee of &pound;10 per execution; as was usual, he was also entitled to the hanging rope and the clothes of his victims. Among the more celebrated criminals whom he put to death were Charles Peace, Percy Lefroy Mapleton, Dr Lamson, Kate Webster, and Henry Wainwright; he also hanged the Phoenix Park murderers in Dublin. Gustave Dor&eacute; drew Marwood while he was hanging Wainwright on 21 December 1875; it was entitled <span class="italic">L'execution &agrave; Londres</span>.<br>
<br>Marwood outlined his methods in a letter reprinted in the <span class="italic">St Stephen's Review</span> of 3 November 1883; a pamphlet by D. D. D. of 1883 described a visit to Marwood at Horncastle, concluding that Marwood took great pride in his work, which he regarded as a surgeon might view an operation, and aimed to give value for money to his employers. A &#145;respectable-looking&#146; man with broad shoulders, short legs, dark curly hair, and side-whiskers, he was said also to have a &#145;cruel mouth&#146; and one eye half closed. He died of pneumonia and jaundice on 4 September 1883 at Horncastle; he was buried there in the Trinity churchyard two days later. His wife died shortly afterwards. There was brisk competition for the purchase of his effects, his travelling bag fetching &pound;3 and one of his ropes &pound;4 10<i>s</i>. A wax effigy of Marwood in the act of hanging Charles Peace (with a piece of the original rope) joined Madame Tussaud's chamber of horrors.<br>
