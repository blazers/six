<span class="headword">Speight,  Sadie</span> <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Sadie Martin, Lady Martin]</span>  (1906&#150;1992), <span class="occ">architect and designer</span>, was born on 26 May 1906 at 65 Church Street, Standish, Lancashire, one of two daughters of Alfred Speight, a doctor, and his wife, Mary Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Urmston. Both she and her sister, Kathleen, studied at Manchester University. Speight graduated from the school of architecture with first-class honours in 1929. She was a prix de Rome finalist and spent time studying abroad, as holder of the Zimmern travelling scholarship in 1929. In 1930 Speight received the Royal Institute of British Architects' (RIBA) silver medal for drawing and was elected an associate; in 1932 she held the Faulkner fellowship at Manchester University and gained her master's degree in 1933. Between 1930 and 1934 she was also working as an architectural assistant to Halliday and Associates in Manchester. As recipient of the RIBA Neale bursary in 1934 she conducted research into Isabelline architecture in Spain.<br>
<br>On 3 January 1935 Speight married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74528/', "John Leslie Martin (1908&#150;2000)")</script>, who had been a fellow student at Manchester University, and they collaborated on the design of a number of private houses, including one for the textile designer and painter Alastair Morton, and a kindergarten at Northwich, Cheshire (1937&#150;8). Speight, who continued to work under her maiden name, and Martin were part of the group of modernist architects and artists, including Ben Nicholson and Naum Gabo, who produced <span class="italic">Circle: an International Survey of Constructive Art</span> in 1937. The couple's interest in contemporary design was further developed through the Good Form range of modular furniture which they produced for W. Rowntree &amp; Sons of Scarborough <i>c</i>.1938 and the publication, in 1939, of <span class="italic">The Flat Book</span> (commissioned by Herbert Read) which offered advice on all aspects of the creation of the modern home. Many of the designers whose work they recommended, including Barbara Hepworth, Serge Chermayeff, and Milner Gray, were leading exponents of modernism in Britain; some of the products they illustrated, such as chairs by Finnish designer Alvar Aalto, they had purchased for their own home. Speight was an invaluable chronicler of the modern movement in architecture and design in Britain, as well as one of its practitioners. Her achievements in product design and shop layout reveal a particular flair for the use of colour and the grouping of objects, which surely owed much to her early contact with the champions of abstract art in Britain.<br>
<br>After the Second World War Speight was a founder member of the Design Research Unit, set up to enable the skills of designers to be utilized to the full in the post-war recovery. Her designs for household appliances included an electric kettle and iron for Beethoven Electric Equipment. For the Festival of Britain in 1951, in collaboration with Leonard Manasseh, she designed the Rosie Lee cafeteria at the &#145;Live Architecture&#146; exhibition in Lansbury, London. From the 1950s onwards she continued to work on architectural, interior, and exhibition design commissions while bringing up two children, Christopher and Susan, both of whom were to train as architects themselves. These projects included interiors for Swansea University in the 1950s and various Cambridge colleges in the 1960s. In this latter part of her career she also documented her husband's work as a leading architect and emeritus professor at Cambridge; he was knighted in 1957. She designed the layout of his book <span class="italic">Buildings and Ideas</span> (1983) in which he acknowledged her contribution to his career, and was involved in the planning of &#145;Leslie Martin and Associates&#146;, an exhibition organized by the Gulbenkian Foundation in 1990. Almost until the end of her life, Speight continued to work on house conversion projects in Norfolk for family use. In her final months she suffered from motor neurone disease; she died on 23 October 1992 at her home, The Barns, Church Street, Great Shelford, Cambridgeshire.<br>
