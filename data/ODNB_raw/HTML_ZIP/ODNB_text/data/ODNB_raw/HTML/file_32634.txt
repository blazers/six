<span class="headword">Croft,  John</span>  (1833&#150;1905), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, son of Hugh and Maria Croft (<i>d</i>. 1842), was born on 4 August 1833 at Pettinghoe, near Newhaven, Sussex. His grandfather Gilmore Croft, a successful medical practitioner in the City of London, had left Hugh Croft a competence, much of which was spent in farming. After the death of his first wife, Croft's father married again and moved to Lower Clapton, London. John Croft was educated at the Hackney Church of England school, and throughout his life held earnest religious views. He served a short apprenticeship with Thomas Evans of Burwash in Sussex, and entered St Thomas's Hospital in 1850. He was appointed dresser to Le Gros Clark in 1852.<br>
<br>Admitted MRCS and in 1854 made a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries, Croft served as house surgeon at St Thomas's Hospital. After spending five years (1855&#150;60) as surgeon to the <i>Dreadnought</i> hospital ship, he returned to St Thomas's to become demonstrator of anatomy and surgical registrar. He became resident assistant surgeon in December 1863 and in the following year he married Annie Douglas, daughter of Alexander Douglas Douglas; they had no children. On 1 January 1871 Croft became both assistant surgeon and surgeon, when the new buildings of the hospital were opened on the Albert Embankment. In the medical school he was in succession demonstrator of anatomy, lecturer on practical surgery, and lecturer on clinical surgery. Croft resigned his appointments in July 1891, when he was elected consulting surgeon. He was also surgeon to the Surrey Dispensary, the National Truss Society, the Magdalen Hospital at Streatham, and the National Provident Assurance Society. Croft was elected FRCS in 1859, and was a member of the council from 1882 to 1890, vice-president in 1889, and a member of the court of examiners from 1881 to 1886.<br>
<br>Croft was one of the earliest hospital surgeons in London to adopt Listerian methods. His name is chiefly associated with the introduction of &#145;Croft's splints&#146;, which were plaster of Paris cases made with scrubbing flannel and shaped to the limb. They were employed in place of the ordinary splints and the &#145;gum and chalk&#146; bandages which had previously been used in the treatment of fractures of the leg. Croft strongly advocated the early excision of the joint in cases of hip disease. Throughout his career, Croft contributed numerous articles to <span class="italic">St Thomas's Hospital Reports</span> and the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society, the Clinical Society, and other societies.<br>
<br>Croft died on 21 November 1905 at his home, 1 Fitz James Avenue, West Kensington, London, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. He was survived by his wife.<br>
