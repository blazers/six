<span class="headword">Brown,  William Christopher</span>  (1928&#150;2005), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born on 16 September 1928 at Beech House, Croesyceiliog, Monmouthshire, the second of two sons of William Edward Brown (1892&#150;1965), joiner, cabinet-maker, and sometime county councillor, and his wife, Margaret Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hughes (1891&#150;1953), descended from a family of farmers. Brown's grandfather had established a joinery and cabinet-making business, which was continued by his two sons on his death. Brown, later a self-styled &#145;hands-on&#146; engineer, derived pleasure as a boy from visiting the workshop, making articles in wood (including toys during war time), and using tools fashioned by his grandfather and father, the latter having served apprenticeship to a blacksmith. From Monmouth School, he was awarded a state scholarship for a two-year degree course in civil engineering at University College, Southampton. A first-class degree led to a two-year graduate studentship (extended to three years) at Imperial College, London, under A. J. S. Pippard and S. R. Sparkes. His research topic concerned the buckling behaviour of metal plates in structural engineering, which contributed to his first professional paper in 1956.<br>
<br>Brown joined Freeman, Fox &amp; Partners (FFP) in 1951. He worked on the design of the Volta Bridge, a trussed arch, when he was seconded to Halcrow to work on site during 1956. He then returned to FFP where he developed a close working relationship with Gilbert Roberts, taking over leadership of Roberts's engineering team on his retirement in 1969. Roberts was undoubtedly the leader in the resurgence of British expertise in the design of long-span road bridges after the Second World War, a role that Brown inherited and further developed. He became a partner of FFP in 1970. Meanwhile, in 1964 he married Celia Hermione Emmett; there were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>The most spectacular consequence of changes in bridge-building techniques was seen in the (first) Severn Bridge (span 988 metres, completed 1966) with its &#145;aerofoil&#146; deck form, which saved approximately 25 per cent in weight by comparison with the trussed deck of the Forth Bridge (span 1006 metres, completed 1964) and with rectangular box (as opposed to cellular) bridge towers. A cross-braced truss design had been considered for the Severn Bridge but the destruction of its model during wind tunnel testing provided a fortuitous opportunity for a successful trial of an aerofoil form. The optimization of bridge decks remained a special interest of Brown throughout his further career, in relation particularly to their dynamic and aerodynamic characteristics. In 1974 he designed his own simple wind tunnel, which was rebuilt in 1988 with greater capability, to test and improve aerofoil forms to minimize air resistance and avoid risk of &#145;flutter&#146;&#151;potentially catastrophic wind-induced oscillation. Some of his later designs introduced slots in the deck between two or more box structures beneath carriageways or rail-tracks.<br>
<br>In 1969 FFP shared the first annual MacRobert award, for the Severn Bridge superstructure, designed by the team led by Roberts and Brown. The citation described it as &#145;awesome in its striking simplicity&#146;. The following year saw a setback for FFP's reputation as a leading bridge designer, with the collapse during construction of the Milford Haven Bridge in June, followed by the more serious collapse of the West Gate Bridge across the River Yarra in Melbourne in October. The royal commission report on this latter event identified numerous factors contributing to the accident, criticizing Brown and other partners of FFP. Such experiences led to the Merrison report on design and construction of box-girder bridges (1974), which identified the need for clear codes of practice supported by research, which lagged behind practice, coupled with independent design checks.<br>
<br>Brown's last major bridge project with FFP that proceeded to construction was the (first) Bosphorus Bridge (span 1074 metres, completed 1973), for which, after supervising design, he was resident partner for construction in 1972&#150;3. He resigned from FFP in 1985. In 1987 he set up his own consultancy, Brown Beech and Associates (Beech being a toponym recalling his birthplace). His principal commission was as engineer and project director for the second Bosphorus Bridge (span 1090 metres, opened 1988). He prepared preliminary designs for a number of other major bridges. He was appointed lead designer for the Messina road and rail bridge (span 3300 metres), but a change of government led to suspension of the project. This would have been by far the longest span bridge, made possible by Brown's multi-box form of bridge deck.<br>
<br>Brown was an innovative, ingenious, and highly numerate engineer. He contributed also to techniques of bridge construction including, for example, to notable savings in cost in forming the suspension cable. He was appointed OBE in 1966 and elected a royal designer for industry in 1977, serving as master of the Faculty of Royal Designers for Industry from 1983 to 1985. He was elected an honorary fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1978 and a fellow of Imperial College in 1987. He received several honours from overseas. From 1967 Brown lived at 1 Allen Mansions, Allen Street, Kensington, London. His death at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital from a heart attack on 16 March 2005 was followed by cremation at Mortlake crematorium. He was survived by his wife, Celia.<br>
