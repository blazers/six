<span class="headword">Birkhead,  Henry</span>  (1617&#150;1696), <span class="occ">Latin poet</span>, was born in the St Paul's Head tavern, in St Paul's Churchyard, London, and was baptized on 25 September 1617, the son of John Birkhead (<i>d</i>. in or before 1627), the tavern-keeper, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Faldoe (1596/7&#150;1677). He was educated at Thomas Farnaby's celebrated school in Cripplegate, and became a gentleman commoner of Trinity College, Oxford, in 1633, and a scholar on 28 May 1635. He graduated BA on 13 February 1637. Shortly afterwards he contemplated moving to St Omer. His conversion, however, was brief; Archbishop Laud personally exerted his influence to bring him back, and he was elected a fellow of All Souls, Oxford, &#145;being &hellip; esteemed a good philologist&#146;, in 1637. Laud, on trial for his life, was to use Birkhead as an example of his own anti-popery: &#145;Birkhead &hellip; was seduced by a Jesuit, and brought up to London to be conveyed beyond the seas. His Friends complained to me: I had the happiness to find him out, and the blessing from God to settle his Conscience&#146;  (Pittock, 14, 38). Laud's patronage led in 1640 to an appointment in the Norwich diocesan registry. Birkhead became MA on 5 June 1641, and turned to studying law. He was a regular contributor of Latin, Greek, and English verse to Oxford commemorative collections (for example, sixty-seven iambics in <span class="italic">Horti Carolini rosa altera</span>, 1640).<br>
<br>During the civil war Birkhead remained in Oxford, contributing to the English verse commemorative volume for Sir Bevill Grenvill (1643), providing an English ode for <span class="italic">Musarum Oxoniensium epibateria</span> (1643), and writing Latin poetry on contemporary events. The execution of his patron, Laud, in January 1645 led to a heartfelt Latin ode, in irregular metre: this and other poems he published privately and anonymously under the title <span class="italic">Poematia</span> (1645). Birkhead submitted to the parliamentary visitors in 1648, was appointed dean of arts at All Souls in 1649, and in 1654 contributed verses celebrating the peace. Having also, in 1653, begun to study medicine, he returned to law a few years later. By 1656 he felt able to acknowledge authorship of an expanded collection of his poems, titled <span class="italic">Poematia</span>; Laud, though, could not be praised in safety, and the ode on his martyrdom was transferred to Cranmer. The volume was reissued as part of a collaboration with Henry Stubbe of Christ Church, <span class="italic">Otium literatum</span> (<i>c</i>.1658). Birkhead displays some ingenious epigrammatic variety on a range of frivolous and serious topics, such as his limping iambics &#145;In ventricosum gulonem&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>Gulo, videtur ire cum Assecla, Solus;<br>
</div>
<div>Ipse ut Minister, praevium sequens Ventrem:<br>
</div>
<div>Dupliciter hinc Abdomini est gravi servus.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>He translates this as &#145;on Dr Glut&#146;  (pp. 126&#150;7):<blockquote>
<div>He, though Alone, seemes with his Man to strut;<br>
</div>
<div>His Paunch before; as large, Behind goes Glut:<br>
</div>
<div>Thus he is doubly Slave to his cram'd Gut.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Birkhead resigned his fellowship at All Souls in 1657, taking pains to reject any suggestion of involvement in the corruption of which the college was being accused. He practised law in London, with chambers in the Inner Temple, and in Norwich, where he prospered as registrar. He wrote an English play, &#145;The Female Rebellion&#146;, a tragicomedy concerned with divine right, and in 1684 arranged a reprinting (most unusually for such volumes) of the 1643 <span class="italic">Verses on the Death of &hellip; Sir Bevill Grenvill</span>, dedicated to Grenvill's son, the earl of Bath.<br>
<br>Birkhead appears to have married, on 6 May 1677, Jane Stevenson, housekeeper to the duke of Buckingham. Although his relations with her, like his financial affairs, were to prove complicated, his letters continue to indicate his affection, albeit from a distance&#151;&#145;Dear Soul&#146; (1689) and &#145;Dear Heart&#146; (1692), in which he mentioned &#145;a long impertinent story of Elizabeth of Sunderland&#146;  (Pittock, 112&#150;13). Birkhead died on 8 September 1696 and was buried at St Margaret's, Westminster. His will offers 5<i>s</i>. to sister and niece; as for Jane Stevenson:<blockquote>whom I have formerly called and written to as my wife to save her credit in the world though I was never married to her &hellip; She is of Monkwearmouth in the County of Durham. I write this in the presence of God who knowes she has been extream false and many wayes exceeding injurious to me. And therefore I bequeath her but one shilling.</blockquote>Birkhead is chiefly remembered for leaving his lands &#145;in trust to maintain &hellip; for ever a Publick Professor of Poetry in the University of Oxford&#146;  (Pittock, 121&#150;30). The establishment of the poetry professorship did not run smoothly: problems were caused by the confusion of Birkhead's estate, and the low salary offered (&pound;25 was quoted, later &pound;30) made the position little sought after. Hearne noted that &#145;Mr [Anthony] Alsop of Christ Church formerly made interest for the Place &hellip; but he did not stir for it now upon Account of the smallness of the Sallary, and that's the Reason too that none else mov'd for it&#146;  (31 July 1708; Pittock, 127). Alsop was probably the finest Latin poet in Oxford at the time. Joseph Trapp became the first professor: he lectured in Latin about Latin poetry, as his successors did for many years.<br>
