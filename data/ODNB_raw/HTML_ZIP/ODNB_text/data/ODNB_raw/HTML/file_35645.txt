<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rackham,  Arthur</span>  (1867&#150;1939), <span class="occ">painter and illustrator</span>, was born on 19 September 1867 at 2 St James's Terrace, Lambeth, London, the fourth of the twelve children of Alfred Thomas Rackham (1829&#150;1912), a legal clerk, and his wife, Anne Stevenson (1833&#150;1920), the daughter of a Nottingham draper. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35646/', "Bernard Rackham (1876&#150;1964)")</script> was his younger brother. His father became chief clerk at the Admiralty registry in 1875 and Admiralty marshal at the High Court in 1896. Rackham grew up with his many siblings at 210 South Lambeth Road in a busy part of south London, directly opposite the evocative remains of the large garden set out in the seventeenth century by John Tradescant the elder and younger. He was encouraged to paint as a child, and his first paintbox became the &#145;modest silent convenient companion&#146; from which he was rarely parted  (A. Rackham, &#145;In praise of watercolour&#146;, <span class="italic">Old Water-Colour Society's Club</span>, 1933&#150;4, 51&#150;2). He attended the City of London School (1879&#150;83), where he won prizes for drawing, and made many visits to the British Museum and the Natural History Museum, where he painted from the exhibits. His health, however, was indifferent, and at the age of sixteen he left school on medical advice to take a return sea voyage to Australia. This journey, extending from January to July 1884, and the six weeks he spent painting landscapes and plants in and around Sydney, renewed his health and became his informal apprenticeship to art.<br>
<br>On his return Rackham enrolled in evening classes at Lambeth School of Art, where he studied under the landscape painter William Llewellyn. His fellow students included Charles Shannon, Charles Ricketts, and Thomas Sturge Moore, and, with others, they encouraged his talents as a painter and a black and white illustrator. Their example urged him to submit illustrations to magazines, but to earn a secure living Rackham became a junior clerk in the Westminster fire office in 1885, a post he held until 1892. He resigned to join the staff of the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Budget</span> as a news and features illustrator, and the following year he moved to the <span class="italic">Westminster Budget</span> and the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span>. By now he was living in Buckingham Chambers, Strand, and was widening his practice by illustrating books for publishers. His name and reliability for delivery and content became known to publishers and public alike, and he was increasingly in demand. Rackham's first notable successes, which coincided with the beginnings of the fashion for lavishly produced gift books, were illustrations to <span class="italic">The Ingoldsby Legends</span> (1898), <span class="italic">Gulliver's Travels</span> (1900), and <span class="italic">Grimm's Fairy Tales</span> (1900). These were followed by <span class="italic">The Greek Heroes</span> (1903), <span class="italic">Rip Van Winkle</span> (1905), <span class="italic">Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens</span> (1906), and <span class="italic">Alice in Wonderland</span> (1907).<br>
<br>In the earlier books Rackham's style tended to take on the appearance of woodcuts, with the main features being drawn in thick pen and brush. From 1905 to 1910, as printing techniques improved, his line became sharper and likewise his detail more intense. In <span class="italic">Rip Van Winkle</span> and <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> (1908) he developed his gift for drawing witches, gnomes, fairies, and anthropomorphized trees and brought them to a pitch of vivid characterization, sometimes with an unsettling frisson of horror. Trees with human limbs and faces became one of his trademarks, and may have been throwbacks to childhood memories of the Tradescants' garden. Despite the fantasy of his subjects, however, Rackham always maintained a strict sense of reality by giving his figures human traits and foibles and naturalistic, even recognizable, settings&#151;illustrations in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> are variously set in Wimbledon Park, Ruislip churchyard, and Walberswick, Suffolk.<br>
<br>Rackham embarked on his new edition of <span class="italic">Alice in Wonderland</span>, with illustrations to rival John Tenniel's, when the book came out of copyright in 1907. Rackham's advantage over Tenniel was that now he could introduce colour; also his pen line would not be reproduced by wood-engraving. This gave him some new freedoms for invention, but his amendments to the ingrained image of Alice were not only technical. Rackham's Alice was very much a fleshly Edwardian child who would question the <i>status quo</i> of Wonderland. Her courtesy carried an undercurrent of insistent argument. A contemporary critic observed &#145;a tender, flickering light of imagination in [Alice's] eyes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 27 Nov 1907).<br>
<br>Rackham travelled extensively in Europe, particularly to Germany, the Alps, and Italy, and he painted in watercolour on these journeys. As a direct result European landscape and architectural subjects peppered his illustrations, and he developed a particular fondness for German literature and language. This came to the fore in his two illustrated volumes of Wagner's <span class="italic">Ring</span> cycle, <span class="italic">The Rhinegold and the Valkyrie</span> (1910) and <span class="italic">Siegfried</span> (1911).<br>
<br>Unlike his contemporary Edmund Dulac, Rackham was not a bold colourist. He tended to restrict his palette to soft blues, greens, and reds, in local highlights or in several layers of transparent watercolour wash, over a yellowy-buff tone which gives to the whole a quality of vellum, or age. This was a practical as well as an artistic decision, as colour handled in this way could be faithfully reproduced by the three-colour separation printing process which was a new feature of pre-First World War book production.<br>
<br>On 16 July 1903 Rackham married the painter Edyth Harriet Gertrude Gabrielle Starkie (1867&#150;1941) in St Saviour's, Hampstead. She had been born and brought up in Ireland, where her father, William Robert Starkie JP, was an Anglo-Irish resident magistrate in co. Galway. At the age of sixteen she had been taken by her mother, Frances Starkie, on a tour of Europe which included a period in Paris (1884), where she studied painting at the Acad&eacute;mie Julian. On William Starkie's death Edyth and her mother settled in London, and moved in 1897 to 3 Wynchcombe Studios, Hampstead, next door to Rackham. Edyth and Arthur met over the garden wall. At the height of Arthur's success (1905&#150;20) the Rackhams lived in a house designed in 1881 by Charles Voysey, 16 Chalcot Gardens, Hampstead. Each had a studio there in which to pursue their individual artistic enterprises. Although the pattern of her career was undermined by ill health and motherhood&#151;the Rackhams' only surviving child, Barbara, was born in 1908&#151;Edyth Rackham, who worked under her maiden name, became a considerable portrait painter in her own right.<br>
<br>The steady flow of commissions that Rackham received settled, from 1905 to 1913, into a pattern in which late-autumn publication of the year's book coincided with an exhibition at the Leicester Galleries, London, of its original illustrations for sale. Rackham was by now in great demand socially and artistically, and delighted in entertaining and in his celebrity. His tastes, however, remained simple, and because of the frugality of his earlier professional years he found it hard to spend money on pleasure or to waste it on unnecessary expense. Recalling her father as she remembered him during her childhood, Barbara Rackham later wrote:<blockquote>He seemed to me always to look much the same, small and thin, with a deeply grooved but clear-cut face, and smooth pepper-and-salt hair at the sides of his bald head. If he grew slightly balder, more wrinkled and silvery during the years, it hardly altered his general appearance. (Hamilton, <span class="italic">Rackham</span>, 1990, 82)</blockquote>Rackham was active and precise in all he did, and, having introduced his own self-portrait into his work because it was the most convenient and ever-ready face to draw, he continued during the period before the First World War to establish the image of himself that was to precede him for the rest of his life. His nephew the writer Walter Starkie confessed to thinking Rackham <i>was</i> a goblin &#145;in his shabby blue suit and carpet slippers, hopping about the studio with a palette on one arm, waving a paintbrush in his hand&#146;  (W. Starkie, <span class="italic">Scholars and Gypsies</span>, 1963, 18). Eleanor Farjeon remembered: &#145;He watches you from behind Spectacles of Cunning, and there's a whimsical line on his face that can translate itself into the kindliest of smiles. He is light and spare and alert&#146;  (&#145;Arthur Rackham&#151;the wizard at home&#146;, <span class="italic">St Nicholas</span>, March 1914, 385&#150;9).<br>
<br>Rackham's milieu was the London artistic and literary circles of the day. Among his friends were George Bernard Shaw, Charles Holroyd (the director of the National Gallery), and fellow artists Edmund Sullivan, Walter Bayes, and Lewis Baumer. Although characteristically apart from it, he also enjoyed the roistering element of the bohemian London art world. Walter Starkie remembers Augustus John remarking with &#145;a Homeric roar of laughter &hellip; &#147;Don't shock little Arthur too much, ladies and gentlemen: he is learning about life from you and he must not advance too quickly&#148;&#146;  (W. Starkie, <span class="italic">Scholars and Gypsies</span>, 167). He did not develop a friendship with Edmund Dulac, but he did keep a file of cuttings of press reviews of his rival's work.<br>
<br>The First World War effectively destroyed the illustrated gift-book market, and this brought Rackham a financial and professional reverse. He was, however, enough of a celebrity to be asked to create compilations such as <span class="italic">Arthur Rackham's Book of Pictures</span> (1913) and <span class="italic">The Allies' Fairy Book</span> (1916), and he contributed readily to war charity publications. Determined to continue his work despite the war, Rackham also produced editions of Dickens's <span class="italic">A Christmas Carol</span> (1915) and Thomas Malory's <span class="italic">Romance of King Arthur</span> (1917). &#145;In addition to his detachment&#146;, Walter Starkie recalled, &#145;he possessed an innate stoicism which made him endure austerity without complaining&#146;  (W. Starkie, <span class="italic">Scholars and Gypsies</span>, 166).<br>
<br>In 1920 the Rackhams moved from London to Houghton House, Amberley, Sussex, where they lived until 1930. This gave Edyth the country air she needed for her failing health, while for the working week Rackham kept a London studio at Primrose Hill. The principal market for Rackham's work was now the United States. Fashions in England had shifted away from Rackham's fanciful subject matter, and this caused his income to shrink. In America, however, his illustrations remained in demand both for books and advertising. To maintain markets on both sides of the Atlantic, American and English publishers continued to co-operate on books such as <span class="italic">The Sleeping Beauty</span> (1920), Milton's <span class="italic">Comus</span> (1921), and Shakespeare's <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> (1926), and Rackham also accepted contracts for illustrations to books published solely in America, such as A. F. Brown's <span class="italic">The Lonesomest Doll</span> (1928). In 1927 he travelled to New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, returning with an important commission from the New York Public Library to illustrate a unique copy of <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>, to be written out by the calligrapher Graily Hewitt (completed in 1930).<br>
<br>In tune with the changing times, Rackham's style during the 1920s began to adopt hints of art deco, even of syncopation. This was a manner in which he was perhaps uneasy, but nevertheless his natural sense of design, of characterization, and his lyrical handling of line and wash did not leave him. Nor was there any perceptible change in the sympathetic approach he had always adopted to the reading of the texts he had chosen to illustrate. He had a keen ear for the moods his authors evoked and a natural understanding of the subtleties of human expression. This was the mature grounding which he drew upon throughout his career in his narrative evocations of evil, redemption, and fancy. In landscape watercolours and oil paintings, and in the handful of portraits he painted, Rackham emerges as a considerable artist whose gifts had been circumscribed by the needs of commercial book illustration. This reflection had struck Rackham himself, and, writing in the 1930s, he appears to have bitterly regretted having compromised and having followed what was, he believed, a &#145;lesser aim&#146;  (Hamilton, <span class="italic">Rackham</span>, 1990, 149).<br>
<br>Among Rackham's last books&#151;made after the family moved in 1930 to Stilegate, the house they had built near Limpsfield, Surrey&#151;are E. A. Poe's <span class="italic">Tales of Mystery and Imagination</span> (1935), <span class="italic">Peer Gynt</span> (1936), and a third version of <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> (1939). His illustrations to Poe's <span class="italic">Tales</span> have a sharp edge of true horror, a re-emergent strain from the earlier Grimm and Wagner subjects. The last few years of Rackham's life were interrupted by spells in hospital for both him and Edyth. During his last illness he worked on illustrations to Kenneth Grahame's <span class="italic">The Wind in the Willows</span>, a book for which he had a strong affection, and which he had longed for years to illustrate. The resulting pictures (the edition was published posthumously in 1940) are among his most affecting works, replete with wit, invention, and carefully controlled emotion. Rackham died at Stilegate on 6 September 1939 and was cremated in Croydon. There is a memorial in Amberley churchyard lettered by Bettina Furn&eacute;e which was installed in 1992.<br>
<br>Rackham brought a renewed sense of excitement to book illustration that coincided with the rapid developments in printing technology in the early twentieth century. Working with subtle colour and wiry line, he exploited the growing strengths of commercial printing to create imagery and characterizations that reinvigorated children's literature, electrified young readers, and dominated the art of book illustration at the start of a new century. A memorial exhibition of his work was held at the Leicester Galleries in December 1939, and a touring exhibition was shown in Sheffield, Bristol, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, in 1979&#150;80. Principal collections of original watercolours for Rackham's illustrations in the United Kingdom are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum, the Tate collection, and museums and libraries in Cambridge, Leeds, and Sheffield. Original works and papers are in the National Art Library at the Victoria and Albert Museum; the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas, Austin; the Butler Library of the Columbia University, New York; the Free Library of Philadelphia; and the University of Louisville, Kentucky.<br>
