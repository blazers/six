<span class="headword">White,  John</span>  (1570&#150;1615), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and polemicist</span>, was born at Eaton Socon, Bedfordshire, the son of Peter White, vicar of St Neots, Huntingdonshire, and the neighbouring parish of Eaton Socon, and younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29239/', "Francis White (1563/4&#150;1638)")</script>, later successively bishop of Carlisle, Norwich, and Ely; three other brothers also became clergymen. White was educated at St Neots grammar school and then admitted a sizar of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, on 15 February 1586. He was a scholar from Lady day 1588 to Michaelmas 1592, graduated BA in 1590, and proceeded MA in 1593. On 5 July 1592 White married, at Eaton Socon, Anne Sparrowe. The couple had nine children, of whom John, baptized at Eaton Socon in 1595, entered Gonville and Caius College in 1611, and later became vicar of his grandfather's old parish; another son is mentioned by Thomas Fuller as having become a druggist in Lombard Street, London.<br>
<br>White was appointed vicar of Eccles, Lancashire, and fellow of the collegiate church, Manchester, in 1606, but resigned these in 1609 after being presented by Sir John Crofts to the rectory of Barsham, Suffolk. In 1612 he proceeded DD. A sermon originally delivered at Paul's Cross, <span class="italic">Anniversary Commemoration of the Kings most Happy Succession to the Crowne of England</span>, was published in 1615, and early that year White was made a chaplain-in-ordinary to James I.<br>
<br>White was highly regarded as a polemicist against the Church of Rome. He indicated that his writings were pastoral endeavours to &#145;help the seduced out of their [Catholic] errors and confirm Protestants in the truth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Way to the True Church</span>, preface *3). Against the 1605 publication of <span class="italic">The Treatise of Faith</span>, written by the celebrated Jesuit John Percy (1569&#150;1641), better known by his alias Fisher the Jesuit, White brought out his <span class="italic">Way to the true church wherin the principal motives persuading to Romanisme are familiarly disputed</span> (1608). Further editions of this Calvinist defence of the reformed faith were issued in 1610, 1612, and 1616. After subsequent replies by Percy in 1612 and 1614, White again took up his pen against the Jesuit with his <span class="italic">Defense of the Way to the True Church</span> (1614). This treatise occasioned William Wright SJ (1563&#150;1639) to publish <span class="italic">A discovery of certain notorious shifts, evasions, and untruths uttered by M. John White, minister</span> (1614), and two years later his larger <span class="italic">Treatise of the Church</span> (1616). The former president of Douai, Thomas Worthington (1549&#150;1622), also entered the fray in <span class="italic">Whyte Died Black</span> (1615).<br>
<br>In his will White hints at financial &#145;distresses&#146; suffered at Eccles, &#145;which I was never able to look through to this day&#146;. This seems to indicate that he was in poverty when he died in Lombard Street, London. He was buried on 28 May 1615 at St Mary Woolnoth in the City, although his will was not proved by his widow until February 1620. In 1624 his brother Francis White published <span class="italic">The Workes of that Learned and Reverend Divine, John White</span>, containing the polemics, two sermons and an anti-papal work of his own.<br>
