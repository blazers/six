<span class="headword">Cooper,  Thomas Thornville</span>  (1839&#150;1878), <span class="occ">traveller and promoter of trade</span>, the eighth son of John Ibbetson Cooper, coal fitter and shipowner, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Douglas, was born on 13 September 1839, at Bishopwearmouth, co. Durham. He was educated at the Grange School, Bishopwearmouth, and then by a tutor in Sussex. There his health failed, and he was advised to take a voyage to Australia where he decided to remain, making several journeys into the interior of the country. In 1859 he went to India, and worked in Madras for Arbuthnot &amp; Co. In 1861 he threw up the appointment and went to Sind to visit a brother who was resident there. In the following year he visited Bombay and then went by way of Beypore and Madras to Burma, where he studied Burmese. In 1863 he rejoined his brother, who was now in Shanghai; there Cooper joined the Shanghai volunteer corps and took his share in the protection of the city against the Taiping insurgents. After the suppression of the uprising the question of the commercial penetration of China, and particularly the route through to India, became an issue of concern to British merchants, especially as the construction of the Suez Canal drew to a close. Anglo-French rivalry in this area was keenly felt, and all of Cooper's travels must be seen against this background.<br>
<br>In 1868 Cooper left his position as a solicitor's clerk with Edward Lawrence, and undertook an attempt to penetrate through Tibet to India. He successfully canvassed for funds from the merchants of Shanghai to support his journey, although many believed he was merely seeking a free journey home, with some good shooting on the way. After being thwarted in his original travel arrangements by the French consul in Hankow (Hankou) he left that city on 4 January with a Christian Chinese interpreter known as George Philips, travelling by way of Chungking (Chongqing), Chengtu (Chengdu), Kangding, and Litang to Paan. From this point he had hoped to reach Rima on the Luhit Brahmaputra in eight days, but the Chinese authorities forbade him to continue his journey westward. He therefore decided to take the route to Bhamo via Dali, then the capital of the Muslim rebel state, the Pingnanguo, known to the British as the Panthay kingdom (1855&#150;73). He struck southwards, following the valley of the Lancang Jiang, and reached Zegu on the western bank of that river&#151;the most westerly point that had then been reached by any traveller from China in the region of the great rivers north of Bhamo. At this point he was within 100 miles of Manchi, on the upper Irrawaddy, which had been visited by Lieutenant Wilcox from India in 1826. Still continuing his journey southward Cooper arrived at Weisi (Weixi), nearly due west of Likiang (Lijiang), where he obtained passports for Dali. At a distance of three days' journey from Weisi, however, he was stopped by a tribal chief who had just switched allegiance from the Muslim rebels and who refused to allow him to proceed. He was compelled, therefore, to return to Weisi, where he was imprisoned and threatened with death by the civil authorities on suspicion that he was in communication with the Panthays. For five weeks he was kept a close prisoner, but was afterwards (6 August) allowed to depart. Finding it impossible to continue his exploration further, he returned to Yaan (Ya'an). Proceeding down the Min River he struck the Yangtze (Yangzi) at Ipin (Yibin), and from there descended the river to Hankow, where he arrived on 11 November 1868.<br>
<br>Although Cooper had failed to reach India from China, he was lauded in Shanghai, and after he had written an initial report on his trip, published under the title <span class="italic">Journal of an Overland Journey from China towards India</span> (1869), he attempted almost immediately to reverse the process, and to enter China from Assam. Again taking Philips with him, he left Sadiya in October 1869, and passing up the line of the Brahmaputra, through the Mishmi country, fighting malaria and fortified by visions of Allsopp's Best India Pale Ale, he reached Prun, a village about 20 miles from Rima. Here he again met with such determined opposition from the authorities that he was obliged to turn back. Almost immediately afterwards he returned to England and published several articles and the accounts of his journeys <span class="italic">Travels of a Pioneer of Commerce</span> (1871) and <span class="italic">The Mishmee Hills</span> (1873). In 1872 he agitated for the India Office to allow him to accompany a Panthay mission led by Liu Daohang, which had visited London, back to the frontier of Yunnan, where Cooper would in his personal capacity investigate trading possibilities with the rebels. On arriving at Rangoon he learned that the uprising had been crushed, and his mission was therefore at an end; he had, however, made good use of his expenses on the way, a box at the opera in Vienna being deemed vital for the self-styled &#145;Equerry to His Highness Prince Hassan&#146;. The viceroy, Lord Northbrook, appointed him political agent at Bhamo. Unfortunately ill health obliged Cooper to return almost immediately to England, where he was attached to the political and secret department of the India Office as a copyist, and supported his two unmarried sisters on his salary.<br>
<br>In 1876 Cooper was sent to India with dispatches to the viceroy and presents for distribution in connection with the imperial durbar at Delhi; he was appointed officiating political agent at Bhamo in April 1877. In November of the same year he received W. J. Gill and William Mesney after the successful termination of their journey from Yunnan. At Bhamo, on 24 April 1878, while reading, Cooper was shot through the heart and lungs by a soldier of his guard, whose enmity he had aroused through the infliction of a series of punishments. He was buried just outside the station compound. His debts were such that little remained of his estate for his sisters.<br>
<br>Cooper was certainly courageous, and inspired affection among his friends. No mere traveller, he styled himself, even in his will, the &#145;Pioneer of Commerce&#146;, and the vision of opening a market for Assam tea and Manchester goods in Yunnan was a constant in his public and private utterances. He was a successful self-publicist (if a self-important one who habitually acquired official-sounding titles), but at root he was a freelance imperial activist, ever ready to solicit funds for his ventures, whose connections with the India Office were tenuous, and of whom officials were wary.<br>
