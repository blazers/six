<span class="headword">Burrows, Sir  Frederick John</span>  (1887&#150;1973), <span class="occ">trade unionist and administrator in India</span>, was born at Bollow, Westbury-on-Severn, Gloucestershire, on 3 July 1887. He was fifth of five sons and the youngest of eleven children of John Burrows, a general labourer, and his wife, Ellen Abell. He was educated at Walmore Hill School and joined the Great Western Railway, becoming a goods checker at Backney near Ross-on-Wye. In 1912 he married Dora Beatrice (<i>d</i>. 1968), daughter of G. Hutchings, a Hereford railway guard. They had one son and one daughter. He served with the Grenadier Guards during the First World War, became a company sergeant-major, and won the meritorious service medal.<br>
<br>On his return to the Great Western Railway, Burrows worked initially at Grange Court and subsequently at Ross, where he became a well-known local figure. He was secretary of the small branch of the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR) and eventually became a justice of the peace. Until the mid-1930s Burrows seemed destined to remain a rural railwayman working assiduously to develop a labour movement in a Conservative community. However, thanks to his qualities, he became a member of his Great Western sectional council of the NUR and was elected to the NUR executive for the years 1937&#150;9 as the representative for the union's goods section for south Wales and south-west England.<br>
<br>Burrows emerged quickly as a prominent member of the union's right-wing faction at a time when the left was increasing its strength among the NUR's activists. In July 1941 delegates to the annual general meeting elected him union president for 1942, a position he retained for the maximum three-year tenure. Although the presidency was a lay position, the volume of business meant that it was effectively a full-time post. Burrows worked closely with the union's new general secretary, John Benstead; their political and industrial views were similar. Burrows insisted that any wartime strike was &#145;unthinkable&#146;, but the industry's strategic importance, backed by state control, ensured wage advances. Under his presidency, the NUR's relationships with other railway unions became unusually cordial.<br>
<br>Burrows's wartime views articulated a progressive patriotism. &#145;There must be no two Englands when the peace is planned; no stately homes and insanitary cottages, no Princes of Industry and men on the dole&#146;. Soviet resistance to the German invasion appeared to demonstrate the value of meritocracy. &#145;There not only do the workers fight, but the workers also lead, and ability only is the password for promotion&#146;. He welcomed the 1944 <span class="roman">Education Act</span> as a step towards the democratization of education, but felt that a Labour government should tackle &#145;the Public School question&#146;. His advocacy of equality of opportunity included sexual equality. The exigencies of wartime mobilization should have destroyed any idea of women's inferiority  (NUR presidential addresses, 1942, 1943, 1944, NUR collection).<br>
<br>Despite his widely shared enthusiasm for the Soviet war effort, Burrows remained a thorough opponent of the Communist Party. During his presidency he served on the Labour Party's national executive committee (NEC) as his union's nominee to the trade union section, and strongly opposed communist attempts to affiliate to the Labour Party. However, the NUR voted narrowly at its annual general meeting in 1943 to support communist affiliation. Nevertheless Burrows's reputation among the party's senior politicians increased. He was more active than many trade unionists within the NEC, not least on the party's international committee. His record as NUR president seems also to have attracted the positive approval of Winston Churchill.<br>
<br>This reputation as a capable representative of the Labour viewpoint led to Burrows's selection as a member of the three-man commission on constitutional reform for Ceylon under Lord Soulbury. The trio arrived on the island in late December 1945 and left early in the following April. Their task was essentially to assess and to amend an earlier constitutional draft produced by the Ceylon ministers. Burrows subsequently worked on the Colonial Advisory Board; in both roles he was regarded as successful. Attlee's verdict in August 1945 was &#145;first class abilities&#146;. This assessment had particular significance since it was in a prime-ministerial memorandum to the secretary of state for India, Lord Pethick-Lawrence, concerning candidates for Indian governorships. In November 1945 Burrows's appointment as governor of Bengal was announced, a symbolic action in the early months of the Labour government.<br>
<br>Burrows arrived in India in February 1946. His rapport with the viceroy, Lord Wavell, was immediate. His solidity and imperturbability appealed to the viceroy, as did his pride in his own military experience: &#145;he is really a complete Conservative in his ideas and thinks the Grenadier Guards the finest body ever collected&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wavell: the Viceroy's Journal</span>, 329, 8 Aug 1946). The situation in Bengal was extremely difficult. One feature fitted easily with his established political sentiments, however: he detected communist influence in strikes and other agitations. More seriously, Bengal at this time saw escalating communal tensions between Muslims and Hindus. Burrows was painfully aware of his limited resources of police and army units, in both numbers and morale.<br>
<br>Within Bengal, Burrows had to bargain with a newly elected and Muslim-dominated provincial government under H. S. Suhrawardy. His attempts to facilitate agreement on an inter-communal coalition were unsuccessful. Instead there were communal conflicts marked by heavy loss of life, first in Calcutta in August 1946, and later that year at Noakhali in East Bengal. The Calcutta killings provoked a sombre comparison by Burrows: &#145;I observed very great damage to property and streets littered with corpses. I can honestly say that parts of the city &hellip; were as bad as anything I saw when I was with the Guards on the Somme&#146;  (Burrows to Wavell, 22 Aug 1946, in Mansbergh and Moon, 8, doc. 197).<br>
<br>The Congress movement criticized Burrows's apparent failure to protect Hindus, but several other observers felt he had achieved as much as was feasible, given his limited resources. &#145;I realised that I was taking on an extremely difficult job, I did not realise that I was taking on a practically impossible one&#146; was his assessment in November 1946  (<span class="italic">Wavell: the Viceroy's Journal</span>, 369, 3 Nov 1946). The &#145;impossibility&#146; was the product not just of the situation in Bengal, where partition became increasingly likely, but also of shifts and obscurities within British government strategy. In such a situation Burrows's calmness was a particular strength, when &#145;holding the ring&#146; seemed to be the only option until the transfer of power in August 1947.<br>
<br>Burrows's actions were underpinned by a thorough belief in the durability and desirability of the British empire. One episode during his governorship was revealing. In May 1946 he wrote to Attlee deprecating the report of the Anglo-American committee on Palestine. He feared that recommendations responsive to the Jewish case might inflame Muslim opinion in India, but there was a more fundamental concern that would have gladdened the more conservative elements in the Foreign Office: &#145;I earnestly hope that, at whatever cost, the recommendations of the Report, which endanger the life-line of the British Empire will be repudiated&#146;  (Burrows to Attlee, 6 May 1946, Mansbergh and Moon, 8, doc. 205).<br>
<br>Following his return to England, Burrows served as chairman of the Agricultural Land Commission from 1948 until 1963 and was a director of Lloyds Bank from 1950 to 1958. He was high sheriff of Herefordshire in 1955 and deputy lieutenant from 1950 until his death in 1973. He was appointed GCIE in 1945 and GCSI in 1947. During the 1959 general election he announced in a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> that he could no longer support the Labour Party. He gave two principal reasons: the party policies on steel nationalization and the municipalization of rented houses. He characterized the latter as &#145;so Gilbertian that it could well have appeared in <span class="roman">Alice in Wonderland</span>&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 Oct 1959).<br>
<br>Burrows was physically a commanding figure, 6 feet tall and 16 stone. He spoke in a west-country &#145;burr&#146; and was thought friendly, a quality which, when allied to firmly held and often conventional views, made him a reassuring figure, not least to those distant from the labour movement. His working life was spent in uniform: the Great Western Railway, the British army, the Bengal governorship. These experiences were readily reconciled with his work within the NUR, given its rule-governed procedures and its strong sense of solidarity. His moderation was complemented by a sense of duty to both workmates and the wider society. &#145;I have always been prepared to do everything possible for England&#146; was his response to the challenge of the Bengal governorship  (<span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>, 7 Nov 1945). His wife, who was awarded the kaisar-i-Hind gold medal in 1947, died in 1968. Burrows died at Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, on 20 April 1973.<br>
