<span class="headword">Bunsen, Sir  Maurice William Ernest  de</span>, first baronet  (1852&#150;1932), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born in London on 8 January 1852, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32170/', "Ernest Christian Ludwig de Bunsen (1819&#150;1903)")</script>, of Abbey Lodge, Regent's Park, London. He was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53760/', "Christian von Bunsen, Baron von Bunsen")</script>, who was Prussian minister in England from 1841 to 1854, and the biographer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3945/', "Frances von Bunsen")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53760/', "Bunsen, Christian von")</script>]. His father, a soldier, courtier, and mystical writer, became a British subject in 1849. His mother, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1903), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11775/', "Samuel Gurney")</script>, was one of the Gurneys of Earlham and a remarkable character; she was a niece of Elizabeth Fry, with whom she travelled abroad.<br>
<br>De Bunsen was brought up with a Quaker background in the cultured and cosmopolitan atmosphere of Abbey Lodge, and was educated at Rugby School and Christ Church, Oxford. He entered the diplomatic service in 1877. In his third post, at Madrid, he was commended for his dignity and discretion when left in charge of the legation at a difficult time. After three years (1891&#150;4) as secretary of legation in Japan, he was, in 1894, appointed charg&eacute; d'affaires and consul-general at Bangkok, where he was in the confidence of the king and the Siamese authorities in their struggle against French pressure. He was first secretary at Constantinople (1897&#150;1902) in the days of Abdul Hamid and the Cretan troubles, and was then transferred to Paris as first secretary. He was appointed CB in 1895, CVO in 1903, and KCVO in 1905, in which year he went as minister to Lisbon.<br>
<br>In 1906 de Bunsen was sworn of the privy council and appointed KCMG, GCVO, and ambassador at Madrid, where he and his wife were popular and enjoyed the friendship and confidence of Alfonso XIII and his queen. Perhaps de Bunsen's most conspicuous diplomatic achievement was his unofficial mediation, in 1911&#150;12, at the invitation of both parties, in the dispute over Morocco between France and Spain, which materially helped to bring about a peaceful settlement. He was appointed GCMG in 1909. In 1913 he succeeded Sir Fairfax Cartwright as ambassador at Vienna, where he kept the British government in close touch with the complicated political developments preceding the outbreak of war.<br>
<br>De Bunsen returned from Vienna on 14 August 1914 and served as assistant undersecretary in the Foreign Office from March 1915 to March 1918. He chaired an important committee, known as the de Bunsen committee, on the future of Britain's role in the Middle East, which reported in May 1915, adumbrating a British sphere of influence in Palestine to the exclusion of France. De Bunsen led a successful mission to seven South American states as ambassador on special mission, a post he held from April 1917 until October 1918, when he retired from the service. He was on 1 January 1919 created a baronet. He was subsequently active in the City and in the Royal Geographical Society and other such bodies.<br>
<br>De Bunsen's good looks and appearance went well with his courtesy, fearless character, and complete honesty. In the service he stood out among contemporary diplomatists for his ability to reconcile opposing parties and to bring the representatives of clashing interests to discuss their differences with reason and temper. He was looked upon as the ideal chief, for kindness, example, and hospitality. A keen sportsman and a good shot, he was also a lover of literature and well informed on many subjects. His most notable accomplishment was in public and personal relationships and in the art of living.<br>
<br>De Bunsen's family life was a happy one. In 1899 he married Berta Mary, elder daughter of Armar Henry Lowry Corry, who was in the Foreign Office; she was a niece of M. W. Lowry Corry, Lord Rowton, Disraeli's secretary. They had four daughters. He died at his house, 43 Ennismore Gardens, London, on 21 February 1932, his wife surviving him.<br>
