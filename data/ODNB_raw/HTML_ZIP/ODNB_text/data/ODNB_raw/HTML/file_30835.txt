</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boult, Sir  Adrian Cedric</span>  (1889&#150;1983), <span class="occ">conductor</span>, was born on 8 April 1889 at 4 Abbots Hayes, Liverpool Road, Chester, the only son and second child of Cedric Randal Boult (1853&#150;1950), an oil merchant, and his wife, Katherine Florence Barman (<i>d</i>. 1927). He showed exceptional early musical promise. He entered Westminster School in 1901 and attended London concerts and operas whenever he could. Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford. There music again occupied most of his time (he was also a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley), and he was president of the University Musical Club in 1910.<br>
<br>On leaving Oxford, in September 1912 Boult joined the conducting class at Leipzig conservatory. However, the chief attraction was the opportunity to study Arthur Nikisch at work with the Gewandhaus Orchestra. After returning to England in 1913 he became an extra member of Covent Garden music staff and helped in preparations for the first London performance of Wagner's <span class="italic">Parsifal</span> on 2 February 1914. Three weeks later, on 27 February, he made his d&eacute;but as a conductor in the public hall, West Kirby, in a programme that included the first performance of Butterworth's <span class="italic">The Banks of Green Willow</span>. He was unfit for military service when war was declared in August 1914, so he returned to Oxford in October to sit and pass his first doctor of music examination. He then went to London to work for the War Office, but continued his musical activity. In February and March 1918 he organized four concerts in Queen's Hall, at which he conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in contemporary English works. This led to an invitation from Gustav Holst to conduct the first (private) performance of the orchestral suite <span class="italic">The Planets</span> in September 1918. He conducted the Diaghilev Russian Ballet's 1919 London season, joined the staff of the Royal College of Music, and, in March 1920, conducted Elgar's second symphony, drawing from Elgar the comment: &#145;I feel that my reputation in the future is safe in your hands&#146;  (Kennedy, 73). At the age of thirty-one Boult was now firmly established. In 1924 he was appointed conductor of the City of Birmingham Orchestra, and for the next six years his adventurous programmes attracted widespread attention. He conducted Wagner and Verdi for the British National Opera Company in 1925 and was conductor of the Bach Choir, London, from 1928 to 1931.<br>
<br>In 1930 Boult became the BBC's director of music when Percy Pitt retired. The BBC, with John Reith as director-general, was forming its own symphony orchestra, and Boult conducted the inaugural concert on 22 October 1930, a historic evening in British music-making. This led to his appointment as the orchestra's permanent conductor. He was the ideal choice for a post that in effect made him music educator-in-chief to the nation through broadcasting. He encouraged the engagement of celebrated guest conductors and was willing to conduct works, in programmes chosen by others, which were regarded as important even though they had little appeal for him personally. He was a sound, if not brilliant, trainer in fundamental principles, as was acknowledged by Arturo Toscanini when the latter first conducted the orchestra in 1935 and declared it one of the best he had encountered. As a guest conductor in the 1930s Boult worked with the Vienna Philharmonic, Boston Symphony, and New York Philharmonic orchestras. He conducted the first (concert) performances in England of Berg's <span class="italic">Wozzeck</span> in 1934 and Busoni's <span class="italic">Doktor Faust</span> in 1937 and the first London performance of Mahler's ninth symphony, also in 1934. He conducted the first performance of Vaughan Williams's fourth symphony in 1935 (and of his sixth in 1948).<br>
<br>On 1 July 1933 Boult married Ann Mary Grace, the daughter of Captain Francis Alan Richard Bowles RN, of Sittingbourne, Kent. She was previously married to the singer and opera administrator Sir (James) Steuart Wilson, with whom she had four children.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, despite the loss of players to the services (forty out of ninety between 1939 and 1946), Boult kept the standards of the BBC orchestra as high as he could and maintained the enterprising quality of the programmes. In 1942 he handed over the post of director of music to Arthur Bliss. At the end of the war he found a changed attitude to the orchestra in the upper echelons of the BBC and had to fight hard to restore it to its pre-war glory.<br>
<br>Although Reith had told Boult, &#145;When you get to 60 [the BBC's age for retirement] tell us what extra help you want and we'll draw up a new contract&#146;  (private information), Reith had left the BBC in 1938, and Boult's enforced retirement in 1949 was engineered by the head of music, Sir (James) Steuart Wilson, whose divorced first wife Boult had married in 1933. Boult was principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra from 1950 to 1956. With it he embarked on a busy recording schedule, including the complete cycle of Vaughan Williams's symphonies. In 1953 he conducted the music at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II (he had served in the same capacity in 1937 for King George VI). In 1959&#150;60, having heard that the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra had been unable to find a successor at short notice after its conductor had resigned, he returned to his old haunt with a vintage Boult series of programmes. After 1960 he spent more and more time in the recording studio, making important recordings of Elgar, Vaughan Williams, Holst, Parry, Brahms, and some Wagner. By now he had attained more popularity with the public than he had ever enjoyed. He was especially moved by a return to Covent Garden to conduct the Royal Ballet in Vaughan Williams's <span class="italic">Job</span>, Mahler's <span class="italic">Das Lied von der Erde</span>, and Elgar's <span class="italic">Enigma Variations</span>. His last public appearance was at the London Coliseum on 24 June 1978, when, unannounced, he conducted Elgar's ballet <span class="italic">The Sanguine Fan</span>. He ended his recording career on 20 December of that year with works by Parry. He died in a West Hampstead nursing home in Christchurch Avenue on 22 February 1983, leaving his body to medical science. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Boult was knighted in 1937 and was made a Companion of Honour in 1969. He was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1944 and the Harvard Glee Club medal in 1956. He had honorary degrees from five universities: Birmingham (1930), Liverpool (1947), Cambridge (1953), Reading (1976), and Oxford (1979), and was an honorary student of Christ Church. The Royal College of Music conferred the honorary degree of doctor of music of the college on him in 1981.<br>
<br>In the music he admired most, Boult was often a great conductor; in the rest, an extremely conscientious one. His manner was undemonstrative and he liked to use a long baton. If from behind he seemed unexciting and unemotional, the players could see the animation in his face&#151;and he was capable of frightening outbursts of temper at rehearsals. Tall and erect, with something of the military in his appearance (particularly the moustache), he seemed the personification of the English gentleman. But recipients of his cutting wit and occasional sarcasm knew that this was not the whole picture. He was generous to orchestral players and loyal to colleagues, but on certain occasions, when difficulties arose of a quasi-political nature, he took the line of least resistance. How to assess a conductor's lasting influence is difficult if not impossible, but Boult undoubtedly established a tradition of catholic taste at the BBC. His championship of British music was carried on by one of his pupils, Vernon Handley, and he was the inspiration of the career of another pupil, Timothy Reynish, whose work was mainly at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester. He wrote two books on conducting, <span class="italic">The Point of the Stick</span> (1920) and <span class="italic">Thoughts on Conducting</span> (1963), and his autobiography, <span class="italic">My Own Trumpet</span>, was published in 1973.<br>
