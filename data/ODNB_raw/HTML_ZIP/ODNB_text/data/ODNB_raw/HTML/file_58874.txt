<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Parr family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1370&#150;1517), <span class="occ">gentry</span>, played a leading role in Westmorland in the fifteenth century. The family was founded by <a name="cosubject_58872"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Parr</span>  (<em>c.</em>1350&#150;1404)<span class="occ"></span>, who held one-eighth of the vill of Parr in the parish of Prescot, Lancashire. In May 1370 Parr was pardoned his part in a murder because he was going overseas in the service of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster. Parr remained in Gaunt's service until the duke's death, first as a soldier, and later as a trusted member of the ducal retinue. It was probably under Gaunt's aegis that about 1380 Parr married Elizabeth Roos (<i>d</i>. 1392&times;6), the heir of her grandfather Thomas, although the Parrs themselves were later to tell another story. According to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58528/', "Sir William Parr (d. 1547)")</script> one of his ancestors was clerk of the kitchen to Lord Roos, fell in love with his daughter, and married her against her father's wishes. However the marriage was achieved, it was to establish the Parrs as a force in the north-west, bringing William a quarter of the barony of Kendal, including the castle, on Thomas Roos's death in 1390. By then Parr was one of Gaunt's knights bachelor, receiving an annual fee of &pound;50. His closeness to Gaunt was to be marked by further patronage, including land in Gascony, and he was one of the duke's executors. On Gaunt's death Richard II took him into his service, a move perhaps aided by Parr's second marriage (before October 1396) to Margaret, widow of the Cheshire knight Lawrence Dutton, who had been a retainer of Richard II's father, Edward, the Black Prince.<br>
<br>In spite of his Lancastrian background, Parr did not benefit particularly from the accession of Henry IV, although he became one of the king's knights. He died on 3 October 1404, leaving as his heir his son <a name="cosubject_58873"></a><span class="headword">John Parr</span>  (<em>c.</em>1382&#150;1408)<span class="occ"></span>, who at about this time married Agnes Crophill (1371&#150;1436). She was a considerable heiress, and although she already had a son from her first marriage to Sir Walter Devereux (<i>d</i>. 1403), which meant that any children with Parr were unlikely to inherit, she brought Parr a life interest in her estates, including Weobley, Herefordshire, as well as her Devereux dower. The Parrs, however, scarcely had time to benefit from the marriage. John died on 25 July 1408, leaving as his heir his son with Agnes, <a href="#cosubject_58874">Thomas [<i>see below</i>]</a>, who was less than a year old. Any chance of further family advancement was thus inevitably postponed. Within ten days of John's death, his son's wardship had been disposed of by the crown, and in 1413 it passed to Sir Thomas Tunstall of Thurland, Lancashire, who married the heir to his daughter Alice, presumably before his death in 1415.<br>
<br>When <a name="cosubject_58874"></a><span class="headword">Sir Thomas [i] Parr</span>  (1407/8&#150;1461)<span class="occ"></span> entered his inheritance in 1429 he thus had to rebuild the family's influence, but he started with the advantage of an estate worth between &pound;80 and &pound;100 p.a. For the next thirty years Thomas successfully built up his authority in Westmorland, although curiously he did not use his influence to secure suitable brides for his three sons, who were all still unmarried at his death. Within a year of his coming of age Thomas was escheator of Cumberland and Westmorland, and he was knighted about the same time. He was returned to parliament six times as knight of the shire for either Cumberland or Westmorland. From 1435&#150;6 he was acting as under-sheriff of the latter county for its hereditary sheriff, Thomas, eighth Baron Clifford, which gave him a major role in the administration of the shire. Parr became involved in a long-running dispute with Sir Henry Bellingham of Burneside, who in 1441 complained that he could not get justice against Parr because &#145;the coroners of the same Shire bene his meynyall men&#146;  (Storey, 77). The quarrel continued, and in February 1445 Bellingham's men were reported to have attacked Parr in London, where he was attending parliament, with the intention of killing him. Only in 1449 was their feud settled.<br>
<br>Parr also extended his landed influence by leasing royal estates in the county. His greatest acquisition was two-thirds of the crown's share of the barony of Kendal, which he leased in 1438. This more than tripled his income, and he cannot have been pleased when, in 1443 (half-way through the term of his lease), the lands were granted to John Beaufort, duke of Somerset. The grant did, however, bring Parr into closer contact with Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury, who was made steward of the lands by his cousin Somerset in 1444. By the 1450s Parr was one of the earl's leading retainers, and with the coming of civil war followed Salisbury into the Yorkist camp. He was with the earl at Bloreheath and Ludlow in 1459, which led to his attainder in the Coventry parliament, and he was evidently with the earl at the battle of Wakefield at the end of 1460, for several chroniclers list him among the dead. He survived the battle, however, to enter the service of Edward IV, and died at the end of November 1461.<br>
<br>Unlike his father, Parr left an adult heir, and one who already stood high in the king's favour, so there was no break in the family's ability to benefit from the Yorkist victory. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21404/', "Sir William Parr (1434&#150;1483)")</script> worked closely with his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58524/', "John Parr")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21404/', "Parr, Sir William")</script>] (his heir until his death in 1475) to maintain the family's influence in the north-west, and&#151;a new departure&#151;at court. Their efforts paid off, and William came closer than any other Parr to securing possession of the crown's share of the barony of Kendal (representing half the total barony), which had been used throughout the earlier part of the century to endow members of the royal family. In 1471, as a reward for his loyalty to Edward IV in the crisis of 1470&#150;71, William was granted the reversion of the third part of the crown share, held by the dowager duchess of Bedford&#151;a reversion that materialized less than a year later. The crown also brokered an agreement whereby Margaret Beaufort, the holder of the other two-thirds, granted the land to Parr in return for &pound;190 p.a.<br>
<br>William was surely close to being ennobled as lord of Kendal, and his prospects of advancement looked even brighter in 1483 when Richard, duke of Gloucester, with whom Parr had been associated throughout Edward IV's second reign, became king. It must have seemed a crushing blow when Parr himself died at the end of the year, leaving a five-year-old as the head of the family, without even an adult uncle to steer the family fortunes: John had died in 1475 and the youngest brother, Thomas [ii], on 14 April 1471. The minority did at least mean that, when Richard III was defeated at Bosworth in 1485, the Parrs were able to avoid the penalties that might have followed too close an attachment to his cause, but the family was clearly vulnerable, and it was a shrewd move by William's widow, Elizabeth Fitzhugh (1462&#150;<i>c</i>.1505), to marry <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28162/', "Nicholas Vaux (d. 1523)")</script> of Harrowden, Northamptonshire, who had grown up in the household of the new king's mother, Margaret Beaufort. The marriage, accomplished by 1487, was arranged by Margaret, whose own territorial interests in Kendal (ceded to Sir William Parr in 1471) had now been restored by Henry VII. The marriage drew Margaret's potential rivals into her own circle, while offering them protection.<br>
<br>From the Parrs' perspective, Elizabeth's marriage reaped rewards, although it meant a shift of interest for the family. Vaux secured good marriages for all his stepchildren, but within his own sphere of influence rather than in the north-west. <a name="cosubject_58875"></a><span class="headword">Sir Thomas [iii] Parr</span>  (1478&#150;1517)<span class="occ"></span> and his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58528/', "William Parr (c.1480&#150;1547)")</script> grew up in the Tudor court circle, and Thomas in particular was an early intimate of Henry VIII, although he was not to live long enough to enjoy the full benefits of royal favour. When Thomas entered his inheritance in 1499 the family's gains from Yorkist patronage had been resumed by the crown, but Thomas's own acquisitions more than compensated for their loss. In 1508 he married Maud, the younger of the two daughters and coheirs of Sir Thomas Green of Greens Norton, Northamptonshire. Green had been a friend of Nicholas Vaux, who married the elder daughter himself. In 1513 Thomas inherited, through his mother Elizabeth, a moiety of the Fitzhugh lands. There was apparently some discussion of Thomas's becoming Lord Fitzhugh, but the Dacres (the recipients of the other moiety) moved to block the proposal on the grounds that they were descended from the senior heiress, and nothing came of the idea.<br>
<br>Thomas's northern interests remained important to him. His first major piece of royal patronage, secured from Henry VIII just a month after his coronation, was the stewardship of the king's share of Kendal, and he continued to purchase land in Westmorland to round off his holdings there. He also seems to have valued his status as patron of Jervaulx, which came to him from the Fitzhughs. But his choice of burial place reveals the family's shift of interest. Earlier Parrs had presumably been buried in their chapel in Kendal parish church, but Thomas and his wife (who died on 1 December 1531) sought burial in the church of the Blackfriars, near their London home.<br>
<br>Thomas [iii] Parr must have been a strong candidate for ennoblement had he lived longer. However, his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21405/', "William Parr (1513&#150;1571)")</script> was created Baron Parr in 1539, earl of Essex in 1543 (on the same day, 23 December, that his uncle, Thomas's brother William, was created Baron Parr of Horton), and finally marquess of Northampton in 1547. Both men owed their elevation to the marriage, some five months earlier, of Thomas's daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4893/', "Katherine (1512&#150;1548)")</script> to Henry VIII. The family arms were argent, two bars azure, a bordure engrailed sable, and their motto <i>Amour avecque loiault&eacute;</i>.<br>
