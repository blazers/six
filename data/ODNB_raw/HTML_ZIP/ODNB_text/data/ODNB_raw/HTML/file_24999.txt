<span class="headword">Secker,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1681?), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious writer</span>, of whose parentage and education nothing is known, does not appear in the published admission records of either Oxford or Cambridge.<br>
<br>In 1658 (or possibly early 1659; George Thomason marked his copy as acquired on 24 March and so immediately on the eve of the change of year in old style dating) Secker published a wedding sermon that he had delivered at Edmonton, Middlesex, as <span class="italic">A Wedding Ring Fit for the Finger, or, The Salve of Divinity on the Sore of Humanity</span>. A second publication, <span class="italic">The nonsuch professor in his meridian splendour, or, The singular actions of sanctified Christians</span>, based on seven sermons which he had given at All Hallows, London Wall, followed in 1660: George Thomason acquired his copy in October. Secker dedicated the book to Sir Edward Barkham of Tottenham, Middlesex, and his wife, Dame Frances, praising their godliness, their constancy to true religion, &#145;when others have sailed with every wind of Doctrine&#146;, and their loyalty to the king:<blockquote>you cast more propicious aspects upon Religion, then ever to think it a friend unto Rebellion, &amp; lookt upon Fear God, and honour the King, as a couple that God had joyned together, and that no man might put asunder. (Secker, <span class="italic">Nonsuch</span>, sigs. A4<i>r</i>, A3<i>v</i>)</blockquote>Both these works of practical divinity were published by the presbyterian Thomas Parkhurst, and <span class="italic">The Nonsuch Professor</span> at least has a Calvinist tone. Both books were reprinted many times well into the nineteenth century in Britain and America, sometimes together in one volume. <span class="italic">A Wedding Ring</span> had gone through ten editions by 1730, and was later translated into Welsh and German.<br>
<br>The religious writer is very possibly the William Secker who was admitted to the rectory of Leigh (now Leigh-on-Sea) in Essex on 30 August 1667 upon the presentation of Charles Rich, earl of Warwick. Circumstantial evidence lends plausibility to the suggestion that the writer and the incumbent are the same men. Neither seems to have possessed university degrees, while the puritan piety displayed in the books is in line with that patronized by Warwick's wife, Mary. Secker's successor was admitted to the living, made vacant by his death, on 12 November 1681.<br>
