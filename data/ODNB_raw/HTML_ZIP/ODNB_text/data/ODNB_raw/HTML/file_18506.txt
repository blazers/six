<span class="headword">Mee <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Foldsone]</span>,  Anne</span>  (<em>c.</em>1770&#150;1851), <span class="occ">miniature painter</span>, was the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9784/', "John Foldsone (d. 1784)")</script>, portrait painter of small whole-lengths, for which &#145;a guinea the piece, or less, rather than lose the sitter was taken&#146;  (<span class="italic">Court and Private Life</span>, 2.144). He lived in 1770 in Little Castle Street, Oxford Market, London, though his occupation took him to fashionable resorts during the summer months. Anne attended Madame Pomier's school in Queen Square, Westminster, where her artistic, poetic, and musical skills became evident at an early age. She mixed colours for her father, prepared his palette, and &#145;put in the background to the canvas, ready for his portraits&#146;  (ibid.). Basil Long notes that she began painting at the age of twelve and became a pupil and prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of the portrait painter George Romney, under whom she made copies of works by Gainsborough and Reynolds. After her father died she was noted to have been the sole support of her mother and her eight brothers and sisters, though her mother's acknowledgement in a letter of 1792 to Sir Thomas Lawrence that &#145;your goodness to me and my poor children has been unbounded&#146; suggests that the painter gave them substantial financial assistance  (Layard, 19). This led to rumours that he had &#145;in the common phrase, paid [his] addresses to Miss Anne Foldsone&#146; but in a draft of a letter he described himself, rather, as &#145;a friend of the lady&#146;  (ibid.). The poet William Hayley, who sat to her in 1788, described her as a &#145;young female genius in miniature&#146; and &#145;a pretty, modest and sensible girl&#146;  (Long, 218). Walpole on the other hand called her &#145;a prodigy of dishonest impertinence&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 11.193).<br>
<br>Miss Foldsone was introduced to Queen Charlotte by Lady Courtown through Lady Cremorne. With her sister she was placed to board with Madame de Lafitte, a Dutch emigr&eacute;e under the protection of the queen who lived in a house in the cloisters at Windsor. When Madame de Lafitte visited the lodge to read German with the princesses she was accompanied by Miss Foldsone, to whom the princesses and the queen herself sat for their miniatures. In his letters to Miss Berry of 1790 and 1791 Walpole had noted that Miss Foldsone was occupied with commissions at Windsor&#151;commenting that they were &#145;not the work of a moment&#146;&#151;instead of completing her commission to paint miniatures of the misses Berry for him  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 11.145). Miniatures of the princesses Sophia, Amelia, and Charlotte by Miss Foldsone remain in the Royal Collection. The portraits of the misses Berry (priv. coll.) were eventually completed and one was engraved as the frontispiece to the second volume of Lady Theresa Lewis's edition of Miss Berry's journals and correspondence (1865).<br>
<br>Miss Foldsone married at St Marylebone on 15 May 1793 Joseph Mee (<i>d</i>. 1849), a barrister of Mount Anna, Armagh, with whom she had six children by 1833. Joseph Mee owned a fairly large estate in co. Armagh, and on his death left a substantial amount of property. In his diary Joseph Farington recorded a comment made by Lady Smith Burgess, a distant relative of Joseph Mee whose miniature portrait Mrs Mee had painted:<blockquote>Mr. Mee had consented to let Her paint <span class="italic">Ladies Only</span> who were never to be attended by gentlemen.&#151;She sd. She gave Mrs. Mee 40 guineas for [her] picture, &amp; that she had 18 guineas for pictures of a certain size. (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 26 April 1804)</blockquote>Mrs Mee exhibited at the Royal Academy and at the British Institution from 1804 to 1837.<br>
<br>Mrs Mee had also obtained the patronage of George IV, when prince regent, and it was from him that she received her most important commission, completed in 1814, to paint a series of large miniature portraits of fashionable ladies, seventeen of which remain in the Royal Collection. When serial publication of engravings from these miniatures was begun in 1812 they were entitled <span class="italic">The Gallery of Beauties of the Court of &hellip; George the Third</span>, an intended reference to two previous series of portraits of court beauties, the &#145;Windsor Beauties&#146;, painted by Sir Peter Lely for Mary II, and the &#145;Hampton Court Beauties&#146;, by Sir Godfrey Kneller for Anne Hyde, duchess of York. The account from the silversmiths Rundell, Bridge, and Rundell &#145;For setting 19 portraits of Ladies in richly chased Frames, antique scroll honey suckle, richly gilt &hellip; with chased coronets &amp;c&#146;  (Walker, 357) conveys an opulence that &#145;suggests that the Prince Regent intended his &#147;Gallery of Beauties&#148; to be displayed in an area of some importance&#146;  (Lloyd and Remington, 190). Indeed the <span class="italic">Ladies Monthly Museum</span> recorded that the prince regent was &#145;forming a superb boudoir for their reception&#146;  (ibid.). Basil Long considered that &#145;Mrs Mee's miniatures are rarely satisfactory &hellip; often the eyes are of an exaggerated size &hellip; [and] her colouring is often displeasing&#146;  (Long, 48) and Walker held that &#145;The Beauties of 1812&#150;13 incline to be flashy, affected and melodramatic, all with large soulful eyes and melodramatic colouring&#146;  (Walker, 354). Compared with the series of full-size portraits of court beauties by Lely and Kneller, Mrs Mee's large miniatures (about 8 inches &times; 9) lack subtlety of execution. In their attributes and settings, however, they constitute an original development from the earlier series of beauties. While some of the sitters' attributes are those traditionally associated with female portraiture others are highly contemporary in their reference to literary, especially poetical, sources. The decision to place some sitters within Gothic architectural settings increases the sense of a move away from the classicizing effect of introducing the attributes of goddesses into female portraiture. In this context the rich and sometimes brilliant colouring conveys an intensity of vision that is essentially Romantic. In addition to the engravings published in <span class="italic">The Gallery of Beauties</span> others were engraved and illustrated in the <span class="italic">Court Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">La Belle Assembl&eacute;e</span>, and the <span class="italic">Ladies Monthly Museum</span>.<br>
<br>Lord Byron sent privately to the sitter a &#145;Condolatory address to Sarah countess of Jersey on the prince regent's returning her picture to Mrs Mee&#146;, which was subsequently published, without his leave, in <span class="italic">The Champion</span> (31 July 1814) and in the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> (1 August 1814). A miniature by Mrs Mee of Lady Jersey, a noted court beauty, was given by the prince regent to the duke of Cumberland and remains in the Hanoverian collection (Calenberg, Hanover). Mrs Mee had earlier painted for Byron a miniature portrait of Lady Oxford, by whose &#145;autumnal charms&#146; he was soothed following the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle of his affair with Lady Caroline Lamb in 1812.<br>
<br>Towards the end of her life Mrs Mee lived at 3 Woodman's Cottages, The Grove, Hammersmith, where she died on 28 May 1851, leaving her son Arthur Patrick Mee, who was articled to the architect Sir John Soane, sole beneficiary and executor of her will. A self-portrait in watercolour on ivory is in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, together with her miniature of William Grimaldi.<br>
