</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Craig, Sir  John</span>  (1874&#150;1957), <span class="occ">steel manufacturer</span>, was born at Clydesdale, New Stevenston, Lanarkshire, on 11 December 1874, the fourth son of Thomas Craig, a furnaceman at David Colville's Dalzell ironworks, Motherwell, and his wife, Elizabeth Wilson. He was educated at Dalziel public school, Motherwell, and in 1888 went to work as an office boy with his father's employers. His energy and shrewdness soon marked him out for further promotion, and when John Colville entered parliament in 1895, Craig was entrusted with his duties at the Royal Exchange in Glasgow. In 1905 Craig was made ironworks salesman and five years later was invited by Archibald and David Colville jun. to join the board.<br>
<br>At this time Colvilles was expanding rapidly and by 1913 possessed an annual ingot capacity of over 350,000 tons, making it the second largest steel making firm in Britain. The demands of war accelerated this growth. Responding to appeals by the Ministry of Munitions to boost output, Colvilles purchased both the Clydebridge steelworks and the Glengarnock Iron and Steel Company. In order to safeguard fuel supplies, these acquisitions led to the purchase of the collieries of Archibald Russell Ltd. Craig played a major role in the exacting negotiations involved in the firm's expansion and, with the sudden deaths of David and Archibald Colville in 1916, he was elected to the chairmanship of the company. As such he was responsible for the further integration of the firm, forwards into the manufacture of sheets, alloy steel, and steel castings and backwards into limestone quarrying. Colvilles' most important product was ship plates and its largest customer was Harland and Wolff, and so when the shipbuilders attempted to secure their steel supplies by gaining control of the manufacturers, Craig welcomed the moves which led in 1920 to the sale of the majority of Colvilles' ordinary shares to the Belfast concern, part of the Royal Mail Group controlled by William, Viscount Pirrie (1847&#150;1924). Although ultimate control of Colvilles thereby passed into the hands of Lord Pirrie, Craig's power within the firm was increased since Pirrie and his successor, Owen Philipps, Baron Kylsant, left the effective direction of this part of their swollen empire to John Craig.<br>
<br>When the boom collapsed in 1921 Craig kept the works efficient, and embarked on protracted discussions with his fellow steelmakers both at home and abroad to try to reduce the severity of competition and with the government to obtain some degree of tariff protection. When these initiatives failed, he attempted to attain the more modest objective of strengthening Colvilles' position within Scotland. The first real breakthrough was the creation of Colvilles Ltd in 1931, the outcome of a merger of David Colville &amp; Sons and the iron and steel making interests of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34555/', "Sir James Lithgow (1883&#150;1952)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51878/', "Lithgow family")</script>]. Together Craig and Lithgow sought to build a modern iron and steel making group by the acquisition of the plate business of Stewarts and Lloyds, the Mossend works of William Beardmore &amp; Co., the Steel Company of Scotland, and the Lanarkshire Steel Company. By 1936 Colvilles controlled 80 per cent of Scotland's ingot capacity.<br>
<br>It was one thing to control the industry, quite another fully to exploit the potential economies of scale offered by unified ownership. Financial constraints prevented what in retrospect is seen to have been the optimum solution, and Craig's own obduracy in refusing to close works at the cost of severe local unemployment inhibited the drive towards even greater productive efficiency. The Second World War and the ensuing post-war boom provided the opportunity for more radical reconstruction, but Craig's deeply felt social responsibility strengthened the more pragmatic calculations of his joint managing director, Sir Andrew McCance (1889&#150;1983), in determining the policy of welding together Colvilles' collection of works. This policy eventually culminated in the creation of a fully integrated steelworks on a green-field site adjacent to the original Dalzell works: the Ravenscraig project.<br>
<br>The life of John Craig and the development of Colvilles are virtually synonymous. Aspects of his policies have been criticized. In seeking Colvilles' domination of a Scottish steel monopoly, his inflexibility of purpose may have retarded beneficial change, and his reluctance to close the least efficient works of the Colville group of companies undoubtedly constituted an obstacle to greater rationalization, but it is important to recognize that he strove always to preserve intact his inheritance from the Colville family and to care for the welfare of the labour force.<br>
<br>Craig's religious sincerity reflected itself in his whole life, according to a contemporary associate, and the eagerness with which he sought success for the works for which he was responsible, &#145;was not so much measured by shareholders' dividends as by the substance and security for the thousands of Scottish families whose breadwinners toiled at its furnaces and mills&#146;  (H. Douglass, <span class="italic">Colvilles Magazine</span>, spring 1957).<br>
<br>Craig married Jessie, daughter of John Sommerville, shovel plater, in 1901; they had three daughters and two sons, the elder of whom became the last chairman of the Colville group in 1964. Craig was appointed CBE in 1918 and knighted in 1943. The honorary degree of LLD was conferred upon him by Glasgow University in 1951. He retired from Colvilles in 1956, having been with the company for sixty-seven years.<br>
<br>During the time that he directed Colvilles, Craig also played a leading part in the affairs of the steel industry as a whole. He believed passionately in co-operation and threw himself into making a success of the National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers, of which he was an original council member and, in 1922, third president. He was president of the Iron and Steel Institute in 1940&#150;42, a member of the executive committee of the British Iron and Steel Federation, and a director of the British Iron and Steel Corporation. His only outside interests were his family, the Church of Scotland, and the YMCA, with which he had been actively associated at Motherwell since 1897, being the chairman of the Scottish National Council in 1927 and president in 1944. Sir John Craig died at his home, Cambusnethan Priory, Wishaw, Lanarkshire, on 1 February 1957. He was survived by his wife, and was buried at St Airbles cemetery, Motherwell, on 4 February.<br>
