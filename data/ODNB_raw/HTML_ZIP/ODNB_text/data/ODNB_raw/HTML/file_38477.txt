<span class="headword">Byatt, Sir  Horace Archer</span>  (1875&#150;1933), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born on 22 March 1875 in Avenue Road, Tottenham, Middlesex, the eldest son of Horace Byatt, schoolmaster, of Midhurst, Sussex, and his wife, Laura Archer. He graduated with a BA degree in classical honours at Lincoln College, Oxford, in 1898. There followed a long career in the colonial service, starting in Nyasaland in 1898 and then in Somaliland from 1905, where he rose to commissioner and commander-in-chief in 1911&#150;14. He was colonial secretary, Gibraltar, in 1914; lieutenant-governor and chief secretary, Malta, in 1914&#150;16; and then came the major part of his career, as administrator of former German East Africa in 1916&#150;20 and governor and commander-in-chief of the League of Nations Mandated Territory of Tanganyika in 1920&#150;24. He was finally governor and commander-in-chief of Trinidad and Tobago in 1924&#150;9, after which he retired. He was knighted in 1918. In 1924 he married Olga Margaret Campbell, of Argyll; they had three sons.<br>
<br>In a career notable chiefly for its cautious approach, Byatt's main impact was in the peaceful transfer of power from the Germans to the British in Tanganyika. The country was in a parlous state after the fiercely fought east African campaign; most of the German settlers had fled, and trade and revenue stood at less than half of the pre-war level. Byatt had a very small administrative staff (108 officers) and as a consequence he left much of the German system in place, continuing to employ <i>akidas</i>, or German government-appointed chiefs. Auctions of the former German estates were held and these went mainly to the British, Indians, and Greeks, though some land was given back to Africans. Byatt said in 1922 that &#145;the future of the country lay in developing native cultivation only&#146;  (Taylor, 58), and this was in line with the terms of the mandate and the Colonial Office's thinking. He established departments of agriculture, forestry, education, and lands and survey, though the scarcity of the staff meant that progress was slow. Unfortunately he continued the German education policy of having a separate government education system, which ignored and competed with the missionary one, and this was in contradiction to Colonial Office policy, which stressed partnership.<br>
<br>In administration Byatt was criticized for having little interest in the districts, where officers were left to their own devices, using <i>akidas</i> or chiefs as agents. However, he replaced the tribute which chiefs collected by government salaries, with Colonial Office approval, as this was a step in the direction of Nigerian-style &#145;indirect rule&#146;. A well thought out scheme of indirect rule, however, had to wait for his successor, Sir Donald Cameron. Byatt at least had some achievements to his credit: he had finally abolished slavery in 1922, reorganized the police force, introduced the Indian penal code, and managed to curb influenza, sleeping sickness, and yaws. The economy recovered well; by 1925 revenues had begun to equal expenditure and Tanganyika was exporting twice as much as before the war. Some of Byatt's difficulties lay in implementing the mandate, the terms of which were not published until 1922, and he faced delays in receiving answers to amplify details. Cameron was distinctly critical of his work. A later historian commented that Byatt was &#145;a narrowly competent man, unimaginative, unpopular, and unwell, but he shared the good intentions of the colonial office&#146;  (Iliffe, 262).<br>
<br>Byatt spent a shorter period as governor of the crown colony of Trinidad and Tobago, from 1924 to 1929. This was a difficult period to take over the governorship, as the colony faced political unrest with an upsurge of radical labour activity, led by Captain Arthur Cipriani, a white Creole who founded the Trinidad Working Men's Association. In a multi-ethnic population of black people and east Indians, working-class solidarity was beginning to appear above the ethnic divide. Unrest increased with a slump in cocoa prices in the mid-1920s, and the Trinidad Working Men's Association pressed for better wages and working conditions, as well as constitutional reform. In 1925 the first elections in the colony were held, for a new legislative council, though the white planters still exerted political domination. Byatt was involved in a crisis over his power to nominate six of the members. He nominated five but left the sixth place vacant until after the election, claiming he wanted to retain flexibility. In fact he nominated another white member to the three already nominated, and this caused protests in the Indian community who hoped it would be an Indian. The Colonial Office also disapproved of his decision but eventually dropped the matter. Byatt did at least persuade the Colonial Office to raise the limit on individual loans by the agricultural loan bank, so as to assist poorer farmers. He retired to Britain in 1929 and died four years later, at 2 Beaumont Street, St Marylebone, London, on 8 April 1933. His wife survived him.<br>
