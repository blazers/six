</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Watson,  Richard</span>  (1737&#150;1816), <span class="occ">bishop of Llandaff</span>, was born at Heversham, Westmorland, in August 1737, the third surviving child of Thomas Watson (1672&#150;1753), Church of England clergyman and schoolmaster at Heversham, and his wife, Agnes Newton. He was educated at his father's grammar school but never became fully proficient in either Latin or Greek&#151;a severe handicap at Cambridge University, where he referred to his &#145;barbarous Latin&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anecdotes</span>, 8).<h2>
<a name="AcademiccareeratCambridge"></a>Academic career at Cambridge</h2>Watson was admitted sizar at Trinity College, Cambridge, on 2 November 1754; there his tutor was William Backhouse. Cambridge offered him both an escape from rural-provincial life and an opportunity for self-advancement. He avoided the idle rich sons of the gentry, retained his north-country accent and plain clothes, and worked hard. He took his BA in January 1759 as second wrangler, was elected fellow of his college in October 1760, and became assistant tutor in November 1760. He proceeded MA in 1762 and was moderator for Trinity in 1762, 1763, and 1765, and for Christ's College in 1764. He was senior tutor at Trinity from 1764 to 1771 and junior dean from 1769 to 1771.<br>
<br>Watson was appointed professor of chemistry in 1764 and held the post until 1773. Hitherto the chair had not been valued, since it carried neither a stipend nor a requirement to read lectures, but Watson perceived it as a way to advance his career and offered to deliver a course of chemistry lectures, though he admitted &#145;I knew nothing at all of Chemistry, had never read a syllable on the subject; nor seen a single experiment in it; but I was tired with mathematics and natural philosophy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anecdotes</span>, 28&#150;9). He acquired an operator from Paris, studied the topic fully, and in fourteen months gave the first of five courses of lectures. In 1767 an unsuccessful experiment led to an explosion that caused considerable damage to his house. He contributed short articles to the transactions of the Royal Society, of which he was elected a fellow in 1769, and later he published his <span class="italic">Chemical Essays</span> in five volumes (1781&#150;7). These are intelligent and lucid but derivative, revealing Watson as an intelligent layman not a research scientist. They show a particular interest in applying science to manufacturing processes and a belief that chemistry could help to realize Britain's industrial potential. Watson worked on the efficiency of gunpowder and discovered that a thermometer in which the bulb was painted with black ink gave a higher reading than an ordinary thermometer. His account of the lime processes used in tar and lead smelting and his work on pit coal shows a particular interest in metallurgy. He saw a need to bridge the gap between academic chemists and the artisans of industry: &#145;a man must blacken his own hands with charcoal, he must sweat over the furnace, and inhale many a noxious vapour, before he can become a chemist&#146;  (R. Watson, <span class="italic">Chemical Essays</span>, 1, 1781, 40). Watson saw of course no conflict between science and religion: &#145;the books of Nature and Revelation &hellip; are both written by the finger of the one incomprehensible God&#146;  (ibid., 1.vii).<br>
<br>In October 1771 Watson was elected regius professor of divinity at Cambridge, which he admitted &#145;had long been the secret object of my ambition&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anecdotes</span>, 35). Lacking the necessary qualification of a doctorate in divinity he rushed to London to obtain one by royal mandate. He admitted to knowing as little about the subject as he had about chemistry and gave no lectures in divinity, suggesting that the obligatory Latin would deter the students. He held a number of university offices, sat on senate committees (the syndicates), and preached and published university sermons. He supported reform of the university examination system and refused bribes while moderator; on one occasion he rejected &pound;1000 and insisted that William Paley should be senior wrangler. In 1787 ill health and a newly acquired fortune led him to retire from academic life, although he retained the regius chair of divinity until his death, paying Thomas Kipling an annual stipend of &pound;200 to act as his deputy.<h2>
<a name="Ecclesiasticalcareerpoliticspatronsandpreferment"></a>Ecclesiastical career: politics, patrons, and preferment</h2>Watson was ordained priest on 28 February 1768. The duke of Grafton, chancellor of Cambridge University, used his influence to get him a sinecure rectory in north Wales, which he exchanged for the second prebendal stall at Ely in 1774; he became archdeacon of Ely in 1779. He was rector of Northwold from 1779 to 1781 and of Knaptoft from 1781. He entered the national political arena on 29 May 1776, when he preached the Restoration day sermon at Cambridge, entitled <span class="italic">The Principles of the Revolution Vindicated</span>. In other years this would have been seen as an unexceptionable restatement of Locke's whig doctrine, but with the Americans on the brink of declaring independence it was perceived by many as a bold support of the rebels. Five months later he restated those whig principles in the university accession sermon on 25 October 1776. He had already corresponded on scientific topics with the marquess of Rockingham, and in November 1775 he assured Rockingham that he had &#145;ever considered [him] as the head of the Whig Interest in this kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anecdotes</span>, 57). In a fast sermon of February 1780 he supported economic reform and condemned the American War of Independence; his support for his old pupil Charles Manners, duke of Rutland, was evident. The fall of the North administration in the wake of defeat in America brought Watson's friends Grafton, Rutland, and Rockingham, to the edge of power. Shelburne, seeking to draw Rutland closer to his administration, offered Watson the see of Llandaff. Watson accepted but understood the reason, observing that he had:<blockquote>no great reason to be proud of the promotion; for I think I owed it not to any regard which he who gave it to me had to the zeal and industry with which I had for many years discharged the functions and fulfilled the duties of an academic life. (ibid., 94)</blockquote>Llandaff was not a great prize in itself but was the first rung on the ladder of episcopal preferment. Worth only &pound;500 a year it was normally occupied for an extremely brief period but Watson languished there from 1782 until his death thirty-four years later. His friends were no longer men of influence; Shelburne left office in 1783, Rutland died in 1787, and Rockingham was dead even before Watson's elevation. The new men, Pitt and Dundas, had no reason to trust or advance this &#145;ageing radical whose vote could not be relied on&#146;  (Brain, 29&#150;30). As bishop of Llandaff, Watson was mostly non-resident but he did not neglect the diocese entirely, making an annual ordination visit and extensive triennial visitations, which he combined with confirmations of the laity. Time and again he was overlooked in episcopal reshuffles, despite considerable efforts on his part to be translated to a better see. His desire for advancement was undermined by a streak of independence that made it difficult for him constantly to please his patrons or to commit himself entirely to one man; if, as his critics alleged, he was a cynical time-server, his thirty-four years at Llandaff show him to have been a remarkably ineffective one.<h2>
<a name="Politicalviewsandcontroversy"></a>Political views and controversy</h2>Watson's contemporaries regarded his politics as inconstant and ascribed their changes to his ambition and hopes of advancement; historians see a greater degree of consistency. In the 1770s conservatives perceived him as a dangerous radical; in the 1790s radicals denounced him as an apostate. His views in both decades were those of a thorough-going whig who hardly deviated from the classic principles of John Locke. In 1782 he defended Locke against the theoretical criticisms of Soame Jenyns but normally he was more interested in political practice than abstract theory. Ignoring the work of David Hume he defended Locke's concept of an original compact as well as his views on the strictly limited possibilities of revolution. The application of those principles to the dispute with the American colonies in the 1770s, in the Restoration day and accession day sermons of 1776, earned Watson a reputation as a radical, though he was doing little more than restating Locke's views at a time when others were abandoning them. He stopped short of outright support of the colonists; he argued that men had an abstract right to rebel against unjust government, not that the Americans were justified in doing so at that juncture. He was less concerned with America than with what he perceived to be the increasing power of the crown in Britain. In the 1780s he interested himself more in the question of economic reform than in the final settlement of American independence. He supported the Cambridgeshire petition but did not argue as strongly for the reform of parliament as he had earlier. After his elevation to the House of Lords in 1782 he spoke and voted as an independent whig and abstained on the crucial vote that brought down the Fox&#150;North coalition. At first he welcomed the younger Pitt but in 1787&#150;9 he opposed him on three issues: the commercial treaty with France, the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span>, and the regency crises.<br>
<br>Having retired from Cambridge to the Lake District in 1787 Watson remained politically active. He kept his London house in Great George Street until 1803 and appeared regularly in the House of Lords, speaking in the debates on the regency in 1789 and the union with Ireland; he made one of his final appearances in March 1807 to support the abolition of the slave trade. The French Revolution dominated political controversy in these years and, like many Englishmen, Watson first welcomed and later denounced it. Its early stages appeared consistent with Lockean principles, and in October 1791 Watson insisted that the rights of man &#145;are founded in nature; they exist antecedent to and independent of civil society; and the French constitution is the only one in the world which has deliberately asserted these rights and supported them in their full extent&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anecdotes</span>, 256). But the French Revolution changed significantly in 1792, and after the execution of Louis XVI in January 1793 Watson could no longer support it. In 1793 he lamented the king's death and the abandonment of a balanced constitution; he denounced republican government as &#145;the most oppressive to the bulk of the people: they are deceived in it, with the show of liberty; but they live in it, under the most odious of all tyrannies, the tyranny of their equals&#146;  (R. Watson, <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Tracts on Religious, Political, and Agricultural Subjects</span>, 2 vols., 1815, 1.475). Watson's immutable Lockean principles at this time look distinctly old-fashioned, left behind both by Burke's conservative idea of the gradual organic growth of society and by the English Jacobins' radicalism. Wordsworth wrote &#145;A Letter to the Bishop of Llandaff by a Republican&#146;, in which he indicted Watson as &#145;an enemy lurking in our ranks&#146;  (W. Wordsworth, <span class="italic">Poetry and Prose</span>, 1955, 81). In summer 1795 Watson argued in two sermons and a charge that it was French atheism, not military might, that posed the real threat to British stability. His support for the government's conduct of the war in <span class="italic">An Address to the People of Great Britain</span> (1798) was the subject of bitter attacks by the Unitarians and radicals Gilbert Wakefield and Benjamin Flower. These led to their trial and imprisonment, which Watson regretted but did nothing to prevent. In 1798 he reiterated his belief that the political principles &#145;on which the Revolution [of 1688&#150;9] was founded &hellip; are in my judgement, principles best calculated to protect the liberty and property of the subject, and to secure the honour and happiness of the sovereign&#146;  (R. Watson, <span class="italic">A Charge &hellip; to the Clergy of the Diocese of Llandaff</span>, 1798, 2). Far from changing his principles Watson could be criticized for persisting in rigid Lockean concepts that were outdated both philosophically and politically.<h2>
<a name="Religiousopinionsandchurchpolitics"></a>Religious opinions and church politics</h2>A student of mathematics before he turned his hand to chemistry, Watson came fresh to the study of religion on his appointment as regius professor of divinity in 1771. He then applied himself not to theology or patristics but to biblical study of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. Like his mentor Edmund Law he soon established his latitudinarian credentials and was critical of the unreformed constitution in the church. He refused to support the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, arguing that it aimed to convert dissenters to Anglicanism not heathens to Christianity. In 1772 he gave some support to the Feathers tavern petition to relieve clergy and graduates of the universities of the need to subscribe to more than a statement of belief in the scriptures but he did so under the pseudonym of &#145;a Christian Whig&#146; and his own trinitarian beliefs were never in doubt. He was more orthodox in his theology than many imagined. He steered &#145;an epistemological <i>via media</i>&#146;  (Searby, 293) and had &#145;a becoming modesty about the possibility of theological knowledge&#146;  (Waterman, &#145;Via media&#146;, 427), which led him to tolerate all varieties of protestantism. In his six volumes of <span class="italic">Theological Tracts</span> (1785), which reprinted twenty-four extracts from nineteen writers for &#145;young persons of every denomination&#146;  (1.v), he included works by a number of dissenters, even some Unitarians, insisting that he &#145;did not at all consider the quarter from whence the matter was taken, but whether it was good, and suited to my purpose&#146;  (1.xix). His aim was to establish the truth of Christianity and defend his young readers &#145;from that contagion of Infidelity which is the disgrace of the age&#146;  (1.ix); his target was deists not dissenters. He insisted:<blockquote>I do not conceive it to be any man's duty to anathematize those who cannot subscribe to <i>his</i> catalogue of fundamental Christian verities. That man is not to be esteemed an <i>Atheist</i>, who acknowledges the existence of God the Creator of the universe &hellip; nor is he to be esteemed a <i>Deist</i>, who acknowledges that Jesus of Nazareth <i>is indeed the</i> <i>Christ</i><i>, the Saviour of the world</i>, though he cannot assent to all the <i>truths</i> of revealed religion which <i>other</i> men may think themselves warranted in deducing from thence. (1.xv)</blockquote>Watson was careful however to use only those arguments of these writers that were consonant with the beliefs of the Church of England; the extracts relate mainly to the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and never discuss the doctrine of the Trinity. The views expressed, if not their authors, were orthodox.<br>
<br>Watson recognized the need for an established church and was anxious not to undermine the constitution in church and state but he believed that the religious establishment needed reformation. After his elevation to the bench of bishops he proposed to Shelburne reforms in the church involving an equalization of episcopal revenues and increased provision for the lower clergy. Shelburne ignored the advice and Watson published the proposal in a letter to the archbishop of Canterbury in 1783. In 1790 he suggested a revision of the liturgy and articles, which included the abolition of the Athanasian creed. Like many of his fellow bishops he recognized the need for the provision of new church buildings to accommodate the rapidly increasing population, and in April 1800 he suggested to Wilberforce a scheme for twenty new churches in London. As a disciple of Locke he was an advocate of religious toleration, supporting the attempt to repeal the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span> in 1787 and praising the religious toleration of the French national assembly in 1791. Originally hostile to the measure, in 1804 he supported Catholic emancipation. Twice in his career he came forward as a defender of the Christian faith: in 1776 his <span class="italic">Apology for Christianity</span> addressed Gibbon's sceptical account of the growth of Christianity in <span class="italic">Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</span>; twenty years later his <span class="italic">Apology for the Bible</span> (1796) responded to the second part of Thomas Paine's deist <span class="italic">Age of Reason</span>, published in 1795. While his rejoinder to Gibbon was relaxed and courteous that to Paine was urgent and anxious; the debate was no longer an intellectual exercise but a crucial defence of the political and social order.<h2>
<a name="Familyretirementanddeath"></a>Family, retirement, and death</h2>At Lancaster on 21 December 1773 Watson married Dorothy (1750&#150;1831), daughter of Edward Wilson of Dallam Tower, Milnthorpe, Westmorland. The Wilsons were one of the most important families in Watson's home county and benefactors of the grammar school at Heversham. Although the Watsons had six children and appeared conventionally happy Dorothy is hardly mentioned in her husband's <span class="italic">Anecdotes</span> and, as his biographer acutely observes, &#145;women do not appear to have played a very significant part in Watson's life&#146;  (Brain, 15). His thirty-year-long close friendship with his fellow student John Luther appears to have been of much greater emotional importance to Watson. When in 1764 Luther left his wife Watson borrowed the money to rush to Paris to support and rescue his friend: &#145;I crossed the channel four times, and travelled twelve hundred miles in very bad weather in a fortnight, I brought my friend back to this country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anecdotes</span>, 28). Watson, who had named his eldest son Charles Luther Watson, was at his friend's bedside when he died on 13 January 1786. The childless Luther left him his large Sussex estate, which Watson sold for the huge sum of &pound;23,500. This gave him the financial independence that hitherto he had lacked and enabled him to retire from Cambridge and, in 1788, buy Calgarth, a large estate on the shores of Windermere, between Ambleside and Bowness. In the early 1790s he built a new house, Calgarth Park, where house-guests included Wilberforce, Coleridge, Walter Scott, and the duke of Orl&eacute;ans, later Louis XVIII of France. Watson became &#145;the leading person about the Lakes &hellip; a joyous, jovial and cordial host &hellip; pleasant and kind in his manners &hellip; overbearing and arrogant in argument&#146;  (De Quincey, 83&#150;6). Watson claimed that he had not wasted his time at Calgarth but had spent it &#145;principally in building farm-houses, blasting rocks, enclosing wastes, in making bad land good, in planting larches&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anecdotes</span>, 240). A friend of Arthur Young, he was soon a keen and knowledgeable landowner and an improving farmer; in 1793 he became one of the first members of the newly founded board of agriculture.<br>
<br>Watson was no genius but an able man whose relatively humble origins required him to make his own fortune. He successfully turned his hand to chemistry and divinity and ecclesiastical politics when his career demanded it and happily abandoned them when that need disappeared. His friend's generosity permitted him to become a landowner and improving farmer and it was as such that he found contentment. But he was perhaps less important than his reputation suggested. The legend of the radical bishop who supported revolution and later turned apostate concealed the duller reality of a consistent, independent-minded but rather old-fashioned whig. Watson had a habit of destroying his papers when he had no more use for them: in 1786 he announced that he had destroyed all his chemical manuscripts; in 1811 his papers on divinity went the same way. It is probable that about 1814, having constructed his own version of his life in the <span class="italic">Anecdotes</span> (a version that frankly exposed his ambition, disappointment, and bitterness), he destroyed all the personal and political papers in his possession; none appears to have survived. In July 1781 he fell gravely ill with a &#145;paralysis of the stomach&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anecdotes</span>, 87) from which he never fully recovered; in 1804 he complained that &#145;the original disorder, which seized me twenty-four years ago, is not removed&#146;  (ibid., 395). He suffered paralytic strokes in October 1809 and April 1811 and endured increasing ill health until his death at Calgarth Park on 4 July 1816. He was buried on 13 July in the graveyard of his local parish church of St Martin at Bowness. He is commemorated in a stone memorial by John Flaxman, depicting his mitre and crozier and five of his published works, in the church's rose room.<br>
