<span class="headword">Conry,  Florence</span> <span class="st"> [Flaithri &Oacute; Maoil Chonaire]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1629), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic archbishop of Tuam</span>, probably born in Cloonahee, co. Galway, was the son of Fithil &Oacute; Maoil Chonaire and &Oacute;nora. The &Oacute; Maoil Chonaires appear frequently as poets, historians, and clergymen in the Irish annals; Flaithri's grandfather Muirgheas mac Paidin &Oacute; Maoil Chonaire was a renowned scribe, antiquary, poet, and teacher. Apparently self-educated, Conry practised his forefathers' arts before leaving Ireland while still young to become one of the first students of the Irish College, founded in 1592, at the University of Salamanca in Spain. There, he developed a reputation for erudition. He could speak Gaelic, Latin, Italian, and Spanish, and perhaps also English. He joined the Franciscans during the 1590s.<br>
<br>Conry was later said to have acted in Madrid in the 1590s on behalf of certain Irish chieftains led by Hugh Roe O'Donnell who hoped that Philip II of Spain would support their plans to rise against English rule in Ireland. In 1598 he may have gone to Ireland on behalf of Philip II to treat with the insurgents, and he is said to have made many journeys between Ireland and Spain at this time. In September 1601 he sailed to Ireland with the Spanish expeditionary force sent to support the insurgents, but following the disastrous battle of Kinsale he left with Hugh Roe O'Donnell, whose confessor he was, sailing from Castlehaven, co. Cork, on 6 January 1602. On reaching Spain, the two hastened to the royal court to plead unsuccessfully for further military and financial support. O'Donnell died a broken man at Simancas on 9 September with Conry at his side. Conry redoubled his efforts to secure Spanish aid, and eventually King Philip III agreed to send money and arms to the insurgents' leader Hugh O'Neill, earl of Tyrone. In April 1603 Conry accompanied two ships carrying arms, supplies, and money to Ireland. However, on arrival he found that the insurgents had already surrendered, and he returned to Spain without even disembarking.<br>
<br>Over the next three decades Conry was probably the single most influential figure within the hard-line Gaelic opposition to English rule in Ireland. In April 1604 he was appointed special adviser to the Spanish council of state for dealing with Irish refugees. This enabled him to channel Spanish patronage towards those Irish exiles who shared his views. He went to the Spanish Netherlands in 1605, probably to liaise with influential members of the growing Irish community there. An Irish regiment had been set up within the Spanish army at Flanders, and it was hoped that it would one day lead a Spanish invasion of Ireland. Conry was back in Spain by May 1606, when he spoke before the general chapter of the Franciscan order at Toledo of the plight of the Catholics in Ireland. The chapter members were sufficiently impressed to elect him head of the Irish Franciscans, a major breach of precedent as this post had hitherto been in the gift of the Irish chapter. He also persuaded the general chapter to assent to the establishment of a college for educating Irish Franciscans at Louvain in the Spanish Netherlands. He fully intended to return to Ireland to carry out his duties as Irish provincial, but was preoccupied for over a year with the new foundation, named St Anthony's College. After securing King Philip's support for the project, in 1607 he went to Louvain, where the college rented its first premises in May. Difficulties in securing enough financial support for the college led to further delays, but by August he was preparing to sail for Ireland.<br>
<br>However, Conry was overtaken by events. Had he gone to Ireland he would almost certainly have relied on the protection of Tyrone, but in autumn 1607 the earl, fearing arrest for treason, fled the country. It was probably on hearing this that Conry changed his plans. On 22 October he met Tyrone and Rory O'Donnell, earl of Tyrconnell, at the Irish college at Douai. The following year he accompanied them to Rome, where Tyrone hoped to secure Spanish aid for an invasion of Ireland, but Spain was trying to improve its relations with England and refused him permission to even come to Spain. The earl's desperation grew when King James VI and I announced plans for a plantation of Ulster in 1609. There was little the pope could do about events in Ireland, but he did feel obliged to accede to Tyrone's pleas that his friends be advanced within the church. Hence on 30 March 1609, near Rome, Conry was consecrated archbishop of Tuam, in his native Galway. There was no question of Conry ever going to Ireland to take up this position because of the danger this would entail, but under his distant leadership the Counter-Reformation tightened its grip on Connaught.<br>
<br>In June 1609 Tyrone sent Conry to Madrid with the terms of a proposed reconciliation with James. Conry arrived in October 1609, but found the Spanish unreceptive. They preferred to keep Tyrone in reserve, in case relations with England deteriorated at a future date. Only in June 1610 did Philip give Tyrone permission to attempt a reconciliation, but by then James's government was committed to a plantation of Ulster. Conry remained at Madrid, where he was granted a pension of 50 ducats a month in July 1610. That year the command of the Irish regiment in Flanders fell vacant, prompting a struggle between the Gaelic Irish and Old English factions within the regiment. Conry was determined to prevent an Old Englishman from gaining the command. Indeed, throughout his career, he bent his influence toward ensuring that only Gaelic Irish were promoted to key positions within the Spanish army and in the Catholic church. He regarded the Old English as too loyal to the English crown and spoke bitterly of how Old English priests had preached against Tyrone during his uprising. For their part, the Old English resented the manner in which a so-called northern clique of Gaelic clergy and soldiers drawn mostly from Connaught and Ulster monopolized the favour of the king of Spain and to a lesser extent that of the pope. The Old English regarded Conry as an extremist and had been outraged by his promotion to the archbishopric of Tuam.<br>
<br>In May 1611 Philip appointed Eoghan Roe O'Neill, a nephew of Tyrone and Conry's prot&eacute;g&eacute;, sergeant-major and effective head of the Irish regiment. Through his lobbying at Madrid, Conry was playing a crucial role in developing the next generation of Gaelic opposition to English rule in Ireland. Although Conry usually had his way with the Spanish in matters of patronage, he had less success with the pope. Here he faced formidable opposition in the form of the Old English archbishop of Armagh, Peter Lombard, who strongly advocated a policy of appeasing the English in the hope of better treatment for Catholics in Ireland. As theological adviser to the Holy See, Lombard always had the pope's ear and had a major influence on the appointment of bishops to Ireland in the 1610s and early 1620s.<br>
<br>On 1 March 1614 Conry wrote an open letter to the Catholic members of the 1613&#150;15 Irish parliament, berating them for their cowardice in voting for Tyrone's attainder. A year later, as relations between England and Spain momentarily soured, he pressed vigorously but unavailingly for a Spanish invasion of Ireland. He briefly visited Rome in summer 1616 to pay his respects to the fading Tyrone. That year he published <span class="italic">Desiderius</span>, a devotional work written in Irish. At some point he also produced two works on Irish history which remained in manuscript and a quatrium on a rather farcical dispute between the poets of the north and of the south of Ireland, but after his return to Madrid he decided to devote himself to the study of the works of St Augustine. He had first become interested in Augustinian theology in 1610, and during the course of his life he is said to have read all of St Augustine's works seven times, being particularly interested in those works pertaining to the Pelagian heresies and the doctrine of grace. Like many other advocates of the saint, he strongly supported the doctrine of the immaculate conception, which he discussed in his <span class="italic">De S. Augustina sense circa Beatae Mariae Virgines conceptionem</span> (1619). His high-profile support for the then novel doctrine earned him the approbation of Philip III.<br>
<br>In 1618 Conry was sent by the king to Brussels to advise on negotiations between Spain and England for a marriage between the prince of Wales and Philip's daughter. Before leaving Madrid, he presented a pamphlet to the king on the persecutions suffered by the Irish Catholics. Once the negotiations in Brussels had concluded, he settled in Louvain, where the Irish College was now prospering. In 1619 he persuaded the college to send a mission to the Hebrides in Scotland. At Louvain he continued his studies of Augustinian theology and became acquainted with Cornelius Jansen, then head of the Dutch College in Louvain. Given that they were neighbours and shared a common interest in Augustinian theology, it is unsurprising that they should have been on friendly terms. However, the claims often made that Conry had a major bearing on Jansen's subsequent theological development are untrue. Jansen had little regard for Conry's writings on the doctrine of grace and did not reveal his own highly controversial opinions on the matter to the Irishman. By late 1621 Conry had completed a work on the fate of infants who die before they can be baptized. The pope had banned the publication of any unlicensed works on the highly sensitive topic of the doctrine of grace, but eventually permission was forthcoming for <span class="italic">De statu parvulorum</span>, which appeared in 1624. It met with a favourable response, particularly from the universities of Louvain and Douai in the Spanish Netherlands.<br>
<br>In autumn 1626 Conry left Louvain for Madrid as a representative of John O'Neill, earl of Tyrone, and Albert O'Donnell, earl of Tyrconnell. Spain and England had been at war since 1625 and hopes were high among the Irish that Spain would invade Ireland once again. In January 1627 Conry presented documents to King Philip IV of Spain proposing that the two earls jointly lead a Spanish expedition to liberate Ireland. The plan envisaged the division of Ireland between the two earls, who would act as captains-general of Ireland and create an interim republic administered in consultation with the Catholic nobility, including the Old English, until an agreed candidate for the kingship of Ireland could be found. Ireland would then become a monarchy under the protection of the Spanish crown. However, the invasion plans were ultimately shelved. While in Madrid, Conry also defended the University of Louvain from the criticisms of the Jesuits.<br>
<br>Conry died at the convent of San Francisco in Madrid on 18 November 1629. Despite his request that he be buried in the Irish College at Louvain, his body was initially interred at San Lorenzo. However, in 1654 his remains were transferred to Louvain and were buried in the sanctuary of the Irish College on 23 March 1654. Eleven years after his death his theological works were dragged into the controversy surrounding the publication of Jansen's <span class="italic">Augustinius</span>. In a bid to gain more credibility, the Jansenists tried to associate Conry with their own views by including <span class="italic">De statu</span>, which had not been censored by the pope, as a supplement to the 1640 and subsequent editions of <span class="italic">Augustinius</span>. Conry's supporters responded by arranging the publication of his <span class="italic">Peregrinus</span> (1641), <span class="italic">De flagillis</span> (1644), and <span class="italic">De gratia Christi</span> (1646). These theological works made clear that Conry would not have agreed with Jansen's doctrines. Conry's fascination with the works of St Augustine was quite typical for an Irish clergyman of his era. The strict, puritanical brand of Catholicism associated with St Augustine struck a chord with many of the Irish clergy. However, virtually all of them, Conry included, combined this puritanism with total obedience to the pope.<br>
