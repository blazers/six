<span class="headword">Knowles, Sir  Charles Henry</span>, second baronet  (1754&#150;1831), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born in Kingston, Jamaica, on 24 August 1754, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15765/', "Sir Charles Knowles, baronet (d. 1777)")</script>, then governor of the island, and his second wife, Maria-Magdalena Theresa, daughter of the comte de Bouget. Educated at Eton College (<i>c</i>.1764&#150;1766) and the University of Glasgow, Charles Henry entered the Royal Navy in 1768 as a captain's servant to the Hon. Samuel Barrington in the <i>Venus</i>. He spent the next six and a half years serving in various ships until, on 1 January 1776, he was commissioned lieutenant. He served in the <i>Boreas</i> from May 1776 and arrived in New York in August, where he spent the next five months in operations against the American rebels. Knowles returned to Britain briefly in January 1777 to be with his ailing father but returned to North America that summer, though he left for England again when his father died on 9 December, whereupon he became second baronet.<br>
<br>Knowles returned to active service when he sailed for the Leeward Islands in the summer of 1778. He took part in an action in the Cul-de-Sac off St Lucia on 15 December, while in the <i>Ceres</i>. This ship was shortly afterwards captured by a French squadron and Knowles was briefly held prisoner. He was soon exchanged, however, and was then court martialled with the captain and other officers and acquitted for the loss of the ship. In May 1779 he received his first independent command, as acting master and commander of the storeship <i>Supply</i>. He fought in an action off Grenada on 6 July 1779, while in the <i>Prince of Wales</i>, when he was slightly wounded. At the end of October 1779 he returned to England.<br>
<br>Knowles volunteered for service once more in December, and went with Admiral Sir George Rodney to Gibraltar. Rodney evidently thought highly of him, as Knowles was promoted to substantive commander of the <i>Minorca</i> at the end of January 1780 and, just a week later, to post captain of the <i>Porcupine</i>. While in the <i>Porcupine</i>, Knowles engaged in several actions with Spanish and French privateers as well as escorting several merchant vessels. He was taken ill in Minorca and briefly blockaded there by a French squadron, but in January 1781 he was enabled by their departure to head for Gibraltar where he remained until April 1782. On his return to England he was falsely accused of piracy and murder, but having successfully cleared his name he went back to Gibraltar, where he served as senior naval officer until April 1783. While there he captured and retained possession of the Spanish ship of the line <i>San Miguel</i>, and in her he returned to England.<br>
<br>During the peace Knowles prepared several papers on naval matters and in 1788 embarked on a tour of France. When war started in February 1793 he was appointed to the <i>Daedalus</i> which he took to North America. In January 1794 a French squadron arrived in American waters, but Knowles was able to evade capture by the French vessels. In the summer of 1794 he left for Britain and took command of the <i>Edgar</i>, a poorly manned and dilapidated ship of the line, in which he sailed for Norway and then to the Texel, where the <i>Edgar</i> lost masts and had to be towed back to Britain.<br>
<br>Knowles left for the Mediterranean in the <i>Goliath</i> in March 1796, and took part in the battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797. Like many officers he came in for sharp criticism from Admiral Sir John Jervis. By contrast the journal of the seaman John Nicol reveals him as a very popular captain with the lower deck; he also received public thanks for his role in the battle. However, while Knowles was at dinner in Lagos Bay with some other officers his ship received orders and sailed without him. To compensate him for this affront the Admiralty appointed Knowles to command the first rate <i>Britannia</i> (100 guns), but ill health apparently prevented him from accepting the post.<br>
<br>Knowles saw no further active service, but he received steady promotion through the higher ranks of the navy, being made rear-admiral on 14 February 1799, vice admiral on 23 April 1804, and full admiral on 31 July 1810. An innovative thinker, Knowles may have made the earliest suggestion for naval aircraft when he put forward the proposal to use balloons flown from shipboard to observe Brest in 1803. On 10 September 1800 he married Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1867), daughter of Charles Johnstone. They had four children: one son, Francis Charles; and three daughters, Louisa Charlotte, Georgiana Henrietta, and Maria Louisa Theresa. Knowles continued to produce works on naval affairs, publishing his last edition of his <span class="italic">Observations on Naval Tactics</span> in 1830. In recognition of his services, on the accession of George IV in 1820, he was made a supplementary knight grand cross in the Order of the Bath. He died on 28 November 1831.<br>
