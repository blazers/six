<span class="headword">Trail,  Robert</span>  (1642&#150;1716), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, was born in May 1642 at Elie in Fife, the second son of Robert Trail (1603&#150;1678), minister of Elie and then Old Greyfriars, Edinburgh, and Jean (<i>d</i>. 1680), daughter of Alexander Annand of Auchterallan in Aberdeenshire. He lived in Elie until his father's transference to Edinburgh in 1648, but little is known of his early education with the notable exception that it was closely supervised by his father in the family home. Although the exact dates are unknown, he matriculated and graduated in the late 1650s at the University of Edinburgh, where he distinguished himself in literary and theological studies. He shared his father's resolute presbyterian convictions and sided with the protester party in the Church of Scotland, which was committed to the precepts and principles laid down in the national covenant. He was intimate with William Guthrie of Fenwick and accompanied his father's friend, James Guthrie, minister of Stirling, to his place of execution in the capital in May 1661. Little is known about his whereabouts or activities between then and 1666 but an entry in the Scottish privy council records of 9 October 1667 reveals that he was &#145;sometyme chaplane to Scotstarvet&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 2. 347&#150;8). The Scotstarvit in question was probably the house of Scot of Scotstarvit in Fife. After his father's banishment from Scotland early in 1663 for reminding Charles II of his obligations to the covenant, Trail became increasingly associated with the covenanter and itinerant preacher John Welsh of Irongray. Trail was back living in Edinburgh at some point in 1666, for he was forced to flee along with his mother and elder brother, William, after a copy of John Brown of Wamphray's proscribed work <span class="italic">An apologeticall relation of the particular sufferings of the faithfull ministers &amp; professours of the Church of Scotland, since 1660</span> was discovered during a raid on the family home by the civil authorities. He was declared a rebel and a traitor by the privy council on 4 December 1666 for taking part in the Pentland rising the previous month.<br>
<br>Early in 1667 Trail joined his father in the Netherlands, where he continued to study theology and distinguished himself in assisting Nethenus, the professor of divinity at the University of Utrecht, in the preparation of Samuel Rutherford's <span class="italic">Examen Arminianismi</span> (1668) for republication. Nethenus described him as &#145;a pious, prudent, learned, and industrious young man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.v). In his absence the Scottish privy council exempted him from the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span> in October 1667. It was probably for this reason that he settled in England in 1669 and was ordained to the ministry by presbyterian ministers in London the following year and called and inducted to a nonconformist presbyterian charge at Cranbrook in Kent. On 14 December 1676 an official complaint was registered against him by the Scottish privy council after it was discovered that he was among those who &#145;did preach and exercise the functions of the ministry&#146; on the English side of the border with Scotland  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 5.79). He is also known to have crossed into Scotland where he preached and officiated at conventicles with John Welsh. He was in Edinburgh in May 1677 and was apprehended by the civil authorities in July. He appeared before the privy council on the 19th of that same month. During his interrogation he admitted to preaching at house conventicles and to assisting John Welsh on the English side of the border, but refused to perjure himself on oath by confessing to preaching at open-air gatherings. The council ordered him detained on the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth until further notice. On 5 October he petitioned the council to be freed from his incarceration, which plea was granted on 1 November on pain of 2000 merks and re-imprisonment on the Bass if he re-offended. He returned to Cranbrook and remained there for an indefinite period before settling in London. After the Revolution of 1688 he accepted a call to be co-pastor with Nathaniel Mather of an Independent church which met in Paved Alley, Lime Street. After Mather's death in 1697 he is known to have been pastor to another congregation in the city for the remainder of his life.<br>
<br>Trail was an evangelical writer and biblical expositor of some distinction. His exposition of <span class="roman">1 Timothy</span> 4:16 was first published in 1682 under the title <span class="italic">By What Means can Ministers Best Win Souls?</span> He made a notable contribution in the Neonomian controversy that followed the publication of the works of Dr Tobias Crisp in 1690. His <span class="italic">A vindication of the protestant doctrine concerning justification and of its preachers and professors from the unjust charge of antinomianism</span> (1692) was a judicious and pertinent defence of the Reformed doctrine of grace against antinomianism, Arminianism, and neonomianism. He also wrote a biographical sketch on William Guthrie and penned an endorsement of Walter Marshall's <span class="italic">Gospel-Mystery of Sanctification</span> (1692). By far the bulk of his published works consisted of series of sermons. His thirteen sermons on <span class="roman">Hebrews</span> 4: 16 were published under the title <span class="italic">The Throne of Grace</span> (1696), which was later greatly prized by Ebenezer Erskine and was the inspiration for his <span class="italic">The Full Assurance of Faith</span> from the same text. Trail's sixteen sermons on <span class="roman">John</span> 17: 24 entitled <span class="italic">Concerning the Lord's Prayer</span>; twenty-one on <span class="roman">Hebrews</span> 10: 20&#150;24, which were collectively published as a <span class="italic">Steadfast Adherence to the Profession of our Faith</span>; eleven sermons on <span class="roman">1 Peter</span> 1: 1&#150;4; and six on <span class="roman">Galatians</span> 2: 21 which were printed as the <span class="italic">Righteousness of Christ</span>, were all published posthumously. It was testimony to his ongoing popularity as a writer that the first edition of his collective works appeared in 1745 to be followed by further editions in 1776, 1795, 1806, 1810, and 1845. The Banner of Truth Trust published a definitive edition of his works in 1975. He died unmarried on 16 May 1716 in London at the age of seventy-four.<br>
