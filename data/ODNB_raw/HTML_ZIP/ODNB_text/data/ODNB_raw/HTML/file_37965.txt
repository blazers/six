<span class="headword">Sinclair, Sir  Hugh Francis Paget</span>  (1873&#150;1939), <span class="occ">intelligence officer</span>, was born on 18 August 1873 in Southampton, the son of Frederick Sinclair, gentleman, and his wife, Agnes May. Sinclair began his career in the Royal Navy at the age of thirteen. His service record before the First World War, a period during which he specialized in torpedo work, repeatedly commended him as a &#145;most zealous officer&#146; with &#145;excellent tact and judgment&#146;  (Andrew, <span class="italic">Secret Service</span>, 421). In 1907 he married Gertrude, daughter of William Sydney Attenborough, of independent means. During the First World War Sinclair served successively as assistant director of the mobilization division on the Admiralty war staff (1914&#150;16), commander of HMS <i>Renown</i> (1916&#150;17), and chief of staff of the battle-cruiser force (1917&#150;19).<br>
<br>Sinclair's first major involvement in intelligence came as director of naval intelligence from 1919 to 1921. In 1919 he was also given responsibility for founding the new signals intelligence (sigint) agency, the Government Code and Cypher School (GC and CS). Sinclair was promoted rear-admiral in 1920, and after a tour of duty as chief of the Submarine Service from 1921 to 1923, he was appointed chief of the secret service (in which he was known as CSS or C) in succession to Sir Mansfield Cumming. In addition to becoming operational head of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), Sinclair also became non-operational director of GC and CS; he was promoted vice-admiral in 1926.<br>
<br>SIS between the wars was a small, under-funded, foreign intelligence agency, staffed mainly by men with a service background. During Sinclair's first decade as CSS, its main priority was intelligence gathering from Soviet Russia. Sinclair himself had a deserved reputation as &#145;a terrific anti-Bolshevik&#146;  (Andrew, <span class="italic">Secret Service</span>, 422). His priorities were changed by the rise of Adolf Hitler. By the mid-1930s the Soviet menace had slipped into fourth place in the SIS &#145;order of priorities&#146; behind Germany, Italy, and Japan.<br>
<br>As the Nazi menace grew, Sinclair's influence in Whitehall increased. He was promoted admiral (retired) in 1930 and dined regularly with Sir Robert Vansittart, permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office from 1930 to 1937; Vansittart described the political intelligence from SIS in 1936 as &#145;invaluable&#146; (then probably a somewhat exaggerated estimate of its real significance). Helped by his immense clubbability, Sinclair's influence in the higher reaches of Whitehall by the mid-1930s extended well beyond the Foreign Office. He won the support and friendship of the two most powerful civil servants of the time: Sir Maurice Hankey, cabinet secretary from 1916 to 1938, and Sir N. F. Warren Fisher, permanent secretary at the Treasury and head of the civil service from 1919 to 1939. Sinclair was appointed KCB in 1935.<br>
<br>By the time of the Munich agreement in September 1938, Sinclair also had the ear of the prime minister, Neville Chamberlain. He was a convinced appeaser, pressing strongly that the Czechs accept &#145;the inevitable&#146; and surrender the Sudetenland to Germany. Sinclair also urged Chamberlain to beware of a pact with Russia, insisting that the Red Army &#145;could do nothing of real value&#146;  (Andrew, <span class="italic">Secret Service</span>, 593). As war approached, SIS reports on German intentions, like those from other sources, became increasingly confused. Vansittart's successor as permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office, Sir Alexander Cadogan, complained that &#145;we had no means of evaluating their reliability&#146;  (ibid., 591). Soon after the outbreak of the Second World War, Sinclair was taken in by a deception operation mounted by the German <i>Sicherheitsdienst</i> (the SS security service) which led to the capture of two of his officers in the Dutch border town of Venlo.<br>
<br>Sinclair had a reputation as a bon viveur as well as a fine sailor. A large crocodile-skin cigar case was usually close at hand, and he had a justly celebrated wine cellar. Even during the First World War, Sinclair prided himself on offering his guests delicacies such as Californian peach-fed ham. He derived his nickname, Quex, from the play <span class="italic">The Gay Lord Quex</span>, by Sir Arthur Pinero. Like his namesake, playfully described as &#145;the wickedest man in London&#146;  (Andrew, <span class="italic">Secret Service</span>, 422), Quex had, until his middle years, a stormy private life. In 1920, embarrassingly soon after becoming naval aide-de-camp to George V, Sinclair was divorced. He had two sons and did not remarry; his sister Evelyn subsequently kept house for him. He died at 8 Beaumont Street, Portland Place, London, on 4 November 1939, five days before the Venlo incident.<br>
