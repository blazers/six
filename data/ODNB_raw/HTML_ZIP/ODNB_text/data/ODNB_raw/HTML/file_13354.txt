<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hinton,  James</span>  (1822&#150;1875), <span class="occ">otologist and writer on philosophy</span>, second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13356/', "John Howard Hinton (1791&#150;1873)")</script>, Baptist minister, was born at Reading, Berkshire. He was educated by his uncle at a school in Old Butcher Row, Oxford, which was founded by his grandfather, and afterwards at a school for nonconformists at Harpenden, Hertfordshire. He was a strictly religious and somewhat meditative boy. Following a family move, in 1838 he worked as cashier in a wholesale woollen-drapery shop in Whitechapel. The degradation of Whitechapel life made an indelible impression on his mind. Afterwards he obtained a clerkship in an insurance office and devoted his nights to the study of languages, history, mathematics, and philosophy. At nineteen Hinton fell in love with Margaret Haddon (<i>b</i>. 1825/6), daughter of John Haddon, a printer; he proposed, and was rejected. He could not have been a very prepossessing suitor, as he had no social graces and no small talk, and was very solemn. After an illness caused by work and anxiety, on the recommendation of his family doctor he became a medical student at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London; during his studies he made a voyage to China as the surgeon of a passenger ship, the <i>City of Derry</i>. On his return in 1847 he gained the MRCS. Meanwhile, at the cost of prolonged mental suffering, he had lost his belief in Christianity; Miss Haddon rejected a second proposal from him on this account, and later in 1847 he became medical officer on board a ship chartered by the government to carry free black people from Sierra Leone to Jamaica.<br>
<br>Returning home in the spring of 1850 Hinton was oppressed by a sense of sin, read the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, David Nelson on <span class="italic">The Cause and Cure of Infidelity</span>, and other apologetic books, and was almost persuaded to be a Christian. Miss Haddon now consented to an engagement, and Hinton began general practice in London at Bartholomew Close. They subsequently married on 17 June 1852; the writer Charles Howard Hinton was their son, and their daughter Ada married the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35202/', "John Trivett Nettleship (1841&#150;1902)")</script>. After his marriage Hinton went into otological practice on his own.<br>
<br>Hinton's first few years as a specialist were strenuous but not altogether happy. He ardently wished to devote his time to philosophy and was somewhat repelled by the necessary commercial side of medicine. Writing to his wife he said:<blockquote>I fully perceive and understand that the part I have to act by my profession is not to do my best for <i>it</i> but for myself. I must make it yield me, in the first place, tables and chairs and a house, butcher-meat and bread, a good coat and a gold watch, and then I may seek from it scientific and philosophical pleasure, moral elevation, the happiness of doing good, etc.. I perceive and assent. (Hopkins, 105)</blockquote>Much of his spare time was occupied in arranging and classifying the Toynbee collection. Thus started his close association with Joseph Toynbee (1815&#150;1866), with whom he spent time on the wards, in the consulting room, and in the laboratory.<br>
<br>Hinton became interested in the theory of sound and gave a course of lectures in 1854&#150;5. About this time he was befriended by William Gull, physician at Guy's Hospital, who gave him the use of the dissecting rooms and later was influential in his appointment in 1863 as the first aural surgeon to Guy's. Gull and Hinton were in the habit of walking together in the early morning before work. Hinton would talk unceasingly, mostly of his philosophical ideas. After they had parted one day Gull was asked the whereabouts of Hinton. He replied: &#145;The last I saw of him he was up there,&#146; pointing to the clouds  (Reading, 465).<br>
<br>Hinton began his literary career in 1856 with the publication, in the <span class="italic">Christian Spectator</span>, of some papers on physiology and ethics. In October 1858 he contributed to the <span class="italic">Medico-Chirurgical Review</span> an article entitled &#145;Physical morphology, or, The law of organic forms&#146;, in which he maintained that organic form is the result of motion in the direction of least resistance. In 1859 he published a little book on the relations of religion and science, <span class="italic">Man and his Dwelling-Place</span>, which was so favourably received that he gave up surgical practice to devote himself entirely to philosophical meditations and writing. Two years later he published <span class="italic">Life in Nature</span>, which was not financially profitable, and with the pressure of an increasing family he returned to practice. He wrote the treatise on diseases of the ear for Timothy Holmes's <span class="italic">System of Surgery</span> (1862), and was one of the editors of the <span class="italic">Year-Book of Medicine</span> (New Sydenham Society) in 1863. In 1866 he published a little essay entitled <span class="italic">The Mystery of Pain</span>, which is probably the best-known of his writings. He then joined the newly established <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/45584', "Metaphysical Society")</script>. In the autumn of 1870 he visited the island of St Michael in the Azores, where he had bought a small estate. On his way there he considered asceticism, which shortly led to such a thorough change in his ethical views that he was accustomed to describe it as a &#145;moral revolution&#146;. The change consisted in the substitution of altruism for individualism as the basis of morals. To resolve this idea he determined to retire from practice, and, to be the better able to do so, threw himself with redoubled energy into otology. Initially in practice in Hanover Square, on Toynbee's tragic death in 1866 Hinton took over his extensive practice in Savile Row. He had extraordinary powers of observation and with an otoscope which reflected daylight into the external meatus he was able to view the tympanic membrane. His wife, Margaret, was a skilled watercolourist and on his instruction faithfully reproduced his observations: these were later published in the <span class="italic">Atlas of the membrana tympani, with descriptive text, being illustrations of the diseases of the ear</span> (1874). He noted that an aural polyp was not a disease of the external meatus alone but &#145;might grow through a perforation in the membrana tympani&#146;. He showed how &#145;molluscous tumours&#146; (cholesteatoma) might lead to death by eroding bone and causing intercranial spread. He recommended &#145;early puncture of the membrane in acute suppuration within the tympanum&#146; and observed that &#145;an important sign of disease of the mastoid process is a red swelling of the posterior wall, which might be confounded with a boil if the symptoms did not indicate a more serious affection.&#146; Hinton was the first in Britain to perform a mastoid operation, hitherto practised only in Europe. He urged prompt surgery, employing a drill with a moveable guard, &#145;enabling the bone to be penetrated to the desired extent&#146;.<br>
<br>Hinton was a prolific writer. In 1874, besides editing a manual of physiology entitled <span class="italic">Physiology for Practical Use, by Various Writers</span>, he published <span class="italic">The Place of the Physician, being the Introductory Lecture at Guy's Hospital, October 1873</span>; <span class="italic">Essays on the Law of Human Life and on the Relations between the Organic and Inorganic Worlds</span>; and translations of works by A. F. van Tr&ouml;ltsch on the surgical diseases of the ear, and by H. Helmholtz on the mechanisms of the ossicles and the membrana tympani, both for the New Sydenham Society. In his book <span class="italic">The Questions of Aural Surgery</span>, also published in 1874, he describes otitis media with effusion (glue ear) and the attempt to insert ventilation tubes (grommets).<br>
<br>By 1873 Hinton's behaviour and speech had become erratic and he grew more and more absent-minded. His disabilities forced him to retire in 1875 to his estate in the Azores, and he died the same year, on 16 December, in hospital on Ponta Delgada of &#145;inflammation of the brain&#146;. He was buried in the English church on Ponta Delgada. Sadly, Hinton never lived to enjoy the pursuit of abstract thinking which had been his goal and the reason why he reluctantly worked so hard as a brilliant otologist. Dr (later Sir) Samuel Wilks in his <span class="italic">Lancet</span> obituary of Hinton wrote:<blockquote>When I say he was one of the most remarkable men in our profession, I feel astonished that he was ever in it but being <i>in it</i>, was never <i>of it</i>. I believe accident alone must have made him a medical student, just as a kind of chance gave him his speciality. &hellip; It was certainly not his forte to deal with his fellow creatures, and treat their various complaints in a commonplace way, any more than it was his inclination to devote himself to medicine with a purely scientific spirit. So far from his being able to pursue a special department of science in the chemical or physiological laboratory, I believe he was totally unfitted for such work. It was the ideal, speculative, philosophic and metaphysical, which occupied his mind. Whatever chance it might have been which led him to his professional speciality, he could not but bring a great force of intellect to bear upon it, and it necessarily grew in his hands. &hellip; I feel that I have not a full conception of his views, and am not sure that I have ever grasped them, for all his doctrines are very visionary, and his writings &#145;mystic, wonderful&#146;. (Wilks, 72&#150;3)</blockquote>Hinton's fugitive essays were edited by his son, C. H. Hinton, with an introduction by Shadworth Hodgson, under the title <span class="italic">Chapters on the Art of Thinking, and other Essays</span> (1873). Two volumes of selections from his commonplace book (printed for his own convenience in 1874) were published: one entitled <span class="italic">Philosophy and Religion</span>, edited by his sister-in-law Caroline Haddon (1881), and the other <span class="italic">The Law Breaker and the Coming of the Law</span> (1884), edited by his widow with considerable help from his young disciple Havelock Ellis, who at an impressionable age had read Hinton's <span class="italic">Life in Nature</span> and had undergone a &#145;conversion&#146; to Hinton's conviction that all life was one and that he and nature were not separate and apart but each flowing into the other. Ellis, while in Australia, had also read Ellice Hopkins's <span class="italic">Life and Letters of James Hinton</span> and had experienced a similar awakening to Hinton's, namely that he should follow a career in medicine. With very little personal funds his medical education at St Thomas's was supported by Caroline Haddon who ran a girls' boarding-school at Dover. Ellis always felt a great sense of obligation both to her and to the Hintons. This was later borne out in his wife Edith's book <span class="italic">James Hinton: a Sketch</span> (1918).<br>
<br>As a thinker Hinton, whatever his faults, lacked neither originality nor comprehensiveness. Accepting from idealism the doctrine that existence is limited by consciousness, he sought in the activity exhibited in volition, which he identified with spirit, the key to the interpretation of the noumenal, or, as he preferred to say, the &#145;actual&#146; world, and the reconciliation of religion and science. Ideas of matter and force, and also the ordinary theological idea of God, must give place to that of universal spirit as the &#145;actuality&#146; of things. Accordingly Hinton named his system &#145;actualism&#146; as opposed to idealism and materialism.<br>
<br>In the moral sphere Hinton believed that as an individual self, man is a negation, a limitation of the divine spirit, and can thus only attain his true life through unselfishness, whereby he transcends himself and becomes one with God. Man has in fact done just the opposite, making himself the centre of the universe, his own supposed interest, mundane or spiritual, being his principal concern. Hinton therefore advocated that the moral centre of gravity should be shifted from self-regard to regard for others, from egoism to altruism or mutual service. This was perhaps a seductive argument for doing as one likes as long as one persuades oneself that the main object is to give pleasure to others. Caroline Haddon was later forced to reveal the true sexual side of Hinton who was involved with all sorts of women and whose justification for his behaviour was that he was &#145;serving&#146; them as an artist in love. At that time (1885) there were rumours of Hinton's madness possibly due to syphilis and even of his suicide. Caroline Haddon confirmed that Hinton was in a disturbed sexual state shortly before his death: &#145;What upset his morals was not his own morbid sexual desire, but the conviction that was forced upon him of the needs of women&#146;  (Grosskurth, 99). This championship of women and indignation about the fetters that marriage frequently placed on them proved to have a major influence on Havelock Ellis. Hinton supported polygamy as did Caroline Haddon, and even his son Howard was arrested in 1885 for bigamy. This last revelation caused a strong opponent of Hinton's beliefs, Karl Pearson, to react, as Grosskurth puts it, with the wrath of an <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> prophet in the face of this &#145;most dramatic proof of Hintonian immorality!&#146;  (Grosskurth, 102).<br>
