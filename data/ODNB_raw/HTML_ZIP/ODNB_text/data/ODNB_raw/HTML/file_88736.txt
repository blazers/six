<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gibb,  Maurice Ernest</span>  (1949&#150;2003), <span class="occ">musician</span>, was born on 22 December 1949 in Douglas, Isle of Man, the younger twin and third of the four sons of Hugh Leslie (Hughie) Gibb (1916&#150;1992), a Manchester-based ballroom bandleader, and his wife, the singer Barbara May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pass (<i>b</i>. 1920). He had an older sister, Lesley (<i>b</i>. 1945). At the age of six he, his twin brother <a name="cosubject_105035"></a><span class="headword">Robin Hugh Gibb</span>  (1949&#150;2012), and their elder brother Barry Alan Crompton Gibb (<i>b</i>. 1946) formed the Rattlesnakes, and began to sing on the stages of Manchester cinemas, performing short sets between feature films, particularly on Saturday mornings. In 1958 (shortly after the birth of the fourth son, Andy) the family emigrated to Queensland, Australia, where the three older boys continued to perform as a harmony group at first called the BGs and then the Bee Gees, both abbreviations of Brothers Gibb, at beach resort venues in and around Brisbane. Their act owed much to the inspiration of America's Everly Brothers. Regular appearances on a local television show led to their first recording contract with Festival Records, a leading Australian label for whom they made a dozen singles and two albums. By 1965 the Bee Gees were voted Australia's top songwriters. The following year &#145;Spicks and Specks&#146; went to the top of the Australian charts, although by this time the Gibbs had decided to return to England.<br>
<br>In London the Australian impresario Robert Stigwood (a director of Brian Epstein's NEMS Enterprises) became the Bee Gees' new manager, and they consequently joined a roster that ranged from the Beatles and Cream to Cilla Black. The Beatles and the Bee Gees became friendly, Maurice bonding particularly with John Lennon, who gave him his first alcoholic drink and later presented him with a guitar for his twenty-first birthday. Boosted by an introductory appearance on BBC television's <span class="italic">Top of the Pops</span> in May 1967, the Bee Gees took their first UK single, &#145;New York Mining Disaster 1941&#146;, to number one. They followed this with a string of further hits, including &#145;To Love Somebody&#146; (also recorded by Nina Simone), &#145;Massachusetts&#146;, &#145;World&#146;, &#145;Words&#146; (later recorded by artists as diverse as Elvis Presley and Boyzone, and honoured by the Isle of Man Post Office with a commemorative stamp in 1999), and &#145;I've Got to Get a Message to You&#146;, as well as several best-selling albums. Their fame spread to the USA, where the group's three initial albums, <span class="italic">1st</span>, <span class="italic">Horizontal</span>, and <span class="italic">Idea</span>, soared into the best-sellers. Maurice Gibb, the most versatile of the trio, played bass guitar, piano, organ, and Mellotron, as well as contributing to the group's distinctive vocal harmonies, though he was often overshadowed by his brothers. Robin Gibb took the lead vocal on most of their early hits, but it was Barry's voice which made their sound instantly recognizable.<br>
<br>Barry Gibb was the first of the three brothers to marry, on 22 August 1966 tying the knot with Maureen Bates. They were divorced in 1970. On 4 December 1968 Robin Gibb married Molly Hullis, a music industry publicist, and daughter of George Frank Hullis, safety officer. They had together survived the Hither Green rail crash the previous year, which claimed forty-nine lives. They had two children, Spencer (<i>b</i>. 1972) and Melissa (<i>b</i>. 1974), but the marriage ended in separation and then in 1980 in divorce. On 18 February 1969 Maurice Gibb married the successful Scottish pop singer Marie McDonald McLachlan Lawrie, known as Lulu (<i>b</i>. 1948), daughter of Edward Lawrie, a butcher, at St James's Church, Gerrard's Cross, Buckinghamshire, and she moved initially into his mews cottage in Belgravia and later to a house in Highgate. They had first met in a BBC television canteen. When the marriage broke down four years later Lulu said: &#145;It was never going to work. We were two spoiled little pop stars each too used to having our own way&#146;  (Lulu, 113).<br>
<br>Disputes within the trio in 1969, and in particular between Barry and Robin, over who should be their lead vocalist, paved the way for Robin's departure. Each of the Gibbs attempted solo projects but failed to find any to give them long-term job satisfaction. Maurice went into <span class="italic">Sing a Rude Song</span>, a musical produced in Greenwich, and issued a single, &#145;Railroad&#146;. Robin issued a solo album, <span class="italic">Robin's Reign</span> (1970), and Barry recorded some singles which failed to chart. Barry and Maurice also collaborated on the album <span class="italic">Cucumber Castle</span> (1970), which reached number 57 in the UK album charts. By 1971 the brothers had reunited to make the album <span class="italic">Trafalgar</span>, which went to number one in the American charts. After a period of relative inactivity the Bee Gees came crashing back into the headlines in 1975 with the disco-orientated &#145;Jive Talking&#146;, a chart-topper on both sides of the Atlantic, followed by the equally popular &#145;You Should Be Dancing&#146; (1976). Stigwood strengthened the group's new association with disco dancing by getting them to write seven songs for the soundtrack of his film <span class="italic">Saturday Night Fever</span>, including &#145;Night Fever&#146;, &#145;Stayin' Alive&#146;, and &#145;How Deep is Your Love&#146;.<br>
<br>All three brothers married happily a second time. On 1 September 1970 Barry married Linda Gray, a former Miss Edinburgh. They had four sons and a daughter. On 17 October 1975 Maurice married Yorkshire-born Yvonne Jeanette Spenceley (<i>b</i>. 1950), daughter of Ronald Spenceley, store manager for a wine merchant. They had two children, Adam (<i>b</i>. 1976) and Samantha (<i>b</i>. 1980). The couple had been introduced by the boss of Batley's famous Variety Club, where the Bee Gees were appearing in cabaret and Yvonne was manageress of the venue's steak bar. Yvonne was credited with helping Gibb to reduce his enormous intake of alcohol, which had spiralled out of control over the years to become a serious problem. On 31 July 1985 Robin married Edwina Elizabeth (Dwina) Murphy, a writer and artist with an interest in druids and esoteric religion, and daughter of Edward John Murphy, engineer. They had one son, Robin-John (<i>b</i>. 1983). Robin Gibb also had a daughter, Snow (<i>b</i>. 2008), with his housekeeper, Claire Yang, but he remained in a committed relationship with his wife, Dwina.<br>
<br>Seeking a change of musical environment in which to make their R&amp;B-orientated album <span class="italic">Main Course</span>, the Bee Gees moved to America, renting a place on Ocean Boulevard in Miami, the previous home of Eric Clapton. The brothers decided to make their permanent homes in Miami, creating their own Miami-based music production company, Middle Ear Studios. Aretha Franklin's acclaimed producer, Arif Mardin, helped to Americanize their studio style, showcasing Maurice Gibb's bass-playing more powerfully, utilizing Robin Gibb's distinctive vibrato, and accentuating Barry Gibb's high-flying falsetto, a vocal gimmick that became a memorable hallmark of the group's sound. Recordings produced during the later 1970s and early 1980s included six consecutive chart-topping singles in the United States. Titles such as &#145;You Should Be Dancing&#146;, &#145;Too Much Heaven&#146;, &#145;Tragedy&#146;, and &#145;Spirits Having Flown&#146; (from the album of the same name, which sold 20 million copies worldwide) were released via Robert Stigwood's RSO label. In this era the only blemish on the Bee Gees' record of musical achievements was their participation in Stigwood's less than mediocre film <span class="italic">Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</span>, loosely based on the ground-breaking 1967 album made by the Beatles. Meanwhile they expanded their recording activities to write material for and produce recording sessions with a range of North American female superstars including Diana Ross, Barbra Streisand, C&eacute;line Dion, Dolly Parton, and Dionne Warwick. In 1987 the international number one hit single &#145;You Win Again&#146; marked the group's move to Warner Brothers. Personal tragedy marred the lives of the Gibbs the following year with the sudden death of the youngest brother, Andy, himself a successful singer.<br>
<br>The three brothers joined the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1994. The Bee Gees sold well over 220 million records by the time of Robin's death (second as a group only to The Beatles), won seven Grammy awards, and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. In 2002 the three brothers were each appointed CBE. Although the group's work in the 1990s was less spectacularly popular, they continued to record until two years before Maurice died, their final album being <span class="italic">This is Where I Came In</span> (2001), a curious mixture of musical styles recalling both their disco successes of the 1970s and the earliest hits they had written in the late 1960s.<br>
<br>Maurice Gibb was widely regarded as the most gregarious of the brothers, a benign, down-to-earth peacemaker, and a mild-mannered stabilizing influence who maintained an equal balance of power within the trio. He died at the Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami, on 12 January 2003. During emergency abdominal surgery a few days earlier he had suffered a heart attack. He was survived by his wife, Yvonne, and their two children.<br>
<br>After Maurice's death, Barry and Robin Gibb made several joint appearances, but declined to appear as the Bee Gees. Robin Gibb released an album, <span class="italic">My Favourite Christmas Carols</span> (2003), and both brothers featured on other artists' recordings. Robin also entered into community life in Thame, Oxfordshire, where he lived at the The Prebendal, Priest End (as well as maintaining homes in Miami and on the Isle of Man). The last few years of his life were clouded by the onset of cancer, spreading from his colon to his liver and lungs. Nevertheless, he collaborated with his son Robin-John on the latter's <span class="italic">Titanic Requiem</span> (2012). He died at the London Clinic, Devonshire Place, Westminster, on 20 May 2012 and was survived by his wife, Dwina, and his four children.<br>
