<span class="headword">Lopes,  Henry Charles</span>, first Baron Ludlow  (1828&#150;1899), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Devonport on 3 October 1828, the third son of Sir Ralph Lopes, second baronet (<i>d</i>. 1854), of Maristow, Devon, and his wife, Susan Gibbs, the eldest daughter of Abraham Ludlow of Heywood House, Wiltshire. He was the great-nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17010/', "Sir Manasseh Masseh Lopes, first baronet")</script>, who was imprisoned for political corruption and bribery. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34596/', "Sir Lopes Massey Lopes, third baronet (1818&#150;1908)")</script>, was his brother. He was educated first at Winchester College and then at Balliol College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 12 December 1845 and graduated BA in 1850. He joined Lincoln's Inn on 5 June 1849, but moved on 26 May 1852 to the Inner Temple, where he was called to the bar on 7 June 1852, and elected bencher on 31 May 1870 and treasurer in 1890. On 20 September 1854 he married Cordelia Lucy, daughter of E. Clarke, of Efford Manor, Devon; they had at least one son.<br>
<br>Lopes practised first as a conveyancer and equity draftsman, later as a pleader on the western circuit and at Westminster. He was appointed recorder of Exeter in 1867 and became QC on 22 June 1869. He was returned unopposed as Conservative member for the rotten borough of Launceston on 9 April 1868 and in the general election of 1874 wrested Frome from the Liberals. In 1876 he was appointed justice of the High Court and knighted (28 November). He then sat in the Common Pleas and Queen's Bench divisions until advanced in 1885 to the Court of Appeal (1 December), when he became member of the privy council (12 December). He was made a peer on the queen's jubilee in 1897 (26 July), as Baron Ludlow of Heywood, Wiltshire, retiring shortly afterwards for health reasons.<br>
<br>Ludlow died of influenza at his London house, 8 Cromwell Place, Kensington, on 25 December 1899, his wife having died before him, in 1891. His son, Henry Ludlow, succeeded as the second Baron Ludlow. Although not a great lawyer, Lopes was an able judge in <i>nisi prius</i> and divorce cases, and an admirable chairman of quarter sessions.<br>
