<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Chaplin, Sir  Charles Spencer <span class="st"> [Charlie]</span></span>  (1889&#150;1977), <span class="occ">film actor and director</span>, is believed to have been born on 16 April 1889, at 8 p.m., in East Street, in the south London borough of Walworth. No birth certificate has ever been found. One of two sons of music-hall performers Charles Chaplin (1863&#150;1901) and his wife, Hannah Harriett Pedlingham Hill 
    (1865&#150;1928; known professionally as Lily Harley)
  , the future film comedian's earliest years were far from comfortable. His parents separated when he was a baby, and Hannah Chaplin began experiencing financial reversals when unable to perform. Charles Chaplin senior refused to support his family monetarily, and by 1895 Hannah's economic situation was so dire she had to seek public assistance at Lambeth workhouse. Between 1896 and 1898 Hannah and her two sons, Sydney and Charles, were in and out of workhouses and comparable public institutions for London's poor. This &#145;Dickensian&#146; childhood had an undeniable impact on the art of Charles Spencer Chaplin.<br>
<br>As a boy Charlie Chaplin knew what it was like to be painfully self-conscious of tattered and ill-fitting clothing, to go to bed hungry, or to have no bed at all. He also knew the stigma of the workhouse. What separated him from other victims of his situation was the knowledge that his family had experienced a glamorous alternative to a life of poverty. Besides memories of childhood comforts and his mother's career, Chaplin was aware that his father was enjoying celebrity, as a minor music-hall star, even while Hannah and her children suffered. Chaplin's dreams of becoming a performer on stage eventually enabled his physical escape from poverty. The psychological impact of being poor never left him. Ironically, Chaplin later used his experiences with destitution to create themes in motion pictures that would earn him one of the highest salaries in the world.<h2>
<a name="Musichallartiste"></a>Music-hall artiste</h2>Charles Spencer Chaplin began performing in music-hall in December 1898, as one of the Eight Lancashire Lads, a troupe of child dancers managed by William Jackson, a neighbour of Chaplin senior. Hannah spent part of 1898 in Lambeth workhouse before being transferred to Cane Hill Asylum because of mental illness. The authorities demanded that Chaplin senior take charge of his sons, and Sydney and Charlie lived with their father until Hannah was discharged from the asylum that November. Employment as a member of the Eight Lancashire Lads enabled Charlie to get room and board, provided extra income for Hannah, and may have relieved Chaplin senior of some of his estranged wife's demands for child support. The boy enjoyed working in the music-hall until 1900, when Hannah forced him to quit for fear his health was being affected by life on the road.<br>
<br>With his mother again institutionalized for mental illness, and his father now dead from the effects of alcoholism, the fourteen-year-old Chaplin used his earlier experience in vaudeville to seek employment opportunities at Blackmore's theatrical agency in London in 1903. Fortunately Blackmore's, which catered not only for music-hall but also for legitimate theatre, was assisting the stage producer Charles Frohman in casting the part of a streetwise boy in one of the first theatrical productions featuring the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. Chaplin got the part. He was able to tour in Sherlock Holmes companies for the next three years, and worked with the two most successful Holmes delineators of the day, H. A. Saintsbury and William Gillette. The young thespian learned a great deal about acting and stagecraft from these mentors.<br>
<br>Legitimate theatre had greater prestige than music-hall in the early 1900s, but employment in British variety was more plentiful. When his final Sherlock Holmes tour ended in March 1906, Charles joined his older brother Sydney as a music-hall comedian in a Wal Pink sketch, <span class="italic">Repairs</span>. Two months later the seventeen-year-old vaudevillian was performing in William Murray's skit <span class="italic">Casey's Court Circus</span> with a troupe of child actors. Chaplin remained with Murray's company for over a year. By this time Sydney Chaplin had gained recognition as a music-hall comedian while working for Fred Karno, the most successful comic sketch producer in British variety. Syd Chaplin persuaded a reluctant Karno to hire his younger brother in February 1908. Charles Chaplin's experience in Fred Karno's music-hall complemented, but was very different from, the discipline he received in legitimate theatre.<br>
<br>The origins of British music-hall can be traced to the singing of bawdy songs in early nineteenth-century London taverns. Over the years amateur singing gave way to organized programmes in which professional performers sang, exchanged jokes, and directly interacted with patrons while under the watchful eye of a chairman overseeing the evening's activities. Despite the addition of a stage and proscenium arch in specially constructed music-halls built after the mid-nineteenth century, most entertainers still directly addressed their audience and expected them to join in the singing of the chorus. This relationship between performer and patron differed markedly from the theatre, where actors interacted with one another while behaving as though the audience was not there.<br>
<br>By the end of the nineteenth century legitimate theatre was feeling the economic impact of British music-hall and retaliated against its competition through legal harassment. Since the patent theatres had the exclusive right to perform dialogue, any music-hall attempting to produce a short play as part of its bill was subject to prosecution. Fred Karno circumvented the restriction on spoken dialogue by having &#145;speechless comedians&#146; perform his sketches. The type of red-nosed comedian in baggy trousers&#151;also known as an &#145;eccentric&#146; or &#145;grotesque&#146;&#151;featured in the Karno productions was a popular figure in British and American vaudeville at the beginning of the twentieth century. These comedians prided themselves in using ingenious body language to establish their characters' personalities, motivations, and reactions. Karno's approach to slapstick comedy, emphasis on mime, and his innovative 1904 sketch <span class="italic">Mumming Birds</span> had a major impact on Charlie Chaplin's artistry as a comedian and film-maker.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Mumming Birds</span> Karno comedians portrayed both the horrible music-hall &#145;artistes&#146; and contemptuous &#145;patrons&#146; who actively demonstrated their disapproval of the performers. Central to the action was a comic drunk, played by a Karno star, who interacted with both artistes and fellow &#145;audience members&#146;. <span class="italic">Mumming Birds</span> was a self-reflexive parody of British variety's entertainments, its audience&#150;performer interaction, and the music-hall experience itself. The skit was so successful that Karno had a number of companies performing <span class="italic">Mumming Birds</span>, both in Britain and abroad, before 1914. Chaplin played the comic drunk in a troupe that Karno sent to America in 1910 and again in 1912. In 1913 he was persuaded to leave Karno and sign a one-year contract to work for Mack Sennett's Keystone Film Company in Edendale, California, for the not inconsiderable salary of $150 a week. Chaplin appeared in thirty-four comedy shorts, and one feature length Keystone picture, in 1914.<h2>
<a name="Silentfilmstar"></a>Silent film star</h2>Sennett's slapstick farces featured former vaudevillians and circus clowns playing variations of the grotesque. As with Karno's sketches, the comedians performed in mime, executing complicated physical business involving split-second timing. Sennett also exploited the motion picture medium's ability to manipulate time and space for humorous effect, often speeding up the action so that the comic acrobatics looked even more frenetic and bizarre. Given the similarities in Karno and Sennett's humour, it is not surprising that Chaplin was able to adapt his stage slapstick to meet the demands of the Keystone films. Chaplin was, however, initially uncomfortable with Sennett's style of film-making and displeased with his first Keystone picture, <span class="italic">Making a Living</span>.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Making a Living</span> Chaplin played a conman in a frock coat, top hat, and monocle&#151;a costume similar to what he wore in the Karno sketches&#151;who by the end of the film becomes embroiled in a chase and a fist fight. A pleasant but undistinguished farce, Chaplin believed the fast overall tempo of <span class="italic">Making a Living</span> and its concluding chase prevented him from developing his character's personality and most effective comic business. The British appearance of this conman also made the character out of place for an American audience and setting. Charles Spencer Chaplin brilliantly addressed all of these problems in his next film released by Keystone, <span class="italic">Kid Auto Races at Venice</span>. Purportedly filmed in forty-five minutes, this was an improvised production shot on location during an actual children's toy car race in Venice, California. In this film Chaplin's character&#151;now dressed in the famous costume of too small derby, tight vest, large trousers, and ill-fitting shoes&#151;continuously disrupts a &#145;documentary&#146; film-maker's attempts to record the event by &#145;mugging&#146; in front of the camera. Though lacking in plot, <span class="italic">Kid Auto Races at Venice</span> enabled the comedian to overcome the disappointments of his previous motion picture and set the standard for his distinctive film style.<br>
<br>Chaplin claimed to have initially been inhibited by the film-making process, but the self-reflexive focus of <span class="italic">Kid Auto Races at Venice</span> allowed the budding film-maker to dominate the medium both in front of the camera and behind it. As Karno adapted <span class="italic">Mumming Birds</span> to parody the music-hall, so Chaplin used <span class="italic">Kid Auto Races at Venice</span> as a vehicle to question film-making itself. Where Chaplin's previous film character was forced to conform to the external rhythms of <span class="italic">Making a Living</span>, his new &#145;grotesque&#146; was the focus of <span class="italic">Kid Auto Races at Venice</span> and dictated the film's content and pace. Chaplin would now make films in which his soon to be iconic screen character dominated the frame.<h2>
<a name="Thelittletramp"></a>The little tramp</h2>Although portrayed in the majority of his early films as a member of the working class, Chaplin's character was soon identified by audiences as &#145;the little tramp&#146;. Rather than desiring immediately to concentrate upon a personality associated with tramp iconography, Chaplin wanted a screen persona that was versatile&#151;a problem with the British stereotype in <span class="italic">Making a Living</span>. While a variation of the vaudeville grotesque, this man's ill-fitting attire was not substantially different from the clothing of the other people attending this public event in Venice, California. What made this figure particularly incongruous&#151;and cinematic&#151;was his eccentric walk.<br>
<br>In his <span class="italic">Poetics</span> Aristotle stated that a figure of comedy is defined by a &#145;mark of the ridiculous&#146;&#151;a variation of the dramatic hero's &#145;tragic flaw&#146;. Unlike tragedy, comedy does not traditionally associate this comic flaw with real pain, although it does create difficulties for the person so afflicted. Eccentric body language, as a &#145;mark of the ridiculous&#146;, was common to music-hall grotesques. But Chaplin's pigeon-toed gait went beyond an obvious comparison with a &#145;normal&#146; manner of walking. His type of movement was an internal parody of the kind of motion associated with the early motion picture medium itself. An inherent deficiency of many primitive films was a &#145;flicker&#146; which prevented a realistic representation of movement. This technical problem with the new medium was soon rectified, but the erratic shuffle of Chaplin's &#145;tramp&#146; was forever associated with the idiosyncratic flickering of early motion-picture expression. Of the handful of true cinematic icons, the oldest is Charlie Chaplin's tramp.<br>
<br>Having identified his screen character and self-reflexive approach for making film comedy, Chaplin spent 1914 working with Keystone's stock company of pretty women and slapstick grotesques. During this time Chaplin refined his character, expanded his knowledge of the medium, experimented with various types of comic film narrative, and developed his practice of having the &#145;tramp&#146; shoot brief glimpses at the camera to suggest a connection with the viewer. Chaplin's Keystone films proved particularly popular and, in 1915, he signed a one-year contract with a rival corporation, the Essanay Film Manufacturing Company, for a salary of $1250 a week&#151;at that time one of the highest salaries in the world. The fourteen short Chaplin&#150;Essanay comedies brought the film-maker instantaneous international acclaim of colossal proportions. In 1916 Chaplin demanded an even bigger salary: $10,000 a week plus a $150,000 bonus for signing the contract, this time with the Mutual Film Corporation. Chaplin's twelve short Mutual comedies are still recognized as classics of their type.<br>
<br>Chaplin drew inspiration as an artist from situations that he initially found far from comic. Having been reduced to living on the London streets as a child, he turned this experience to his advantage at the age of fourteen by playing a streetwise character on stage. Chaplin also had an ability to use humour to confront afflictions that plagued him in real life. As an adult he drank little, because of what alcohol had done to his father, but gained critical acclaim for his portrayal as a comic drunk in music-hall. Embarrassed by having to wear ill-fitting clothes as a boy, Chaplin used this knowledge to costume a character that became a cinematic icon. Initially threatened by the film-making process, Chaplin quickly mastered this medium by satirizing it. This strategy of adapting personal experience into his art, and finding comedy in tragedy, worked so well for Chaplin that he was able to negotiate an unprecedented million-dollar contract, with First National Exhibitors' Circuit in 1917, to make eight comedies at his own pace. Faced with a new objective, the film-maker took nearly four years to complete his contract with First National.<br>
<br>Besides being extremely popular with the general public of 1917, the comedian was now declared by the intelligentsia to be a genius in his mastery of slapstick and was embraced by them as one of their own. Chaplin's tramp was compared with such classical figures of low comedy as Harlequin and Shakespeare's Falstaff. Instead of taking solace from his accomplishments, Chaplin saw a new challenge. He now felt compelled to change the content of his slapstick despite its success with audiences, critics, and those profiting from his comedy within the film industry. The character Chaplin played in his earliest films was a venal, self-serving, anti-social outsider who victimized virtually everyone around him. It was this vulgar and violent &#145;tramp&#146; whose comic energy initially captivated film audiences. But Chaplin was dissatisfied with the limitations of pure slapstick. The comedian wanted to make the tramp more sensitive by transforming him into a kind of Pierrot.<br>
<br>Chaplin had already successfully incorporated the self-reflexive qualities of the music-hall into an approach for making his film comedies. He now looked to his background in theatre to explore how elements of tragedy and drama could be combined to produce films in keeping with what he thought should be expected from a serious artist. Chaplin experimented with mixing comedy and pathos in such shorts as <span class="italic">The New Janitor</span> (Keystone, 1914), <span class="italic">The Tramp</span> (Essanay, 1915), <span class="italic">The Bank</span> (Essanay, 1915), and <span class="italic">The Vagabond</span> (Mutual, 1916). None of these pictures was as successful in creating the type of &#145;tragi-comedy&#146; the film-maker accomplished in his first independent feature, <span class="italic">The Kid</span> (First National, 1921), one of Chaplin's most autobiographical works.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">The Kid</span> an unmarried mother is forced to abandon her baby. The infant is discovered and subsequently raised by the tramp. When the authorities learn that the tramp is not the father of the little boy, played by Jackie Coogan, they attempt to place the child in an orphanage. The scene in which young Jackie is taken away and then reunited with the tramp is one of the most poignant in motion-picture history. Before this film some critics had questioned whether sentiment and slapstick could be combined without detracting from one another. <span class="italic">The Kid</span> proved that Chaplin could get an audience both to laugh at the tramp's slapstick antics and to empathize with his suffering. Chaplin would incorporate pathos in all of the principal films that he made after leaving First National.<h2>
<a name="UnitedArtists"></a>United Artists</h2>Shortly after starting his First National contract, Chaplin concluded that Hollywood's producers were seeking ways to deprive artists such as himself of their creative freedom. To protect themselves Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks senior, and D. W. Griffith co-founded their own film distribution company, United Artists, in 1919. Chaplin's three partners had to provide United Artists with most of its product until the comedian finally finished his contract with First National in 1922. His first picture for United Artists was <span class="italic">A Woman of Paris</span> (1923), for which he was director but did not star. A sophisticated drama rather than a comedy, <span class="italic">A Woman of Paris</span> was well received by the critics and influenced the work of such major directors as Ernst Lubitsch and Erich von Stroheim. General audiences, however, expected Chaplin's films to be comedies featuring the little tramp. <span class="italic">A Woman of Paris</span> did not do well at the box office. Chaplin therefore had to concentrate on making more comedies involving his famous character, now clearly portrayed as a &#145;tramp&#146;. His next features distributed through United Artists&#151;<span class="italic">The Gold Rush</span> (1925), <span class="italic">The Circus</span> (1928), <span class="italic">City Lights</span> (1931), and <span class="italic">Modern Times</span> (1936)&#151;were commercially successful. While some critics have seen <span class="italic">The Circus</span> as a somewhat lesser effort, the other three films have been recognized as undisputed classics since the time of their initial release.<br>
<br>As the intervals between the releases of his new pictures lengthened, the public came to know Chaplin more as a figure in the news rather than as someone they saw on the screen. Not all of this attention was positive. Chaplin first courted controversy when critics complained about the vulgarity and violence found in his early Keystone and Essanay comedies of 1914 and 1915. While still not deemed acceptable with all members of the middle class, Chaplin was generally not criticized for objectionable material in the films he made from 1916 to 1936. A bigger issue in Britain during the First World War was the fact that he became a millionaire while millions of his generation were dying in the trenches.<br>
<br>Though Chaplin films were immensely popular in Great Britain during the First World War, many of his countrymen never forgave the comedian for not serving. This also became an issue in America after the United States joined the conflict in April 1917. Chaplin's studio claimed that the prominent film star had attempted to enlist but failed his physical. The comedian sought to diminish this resentment somewhat by producing short films promoting the sale of liberty bonds for the war effort. He also appeared at liberty bond rallies with other stars, including Fairbanks and Pickford. While Chaplin's failure to serve in the military did not end his film career, his name would forever be associated with controversy after 1918.<br>
<br>Chaplin's first two marriages to teenage women, to film actress Mildred Harris (1901&#150;1944) on 23 October 1918 and to Lillita McMurray (Lita Grey) in 1924, were hastily embarked upon. The first ended in divorce in 1920. He was separated from his second wife in 1926, and divorced the following year. There was speculation about whether Chaplin actually married his third wife, the film actress Paulette Goddard (real name Pauline Levy), until it was revealed during their divorce of 1942 that the couple had married in 1936. In 1943 the 54-year-old Chaplin was involved in a much publicized paternity suit with a woman named Joan Barry, who was thirty years his junior. Two years later the court ordered that Chaplin pay Barry child-support even though blood tests proved that he was not the baby's father. Fortunately for the comedian, Chaplin's marriage on 16 June 1943 to Oona O'Neill (1925&#150;1991), the eighteen-year-old daughter of playwright Eugene O'Neill, proved to be happy. The couple had eight children. Their eldest, Geraldine Chaplin, achieved international success as a film actress.<h2>
<a name="Talkingpictures"></a>Talking pictures</h2>Besides experiencing problems in his personal life, Chaplin faced a major professional dilemma with the coming of sound. Hollywood made the transition from silent films to talking pictures between 1927 and 1932. The majority of silent stars had appeared in their first sound film by 1929. Given the importance of mime to his little tramp, Chaplin continued making silent movies long after his colleagues had made the transition to talkies or were forced to retire. Chaplin did appreciate that the invention of the movie soundtrack now enabled him to control the accompanying music for his &#145;silent&#146; movies. The film-maker wrote or collaborated on memorable scores for all of the motion pictures he released after 1928. Though deemed a commercial risk, Chaplin made <span class="italic">City Lights</span> as a silent film in 1931, and it did well at the box office. Released in 1936, his <span class="italic">Modern Times</span> was the last silent feature anyone produced until Mel Brooks's <span class="italic">Silent Movie</span> in 1976. <span class="italic">Modern Times</span> turned a profit, but Chaplin knew his next picture would have to be a talkie.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Great Dictator</span> (1940) was not just the vehicle for Chaplin's talking film d&eacute;but; it directly challenged a major international figure of the day. Charles Chaplin and Adolf Hitler were born the same year and a few days apart. During his rise to power, comments were made regarding the similarity between Hitler's moustache and that of the tramp. Chaplin loathed Hitler, his politics, and the manner in which he tried to get the masses to accept his lies through his misuse of the media. In the film Chaplin portrayed the despot Adenoid Hynkel, who resembled Hitler, and a Jewish barber who bore a likeness to both Hynkel and Chaplin's famous tramp. Reaction to the release of <span class="italic">The Great Dictator</span> in the United States was guarded, since the majority of the country wished to stay out of the Second World War. After America declared war on Germany in 1941 <span class="italic">The Great Dictator</span> was still challenged by critics who claimed that the subject was too serious for this type of satire. Chaplin became embroiled in additional political controversy during the war, after advocating that the United States assist one of its allies of that time&#151;the Soviet Union&#151;on the eastern front. Right-wing elements in America cited his tactical argument for supporting Russia as proof that Charlie Chaplin was a communist.<br>
<br>The immediate post-war period was difficult for Chaplin, both professionally and personally. His 1946 film <span class="italic">Monsieur Verdoux</span> featured Chaplin as a middle-aged Bluebeard who marries and murders wealthy widows for their money. Attacked as unseemly by some American critics, the film did better abroad. The black comedy of <span class="italic">Monsieur Verdoux</span>, the Joan Barry paternity suit, and the charges that Chaplin was a communist made the comedian a very controversial figure in &#145;McCarthyist&#146; America. In 1952 Chaplin took his family to Britain so they could attend the London premi&egrave;re of his most recent film, <span class="italic">Limelight</span>, a sentimental tale about an ageing and forgotten former music-hall star at the time of the First World War. Prior to Chaplin making his trip abroad the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) unexpectedly demanded that he pay $2 million in back taxes and the film-maker refused. Chaplin had never become an American citizen. While the family was sailing to Britain aboard the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>, the United States attorney-general, James McGranery, announced that he was denying Chaplin a re-entry permit because the film-maker's association with communism made him an &#145;undesirable alien&#146;. It is ironic that Chaplin, who became one of the most successful capitalists of the twentieth century through his portrayal of a tramp, left America because of accusations that he was a communist.<br>
<br>Even when he was living outside its borders, Chaplin's reputation in the United States would haunt him. According to records released from the Public Record Office in July 2002, Anthony Eden's government wanted to honour the comedian with a knighthood in 1956 but refrained from doing so because of fear of retaliation from the United States. Chaplin's failure to become an American citizen, accusations by conservatives that he was either a communist or a communist sympathizer, and his problems with the IRS made the comedian unpopular with the United States government. Also, his marriages to two sixteen-year-old women and subsequent divorces and the Joan Barry paternity suit severely damaged Chaplin's reputation with the American public. When the Foreign Office's American department was asked about US reaction if Chaplin were to be knighted, its officials expressed objections. Relations between the United Kingdom and America were strained because of the Suez crisis, and these British officials were particularly sensitive about doing anything that would antagonize the United States. Consequently any thoughts about knighting the controversial comedian at this time were dropped.<h2>
<a name="Achievement"></a>Achievement</h2>Although a figure associated with discord, Chaplin spent his final twenty-five years living happily in Switzerland with his wife, Oona, and their large family. He scored and re-released some of his silent films, wrote two autobiographical works, and directed his last two features: <span class="italic">A King in New York</span> (United Artists, 1957) and <span class="italic">A Countess from Hong Kong</span> (Universal, 1967). Meanwhile the political controversy associated with the comedian in the United States abated. Many Americans felt that Charlie Chaplin had been an innocent victim of the ideological witch-hunts that swept their country in the 1940s and 1950s. Hollywood, desiring to honour one of its most famous film artists and to re-release his movies, invited Chaplin to visit the United States in 1972 to accept a special Academy award. Chaplin films, unavailable for decades, received rave reviews. A year prior to his return to Hollywood, Charles Chaplin had once again been recommended for a knighthood. When asked for an endorsement Britain's ambassador to Washington, the earl of Cromer, responded by saying that Mr Chaplin was &#145;now regarded as an Anglo-American father figure&#146; whose &#145;matrimonial and political conduct lie buried in the past&#146;. On 4 March 1975 Queen Elizabeth II knighted the 86-year-old actor&#150;director. Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin died at the age of eighty-eight surrounded by family on 25 December 1977, at his home, the Manoir de Ban, Corsier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland. He was buried on 27 December in the local cemetery at Vevey.<br>
<br>In a bibliography published in the year of the comedian's death, Chaplin scholar Timothy J. Lyons identified 1500 books and articles written about this film-maker. During his life Chaplin the man competed with and was sometimes confused with &#145;Charlie, the tramp&#146; in much of this literature. Ironically the corporeal Chaplin continued to make news, and compete with his famous shadow for the public's attention, when his remains were stolen and held for ransom on 1 March 1978. The kidnappers were caught and confessed to the authorities that they had buried the body in a cornfield about 20 kilometres from the site of original interment. The farmer who owned the field erected a wooden cross supporting a cane and a pair of old shoes to commemorate the spot after Chaplin's body was returned to Vevey cemetery.<br>
<br>Interest in Chaplin's life and art continued after his death and reburial. During the 1970s silent-film historians David Gill and Kevin Brownlow discovered several hours of out-takes from Chaplin films made between 1916 and 1946. In 1980 they used this footage to produce a documentary series entitled <span class="italic">Unknown Chaplin</span>, which revealed important information about how the secretive film-maker made his classic pictures. Meanwhile the Chaplin family granted the film historian David Robinson access to the comedian's papers for his major study <span class="italic">Chaplin: his Life and Art</span> (published 1985, rev. edn 2001). The film director Richard Attenborough also explored the comedian's life in his 1992 motion picture <span class="italic">Chaplin</span>, which earned Robert Downey junior an Academy award nomination as best actor for his portrayal of the principal character. Other inspired casting resulted in Geraldine Chaplin playing her own grandmother Hannah Chaplin.<br>
<br>Chaplin biographies continued to be written at the end of the twentieth century, sometimes reflecting a political agenda or an eye for scandal in their focus. The critical reputation of Chaplin's <span class="italic">Great Dictator</span> has grown since its initial release. Critics are more divided in their assessments of the quality of his later motion pictures. The claims that Chaplin was a great artist, that his classic silent films are timeless, and that his &#145;little tramp&#146; is a true cinematic icon remain unchallenged. At the beginning of the twenty-first century Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin continues to be recognized as one of the most notable film-makers who ever lived.<br>
