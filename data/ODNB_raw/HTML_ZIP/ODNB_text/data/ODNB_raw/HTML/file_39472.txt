<span class="headword">Ward,  Arthur Henry</span> <span class="st"> [Arthur Sarsfield Ward; <em>pseud. </em>Sax Rohmer]</span>  (1883&#150;1959), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in Ladywood, Birmingham, on 15 February 1883, the only child of Irish immigrant parents, a clerk, William Ward (1847&times;51&#150;1932), and Margaret Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Furey (1849&times;52&#150;1901). A lifetime spent in autobiographical embroidering means that little reliable information is known about his early life, or his schooling, but we do know that the family moved to London about 1886, and from a young age Ward appears to have devoured thrillers and historical novels, and to have written imaginative stories.<br>
<br>After various false starts, including a stint in a bank, another as a gas company clerk, and a third as a reporter, Ward&#151;who replaced his middle name Henry with the more unusual Sarsfield at the time of his mother's death&#151;began to have success as a music-hall sketch and song writer. He also turned out copy as a hack journalist, and he sold his first piece of fiction in 1903 to <span class="italic">Chambers's Journal</span>, earning his living from this parcel of activities between 1906 and 1909. In 1905 Ward met a variety-act juggler, Rose Elisabeth Knox (1886&#150;1979), sister of the Crazy Gang comedian Teddy Knox, and they were married in London on 14 January 1909. In 1910 Ward published <span class="italic">Pause!</span>, a collection of stories in collaboration with George Robey, and in 1911 ghost-wrote an autobiography of Harry Relph (Little Tich). Encouraged by Elisabeth, Ward published his first serial in <span class="italic">Cassell's Magazine</span> in 1912, using his Sax Rohmer pseudonym which first appeared with one of his songs in 1908. &#145;The Sins of Severac Babylon&#146; (published in book form in 1914) was an antisemitic fantasy starring a &#145;Jewish Robin Hood&#146;.<br>
<br>But it was Ward's &#145;Chinese&#146; creation, the villainous Fu Manchu, leader of the secret society the Si-Fan, with whom he remains most strongly identified. Although Chinese themes had always had a niche in collections of mysteries and thriller novels, Ward's were to prove by far the most successful. His inspiration lay squarely in the unapologetic opportunism of a professional hack writer: &#145;Conditions for launching a Chinese villain on the market&#146;, he is reputed to have said, &#145;were ideal&#146;  (Van Ash and Rohmer, 75). The first Fu Manchu story was serialized in 1912&#150;13 in the wake of the 1911 revolution in China. <span class="italic">The Mystery of Dr Fu Manchu</span> (1913) launched the career of a villain with all the &#145;cruel cunning of the entire Eastern race, accumulated in one giant intellect, with all the resources of a wealthy government &hellip; Dr Fu Manchu, the yellow peril incarnate in one man&#146;  (p. 23). Incarnate in one woman, too, as Fu Manchu's mysterious slave-girl, or later his daughter, supplied somewhat hazily suggestive sex-interest for the works. Ward's villain was regularly killed off over the years, but revived (as late as 1957) by popular demand or at the insistence of Ward's publishers or wallet. The books partly developed with their times: having once aimed to rule the Edwardian world, by 1948 (in <span class="italic">Shadow of Fu Manchu</span>) the Devil Doctor was trying to save the planet from communism.<br>
<br>Some fifteen Fu Manchu books appeared in all, and their popularity was exploited and reinforced in turn by film adaptations (serials and single films) and radio series, and also by a legion of copyists. Most of the stories were initially set in London's Limehouse district, then entering a period when the tiny Chinese community was the focus of sensationalist newspaper reportage and literary &#145;expos&eacute;s&#146;. These concentrated on relationships between British women and Chinese men, on illegal immigration, and, somewhat relentlessly, on opium. The criminalization of opium and cocaine possession in the wake of the First World War focused the minds of jobbing hacks on the possibilities of Limehouse, which was presented to the popular reading public as an opium-addled &#145;Orient&#146; in London's East End. Later Fu Manchu tales were located in the United States, and their narrators and heroes were American too, reflecting Ward's appreciation of the power of market forces.<br>
<br>Limehouse developed as a literary sub-genre in itself and Ward took advantage of its notoriety&#151;and thereby greatly boosted it&#151;writing more particular, and equally influential, works in which drug smuggling, &#145;white slavery&#146;, and opium dens played major roles. <span class="italic">Dope: a Story of Chinatown and the Drug Traffic</span> (1919), for example, was a speedy, factional retelling of the cocaine-related death of the actress Billie Carleton and the sensational exposure of a Mayfair opium-smoking set which followed. Ward's Chinatown fiction intentionally had the appearance of reportage, while his savvy marketing of things allegedly Chinese further extended to his music-hall songs and monologues, and even to the creation of a perfume, styled Honan, which was produced by a Chinese workforce in Limehouse, and launched with opium-redolent packaging and publicity in 1919.<br>
<br>A brief period of war service (1915&#150;16) in the Artists' Rifles (from which he was invalided), and some work for MI7 (b), which dealt with press propaganda questions, hardly put Ward off his writing stride. But after 1919 he made concerted efforts to achieve success in a different field, the theatre. His activities began moderately well with <span class="italic">Round in Fifty</span> (1922), a reworking of Jules Verne's <span class="italic">Around the World in 80 Days</span>, but his mystery plays <span class="italic">The Eye of Siva</span> (1923) and <span class="italic">Secret Egypt</span> (1928) were unsuccessful, and other projects came to nothing, so he returned to fiction writing. Ward had fallen victim to more than one dishonest agent, but still earned enough to build his own house near Reigate in Surrey, travel widely, and indulge in roulette &#145;systems&#146;. Nevertheless, it seemed that he was always having to write one more book to earn his living.<br>
<br>As the magazine serial form died out after the Second World War, so Ward's popularity waned, but he was adept at reinventing himself. His biggest market was in the United States, to which the Wards moved in 1947, having been frequent visitors since 1919. Film, radio, and latterly television royalties there became his main source of income. The Fu Manchu character was recycled, initially for a BBC radio serial, as a female criminal, Sumuru. This led to a series of luridly titled books, including <span class="italic">Nude in Mink</span> (1950) and <span class="italic">Virgin in Flames</span> (1953); Ward's style was fundamentally innocent, and of a different era, but he still made the shift in emphasis from poison in Fu Manchu to sex in the Sumuru series.<br>
<br>For all of Ward's pretensions as a composer of well-written popular fiction, he was never considered to be more than a writer of lurid lowbrow shockers by his contemporaries. His reputation today rests on his creation of Fu Manchu, but largely because it has become a byword for racist stereotyping of Chinese people. The pervasiveness of the figure of the Chinese villain gave rise to contemporary complaints, and even to efforts by the Chinese nationalist government in the 1930s to thwart Hollywood adaptations of such works. Such moves ultimately had little impact on a widely disseminated stereotype, and the Fu Manchu idea easily survived the death of its creator on 1 June 1959 from pneumonia and a cerebral haemorrhage at University College Hospital, London. Ward was buried in Kensal Green Roman Catholic cemetery, London.<br>
<br>As a thriller writer Ward is of little importance. His prose is pompous and ponderous, and his plotting thin, predictable, and repetitious. However, Ward was an entrepreneur with an instinctive knowledge of his market, in the face of rapid developments in popular fiction in the twentieth century.<br>
