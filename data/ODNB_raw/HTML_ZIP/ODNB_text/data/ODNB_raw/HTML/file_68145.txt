<span class="headword">Maitland, Sir  Richard, of Lethington</span>  (1496&#150;1586), <span class="occ">courtier and writer</span>, was probably born at Lethington Castle, the son and heir of Sir William Maitland of Lethington (<i>d</i>. 1513) and Margaret Seton. The family was descended from Thomas de Matalan, who acquired lands in the eastern lowlands of Scotland in the time of William the Lion (1165&#150;1214). The house and lands of Thirlestane remained the property of the dukes of Lauderdale to present times. Lethington or Ledington (Sir Richard himself used both spellings), from which Sir Richard and his more famous son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17838/', "William Maitland")</script> took their title, and by which they were often known, was a fortified house just south of Haddington (now subsumed into the house of Lennoxlove) which the family acquired by royal charter in 1345. Maitland's mother was a daughter of George, Lord Seton: he was thus connected directly with two of the most important lowland landowning and political families at the court of James IV and his successors. Sir William Maitland of Lethington was killed at the battle of Flodden in 1513, and Sir Richard was served heir to his father on 5 October 1513. He was educated at St Andrews (<i>c</i>.1510), and studied law at Paris (<i>c</i>.1514).<br>
<br>Probably in 1521, Maitland married Mary or Mariota, daughter of Sir Thomas Cranstoun of Corsbie, who was to outlive him by only a day or two, dying, it was said, on the day of her husband's funeral  (Maitland quarto MS, Magd. Cam., fol. 132a). According to an anonymous poem in the Maitland manuscripts they had seven sons, of whom three survived, and four daughters: William (1528?&#150;1573), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17826/', "John Maitland (1543&#150;1595)")</script>, his father's heir, and <a href="#cosubject_68145">Thomas [<i>see below</i>]</a>, Helen, Margaret, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68146/', "Mary Maitland")</script>, and Isobel. He became one of the courtiers of James V, but it is not known in what capacity. In 1537 he was given the lands of Blyth near Thirlestane, the estate whose harrying by the English in 1570 he made the subject of a rueful poem (&#145;The Blind Baronis Comfort&#146;). His most celebrated intervention in history is as alleged by John Knox, that he was bribed, along with his relative by marriage Lord Seton, to allow Cardinal Beaton to escape from Seton's custody in 1543. Maitland's instincts for reconciliation, practical tolerance, and moderation would not have endeared him to Knox, and there is no evidence to support Knox's assertion.<br>
<br>In 1552 Maitland was one of the Regent Moray's councillors, and one of the commissioners appointed to settle the disputes in the English and Scottish borders; he was knighted shortly after the successful conclusion of his commission. When in 1559 he was commissioner to the queen of England in the same matter, his opposite number Sir Ralph Sadler described &#145;the old Lord of Lethington&#146; (he was by then a venerable sixty-three years old) as &#145;the wisest man among them&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers and Letters</span>, 1.448). He had trained as a lawyer, and was appointed an extraordinary lord of session (that is, in Scotland, a high court judge) in 1554, and an ordinary lord in 1561. In that year he became entirely blind, but, remarkably, he continued his judicial duties until 1584. In December 1562 Queen Mary made him her keeper of the great seal for life, and also appointed him, with his son John, as factor and chamberlain of the royal abbey of Haddington (in the town nearest to Lethington Castle, and the burial place of the Maitland family). In 1567, a year wholly catastrophic for the queen and for her supporters, he resigned the great seal to his son John, and appears to have retired from court and political life, his judicial duties excepted. As early as 1560, as his blindness increased, he recorded his disinclination to meddle with things of importance (preface to his <span class="italic">Tabill or Cathalog of the Kings of Scotland</span>), and turned to history, genealogy, and literature.<br>
<br>Despite Maitland's age and retirement, the involvement of his son William (&#145;Mr Secretary Lethington&#146;) as a strong supporter of the queen in the turbulent conflicts of the queen's and regent's parties meant the seizure of Lethington Castle and its confiscation. His youngest son, Thomas, also working on the queen's behalf, died in Italy early in 1572. After the disgrace and death of William, following the surrender of Edinburgh Castle by the queen's party in 1573, Sir Richard appealed to Queen Elizabeth via Lord Burleigh to intercede for the return of his house and lands, but without result. Not until after the fall and death of the Regent Morton were the Maitland lands restored, in February 1584, when Sir Richard's surviving son, John, was released from prison and made a lord of session. Sir Richard then resigned from the bench, on 1 July 1584, and as a mark of favour to his infirmity and extreme age was allowed to keep the fees of the post. He died on 20 March 1586, and is presumed to have been buried at Haddington one or two days later.<br>
<br>The Maitland Club, founded in 1828 to edit and preserve by publication early Scottish literary and historical texts, took its name from Sir Richard because he was, as the introduction to the club's edition of his poems says, both &#145;an amiable and accomplished poet, as well as the tasteful and industrious collector and pious preserver of Ancient Scottish Poetry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, [xi]). While this suggests an activity more systematic than it was, nevertheless the Maitland manuscripts are one of the three most important collections of early Scottish poetry in existence (the other two being the Asloan manuscript of 1515 and the Bannatyne manuscript of 1568). Now in the library of Magdalene College, Cambridge, following their gift to Samuel Pepys by Sir Richard's great-grandson, John, first duke of Lauderdale, the Maitland folio manuscript and the Maitland quarto manuscript were edited by W. A. Craigie for the Scottish Text Society (1919&#150;20). The folio contains 182 poems, of which 41 are by Sir Richard and 2 by John; the quarto, largely transcribed from the folio, contains the 41 and 3 more, and 51 other poems, of which only 10 also appear in the folio. The name of Sir Richard's daughter Mary, dated 1586, appears on the quarto, and she is said to have been her father's amanuensis. Prior to 1919 a selection of Sir Richard's poems had been printed by John Pinkerton  (<span class="italic">Ancient Scottish Poems</span>, 1786), by James Sibbald  (<span class="italic">Chronicle of Scottish Poetry</span>, 1807), and by J. Bain for the Maitland Club, already referred to, from a separate manuscript in the Drummond collection of Edinburgh University. The Maitland Club text includes four Scots poems by John Maitland with a number of Latin epigrams, and two Latin poems by his brother Thomas, which are a panegyric on Lethington House and a poem to the eldest brother, William, &#145;On Undertaking a Turkish War&#146;. The Latin poems were taken from an anthology by Sir John Scot of Scotstarvet, <span class="italic">Delitiae poetarum Scotorum</span> (1637).<br>
<br>Sir Richard also wrote a <span class="italic">Historie and Cronicle of the Hous and Surename of Seytoun</span> (1559), published along with his <span class="italic">Tabill or Cathalog of the Kings of Scotland</span>, edited by John Fullarton for the Maitland Club jointly with the Bannatyne Club (1829). A revised and more complete version, finished after 1561, remains in manuscript  (NL Scot., Adv. MS 34.7.74). The National Library of Scotland manuscript used by the Maitland Club  (NL Scot., Adv. MS 31.2.2(1)) also contains what appears to be Sir Richard's legal casebook, compiled between 1550 and 1565, &#145;Practiques of new [laws of Scotland] wharoff the caisses hes not been frequent&#146;.<br>
<br>Sir Richard's son <a name="cosubject_68145"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Maitland</span>  (<em>c.</em>1548&#150;1572)<span class="occ"></span>, already referred to, seems to have been at least as brilliant as his brothers; he matriculated at St Mary's College, St Andrews, in 1559 (and was probably therefore born about 1548) and later studied at Paris. George Buchanan made him the prolocutor in his <span class="italic">De jure regni apud Scotos</span> of 1579, and he was credited by his contemporaries with the authorship of an anonymous pasquinade satirizing the Regent Moray and his advisers after Moray's assassination (1570). He acted as a courier for the queen's party, and died in north Italy early in 1572 while on his way to Rome with the Jesuit Thomas Smeaton. An account of his life has been written by W. S. McKechnie.<br>
