<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mathews,  Charles James</span>  (1803&#150;1878), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18329/', "Charles Mathews (1776&#150;1835)")</script> and his second wife, Anne Jackson (<i>d</i>. 1869), was born in Basnett Street, Liverpool, on 26 December 1803, and baptized at St Helen's Church, York.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>After attending preliminary schools at Hackney and Fulham, Mathews went to Merchant Taylors', where he boarded with Thomas Cherry, the headmaster, who is said to have taken a strong dislike to him. He was then moved to a private school on Clapham Common kept by the lexicographer Charles Richardson, where he formed friendships with John Mitchell Kemble and Julian Young, and was one of Richardson's assistants in copying extracts for his <span class="italic">New English Dictionary</span>. On 4 May 1819 he was articled to Augustus Pugin as an architect, and designed the picture gallery for his father's cottage in Kentish Town, where he later met Byron, Scott, Moore, Coleridge, Lamb, Leigh Hunt, and other men of eminence. In company with his master he visited York, Oxford, and various provincial towns, executing sketches, some of which were inserted in architectural works.<br>
<br>A visit with Pugin to Paris, in which Mathews saw the principal French comedians, fostered a lurking disposition towards the stage. After his return he made his first appearance as an amateur, under the name of M. Perlet, at the Lyceum Theatre on 26 April 1822, playing Dorival, a comedian in <span class="italic">Le com&eacute;dien d'&eacute;tampes</span> (a French piece subsequently adapted by him under the title <span class="italic">He would be an Actor</span>), singing a song as M. &Eacute;mile of the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Porte St Martin. He also acted under his own name as Werther in <span class="italic">The Sorrows of Werther</span>, by John Poole, in which his mother took the part of Charlotte. His imitations of French actors were received with much favour. His father urged him to adopt the stage, but he liked his profession. When his articles expired he refused a renewed invitation to join the architect John Nash, and went instead in 1823 to Ireland to build a house for Lord Blessington at Mountjoy Forest, co. Tyrone. Very little progress, or none at all, was made with the scheme. Mathews remained hunting, shooting, and fishing, and discussing details of the house, never to be built, and then accepted an invitation from his patron to accompany him to Italy. In Naples he stayed a year at the Palazzo Belvedere, where the party included his host and hostess, Miss Power, the sister of Lady Blessington, and Count D'Orsay, with whom he had a misunderstanding almost leading to a duel. His imitations of Italian life and manners were the delight of a fashionable world, English and foreign.<h2>
<a name="Becomingaprofessionalactor"></a>Becoming a professional actor</h2>After a couple of years spent in Wales as architect to a Welsh iron and coal company at Coed-talon, Flintshire, where he built Hartsheath Hall, an inn, a bridge, and some cottages, Mathews was employed by Nash, but kept on an office in Parliament Street as a practising architect. He occupied his leisure time in writing songs for his father's &#145;At Homes&#146; and trifling pieces for the theatre, including <span class="italic">Pongwong</span> and <span class="italic">The Court Jesters</span>. On 30 April 1827, in company with D'Egville, he started once more, on an allowance from his father, for Italy. They visited Milan, Venice, and Florence, where Mathews caught smallpox. At the Palazzo San Clementi, Mathews played comic characters, such as Peter in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, Launcelot Gobbo, and Falstaff in <span class="italic">1 Henry IV</span>, at Lord Normanby's private theatre. From Rome, where Mathews suffered much from malaria, they returned to Venice, and at the close of 1830 Mathews arrived back in England on crutches. The next five years of desultory life, financed by his father, were spent in visiting the houses of noblemen and the like. His father's financial collapse forced him to accept the post of district surveyor at Bow, but this did not last long.<br>
<br>The death in 1835 of Mathews's father put an end to this idle career, and on 28 September 1835 he turned his attention seriously to the theatre: in conjunction with Frederick Yates, his father's partner, he opened the Adelphi Theatre. The first piece was <span class="italic">Mandrin</span>, an adaptation by Mathews of a well-known French melodrama. But the speculation failed, and Mathews retired from management. On 6 November 1835 he appeared at the Olympic in his own piece <span class="italic">The Humpbacked Lover</span>, in which he played George Rattleton, and in a farce by Leman Rede, <span class="italic">The Old and Young Stagers</span>&#151;John Liston, who recited a prologue, being the old stager, and Mathews the young. His performance was fashionable, though his success was not triumphant.<h2>
<a name="Marriageandthestage"></a>Marriage and the stage</h2>On 11 January 1836 Mathews joined Madame Vestris [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18331/', "Vestris, Lucia Elizabeth (1797&#150;1856)")</script>] at the Olympic in <span class="italic">One Hour</span>; this was the beginning of a celebrated partnership. In their production of <span class="italic">The Old and Young Stagers</span>, their desire for authenticity led them to place carpets in the rooms on stage for the first time in any theatre. On 18 July 1838, at Kensington church, the couple were married, primarily to placate American sentiment before their forthcoming tour of the USA. None the less, the visit was unsuccessful. Mathews then reappeared at the Olympic in his own <span class="italic">Patter versus Clatter</span>, which remained a favourite piece. On 30 September 1839 Mathews and his wife opened at Covent Garden with an elaborate, but unsuccessful, revival of <span class="italic">Love's Labour's Lost</span>; the company included Robert Keeley, George Bartley, Louisa Nisbett, and Anne Humby. <span class="italic">Love</span> by Sheridan Knowles followed, introducing Ellen Tree (later Mrs Charles Kean), with little better result, and Mathews found himself involved in debts from which he was unable to free himself. <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>, with William Harrison as Macheath and Madame Vestris as Lucy Lockett, was more successful, and <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>, with Mathews as Slender and Mrs Nisbett and Madame Vestris as the wives, proved a draw. During the period in which he held possession of Covent Garden, Mathews produced more than a hundred plays, operas, interludes, farces, melodramas, and pantomimes, including <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>, given seventy times. Among the novelties were Leigh Hunt's <span class="italic">A Legend of Florence</span> (7 February 1840), performed thirteen times; <span class="italic">The Baronet</span>, a comedy by Haynes Bayly, hissed from the stage; <span class="italic">The Bride of Messina</span> (subsequently known as <span class="italic">John of Procida</span>), by Sheridan Knowles (19 September 1840); <span class="italic">The Greek Boy</span>, a musical afterpiece by Samuel Lover; Boucicault's <span class="italic">London Assurance</span>, in which Mathews played Dazzle; Knowles's <span class="italic">Old Maids</span>, a failure; and several farces, some of them (including <span class="italic">You Can't Marry your Grandmother</span>) his own works. Charles Kemble accepted an engagement and performed at the theatre. On 2 November 1841 Adelaide Kemble appeared as Bellini's Norma, with a success that drew the attention of the proprietors, who pressed Mathews for arrears of rent, and so sealed his ruin. He had incurred many debts and was paying 60 per cent interest, often borrowing from one to make a payment to another. His management finished on 30 April 1842. Arrested for debt and declared bankrupt, he was released under conditions with regard to his creditors that deprived him of all chance of shaking off the burden. A flight to Paris was followed by a fresh bankruptcy.<br>
<br>In October 1842 Mathews and his wife were engaged for Drury Lane by W. C. Macready, but they soon quarrelled with him, and transferred their services to the Haymarket. There they appeared on 14 November 1842, respectively as Charles Surface and Lady Teazle. On 29 August 1843 Mathews made a great hit as Giles in Planch&eacute;'s <span class="italic">Who's your Friend?</span>, and on 6 February 1844 a still greater success as Sir Charles Coldstream in Boucicault's <span class="italic">Used up</span>. On 22 February 1843 Mathews, with his wife, made his first appearance in Edinburgh, playing Mr Charles Swiftly in <span class="italic">One Hour</span> and in <span class="italic">Patter versus Clatter</span>. Because of a failed tour of Ireland as a result of the potato losses there, on 8 May 1845 he again found himself in the bankruptcy court, for &pound;28,000. After performing at the Surrey and at the Princess's, and in various provincial towns, Mathews opened at the Lyceum on 18 October 1847 with <span class="italic">The Light Dragoons</span>, <span class="italic">The Two Queens</span>, and <span class="italic">The Pride of the Market</span>. For seven years the theatre was remuneratively conducted, but without enabling Mathews to get free from debt, and he gave it up on 24 March 1855. The next season saw him in his usual roles at Drury Lane. While playing in the provinces, he was arrested for bad debt on 4 July 1856 and imprisoned in Lancaster Castle.<h2>
<a name="Secondmarriageandfurtherstagecareer"></a>Second marriage and further stage career</h2>On 8 August 1856 Mathews's wife died. A year later, after playing at Drury Lane, where he was acting-manager, he revisited America. There he met and married in 1857 his second wife, Mrs Elizabeth (Lizzie) Davenport, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jackson (<i>d</i>. 1899), who, formerly married to William West, was also known as Lizzie Weston; she was an actress at Burton's Theatre, New York. He played for sixty nights at Burton's Theatre, the longest star performance ever known in New York at that time. In October 1858, with his wife as Lady Gay Spanker, he reappeared at the Haymarket as Dazzle in <span class="italic">London Assurance</span>. He performed a round of his favourite characters, including, for the first time, Paul Pry, and Goldfinch in Thomas Holcroft's <span class="italic">The Road to Ruin</span>. In 1860&#150;61 he was again at Drury Lane, where he played Will Wander in a wild melodrama adapted by himself and called <span class="italic">The Savannah</span>, and on 25 November 1861 he appeared with his wife at the concert room (then called the Bijou Theatre) in Her Majesty's Theatre in an entertainment called <span class="italic">Mr and Mrs Mathews at Home</span>, illustrated by pictures by John O'Connor, from sketches by Mathews. <span class="italic">My Wife and I</span> and a burlesque by H. J. Byron, <span class="italic">The Sensation Fork, or, The Maiden, the Maniac, and the Midnight Murderers</span> were also given. In 1863 Mathews was again at the Haymarket, and the same year he played in Paris, at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre des Vari&eacute;t&eacute;s, in <span class="italic">Un Anglais timide</span>, his own French version of W. B. Jerrold's <span class="italic">Cool as a Cucumber</span>. This experiment was repeated in the autumn of 1865, when, at the Vaudeville, he played in <span class="italic">L'homme blas&eacute;</span> (<span class="italic">Used up</span>). Both engagements were successful but were not renewed, though Mathews in July 1867 played <span class="italic">Un Anglais timide</span> at the St James's, for the benefit of Ravel, and gave <span class="italic">Cool as a Cucumber</span> the same night at the Olympic. Between these performances, Mathews had acted at the St James's in <span class="italic">Woodcock's Little Game</span> and in <span class="italic">Adventures of a Love-Letter</span>, his own adaptation of Sardou's <span class="italic">Pattes de mouche</span>. A scheme for a journey round the world led to a benefit at Covent Garden on 4 January 1870, in which, in scenes from various plays, the principal actors of the day took part. Mathews himself played his favourite character of Puff in the second act of <span class="italic">The Critic</span>, with Mrs Mathews appearing as Tilburina.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsdeathandreputation"></a>Final years, death, and reputation</h2>On 9 April 1870 Mathews made his first appearance at the Theatre Royal, Melbourne, in <span class="italic">Patter versus Clatter</span> and <span class="italic">Married for Money</span>. Various parts were played, and Ballarat, Sydney, and Adelaide were visited. The Australian trip ended on 31 January 1871, when Mathews set sail for Auckland. He performed <span class="italic">Used up</span> and <span class="italic">Cool as a Cucumber</span> at 11 a.m. on 7 February and sailed three hours later for Honolulu, where he acted for one night. On the 12th he arrived at San Francisco, where he performed for one week, then proceeded to New York and fulfilled a six-week engagement. A tour in the United States and Canada followed, and on 1 June 1872 he took his farewell of America at Wallack's Theatre, New York, as Sir Simon Simple in H. J. Byron's <span class="italic">Not such a Fool as he Looks</span>.<br>
<br>On 7 October 1872 Mathews appeared at the Gaiety Theatre, London, in <span class="italic">A Curious Case</span> and <span class="italic">The Critic</span>. A second engagement at the same house began on 26 May 1873, and a third on 29 September of the same year. In 1874 he was again at the Gaiety, and on 13 September 1875 produced there his own adaptation <span class="italic">My Awful Dad</span> (<span class="italic">Un p&egrave;re prodigue</span>). This was his last new part. The periods between these performances were spent in the provinces. In November 1875 he went to India, and played at Calcutta before the prince of Wales. In 1876 he was again at the Gaiety, and in 1877 at the Op&eacute;ra Comique, where, in Samuel Foote's <span class="italic">The Liar</span> and G. H. Lewes's <span class="italic">The Cosy Couple</span>, he reappeared on 2 June 1877. The following year he started on a provincial tour with a company under the management of Sarah Thorne. On 8 June he made his last appearance, playing at Stalybridge in <span class="italic">My Awful Dad</span>. He died on 24 June 1878 at the Queen's Hotel in Manchester. His body was moved to 59 Belgrave Road, his last London residence, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery on 29 June.<br>
<br>Mathews played some 240 characters, very many of them in his own pieces. His most conspicuous successes were obtained in light comedy and farce; passion and pathos seemed wholly alien to his nature. He was, within limits, an admirable comedian. In his early days he was a model of grace, brightness, and elegance. George H. Lewes tells how the youth of the day were wont to worship him, and says of his Affable Hawk in <span class="italic">The Game of Speculation</span> that its artistic merit was so great &#145;that it almost became an offence against morality, by investing a swindler with irresistible charms, and making the very audacity of deceit a source of pleasurable sympathy&#146;. Lewes owns, however, that Mathews was &#145;utterly powerless in the manifestation of all the powerful emotions: rage, scorn, pathos, dignity, vindictiveness, tenderness, and wild mirth are all beyond his means. He cannot even laugh with animal heartiness. He sparkles; he never explodes.&#146; Mathews had, however, airiness, finesse, aplomb, and, in spite of an occasional tendency to jauntiness, repose and good breeding, and he possessed powers of observation and gifts of mimicry. His popularity was indescribable, and at times embarrassing. His frequent imprisonment and the class of parts he played gained him a character he did not wholly deserve of &#145;a gay dog&#146;. He was not at all the reckless character popularly supposed, and was a little shy in the presence of strangers.<br>
<br>Of Mathews's plays, mostly adaptations, no full catalogue seems to be in existence. A list of his own pieces and of those in which he had appeared constitutes an appendix to Charles Dickens's <span class="italic">Life of Charles James Mathews</span> (1879). Such of the plays as are printed are included in T. H. Lacy's <span class="roman">Acting Edition</span> and Benjamin Webster's <span class="italic">Acting National Drama</span>. The British Museum collection is meagre. In <span class="italic">The Chain of Events</span>, a drama in eight acts, Mathews collaborated with Slingsby Lawrence (Lewes). With the exception of this piece and <span class="italic">The Savannah</span>, a four-act melodrama, his plays were generally in three acts or fewer. His three-act pieces included <span class="italic">Black Domino</span>, <span class="italic">Dead for a Ducat</span>, and <span class="italic">Soft Sex</span>. In two acts are <span class="italic">Aggravating Sam</span>, <span class="italic">Impudent Puppy</span>, <span class="italic">Kill Him Again</span>, and <span class="italic">Who Killed Cock Robin?</span> He wrote many one-act pieces, including <span class="italic">Cherry and Blue</span>, <span class="italic">His Excellency</span>, <span class="italic">Little Toddlekins</span>, <span class="italic">Mathews &amp; Co.</span>, <span class="italic">Methinks I see my Father</span>, <span class="italic">My Mother's Maid</span>, and <span class="italic">Paul Pry Married and Settled</span>. Many of these are trifles, intended to serve a temporary purpose, and most have been long forgotten. Mathews also collaborated on a large number of works, and translated plays both from and into French.<br>
