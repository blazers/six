<span class="headword">Therry,  John Joseph</span>  (1790&#150;1864), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, son of John Therry and his wife, Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Connolly, was born at Cork. He was educated privately and at St Patrick's College, Carlow, under Dr Doyle. Ordained priest in 1815, he was assigned to parochial work in Dublin, and then in Cork, where he became secretary to the bishop, Dr Murphy. His interest in Australia was aroused by the transportation of Irish convicts.<br>
<br>Therry was one of the two official Catholic chaplains sent out by the Colonial Office to New South Wales in December 1819 under the pressure of radical demand, the increasing influence of the Irish hierarchy, and the somewhat diffident promptings of Bishop Poynter, vicar apostolic of the London district. He reached Sydney in May 1820 on the convict ship <i>Janus</i>. At first he ministered in a temporary chapel in Pitt Street, and at Parramatta often in the open air. His colleague Philip Conolly proceeded to Van Diemen's Land, and for five seminal years Therry was the only Roman Catholic priest on the mainland: thus he earned the sobriquet the Patriarch of the Roman Catholic church in New South Wales. On 29 October 1821 Governor Macquarie laid the foundation-stone of St Mary's Chapel in Hyde Park, the first church on the site of Sydney's Roman Catholic cathedral. Therry was a devoted pastor, popular, energetic, and restless, who travelled great distances to serve his scattered people. He was respectful of authority, but impatient at any curtailment of what he considered to be his legal or social rights as a priest. Pious, zealous, and obstinate, he could be quarrelsome and difficult, particularly in matters concerning the considerable property he managed to accumulate in order to ensure the future of his church. He came into collision with the governor, Sir Ralph Darling, in 1827 and was for a time deprived of his salary as chaplain, but his pastoral and educational work continued with unabated vigour. In 1833 he became subordinate to the first Catholic vicar-general in the colony, the English Benedictine William Bernard Ullathorne, and then in 1835 to the first bishop, John Bede Polding, who sent him in 1838 as vicar-general to Van Diemen's Land (which became Tasmania during his ministry). There his long residence was characterized by a complex dispute on financial matters with the first bishop, Robert Willson.<br>
<br>Therry returned to live in Sydney during 1856 and became priest at St Augustine's, Balmain, where he died rather suddenly on 25 May 1864; he was buried in the crypt of St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney.<br>
