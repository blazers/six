<span class="headword">Bauz&aacute;,  Felipe</span>  (1764&#150;1834), <span class="occ">hydrographer</span>, was born in Palma, Majorca, in the Spanish Balearic Islands. He entered the Spanish navy at the age of fifteen, and experienced active service as he rose through the ranks. His career as a hydrographer began under Tofi&ntilde;o y Varela, surveying for the maritime atlas of Spain, and continued on the circumnavigation under Alessandro Malaspina, 1789&#150;94, when he took charge of the charts and plans made during the voyage. On the way back, Bauz&aacute; and his shipmate Espinosa y Tello travelled overland from Valpara&iacute;so to Buenos Aires, making geophysical, magnetic, and surveying observations. After further active service, he was posted in May 1797 to the hydrographic office in Madrid. In the war of independence against Napoleon's troops in 1810, Bauz&aacute; found himself fighting alongside British troops at Cadiz. He subsequently returned to Madrid and in 1815 succeeded Espinosa y Tello as director of the Dep&oacute;sito Hidrogr&aacute;fico. Honours accrued to Bauz&aacute;: in 1807 membership of the Spanish Academy of History; in 1816 membership of the Royal Bavarian Academy and award of a Russian order; in 1821 membership of the Academy of Sciences of Turin; and in Britain, election to the Royal Society in 1819, in recognition of his skills in astronomy and hydrography.<br>
<br>Bauz&aacute; was elected in 1822 as a liberal member of the Spanish Cortes, representing his home district of Palma, during the troubled years of civil strife. In 1823 Ferdinand VII exiled those who opposed him and Bauz&aacute; found himself condemned and with a price on his head. With financial assistance from Henry Richard Vassall Fox, third Baron Holland, one of many English sympathizers, he joined the flood of refugees making for Gibraltar. He had married Teresa Ravera of Madrid, and they had a son, Felipe (1802&#150;1875), later a prominent geologist, and two daughters, Ana and Am&eacute;lie. He parted company with them at Gibraltar in October, having made a British will in which he stated that he was worth less than his wife had brought to the marriage, and that she and their children should be his sole inheritors. Then, with as many hydrographical charts and documents as he could take with him, Bauz&aacute; made his way to London, where he at first stayed at Holland House and took English lessons.<br>
<br>After a few months Bauz&aacute; found a permanent home in Johnson Street, Somers Town, in north London, in the heart of the Spanish exile community, which included over a thousand families. A cultured man, he was welcomed into London literary and scientific society, especially among hydrographers and astronomers to whom he was already known. He corresponded with Fernandez de Navarrete, his locum tenens in Madrid, and responded to British requests for information on matters of navigation in those parts of South America which he had visited and charted, and which, as the Spanish empire decayed, were of growing interest to the Admiralty. The hydrographer of the navy, Captain W. E. Parry, introduced him into the Royal Society, where he regularly attended meetings, and he became a member of the Athenaeum. Captains Philip King, John Purdy, F. W. Beechey, and John Franklin often sought his help, but Bauz&aacute;'s closest associations were with Captain Basil Hall, concerning the Pacific coast of the Americas in 1826, and with Captain W. H. Smythe, at whose house he found a warm welcome. Together they checked Smythe's chart of the Strait of Gibraltar and Bauz&aacute; offered data on a shoal at Tarifa which had escaped Smythe's notice. The British hydrographers were also eager to learn about the organization at the admired Madrid office. Bauz&aacute; visited William Herschel's observatory at Slough. In 1826 he spent three months in Paris and was invited to meet Alexander von Humboldt. The Spanish naval ministry instructed him to send plans and descriptions of the instruments at the Royal Greenwich Observatory, and he assisted with the order put on the London instrument maker Thomas Jones for similar apparatus for the San Fernando observatory; when Jones dallied over the order, Bauz&aacute; was called on to investigate the delay. In August 1826 the death sentence on Bauz&aacute; was confirmed, ending hope of return. However, in the early 1830s he was corresponding with Trinity House over the cost and procurement of lighthouses for Spanish ports. The new hydrographer, Francis Beaufort, introduced Bauz&aacute; as a member of the Royal Geographical Society in 1831, and consulted him on the prospective voyage of the <i>Beagle</i> under Fitzroy.<br>
<br>On 25 October 1832 Queen Christine, the Spanish regent, declared an amnesty for the exiles but Bauz&aacute; was unable to take advantage of it. He died at his home from a massive cerebral haemorrhage on 3 March 1834 and was buried on 8 March 1834 in a vault at the Catholic chapel in Moorfields, in the City of London. His obituarist in <span class="italic">Nautical Magazine</span> commented on Bauz&aacute;'s excellent qualities, and his kind and affectionate disposition. His wife appeared in Gibraltar on 10 March 1835 to prove his will. His son studied in Madrid, then spent a considerable time in Paris and in Freiburg, but it is not known if he was able to meet his father in France. Some of the papers which Bauz&aacute; brought from Spain are now in the British Library.<br>
