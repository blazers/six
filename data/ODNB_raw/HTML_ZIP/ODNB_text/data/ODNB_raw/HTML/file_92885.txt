<span class="headword">Banks,  John</span>  (1934&#150;2003), <span class="occ">bookmaker</span>, was born John Boyle on 19 August 1934 at 62 Dover Street, Anderston, Glasgow, the son of Hugh Boyle, window cleaner, and his wife, Rachel Williamson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brown. As a child he took his father's bets to the local (illegal) bookmaker and on leaving Woodside senior secondary school aged fifteen he first became a bookmaker's runner, earning commission on the bets from the local factory workers, before being elevated to the position of the clerk who registered the wagers. He was quick to pick up the basics of turf accounting and entered the profession himself at an unlicensed dog track, but his bank of &pound;200 was wiped out within two months. Supported by small loans from his father, he moved to making a book at Mount Vernon, a licensed greyhound track in Glasgow, and then at Hamilton Park racecourse. About this time he began using the trade name of John Banks.<br>
<br>In 1961 off-course cash betting was legalized in Britain and Banks began to purchase betting shops, which he described as &#145;money factories&#146; with &#145;a licence to steal money&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 12 Aug 2003). In these he pioneered new betting avenues such as handicaps on football matches. By 1972 he owned thirty-four shops in Glasgow and Lanarkshire, which he sold to Mecca Bookmakers for about &pound;1 million. He then began operating a tipping service from his house overlooking Sunningdale golf course, selling information to up to 1000 clients a week. As a gambling racehorse owner he also had some success, most notably when Kamundu, ridden by Lester Piggott, won the royal hunt cup at Ascot in 1969. On being asked how much he had won, Banks replied that &#145;they were still counting&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Herald</span>, 12 Aug 2003).<br>
<br>However it was as a flamboyant on-course bookmaker wearing a big black fedora and dark glasses that Banks became famous. His business was stimulated by offering better odds than his rivals, notably Ladbrokes, with whose chairman, Cyril Stein, he carried on a very public feud. He once wanted to name one of his racehorses Greenwich Mean Stein but, after this was rejected by Weatherbys, racing's administrative body, he opted for Adorable Cyril. His image was enhanced by a willingness to take large bets and to let the betting world know about it. In March 1970 he stood to lose &pound;156,000 before Prince de Galles was beaten by a neck in the Lincoln Handicap. Earlier that month he lost &pound;60,000 when Persian War won the champion hurdle. Never a sore loser, Banks sent champagne to the table of the winning owner when he discovered that they were dining in the same Cheltenham hotel. An unashamed self-publicist, he travelled to the races in a yellow Rolls-Royce, had his private plane painted in his purple and white racing colours, and advertised that he would offer 20:1 on Perry Mason, a fictional lawyer in a television series, losing a case. He gained more publicity by buying horses that had gained notoriety, such as Gay Future, the animal involved in a betting scandal at Cartmel in which the conspirators could have won &pound;300,000. Another purchase was Hill House, a horse that had been at the centre of a doping controversy until a scientific inquiry established that it manufactured high levels of its own cortisone. The purchase brought media exposure but little success on the racetrack, as during the next three seasons Hill House ran twenty-three times without winning.<br>
<br>Banks developed a friendship with the National Hunt jockey John Francome, and in 1978, following an inquiry into the running of a horse, coincidently called Stopped, Banks was fined &pound;2500 by the Jockey Club stewards and warned off racecourses for three years. Both Banks and Francome were found guilty of &#145;conduct likely to cause serious damage to the interests of horseracing&#146; by exchanging confidential information on horses. Banks went to the High Court but failed to have the decision overturned, though counsel for the Jockey Club stressed that neither he nor Francome had been accused of corrupt activity. On his return to racing his appetite for publicity had gone. He adopted a lower profile and instead of challenging his fellow layers he became chairman of the Rails Bookmakers' Association and was instrumental in gaining permission for such bookmakers to display odds like the conventional bookmakers. Eventually he handed over the business to his son Geoffrey, one of two sons and three daughters from his first marriage. He had another daughter from a second marriage to Anne-Marie, who nursed him through his losing battle with throat cancer. In July 2003 the John Banks nursery handicap stakes was named after him at Hamilton Park, the course where his bookmaking career had begun. He died at his home, 8 The Grange, Holloway Drive, Virginia Water, Surrey, on 10 August 2003, and was survived by his wife, Anne-Marie, and his six children.<br>
