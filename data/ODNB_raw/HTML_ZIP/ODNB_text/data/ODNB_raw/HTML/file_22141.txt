<span class="headword">Phillip,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1596&#150;1619), <span class="occ">translator</span>, may have lived in the Netherlands, and worked for the London-based printer John Wolfe, who specialized in books and news from Europe. Wolfe had his agents everywhere, and Phillip may have been one of them, although he was not exclusively in Wolfe's employment.<br>
<br>Wolfe published a number of translations by a W. P. in 1596&#150;7 which may be by William Phillip: a Dutch treatise on painting, <span class="italic">A Boke of Secrets</span> (1596); <span class="italic">Praedictio astrologia: the Great and Wonderfull Prognostication for 1598</span> (entered in the Stationers' register on 19 December 1597), from the Dutch work by Rodulphus Graephus; two works describing recent events in France; and <span class="italic">The Edict and Decree of Philip, King of Spaine, Touching the Exchanging of Monyes</span> (1597), which was translated from a French translation.<br>
<br>Phillip's first known translation was of Nicholaus Petri's <span class="italic">The practique om to leeren rekenen cijpheren ende boeckhouven</span>, and appeared under the title <span class="italic">Pathway of Knowledge</span> in 1596, dedicated to the mayor and aldermen of London. Phillip presents the treatise on arithmetic, weights and measures, and bookkeeping, as for the general benefit of the commonwealth.<br>
<br>Two more works for Wolfe followed in 1598. The first was a translation of Bernardt Lanhenez's account of the successful voyage of Cornelius de Houtman, published as <span class="italic">The Description of a Voyage into the East Indies</span> (de Houtman had returned, triumphant, to Amsterdam in 1597). It was dedicated to Sir James Scudamore, and Phillip again claims service to the commonwealth to be his chief aim. The success of de Houtman's expedition spurred others to risk ships and crews, and Phillip captured this adventure in his next translation of that year: <span class="italic">John Huighen Van Linschoten, his Discours of Voyages into the East and West Indies</span>. This translation was dedicated to Sir Julius Caesar, judge of the high court of admiralty, and talks of &#145;the manyfolde Curtesies, which it hath pleased you from time to time to multiply upon mee&#146;.<br>
<br>Phillip's next translation from Dutch appeared in 1609, from an original work by Gerrit de Veer. It was titled <span class="italic">The True and Perfect Description of Three Voyages by the Ships of Holland and Zeland</span>. It was dedicated to Sir Thomas Smith, governor of the East India and Muscovy companies. Phillip writes that he was encouraged by Richard Hakluyt and others to make the work public. A later edition was published by the Hakluyt Society in 1853 and edited by Charles T. Beke, who notes in the translation &#145;a number of errors resulting evidently from the want of a thorough acquaintance with the Dutch language&#146;  (Beke, cxxxviii). Phillip's next translation in 1619 was also dedicated to Smith and had the title <span class="italic">The relation of a wonderful voyage made by William Cornelison Schouten of Horne, showing how south from the Straight of Magelan in Terra Del-Fuogo, he found and discovered a new passage through the great South Sea, and that was sayled round about the world</span>. Phillip's last known translation was from Dutch into Latin and then into English, and was printed in London in 1619 with the title <span class="italic">Newes from Bohemia, showing the reasons why those of the reformed religion were moved to take armes for the defence of the king and themselves, especially against the dangerous sect of Jesuites</span>.<br>
<br>Phillip witnessed the rapid extension of Dutch power between 1580 and 1620. To him it was a miracle. The Dutch were able to mount great navies and armies and pay for them mainly out of taxation. He was determined the English reading world understood that this was achieved through the dedication of Calvinist explorers.<br>
