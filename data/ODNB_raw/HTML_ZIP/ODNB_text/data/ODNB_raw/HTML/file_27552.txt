<span class="headword">Topham,  Francis William <span class="st"> [Frank]</span></span>  (1808&#150;1877), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was born at Leeds, Yorkshire, on 15 April 1808, the son of Richard Topham (1781&#150;1834), pawnbroker, and his wife, Elizabeth Rawson (1784&#150;1861). Apprenticed to an uncle, Samuel Topham, an engraver and future pioneer of portrait photography, he first engraved lettering for cards and monograms for cutlery and, with a few flourishes, commercial bills. In 1830 he moved to London with savings of &pound;5 to take up heraldic engraving, before joining the publishers Fenner and Sears as an engraver of title-pages and illustrations. This led to original illustrative work for books, including Walter Scott's <span class="roman">Waverley</span> novels, S. C. Hall's <span class="italic">Book of Gems</span> (1836), and George Tattersall's <span class="italic">The Lakes of England</span> (1836)&#151;which was republished in colour under Topham's name in 1869&#151;and for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>. In 1851 he engraved frontispieces for the three volumes of Charles Dickens's <span class="italic">A Child's History of England</span>.<br>
<br>In March 1832 Topham married Mary Anne Beckwith (1811&#150;1873) of Clerkenwell, London, the sister of a fellow engraver, Henry Beckwith; they had ten children. The couple lived at 32 Fortess Terrace, Kentish Town and, from about 1854, at 1 Bloomfield Villas, Tufnell Park West. Soon after his arrival in London, Topham joined the Artists' Society, which met in Clipstone Street to draw models picked from street vagabonds. He began to exhibit in 1832 and had seven paintings shown at the Royal Academy. In 1842 he was elected an associate of the New Society of Painters in Water Colours, becoming a full member in the following year. He moved to the Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1848.<br>
<br>Working almost exclusively in watercolour, Topham proved himself a remarkable colourist. Joseph Jenkins, secretary of the Society of Painters in Water Colours, wrote that:<blockquote>Topham's shadows are rich and transparent because he saw light in shadow. &hellip; He put on colour and took off colour, rubbed and scrubbed, sponged out, repainted, washed, plastered and spluttered his drawings about in a frenzied sort of way in the effort to produce something lurking in his mind. &hellip; Every drawing seemed something like an experiment. (Roget, 2.325)</blockquote>He soon took peasant life as a favourite&#151;sometimes sentimental&#151;subject, and in 1844 and 1845 he visited the west of Ireland with his fellow painters Frederick Goodall and Alfred Fripp. This led to further tours in Ireland in 1860 and 1862 and to Scotland and Snowdonia, where from 1852 he was a regular member of the artists' colony at Betws-y-coed.<br>
<br>Topham's illustrations for Charles Dickens were not followed by more such commissions; however, he painted a number of Dickensian subjects and presented the author with a watercolour of Barnaby Rudge which eventually hung in Dickens's homes at Broadstairs and Gad's Hill. Dickens recruited Topham to his amateur theatrical company, the Guild of Literature and Art, and the painter frequently performed with Dickens, Wilkie Collins, and the artists Clarkson Stanfield and John Tenniel. The company appeared before Queen Victoria and in country houses, as well as in London and provincial theatres. Topham earned Dickens's praise for his portrayal of Goodenough Easy in Edward Bulwer-Lytton's <span class="italic">Not so Bad as we Seem</span> in 1851, and he also shone in Douglas Jerrold's <span class="italic">The Rent Day</span>.<br>
<br>Topham missed most of the following two years' productions as he was touring Spain: in search of the picturesque, he visited Madrid, Toledo, Segovia, C&oacute;rdoba, Granada, and Seville. He travelled rough and caused bewilderment among innkeepers, who could not understand why he should pay peasants to sit for him instead of charging them for painting their portraits. The squalor of Spain appalled him: &#145;&#147;There is <i>but one</i> <i>Madrid</i>&#148;, says the Spaniard; &#147;So much the better,&#148; says the Englishman,&#146; he wrote in a letter home; he hated, too, the cruelty of the bull-fight. However, he considered, &#145;Such glorious combinations of landscape and architecture I don't think are to be found in any other country&#146;  (Roget, 2.322). Topham's larger Spanish works were painted from sketches on his return to London, his subjects being figures in brightly coloured native dress in settings indicated by such titles as <span class="italic">The Eve of the Fiesta</span>, <span class="italic">The Andalusian Letter-Writer</span>, and <span class="italic">Spanish Gossip</span>. French subjects dating from 1857, and Italian from 1864, resulted from subsequent visits to Brittany, Venice, and Capri. His paintings commanded good prices from the growing urban middle class avid for colourful paintings of rural life: <span class="italic">The Gipsy Toilet</span> fetched &pound;498 in 1865, <span class="italic">The Picador, Seville</span> &pound;378 in 1873, and <span class="italic">Preparing for the Bullfight</span> &pound;341 in 1874.<br>
<br>Topham was said to be an amusing companion, and a skilled amateur conjuror and juggler, which caused difficulties in Ireland when the superstitious accused him of casting magic spells, even making coins appear inside potatoes. This talent surprised Charles Dickens, who wrote that &#145;Topham has suddenly come out as a Juggler and swallows candles and does wonderful things with the Poker&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 6.539). In appearance Topham was bearded and, when going bald, always wore a skull-cap; retaining his stubborn but humorous Yorkshire character, he was a founder member and vice-president of the Savage Club.<br>
<br>In 1862 Topham moved to Warwick House, 86 Adelaide Road, London; then in 1873 he built himself a large house and studio at 4 Arkwright Road, Hampstead, which he named Dinas after one he had rented for his family near Betws-y-coed. His happy family life was shadowed by bereavement; one of his children died in 1857, his wife in 1873, and a favourite daughter, Polly, soon afterwards. His eldest son, Francis William Warwick (Frank) Topham (1838&#150;1924), also a painter, married, on 3 May 1870, Helen Lemon, daughter of Topham's friend Mark Lemon, the first editor of <span class="italic">Punch</span>.<br>
<br>In 1877 Topham, whose own health had been failing, made a final visit to Spain, travelling with two friends. In Madrid he was taken ill, but he continued to C&oacute;rdoba by train, making the seventeen-hour journey with only two biscuits to share between the three of them. On arrival he collapsed and died at the Fonda Suiza, a hotel in the strada Torrijos, on 31 March. He was buried in the protestant cemetery outside C&oacute;rdoba; when that fell into dereliction he was reinterred on 16 December 1959 at the municipal cemetery of San Rafael in the city, where, in 1994, a nearby square was renamed plaza del Pintor Topham. Examples of his work are in the collections of the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London; the Williamson Art Gallery and Museum, Birkenhead; the Art Gallery and Museum, Bury; the Reading Museum and Art Gallery; the Ulster Museum, Belfast; and the municipal collection in C&oacute;rdoba.<br>
