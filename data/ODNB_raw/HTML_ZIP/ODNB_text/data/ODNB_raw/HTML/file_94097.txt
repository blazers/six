<span class="headword">Paige,  Edward George Sydney <span class="st"> [Ted]</span></span>  (1930&#150;2004), <span class="occ">physicist and engineer</span>, was born on 18 July 1930 at Fernbank, Old London Road, Hastings, Sussex, the only child of Sydney Paige (1889&#150;1958), a stationmaster, and his wife, Maude Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Robertson (1904&#150;2002). Ted, as he was universally known, attended Rye grammar school, which for his first three years was based in Bedford, where he was billeted with a variety of families. As a boy he spent a lot of time roaming Romney marsh investigating wildlife and taking samples home to examine under a microscope. This interest in the natural world, and in birds in particular, remained throughout his life, developing into a passion for photography in his later years. In 1949 he was awarded a county scholarship and obtained a place at Reading University to read physics. When he was awarded a first-class degree he decided to stay in Reading to study for a PhD, becoming the first research student of Bill Mitchell. His research was on the optical effects of radiation damage in quartz for which received a doctorate in 1955. On 11 July 1953 he married Helen Gill (<i>b</i>. 1932), a clerk, and daughter of Alfred John and Kate Gill. The couple had two sons, Timothy and Niels, and two daughters, Sadie and Clare.<br>
<br>Having found research to his liking, Paige applied to the civil service commission for, and was awarded, a junior research fellowship. He opted to hold it at the Radar Research Establishment at Malvern and took up his post in 1955, joining the recently formed transistor physics division under Alan Gibson. For the next thirteen years he was an integral part of the great forward push on semiconductors; his own contribution was on the electrical, optical, and acoustical properties of the important semiconductor materials germanium and silicon.<br>
<br>Towards the end of this period Paige, together with a colleague, Dennis Maines, realized that the propagation of waves on the surface of a semiconductor might have considerable device potential. In 1968 they successfully applied for Ministry of Defence funding, which resulted in Paige being appointed leader of a new group that he built into a world-leading team in the research and development of surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices. Under his leadership the Malvern SAW group acquired a strong international reputation with many inventions, patents, and publications. In 1973 the Ministry of Defence presented its Wolfe award to the Malvern SAW team for its pioneering work. The team designed SAW filters, which were used to improve the performance of radar systems fitted into the Nimrod fleet of aircraft used by the RAF for reconnaissance. Paige's work on these filters resulted in a queen's award for technological achievement to the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment (as the Radar Research Establishment had become) in 1989. There were many other device successes, and for many years all colour televisions contained a SAW filter invented in the Malvern SAW group.<br>
<br>In 1977 Paige was appointed professor of electrical engineering at the University of Oxford and a fellow of St John's College, making, as he himself commented, &#145;the simultaneous changes from physicist to engineer, from research to teaching, and from a government establishment to a collegiate university&#146;  (Raynes). He rose to the challenge and, using his long experience in pure and applied physics and industry, contributed strongly to the teaching and research life of the department of engineering science, playing a leading role in a number of new initiatives. In 1984 he was acting head of department for four months.<br>
<br>Paige's achievements in science were recognized by many personal awards. In 1978 he received the Rayleigh medal of the Institute of Acoustics and the Duddel medal of the Institute of Physics. In 1979 he was awarded (with others) the Hewlett Packard prize for outstanding achievement in condensed matter physics awarded by the European Physical Society for &#145;The physical principles of surface acoustic wave devices&#146;. He was a fellow of the Institute of Physics and of the Institution of Electrical Engineers. In 1983 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society.<br>
<br>Paige's last area of scientific work, started after his retirement in 1997, was unknown to most of his former colleagues. Just before retirement he had been diagnosed with haemochromatosis, a genetic disorder causing the body to absorb an excessive amount of iron. He joined the Haemochromatosis Society, became a director, and spent much of his retirement helping the society by applying his scientific skills to help analyse data, to write reports on the geographical distribution of UK patients, and to investigate the extent of under-diagnosis of the disorder. Ted Paige was by nature a modest, quiet, even private, man. However, this deceptively mild exterior hid an inner firmness, and when he was roused by some perceived injustice he would prevail over the opposition with an impeccable logic few could match and an honesty and politeness that gained the respect of all. He died from cancer of the liver on 20 February 2004 at Sobell House, Oxford. He was survived by his wife, Helen, and their four children.<br>
