<span class="headword">Ravilious,  Eric William</span>  (1903&#150;1942), <span class="occ">artist and designer</span>, was born at Acton, London, on 22 July 1903, the second son and youngest of three surviving children of Frank Ravilious, coach builder and owner of a furniture and upholstery business, and his wife, Emma, daughter of William Ford, farmer, of Kingsbridge, Devon. His unusual name he claimed to be of Huguenot origin. His family moved to Eastbourne, Sussex, where his father started a business as a dealer in antiques and second-hand books.<br>
<br>Ravilious was educated at the Eastbourne Municipal Boys' School and the Eastbourne School of Art, and gained a scholarship in September 1922 to the Royal College of Art. He had a winning personality and was an accomplished games-player. A fellow student at Eastbourne, John Lake, wrote that even as a young man &#145;he always seemed to be slightly somewhere else, as if he lived a private life which did not completely coincide with material existence&#146;  (Binyon, 23). At the royal college he made firm friends with Edward Bawden. Both were in the school of design and belonged to a select group who learned wood-engraving under Paul Nash, whose dry watercolour style they emulated. Ravilious specialized in mural design for his final exam. He and Bawden used the resources of the Victoria and Albert Museum to good effect and also found sympathetic antecedents in the work of Francis Towne, J. S. Cotman, and Samuel Palmer. Ravilious left the college in 1925 with a travelling scholarship. He spent the summer in Florence but was not visibly affected by the experience. The talents of Bawden and Ravilious had been noticed even by 1924. Early in his career Ravilious enjoyed the patronage of Sir Geoffrey Fry, private secretary to the prime minister, Stanley Baldwin. He specialized in wood-engraving, his first book illustrations being for Martin Armstrong's novel <span class="italic">Desert</span> (1926). The folk-art quality of his earliest wood-engravings soon changed to a distinctive and controlled linear style, exploring architectural space and landscape laden with reverie and suggestion, populated by doll-like figures, and designed with a pattern of black and white. He illustrated private press editions for the Golden Cockerel Press, including <span class="italic">The Twelve Moneths</span> (1927) and <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> (1932). A set of zodiacal signs for the Lanston Monotype Corporation in 1929 indicated his ability in resurrecting the graphic quality of traditional symbolism. In 1938 he illustrated <span class="italic">The Natural History of Selborne</span>, by Gilbert White, for the Nonesuch Press. His wood-engravings became familiar to a wide public through their use by London Transport, Dent's <span class="roman">Everyman's Library</span>, and Wisden's <span class="italic">Cricketer's Almanac</span>. He made pictures of unusual shop fronts, drawn as lithographs in three colours, which were given a text by his friend the architectural critic J. M. Richards and published in 1939 as <span class="italic">High Street</span>.<br>
<br>Ravilious and Bawden shared the design and execution of murals in the refreshment room at Morley College, Lambeth, funded by Lord Duveen and opened early in 1930 after two years' work. Depicting scenes from Shakespeare and his contemporaries these were lighthearted but fine-tuned in their colour and drawing, and were an instant success. In 1972 Bawden recalled their collaboration thus:<blockquote>Elizabethan plays, Shakespeare, Olympian gods and goddesses, Punch and Judy, a Miracle play and a doll's house&#151;Gosh! what a riot it was. Whatever beneficial influence Italy had had on Eric was now to some extent revealed, not by plagiarism, rather by his skill in organising space and in creating it for figures to be sent dancing and swinging in ballet movement across the walls. (<span class="italic">Eric Ravilious, 1903&#150;1942</span>, exhibition catalogue)</blockquote>The murals were destroyed by bombing. Ravilious painted others at the Midland Hotel, Morecambe, in 1933, now lost through water damage, and in the Pier Pavilion, Colwyn Bay, 1935, now also lost.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Ravilious painted watercolours, mostly of rural scenes, buildings, and machinery, and occasionally of interiors, to which he gave a quality of imaginative intensity. The technique that he and Bawden developed together became more refined, and Ravilious was the more delicate in atmosphere, touch, and colour. In 1930 he and Bawden rented part of Brick House, Great Bardfield, Essex, and spent holidays and weekends there, furnishing the house in a distinctive decorative style. Ravilious preferred the landscape of Sussex, however, and many of his paintings were done while staying with the artist Peggy Angus in her cottage, Furlongs, near Glynde. He was self-critical and destroyed much of his work but held one-man shows in London, at the Zwemmer Gallery in 1934 and 1937, and at Arthur Tooth's Gallery in 1939. His favourite subjects included ships, railways, quarries and their machinery, quaysides, the interiors of greenhouses, and deserted downland with figures cut in the chalk. His work was admired by modernists for its abstract quality, while always remaining figurative.<br>
<br>Ravilious combined painting with design activity, working for the potters Josiah Wedgwood in the design of transfer patterns for use on existing shapes; he began with the 1937 coronation mug, a mixture of traditional symbolism (a royal arms simplified in silhouette) and almost abstract patterning based on fireworks, with loosely brushed colour recalling Staffordshire or Sunderland ware of the 1820s. He designed other commemorative pieces, notably the Boat Race bowl and goblet (1938) and three complete services: &#145;Persephone&#146; (1936), &#145;Travel&#146; (1938), and &#145;Garden&#146; (1938). The most popular design, reissued several times, was &#145;Nursery china&#146; (1937), usually described as &#145;Alphabet&#146;. He designed a dining-room table and chairs of Regency inspiration for the firm of Dunbar Hay, as well as china and glass made by Stuart Crystal of Stourbridge; he was also involved in experimental textile pattern design with lithography for the Cotton Board in 1941, producing some specimens of a decorative child's handkerchief.<br>
<br>On 5 July 1930 Ravilious married Eileen Lucy 
    (Tirzah; 1908&#150;1951)
  , daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Frederick Scott Garwood, Royal Engineers, who had been a pupil of his at Eastbourne School of Art and was a fine wood-engraver. She also made marbled paper and, in later years, imaginative framed models of typical country village buildings. They had two sons and one daughter; having children made it difficult for her to work as an artist. They lived in Earls Court, then near the Thames in Hammersmith, and continued sharing Brick House before moving to Bank House, Castle Hedingham, Essex, in 1935. Ravilious was attractive to women in general and between 1934 and 1938 had an affair with the artist Helen Binyon, a fellow student from the Royal College of Art, who finally broke it off and remained friendly with Tirzah. Encouraged by the children she wrote a monograph on Ravilious which was published posthumously in 1983.<br>
<br>In December 1939 Ravilious was invited to serve as a war artist with the Admiralty and given the rank of captain in the Royal Marines. His talents were well matched to subjects involving sea, sky, ships, aircraft, and such unexpected occurrences as the quilted counterpane of a sick bay at Dundee (painting, Imperial War Museum, London) or the inside of Corporal Steddiford's mobile pigeon loft (painting, Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester). He produced some of his best paintings in this role and also worked on a series of lithographs of submarines, intended for a book to promote the navy that was never brought to publication. At the end of August 1942 he flew to Iceland to paint the Norwegian squadron. He joined an air sea rescue flight from Kaldadarnes on 2 September, in order to observe it in action, but the plane went missing and no trace of it was ever found.<br>
<br>Ravilious's work contributed to a new style of representing England and Englishness, both topographically and in official commissions, such as the catalogue covers that he executed for the British pavilions at international exhibitions in Paris (1937) and New York (1939). His graphic, wiry style was influential in the design of the Festival of Britain in 1951 and has subsequently attracted a small but avid and increasing interest.<br>
