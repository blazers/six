<span class="headword">Wood,  Edward</span>  (1846&#150;1930), <span class="occ">building society manager</span>, was born on 8 September 1846 at Baddesley Ensor, Warwickshire, the son of Edward Wood, a collier, later a colliery under-manager, and his wife, Eleanor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Atkins. His father was illiterate in 1846 and could only make his mark when registering his son's birth.<br>
<br>Wood started work in the colliery's counting house and became its London agent when he was twenty-five. In September 1870 he married Elizabeth, the daughter of Robert Heuchan, a tea dealer; the couple had one son and three daughters. After moving to Battersea in 1871, Wood was active in local government as a Liberal and also became a prominent temperance campaigner.<br>
<br>The temperance cause was his lifetime passion, and this connection led to his election to the board of the Temperance Building Society in 1882. Founded in 1854, the Temperance flourished and in 1880 was the sixth largest building society. In 1887 the society's founder secretary died and Wood was appointed to replace him; he proved to be an able manager, paying meticulous attention to detail and keeping all aspects of the business under his close personal control.<br>
<br>In 1892 the collapse of the country's largest building society, the Liberator, faced all societies with a crisis, but especially the Temperance, since its investors were drawn from exactly the same nonconformist circles that had fuelled the Liberator's rapid growth. Wood acted swiftly and decisively. A letter sent to all members detailed the strength of the Temperance Society's balance sheet. Investors' fears were allayed by the waiving of the usual notice of one month for withdrawals; payment would be on demand. By 1896 the Temperance had resumed steady growth and by 1906 it was the largest society.<br>
<br>Early in his building society career Wood took a number of innovative steps. In 1895 he was one of the first managers to pay commission to builders developing estates for introducing borrowers to the building society. Assets reached a peak in 1909. Later the Temperance Society's relative position declined, especially after 1918. While other large societies had growing branch networks, the Temperance had none. Changes after 1918, such as mortgages for bigger proportions of the house price, for longer terms, and to less wealthy buyers, were seen as risking the huge reserves that the Temperance had built up, and it is clear that Wood's very conservative attitude to risk and delegation, although financially prudent, inhibited the long-term growth of the society. Wood had outside business interests as a board member (later chairman) of the Sceptre Assurance Company and the Artisans' General Dwelling Company, which owned more than 7000 houses.<br>
<br>In the aftermath of the collapse of the Liberator, Wood became more prominent in the National Association of Building Societies, whose executive committee he joined in 1887. He campaigned for increased powers for the registrar of building societies and for the annual publication of much detail from individual societies, especially concerning loans in arrears and properties in possession. The 1894 <span class="roman">Building Societies Act</span> largely reflected these views. Wood served as the association's chairman from 1903 to 1913, and continued on the executive until 1923. He ended London domination of the executive and made the association truly national. An excellent public speaker, he was adept in presenting statistical information. During his chairmanship government proposals increasingly impinged on building society territory, and Wood was a formidable leader of the association's delegations to ministers. He was a member of the 1908 royal commission on the Land Transfer Acts and was one of a group of financial specialists advising Lloyd George on the 1909 <span class="roman">Finance Act</span>.<br>
<br>An active figure in local government, Wood served as chairman of Battersea vestry and was its representative on the Wandsworth board of works. In 1886 he became Wandworth representative on the Metropolitan Board of Works&#151;the forerunner of the London county council. He was prominent in the movement which achieved borough status for Battersea in 1888. He was a JP first for Surrey and then for London county, and was chairman of the Wandsworth bench from 1900 to 1926. Wood was a Wesleyan Methodist (a member of Bromwood Wesleyan Church, Clapham) and held high office in many temperance organizations: the Band of Hope, the United Kingdom Temperance Alliance, the Good Templars order, and the Temperance Orphanage (chairman, 1884&#150;1930). In 1916 he published <span class="italic">The Nationalization of the Liquor Traffic</span>. He was a freemason and past master of a temperance lodge.<br>
<br>Wood died at his home, 58 Nightingale Lane, Clapham, London, on 20 September 1930, following a stroke at his diamond wedding celebration. He was cremated, and his ashes were interred at St Mary's Church cemetery, Battersea.<br>
