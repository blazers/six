<span class="headword">Mac Cairte&aacute;in,  Uilliam</span> <span class="st"> [William MacCartan]</span>  (1667/8&#150;1724), <span class="occ">poet and scribe</span>, was born in Munster; a manuscript in his own hand records that he was aged thirty-four on 30 March 1702  (Royal Irish Academy, MS 23 H 18, p. 137). The names of his parents are not known. His wife's name was C&aacute;it, and she was evidently related to another Cork poet and scribe, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20656/', "Eoghan &#211; Caoimh (1656&#150;1726)")</script>. In his youth Uilliam Mac Cairte&aacute;in served in the cavalry of the army of James II in Ireland and was a participant in the ambush of Williamite soldiers at B&eacute;al &Aacute;tha Salainn (Six Mile Water) close to his home in co. Cork in April 1691. After the war he lived as a farmer just north of Cork city on a farm straddling the parishes of Carraig na bhFear and Teampall Geal (Whitechurch). The locality was renowned for its poetic and scribal tradition. Approximately thirty of his poetic compositions survive including works in praise of local Catholic gentry and laments on exiled gentry and clergy. He also composed humorous poems. Little information survives concerning his family, but a fellow poet's composition on the occasion of the marriage of his son in 1725 reveals that he had a son named D&oacute;nall who was himself a poet and inherited his books. Traditional sources suggest he also had sons named Tadhg and S&eacute;an and daughters whose names are not recorded.<br>
<br>A small number of manuscripts in Irish transcribed by Mac Cairte&aacute;in survives, containing stories from the Fianna&iacute;ocht (Ossianic) tradition, selected poetry, principally by fellow Munster poets D&aacute;ibh&iacute; &Oacute; Bruadair and Eoghan &Oacute; Caoimh, and devotional texts. Mac Cairte&aacute;in's scholarly contacts included John Sleyne, Catholic bishop of Cork from 1693 to 1703, from whom he borrowed manuscripts and for whom he wrote poetry. He may also have been employed by Sleyne to copy manuscripts. He was part of the same scholarly circle as the Revd Conor Mac Cairte&aacute;in (1658&#150;1737) who may have been his parish priest. Mac Cairte&aacute;in was closely associated with the poet and scribe Eoghan &Oacute; Caoimh and was godfather to Eoghan's son Art, who died in France in 1709 while studying for the priesthood. Their association was not without its tensions. Mac Cairte&aacute;in wrote poetry in praise of D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Colm&aacute;in's prose satire <span class="italic">Parliament na mBan</span>. In his own locality Mac Cairte&aacute;in enjoyed the patronage of the McCarthy family. He may also have enjoyed the patronage of the prominent Cork Jacobite Sir James Cotter (<i>d</i>. 1705), and he was an admirer of both Sir James and his son. One of his poems revealed that Sir James had been responsible for the death of the regicide John Lisle in 1664.<br>
<br>After the death of Diarmaid Mac Se&aacute;in Bu&iacute; Mhic Carthaigh in 1705 Mac Cairte&aacute;in became head of the local court of poetry which had been based at Gleann na R&aacute;tha, Blarney, co. Cork, and later at Teampall Geal. This assembly sought to maintain standards of poetic composition. The poetry of a younger poet from the same locality, Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Murch&uacute; na R&aacute;ith&iacute;neach (1700&#150;1762), indicates that he was indebted to the encouragement he received from Mac Cairte&aacute;in who also lent him books. On Mac Cairte&aacute;in's death in November 1724 he was succeeded as chief poet by Liam ruadh Mac Coitir (<i>c</i>.1690&#150;1738) who was in turn succeeded by Se&aacute;n na R&aacute;ith&iacute;neach. Mac Cairte&aacute;in was buried in the parish of Teampall Geal, co. Cork, and was long remembered in the locality for his wit and humour.<br>
