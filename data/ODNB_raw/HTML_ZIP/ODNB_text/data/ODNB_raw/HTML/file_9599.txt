<span class="headword">Meiler fitz Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1220), <span class="occ">soldier and justiciar of Ireland</span>, was the son of Henry, illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12948/', "Henry I")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19905/', "Nest")</script>, daughter of Rhys ap Tewdwr, king of Deheubarth (south Wales), who also had children with Gerald, constable of Windsor, and Stephen, constable of Cardigan. Meiler was thus a first cousin of Henry II and related also to prominent Cambro-Normans of south Wales, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9642/', "Robert fitz Stephen")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9574/', "Maurice fitz Gerald Fitzgerald (d. 1176)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7209/', "David fitz Gerald (d. 1176)")</script>, bishop of St David's, who were his uncles, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9582/', "Raymond Fitzgerald le Gros")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10769/', "Gerald of Wales")</script>, who were his cousins. His father, who had acted as steward (<i>dapifer</i>) of the lordship of Pebidiog, which had been granted by Henry I to Bernard, bishop of St David's, was slain in 1157 during Henry II's campaign in Wales. Meiler, then quite young, succeeded to his father's interests in Pebidiog and Narberth in Dyfed, the precise nature of which is unknown, but was exaggerated by Gerald of Wales; certainly, the stewardship of St David's subsequently was granted by David fitz Gerald, as bishop of St David's, to Maurice Fitzgerald.<h2>
<a name="RoleintheconquestofIreland"></a>Role in the conquest of Ireland</h2>In 1169 Meiler accompanied his uncle, Robert fitz Stephen, on his first expedition to Ireland where Gerald of Wales and the so-called &#145;Song of Dermot and the Earl&#146; depict Meiler distinguishing himself in military engagements between 1169 and 1176. In 1171, before his departure from Ireland, Henry II left Meiler under the constableship of Hugh de Lacy at Dublin. About 1173&#150;4 Meiler departed for Wales with Raymond le Gros, but, when the latter returned to Ireland, Meiler went with him and received a grant of the cantred of Conall in U&iacute; F&aacute;el&aacute;in from Richard de Clare, earl of Pembroke (Strongbow), as well as the cantred of Cairpre. In October 1175 he accompanied Raymond le Gros on his expedition to Limerick, and, alongside his cousin, David of Barry, withstood the Irish attack until the Anglo-Norman party had crossed the River Shannon. Following Strongbow's death in 1176 William fitz Aldelin, a royal official, arrived to administer the lordship of Leinster during the minority of Strongbow's heirs. Gerald of Wales depicted fitz Aldelin as harassing Meiler and his Geraldine relatives. In 1181 two other royal administrators, John the Constable and Richard de Pec, exchanged Meiler's custody of the castle of Kildare in the cantred of Conall in U&iacute; F&aacute;el&aacute;in for the border territory of Laigis. About 1182 Hugh de Lacy, lord of Meath (at that time also Henry II's agent in Ireland), built a castle for Meiler at Timahoe and gave him his niece as a wife. It may have been on the same occasion that Hugh enfeoffed him with the cantred of Ardnurcher (Westmeath). In 1192 a castle was erected at Ardnurcher.<h2>
<a name="JusticiarofIreland"></a>Justiciar of Ireland</h2>On John's accession as king of England, when documentary evidence on Angevin lordship in Ireland increases, Meiler is named as justiciar on 4 September 1199. He witnessed a charter (without title of justiciar) of John on 25 June 1200 at Chinon. On 28 October 1200 the king granted him (without title of justiciar) two cantreds in Ciarraige, Tricha C&eacute;t an Aicme and U&iacute; Ferba, and E&oacute;ghanacht Locha L&eacute;in (Kerry) in the kingdom of Cork, to be held for the service of fifteen knights. No later than 2 November 1201 he was reappointed to the custody of Ireland, John reserving to himself pleas touching the crown, the mint, and exchange. On 22 December 1201 the king threatened to remove him from the justiciarship unless he acted as instructed in &#145;the affair of William de Briouze&#146;, who had been granted the honour of Limerick on 12 January 1201  (<span class="italic">Calendar &hellip; Ireland</span>, 1, no. 160). About 30 August 1204 he was directed by the king to build a castle in Dublin &#145;to administer justice to the city&#146;, as well as for defence  (<span class="italic">Calendar &hellip; Ireland</span>, 1, no. 226); he was also to compel the citizens of Dublin to fortify their city. On 2 November 1204 the king ordered that Meiler's writs as justiciar should run throughout his land of Ireland.<br>
<br>Meiler's actions as justiciar, while also a tenant of the lords of Leinster and of Meath, were to create serious tensions among the Anglo-Norman baronage in Ireland. In January 1204 he took the lordship of U&iacute; Failge into his own hands, following the death of Gerald fitz Maurice Fitzgerald, thereby encroaching on the rights of William (I) Marshal, as lord of Leinster. He was also in dispute with the Marshal over custody of the castle of Dunamase in Laigis, a situation to which King John had contributed by confirming to Meiler, on 6 November 1200, Laigis and U&iacute; Chremthann&aacute;in to be held of the king for the service of five knights; this grant also encroached on the rights of the Marshal as lord of Leinster. On 26 March 1204 the king appointed commissioners, authorizing them to act with the powers of justiciar, to hear the actions and plaints which Meiler fitz Henry had against William de Burgh. On 12 February 1207 King John wrote to Meiler concerning William (III) de Briouze's complaints against Meiler and his son, in relation to custody of Limerick city. In the same year Meiler contrived the recall from Ireland of William Marshal, and, in his absence, Meiler's followers invaded Leinster; but the tenants of Walter de Lacy's lordship of Meath supported the Marshal's men against the justiciar's army. Meiler's castle of Ardnurcher was besieged for five weeks and eventually captured by Walter and Hugh de Lacy. During November 1207 Meiler persuaded King John to recall William Marshal's seneschal in Leinster so as to weaken his position in Ireland. By 20 March 1208, however, John had reached an accommodation with the Marshal and subsequently withdrew support for his justiciar, electing to settle the dispute between him and the Marshal by authorizing the latter's recovery of U&iacute; Failge and removing Meiler from office. The latest writ addressed to him as justiciar was dated 19 June 1208.<h2>
<a name="Lateryearsreligiouspatronageanddeath"></a>Later years, religious patronage, and death</h2>In 1211&#150;12 the cantreds of Laigis, Conall, and Cairpre, the land which Meiler held in the cantred of Aghaboe, and the castle of Dunamase in Laigis, were accounted by William (I) Marshal as being in the king's hand, probably resulting from John's expedition to Ireland. About 1212 Meiler's name appeared immediately after that of the Marshal in the declaration of loyalty offered by the Irish barons to John against his threatened deposition by the pope. In August 1219 the expenses he had incurred during his justiciarship were defrayed from the exchequer. On 24 November 1219 the citizens of Dublin offered half of the debt owed them by Meiler to the king, the other half to be deployed for the fortification of the city, an arrangement which was reiterated on 28 September 1220. Meiler must by that date have been a very old man. Already in 1216 it was thought likely that he might die, or at least retire into a monastery; in the same year, his lands in Ciarraige and E&oacute;ghanacht Locha L&eacute;in were granted to his Leinster feoffee, John de Clahull. On 28 May 1216 King John commanded Geoffrey de Marisco, justiciar of Ireland, to cause William Marshal to have all his fees in the lands held by Meiler fitz Henry. On 2 December 1219 Henry III restored to William Marshal, by then acting as regent, the service due from Meiler which King John had taken into his hand and ordered Meiler to render that service to the Marshal and to be attentive to him as his lord.<br>
<br>About 1202 Meiler had founded the Augustinian priory of Greatconnell (Kildare), affiliated to the Augustinian house of Llanthony Prima in Glamorgan, and which he endowed with the churches and benefices of his lands in Ireland, and with a tenth of his household expenses, rents, and produce. From the royal confirmation to Greatconnell, 10 September 1205, it is apparent that Meiler also held five burgages in Dungarvan. About July 1203 the king had issued letters of presentation to the bishop of Waterford directing that David, clerk of Meiler fitz Henry, be admitted to the church of Dungarvan and on 19 October 1204 the king gave his assent to the promotion of David, clerk and cousin of Meiler fitz Henry, to the see of Waterford (David was to be murdered in 1209). Meiler granted to Llanthony prima the churches and tithes of his land in Wicklow, where he held Kilpool and Killoughter of Gerald fitz Maurice Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1204). He died in 1220 and was buried in Greatconnell. He had no legitimate heirs, a punishment, according to Gerald of Wales, writing in 1210, for the fact that he had not been sufficiently generous to the church. His brother, Robert fitz Henry, had died about 1180; of his other brother, Morgan, who witnessed his charter in favour of Llanthony, nothing more is known. The same charter refers to his heirs; if the son, Meiler, mentioned in 1206, was legitimate, he must have been dead before 1210, when Gerald stated that Meiler had no legitimate heirs.<br>
