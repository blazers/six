<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pollard,  Albert Frederick</span>  (1869&#150;1948), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born in Ryde, Isle of Wight, on 16 December 1869, the second son of Henry Hindes Pollard, a pharmaceutical chemist, and his wife, Emily May Cave. The family was Methodist in religion and Liberal in its politics. Pollard was to jettison Methodism, but not Liberalism, which marked his scholarship with something rather stronger than respect for the British parliamentary constitution. His elder brother Henry Bargman Pollard of Christ Church, Oxford, a biologist of great promise, was accidentally drowned at the age of twenty-six. From Felsted School, where he was taught by John Sargeaunt, Pollard went up to Jesus College, Oxford, in 1887 as an exhibitioner. He was captain of boats, and throughout his life would retain an athletic temperament, as a vigorous walker, swimmer, and cyclist. At first he was a classicist, reading for honour moderations, in which he was placed in the second class in 1889. In his old age he told his daughter that that had been a good way to start, and that he doubted the wisdom of letting boys specialize in history at school. But he had no interest in the philosophical part of <i>literae humaniores</i> and transferred his allegiance to modern history, under the tuition of R. L. Poole. He won first-class honours in 1891, but was advised not to look for an academic career in Oxford. (His election to an All Souls research fellowship would come later, in 1908.)<br>
<br>Instead, Pollard made his living by coaching in London, and from the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, which he joined as an assistant editor in 1893; he remained with the project until 1901, when he fell out with Sir Sidney Lee. The 500 lives which he contributed (the equivalent of one whole volume of the original edition) made his historical apprenticeship. His salary was a meagre &pound;200 a year, but marriage in 1894 to Catherine Susanna, daughter of William Lucy of the Eagle ironworks, Oxford, brought with it a house at Putney.<br>
<br>In 1903 Pollard was elected to a new part-time chair of constitutional history in University College, London, where he remained until retirement in 1931. He had an unrivalled impact on his subject and profession, both in the University of London and nationally. The condition of history in the University of London at the time of his appointment was parlous in the extreme. There was a professor, the classicist F. C. Montague, who, it has been said, prolonged the nineteenth century in the history department until 1927. The Astor bequest gave Montague that title, in 1902. But at that time only fifteen students had ever graduated in the subject, at the rate of one or two a year. Since Pollard's salary derived from student fees (which were shared with the professor of constitutional law, Sir William Holdsworth, appointed in the same year) his remuneration in his first year was a miserable &pound;25 14<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. Pollard's inaugural lecture contained a withering attack on the city of London for neglecting its university, and on the university for neglecting history. It also contained a manifesto for the establishment and expansion of the subject, not least at the postgraduate level. Sir Charles Firth had attempted to create a doctoral programme on the Germanic pattern in Oxford, but with very mixed success, and Pollard believed that London, home to the Public Record Office and the British Museum, was better placed to foster a postgraduate school of historical research. In the early 1920s, when 250 undergraduates were reading history, his dream was realized in the Institute of Historical Research (IHR), of which he was the only begetter, with the help of a &pound;20,000 contribution from a neighbour in Putney, Sir John Cecil Power. In three parliamentary elections of the early 1920s, Pollard stood unsuccessfully as Liberal candidate for the University of London, opposed, as the Labour candidate, by H. G. Wells.<br>
<br>It is hard to imagine what the condition of academic history in Britain in the twentieth century would have been without the IHR, which Pollard directed from its foundation until his retirement, after which he continued as honorary director until 1939. From its first year of life, the institute reached across the Atlantic, where Pollard had good contacts, and became home to an annual Anglo-American conference of historians, which still flourishes. It is equally hard to think of history without the Historical Association, which Pollard was instrumental in founding in 1906, and of which he was an early president, for the association has always made an invaluable bridge between teachers of history in schools and universities. In 1916 Pollard persuaded the Historical Association to acquire a derelict periodical, <span class="italic">History</span>, which he edited for six years, raising it to a high level of quality, circulation, and influence. As director of the institute, he was also responsible for founding and editing its house journal, the <span class="italic">Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research</span> (now <span class="italic">Historical Research</span>).<br>
<br>A version of Pollard's inaugural was included, with other lectures, in <span class="italic">Factors in Modern History</span> (1910), where his ideas about the shape and meaning of history are best encountered. (He also wrote on <span class="italic">Factors in American History</span>, 1925.) <span class="italic">Factors</span> was not, he explained, &#145;yet another of those miserable text-books of English history, which may be necessary but are certainly evil&#146;  (<span class="italic">Factors in Modern History</span>, 1), putting knowledge before understanding. (Yet in the same year Pollard published a very fine textbook indeed, his <span class="italic">History of England from the Accession of Edward VI to the Death of Elizabeth</span>, the sixth volume of Hunt and Poole's <span class="italic">Political History of England</span>!) Pollard's understanding of history is suggested by some of the chapter titles in <span class="italic">Factors</span>: &#145;Nationality&#146;, &#145;The advent of the middle class&#146;, &#145;The new monarchy&#146;, &#145;Henry VIII and the English Reformation&#146;, &#145;Parliament&#146;. For the most part, Pollard addressed these &#145;factors&#146; in the context of Tudor England, although in his Darwinian&#150;whiggish <span class="italic">The Evolution of Parliament</span> (1920) he ventured back into earlier centuries. Pollard was responsible for the dominance of Tudor history in London, and of London in Tudor history, from his advent at the beginning of the century until about 1960. It was, supremely, in the reign of Henry VIII that Pollard's factors coincided and interacted to set England on its predestined course towards greatness and a kind of political perfection. Either his best or his second-best book was his <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span> (1902). (He also wrote a book on <span class="italic">England under Protector Somerset</span>, 1900, and, what some regard as his masterpiece, the Ford lectures of 1927&#150;8, which became <span class="italic">Wolsey</span>, 1929.) Sir Geoffrey Elton wrote that Pollard almost worshipped Henry VIII, whom he saw as a statesman of superb judgement, great subtlety, long vision and deep insight, and virtually invariable success, profoundly at one with the nation's destiny: opinions which Elton thought &#145;bemused&#146;, but which were no doubt to be expected of an Asquithian Liberal born in 1869.<br>
<br>Pollard's bible, without which none of this would have been written, was the thirty-five huge volumes containing the <span class="italic">Letters and Papers of Henry VIII</span>, an enterprise begun by J. S. Brewer of King's College, London, not long before Pollard was born, and still incomplete when he published his <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span>. <span class="italic">Letters and Papers</span> remains indispensable, and no other reign in English history is serviced by anything like it. However, today's Tudor historians go behind &#145;<span class="italic">L and P</span>&#146; to the original documents, mostly but by no means all to be found in the Public Record Office, on which it was based. Pollard's lack of dependence upon manuscripts has sometimes been exaggerated. Elton alleged that he had rarely darkened the doors of the PRO, and wrote &#145;Pollard, to put it bluntly, did not use manuscripts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Studies in Tudor and Stuart Politics and Government</span>, 1, 1974, 113), which was one of the causes of the rift between Elton and Pollard's pupil Sir John Neale, who remained ever faithful to his old master. But it is certainly true that the narrative pace of Pollard's biographies would have been held up by the minute investigation of problems which the chronological ordering of the documents in <span class="italic">Letters and Papers</span> tended to obscure, and which Elton spent his life sorting out.<br>
<br>There is little affection shown for Pollard in the obituaries and other memoirs written about him. No doubt he enjoyed the exercise of power, and A. G. Dickens has remarked that he &#145;seldom proved receptive of opinions which diverged from his own&#146;  (Dickens, <span class="italic">Wolsey</span>, xiii), while G. N. Clark wrote that &#145;as a teacher he relied rather on force than on sympathy&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). There is no risk of Pollard being made the patron saint of university teachers of history, for in his inaugural lecture he attacked the principle of academic tenure and recommended hiring lecturers for a year at a time at &pound;100 each. He received many academic honours, including honorary doctorates from the universities of Manchester, London, and Oxford. He became a fellow of the British Academy in 1920 and a corresponding member of the Acad&eacute;mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1930. But he was not covetous of public distinctions, and is said to have declined the knighthood which was offered to him at about the time of his retirement.<br>
<br>The Pollards had two children: a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47614/', "(Henry) Graham Pollard")</script>, the bibliographer, and a daughter, who married Harold Edgeworth Butler, professor of Latin at University College. Catherine Pollard died in 1934, and in 1942 Pollard married Marjorie, daughter of Thomas Orchardson, a silk merchant of Bingley, Yorkshire. Since his retirement, Pollard had lived at Milford-on-Sea; he died at the Old Manor, Salisbury, on 3 August 1948. His second wife survived him.<br>
