<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dickinson,  Lowes Cato</span>  (1819&#150;1908), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born on 27 November 1819 at Kilburn, London, one of seven sons and four daughters of Joseph Dickinson, stationer and lithograph publisher, and his wife, Anne Carter of Topsham, Devon. He was educated at Topsham School and Dr Lord's school, Tooting, Surrey, and began earning a living working for his father's Bond Street business from the age of sixteen. In later correspondence Dickinson alludes to &#145;circumstances&#146; that &#145;prevented [him] from following the bent of [his] inclination in early life&#146;  (letter to John Thompson, 10 March 1851, Dickinson, 62). One such circumstance may have been the administration of a drawing academy Dickinson had established with his brother Robert, which was attended by Ford Madox Brown in 1848.<br>
<br>With the help of Captain (later General) Robert Michael Laffan, Dickinson travelled to Italy where he lived from November 1850 to June 1853. His desire to be a practising artist was often quelled by a &#145;morning's reflection &hellip; that I have begun to paint too late in life&#146;  (Dickinson, 40). However, Dickinson remained optimistic, filling his correspondence with vivid descriptions of Rome and Genoa, anecdotes of the more interesting people he encountered, and reflections on Italian culture. The more rigorous practice of Catholicism in Rome led him to &#145;quite respect, esteem and honor&#146; Roman Catholicism in England as the &#145;essence of purity and good sense&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>On returning to London in 1853 Dickinson took a studio in Langham Chambers. According to Dante Gabriel Rossetti, his rooms were more handsome than those later acquired by John Everett Millais. When not working in his studio, Dickinson visited at Weybridge, Surrey, the early Christian socialist Archibald Campbell, whom he had met and befriended in Italy. In 1851 Campbell acquainted Dickinson with F. D. Maurice's plans to establish a college for working men. The Christian socialist ideals espoused by Maurice changed Dickinson's &#145;ideal of life&#146;: &#145;the life of pleasure was not a noble, and might be a very useless one&#146;  (Davies, 26). He joined the lawyer Tom Hughes, the writer Charles Kingsley, Maurice, and others as founding members of the London Working Men's College. Together with Ruskin, Dickinson conducted the first art classes, which met on Thursday evenings, from seven to nine o'clock. These classes were subdivided into three sections shortly after Rossetti began teaching at the college in 1855; Dickinson and Ruskin taught elementary and landscape classes, while Rossetti taught figure and colour drawing. Dickinson was characterized by J. P. Emslie as &#145;an influence for good in the midst of a somewhat disturbed atmosphere&#146;  (ibid., 46). He &#145;never indulged in the profuse praise of which his two colleagues were so liberal, but would point out to a student the very spot in his drawing which was weak, and then show him how to amend it&#146;  (ibid., 47).<br>
<br>On 15 October 1857 Dickinson married Margaret Ellen (<i>d</i>. 1882), daughter of William Smith Williams, literary adviser to the publisher George Smith, at All Souls Church, St Marylebone, London, and enjoyed a happy and active family life. In 1864 they took a cottage at Hanwell, Essex, where they lived until 1879. Dickinson continued teaching for some eleven or twelve years after Ruskin retired, during which time Madox Brown, Stacy Marks, Cave Thomas, Edward Burne-Jones, V. Prinsep, and Arthur Hughes also came to teach.<br>
<br>Despite his experience as a teacher, Dickinson often doubted his competence, and struggled with his own limitations as a painter which he felt imposed limits on his teaching. Emslie noted, however, that while in the classroom &#145;in a couple of hours he would have painted a picture some eighteen inches square &hellip; a picture full of colour, light and texture&#146;  (ibid., 47&#150;8). He also possessed a &#145;gift for posthumous portraiture in crayons&#146;  (Dickinson, vi). He painted many portraits of writers including George Eliot (1872; NPG), the politician Richard Cobden (NPG), lawyers, divines, and men of letters and science. He is perhaps best-known for his portraits of Maurice (1862; London Working Men's College), Charles Kingsley (1862; NPG), and Tom Hughes (1862; London Working Men's College), painted for the college. His first portraits of these close friends and colleagues were completed in 1858 at the request of the publisher Alexander Macmillan, who also sat to Dickinson for a portrait in crayons. His portrait of General Gordon at Khartoum hung in the Gordon Boys' Home, Worthing; that of George Peabody, merchant and founder of the Peabody Institute, is now in the Peabody Institute, Schapiro House, Johns Hopkins University, Maryland. Dickinson regularly exhibited portraits at the Royal Academy from 1848 to 1891. Through his friend Augustus Vansittart he established a connection with Cambridge, where many of his portraits hung in college halls.<br>
<br>In 1860 Dickinson took an active part in the formation of the Artists' volunteer rifle corps, of which he was treasurer. In 1879 he built a house, 1 All Souls Place, off Portland Place, St Marylebone, London, where he lived until his death there on 15 December 1908. He was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. His children and colleagues remembered the &#145;tender expression of his eyes and tones of his gentle voice&#146;, his &#145;beautiful face, white hair and beard&#146;  (Dickinson, vi). C. P. Lucas wrote that &#145;If ever a man had and kept to the end, the heart of a little child, it was Mr. Lowes Dickinson &hellip; He saw beauty and goodness in everything&#146;  (Lucas, 27&#150;8). In 1909 his two sons and five daughters founded the Lowes Dickinson memorial studentship at the London Working Men's College for the study of art abroad. His portrait of his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32815/', "Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson (1862&#150;1932)")</script>, scholar, is in the National Portrait Gallery. His other son was the accountant <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46880/', "Sir Arthur Lowes Dickinson (1859&#150;1935)")</script>.<br>
