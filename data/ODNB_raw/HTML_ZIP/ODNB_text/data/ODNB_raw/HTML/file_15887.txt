<span class="headword">Laing,  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1530&#150;1594), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, was born in the diocese of St Andrews. According to Thomas Dempster he died at the age of ninety-three and was therefore born in 1500 or 1501, but the course of his career makes a date of birth about 1530 more credible. Having probably studied at King's College, Aberdeen, he continued his studies at the University of Paris, where he applied himself to theology and took holy orders. In the university records he is described as a Scot, of the diocese of St Andrews, and of the German nation. On 20 October 1556 he was elected procurator of his nation, entitling him to represent it in the rector's court, the governing body of the university. This honour was conferred on him on many later occasions&#151;on 27 August 1558, 27 October 1560, 10 February 1561, at some date in 1564, on 14 January 1571, and in 1590. He was also quaestor (bursar) on 21 October 1568. In September 1571 he was described as bachelor of theology, but was doctor by the date of his first book in 1581. He preached during several years in Paris. Jean de Rouen, privy councillor, royal almoner, rector, and censor of the university, in a treatise on the Sorbonne, mentions Laing in very laudatory terms.<br>
<br>A lifelong Catholic, Laing was a violent enemy of the Reformation, and very insulting in his personal attacks on the reformers. In 1581 he wrote <span class="italic">De vita et moribus atque rebus gestis haereticorum nostri temporis</span>. The notices of Calvin and three others are translated from the French of J.-H. Bolsec's <span class="italic">Histoire des vies des quatre principaux h&eacute;r&eacute;tiques de nostre temps</span> (1580). There were two editions in 1581, dedicated to Queen Mary and James VI, translated into German in 1582 at Ingolstadt. Laing's first sentence regarding Knox concludes, &#145;ab initio suae pueritiae omni genere turpissimi facinoris infectus fuit&#146; (&#145;from his earliest childhood he was infected with every kind of the basest ill doing&#146;; p. 113 and verso). In 1585 he wrote a second treatise, based on Bolsec's <span class="italic">Histoire de la vie de Th&eacute;odore de B&egrave;ze</span> (1582), <span class="italic">De vita et moribus Theodori Bezae, omnium haereticorum nostri temporis facile principis, et aliorum haereticorum brevis recitatio, cui adjectus est libellus de morte patris Edmundi Campionis et aliorum quorundam Catholicorum qui in Anglia pro fide catholica interfecti fuerunt, primo die Decembris, anno domini 1581, authore Jacobo Laingeo, doctore Sorbonico</span>. The Campion work translated here appeared in Lyons in 1582 and Laing's book is, like his first, dedicated jointly to Queen Mary and to James VI. He is said to have written other unpublished works of a less polemical nature, including a commentary on Aristotle's philosophy, which Dempster claims he saw in manuscript with the author shortly before his death. Laing's name is appended to a document in the form of an oath of fealty signed and addressed by the principal members of the Paris faculties to Henri IV on his accession (22 April 1594). He died during this year, and was buried, according to his wish, in the chapel of the Sorbonne.<br>
