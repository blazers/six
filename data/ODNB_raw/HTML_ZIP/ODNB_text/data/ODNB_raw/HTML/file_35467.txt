<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Penrose,  Francis Cranmer</span>  (1817&#150;1903), <span class="occ">architect, classical archaeologist, and astronomer</span>, was born on 29 October 1817 at Bracebridge, near Lincoln, the youngest son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21891/', "Revd John Penrose (1778&#150;1859)")</script>. His mother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21889/', "Elizabeth Penrose, n&#233;e Cartwright (c.1779&#150;1837)")</script>, a children's writer under the pseudonym of Mrs Markham, and Francis was the original of the Mary in her <span class="italic">History of England</span>. Penrose's second name was a claim to direct descent through his mother from the sister of Archbishop Cranmer presaging his life-long protestant evangelical Anglican beliefs. His aunt Mary Penrose was the wife of Thomas Arnold, headmaster of Rugby School. He was educated at Bedford modern school (1825&#150;9) and was a scholar at Winchester College (1829&#150;35). His early drawing skills led him (1835&#150;9) to the office of the architect Edward Blore. But instead of starting architectural practice, at the age of twenty-two he became an undergraduate at Magdalene College, Cambridge, graduating in mathematics as tenth senior optime in 1842. A noted athlete, he more than once walked in one day from Cambridge to London, and skated from Ely to the Wash. He rowed against Oxford, in 1840, 1841, and 1842, and was captain of the Cambridge University Boat Club in 1841. As captain of his college boat, he brought it to nearly head of the river. He was the inventor of the system of charts in the bumping races, which are still in use for registering the relative positions of crews. Among his friends while an undergraduate were the novelist and clergyman Charles Kingsley, almost a contemporary at Magdalene, through whom he came to know the theologian Frederick Denison Maurice, the chemist Charles Blachford Mansfield, the social activist John Malcolm Ludlow, and the astronomer John Couch Adams, who with George Peacock awakened an interest in astronomy. As a young man he saw much of his first cousin Matthew Arnold at Rugby, where his brother was a schoolmaster.<br>
<br>In 1842 Penrose was appointed travelling bachelor of the University of Cambridge and began an important European architectural tour (1842&#150;5). Already a skilled draughtsman, he learnt the art of watercolour from Peter DeWint. He made his first prolonged halt at Paris, where he visited the observatory, as well as architectural scenes. At Paris, and subsequently at Chartres, Fontainebleau, Sens, Auxerre, Bourges, Avignon, N&icirc;mes, and Arles, he sketched and studied industriously. At Rome in 1843 his keen eye criticized the pitch of the pediment of the Pantheon as being &#145;steeper than I quite like&#146;, a comment subsequently justified by further research. Fifty-two years later M. Chedanne of Paris read a paper in London (at a meeting over which Penrose presided) and proved that the pitch of the pediment in fact had been altered. Penrose stayed six months at Rome, and thence wrote the stipulated Latin letter as travelling bachelor to the University of Cambridge. He chose as his theme the (Gothic) cathedral of Bourges.<br>
<br>Between June 1843 and spring 1844 Penrose visited the chief cities of Italy. He later started somewhat reluctantly for Greece, describing Athens as &#145;by far the most miserable town of its size I have ever seen&#146; (9 January 1845). But he soon fell under the spell of the &#145;Pericleian Monuments&#146;, to which his initial enthusiasm for Gothic architecture quickly gave way. In August 1845 he made his way home through Switzerland, Augsburg, Munich, and Cologne.<br>
<br>Already Penrose realized the importance of exact mensuration to a critical study of Greek architecture. The pamphlet on the subject by John Pennethorne had already attracted his attention on its publication in 1844. On his arrival in England, the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92790', "Society of Dilettanti")</script> had determined to test thoroughly Pennethorne's theories as to the measurements of Greek classical buildings, and they commissioned Penrose to undertake the task on their behalf. In 1846 Penrose was again at Athens. His principal collaborator in the work of measurement there was Thomas Willson of Lincoln. Their work was completed in May 1847. Despite corrections in detail Penrose confirmed in essentials Pennethorne's theories. When in 1878 Pennethorne brought out his <span class="italic">Geometry and Optics of Ancient Architecture</span> he adopted with due acknowledgement Penrose's mass of indisputable material.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Anomalies in the Construction of the Parthenon</span>, which the Society of Dilettanti published in 1847, was the first result of Penrose's labours, but it was in 1851 that there appeared his monumental work, <span class="italic">Principles of Athenian Architecture</span>, of which a more complete edition was issued in 1888 on which his international reputation as a classical archaeologist is based. Penrose's exhaustive and minutely accurate measurements finally established that what is apparently parallel or straight in Greek architecture of the Periclean period is generally neither straight nor parallel but curved or inclined. He therefore solved the puzzle which all commentators on Vitruvius had found insoluble by identifying the &#145;scamilli impares&#146; with those top and bottom blocks of the columns which, by virtue of the inclination of the column or the curvature of stylobate and architrave, are &#145;unequal&#146; (i.e. they have their upper and lower faces out of parallel). Some important conclusions relating to the Roman temple of Jupiter Olympius at Athens, Penrose laid before the Institute of British Architects in 1888.<br>
<br>In 1852 Penrose succeeded C. R. Cockerell (who recommended him) as surveyor of St Paul's Cathedral. The appointment, technically with a view to the completion of the interior decoration in accordance with the intentions of Wren, was made impossible by the religious and artistic factionalism of the day, as shown in the attempts to restore the interior after various appeals. William Burges was even appointed as joint architect (1872&#150;8) for one of these. As surveyor of St Paul's, Penrose was one of the few British architects to adhere to the classical style in the second half of the nineteenth century. He began to introduce Munich stained glass (des.), &#145;Roman&#146; mosaic pavements, and furniture such as the large early Christian style pulpit (1860; dem. 1954). He demolished Wren's choir screen, divided the organ into two, and provided new choir stalls and desks. Of the two internal porches made from Wren's woodwork, only that at the south transept survives. Externally, he restored (1872) the square plan and divided layout of Wren's west-front steps and made the setting of the Queen Anne statue (1886). He defended the sculptor Alfred Stevens's proposal for the Wellington monument, for which he claimed &#145;general superintendence&#146; (1858&#150;79) finally erecting it in the nave (1893). Penrose had married in 1856 Harriette (<i>d</i>. 1903), daughter of Francis Gibbes, surgeon, of Harewood, Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Like Wren himself Penrose found relief from disappointment at St Paul's in astronomical study, which had already attracted him at Cambridge and in Paris. He was adept at mechanical inventions, and an instrument for drawing spirals won him a prize at the Great Exhibition of 1851. A theodolite which he had bought in 1852 primarily for use in measurement of buildings, he applied at the suggestion of Dr G. Boole to such astronomical purposes as accurate determination of orientation and time in connection, for example, with the fixing of sundials. In 1862 came the purchase of a small astronomical telescope which was soon superseded by a larger one with a 5&frac12; inch object-glass (Steinheil), equatorially mounted by Troughton and Simms. In 1866 Penrose, finding the prediction of the time of an occultation of Saturn in the <span class="italic">Nautical Almanac</span> inadequate for his purpose, endeavoured with success &#145;to obtain by graphical construction a more exact correspondence suited to the site&#146; of the observer. He published his results in 1869 in <span class="italic">The Prediction and Reduction of Occultations and Eclipses</span>, and the work reached a second edition in 1902.<br>
<br>In 1870 Penrose visited J&eacute;rez in the south of Spain to view the total eclipse of the sun with his smaller (2&frac14; inch) instrument. The observation was spoilt by a cloud, but Penrose made the acquaintance of Professor Charles A. Young of America, whom he met again at Denver in 1878. Penrose's observations on the eclipse of 29 July 1878 in Denver, when his principal object was to draw the corona, were published in the <span class="italic">Monthly Notices, Royal Astronomical Society</span>, 39 (1878&#150;9), 48&#150;51. He afterwards extended to comets the graphical method of prediction that he had applied to the moon (cf. his paper before the Royal Astronomical Society, December 1881, and chapter 6 in G. F. Chambers's <span class="italic">Handbook of Astronomy</span>, 4th edn, 3 vols., 1889).<br>
<br>Penrose's last astronomical work was a study of the orientation of temples, to which Sir Norman Lockyer directed his attention. Presuming that &#145;the object sought by the ancients in orienting their temples was to obtain from the stars at their rising or setting, as the case might be, a sufficient warning of the approach of dawn for preparation for the critical moment of sacrifice&#146;, he perceived the importance of calculating the places of certain stars at distant epochs, and the possibility of estimating the age of certain temples by assuming an orientation and calculating the period of variation or apparent movement in the stars due to the precession of the equinoxes. Penrose applied his theory to certain Greek temples (see <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> and <span class="italic">Philosophic Transactions of the Royal Society</span>), and with Lockyer he worked out a calculation on this basis in relation to Stonehenge (see also <span class="italic">Journal of Proceedings of the Royal Institute of British Architects</span>, 25 Jan 1902). He joined the Royal Astronomical Society in 1867, and in 1894 his astronomical researches were recognized by his election as a fellow of the Royal Society.<br>
<br>Penrose's practice as an architect was small, largely church-based. It did not reflect his obvious ability. At Magdalene College, Cambridge, he restored the west front (1873&#150;4; unpicked 1954) and built the river court gate; he built a wing&#151;the Penrose&#151;at St John's College, Cambridge (1885&#150;6); and at Rugby School he erected the sanatorium (1867). His many vicarages began with Burleigh, Somerset (1846); typically a vicarage might be related to a church restoration as at Escribe, Yorkshire (1849; church 1850). He designed a private house in Wimbledon to be shared by Thomas Hughes and Ian Ludlow (1852&#150;3; dem.) and one in Colebyfield (1861&#150;2) for himself. Alford House, Somerset (<i>c</i>.1877), was his only commission of country-house scale. His neo-baroque staircase projects (1860&#150;88) for Ickworth House, Suffolk, were not executed; his garden terrace and stairs at Powerscourt House, co. Wicklow, Ireland (1874&#150;5), are related. At Ickworth he was responsible finally for the Pompeian room (1878&#150;9) painted by J. D. Crace. The town hall, Castle Cary, Somerset (1834&#150;5), in a rationalist neo-Tudor Gothic, shows where his practice might have developed otherwise.<br>
<br>When in 1882 the foundation of the British School at Athens was projected, Penrose generously designed the building (a Graeco-Roman villa, 1885&#150;6) without fee. It was completed in 1886, when Penrose accepted the directorate (1886&#150;7 and 1890&#150;91). At St Paul's, from where he practised, he designed the choir school (1873&#150;5), Italianate, decorated externally in neo-Renaissance sgraffitto and polychromy. His surviving contribution is the massive Cornish porphyry sarcophagus on a granite plinth tomb of the duke of Wellington (1857) &#145;based on a small sketch by Cockerell, but I had complete charge of the detail and execution&#146;, he wrote. Also his are the Roman mosaic floor here and under the crossing around Nelson's tomb, the marble alterations, and wall tablet (1891) to Lord Napier of Magdala.<br>
<br>Penrose was an associate (1846), fellow (1848), and president (1894&#150;6) of the Royal Institute of British Architects and he received the royal gold medal of the institute in 1883. Many of his office drawings and his own manuscript list of works were presented to RIBA in 1938. He became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1898, when he was elected antiquary to the Royal Academy, where he had often exhibited. He was made in 1884 one of the first honorary fellows of Magdalene College, Cambridge, and in 1898 he became a LittD of his university as well as an honorary DCL of Oxford. He was a knight of the order St Saviour of Greece. Penrose's portrait at the Royal Institute of British Architects is one of the most characteristic works of J. S. Sargent RA (a copy is at Magdalene College).<br>
<br>Penrose died at Colebyfield, Wimbledon, after forty years' residence on 15 February 1903. He was buried at Wimbledon. His wife predeceased him by twelve days. He left a son, Dr Francis G. Penrose, and four daughters, the eldest of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35466/', "Emily Penrose (1858&#150;1942)")</script>, became successively principal of Bedford College, Royal Holloway College, and Somerville College, Oxford. A lettered memorial tablet was placed in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral by his architectural admirers.<br>
