<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Froissart,  Jean</span>  (1337?&#150;<em>c.</em>1404), <span class="occ">historian and poet</span>, was born at Valenciennes in the county of Hainault, at a date now generally assumed to be late 1337. Details on his family and education are problematic; his father may have been a herald&#150;painter, but it is more likely that he had an industrial or bourgeois background. Allusions in Froissart's voluminous poetry suggest a happy childhood in comfortable circumstances, but he never mentions his parents or any siblings. His contemporary fame and fortune were due to his intelligence and skill as a writer, admired by successive patrons who encouraged and sustained his endeavours.<h2>
<a name="Earlypatronsandearlytravels"></a>Early patrons and early travels</h2>The first to recognize Froissart's talents was probably Jean de Hainault, seigneur de Beaumont (<i>d</i>. 1356), who fought in the Anglo-Scottish wars at the beginning of Edward III's reign, and whose niece, Philippa, married the king. By the age of twenty, Froissart, already under the influence of Jean le Bel, whose chronicle recounting, <i>inter alia</i>, Beaumont's exploits, he later plagiarized almost entirely, had begun to collect material for his historical work. He later did this especially by travel and conversation with those whose knightly deeds he recounted. An early journey was to Avignon towards the end of the pontificate of Innocent VI (<i>r</i>. 1352&#150;62). But it was the period 1361&#150;8 in England, where he claims to have been a <i>clerc de la chambre</i> of Queen Philippa, to whom he presented a now lost rhyming chronicle of events between 1356 and 1360, that marked a key stage in his development as a professional poet and writer. It provided him with contacts and a clientele that remained influential throughout his life. These English links, and the value of his chronicles for the Anglo-French wars of his day, will be particularly stressed here, though Froissart was known and his works read by contemporaries throughout the medieval West.<br>
<br>In England Froissart met not only leading knights like Bartholomew, Lord Burghersh (<i>d</i>. 1369), at the royal court when Edward III was at the height of his powers, but also many important French prisoners from the battle of Poitiers and hostages for the treaty of Br&eacute;tigny&#150;Calais (1360), including Gui, count of Blois, a future patron. He personally witnessed the departure of Edward, the Black Prince, for Guyenne in 1362 and the return to captivity in London in February 1364 of Jean II of France, before accompanying the latter's body for burial in France two months later. He was at Dover in October 1364 when (a favourite ploy) he was able to interview the herald who brought news of the Anglo-Breton victory (29 September) at Auray in Brittany. These years also saw his first surviving lyrical poetry in the style of Guillaume de Machaut: <span class="italic">Le paradis d'amour</span> (<i>c</i>.1361&#150;2), <span class="italic">Le joli mois de mai</span> (<i>c</i>.1363), the <span class="italic">Dit dou bleu chevalier</span> (written for the hostage duke of Berri), and the <span class="italic">Dit de la marguerite</span> (<i>c</i>.1364), in which some see reference to an unrequited love for a certain Marguerite, a theme that recurs in some later verse (for example, <span class="italic">L'espinette amoureuse</span>, <i>c</i>.1369&#150;70).<br>
<br>An important experience was a journey to Scotland between May and October 1365. Travelling probably via Carlisle (identified later with the Caerleon of King Arthur) and Lochmaben, and returning via Berwick, Froissart stayed in &#145;le sauvage Escosse&#146; with David II at Edinburgh. He then visited Dalkeith, Roxburgh, Stirling, Perth, Kildrummy, and Aberdeen, the jetty of which is described in his long Arthurian epic poem <span class="italic">Meliador</span> (30,000 lines), a first draft of which was probably penned shortly afterwards, while a humorous <span class="italic">Debat dou cheval et dou levrier</span>, in which the author's horse and dog discuss their services in Scotland, was also inspired by this journey.<h2>
<a name="IntheserviceofQueenPhilippa"></a>In the service of Queen Philippa</h2>During a brief visit to Brabant at Easter 1366, perhaps as part of a diplomatic mission regarding Queen Philippa's family concerns, Froissart first made contact with the duke and duchess. This was followed by a tour of the west country with Edward Despenser (<i>d</i>. 1375), including a brief stop at Berkeley Castle in the late summer, before he set out, via Nantes and La Rochelle, for Bordeaux. Here he arrived in time to keep Christmas with the Black Prince, Princess Joan, and their court, and to witness the baptism of the future Richard II at Epiphany 1367. By then preparations were advanced for the prince's expedition to Spain in support of Pedro of Castile that culminated in their crushing defeat of Pedro's bastard brother, Enrique de Trastamara, at N&aacute;jera (3 April 1367), on which the chronicler later wrote at length. But he did not see this battle (nor, it appears, any others) at first hand since, although he accompanied the prince as far as Dax in February, he was then instructed to return to England with other messengers.<br>
<br>Froissart's last major journey under the patronage of Queen Philippa was again with Edward Despenser in the company of Edward III's second son, Lionel, duke of Clarence, going to Italy to marry Violante Visconti. The party reached Paris on 16 April 1368 and, passing through Bourg-en-Bresse and Chamb&eacute;ry, where contacts were made with the court of Savoy, finally reached Milan where the marriage took place on 5 June. Another in the party was Geoffrey Chaucer, and it is possible that they met Petrarch on this occasion. Despite Lionel's death only a few months later, Froissart seized the opportunity to see other places&#151;Bologna (where he met Pierre de Lusignan, king of Cyprus), Ferrara, and Rome&#151;before returning across the Alps with Guichard d'Angle, earl of Huntingdon (<i>d</i>. 1380). News of Queen Philippa's death on 15 August 1369, received at Brussels, forestalled his return to England and led him to seek a new patron. On 29 August the duchess of Brabant purchased &#145;a new book in French&#146; (perhaps <span class="italic">Meliador</span> or <span class="italic">L'orloge amoureus</span>) from him and he spent much of the next fifteen years in Brabant. There he began, at the request of Robert de Namur, the first prose redaction of book 1 of the chronicles on which his enduring reputation stands; it was completed in 1373.<br>
<br>Froissart also continued to write much poetry in varied styles&#151;one poem celebrates the release of Wenceslas of Brabant from captivity (<span class="italic">Entre Binch et le Bos de Haine</span>, after 21 June 1372); some of Wenceslas's own verses were included in <span class="italic">Meliador</span>; among his most important <i>dits</i> were <span class="italic">L'espinette amoureuse</span>, <span class="italic">La prison amoureuse</span> (1371&#150;2), and <span class="italic">Le joli buisson de Jonece</span> (1373). References in Brabantine accounts make it possible to trace his career in some detail. In 1372 he was in debt to certain Lombards; by 19 September 1373, renouncing chances of marriage by taking holy orders, he had become <i>cur&eacute;</i> of Estinnes-au-Mont in the diocese of Cambrai, worth 40 livres p.a., by gift of the duke of Brabant, and in the following year he received a further ducal grant for &#145;certain things which he has delivered to us&#146;  (Wilkins, 265). In 1377 a copy of <span class="italic">Meliador</span> was being bound at Brussels and a new version was prepared <i>c</i>.1380; payment in 1382 for &#145;a book which [Froissart] made for my lord [of Brabant]&#146;  (ibid., 265) may refer to this new edition. <span class="italic">Meliador</span> was again revised in 1389.<h2>
<a name="Thehistorianandhiswork"></a>The historian and his work</h2>Increasingly, however, Froissart's attention turned to his narrative of the Anglo-French wars since 1327, and this absorbed most of his remaining working life. By 1376 he had begun a revision of book 1. As time passed he also extended the work's concluding date and, besides continuing to gather oral information, he drew on other written accounts like the Chandos herald's <span class="italic">Life of the Black Prince</span> or the <span class="italic">Grandes Chroniques de France</span>, and occasionally consulted administrative or diplomatic documents. This process of compilation, adaptation, and revision (partly reflecting changes in patronage or the interests of his intended audience, and gradually moving from a position largely sympathetic to the English cause to a more French standpoint) continued for thirty years, by which time Froissart had created a gigantic panorama of (chiefly martial) events in the British Isles, France, Spain, the Low Countries, and sometimes even further afield, from 1327 to 1400, totalling about 3 million words in all. It has also created many still unresolved problems for establishing the order and chronology of the several different and overlapping recensions that survive in about 100 major manuscript copies. These pose, too, many questions about his art as a writer as well as his value as a historian of his times.<br>
<br>To summarize detailed arguments very crudely: it is accepted that following the completion of book 1 (1373, revised from 1376), book 2, covering the years 1377&#150;85 (and so including Froissart's well-known account of the peasants' revolt), was written at the request of Gui, count of Blois (<i>d</i>. 1394), and was essentially finished in 1387; there is also a later recension of this book. Book 3, containing some of the most dazzling passages of writing in the whole work and covering 1385&#150;9, was completed between 1390 and 1392, while book 4, for the years 1389 to 1400, was finished about 1400. At the same time, a third recension of book 1, thoroughly reworked but only covering the period 1327 to 1350, was also finished <i>c</i>.1400. By this stage Froissart's considerable skills as an inventive and imaginative writer had been honed to perfection; strict accuracy of historical detail seldom stands in his way if he could shape a pithy phrase, mould an account or make a moralistic point for dramatic effect. Thus despite an often apparently artless simplicity, combined with cleverly observed descriptive or visual detail for verisimilitude and great subtlety of characterization, his narrative is deceptively sophisticated and demands careful attention to its many different registers if its full implications and meaning are to be understood. How he achieved this result is only partly explained by what is known of the latter stages of his life.<h2>
<a name="Thecosmopolitantraveller"></a>The cosmopolitan traveller</h2>In November 1380 Froissart accompanied Wenceslas of Brabant to Rheims for the coronation of Charles VI. Evidence for the growing popularity and knowledge of his work in French aristocratic circles comes a year later, ironically when some of his writings being copied in Paris were confiscated on the orders of Louis, duke of Anjou, possibly in revenge for Froissart's criticism of the duke's breaking parole in 1362, in his <span class="italic">Dit dou bleu chevalier</span>. Another personal loss was the death of Wenceslas of Brabant in December 1383; by 1384 Froissart had become chaplain to Gui de Blois and was appointed a canon of Chimay and, later, of Lille as well. He served the count for the next decade, frequently visiting Blois and accompanying him to family occasions like the betrothal of Louis de Blois to Marie de Berry (on 29 March 1386) and their marriage at Bourges in August. He also witnessed other important political and military developments or sought out leading participants to garner their testimony. Hence in 1386 he went to Sluys to see the fleet assembled for an invasion of England, and in 1387 he travelled to Ghent to gather material on the city's recent revolutionary past. A visit to Angers in 1388 allowed him to talk to Guillaume d'Ancenis about events in Brittany in the 1340s. In the same year, most notably, he made a prolonged tour through southern France, <i>en route</i> for the court of one of the most colourful princes of his day, Gaston de Foix (Ph&eacute;bus), count of Foix, arriving at Orthez in B&eacute;arn on 25 November. Here he spent ten weeks, rising at midnight to read passages of <span class="italic">Meliador</span> to the count and interviewing old soldiers like the <i>routier</i> Espan de Lion on his adventures, which are recounted in book 3, in some of the most vivid passages of the chronicles.<br>
<br>Renewed contact with English knights came in January 1389, when Froissart went to Bordeaux and witnessed jousts presided over by John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, before returning slowly northwards via Tarbes, Toulouse, and Avignon. At the latter he was robbed, an incident commemorated in one of the last of his poems, <span class="italic">Dit dou florin</span>. He was present at the marriage of the duke of Berri and Jeanne de Boulogne at Riom on 6 June 1389, and was back in Paris for the arrival of Queen Isabella of Bavaria on 22 August. After a brief sojourn in his native Valenciennes, to which he had increasingly returned in recent years, he rejoined Gui de Blois at Schoonhoven. At Middleburg in 1390 he talked to Dom Jo&atilde;o Fernandez Pacheco about recent events in Portugal, and another visit to Paris in June 1392 coincided with the attempted assassination of the constable of France, Olivier de Clisson. In June 1393 the duke of Orl&eacute;ans paid him handsomely for a book of his poems, which he shortly afterwards arranged in definitive chronological order (with the exception of <span class="italic">Meliador</span>). At least two fine manuscript copies of this anthology, written over thirty-four years and prepared under the author's eye, survive, one of which  (Paris, Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, MS Fran&ccedil;ais 831) may be that presented to Richard II in 1395, when Froissart returned to England for the first time since 1368.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsandachievement"></a>Last years and achievement</h2>Froissart arrived in England on 12 July. After paying homage next day at the tomb in Canterbury Cathedral of the Black Prince, in many respects the hero of book 1 of the chronicles, Froissart was granted an interview with the king on 25 July at Eltham, where over thirty years earlier he had seen the prince's prisoner, Jean II of France. Visits followed to Chertsey Abbey, Windsor Castle, and the duke of Gloucester's castle at Pleshey, but Froissart was cruelly disappointed by the changes that had occurred at the English court since his youth, and by the offhand treatment that he received, though some old acquaintances were renewed, most notably with the former diplomat and soldier Sir Richard Stury. Although he left England in October with a large silver goblet and 100 nobles in cash, his memories of this visit were tinged with regrets and nostalgia for a chivalric era that had passed. A last opportunity to meet leading English figures occurred in October 1396 when he attended the marriage of Richard II and Isabella of Valois at St Omer. Now about sixty years old, although continuing to work on recensions of his chronicles, Froissart largely retired from the world, possibly entering the abbey of Cantimpr&eacute; at the gates of Cambrai. Still active in 1400 and probably as late as 1404, he died shortly afterwards, though the date and place of his death remain uncertain. An epitaph at Chimay was allegedly extant as late as 1873 but has since been lost, its details apparently unrecorded. But wherever &#145;Chivalry lifts its lance on high&#146; (Elgar's inscription on the title page of his concert overture &#145;Froissart&#146;), the <span class="italic">Chroniques de France, d'Angleterre et des pais voisins</span>, that remarkable mirror of his age, keep his name green.<br>
