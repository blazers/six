<span class="headword">Cobbold,  Richard</span>  (1797&#150;1877), <span class="occ">novelist and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 9 September 1797 at the manor house in St Margaret's parish, Ipswich, just opposite the church where he was baptized on 8 November. He was the twentieth of twenty-two children of John Cobbold (1746&#150;1835), brewer and banker of Ipswich, and fifth of seven by his second wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5736/', "Elizabeth Cobbold, n&#233;e Knipe (1765&#150;1824)")</script>. Cobbold was educated at Bury St Edmunds under Charles Blomfield, father of the bishop, and went on to spend seven years at King Edward VI Grammar School. He then moved to the Paston School at North Walsham. Here for three years he studied under W. T. Spurdens, proceeding to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, as a pensioner in 1814. There two years later he won a scholarship and graduated BA in 1820, the year he was ordained deacon. He served as curate to his uncle Thomas Cobbold, resident rector at Woolpit, but absentee incumbent at St Mary-le-Tower, Ipswich.<br>
<br>At Hollesley on 27 November 1822 Cobbold married Mary Anne (<i>bap</i>. 1801, <i>d</i>. 1876), the only daughter of Jephtha and Mary Anne Waller. In 1824 John Cobbold purchased the right of presentation of the rich living of Wortham near Diss to provide for them, and Bishop Bathurst licensed Richard Cobbold's absence in Ipswich for the lifetime of the long-serving curate there. Cobbold was popular at the Tower church and enjoyed the social life of Ipswich, so that when in September 1828 the time came to move his wife and young family to the rectory he had built for them at Wortham they felt almost in exile. There they spent the rest of their lives. Their third son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5739/', "Thomas Spencer Cobbold (1828&#150;1886)")</script>, became a scientist, but the two elder sons followed their father into the church. From 1844 to 1869 Cobbold was rural dean of Hartismere.<br>
<br>Much influenced by his late mother's interests and charitable impulses, Cobbold published <span class="italic">Valentine Verses</span> illustrated with his own na&iuml;ve lithographs in 1827 to benefit her favourite charities, but he came to be embarrassed by the critical reception of both poems and pictures. He is best known for his novel <span class="italic">The History of Margaret Catchpole</span> (1845), which romanticized and distorted the already adventurous life of a woman who had been a servant of his parents at about the time of his birth. It was a best-seller, and went into many editions, but Richard had parted with the copyright for only &pound;1000. He wrote and published much else in poetry and prose, none of it great nor for him remunerative, but some in good causes. The novel <span class="italic">Mary Ann Wellington, the Soldier's Daughter, Wife and Widow</span> (1846) did benefit the real Mary Ann. <span class="italic">Freston Tower</span> (1850) is a shallow fictional account of the early days of the Ipswich-born Thomas Wolsey. Cobbold edited <span class="italic">John H. Steggall: a Real History of a Suffolk Man</span> (1857), useful as social history.<br>
<br>Well into middle age, Cobbold indulged in the active pursuits popular with country clergymen. Fiercely partisan for his church, he would employ both inducements and sanctions to keep his flock loyal and his Sunday school full. Because he was nationally celebrated as an author, Cobbold attracted the interest locally of incognito sermon-tasters and journalists who wrote scathingly of his performance. Preaching in 1858, his voice was &#145;deep and very powerful; but his manner we could not help remarking is more pompous than impressive&#146;. &#145;The exordium [of his sermon] was a trite collection of recurrences in Scripture of the words at the commencement of the text&#146;. &#145;He grew verbose and proportionately feeble&#146;  (Gowing, &#145;Suffolk pulpit&#146;). Despite the critics, he worked with devotion among his parishioners.<br>
<br>In 1977 the work likely to prove Cobbold's most enduring monument was published by Batsford in a copiously illustrated edition by Ronald Fletcher, <span class="italic">The Biography of a Victorian Village: Richard Cobbold's Account of Wortham, Suffolk, in 1860</span>. The original manuscripts, illustrated with Cobbold's charming amateur watercolour drawings, are preserved in the Suffolk Record Office. A sense of Cobbold's own isolation is combined with genuine understanding of and affection for all conditions of his parishioners. There is Old Soldier Smith who died in his wheelbarrow, sad Noah Fake, &#145;the Village carpenter&#151;the Village politician&#151;the Village factotum&#151;performing almost all offices and knowing himself to be but a poor performer&#146;  (Fletcher, 131), and Mrs Balding, a &#145;very nice little woman who jumped out of her garrett window deranged and ran over the fields in a state of nudity&#146;  (ibid., 94).<br>
<br>The inspiration for Cobbold's record of his parish was a tragic one. In September 1860 his younger brother Edward, rector of Long Melford, burdened with personal problems, took his own life in a hotel room in Piccadilly. Reflecting on the many times he had walked from rectory to church on duty, Richard felt that as &#145;he was my youngest brother, so I must not expect to walk down many more times&#146;  (Fletcher, 69). It saddened him two years later when he felt bound to sell his right to the living of Wortham to King's College, Cambridge, to raise funds to help his sons to marry. He had another fifteen years to serve, and he left over &pound;12,000 at his death, so ultimately the sale had been unnecessary. For the last year of their lives he and his wife suffered ill health, so that when on 26 December 1876 Mary Anne died aged seventy-five he was not told, and died himself on 5 January 1877. Each was buried after seven days in the churchyard at Wortham.<br>
