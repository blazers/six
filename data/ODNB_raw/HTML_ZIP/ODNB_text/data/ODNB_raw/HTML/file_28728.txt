<span class="headword">Ware,  Isaac</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1704, <em>d.</em> 1766), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in London, where he was baptized in the church of St Giles Cripplegate on 6 March 1704; his father, also Isaac, was a cordwainer (or shoemaker). Ware himself is said to have told the sculptor Roubiliac that he began life as a chimney sweep's boy, and that he was launched on his architectural career when a benevolent gentleman spotted him sketching the Banqueting House in Whitehall with a piece of chalk; the anonymous gentleman, later putatively identified as the third earl of Burlington, had him educated, sent him to Italy, and on his return furthered his career. What is certain is that in 1721, aged seventeen, Ware was apprenticed in the Carpenters' Company to the architect Thomas Ripley, who was shortly afterwards appointed master carpenter to the office of works. Ripley's intervention is likely to have secured for Ware the posts of clerk itinerant, draughtsman, and purveyor at the end of his apprenticeship in 1728. His rise in the office of works continued with clerkships of the works at Windsor Castle (1729&#150;33) and Greenwich (1733&#150;6), and finally the secretaryship of the board of works (1736&#150;66).<br>
<br>Although Ware was thus a senior architectural civil servant of long standing, little or nothing can be attributed to him in this capacity, and his reputation rests on his activities outside the office of works. Whatever the truth of the story supposedly told to Roubiliac, he seems in the earlier years of his career to have been part of Lord Burlington's circle. Having in 1727 subscribed to William Kent's <span class="italic">Designs of Inigo Jones</span> (a volume sponsored by Burlington), in 1731 he published his own <span class="italic">Designs of Inigo Jones and Others</span>, which contained designs by the earl. Ware's translation of Palladio's <span class="italic">Quattro libri dell'architettura</span> (generally considered the best and most reliable English edition), published in 1738, was dedicated to Burlington, and acknowledges his assistance. Another project, reliant on his help, which Ware contemplated but never brought to completion, was a new edition of the Palladio drawings of Roman baths then in Burlington's collection. Other publications were, in 1735, <span class="italic">The Plans, Elevations and Sections of Houghton in Norfolk</span> (on whose construction he had probably worked as assistant to Ripley), and a translation of Lorenzo Sirigatti's <span class="italic">La prattica di prospettiva</span>, brought out serially in 1756&#150;7. The same years also saw the serial publication of Ware's most important book, the massive and compendious <span class="italic">Complete Body of Architecture</span>.<br>
<br>Ware's known output as an architect is relatively small, and much of it has been demolished or drastically altered. It includes the conversion of Lanesborough House, Hyde Park Corner, into St George's Hospital (1733; rebuilt 1828&#150;9), Oxford town hall (1751&#150;2; dem. 1893), Wrotham Park, Hertfordshire (1754; altered 1811 and damaged by fire 1883), and Amisfield House, Haddingtonshire (1756&#150;9; dem. <i>c</i>.1928). His most complete surviving building is Clifton Hill House in Bristol (1746&#150;50), which can be said to have introduced Palladian restraint to the domestic architecture of that city. Other well-preserved Palladian interiors are at Leinster House, Dublin, remodelled about 1759 for the twentieth earl of Kildare; Ware's unexecuted designs for remodelling the earl's seat at Carton are dated 1762. Ware was also involved in speculative developments in London, particularly in Mayfair, and illustrated interior features from a number of the houses in the <span class="italic">Complete Body</span>.<br>
<br>Most of Ware's designs were as Palladian in character as might be expected from an architect of his background and credentials. However, as a prominent member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96317', "St Martin's Lane Academy")</script> he was also a colleague of such rococo artists as Hogarth, Roubiliac, and Francis Hayman: this is reflected not only in the surprisingly latitudinarian views occasionally found in the pages of the <span class="italic">Complete Body</span> but also in the dazzling interiors of his most important work, Chesterfield House, Mayfair (1748&#150;9; dem. 1934), designed in a full-blooded French rococo idiom for the francophile fourth earl of Chesterfield.<br>
<br>Ware was married twice; his first wife, Elizabeth, daughter of James Richards, master carver in the office of works, whom he married on 22 September 1729, bore a son, Walter James Ware. With his second wife, Mary Bolton (who predeceased him), he had two daughters, Mary and Charlotte, one of whom is depicted with him in the portrait by Andrea Soldi now in the RIBA drawings collection. In 1742 Ware bought a small estate at Westbourne Grove, Paddington, and subsequently built himself a new house there. In 1764 he moved to Frognall Hall, Hampstead, where he died on 6 January 1766; he was buried in Paddington Old Church. His skin was said to have retained the stain of the chimney sweep's soot until his dying day.<br>
