<span class="headword">Lowe,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1719&#150;1783), <span class="occ">singer and actor</span>, was probably born in London. His singing career began when he was a child; a benefit was held for him on 27 March 1732, and on 2 May that year he sang in Handel's oratorio <span class="italic">Esther</span> at the King's Theatre.<br>
<br>Lowe was singing professionally as a tenor by 1740, when in August he took part in the performance of the masque <span class="italic">Alfred</span> at Cliveden, the Buckinghamshire residence of Frederick, prince of Wales. <span class="italic">Alfred</span>, written by James Thomson and David Mallet, with music by Thomas Arne, saw the first performance of &#145;Rule, Britannia&#146;. Lowe's d&eacute;but at Drury Lane was on 11 September, when he appeared as Sir John Loverule in Charles Coffey's <span class="italic">The Devil to Pay</span> and introduced the popular song with which he was identified throughout his career, &#145;The Early Horn&#146; by John Ernest Galliard. In the course of his first two seasons he played or sang a wide variety of roles, including Macheath (John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>, 17 October 1740), songs in Arne's <span class="italic">Oedipus</span> (19 November), Bacchanal (Arne's <span class="italic">Comus</span>, 10 December), Amiens (with Arne's music, in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, 20 December), Arne's songs in <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> (15 January 1741), Welford (<span class="italic">The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green</span>, by John Day, adapted by Robert Dodsley, 3 April), Lorenzo (<span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, 11 January 1742), and Marcus (in Joseph Addison's <span class="italic">Cato</span>, 4 March).<br>
<br>While Lowe passed the winters at Drury Lane, he spent summer 1741 in Bristol and summer 1742 in Dublin. In protest at Charles Fleetwood's management of Drury Lane he remained in Dublin during the 1742&#150;3 season, not returning until December 1743. In summer 1744 he joined the Arnes at Smock Alley in Dublin. His greatest achievement there was to sing the lead in the first performance of Arne's <span class="italic">The Death of Abel</span>. He was again at Drury Lane for the 1744&#150;5 season and, after a winter at Aungier Street Theatre in Dublin, he returned to Drury Lane for 1747&#150;8.<br>
<br>The great tenor John Beard returned after five years' absence to supersede Lowe at Drury Lane, and Lowe migrated to Covent Garden, where he appeared on 26 September 1748 as Macheath. His Arviragus in <span class="italic">Cymbeline</span> (15 February 1749) and Colonel Bully in John Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Provoked Wife</span> (4 October 1752), appear to have been, with some small singing parts, the most notable impersonations which he added to his Drury Lane repertory. It was probably at some point during his Covent Garden period that he married his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1770).<br>
<br>Beard moved to Covent Garden in 1759, and the two tenors shared roles for a season. When Beard moved to Covent Garden Lowe returned to Drury Lane, taking part, among other performances, in John Stanley's <span class="italic">The Tears and Triumphs of Parnassus</span> (first performed 17 November 1760), in Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span> (as Balthazar), and in <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> (as Hymen). After summer 1763 his connection with the great theatres ceased.<br>
<br>During his career in the patent houses Lowe was associated with several roles, but most particularly with musical comedy and with &#145;speciality&#146; songs introduced to vary otherwise non-musical pieces. He was also a member of Handel's oratorio company between 1742 and 1760, most often taking secondary roles. Prominent among his performances were Zadok in <span class="italic">Solomon</span> (1749) and Septimus in <span class="italic">Theodora</span> (1760). Lowe was a member of the Madrigal Society between 1741 and 1751, and he sang at a number of public gardens. By 1750 he was regularly to be seen at Vauxhall, and in August of that year he made his first appearance at Marylebone, with which he remained associated for twenty-five years.<br>
<br>For five years, beginning in 1763, Lowe was lessee and manager of Marylebone Gardens, succeeding John Trusler. &#145;The orchestra&#146;, wrote J. T. Smith:<blockquote>before which I have listened with my grandmother to hear Tommy Lowe sing, stood upon the site of the house now (1828) No. 17 Devonshire Place, and &hellip; nearly opposite to the old church still standing in High Street. (J. T. Smith, <span class="italic">Nollekens and his Times</span>, 2 vols., 1829, 1.33)</blockquote>The elder Stephen Storace and Dr Arnold supported the enterprise, and the first season was prosperous; but in spite of Miss Catley's singing, Miss Trusler's plum puddings, and the rousing choruses (by the audience) to Lowe's &#145;Fellowcraft&#146; and other songs, Lowe was ruined in 1767, following an exceptionally wet summer. He assigned all receipts to his creditors in 1768, and sold the gardens in 1769. Thenceforward his efforts to gain a livelihood met with scanty success. After holding an engagement at Finch's Grotto Gardens and managing the wells at Ottersley Pool, near Watford (1770), where his wife died, he was engaged by Tom King, on his purchase of Sadler's Wells, to sing there from 20 April 1772. He retained this engagement until his death, on 1 March 1783, in his lodgings in Aldersgate Street.<br>
<br>Lowe's voice was said by Dibdin to be more even and mellow than that of Beard, &#145;and in love songs, when little more than mere utterance was necessary, he might be said to have exceeded him. &hellip; Lowe lost himself beyond the namby-pamby poetry of Vauxhall; Beard was at home everywhere&#146;  (C. Dibdin, <span class="italic">A Complete History of the English Stage</span>, 5 vols., 1800, 5.364).<br>
<br>Burney concurred that Lowe's talents suffered from his lack of education: &#145;he could never be safely trusted with any thing better than a ballad, which he constantly learned by ear&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 9.374). However, he was popular with audiences, particularly as &#145;huntsmen, naval officers, rustics both realistic and classically pastoral&#146;  (ibid.). Portraits of Lowe were published with many songs, several engraved by George Bickham, and often showing him with his &#145;early horn&#146; of the song.<br>
<br>Lowe's son Halifax Lowe, who was said to resemble his father in voice and manner, made his first appearance as a singer at Sadler's Wells on 15 April 1784. He died in 1790.<br>
