<span class="headword">Barrington,  Kenneth Frank <span class="st"> [Ken]</span></span>  (1930&#150;1981), <span class="occ">cricketer</span>, was born on 24 November 1930 in Reading, the eldest of the three sons and four daughters of Percy Barrington, a regular soldier, and his wife, Winifred Lambden. His early experience of poverty shaped his life, for cricket, his abiding passion, also became his passport to better times. After attending Wilson Central School and Katesgrove secondary school in Reading, he began his working life at fourteen as a motor mechanic. This was followed by two years as assistant groundsman at Reading cricket club. From there the stockily built Barrington joined Surrey in 1948 as a promising leg-spinner. Encouraged to concentrate on his batting, he worked his way up but did not make his first team d&eacute;but until 1953, having spent 1949&#150;50 in Germany, doing his national service as a lance-corporal in the Royal Wiltshire regiment. On 6 March 1954 he married Ann Cozens (<i>b</i>. 1933), a secretary, the daughter of a butcher turned publican in Reading. She was an important source of strength to him. In the season following his marriage he scored his maiden century, becoming part of the great Surrey side of that vintage. In 1955 he won his first test cap against South Africa at Trent Bridge, but failed to score and was dropped after the next test. It was to be another four years before he returned. During this time he eliminated the risks within his game, and adopted an open-chested stance, which, although ungainly to the eye, proved highly effective in combating the surfeit of in-swing bowling then prevailing.<br>
<br>After a successful return against India in 1959 Barrington prospered on his first senior tour to the West Indies in 1959&#150;60 and all subsequent ones, most notably in Australia (1962&#150;3) and in South Africa (1964&#150;5), where he averaged over 80 in the tests on both tours. Apart from the quickness of his eye and his strength on both front and back foot, the key to his success lay in his supreme concentration and determination never to surrender his wicket. At home he was nearly as dependable and at Old Trafford against Australia in 1964 he achieved his highest test score of 256, but the painstaking manner in which he accumulated his runs rarely made for compulsive viewing. In 1965 he was dropped for slow scoring after a turgid 137 against New Zealand at Edgbaston but celebrated his return at Headingley in style with a swashbuckling 163.<br>
<br>A drawback to this prodigious run scoring was the debilitating effect it had on Barrington's health. For in contrast to his easygoing approach off the field, batting was an emotionally taxing business and after an unhappy beginning to the 1966 series against the West Indies, Barrington, close to a nervous breakdown, felt compelled to withdraw. A year away from test cricket helped revive him, and in 1967 he was back to his best, heading the national averages and scoring centuries in three successive tests against Pakistan. He began the 1967&#150;8 series against the West Indies with a courageous 143 at Port of Spain but once again the tension began to get to him. A serious heart attack in Australia later that year, when participating in a demanding double-wicket competition, brought his premature retirement and he acquired and ran a successful garage and motor dealership in Surrey. He returned to the game in 1975, first as a test selector (a position he held for the rest of his life), then as a manager and finally as assistant manager on five successive tours between 1976 and 1981. His technical expertise as a coach coupled with his benign charm and his devotion to his charges made him a universally revered figure.<br>
<br>Barrington almost cared too much, burdened himself with responsibility and obligations, and once again the strain began to take its toll. It was during a particularly traumatic tour to the West Indies, aggravated by political troubles, that Barrington collapsed and died of a heart attack in Bridgetown, Barbados, on 14 March 1981. His funeral was held at Randalls Park crematorium, Leatherhead, Surrey on 23 March. &#145;No cricketer was ever more widely mourned&#146;, declared <span class="italic">Wisden</span>  (90). &#145;He set out to become an impregnable batsman and, changing his technique, made himself into one of the finest defensive players of cricket history&#146;, asserted John Arlott in <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> (15 March 1981). He was survived by his wife and their son Guy. His test record of 6806 runs, average 58.67, in a career of 31,714 runs with 76 centuries, average 45.63, ranks with the very best. He also took 273 wickets at an average of 32.63 and held 515 catches. Of medium height (5 foot 9 inches tall), he was a distinctive figure on the field with his neatly cut crinkling black hair, roman nose, and jutting jaw. His soldierly background was reflected in his immaculate dress and meticulous care of his cricket gear. He is commemorated by the Ken Barrington Cricket Centre, which was opened by Surrey at the Oval in 1990 to provide indoor nets and sporting facilities to encourage young cricketers.<br>
