<span class="headword">Adams,  John Michael Geoffrey Manningham <span class="st"> [Tom]</span></span>  (1931&#150;1985), <span class="occ">prime minister of Barbados</span>, was born on 24 September 1931 in St Michael, Barbados, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30746/', "Sir Grantley Herbert Adams (1898&#150;1971)")</script>, later prime minister of the Federation of the West Indies, and his wife, Grace, only daughter of Alexander Thorne, shipping agent, and his wife, Millicent. He was educated at the Ursuline convent, and at Harrison College in Barbados, and then at Magdalen College, Oxford, to which he was admitted after winning the Barbados scholarship in 1951. He obtained third-class honours in philosophy, politics, and economics in 1954.<br>
<br>In 1954 Adams began to study law at Gray's Inn; he was called to the bar in 1959. While a law student, he worked as a producer in the overseas service of the BBC where he met Genevieve Turner, who was employed as a secretary. They were married in 1962. Genevieve was the daughter of Philip Turner, principal assistant solicitor (later solicitor) to the Post Office. There were two sons of the marriage.<br>
<br>Adams worked for six months in the Gray's Inn chambers of Dingle Foot and then returned to Barbados in January 1963. After settling his family and setting himself up as a barrister in chambers he began his political career. He was secretary of the Barbados Labour Party from 1965 to 1969. He won a seat in the house in 1966 and was leader of the opposition from 1971 to 1976. He became prime minister and finance minister of Barbados in September 1976 and remained in that office until his death in 1985.<br>
<br>Adams had a formidable task before him when he entered public life. He had to function under the shadow of his illustrious father's name and, in addition, he was faced with a redoubtable opponent, Errol Barrow, who led the Democratic Labour Party and was then prime minister of Barbados. But at the BBC he had developed the talents that made him the island's most skilful communicator. His oratory was such that he attracted large audiences to meetings of the assembly. And, while he excelled in parliamentary debate, he soon showed he was no mean opponent on the political platform. In addition, what helped him to win three by-elections and two general elections was his flair for organization.<br>
<br>One of Adams's ambitions was to bring to reality his father's dream of a West Indies united and self-governing. He was actively involved in the Caribbean Community which sought to attain some of the late federation's objectives. He was in every sense a Caribbean man. He promptly sent military assistance to St Vincent when the premier, Milton Cato, asked for help in 1979 against a revolt in the Grenadines. And when the premier of Grenada, Maurice Bishop, was killed in 1983 and that island was threatened with a Marxist take-over, Adams joined with the leaders of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States and persuaded President Ronald Reagan of the USA to assist them in a rescue mission. Adams regretted the decline of British influence.<br>
<br>Adams was tall and handsome and possessed the common touch. He was fond of gardening and philately, bridge, and poker. He loved dancing and merrymaking, even to the extent of embarrassing his entourage. He drove himself hard at both work and play and slept only four hours a night. In due course his many-sided activities began to take a toll on his health. He made light of the first signs that should have warned him that his heart was beginning to feel the strain. Later he consulted a Harley Street specialist, who advised open-heart surgery late in 1984. Adams decided to postpone any such operation until he had completed pressing business abroad that would help him in the unceasing tasks of social reform and financial stability. However, he collapsed on the afternoon of 11 March 1985, at Ilaro Court, the official residence of the prime minister, and a medical certificate confirmed that his death that day was due to cardiac failure.<br>
