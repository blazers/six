<span class="headword">Wilder,  Philip  van</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1554), <span class="occ">musician</span>, was born probably in the Low Countries at the close of the fifteenth century. During the second quarter of the sixteenth century he oversaw secular music-making at the English court; in particular his position brought him close to Henry VIII, who was himself an enthusiastic and proficient musician. As a composer, van Wilder is of only modest significance within a broad European context, but his works were widely known and influential in sixteenth-century England. He seems to have belonged to a musical family; two other musicians of the name van Wilder also served the Tudor court during Henry VIII's reign. Nothing is known about him before about 1522, when he is first recorded as being resident in London. By 1525 he was serving as a lute player to the king and commanded a substantial salary implying special status. He was granted licences to import wine from Gascony and woad from Toulouse; he also received income from property granted in London and Dorset, and gifts from the king and from Princess Mary. His denization was granted on 10 April 1539. He lived in the London parish of St Olave, from 1537 with his wife, Frances, with whom he had two daughters and four sons; one son, Henry, also became a musician in the privy chamber.<br>
<br>As a member (later a gentleman) of the privy chamber, van Wilder occupied a position of high rank. His own instrument was the lute, which he not only played but also taught to Henry's children, Mary and Edward. He had charge of a group of singers, men and boys, unconnected to the choir of the Chapel Royal, and it was presumably for them that the majority of his vocal works were composed. He was also responsible for the upkeep of the royal instruments at Westminster. The scope of that last position is made clear from the great inventory of Henry VIII's possessions at his death; it lists thirteen organs, nineteen other keyboard instruments (virginals and clavichords), and several hundred smaller wind and string instruments including viols, lutes, and recorders.<br>
<br>Virtually no lute music by van Wilder is known to exist. Instead, his surviving works are mainly <i>chansons</i> to French texts, some thirty in number. A few of these were printed in Antwerp during his lifetime, but the majority are found only in Elizabethan manuscript sources, where they are largely transmitted either without text, as if for instrumental performance, or as <i>contrafacta</i> adapted to sacred or secular English words. Stylistically they range from compact settings in the manner of Claudin de Sermisy to more densely polyphonic works for as many as seven voices. Several motets by him also survive; one of them, <span class="italic">Sancte Deus</span>, is written in a recognizably English idiom. Van Wilder's works circulated largely under the name Philip or Phillips, a fact that until recently caused confusion between him and the later English composer Peter Phillips.<br>
<br>Philip van Wilder died in London on 24 February 1554, and was buried at St Olave, Hart Street. The following anonymous tribute to him was printed four years after his death in Richard Tottel's poetic miscellany <span class="italic">Songs and Sonettes</span>:<blockquote>
<div>Bewaile with me, all ye that have profest<br>
</div>
<div>Of musicke, th'arte by touche of coarde or winde;<br>
</div>
<div>Laye downe your lutes and let your gitterns rest.<br>
</div>
<div>Phillips is dead whose like you can not finde,<br>
</div>
<div>Of musicke much exceeding all the rest.<br>
</div>
<div>Muses, therefore, of force now must you wrest<br>
</div>
<div>Your pleasant notes into an other sounde.<br>
</div>
<div>The string is broke, the lute is disposest,<br>
</div>
<div>The hand is cold, the bodye in the grounde.<br>
</div>
<div>The lowring lute lamenteth now therefore<br>
</div>
<div>Phillips her frende that can her touche no more.<br>
</div> (Tottel, sig. XI<i>v</i>)</blockquote>Until the late twentieth century van Wilder was rarely given more than passing mention by British musicologists, whose writings on the Tudor period tended to concentrate on the achievements of native musicians. His rehabilitation has been brought about largely by American scholarship.<br>
