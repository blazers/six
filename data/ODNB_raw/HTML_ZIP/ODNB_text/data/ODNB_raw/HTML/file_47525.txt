<span class="headword">Gomme,  Ebenezer</span>  (1858&#150;1931), <span class="occ">furniture manufacturer</span>, was born on 12 April 1858 in Nettlebed, near Henley, the son of John Gomme and his wife, Hannah Grimsell. His father's occupation at his birth was described as &#145;fellmonger&#146;, a feller of trees. An ancestor was James Gomme (1726&#150;1825) of High Wycombe and Hammersmith, who was a furniture maker, a member of the Society of Antiquaries, and a friend of Edmund Burke. The family moved to High Wycombe in 1864, and the father was employed by the firm of Cox &amp; Co., chairmakers of that town.<br>
<br>Ebenezer Gomme was apprenticed to Cox &amp; Co. as a chairmaker at the age of thirteen, in 1871, and served a five-year apprenticeship with them. As a &#145;journeyman&#146; he broadened his experience by working for the next few years with Goodearls and with William Birch, both firms in the town of High Wycombe, as a &#145;best chairmaker&#146;. His first venture on his own behalf was in Exeter in 1881&#150;2, but this failed and he returned to High Wycombe and to work for William Birch. In 1886&#150;8 he worked in partnership under the name Gomme and Mendy, but this too was unsuccessful.<br>
<br>In 1881 Gomme married Isabella Alice Pierce (1853&#150;1954), daughter of William Pierce, foreman of a coal wharf. The couple had two sons, Frank (<i>b</i>. 1883) and Ted (<i>b</i>. 1890). Continuing to work as a chairmaker Gomme tried again to start up his own business, in 1898, from his garden shed in High Wycombe, in partnership with his brother-in-law, Tim Pierce. The business was successful, though the partnership was dissolved in 1901. Gomme had progressed in business sufficiently to open his first factory in Leigh Street, High Wycombe, in 1909, and by 1914 he was employing 200 furniture makers. He went on to add another factory to the group in 1927, at Spring Gardens, High Wycombe, a fire having destroyed the premises at Leigh Street in 1922.<br>
<br>The firm of E. Gomme Ltd built its reputation on the concept of &#145;whole house furniture&#146;; in other words it made dining, upholstery, bedroom, and occasional furniture, in the same style and idiom. The building of the Spring Gardens factory also meant that it could work on batch production in advance of orders, with 250 cabinets and 1000 chairs (each of the same design) being made in one production run. The economies of scale that this produced ensured the company's place in the market when many others were having difficulties in the late 1920s and 1930s. Gomme's sons joined the firm and by 1918 Frank, who had started his working life in the civil service, was in charge of administration. He was dispatched to the USA in the same year, to buy the latest woodworking machinery and to bring back American production methods. Ted, who had started his working life with war service in the navy, joined the firm in 1918 in charge of production.<br>
<br>Ebenezer Gomme died on 4 November 1931 at his home, The Crest, Totteridge, High Wycombe, having retired in the previous year. He was survived by his wife. The firm, headed by his sons, continued to prosper, becoming one of the largest manufacturers of furniture in the UK. However, since its products were retailed by others, it did not become a household name.<br>
<br>During the Second World War the Gomme factories made Mosquito aircraft. The skills of precise engineering, and the extensive use of very accurate jigs moved the firm's already high production standards forward, and with the demise of the controls and utility furniture in 1950 the company introduced a range of designs based on a pre-war product known as the bachelor suite. Initially called in the factory the Brandon suite, the furniture was designed for very large production runs. Carefully engineered and jigged, it was renamed G-Plan and was a popular success.<br>
