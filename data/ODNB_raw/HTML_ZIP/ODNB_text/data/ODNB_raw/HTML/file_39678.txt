<span class="headword">Aglionby,  William</span>  (1641&#150;1705), <span class="occ">diplomat and writer on art</span>, was born in the summer of 1641, the second son of George Aglionby (<i>d</i>. 1643), who died shortly after being appointed dean of Canterbury by Charles I, and his wife, Sibilla Smith. George had previously been employed by the Cavendish family, earls of Devonshire, and after his death his widow and surviving son were supported by the third earl of Devonshire, who seems to have paid for William's education, which was largely conducted abroad. He studied medicine at the University of Bordeaux, and also civil law, perhaps at the University of Leiden, and in the process became fluent in several languages. Elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1667, he published translations from French (1668) and Italian (1669), but his first recorded employment, between 1669 and 1671, was as a &#145;bear-leader&#146;, or travelling tutor, for well-born young men sent to the continent to acquire linguistic skills and social polish. This did not satisfy his ambitions, and when he reviewed his prospects, in a summary (in French) drawn up in 1671, shortly before his thirtieth birthday, he decided that he would have to choose between medicine, law, and diplomacy if he was to make his fortune, and that the practice of medicine in Paris offered his best chance of worldly success.<br>
<br>If Aglionby did go to live in Paris, he had probably returned by 1678, when the first duke of Ormond wrote in support of his application for the degree of doctor of physic at Oxford, to enable him to practise medicine in England. The application does not seem to have succeeded, for in the same year he was appointed secretary to Sir William Temple, the English ambassador to the United Provinces, and later became &#145;language-secretary&#146; in the Post Office. In the 1680s, however, Aglionby lived in London as a practising physician, qualified by reason of his having become a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, and twice served as a member of the Royal Society's council, in 1683&#150;4 and 1686&#150;7. But from 1688 onwards he increasingly earned his living as a diplomat. Some of his activities in that role were associated with the Post Office. In 1691 he was sent to Spain in an effort to persuade the government there to send foreign correspondence to England for distribution, rather than to France, and in 1697 he went to Calais to negotiate a restoration of cross-channel postal services previously disrupted by war. His other missions&#151;to Savoy (1693&#150;4), to Spain again (1700&#150;01), and to the Swiss Cantons (1702&#150;5)&#151;were directed towards maintaining English interests in more conventional ways, albeit with varying degrees of success&#151;his mission to Savoy appears to have been an unqualified disaster, since he was shipwrecked <i>en route</i>, and then kept so short of funds that his correspondence with the government came to consist largely of appeals for his own recall. But he was well enough regarded by his employers to be briefly appointed under-secretary of state to the second earl of Nottingham in 1702, before he was sent to Z&uuml;rich.<br>
<br>In 1669 Aglionby had published <span class="italic">The Present State of the United Provinces of the Low Countries</span>, in which he noted how widespread the appreciation of paintings was in Dutch society: &#145;Pictures are very common here, there being scarce an ordinary Tradesman, whose House is not adorned with them&#146;  (Aglionby, <span class="italic">The Present State</span>, 224&#150;5). The point was repeated in the preface to <span class="italic">Painting Illustrated in Three Diallogues</span> (1685), a pioneering exercise in the promotion of the understanding of pictorial art in England, which was dedicated to the fourth earl of Devonshire. Portraiture, Aglionby noted, was the only form of painting appreciated by his fellow countrymen, and there was no skill in, or encouragement for, &#145;history painting&#146;, which was conventionally acclaimed as the highest form of art, representing as it did notable people involved in momentous events, often markedly idealized in form, and overtly intended to inspire edification or emulation, or both.<br>
<br>Taking inspiration from the writings of Charles-Alphonse Du Fresnoy and Giovan Pietro Bellori, Aglionby aimed to remedy this by explaining such art technically and historically, and so to create an awareness of and regard for history painting among the English nobility and gentry, for whom it would constitute an alternative pursuit to the gluttony and drunkenness to which they were regrettably prone, an alternative, moreover, that was pleasurable as well as improving. For this he looked above all to the example of Italy (not Holland, none of whose seventeenth-century artists he mentioned), as represented both by the ancient world and by the succession of great artists who had revived and built upon the achievements of antiquity. Painting, he declared, should aim to copy nature, and also to improve upon it, and after providing an explication of the art of painting, including a glossary of technical terms, and then a history of it, &#145;both Antient and Modern&#146;, he concluded with the third dialogue, &#145;How to know good pictures&#146;, in which he repeated his assertion that &#145;till the gentry of this Nation are better Judges of the Art, 'tis impossible we should ever have an Historical Painter of our own, nor that any excellent Forreigner should stay amongst us&#146;  (Aglionby, <span class="italic">Painting Illustrated</span>, 98&#150;9). Aglionby's hope was that once an informed understanding was attained among the upper classes, enabling them to become patrons and collectors of history painting, then a change in national taste and aesthetic achievement would follow.<br>
<br>William Aglionby seems to have had a wide acquaintanceship. His friends and correspondents included the physician Hans Sloane, the diplomat Charles Berkeley, Lord Dursley, and the poet Matthew Prior, who succeeded Aglionby as Berkeley's secretary at The Hague in 1690. Sir William Trumbull, a prominent diplomat and government minister, to whom he bequeathed &pound;10 in his will, was also a friend. The spy John Macky, who may have known Aglionby through their common employment in the Post Office, and who wrote a short account of him about 1703, acknowledged that he &#145;hath abundance of Wit, and understands most of the modern Languages well; knows how to tell a Story to the best Advantage&#146;, but added that he had &#145;an affected manner of Conversation&#146;, while in appearance he was &#145;thin, splenatick and tawny Complexioned&#146;  (Macky, 153&#150;4). To this Jonathan Swift added that Aglionby &#145;had been a Papist&#146;  (Swift, 261). Nothing about Aglionby's beliefs can be deduced from his will, drawn up on 24 November 1705, which is almost devoid of religious content. Three years earlier he had married Katherine Hildyard, spinster, with whom he had a son, William, and who was pregnant with a short-lived daughter at her husband's death. Aglionby probably died at Chelsea (where he drew up his will), on 28 November 1705, and was buried in the east cloister of Westminster Abbey. The inscription on his grave-slab commemorated his endeavours as a diplomat, but posterity remembers him principally for his efforts to shape English attitudes towards, and appreciation of, the art of painting.<br>
