<span class="headword">Jones,  Robert</span>  (1745&#150;1829), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and author</span>, was born on 13 January 1745 at Suntur, a farm in Rhos-lan, in the parish of Llanystumdwy, Caernarvonshire, the only child of John Williams (<i>d</i>. 1783), a smallholder, and his wife, Margaret Owen (<i>d</i>. 1776). His mother taught him to read the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. Apart from that the only education which he had was at a school conducted by Thomas Gough, who based the lessons on the catechism published by Griffith Jones of Llanddowror (<i>bap</i>. 1684, <i>d</i>. 1761). He also taught him the rules of the strict metres of Welsh poetry.<br>
<br>In his adolescence Jones suffered from acute agonies of conscience, but was converted after studying once again a copy of Griffith Jones's catechism that he had bought and through hearing an unknown preacher in 1762. He then joined the Calvinistic Methodist society meeting at Brynengan in the parish of Dolbenmaen, Caernarvonshire. He became deeply concerned about the ignorance and immorality of young people and persuaded Bridget Bevan (1698&#150;1779) to set up one of her circulating schools in north Wales. In 1768 he opened a school at Capel Curig and then moved to Rhuddlan, Flintshire, where he suffered much public opposition. Later at Brynsiencyn, Anglesey, the incumbent of the parish wrote to Madam Bevan asking her to dismiss him. She took no notice of the request and Jones continued to conduct schools at Llangybi, Caernarvonshire, and Brynengan.<br>
<br>Jones was a very successful schoolmaster despite the harassment and had an instinctive talent for teaching children. His first published work was a satirical attack on the Revd Zaccheus Hughes, a graduate from Jesus College, Oxford, who resided at Trefan, Llanystumdwy, and died on 1 January 1796. Hughes had instigated a disturbance during a service conducted by Jones. The first edition bore the title <span class="italic">Ymddiffyn Cristionogol</span> (&#145;Christian defence&#146;) and appeared in 1770, but the second edition in 1776 had a more colourful title, <span class="italic">Lleferydd yr asyn</span> (&#145;The voice of the ass&#146;), and ran to six editions during the author's lifetime. On 2 December 1772 Jones married Magdalen Prichard (<i>c</i>.1750&#150;1813), the daughter of Richard Griffith (<i>d</i>. 1779) of Cae'rtyddyn in the parish of Llangybi, Caernarvonshire, and his wife, Mary Francis. Robert Jones and his wife had two daughters and two sons, including Samuel (1789&#150;1875), one of the most prominent figures among the Calvinistic Methodists of Liverpool.<br>
<br>In 1774 Jones took a seven-year lease upon Tir-bach, a farm in the parish of Llanystumdwy, and added to it a room that could be used as a chapel. In 1776 Robert Roberts, the incumbent of the parish, reported to the bishop of Bangor, John Moore, that it was where the Methodists assembled every Sunday and twice in the week, but the house was not licensed. The landlord ejected Jones and he moved to T&#375; Bwlcyn in the parish of Llaniestyn, Caernarvonshire, and remained there until 1815.<br>
<br>Jones had begun to associate with the Calvinistic Methodists in 1768 and in time became one of the leaders of second-generation Methodists. He was a constant attendant at their assemblies and his services as a preacher were in demand all over the country. In 1784 he came into contact with Thomas Charles (1755&#150;1814) of Bala and became one of his closest confidants. He produced an elementary manual for use in Charles's schools in 1788, entitled <span class="italic">Drych i'r anllythyrennog</span> (&#145;Mirror for the illiterate&#146;), as well as the first miscellaneous collection of hymns for use in the private societies, the <span class="italic">Grawn-syppiau Canaan</span> (&#145;Cluster of Canaan's grapes&#146;) of 1795. After some initial hesitation, he supported the decision of the Methodists to sever their links with the Church of England by ordaining their own ministers. He declined to be ordained himself but took a prominent part in the first ordination at Bala in 1811. He also assisted Charles in editing the Welsh <span class="roman">Bible</span>, the first to be published by the British and Foreign Bible Society. Jones's literary reputation today rests on his book <span class="italic">Drych yr amseroedd</span> (&#145;Mirror of the times&#146;) (1820). It has come to be recognized as a minor literary classic on account of Jones's mastery of strong, idiomatic Welsh. A historic document of continuing value, it preserved snippets of information, mainly about Methodism in north Wales, that would otherwise have been lost, and as a piece of Methodist historiography the work exemplifies both the belief that at the beginning of the evangelical revival religious life was all but extinct and the large part played by the rhetoric of martyrdom in later Methodist thinking.<br>
<br>After 1815 Jones left T&#375; Bwlcyn and spent some time in lodgings until a house was built for him next to the chapel at Dinas, Llaniestyn, where he spent the remainder of his life. He died there on Saturday 18 April 1829, at eighty-four years of age, and was buried alongside his wife on 21 April in Llaniestyn churchyard.<br>
