<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ogilby,  John</span>  (1600&#150;1676), <span class="occ">publisher and geographer</span>, was born on 17 November 1600 at &#145;Kellemeane&#146;, near Dundee, Forfarshire. Nothing is known either of his parents or of his early education, and even the date of his birth is known only from later statements by John Aubrey and Elias Ashmole. Aubrey noted that Ogilby was from &#145;a gentleman's family and bred to his grammar&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 2.99). It is probable that his father was admitted to the Merchant Taylors' Company in London in 1606. Aubrey tells us that the young Ogilby paid his father's debts with money secured from a lottery managed by the Virginia Company in March 1612, and that about 1619 he was apprenticed to John Draper, a London dancing-master. It is possible to see several phases to Ogilby's varied career: dancing-master, courtier, and theatre owner between about 1620 and 1641; poet and translator from 1649; and, from about 1669, compiler of geographical works and atlases, culminating in his <span class="italic">Britannia</span> (1675).<br>
<br>Ogilby is thought to have danced in Jonson's masque <span class="italic">The Gypsies Metamorphosed</span> in 1621, and it may have been then that he injured himself and became lame thereafter. The details of his life in the later 1620s are uncertain, though he may have soldiered. He was admitted freeman of the Merchant Taylors' Company on 6 July 1629. It is known that in Somerset he taught dancing to Ralph Hopton's sisters (<i>c</i>.1632&#150;3). He moved to Ireland in the summer of 1633, under the patronage of Viscount Wentworth, later earl of Strafford, to become master of the revels. Ogilby was responsible for the opening in 1637 of Ireland's first theatre, the New Theatre in Dublin's Werburgh Street, and for the development of the theatre's company. This ceased with the Irish rising in 1641. After service to the earl of Ormond, Ogilby returned to England about 1644, first to Bristol, then, about 1645, to Cambridge, and by 1648 to London. He married Christian (Katherine) Hunsdon on 14 March 1650, in St Peter-le-Poer parish: she was the widow of one Thomas Hunsdon, merchant taylor, of Blackfriars, London. William Morgan, the son of her married daughter Elizabeth, was later to become involved with John Ogilby in mapping and publishing projects.<br>
<br>In 1649 Ogilby published his first translation, of Virgil. It was initially circulated privately to members of the Merchant Taylors' Company, which rewarded him with a gift of &pound;10, in advance of the general edition. This was followed in 1651 by Aesop's <span class="italic">Fables</span> and further translations of Virgil in 1654 and 1658. His translations, particularly the 1654 folio, were magnificent productions: his style was direct and he paid great attention to paper quality, clear type, and the illustrations. Later translations&#151;of Homer's <span class="italic">Iliad</span> (1660) and <span class="italic">Odyssey</span> (1665), of Aesop's <span class="italic">Fables</span> and <span class="italic">Aesopics</span> (in 1665 and 1668, respectively), and of Virgil in 1666&#151;are splendid examples of seventeenth-century printing and of the patronage networks through which men like Ogilby promoted both themselves and polite learning. This was not, then, just an individual or a particularly British enterprise. Ogilby drew upon the translations of Virgil by the Spanish Jesuit de la Cerda and others, like Nicholas Caussin. In such ways, classical learning, book production, and patronage promoted &eacute;lite authority and the learned publics of seventeenth-century Europe. Ogilby was involved in the illustration and production of a two-volume edition of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, which, like his <span class="italic">Iliad</span>, he dedicated to Charles II. Ogilby's support from and for royalty is most clearly evident in <span class="italic">The Entertainment of his Most Excellent Majestie Charles II</span> (1661), which he both wrote and printed, a commemoration of the new king's coronation. Drawing upon earlier traditions of triumphal royal processions, Ogilby used the capital's streets as a theatrical stage for the promotion of civic virtue, royal authority, and future prosperity.<br>
<br>From 1661 Ogilby petitioned the king in order to safeguard publication rights and, in particular, to ensure a monopoly on his successful <span class="italic">Entertainment</span>. In March that year he was reconfirmed as master of the revels in Ireland, and he probably secured his title of master of the king's imprimeries (king's printer) in the same year. About July 1662 he moved to Ireland again to establish a theatre in Dublin, and he may have met Robert Boyle at this time. By late 1665 or early 1666 he was again settled in London. After the great fire of 1666 (in which he lost much of his own stock) he was appointed one of the city's assistant surveyors, a position that brought him into contact with Robert Hooke and Christopher Wren. He published his <span class="italic">Embassy to China</span> in 1669, and it was at this time that he conceived of a series of atlases to cover the whole world, to be funded through lotteries, subscription plans, and advertisements. The first, <span class="italic">Africa</span>, appeared in 1670. Others followed soon after: <span class="italic">Atlas Japannensis</span> (1670), <span class="italic">America</span> (1671), <span class="italic">Atlas Chinensis</span> (1671), and <span class="italic">Asia</span> (1673). These were not the fruits of Ogilby's own work but rather well-produced compilations of extant translations and others' accounts, a common practice at that time. His and others' work in this sense thus both reflected and directed growing public interest in distant places and foreign peoples.<br>
<br>Ogilby secured the additional title of his majesty's cosmographer early in 1671. It is clear that he again drew upon the support of the king and other patrons in the production and publication of <span class="italic">Britannia &hellip; an illustration of the kingdom of England and dominion of Wales: by a geographical and historical description of the principal roads thereof</span> (1675), the work for which he became best known. Chiefly a road atlas, it was securely based on contemporary and collaborative research. It was followed by <span class="italic">Mr Ogilby's tables of his measur'd roads &hellip; with other remarks &hellip; to which is added, A true account of the markets and fairs, &amp;c. collected in his survey</span> (1676). In <span class="italic">Britannia</span> Ogilby drew out 2519 miles of road in the form of 100 strip maps, a technique that was widely imitated throughout the following century. Measuring distances by waywiser (his &#145;great wheel&#146;), he made allowance for roads that ascended hills yet had to be depicted in two dimensions on paper, and his surveys helped to standardize the mile at 1760 yards throughout the kingdom. <span class="italic">Britannia</span> marked the first major advance in cartography in England since the Tudor period, though it did echo earlier traditions. It was republished in 1698, 1719, and 1720, and on subsequent occasions up to modern times.<br>
<br>Ogilby died in London on 4 September 1676, and was buried the next day at St Bride's, Fleet Street. His work was continued by William Morgan. Although Ogilby's translations in particular were decried by eighteenth-century critics, his reputation as a translator and printer was high during his lifetime, and <span class="italic">Britannia</span> has secured him enduring importance in British cartographic history.<br>
