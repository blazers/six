<span class="headword">Thompson, Sir  Harry Stephen Meysey</span>, first baronet  (1809&#150;1874), <span class="occ">agriculturist</span>, was born at Newby Park, Yorkshire, on 11 August 1809, the eldest son of Richard John Thompson (1771&#150;1853), an army officer, of an established aristocratic Yorkshire family, and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1840), daughter of John and Mary Turton of Sugnall Hall, Staffordshire. Mary Turton, the daughter and coheir of the Revd Thomas Meysey of Shakenhurst, Worcestershire, claimed descent from the De Meyseys who came to England from Meysey, Brittany, with William the Conqueror. Thompson was educated by private tutors, initially at home and then in London. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1829, and graduated in the mathematical tripos in 1832. During this period he studied entomology with Charles Darwin. As part of his grand tour he travelled extensively in Scotland and the south of France, and embarked upon a journey to Constantinople. The sickness of one of his companions, however, prevented him from reaching his destination. Following his return to Britain he intended to pursue a parliamentary or diplomatic career, but in response to pressure from his father, he settled down to the life of a country gentleman. On 26 August 1843 he married Elizabeth Anne (<i>d</i>. 1910), second daughter of Sir John and Lady Croft.<br>
<br>Thompson was very committed to promoting agricultural improvements on both his own estates and nationally. He accompanied John Evelyn Denison (afterwards Lord Ossington), John Lawes, and other leading figures on several practical agricultural tours in various parts of Britain. His views of the agricultural conditions in Ireland were published in <span class="italic">Tait's Magazine</span> in April 1840. He was a key figure in establishing the Yorkshire Agricultural Society in 1837, becoming president in 1862. He was a co-founder of the Royal Agricultural Society of England in 1838. Following the death of Phillip Pusey, in 1855, Thompson became editor and then chairman of the journal committee. He perceived the society's role, however, as being primarily that of improving standards of crop and stock husbandry, rather than a vehicle for dealing with wider issues such as land tenure. His narrow interpretation tended to undermine the standing of the journal during the period of his editorship. He continued to take an active part in the organization of the society as a member of council until 1858 and then as a trustee until his death.<br>
<br>Thompson's interest in practical agricultural problems led him to carry out a number of experiments in conjunction with Joseph Spence, a chemist of York, relating to the ability of the soil to absorb and retain nitrogen (in, as yet, an undetermined form). In 1848 a summary of their findings was sent to Professor J. Thomas Way, who continued with the research and published his results in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society</span> in 1850. In the same year Thompson's unfinished &#145;Investigations on the absorbent power of soils&#146; was also published (vol. 11, 1850, 68&#150;74) in the journal. Collectively their research showed that fertilizers, and nitrogen in particular, were absorbed in the soil by a complex series of chemical reactions. These preliminary investigations foreshadowed the significant discoveries in the 1850s made by John Lawes and J. H. Gilbert at the Rothamsted Experimental Station, which showed that the majority of agricultural crops, especially cereals, required additional nitrogen inputs for high yields. Thompson's research drew attention to the value of covered cattle yards for protecting animals and also for improving the quality of manure. The construction of a covered yard for pigs at Kirby Hall estate attracted widespread interest at the time.<br>
<br>From 1849 Thompson developed a consuming interest in railways. He was instrumental in promoting a meeting of the York, Newcastle, and Berwick shareholders at York, which secured the deposition of George Hudson and the election of a new board of directors. Initially he declined a seat on this reconvened board, but shortly afterwards became chairman of the North Midland Railway Company. In 1854, when the two companies were amalgamated as the North Eastern Railway, he continued as chairman, a position he retained until a few months before his death. He was chairman of the United Railways Company Association from 1867 to 1873. He was an energetic and efficient organizer, whose efforts helped to revitalize the railway companies. In 1853, following his father's death, he inherited the family estates, becoming a justice of the peace, deputy lieutenant, and high sheriff of Yorkshire in 1856. His interest in politics led to his election as Liberal MP for Whitby in 1859. He played a key part in legislation relating to agriculture, the management of railways, and church rating. Following his defeat in 1865 he stood for the eastern division of the West Riding of Yorkshire but was unsuccessful.<br>
<br>Thompson was a dynamic, if somewhat controversial figure. He was, for example, an ardent critic of agricultural colleges and suggested that institutions of this type would be likely to fail. In the late 1840s he claimed that students at Cirencester Agricultural College either idled away their time or waited until they received commissions in the army. He was criticized during his tenureship of the selection committee of the Royal Agricultural Society journal for not wanting an editor but merely a sub-editor who would promote his own views. Nevertheless, he played a significant role in enhancing the professionalism and scientific content of the Royal Agricultural Society's journal, and was a prolific writer in his own right, compiling eighteen articles dealing mainly with agricultural implements. His contributions improved the managerial performance and profitability of the railway companies he chaired.<br>
<br>Thompson was a committed family man, with five sons and five daughters. On 26 March 1874 he was created a baronet, which was accompanied by his assuming the surname of Meysey-Thompson in recognition of his mother's family. He died on 17 May 1874 at Kirby Hall in Yorkshire. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son Sir Henry Meysey-Thompson (1845&#150;1929), who in 1905 was created Baron Knaresborough.<br>
