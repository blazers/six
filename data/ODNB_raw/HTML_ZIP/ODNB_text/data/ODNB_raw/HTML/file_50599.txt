<span class="headword">Lane,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1640&#150;1710), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was baptized on 7 January 1641, the son of Thomas Lane, of Dodford, Northamptonshire, and his wife, Sarah, daughter of the Revd Walter Evans. The family were minor gentry with a strong clerical and colonial element: Lane had two grandfathers and an uncle in holy orders, as well as two uncles in Barbados; of his seven brothers, one later entered the church and two went to Jamaica. As the second son in a family of eight sons and four daughters, it was almost inevitable that he would follow a career that took him far from Northamptonshire. Though evidence is lacking, it is likely that during his early years he spent some time as a factor or trader overseas in the Chesapeake or elsewhere in America. He was active as a merchant in London by 1672, when he was importing tobacco from Virginia. About that time he became the partner of Micaiah Perry the elder in the firm of Perry and Lane, Virginia merchants of London. The firm prospered, rising from twelfth among London tobacco importers in 1676 to second in 1686, during years when London accounted for more than half of England's total tobacco imports. After the death in 1688 of its most important competitor, John Jeffreys, the firm moved into first place and held that position until at least 1720. This made it then the largest firm in London trading to North America.<br>
<br>In December 1679 Lane obtained a licence to marry Mary Puckle (1661&#150;1727), daughter of Major William Puckle, a Cromwellian officer, functionary, and later merchant. Her mother was a daughter of Richard Hutchinson, treasurer of the navy under Cromwell. With the patronage of Robert Thomson, another former Cromwellian functionary and later deputy governor of the East India Company, Major Puckle was given a commission to inspect that company's trading stations between Madras and Bengal, where he died in 1676, leaving his daughter an orphan.<br>
<br>The business of Perry and Lane was particularly prosperous during the 1690s, when it added to its direct trade a considerable commission business from larger tobacco planters attracted by the higher European prices in wartime. Lane is not known to have invested in any of the great company flotations of that decade but in 1697 used &pound;6550 of his personal fortune to purchase lands in Charwelton parish, Northamptonshire. He also owned (with the Perrys) Chester's Quay on the Thames, near the Customs House. He died after 17 October 1710 (when his will was signed) and before 10 December of that year, when it was proved. At his death Lane, then of Bethnal Green, left his widow an annuity of &pound;250 derived from the income of his Charwelton lands. They had no children. He is probably the Thomas Lane who was buried on 8 November 1710 at St Dunstan's, Stepney.<br>
<br>Lane took no known part in the guild or public life of London. However, in 1711, after his death, his wife's cousin, the London notary James Puckle, published <span class="italic">The Club</span>, a collection of humorous sketches, dedicated to Lane and the Perrys, &#145;Whose Consummate wisdom, Matchless industry, and Perfect honesty, so justly made them Live Beloved, and Die Lamented&#146;.<br>
