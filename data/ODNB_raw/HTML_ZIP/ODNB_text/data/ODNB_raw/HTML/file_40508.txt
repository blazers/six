<span class="headword">Rogerson,  John</span>  (1741&#150;1823), <span class="occ">physician</span>, the son of Samuel Rogerson, was probably born at Lochbrow, Scotland. On 14 August 1765 he graduated from Edinburgh University. His thesis, &#145;De morbis infantum&#146;, was dedicated to James Mounsey, a physician to Tsar Peter III, on whose recommendation Rogerson gained employment in Russia. In 1766 Rogerson arrived at St Petersburg, where he was examined by the Medical College and received the right to practise in Russia. Rogerson was introduced to Catherine II by Princess Dashkova, who stated that &#145;Mr. Rogerson's great skill and care gave me my son back&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 194). On 18 February 1769 Rogerson was appointed a court physician with a salary of 1000 roubles a year. He learned some Russian, settled in St Petersburg, and quickly established himself in fashionable society. On 18 January 1776 he was appointed physician-in-ordinary (leib-medik), with a salary of 4000 roubles a year. He was given the title of active councillor of state and was elected to the Imperial Academy of Sciences.<br>
<br>In 1779 Rogerson was elected to the Royal Society of London, on account of his work in promoting scientific and intellectual links between Russia and England, through his extensive personal connections. Among his correspondents were William Robertson, the principal of Edinburgh University, whose works Rogerson introduced to Catherine II, and John Hope, with whom Rogerson had studied botany. In 1784 Rogerson's position was threatened by the promotion of Dr Weikard, under the patronage of Count Orlov, Catherine's current favourite. Rogerson petitioned for leave, ostensibly to take the waters, and sold his house in Tsarskoye Selo for 2000 roubles. However, before he could leave, another royal favourite, Lanskoy, fell ill. Weikard failed to effect a successful cure, and although Rogerson, who was called too late, was unable to save Lanskoy, he was restored to favour and was retained to help Catherine to cope with her own bereavement.<br>
<br>In 1785 Rogerson undertook a short European tour to England, Paris, and Vienna, before returning to Russia the following year. Although Catherine professed scepticism towards doctors and medicines, she seems to have regarded Rogerson as the most capable physician in her entourage and often dispatched him to deal with emergencies or to treat her sick friends. Thus he was sent in 1786 to the port of Kronstadt, whose hospitals were in the grip of a deadly epidemic. He also attended Admiral Greig, who fell ill while on board ship in the port of Tallinn in 1788. Rogerson accompanied Catherine on her trips to the south of Russia and along the River Dnieper in 1786 and 1787.<br>
<br>Rogerson was reputed to be absent-minded, a passionate gambler, and a gossip. These characteristics, together with his tall and angular appearance, made him the butt of jokes. Nevertheless, he possessed sufficient tact and diplomatic skills to be used regularly in unofficial negotiations, and acquired many staunch friends, among both Russians and foreigners. On 19 August 1795 he was given a present of an estate in the Minsk region which brought him an annual revenue of 6000 roubles. Although his medical skills were scorned by rival doctors at the St Petersburg court, mainly because of his predilection for phlebotomy and laxatives, he enjoyed considerable popularity among his aristocratic patients. What little is known about his medical practice reveals him to have been a doctor who recognized the particular needs of his patients, and a good diagnostician.<br>
<br>Rogerson's treatment of the bereaved tsarina consisted mainly of providing a tranquil environment for her. Although she scorned medical ministrations, she accepted some of his prescriptions and acted on his advice when she acquired the patent for a popular remedy, Tinctura nervine bestuschevi. According to her own admission, her favourite, Prince Potyomkin, implicitly adhered to Rogerson's advice, finding his remedies very helpful. In Catherine's last illness Rogerson was utterly opposed to the treatment prescribed by Dr Cachoni, who insisted on treating the open sores on the tsarina's legs. In Rogerson's opinion the sores were less important than the prevention of apoplexy, which he feared on account of her advanced age and considerable weight.<br>
<br>After Catherine's death from apoplexy in 1796 Rogerson remained in Russia. On 5 April 1797, the day of Paul I's coronation, Rogerson was promoted to the rank of secret councillor. Despite this, he found the new court atmosphere almost suffocating, whereas serving Catherine had been &#145;the most perfect freedom&#146;  (Yelnitsky). After Paul's assassination in 1801 Rogerson continued to work as a court physician and a member of the Medical Council. He visited Britain in 1804&#150;5, and again in 1811&#150;13. In 1809 he retired from medical practice but continued to treat his close friends.<br>
<br>In 1816 Rogerson returned to Scotland, settling on his estate at Dumcrieff, near Moffat, in Dumfriesshire. He had at least one son who became a naval surgeon, and there is evidence of his nieces living with him in St Petersburg during the 1790s. He left no notes or memoirs, though some of his extensive correspondence survives, revealing the important role he played in promoting intellectual, cultural, and social contacts between Russia and Britain. Rogerson died on his Dumcrieff estate in 1823.<br>
