<span class="headword">Whinyates, Sir  Edward Charles</span>  (1782&#150;1865), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born on 6 May 1782, was the third son of Major Thomas Whinyates (1755&#150;1806) of Abbotsleigh, Devon, and Catherine, daughter of Sir Thomas Frankland, bt, of Thirkleby Park, Yorkshire. He was educated at Mr Newcombe's school, Hackney, and at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, which he entered as a cadet on 16 May 1796. He was commissioned as second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery on 1 March 1798, and became lieutenant on 2 October 1799. He served in the expedition of that year to The Helder, and in the expedition to Madeira in 1801. When Madeira was evacuated at the peace of Amiens, he went with his company to Jamaica, and was made adjutant. On 8 July 1805 he was promoted second captain, and came home. He served as adjutant to the artillery in the attack on Copenhagen in 1807. In the following year he was posted to D troop of the horse artillery.<br>
<br>In February 1810 Whinyates embarked with his troop for the Peninsula, but the <i>Camilla</i> transport, on which he was sailing, nearly foundered, and had to put back. Owing to this, D troop did not take the field as a unit until 1811, but Whinyates was present at Busaco on 27 September 1810, and acted as adjutant to the officer commanding the artillery. He was at Albuera on 16 May 1811 with four guns, and there are letters of his describing this and subsequent actions. He and his troop took part in the cavalry affair at Usagre on 25 May, and in the actions at Fuentes-Guinaldo and Aldea de Ponte on 25 and 27 September.<br>
<br>In 1812 the troop was with Hill's corps on the Tagus; at Ribera, on 24 July, Whinyates made such good use of two guns that the French commander Lallemand enquired his name, and sent him a message: &#145;Tell that brave man that if it had not been for him, I should have beaten your cavalry&#146;  (F. T. Whinyates, 63). The captain of D troop died at Madrid on 22 October, and for the next four months Whinyates was in command of it. It distinguished itself at San Mu&ntilde;oz on 17 November, at the close of the retreat from Burgos, five out of its six guns being injured. General Long, who commanded the cavalry to which it was attached, afterwards wrote of the troop that he had never witnessed &#145;more exemplary conduct in quarters, nor more distinguished zeal and gallantry in the field&#146;.<br>
<br>On 24 January 1813 Whinyates became captain, and consequently left the Peninsula in March. His service there won him no promotion, as brevet rank was not given at that time to second captains. In 1814 he was appointed to the 2nd rocket troop, and he commanded it at Waterloo. Wellington, who did not believe in rockets, ordered that they should be left behind; when he was told that this would break Whinyates's heart, he replied: &#145;Damn his heart; let my orders be obeyed.&#146; However, Whinyates eventually obtained leave to bring them into the field, together with his six guns. When Ponsonby's brigade charged D'Erlon's corps, he followed it with his rocket sections, and fired several volleys of ground rockets with good effect against the French cavalry. In the course of the day he had three horses shot under him, was struck on the leg, and severely wounded in the left arm. He received a brevet majority and the Waterloo medal, and afterwards the Peninsular silver medal with clasps for Busaco and Albuera.<br>
<br>At the end of 1815 the rocket troop went to England to be reduced, and Whinyates was appointed to a troop of drivers in the army of occupation, with which he remained until 1818. He commanded H troop of horse artillery from 1823 to 22 July 1830, when he became regimental lieutenant-colonel. He was knighted in 1823 and made CB in 1831. He had command of the horse artillery at Woolwich from November 1834 to May 1840, and of the artillery in the northern district for eleven years afterwards, having become regimental colonel on 23 November 1841.<br>
<br>On 1 April 1852 Whinyates was appointed director-general of artillery, and on 19 August commandant at Woolwich, where he remained until 1 June 1856. He had been promoted major-general on 20 June 1854, and became lieutenant-general on 7 June 1856 and general on 10 December 1864. He was made KCB on 18 May 1860. He had become colonel-commandant of a battalion on 1 April 1855, and was transferred to the horse artillery on 22 July 1864. He was &#145;an officer whose ability, zeal, and services have hardly been surpassed in the regiment&#146;  (Duncan, 2.37).<br>
<br>In 1827 Whinyates had married Elizabeth, only daughter of Samuel Compton of Wood End, North Riding, Yorkshire. They had no children. He died at Dorset Villa, Cheltenham, on 25 December 1865. Whinyates had five brothers, of whom four served with distinction in the army and navy.<br>
<br>The eldest, <a name="cosubject_29212"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Whinyates</span>  (1778&#150;1857), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born on 7 September 1778, entered the navy as first-class volunteer on 24 May 1793. He commanded a boat in the attack and capture of Martinique in March 1794, and assisted in boarding the French frigate <i>Bienvenue</i>. He was also present at the capture of St Lucia and Guadeloupe. He was in Lord Bridport's action of 23 June 1795, and in that of Sir John Warren on 12 October 1798. He was commissioned as lieutenant on 7 September 1799, and as commander on 16 May 1805. In April 1807 he was appointed to the <i>Frolic</i>, an eighteen-gun brig of 384 tons. He took her out to the West Indies, and spent five years there, being present at the recapture of Martinique on 24 February 1809 and of Guadeloupe on 5 February 1810.<br>
<br>Whinyates was made post captain on 12 August 1812, and on his way home, in charge of convoy, he was attacked on 18 October by the United States sloop <i>Wasp</i> of 434 tons. The <i>Frolic</i> had been much damaged in a gale, and after an action of fifty minutes, in which more than half her crew were killed or wounded, including her commander, she was boarded and taken. She was recovered, and the <i>Wasp</i> was taken by the <i>Poictiers</i> the same day. The court martial which tried Whinyates for the loss of his ship acquitted him most honourably, as having done all that could be done. In 1815 he was appointed to a corvette, but she was paid off at the peace. He was promoted rear-admiral on 1 October 1846, and died unmarried at Cheltenham on 15 March 1857. He received the silver war medal with five clasps.<br>
<br>The fourth son of Thomas Whinyates, <a name="cosubject_29211"></a><span class="headword">George Barrington Whinyates</span>  (1783&#150;1808), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born on 31 August 1783, entered the navy as first-class volunteer in 1797, and saw much active service, chiefly in the Mediterranean. In 1805, as lieutenant in the <i>Spencer</i>, seventy-four guns, he served under Nelson in the blockade of Toulon, the voyage to the West Indies, and the blockade of Cadiz, but his ship, which formed part of the inshore squadron, was sent to Gibraltar for provisions three days before Trafalgar. He was in Duckworth's action off St Domingo on 6 February 1806. In 1807 he commanded the <i>Berg&egrave;re</i> sloop in the Mediterranean and the channel. He died of consumption, brought on by hardship and exposure, on 5 August 1808.<br>
<br>The fifth son, <a name="cosubject_29210"></a><span class="headword">Frederick William Whinyates</span>  (1793&#150;1881), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, born on 29 August 1793, was commissioned as second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 14 December 1811, and became lieutenant on 1 July 1812. He was present at the bombardment of Algiers on 27 August 1816, being in command of a detachment of sappers and miners on the <i>Impregnable</i>. He left a graphic account of the bombardment  (<span class="italic">Royal Engineers' Journal</span>, 11.26). He received the medal. He served with the army of occupation in France, and made reports on some of the French fortresses (later acquired by the Royal Engineers' Institute, Chatham). He was commanding royal engineer with the field force in New Brunswick when the disputed territory was invaded by the state of Maine in 1839. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel on 9 November 1846, and colonel on 16 December 1854. He retired as major-general on 13 January 1855. He married, on 25 January 1830, Sarah Marianne, second daughter of Charles Whalley of Stow on the Wold, Gloucestershire, and had six children, four of whom became officers of the army. He died at Cheltenham on 9 January 1881.<br>
<br>The sixth son, <a name="cosubject_29209"></a><span class="headword">Francis Frankland Whinyates</span>  (1796&#150;1887), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India company</span>, born on 30 June 1796, entered the East India Company's service at the age of sixteen, and was gazetted as lieutenant-fireworker in the Madras artillery in July 1813. After serving in Ceylon and against the Pindaris, he took part in the Anglo-Maratha War of 1817&#150;19 as a subaltern in A troop horse artillery, and received the medal with clasp for Mehidpur (21 December 1817). Promoted captain on 24 October 1824, he served at the siege of Kittur at the end of that year. He was principal commissary of ordnance from 1845 to 1850, and then had command of the horse artillery, and of the Madras artillery as brigadier. He left India in 1854, having &#145;filled, with the highest credit to himself, every appointment and command connected with his corps&#146;  (General Order, 10 Feb 1854). He became major-general on 28 November 1854, lieutenant-general on 14 July 1867, and general on 21 January 1872. On 7 August 1826 he had married Elizabeth, daughter of John Campbell of Ormidale, Argyll; they had no children. Whinyates died at 94 Sydney Place, Bath, on 22 January 1887.<br>
