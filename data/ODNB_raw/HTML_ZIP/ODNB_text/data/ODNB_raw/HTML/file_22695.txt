<span class="headword">Poyntz <span class="st"> [Poynts]</span>,  Sydenham <span class="st"> [Sednham]</span></span>  (<em>bap. </em>1607), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer</span>, was baptized on 3 November 1607, the fourth son of John Poynts of Reigate, Surrey, and his wife, Anne Skinner. His own spelling of his name was Sednham Poynts. Although he was of an established family little wealth remained and Poyntz was apprenticed to a London tradesman. This became the subject of chancery proceedings in light of a report that he had died at Rotterdam in July 1625. The proceedings suggest that Poyntz arrived in the Netherlands to escape either ill-treatment or prosecution for theft. Whatever the truth of his apprenticeship experience Poyntz was to record his military service on the continent between 1625 and 1636 in his fitfully accurate &#145;Relation&#146;. The report that he had died might have stemmed from a period of captivity which Poyntz, in his &#145;Relation&#146;, said occurred between 1626 and 1632.<br>
<br>During his military service Poyntz rose through the ranks and, according to his <span class="italic">Vindication</span> of 1646, was eventually knighted on the battlefield. In his &#145;Relation&#146; Poyntz claimed to have served first in English regiments in the Netherlands, entering Lord Vaux's regiment as a private soldier under a Captain Reysby, and soon after that the earl of Essex's regiment under Captain William Baillie. He went on to join the army of Count Mansfeld in Germany and Hungary, and it was following the break up of the army that, he later claimed, he became a prisoner of the Turks. Poyntz was present at the battle of Breitenfeld in 1631 alongside the forces of John George of Saxony, but some time afterwards he changed sides and entered the service of the imperial army, appearing as one of Wallenstein's captains at Lutzen in 1632. Such was the ferocity of that clash with the Swedes that Poyntz recorded that he had only three officers left out of twelve. Poyntz accompanied Wallenstein during his 1633 campaign in Silesia and was also present at Nordlingen in 1634. Although he left Germany after the peace of Prague in 1636 it is probable that at some point thereafter Poyntz returned to the continental wars.<br>
<br>While fighting on the continent Poyntz recorded his first two marriages. The first, to a rich German merchant's daughter about 1633, ended with her death in childbirth. In 1635 Poyntz married another German, whose name John Aubrey rendered as &#145;Anne Eleanora de Court Stephanus de Cary in W&uuml;rtemberg&#146;  (Aubrey, 4.212&#150;13). Poyntz, though not naming her, recalled she was &#145;rich in Land and mony, but of a higher birth and spirit, and therefore would live at a higher rate than our meanes would well afford&#146;  (Goodrick, 14.125). However, she and their child were killed by French troops returning from Italy through the estates which Poyntz had bought, probably in the vicinity of Schorndorf. It is possible that he married his third wife, Elizabeth, during his time on the continent for she was to describe herself in a letter to Speaker Lenthall in 1647 as a &#145;stranger in your kingdom&#146;  (Cary, 1.300&#150;01).<br>
<br>In 1636, after the death of his second wife, Poyntz went back to England and wrote his &#145;Relation&#146; in the house of the recusant Sir Lewis Tresham, brother of the gunpowder plotter Francis Tresham. The &#145;Relation&#146; indeed makes much of Poyntz's conversion to Roman Catholicism after his escape from captivity: &#145;that holy Church &hellip; wherein by Gods grace I mean to dy&#146;  (Goodrick, 54). Ten years later in his <span class="italic">Vindication</span> Poyntz was to deny charges that he was a papist, declaring that &#145;my constant Profession &hellip; from my first years, according to the Instructions of this my native Countrey have been in the Reformed Protestant Religion, and accordingly [I] have for many years been an elder of the Dutch church as is very well known&#146;  (ibid., 145). But Poyntz's stay in England seems to have been brief: the &#145;Relation&#146; ends with Poyntz, unable to find employment as a soldier in England, bidding &#145;a Longum Vale to my Country&#146;  (ibid., 130), and he almost certainly returned to his old career on the continent.<br>
<br>It is unclear when Poyntz returned to England again. The fact that he was voted &pound;200 by the Commons on 22 May 1645 for arrears suggests, however, that he had returned at the latest by some point in 1644. On 27 May 1645 the Commons ordered Poyntz to have command of regiments of horse and foot in the northern association. This was followed by his appointment as commander-in-chief of that army with the title of colonel-general. On 19 August 1645 Poyntz was nominated governor of York. However, despite their being more regularly paid than they had ever been under Lord Fairfax it was only under Poyntz's command that the troops mutinied.<br>
<br>Following Naseby Poyntz was ordered to follow the king, and he eventually forced an engagement with the royalists at Rowton Heath, Chester. In his letter of 25 September to Lenthall Poyntz explained how they had discovered the enemy within 3 miles of Chester. As he advanced towards them Poyntz encountered a part of the enemy force which he routed. The main engagement resulted in the destruction of the royalist force: the earl of Lichfield was killed and those captured included Sir Thomas Glenham, Sir Thomas Dacre, and Sir Philip Musgrave. In gratitude the Commons voted Poyntz &pound;500&#151;a payment which Lenthall confirmed by letter of 30 September 1645.<br>
<br>The day before Poyntz had outlined to the committee for war at York the general military situation, including his worries about the discontent among his Nottinghamshire regiment, the king's expectation of 5000 &#145;rebels&#146; from Ireland, and rumours of the approach of a royalist force from Newark. However, on the advice of Colonel Hutchinson Poyntz proceeded to Shelford House. Finding his summons returned in a scornful manner by the governor, Colonel Phillip Stanhope, and meeting stiff early resistance, Poyntz declared that no quarter would be given. Amid general slaughter Shelford was taken. The next day Wiverton House in Nottinghamshire, fearing similar treatment, yielded upon terms. Writing to Lenthall on 9 November 1645 Poyntz related that the strength of the garrison had meant that he gave them fair quarter. Having stressed his concern that no foot had arrived from the eastern garrisons Poyntz also expressed his dissatisfaction that he was more than &pound;400 out of purse. Poyntz moved on to lay siege to Newark. On 5 May 1646, while still undertaking that enterprise, Poyntz reported to Lenthall that the king had taken refuge with the Scots.<br>
<br>In February 1646 Poyntz published a <span class="italic">Vindication</span> to counter charges of ambition, debauchery, oppression of the country, and, in particular, about his religion. Denounced by some as a papist, Poyntz was accused by others of being neither religious himself, nor respecting it in others. Such claims were linked to the efforts of the &#145;presbyterian&#146; leaders in the Commons to include Poyntz's troops in their plans to dismantle or crush the New Model Army. In March 1647 the Commons declared that Poyntz's horse regiment was to be one of the four retained in England. The Commons had also voted Poyntz &pound;300 p.a. However, the &#145;presbyterian&#146; leaders had made the mistake of judging the troops by their commander.<br>
<br>In communication with the New Model, and aware of the increasing rift between the parliament and their southern comrades, the northern troops took the initiative. Although crucially aided by men from outside their ranks, such as Major Henry Lilburne, younger brother of the Leveller John, it is clear that the northern troops were also led by their own militants. A leading figure in the rebellion against Poyntz was Captain John Hodgson of Lionel Copley's regiment, the surgeon (and later Quaker) who was a close confidant of Colonel John Lambert. Lambert had originally been a leading officer in the northern army; he was now taking a leading role in the political action of the New Model. Poyntz informed Lenthall on 17 June that &#145;a surgeon of colonel Copley's regiment marched with the aforesaid colonel's own troop through Leeds to a rendezvous &hellip; the chirurgeon drew some papers out, and read to the soldiers, and told them, that the army in the south desired they should join with them&#146;  (Cary, 1.233&#150;5). At a second rendezvous the next day agitators were chosen.<br>
<br>The northern troops later justified their action by recounting how Poyntz had acted in concert with the Yorkshire presbyterian MP Philip Stapleton. They particularly focused on his removal of Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Fairfax, the kinsman of Sir Thomas Fairfax, and John Lambert, as governor of Clifford's Tower garrison in York who had been replaced with an ally, the lord mayor of York, Thomas Dickenson. Their action was also prompted by Poyntz's abuse of the New Model and of Fairfax, his recruiting of a reformado company (that is, a company of unemployed former soldiers) and his harsh treatment of soldiers whose political allegiance he suspected.<br>
<br>At the end of June 1647 Poyntz complained, to both Lenthall and Fairfax, that agitators from the New Model had stirred up his own troops: &#145;the soldiers are misinformed and deluded by such as are come out of the South, And some of our inferior officers in these parts&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 58, fol. 272). He informed Fairfax that he had orders from parliament to apprehend them. On 28 June Poyntz told his officers of Lilburne and Hodgson's attempt to &#145;putt this Army into confusion and distraction, pretending they were sent with authoritie from Sir Thomas Fairfax&#146;  (Firth, 1891, 143). However, Poyntz's complaint to Fairfax did not receive a sympathetic response. What particularly infuriated Poyntz, as he related it to Lionel Copley, was that the militants in his forces were preparing to present their grievances to Fairfax who had failed to denounce their actions, probably in the knowledge of Poyntz's willingness to turn on the New Model.<br>
<br>On 8 July 1647 Poyntz was seized at his York headquarters, and his wife, Elizabeth, was left to complain to Fairfax of how her husband had been &#145;carried away in his slippers&#146;  (Cary, 1.300&#150;01). Poyntz was taken to Fairfax at Reading and charged with having &#145;endeavoured to reimbroyle this Kingdom in a 2d warr &hellip; to justify the 11 accused Members and kept correspondency with them&#146;  (Firth, 1891, 168&#150;9). Having been released by Fairfax, Poyntz submitted his resignation in a letter to Lenthall. John Lambert was appointed, in his place, as commander of the northern association.<br>
<br>Poyntz arrived in London and with Edward Massey and Sir William Waller played a prominent role in the attempted counter-revolution. On 2 August entering the Guildhall yard Poyntz and the reformadoes under his control attacked a crowd of Independent-minded citizens who had come to present a petition for peace to the common council. Although one pamphlet claimed that Poyntz had acted in self defence against what was a &#145;rude rabble of Anabaptists&#146; others claimed that Poyntz and his troops &#145;in a cruel manner with their Swords hacked and hewed&#146; the crowd (<span class="italic">The Army Anatomized</span>, 24; Rushworth, 7.741).<br>
<br>Unable to resist the New Model and abandoned by their City allies, Poyntz and Massey, before fleeing, expressed their bitterness in their &#145;declaration&#146; of 9 August 1647. In a last plea from Amsterdam in May 1648 Poyntz claimed &#145;it would almost make a man desperate to see how I am slighted in place of the great rewards which the honourable houses were pleased to promise me&#146;  (Cary, 1.418). He played no role in the second civil war. Following his flight to the Netherlands, Poyntz was recorded as accompanying Lord Willoughby to the West Indies in 1650. There he became governor of the Leeward Islands, establishing himself at St Kitts. With the arrival of Sir George Ayscue's fleet and Willoughby's consequent surrender of Barbados, Poyntz, facing military defeat, supposedly fled to Virginia. However, the generous articles granted by Ayscue gave Poyntz the option of returning to Antigua with any others who had estates there. It is not clear whether he took advantage of these articles and though Poyntz is mentioned as governor of Antigua between 1661 and 1663 there is little evidence to support the conjecture that he filled this role. Indeed Poyntz effectively disappears from the historical record after his flight in the face of Ayscue.<br>
