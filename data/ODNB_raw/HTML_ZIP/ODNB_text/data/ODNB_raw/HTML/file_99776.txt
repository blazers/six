<span class="headword">Thoday,  John Marion</span>  (1916&#150;2008), <span class="occ">radiobiologist and geneticist</span>, was born on 30 August 1916 at 5 Lyme Park, Chinley, Derbyshire, the third of four sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36468/', "David Thoday (1883&#150;1964)")</script>, botanist, and his wife, Mary Gladys, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sykes (1884&#150;1943), also a botanist. From the ages of two to six he was brought up in South Africa, where his father was professor of botany at the University of Cape Town; the family then settled in Bangor on his father's appointment as professor of botany at the University College of North Wales. He was educated at Bootham School, York, and then (much influenced by both his parents) read botany at Bangor, where his father was still head of department. In 1939 he graduated with an upper-second-class degree and began research into the effects of neutrons on chromosomes for a PhD at Trinity College, Cambridge, supervised by David Catcheside. His research was interrupted by the Second World War, and from 1941 to 1946 he worked as a photographic intelligence officer in the RAF, in Britain, North Africa, and Italy; he was promoted squadron leader in 1944. He eventually completed his Cambridge PhD in 1948.<br>
<br>On demobilization in 1946 Thoday found work as a cytologist and radiobiologist at the Mont Vernon Hospital and Radium Institute, at Northwood, Middlesex. His work there with John Read on the biological effects of radiation was highly significant, leading to ground-breaking papers showing, first, that the radiotherapeutic effect of X-rays on tissue growth was largely due to chromosome breakage, and, second, that X-rays are far more effective at causing chromosome breakage in the presence of oxygen.<br>
<br>In 1947 Thoday was appointed assistant lecturer in cytogenetics at the University of Sheffield. There he introduced teaching of genetics to students of botany and zoology, and in 1954, appointed a senior lecturer, founded and led the university's new department of genetics. By this time his interests had switched from radiobiology to quantitative and evolutionary genetics, and in 1953 he published in the <span class="italic">Symposia of the Society for Experimental Biology</span> a highly influential theoretical paper, &#145;Components of Fitness&#146;, which underscored the importance of genetic flexibility for evolutionary potential. While at Sheffield he served the university in a number of ways, including as sub-warden of Crewe Hall, secretary of the non-professorial staff association, and secretary then president of the University Philosophical Society. He also, on 4 July 1950, married Doris Joan Rich (<i>b</i>. 1923), a sociologist, and daughter of Samuel Rich, draper; they had a daughter, Antonia (<i>b</i>. 1954), and a son, Jonathan (<i>b</i>. 1961).<br>
<br>In 1959 Thoday returned to Cambridge as the Arthur Balfour professor of genetics (succeeding the eminent geneticist R. A. Fisher), head of the department of genetics, and fellow of Emmanuel College. Within a few years he had succeeded where his predecessors had failed, in having genetics taught in part one of the natural sciences tripos. He also oversaw two moves of his department, first from its cramped quarters in Storeys Way to a much more spacious site on Milton Road, and then in 1976, following the move of the Cavendish Laboratory, to the central Downing site.<br>
<br>At Cambridge Thoday continued the work he had started at Sheffield on the mechanisms of genetic variance and evolutionary change, illustrating the ways in which individual species adapt and respond to their environments. Perhaps his most significant work, in collaboration with J. B. Gibson, was on the common fruit fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Thoday and Gibson selected two groups from a single culture of <i>Drosophila</i>, differentiated by high and low bristle numbers, finding that, despite the two groups being allowed to interbreed freely, they continued to show significant genetic divergence in subsequent generations when placed in distinctively different environments, albeit within a short distance from each other. This work confirmed the hypothesis of &#145;disruptive selection&#146; first noticed by Charles Darwin among the finch populations of the Galapagos Islands (with the emergence of two different populations of finches, one with long beaks adapted to retrieving large seeds, and another with small beaks adapted to retrieving small seeds). The accepted wisdom at the time suggested that animal and plant populations could only exhibit sustained genetic differences when they were geographically separated, whereas Thoday's and Gibson's work suggested that species could adapt selectively to different &#145;niches&#146; within a single locality. Hence genetic separation was not a prerequisite for genetic divergence; indeed, genetic divergence could result from localized environmental factors and could lead in time to the development of separate species.<br>
<br>A gregarious, ebullient man who enjoyed controversy and the cut-and-thrust of debate, Thoday was also an excellent supervisor and much-loved head of department, who interested himself in his students' research and loved nothing better than to play darts and discuss research problems over a lunchtime pint. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1965, and served as president of the Genetical Society in 1975&#150;8. He retired in 1983 (becoming an emeritus professor at Cambridge and a life fellow of Emmanuel College), but from 1982 to 1988 was active as the chairman of the UK National Committee for Biology. He was devoted to his college, presenting it with two chimeric trees, one a hawthorn core with a layer of medlar, and the other a laburnum core with a layer of creeping broom. A humanist&#151;&#145;since I was about sixteen I have found religion makes no sense&#146;, he said  (John Thoday website, &#145;funeral service&#146;)&#151;he described his political views as those of an &#145;old-fashioned liberal&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 3 Oct 2008). In line with his research, he had no truck with either extreme in the nature versus nurture debate, emphasizing the creative interplay of inheritance and environment. He remained in Cambridge in retirement, and died at his home, 7 Clarkson Road, on 25 August 2008, following a stroke. He was survived by his wife, Doris, an emeritus fellow of Lucy Cavendish College, and their two children. His funeral was held on 16 September and a memorial service was held in Emmanuel College chapel on 22 November 2008.<br>
