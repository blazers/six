<span class="headword">Tropnell,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1487), <span class="occ">landowner and administrator</span>, was the son of Harry Tropnell and his wife, Edith Roche. Both families were long established in north-west Wiltshire as minor gentry, but it is unlikely that Harry Tropnell owned land there or elsewhere. Thomas Tropnell was an ambitious pragmatist whose newly acquired wealth from commerce and judicious shifts of political allegiance enabled him to establish and maintain himself, often by dubious means, as a landed gentleman in his native county. The house he rebuilt at Great Chalfield, where the cartulary recording the title deeds of his purchases is still preserved, and chapels constructed for him at Great Chalfield and Corsham, survive as symbols of his success. Tropnell's early career, and presumably the basis of his wealth, was in commerce, and he was a merchant trading through Bristol in the 1450s. He married first in 1431 Agnes (<i>d</i>. before 1453), widow of Thomas Bourton, and second, in 1456, his kinswoman Margaret Ludlow (<i>d</i>. by 1479), daughter of William Ludlow (<i>d</i>. 1478) and widow of John Erley. With Margaret, Tropnell had two sons, Humphrey (<i>fl</i>. 1463&#150;1464), who predeceased him, and Christopher (<i>d</i>. 1503), his heir, and two daughters, Anne (<i>fl</i>. 1464), and Mary (<i>fl</i>. 1464&#150;1487).<br>
<br>As a young man Tropnell became a retainer of the powerful Hungerford family, and, possibly under the patronage of Humphrey Stafford, earl of Stafford, was MP for Great Bedwyn in 1429&#150;30 and for Bath in 1449. His business acumen and legal knowledge were also used by later Hungerfords: Robert, Lord Hungerford (<i>d</i>. 1459), probably his contemporary, for whom he acted as receiver-general and feoffee, and who bequeathed to him a silver cup; his son Robert, Lord Hungerford and Moleyns (<i>d</i>. 1464); and the younger Robert's sons Sir Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1469), and Sir Walter (<i>d</i>. 1516). His association with the Hungerfords and Staffords naturally brought him into prominence in the county. In September 1450, with Robert, Lord Hungerford, and his son Robert, Tropnell was appointed a commissioner to find, arrest, and try rebels in Wiltshire. He served on other commissions in 1451 and 1459. His service to the family was uninterrupted and unaffected by the attainder in 1461 and execution in May 1464 of Robert, Lord Hungerford and Moleyns, a Lancastrian in arms.<br>
<br>Tropnell was also prepared to court the Yorkists. In his ultimately successful attempt to resist the claim of a retainer of James Butler, the Lancastrian earl of Wiltshire, on Lyngevers manor in Chicklade, which he acquired in portions between 1453 and 1460, he petitioned the future Edward IV and in August 1464 obtained a general pardon from him. During the readeption of Henry VI he was appointed on 27 October 1470, with George, duke of Clarence, and Richard Neville, earl of Warwick and Salisbury, as a commissioner of oyer and terminer in Wiltshire. He was also a JP for Wiltshire in late 1470. Those services, and acknowledgement of his considerable, though possibly informally acquired, legal ability, may have secured his admission to Lincoln's Inn as an honorary member at Michaelmas 1470. His appointment in August 1473 as a commissioner to inquire into farms paid to the crown from lands in Wiltshire shows that he was trusted by the Yorkists and prepared to serve them with equal diligence. He was pardoned in March 1484 by Richard III, possibly for complicity in Buckingham's rebellion in October 1483. His typical circumspection may have prompted him to obtain a general pardon from Henry VII in 1485.<br>
<br>From 1431 Tropnell lived in a house at Atworth inherited by his first wife and conveyed to him on their marriage, and by 1453 he lived at Neston near Corsham in a house built on land acquired in 1442. From the time of his first marriage he built up by purchase a substantial landed estate in the county. The titles to all the properties were defective, except those to Atworth, Neston, East Harnham manor bought in 1453 from Robert, Lord Hungerford, and the advowson of Great Cheverell bought in 1476 from Margaret, Lady Hungerford and Botreaux. His claim on Great Chalfield manor and advowson, in which he bought an interest in 1437, was not established until 1467. An estate in Maiden Bradley, East Codford, and West Codford was acquired between 1441 and 1447, Lyngevers manor in Chicklade between 1453 and 1460, Hindon manor between 1452 and 1460, and Little Durnford manor with comparatively little trouble in 1474. The legal process, usually tortuous and lengthy, by which most of them were purchased, and a pedigree in which he claimed descent from the Percys of Great Chalfield were entered by Tropnell in a register of deeds which was begun on 2 November 1464 and added to until his death. In 1465 he bought a stone quarry at Hazelbury near Box and, presumably from 1467, began to rebuild the manor house at Great Chalfield in lavish style. He lived on the estate only in his last years.<br>
<br>Richard Page and William King, adversaries of Tropnell in his negotiations for Lyngevers manor in 1453, described him as &#145;a perillous covetouse man&#146;, an assessment with which Tropnell may have concurred since it was transcribed into his cartulary  (Tropnell, 2.39). That view of his character is echoed, with an element of caricature, in a wall painting, possibly of Tropnell himself, which survives on the south wall of the dining room at Great Chalfield. To Great Chalfield church, which stood north-east of the manor house and inside its precinct, Tropnell added a south chapel decorated with wall paintings and separated from the nave by a screen embellished with arms depicting his claim to descend from the Percy family and his marriage with Margaret Ludlow. He was said to have died on 31 January 1488 but his death must have occurred between 5 November 1487, when he made his will, and 22 November 1487, when a writ of <i>diem clausit extremum</i> was issued. In the south chapel of Corsham church, rebuilt for him as his burial place, he and Margaret were entombed beneath a chest bearing their arms. In his will, proved by his son Christopher on 26 February 1488, he observed fashionable piety and endowed a chantry in the chapel for them both and for certain Hungerfords. Though his career had no national importance, he stands as an exemplar of a particular kind of late medieval gentleman on the make, often a lawyer or expert in the law, who was willing to play fast and loose in local politics and exploit all the opportunities offered by local and national political crises to build up a landed estate. Tropnell also happens to have left a superb memorial of his life, in records and in bricks, mortar, and paint.<br>
