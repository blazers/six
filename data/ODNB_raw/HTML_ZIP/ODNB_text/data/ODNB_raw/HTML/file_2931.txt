<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boscawen,  Edward</span>  (1711&#150;1761), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, was born on 19 August 1711, the third of five sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2933/', "Hugh Boscawen, first Viscount Falmouth (c.1680&#150;1734)")</script>, politician and courtier, and Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1754), eldest daughter of Charles Godfrey and his wife, Arabella, sister of the duke of Marlborough. He ranks among the most important of the navy's officers in the mid-eighteenth century.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer17261742"></a>Early career, 1726&#150;1742</h2>Edward Boscawen entered the navy in 1726 and sailed for the West Indies on 9 April in the <i>Superbe</i> (60 guns) as part of the squadron under Vice-Admiral Francis Hosier. After service in the <i>Superbe</i> lasting nearly three years he served on the <i>Canterbury</i>, <i>Hector</i>, and <i>Namur</i> in home waters and the Mediterranean. After his promotion to lieutenant on 25 May 1732 he was appointed successively to the <i>Hector</i> and <i>Grafton</i> and then on 12 March 1737 to the command of the <i>Leopard</i>. In June 1738 he was appointed to the command of the <i>Shoreham</i> (20 guns), and a year later he was ordered to the West Indies where he was stationed at the outbreak of hostilities with Spain. Shortly afterwards the <i>Shoreham</i> ran aground near Cape Antonio at the western end of Cuba, and was forced to jettison her guns and stores. As a consequence she was refitting at Jamaica in November 1739 when Admiral Edward Vernon sailed to attack the Spanish at Porto Bello. Boscawen served as a volunteer on the flagship and, after a successful attack, assisted Captain Knowles in the destruction of Porto Bello's fortifications. He spent 1740 cruising with the <i>Shoreham</i> off Tortuga and Havana, capturing a small Spanish privateer and in August recapturing two colonial ships. In early 1741 Boscawen took part in Vernon's expedition to Cartagena, commanding seamen and marines in a successful night attack on shore batteries, spiking the guns, and destroying the platforms and carriages. In a letter to the governor of Jamaica, Vernon commented that &#145;Captain Boscawen, all say made a prudent general in the disposing his men landing in as good order as could be expected for night work in an unknown country&#146;  (Ranft, 195&#150;6). He was then put in charge of the destruction of the fortifications at Boca Chica. During the expedition Boscawen was promoted captain and succeeded Lord Aubrey Beauclerk in the command of the <i>Prince Frederick</i> (70 guns). Shortly after his return to England in May 1742 he was appointed to the <i>Dreadnought</i> (60 guns). On 11 December he married Frances Evelyn Glanville (1719&#150;1805) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47078/', "Boscawen, Frances Evelyn")</script>], great-great-niece of the diarist John Evelyn. They had three sons and two daughters. George, the third son, became third Viscount Falmouth on the death of his uncle.<h2>
<a name="Captain17421747"></a>Captain, 1742&#150;1747</h2>Having been promoted captain in 1742, Boscawen spent the spring of the following year cruising off the Azores with the <i>Dreadnought</i> and the <i>Deptford</i> to intercept the Spanish trade. Later in 1743 he was attached to the Home Fleet under Sir John Norris. Before any official declaration of war a French fleet commanded by De Roquefeuil cruised in the channel to assist in an invasion on the Thames from Dunkirk. On 24 February 1744 Norris found the French anchored off Dungeness but as the wind was foul he could get no closer to the enemy than 8 miles. Both fleets were dispersed by a gale the following day. On 7 March the <i>Dreadnought</i> was ordered to convoy Dutch troops to England. In the following April the <i>Dreadnought</i> joined Sir Charles Hardy's squadron escorting victuallers bound for the Mediterranean clear of Brest. On 24 April south-west of Ushant, the French <i>Med&eacute;e</i> (26 guns) was sighted and the <i>Dreadnought</i> and <i>Grampus</i> were detached in pursuit. After a chase of fifty hours the <i>Med&eacute;e</i> was taken. She was subsequently purchased and fitted out as the <i>Boscawen</i>, privateer. May found the <i>Dreadnought</i>, in company with the <i>Prince Frederick</i>, stationed off Cape Clear to intercept privateers and to warn the homeward trade of the declaration of war with France. On 11 July both ships fell in with a French squadron of thirteen ships 85 leagues south-south-west of the Lizard. The <i>Dreadnought</i> kept up a constant fire from her stern chasers as the two ships were pursued throughout the night and into the afternoon of the following day. It was during this skirmish that an incident occurred that would dissuade Boscawen from allowing his officers standing cabins in all his future commands. He remarked that on &#145;taking down the officer's Cabins to clear ship and bring the stern chasers to bear on the enemy, I found much bottled liquor which being directed to be thrown overboard much of it was drunk by the seamen, that when I engaged soon after were so drunk as not to be able to do their duty, and had the French done theirs, I must have inevitably been taken&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/90, fol. 275).<br>
<br>At the end of the year Boscawen commanded the guardship <i>Royal Sovereign</i> at the Nore until appointed to the <i>Namur</i> (74 guns) in January 1746. The <i>Namur</i> was attached to the western squadron first under Admiral William Martin and then George Anson. The fleet cruised to intercept returning French squadrons and Boscawen was entrusted with the command of an advance squadron. In October 1746 Anson returned to Plymouth leaving Boscawen on station. From letters found in a prize Boscawen anticipated Anson's orders to cruise off Cape Clear and intercept Admiral d'Anville on his return from America. Having been rejoined by Anson, the <i>Namur</i> chased and captured d'Anville's hospital ship, the <i>Mercure</i>, on 25 November; however, the French, learning that the British fleet lay in wait off Brest, steered for Rochefort and safety.<br>
<br>On 3 May 1747 the first decisive sea battle of the war took place off Cape Finisterre. At about nine in the morning the <i>Namur</i> signalled that a fleet was in sight to the south-west. This was Admiral De la Jonqui&egrave;re escorting the India and Canada convoys. Anson signalled a general chase during which the <i>Namur</i> was one of the leading ships. According to Boscawen the <i>Namur</i> &#145;came very near three or four of them where we were warmly engaged on both sides for about three-quarters of an hour &hellip; we then shot ahead and about half past four engaged the S&eacute;rieux (flag) within pistol shot more than half-an-hour when she struck to us&#146;  (Richmond, 3.92). Boscawen was close to the top of the captains' list and due for elevation to flag rank and Anson ensured his promotion by writing to the duke of Bedford at the Admiralty: &#145;Boscawen got a shot in the shoulder, but is almost well; his behaviour in the action pleased me, and I hope your Grace will make him a rear-admiral&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.214). Such was his professional esteem that Boscawen's name had already been suggested for the overall command of an expedition to India even before the news of the battle off Finisterre reached the Admiralty.<h2>
<a name="Rearadmiral17471755"></a>Rear-admiral, 1747&#150;1755</h2>With a squadron of six ships of the line, including the <i>Namur</i>, several smaller vessels, fourteen East India Company ships, and an army of 1200 men and 800 marines, Boscawen sailed for the Cape on 4 November 1747. His instructions were not binding but recommended that he proceed from the Cape to take Rodriquez, then Mauritius, proceed to Isle Bourbon and Madagascar, and next sail to the Coromandel coast to take Chandanagar and Mah&eacute;. Reaching Mauritius on 23 June, the expedition discovered that with advance warning the French had erected defences along the coast, and after one unsuccessful attempt a council of war agreed that the attack on Mauritius should be abandoned in favour of more important objectives. Accordingly Boscawen proceeded to Fort St David, arriving on 26 July, and after being joined by Admiral Griffith's squadron sailed immediately to attack Pondicherry. The initial attack was repulsed with heavy casualties due to faulty intelligence, provided by the engineers, on the strength of the defences. Cannon were landed from the fleet and the advance defences were eventually taken. The French commander, Dupleix, settled down to a siege knowing that the monsoon would create such difficulties for the British that the siege could not last. Fever soon broke out among the British forces and when the rains began at the end of September Boscawen abandoned the attack and withdrew the army. In any event a peace had been negotiated between Britain and France before the siege of Pondicherry had commenced. Boscawen received news of this in November but was instructed to remain on station until a peace was concluded. While off St David's on 12 April 1749, the <i>Namur</i> was lost with all hands in a hurricane. Boscawen and his staff were ashore at the time. He left for England in October and arrived there in April 1750.<br>
<br>In 1749 Boscawen had purchased the estate of Hatchlands near Guildford in Surrey. He had the existing Tudor house demolished and in 1756 began a new house said by Boscawen's wife to have been built at the expense of his country's enemies. This was completed in 1758, and is now a property of the National Trust. Boscawen was appointed a commissioner of the Admiralty on 22 June 1751 and in the same year an elder brother of Trinity House. Boscawen retained his place at the Admiralty despite the political troubles on the formation of the Devonshire ministry in 1756, and again in 1757 when Anson returned to the Admiralty. He had been advanced to the rank of vice-admiral on 6 February 1755 and had developed an unshakeable reputation that was about to see him become one of the foremost naval officers of the time.<h2>
<a name="TheSevenYearsWar17561763"></a>The Seven Years' War, 1756&#150;1763</h2>In 1755, as relations between Britain and France rapidly deteriorated, Boscawen was placed in command of a secret expedition to intercept a French squadron bound for Louisbourg in Canada but also carrying troop reinforcements to the French position in Ohio where the war had already broken out. He sailed on 21 April 1755 with his flag on the <i>Torbay</i> (74 guns). On passage across the Atlantic the squadron exercised regularly at gun drill and on 3 June encountered thick fogs. On 9 June three large ships were sighted. Boscawen hoisted French colours but when he failed to answer their private signal, the three vessels bore away. They were the <i>Alcide</i> (64 guns) and the <i>Lys</i>, the latter fitted as a transport, and the <i>Dauphin Royal</i>. The <i>Dunkirk</i> (Captain Howe) led the chase and coming alongside the rearmost hailed her to shorten sail and speak with the admiral. The French asked if it was peace or war to which Howe replied peace but added that they should prepare for war. Boscawen then made the signal to engage at which point the <i>Dunkirk</i> opened her fire, and as the <i>Torbay</i> came up to engage the <i>Alcide</i> struck her flag. The <i>Lys</i> surrendered after a two-hour running fight with the <i>Defiance</i> and the third ship escaped. By an unfortunate turn of luck the <i>Alcide</i>'s captain, Hocquart, who had also been taken in the <i>Diamant</i> at the battle of Cape Finisterre in the last war and in the <i>Med&eacute;e</i> in 1744, now found that he had been captured by Boscawen for the third time.<br>
<br>The news of the engagement was popular with the public but placed the government in an awkward situation. Most of the French armament had arrived safely in Canada and by capturing only an insignificant part of it, Britain was now seen as an aggressor but without the benefit of a successful pre-emptive blow against her enemy. Hardwicke, the lord chancellor, was of the opinion that Boscawen had &#145;done too much or too little&#146;  (Corbett, 1.57&#150;8). He had not been made aware of the political and diplomatic consequences of his instructions though he may have guessed at them. In any event he was not blamed for executing his orders nor is it likely, given the circumstances, that Boscawen would have declined an engagement with the French. He was not to know that the bulk of the French expedition had already reached Louisbourg or that the three ships in sight were not part of a larger fleet still at sea. Retiring to Halifax after the engagement, the squadron was very sickly and suffered the loss of 2000 men before returning to Spithead.<br>
<br>On 6 May 1756, with his flag on <i>Invincible</i> (74 guns), Boscawen joined Edward Hawke's fleet off Ushant. As in the previous year his crews were regularly exercised at the guns with live firing at targets. Writing to his wife on 24 June he mischievously commented, &#145;we are at this minute practising firing, it being calm and many of the fellows hit the mark, <i>note nobody is firing at them</i>&#146;  (Kemp, 229). It was while off Ushant that Boscawen heard of the debacle of Admiral John Byng and the loss of Minorca. He has been noted as having a share in the responsibility for the trial and execution of Admiral Byng and was therefore a consenting party to his death  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Even though he was involved Boscawen was not one of the judges at the court martial and would have gladly avoided any part in the proceedings. His letters, however, make his feelings clear. The conduct of Byng's fleet was a &#145;scandal&#146; and &#145;Byng's letters would have written him coward before any jury in the world&#146;. He also expressed the opinion that &#145;if more regard was had to the characters of men before they are put in the way of high commands, the Service would make a better figure&#146;. Yet he also wrote that if Byng &#145;was to blame, he was not the only person to be blamed&#146;  (Kemp, 228, 231&#150;2, 218).<br>
<br>On 29 July 1756 Boscawen transferred his flag to the <i>Royal George</i> (100 guns). The health of the fleet was a preoccupation of many senior officers who appreciated that fresh provisions, adequate rest, and healthy conditions for the men were a prerequisite for efficient operations. However, long cruises in search of enemy squadrons and convoys as well as the close blockade of French naval arsenals required an almost constant presence at sea. Boscawen paid particular care to the health of his officers and men though he was not aware of the precise causes of scurvy. He had Dr Hales's ventilators installed in the <i>Royal George</i> and later in the <i>Namur</i>. (Hales was his wife's cousin.) These provided a means of circulating fresh air below decks. He was convinced that bad air contributed to the sickness of the men, having had three sailors in the <i>Torbay</i> suffocate in the bad air from the well. In August 1756 many of his squadron were sickly, and writing to John Clevland, the secretary of the Admiralty, he gave it as his opinion and that of some of his captains that the sickness among the men was due in part &#145;&hellip; to their want of rest when their ships are sent in to clean, being hurried again to sea before they are recovered&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/90, fol. 60). It was also Boscawen's belief that something in the sailors' diet rather than something missing from it was the cause of scurvy; &#145;I eat very little meat and therefore it is impossible the sea scurvy should ever take hold of me&#146;  (Kemp, 245). Many of the measures introduced into the flagship had a positive effect. In September he wrote, &#145;This ship has now been at sea twelve weeks, which is longer than I ever knew any first-rate ever at sea&#146;  (ibid., 248).<br>
<br>On 7 February 1758 Boscawen was made an admiral of the blue and appointed to command the fleet sent to capture Louisbourg as a preliminary to the conquest of Quebec. The expedition sailed on 23 February but due to foul winds and calms took eleven weeks to reach Halifax where the entire fleet at last assembled on 24 May. The French meanwhile had managed to reinforce their position and when Boscawen appeared off Louisbourg on 2 June, the British faced 6000 Frenchmen and five ships of the line anchored to defend the harbour. Landings were made south of Louisbourg at Gabarus Bay. Generals Jeffrey Amherst and James Wolfe laid siege to the town, impeded by the fire of the French warships. On 21 June one of these, the <i>C&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>, caught fire and the flames spread to two of the other ships. By 25 June the town was so battered that only the two remaining warships, the <i>Bienfaisant</i> and <i>Prudent</i>, were able to maintain a resistance. Boscawen ordered them to be cut out and that night both were boarded, the <i>Prudent</i> being set alight and the <i>Bienfaisant</i> towed out of the harbour. After the surrender of Louisbourg, Amherst and Wolfe were anxious to press on to Quebec but Boscawen raised objections. Provisions were short, he had 5000 prisoners, and it was late in the season so the descent on Quebec was postponed until the following year. Returning to England with the <i>Bienfaisant</i> prize, Boscawen, on 27 October, encountered the homeward bound Quebec squadron, commanded by Du Chaffault, with a captured Indiaman. Boscawen pursued the French, recapturing the Indiaman.<h2>
<a name="ThebattleofLagos1759"></a>The battle of Lagos, 1759</h2>On 2 February 1759 Boscawen was sworn of the privy council, and in April he sailed with six ships for the Mediterranean with his flag on the <i>Namur</i> (90 guns). There he joined Vice-Admiral Broderick and took overall command of the fleet off Toulon. His instructions were to protect trade, secure Gibraltar, and above all prevent the Toulon fleet under de la Clue from passing the strait and joining the French Atlantic squadrons in their attempt to support an invasion of England. He was further instructed to follow the French if they succeeded in breaking out, but how he carried out these orders was left to his discretion. Boscawen was forced to withdraw to Gibraltar to water and refit his ships, arriving there on 4 August. Two frigates were detached to watch for the French. Meanwhile de la Clue had sailed from Toulon on 5 August with twelve ships of the line and hoped to pass Gibraltar undetected by following the north African coast. He was seen by the <i>Gibraltar</i> frigate on 16 August and on the following evening the alarm was raised. The British squadron was busy refitting and largely unprepared to sail with many officers and men ashore. There followed a &#145;stampede&#146; to get on the ships and within three hours, at about 10 p.m., Boscawen with eight ships of the line was in pursuit of the French who were now steering for Cape St Vincent. During the night the French rearguard made for Cadiz, leaving de la Clue with seven ships of the line which were sighted by Boscawen the following morning. At first the French admiral imagined that the British ships were his missing rearguard, but he soon realized his mistake. Off Lagos he was overtaken and at 2.30 p.m. the action opened. At about 4 p.m. Boscawen engaged the French flagship <i>Ocean</i>, the <i>Namur</i> losing her mizzen mast. With the <i>Ocean</i> making off, the <i>Namur</i> joined the <i>Culloden</i> in the capture of the <i>Centaur</i>. Boscawen next shifted his flag from the damaged <i>Namur</i> to the <i>Newark</i> (80 guns) and continued the chase through the night. At daylight the remaining four French ships were seen making for Lagos Bay. Here the French admiral ran his flagship ashore: she and the <i>Redoubtable</i> were then burnt. The <i>Temeraire</i> and <i>Modeste</i> were captured despite being at anchor in neutral waters. Boscawen then took up station off Cape St Vincent to intercept the remainder of the French; not seeing them, he sailed to join the Channel Fleet as his instructions directed and anchored at Spithead on 1 September. Boscawen's violation of Portugal's neutral waters raised a diplomatic storm but his actions received the full approval of his superiors and the public. For his service he was made a general of marines with an annual salary of &pound;3000. During 1760 Boscawen commanded the fleet in Quiberon Bay where his ships received fresh meat and vegetables from Ireland. Regular fresh provisions made extended operations at sea possible. In June Boscawen wrote: &#145;The ships are healthy and I hope to keep them so &hellip; As the Monmouth now goes in, not sickly, to clean, she will be in a very short time in a good condition for any service&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/90, fol. 255).<h2>
<a name="Politicalcareer17421761"></a>Political career, 1742&#150;1761</h2>Boscawen was a member of parliament, having represented Truro since 1742. The Boscawens were already an important and popular family in local politics, especially as the admiral could provide places and career opportunities for local sons, creating what his wife termed &#145;a little navy of your own making&#146;  (Rodger, &#145;&#147;A little navy&#148;&#146;). In 1753 Boscawen had attempted to break the monopoly of tory families in the county representation by putting up a third tory candidate who subsequently withdrew. In October 1760 Boscawen took the initiative and declared himself a candidate. He was supported by James Buller, one of the sitting members, the other withdrawing from the contest. Boscawen took this action without consultation with his brother, Viscount Falmouth, or any of the political managers, displeasing those who felt that the opinion of the county should have been sought before any change was made. Controversy was avoided by the admiral's death. Boscawen's having taken so much care over the health of his men, it was a cruel twist of fate that he should die of a fever at his home at Hatchlands, on 10 January 1761, depriving Britain of the service of one of its finest naval officers. He was buried that year at the church of St Michael Penkevil, in Cornwall.<h2>
<a name="Character"></a>Character</h2>Boscawen was a determined and confident officer who ensured that those who served him were properly trained and cared for. In his personal life he was devoted to his wife and children. His letters home indicate a happy family life, a sense of humour, and a constant attention not only to the happiness of his family but also to the detail and management of his house and estate. Like every great leader he combined resolution with compassion, single-mindedness with understanding. He had a close working relationship with John Clevland, the secretary of the Admiralty. He applied to Clevland for a sixty-year-old French prisoner-of-war to be exchanged, regarding the man, because of his age, as no great enemy to the nation. He would take the trouble to write to Clevland about the quality of shoes supplied to a marine on one of the ships of his squadron. He would use his own banker to help some of his men to remit their wages to their families, thus saving them expense (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/384, 10 April 1759; 1/90, fols. 45, 17; Rodger, <span class="italic">The Wooden World</span>, 132). He took a constant care over the well-being of his officers and men yet personal feelings and inclinations would not stand in the way of duty. William Pitt remarked to him that &#145;when I apply to other officers respecting any expedition I may chance to project, they always make difficulties: you find expedients&#146;  (Corbett, 2.101). Nicknamed Old Dreadnought by his sailors, he gave his personal following loyal support yet would not suffer fools gladly. His circle of professional friends and followers included John Brett, Francis Geary, and Savage Mostyn with whom he had a fond and effective working relationship. He held an unfavourable opinion of officers like John Byng and Francis Holburne. Holburne had &#145;contrived to insinuate himself into the good graces of Lord Anson, &hellip; I don't like him, nor ever did, having known him from my first entering into the service&#146;  (Kemp, 194). Nor would he brook the least action which impaired the efficient running of his squadron. In 1759, when getting under way from St Helens, the fireship <i>Salamander</i> failed to weigh anchor. It transpired that the captain was on shore without the admiral's leave. Boscawen not only called for a court martial on the captain but also her lieutenant: &#145;I think the Lieutenant as much to blame for not making sail, when he saw he must lose company with me by staying behind. I desire that they both be tryed at a court martial for their behaviour&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/384, 20 April 1759). In terms of ability and professionalism, Boscawen prefigured many of the great names that would emerge later in the century. This is well illustrated by the fact that, along with Hawke, he was regularly chosen for the most important commands. He was also the only officer to retain his position at the Admiralty throughout the 1750s, a feat even Anson could not equal. Boscawen was a thoroughly professional naval officer in all respects and his early death was a great loss to his country.<br>
