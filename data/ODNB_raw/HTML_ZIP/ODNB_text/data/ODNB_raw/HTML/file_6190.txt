<span class="headword">Cooke,  William</span>  (1757&#150;1832), <span class="occ">legal writer</span>, second son of John Cooke, was born at Calcutta, where his father was an administrator. He was educated at Harrow School and was admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn on 19 November 1777. He was called to the bar there in November 1782, and in 1785 published <span class="italic">A Compendious System of the Bankrupt Laws</span>. He soon obtained a considerable practice in chancery and bankruptcy, and in 1816 was made KC and bencher of his inn.<br>
<br>In 1818 Cooke was commissioned by Sir John Leach to proceed to Milan for the purpose of collecting evidence concerning the conduct of Queen Caroline. He reached Milan in September of that year, and reported the result of his investigations in July 1819. The report, which was forthwith laid before the cabinet, led to the introduction of the celebrated bill of pains and penalties against the queen in the House of Lords on 5 July 1820: this accused Caroline of &#145;licentious behaviour&#146;, and proposed to dissolve her marriage. About this time Cooke began to be much troubled by frequent attacks of gout, which caused him to abandon court practice. He continued, however, to practise as a chamber counsel until 1825, when he retired from the profession. He was one of the witnesses examined before the commission on chancery procedure in 1824.<br>
<br>During the last few years of his life Cooke resided at his house, Wrinsted Court, Frinsted, Kent, where he died on 14 September 1832. His work on the <span class="italic">Bankrupt Laws</span> passed through eight editions by 1823, and was, during his life, the standard authority on the subject. Cooke is often erroneously credited with the works of the writer William Cooke (<i>d</i>. 1824).<br>
