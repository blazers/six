<span class="headword">Dignum,  Charles</span>  (1765?&#150;1827), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born at Rotherhithe, London, probably in 1765. His father, a master tailor and a Roman Catholic, moved to Wild Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, and young Dignum became a chorister at the Sardinian chapel; there his fine voice attracted the attention of Samuel Webbe, the organist, who taught him music. Dignum, however, wished to become a priest, and was prevented only by his father being too poor to pay for his training. A proposed apprenticeship to a carver and gilder was cut short after nine months. He was then articled for seven years to the composer Thomas Linley. For the first two years Linley would not let him sing in public, so as to allow his voice to mature. He made his d&eacute;but at Drury Lane, as young Meadows in <span class="italic">Love in a Village</span>, on 14 October 1784; according to the advertisements he was received by a packed house with unbounded applause. He appeared in Michael Arne's <span class="italic">Cymon</span> on 26 November and as Damon in Boyce's <span class="italic">The Chaplet</span> on 18 December. Dignum remained associated with Drury Lane during the greater part of his life, but for an interval at Covent Garden in 1792&#150;4. At both theatres his salary, where known, was &pound;4 a week. He had a fine tenor voice, but his build was clumsy, ultimately fat, and he seems to have been good-natured but somewhat stupid. He sang both leading and supporting parts, chiefly in ballad opera, pantomime, and musical romance; his speciality was patriotic, sailor, and sentimental songs, some of which he composed himself. He was particularly successful as Tom Tug in <span class="italic">The Waterman</span> and as Crop in <span class="italic">No Song, No Supper</span>. He also sang oratorio, and on 28 March 1800 took part at Covent Garden in the first London performance of Haydn's <span class="italic">The Creation</span>. During the summers Dignum sang at Vauxhall, where he was a great favourite. In 1786 he married the heiress daughter of Charles Rennett, an attorney of the Middle Temple; she died at 23 New North Street, Red Lion Square, in 1799, and of their children only one daughter survived. Dignum's name disappears from the theatre bills after 1812. He died of inflammation of the lungs at his home, 47 Gloucester Street, Queen Square, on 29 March 1827. He is said to have accumulated, together with his wife's property, a fortune of some &pound;30,000.<br>
