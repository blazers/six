<span class="headword">Dibdin,  Henry Edward</span>  (1813&#150;1866), <span class="occ">musician</span>, the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7586/', "Charles Isaac Mungo Dibdin (1768&#150;1833)")</script>, was born at Sadler's Wells, London, on 8 September 1813, and was taught music by his elder sister, Mary Anne (1799&#150;1886), afterwards Mrs Tonna, who was an excellent harpist, having studied under Neville Challoner and Nicholas Bochsa; she was also the composer of several songs and instrumental pieces. In 1824 she became assistant teacher of the harp at the Royal Academy of Music. Henry Dibdin studied the harp with her and afterwards with Bochsa. He also performed on the viola and organ. His first public appearance took place at Covent Garden Theatre on 3 August 1832, when he played the harp at Paganini's last concert. In 1833 he settled in Edinburgh, where he remained for the rest of his life. He held the honorary post of organist of Trinity Chapel, and occupied himself with private teaching and composition. In 1846 he married Isabella Perkins Palmer, who was born at Southwold, Suffolk, on 19 January 1828, and who later became a good soprano vocalist; she also composed a few hymn tunes.<br>
<br>In 1843 Dibdin published (in collaboration with J. T. Surenne) a collection of church music, a supplement to which appeared in the following year. His best-known work is the <span class="italic">Standard Psalm Book</span> (1852), which had a useful historical preface. In 1865 he compiled another collection, <span class="italic">The Praise Book</span>. His remaining published works, about forty in number, consist of songs, piano and harp pieces, and a good many hymn tunes. Dibdin was also a skilled painter and illuminator. His death took place at Edinburgh on 6 May 1866.<br>
<br>Dibdin's sons, Edward Rimbault Dibdin, born at Edinburgh on 25 August 1853, and James C. Dibdin, born at Edinburgh on 9 December 1856, both became musicians. The former composed a few songs and partsongs; the latter became best known for his <span class="italic">Annals of the Edinburgh Stage</span> (1888).<br>
