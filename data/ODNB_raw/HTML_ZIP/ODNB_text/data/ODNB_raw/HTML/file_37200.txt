<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blom,  Eric Walter</span>  (1888&#150;1959), <span class="occ">music critic and lexicographer</span>, was born on 20 August 1888 in Bern, Switzerland, the only son and eldest child of Frederick Walter Blom, bookseller and amateur singer of Danish origin, and his wife, Anna Elise Rosalie Wenger. He was educated privately and was always very reticent about his early years: he seems to have been largely self-taught in music. Blom settled in England shortly before the First World War, and after working for two music publishers&#151;Breitkopf and H&auml;rtel in Bern and J. and W. Chester in London&#151;he began to make his name in 1919 as a writer of programme notes for the Queen's Hall Promenade Concerts, being first invited to do so by Rosa Newmarch. His flair and knowledge led to his becoming London music critic of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> in 1923; an appointment to the <span class="italic">Birmingham Post</span> followed in 1931; and from 1949 onwards he worked as music critic of <span class="italic">The Observer</span>. In all three tenures Blom showed a wide range of musical sympathies and balanced judgements, and he wrote with fine style and sensitivity. Of his dozen books <span class="italic">Mozart</span> (1935) was by far the most successful. Written with insight and affection, for the <span class="roman">Master Musicians</span> series (of which he was editor), it remained in print for over fifty years. In 1923 he married Marjory Spencer (<i>d</i>. 1952), with whom he had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Blom's fluent command of languages was invaluable in his work as a lexicographer. His Everyman's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Music</span> (1946) revealed his gift for the systematic organization of a large quantity of material. Its success led at once to his appointment as editor of the fifth edition of <span class="italic">Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians</span>, a task that occupied him until 1954. The fourth edition of <span class="italic">Grove</span> appeared in 1940, comprising a revision of the five volumes of the third edition of 1927, with a sixth, supplementary, volume. But clearly by the late 1940s an entirely new approach was required, and Blom was given a free hand to bring everything as up to date as possible. Of the 8 million or more words to which the nine-volume fifth edition ultimately amounted, over half were entirely new articles or replacements of old ones, and nearly all else was revised. Though some of the original contributions by Sir George Grove were still retained, Blom was able to take account of the huge expansion of musical scholarship and history that had occurred during the preceding quarter of a century. In addition to planning and editing, he read the entire dictionary in proof, a prodigious task for one man. The result was the crown of his life's work and his lasting monument. In 1950, because of pressure of work on <span class="italic">Grove</span>, Blom gave up the important editorship of <span class="italic">Music and Letters</span>, which he had held since 1937. He resumed it in 1954 and continued as editor until his death. In this capacity his wisdom and tolerance gave much encouragement to young writers. A supplementary volume to the fifth edition of <span class="italic">Grove</span> was published in 1961, containing not only corrections but a number of important new articles.<br>
<br>Blom was a man of sterling character&#151;modest, kindly, humorous, hospitable, and friendly: he hated pretentiousness in any form. Although preferring music by the classical masters, he was by no means hostile to contemporary music, the development of which he followed with interest. In 1955 he was appointed CBE and he was awarded a DLitt by the University of Birmingham. Blom died in the Princess Beatrice Hospital, London, on 11 April 1959.<br>
