<span class="headword">Whitchurch,  Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1562), <span class="occ">printer and bookseller</span>, was a member of the Haberdashers' Company in London in the 1530s, working from the sign of the Well and Two Buckets in St Martin Outwich. In 1537 he and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11186/', "Richard Grafton")</script> became involved in Thomas Cromwell's project to produce an official English translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. In that year the so-called <span class="roman">Matthew Bible</span>, translated by John Rogers, was printed in Antwerp by Matthias Crom; Grafton and Whitchurch acted as publishers, under Cromwell's authority but at their own expense. However, the marginalia in the Matthew text continued to alarm Henry VIII, and in 1538 Cromwell ordered that a revised translation be printed, without marginal notes. Grafton and Whitchurch remained at the heart of the project, due to their experience and their comparatively deep pockets. The printing of what was to become known as the <span class="roman">Great Bible</span> was again entrusted to a skilled foreign printer, this time the Parisian Fran&ccedil;ois Regnault. However, although the project was undertaken with the permission of the French king, the University of Paris viewed it as heretical. In December 1538 the inquisitor-general seized the sheets that had already been printed; Cromwell was unwilling to intervene, despite Whitchurch's pleas, and the two publishers were forced to return to England. Edmund Bonner, the English resident in Paris who had been supervising the project, was able only to secure the transportation of the equipment, paper and workmen back to England. As a result, Grafton and Whitchurch were forced&#151;apparently contrary to their original intentions&#151;to act as the printers themselves, with some assistance from the king's printer, Thomas Berthelet. They published the first edition of the <span class="roman">Great Bible</span> in April 1539.<br>
<br>For Whitchurch this was the beginning of an illustrious career in evangelical publishing. His partnership with Grafton was to prove enduring; they printed at least six editions of the <span class="roman">Great Bible</span> in 1539&#150;41, along with various <span class="roman">New</span> testaments and English primers. In 1541 they obtained a joint patent for printing service books, which was renewed in 1543 and 1546, and they were given exclusive rights to the official king's primer of 1545. With the accession of Edward VI, they were granted a new seven-year privilege to print service books; and they were responsible for the first editions of the 1549 <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>.<br>
<br>Whitchurch's interest in biblical and liturgical publication went beyond the professional; he was a consistent advocate of evangelical reform. In July 1540 he and Grafton were seized during a general round-up of London evangelicals, accused of failing to attend confession; however, like all the others arrested in this purge, they were quickly released without charge. On 8 April 1543 they were arrested along with six other leading figures in the London book trade for printing heretical books, and imprisoned for three and a half weeks. Whitchurch's approach to such troubles appears to have been pragmatic; in 1541 he counselled the evangelical preacher Robert Wisdom to recant rather than force a confrontation with his old collaborator Bishop Bonner. His greatest contribution to the cause was, of course, as a printer and publisher. Between 1539 and 1543 he published a range of works by moderate evangelicals including Lancelot Ridley, Richard Taverner, and Richard Tracy. After his imprisonment in the latter year, his output became less controversial for the remainder of Henry VIII's reign, but he continued to produce innovative works, such as Roger Ascham's <span class="italic">Toxophilus</span> in 1545, and <span class="italic">Yny lhyvyr hwnn y traethir</span>, a primer which was the first book to be printed in Welsh, in 1546. With Edward VI's accession, he was able to produce openly evangelical material once again. He published at least ninety imprints during the six years of Edward's reign, including such key texts as Katherine Parr's <span class="italic">Lamentacion of a Sinner</span>, Erasmus's <span class="italic">Paraphrases</span>, and the metrical psalter of Sternhold and Hopkins.<br>
<br>Little is known about Whitchurch's personal life. His first marriage or marriages are unrecorded; at his death he had a son, Edward, and three adult daughters, of whom only two, Helen and Elizabeth, can be named. Likewise, the location of Whitchurch's establishment in the early 1540s is not clear. It is possible he was at the sign of the Bible in St Paul's Churchyard in 1540; in 1544 he was based at the south side of St Mary Aldermanbury Church, but he can be placed in the Old Jewry at roughly the same time. In 1545 Whitchurch moved to John Byddell's old establishment at the sign of the Sun in Fleet Street (which had formerly belonged to Wynkyn de Worde), where he remained until 1553. After Mary's accession, however, Whitchurch's position became uncomfortable once again: he was exempted by name from the coronation pardons of 1553 and 1554. It is likely that he fled to Germany. However, all that is known of his activities during these years is that, at some point after Archbishop Cranmer's execution in 1555, Whitchurch married Cranmer's German widow, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66349/', "Margaret Cranmer")</script>. The archbishop's children became part of his household; Whitchurch negotiated his stepdaughter Margaret's marriage to Thomas Norton before 1561, and was probably instrumental in having Norton appointed as counsel to the Stationers' Company in 1562. Perhaps owing to failing health, Whitchurch's own attempt to resume printing after Mary's death was perfunctory; only two imprints of his are known from this period. In 1562 he retired to a house he had leased in Camberwell. He died within a week of making his will on 25 November 1562.<br>
<br>It has been suggested that a bookseller's account book from 1545 that survives in the Houghton Library at Harvard may have been Whitchurch's.<br>
