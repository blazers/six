<span class="headword">Hofland,  Thomas Christopher</span>  (1777&#150;1843), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born on 25 December 1777 in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, the only child of a wealthy manufacturer of cotton-mill machinery. Hofland was brought up in the expectation of leading a life of leisure and his youth was spent indulging a passion for field sports, especially angling. The family moved to London in 1790 but in 1796&#150;7 his father was ruined by imprudent speculation. Hofland, already practised as an amateur painter, took lessons for a short period from the landscape painter John Rathbone. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1798, and made a living by teaching in Kew, supporting both himself and his parents. Through his position as captain in the local volunteers he attracted the attention of George III, who commissioned some botanical drawings and offered to send him as draughtsman on a naval survey, but this was declined. Hofland moved to Derby in 1805, where he was a popular teacher, then in 1808 to Leeds. There he was one of the most prolific exhibitors in what were Britain's first regular provincial exhibitions, showing sixteen works in the inaugural exhibition of the Northern Society at Leeds, 1809, twenty-four the following year from a Harrogate address, and sixteen in the third exhibition in 1811. He married the writer Barbara Hoole, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wreaks, (<i>bap</i>. 1770. <i>d</i>. 1844) at Knaresborough [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13457/', "Hofland, Barbara")</script>] on 28 January 1810.<br>
<br>In 1811 Hofland returned to London and in 1814 carried off the first prize for landscape at the British Institution with <span class="italic">A Storm off the Coast of Scarborough</span>, which was purchased by the marquess of Stafford. Other landscapes were bought by Sir George Beaumont and Lord Coventry. In 1816, according to Farington, Hofland was employed to copy works by Claude for Hart Davies, though Hofland reserved his greatest personal admiration for Wilson.<br>
<br>In 1816 Hofland was commissioned by the marquess of Blandford to make paintings of his house at Whiteknights near Reading. They were engraved by T. Medland and L. Byrne and published in <span class="italic">A descriptive account of the mansion and gardens of Whiteknights a seat of his grace the duke of Marlborough</span> with text by Mrs Hofland in 1819. Hofland was never paid for this work, his only recompense being the profits from the sale of the twenty-three engravings, a fact which still rankled nearly ten years later, after the marquess had succeeded to the title of duke of Marlborough.<br>
<br>When his most ambitious landscape, a view on the Thames at Richmond, was rejected by the Royal Academy in 1821, Hofland held his own exhibition at 106 New Bond Street (the work was probably the canvas measuring approximately 1.5 &times; 2.5 m sold at Christies on 10 December 1971, of which there is a photograph at the Paul Mellon Centre for British Art, London). The praise heaped on his work by certain sections of the press attracted accusations of favouritism and failed to help his efforts to secure election to the Royal Academy. As a candidate at the election for associates in 1822 he excited a vitriolic attack from Constable: &#145;Hofland has sold his shadow of Gaspar Poussin&#151;for 80 gns&#151;it is nothing more like Gaspar than the shadow of the man like himself on a muddy road. It is a beastly [thing]&#146;  (<span class="italic">Constable's Correspondence</span>, 101). Hofland's lack of official recognition must have been one of his reasons for taking a leading role in the creation of the Society of British Artists in 1823 and serving both as trustee and its first vice-president. From the first exhibition in 1824 until his death Hofland showed no fewer than 119 works there. Despite adverse comment on the quality of the work, the society succeeded in finding a market among the middle classes, though Hofland's own reputation was left exposed. In the following year, 1825, C. W. Westmacott made a point of supporting Hofland in his review of the Royal Academy exhibition, but suggested that the artist had not helped his own cause: &#145;[Hofland] ought long ago to have been honoured with some academical distinction; but &#147;kissing goes by favour&#148; and this artist, we hear, is not of a very compromising spirit&#146;  (Westmacott, 237). His income remained so low that he was reputedly reliant on his wife's writing of school textbooks and children's fiction.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Jerusalem at the Time of the Crucifixion</span> commissioned by Lord de Tabley in 1823&#150;4 was a rare excursion by Hofland into historic landscape, perhaps in emulation of the huge success of John Martin. Hofland could not finish it in time for the opening show of the Society of British Artists but exhibited an earlier version (first shown in 1821) in 1827. In 1829 he exhibited with the newly founded Hull and East Riding Institution for the Promotion of the Fine Arts. Otherwise, Hofland's subjects were exclusively British, with a preponderance of Lake District views and a number of country house portraits, the Whiteknights incident notwithstanding. In 1839 Hofland published <span class="italic">The British Angler's Manual</span>, a work he illustrated himself; some of the original paintings of scenes in England, Scotland, and Wales were exhibited at the Society of British Artists in 1838. Only in 1840 did Hofland make his first&#151;and only&#151;journey to the continent, with a commission from Lord Egremont for a series of views of Italy. He spent nine months in the vicinity of Rome and Naples. On his return he completed five of an anticipated series of twelve subjects but illness prevented further progress. He went in 1842 to Leamington Spa in search of medical assistance, and it was there that he died of stomach cancer on 3 January 1843.<br>
