<span class="headword">Ashbee,  Henry Spencer</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Pisanus Fraxi]</span>  (1834&#150;1900), <span class="occ">book collector and bibliographer</span>, was born on 21 April 1834 at 24 Blackfriars Road, Southwark, London, the only child of Robert Ashbee (1804&#150;1867), manager of the Curtis and Harvey gunpowder mills, and his wife, Frances Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Spencer (1810&#150;1862). He was educated at Esher and then at Kensington Proprietary Grammar School (1848&#150;50). Leaving school at sixteen, he was shortly afterwards apprenticed to Groucock, Copestakes, Moor &amp; Co., Manchester warehousemen, at 5 Bow Churchyard, London, for whom he later travelled.<br>
<br>On 27 June 1862 in Hamburg Ashbee married Elizabeth Josephine Jenny (1841&#150;1919), daughter of Edward Otto Charles Lavy, a wealthy German&#150;Jewish Hanseatic League merchant, and his English wife, Marian, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Benjamin. An independent London branch of Lavy's firm, Charles Lavy &amp; Co., at 9 Bow Lane, was founded that year, with Ashbee as senior partner. The firm exported machinery, Sheffield goods, and textiles to Europe; it moved to 7 New Basinghall Street in 1863, becoming silk mercers in Mercer Street in 1871. In 1867 Ashbee set up a branch in Paris at 38 rue des Je&ucirc;neurs. The couple lived at first in Spring Grove estate, Heston and Isleworth, then from 1865 to 1884 at 46 Upper Bedford Place, Bloomsbury. They then moved to 53 Bedford Square. They had three daughters and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30465/', "Charles Robert Ashbee (1863&#150;1942)")</script>; another son born in 1881 died at birth.<br>
<br>Ashbee travelled extensively, on business and for pleasure, and was able to create an important collection of erotica during frequent visits to Paris, Brussels, and Amsterdam (influenced in this by his early friendship with the Belgian consul in London, Joseph Octave Delepierre, thirty-two years his senior). The collection of erotica was kept in chambers three quarters of a mile from home, at 4 Gray's Inn Square (&#145;the Inn&#146;), where he could entertain his fellow collectors. These included John Camden Hotten, publisher; Jules Gay, Belgian publisher and bibliographer of erotica; Richard Burton, traveller and translator; and Richard Monckton Milnes, organizer of a select group of book collectors, the Philobiblon Society. Ashbee was much influenced by James Campbell Reddie, collector of erotica of every sort, &#145;more extensive than choice&#146;  (H. S. Ashbee, <span class="italic">Catena librorum tacendorum</span>, 1885, <span class="smallcap">XLVIII</span>) and Frederick Hankey, living in Paris, whose much smaller, finer collection included &#145;exceptional copies of the most esteemed erotic works&#146;  (ibid., <span class="smallcap">L</span>). Robert Samuel Turner, a collector of more general interests, also had much influence on Ashbee, who regularly joined him at his Saturday morning gatherings of bibliophiles in his chambers in Albany.<br>
<br>In 1877 Ashbee published the first of his three bibliographies of erotica, privately published in editions limited to 250 copies, <span class="italic">Index librorum prohibitorum</span>, followed by <span class="italic">Centuria librorum absconditorum</span> (1879) and <span class="italic">Catena librorum tacendorum</span> (1885). He used a scatological anagram of the Latin words for ash and bee, <i>fraxinus apis</i>, as his <i>nom de plume</i>: Pisanus Fraxi. The volumes were elaborately produced: the bibliographical descriptions were detailed, with long extracts appended, and there was a plethora of notes; the indexes were closely constructed and fully analytical of their subject.<br>
<br>Ashbee might also have been the author, who called himself <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74203/', "Walter")</script>, of <span class="italic">My Secret Life</span>, published in eleven volumes between about 1888 and 1894 in an edition said to have been no more than six copies (but perhaps as many as twenty-five). Recounting the writer's erotic affairs in over 4000 octavo pages, its authorship, and whether it is in fact fictional or genuinely autobiographical, remains unsettled. Ian Gibson considers it to be by Ashbee, though a fictional account; Gershon Legman also thought it by Ashbee, but autobiographical; other authorities have disagreed. The text has an air of truth rather than fiction; its diction, and the detailed form of its index, are arguably in Ashbee's style. The misprints in the original, which Ashbee would never have tolerated, argue against his authorship, as does the fact that the two surviving prospectuses date from the late 1890s, when he was still alive, and would presumably have objected to the sale of the volumes.<br>
<br>Apart from erotica, Ashbee's collection of Cervantes, particularly illustrated editions of <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span>, was the largest in private hands apart from one in Barcelona. He presented his <span class="italic">An Iconography of Don Quixote 1605&#150;1895</span> (1895) to the Bibliographical Society for issue to its members at a quarter of its actual cost. He also had a large collection of early editions of Moli&egrave;re and Le Sage. Among his extra illustrated books may be noted Nichols's <span class="italic">Literary Reminiscences</span>, extended from nine to thirty-four volumes. He possessed a considerable number of books illustrated by Daniel Chodowiecki, the German Cruikshank. He was also collecting books written in French by English authors, and was preparing a bibliography of these at the time of his death.<br>
<br>Travelling was another major enthusiasm. In his early years he spent much time on the continent. In 1881&#150;2 he spent nine months travelling round the world, returning via San Francisco and New York, disliking America intensely; he kept a detailed diary, but never wrote the book about the journey that he had intended. He went on three occasions to Tunisia with Alexander Graham, and with him wrote <span class="italic">Travels in Tunisia</span> (1887), a factual travel book; its bibliography, with an added second part, was issued separately in 1889.<br>
<br>Apart from these major works, there were a great many smaller pamphlets and articles, including over a hundred contributions to <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>, about seventy relating to general bibliographical matters, Cervantes in particular, the remainder, signed <i>Apis</i> or <i>Fraxinus</i>, concerned with matters erotic.<br>
<br>On the day of his silver wedding anniversary in 1887 Ashbee quarrelled violently with his wife, and she left him in 1891, taking their daughters Agnes and Elsa with her. Frances, the eldest daughter, had recently married, and Charles had previously moved away. The cause of the quarrel has never been established. It may have been because of his wife's discovery of the collection of erotica, or she may perhaps have learned that a second establishment existed, said to have been maintained by her husband with Ellen Mary Jane Montauban, by whom he may have had a daughter, Irene (a relationship evidenced only by the Montaubans' partial replacement of the family in Ashbee's will, supported by persistent though unsubstantiated family rumour).<br>
<br>Ashbee was for ever teeming with energy, writing truthfully in his diary for 31 December 1887: &#145;No entry for over 5 months. And yet those five months have been as pregnant as my time generally is.&#146; He was successful in business, in collecting books and pictures, at bibliography, and in his travel worldwide&#151;achievements marred only by the failure of his marriage. His rooms in Gray's Inn, the branch of the firm in Paris, and his extensive travels all gave ample scope for liaisons elsewhere, but apart from the question of the Montaubans no evidence remains. He was deeply upset by the strain of homosexuality in his son. He had a genial temperament, with many friends among fellow collectors. He spoke several languages; was proud to be English, and of the empire, thought little of those outside Europe apart from the Japanese. By religion a lapsed protestant, he had a particular disregard for the Church of Rome and its priests.<br>
<br>Ashbee was much respected in the city and was renter warden of the Curriers' Company in 1895&#150;6, upper warden in 1896&#150;7, and master in 1897&#150;8. He was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (1877), the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Amis des Livres, Paris (1879), and the Royal Geographical Society (1881); he was a founder member of Les Bibliophiles Contemporains (1889) and of the Bibliographical Society, London (1892) (and was on its council until his death). He was also corresponding member of the Royal Academy of Madrid (1896).<br>
<br>In 1895 or 1896 Ashbee moved to Fowler's Park, Hawkhurst, 4 miles south of Cranbrook in Kent, where he was looked after by his first cousin Louisa Maud Ashbee, then aged fifteen. He died there on 29 July 1900 of congestion of the lungs, heart trouble, liver and kidney complaints, and finally dropsy. He was cremated at Woking crematorium on 1 August 1900, and his ashes were placed in the family tomb at Kensal Green the next day. His estate was valued at just over &pound;63,000.<br>
<br>Ashbee's wife and children were disinherited in favour of the children of his eldest daughter Frances, but then only following the deaths of his business partner Arthur Peterson, his cousin Louisa Maud Ashbee, and Edward Montauban, who were to receive the income from the residuary estate (40 per cent, 40 per cent, and 20 per cent respectively). Ashbee's share in the firm was also left to Peterson. Irene Montauban and his cousins Louisa Ashbee and Edith Blaxland were each left &pound;1000. Ashbee's two livery companies, the Curriers and the Armourers and Brasiers, each received &pound;5000.<br>
<br>The books were left to the British Museum. Of a total of 8764 works, in 15,299 volumes, about 1600 volumes were of an erotic or obscene nature. Of these last the museum was allowed to destroy duplicates, but in fact destroyed others which it deemed to be &#145;of offensive matter which is of no value or interest&#146;  (preliminary report to the BM trustees), six boxes in all, almost certainly including Ashbee's &#145;numerous exemplars &hellip; of poorly produced, illustrated pornographic fiction (particularly in English) of the nineteenth century&#146;  (Mendes, 466). The remainder were taken into the museum's private case, to which were added about 200 other erotic volumes from the collection that were bought by the museum about 1900. In the rest of the collection there were about 750 works by Cervantes, in 1715 volumes, as well as many French seventeenth- and eighteenth-century titles that the museum did not possess. The Victoria and Albert Museum acquired 204 pictures, mostly watercolours, many illustrating <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span>.<br>
