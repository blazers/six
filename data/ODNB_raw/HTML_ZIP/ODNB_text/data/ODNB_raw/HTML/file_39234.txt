<span class="headword">Erik of Hlathir</span> <span class="st"> [Eir&iacute;kr af Hla&eth;ir, Eir&iacute;kr H&aacute;konarson]</span>, earl of Northumbria  (<em>fl. </em>995&#150;1023), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of H&aacute;kon Sigurdson, earl (<i>jarl</i>) of Hlathir, or Lade (now part of Trondheim), in Norway. He married Gytha, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26830/', "Swein Forkbeard, king of the Danes")</script>, and was thus a brother-in-law of King Cnut.<br>
<br>After the death of Harald Gr&aacute;feld 
    (Harald Greycloak; <i>c</i>.970)
   the earls of Hlathir were the most powerful chieftains in Norway. Their court was a centre for the production of skaldic verse; Erik, poorly documented in England, was a famed warrior in northern Europe. In the Scandinavian power struggles of the late tenth century H&aacute;kon and his sons, Erik and Swein, often allied with the Danes. By the 990s these struggles involved the prestige and profit of raids on England. In 995 the successful adventurer, &Oacute;l&aacute;f Tryggvason, backed by the English king, &AElig;thelred, returned from England to take the Norwegian throne. H&aacute;kon was killed and Erik and his brother went into exile, Erik taking refuge with Swein of Denmark. Now if not before he raided widely around the Baltic, until in 999 he joined the Swedish&#150;Danish alliance that defeated and removed &Oacute;l&aacute;f at the battle of Svold. He and his brother then ruled western Norway, acknowledging some Danish lordship. This military and political background made him an obvious companion to his brother-in-law Cnut in the conquest of England in 1015&#150;16. English and Scandinavian sources agree on his significance in the important siege and fighting around London in these years. His involvement in the famous battle at Ringmere in 1010 is found in Scandinavian sources alone and is debatable.<br>
<br>Erik was one of Cnut's most important followers in England after 1016. After the murder of Uhtred of Bamburgh, earl of Northumbria, he was made earl &#145;as Uhtred was&#146; according to the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>, although Durham sources record Eadulf's succeeding his brother Uhtred. Northumbria was often divided along the Tees in the later tenth century, though Erik may have had overall lordship with Eadulf holding of him. Erik was frequently at court from 1018 to 1023, and is alleged to have been instrumental in the death of Eadric Streona, ealdorman of Mercia, in 1017. He may have been Cnut's trusted companion, but he did not become the most important earl until Thorkell's outlawry in 1021. Erik had lost power in Norway to &Oacute;l&aacute;f Haraldsson during the English campaign, whereas Thorkell remained an independent force. Raids on England had meshed with and been driven by Scandinavian politics. The sparse sources contain no hint of the likely cross-currents and tensions among men like Erik, Thorkell, and Cnut in these years. Erik disappeared in 1023, by which date he must have been forty, if not considerably older. William of Malmesbury has him driven back to Scandinavia into exile. Cnut's subsequent favour to his son H&aacute;kon argues against his father's disgrace; H&aacute;kon was an earl in the west midlands and Cnut's regent in Norway between 1028 and 1030, and may have been married to Cnut's niece. But the king's favour could equally have been an attempt to limit the repercussions of Erik's fall. Scandinavian sources contain no hint of Erik's exile; they place his death in England, due to loss of blood after an operation.<br>
