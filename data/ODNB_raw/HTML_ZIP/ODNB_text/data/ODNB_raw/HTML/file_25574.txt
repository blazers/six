<span class="headword">Simon,  Abraham</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1617, <em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1692), <span class="occ">medallist</span>, was baptized on 27 April 1617 at the French protestant church in Threadneedle Street, London. He was the third son of Peter (or Pierre) Simon, a merchant, and his wife, Anne (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1588), the daughter and heir of Gilles Germain, a merchant of St Peter Port, Guernsey, and the brother of the medallist and seal engraver <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25577/', "Thomas Simon (bap. 1618, d. 1665)")</script>; his other siblings were Peter (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1612&times;14), Hannah, William (<i>bap</i>. 1616), Samuel (<i>bap</i>. 1619), Nathaniel, and Laurence. Abraham matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, on 8 May 1635, and was created MA in 1646. He studied law for seven years, being admitted a student of Gray's Inn in 1640 and again in 1642.<br>
<br>By 1645 Simon was making medals and wax models of leading parliamentarians and others, working both independently and in collaboration with his brother Thomas. Abraham's medals, a number of which bear his signature, &#145;AS&#146;, were cast and chased. Signed examples include those of John Campbell, first earl of Loudoun (1645), William Pope (1645), the ambassador Albert Joachim (1646), Sir Sydenham Poyntz (1646), John Maitland, second earl of Lauderdale (1646), and Charles Seton, second earl of Dunfermline (1646).<br>
<br>Simon's movements after the late 1640s are unclear. He may possibly have visited the Netherlands, before or after travelling to Sweden. John Evelyn met him in London in June 1653, and in 1654 Simon was also in England as he produced a medal of Henry Cromwell. However, that same year he was in Sweden, where he made the coronation medal for Queen Hedvig (unsigned), for which he was paid the sum of 800 dalar in October 1654. Unusually for Simon, the medal die was engraved rather than cast using a wax model. Vertue claimed that Simon travelled with Queen Kristina on a visit to Louis XIII of France, and that the queen was in love with him. In fact Kristina visited the court of Louis XIV in 1656 (following her abdication in 1654), and as the Swedish royal household did not pay Simon that year it is probable that he accompanied Kristina. Vertue records that during this visit Simon was nearly arrested when taking a wax portrait of the king from the gallery of the royal chapel on account of his peculiar appearance. He was &#145;a man of small stature; of a primitive philosophic aspect, always wearing his hair and beard, according to the mode of his ancestors&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Medals, Coins, Great Seals</span>, 58). Court accounts record that Simon was in the service of Karl X Gustav and Hedvig between 1655 and 1660, although no medals from this period are known. He probably left Sweden for good in 1658, and possibly settled in the Netherlands for a few years. It is unclear whether it was during this or an earlier visit that he was in the company of the diplomat Sir William Temple.<br>
<br>After the Restoration, Simon returned to England, where he found favour at court. He modelled the portrait of Charles II at the price of 100 broad-pieces. The duke of York afterwards had his portrait done, but proposed to pay him only 50 broad-pieces: Simon then took up the wax model, and in the duke's presence deliberately defaced it. This act lost him favour at court, and other sitters often complained of his impatience when they offered any criticism of his work. Vertue records that his unconventional appearance, &#145;constantly wearing boots and spurs, with his long sword <i>en cavalier</i>, made him everywhere remarkable&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Medals, Coins, Great Seals</span>, 58). He was also in considerable demand as a model because &#145;His hirsute picturesque was of a kind, exploited by Van Dyck in his studies of apostles's heads, that remained very popular throughout the seventeenth century&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 1.124). Indeed, he was painted three times by Sir Godfrey Kneller, once as a hermit. Sir Peter Lely also painted Simon's portrait.<br>
<br>In later life Simon seems to have encountered difficulty attracting patronage, and he died in obscurity about 1692. He left two daughters, Anne and Judith.<br>
