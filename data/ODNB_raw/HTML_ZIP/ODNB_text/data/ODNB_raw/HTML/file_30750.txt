<span class="headword">Adams <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Campin]</span>,  Mary Grace Agnes</span>  (1898&#150;1984), <span class="occ">television producer and programme director</span>, was born on 10 March 1898 at Well House Farm, Hermitage, Berkshire, the elder of two daughters (her sister died aged three) and second of four children of Edward Bloxham Campin, farmer, of Hermitage, and his wife, Catherine Elizabeth Mary (<i>d</i>. 1938), daughter of Edwin Gunter, farmer, of Alveston. Mary's mother brought up the three surviving children in Penarth, Wales, under conditions of great hardship; Mary's father died of consumption in 1910. A scholarship to Godolphin School, Salisbury, led to University College, Cardiff, where Mary Adams gained first-class honours in botany (1921). She then became a research scholar and Bathurst student at Newnham College, Cambridge (1921&#150;5), and published papers on cytology.<br>
<br>Mary Adams held tutorial and lectureship posts at Cambridge for extramural and board of civil service studies (1925&#150;30). In 1928 she broadcast a series (published as <span class="italic">Six Talks on Heredity</span>, 1929), which proved a transition point. Gripped by the educational possibilities of the BBC, she joined its staff in 1930 as adult education officer. Her inspiring flair for teaching, especially the young, and organizational skills had a new outlet. She stayed in sound broadcasting until 1936: under the exactitudes of Sir John Reith, director-general of the BBC, she combined information with informality in obligatorily scripted programmes. She was appointed to the newly established television service in 1936, becoming the first woman television producer. An atmosphere of history-in-the-making, experimentation, and excitement prevailed, though the budget was minuscule. The headquarters was at Alexandra Palace, north London, and Mary Adams was in charge of education, political material, talks, and culture. She persuaded the eminent&#151;for example, C. E. M. Joad, S. Gordon Russell, Julian Huxley, and John Betjeman&#151;to appear on this alarming new medium, but with the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 the service was shut down.<br>
<br>From 1939 to 1941 Mary Adams was director of home intelligence in the Ministry of Information and the years 1942&#150;5 were spent working in North American service broadcasting, where she produced morale-boosting programmes&#151;for example, <span class="italic">Transatlantic Quiz</span>. Returning to BBC TV in 1946, she was ever breaking new ground, bubbling with ideas, enlisting the services of the distinguished in arts and science for programmes, and cutting red tape. She was head of television talks (1948&#150;54) and assistant to the controller of television programmes (1954&#150;8). She stimulated others to achieve, and could spot and harness enthusiasm and talent. For example, in the early 1950s, the young zoology graduate David Attenborough (who at this stage had never seen television) realized, after a revelatory five-minute conversation with Mary Adams, the potential force of television for the future, joined the staff at Alexandra Palace, and went on to create and produce numerous ground-breaking wildlife series. Mary Adams herself promoted and produced many programmes (always with a purpose): cooking; gardening; art; intellectual quizzes, for example <span class="italic">Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?</span> (1952&#150;9, 1971); material for children, such as <span class="italic">Muffin the Mule</span> (1946&#150;55) and <span class="italic">Andy Pandy</span> (1950&#150;69, 1970&#150;76); science, for example <span class="italic">Eye on Research</span> (1957&#150;61); and world celebrations, such as <span class="italic">The Restless Sphere</span> with the duke of Edinburgh in International Geophysical Year (1957). The first to make medicine accessible to the public, she shook the medical profession out of its secretive complacency with such series as <span class="italic">A Matter of Life and Death</span> (1949&#150;51, 1952), <span class="italic">Matters of Medicine</span> (1952&#150;3, 1960), <span class="italic">The Hurt Mind</span> (1957), and <span class="italic">Your Life in their Hands</span> (1958&#150;64). There were many repeats and revivals of her programmes. Her productive years from 1942 to 1958 could not have been so successful without her working relationship and friendship with Nora Wood, who skilfully manipulated an often chaotic environment to combine cheerful progress with a singular and telling output.<br>
<br>When Mary Adams retired in 1958 she began a new career. The Consumers' Association, which had been established in 1957, resulted from her deliberations with Julian Huxley in 1937. She was its deputy chairman from 1958 to 1970, and induced a nervous <span class="italic">Which?</span> magazine to produce the first comparative tests of contraceptives and a reluctant BBC to produce the first consumer programmes giving brand ratings. Simultaneously, she advised the BBC (and was, contrastingly, a member of the Independent Television Authority, from 1965 to 1970), wrote for <span class="italic">Punch</span>, and played far-sighted roles in organizations concerned with Anglo-Chinese understanding, the unmarried mother and her child, British railway design, British Medical Association planning, mental health, women's groups, telephone users, and eugenics.<br>
<br>With science, as with the arts, she made people sit up, with ideas that were daring, in support of what was new, often with a strong feminist slant, and expressed with animation, even provocation. Spurning notes for public speaking, she arrived well informed, sensed the atmosphere, then, in a style that teased and delighted, injected serious and original proposals. She was a creative persuader at work, yet paradoxically indecisive at home. She was appointed OBE (1953), an associate of Newnham College, Cambridge (1956&#150;69), and a fellow of University College, Cardiff (1983).<br>
<br>Mary Adams married on 23 February 1925 (Samuel) Vyvyan (Trerice) Adams (1900&#150;1951), the younger son of Samuel Trerice Adams, canon of Ely and rural dean of Cambridge. Her husband was Conservative MP for West Leeds (1931&#150;45), an early determined anti-Nazi, and a radical reformer. He was adopted for the Conservative seat of Darwen in 1951, and earmarked for cabinet rank by Winston Churchill, but his untimely drowning on 13 August of that year denied this political resurgence. One daughter, Sally, was born of the marriage in 1936.<br>
<br>In appearance Mary Adams was small, birdlike, always well dressed, with bright blue eyes and, in public, a knowing confidence. Her character, though full of contradictions, was magnetic. She was a socialist, a romantic communist, and could charm with her charisma, spontaneity, and quick informed intelligence. She was a fervent atheist and advocate of humanism and common sense, accepting her stance without subjecting it to analysis. These qualities ensured she was the centre of attention in a social setting, and she involved herself with all the right people. Yet a streak within compelled her to dread, then court, loneliness and it decreed that her marriage was to be less than happy: she could not live in harmony with herself, nor be truly supportive to those close to her who needed help. She had an unexpected, dry put-down humour. A stroke in 1980 affected her memory; when flummoxed and cornered by a social worker's banal and routine questions, she wriggled out of it with, &#145;If you want the details, you can always look me up in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span>&#146;. She died in University College Hospital, London, on 15 May 1984, and was cremated at Highgate crematorium, London.<br>
