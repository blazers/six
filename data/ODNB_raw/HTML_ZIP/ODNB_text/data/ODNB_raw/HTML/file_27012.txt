<span class="headword">Tayler,  (John) Frederick</span>  (1806&#150;1889), <span class="occ">watercolour painter and etcher</span>, was born on 30 April 1806 at Borehamwood in Hertfordshire, one of seventeen children of Archdale Wilson Tayler, a country landowner until forced to go into the army, having been ruined by his agent; he died when Tayler was still a child. A younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27015/', "William Tayler")</script>, became commissioner of Patna in India, and an uncle, Charles Henry Hall, was dean of Christ Church, Oxford. Intended by his family for the church Tayler was educated at both Eton College and Harrow School. He determined to become an artist, however, and attended Henry Sass's school in Bloomsbury and the Royal Academy Schools. In Paris the animal paintings of Theodore G&eacute;ricault inspired Tayler to take lessons from the equestrian artist Horace Vernet, and he bought parts of horses from butchers in order to study their anatomy. He also shared a studio with Richard Parkes Bonington, who must have encouraged his preference for watercolour; he sketched on the French coast with John Skinner Prout, and he visited Rome.<br>
<br>In 1830 Tayler exhibited an oil painting, <span class="italic">The Band of the 2nd Regiment of Life Guards</span>, at the Royal Academy. In 1831 he was elected an associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours, and became a full member three years later. In all he exhibited 500 pictures with the society, including twelve drawn with George Barret. Queen Victoria, who first saw Tayler's work in 1834, became an important patron and purchased work for Windsor Castle. Thereafter aristocratic taste and Tayler's considerable social connections enabled him to sell his work for high prices; <span class="italic">Return from Hawking</span>, for instance, was purchased for &pound;465 3<i>s</i>. in 1864. He signed himself F. Tayler. Tayler's work can be divided into three groups: sporting scenes, often in costume and with horses; pastoral scenes, mostly Scottish; and historical illustrations, frequently inspired by the <span class="roman">Waverley</span> novels. Henry Walker, in <span class="italic">Our Living Painters</span> (1859), commented:<blockquote>His paintings have great dash, and evince power of a sketchy kind, albeit they are somewhat washy and blotty in execution, and, at a day when care and finish are becoming almost universal, are works not wholly up to our time. (244&#150;5)</blockquote>Tayler was a member of the Etching Club and made prints throughout his career, from <span class="italic">Frederick Tayler's Portfolio</span>, a series of lithotints published in 1844 and 1845, to <span class="italic">Studies in Animal Painting</span>, in 1884.<br>
<br>On the death of Copley Fielding, in 1855, Tayler became for eight months acting president of the Society of Painters in Water Colours. During that year a dispute at the Paris Universal Exhibition over the hanging of drawings, particularly those of John Frederick Lewis, made Tayler seriously ill from stress; yet when Lewis resigned as president, in February 1858, Tayler was unanimously elected to replace him. He remained in office until 1870 but was not considered very effective: &#145;Amiable and generous in his nature, he was not one who loved to thrust himself into the forefront as an advocate&#146;  (Roget, 2.215). A less generous critic, William Evans &#145;of Eton&#146;, said that Tayler's &#145;lukewarmness&#146; was positively harmful  (Royal Watercolour Society MSS, J30/18). Art brought Tayler other worldly honours. He received the L&eacute;gion d'honneur of France, and other awards from Belgium, Bavaria, and Austria; he was also elected a member of the Pennsylvanian and the Royal Cambrian academies, and of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Aquerellistes of Belgium.<br>
<br>A photograph of about 1863 portrays Tayler as a rather prim figure; he has a high forehead, side whiskers, a long nose, small, deep-set eyes, and hair which curls at the ears. In 1837 he married Jane Parratt, with whom he had three surviving sons and two daughters. Tayler lived in London for most of his life; the catalogues give various addresses around London, and two for periods, in 1838 and in 1887, when he lived in Brighton. Late in his life he lost heavily through unfortunate investments. Frederick Tayler died at his home, 63 Gascony Avenue, West Hampstead, on 20 June 1889 and was buried in Hampstead cemetery. His remaining works were sold by Christies on 27 January and 17 February 1890. He was a prolific artist; the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum, and many other galleries have drawings by Tayler, but his work has never recovered its once great popularity. A daughter, Kate Tayler (<i>fl</i>. 1870&#150;1908), exhibited with the Society of Women Artists and with the Dudley Gallery. Norman Tayler (1843&#150;1915), Tayler's second son, was elected an associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1878; his watercolours were primarily of genre scenes.<br>
