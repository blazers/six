<span class="headword">Cranston,  Maurice William</span>  (1920&#150;1993), <span class="occ">political philosopher</span>, was born on 8 May 1920 at 53 Harringay Road, Tottenham, Middlesex, the only child of William Cranston, theatrical agent, and his wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harris (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1933). Although the family was of Scottish origin, Cranston himself was raised in Tunbridge Wells by two maiden aunts and a Quaker godmother, following the death of his mother when he was a boy and the emigration of his father to Canada &#145;to seek, unsuccessfully, his fortune&#146; in the 1930s  (Cranston, 254&#150;5). He attended a succession of schools, including the Tunbridge Wells Technical Institute and School of Art and a Jesuit college in France. Besides preparing himself to become a journalist he acquired a facility with languages, especially French, which he used to advantage throughout his life. He had planned to attend King's College, London, in 1939, but was unable to do so as the Second World War intervened.<br>
<br>During the war Cranston was a conscientious objector and served throughout with the London civil defence in firefighting and rescuing casualties of the bombing. He also worked with refugees at Bloomsbury House and recalled that one of those he assisted presented him with a copy of Spinoza's <span class="italic">Tractatus theologico-politicus</span>, which was influential in encouraging him to turn away from a career in journalism to study political philosophy. After the blitz he began taking evening courses in philosophy in the University of London, taught by the Spinoza specialist Ruth Saw. He also contributed to <span class="italic">Peace News</span> and, while advocating non-violent resistance to the Nazis, he was well aware of the difficulties of this policy. In a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Non-Violence and Germany</span>, published in 1944, he wrote:<blockquote>Any encouragement the pacifist may draw from the narratives in the following pages [concerned with non-violent resistance to the Nazis and especially with the Copenhagen Strike of June 1944] must be tempered by the reflection that these incidents are but tiny glimpses of light in a swiftly darkening scene: violence, discredited by everyone twenty years ago, has come to be accepted by everyone, venerated almost by countless numbers. The memory of Mr. Chamberlain should be sufficient warning against too eager plucking of flowers out of nettles. (p. 3)</blockquote>During this period Cranston attempted to break into publishing and journalism. He shared his ambitions with the writer and painter Denton Welch, whom he met in Tunbridge Wells in 1938, and they remained close friends. On 20 July 1940 he married Helga May (<i>b</i>. 1920/21), film editor, and daughter of Siegfried May, bookkeeper, but the marriage did not survive the war. Cranston's life at this time might be seen reflected in the characters of his two amusing and stylish detective novels published in 1946: <span class="italic">Tomorrow We'll be Sober</span> and <span class="italic">Philosopher's Hemlock</span>. He also published in 1949 a travel book, <span class="italic">Introduction to Switzerland</span>. When, after the war, he attended St Catherine's College, Oxford (graduating with a second-class degree in philosophy, politics, and economics in 1948), he maintained his interest in writing and publishing, and joined Ludovic Kennedy in founding the Oxford University Writers' Club, where established authors such as Evelyn Waugh, Cyril Connolly, V. S. Pritchett, and John Betjeman were invited to dine with student members and respond to their questions.<br>
<br>Cranston arrived in Oxford with a head full of Spinoza and seventeenth-century rationalism which he found difficult to integrate with the linguistic philosophy which had become fashionable at the time. His BLitt thesis (published in 1953 as <span class="italic">Freedom: a New Analysis</span>) attempted to use linguistic analysis without denying the reality and importance of traditional ethical, political, and metaphysical questions concerned with freedom, freedom of the will, and liberalism. Cranston was also unusual in reading contemporary continental philosophers, such as Sartre, Merlau-Ponty, Jean Wahl, and Jean Hippolyte, who contributed to his understanding of liberty. He wrote a number of works on Sartre (including <span class="italic">Sartre</span>, 1962, and <span class="italic">The Quintessence of Sartrism</span>, 1970), and on other aspects of contemporary French thought.<br>
<br>During the 1950s Cranston combined a part-time lectureship in social philosophy in the University of London with an active life in journalism and publishing. By the mid-fifties he was involved in the Congress for Cultural Freedom and began to publish in <span class="italic">Encounter</span>, whose editorial board he eventually joined. In 1959 he became literary adviser to the publisher Methuen. He was also active in PEN, the association of poets, essayists, and novelists, and became a permanent delegate to PEN International. He spoke and wrote eloquently for the rights of writers who were oppressed and in prison. His book on human rights, <span class="italic">Human Rights Today</span>, first appeared in 1955 and was followed by a revised edition in 1962 and by <span class="italic">What are Human Rights?</span> in 1973. He defended human rights at a time when in Britain and elsewhere the doctrine was rejected by many who wrote in the Marxist, utilitarian, and common law traditions. He adapted the Lockean doctrine of natural rights to human rights and presented strong arguments against the extension of rights to life, a fair trial, liberty, property, and so on to include social and economic rights, as had occurred in the UN declaration of universal rights of 1948. The rights Cranston defended were those which any government could secure, and did not depend on levels of economic and social development which such rights as the right to holidays with pay required. He was thus critical of governments that denied human rights, and justified this denial on the grounds of economic backwardness. He also saw a tension between an emphasis on economic progress (especially in the communist bloc) and a willingness to subordinate liberty to collective economic achievement. In this process he found the writer and intellectual especially vulnerable to oppression by governments of all kinds. In addressing a PEN congress in Dublin in 1971, he said:<blockquote>The conclusion seems to be that <i>all</i> modern systems of economy are disadvantageous from the writer's point of view &hellip; I feel myself that the capitalist system is perhaps the least [disadvantageous] &hellip; But I do not think we writers can have real enthusiasm for any system of economic relationships, or any form of patronage of which we have so far had experience. (<span class="italic">The Changing Face of Literature</span>, 32)</blockquote>His approach to rights and the status of writers and others oppressed by governments reflected a strong belief in individual liberty and in a minimal state. He perhaps reasserted in a different context the earlier opposition to war and to the treatment by governments of refugees from Nazi oppression.In 1957 Cranston published <span class="italic">John Locke: a Biography</span>, which was widely praised for its scholarship and style, and was awarded the James Tait Black memorial prize. This major work followed eight years of research on Locke's papers, which had been recently acquired by the Bodleian Library. Michael Oakeshott was among the admirers of the book, and Cranston was invited in 1959 to join the government department at the London School of Economics (LSE), where he eventually succeeded Oakeshott as professor of political science in 1969. His first marriage having ended in divorce, in 1958 he married Baroness Maximiliana (Iliana) von und zu Fraunberg (<i>b</i>. 1925). This marriage was highly successful, and two sons, Nicholas and Stephen, were born in 1960 and 1962.<br>
<br>As a university don Cranston was an imaginative and engaging lecturer, and he continued his lectures on French political thought even after his retirement. But his main interest was in supervising his PhD students, for many of whom he was not only a teacher but a good friend. His support and personal warmth were cherished by those fortunate enough to have been his students. Nevertheless, Cranston was not a typical political scientist. He seldom published in the learned journals, partly because he eschewed the pedantry he found there, and partly because he found that many political scientists were little more than apologists for political parties or ideologies, dressing up their theories as philosophy or science. In his inaugural lecture of 1971, published in 1972 and entitled <span class="italic">Politics and Ethics</span>, he saw the role of the political philosopher as one that resembled a drama critic in the theatre of politics, and he especially attacked the philosopher who abandoned this perspective and became a politician:<blockquote>He may grow fretful in the stalls and yearn to mount the stage himself, but just as critics are notoriously bad actors, so philosophers make wretched politicians. Think of Gentile becoming Mussolini's minister of education, or Heidegger joining the Nazi party, or Lukacs going to Moscow to support Stalin. Or perhaps we had better not think of them. (p. 24)</blockquote>Cranston was also critical of a &#145;positivist&#146; or &#145;behaviourist&#146; political science displacing more traditional political philosophy. Without political philosophy, he said:<blockquote>politics might well go on as merrily as ever. But the trouble is that it would not be understood, it would be a practice without consciousness of the norms which inform its activity, ignorant even of its own identity or nature. If the day ever comes when political philosophy is dead, the triumph of information over knowledge will be complete. (p. 24)</blockquote>Cranston's academic career flourished in Britain, continental Europe, and the United States. Besides his steady progress up the academic ladder, he was widely regarded as one of the few academics who could reach a general audience beyond the universities. For example, he wrote a series of eight highly imaginative political dialogues between various historical figures, from Savonarola and Machiavelli on the state to Voltaire and Hume on morality, which were originally broadcast on the BBC Third Programme, frequently repeated, and subsequently published in 1968. He often contributed to the BBC World Service and Radio Free Europe and made numerous other broadcasts in Britain, France, Canada, and Italy. In Britain he was made a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and an honorary fellow of St Catherine's College, Oxford (1984) and of the LSE (1991). He delivered the Carlyle lectures at Oxford in 1984 on the main figures of the French Enlightenment, subsequently published as <span class="italic">Philosophers and Pamphleteers: Political Theorists of the French Enlightenment</span> (1986). He often visited North America, where he was a visiting professor at Harvard University (1965&#150;6), Dartmouth College (1970&#150;71), the University of British Columbia (1973&#150;4), and the University of California at La Jolla (1986&#150;93), and a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, DC (1982). He also visited France and wrote and broadcast in French. He visited the &Eacute;cole des Hautes &Eacute;tudes in Paris in 1977, and served as president of the Institut International de Philosophie Politique (1976&#150;9). He was vice-president of L'Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise en Angleterre from 1964. In addition he was seconded as professor of political science to the European University Institute in Florence (1978&#150;81).<br>
<br>Cranston maintained his interest in the French Enlightenment in numerous essays, and made highly praised translations of Rousseau's <span class="italic">Social Contract</span> (1968) and <span class="italic">A Discourse on the Origins of Inequality</span> (1984), published as Penguin paperbacks and widely used throughout the world. In the 1970s he began research on a three-volume biography of Rousseau, utilizing the new edition of Rousseau's correspondence and much new scholarship, attempting to create a &#145;Lockean&#146; biography&#151;one in which attention to detail, meticulously presented, would reveal the character and significance of this much misunderstood figure. The first volume, <span class="italic">Jean-Jacques: the Early Life and Work of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, 1712&#150;1754</span>, appeared in 1983, followed by <span class="italic">The Noble Savage: Jean-Jacques Rousseau, 1754&#150;1762</span> in 1991. To the suggestion, originally made by the philosopher Richard Peters, that Cranston's interest in Rousseau followed from a similar past, he made clear that temperamentally, philosophically, and politically, he was much closer to Locke than to Rousseau. The final volume, <span class="italic">The Solitary Self: Jean-Jacques Rousseau in Exile and Adversity</span> (1997), was incomplete at the time of his death and was published posthumously with additions from his other writings on Rousseau, carefully edited and linked together by an American colleague, Sanford Lakoff.<br>
<br>Cranston was a prolific writer who rose early and worked through the morning; then, following advice once given to him by Bertrand Russell, he took a siesta after lunch and returned to work in the late afternoon. Even when convenor of the government department at LSE, he maintained his regimen and would perform his administrative duties before most of his colleagues had stirred from their beds. He would then leave the school for a day's writing, often before they had arrived. Although he claimed to write slowly and with difficulty, his elegant style, displaying great wit and charm, made his writing appear effortless.<br>
<br>Among academics Cranston was rare in being able to increase his income substantially through writing and broadcasting, but as the years passed he found this increasingly difficult. Television took its toll on the general reader, and, despite high acclaim from many reviewers, the financial return he sought from the biography of Rousseau did not meet his expectations. Radio no longer reached the same audiences as it did in the 1950s and 1960s, and Cranston seldom appeared on television. Furthermore, he was not inclined to become a political pundit. He belonged to no political party, and while he was often associated with anti-communist and libertarian conservatism, he was alert to the limitations of all political ideologies. To associate himself with Locke's political ideas, he occasionally referred to himself as a whig, and insisted that he was more at home in the seventeenth and eighteenth than in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. He was not only cosmopolitan but also a devoted citizen of the republic of letters who defended oppressed writers throughout the world.<br>
<br>In appearance, Cranston was of medium height, slim and handsome. His shy exterior, once penetrated, revealed a man of great wit and warmth, much admired and loved by his friends to whom he was devoted, and with few enemies. Despite his frequent travels, he was most at home in London: in the libraries, in his flat in Kent Terrace overlooking Regent's Park, the LSE, the BBC, the publishing houses, and the Garrick Club. He died suddenly from a heart attack on 5 November 1993 following a broadcast in London for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on Margaret Thatcher's memoirs. He was survived by his wife and two sons. A memorial service was held at St George's, Bloomsbury, London, on 2 February 1994.<br>
<br>Cranston's academic legacy rests mainly on his biographies of Locke and Rousseau, his writings on liberty and human rights, and his translations of Rousseau. His postgraduate students went on to hold academic posts throughout the world, and often worked in fields Cranston originally made his own. But his writings for a wider audience had a special charm and appeal, and reflected the link between serious philosophical thought and the intelligent lay person which characterized post-war Britain as a civilized and liberal society in spite of economic decline and a diminution of its role in the world.<br>
