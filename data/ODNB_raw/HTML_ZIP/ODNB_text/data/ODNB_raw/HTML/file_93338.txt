<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Trace,  Christopher Leonard</span>  (1933&#150;1992), <span class="occ">television and radio presenter</span>, was born on 21 March 1933 at Cranleigh, Surrey, the son of Laurence Archibald Trace, a dental surgeon, and his wife, Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Morley. He was educated at Cranleigh School, Surrey, and joined the army in 1951 and trained at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. After seven years in the forces he began an acting career and took small parts in British B crime thrillers such as <span class="italic">Wrong Number</span> and <span class="italic">Urge to Kill</span>. His most notable movie part was as Charlton Heston's stand-in in <span class="italic">Ben Hur</span> (1959). A year earlier, while working on <span class="italic">The Hound of the Baskervilles</span>, he met Margaret Elizabeth Cattrall (<i>b</i>. 1935/6), daughter of Frederick Nelson Cattrall; they were married at St Jude's Church, Kensington, London, on 3 May 1958 and had a son, Jonathan (<i>b</i>. 1959) and a daughter, Jessica.<br>
<br>Trace's acting career was sidetracked when he successfully auditioned for a new BBC children's programme, <span class="italic">Blue Peter</span>, a stablemate to the established magazine series <span class="italic">Studio &#145;E&#146;</span>, aimed at a younger audience. <span class="italic">Blue Peter</span> was devised by John Hunter Blair, a model railway enthusiast with a layout in his BBC office. Models and handcrafts were intended as a major part of the programme's early format and Trace, a keen model maker and fellow railway enthusiast, won through to become its first presenter. Duties were shared with Leila Williams, whose first BBC contract listed her as &#145;assistant comp&egrave;re to Christopher Trace&#146;, indicating that it was he who was the show's anchor. <span class="italic">Blue Peter</span> was first broadcast on 16 October 1958. As was customary for all BBC announcers and presenters, Trace wore a suit and tie on screen; the effect was a sober but avuncular figure with just a hint of matin&eacute;e idol. Williams later described their presenting style as an older brother and sister pairing. The programme performed steadily if not spectacularly. After Williams's departure Trace was left as the sole presenter between January and April 1962. At this time he drew heavily on his craft skills and continued to build all the onscreen models himself in the BBC's special effects department&#151;there being no background assistant to provide the programme's &#145;makes&#146; until 1963. He also undertook freelance modelwork for the department, including a giant railway layout for a Michael Bentine show. Two of <span class="italic">Blue Peter</span>'s best-known catchphrases&#151;&#145;And now for something completely different&#146; (later taken up by <span class="italic">Monty Python's Flying Circus</span>) and &#145;Here's one I made earlier&#146;&#151;are attributed to Trace.<br>
<br>Between May and September 1962 Trace presented <span class="italic">Blue Peter</span> with Anita West. But the programme reached new heights with the arrival of Valerie Singleton as his co-presenter, and Biddy Baxter as producer, in October and November of that year. Baxter introduced many of the programme's classic elements, including its first pet, the dog Petra. Trace helped train the animal for the programme. A brief mention that Trace and Singleton were to take part in the 1964 London to Brighton vintage car rally drew thousands to the event and was clear evidence of their celebrity  (Baxter and Barnes, 53). <span class="italic">Blue Peter</span>'s popularity led to an increasing amount of location work but this, plus the programme's twice-weekly schedule from October 1964, placed strains on Trace. A day's filming at Camber Sands in May 1965, swimming in freezing weather, was too much and he snapped: &#145;You get someone else to share this bloody agony or I'm leaving for good&#146;  (ibid., 74). This led to a search for a third presenter. Another field trip in 1965, <span class="italic">Blue Peter</span>'s first summer expedition to Norway, was marred by Trace's romantic liaison with a young Norwegian woman. The event was kept quiet at the time, but proved detrimental to his career. His son Jonathan recalled, &#145;Not only did it sour the relationship with my mother [who soon filed for divorce] but it also didn't help his reputation within the BBC and he felt it was time to move on&#146; (interview for <span class="italic">Blue Peter Confidential</span>).<br>
<br>Trace's departure was also prompted by the arrival in January 1966 of a third presenter, John Noakes. Noakes was an instant success and, despite Trace's army career, quickly assumed the role of &#145;action man&#146;. While Trace had long since adopted more informal dress, he now appeared somewhat austere and old-fashioned when set against his down-to-earth and fun-loving colleague. Baxter recalled that the situation made Trace &#145;morose and difficult to deal with&#146;, not least because it was &#145;very easy for the man who is being paid to give the impression to the public that this is his show, to actually believe it&#146;  (Baxter and Barnes, 81). However, Noakes's arrival also exposed the changing styles of children's television performance from a correct and disciplined approach, as practised by Trace, to the more relaxed, and often more popular, manner of younger presenters.<br>
<br>Trace made his final appearance on <span class="italic">Blue Peter</span> in July 1967 and announced that he was moving to Spain to write a book (this never transpired). Edward Barnes, Baxter's deputy, later recalled that Trace's decision did not leave them &#145;desperately broken-hearted&#151;he knew he'd had enough&#146;  (<span class="italic">Blue Peter Confidential</span>). This, however, is to underplay Trace's immense contribution to the programme's formative years. Huw Wheldon, then BBC controller of programmes, for example, believed that &#145;There will be no <span class="italic">Blue Peter</span> without Christopher Trace!&#146; He returned to make a special appearance on <span class="italic">Blue Peter</span>'s twentieth anniversary programme (1978) when live on air he produced an engraved metal boss that became the <span class="italic">Blue Peter</span> award for outstanding endeavour, awarded annually until 1990. Reflecting on the programme in 1980 he claimed that &#145;Occasionally I think it's slipping slightly but I suppose I look at it rather like an indulgent parent&#146;  (<span class="italic">Where Are They Now?</span>).<br>
<br>On leaving <span class="italic">Blue Peter</span>, Trace joined a new film company, Spectator, in which he invested heavily but which was wound up in 1973. Trace filed for bankruptcy, having lost &pound;16,000. In the mid-1970s he returned to television, and worked as a presenter of the news magazine <span class="italic">Look East</span> for BBC Norwich and the early morning radio programme <span class="italic">Roundabout East Anglia</span>. Decrying the 4.30 a.m. starts and &#145;the ruination of one's social life&#146;, he left broadcasting several years later. He subsequently worked for a light engineering firm in Hemel Hempstead and was, by the early 1990s, studying for a law degree in London. In 1991 he was incapacitated by a back injury which he blamed on damage caused while working for <span class="italic">Blue Peter</span>. Forced to claim sickness and housing benefit, he rented a room in a fellow student's flat in Walthamstow. Trace died of throat cancer on 5 September 1992 at the Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel, London. On his death Biddy Baxter paid tribute to Trace as one of early television's brightest stars; in particular she acknowledged his efforts in 1962 when he presented the programme alone and so ensured its survival into a later golden period  (Baxter, <span class="italic">The Times</span>).<br>
