<span class="headword">Dawson,  Nancy</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Ann Newton]</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1728, <em>d.</em> 1767), <span class="occ">dancer</span>, was probably the Ann baptized at Axminster, Devon, on 17 January 1728, the daughter of William Newton. In her will she named her parents as William Newton, a staymaker, of Martlett Court, Covent Garden, and Eleanor Newton, but they may well have followed their daughter to London when she became successful. It seems likely that this is the truth, rather than the colourful, if rather seedy, account given in the anonymous <span class="italic">Authentic Memoirs of the Celebrated Miss Nancy D*ws*n</span> (n.d. [1765?]). It seems she joined the company of a puppet-showman, Griffin, who taught her to dance, and a figure dancer from Sadler's Wells gained an engagement for her at that theatre. Here, &#145;as she was extremely agreeable in her figure, and the novelty of her dancing added to it, with her excellent execution, she soon grew to be a favourite with the town&#146;  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 2nd ser., 10, 1860, 195). In her second summer season at Sadler's Wells she was promoted to the part of Columbine. She made her first appearance at Covent Garden on 1 February 1758 as a dancer in Thomas Betterton's dramatic opera <span class="italic">The Prophetess</span>. It was probably about this time that she became the mistress of the Covent Garden comedian Ned Shuter (1728?&#150;1776); in 1763 George Alexander Stevens published &#145;a satire upon Edward Shuter, the comedian, and Nancy Dawson, the far-famed toast&#146;, <span class="italic">The Dramatic History of Master Edward, Miss Ann, Mr Llwhuddwhydd, and Others</span>, which was reprinted several times, but copies of which are very scarce.<br>
<br>On 22 May 1758 Nancy Dawson was billed to dance a hornpipe, but her greatest opportunity came in October 1759, when the man who was to dance the hornpipe among the thieves in <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> was taken ill. In the manner of Hollywood fantasy, Nancy Dawson was plucked from the chorus to take his place, and from that moment her professional reputation was made. The hornpipe by which she danced into fame was performed to a tune which had various lyrics associated with it, but which was always known as &#145;The Ballad of Nancy Dawson&#146; (there is no evidence that any words were sung while she danced). The music seems to have been composed by Thomas Arne, and was one of the most popular airs of the day. It was set with variations for the harpsichord as &#145;Miss Dawson's Hornpipe&#146;, and was used in Carey and Bickerstaffe's musical pastiche <span class="italic">Love in a Village</span> (1762); it was also mentioned by Goldsmith in the epilogue to his <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span>. The tune continues to be well known as that to which the nursery rhyme &#145;Here we go round the mulberry bush&#146; is sung. Dawson's performance (as well as Charlotte Brent's celebrated Polly) contributed to the success of <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>, which had an unusually long run, drawing audiences away from Garrick's Drury Lane.<br>
<br>Despite being given her first speaking part (the princess in Shuter's <span class="italic">The English Sailors in America</span>, 20 March 1760), Dawson was wooed away to Drury Lane by the offer of a higher salary. She danced her hornpipe there, again in <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>, on 23 September 1760. She remained there for three years, appearing regularly in revivals of <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> and in Christmas entertainments, including <span class="italic">Harlequin's Invasion</span> (1761&#150;2 season) and <span class="italic">Fortunatus</span> (1761&#150;2 and 1762&#150;3 seasons). In the summer of 1761 she joined Shuter and Joseph Grimaldi the elder in Lee's company at Winchester. On 26 December 1763 she appeared in a Drury Lane pantomime, <span class="italic">The Rites of Hecate</span>, and she performed again the following night, but that was the last time she danced on stage. It is not known why she retired, or what she did between then and her death. The Axminster antiquary James Davidson, when preparing his unfinished history of Axminster between 1820 and 1830, learned from his conversations with elderly residents that Dawson made regular visits to Axminster during and after her stage career, where &#145;she astonished the inhabitants as well by the splendour of her appearances as the boldness of her carriage&#146;  (Chapman, 136). Dawson died on 9 June 1767 at Haverstock Hill, Hampstead, Middlesex. She was buried on 12 June in the graveyard of St George the Martyr (later St George's Gardens), Bloomsbury, behind the Foundling Hospital. In her will she made provision for her parents, for her brother and nephew, both named William Newton, and for a niece, Elizabeth Newton, who had been bound to Dawson as an apprentice, suggesting that she might have been involved in some kind of mercantile activity in her last years.<br>
<br>Reputedly &#145;of shrewish temper&#146; and &#145;immoral life&#146;, Nancy Dawson was included in Edward Thompson's <span class="italic">The Meretriciad</span> (1761) as one of the most notorious women in London. The size and prominence of her tombstone have prompted speculation about liaisons in her later years; rumours that the stone originally bore a scurrilous eight-line ditty, beginning &#145;Nancy Dawson was a whore&#146;, are unfounded.<br>
