<span class="headword">Herbert,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1606&#150;1662), <span class="occ">translator and author of religious tracts</span>, was born at &#145;Margis in Flanders&#146;, the son of Andrew Herbert the younger  (Parl. Arch., naturalization of William Herbert, 1620/21). His great-grandfather James Herbert had settled in Calais where his son Andrew the elder became an alderman and justice of the peace. With the fall of Calais in 1558, the family fled to Flanders, where his father was later executed for his protestant beliefs when William was still young. Herbert returned to England and about 1606 joined the Dutch congregation in London, being listed with the merchant members in 1617. However, in 1640 he was employed as tutor to the two sons of Montague Bertie, second earl of Lindsey.<br>
<br>On 27 April 1635, Herbert married Frances Sedgwicke, at Poyntington, Somerset, where they lived; they had three children, John (buried 1637), Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1639), and Benjamin (<i>b</i>. 1645). His religious writings were initially intended for his family and underlined his Reformed beliefs: <span class="italic">Herberts Beleefe and Confession of Faith made &hellip; for the Instruction of his Wife and Children</span> (1646); <span class="italic">Herberts Careful Father and Pious Child</span> (1648) to instruct his daughter in the catechism; and for his wife a devotional work for women in childbirth, <span class="italic">Herberts Child-Bearing Woman</span>, which was published after her death. He seems to have returned to London a couple of years after his wife's death in March 1645. He maintained his links with the exile churches, dedicating <span class="italic">Herberts Quadripartit Devotion</span> (1648) to the pastors, elders, and deacons of the French and Dutch churches, presenting a copy to the Dutch church for which he received 20<i>s</i>. He attacked the rival French church at Westminster in his <span class="italic">Response aux Questions de Mr. Despagne</span> (1657) and defended the exile communities in his <span class="italic">Considerations in the Behalf of Foreiners</span> (1662).<br>
<br>Herbert translated religious manuals; <span class="italic">La malette de David</span> by Daniel Featley was published in Geneva in 1650. He also published French language works such as the fourth edition, &#145;exactly corrected, much amplifi'd and better ordered&#146;, of Paul Cogneau's <span class="italic">A Sure Guide to the French Tongue</span> in 1658 and in 1660 <span class="italic">Herberts French and English Dialogues</span>. His publishing was delayed by illness in 1660; the last reference to him is the dedication in <span class="italic">Considerations in the Behalf of Foreiners</span> dated 18 June 1662 at the Charterhouse, London.<br>
