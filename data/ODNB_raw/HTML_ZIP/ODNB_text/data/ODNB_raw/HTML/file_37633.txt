<span class="headword">Keyes,  Sidney Arthur Kilworth</span>  (1922&#150;1943), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 27 May 1922 at The Homestead, West Hill, Dartford, Kent, the only child of Captain Reginald Keyes of the Queen's Own Royal West Kent regiment, a flour miller by trade, and his second wife, Edith Mary (<i>d</i>. 1922), daughter of the Revd Arthur Blackburn, rector of St Paul's, Bradford. Because his mother died from peritonitis when he was only six weeks old, Keyes was brought up in Dartford by his paternal grandparents, and his grandfather, Sidney Kilworth Keyes, a wealthy farmer, dominated his childhood. On the death of his grandfather in 1938 Keyes was inspired to write his first serious poem, &#145;Elegy&#146;. Keyes's childhood was lonely and isolated. Because he was frail it was thought unwise to allow him to mix with other children, and in consequence he became an avid reader. At the age of nine he was eventually sent to a preparatory school in Dartford. When he was eleven he attended Dartford grammar school, and three years later he went to Tonbridge School, where his main interests centred on literature and the natural world. By the time he left Tonbridge in July 1940 Keyes had written more than seventy poems, discovered in a manuscript book shortly after the war; many are inevitably juvenilia, but &#145;Nefertiti&#146;, written when he was seventeen, marks an advance towards maturity, and his poem &#145;The Buzzard&#146;, the last to be written at Tonbridge, is probably his most accomplished schoolboy work.<br>
<br>Keyes entered Queen's College, Oxford, in October 1940, on a history scholarship. His poetry from this period displays an &#145;astonishing fluency&#146;  (Press, 273); one of his early Oxford poems, &#145;Remember your Lovers&#146;, was written in an examination hall, after he had finished one of his papers early. (He later came to dislike the poem for its &#145;lush sensuality&#146;  (ibid., 273)). It was during his Oxford years that he embarked on a fruitful friendship with the future winner of the queen's gold medal for poetry, John Heath-Stubbs. Heath-Stubbs, whose own childhood had been marred by insensitivity to his progressive blindness, instinctively responded to the darker images of Keyes's own imagination. He understood very well Keyes's desire to investigate through poetry the subjects of pain and death, and his feeling of being in far closer communion with William Blake, William Wordsworth, and Johann Schiller than with any living contemporaries. Keyes was also influenced by artists such as El Greco, and by masters of the macabre, such as Goya, Beddoes, and Rouault. In particular, Keyes had come to identify with the Romantic movement, and it was Heath-Stubbs who was able to broaden Keyes's base by tracing for him the origins of Romanticism in primitive legends through the medieval to the Augustan poets. It was Heath-Stubbs, too, who helped Keyes to perfect his poetic technique, which had tended to trail behind the complexity and variety of his ideas.<br>
<br>Keyes became editor of <span class="italic">Cherwell</span>, the Oxford student newspaper. In 1941, with Michael Meyer, he edited <span class="italic">Eight Oxford Poets</span>. He was awarded a first class in part one of the history examination (1941). He had been writing on average a poem a week, and by the end of 1941 he had enough poems to form a first volume, <span class="italic">The Iron Laurel</span>, but he withheld publication until 1942 in order to include &#145;The Foreign Gate&#146;, a long poem in which, for the first time in his work, Death appears as a real presence. Keyes joined the army in April 1942, and was sent to the officer cadet training unit at Dunbar. During his time there, he composed some of his finest poetry, including the two linked poems, &#145;Dido's Lament for Aeneas&#146; and &#145;Rome Remember&#146;. It was also at this time that he wrote &#145;North Sea&#146;, a heartfelt epitaph on his unreciprocated love for Milein Cosman, a refugee from D&uuml;sseldorf, who had come to Oxford when the Slade School moved there from London. In September 1942 Keyes was commissioned as a second lieutenant in his father's old regiment. He sailed for Algiers in March 1943 and during the last days of the Tunisian campaign he saw a mere fortnight's active service. He was killed near Sidi Abdullah, north Africa, on 29 April 1943, and was buried in the military cemetery at Massicault. The military historian James Lucas, who served in Tunisia as Keyes's runner, remembered him as &#145;a gallant Christian gentleman who sacrificed himself for the men under his command&#146;. He was twenty when he died.<br>
<br>A second, posthumous, collection of Sidney Keyes's poems, <span class="italic">The Cruel Solstice</span>, was published in 1943 and won the Hawthornden prize. His collected poems were edited in 1945 by Michael Meyer, who has recalled that, although Sidney Keyes was inclined to be taciturn in a large gathering or among strangers, to his friends he was witty and delightful company. Notwithstanding Keyes's extreme youth, his output was prodigious and far-ranging, and, with Keith Douglas and Alun Lewis, he must be regarded as one of the outstanding poets of the Second World War, so much of his work having been inspired, before his brief sortie into battle, by an internal preparation for death.<br>
