<span class="headword">Carmichael,  Gershom</span>  (1672&#150;1729), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, was born in London, the son of Alexander Carmichael (<i>d</i>. 1677), a Scottish presbyterian clergyman who had been deprived of his church in Scotland (at Pittenain) &#145;for keeping of conventicles&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 3.464, 22 Feb 1672). Alexander Carmichael was transported to England where he was the first minister of the Founders' Hall congregation of Scottish presbyterians in London. He was the author of <span class="italic">Believers mortification of sin by the spirit or gospel&#151;holiness advanced by the power of the Holy Ghost</span> (1677). Gershom Carmichael's mother, Christian (<i>d</i>. 1694/5), was the daughter of John Inglis, minister of Hamilton. She subsequently married the noted Scottish theologian James Fraser of Brae.<br>
<br>Gershom Carmichael enrolled at the University of Edinburgh in 1687 and graduated MA in 1691. He was appointed regent of humanity at St Andrews in March 1693 and resigned in October of the same year to obtain an MA from Glasgow, where he was appointed regent in 1694. On 19 September 1695 he married Christian Ingles; they had six sons. Carmichael remained regent or professor of philosophy at Glasgow until the termination of the regenting system in 1727. He was then elected the first professor of moral philosophy at the University of Glasgow.<br>
<br>As a regent Carmichael was responsible for teaching all parts of the philosophy curriculum: logic, metaphysics, moral philosophy, and natural philosophy. His publications derive from the lectures or dictates given to his students: a short introduction to logic, <span class="italic">Breviuscula introductio ad logicam</span> (1720, 1722), which was designed as a commentary on the Port Royal logic or <span class="italic">The Art of Thinking</span>; a succinct exposition of Reformed theology, <span class="italic">Synopsis theologiae naturalis</span> (1729), written to supplement and in part replace the texts he assigned students in metaphysics, the ontology and pneumatology of the Dutch metaphysician, Gerard de Vries; and his most important publication, an extended commentary on Samuel Pufendorf's work on the duty of man and citizen, <span class="italic">S[amuelis] Pufendorfii de officio hominis et civis juxta legem naturalem, libri duo. Supplementis et observationibus in academicae juventutis usum auxit et illustravit Gerschomus Carmichael</span> (1724; first edn, 1718). Carmichael's edition of Pufendorf's work was highly regarded by jurists and moral philosophers in Europe: Jean Barbeyrac, professor of law in Groningen, acknowledged his debt to Carmichael in many passages of his translations and commentaries on the writings of Grotius, Pufendorf, and Cumberland; Everard Otto, professor of law in Utrecht, described Carmichael as a man worthy of esteem by all students of natural jurisprudence. In Scotland, Francis Hutcheson, Carmichael's successor as professor of moral philosophy in Glasgow, judged his commentary on Pufendorf's work to be &#145;of much more value than the text&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Short Introduction to Moral Philosophy</span>, 1747, i).<br>
<br>Carmichael's moral philosophy was remarkable particularly for its emphasis upon the natural rights of mankind. He argued (against Samuel Pufendorf, but in agreement with Hugo Grotius and John Locke) that every individual has a right of self-defence. He insisted (again, against Pufendorf and more unequivocally than Locke) that no man has the right to enslave another, &#145;for men are not among the objects which God has allowed the human race to enjoy dominion over&#146;. He defended the theory of all the early modern natural jurists, that civil or political societies have their beginnings in an original contract, a theory which appealed to post-revolutionary Scottish thinkers, inasmuch as it excluded any claim to political power on the grounds of hereditary right. He believed that the liberty of the Scottish people had been secured by the limitations insisted on in the treaty of union and by the accession of the house of Hanover.<br>
<br>Carmichael justified the natural rights of men and citizens on grounds consistent with his natural theology in which all men long for beatitude or a lasting happiness that can be found only in reverence for or veneration of God. Such reverence may be expressed directly (but also indirectly) in respect for God's creation and, more specifically, in self-respect and respect for others. And he held that there was no more appropriate way of signifying respect for persons than to acknowledge that every individual enjoys certain natural rights. His theory of moral motivation, while consistent with Reformed scholastic theology, presented problems for his successors&#151;Francis Hutcheson, Adam Smith, and Thomas Reid, among others. In their disagreements with Carmichael and with one another they generated those fruitful speculations concerning the moral experience of men in society that have come to be called the Scottish Enlightenment.<br>
<br>Carmichael's career at the University of Glasgow was characterized by intermittent controversy. Robert Wodrow, who had been his student in the 1690s and who remained his friend, described him as &#145;a little warm in his temper, but a most affectionate, friendly man&#146;  (Wodrow, 4.95&#150;6). Carmichael was inclined to be impatient with colleagues who continued to teach in accordance with the principles of scholastic Aristotelianism: &#145;foolish Gershom spues out much venom against me&#146;, his fellow regent, John Tran, complained to the principal, John Stirling  (letter, 27 March 1704, Glasgow University Library Gen MS 205, 67). He opposed the autocratic style of the principal on different occasions. He was suspended from teaching in 1704, for protesting against the principal's administration of the finances of the university. The suspension was rescinded following interventions on his behalf by the duchess of Hamilton, the duke of Montrose, and others. In 1717 Carmichael and other masters objected to the annual renewal of the rector by the principal and faculty without vote by the students as the statutes of the university required  (&#145;Memorial for the scholars and other matriculated members of the University of Glasgow&#146;, 21 Dec 1717, NL Scot., Pamph. 1.10, 142). Their initiative failed, although the right of the students to elect the rector was confirmed by a commission of visitation in 1727. It was the termination of the regenting system by the same commission that led to the establishment of the chair in moral philosophy which Carmichael held for only two years before his death, in his house in the college of Glasgow, on 26 November 1729.<br>
<br>Of Carmichael's sons, Alexander graduated MA in 1716 and was licensed university printer in 1730; James enrolled in the university in 1712 and was later appointed to administer his father's estate; and John graduated MA in 1718 and was King William's bursar in theology. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4700/', "Frederick Carmichael")</script> taught the humanity class at the university (1726&#150;8) during the illness of Professor Andrew Ross; he was then a candidate for his father's chair in moral philosophy but was defeated in a very close vote by Francis Hutcheson. Gershom, MA in 1733, was librarian at the university in 1737&#150;9 and was subsequently minister at Monomail and South Church, Dundee; he also studied at the University of Leiden. Patrick, an army surgeon in the Dutch service before returning to Scotland, is described by Dugald Stewart as &#145;a younger son of Professor Gershom Carmichael &hellip; who, after a long residence in Holland, where he practised medicine, retired to Glasgow&#146;; he married the daughter of Thomas Reid.<br>
<br>Gershom Carmichael died intestate. A &#145;testament dative&#146; was &#145;faithfully made and drawn up by James Carmichael, son lawfull and Exec. dative qua nearest in kin decerned to the defunct by decret of the Commissar(y) of Glasgow&#146;  (NA Scot., CC 9/7/53, 2 June 1730). The testament dative records sums of money owing to the estate by the university; the total of these sums of money is reckoned &pound;54 8<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. The commissary of Glasgow later recorded the amount of &pound;444 8<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>. made out in favour of Elizabeth Stewart, relict of John Inglis (his wife's mother) in her lifetime and to Professor Gershom Carmichael. The bond is dated 14 February 1727. Again James Carmichael is &#145;decerned&#146; to be executor dative and Alexander Carmichael signs as caution or surety for his brother James.<br>
