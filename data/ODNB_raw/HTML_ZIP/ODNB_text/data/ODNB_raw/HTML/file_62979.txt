<span class="headword">Holford, Sir  George Lindsay</span>  (1860&#150;1926), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was born on 2 June 1860 at Dorchester House, Park Lane, London, the fourth child and only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37559/', "Robert Stayner Holford (1808&#150;1892)")</script>, MP and art and plant collector, of Westonbirt, Tetbury, Gloucestershire, and Dorchester House, London, and Mary Anne Lindsay (<i>d</i>. 1901), daughter of Lieutenant-General Sir James Lindsay. George Holford's maternal uncles were Sir Coutts Lindsay, bt (1824&#150;1913), owner of the Grosvenor Gallery, London, Robert James Loyd-Lindsay, Baron Wantage, and (by marriage) Alexander Lindsay, twenty-fifth earl of Crawford. His father was reputedly the richest commoner in England.<br>
<br>After Eton College Holford was commissioned into the Life Guards. Despite a generous allowance from his father he ran up considerable debts and in 1883 had to be helped out by his future brother-in-law, the merchant banker <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48999/', "Robert Henry Benson")</script>. His other sisters married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33568/', "Albert Grey, fourth Earl Grey")</script>, and Albert Parker, third earl of Morley. In 1888 he became equerry to the duke of Clarence, whom he accompanied on an official visit to India in 1889&#150;90; for this he was appointed CIE. He was successively equerry to the prince of Wales, later Edward VII, an extra equerry to George V, and equerry-in-waiting to Queen Alexandra. He became colonel of the Life Guards' 1st battalion in 1908 and commanded its reserve battalion during the First World War. He was knighted in 1910.<br>
<br>Robert Holford died in 1892 and George Holford then came into an inheritance that included the fabled Holford picture collection, Westonbirt, Dorchester House, and over 16,000 acres. The collection remained vast, even though he sold the etchings and engravings, including a celebrated group of Rembrandt etchings, on 11&#150;14 July 1893 at Christie, Manson, and Woods for &pound;28,119. Further disposals included a painting by Meindert Hobbema to J. P. Morgan, privately; a portrait by Vel&aacute;zquez of the duke of Olivares, which passed through Duveen Bros. to the great American collector Arabella Yarrington, Mrs Collis P. Huntington; and a first folio Shakespeare to the New York dealer Dr Rosenbach. Holford's main interest, however, was in developing his father's arboretum at Westonbirt and in cultivating orchids. To this end he employed H. G. Alexander as his specialist grower. One result was <i>Cymbidium alexanderi</i> &#145;Westonbirt&#146;, which by 1993 had produced 381 first-generation hybrids, each of which had been used many times for second- and third-generation hybrids.<br>
<br>Holford's great-niece once asked his sister what Uncle George did and was told that he &#145;was at court and attended the king and he is the best backgammon player in London&#146;  (private information). It was discovered after his death that the drawers of his writing table at Dorchester House were crammed with IOUs. He had never tried to cash them as he had no need; nor, it was widely reported in his family, had he ever opened a business letter. He was amiable, generous, and even humble: it is as such a character that he made a fictional appearance in Dennis Wheatley's thriller <span class="italic">The Second Seal</span>.<br>
<br>On 17 December 1912 Holford married Susannah West Menzies, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wilson (<i>d</i>. 1943), with whom he was reputed to have been in love for twenty years. He first met her at Tranby Croft, her father's home, during the weekend when Sir William Gordon Cummings was accused of cheating at cards in the presence of the future Edward VII. She was the widow of Jack Graham Menzies (<i>d</i>. 1911). Holford died, childless, on 11 September 1926 at Westonbirt. He left his orchids to Alexander. The rest of his wealth passed to his nephews and nieces, including his executor, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30716/', "Sir Reginald Benson")</script>, and the estates were sold. Dorchester House was razed and the Dorchester Hotel built on the site while Westonbirt became a girls' school; the arboretum passed ultimately to the Forestry Commission.<br>
<br>The Greek vase, furniture, tapestries, Chinese porcelain, and objects of art at Westonbirt were sold there over five days in October 1927. The fabled picture collection was sold in two major sales; Christie, Manson, and Wood conducted all three auctions. The first picture sale, of Italian masters, took place on 15 July 1927 and realized nearly &pound;156,000. The Dutch and Flemish pictures, together with a small number from the English school, were sold on 17&#150;18 May 1928, and included Albert Cuyp's <span class="italic">Dordrecht at the Maas</span> (sold for 20,000 guineas), Rembrandt's <span class="italic">Portrait of a Man Holding the Torah</span> and <span class="italic">Portrait of the Young Man with a Cleft Chin</span> (48,000 and 44,000 guineas respectively), <span class="italic">The Elevation of the Cross</span> (5200 guineas) by Rubens, and Richard Wilson's <span class="italic">The River Dee</span> (4100 guineas). The first day's sale of seventy-eight paintings realized &pound;364,094, a world record for a single day's sale of pictures by auction; a total of &pound;416,197 was raised over the two days.<br>
