<span class="headword">Ollier,  Edmund</span>  (1826&#150;1886), <span class="occ">journalist and historian</span>, was born on 26 November 1826 in Maida Hill, Paddington, Middlesex, the sixth of the six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20739/', "Charles Ollier (1788&#150;1859)")</script>, publisher, writer, and editor, and his wife, Maria Gattie (1786&#150;1878). He was uncertain of his genealogy, remarking in his memoir on his father that the name Ollier &#145;seems to betoken a French origin &hellip; possibly &hellip; of Huguenot descent&#146; and that his own ancestors were &#145;connected for some generations with the north-west and west of England&#146;, his father having been born in Bath  ([Ollier], &#145;Literary publisher&#146;, 243&#150;4). Because his father had been a publisher (1817&#150;23) of works by Shelley, Keats, Hazlitt, Lamb, and Leigh Hunt, Edmund Ollier had an affection for these romantic writers and in the memoir he wrote for the edition of Lamb's <span class="italic">Essays of Elia</span> that he published in 1867 he remarked that he had &#145;beheld [Charles Lamb] with infantine eyes&#146; and &#145;sat in the lap of poor Mary Lamb&#146;  (Ollier, &#145;Memoir&#146;, <span class="italic">Essays</span>, vi). As a boy, he also met many of the authors associated with the publishers Henry Colburn and Richard Bentley (for both of whom his father was chief literary adviser from 1825 to 1840), and he listened to the stories of B. R. Haydon and Leigh Hunt. Ollier, a good friend of Hunt until the latter's death in 1859, later joined with others to raise funds for a monument to Hunt in Kensal Green cemetery in London, and in 1869 he edited and wrote a memoir for Hunt's <span class="italic">A Tale for a Chimney Corner</span> (1849). His many other correspondents included Richard Henry Horne (Hengist) and Charles and Mary Cowden Clarke.<br>
<br>Ollier published numerous poems, stories, and articles in such periodicals as <span class="italic">Ainsworth's Magazine</span> (1844&#150;6), <span class="italic">Household Words</span> (1853&#150;7), and <span class="italic">All the Year Round</span> (1860&#150;70), also publishing occasionally in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, <span class="italic">Magazine of Art</span>, <span class="italic">Mirror of Literature</span>, <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, and <span class="italic">The Sun</span>. He was sub-editor of <span class="italic">The Leader</span> (1855&#150;8), editor of <span class="italic">The Atlas</span> (1859&#150;60), and literary editor of the <span class="italic">London Review</span> (1864&#150;6). He was an occasional writer in the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> from 1853 to 1877. He republished his earlier verses in <span class="italic">Poems from the Greek Mythology, and Miscellaneous Poems</span> (1867).<br>
<br>Ollier made his literary d&eacute;but in <span class="italic">Ainsworth's Magazine</span> in 1844 and was very active in the periodical press until 1877. He was the most prolific historian working for Cassell, Petter, and Galpin, the publishers with whom he began his association by writing a biographical and critical study of Gustave Dor&eacute; in 1870 and a highly successful <span class="italic">Cassell's History of the War between France and Germany</span>, in two volumes, issued in weekly and monthly parts in 1871&#150;2 (reserialized in 1873&#150;4 and again in 1883&#150;4). His other works include <span class="italic">Our British Portrait Painters</span> (1873), volume 9 (1874) of <span class="italic">Cassell's Illustrated History of England</span>, <span class="italic">Cassell's History of the United States</span> (3 vols., 1874&#150;7), and <span class="italic">Cassell's Illustrated History of the Russo-Turkish War</span> (2 vols., 1878&#150;9). His writing of <span class="italic">Cassell's Illustrated Universal History</span> (4 vols., 1881&#150;5) meant that he had to decline Leslie Stephen's invitation of 9 December 1882 to become a sub-editor for the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. His last project was <span class="italic">The Life and Times of Queen Victoria</span>, for which he wrote the first eleven chapters before illness caused him to resign his commission. The work was completed by Robert Wilson in 1887.<br>
<br>With the exception of a few holiday jaunts, Ollier passed all of his life in London. He did not marry until later in life. On 2 October 1875 he wed Emily Jane Dorrell (1833&#150;1917); they had no children. Although baptized and married in the Anglican church, Ollier (like his father) was &#145;neither in religion nor in politics &hellip; a Conservative&#146;. He &#145;never strove for party position, for honours or distinctions&#146;, but in 1867 he received from King Victor Emmanuel &#145;the cross of the order of Saint Maurice and Saint Lazarus, in recognition of his literary advocacy of the cause of Italian independence&#146;  (Oswald, 309&#150;10). Ollier died on 19 April 1886 at his residence, 154 Oakley Street, Chelsea, London. He was buried on 22 April in Brompton cemetery in the same grave as his father, mother, and brother Francis (1820&#150;1872)&#151;a grave in which were later interred his unmarried sister Clara Elizabeth (1818&#150;1898) and, in 1917, his widow.<br>
