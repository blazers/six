<span class="headword">Combe,  Simon Harvey</span>  (1903&#150;1965), <span class="occ">brewer</span>, was born at Frensham, Surrey, on 4 May 1903, the second son of Major Boyce Combe of Great Holt, near Farnham, Surrey, and his wife, Katherine Mabel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tombs. Educated at Eton College, he spent a year in France before joining the family brewery, Watney Combe Reid &amp; Co., in 1922. During the Second World War he served as a captain in the Irish Guards, winning the Military Cross at Anzio in 1943.<br>
<br>Combe was an archetypal representative of British &#145;family capitalism&#146;. He stayed with Watneys all his working life, being appointed an &#145;annual&#146; director in 1926 and a full director in 1931. In 1950 he succeeded Major Arthur Bonsor as chairman, a position he retained until his death. Combe's years at the top were crucial ones for both the company and the industry. The early 1950s saw the acquisition of Charles Hammerton &amp; Co. of Stockwell (1951), Tamplin's of Brighton (1953), and Henty and Constable of Chichester (1955). In 1955 Watneys came close to effecting an ambitious merger with Bass before merging with Mann Crossman and Paulin three years later to form Watney Mann. The move was designed to give effect to a long contemplated strategy: to obtain additional brewing capacity in London so that the company's valuable Pimlico site, on which the Stag brewery stood, could be developed.<br>
<br>Elected chairman of the enlarged company, Combe helped it weather the storm created by the hostile takeover bid for the company by Charles Clore of Sears Holdings in 1959. Property development was something which Watneys, unlike many of its rivals, fully appreciated at an early stage. In May 1959, just before Clore's bid, it announced the formation of a separate property company to exploit the development potential of properties no longer required as licensed premises. However, exploitation of the company's development potential had to wait for Combe and his colleagues to beat off the biggest threat to Watneys' independent existence since the financial problems caused by the famous Watney Combe Reid merger of 1898.<br>
<br>The story of the Clore takeover bid for Watneys has been told many times. Suffice it to say that Combe proved every bit as stubborn a battler as his rival. This was no brewing lamb for the slaughter. Under Combe's direction the company had already shown considerable enterprise in all aspects of modern brewing&#151;production, retailing, and property development. Unfortunately, as with many established breweries, the book value of its assets did not reflect their current market value, making it vulnerable to a bid. The share price rose during the contest to the point where Clore deemed it prudent to withdraw. Combe then led Watney Mann to national status through the acquisition of several more companies in the period from 1960 to 1965. This included substantial brewing concerns in Northampton (Phipps), Trowbridge (Ushers), Manchester (Wilson and Walker), Norwich (Steward and Patteson, and Bullard), and Edinburgh (Drybrough). The three acquisitions of 1960&#151;Phipps, Wilsons, and Ushers&#151;added 3200 public houses to Watneys' retail estate, making a total of just under 7000 pubs. The Norwich breweries taken over in 1963 added another 2000.<br>
<br>The 1960s were very much Watneys' golden age. Combe encouraged the establishment and consolidation of leading brands such as Draught Red Barrel and bottled Stingo, which were marketed on a national basis. The company also entered into important product exchange agreements with United and Allied (for lager) and Guinness (stout), and diversified into wines, spirits, and soft drinks (the company acquired the lucrative Coca Cola franchise for southern England in 1956, and a similar franchise for the eastern counties following the purchase of Morgan's brewery in Norwich in 1961). The company also made diversified investments in motels and garages through Watney Lyon Motels and Swift Garages. Combe was also a director of South African Breweries, Rhodesian Breweries, and Wiley &amp; Co.<br>
<br>Despite being a shrewd business leader, Combe played the part of traditional brewer with aristocratic pretensions. He was a keen farmer, gardener, and golfer. On 15 October 1932 he married Lady Silvia Beatrice Coke (<i>b</i>. 1909/10), elder daughter of the fourth earl of Leicester, and they lived at the Manor House, Burnham Thorpe, Norfolk. They had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>Combe was a prominent figure in the brewing lobby. In 1945 he was elected a member of the Brewers' Society council, serving on its parliamentary committee for twenty years, and acting as chairman of its hop committee from 1947 to 1956, during which time he helped to develop the industry's hop marketing scheme. He became vice-chairman of the society in 1953 and chairman in 1955&#150;6, and was subsequently a vice-president. He was also master of the Brewers' Company in 1954. Noted for his wide experience, leadership, firmness, and wise counsel, he turned Watneys into a major brewing company, but was also loyal to a tradition of family brewing. But this did not mean that he was either conservative or unadventurous. The scheme he drew up with Bass in 1954&#150;5 was extremely bold. If it had succeeded it would have created a mega-brewery thirty years ahead of its time.<br>
<br>Combe died at Watney House, Stag Place, London, on 1 April 1965 aged sixty-one. He was survived by his wife.<br>
