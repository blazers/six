<span class="headword">Ward,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Issouf Reis, Captain Wardiyya]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1553&#150;1623?), <span class="occ">pirate</span>, was said to have been a fisherman at Faversham, Kent, perhaps (from an informant's estimate of his age as fifty-five in 1608) born about 1553. He was later at Plymouth, where he joined the Royal Navy, and may have been on privateering voyages to the West Indies. Apparently he served as a petty officer on the <i>Lion's Whelp</i>, built in 1601. His career of piracy seems to have begun in 1603 with an abortive attempt to seize the considerable wealth a recusant was reported to be carrying over to France. More successfully, he captured a large French ship (renamed the <i>Little John</i>). During 1604 Ward succeeded Edward Fall as leader of this pirate band, and after putting into Cawsand Bay on the coast of Cornwall to recruit more crew, he sailed for the Mediterranean, plundering as he went.<br>
<br>Arriving off Algiers, Ward received a hostile reception and so continued east, in December taking prizes at the mouth of the Adriatic. In 1605 he was at Sal&eacute;, a nest of corsairs on Morocco's Atlantic shore, but by mid-1606 he had adopted Tunis as his base, commanding a 28-gun ship and other vessels with crews numbering 500. He was thus one of those European renegades who introduced the Barbary corsairs to the advantages for piracy of the berton or heavily armed square-rigged ship from northern waters. Later in 1606, accompanied by a pinnace of 50 tons, he cruised the eastern Mediterranean in a Flemish flyboat of 200 tons aptly named the <i>Gift</i>, manned not only by English, Dutch, and Spanish Christians but also by Turks. On this cruise he made his fortune by the capture of the <i>Rubin</i>, a Venetian argosy of 300 tons from Alexandria with a cargo of pepper, indigo, flax, and 3000 pieces of gold. Ward then fitted her out as a man-of-war, used some of his new wealth to redeem and recruit seamen from the prisons of Tunis, and put to sea again. In April 1607 he captured a second Venetian argosy, the <i>Reniera e Soderina</i>, ship and cargo being reputedly worth &#145;one hundred times a thousand pounds&#146;  (Ewen, 5&#150;6) and then in June took a third. Ward sold the cargoes to Osman Bey, commander of the janizaries and <i>de facto</i> ruler of Tunis, turned the <i>Soderina</i> into a berton mounting sixty guns, and with a crew of 250 Turks and 150 Englishmen joined at least five other Dutch corsairs. Over-gunned, top-heavy, slow, and with rotting timbers, the <i>Soderina</i> proved impractical as a warship. Ward transferred to a captured prize, leaving the <i>Soderina</i> to founder and her crew to drown off Cerigo early in 1608. Despite other reverses Ward was in both the eastern and western basins of the Mediterranean that year, capturing a Venetian galleon off the Peloponnese in March and bringing prizes into Algiers later in the year.<br>
<br>A description of Ward at this time records that he was:<blockquote>very short, with little hair, and that quite white, bald in front; swarthy face and beard. Speaks little, and almost always swearing. Drunk from morn till night. Most prodigal and plucky. Sleeps a great deal, and often on board when in port. The habits of a thorough &#145;salt&#146;. A fool and an idiot out of his trade. (Ewen, 8)</blockquote>Nevertheless about this time he was negotiating to retire to Tuscany with a fortune of 150,000 crowns.<br>
<br>In 1609 Ward continued his depredations: he was said to be off Sardinia in May with nine bertons, and his subordinate Bishop was off Ireland with ten or eleven ships and 1000 men in August. An English attempt to negotiate Ward's return to England failed, as did an attempt on his life, and despite a joint Spanish and French attack on Tunis which fired some thirty vessels, some apparently Ward's, he was said to be about to leave for Ireland with a squadron of fourteen vessels at the end of the year. By now his reputation in England was such that his exploits were celebrated not only by three ballads but by two pamphlets, neither factually reliable: <span class="italic">Newes from sea, of two notorious pyrats Ward the Englishman and Danseker the Dutchman, with a true relation of all or the most piraces by them committed unto the sixt of Aprill 1609</span> and <span class="italic">A true and certaine report of the beginning, proceedings, overthrowes, and now present estate of Captaine Ward and Dansker, the two late famous pirates; from their first setting foorth to this present time, as also with the death of divers of Wards chiefe captaines</span>.<br>
<br>The years 1610&#150;12 repeated the pattern of previous years: during sweeps through the eastern Mediterranean at least two of Ward's vessels were shipwrecked in late 1610 but his fleet still had fifteen vessels and 1500 men; in June 1611 he was said to have left Tunis for either Calabria or the Adriatic; and in March 1612 he captured the <i>Valnegrina</i>, bound for Alexandria. In late 1610 he had converted to Islam, his apostasy being made the subject of Robert Daborne's play, <span class="italic">A Christian Turn'd Turke</span> (1612), in which the fictionalized Ward met his just deserts by being torn to pieces and his remains thrown into the sea. In the same year both he and Dansiker were named and discussed in Thomas Dekker's <span class="italic">If this be not a Good Play the Devil is in it</span>. According to the Venetians he took the name of Issouf Reis; to a Tunisian source of the late seventeenth century, itself a testimony to the longevity of his fame, he was Captain Wardiyya.<br>
<br>Clearly by 1612 he had given up any idea of leaving Tunis. In or before 1615 the Scottish traveller William Lithgow dined with him in Tunis at his &#145;faire Palace, beautified with rich Marble and Alabaster stones&#146;  (Ewen, 12) and in 1616 reported that Ward in his retirement had taken to rearing chicks by incubating eggs in camel dung. Ward may have gone to sea one last time in 1622. Apparently he died in Tunis during an outbreak of plague in the summer of 1623; his body was thrown into the sea. Besides a wife in England, there was another in Tunis: Jessimina, a Palermitan renegade.<br>
