<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fewtrell,  (Ernest) Malcolm</span>  (1909&#150;2005), <span class="occ">police officer</span>, was born on 28 September 1909 at the police station in Newport Street, Ryde, Isle of Wight, one of six sons of Ernest George Fewtrell, police officer, and his wife, Minnie Albanette, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Simms. At the time of his birth his father was a police constable; later he was a detective in the Criminal Investigations Department (CID), and later still a newsagent. Three of Fewtrell's brothers also became detectives. He attended school in Reading, then worked for a year on a sheep station in Australia before returning to join the Buckinghamshire police force in 1927 as a cadet. On 4 June 1934 he married Ann Thomas, a 24-year-old nurse at the King Edward VII Hospital, Windsor (they had met when Fewtrell had had an appendix operation), and daughter of George Thomas, railway fireman. Fewtrell later described her as (like all successful policemen's wives) &#145;patient, tolerant and understanding&#146;  (Fewtrell, 8). They had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>Fewtrell gradually rose through the ranks of the Buckinghamshire police force, and was noted as a calm and capable officer. During the Second World War he was, as a policeman, prohibited from joining the armed forces, to his disappointment. In 1950 he was promoted to detective inspector, and in 1954 to detective superintendent, and head of Buckinghamshire CID.<br>
<br>Fewtrell was looking forward to his retirement, then less than a year away, when he found himself charged with solving one of the most celebrated crimes of the twentieth century. At about 4.30 a.m. on the morning of 8 August 1963 he was woken by a phone call from the police headquarters in Aylesbury, with the message &#145;There's been a train robbery at Cheddington, sir&#146;  (Fewtrell, 9). Within half an hour he was at Bridego Bridge, near Linslade, to find the Glasgow to London mail train in two parts (the engine and high-value carriage having been decoupled from the other carriages, which had been left a mile behind at Sears Crossing), sixty-five bewildered postal sorters, and a badly coshed driver; 120 mail bags containing Scottish banks' takings after a bank holiday weekend were missing. At first it was thought (in amazement) that &pound;1 million had been stolen, but over the next few days it became clear that nearer &pound;2.6 million had been taken, in what the press immediately dubbed the &#145;great train robbery&#146;. At lunchtime on the day of the robbery Fewtrell advised his chief constable to call in Scotland Yard, and from that point he shared responsibility for the investigation with Detective Superintendent Gerald McArthur of the Yard.<br>
<br>Initially there were few clues to go on. Eyewitness reports from the train crew and postmen told of around fifteen men, wearing balaclavas and gloves, operating swiftly in a highly professional, military-style operation. Fewtrell's first thought was that the robbers would have made their getaway using the nearby M1 back to London. However, the train's fireman had been told to lie still for half an hour while the gang made their getaway. Fewtrell correctly surmised that the gang was holed up in a hideaway relatively near the abandoned train. He and McArthur therefore decided to search the surrounding countryside from the train outwards up to a 30 mile perimeter. &#145;I have kicked myself thousands of times for not having ordered the search the other way round&#146;, he later wrote;  (Fewtrell, 44). They also took the calculated risk of calling a press conference to publicize their hunch. The result was spectacular: &#145;the whole country seemed to be in the grip of detective fever&#146;, Fewtrell wrote  (ibid., 57). One particular tip-off proved decisive: a local cowman, John Maris, reported suspicions about Leatherslade Farm, near Oakley in Buckinghamshire. The two officers sent to investigate found a house well stocked with food, beer, and entertainments, and, in the basement, several mailbags stuffed with bank wrappers and Post Office chits. &#145;The whole place is a clue&#146;, Fewtrell was reported as saying  (ibid.). Evidence from Scotland Yard's fingerprinting unit proved crucial in the subsequent course of the investigation, as did further tip-offs from the general public, and chance discoveries of some of the money. Fewtrell's own role was particularly important in trapping in interview Brian Field, the smooth-talking solicitor's clerk who had helped the robbers buy the farm.<br>
<br>Fewtrell also had responsibility for the security of the courtroom in which the subsequent trials were held, and for the detention and transport of the defendants. No local court was big enough to accommodate the trial, so Aylesbury district council offices were temporarily converted into a courthouse, with additional security challenges. Fewtrell was later proud that none of the defendants escaped while in the custody of his officers. He was in court on 16 April 1964 to hear the sentences on the twelve convicted men, most for thirty years. He disagreed with the view that the robbers had been handed unduly harsh sentences, and especially disliked the romanticization of their crime, emphasizing the ruthlessness of the men, and the deterrent value of the sentences. &#145;It is easy in this country for people to forget that we all live on a biscuit-thin crust above violence and social upheaval below&#146;, he later wrote  (Fewtrell, 143).<br>
<br>Having retired, Fewtrell was free to write about the investigation, unlike serving officers; he wrote two long articles that appeared in the <span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span> on 19 and 26 April 1964, and subsequently a book, <span class="italic">The Train Robbers</span> (1964). In this he was at pains to emphasize that he had &#145;no desire to take more than a very modest share of the credit&#146;  (Fewtrell, 10). On leaving the police he worked for ten years as accommodation officer for Portsmouth Polytechnic before retiring to a bungalow in Swanage, Dorset; there he organized the local neighbourhood watch and played golf into his nineties. He died at Poole Hospital on 28 November 2005, following a stroke. He was survived by his son and daughter, his wife having predeceased him.<br>
