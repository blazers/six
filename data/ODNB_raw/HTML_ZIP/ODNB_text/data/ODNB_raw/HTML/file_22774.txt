<span class="headword">Price,  William</span>  (1771&#150;1830), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, was born at Worcester on 9 November 1771, the son of a ladies' shoemaker who had a shop in the High Street, Worcester. His mother died when he was still a child, and he followed his father into the family business, which prospered, and which he ran from 1798.<br>
<br>From a young age Price, who had been taught some Latin at school, wanted to learn languages. A visit to Paris on business, in 1791, enabled him to study French, and this was followed in 1792 by a journey to Brussels, Antwerp, Rotterdam, and Amsterdam, where he learned Dutch, which introduced him to German. Returning to Britain, as war broke out, he met some Italians and learned their language; he next studied Spanish and Portuguese, moving to Russian and Hebrew before concentrating on Persian and Arabic. He came to know the philologist George Hadley, and this led in 1796 to an introduction to the orientalist William Ouseley, who helped him to obtain books for his studies, and gained him admission to the British Museum.<br>
<br>Price was largely self-taught, and made little use of dictionaries or grammars. Where possible his method of learning languages was to try to learn the pronunciation by listening to native speakers: he began studying Turkish by writing down phrases he heard spoken while in the company of the Turkish ambassador, and began Arabic through noting the colloquial phrases used by some Moroccans in London. His ear was so acute that he was able to write down with complete accuracy the words of a Persian song he had heard. He acquired a working knowledge of Sanskrit in a matter of weeks, and Chinese in a year, having studied a Chinese book setting out the Chinese method of learning the language of the Tartars, which gave him an understanding of both languages.<br>
<br>Price's proficiency in oriental languages attracted notice, and influential patrons offered him a position in the service of the East India Company, but he turned down the opportunity to go to India in the face of his father's concerns, as he was the only child. On the death of his father in 1807 he became financially secure. Being apparently unmarried and having no dependants, he retired from business in order to pursue his interest in oriental languages, purchasing manuscripts and rare books. Thomas Burgess, bishop of St David's, noted his achievements in a survey of Hebraists.<br>
<br>In 1810 Price was appointed assistant secretary and interpreter to the embassy of Sir Gore Ouseley to Persia in 1811&#150;12. Price kept a diary, and made hundreds of drawings, of both landscapes and buildings. The journal, with its illustrations, was published in 1825. Price deciphered many cuneiform inscriptions. On his return to England he devoted himself to literary pursuits. His remarkable ability was publicized in May 1813, as making him a possible candidate for the chair of oriental languages at the University of Edinburgh, made vacant by the death of Alexander Murray; the electors, however, appointed Alexander Brunton without allowing Price's claims to be considered. He taught oriental languages at the seminary of his friend, Alexander Humphreys, at Netherstone House, near Worcester. He set up a private printing press in his house, and became a member of the Royal Asiatic Society of London and the Asiatic Society of Bengal. He translated from Hindustani and Persian into both French and English and wrote books on the grammar of oriental languages. He died of apoplexy at his home at Merryman's Hill, Worcester, on 15 June 1830. He is to be distinguished from a contemporary William Price who taught oriental languages at Fort William College in Calcutta from about 1815 to 1834.<br>
