<span class="headword">Hill,  Robert Gardiner</span>  (1811&#150;1878), <span class="occ">surgeon specializing in the treatment of the insane</span>, was born at Louth, Lincolnshire, on 26 February 1811, the son of Robert Hill, a tradesman, of Leamington Spa, and his wife, Mary. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13282/', "John Harwood Hill")</script> was an elder brother. After being apprenticed to a local surgeon about 1825, Hill trained in London at Grainger's anatomy school and at Guy's and St Thomas's Hospitals. While a student in London, Hill became interested in the treatment of the insane, and there survives an extensive manuscript note made by him describing Philippe Pinel's liberation of the insane from their chains.<br>
<br>In 1834 Hill became a member of the College of Surgeons and was appointed house surgeon to the Lincoln General Dispensary. The next year he was appointed as house surgeon, or resident medical officer, to the Lincoln Asylum, where, from about 1827, Edward Parker Charlesworth, one of three physicians to the asylum, had begun to reduce the level of mechanical restraint, such as strait-jackets and handcuffs, used on patients. With indefatigable energy and tremendous determination Hill took these measures further until by 1838 restraint had been abandoned altogether at Lincoln. This was the first example of what came to be known as the non-restraint system in the treatment of lunatics. Hill publicized the achievement through a lecture in Lincoln in 1838 and by a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Total Abolition of Personal Restraint in the Treatment of the Insane</span> (1839). Although Hill succeeded in abolishing mechanical restraints it was necessary for him to impose rigorous discipline on his subordinates to ensure that they did not revert to using them. As a result there was a high level of tension among the attendants and officers of the asylum. This, coupled with the animosity of the governors and physicians, led to fierce infighting at the asylum from 1839, which led to Hill's resignation in 1840. With the departure of Hill, the momentum for non-restraint was lost at Lincoln. The debate over the merits of non-restraint was transferred to the columns of <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> in 1839 to 1841 and the most prominent site for developing non-restraint methods became the Middlesex County Asylum at Hanwell, where its governors, especially John Adams, and its medical superintendent John Conolly, did most to make non-restraint an orthodox doctrine of British psychiatry.<br>
<br>After retiring from the Lincoln Asylum, Hill's professional career was rather unremarkable. In 1840 he applied unsuccessfully for two asylum jobs (one of them being that of medical officer at Hanwell under Conolly). After ten years of general practice partnership in Lincoln, he opened, in 1851, Eastgate House, a small private asylum for female patients. The same year Hill was presented with a testimonial by the mayor of Lincoln, and in 1852 Hill himself was elected mayor. Eastgate House closed in 1856 and Hill went to London to become a co-owner (with Dr E. Willett) of Wyke House, another small asylum. In 1860 he dissolved the partnership, returned to Lincoln, and became an owner of Shillingthorpe House at Greatford, a decaying institution with a handful of patients, which was abandoned in less than three years. In 1863 Hill again moved to London, this time to take up the position of medical superintendent and co-owner of Earl's Court House, a private asylum for about twenty-five female patients, where he spent the rest of his life. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1853.<br>
<br>Hill's claim to be the originator of the non-restraint system led him into conflict with his colleagues. In 1850, he responded through the correspondence columns of <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> to comments made by Conolly and Charlesworth, and reiterated his claim. The debate opened again in 1857 when Hill repeated his claim in his <span class="italic">Concise History of the Entire Abolition of Medical Restraint</span>, a work prompted by Conolly's own piece on non-restraint published the year before. The argument resurfaced again in 1870 in Hill's <span class="italic">Lunacy: its Past and Present</span>; this time he had been provoked by Sir James Clark's <span class="italic">Memoir of John Conolly</span> (1869).<br>
<br>Hill died on 30 May 1878 of apoplexy and chronic kidney disease at Earl's Court House, Earl's Court Road, London, and was buried in Highgate cemetery; he left a widow, Charlotte. One of his sons inherited the house, and another son also took up psychiatry.<br>
