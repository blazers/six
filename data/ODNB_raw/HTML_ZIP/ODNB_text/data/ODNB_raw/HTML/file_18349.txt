<span class="headword">Matthiessen,  Augustus</span>  (1831&#150;1870), <span class="occ">chemist and physicist</span>, was born in London on 2 January 1831, the son of William Matthiessen and his wife, Jane. His father, who died while Matthiessen was quite young, was a merchant. A paralytic seizure during infancy produced a permanent and severe twitching of Matthiessen's right hand. Notwithstanding the taste for chemistry which he displayed as a boy, on leaving school he was sent by his guardians to learn farming with a Dorset farmer, as being the only occupation suited to his condition. He then considered a business career, but became interested in the new subject of agricultural chemistry and, on coming of age, went to the University of Giessen in Germany, where he studied under Will and H. L. Buff, and graduated PhD. From 1853 he spent nearly four years under Professor Robert Wilhelm Bunsen at Heidelberg, and by means of his electrolytic method isolated the metals calcium and strontium in the pure state for the first time. In Professor Kirchhoff's physics laboratory he studied the electrical conductivity of these new metals and of many others, publishing his results in Germany and England. He returned to London in 1857 with a thorough knowledge of the methods of physics and of inorganic chemistry, and studied organic chemistry with Professor August Wilhelm von Hofmann at the Royal College of Chemistry. Work done under Hofmann's direction led the way to Matthiessen's considerable researches on the opium alkaloids of later years. Matthiessen soon fitted up his own laboratory at 1 Torrington Place, where he began a series of investigations on the physical properties of pure metals and alloys which has become a classic.<br>
<br>The preparation of copper of the greatest conductivity had great practical importance in connection with telegraphy; Matthiessen showed that the discrepancies of previous observations and the low conductivity of certain supposedly pure samples were due to the presence of minute quantities of other elements. He embodied his results in a report presented in 1860 to the government committee appointed to inquire into the subject, and in a paper with M. Holzmann, published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>. In 1861 he became a fellow, and afterwards a member, of the council of the Royal Society. In 1862 he was elected to the lectureship on chemistry at St Mary's Hospital, a post which he held until 1868. During 1862&#150;5 he undertook important voluntary work for the British Association committee on electrical standards, and in the latter year constructed for them ten standards of resistance and several copies of these, made from various metals and alloys.<br>
<br>In 1867 Matthiessen summarized his work on the constitution of alloys in a lecture given before the Chemical Society. Besides demonstrating that tin, lead, zinc, and cadmium behaved differently in alloys from other metals, he made two general suggestions of great importance: first, that small amounts of impurity in a metal do not produce the remarkable changes in physical properties by their direct action, but by causing the metal with which they are alloyed to assume an allotropic, or different, form; and second, that in most cases alloys must be considered as &#145;solidified solutions&#146;. In 1868 Matthiessen was appointed lecturer on chemistry at St Bartholomew's Hospital in conjunction with Professor William Odling; on the latter's resignation in 1870 he became sole lecturer. In 1869 he was awarded a royal medal by the Royal Society &#145;for his researches on the electric and other physical and chemical properties of metals and their alloys&#146;. Besides his other work he had a large private practice as a consulting chemist, and from January 1869 to June 1870 was one of the editors of the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>. In 1870 he was appointed examiner to the University of London. On 6 October of the same year he committed suicide in his laboratory at St Bartholomew's. He left a note saying that he had been charged with indecent assault on a boy, and that he was innocent, but could not bear to face the proceedings. At the time of his death he was a member of a committee inquiring into the chemical nature of pure cast iron, and he was also experimenting with the construction of a standard pyrometer.<br>
<br>Matthiessen was a prolific author of scientific papers. His researches showed remarkable acuteness, experimental skill, and conscientiousness, together with a distinct power of generalization. That with his physical defect he should have accomplished so much delicate and exact work is a proof of rare perseverance and his contemporaries thought highly of him.<br>
