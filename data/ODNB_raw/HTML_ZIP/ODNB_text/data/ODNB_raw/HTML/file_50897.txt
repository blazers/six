<span class="headword">Stent,  Peter</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1613, <em>d.</em> 1665), <span class="occ">printseller and printer</span>, was born at Binsted, Hampshire, the second of the seven children of John Stent (<i>d</i>. in or before 1645) and his wife, Joan (<i>d</i>. in or after 1645). A prosperous man, John Stent left cash bequests of &pound;622, with &pound;106 destined to Peter. The son served ten years (1627&#150;37) as a Merchant Taylors' Company apprentice, originally to Elizabeth Lowe (<i>fl</i>. 1620&#150;1630), widow of George Lowe (<i>fl</i>. 1612&#150;1626), a London printer of engravings. Stent remained a member of the Merchant Taylors' Company for life. About 1642 he opened a shop in Giltspur Street, just outside Newgate, London, where he sold engravings printed on his own rolling presses. Disruptions during the civil war presented an opportunity to purchase over 700 plates from printsellers and artists, for which his father's bequest provided capital; Stent aggressively added new pieces until he had eight times more plates than any predecessor&#151;over 1750.<br>
<br>Stent sold copies after European masters (Leonardo, Raphael, Van Dyck, and Rembrandt) and English artists (Francis Clein, William Dobson, and Robert Walker), as well as prints by the best engravers working in England (William Faithorne, Wenceslaus Hollar, and Francis Barlow). However, the bulk of his inventory strove for utilitarian currency across a broad range of subjects: military exercises, the only county maps with roads, writing instruction, business forms, architectural manuals, natural history sketches, religious items, satires, and even pornography; 300 portraits illustrated shifting political factions and cultural achievements in England and Europe. Such prints could be framed and varnished for home decoration, while the portraits, borrowed by contemporary publishers to illustrate history books, were later prized by collectors for interleaving in James Granger's <span class="italic">Biographical History of England &hellip; [with a] Catalogue of Engraved British Heads</span> (1769).<br>
<br>Stent's clientele could afford a few pennies for small, crude works, but would pause at the shilling or two required for large, quality prints. The business was driven not by artistic considerations, but by the question of whether his projects could recapture the investment in materials, shop overheads, and hourly rates paid to engravers. Preferring old-style patrons to this new commercialism, the etcher Hollar complained that Stent paid a &#145;trifle&#146; for a valuable landscape and declined to purchase a plate portraying Thomas Hobbes  (Globe, 33). To make money the product had to be novel, affordable, and available before it appeared in competitors' shops. Notices in newspapers encouraged new customers; broadside advertisements doubled as wholesale order forms.<br>
<br>Stent and his wife, Susanna, had a daughter, Elizabeth, still a minor when he died of the plague on 29 September 1665. He bequeathed small cash gifts to two brothers and a sister who had gone unmentioned in their father's will; Elizabeth received &pound;250. His wife inherited the substantial estate, including a house in Snow Hill and the shop, whose plates alone were worth between 4<i>s</i>. and &pound;2 each. She soon sold the business to John Overton (1640&#150;1713), under whom it thrived.<br>
