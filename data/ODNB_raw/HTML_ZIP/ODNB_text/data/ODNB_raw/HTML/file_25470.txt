<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Shovell, Sir  Cloudesley</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1650, <em>d.</em> 1707), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, baptized on 25 November 1650 at Cockthorpe, on the north Norfolk coast, was the son of John Shovell (1625&#150;1654), from a Norwich family of property and distinction, and Anne (<i>bap</i>. 1628, <i>d</i>. 1709), daughter of Henry Jenkinson of Cley. His unusual forename derives from the family name of his maternal grandmother, Lucy Cloudesley (1608&#150;1627), and his uncle Cloudesley Jenkinson (1639&#150;1696). Cloudesley Shovell's father died when he was about four and his mother married John Flaxman (<i>d</i>. 1687) in 1659.<h2>
<a name="Earlynavalcareer"></a>Early naval career</h2>Shovell first went to sea through his father's connections with two naval officers from Cockthorpe, Sir Christopher Myngs and Sir John Narbrough. In 1663 he was with Myngs in the West Indies as a cabin-boy and servant. After Myngs's death in the Four Days' Battle in June 1666 he continued with Narbrough in the same capacity. He was with him in 1667 when Narbrough took Cayenne and perhaps on Narbrough's voyage to the Pacific in 1670&#150;71. The first official record of Shovell's naval service is dated 22 January 1672, when he entered as a midshipman on board the duke of York's flagship <i>Royal Prince</i> seventeen days after the duke appointed Captain Narbrough his first lieutenant in that ship.<br>
<br>With Narbrough, Shovell was present at the battle of Solebay on 28 May 1672. On 17 September 1672 he followed him as a master's mate, one of the 210 volunteers from <i>Royal Prince</i> who moved into <i>Fairfax</i>. When Narbrough shifted command to <i>St Michael</i>, Shovell followed in the same capacity. Later in the same year he followed him again to <i>Henrietta</i>, where, through Narbrough's influence, Shovell was appointed second lieutenant on 23 September 1673. Shortly afterwards they sailed to the Mediterranean for the naval campaign against Tripoli. In 1675 Narbrough moved to the <i>Harwich</i>, and Shovell followed as a lieutenant. On 14 January 1676 Shovell commanded the squadron's boats that burned shipping in Tripoli harbour and earned himself fame through Narbrough's dispatch describing the action, which was subsequently printed (<span class="italic">London Gazette</span>). Even before its publication Pepys wrote to Narbrough about &#145;Lieutenant Shovell, with whose management his Majesty and my lords are most particularly satisfied&#146;  (Tanner, 3.179; 4.295). Narbrough rewarded the boat crews with 1956 pieces of eight, of which Shovell received 80, the largest amount, and to which Charles II added a further reward, including a medal valued at the exceptional amount of &pound;100. On 3 May 1677 Shovell was appointed first lieutenant in Narbrough's flagship, the <i>Plymouth</i>, and joined Narbrough in attesting to a report on the satisfactory state of work being done on the new mole at Tangier.<br>
<br>In September 1677, when Thomas Harman died of his wounds in the action with the <i>Golden Horse</i>, Narbrough appointed Shovell to take Harman's place in command of the 28-gun <i>Sapphire</i>. In her he made a dramatic chase of a 44-gun Turkish warship from Tripoli to the Spanish coast, which only narrowly escaped capture in October 1677. As Narbrough prepared for his departure for England in the spring of 1679, Shovell assisted the admiral and the commissioners who concluded a peace treaty with Tripoli, for which Shovell received &pound;100 as a reward. Narbrough and his vice-admiral, Arthur Herbert, shifted Shovell from one command to another as they attempted to deal with the conflicting demands of the Algerine war and the defence of Tangier from Sal&eacute;. In April&#150;May 1679 Herbert placed Shovell in command of the 36-gun <i>Phoenix</i>; then, in May, the Admiralty ordered him back to <i>Sapphire</i>. In July 1680 Herbert moved him to the <i>Nonsuch</i>, then, in September, at Shovell's request, returned him to the <i>Sapphire</i>. Finally, in April 1681, Herbert moved him to the 30-gun <i>James Galley</i>, where he remained for the next five years. In her he assisted the <i>Sapphire</i> in capturing the 32-gun Algerine cruiser <i>Half Moon</i> in September, and in December joined the <i>Adventure</i> in driving the 34-gun Algerine corsair <i>Flower-Pot</i> ashore near Mazagan. In April 1682 he assisted Herbert in the treaty that ended the four and a half year long war with Algiers. In May and in November he was also at Tripoli for negotiations. When the Admiralty ordered Herbert home, Shovell remained for a year in command of the five-ship Mediterranean squadron.<br>
<br>At Cadiz on 23 June 1683 to convoy English merchantmen, Shovell was pressured by the conde de Aguilar into saluting the Spanish king without receiving a return salute to his own sovereign. He complied with this demand to protect the merchantmen, whose cargoes would have otherwise been seized or destroyed, but his decision outraged Pepys and Lord Dartmouth, both of whom vowed to court-martial him. However, when the circumstances were reported to the king, Charles II placed no blame on Shovell.<br>
<br>Shovell irritated Pepys again after Dartmouth arrived with the fleet in the Mediterranean to dismantle the garrison at Tangier. This time Shovell, along with Wheeler and Aylmer, produced friction when they were clearly reluctant to sign the report justifying the destruction of the new mole at Tangier. After dismantling the garrison, Dartmouth returned to England, leaving Shovell in charge of a seven-ship squadron. He towed the Tangier pontoon to Cadiz and later cruised off Sal&eacute; and the Strait of Gibraltar.<br>
<br>Shovell returned to England at the end of 1686 and in April 1687 took command of the 62-gun <i>Anne</i>, flagship of the duke of Grafton. In her he escorted the queen of Portugal from Rotterdam to Lisbon and then returned to the Mediterranean to ensure that the treaty with Algiers was not broken, negotiating for the release of some English prisoners. In June 1687 he detained the <i>James and Mary</i>, commanded by William Phipps, to secure the silver plate Phipps had recovered from a wrecked galleon in the West Indies.<br>
<br>In April 1688 Shovell took command of the <i>Dover</i>. When William III sailed from the Netherlands in November, Shovell was assigned to Dartmouth's fleet, but was cruising independently until 9 November. A few days later Russell named Shovell as one of eight captains &#145;resolved to salute Dartmouth and come over to us&#146;  (BL, Egerton MS 2621). After William III accepted Dartmouth's profession of loyalty and ordered him with the main fleet to the Nore, William ordered the <i>Dover</i> to remain with a dozen more vessels at Spithead under Sir John Berry. There, they served to guard against any French attack and to prevent any suspicious movements at Portsmouth. In particular, Shovell was assigned to take precautions against attempts to smuggle the infant prince of Wales to France.<h2>
<a name="TheNineYearsWar"></a>The Nine Years' War</h2>In mid-January 1689 the fleet was reorganized and Shovell joined the newly formed squadron under Commodore John Ashby. In April he took command of the 70-gun <i>Edgar</i>, assigned to Herbert's fleet, which was one of nineteen ships that engaged the French at Bantry Bay, on 1 May 1689. After the battle the fleet returned to Portsmouth, where the king knighted Shovell and Ashby on board the flagship of the newly created earl of Torrington at Portsmouth on 15 May.<br>
<br>On 24 October Shovell shifted to command the <i>Monk</i>. His initial assignment to join the West Indies squadron in her was scrapped and instead he commanded a small squadron cruising between the Isles of Scilly and Ireland. As early as January 1690 Shovell was marked for promotion to rear-admiral of the blue, but this did not take place until June, after it was clear that he had no role in a conspiracy in the fleet. In the spring of 1690 he saw action near Dublin and oversaw the transport of the army and its equipment to Ireland. As part of this movement, on 11 June the king embarked in the yacht <i>Mary</i> (Captain Grenville Collins) at Hoylake and sailed to Carrickfergus, with 288 transports carrying 36,000 troops under Shovell's escort. On arrival William shifted to Shovell's barge to land. Occupied on this duty, Shovell was unavailable when the French fleet attacked Torrington off Beachy Head.<br>
<br>On receiving news of the battle, the queen's council sent orders to Shovell and to Vice-Admiral Henry Killigrew, returning with his squadron from the Mediterranean, to join Torrington. Shovell immediately sailed for Plymouth, where he met up with Killigrew. In London, both Shovell and Killigrew were mentioned as possible candidates to be one of the joint admirals to succeed Torrington in command of the main fleet. In the course of this discussion, Queen Mary told the king that her advisers considered Shovell &#145;the best officer of his age&#146;  (Mary to William, 6/16 July 1690, <span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1690&#150;91</i>, 53). The presence of the French fleet in the channel, however, prevented the detached squadrons from reinforcing the main fleet. In light of this, Shovell was ordered to cruise in the Soundings and guard against any French attempt to attack Ireland. On reports that French frigates were at Kinsale, he sailed there, where the enemy had just surrendered to English forces under Major-General Kirke. With Duncannon Castle still resisting, Shovell immediately ordered several frigates to bring about its reduction on 28 July. From there, he sailed for Plymouth, but was recalled to form a squadron to intercept a French squadron reportedly covering the evacuation of Galway and Limerick. Interrupted in this by other demands, Shovell was ordered by the Admiralty to sail for the Downs. Arriving on 10 October, he received new orders to take all available ships to Plymouth and to cruise for the protection of trade in the Soundings. He returned to the Downs in mid-January 1691 to join the fleet escorting the king to the Netherlands. At The Hague, on 17 February, the king appointed him major of the 1st marine regiment. Upon his return, he joined the main fleet under Russell. His early naval patron Sir John Narbrough had died in the West Indies in 1688, and on 10 March 1691 Shovell married his widow, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hill (1659&#150;1732).<br>
<br>In July 1691 Shovell was sent to get intelligence of the French fleet at Brest and proceeded close inshore, imitating a returning French fleet with English prizes. With this ruse, he seized several French merchant vessels loaded with money and ascertained that an unexpectedly powerful force of eighty-four ships of the line lay at Brest. At the end of the campaigning season ashore, he escorted the king from the Netherlands to Margate, where the king landed on 19 October. While still at the camp at Ath, the king additionally commissioned Shovell lieutenant-colonel of the 2nd marine regiment. In January 1692 Shovell was promoted rear-admiral of the red and in March again escorted the king back to the Netherlands. Afterwards he rejoined Herbert's fleet and was among the eighty ships with him on 19 May, when they encountered the French fleet off Barfleur.<br>
<br>Shovell commanded the rear division of Herbert's centre squadron. At 11 a.m. the opposing fleets opened fire in light west-south-westerly winds at such close, musket-shot, range that Shovell later remarked he had never before seen two fleets engage at such short distance. After about two hours the wind shifted, giving Shovell the opportunity to luff up into the new breeze and break through the French line. Seven of his nine ships were able to follow his manoeuvre. The Dutch, in the allied van, made a similar tactical manoeuvre and forced the French to double back on their own line. When the fog cleared momentarily, Shovell engaged Tourville's flagship and six others, but the wind quickly died again and, as the tide turned and began to sweep the opposing fleets to the east, Tourville anchored. Shovell followed suit, but the opposing ships could only exchange fire from their stern and bow guns. Shovell immediately attempted to dislodge the French by sending down fireships on the tide. Shortly thereafter he faced nine French ships coming down the tide. In the face of this new threat, he cut his anchor cables and drifted past Tourville's squadron, which succeeded in heavily damaging Shovell's ships at close range. By ten in the evening the engagement had ended, but the larger English force had not destroyed the smaller French fleet.<br>
<br>Shovell pursued the main body of the French fleet as it moved westward. About midnight the next day, with his flagship nearly disabled by the heavy fire it received, Shovell shifted his flag to the frigate <i>Kent</i>. Continuing westward, he soon led the chase with ten ships. He came nearly within gunshot off Cherbourg on 21 May, but withheld fire, awaiting reinforcements. He followed the French to the roadstead of La Hogue and anchored offshore. The following morning Russell ordered him to attack, but he could not, without wind. At this point Shovell reported that he was suffering from a sudden and severe illness, probably blood poisoning from the splinter wound in the thigh received during the fleet action. Rooke took Shovell's place and carried on the attack. Shovell returned to the <i>Royal William</i> and proceeded to Portsmouth for repair, later going on the Chatham Dockyard. He came ashore on 28 May to recuperate at Fareham.<br>
<br>In late 1692 the dispute that had arisen between Russell and Nottingham over the conduct of the fleet developed into a party political battle in parliament as well as a conflict between Commons and Lords. As a result it became difficult to choose any one individual to command the fleet for the 1693 season. It was 23 January 1693 before three flag officers were appointed to jointly command the fleet. They were Killigrew and Delaval, two officers with tory political leanings, and Shovell, who was known as a whig. Shovell was the junior of the three and appointed admiral of the blue. On 27 April he joined his father-in-law, John Hill, as an extra commissioner of the Navy Board.<br>
<br>On 15 May 1693 the joint admirals met and considered a plan to convoy a large number of merchantmen to the Mediterranean. Not knowing the exact location of the enemy fleet, the admirals waited until they could obtain more information. A few days later, at the queen's command, the Admiralty overruled this decision, whereupon the joint admirals decided to take the main fleet to accompany Rooke's convoy escort to a position 90 miles west-south-west of Ushant. There they planned to leave Rooke to proceed on his own. On reaching that position the joint admirals still had no information on the whereabouts of the French fleet and decided to stay with Rooke for an additional 60 miles. On 7 June the joint admirals turned to the north, thinking that the longer they stayed with Rooke, the more they were leaving England open to attack from Brest. Not knowing that the French fleet had sailed to the south, they had unwittingly left Rooke and his fleet to fall into the hands of the combined Brest&#150;Toulon squadrons lying in wait at Lagos Bay on the south coast of Portugal.<br>
<br>News of the disastrous attack on the Smyrna merchantmen reached London in mid-July 1693 and the joint admirals' entire conduct of the operation came under tumultuous parliamentary criticism. Although the joint admirals escaped censure, they were dismissed from their joint command and Russell was recalled to replace them and to serve as first lord of a newly reconstituted Admiralty board.<br>
<br>Later, Shovell was named to command the squadron for the West Indies, but Francis Wheeler replaced him before it sailed. In 1694 he purchased an estate, May Place, at Crayford, Kent, and later that year returned to sea as vice-admiral of the red in the main fleet under Lord Berkeley. He participated in the expedition to Camaret Bay which carried the troops under Lieutenant-General Thomas Talmash and also included some of William Meester's &#145;machine vessels&#146; (vessels of 20&#150;100 tons filled with explosives; towed inshore just before a naval bombardment, they were detonated by a preset firing mechanism, the explosions signalling the main attack). In November Shovell was again the centre of attention. In the Downs, he ordered the <i>Stirling Castle</i> to fire on the 56-gun Danish warship <i>Gyldenl&oslash;ve</i>, commanded by a future Danish admiral, Captain Niels Lauritzen Barfoed, for failing to strike her pendant in salute to the queen's flag in English home waters.<br>
<br>In May 1695 Shovell was promoted and retroactively paid the allowance of his earlier rank as admiral of the blue from 1 January 1694. In 1695 he was in command of the <i>Cambridge</i> as well as acting as Berkeley's second flag officer while in command in the attacks on St Malo and Dunkirk. In August he was spoken of for commanding a small Mediterranean squadron, but eventually Russell was sent with a full fleet of fifty-six ships. In December he took command of the <i>Duchess</i>. In April 1696 he commanded the <i>Victory</i> as well as being admiral of the blue at the bombardment of Calais. After he had operated in the Bay of Biscay in July and August, the Admiralty sent orders to Shovell to command the fleet in the Mediterranean, but when the French Toulon squadron slipped into Brest that plan was not put into effect. He commanded the Channel Fleet in the remainder of the war in 1697 and in March succeeded Lord Berkeley as colonel of the 2nd marine regiment.<br>
<br>Shovell was appointed commander-in-chief of vessels in the Thames and Medway in August 1698, providing escort for the king on his return from the Netherlands in November. In the parliamentary election of 1698 he was returned as second member for Rochester and retained that seat until 1701. In March 1699 he exchanged his position as an extra commissioner to be one of the principal officers of the Navy Board as controller of victualling accounts.<br>
<br>Shovell returned to command the Channel Fleet again in 1701. It was probably in the early months of Anne's reign that John Macky wrote his posthumously published note on Shovell:<blockquote>No man understands the Affairs of the Navy better, or is beloved of the Sailors so well as he. He loves the <i>Constitution</i> of his <i>Country</i> and serves it without <i>factious aim</i>; he &hellip; proves a very grateful Husband &hellip; hath very good Natural Parts; familiar and plain in his Conversation; dresses without affectation; is a very large, fat, fair Man. (<span class="italic">Memoirs of the Secret Services</span>, 121)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="WaroftheSpanishSuccession"></a>War of the Spanish Succession</h2>Shortly after Anne's accession to the throne, Shovell was promoted admiral of the white (May 1702) and presided over the court martial of Rear-Admiral Sir John Munden. Then he returned to sea as second in command to Rooke. When Rooke sailed to attack Cadiz, he ordered Shovell to cruise in the Atlantic in search of the French naval squadron escorting the returning Spanish bullion fleet. Receiving news that it had arrived at Vigo, Shovell rushed to support Rooke, arriving four days after the initial attack. When Rooke left for home with the main fleet, he remained behind to manage the aftermath of the action, to repair and re-rig the captured vessels, and to supervise the care of disabled ships, destroying those that could not be taken to sea. In particular, he was ordered to prevent any embezzlement of prize goods. He completed this work and departed Vigo on 25 October, but was delayed in his return by bad weather.<br>
<br>In early 1703 Shovell became one of the advisers to the newly formed ordnance establishment and was also present at the opening of the goods from Vigo and to make an account of them. That same year he commanded the squadron in the Mediterranean, where he first attempted to make contact with the Camisard rebels in the C&eacute;vennes, then sailed for Leghorn, where he arrived on 19 September. When he found that the Austrians had no plans for the fleet to support their military operations, he departed for England.<br>
<br>A few days after his return, Shovell and several vessels had anchored at the Gunfleet on 27 November 1703 before proceeding up the Thames. Caught there by the great storm, his flagship, <i>Triumph</i>, broke her anchor and had her rudder torn off. Dragging her bower anchor and driving toward the Galloper sand, the ship was saved by Shovell when he ordered the main mast to be cut down.<br>
<br>In early 1704, on reports that the Brest fleet had sailed to the Mediterranean, Shovell was ordered to take a large reinforcement of twenty-five ships to Rooke's assistance. Joining with Rooke on 16 June off Lagos Bay, he took part in the capture of Gibraltar, a place that he knew well from his earlier postings in the Mediterranean, and in the fleet battle off V&eacute;lez-Malaga on 13 August. In September he returned to England with Rooke's fleet. On 25 December he left office as controller of victualling accounts and on 26 December 1704 became rear-admiral of England and a member of the lord high admiral's council. On 13 January 1705 he succeeded Rooke as admiral of the fleet. Later in the year he was returned as member of parliament in the first seat for Rochester.<br>
<br>On 1 May 1705 the lord high admiral appointed Shovell and the earl of Peterborough joint admirals for an expedition to the Mediterranean to seize Toulon. The fleet of twenty-nine ships of the line sailed from St Helens on 23 May, and reached Lisbon on 11 June. The Toulon operation and other alternatives were set aside when, at the express desire of King Charles, the Austrian candidate for the Spanish throne, the fleet sailed to Barcelona. Peterborough landed with the troops without opposition on 12 August, accompanied by King Charles and the prince of Hesse-Darmstadt. After considerable debate between the Dutch, King Charles's court, Shovell, and Peterborough over the next step, they agreed to besiege Barcelona, which capitulated three weeks later, on 23 September. With no appropriate winter base in the Mediterranean, Shovell left Peterborough at Barcelona and returned to England.<br>
<br>In 1706 Shovell embarked troops to make a false attack on Normandy, but, when bad weather prevented that attack, he proceeded to Portugal with the troops. The original plan was to land the forces in Portugal for an overland attack on Madrid, but an English council of war objected to the Portuguese plan to divide English forces between two armies. Declining this, Shovell landed them in February 1707 at Alicante. Ordering Sir George Byng to support operations, he returned to Lisbon to refit. Two months later he went to Barcelona where Byng, with Vice-Admiral Phillips van der Goes and the Dutch squadron, rejoined him on 20 May. There, Shovell was instrumental in persuading Charles III to implement the long-planned assault on Toulon. In July, near Toulon, Duke Victor Amadeus II of Savoy and Prince Eugene of Savoy consulted with Shovell on board his flagship, <i>Association</i>. After Shovell agreed to keep ships available throughout the following winter, the commanders resolved to march the allied armies directly on Toulon. More than 100 cannon were landed from the fleet, and allied forces were in such force that the French sank many of their warships in Toulon harbour. The siege continued until 4 August, when French troops rallied. The allied generals decided they could not prevail. By 23 August the armies had dispersed and Shovell, deeply disappointed, sailed for Gibraltar.<br>
<br>Continuing on with twenty-one ships in the main fleet, he reached the Soundings on the morning of 21 October. On the following day, while trying to confirm its position, the fleet lay to in hazy weather from early in the afternoon until nightfall, and Shovell detached three vessels for Plymouth, apparently thinking the fleet was further to the eastward than it was. Shortly after six, still unable to confirm his position, Shovell ordered the fleet to continue up the channel in fleet formation. At about eight, in dark and rainy weather, lookouts in several ships suddenly saw rocks and the loom of the St Agnes light. Several warning guns were fired, but before the flagship could manoeuvre she struck the Outer Gilstone Rock in the Isles of Scilly and sank quickly. Most of the nineteen vessels in the fleet escaped a similar fate, but the 54-gun <i>Romney</i> was wrecked on the same rocks, while the 70-gun <i>Eagle</i> sank off the Tearing Ledge, just south-east of the Bishop and Clerks rocks. Of the 1315 men in these three ships, there was only one survivor, a quartermaster from the <i>Romney</i>. Shovell's body came ashore from the wreck on the south side of St Mary's Island at Porth Hellick Cove. The fact that he came ashore more than 6 miles from the wreck site, in close proximity to the bodies of his two stepsons&#151;Sir John Narbrough and James Narbrough&#151;a pet dog, and the flagship's captain, suggest that they had been able to leave the wreck together in a boat. Numerous legends and traditional stories surround these events. The most persistent is the alleged confession of a woman in the 1730s, who on her deathbed reported that she had found Shovell alive on the beach and, coveting the emerald ring on his finger, took his life. As her dying wish, the parish priest sent the ring to James, earl of Berkeley. In 1879 a similar ring was in the possession of the Berkeley family, but has not been traced since.<br>
<br>The <i>Salisbury</i> carried the body to Plymouth, where Dr James Younge embalmed it at the Naval Hospital, before it was taken by land to London. Shovell's death, with the loss of the <i>Association</i> and her consorts, was a great national disaster and accompanied by a great outpouring of grief. The embalmed body lay in state at the queen's expense at Shovell's home in Frith Street, Soho. Two months after the accident, on 22 December 1707, it was borne in an elaborate hearse to Westminster Abbey, where he was buried in the south choir aisle, near the east cloister door. John Molesworth summarized Shovell's reputation when he wrote to his mother, on hearing the news of his death: &#145;He is universally regretted for his courage, capacity, and honesty, which it will be hard to parallel in another commander&#146;  (<span class="italic">Various Collections</span>, 8.240).<br>
<br>Shovell left his London house, an estate at Crayford, Kent, and a considerable fortune. Survived by his mother, who died in 1709, and his wife, who lived until April 1732, Shovell also left two daughters. The elder, Elizabeth (1692&#150;1750), married Sir Robert Marsham (1685&#150;1724), created Baron Romney in 1716. After his death she married John Carmichael, third earl of Hyndford, the English minister at Berlin (1741&#150;4), St Petersburg (1744&#150;9), and at The Hague, where she died in 1750. Shovell's second daughter, Anne (1696&#150;1741), married, first, the Hon. Robert Mansell (<i>d</i>. 1723), and, second, John Blackwood.<br>
