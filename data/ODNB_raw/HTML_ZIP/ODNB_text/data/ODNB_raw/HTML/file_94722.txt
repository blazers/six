<span class="headword">M&uuml;nster <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Monster]</span>,  Ernst Friedrich Herbert  von</span>, Count M&uuml;nster-Ledenburg in the nobility of the Holy Roman empire  (1766&#150;1839), <span class="occ">politician and courtier</span>, was born on 1 March 1766 in Osnabr&uuml;ck, Germany, the only son of Georg Ludwig Dietrich von Monster (1721&#150;1773), courtier (<i>Hofmarschall</i>) in the ecclesiastical state of Osnabr&uuml;ck, and his second wife, Eleonore von Grothaus zu Ledenburg (1734&#150;1794). His father married Eleonore after the death of his first wife, who left him two sons and two daughters, with whom the young Monster grew up.<br>
<br>The most important influence on Monster's education was his mother, an educated woman with a scholarly reputation whose position at the court of Brunswick as supervisor and tutor to Caroline of Brunswick, the future wife of George IV, played an important role in Monster's career. His education started at the age of twelve when he joined the Philantrophin in Dessau. Three years at the Ritterakademie in L&uuml;neburg followed before he entered the University of G&ouml;ttingen, where he read law from 1784 to 1787. During his time at the university Monster first made contact with members of the British royal family, meeting the princes Ernest, Augustus, and Adolphus, whom George III had sent to study in G&ouml;ttingen.<br>
<br>After taking his degree at G&ouml;ttingen M&uuml;nster (as he spelled his name from 1792, when he was made a count) joined the administration of the electorate of Hanover. His career as a civil servant was interrupted in the summer of 1793 when George III ordered M&uuml;nster to go on a private mission to Rome, whence he was to accompany Prince Augustus back to Britain. Augustus had married Lady Augusta Murray against the will of his father and without the sanction necessary since the <span class="roman">Royal Marriage Act</span> of 1772. It is not clear why M&uuml;nster was chosen, but his mother's position at the court of Brunswick, where George III's sister Augusta lived as the wife of the reigning Duke Charles, and M&uuml;nster's acquaintance with the prince in G&ouml;ttingen, seem to have recommended him for the mission. M&uuml;nster arrived with Augustus in Britain in September 1794. He stayed at Windsor for four months where he met both George III and Queen Charlotte, embarking afterwards on a further journey to Italy, again as companion to Augustus. M&uuml;nster used this time in Rome and Naples for the intensive study of ancient art and architecture. He returned to Hanover in 1798.<br>
<br>Throughout his career M&uuml;nster benefited from his good understanding and a close connection with the British royal family. In 1797 he was considered a likely candidate for a special mission to the court of the margrave of Baden at Rastatt. However, M&uuml;nster's breakthrough in the Hanoverian government dates to 1801 when George III sent him to St Petersburg to ensure that the Russian government considered Hanoverian interests in the new territorial arrangements for Germany. M&uuml;nster's diplomatic star rose and he gained popularity within the political circles of Europe despite his failure to achieve a substantial territorial indemnification for Hanover.<br>
<br>The French occupation of Hanover in 1803 caused George III to consider a new appointment for the position of the Hanoverian minister in London, and in the following year the king ordered that M&uuml;nster return from St Petersburg and proceed to the British capital. M&uuml;nster became &#145;head of the German chancery&#146;, the office of the Hanoverian minister, in 1805. The first two years in London can be seen as M&uuml;nster's most successful time in office. He played an important part in the negotiation for a European coalition against Napoleon's France in 1805, succeeded in promoting the Hanoverian cause in parliament and in public throughout the crises of 1806, and established himself within metropolitan social and political circles, making the acquaintance of both whig and tory politicians.<br>
<br>How much M&uuml;nster's position depended on the support of the king became clear in 1807 when George III's physical incapacitation prevented him from active engagement in foreign policy. Without royal support M&uuml;nster's suggestions and demands did not meet with approval from the British Foreign Office. M&uuml;nster himself described the time from 1807 to 1811 as a disappointing struggle against British lack of interest in Hanover. His plan for a military expedition to Hanover in 1809 was stopped by Viscount Castlereagh, secretary of state for war. The creation of the kingdom of Westphalia, which included parts of the electorate of Hanover, and the subsequent incorporation of the remaining Hanoverian territories into the French empire up to 1810 also passed without British protest.<br>
<br>There is much to suggest M&uuml;nster's disillusionment with British foreign policy. However, this period also saw M&uuml;nster's emergence as an important figure within the network of European &eacute;migr&eacute;s in London. He gained the role of mediator between British and continental politicians, particularly for the missions of the Prussian general Neidhard von Gneisenau and the former Hanoverian officer Ludwig Georg von Wallmoden. It was also during the period from 1807 to 1812 that M&uuml;nster actively engaged in the discussion about a future constitution for Germany, most notably in his correspondence with the Prussian minister in Russian service, Karl, Baron vom Stein. M&uuml;nster's position in this debate has been seen as both pragmatic and ambitious. He certainly aimed for a restoration of Hanover, including a territorial aggrandizement of the electorate. He also expressed anti-Prussian considerations, though these have been exaggerated. M&uuml;nster's plan for a future Germany was based on the restitution of the Holy Roman empire, with a naturally evolved constitution, while accepting the need for partial reform.<br>
<br>The defeat of Napoleon in Russia offered M&uuml;nster the chance to realize his political agenda. Without delay he prompted the Hanoverian ministers in Berlin and Vienna to engage in negotiations, a task of particular importance since diplomatic relations between the great European powers and Britain had been suspended for some years. M&uuml;nster's renewed diplomatic activity coincided with the start of the regency of George, prince of Wales, from whom he once more found royal support for his policies. M&uuml;nster's relationship with the future George IV was not as close as that he had enjoyed with the prince's father, but the strong support Hanover gained in the diplomatic negotiations between British politicians and European powers during the period 1813 to 1815 cannot be explained without acknowledging the regent's interest in his German electorate.<br>
<br>The congress of Vienna has been described as the climax of M&uuml;nster's career. Now closely associated with Lord Castlereagh, the British foreign secretary, who M&uuml;nster subsequently claimed had changed his mind about him and Hanover, he played an active part in the negotiations for the restoration of Europe. That this influence was not unlimited became apparent during the crisis over Saxony and Poland. M&uuml;nster's stay in Vienna appears to have been the most eventful time in his life. He mediated between the interests of the German power in the creation of the so-called federal act, the constitution of the German confederation, and convinced the prince regent after initial hesitation to accept Hanover's elevation from electorate to kingdom. On 7 November 1814 he married Countess Wilhelmine zu Schaumburg-Lippe (1783&#150;1858), with whom he had eight children, seven daughters and one son, George, Count M&uuml;nster, the future German ambassador to Paris and London. The regent rewarded him for his work at Vienna with the estate of Derneburg in the former episcopal state of Hildesheim, united with Hanover after the congress.<br>
<br>After 1815 M&uuml;nster's involvement in European diplomacy declined. He remained in his position in London but his political interests focused much more on internal Hanoverian affairs than they had done during the turbulent years of the Napoleonic wars. While M&uuml;nster embraced Austrian attempts to secure a reactionary policy in Germany during the years immediately after the congress of Vienna, not least at the notorious conference in Karlsbad (1819) and the second Vienna conference (1820), he subsequently pursued a political strategy that put him in opposition to the reactionary efforts of Austria and its powerful chancellor, Metternich. At the same time M&uuml;nster's approach brought him into conflict with the British government in its own struggle for power with the new king, George IV. German historians have accused M&uuml;nster of supporting the foreign secretary, George Canning, in favouring independence for Greece and for Spanish America, during the crisis over whether Metternich and other European ministers could continue to work with Canning in 1825. In contrast most British scholars have seen M&uuml;nster as an agent of George IV in opposing Canning and pursuing an absolutist line. Though there is evidence that M&uuml;nster and Canning kept in close contact, dining together on various occasions, there is equally strong evidence that the dynastic element played a crucial role in M&uuml;nster's understanding of politics at the time. Indeed the key aspect of M&uuml;nster's policy may be identified as his loyalty to the Hanoverian dynasty. This had already become evident during the Queen Caroline affair in 1820&#150;21, when M&uuml;nster gathered evidence for George IV's case against his wife. M&uuml;nster's close association with George IV was demonstrated again during the crisis over the regency in Hanover of Charles, duke of Brunswick, from 1826 to 1830, when only the king's intervention avoided a stand-off between the duke and M&uuml;nster.<br>
<br>The death of George IV in 1830 was the final turning point in M&uuml;nster's career. Since the congress of Vienna, and particularly after M&uuml;nster's interference in Hanoverian legislation in 1819, opposition had increased in Hanover to the &#145;minister on the moon&#146;, as M&uuml;nster was nicknamed due to his absence from the continent. In 1831 a pamphlet personified M&uuml;nster as the ultimate representation of absolutist tyranny. Though this was in many respects unjustified the new British monarch, William IV, bowed to pressure from Hanover, particularly from his brother Adolphus Frederick, and asked M&uuml;nster to resign. The Hanoverian minister left London in 1831 after twenty-six years in office. Though decorated with the newly created Hanoverian honorary office of <i>Erblandmarschall</i> and the British Order of the Bath, M&uuml;nster resented his forced departure. His time as an active participant in politics had passed and he lived at his country seat in Derneburg during the following years, only occasionally visiting the capital of Hanover. When Ernest Augustus, duke of Cumberland, succeeded William IV as king of Hanover in 1837, M&uuml;nster was once more expected to return to politics but the 71-year-old refrained from active engagement. He died at Derneburg on 20 May 1839 and was buried in the chapel there.<br>
