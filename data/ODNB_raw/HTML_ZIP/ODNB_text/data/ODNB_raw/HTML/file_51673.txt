<span class="headword">Brenchley,  Winifred Elsie</span>  (1883&#150;1953), <span class="occ">agricultural botanist</span>, was born on 10 August 1883 in London, the only child of William Brenchley, a Camberwell schoolmaster who was once mayor of the borough, and Elizabeth Beckett. She was educated at James Allen's Girls' School in Dulwich, at Swanley Horticultural College, and at University College, London, studying under Francis Oliver (1864&#150;1951), who became a lifelong friend. In 1906, she went to Rothamsted Experimental Station, Harpenden, Hertfordshire, as holder of the Gilchrist studentship for university women; in the following year she joined the permanent staff there as head of the botanical section (later botany department). She was the first woman scientist to be appointed at any agricultural institute in this country, and her arrival apparently caused some consternation among the Rothamsted establishment. Many years later it was reported that the widow of one of the founders (Sir Henry Gilbert) had declared, &#145;that woman had better not take tea with all those men&#151;she will have her tea with me&#146;  (private information). However, Brenchley did take tea with the men and before long her abilities put her on level terms with the best of them. She was awarded her DSc in 1911 and was made a fellow of University College in 1914.<br>
<br>In her early years at Rothamsted, Brenchley improved the technique for growing plants in water culture to a stage where it became a useful scientific tool. With this technique, she came very close to discovering the essential role of copper and zinc in plant nutrition, as her book <span class="italic">Inorganic Plant Poisons and Stimulants</span> (1914, revised 1927) shows. However, careful scientist as she was, in those days it was just not possible to reduce copper and zinc concentrations in water culture to levels low enough to restrict plant growth.<br>
<br>Brenchley's book <span class="italic">Weeds of Farmland</span> (1920) was the first comprehensive scientific study of weeds in this country, relating weed distribution to soil type. She showed that the seeds of certain arable weeds could retain their viability in soil for upwards of fifty years; her studies of rates of change in weed seed populations make her Britain's first quantitative weed ecologist. The last edition of her book with H. C. Long, <span class="italic">Suppression of Weeds by Fertilizers and Chemicals</span> (1949), was published just as the new selective organic weedkillers were being taken up by farmers, replacing inorganic horrors like sodium arsenite; no one was more aware of the need for less toxic and more selective herbicides than Brenchley. Another book, <span class="italic">Manuring of Grass Land for Hay</span> (1924), contains her published work on how lime and fertilizers affect the botanical composition of grasslands&#151;still a lively topic with ecologists. A bound copy of her collected papers (fifty-two in all) is in Rothamsted Library; her meticulously kept notebooks and a photograph of her at work are in the Rothamsted archives.<br>
<br>Brenchley was appointed OBE in 1948, the year of her retirement. She was a fellow of the Linnean Society and the Royal Entomological Society.<br>
<br>Aunt Winnie&#151;as she was known behind her back&#151;could be great fun at the right time, but once at work, with her hearing aid switched off (childhood measles had left her partially deaf), even directors hesitated to disturb her. Just and fair, she insisted that credit should go to whoever did the research, however junior or senior. Her principal hobby was gardening, as befits a botanist, but she also collected stamps, harvesting them from her many friends around the world. She was interested in insects and learned much about them from her good friend Augustus Imms (1880&#150;1949), an entomologist of distinction then working at Rothamsted. She never married.<br>
<br>With retirement, Brenchley returned to her garden and allotment with unrestrained vigour. She started to bring together the mountain of unpublished observations in her research notebooks but not long afterwards suffered a devastating stroke, from which she never recovered. She died at her home, 10 Clarence Road, Harpenden, Hertfordshire, on 27 October 1953. Talented botanist as she was, she is best remembered as the first woman in this country to break into the all male preserves of agricultural science.<br>
