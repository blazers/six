<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ogilvie, Sir  Frederick Wolff</span>  (1893&#150;1949), <span class="occ">economist and college head</span>, was born at Valpara&iacute;so, Chile, on 7 February 1893, the youngest son of William Maxwell Ogilvie, an engineer, and his wife, Mary Ann Wolff. The Ogilvies were Scots from Dundee. Ogilvie was educated at Clifton College and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he had a quiet university career, taking a first in classical moderations in 1913. His reading for <i>literae humaniores</i> was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War and within two days he was in the forces as a second lieutenant, 4th Bedfordshire regiment. He quickly found himself in France. In April 1915 he was seriously wounded at Hill 60, and lost his left arm; he remained in the army, however, until the end of the war, and was demobilized in 1919 with the rank of captain.<br>
<br>Ogilvie returned at once to Balliol and in the autumn of the same year became lecturer in economics at Trinity College, Oxford, being elected to a fellowship in 1920. Ogilvie married in 1922 Mary Helen (1900&#150;1990), eldest daughter of Alexander Beith Macaulay, professor of apologetics and systematic theology at Trinity College, Glasgow; they had three sons. In 1926 he was appointed to the chair of political economy in Edinburgh.<br>
<br>The interest in the study of economics which Ogilvie had shown from his early undergraduate days was due partly to a growing social sense, and in Oxford and Edinburgh he was a sympathetic teacher of the subject. At all times his quality as a teacher and friend of the young was enriched by his knowledge of music and his unrestrained enjoyment of the outdoor life. He was also invited to act as guide and mentor in economic matters to a group of younger, and later most distinguished, Conservative members of parliament. During these years his main interests within his subject proved to be the tourist industry of Great Britain and the economic problems of Scotland. His only book, <span class="italic">The Tourist Movement</span>, was published in 1933, and he later contributed on the subject to the new edition of <span class="italic">Chambers's Encyclopaedia</span>. He was a member of the Edinburgh chamber of commerce and of trade boards, and also concerned himself with adult education and juvenile employment in Scotland.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1934 Ogilvie left Edinburgh for Belfast, where he became president and vice-chancellor of the Queen's University. There he remained for four years, and left his mark in his own way. The university found in him a strength, integrity, and courtesy rarely combined in one person. He believed strongly in the value to a university of a wide social and cultural life, and he used his great personal charm and the persuasive impact of his own inner enjoyment of learning and the arts to very good purpose. He might well have been one of the great vice-chancellors, but in the summer of 1938 he was drawn away from the academic world to become the second director-general of the British Broadcasting Corporation in succession to Sir John Reith, who had guided its growth from the beginning and whose masterful single-mindedness had largely made it what it was.<br>
<br>In his memoirs Reith praised Ogilvie's personal charm, but added, &#145;I was quite sure he was not the man for the BBC&#146;  (Briggs, 2.637). Such indeed proved to be the case, the historian of the BBC describing Ogilvie's tenure of office as &#145;short, stormy and in some ways calamitous&#146;  (ibid.). The most insistent problems of Broadcasting House in wartime were organizational and administrative. The corporation emerged from the war in most remarkable esteem for its unremitting care for truth and for human sympathy throughout a remorseless struggle. But in order to play its part at all, triumphs of technical and administrative adjustment had to be achieved almost daily. This was not Ogilvie's sphere. Indeed, R. C. Norman, chairman of the BBC at the time of Ogilvie's appointment, later admitted that he had every quality &#145;except that of being able to manage a large organization, the one quality which was indispensable&#146;  (ibid., 2.638). Early in 1942 Ogilvie resigned. Though uncomplaining, he must have been deeply disappointed; but he secured notable personal success in performing special war duties for the British Council between 1943 and 1945.<br>
<br>At this time Ogilvie thought seriously of taking up editorial work in the national press, but in 1944 he became principal of Jesus College, Oxford. He was now fifty-one, and he had fewer than five more years to live; but in that short time he showed, as in Belfast, his great gifts for educational work in a university. His wide cultural contacts and his record of public service enabled him to give much to the college. By quietly infusing his own enjoyments and convictions into its way of life he made it a more friendly community, more enlightened, and more civilized. In 1948 he was grievously stricken by the death of his eldest son, James William Ogilvie, in a climbing accident on the Matterhorn, but he was a remarkable principal in the humane tradition.<br>
<br>In person Ogilvie was tall and fair, with grey eyes. His expression was serious and thoughtful, but a smile was never far away, for he was easily moved by friendship and his sense of humour was readily aroused. He was knighted in 1942 and died in London on 10 June 1949. Lady Ogilvie became in 1953 the principal of St Anne's College, Oxford. Their son Robert Maxwell Ogilvie became a fellow of Balliol in 1957.<br>
