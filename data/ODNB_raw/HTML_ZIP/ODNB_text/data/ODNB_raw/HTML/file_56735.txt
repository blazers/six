<span class="headword">Baxter, Sir  (Arthur) Beverley</span>  (1891&#150;1964), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born in Toronto, Canada, on 8 January 1891, the younger son and third of five children (plus an adopted son) of James Bennett Baxter, who worked in a wallpaper factory and served as a church organist and choir director, and his wife, Meribah Elizabeth Lawson, a pianist and vocal soloist. A boy alto in a fashionable church, he absorbed the family's Methodism, musicality, and strong British identity.<br>
<br>After leaving Harbord Collegiate Institute at fifteen Baxter rose quickly in the Nordheimer Piano and Music Company at a time when pianos were home entertainment centres and symbols of social status. By the beginning of the First World War he was sales manager, at the impressive salary of $3500 a year. After enlisting in 1915 as a lieutenant (signals) in the 122nd Canadian battalion he realized his boyhood dream when he arrived in England in April 1917. Sent to the front in March 1918, he contracted influenza (presumably &#145;Spanish&#146;) and was invalided back to England. By the time he recovered the war was over.<br>
<br>He yearned to be a writer, at which he had had some modest success, and the turning point in his life was meeting Lord Beaverbrook in 1919. At first Baxter declined the offer of a newspaper job but changed his mind and after a week as a reporter on the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> he was promoted to the editorial staff. In 1922 he became managing editor of the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span>, moving in 1924 to the same position at the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>. In December 1924 he married Edith Christina Letson (1898&#150;1988) of Vancouver, with whom he had a son and daughter. He became editor-in-chief of the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> in 1929. What impressed Beaverbrook about Baxter, in addition to talent and energy, was a passion equal to his own for integration of the British empire based on the programme of preferential tariffs earlier promoted by Joseph Chamberlain. Baxter was Beaverbrook's valued assistant in the empire free trade campaign from 1929 to 1931 and in the decade-long newspaper circulation war for readers and advertising revenue that was fought principally against Lord Rothermere's <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>.<br>
<br>Following Britain's abandonment of free trade, the Ottawa imperial trade agreements in 1932, and victory in the newspaper contest (the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> emerged with sales of over two million per day by 1933), Baxter sought a less demanding career than the exhilaration but relentless strain of working for Beaverbrook. In 1933 he became director of public relations for the Gaumont-British Picture Corporation and a board member of the film companies of Max Schach. In 1935 he returned to journalism as editorial adviser and writer for Allied Newspapers, owned by Lord Camrose and his brother Gomer Berry (Lord Kemsley from 1936); when the company was divided in 1937, Baxter went with the Kemsley papers. Working for the Berrys, who staunchly supported the Conservative leader and prime minister again from 1935, Stanley Baldwin, whom Beaverbrook despised, helped Baxter to secure election in 1935 as MP for the solidly Conservative constituency of Wood Green; after redistribution he represented the Southgate division from 1950 to his death.<br>
<br>Between 1936 and 1960 Baxter also wrote a regular &#145;London Letter&#146; in the fortnightly <span class="italic">Maclean's Magazine</span>, English Canada's only national publication. His theme was the mutual benefit of close relations between the two countries and of commonwealth unity for the British empire to remain a great world power. In peacetime he went on annual speaking tours of Canada (often including the United States) and occasionally gave radio talks on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.<br>
<br>Having concluded that the First World War was a tragedy and near disaster for Britain and the empire, Baxter was a vocal supporter of appeasement of Germany in the late 1930s. At the same time he was sceptical of Nazism and advocated rearmament and peacetime conscription for the defence of Britain. In May 1940, when Beaverbrook became minister for aircraft production on the formation of Winston Churchill's ministry, he overlooked their differences of recent years to appoint Baxter to stimulate morale in aeroplane factories. Soon Baxter was again writing for Beaverbrook's newspapers, including ten years from 1943 as drama critic. Until 1956 the voice of Baxter was practically that of Beaverbrook, including the latter's call after resigning from government at the beginning of 1942 for &#145;A Second Front Now&#146; and insinuations of the inadequacy of Churchill's leadership.<br>
<br>After 1945 Baxter criticized the Labour government's nationalization and welfare legislation, the acquiescence of the Conservative leaders in most of it, and the 1946 North American loan which he regarded as an American attempt to destroy the British empire. He also deplored the 1951 Churchill ministry's continuation of Labour's policies and its seeming indifference to imperial unity. In 1956 he was surprised and heartened by the military attempt of the prime minister, Sir Anthony Eden, to retake the Suez canal from Egypt. But on the eve of the invasion Baxter had decided that it was too late for a united British empire. He now believed that the colonies should become independent as soon as possible and that Britain, with some accommodation for the commonwealth, should find a new destiny as leader of the European Economic Union. This put him at odds with Beaverbrook, the 1957 Canadian Conservative government, and others who clung to Baxter's previous vision of the commonwealth and Britain as an overseas power. This difference from his natural friends largely accounts for his silence on controversial issues after 1957, though in his last years he suffered mental decline and at the end dementia. He died of a heart attack on 27 April 1964 in a nursing home, Whitehanger, in Fernhurst, Sussex.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Baxter had the great knack of knowing important and interesting people, which was greatly helped by being a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Beaverbrook. A fluent and urbane chronicler and commentator on politics and the arts, he wrote perceptive profiles of such leading figures as Churchill (whom he knew for forty years), Beaverbrook, Baldwin, Neville Chamberlain, Eden, and Harold Macmillan (his invalid roommate in the First World War), and vivid descriptions of such dramatic parliamentary occasions as the Munich debate, the declaration of the Second World War, the fall of Chamberlain's government, and the end of the war in Europe. His intimacy with Beaverbrook gave him much inside information, particularly during the Second World War. His articles, while not in the league of Harold Nicolson's diaries, are at least as informative and fascinating as those of his similar-minded fellow Conservative MP, Henry &#145;Chips&#146; Channon. As gratifying to Baxter as the knighthood which he received in 1954 must have been acknowledgement of his professional skill by election as a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1949.<br>
