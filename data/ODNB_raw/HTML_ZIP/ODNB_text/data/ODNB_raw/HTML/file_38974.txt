<span class="headword">Barbour,  John</span>  (1849&#150;1918), <span class="occ">clothing manufacturer</span>, was born on 9 March 1849 at Bogue Farm, Dalry, Kirkcudbrightshire, formerly part of the Lochinvar estate, one of twin sons of James Barbour (<i>d</i>. in or after 1871), a prosperous farmer, and his wife, Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Milroy (<i>d</i>. in or before 1871); his brother's name was James. Both his parents were Scottish, with ancestry traceable to the fourteenth century. Rejecting a career in farming Barbour left the south-west of Scotland at twenty to seek a living in the world of business, and within a year he and a cousin had established themselves as travelling drapers based in Newcastle upon Tyne. On 10 October 1871, at the Free Church manse in Dalry, he married Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1850/51), daughter of John Haining, minister. She was born on the island of Gigha, near the Mull of Kintyre, and had known Barbour since childhood; they settled in Newcastle. They had ten children, two of whom eventually followed their father into the family business. Suffering from poor health, Margaret was confined to bed for much of her married life.<br>
<br>While in Newcastle, Barbour established a mercantile enterprise and opened a shop in partnership with two other drapers. By 1890 he had amassed sufficient capital to establish his own firm, and moved to South Shields, where he began a tailoring business, aiming to establish an enduring enterprise in the town. Within two years his business had both expanded and become specialized in marketing protective oilskins and waxed wet-weather wear. In this Barbour not only drew upon his particular experience and expertise but also had identified an untapped segment of the clothing market. In 1894 his business, trading as J. Barbour &amp; Co.&#151;rather misleadingly described as &#145;Tailors and Drapers&#146;&#151;operated from premises in the town's market place. From the outset the garments sold by the business were unique, and have remained so. Durable, expensive, and carefully handmade, mainly by outside contractors in the early years, Barbour's products quickly established a reputation among the local fishing and sailing community for their effective protective qualities. It was the mail-order business, which Barbour's son Malcolm created in 1908, that generated booming business in the years before the First World War. The early catalogues reveal the diversity of the company's products, which included fashionable garments for both men and women as well as protective sporting and working clothes.<br>
<br>Barbour died on 9 July 1918, in Linden Avenue, Darlington, survived by his wife. Gradually the firm moved more extensively into manufacture, most rapidly after his death. His two eldest sons, John and Malcolm, carried on the business, though during the depressed years of the 1920s it faltered, and John resigned. Malcolm, who in any case had been responsible for much of the enterprise's early expansion, took the business to a period of renewed success. The profitability of J. Barbour &amp; Sons Ltd was sustained during the remainder of the twentieth century and into the next, under the leadership of successive generations of Barbours, as its traditional market among outdoor workers was supplemented by demand from the wealthier social groups for robust yet attractive outdoor country wear. The dark-green Barbour wax jacket with its characteristic large toothed metal zip&#151;as well as a range of accoutrements&#151;achieved symbolic status as it became standard garb for the rich at play.<br>
