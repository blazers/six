<span class="headword">Ridley, Sir  Matthew White</span>, second baronet  (1745&#150;1813), <span class="occ">land and coal owner and politician</span>, was born on 28 October 1745 in Newcastle upon Tyne, the second of the twelve children of Matthew Ridley (1711&#150;1778) of Heaton Hall and Newcastle, a landowner, coal magnate, and MP, though the eldest of Ridley's second wife, his first cousin Elizabeth (1722&#150;1764), the daughter of Matthew White (1690&#150;1750) of Blagdon. He had seven brothers and four sisters. He was educated at Newcastle Free School and Westminster School, and then went to Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 27 February 1764. At the age of seventeen he succeeded to the baronetcy of his maternal uncle, Sir Matthew White (1727&#150;1763) of Blagdon.<br>
<br>Ridley was born into one of the dominant families of north-east England, and inherited a substantial landed estate in the south-east of Northumberland, lucrative investments in the coal, glass, and brewing industries, and an unassailable electoral interest in Newcastle upon Tyne. His family's pre-eminence dated from the later seventeenth century, when two Newcastle merchants, Nicholas Ridley (<i>d</i>. 1712) and Matthew White (<i>d</i>. 1716), began to invest heavily in the coal trade on the north bank of the Tyne, opening up collieries at Blaydon, Willington, Benton, Byker, Heaton, and Jesmond. Their effective business partnership was strengthened by the marriage of Nicholas Ridley's eldest son, Richard (1677&#150;1739), to Matthew White's daughter Margaret, the first of a series of marriage alliances that left Sir Matthew White Ridley as the eventual heir to both families and both fortunes.<br>
<br>The steady growth of these fortunes was marked by the extension of their landed interests. Matthew White acquired the Blagdon estate to the north of the city in the 1690s, while his successors were able to take advantage of the forfeitures that followed the 1715 rebellion by purchasing the Heaton estate in 1719, followed in 1723 by the Newsham and Plessey estates further north on the Northumberland coast, which brought them effective control of the port of Blyth. These joint purchases allowed both families to construct substantial country seats, but their main importance lay in the commercial benefits to be gained from the valuable coal reserves that lay beneath the surface. In these early stages at least, agricultural rents made a relatively small contribution to the Ridleys' wealth: in fact both Matthew Ridley and Matthew White were chronically short of money in the 1740s, and borrowed heavily on the security of their land in order to develop their mining interests. It was the coal trade that supported their other business ventures, just as it supported the Ridleys' growing political influence.<br>
<br>This influence owed a great deal to Sir Matthew White Ridley's grandfather, Richard Ridley, who had built up a powerful body of support within Newcastle's entrenched and increasingly exclusive magistracy. Successive royal charters had contributed to placing complete control of the town in the hands of an oligarchy drawn from the Merchant Adventurers' Company, an oligarchy which safeguarded its members' economic interests by a virtual monopoly of places on the aldermanic bench. In a town which depended so completely on the coal trade, economic power and political influence went hand in hand: thus a politician who could summon sixty men on horseback and more than 300 on foot from among his own workforce to quell a demonstration against high food prices, as Matthew Ridley (Matthew White Ridley's father) did in 1740, was bound to win the support of his fellow magistrates. He was equally likely, however, to provoke hostility among the wider freeman electorate, and it took some time for Matthew Ridley to live down his father's reputation as &#145;the Terror of the Town&#146;  (Chicken, 4) and to build up a more broadly based electoral interest.<br>
<br>Although Sir Matthew White Ridley had been elected as MP for Morpeth in 1768, his political career began in earnest in 1774 when his father's declining health propelled him on to Newcastle's aldermanic bench and thence into the mayoralty and the parliamentary seat which his father had held unopposed since 1747, and which he was to hand on to his eldest son in 1812. In 1778 he succeeded his father as governor of the Merchant Adventurers' Company, another nominally elective position which in practice had become part of his family's patrimony, having been held by successive generations since 1715. In all these offices he followed family tradition by consistently representing the interests of the town's ruling oligarchy against those of &#145;the leather aprons&#146; or &#145;raggamuffins&#146;, and he was equally consistent in his opposition to parliamentary reform. His electoral appeal outside the charmed circle of Newcastle's magistracy seems to have rested partly on tradition but mainly on his dominant position in the constituency's staple industry: an election song dating from 1784 made this abundantly clear by its crude but effective coupling of<blockquote>
<div>Brandling for ever and Ridley for aye,<br>
</div>
<div>There's plenty of coals on our waggon way.<br>
</div> (Knox, &#145;Peace&#146;, 19)</blockquote>In the Commons Ridley frequently voted with the whig opposition, but is best described as an independent; he took his own line on the main issues of the day, and intervened mainly to represent what he regarded as the best interests of his constituents.<br>
<br>Ridley portrayed himself in his correspondence and relatively infrequent speeches as a typical, plain-spoken, independent-minded country gentleman, and in some senses his background and education had prepared him for a conventional role in the landed gentry. Few county families, however, combined the quasi-feudal power of the Ridleys over their Newcastle fiefdom with the shrewd business sense that allowed each successive generation not simply to maintain their industrial inheritance but also to move into new and potentially lucrative areas of enterprise. Just as his father had reacted to the gradual decline of the Tyneside salt industry by diversifying into glass making, brewing, and tile making, so Ridley gradually extended his business interests into banking, insurance, and public utilities. In 1787, on the retirement of Ralph Carr, he became the leading partner in Newcastle's Old Bank, an investment which was not only profitable in itself but which allowed him to channel his own business through the bank free of charge. Within a few years the Old Bank had combined with one of its local rivals to establish an insurance company, the Newcastle Fire Office, which in 1797 acquired and extended the city's original waterworks, mainly in the interests of providing an adequate supply of water to protect the properties which it insured. In 1805 Ridley became a director of the Globe Insurance Company, drawing a salary of &pound;150 a year, and in the later years of his life he acquired a portfolio of minor investments in transport improvements and government securities. His main sources of income, however, were still derived from the White and Ridley families' extensive holdings in the coal industry, from his partnership in the Northumberland Broad and Crown Glass Company, and from the Heaton and Blagdon estates.<br>
<br>Ridley married Sarah Colborne (<i>d</i>. 1806), the daughter and eventual heir of Benjamin Colborne of Bath, on 12 July 1777; they had five sons and one daughter. Sarah was described in 1778 as &#145;not the Pink of Gentility but very good humoured&#146;  (Elwin, 119), and it is to be hoped that she was also tolerant, since her husband was allegedly irresistible to women. In 1793 he was ordered to pay &pound;400 in damages to one of his constituents after being caught <i>in flagrante delicto</i> with the latter's wife on the staircase of their house in Newcastle, a misfortune which seems to have had little effect on his local reputation for &#145;urbanity of manners and a most endearing condescension in his general intercourse with society&#146;  (Northumberland Record Office, ZRI 52/6). He died on 9 April 1813 in Portland Place, London, after a long illness, and was succeeded as third baronet by his eldest son, also Matthew White Ridley (1778&#150;1836).<br>
