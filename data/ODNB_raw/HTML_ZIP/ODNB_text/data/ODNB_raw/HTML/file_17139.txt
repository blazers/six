<span class="headword">Lucas,  Samuel</span>  (1811&#150;1865), <span class="occ">journalist and educational reformer</span>, was the eldest son of Samuel Hayhurst Lucas, a Quaker corn merchant of Wandsworth, Surrey. His younger brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17127/', "Frederick Lucas")</script>, who converted to Roman Catholicism and founded <span class="italic">The Tablet</span>; Samuel, by contrast, remained a Quaker all his life, and opposition to the established church was a steady theme throughout his career. His childhood and early adult years were spent in Surrey and in London. On 6 September 1839 he married Margaret Bright (1818&#150;1890) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17135/', "Lucas, Margaret Bright")</script>], daughter of Jacob Bright and sister of John Bright, of the Anti-Corn Law League. In 1845 they moved to Manchester, where Lucas became a partner in a cotton mill. He was involved in the later campaigns of the Anti-Corn Law League, having been active from 1844 in the Anti-State Church Association (from 1853 the Society for the Liberation of Religion from State Patronage and Control).<br>
<br>In August 1847 Lucas became one of the six veterans of the anti-cornlaw campaign who founded the Lancashire Public Schools Association (LPSA), which was organized along similar lines to the league, and used petitioning and pamphleteering as its chief campaign tools. Lucas chaired the LPSA committee, in which capacity, according to his colleague J. Alfred Steinthal, he demonstrated his &#145;sweet temper&#146; and &#145;rare tact and judgement&#146;, most notably in smoothing differences arising from divergences in religious outlook  (Jones, 38). Lucas's <span class="italic">Plan for the Establishment of a General System of Secular Education in the County of Lancaster</span> (1847), written on behalf of the LPSA, advocated a decentralized scheme of public schools' administration similar to that which operated in Massachusetts. From June 1849 he edited a journal, the <span class="italic">Education Register</span>, which ran until early the following year. In August 1849 he returned to London, where he set up in business as a corn merchant.<br>
<br>Late in 1849 the LPSA changed its name to the National Public Schools Association (NPSA), having recruited Richard Cobden as a powerful advocate. Lucas continued to be active in the cause: in 1850 he edited a collection of essays entitled <span class="italic">National Education not Necessarily Governmental, Sectarian or Irreligious</span>. His anxiety to keep the NPSA firmly to a secularist path led him to oppose compromise with religious bodies and occasionally placed him at odds with Cobden. He was frustrated by the indifference or hostility that met NPSA proposals in the House of Commons, and, dissatisfied at coverage in the mainstream press, in August 1853 he started the <span class="italic">Advocate for National Instruction</span>, which ran for four issues. More significantly, from the summer of 1857 until his death Lucas served as editor of the <span class="italic">Morning Star</span>, the radical newspaper started by Cobden and Bright in March 1856. As an &#145;active managing partner&#146;, with a financial stake in the paper  (Koss, 126), he was successful at bringing in Justin McCarthy and Edmund Yates as contributors, and was involved in the takeover of the <span class="italic">People's Charter</span> and <span class="italic">The Dial</span>. Lucas was active in the Association for the Repeal of Taxes on Knowledge, particularly at the time of the House of Lords' rejection of Gladstone's attempt to repeal the paper duty in 1860. During the American Civil War he was a prominent supporter of the North, helping to found the Emancipation Society, which opposed slavery, in 1862.<br>
<br>Lucas died from a bronchial illness at 4 Gordon Street, Gordon Square, London, on 16 April 1865, and was buried in Highgate cemetery in north London. Many of the proposals contained in his 1847 <span class="italic">Plan</span> subsequently found their way onto the statute book in the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1870.<br>
