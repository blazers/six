<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Simpson, Sir  James</span>  (1792&#150;1868), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born in Edinburgh, was the son of David Simpson of Teviotbank, Roxburghshire, and his wife, Mary, daughter of John Eliott of Borthwickbrae and grandson of the Revd James Simpson, minister of Wilton, Scotland. Educated at the University of Edinburgh (<i>c</i>.1808&#150;1810), he was commissioned as ensign and lieutenant in the 1st (Grenadier) guards on 3 April 1811. Throughout his career he was the tallest officer in the British army. In 1812 he was sent to Spain, and served there in the 3rd battalion from May 1812 to May 1813. He took part in the defence of Cadiz and relief of Seville, and, joining Wellington's army in the autumn at Salamanca, shared in the retreat from Burgos. He subsequently served with the 2nd battalion in the campaign of 1815, and was severely wounded at Quatre Bras.<br>
<br>Simpson became lieutenant and captain on 25 December 1813, and was made adjutant on 8 February 1821. He was promoted captain and lieutenant-colonel on 28 April 1825, went on half pay soon afterwards, and was made lieutenant-colonel of the 29th regiment on 10 June 1826. He took his regiment to Mauritius, and remained there with it until 1837, when it returned to England. On 28 June 1838 he became colonel in the army. In 1839 he married Elizabeth, second daughter of Sir Robert Dundas, bt, of Beechwood, Midlothian. She died in 1840.<br>
<br>Simpson exchanged to half pay in 1839, but returned to the command of the 29th in 1842, and took the regiment to Bengal. He was soon appointed to take charge of the Benares division, and in 1845 was sent to Sind to act as second in command to Sir Charles Napier in his operations against the hillmen of Kachhi. He led the column which advanced up the Teyaga to Dera, and, when the whole force had united there, took part in the movements which led to the final submission of the tribes. He was &#145;an officer peculiarly exact in following his instructions&#146;  (Napier, 202).<br>
<br>Simpson returned to England in 1846, went on half pay from the 29th on 8 December, and was made commandant at Chatham. He was promoted major-general on 11 November 1851 and to the command of the south-west district. In February 1855 he was sent out to the Crimea, with the local rank of lieutenant-general, as chief of the staff. The new war minister, Lord Panmure, especially ordered him to report on the standard of the officers in the Eastern Army. He landed at Balaklava on 15 March, and on 26 April he reported that, though he had come out with some degree of prejudice, he found that there was none he would want removed, and did not think a better selection of staff officers could be made.<br>
<br>On Lord Raglan's death on 28 June 1855, Simpson succeeded to the command of the British troops as senior officer, and was confirmed in that post. He was given the rank of lieutenant-general, and of local general, from that date. The feeling in the army was that he was &#145;a good man, a long-headed Scotchman&#146;, but hardly equal to so great a responsibility. On 8 September the final assault on Sevastopol was delivered by the French on the Malakhov, and by the British on the Redan. The arrangements for the latter were unsatisfactory. Simpson had chosen the second and light divisions, but these contained many raw recruits. The assaulting column of 1000 men, preceded by a covering party of 200 and a ladder party of 320, and followed by an armed working party of 200, reached the Redan, but the men lost all cohesion in their advance, and many in their confusion would not follow their officers inside the work. The first supports, amounting to 1500, joined them, but did not press the attack. Further supports from the remainder of the two divisions and other troops did not come forward. Simpson afterwards wrote that, because the trenches were so crowded after this attack, he was unable to organize a second assault using the highlanders. The French capture of the Malakhov secured the fall of Sevastopol. P&eacute;lissier, in his joy, embraced Simpson and kissed him. &#145;It was a great occasion,&#146; Simpson said, &#145;and I couldna' resist him.&#146; Simpson was promoted general from 8 September 1855, received the GCB on 16 October, and was given the colonelcy of the 87th regiment.<br>
<br>In October further successes were obtained at Kinburn and Eupatoria, but the main Russian army remained strongly posted to the north of the Chernaya and the harbour. The British government was impatient to see it driven out of the Crimea, but the allied commanders were finding it difficult to agree on concerted action. Simpson determined to resign a command which he had accepted with hesitation and for which he felt ill-equipped. On 10 November 1855 he handed it over to Sir William Codrington. He received the grand cross of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur and of the military order of Savoy, and the Mejidiye (first class).<br>
<br>Simpson was made colonel of his former regiment, the 29th, instead of the 87th, on 27 July 1863. He passed the rest of his life in retirement, and died at his home at Horringer, near Bury St Edmunds, on 18 April 1868.<br>
