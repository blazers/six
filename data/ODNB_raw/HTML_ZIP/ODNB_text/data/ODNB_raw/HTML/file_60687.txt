<span class="headword">Haschenperg,  Stephen  von</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1535&#150;1547), <span class="occ">military engineer</span>, was a native of Moravia, who probably followed Mary of Hungary to the Netherlands when she became regent there for her brother, the emperor Charles V, in 1531. He is first recorded in an English context in 1535, when he offered his services to Thomas Cromwell as &#145;armourer and architect&#146; (&#145;pro armamentario et architecto&#146;; TNA: PRO, SP 1/100, 60), having first approached the duke of Suffolk. He was not then employed, but cannot have been entirely rebuffed, for around 12 April 1539 he wrote again to Cromwell, from Deal in Kent, in terms suggesting both that he was an intelligence agent for the secretary, and also, since he claimed to be able to understand the speech of Polish sailors, that he knew eastern Europe and the Baltic.<br>
<br>More certainly, however, the threat of foreign invasion in 1539 had by now led to Haschenperg's finding employment in England, at first on the south-east coast. In 1539&#150;40 he undertook works at Sandgate and Camber castles, devising fortifications of considerable, indeed unnecessary, complexity. With their concentric defences and use of bastions they were among the earliest English fortifications to show a knowledge of Italian innovations in military design, though Haschenperg, who seems to have been a land surveyor by training, may not in fact have fully understood the significance of the models he imitated. Hence, for instance, his repeated tendency to leave dead ground in front of his defences. His technical weaknesses were not appreciated at first, however, and he was granted an annuity of &pound;60 in 1539, raised to &pound;75 in July 1540. Then in November 1540 he was sent to Calais, to survey its defences and prepare a plan for their strengthening.<br>
<br>Having returned to England, Haschenperg went north shortly afterwards. At Berwick with the duke of Norfolk in January 1541, by June he was at Carlisle, where substantial works on the defences of both castle and city were in progress. Perhaps he was here executing works planned by others rather than a programme of his own devising, a possibility that could explain why he achieved more of lasting utility at Carlisle than elsewhere. Haschenperg was responsible for strengthening the castle so that it could carry more guns, for building an elaborate half-moon battery to protect its inner ward and bulwarks to act as outworks, and for at least beginning a citadel designed to command the city from its southern end. Nevertheless, he soon ran into difficulties, at least some of them apparently of his own making. He had begun his time at Carlisle with quarrels, with his colleague Thomas Gower, who was sent to Berwick, and with the captain of the castle, Sir Thomas Wentworth, who was ordered to &#145;use himself more temperately&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 16, no. 958). By the end of 1542 the progress of the works was giving rise to concern. The march warden and the bishop of Carlisle were ordered to inspect them, and in the following July Haschenperg was dismissed, on the grounds that he had &#145;behaved lewdly and spent great treasure to no purpose&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 18/1, no. 901). Perhaps his lack of qualifications had caught up with him, though he did not help his own cause by his disrespectful bearing towards the king's council.<br>
<br>Haschenperg left England in 1543, subsequently forfeiting property at West Ham, Essex, and went to the Baltic; on his return in 1544 he persuaded Mary of Hungary to write to Henry VIII on his behalf. He himself then approached Henry's agent in Brussels with offers of intelligence concerning Scots who were recruiting soldiers in Denmark, but received a cool reception, as one who &#145;will pretend more knowledge than he hath indeed&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 19/2, no. 132). On 4 August 1545 he wrote to Henry from L&uuml;beck, lamenting his loss of favour and offering to put a number of useful inventions at the king's disposal, for instance a method of making saltpetre; he also showed that he had at some point been at Nonsuch Palace, possibly to work on its water supply, while he referred to the evangelical princes of Germany in terms suggesting that he was himself of their religious persuasion. Later that year he returned to London, hoping to enlist the support of the duke of Suffolk, but his expedition was in vain&#151;the duke died that year&#151;and he returned to &#145;Oestlandt&#146;. In January 1547 he was back in London, this time with his (unnamed) wife, trying to persuade the imperial ambassador to speak up for him. The latter was unenthusiastic, and seems to have been correct in believing that Haschenperg &#145;will only find a refusal here to his petition&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1547&#150;9</i>, 1), for he makes no further appearance in English records, and it is not known when or where he died.<br>
