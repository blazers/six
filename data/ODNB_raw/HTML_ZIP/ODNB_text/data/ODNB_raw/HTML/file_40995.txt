<span class="headword">Beresford,  John Davys</span>  (1873&#150;1947), <span class="occ">novelist and essayist</span>, was born on 7 March 1873 at the rectory, Castor, Northamptonshire, to an evangelically minded couple, the Revd John James Beresford (1822&#150;1897), a Church of England clergyman, and his wife, Adelaide Elizabeth Morgan (<i>b</i>. 1836), of Welsh extraction. J. D., as he was known, was doted on by his mother, especially after, owing to the neglect of a nurse, he suffered the trauma of infantile paralysis at three and a half and was left permanently lame. His rather ascetic father viewed this affliction of his second son as an embarrassment and consequently neglected J. D.'s education, which he himself recalled as &#145;a very haphazard affair&#146;. He did attend various schools, including Oundle in 1886 and notably the Peterborough King's School in 1887&#150;9, but had no particular ambitions.<br>
<br>At sixteen Beresford lackadaisically accepted his father's suggestion that he become an architect, and for eight years he slaved as a draughtsman in London. At twenty-one he experienced a &#145;conversion&#146; from religious orthodoxy to independent thinking and evolutionism. By 1901 he was making &#145;spasmodic efforts to write short stories&#146;; another turning point occurred in 1903 when he read <span class="italic">Human Personality and its Survival of Bodily Death</span> (1903), a book by the psychical researcher F. W. H. Myers that sparked Beresford's fascination with abnormal psychology and led him to adopt permanently an idealist position. During that year he also married Linda Lawrence, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brown (1872&#150;1917), a former actress, though the marriage lasted only until about 1907 owing to his wife's infidelity and the couple's financial distress. However, in 1907 his fortunes improved when he began a long career as a reviewer, initially with the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span> and later with the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. He also began to publish idealistic short stories.<br>
<br>Beresford first achieved critical acclaim in 1911 with the publication of two novels indicative of two trends in his novel writing. <span class="italic">The Early History of Jacob Stahl</span> is an autobiographical <i>Bildungsroman</i> that deepens realism in the manner of Wells and Bennett by attending to unconscious motivation and the spiritual quest of the protagonist. The reviewers lauded it, along with the two other volumes, <span class="italic">A Candidate for Truth</span> (1912) and <span class="italic">The Invisible Event</span> (1915), comprising a trilogy, as a psychological masterpiece, and this acclaim placed him in the forefront of modern novelists. Beresford penned another thirty-seven novels in this vein of realism, notably <span class="italic">The House in Demetrius Road</span> (1914), <span class="italic">The Monkey Puzzle</span> (1925), <span class="italic">Seven, Bobsworth</span> (1930), and <span class="italic">Cleo</span> (1937). After about 1924 these novels became increasingly concerned with the mystical awakenings of his protagonists.<br>
<br>Beresford's other novel of 1911, <span class="italic">The Hampdenshire Wonder</span>, is a speculative narrative, the first novel to consider seriously the consequences of an individual's reaching a higher evolutionary stage than his contemporaries. It earned the praise of the likes of G. B. Shaw and has since become an influential classic of scientific romance. Beresford gave play to this speculative aspect of his vision sporadically during his career, most notably in <span class="italic">Revolution</span> (1921), <span class="italic">What Dreams May Come</span> (1941), and <span class="italic">The Riddle of the Tower</span> (1944), but also in brief whimsical short stories, especially those collected in <span class="italic">Nineteen Impressions</span> (1918) and <span class="italic">Signs and Wonders</span> (1921).<br>
<br>Beresford's early successes drew him from the fringe into neo-Georgian literary circles, and he formed friendships with other writers including H. G. Wells, Dorothy Richardson, Katherine Mansfield, and especially Walter de la Mare. In May 1913 he married Beatrice Evelyn (Trissie) Roskams (1880&#150;1975), boarding-house keeper, with whom he had four children, two of whom, Marcus (pseudonym Marc Brandel) (1919&#150;2010) and Elisabeth (1926&#150;2010) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/102520/', "Beresford, (Beatrice) Elisabeth")</script>], became professional writers. From 1923 to 1927 the family sojourned in France, and in 1931 they settled in Brighton. By this time Beresford's marriage had begun to deteriorate, partly because of his increasing interest in unorthodox spiritual beliefs such as faith-healing, an interest not shared by his conventionally religious wife. In 1937 he met Esm&eacute; Wynne-Tyson, a writer on a similar spiritual quest, and in 1939 they began a fruitful collaboration, eventually totalling eleven books. In that year Beresford separated from his wife and he and Wynne-Tyson maintained a platonic relationship while living in a series of vegetarian guest houses. At one of these, Kildare, in Sydney Gardens, Bath, he suffered a stroke, and he died there in his sleep a week later, on 2 February 1947.<br>
<br>Since then Beresford has been almost completely neglected, but at the height of his fame in the mid-twenties he was considered by Frank Swinnerton and others as one of the most reflective lights, along with E. M. Forster, of the younger generation of Georgian realists, and the &#145;intellectual&#146; among them. However, his goal to illustrate in fiction his fundamental principles, such as the spiritual rather than material nature of the universe, occasionally caused him to be overly didactic and practically guaranteed that he would never be a popular writer. This goal prompted him to eschew modernist experimentation, and that position lost him critical acclaim in the latter part of his career.<br>
<br>Beresford deserves attention for several reasons. He was one of the first and most knowledgeable of English novelists to explore in his fiction the &#145;new&#146; dynamic psychologies of F. W. H. Myers, Henri Bergson, Freud, and Jung. His <span class="italic">God's Counterpoint</span> (1918) represents an early foray into the explicitly psychoanalytic novel. In several critical essays he articulated more clearly than his contemporaries the strengths and limitations of the use of the new psychology in fiction. He dealt equally perceptively with a number of other unpopular advanced ideas, some of which have since gained acceptability, including pacifism, vegetarianism, and faith-healing. His speculative novels remain particularly relevant because of their depiction of societies based on co-operative principles and their espousal of pacifism.<br>
<br>Beresford's life was often unsettled: he suffered from a sense of dividedness, and he was frequently harried by financial anxiety. Yet those who knew him commented most often on his gentleness, tolerance, compassion, kindness, and loyalty to friends, qualities buoyed by a wry sense of humour. He was intensely self-conscious, a quality he believed hampered his writing, despite his handsome appearance: he stood a full 6 feet tall, had an athletic physique, a face striking for its suggestion of deep contemplation, and piercing blue eyes.<br>
