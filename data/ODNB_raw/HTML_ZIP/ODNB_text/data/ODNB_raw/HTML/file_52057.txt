<span class="headword">Frame, Sir  Alexander Gilchrist <span class="st"> [Alistair]</span></span>  (1929&#150;1993), <span class="occ">engineer and businessman</span>, was born on 3 April 1929 at 16 Burns Street, Dalmuir, Dunbartonshire, Scotland, the eldest son in the family of four children of Alexander Frame, industrial chemist, and his wife, Mary Gilchrist, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fraser. Known throughout his life as Alistair, he was educated at Broxburn high school, graduated from Glasgow Technical College with a first-class degree, and won a Shell scholarship to Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, to read chemical engineering. He graduated with an upper second-class degree in 1952. On 27 June 1953 he married Sheila Isabel Dingwall Mathieson (<i>b</i>. 1927/8), shorthand typist and daughter of Thomas Barclay Mathieson, electrical engineer; they had one daughter.<br>
<br>Frame joined the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) in 1954 in Risley, Cheshire, where Sir Christopher Hinton was head of the atomic energy production division. At this time the government decided to set up a fast-breeder research programme at Dounreay, on the north coast of Scotland, to see whether fast-breeder reactors were a suitable power source for generating electricity. The Dounreay fast reactor was functioning by 1959, and Frame became director of the UKAEA reactor and research group in 1964. He was in charge of building Britain's first prototype fast reactor at Dounreay, where work began in 1966: this was supplying electricity to the national grid from 1975.<br>
<br>In 1968 Frame was appointed chief engineer of Rio Tinto-Zinc Corporation Ltd (RTZ), the international group of mining companies formed in 1962 out of the merger of the Rio Tinto Company and Consolidated Zinc. The chairman, Sir Val Duncan, put him in charge of the building of a nuclear power station linked to an aluminium smelter at Holyhead, Anglesey, a project approved and subsidized by the government, which wanted Britain to build up its own aluminium industry. Frame demonstrated his ability to pick a team of engineers and managers of the highest calibre, and showed that he could meet deadlines, and move a large-scale project forwards. The smelter was completed on time, and under cost.<br>
<br>Frame's next project was the channel tunnel. He was appointed managing director of Rio Tinto-Zinc Development Enterprises Ltd (RTZ-DE), formed by RTZ to be responsible for the planning, financing, and construction of large-scale projects worldwide. RTZ-DE was appointed project manager by the British Channel Tunnel Company, in which RTZ held 20 per cent of the shares, in 1971, and was given the responsibility for carrying out new studies on the feasibility of constructing a tunnel under the English Channel. Frame took expert advice on tunnel design and construction, estimated the cost and time-scale of the project and its economic benefits, and proposed a new route for the tunnel on the British side, which would shorten its length by 2 miles, save &pound;7 million in construction costs, and reduce the annual operating costs by &pound;300,000. During the two years of the study Frame built up a close rapport with his French counterpart, Jean Gabriel, project director of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Fran&ccedil;aise du Tunnel sous la Manche. On the basis of his final report to the government in June 1973, the government decided to go ahead. By the end of the year a bill had passed through parliament; an agreement between the British and French governments and the tunnel companies had been signed (the English signatories were Frame and Lord Harcourt, chairman of the British Channel Tunnel Company) in which they agreed to construct the initial tunnel works, 2 kilometres of pilot tunnel from both the British and French coasts, to be completed by the middle of 1975; and the British foreign secretary and French foreign minister had signed a treaty. Work began on both sides of the channel at the end of 1973, with Frame, newly elected to the board of RTZ, in charge of the management of the channel tunnel project on the English side. Following the defeat of the Conservative government in the February 1974 general election, and the death of the French president, Georges Pompidou, in April of the same year, the channel tunnel project was cancelled by the new Labour government, as an unnecessary use of public money, in January 1975. It was revived by the Conservative government in 1982, and the tunnel that opened in 1994 followed the RTZ design. Frame joined the board of Eurotunnel in 1990.<br>
<br>Frame was appointed RTZ's first technical director in 1975, and was chief executive and deputy chairman from 1978 to 1985. Knighted in 1981, he succeeded Sir Anthony Tuke as chairman of RTZ in 1985, at a time when the company was under fire for stripping valuable resources from Namibia, where it had been operating a uranium mine at Rossing since the late 1960s. As chairman Frame oversaw the company's expansion in other directions, including investment in the oil and gas industries, at the same time acquiring interests in many of the world's major mineral deposits. His greatest success was the acquisition in 1989 of British Petroleum's mineral interests, including Kennecott, the large American copper company. This made RTZ the world's largest mining company. Nevertheless he wanted it to be seen as a diversified industrial company rather than a mining finance house; this would have the added benefit of diverting attention from its involvement in politically sensitive areas. Frame resigned as chairman in 1991, but was asked to remain as a non-executive director.<br>
<br>Frame was chairman of the Council of Mining and Metallurgical Industries from 1983; he was appointed an honorary fellow of Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, in 1985, and awarded an honorary DSc from the University of Glasgow in 1990. He helped to found the Major Projects Organization for the development and exchange of ideas at Templeton College, Oxford. He became chairman of the CBI National Manufacturing Council in 1992, of Wellcome in 1992, and of British Steel in 1993, but had to resign after a few months because of ill health. He died of bronchopneumonia and aortic stenosis, at his home, Pine Cottage, Church Hill, Holmbury St Mary, Dorking, Surrey, on 26 December 1993. He was survived by his wife and daughter. His funeral was on 6 January 1994 at Holmbury St Mary parish church and a memorial service was held at St Paul's, Knightsbridge, on 25 March 1994.<br>
