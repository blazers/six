<span class="headword">Poole,  George Ayliffe</span>  (1809&#150;1883), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge (BA 1831, MA 1838). He was ordained in 1832, and was curate successively of Twickenham; St John the Evangelist, Edinburgh; and St Chad's, Shrewsbury. On 16 March 1839 he was appointed perpetual curate of St James's, Leeds; in 1843 he was presented to the vicarage of Welford, Northamptonshire, which he held until his presentation to the rectory of Winwick, near Rugby, by the bishop of Peterborough in 1876. Here he acted for a few years as rural dean of the district. He married Susanna, a daughter of Jonathan Wilks of St Ann's, Burley.<br>
<br>Poole was a prolific writer, publishing volumes on a wide variety of subjects. But the main work of his life was the promotion of the revival of Gothic architecture, and this constituted the most significant portion of his literary output. His most substantial work on this subject was <span class="italic">A History of Ecclesiastical Architecture in England</span> (1848), a detailed and scholarly account of its subject. He also published <span class="italic">Churches: their Structure, Arrangement and Decoration</span> (1845)&#151;originally issued in 1842 as <span class="italic">The Appropriate Character of Church Architecture</span>&#151;a more popular attempt to stimulate interest in the furnishing of churches. In 1840 he had been an early advocate of what he argued was a more reverential approach to this subject in <span class="italic">The Anglo-Catholic Use of Two Lights upon the Altar, for the Signification that Christ is the Very True Light of the World, Stated and Defended</span>. He also composed many minor works on particular churches, such as <span class="italic">An Historical and Descriptive Guide to York Cathedral</span> (1850), and on the ecclesiastical buildings of a particular area, such as <span class="italic">Churches of Yorkshire</span> (1842).<br>
<br>Poole was a traditional high-churchman and an admirer of W. F. Hook, vicar of Leeds, and his writings on the various church parties of the day are of some significance, especially as revealing his attitude to the Oxford Movement. While comments on this subject pervade many of his works, the most developed exposition of his position is to be found in <span class="italic">On the Present State of Parties in the Church of England: with Especial Reference to the Alleged Tendency of the Oxford School to the Doctrines and Communion of Rome</span> (1841), written in the wake of Froude's <span class="italic">Remains</span> and <span class="roman">Tract 90</span>. In this Poole reveals the ambivalent attitude of his school to the Tractarians. On the one hand he is sympathetic to the aims of the movement, especially as enunciated in the earlier tracts; on the other he is critical of their dislike of the links between church and state, and of their low opinion of the Reformers. By 1841 Poole was attempting to warn both the Tractarians and other churchmen of the tendency of the movement towards Rome.<br>
<br>Among Poole's other publications are some works of church history, especially two studies of St Cyprian. He was also a writer of popular works of history and historical fiction, such as <span class="italic">A History of England, from the First Invasion by the Romans to the Accession of Queen Victoria</span> (2 vols., 1844&#150;5), <span class="italic">The Exile's Return, or, A Cat's Journey from Glasgow to Edinburgh: a Tale for Children</span> (1837), and <span class="italic">Sir Raoul de Broc and his Son Tristram: a Tale of the Twelfth Century</span> (1849). He also published a number of sermons and addresses. Poole published few works after 1850, and died at Winwick rectory on 25 September 1883.<br>
