<span class="headword">Kemp <span class="st"> [Kempe]</span>,  John</span>  (1380/81&#150;1454), <span class="occ">administrator, cardinal, and archbishop of York and of Canterbury</span>, was born at Olantigh by Wye, near Ashford, Kent, perhaps the second son of Thomas Kemp (<i>d</i>. 1428), sometime escheator of the county, and Beatrice, daughter of Sir Thomas Lewknor, a Sussex landowner. His brother, Sir Thomas, had at least two sons, Sir William, the archbishop's named heir, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95158/', "Thomas Kemp")</script>, whom the bishop patronized extensively, to the extent of securing the see of London for him in the face of the duke of Suffolk's candidate.<h2>
<a name="EarlycareerinEnglandandNormandy"></a>Early career in England and Normandy</h2>Kemp was a fellow of Merton College, Oxford, from 1395 to 1407, serving as senior bursar in 1403&#150;4. He was ordained subdeacon on 14 April 1403 and finally priested on 21 May 1407, at the time he was preferred to the rectories of St Michael, Crooked Lane, London (often connected with personnel of the court of arches), and Southwick, Sussex. He was BCL by 1407 and DCL by 1413.<br>
<br>Kemp's early career was evidently in one of the courts of the archbishop of Canterbury, to which Archbishop Thomas Arundel attracted notable talent. On 13 September 1409 he accompanied the archbishop as one of his clerks on a visitation of Glastonbury Abbey. He was appointed as examiner-general in the court of Canterbury on 30 January 1413 and was on the tribunal for the second session of the famous trial of the Lollard Sir John Oldcastle on 25 September. He became dean of the court of arches by 21 February 1414, which explains why he was no longer the examiner-general by June. He was said to be still dean in 1428, but this is impossible. His preferment was modest for his position: the rectory of Hawkhurst and a prebend in Wingham collegiate church (both in Kent) only replaced his previous benefices. Even when he was collated to the archdeaconry of Durham, on 13 October 1417, he was obliged on papal instruction to give up the rectory.<br>
<br>Between 26 April 1414 and 13 July 1416 Kemp was appointed several times to hear appeals from the court of admiralty, and four more times before 1425, even though his career had moved on. On 25 July 1415 he was appointed to an embassy to treat with Aragon, and was engaged thus from 8 September 1415 to 13 June 1416. He was a receiver of the Canterbury convocation's first subsidy in support of its delegation to the Council of Constance, and by 1416, but probably much earlier, was on the council of Christ Church, Canterbury.<br>
<br>Henry V's campaigns in France stretched his administrative resources and brought several Canterbury officials into major royal service. On 20 July 1417 Kemp was appointed to exercise the jurisdiction of the archbishop of Canterbury overseas, which meant chiefly in those parts of France that the king was slowly acquiring by conquest. It was a key step in his career. On 7 July he had been granted letters of protection as a member of the king's retinue, and on 1 October was included for the first time in a delegation to treat with the French crown. On 6 November 1417 he was appointed&#151;perhaps worthy of note, perhaps a mere formality&#151;to hear confessions in the king's army. With hindsight, perhaps it is not a matter for surprise that by the end of 1417 he was Henry's chancellor of Lancastrian Normandy, a position he retained until September 1422, but in the immediate context the recognition of his ability and his swift rise to such prominence are as impressive as they are undocumented. In 1418, besides the general creation and ordering of the chancery, Kemp helped array troops in Normandy, treated with Burgundy (appointed 28 April), and travelled extensively on the king's business in the duchy.<h2>
<a name="Diplomaticemployment"></a>Diplomatic employment</h2>On 3 October 1418 Kemp was appointed keeper of the privy seal, a rise to chief office that meant his return to England to replace Henry Ware, a close colleague in still recent days in the archbishop's administration, who had just become a bishop and now crossed to France to join the king's immediate circle of government. Kemp was now fully engaged in the government of England in the king's absence, but still much involved in the prosecution of the war. On 24 September 1418 he had been appointed to treat with the house of Anjou, a commission that perhaps lapsed; on 21 January 1419 he was appointed in a top-rank delegation to treat with the French crown, and another on the 22nd with the dauphin, the other leading members of the embassy all being in France, but with Kemp presumably included to co-ordinate with the administration at home. With the treaty of Troyes in the making, Kemp received a rapid series of appointments to treat for peace on 23 February, 28 March, and 22 April. It seems almost certain that he was expected to be in France when he was appointed to a highest-level delegation on 28 May, to receive the oaths of Charles VI, Queen Isabella, and Philip of Burgundy that they would keep the treaty.<br>
<br>So high and fast had Kemp climbed in the king's estimation that in this spring of 1419 he was on the shortlist of those whom Henry V discussed seriously with Henry Beaufort as the latter's successor to Winchester, the richest see in the realm. In the event, Kemp received much less. On 21 June 1419 he was provided to the meagre see of Rochester (of which the archbishop of Canterbury was patron), receiving custody of the temporalities on 27 July and being consecrated at Rouen on 3 December. From July 1419 to May 1420 he was still in France, engaged in the negotiations surrounding the definitive treaty. He then returned to England, but had letters on 30 October and 6 November 1420 to go to the king in France once more. Kemp resigned as keeper of the privy seal on 25 October 1421, and just three days later was translated to Chichester; he received the temporalities formally only on 21 August, but had had a grant of &pound;650 p.a. out of them since 25 December previously. However, he was already intent on climbing higher, and is known to have intrigued in the papal curia for the see of London, to which he was translated on 17 November 1421 against the king's nominee and elect of the chapter, Thomas Polton of Hereford. On 22 May 1422 Kemp was given the spiritualities, signalling that he had won the contest, and the temporalities followed on 20 June. Polton had to settle humblingly for succeeding to Chichester. On 26 October, Kemp would enjoy the novel experience of being enthroned in one of his sees.<br>
<br>Meantime Kemp had been back in France. He surrendered the great seal of Normandy to the new regent in France, the duke of Bedford, after Henry V's death on 31 August 1422, but remained on the council in France until mid-October, when he returned to England to join the regency council there. On 22 February 1423 the bishop was present at this body to receive orders to resume his service to the council in France. On 14 May he received the customary commission to array troops, and left for France in the next two or three days. By 26 November 1423 he had returned to England and was appointed on 28 January to a weighty delegation to discuss the liberation of James I with the Scots at Durham. He remained fully engaged in council business, but found time to take on a commission to repair the condition of St Mary's Hospital, Ospringe, in Kent, on 16 February 1424, a reminder of the enduring interest in his native county that perhaps had made his frequent commuting between England and France less wearying to him than it was to others. Shortly after 2 July 1425 Kemp went over to France once more. There he undertook the unpalatable task of representing Humphrey of Gloucester in Paris, in the question of Humphrey's proposed duel with the duke of Burgundy. Fortunately, this failed to happen, and Kemp himself, who had perhaps helped ensure that it did not, certainly gained the good opinion of the duke of Bedford, for whom the quarrel between his brother and brother-in-law was a grave crisis in his regency.<h2>
<a name="Archbishopandchancellor"></a>Archbishop and chancellor</h2>Kemp's ambition to advance himself beyond London is witnessed by the correspondence between himself and his proctor in the papal curia, William Swan (preserved in the latter's letter-book, BL, Cotton MS Cleopatra C.iv). He watched the health of elderly bishops with interest. The archbishopric of York, where Henry Bowet was bedridden, did not feature on his list, perhaps because Kemp believed the council had already earmarked the succession, but it was thither that he was translated on 20 July 1425, a third choice at best, and perhaps engineered with Bedford's support after deadlock between the pope's nominee, Richard Flemming of Lincoln, and that of the council in England, Philip Morgan of Worcester. If his promotion was not immediately accepted in England, this was probably because the hostility between Beaufort and Gloucester was making any government decision impossible. It was only on 22 April 1426 that the temporalities were restored to him, immediately after Bedford had returned to England to resolve the political crisis.<br>
<br>As part of Bedford's general settlement of affairs, Kemp was appointed chancellor of the realm on 18 March 1426, not the last time that he would be called upon to take up the reins in a crisis not of his making. Bedford returned to France very quickly, and left Kemp to make what he could of a still simmering and factionalized regime. The archbishop endured it for nearly six years. On 13 July 1428, 25 October 1429, and 21 February 1431 he personally pressed the Canterbury convocation for urgently needed funds. Throughout, he is to be found at the centre of conciliar activity, seeking to respond to the deteriorating fortunes of the war in France, and to the continuing animosity between Gloucester and the majority of the council. Kemp had no faction of his own. In January 1431 he was unable to open parliament because of illness, although he attended later. By the end of that year he was finding Gloucester's attitude intolerable, especially as the duke's influence waxed against the background of defeats abroad. He connived urgently with Swan for a papal mandate ordering him to Rome, although when this was finally issued in June 1432 he had already had to resort to another pretext, that of ill health, to resign the great seal by 26 February; perhaps, in terms of stress, it is even unfair to call it pretext.<br>
<br>Kemp retired to his York diocese, which hitherto had seen him for only a few weeks each August and September, although he had taken care to make a primary visitation of his cathedral, and then a close one of the powerful archdeaconry of Richmond in 1428. After just seven months, however, Kemp was back in his Westminster inn and able to make regular trips to Olantigh by Wye, now that he was free to pursue his plan to create a school and collegiate church in his birthplace. The convenient call to Rome went unheeded. With Swan's assistance Kemp had always enjoyed the regard of the papacy as a strong supporter of its authority against proponents of conciliar reform, and he was now courted for his influence in England. Indeed, he was appointed as a royal envoy to the Council of Basel on 28 November 1432, and as late as 17 March 1433 payments were arranged for his journey, but he never went, and returned the instalment, being diverted by decision of the government to talks with France. According to his York register he was at Calais in May.<h2>
<a name="Furtherembassies"></a>Further embassies</h2>The archbishop had never formally left the council, even while generally absenting himself while Gloucester briefly held sway. He was negotiating with French envoys in England in July 1433. On 9 November 1434 Bedford named him as an executor. Kemp was now the closest colleague of Cardinal Beaufort in the direction of English policy, and headed the crown's delegation from 25 July 1435 until the latter's arrival at the congress of Arras on 31 August. Ordered to take a hard line by the government, Kemp assumed a stance towards a peace settlement that was twice rebuked formally by the papal legates who were trying to mediate. Beaufort did not soften the position and withdrew the English delegation on 6 September. Kemp's diocese forfeited his annual visit. On the other hand, in 1436 he was unusually active in the north, helping to relieve the siege of Roxburgh.<br>
<br>In April 1437 the two prelates went to negotiate with the Lancastrian chancellor in France. On 9 April 1438 they and the earls of Warwick and Suffolk headed as weighty a delegation as England could produce to treat with the enemy, indeed empowered on the twentieth to treat for a marriage settlement. From 20 November 1438 to 26 February 1439 they were at Calais, engaged in long but ultimately fruitless negotiations with the duchess of Burgundy, Kemp crossing to and fro in December and February to liaise with the king and council at home. About 23 May 1439 Kemp was appointed to lead the delegation to yet another peace conference with Charles VII's envoys at Calais. Thomas Beckington, the king's secretary, has left a detailed record of this mission. Kemp left London four days after his appointment but did not cross to Calais until 26 June. Talks began on 6 July and were uneasy and mutually distrustful throughout. He returned to Westminster to report the lack of progress on 8 September, before going back for one final effort which failed inside a week. On 29 September he did at least achieve a commercial treaty with Flanders (the duke of Burgundy's county). Kemp was more ready than Beaufort to consider a surrender of the Lancastrian claim to the French throne if the territorial concessions were good enough, but the time was far from ripe to sell such a humiliation to English political opinion. Both were, besides, of a generation that conducted talks with Frenchmen in tones of deep and open distrust. He returned to London on 7 October.<br>
<br>Although the government's fortunes were failing, Kemp's status was enhanced by his creation on 18 December 1439 as cardinal-priest of St Balbina. He was licensed by the king to accept the red hat on 14 February 1440, despite furious protests from the aged Archbishop Chichele of Canterbury about the superior legatine authority Kemp might thereby seek to exercise in the southern province. Twenty years earlier Chichele had nearly ruined Beaufort over the latter's similar promotion, and at least delayed it for seven years. This time, his protests were treated with contempt. Crown and papacy were in agreement over Kemp's merits and position; he thus became the first cardinal-archbishop in England.<h2>
<a name="Politicaleclipse"></a>Political eclipse</h2>However, the failure of English policy in France led to Kemp's implication in Gloucester's furious attack in January and February 1441 on Beaufort's record and even loyalty. Although Beaufort was fully protected by the crown, and Kemp was never indicted directly, rising figures around the king, notably the earl of Suffolk, seem to have felt that the two cardinals had had their day. Although there is no specific evidence at the time, it might be thought likely that this shadow was a contributory factor to Kemp's being passed over in favour of John Stafford, bishop of Bath and Wells and chancellor, for the succession to Canterbury in 1442&#150;3. Kemp loved Kent and would not have seen age as an issue, nor his dreadful absenteeism from his diocese (which Stafford at least equalled) as an indictment. It seems more than coincidence that, for the first time ever, Kemp's customary August visit to his diocese in 1443 extended into a stay of sixteen months, save only for limited periods of attendance at Westminster in January&#150;February and June&#150;July 1444, no doubt in connection with the French expedition funded by Cardinal Beaufort under the leadership of the latter's nephew, the duke of Somerset. Kemp had by now a solid group of very long-standing officials (some of them even student friends) entrenched in the York chapter and provincial administration, and his secular officers became involved in such serious friction with the earl of Northumberland's men around Knaresborough as to engage the direct attention of the crown in 1442 and 1443. Perhaps this too was an incentive to Kemp to spend time fighting his own corner rather than serve an ungrateful government.<br>
<br>Kemp was clearly not now a part of the narrowing circle around the king that actually ran the government and, as in the time of his chancellorship, there was only limited use of formal council meetings where men such as he might give their opinion. However, he was urgently required in Westminster in 1445 when relations with France entered a crucial phase, and he was needed to provide status, experience, and overt commitment to the great delegation that received a French embassy in the wake of the marriage of Henry VI and Margaret of Anjou. The business done, he was free to return to York from August 1446. On 20 January 1447 he was named as a principal executor of Cardinal Beaufort's will, and spent some time in April and May in Winchester on that business. In that same year, and curiously late in life, he became a member of the confraternity of Christ Church, Canterbury, and was in Kent for much of the autumn, probably to enjoy opening his school in Wye.<br>
<br>If it is clear that Kemp and his close friend and political colleague, Ralph, Lord Cromwell, were by no means close to the duke of Suffolk's ruling circle, yet they came to lend their attendance and reputation to the king's faltering government so far as they were allowed. During 1449 the archbishop managed only one brief trip to his diocese, in July, as the crisis of war and finance came to a head. However, it may have been a more personal matter that had principally kept Kemp at Westminster of late. It is generally held that Suffolk made a serious political mistake in pressing for the promotion to the see of London of Marmaduke Lumley, bishop of Carlisle and treasurer of the realm, refusing to give government approval to the appointment of the cardinal's nephew, Thomas Kemp, who had received the formal support of the king for his candidacy and consequently papal provision to the see on 21 August 1448. The cardinal had actually lived in the bishop of London's palace in Fulham for much of the previous six months, even though his own was perfectly inhabitable, while old Bishop Robert Gilbert's life was maddeningly prolonged by intensive nursing at Much Hadham, Hertfordshire. The fact that Thomas Kemp was a meritless candidate, as he was to prove comprehensively over the next forty years, while Lumley was making impressive steps in recovering the crown's financial stability, does not remove the question mark over Suffolk's belated obstruction. However, if it helped distance Kemp publicly and probably in fact from Suffolk just when the duke needed him, the cardinal rallied none the less to the government's aid, and thus also to the duke's, when crisis came.<h2>
<a name="Pillarofthegovernment"></a>Pillar of the government</h2>When Suffolk was impeached early in 1450, all the chief officers of state perforce resigned or were dismissed. The king and government were in disarray as the Commons in parliament closed in on those they hated. It was in such circumstances, on 31 January 1450, that Kemp was recalled as chancellor. As had happened twenty-four years earlier, he was being asked to remedy a crisis caused by others, and as he had then he responded with loyalty to the crown, ability, and no little courage. Naturally, within a week his nephew had firm possession of the see of London. There is no doubt that the cardinal was a prime maker as well as mouthpiece of the bold strategy that saved Suffolk from judicial condemnation. Then, on 6 July 1450 Kemp helped negotiate the withdrawal from London of Jack Cade and his followers from the south-eastern counties. However, between August and September he led unsympathetic inquiries in person in Kent into the causes and nature of the revolt. Towards the end of the year, when the duke of York's attempts to involve himself in government caused grave concern in the court, the Commons in parliament demanded (and obtained) some purging of the household and resumption of royal revenues, and the duke of Somerset and others faced threats of lynching, Kemp maintained some semblance of authority and competence for the government. He himself faced no criticism from any quarter, and by May 1451 the crown had shrugged off its various critics. Although the duke of Somerset is seen, especially in retrospect when civil wars broke out, as emerging rapidly as the strongman of the regime, there does seem to have been broader-based policy making at this time, with finances stabilized and some sound preparation for the relief of Gascony. Kemp played his part in this restoration of respect for the crown. In February 1452 he acted as a mediator between York and the king, when the duke backed down from his attempt at an armed coup to bring Somerset to trial.<br>
<br>Kemp was even able to secure Canterbury at last. After the death of John Stafford on 25 June 1452, Kemp was elected just three days later, and his translation by the pope followed as soon as 21 July, with the enhanced title of cardinal-bishop of St Rufina. The first cardinal-archbishop of Canterbury received his temporalities on 6 September and the pallium from his nephew on the twenty-fourth. He was enthroned at Canterbury on 11 December. His health was not good by now, but it is inconceivable that anyone else could have been promoted at that time. Indeed, whether inspired specifically by achieving his home diocese and primacy of all England, he found novel enthusiasm for ecclesiastical duties. Ill health prevented his attending convocation in February 1453, so he brought the assembly to himself at Lambeth and invited open discussion on possible reforms of the church in the province, an initiative all too soon overtaken by the usual agenda of taxation. As early as September 1452 he had prepared a fascinatingly detailed itinerary for a primary visitation of his diocese, promising personal inspection of each parish and setting out his mealtimes and places each day; ill health and government business inevitably aborted the plan.<br>
<br>The collapse of the king's mental health in early August 1453 brought Kemp to his last and greatest crisis. It seems that, for as long as the king was alive, the majority of the Lords proposed simply to group around him and exercise collective authority in the king's name, allowing no one even the name of protector, still less regent. When Henry VI's only child, Edward, was born on 13 October, Kemp stood as godparent, despite his advanced age and frail health, alongside the dukes of Somerset and Buckingham, a firm public statement of the boy's heritage. That same month the lords in council, who had been hanging fire over the vacation but had now to come to at least implicit terms with the king's incapacity, called for York to join them and subsequently concurred in the imprisonment of Somerset until he should answer charges laid against him. In December, leading lords led by Kemp explicitly admitted to the king's illness and undertook to rule. It was said that the queen requested she be made regent, but no formal response has been found.<h2>
<a name="Deathofastatesman"></a>Death of a statesman</h2>It was resolved that parliament must be recalled on 14 February 1454, having been twice prorogued since the king's collapse. Amid open tension and rumours that armed factions were being called up by various magnates, the duke of Norfolk was warned by a servant that he should hide his own such preparations from Kemp and other lords of the council, if he was to avoid sanctions. The cardinal himself prepared an armed bodyguard. When the assembly opened, Kemp was fully active in attendance, and called publicly for prayers for the king's health on 2 March 1454. There is no convincing sign of any move to establish a protectorate, only speculation through hindsight by some historians. Then, with no warning, Kemp died at Lambeth Palace on 22 March. The Lords moved at once to send a forlorn but necessary delegation to Windsor to seek guidance from the king as to a new chancellor and new archbishop. In its nervously detailed report on its failure, this delegation never mentioned the idea of a protectorate, but this was what the Lords now moved to establish. Those who had been named as councillors before Kemp's death demanded to reconsider their position now that their service was to be under York's leadership, and there was widespread (if sometimes nominal) reluctance. This seems to confirm that the arrangement had not been planned at all before the cardinal died, and that he was irreplaceable in moral as well as official authority in the turbulent body politic of the time. There were significantly contradictory rumours after his demise. One allegation was that Norfolk had wanted him dismissed as chancellor, presumably as an obstacle to York's advance, or as a deeply cautious obstacle to Somerset's being brought to trial; a contrary scandal claimed that Somerset had had him poisoned. The first has a note of credibility; the latter testifies more to Somerset's deep unpopularity. Together they indicate Kemp's position above faction. Had he survived until the king recovered his health, the civil wars might not have happened; with his death, they were certain.<br>
<br>There is no will extant. Kemp was buried on the south side of the presbytery in Canterbury Cathedral, where his handsome tomb survives. On the completion of his school and college project at Wye, his birthplace, in 1447, Kemp had recommended that, if possible, a fellow of his own alma mater, Merton College, should always be appointed as provost. The archbishop was given to such long-standing affections, in both his personal and public lives. His letters to Swan have made him appear notably avaricious, but it is only their survival that is unusual. His record of absenteeism from his diocese has been held against him and cannot be gainsaid, but it was never lazy. His ascent to eminence was based on pure ability and a willingness to shoulder burdens that had broken others; no political favours or sinecures came his way, and indeed at times he was rewarded ungenerously. He affected no asceticism or high-profile piety, but likewise acquired no image of corruption, flamboyance, or avarice. He was not so much a politician as the ablest administrator of his time, always loyal to the crown and rallying a consensus around it when factionalism had overtaken. He had few if any friends among those born to the purple, and they did little to win his respect. His officials were his old friends, and his family came above all else. He earned squarely the status and honours that came his way. He died peerless as cardinal-archbishop of Canterbury; he would have liked that. He was buried in Kent; he would have liked that even more.<br>
