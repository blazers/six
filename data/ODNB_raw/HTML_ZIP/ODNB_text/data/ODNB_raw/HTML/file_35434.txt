<span class="headword">Pearce, Sir  (Standen) Leonard</span>  (1873&#150;1947), <span class="occ">electrical engineer</span>, was born at Chapel House, Crewkerne, Somerset, on 28 September 1873, the only child of the Revd Standen Pearce, a Baptist minister, and his wife, Sarah Young. He was educated at Bishop's Stortford College and the Finsbury Technical College, subsequently serving his apprenticeship with the Electrical Engineering Corporation, of West Drayton, and with Thomas Richardson &amp; Sons, of Hartlepool. After a year as an engineer at sea he returned to work for the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company. Two years later, in 1899, he joined the British Thomson-Houston Company, and took part in the construction of electrical equipment for the Central London Railway. In the following year he became assistant, then shortly afterwards superintendent engineer of the railway's Shepherd's Bush power station. In 1901 he returned to the electricity supply industry as deputy chief electrical engineer to the Manchester corporation. Also in 1901, on 18 July, he married Susannah (Susie) Kate (<i>d</i>. 1938), daughter of George R. Cockhead, of Crouch End, London, a dealer in rare books; they had one daughter. Three years later Pearce became chief electrical engineer, and then general manager of the electricity department and consulting electrical engineer to the corporation, a post which he held until 1925. During this period he was engaged in much development and constructional work, which culminated in the design and erection of Barton power station. In 1916, at the request of the Board of Trade, he formed a committee to consider the electrical supply resources of Lancashire and Cheshire, and in 1920 he played a leading part in the inception of the south-east Lancashire electricity scheme. The advisory board, of which he was chairman, was the first to function in any of the districts into which the country was divided under the <span class="roman">Electricity (Supply) Act</span> of 1919.<br>
<br>In 1924 Pearce spent six months in Australia at the invitation of the municipality of Sydney, to advise on various matters in connection with the electrical developments in that country. In the following year he was appointed an electricity commissioner, but in 1926 he became, and remained until his death, engineer-in-chief of the London Power Company, formed to co-ordinate and develop the generation of electricity in the metropolis. Of his valuable work in this capacity the most notable was the design and construction of the Deptford West and Battersea power stations. His association with Sir Giles Gilbert Scott in designing the latter marked the beginning of a close collaboration between engineers and architects in the building of power stations. At Battersea, Pearce also initiated, and successfully carried through, the design and construction of a flue-washing plant to eliminate fumes. For many years, power-stations of his design headed the list for efficiency, and his leadership in this field may be attributed not only to his own high standards but also to his emphasis on the importance of avoiding fixed ideas and of maintaining a breadth of view able to take account of progress in other spheres of knowledge.<br>
<br>Pearce was a valued member&#151;in some cases an honorary member&#151;of the institutions connected with his profession, which he served in various capacities. He was awarded the Constantine gold medal of the Manchester Association, the Watt gold medal of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and finally, in 1947, the Faraday medal of the Institution of Electrical Engineers. He was an honorary DSc of Manchester University (1926), was appointed CBE in 1919, and knighted in 1935. These honours he received with his customary reserved and modest attitude towards his own achievements, and a generous acknowledgement of the work of colleagues.<br>
<br>To his recreations, as to his profession, Pearce brought the same unassuming sincerity of purpose. He was a keen musician and, when living in Manchester, played the organ at the Baptist chapel which he attended. He was an enthusiastic mountain climber, in summer and winter, with more than 150 first-class ascents in the Alps to his credit. He planned methodically, was very safe, and always considerate of his guides. He regarded skiing as an aid to winter mountaineering, and he was also an expert skater. In his home and office were pictures of the mountains, which he loved and greatly missed during the war years of 1939&#150;45, when he added the work of an electricity commissioner to his other tasks. In 1935 he had accompanied Sir William Ellis when he ascended the Jungfrau in celebration of his seventy-fifth birthday, but Pearce did not live, as he had hoped, to do the same, for he died aged seventy-four, on 20 October 1947, at his home, Crewkerne, 8 Park Hill, Bickley, Kent.<br>
