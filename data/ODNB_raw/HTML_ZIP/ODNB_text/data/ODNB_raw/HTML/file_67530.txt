<span class="headword">Bruce,  Alexander</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1729), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was the second son of Andrew Bruce (<i>d</i>. 1696) of Earlshall, Fife, and his cousin and second wife, Anna, daughter of Robert Bruce, minister of Ballingry, Fife, and Anna, daughter of George Seaton. He may have been the Alexander Bruce who matriculated at Leiden in 1694, but the name is not uncommon. He was admitted advocate on 5 December 1702.<br>
<br>Bruce was the author of a number of legal works, including <span class="italic">Disputatio juridica de re militari</span> (1702), <span class="italic">Principia juris feudalis</span> (1713), <span class="italic">Tutor's guide, or, Principles of civil and municipal laws and customs relating to pupils and minors and their tutors or curators</span> (1714), and <span class="italic">An Institute of Military Law, Ancient and Modern</span> (1717). Of these the <span class="italic">Principia juris feudalis</span> is noted by Professor John Girvan as perhaps &#145;entitled to a passing reference in respect of the freshness with which he handles from the time to time the subject&#146;  (McKechnie, 204), while D. M. Walker notes that the <span class="italic">Institute of Military Law</span> &#145;shows considerable learning and acquaintance with continental jurists&#146;  (Walker, 304). Indeed, in all these works Bruce treated Scots law within a framework of the learned <i>jus commune</i> of Europe.<br>
<br>In 1713 Bruce was appointed collector of decisions for the Faculty of Advocates in succession to William Forbes. He planned to compile a dictionary of decisions from the institution of the college of justice, but this grand scheme made little progress. He produced <span class="italic">Decisions</span> for 1714/15, published in 1720 and also bound with Lord Kames's <span class="italic">Remarkable Decisions</span> (1728). His <span class="italic">Decisions</span> for 1716/17 were printed in 1772 as a supplement to the third volume of <span class="italic">Faculty Collections</span>. The Faculty of Advocates' minute book discloses Bruce's steady decline into illness, poverty, and debt, and his many appeals to the faculty for financial assistance. He was dismissed from his post as collector in 1723. He continued until 1725 as clerk of the Faculty of Advocates, much of this work, however, being done by Thomas Ruddiman, the clerk depute. James Boswell refers to him as &#145;poor Bruce&#146;  (<span class="italic">Applause of the Jury</span>, 18). Bruce married, on 24 April 1698, Janet, daughter of William Home, a merchant in Edinburgh; they had at least six children. She predeceased him in 1726. Alexander Bruce died on 6 August 1729. His son, Andrew (<i>d</i>. 1745), who was disabled, became a faculty pensioner. Two of his daughters, Anne and Barbara, were still drawing a faculty pension as late as 1778.<br>
