<span class="headword">Conder,  James</span>  (1761&#150;1823), <span class="occ">numismatist and antiquary</span>, the youngest of seven sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6058/', "John Conder DD (1714&#150;1781)")</script>, Independent minister, and his wife, Susan, daughter of John Flindell, leatherseller of Ipswich, was born at Mile End, Middlesex, on 22 October 1761. He was educated at the dissenters' academy at Ware and under Mr French, a Unitarian minister. At the age of nineteen he moved to Ipswich, where his brother John was working for Flindell (whom he later succeeded). Conder married, on 1 January 1790, Mary Foster (1758&#150;1836), third daughter of George Notcutt, haberdasher, of Ipswich, and his wife, Thomasin Moore, and set up as linen draper in Tavern Street. He sold this business to Shepherd Ray in 1808, and reopened in the Buttermarket, Ipswich, in partnership with his wife's widowed sister Elizabeth Goddard as Goddard and Conder, haberdashers and snuffsellers.<br>
<br>As well as mainstream coins Conder built up an unrivalled collection of trade tokens produced by firms as advertisement and as change at a time when small copper coins were in short supply. In the mid-1790s he issued several tokens advertising his drapery warehouse, the most striking designed by the eminent medallist John Milton (<i>d</i>. 1805). Conder's enthusiasm ran to the lengths of contriving rarities by altering or breaking dies after striking small numbers of coins, and to the publication in 1798 and 1799 of a catalogue of all known tokens issued in the British Isles and the colonies &#145;within the last twenty years&#146;, a work sold at Bucklersbury in London by his elder brother Thomas. Although his projected history of nonconformism in Suffolk came to nothing, Conder's help is acknowledged by Walter Wilson in the preface to his <span class="italic">Dissenting Churches</span> (1808), and by Benjamin Brook in his <span class="italic">Lives of the Puritans</span> (1813).<br>
<br>Conder's interest in Suffolk topography brought him the friendship of the Revd James Ford (1779&#150;1850), who wrote a eulogistic obituary of Conder over the initials J. F. in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. Conder's collection of prints and drawings to illustrate the county's history was celebrated, a model for those of G. R. S. Nassau and W. S. Fitch. His ownership of the manuscript copy of the Suffolk collections made <i>c</i>.1655 by Matthias Candler (now Society of Antiquaries MS 667) caused much confusion in nineteenth-century literature when cited as the Conder MS. He played a principal part in founding the Ipswich Friendly Society in 1810 and was generous in its support.<br>
<br>Conder died after a sudden illness on 22 March 1823 in the Buttermarket, Ipswich, and was buried six days later in the grounds of the Independent meeting-house in Tacket Street where the family worshipped. His brother-in-law the Revd Charles Atkinson, who was minister there, preached the sermon. The eldest of his seven children, James Notcutt Conder, took his father's place with his aunt in the business until her death in 1830 in the timber-framed house distinguished by its fine carved cornerpost, 8 feet high, at the corner of St Lawrence Lane and the Buttermarket. It is perhaps ironic that when in 1863 the house was demolished a hoard of over a hundred silver pennies of Ethelred the Unready, some minted in Ipswich, was discovered under the staircase; as they were 5 feet deep one can probably rule out the possibility that Conder hid the coins there for posterity. Conder's widow lived with her daughter Mary Nash in Wymondham, Norfolk, until her death in 1836, when she was buried beside her husband.<br>
