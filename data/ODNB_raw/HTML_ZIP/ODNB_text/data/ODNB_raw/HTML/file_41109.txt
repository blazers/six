<span class="headword">Greenwood,  Christopher</span>  (1786&#150;1855), <span class="occ">land surveyor and map maker</span>, was born on 21 May 1786 at Coverdale in Gisburn parish, Yorkshire, the third of the ten children of John Greenwood, grazier, and his wife, Ellen (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Bullock). The family had been long established in the district. After learning his trade, and presumably practising locally for some years, he set up in Dewsbury in 1815. Soon afterwards he settled in Wakefield, where he married Maria Elizabeth, the daughter of William Fowler, a local wool stapler, at St John's Church, on 5 June 1816. In 1814 or 1815 he had embarked on the survey of Yorkshire which launched the career in county map making which was to occupy the rest of his professional life; it was published in Wakefield between May 1817 and August 1818. Trained to survey small estates and farms, Greenwood learned the techniques of triangulation and the use of instruments needed to survey areas the size of counties from the engineer and surveyor, Francis Giles, who supervised his local triangulation of Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Following the death of his mother in July 1818 Greenwood moved to London. With only the Yorkshire map in print, he had determined to map the whole of the rest of England at one inch to one mile, and Wales at three-quarters of an inch to one mile. In 1822, with eleven counties already on sale, he advertised the complete scheme in detail: a set of forty-two maps comprising 184 sheets to cost 135 guineas. Greenwood was not the first private surveyor to embark on such a risky enterprise&#151;as it turned out, six English counties and most of Wales were never surveyed&#151;but he came far closer than any other map maker since his fellow Yorkshireman, Christopher Saxton, in the 1570s, to surveying all the English counties. His assistant in all his county maps was his younger brother <a name="cosubject_41109"></a><span class="headword">John Greenwood</span>  (1791&#150;1867)<span class="occ"></span>, who had been working for him since before he left Gisburn. In fifteen years (1815&#150;30) the brothers surveyed thirty-three English and four Welsh counties; the result is thirty-five maps at a scale of one inch to one mile or thereabouts (Yorkshire and south-east Wales at three-quarters of an inch to one mile, and Middlesex at 2 inches). Even allowing for the use of the major triangulation of the Ordnance Survey, and possibly some help from existing surveys, it was an astonishing achievement for a private surveyor in so short a time. The majority of these surveys anticipated publication of the sheets of the Ordnance Survey. Even in the south of England and in Lincolnshire, where the Ordnance Survey published their maps first, Greenwood did not slavishly copy the work, but offered a distinctive style and some additional information; not least of the attractions of his maps was the high standard of the engraving.<br>
<br>For a wider market an <span class="italic">Atlas of the Counties of England</span> appeared in parts between 1829 and 1834. The enduring popularity of its plates came partly from the beautifully engraved vignettes of cathedrals, castles, or town views that graced each one. The Greenwoods' only venture outside county or regional map making was their map of London (1827) at eight inches to one mile, engraved to high standards by James and Josiah Neele, who probably printed most of Greenwood's maps.<br>
<br>Although Greenwood can rightly be regarded as an important and successful map maker, by concentrating on the publication of original surveys&#151;rather than on popular atlases and derivative maps&#151;he was taking risks. He relied on the patronage of the aristocracy, but also depended heavily on his business partners. On his arrival in London he established himself at 50 Leicester Square. In 1820 the firm moved to 70 Queen Street, Cheapside&#151;the premises of George Pringle, a solicitor, and George Pringle junior, who had become his new partners by 1819. His father-in-law was already a financial partner, and in 1821 or 1822 John Greenwood also became a partner. The firm secured its first unshared premises in 1824, at 13 Lower Regent Street, a fashionable address where the business had its most successful years. Each map was dedicated to &#145;the nobility, clergy, and gentry&#146; of the county concerned. But Greenwood was not unusual in failing to find long-term security in making county maps&#151;he faced increasing competition (reflected in acrimonious exchanges in local newspapers) from other private surveyors, notably Andrew Bryant. In the longer term it was the Ordnance Survey which overwhelmed him: by 1834, when the business was already foundering, southern and midland counties, as well as south Wales, were covered by the Ordnance Survey.<br>
<br>In 1828 George Pringle junior left. Thereafter the publication of maps tailed off and some plates were sold to other publishers who printed from them with little or no revision. By late 1830 Greenwood had left Regent Street and within four years, after struggling on in Covent Garden and Paternoster Row, the business appears to have collapsed. The Greenwoods had published three county topographies in 1822&#150;3, and, after seeing his cartographic business prematurely collapse, Christopher turned, unsuccessfully, to publishing county historical guides from an office in Hart Street, Bloomsbury.<br>
<br>John Greenwood had returned to Yorkshire by 1835 and made estate, enclosure, and tithe maps until at least 1850. He died on 1 October 1867, aged seventy-six, and was buried in Gisburn. Christopher Greenwood's stock-in-trade was sold at Sothebys on 18 June 1840. He died in obscurity on 25 March 1855 at 2 Sarah Place, on Kingsland Road, Dalston, Hackney, London.<br>
