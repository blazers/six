<span class="headword">College <span class="st"> [Colledge]</span>,  Stephen</span>  (<em>c.</em>1635&#150;1681), <span class="occ">poet and political activist</span>, was born in Watford, Hertfordshire, where he married and began a family. Neither the names of his parents, nor that of his wife (who probably predeceased him), are as yet known. He saw military service during the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665&#150;7), when he also became acquainted with another antic poet of the Restoration, John Wilmot, earl of Rochester. College (or Colledge, the spelling he may have preferred himself) relocated to London thereafter, becoming a freeman and pursuing his trade as a joiner. In 1680 he was living in Water Street in St Ann Blackfriars parish.<h2>
<a name="TheProtestantJoiner"></a>The Protestant Joiner</h2>College was a reformed protestant who had exchanged presbyterianism for the restored Church of England in 1660, but he returned to his presbyterian roots in reaction to the coercive practices of Restoration Anglicanism. Remaining an occasional conformist, he respected Anglican divines like John Tillotson; and he hoped for union between a reformed establishment and those dissenters who were prepared to embrace a more comprehensive church. He was friendly with Titus Oates, Israel Tonge (who died in his house), and several other Popish Plot witnesses. He appeared at the trial of Lord Stafford to support the credibility of a chief witness for the prosecution. He constructed several of the effigies for the London pope-burning processions of 1679&#150;80. Bishop Gilbert Burnet described him as &#145;an active and hot man&#146;, and he was known to his contemporaries as the Protestant Joiner  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 2.296).<br>
<br>College became notorious as the author and reciter of satirical poems and ballads that translated the religious and political concerns of the parliamentary opposition into the language of ordinary people. At the centre of the flourishing popular print culture of 1679&#150;81, he is known to have read his work in London coffee houses and public houses, where he was observed &#145;bawling against the government&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 8.610). He was also a defender of the Long Parliament, which he believed had &#145;stood up for the rights of the people&#146;  (ibid., 691). The satires of 1679&#150;80 that have been attributed to him vary in quality; but they consistently turn anti-popish language against the court and against James, duke of York, the Catholic successor to Charles II.<br>
<br>Another particular target of College's pen was Lord Chief Justice Sir William Scroggs, who was blamed by the whigs for the acquittal of suspected Catholic conspirators. College depicted Scroggs as a bloated persecutor of protestants who followed in the sanguinary footsteps of his father, falsely identified in whig rumour as a butcher. Indeed, College invested Scroggs with all the attributes of the loathed Thomas Wolsey (another supposed butcher's son), including the papal rewards of a cardinal's cap and legatine authority. College further directed his poetic attacks against Catholic nobles, courtiers, and royal favourites, &#145;who would convert us by a sea of blood, and turn the laws of England out of doors by standing army, pensioners and whores&#146;  (S. College, &#145;Truth brought to light&#146;, Lord and others, 2.15).<br>
<br>College's ultimate target, however, was Charles II himself. &#145;Alas! poor nation,&#146; he wrote in 1679, &#145;how art thou undone by a bad father, and now a worse, his son!&#146;  (Lord, 2.16). An advocate of parliamentary solutions to the nation's crisis, College also endorsed popular action: &#145;We'll die at our doors ere in Smithfield we'll burn&#146;  (S. College, &#145;A lampoon on Lord Scroggs&#146;, Lord, 2.289). He has been credited, accurately or not, with the invention of &#145;the protestant flail&#146;, a weapon with which ordinary people could defend themselves against menacing Catholics who sought to &#145;enthrall&#146; and to &#145;enslave&#146; the nation  (S. College, &#145;Justice in masquerade&#146;, Lord, 2.284).<br>
<br>College's success as a popular spokesman brought him to the attention of London whig leaders like Sir Robert Clayton and Sir Thomas Player, and of such whig grandees as the earl of Shaftesbury and William, Lord Russell. In his capacity as a joiner College was asked by them to search the Westminster cellars on the eve of the 1680&#150;81 parliament for incendiary devices that might have been planted by Catholics. In March 1681 College attended the brief third Exclusion Parliament in Oxford, which was dissolved within days of its opening, when the Commons proceeded again with a bill to exclude the duke of York from the throne. College came to Oxford with arms and in the company of William, Lord Howard; William, Lord Paget; and the earls of Clare and Huntingdon, who were also armed. He was seen about town engaging in political conversation, and he distributed blue ribbons with the slogan &#145;No Popery, No Slavery&#146;. He was involved in an altercation outside the meeting place of the House of Lords, and he returned to London in the company of the City MPs.<h2>
<a name="ARaReeShow"></a>A Ra-Ree Show</h2>College was also armed at Oxford with the satirical ballad <span class="italic">A Ra-Ree Show</span> (1681). The poem depicted Charles II as a deceptive showman, as a master of political puppetry who held &#145;freeborn fools&#146; in contempt, and who intended to substitute &#145;brave strong government&#146; for the rule of king in parliament  (S. College, &#145;A raree show&#146;, Lord, 2.427, 429). The ballad also criticized the bishops and the clergy of the Anglican church as inclined to popery, and it recalled the punishment of Charles I &#145;for fleecing England's flocks&#146;  (ibid., 429). It concluded with a call &#145;to pull down raree show&#146; (Charles's duplicitous political game), to preserve parliament, and to &#145;free &hellip; the nation&#146;, for &#145;the hunt's begun &hellip; like father, like son&#146;  (ibid., 430, 431). According to hostile sources, the ballad was sung in Oxford and at Lord Lovelace's country house, &#145;where some Aldermen, and choice Lads of <i>London</i>&#146;, reportedly including Clayton and Player, &#145;got drunk, and trolloll'd it bravely&#146;  (North, <span class="italic">Examen</span>, 101&#150;2). A companion piece to the ballad was a cartoon in which Charles II was shown being knocked over by agents of parliament, while bishops and courtiers were stuffed into the king's bag of political tricks. A second cartoon that circulated at Oxford was also associated with College: <span class="italic">A Prospect of a Popish Successor</span> [1681] depicted the duke of York in the guise of a devil and the Anglican bishops as papal minions.<br>
<br>College was seen at the April 1681 treason trial of Edward Fitzharris, the Irish informant, from whom the whigs had hoped to secure further revelations about Catholic plotting, and from whom the court hoped to secure revelations damaging to the whigs. Fitzharris's ultimate tale about a whig conspiracy at Oxford did not save him from the scaffold. But Fitzharris's story did provide the government with a pretext for arresting College, his fellow London whig activist John Rouse, and lords Shaftesbury and Howard.<br>
<br>College was now caught up in the loyalist counter-offensive of 1681&#150;2, which was designed to rally the nation around Charles II as the near victim of violence supposedly intended by the whigs. The court's real target was Shaftesbury, but the prosecution of College&#151;for his alleged involvement in a design to raise a rebellion and to seize the king&#151;provided a dress rehearsal for the case against Shaftesbury. On 8 July 1681 College was tried before a Middlesex grand jury who returned a verdict of <i>ignoramus</i> to the charge. Impanelled by the whig sheriffs Slingsby Bethel and Henry Cornish, the jury was truly made up of College's peers: most of the jurors were nonconformists and tradesmen. With Shaftesbury's fate much in mind, the whigs celebrated this outcome, but loyalists protested that justice could not be found in London.<h2>
<a name="Thetrialfortreason"></a>The trial for treason</h2>The ministry responded by arguing that since College's alleged treason had occurred in two places, London and Oxford, he could be tried in either locality. The Joiner was accordingly indicted again in Oxford. The government carefully planned a second case against him, hoping even to turn College's anti-papal rhetoric against him by finding evidence that he was secretly a Catholic.<br>
<br>From the Tower, Shaftesbury assisted College in his Oxford defence, providing him with the hired legal assistance of Aaron Smith and Robert West. The duke of Buckingham's lawyer, Edward Whitaker, also sought to aid him. Recognizing the importance of the trial, the &#145;buisy factious partymen&#146; of London flocked to Oxford to show their support for the Protestant Joiner  (North, <span class="italic">Life of the Lord Keeper</span>, 74). The home of the mathematician John Wallis, who was a friend of John Locke, became a meeting place for those hoping to assist College. The result of his Oxford trial on 17 August was a foregone conclusion, however, given that a jury of dutiful loyalists had been as carefully assembled as the whig jury of London had been. Sir George Jeffreys, the former recorder of London, who had been a target of whig reprisals in parliament, was a chief counsel for the prosecution.<br>
<br>A variety of political witnesses, many of them once useful to the whigs, claimed that College was at the heart of a design against the king. They cited <span class="italic">A Ra-Ree Show</span> to demonstrate College's treasonable intentions. College's defence, which he claimed he &#145;took out of the [law] books myself&#146;, was a spirited one  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 8.585). The proceedings, which began at 9 a.m., did not conclude until 3 a.m. the following morning. Deprived of legal papers provided by Aaron Smith, which the judges claimed were libellous, College presented himself as a victim of judicial miscarriage: &#145;My Lord Coke says, it is the birth-right of every Englishman to have counsel in matters of law, and [John] Lilburne had it &hellip; in his Trial&#146;  (ibid., 573). College denied that he was the author of the verses in question or of the cartoon they inspired. He called Titus Oates and others to discredit the witnesses against him, and he sought to turn the political tables on the court. According to him, the charges really emanated from the papists, who sought to undermine those who had uncovered their disloyalty by false reports of whig plotting: &#145;This is a most horrid conspiracy to take away my life; and it will not stop here, for it is against all the Protestants in England&#146;  (ibid., 575).<br>
<br>Found guilty, College was executed in the Oxford Castle yard two weeks later, on 31 August, after declining to offer information against whig leaders. He protested his innocence to the end, but he acknowledged that in &#145;heat of talk&#146; he had sometimes &#145;uttered some words of indecency &hellip; concerning the King&#146;  (<span class="italic">True Copy of the Dying Words</span>, verso). Gilbert Burnet was particularly outraged by the behaviour of Chief Justice Sir Francis North at the trial, and other whig observers also alleged numerous legal irregularities in the proceedings against College. In a final letter to his son Stephen, College urged him to forgo &#145;that folly of Riming, for &hellip; it will do you hurt&#146;  (Clark, 2.553n.). Charles II permitted his remains to be buried (at St Gregory by Paul in London) rather than exposed.<h2>
<a name="Thewhigmartyr"></a>The whig martyr</h2>College continued to be a critical public figure after his death. Loyalist lampoons celebrated his demise as a sign of the nation's recovery from the political courses of 1641. Aphra Behn included an outspoken London joiner in <span class="italic">The Roundheads</span> (1682), and John Crowne presented College in the character of the Bricklayer, &#145;a bold, saucy, factious fellow&#146;, in <span class="italic">City Politiques</span> (1683). Loyalists were also determined to employ College's story as a warning to articulate &#145;mechanicks&#146; to observe their proper places. Even Lord Macaulay, writing a century and a half later, judged College from an aristocrat perspective, dismissing him as &#145;a noisy and violent demagogue of mean birth and education&#146;  (Macaulay, 1.252).<br>
<br>For contemporary whigs, however, College became the most important victim of Catholic intrigue since Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey. His apotheosis as an image of the virtuous protestant citizen was instantaneous, and his picture was hawked in the London streets. The tory propagandist Sir Roger L'Estrange sought unsuccessfully to prevent this popular canonization of College. By 1683 the Protestant Joiner was revered in London as &#145;good Stephen College&#146; and as a &#145;martyr for the people's privileges&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>July&#150;Sept 1683</i>, 309). Indeed, the government's treatment of College was an important factor in drawing some of his political acquaintances into the conspiracies of 1682&#150;3. Among those involved in conspiracy were the attorneys who had aided College in his Oxford trial, Robert West and Aaron Smith; his fellow joiner William Hone, who may have worked with College; and College's sister, who remained in touch with West after College's death. According to West, the Rye House conspirators intended to try Lord Keeper North at Oxford for his part in College's case and to &#145;hang him upon the same post on which Colledge was hanged&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 9.422). One version of the manifesto for the duke of Monmouth's 1685 rebellion also stressed the &#145;barbarous murder of Stephen Colledge under pretence of law&#146; as a rationale for resistance  (Harley MS 6845, fol. 257).<br>
<br>College's story was prominently recounted in the whig martyrologies published after the revolution of 1688. Historians have generally followed whig observers in believing that College was the victim of judicial murder. His poetry and his political behaviour were indiscreet; but the evidence for the treasonable actions attributed to him was largely contrived.<br>
