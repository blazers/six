<span class="headword">Zerffi,  George Gustavus</span>  (1820&#150;1892), <span class="occ">writer on art and history</span>, was probably born in Buda, Hungary, the son of Julius Stephan Zerffi, an editor and translator. George Zerffi edited the <span class="italic">Ungar</span> newspaper in Pest, and took part in the 1848 revolution, serving as a captain in the revolutionary army. In 1849 he moved to England, where he was naturalized. For sixteen years he acted as a well-paid member of a network of secret agents organized by the Austrian foreign ministry. His targets were members of the Hungarian, and other, &eacute;migr&eacute; communities in London, as well as English-based revolutionaries including Karl Marx, with whom Zerffi was in touch in 1852&#150;3. Some years later he was employed by the Department of Science and Art at the South Kensington Museum (Victoria and Albert Museum), and in 1868 was appointed a lecturer at the National Art Training School. He lectured on historic ornament, and published a revised version of his lectures under the title &#145;Historical art studies&#146; in <span class="italic">Building News</span> (1872&#150;6). <span class="italic">A manual of the historical development of art &hellip; with special reference to architecture, sculpture, painting, and ornament</span> appeared in 1876 and went to three editions.<br>
<br>Zerffi was also interested in the philosophy of history, publishing <span class="italic">The Science of History</span> (1879), a work written for Japanese scholars according to instructions prepared by K. Suyematz of Japan. He planned a general work on similar lines, entitled <span class="italic">Studies in the Science of General History</span>, two volumes of which&#151;dealing with ancient and medieval history&#151;came out in 1887 and 1889. He was a member of the council of the Royal Historical Society, for many years, and its chairman between 1880 and 1885; he was also a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.<br>
<br>Zerffi was a popular lecturer and an active member of the British secularist movement. He published many of his lectures delivered to the Sunday Lecture Society, including <span class="italic">Natural Phenomena and their Influence on Different Religious Systems</span> (1873), <span class="italic">Dogma and Science</span> (1876), and <span class="italic">Long and Short Chronologists, or, Egypt from a Religious, Social, and Historical Point of View</span> (1878). His English version of Goethe's <span class="italic">Faust</span>, with critical notes, was published in 1859. <span class="italic">Spiritualism and Animal Magnetism</span> appeared in 1871, and <span class="italic">Immanuel Kant in his Relation to Modern History</span> in 1875. Zerffi died from pneumonia on 28 January 1892 at his home, 2 Albert Villas, Chiswick High Road, Acton, leaving a widow, Josephine, and a son.<br>
