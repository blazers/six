<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Banerjea <span class="st"> [Bandyopadhyay]</span>, Sir  Surendranath</span>  (1848&#150;1925), <span class="occ">politician</span>, the second child of Dr Durgacharan Banerjea, was born in Taltala, Calcutta, on 10 November 1848. Durgacharan, a disciple of David Hare, the philanthropist who helped him to get his medical education, was one of the most successful doctors in the city and a friend of the reformer Vidyasagar, whom he introduced to English education. The tension between the very orthodox Brahmanical family traditions and his father's modernist outlook was an important influence in the development of Surendranath's intellectual and social concerns. Educated at the Parental Academic Institution of Calcutta and Doveton College, Calcutta, after graduation he left for England in the company of R. C. Dutt and Bihari Lal Gupta to sit for the Indian Civil Service examination in 1869. All three were successful in the competition, but Banerjea's appointment was held up as there was doubt regarding his age; his appeal to court on this issue was successful and he was admitted to the service [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95501', "competition wallahs")</script>]. He was appointed assistant magistrate in Sylhet in 1871, but he was suspended and dismissed in 1873 on grounds of negligence. His &#145;crime&#146; was that he had signed an official document which listed a closed case as adjourned. The belief persisted that he was the victim of racism, having incurred the wrath of the local European officials by claiming equality of social status for himself and his wife, Chandidevi, a view indirectly supported by two lieutenant-governors of Bengal. Banerjea went to England to appeal against the decision but was unsuccessful. He joined the Middle Temple to seek qualification as a barrister, but the benchers refused to call him to the bar in view of his dismissal. He returned to Calcutta a disgraced official and was virtually ostracized by local society. Vidyasagar offered him a lectureship in English in Metropolitan College, which he accepted in 1876. This was the beginning of a teaching career which was to last for thirty-seven years, in the course of which he also taught at Free Church College (later renamed Scottish Church College) and at City College (founded by the leaders of the Brahmo Samaj). He established a new college in 1882 which was later named Ripon College.<br>
<br>The first forum of Banerjea's political activity was the Calcutta Students' Association. Ananadamohan Basu, who was inspired by the activities of the Bombay students, was the co-founder of the organization. Banerjea's great fame as a speaker who could electrify his audiences began with his speeches to this association, on subjects such as &#145;The life of Mazzini&#146;, &#145;The rise of the Sikh power&#146;, &#145;Chaitanya&#146;, and &#145;Indian unity&#146;. His purpose was to create a political consciousness and patriotic concern among the students. He held up as his ideal the self-dedication of the Italian nationalists Mazzini and Garibaldi, though he pleaded for constitutional agitation as practised in Britain rather than active, especially armed, resistance. He also underlined the message of radical social change in Chaitanya's teaching which indirectly challenged the caste system, the patriotic fervour of the Sikhs who had defeated the British, and the underlying unity of Indian society. His younger contemporaries bore witness to the consciousness-raising impact of Banerjea's speeches. His purpose, in his own words, was to create among the young men of his country &#145;a genuine, sober and rational interest in public affairs&#146;. The effect of his propaganda went far beyond this restrained objective.<br>
<br>Banerjea felt the need for an institutional base for sustained constitutional agitation. The Indian Association established in 1876 was the product of this concern. Leaders of the Brahmo Samaj were among the enthusiastic sponsors of this organization: the individualistic ideal they upheld in their programme of social and religious reform had a political counterpart in this new initiative. As Bipin Pal, the extremist leader, pointed out, there had really been no serious effort to propagate democratic ideals in India until then. The older British Indian Association was a body restricted to and speaking for the landowners, and the more democratic Indian League enjoyed very little support. The Indian Association thus proved to be the first democratic forum for middle-class Indians. The Brahmoists' insistence on freedom of individual action had created conflicts within Indian society. Those who were attracted by their ideology but were hesitant to face conflict within the family circle could now express their love of freedom through actions which were risk-free. Banerjea's tours of the districts attracted large audiences of up to 30,000 people, and he concentrated on issues such as reduction of the salt tax, the need for trial by jury, freedom of the press, and the end to racial discrimination in the judicial system.<br>
<br>One of the first activities of the Indian Association was its campaign against the British decision to reduce further the age of entrance into the Indian Civil Service, which would have undermined the chances of Indians entering the service. Banerjea's lecture tours in this connection to many parts of India made him aware that there was already a homogeneous class of Indians educated in the same Western system and sharing the same aspirations. The possibility and need for an all-India political organization now became evident to him, as to many others. The <span class="roman">Arms Act</span> and the <span class="roman">Vernacular Press Act</span> passed by the viceroy, Lord Lytton, which took away the Indians' right to carry arms and restricted severely the freedom of the press, led to further agitations that cemented this new awareness. Meanwhile Banerjea had acquired a new instrument for his campaign, the ownership of a weekly paper, <span class="italic">The Bengalee</span>, which he started editing in 1879; it became a daily in 1900. An editorial he wrote criticizing a judge of the Calcutta high court whose action had offended Hindus led to a prosecution for contempt of court and a sentence of imprisonment in 1883, an incident which provoked great resentment throughout the country.<br>
<br>Now more keenly aware than ever of the need for sustained propaganda and agitation both in India and in England, Banerjea took the initiative in setting up a National Fund. His oratorical skills proved of great value in this effort while the British agitation against the <span class="roman">Ilbert Bill</span> (which was designed to bring Europeans in India under the jurisdiction of Indian magistrates) sharpened the sense of political bondage. The old British Indian Association and the more middle-class Indian Association now forgot their differences and merged into the National Conference, which paved the way for the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885. Though he missed the first meeting of the new national organization Banerjea was involved in its activities from the very start, and was twice elected its president (in 1895 and in 1902). He also participated to great effect in the representative institutions of the period, as municipal chairman from 1885 onwards and as a member of the Bengal legislative council for eight years from 1893. In 1890 he went to England as a member of the mission sent by the Congress to plead for an increased measure of representation in the decision-making bodies. He visited England on two more occasions, to give evidence before the Welby commission in 1897 and as a representative of the Indian press at the imperial press conference in 1909.<br>
<br>Banerjea assumed a more confrontational role in the campaign against the partition of Bengal in 1905. He was arrested and fined on charges of leading a banned procession during a conference in the district town of Barisal. Yet as the tension between the moderates and the extremists within the Indian National Congress grew sharper Banerjea found himself firmly on the side of the moderates. On the passing of the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms of 1919 and Gandhi's decision to launch the non-co-operation movement the following year, he was among the leaders who left the Congress organization and co-operated with the reforms. He accepted a knighthood from the British in 1919 and joined the Bengal cabinet as minister for local self-government in 1921. His credibility as a nationalist leader suffered a serious blow through these actions, and he was defeated in the provincial election of 1923 by a young doctor sponsored by C. R. Das, Dr B. C. Roy. For a man who had once been hailed as the uncrowned king of Bengal and the father of national consciousness this was an intolerable humiliation. He died, a broken man, in Calcutta on 6 August 1925.<br>
<br>Despite the rejection he suffered in his last days, when the political situation had undergone a sea change, leaving men of his persuasion entirely isolated, Banerjea's great contribution to the growth of nationalist consciousness in India is universally recognized. His autobiography, <span class="italic">A Nation in Making</span> (1925), is a remarkable account of the emergence of that consciousness.<br>
