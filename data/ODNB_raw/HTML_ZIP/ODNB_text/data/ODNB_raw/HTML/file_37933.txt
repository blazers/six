<span class="headword">Samwell,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1628, <em>d.</em> 1676), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was baptized at Westminster on 14 September 1628, the eldest son of Anthony Samwell (<i>bap</i>. 1604, <i>d</i>. 1656) of Dean's Yard, Westminster, and his wife, Anne Heynes. He was the grandson of Sir William Samwell of Upton Hall, Northamptonshire. He was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1648, and lived in chambers until 1656, but he never practised law. After the Restoration he bought the manor of Watton in Norfolk, and remained its owner until his death. Samwell was a gentleman architect of considerable accomplishment, whose achievement has been undervalued, although John Aubrey considered him &#145;an excellent architect, that has built several delicate howses&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives, Chiefly of Contemporaries, Set Down by John Aubrey, between the Years 1669 and 1696</span>, ed. A. Clark, 1898, 1.293). These were distinguished by the sophistication of their planning, in which a balance was struck between the grand public rooms and convenient private ones. In their exploitation of spatial possibilities, his designs are at least as accomplished as those of the better-known gentleman architects Sir Roger Pratt and Hugh May.<br>
<br>Samwell's first authenticated building, the King's House in Newmarket (1668&#150;71), designed for Charles II, was partly demolished in 1814: the south-east block survives as Palace House Mansion. It was criticized by John Evelyn, visiting in 1670, as &#145;mean enough&#146;, apart from the cellars, &#145;&amp; hardly capable for a hunting house&#146;  (Evelyn, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 542). At Grange Park, Hampshire, built about 1670 for the lawyer Sir Robert Henley, Samwell's house was swallowed up by the neo-classical remodelling by William Wilkins, but despite alterations and the threat of demolition, the shell of his house substantially survives, concealed within the later work. It is on this building, and on his long-demolished Eaton Hall, Cheshire (1675&#150;82), built for Sir Thomas Grosvenor, that any assessment of his work must rest. In both designs he brought to the Restoration house an unexpected elegance of arrangement, combining corner suites in the French manner, comprising bedchamber and closets, the private suites linked with each other by corridors which opened onto grand, formal staircases and provided access directly to the major public rooms. In this sophisticated satisfaction of complex spatial and social requirements, Samwell achieved a synthesis premonitory of the great houses of the eighteenth century. Although at Grange Park Samwell did not introduce to England the Imperial staircase of three open flights, there is little doubt that his was grander than its precursor at Gunnersbury by John Webb.<br>
<br>Samwell's other work included the doubling of the central range of Ham House, Surrey, for John Maitland, first duke of Lauderdale, and his wife, Elizabeth Murray, in 1672&#150;4, to create a plan more in keeping with contemporary expectations of convenience and grandeur, and the addition of a wing for William Windham at Felbrigg Hall, Norfolk (1674&#150;86); both these works survive. Roger North considered the reforming of Ham to be:<blockquote>the best of the kind I have seen &hellip; For I doe not perceive any part of the old fabrick is taken downe, but the wings stand as they were first sett, &hellip; joyned with a strait range intirely new. And there are all the rooms of parade, exquisitely plac'd. (<span class="italic">Of Building: Roger North's Writings on Architecture</span>, ed. H. M. Colvin and J. Newman, 1981, 144)</blockquote>This new range was innovative in incorporating the first large-scale use of the sash-window in England. Samwell was also responsible for the design of a coach house (1673&#150;4; dem.) in the Royal Mews, Charing Cross, commissioned by George Villiers, second duke of Buckingham, master of the horse.<br>
<br>Samwell married Anne (1648&#150;1720), daughter of Sir Denner Strutt of Little Warley, Essex; they had two daughters. He died in London in 1676 and was buried on 23 May at Upton, Northamptonshire, as he had directed in his will.<br>
