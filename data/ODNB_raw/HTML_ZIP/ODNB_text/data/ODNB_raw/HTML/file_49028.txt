<span class="headword">McMullen,  John Franklin</span>  (1820&#150;1897), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 19 May 1820 in Ireland, one of at least three children. His father probably died about 1859. At sixteen McMullen joined the National Bank of Ireland, a newly formed British-owned joint stock bank with a head office in London, as a clerk at its Cork branch. He served as teller and accountant at various branches before being appointed assistant inspector of branches in 1842. Promotion to management of the Waterford branch in 1851 was followed by appointment as an &#145;inspector of the bank&#146; in January 1853 and manager at Cork in October the same year. He resigned on 19 August 1856, having accepted an appointment with the Union Bank of Australia, a leading Anglo-Australian bank which, like the National, was controlled by a London board. McMullen married Beatrice Carnegie at Tipperary, Ireland in 1884 and their nine children were born in Ireland and Australia.<br>
<br>McMullen arrived in Sydney on the <i>Simla</i> on 10 January 1857 and took up his appointment ten days later. Undoubtedly he was appointed to introduce to the Union Bank the skills he had learned in Irish branch banking. As inspector (northern division) of the Union Bank of Australia he was responsible for all branches in New South Wales, Queensland, and New Zealand, and worked jointly with the inspector (southern division), each being separately responsible to the London board. The problems that this system generated were obviated by his appointment in 1859 as inspector and general manager solely responsible for the Australian and New Zealand operations of the bank. At the beginning of his career with the Union Bank he was &#145;feared and even hated, though his ruthless efficiency was respected&#146;  (Butlin, 151). Scathingly critical of the staff when he assumed office, McMullen instituted a clean-up, dismissing and downgrading managers for incompetence and lack of drive. He was to suffer from this same failing towards the end of his twenty-eight years as chief executive.<br>
<br>During McMullen's administration the Union Bank grew substantially, but he was slow to open new branches, resulting in a loss of market share. Important initiatives were the establishment of the Melbourne Clearing House in 1867 and the introduction of a staff pension and guarantee fund. McMullen also unwittingly set the scene for the banking disasters of the 1890s when in 1863 he urged the board to approve the taking of London deposits. The Union Bank was prudent in handling these deposits, but other banks copied the idea with dire results. McMullen was aware of the difficulties the boom years of the 1880s would bring to the Australian economy and this, together with age and illness, made him more conservative and cautious in expanding the Union's business. However, his successors inherited a business well able to withstand the shock of the 1890s. His strict control over the bank's colonial policy and his failure to delegate caused alarm to the board, particularly when he resisted calls for reorganization of the colonial administration. He grew suspicious of the skills of his own managerial appointees and fell out with a number of his executives. Summoned to London for discussions with the directors (his fourth trip) he tendered his resignation on the grounds of ill health before he could be taken to task. He retired on 24 May 1887. In 1889 he was nevertheless offered, and accepted, a seat on the bank's London board; but he resigned in 1891, again because of ill health.<br>
<br>McMullen was a tall, solid man, with a receding hairline coiffeured in the Regency manner, and he gave the appearance of the authority which was to be expected of an Irish squire. A member of the influential Melbourne Club from 1868 and domineering chairman of the Associated Banks, Victoria, from 1882 until his retirement, his influence on the Australian banking world nevertheless faded fast and his death went unnoticed in Australian newspapers and banking journals. After retirement McMullen lived in England and Ireland, probably as a widower, with no fixed address, and visited Australia. He died at Brewster's Hotel, Lower Baggot Street, Dublin, on 23 June 1897, aged seventy-seven.<br>
