<span class="headword">Kidgell,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1722, <em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1780), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and political writer</span>, was baptized on 28 April 1722 at St Mary Woolnoth, London, the son of John Kidgell of St Mary Woolchurch. He was admitted to Winchester College in 1733, and matriculated at Hertford College, Oxford, on 21 March 1741, graduating BA in 1744 and MA in 1747. He was briefly a fellow of Hertford.<br>
<br>Kidgell was ordained a priest, but paid little attention to his duties. He was chaplain to a fellow Wykehamist, William Douglas, third earl of March and from 1778 fourth duke of Queensberry (1725&#150;1810), a man whose dissoluteness matched his own. He stayed in London with Lord March, living as a man about town. Horace Walpole describes him as a &#145;dainty, priggish parson, much in vogue among the old ladies for his gossiping and quaint sermons&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Last Journals</span>, 1.247). Preferment gradually accumulated. In 1756 he was assistant preacher to the bishop of Bangor, in December 1758 he became rector of Woolverston, Suffolk, and by 1761 he was morning preacher at the Berkeley Chapel, London. On 7 May 1762 he was instituted to the rectory of Godstone, Surrey (in the gift of John Garth, esquire, of Devizes, Wiltshire), and on 8 June following to that of Horne in the same county by Sir Kendrick Clayton.<br>
<br>Kidgell's embroilment in the Wilkes affair wrecked his career in the Church of England. How far he acted on his own initiative and how far at March's behest remains hard to determine, for his chronic indebtedness had rendered him financially dependent on the peer, his principal patron. In June 1763 Kidgell obtained proofs of the notorious <span class="italic">Essay on Woman</span> from one of Wilkes's printers (Michael Curry) and money changed hands. Kidgell insisted to the printers that his plan was merely to answer the <span class="italic">Essay</span> by a series of letters in the press, but it was at this point that March stepped in, he having been in secret consultation with John Montagu, fourth earl of Sandwich, and probably with other members of the administration. Kidgell was ordered to &#145;endeavour to discover how much of the work was printed off, and to obtain if possible a copy thereof&#146;  (Guildhall Library, MS 214, vol. 2, fol. 104) so that the government could build a watertight case against Wilkes for obscene libel. Sandwich duly moved in the Lords that Wilkes be voted the author of the <span class="italic">Essay</span>, and Kidgell found himself damned as a sordid informer on all sides.<br>
<br>Ignoring the advice of the Treasury solicitor, Philip Carteret Webb, Kidgell then attempted to justify his conduct (and that of the government) with <span class="italic">A genuine and succinct narrative of a scandalous, obscene, and exceedingly profane libel, entitled &#145;An essay on woman&#146;, etc.</span> (1763). He told Richard Phelps that, in so doing, he had &#145;the approbation, directions, &amp; corrections of the Earl of Sandwich&#146;  (NMM, SAN v/14 No. 73, 23 Dec 1763). This text, with its show of righteous indignation, ended any chance he had of securing the wealthy rectory of St James's, Piccadilly, through the good offices of Sandwich, who had swiftly and entirely disassociated himself from Kidgell. His pleas of innocence were received incredulously. Many pamphlets abused and condemned him as a hypocrite priest and prostitute writer, who had publicly offended &#145;the cause of Decency&#146; by his conduct  (<span class="italic">An Expostulatory Letter</span>, 9). Walpole, who called him &#145;that dirty dog&#146;  (to Hertford, 22 Jan 1764, Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 38.294), noted how &#145;He has been pelted in every newspaper, while the work itself [<span class="italic">An Essay on Woman</span>] was forgot&#146;  (to Sir Horace Mann, 8 Jan 1764, Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 22.195). John Almon put the case succinctly: &#145;Can the people of England behold such an act, and however they may detest the <span class="italic">Essay on Woman</span>, not detest and abhor the means by which it was procured?&#146;  (Almon, 14).<br>
<br>Kidgell fled the country, carrying with him the funds of the Godstone turnpike (which he tried subsequently to explain) some time after being publicly abused during the trial of Wilkes for seditious libel. He lived initially in the United Provinces, and kept a school in Utrecht to support his family. Between 1766 and 1768 he was writing regularly to Lord March, adamant that he had crossed the channel to avoid the earl's reputation being ruined and hinting strongly at court action unless March paid off his debts. Kidgell was racked by guilt and anger, talked of a forgery introduced into Wilkes's papers, and even wanted to obtain forgiveness from Wilkes personally. March would not be browbeaten and Kidgell was obliged to entreat his pardon for any intemperate words, and his &#145;making intercession for the most contemptible of men&#146;  (6 May 1768, Guildhall Library, MS 214, vol. 3, fol. 43). Meanwhile, in June 1766 the churchwarden of Horne, spurred on by Sir Kendrick Clayton, unsuccessfully instituted proceedings against him in the court of arches for non-residence. Kidgell died <i>c</i>.1780 in poverty, his successor as incumbent at Godstone being presented in May that year. His letter of 3 August 1766 to March explains that he is married and has dependants but nothing more is known about his wife and family.<br>
<br>Kidgell published (anonymously) <span class="italic">The Card</span> (2 vols., 1755), a series of tales partly in epistolary form, and <span class="italic">Original Fables</span> (1763), in English and French, both for private circulation. In the <span class="italic">Oxford Sausage</span> (1764, 119&#150;24) there are some amusing lines by him called &#145;Table Talk&#146;, written in 1745. But Kidgell will always be remembered for his conduct over Wilkes and <span class="italic">An Essay on Woman</span>. Charles Churchill placed him high among the infamous in his gallery of satiric portraits, assailing Kidgell with deep irony in &#145;The Author&#146; (391&#150;8):<blockquote>
<div>Are these the arts which policy supplies?<br>
</div>
<div>Are these the steps by which grave churchmen rise?<br>
</div>
<div>Forbid it, Heaven; or, should it turn out so,<br>
</div>
<div>Let me and mine continue mean and low.<br>
</div>
<div>Such be their arts whom interest controls;<br>
</div>
<div>Kidgell and I have free and modest souls:<br>
</div>
<div>We scorn preferment which is gain'd by sin,<br>
</div>
<div>And will, though poor without, have peace within.<br>
</div> (Churchill, <span class="italic">Poems</span>)</blockquote>Kidgell was essentially a weak man who was, nevertheless, honest enough to admit that want of &#145;experience and discretion&#146;  (to March, n.d., Guildhall Library, MS 214, vol. 3, fol. 11) had been his undoing.<br>
