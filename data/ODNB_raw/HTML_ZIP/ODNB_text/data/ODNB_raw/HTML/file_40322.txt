<span class="headword">Hay,  John MacDougall</span>  (1879&#150;1919), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and novelist</span>, was born on 23 October 1879 in Tarbert, Loch Fyne, son of Mary MacDougall and George Hay, a steamship agent. He was educated at Tarbert high school and at the University of Glasgow, where he studied natural and moral philosophy and English literature. He graduated in 1900, and became the headmaster of the Lionel public school, Ness, Lewis, later moving to teach in Ullapool. There, during a bout of rheumatic fever, he decided to enter the Church of Scotland ministry, returning to Glasgow to study divinity in 1905. He gained a first in church history and biblical criticism.<br>
<br>Hay was an intense individual, deeply exercised by the content of his studies. His relentless search for a solution to the problems of evil and suffering was conducted within a tortured Christian profession. Though subject to profound inner struggle, informed by a sharp intellect and a vibrant imagination, he was well liked by contemporaries, one of whom remembered him as &#145;quiet and reserved, almost shy, &hellip; a man gifted beyond the ordinary, and on the rare occasions when he did talk he never lacked eager listeners&#146;  (<span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>).<br>
<br>From his undergraduate days, and particularly during his theological training, Hay helped support himself by writing for newspapers and journals such as <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">Chambers</span>, <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>, and the <span class="italic">Glasgow Evening News</span>, whose influential editor, Neil Munro, he later met. As natives of Argyll both men studied the mingling of highland Gaelic and lowland Scottish cultures in that area.<br>
<br>After finishing his divinity studies Hay became a student missionary at Morven and was licensed by the presbytery of Inveraray in 1908. He moved to an urban parish which had Argyll connections and became assistant minister at Govan old parish church. In 1909 he was ordained and moved to a charge in Elderslie, a similarly urban parish near Paisley, Renfrewshire, to which he did not feel wholly suited; he would have preferred a highland parish. On 28 October 1909 he married Catherine Campbell (<i>b</i>. 1882/3), daughter of Janet McMillan and Duncan Campbell, a minister. They had two children: Sheena (<i>b</i>. 1911) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40321/', "George Campbell Hay (1915&#150;1984)")</script>, who later became a distinguished Gaelic poet.<br>
<br>John MacDougall Hay's first novel, <span class="italic">Gillespie</span>, was published in 1914 and dedicated to Neil Munro. Though its impact was blunted by the onset of the First World War, <span class="italic">Gillespie</span> never entirely disappeared from view. The novel is set in the small fishing community of Brieston, based on Tarbert, Loch Fyne. This poor, hard-working, and gossip-ridden community is dominated by Gillespie Strang, an unscrupulous capitalist. <span class="italic">Gillespie</span>'s characterization and setting demonstrate that the seminal influence on Hay's work was George Douglas Brown's <span class="italic">The House with the Green Shutters</span>. Both works were regarded by contemporary literary critics as a welcome counterblast against the sentimental Scottish fiction of the kailyard school. Unlike Brown, however, Hay takes a religious stance. <span class="italic">Gillespie</span> grapples with problems of severe religious doubt expressed in the terrifying nightmares of Gillespie's son, Eoghan, who seeks some creed which will enable him to condemn his father but remain just. The Christ of the gospels seems to offer him this, but Christ's ethic, though deeply attractive, seems powerless against the suffering which Brieston endures in the tragedy of the plague and at the hands of Gillespie. In <span class="italic">Gillespie</span> a weak Christ cannot modify the overwhelming presence of fate, which is the strongest spiritual reality in the novel, deriving its potency from the superstitious highland background of Eoghan's grandmother.<br>
<br>After the publication of <span class="italic">Gillespie</span> Hay considered leaving the ministry to take up a career in writing, but did not carry the idea through. He published another novel, <span class="italic">Barnacles</span> (1916), set around Elderslie and Paisley. In it the struggle between good and evil in its religious dimension is more obvious. Barnacles is a holy fool whose innocence and goodness help save the heroine from the horrific abuse of an evil husband. The violence in the novel is disproportionate to the motivations of the characters and, although derangement accounts for the power of the scenes, it is not one of the novel's ostensible themes. Hay's writing was not always under his literary control.<br>
<br>Hay planned a third novel, <span class="italic">The Martyr</span>, and published a volume of free verse poetry entitled <span class="italic">Their Dead Sons</span> (1918). In 1919 &#145;The Agony and after&#146;, his sermon commemorating the fallen, was published at the request of his congregation. In it Hay flounders between anguished descriptions and fine writing about the fallen and the meaningfulness of their deaths, &#145;They won their victories with their knees in the mud, but the sacrifice of their lives was the purest victory of the spirit&#146;  (&#145;The Agony and after&#146;, 22). These works show Hay's continuing struggle with the problem of evil, particularly in the aftermath of the carnage of the First World War. However, Hay's affirmation of the doctor in <span class="italic">Gillespie</span> who cares for the poor and the plague victims demonstrates the move from a religious to a secular outlook which was to characterize the Scottish novel in the twentieth century.<br>
<br>A victim of poor health, Hay remained a parish minister until his death at the manse, Elderslie, from tuberculosis on 10 December 1919, aged forty. He was buried at the abbey cemetery, Elderslie, on 13 December. His early death, though not unexpected, was felt to be a literary loss and, taken together with George Douglas Brown's similarly early death in 1902, denied Scotland the mature vision of two of its most promising writers of the period.<br>
