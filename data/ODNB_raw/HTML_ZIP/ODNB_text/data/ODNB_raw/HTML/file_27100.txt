<span class="headword">Teeling,  Bartholomew</span>  (1774&#150;1798), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist</span>, was born at Lisburn, co. Antrim, the eldest son of Luke Teeling, a linen merchant, and his wife, Mary, the daughter of John Taaffe of Smarmore Castle, co. Louth. He had at least two younger brothers, <a name="cosubject_27100"></a><span class="headword">Charles Hamilton Teeling</span>  (1778&#150;1850), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor</span>, and George. The family business prospered in the 1780s, and Luke Teeling became a figurehead in the Catholic business community in Antrim. In December 1792 he attended the Catholic Convention as one of the Antrim delegates and spoke passionately in favour of demanding full Catholic emancipation from the British government, now that the Catholic position had been strengthened by the support of Belfast's United Irishmen, with whom Luke was in close contact. His speech was enthusiastically received and the motion carried, but the convention secured only extension of the franchise to Catholics, in the <span class="roman">Relief Act</span> of 1793. <br>
<br>Bartholomew was educated in Dublin at the academy of the Revd W. Dubourdieu, a French protestant minister, where he became proficient in French. Before the age of twenty he joined the United Irishmen and his family became ever more closely associated with the movement. In the summer of 1795 Charles travelled through Antrim, Derry, Tyrone, Fermanagh, Leitrim, and Westmeath, drumming up support for the Catholic Defenders. Bartholomew made his own recruiting journey on foot through Ireland and was influential enough to become a member of the national executive committee of the United Irishmen soon after it was set up towards the end of 1796. By then both his brother and his father were in gaol, having been arrested on 16 September 1796 by Lord Castlereagh on suspicion of treason. Luke was confined in Carrickfergus prison until 1802 but Charles appears to have escaped, for, according to his own account, he was on the run together with his brother-in-law, John Maginnis, and Alexander Lowry early in 1797. <br>
<br>As one of the representatives of Ulster United Irishmen, Bartholomew attended a United Irish meeting in Dublin in early June 1797 to discuss plans for a rising. On returning to Ulster, he and his fellow delegates met resistance from their military leaders in Antrim, who refused to act without guaranteed assistance from the French. Learning that warrants had been issued for their arrest, Teeling and his fellow militants fled Ireland. He travelled via England to Hamburg, where he arrived on 13 July with instructions to check that the Dutch fleet under the command of General Hoche was preparing to set sail for Ireland. He reassured the United Irish leadership in Ulster that all was in order, but by the autumn the situation had dramatically changed, following Hoche's sudden death and the defeat of the Dutch fleet at the battle of Camperdown. Teeling's letter from Paris, where he was then based, to inform his Dublin contacts of the two disasters was crucially intercepted by the Irish authorities. <br>
<br>In Paris, Teeling's friend Theobald Wolfe Tone procured him a commission in the French army. In the summer of 1798 Teeling, together with Tone's brother Matthew, was sent to join General Humbert's force at Rochefort, one of three fleets preparing to invade Ireland. Appointed aide-de-camp and interpreter to Humbert, Teeling set sail with more than a thousand men who made up Humbert's attack and landed at Killala on 22 August. A misguided campaign ensued: Humbert marched his troops southwards to capture the garrison at Castlebar, thereby losing precious time, and doubled back via Collooney to Ballinamuck, where they met the crown's forces under Cornwallis. The battle on 8 September was short and Humbert soon surrendered. Teeling and Matthew Tone were taken to Dublin, where they were court-martialled and sentenced to death. Although Humbert intervened on Teeling's behalf and praised him for his attempts to prevent the rebel troops from pillaging and carrying out revenge attacks, the lord lieutenant denied the plea for mercy. Teeling was hanged at Arbour Hill prison in Dublin on 24 September 1798. A century later a memorial to him was erected at Carricknagat, near Collooney, where he had distinguished himself in battle on 5 September. <br>
<br>Charles Teeling remained in Ulster during the 1798 rising and its aftermath, and in 1802 he settled at Dundalk as a linen bleacher. In the same year he married a Miss Carolan of Carrickmacross, co. Monaghan. Later he became proprietor of the <span class="italic">Belfast Northern Herald</span> and moved to Newry, where he established the <span class="italic">Newry Examiner</span>. From 1832 to 1835 he also owned and edited a monthly periodical, the <span class="italic">Ulster Magazine</span>. In 1828 he published his <span class="italic">Personal narrative of the &#145;Irish rebellion&#146; of 1798</span>; a <span class="italic">Sequel</span> appeared in 1832. His history is particularly valuable for its description of the Catholic Defender movement in Ulster before 1798 and its relations with the United Irishmen, as well as for its description of the rising in Ulster. Teeling also published an alternative account of the battle of the Diamond in 1795 between the Catholic Defenders and protestant Peep o' Day Boys that led to the formation of the Orange order. Teeling died in Dublin in 1850. His eldest daughter Mary married Thomas O'Hagan, first Baron O'Hagan, in 1836.<br>
