<span class="headword">Wilkinson,  Charles Smith</span>  (1843&#150;1891), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born at Potterspury, Northamptonshire, on 22 August 1843, the fourth son of David Wilkinson, civil engineer, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bliss. He early gained enthusiasm for geology from his uncle, a Gloucestershire quarryman. After the family migrated to Melbourne, Australia, in 1852, he attended T. P. Fenner's Collegiate School and, from 1859, was employed by the geological survey of Victoria, carrying out geological mapping in various parts of the colony. He published on the formation of nuggets and experimented on the treatment of ores.<br>
<br>In 1868 lung inflammation caused Wilkinson's resignation from the survey, and he moved to Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, to recover. In 1871 he moved to Sydney, where he became a licensed surveyor in that colony's surveyor-general's department. The previous year to a royal commission on the goldfields he made a case for the close relations between geology and mining, recommending the formation of a department of mines. Appointed geological surveyor in the department of lands in 1874, he transferred to the newly created department of mines in the following January and formed a geological survey. Following the work of Samuel Stutchbury and W. B. Clarke, he began systematic mapping, publishing the first geological map of New South Wales in 1880. Wilkinson travelled widely in the colony, as government geologist and for the prospecting board, and encouraged the development of a mining museum to educate the public and assist prospectors.<br>
<br>On 4 May 1887 Wilkinson married Eliza Jane Leitch at Berry Jerry near Wagga Wagga; there were two sons from the marriage. Although often absent from Sydney, Wilkinson was active in the colony's cultural life as an office holder in scientific bodies and a commissioner for international and intercolonial exhibitions. He was a fellow of the Geological and Linnean societies of London, and the Victoria Institute, the last-named reflecting his interest in the relations between science and religion, about which he frequently lectured. Wilkinson died of cancer at Burwood, Sydney, on 26 August 1891, cutting short a fine career as geologist and administrator. He was buried in the Anglican cemetery at Enfield, Sydney, the next day. Tall and with a handsome presence, Wilkinson was liked and admired as an unostentatious but enthusiastic worker, and his more than ninety maps and reports remain widely used a hundred years after his death. He produced numerous articles for the popular press, and at his home gave classes on geology for working men. He is remembered in the names of numerous fossils.<br>
