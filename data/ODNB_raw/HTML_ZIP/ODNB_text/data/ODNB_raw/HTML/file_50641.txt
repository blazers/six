<span class="headword">Burroughs,  (Silas) Mainville</span>  (1846&#150;1895), <span class="occ">manufacturing chemist</span>, was born on 24 December 1846, in Medina, New York state, United States of America. His family was influential and wealthy, his father, Silas Mainville Burroughs (1810&#150;1860), being a lawyer and US congressman. His education was in his native state, and an uncle in Medina reportedly instilled business sense in him. After leaving school he worked in New York state, as an apprentice to the merchant store of E. T. Coann in Albion for two years and subsequently for the drug stores of T. J. Chadwick in Lockport and S. H. T. Champlin in Buffalo. About 1873 he was employed by Wyeth &amp; Brother of Philadelphia, and evidently continued to work for them while he studied at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, from where he graduated in 1877. His thesis demonstrated his early interest in new methods of producing compressed medicines.<br>
<br>In 1878 Burroughs went to London as Wyeths' European agent, intending to stay for about six months. He soon saw that there was much potential in the pharmaceutical industry overseas, and employed his own capital to establish a company which he intended would become a world trader in supplying pharmaceuticals. In May 1878 S. M. Burroughs &amp; Co. was established, first in Southampton Street, Strand, London, and soon after at 92&#150;3 Great Russell Street and in the basement of 1 Cock Lane in the City. In 1879 the company moved to 8 Snow Hill, Holborn.<br>
<br>Initially Burroughs concentrated on introducing American pharmaceuticals to doctors and dentists in the UK by travelling and advertising and by making contacts with hospitals and pharmacists. He soon realized that he needed a reliable hand to manage the business while he was travelling, and in January 1879 invited <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36824/', "Henry Solomon Wellcome")</script>, also a pharmaceutical salesman and some seven years Burroughs's junior, to join him. They probably met in the mid-1870s, although the first existing correspondence dates from 1877. During 1879 Burroughs continued to invite Wellcome, currently working for McKesson and Robbins of New York, to England. &#145;I think that we can make big fortunes over here if we work things right and we ought to know how to do this with our combined experience&#146; he wrote on 30 August 1879; and again &#145;You are the only man I want to pull with, and we have confidence in each other's ability and straightforwardness&#146; (20 October 1879). Wellcome arrived in England in April 1880 with agency rights for McKesson and Robbins. Subsequent negotiations by Burroughs with that company led to mutually agreed terms for the articles of partnership between Burroughs and Wellcome to be signed on 27 September for the establishment of Burroughs, Wellcome &amp; Co. Under that deed Burroughs put up &pound;1200 and Wellcome &pound;800 (of which he could contribute only &pound;400, borrowing the rest from Burroughs at 10 per cent annual interest).<br>
<br>From October 1881 to March 1884, Burroughs, carrying quantities of samples, undertook a world tour of Europe, Egypt, India, Ceylon and Burma, Australia, New Zealand, and the US, promoting the firm, establishing new markets, and making valuable contacts which laid the foundation of the company's foreign markets. Early business was mostly derived from its agency sales, but the company started to manufacture certain products near Snow Hill, London, in 1882, and opened manufacturing works in Wandsworth the following year. The range of products expanded and sold well, largely because of the firm's high standard and excellent publicity; it produced medicine chests for prominent figures including W. E. Gladstone and Sir Henry Morton Stanley, the latter of whom was greatly admired by both men. Early in 1884 the firm moved into larger premises on a prominent site at Snow Hill Buildings, Holborn Viaduct, and the same year the company registered the trade mark &#145;tabloid&#146;.<br>
<br>The first cracks in the friendship between Burroughs and his partner surfaced in 1882, when Burroughs, an impulsive and often imprudent man, requested Wellcome to postpone his rights to increase his capital holding as specified in the partnership agreement. Further differences emerged in correspondence over Burroughs's proposed engagement to Olive Augusta Chase of western New York state, when Burroughs asked if the business prospects were such that they would warrant his marriage and Wellcome advised against a hasty move. Burroughs, however, married Olive in the USA early in 1884, returning with her to London briefly before setting out for a tour of Europe. They had a son and two daughters. Relations between the partners became increasingly strained, but a new partnership was negotiated in May 1885 after which Burroughs returned to the United States for the rest of the year. Further disputes led to litigation in 1887, 1889, and 1891.<br>
<br>In spite of these strains, the company thrived: it ended the agreement with Wyeths and moved its own manufactory to Dartford in 1889. Burroughs purchased the Dartford mills and leased them to the company (the cause of legal wrangles after his death), and played a key part in introducing progressive working conditions. Strongly influenced by Henry George, the proponent of free trade and a single tax on land values, Burroughs publicized and implemented these views, introducing an eight-hour working day and a profit-sharing system, based on a fixed percentage of the profits, and encouraging social activities by the Dartford workers. Burroughs was a staunch Presbyterian, regularly attending lunchtime services at the City Temple, and believing in a society that approached socialist ideals. He wrote a short work called <span class="italic">A Strange Dream</span>, forecasting an ideal state where the principles of religion were the basis of contracts between capital and labour, and had 60,000 copies of George's <span class="italic">Protection of Free Trade</span> printed and sent throughout Europe. He was a strong supporter of the cause of international arbitration and peace and of socialist and labour clubs, chaired the Dartford Radical and Liberal Association, was a committee member of the Tenant Tradesmen's National Union, and a member of several political pressure groups including the City Liberal (&#145;a bit stiff&#146;), and the United Democratic clubs. He also believed in free travel and that free railways would be a means of untying the knot of town life. Burroughs's political interests may have been one reason for his taking British nationality in May 1890, it being reported that &#145;he has now lived so long in this country, is so completely identified with its interests, and takes so deep a concern in its social welfare, that his adoption of its nationality is not to be wondered at&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chemist and Druggist</span>, 17 May 1890).<br>
<br>Burroughs, who was a teetotaller, had a reputation for boundless energy and even his recreation pursuit of cycling made demands on him. His health suffered, possibly as a result of over-zealous work, and in December 1894 he caught a severe cold and was advised by doctors to winter abroad for his health. He travelled to the Riviera and soon recovered from his cold, but on 3 February 1895, while out cycling wearing a thin jacket, he caught a chill which resulted in pleurisy and rapidly developed into pneumonia. He died on 6 February at the Hotel Windsor in Monte Carlo with his sister Mrs Riggs beside him, but before his wife, travelling from London, could reach him. He was buried in Monte Carlo two days later. A service was held at Dartford parish church with a special train laid on to bring mourners from London.<br>
<br>Obituaries were unanimous in emphasizing the strong impression Burroughs made on those who met him. He had a handsome, well-dressed appearance, was of moderate height with piercing blue eyes, with an open and lively manner, considerable charm and humour; he was a good speaker, with boundless enthusiasm. He was without affectation or snobbishness and he delighted in mixing with all classes. He was generous to a fault (on his death promissory notes and IOUs in his possession amounted to more than &pound;7000) and notoriously open-handed in supporting individuals and organizations of many different political and religious persuasions. He left one twenty-fourth of his estate to be equally divided among all employees of Burroughs, Wellcome &amp; Co., and made many other charitable legacies. Although negotiations for a dissolution of the partnership were under way when Burroughs died, the agreement with Wellcome still stood and Olive Burroughs was obliged to sell Wellcome her interest in the company.<br>
