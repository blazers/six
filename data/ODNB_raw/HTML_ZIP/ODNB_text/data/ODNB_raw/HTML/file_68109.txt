<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Singleton,  Henry</span>  (1682&#150;1759), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the fourth son of Edward Singleton, alderman of Drogheda, co. Louth, and member of parliament for that town. He went to school in Drogheda, matriculated from Dublin University in 1698, entered the Inner Temple in 1702, and graduated as bachelor of arts in 1703. He was called to the Irish bar in 1707. In the same year his sister married Robert Lindsay, later judge of the Irish common pleas. Singleton is mentioned as recorder of Drogheda in 1708, and was returned as its MP in 1713 and in 1715.<br>
<br>In politics Singleton was a tory, a friend of the Foster family of Drogheda, and also of Dean Swift and of Bishop Berkeley. He became prime serjeant, the chief law officer in Ireland, in 1726 and acted continuously as a justice of assize. Returned as MP for Drogheda and Dunleer, in 1727 he elected to sit for Drogheda. He was strongly supported for the position of speaker of the Irish Commons in 1733. In the following year he received an honorary LLD from Trinity College, Dublin. He was appointed chief justice of the Irish court of common pleas in 1740; this was seen as a victory for the Irish bar at the time, since it was then common to appoint Englishmen to the Irish bench. There was no question of his qualification for the post; he had been a barrister for over thirty years, a member of the Irish House of Commons for over twenty-five years, and the chief law officer for fourteen years. He was also sworn of the privy council. In 1753 he surrendered his seat as chief justice, and in 1754 he became master of the rolls (not a judicial office in Ireland at this time).<br>
<br>According to a report in the <span class="italic">Dublin Evening Post</span> of 14 June 1740:<blockquote>although to those who did not enjoy a close acquaintance he appeared proud and haughty &hellip; [Singleton] was far from deserving that character, and such was his benevolence that within a few weeks of his elevation to the bench, he is mentioned as having expended over four hundred pounds in purchasing oatmeal for the inhabitants of Drogheda, who were suffering, in common with the whole of Ireland, from the terrible famine by which the country was then devastated. (Ball, 2.131)</blockquote>He was fortunate to survive the subsequent fever, which in 1741 carried off two of his contemporaries on the bench, John Rogerson, chief justice of the king's bench, and John Wainwright, baron of the exchequer.<br>
<br>Singleton died, unmarried, in 1759; he was buried on 12 November in Drogheda in St Peter's Church, where there is a memorial to him, erected by his nephew Sydenham Singleton. The memorial, which includes a bust, was made in 1787 in London by John Hickey, an Irishman and sculptor to the prince of Wales. He lived in Dublin in Jervis Street, in Drogheda in Lawrence Street, and near Dublin at Drumcondra in Belvedere House, which he leased from Sir Marmaduke Coghill, judge of the prerogative court and later chancellor of the exchequer. His house in Lawrence Street, Drogheda, became Drogheda grammar school; in 1989, despite its being a listed building, it was demolished by an impatient and unscrupulous developer. The development company was later prosecuted and subsequently the judge ordered that the parts of the demolished building be preserved so that the house might be reconstructed at some time in the future  (<span class="italic">Irish Times</span>, 24 Aug 1989). His law library, mostly manuscript works, was acquired by Columbia University, New York, in 1937. It includes a notebook of cases (MS 71) in the Irish courts of chancery and exchequer heard in the years 1716 to 1734, in which Singleton appeared as prime serjeant.<br>
