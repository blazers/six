<span class="headword">Sheringham,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1604&#150;1678), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, was a son of William Sheringham of Guestwick, Norfolk, and his wife, Elizabeth; he had at least one sister. He was educated at Norwich under Mr Briggs, and entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, as a pensioner on 15 March 1619. He proceeded BA in 1623 and MA in 1626, and was incorporated in the same degree at Oxford on 15 July 1628. Ordained deacon at Peterborough on 28 March 1626 and priest on 29 June, he was elected a fellow of his Cambridge college in the same year. In 1634 he was presented to the rectory of Patesley in Norfolk, a living in the gift of Caius, but he was not resident. In the early years of his fellowship he occupied various posts. He acted as Greek lecturer in 1630, Hebrew lecturer in 1633, and dean in 1642, and in 1644 he was elected one of the proctors of Cambridge University. In the following year he issued his first publication, the text of two elegant sermons delivered at St Mary's, Cambridge, on <span class="roman">Psalm</span> 41: 4.<br>
<br>In 1648 Sheringham proved himself an accomplished Hebraist with the publication of a Latin translation of the Mishnaic tractate on priests and sacrifices, <span class="italic">Joma</span>. It coincided with a plan devised in the circle of Samuel Hartlib, John Amos Comenius, and John Durie to make lesser known Hebrew sources more widely available. Sheringham, however, proceeded independently. His work is a landmark in Hebrew studies. In his preface he presents an eloquent defence of the rabbinic writings and their use for Christian biblicists, and stresses the debt of the gospels to a Jewish tradition which can best be discovered by studying the <span class="roman">Talmud</span>. His edition was inferior to the Mishnaic tractates about to be produced at Oxford under the supervision of Edward Pococke, but it remains a pioneering work which marks the beginning of an ever more sophisticated English treatment of Jewish writings. It was reprinted in the Netherlands in 1696, edited by Jacob Rhenferd, one of the foremost experts on the ancient languages of the Near East, of which he was professor at the University of Franeker.<br>
<br>Sheringham was deeply committed to the royalist cause. He dedicated his edition of the <span class="italic">Joma</span> to a prominent royalist, the mathematician Sir John Heydon, also from Norfolk. In 1651, after refusing to submit to parliament, Sheringham forfeited his fellowship at Caius and departed for the Netherlands. He would seem to have made preparations for his arrival in the previous year as the college registers show that he left Cambridge at the end of October 1649. He may have gone first to London, but he matriculated as a student of medicine at the University of Leiden on 4 March 1650. By November he was back at Caius and was still in England in February of the following year.<br>
<br>In the Netherlands, besides other scholarly refugees such as Thomas Marshall, he found a friend in Sir Edward Nicholas, the former secretary of state. By May 1653 he was in The Hague, temporarily acting as chaplain to Charles I's daughter Mary, who was married to the prince of Orange. Subsequently Sheringham moved to Rotterdam, where he gave tuition to fellow emigrants in Hebrew, Arabic, Aramaic, and Syriac. One of his pupils, Thomas Cawton the younger, the son of the minister of the English church, proceeded to the University of Utrecht in 1657 with what was regarded as a remarkable command of the languages which Sheringham had taught him.<br>
<br>In his first years in the Netherlands, Sheringham composed his justification of royal absolutism warranted, he claimed, by the statutes, common law, and ancient customs of England, <span class="italic">The kings supremacy asserted, or, A remonstrance of the kings right against the pretended parliament</span>. In 1653 Nicholas sent a copy to Edward Hyde, saying it is &#145;well worth your perusal, notwithstanding you have read and written much on the same subject&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nicholas Papers</span>, 2.14). Containing an extensive critique of Philip Hunton's <span class="italic">Treatise of Monarchy</span> the work was intended to serve as a weapon against the parliamentary agents in the Low Countries. Sheringham had originally hoped to publish it in Dutch, but it appeared in English in 1660, dedicated to Charles II. It was reprinted again in 1682.<br>
<br>With the Restoration, Sheringham returned to Cambridge and was re-elected to his fellowship at Caius. In July 1663 he described himself in a letter to Thomas Marshall as &#145;being at the University, but living for the most part in London&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Marshall 134, fol. 16). He later spent more time in his college, where he was appointed catechist in 1666, 1672, and 1673 and Hebrew lecturer again from 1674 to 1677. His main work, <span class="italic">De Anglorum gentis origine</span>, appeared in 1670. Based on a vast assortment of Gothic and early English sources, it argues for the descent of the English from the Getae, whom Sheringham, like many of his contemporaries, identified with the Goths. Rejecting the widespread idea that they were descended from Noah's son Japhet, however, he maintained that they were the descendants of Shem, had moved from Scythia to Scandinavia, had then emigrated to the Baltic and Germany, and had gone from there to Asia and back to Germany. Although the work was never reprinted it was quoted with respect by James Tyrrell in 1698, Thomas Herne in 1744, and David Wilkins in 1748. But by 1770 Thomas Percy was critical of Sheringham's inability &#145;to distinguish what is true and credible from what is improbable and fabulous in the old Northern Chronicles. Because some parts are true, he receives all for authentic&#146;  (Mallet, viii).<br>
<br>At Cambridge, Sheringham was greatly admired as a linguist, his knowledge of Gothic and other Germanic languages as well as the Semitic ones drawing high praise from John Gostlin, the future vice-master of Caius. On 17 April 1678 Sheringham drew up his will &#145;sick in body&#146;, bequeathing most of his library to his college  (will, 166). He had already presented Caius with a fine fifteenth-century manuscript, probably written by the Chaucerian copyist Shirley and containing works by Richard Rolle (Gonville and Caius College, MS 669/646), and a copy of the liturgical acts and epistles printed in Church Slavonic in Moscow in 1564. At some point during the next two weeks he died in his rooms in college and was buried at the church of St Michael on 2 May 1678.<br>
