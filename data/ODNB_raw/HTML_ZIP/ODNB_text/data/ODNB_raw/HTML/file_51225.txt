<span class="headword">Buchler,  Adolph</span>  (1867&#150;1939), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born into a poor family of rabbinic stock on 18 October 1867 in the Slovakian village of Priekopa, then in Hungary. His father died in Adolph's infancy. He and his sister were brought up by their mother, whose brother was Adolph Neubauer (1831&#150;1907), bibliographer and professor in biblical Hebrew at Oxford. Between 1887 and 1892 Buchler studied at the Budapest Jewish Seminary (where in 1892 he was ordained rabbi), Budapest University (philosophy), Leipzig University (where in 1890 he gained his doctorate on his&#151;later published&#151;dissertation on the Hebrew accents), and at the Breslau Jewish Seminary.<br>
<br>After some months in 1892 as assistant rabbi in Budapest, Buchler spent a year in Oxford as assistant to his uncle in identifying the Hebrew manuscripts at the Bodleian. In 1893 he was appointed to teach at the Vienna Jewish Seminary in Jewish studies. Buchler married Hermione Lowenthal (<i>d</i>. 1956) in 1895. They had six children. In 1906 his fame as pedagogue and original scholar led to his appointment as chief assistant to the ailing principal of Jews' College, London, Michael Friedlander, whose retirement was followed by Buchler's succession on 1 August 1907. The college was the Orthodox seminary intended principally for the training of rabbis and ministers for the congregations of the United Synagogue in London and the many synagogues beyond which followed its pattern.<br>
<br>The new principal was a classicist, modern linguist, grammarian, and master of the substance and methods of the latest Jewish scholarship. According to his pupil and successor, Isidore Epstein, there was hardly a highway or byway of Jewish learning that did not attract Buchler's attention. His special field was Jewish life in Palestine in the generations both before and after 70 <span class="smallcap">AD</span>. His pioneering use of Talmudic sources, in addition to classical, was esteemed by Christian and Jewish scholars alike. Among the best-known of his numerous works were <span class="italic">The Political and Social Leaders (of the Jews) in Sepphoris in the Second and Third Centuries</span> (1909) and <span class="italic">Studies in Sin and Atonement in the Rabbinic Literature of the First Century</span> (1928).<br>
<br>Buchler was slightly built, with an angular face and quizzical expression. He was firmly Orthodox, with a deep sense of duty in all things. He readily shared his vast knowledge and remarkable memory with fellow scholars. His famously meticulous preparation of his lectures was matched by his interest in the welfare and progress of his students, who revered him as instructor and friend. When the chief rabbi, J. H. Hertz, described him in 1927 as &#145;a scholar's scholar&#146;, it was intended as a compliment. But the quality was not unreservedly welcomed by the doubters of the practical utility of higher levels of rabbinic study in the training of the Jewish &#145;clergy&#146;. They declared their preference for &#145;a wide secular education and considerable general culture&#146;, and also for the transfer of Jews' College to Oxford or Cambridge. Buchler led the opposition, and the plan was not proceeded with.<br>
<br>Buchler's modest bearing belied his readiness to fight for his point of view. The contrasting opinions and consequent tensions remained throughout his tenure. On 24 March 1931 he used the celebration of the college's seventy-fifth anniversary (1930) to deliver a tirade against his community's lay leaders, many of whom were present, for their limited concern for&#151;and neglect of&#151;Jewish higher studies generally. While his immense contribution to Jewish scholarship was acknowledged, his ambitions for the college were unfulfilled. He saw the inadequate provision of resources as a reflection of communal priorities which were not his.<br>
<br>Buchler died suddenly on 19 February 1939 at his home, 261 Goldhurst Terrace, Hampstead, and was buried on 21 February at the Willesden Jewish cemetery in London. Among the mourners was the chief rabbi of Palestine, Isaac Herzog.<br>
