<span class="headword">Langley,  Henry</span>  (1610/11&#150;1679), <span class="occ">nonconformist minister</span>, was the son of Thomas Langley, a shoemaker of Abingdon, Berkshire, and attended John Roysse's Free Grammar School in the town. On 6 November 1629, aged eighteen, he matriculated as one of several scholars of Abingdon from Pembroke College, Oxford. He graduated BA on 11 June 1632, proceeded MA on 30 April 1635, and was elected to a fellowship. On 16 August 1640 he was named as a lecturer at St Martin's Church, Carfax, Oxford, but appears to have stayed only about a year. On 16 April 1642 the Commons ordered that he be recommended to the parishioners of Watlington, Oxfordshire, &#145;to be their lecturer to preach there every Saturday in the afternoon, and likewise every Lord's day&#146;, and that Price the vicar allow him to do this &#145;without any lett or interruption&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 2, 530). On 20 June 1643 the rectory of St Mary's, Newington, Surrey, was sequestered to Langley from John Meggs. By a parliamentary order of 10 September 1646 he was named one of seven ministers authorized to preach in any Oxford church, with a view to winning support for the planned reformation of the university.<br>
<br>Following the death on 10 July 1647 of Thomas Clayton, master of Pembroke, the fellows hurried to elect (three days later) Henry Wightwick, but parliament vetoed the choice. Abingdon inhabitants, noting the connections between their school and the college, petitioned that Langley be chosen, and on 26 August 1647 order was given for his appointment. His standing with the new authorities was registered in the university by his nomination on 30 September as one of Pembroke's two delegates to consult with the parliamentary visitors. They confirmed his appointment as master on 8 October, and next day &#145;thrust out Mr Whitewicke from his Headship by virtue of an Instrument stuck up in the Common Hall&#146;, which proclaimed Langley as the rightly constituted incumbent. In accordance with a parliamentary order of 2 March 1648, Langley was appointed on 12 April by the visitors to a canonry of Christ Church in the place of the extruded George Morley. On the same day he proceeded BD, and in May was one of the twenty delegates appointed by the proctors to be answerable for the conduct of the affairs of the university. On 5 July 1648 he was made an examiner of candidates for fellowships and scholarships and on 18 December 1649 was awarded a doctorate of divinity.<br>
<br>During the 1650s Langley was an energetic supporter of godly reform in his college, strongly backing vice-chancellor John Owen's campaign against anti-trinitarianism. He was friendly with Samuel Hartlib and Tobias Garbrand, principal of Gloucester Hall. Langley held both his position as master of Pembroke and his canonry at Christ Church until the Restoration, when he unsuccessfully petitioned Charles II to confirm him in the latter. His leaving the college did not proceed smoothly. Wightwick complained to the commissioners on 11 October 1660 that Langley retained possession of the master's lodgings and he was ordered to vacate them within four days; the final payment to him from the college accounts was dated 19 December. On 13 May 1662 the college petitioned in chancery that he had stolen from it documents and plate, and had failed to account for donations: he denied the charges, claiming that his proposals for internal arbitration had been rejected.<br>
<br>Now living at Tubney near Abingdon, Langley &#145;instructed the sons of dissenting brethren in academical learning&#146; including logic and philosophy  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>: <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, 2.158). In 1669 he was reported to be preaching at Cogges and Tubney&#151;&#145;a dangerous person keeps conventicles there&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>, 314). He was granted a licence at his house in Tubney on 16 April 1672. Wood records that also at this time Langley and other former members of the university held meetings in Thames Street in Oxford. In a letter of 18 June 1672 John Penny of Christ Church wrote that, in a sermon in the city the previous Sunday, Langley had:<blockquote>held forth two houres upon the Spirit of which subject they say he preacht in the late times neare two yeares, and they say he was all the while so unintelligible that from that time to this, no body could tell whence the sound thereof came; or whither tis goeing. (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>, 314)</blockquote>When Langley made his will on 16 June 1679 he was already ill. He left 10<i>s</i>. to each of his children, Henry Langley, Elizabeth Boyland, and Elliot Langley, and the lease of his house, held from Magdalen Hall, Oxford, to his wife, Elizabeth, named executor. He died on 10 September 1679 and was buried in St Helen's Church, Abingdon.<br>
