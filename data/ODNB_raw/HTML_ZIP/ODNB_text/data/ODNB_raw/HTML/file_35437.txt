<span class="headword">Pears, Sir  Edwin</span>  (1835&#150;1919), <span class="occ">barrister, publicist, and historian</span>, was born in York on 18 March 1835, the son of Robert Pears, a descendant of a younger branch of the Piers family of Piers Hall, Ingleton, Yorkshire, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barnett. After being educated privately, he graduated from London University with distinction in Roman law and jurisprudence. On a voyage to Australasia in 1857 he married Mary, daughter of John Ritchie Hall, surgeon in the Royal Navy. They had four sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1870 Pears was called to the bar at the Middle Temple, and began to practise as a barrister in London. In addition he undertook literary and administrative work and was for a time private secretary to Frederic Temple, then bishop of Exeter. He was also general secretary of the Social Science Association from 1868 to 1872 and of the International Prison Congress in 1872, and edited the journals of both organizations. In 1872 he became editor of the <span class="italic">Law Magazine</span>. Overwork began to tell on his health, and when, in January 1873, he heard that the practice of Sir Charles Parker Butt at the Constantinople bar was vacant, he decided to try his hand at the job. This decision was to determine his future career. Settling as a permanent resident in Turkey, he rose to become president of the European bar in Constantinople in 1881, and made a name for himself as a newspaper correspondent and historian of the city.<br>
<br>Pears's political attitudes and activities in the Levant were influenced by his arriving in the country in middle age, when he had already made political and personal connections in England. Although he rapidly rose to be one of the leaders of the British colony, he retained an independent and critical point of view with regard to local affairs and to the Eastern question. Holding, as he did, liberal convictions, he did not adopt the complacent attitude towards the Turks characteristic of many western Europeans living in the region. He had no illusions as to the intelligence and character of Sultan Abdul Hamid, and he expressed his views in the <span class="italic">Life of Abdul Hamid</span> (1917). He also wrote <span class="italic">Turkey and its People</span> (1911). Pears became interested in the more remote history of the Ottoman empire, and published two monographs which became standard texts, <span class="italic">The Fall of Constantinople</span> (1885) and <span class="italic">The Destruction of the Greek Empire</span> (1903).<br>
<br>Pears came to general prominence in 1876 through his reporting for the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> of the atrocities against Christian Bulgarians. His dispatches of 12 May, 23 June, and 7 August, particularly, played a major role in launching the subsequent &#145;Bulgarian agitation&#146;. Pears's reports were confirmed by other observers and were taken up by the rest of the Liberal press; by September a full-scale campaign, led by W. E. Gladstone, was in progress. Despite this, Pears remained on fair terms with the Turks, though his role as a barrister required him to be cautious.<br>
<br>Pears was knighted in June 1909. He left Turkey in December 1914, as a result of the outbreak of war, but he returned in April 1919. He died after an accident at sea at the Zammit-Clapp Hospital, Malta, on 27 November 1919.<br>
