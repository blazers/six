<span class="headword">Randall,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1585&#150;1604), <span class="occ">musician and composer</span>, was born of unknown parents and began his career at Exeter Cathedral, where he was certainly a vicar-choral and possibly previously a chorister. By 15 February 1585, however, he had left Devon for London, for on this date he was sworn epistoler at the Chapel Royal. He is next recorded as a lay clerk at St George's Chapel, Windsor, in 1586&#150;7 and 1600&#150;01, but had left by 1602&#150;3. In the meantime Randall continued his association with the Chapel Royal: on 26 July 1592 he was referred to as an organist, and between June of that year and April 1598 he witnessed numerous entries in the cheque book.<br>
<br>At some time before January 1601 Randall tried to secure readmission to his Exeter vicar's stall, of which he claimed to have been unjustly dispossessed by the dean and chapter, for on the 23rd of that month Queen Elizabeth wrote on his behalf, accusing the canons of penalizing him for his service at court and insisting he be reinstated forthwith. But the Exeter canons, in their reply dated 28 March, firmly denied any unfairness and pointed out that Randall, who had clearly resigned his place, had not in fact been &#145;sent for&#146; to serve the chapel, &#145;but made great sute &amp; frindes to obtayne the place&#146;  (Payne). Despite an entry in the Exeter accounts dated 16 October of the same year, showing that the vicars-choral paid Randall 33<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., however, there is no evidence that he was ever reinstated.<br>
<br>Randall's few surviving compositions comprise a good consort <span class="roman">In nomine</span> for five viols, three very accomplished keyboard pieces, and the music for three anthems, two of which are fragmentary. (A service setting sometimes attributed to him is actually by Greenwood Randall, another Exeter musician and possibly a relative.)<br>
<br>Having attended both the funeral of Elizabeth I and the coronation of James I in April and July 1603 respectively, Randall had either died or resigned by 1 March of the following year, when he was succeeded by another &eacute;migr&eacute; Exonian, Edmund Hooper.<br>
