<span class="headword">Bankes,  William John</span>  (1786&#150;1855), <span class="occ">traveller and antiquary</span>, was born on 11 December 1786, second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1287/', "Henry Bankes (1757&#150;1834)")</script> of Kingston Lacy, Dorset, politician and author, and his wife, Frances (1760/61&#150;1823), daughter of William Woodley, governor of the Leeward Islands, and the elder brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1286/', "George Bankes")</script>. He was educated at Westminster School (1795&#150;1801) before entering Trinity College, Cambridge, on 25 June 1803. In 1806, on the death of his elder brother, Henry, Bankes became heir to his father's estates and, with an income of &pound;8000 a year, he led a life at Cambridge which earned him a reputation for extravagance and eccentricity which he was to keep, and indeed cultivate, throughout his life. At Cambridge he became a firm friend of Byron, who described him as the &#145;father of all mischief&#146; in their fast set  (<span class="italic">Byron's Letters and Journals</span>, 12 Oct 1820). Bankes graduated BA in 1808 and proceeded MA in 1811. In 1810 he was elected MP for Truro, where his prospective brother-in-law was the patron. He supported his father's efforts to abolish sinecures, but otherwise supported the administration. Despite his lifelong reputation as a brilliant conversationalist in private circles, he seems to have been a poor public speaker, and his parliamentary speeches were sometimes strangely delivered and incoherent.<br>
<br>Bankes, with Byron, was prominent in the London season of 1812 and, after having given up his parliamentary seat and having had his proposal of marriage to Annabella Milbanke, afterwards Lady Byron, refused, he set out, with letters of introduction from Byron, for the East. He followed Wellington's army through Portugal and Spain, buying treasures which now decorate the Spanish Room in the family home at Kingston Lacy. By September 1815 he reached Cairo, making preparations for a voyage up the Nile to see the antiquities in the company of the interpreter, attendant, and janizary Giovanni Finati, whose memoirs he later translated from the Italian, edited, and published as <span class="italic">Narrative of the Life and Adventures of Giovanni Finati</span> (2 vols., 1830). Bankes enjoyed the bizarre, daring, and exotic, but was also a serious scholar, making detailed sketches and notes of the monuments he passed and amassing a collection of Egyptian antiquities now at Kingston Lacy. He reached the Second Cataract and Wadi Halfa before returning to Cairo, having adopted eastern dress and grown a beard. In October 1818 he made his second and longer Nile journey in the company of Henry Salt, the British consul-general, Giovanni Belzoni, and three artists to help record their discoveries. Bankes's first attempt to remove an obelisk which he had discovered on the island of Philae on his earlier trip ended with the pillar's lying on the river bed, but it was finally rescued, brought to Kingston Lacy in 1821, and, with a pedestal and a base, which belongs to a quite different temple in Nubia, was erected in 1839 on the south lawn where it still stands. While in Egypt, Bankes spent a month at Abu Simbel, uncovering figures and systematically recording the interior. Bankes went on to Palestine, Syria, and Jordan in the company of James Silk Buckingham. He returned to Europe in 1819, meeting Byron in Italy in 1820. He arrived back in England in 1820, where he basked in society admiration and enjoyed the nickname from Byron the Nubian Discoverer. He wrote or inspired a review of Silk Buckingham's work on Palestine which appeared in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> (January 1822) and in a published letter repeated allegations that Buckingham had plagiarized drawings and some observations from his (Bankes's) notebook which he had mistakenly left with Buckingham. On 26 October 1826 Buckingham obtained &pound;400 damages from Bankes for this libel, although some modern interpreters are less sure of the justice of his case  (personal information).<br>
<br>While on his travels in 1815, on the death of his uncle Sir William Wynne, Bankes inherited Soughton Hall, Flintshire, and after 1834, when he succeeded to his father's estate, he commanded a considerable fortune. He made extensive changes to both Soughton and Kingston Lacy with the help of Charles Barry. He was tory MP for the University of Cambridge (1822&#150;6) and for Marlborough (1829&#150;32) before succeeding to his father's county seat and representing Dorset (1832&#150;4).<br>
<br>Having already been the subject of gossip and a suit for criminal conversation with Lady Buckinghamshire (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Anne Pigot, married name Anne Hobart) in 1823, in 1833 he was charged with meeting a guardsman for &#145;unnatural purposes&#146; in a public convenience between Westminster Abbey and St Margaret's Church. He was found not guilty after many people, including the duke of Wellington, had given character references, but the suggestion of impropriety and the detailed discussion of his personal habits undermined his public career. In 1841 another such charge drove him abroad and, having made over his estates to his brother George, he took up residence at Venice, from where he continued to direct in minute detail the furnishing of Kingston Lacy. Bankes died in Venice unmarried and childless on 15 April 1855. He was buried at the family vault at Wimborne Minster, Dorset.<br>
<br>Bankes's drawings at Kingston Lacy remain an important source for Egyptologists because they are detailed site plans, measured sections, elevations, and meticulous transcriptions, not artistic impressions, and because many of the objects he recorded have since been lost, destroyed, or moved from their original environment. The drawings from Nubia and the Sudan are particularly important as they are some of the earliest to be made of those regions. Bankes did many of the drawings and transcriptions himself; others in the collection are wholly or in part by others but were made under Bankes's direction by Finati and Louis Linant. His contribution to the decipherment of the hieroglyphic script, one of the purposes for which the collection of drawings was made, was significant, but his influence was greatly and unfortunately limited by his failure to publish any account of his travels other than his notes to Finati's <span class="italic">Narrative</span>. The first systematic study of his papers (Usick, 2002) shows the importance of his scholarship and quite how much has been lost since he visited Egypt and Nubia.<br>
