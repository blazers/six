<span class="headword">Mather,  Leonard Charles <span class="st"> [Len]</span></span>  (1909&#150;1991), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 10 October 1909 at Port Sunlight in Cheshire, the son of Richard and Elizabeth Mather. He was educated at Oldershaw School, Wallasey. After leaving school at the age of fifteen, he spent a year in a Liverpool shipping office before joining the staff of the Midland Bank branch at Dale Street, Liverpool, in 1926. In 1937 he married Muriel Armor Morris (<i>d</i>. 1991). They had no children.<br>
<br>Midland's Dale Street branch was part of a distinctive Liverpool tradition in banking, and Mather thrived on learning the special banking techniques which were needed in the city's cotton and shipping markets. There was even a time in the 1930s when he was tempted to move across to an appointment in the Booth Steamship Company. In 1937, however, he was promoted to a succession of appointments at the bank's headquarters at Poultry in London. Initially he was a branch superintendent's assistant&#151;an appointment at the centre of the branch network&#151;but during the war years he was the right-hand man of G. P. A. Lederer, chief general manager of the bank between 1943 and 1946. His duties included liaison with head office departments which had been evacuated from London, and he was also responsible for contacts with Whitehall departments.<br>
<br>Between 1945 and 1948 he was manager of Midland's branch in Bolton&#151;an appointment which he later described as &#145;the most satisfying period of my career&#146;. Decades later the Bolton office was still being described by customers as &#145;Mr Mather's branch&#146;  (Holmes and Green, 246). He returned to Poultry in 1948 as principal of the legal department and became an assistant general manager in 1950. Between 1954 and 1955, and again between 1956 and 1958, he was <i>de facto</i> in charge of the Midland Bank Executor and Trustee Company. These duties in the trust company, although essential to the fortunes of the bank at that time, probably delayed Mather's journey to the most senior management posts.<br>
<br>In 1958 Mather was promoted to become a joint general manager. He then joined the &#145;magic circle&#146; of Midland's management committee, where his contemporaries included Howard Thackstone, Bernard Clarke, and Tony Hellmuth. He was promoted to become assistant chief general manager in 1964, and deputy chief general manager in 1966. In 1968, on Thackstone's retirement, he was appointed a director of the bank, the first occasion on which a new chief executive was given a seat on Midland's board. Mather's appointment to the most senior management position in the bank was not the clear run which it seemed, as Midland's chairman, Sir Archibald Forbes, regarded his chairmanship as a fully executive task. Consequently, for the next four years Mather, although he was perhaps the most experienced and best-qualified banker in the country, did not have the full command of strategy and management which he may have wished for. Nevertheless, in his new role he oversaw a revolution in Midland's management structure; the highly centralized systems of the previous seven or eight decades now made way for a new network of regional head offices. He was an inspirational chief, especially in his commitment to the branch network and the importance of local banking knowledge. Mather believed, &#145;based on long tradition, that a bank's success could be earned only by the services provided in its branches and the standing and influence of its men on the spot&#146;  (Holmes and Green, 246).<br>
<br>Mather was also realistic about the bank's prospects and the need to simplify the branch structure. In 1969, along with the other clearing banks, the Midland fully disclosed its profits for the first time; and the figures revealed, to surprise inside and outside the bank, that Midland's profitability was below that of its main competitors. Shortly afterwards the introduction of the &#145;competition and credit control&#146; regime in 1971 put the earnings of all the main clearing banks under severe pressure. It was a reflection of Mather's traditional banking skills that Midland was able to treble its profits between 1969 and 1973, without suffering from the property and overseas losses then being incurred by some of its competitors.<br>
<br>Mather also made an important contribution to the development of the banking profession. He was well suited to a teaching role, as early in his career he had obtained not only the qualifications of the Institute of Bankers and the Chartered Institute of Secretaries but also an external BComm degree from the University of London. In the 1930s he taught banking law at the Liverpool College of Commerce; in the mid-1940s his views were an important factor in the Institute of Bankers' decision to upgrade the associateship examinations; and in the 1950s he produced a series of publications which became standard textbooks of modern banking practice. His books included <span class="italic">Banker and Customer Relationship and the Accounts of Personal Customers</span> (1956), which was given the premier award of the Institute of Bankers. He was also in regular demand as a lecturer and speaker, and he delivered the Gilbart lectures at the University of London in 1957 and 1961, and the Ernest Sykes memorial lectures in 1966.<br>
<br>These contributions led to his election to the council of the institute in 1961 and to the deputy chairmanship in 1967. He was a popular choice as president of the institute in 1969&#150;70. In 1974 he was made an honorary fellow of the institute, at that time one of only fourteen honorary fellowships to have been awarded. His input to the literature of banking was also recognized by Loughborough University, which awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1978. Since the late 1960s he had been instrumental in setting up Loughborough's degree in banking and finance.<br>
<br>Mather retired as Midland's chief general manager in 1972, but he remained on the board as vice-chairman until 1974 and as a director until 1984. In 1974, however, at the invitation of the Bank of England, he accepted the chairmanship of United Dominions Trust. This company, then the largest of the British finance houses, was being supported by the &#145;lifeboat&#146; arrangements for companies affected by the secondary banking crisis of 1973&#150;4. Mather's astute management of the business over the next few years was widely applauded in the City as a return to the basics of banking and finance. Under his chairmanship United Dominions' lifeboat borrowings were reduced from &pound;500 million to under &pound;100 million, and in 1981 the company, profitable once more, was sold to the Trustee Savings Bank. His contribution to this major rescue was recognized by a CBE in 1978&#151;although there were many in the banking world who placed him even higher in their own estimates of achievement.<br>
<br>Len Mather's ebullience, sense of fun, and frankness brought him affection and influence not only at Midland but throughout the banking community. A large and avuncular figure, he was a committed supporter of Midland's sports and social societies and he enjoyed golf and bridge with the same enthusiasm. Outside the bank, he served as captain and chairman (for two terms) of Wildernesse Golf Club, and he was a vice-president of the Society of Lancastrians in London. Len Mather died in hospital at Tunbridge Wells on 8 May 1991, and was survived by his wife (who died on 18 September 1991).<br>
