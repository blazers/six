<span class="headword">Shawe,  John</span>  (1608&#150;1672), <span class="occ">nonconformist minister</span>, was born on 22 June 1608 at Sykehouse in the parish of Bradfield, Yorkshire, the only son of John Shawe (<i>d</i>. 1634) and his second wife, Emote Steade (<i>d</i>. 1652). He went to school at Darwen and Rotherham and in 1623 entered Christ's College, Cambridge, where he was tutored by William Chappell, later bishop of Cork. As a result of hearing sermons in a nearby village preached by Thomas Weld, Shawe determined on a ministerial career and was ordained priest at Peterborough on 28 December 1629, taking his MA degree the following year. He was appointed lecturer at Brampton in Derbyshire in 1630 and given a licence by the bishop, Thomas Morton, to preach throughout the diocese without being required to subscribe to the Articles. While there Shawe married Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1657), daughter of George Heathcote, gentleman, of Cutthorpe Hall, Brampton, on 10 December 1632 in the church of Holy Trinity, Micklegate, in York, a city in whose religious life he was later to play a prominent part. More immediately, however, Shawe was invited by the feoffees of impropriations to a lectureship at Chulmleigh in Devon for a period of three years, having been heard preaching in London by a group of merchants with connections to Devon. He moved there in 1633, by which time he had also been appointed chaplain to Philip Herbert, earl of Montgomery and Pembroke. His ministry at Chulmleigh was brought to an end in 1636 as a result of complaints against his churchmanship, probably instigated by Archbishop Laud. Shawe then withdrew to his estate at Sykehouse (his father having died in 1634) but was soon called to be one of the civic preachers at York by the puritan mayor, Alderman Vaux. He took up his post at All Saints, Pavement, but immediately fell foul of Archbishop Neile as a result of his first sermon in the city. Neile thought him the leader of the puritan party at York but refrained from further action against him when he discovered that Shawe was Pembroke's chaplain. For the next three years Shawe played a prominent role, along with Edward Bowles, in the religious life of the city.<br>
<br>On 17 April 1639 Shawe was instituted to the valuable living of Rotherham, Yorkshire, on Pembroke's presentation, and soon after accompanied him and the royal entourage to the siege of Berwick. While there he established a friendship with Alexander Henderson, which was renewed the following year when Shawe was chaplain to the English commissioners appointed to settle the grievances of the Scots, whom Henderson represented as a commissioner. Shawe's involvement with Scottish affairs at this time continued through his work as chaplain to Henry Rich, earl of Holland, and he also retained close links with the city of York, preaching a sermon critical of the king in one of the parish churches on the occasion of the royal arrival there in the spring of 1642.<br>
<br>After the king left York, Shawe moved to Hull, but was excluded by the governor, Sir John Hotham, as a result of his first sermon in the town. He then withdrew to Beverley where he preached a sermon, dedicated to the mayor and aldermen of Hull, and published as <span class="italic">A Broken Heart</span>, in which he defended his actions and likened the cause of the royalist armies to that of the northern earls of 1569. After returning to Rotherham, Shawe was asked to preach before Lord Fairfax and his army, then camped at Selby, on a special fast day called for 5 February 1643, a sermon subsequently published as <span class="italic">Two Clean Birds</span>. He was not long at Rotherham; apparently on account of his support for parliament, with three other leading townsmen, he was fined &pound;1000; although his wife was made prisoner when the town was taken on 4 May 1643, Shawe escaped to Manchester. There he joined other puritan ministers in providing regular sermons, preaching every Friday in the town, continuing to live there after he accepted the rectory of nearby Lyme from Sir William Brereton later that year. In the spring of 1644 Shawe was invited to make a two-month missionary visit to Cartmel, Lancashire, where puritan preaching had been little heard before, and this experience of unreformed religion made a strong impression on him. In June 1644, on hearing of the arrival of Prince Rupert and his forces, he was once again on his travels, back across the Pennines this time, and he re-emerged in York immediately after the relief of the city and the parliamentarian victory at Marston Moor. He was appointed chaplain to the standing committee for the government of the northern counties on 16 July 1644 and on 20 September preached the sermon in York Minster on the occasion of the taking of the solemn league and covenant by Fairfax and others.<br>
<br>Throughout the upheavals of the 1640s and in subsequent years, Shawe remained firm in his commitment to a presbyterian form of church order (although he was not over-zealous in this respect) and influenced the religious policy of the interregnum both locally and nationally. He became secretary to the committee for scandalous ministers and was appointed to the wealthy living of Scrayingham by Fairfax. In 1645 he accepted an invitation to return to Hull, first as lecturer at St Mary's and later at the main church of Holy Trinity, and he remained in these posts until the Restoration. In addition, in 1651, after some litigation with the then incumbent, Shawe was made master of the Hull Charterhouse; he thereafter made this his home, spending considerable sums on the property both for his benefit and that of the poor inmates. Shawe preached in the town on Wednesdays and Thursdays and set up a godly discipline for the administration of the Lord's supper on presbyterian lines, which did not find favour among all members of the corporation, including some congregationalists. Relations with the corporation were also often strained over disputes about salary and the administration of the Charterhouse. During these years he played an active role on a wider stage; he was chaplain to the parliamentary commissioners negotiating with the king at Newcastle in 1646 and under the protectorate he preached often at both Whitehall and Hampton Court, receiving a pension of &pound;100 per annum from Cromwell.<br>
<br>Shawe's first wife, Dorothy, died on 10 December 1657, and he published a memoir of her life the following year. On 19 December 1659 he married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1693), daughter of John Stillington, esquire, of Kelfield, and it was for his young son of that marriage that Shawe subsequently wrote his autobiography. Despite his high profile under the protectorate, on 25 July 1660 he was appointed a royal chaplain. He was present at the coronation the following April, but by the end of 1660 his position at Hull was under threat from the officers of the garrison there. On 9 June 1661 a royal mandate inhibited him from preaching at Holy Trinity but, after a personal interview with the king, Shawe was allowed to retain the Charterhouse and his position as a royal chaplain. Although he initially returned to Hull, preaching at the Charterhouse to considerable crowds despite the opposition of the garrison, following the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> he resigned his post there, returning to Rotherham on 20 June 1662. During that summer he shared the pulpit at Rotherham with the vicar, but after St Bartholomew's day, and for the remainder of his life, preached only in private houses. He died on 19 April 1672, and was buried at Rotherham two days later. Despite his conflicts with Hull corporation over salary he had remained comfortably off, providing substantial marriage portions for his six daughters and leaving lands in Penistone. By his will he bequeathed sixty bibles to be distributed to the poor, as well as other charitable bequests to Hull and elsewhere. His reputation for learning was recalled in the funeral inscription formerly in Rotherham parish which described him as a Barnabas or Boarnerges.<br>
