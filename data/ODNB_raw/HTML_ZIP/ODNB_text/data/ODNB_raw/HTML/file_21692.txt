<span class="headword">Pearce, Sir  William</span>, first baronet  (1833&#150;1888), <span class="occ">engineer and shipbuilder</span>, was born at Brompton near Chatham in Kent on 8 January 1833, the son of Joseph George Pearce. His early education is unknown, but he trained as a shipwright and naval architect at the Chatham Dockyard under Oliver Lang. His skill was recognized in 1861, when he was given responsibility for superintending the construction of HMS <i>Achilles</i>, the first iron-clad ship built in the naval dockyards. His experience in the new construction material brought him the position of Lloyd's surveyor on Clydeside in 1863, then the centre of the new iron shipbuilding industry.<br>
<br>Within twelve months Pearce was appointed manager of Robert Napier's shipyard to replace John Elder, who had set up in independent business with Charles Randolph. His influence on this great yard was immediate, designing pathbreaking, fast, transatlantic liners for the Compagnie G&eacute;n&eacute;rale Transatlantique. His opportunity to become more than a manager came in 1869, when John Elder's early death set his widow and partners in search of a new associate. Pearce's proven skills in design and management were recognized as what was needed, and he joined John Ure, J. L. K. Jamieson, and Mrs Elder as partner and manager in the reconstructed enterprise now named John Elder &amp; Co. The company had a fine reputation for its development work on the compound marine steam engine, and under Pearce this was enhanced further in 1874 when A. C. Kirk, working at the company, developed the triple expansion engine, which was to become the workhorse of the world's merchant navies for the next half century.<br>
<br>Pearce embarked on a rapid development of the markets served by John Elder and pushed out in three directions. In designing ships for the transatlantic route he emphasized speed, and to enhance his company's reputation he cultivated the idea of the Blue Riband for record crossings. He wagered his ships would break existing records, and they did, attracting for his company many new orders, especially from Nord Deutscher Lloyd and Cunard. He applied the same psychology to the fast, cross-channel steam packets, guaranteeing and achieving a crossing time of one hour each way between Dover and Calais. His third market direction was to establish the Govan shipyard as a naval builder, and he succeeded in attracting orders for hulls and engines in the 1870s as naval construction was extended to counter the expansion of Bismarck's new fleet.<br>
<br>Pearce's partners, Ure and Jamieson, retired in 1878 leaving him in command of what was then among the foremost shipbuilding concerns in the world, the Govan shipyard occupying over 70 acres, and employing as many as 5000 operatives. He built for the largest shipping lines, including the Pacific Steam Navigation Company, the New Zealand Shipping Company, and the British and Africa Steam Navigation Company. Pearce was a major shareholder in the first two of these, and was also chairman of the Guion Steamship Company, and of the Scottish Oriental Steamship Company.<br>
<br>As a leading Clydeside employer, Pearce became a commissioner for the Govan burgh, an honorary colonel of the second volunteer battalion of the Highland light infantry, and, as a mason, became provincial grand master of Glasgow. In politics he was a Conservative, and was elected as the first MP to represent the Govan division of Lanarkshire in 1885; he represented the constituency until his death. In 1886 he converted his company to limited liability status, taking the name of the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, of which he was chairman. In 1887, on Queen Victoria's jubilee, he was created a baronet, but enjoyed his new rank only briefly. He died suddenly at his home at 119 Piccadilly, London, on 18 December 1888, his heart weakened by the stress and high pressure of his work; he was survived by his wife, Dinah Elizabeth Socoter, and his only son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35436/', "William George Pearce")</script>, who succeeded to the baronetcy. He was buried on 22 December in Gillingham, Kent.<br>
