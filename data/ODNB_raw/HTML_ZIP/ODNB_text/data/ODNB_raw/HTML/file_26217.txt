<span class="headword">Stafford,  William</span>  (1554&#150;1612), <span class="occ">conspirator</span>, was born on 1 March 1554 at Rochford, Essex, the second of three sons of Sir William Stafford of Chebsey, Staffordshire, and Rochford, Essex (<i>b</i>. before 1512, <i>d</i>. 1556), courtier, and his second wife and cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69753/', "Dorothy Stafford (1526&#150;1604)")</script>, daughter of the Catholic <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26205/', "Henry Stafford, tenth Baron Stafford")</script>, and his wife, Ursula [<i>see </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/75346">Stafford,  Ursula</a>, <i>under</i> <a target="_top" href="/view/article/22451">Pole,  Margaret</a>]. He was of royal blood and, in addition, his father's first wife was Mary Boleyn, aunt to Elizabeth I. His family was strongly protestant, and in 1555 he was taken by his parents into exile. They went to Geneva, where John Calvin was godfather to his younger brother, John Stafford, who was born there in 1556. Sir William Stafford died in Geneva later that year and his wife managed to escape from Calvin, who wanted to keep her and her family there. In 1557 they moved to Basel, where they lived next door to John Knox. In 1559 the family returned to England and lived at Waltham in Essex. It was from here that at the age of ten William Stafford went to Winchester College as a scholar. He matriculated at New College, Oxford, in 1571 and was a fellow from 1573 to 1575 but was then deprived of his fellowship because he had gone out of residence.<br>
<br>Stafford then moved to London, where he was associated with the court. His mother was a lady of the bedchamber to the queen and his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26203/', "Sir Edward Stafford (1552&#150;1605)")</script>, became the English ambassador in Paris in 1578. He was rather overshadowed by his important relatives and seems to have had quite a poor reputation. He served at some point as a volunteer soldier in the Netherlands, fighting on the side of the Dutch rebels, and was wounded. In 1585 he left England impulsively to go to stay with his brother in Paris, and the latter wrote to the queen asking that he should be given some employment in the Netherlands again, this time with a command in the English forces being sent there. He does not seem to have achieved this ambition.<br>
<br>Stafford was for a time famous because he was identified with the &#145;W. S.&#146; who published a major work on Tudor economics and society in 1582 entitled <span class="italic">A Discourse of the Commonweal</span>. It is now generally recognized that this is a work of Sir Thomas Smith, composed in 1549 and published thirty-three years later by his nephew, William Smith. Stafford did enter the pages of history, however, in January 1587 when the &#145;Stafford plot&#146; was revealed. Late the previous year he had opened a conspiracy with the French ambassador, the baron de Chateauneuf, and his secretary, des Trappes, to kill the queen. Stafford visited the ambassador's house, where, according to his account, it was suggested to him that such a plot would benefit Mary, queen of Scots, and would earn him money and also admiration from Catholic leaders abroad. Stafford then introduced his French co-conspirators to Michael Moody, who was a servant of his brother Edward Stafford and was imprisoned at the time in London for the latter's debts. Moody suggested that Elizabeth should be blown up in her bedchamber by means of a trail of gunpowder. When the French pointed out that this plan would involve blowing up the chief conspirator's own mother, it was proposed that poisoning or stabbing might be better. Stafford, however, then reported the matter to Sir Francis Walsingham, the queen's principal secretary. Des Trappes was arrested and the ambassador confronted with the story. He said that it was Stafford who had initiated the plot, but he had no satisfactory reason to give as to why he himself had not immediately reported it to the English government.<br>
<br>The best explanation for this plot is that it was indeed concocted by Stafford, on the instructions of William Cecil, Lord Burghley, the lord treasurer, and Walsingham. The purpose was possibly to persuade the queen of the need to execute Mary, queen of Scots, because there was a danger to her life if she did not. This, however, assumes that Elizabeth was not aware of the whole plan, which is perhaps disproved by the fact that in May 1587 when she received the French ambassador back into her favour she joked with him about the matter, behaving as if there was no substance in the plot. The other explanation is that the plot enabled the English to place Chateauneuf under house arrest and hence cut off his links with France at the time of the execution of Mary. It also sent up a smokescreen which made it more difficult for the French to protest about the execution of Mary. If all this is true, Stafford emerges as a member of the very considerable Elizabethan secret service network.<br>
<br>Stafford was kept in the Tower of London for at least eighteen months after the discovery of the plot, although des Trappes and Chateauneuf were released within four months. The prolonged incarceration of Stafford was because after the release of the two Frenchmen it was necessary for Elizabeth to agree with the French that the true instigator of the plot was Stafford. No charges were, however, brought, and it can probably be assumed that by the end of 1588 Stafford was free.<br>
<br>About 1593 Stafford married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1612), daughter of Thomas Gryme of Antingham, Norfolk, with whom he had a daughter, Dorothy, and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26218/', "William Stafford (1593&#150;1684)")</script>. He seems to have gone to live in Norfolk, and in 1594 is to be found arresting a seminary priest in that county. In his later years he presented a number of his own books, and some belonging to his mother, to his old school, Winchester. He died on 16 November 1612 but the places of his death and burial are unknown.<br>
