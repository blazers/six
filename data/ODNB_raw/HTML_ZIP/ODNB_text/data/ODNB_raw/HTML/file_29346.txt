<span class="headword">Wiburn,  Percival</span>  (1533/4&#150;1606), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was perhaps from Kent. He was admitted scholar on Cardinal Morton's foundation at St John's College, Cambridge, on 11 November 1546, became a fellow on 8 April 1552, and proceeded BA in that academic year. In Mary's reign he joined the exile, arriving at Geneva on 8 May 1557 and being formally admitted resident there on 14 October. He returned to Cambridge by summer 1559, when he proceeded MA, and on 24 July became junior dean and philosophy lecturer at St John's. He was ordained deacon in London on 25 January 1560 and priest on 27 March following. By June he was chaplain to Lord Keeper Bacon, and in this capacity promoted many candidates for livings during the next fifteen years. On 23 October 1560 he was himself presented to a canonry of Norwich, which he resigned by January 1562. On 7 February 1561 he was presented to a canonry of Rochester, and on 16 November that year to the like dignity in Westminster Abbey; both stalls he held for life. He became senior fellow of St John's on 6 April 1561, and college preacher that Michaelmas.<br>
<br>About October 1561 Wiburn married and was licensed to preach. In the convocation of 1563 he was proctor for the Rochester chapter. About this time he was recommended to Lord Robert Dudley as &#145;godlie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pepys MSS</span>, 2, misdated), and in 1563 Dudley's brother, the earl of Warwick, hoped to have Wiburn as a chaplain in the Le Havre expedition. On 25 April 1563 Wiburn was presented by the crown to the vicarage of Holy Sepulchre, Holborn, to which he was instituted on 8 March 1564. Wiburn became prominent among the agitators for further reform. He was one of those who on 20 March 1565 petitioned the ecclesiastical commissioners to tolerate some measure of nonconformity. When Archbishop Parker finally summoned the London clergy to Lambeth on 26 March 1566 and required instant assent to the prescribed costume and other requirements, Wiburn must have been among the thirty-seven who refused and were sequestered, with deprivation following automatically after three months. Wiburn's London benefice was lost to him by October, but he retained his canonries.<br>
<br>Meanwhile the puritans looked abroad for support, and in summer 1566 Wiburn led an unofficial delegation to Switzerland. At Geneva, Beza received him amiably, but he had a cool reception from Bullinger in Z&uuml;rich. The Swiss were reluctant to antagonize the English bishops, which is precisely what Wiburn's mission achieved. He drew up a &#145;State of the church&#146; describing conditions in England, but was subsequently obliged to deny that he had suggested that many Catholic practices were still countenanced. It is said that Wiburn had to support himself for a time, but he most likely returned to Cambridge, since it was from there that he moved to Northampton. He was invited by local gentry to preach in the latter town, and by May 1570 had established himself as <i>de facto</i> superintendent of the local clergy; he introduced the meetings known as &#145;exercises&#146; or &#145;prophesyings&#146;, at first with the support of Bishop Edmund Scambler of Peterborough. A more radical scheme involving the civic leadership in a Genevan-style regime for the whole community was drafted on 5 June 1571, still ostensibly with the bishop's support. But just as this &#145;order of Northampton&#146; was devised, Wiburn (who had been satirized in a ballad distributed by his opponents as &#145;alias tiburne [Tyburn] tyke&#146;) was summoned to London to be interrogated by Parker. By February 1572 Scambler acted to end Wiburn's whole ministry in Northampton, despite pleas from the earl of Leicester. Wiburn removed himself to the neighbouring village of Whiston, where, under the protection of the lady of the manor, Isabel Catesby, he continued to draw a large congregation. In July 1573 he was again examined in London, this time before Star Chamber, in connection with the dissemination of Cartwright's <span class="italic">Replye</span>.<br>
<br>On 9 June 1575 Wiburn was licensed to be absent from his canonries to preach the gospel in the Channel Islands; he was active in Jersey and Guernsey for two years, and with Arthur Wake drafted the islands' first church order. Back at Rochester in 1581 he was appointed the cathedral's divinity lecturer. In the same year, having been authorized to dispute with Catholics, he published a reply to Robert Persons. Despite these official employments he was again suspended from preaching for several years from 1583/4. His dogged refusal to wear the surplice eventually marked him out as an old campaigner. By 1599 his Rochester colleagues acknowledged it would be &#145;a myracle&#146; if he now changed his ways  (Knighton, &#145;The reformed chapter&#146;, 72). At Westminster he latterly occupied the judicial post of archdeacon, and conducted an amiable house-swap with Lancelot Andrewes. In his final years he preached at Battersea, and enjoyed the patronage and society of Ann, Lady Bacon, at Gorhambury.<br>
<br>Wiburn died between 23 April and 16 May 1606. He asked to be buried in Whiston churchyard. He left sons John, Nathaniel (both in orders), and Joseph, and a daughter, Mary (married to William Striddle). He left money to the prisoners in the gaols of Northampton, Rochester, and Westminster Gatehouse, and directed that his Hebrew, Latin, and Greek books be shared among his sons. His wife had clearly predeceased him; her identity is unknown.<br>
