<span class="headword">Field <span class="st"> [Feild]</span>,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1561, <em>d.</em> 1624), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was baptized on 16 November 1561 in Stratford upon Avon, Warwickshire, the son of Henry Field (<i>d</i>. 1592), tanner, and his wife, Ursula. On 29 September 1579 he was apprenticed for seven years to George Bishop, stationer of London, with the provision that the first six years would be served under the Huguenot printer Thomas Vautrollier. Under Vautrollier Field worked on many foreign-language books and Latin textbooks, and he also probably helped run the business while his master was printing in Scotland for King James VI.<br>
<br>Field was made free of the Stationers' Company by Bishop on 6 February 1587, and five months later his former master Vautrollier died. Vautrollier's widow Jacqueline tried to carry on the business, but encountered difficulties because she had not been officially recognized as a printer. In autumn 1588 Richard Field hired Jacqueline Vautrollier to print the first publication to bear his name, <span class="italic">The Copie of a Letter Sent out of England to Don Bernardin Mendoza</span>. This piece of post-Armada anti-Spanish propaganda was ostensibly written by the recently executed priest Richard Leigh, but several manuscripts survive in the handwriting of Lord Burghley, Elizabeth's secretary of state, who himself had previously employed Thomas Vautrollier.<br>
<br>The collaboration of Field and Jacqueline Vautrollier (<i>d</i>. 1611?) was apparently a happy one, for on 12 January 1589 they were married in St Anne Blackfriars, and on 1 December 1590 their son Richard was baptized there. Thus Field inherited his former master's business and became one of the leading stationers in London at the young age of probably about twenty-seven. He was fined twice in 1589, once for keeping an unauthorized apprentice and once for printing a book contrary to order (probably Walter Bigges's <span class="italic">A Summarie and True Discourse of Sir Frances Drakes West Indian Voyage</span>), but thenceforth he became a model member of the Stationers' Company. In 1592 he took as an apprentice his younger brother Jasper, who was made free of the company in 1601.<br>
<br>Field inherited Vautrollier's status as a leading printer in England of foreign-language books and books about foreign affairs. These ranged from popular pamphlets about Spain and the French king of Navarre to more substantial works such as Geoffrey Fenton's translation of Guicciardini's Italian history. A number of the Spanish works give the printer's name as Ricardo del Campo, a literal translation of Field's name. He also maintained Vautrollier's contacts in high places, including Burghley and King James. In 1589 Field published George Puttenham's <span class="italic">The Arte of English Poesie</span>, composing a dedication to Burghley in which he called himself &#145;a printer alwaies ready and desirous to be at your Honourable commaundement&#146;  (sig. AB3<i>v</i>). That same year, Field entered King James's <span class="italic">Poeticall Exercises</span> in the Stationers' register, but did not print it. However, in 1591 Field published the translation of Ariosto's <span class="italic">Orlando Furioso</span> by Sir John Harington, the Queen's godson. Two separate manuscripts in Harington's hand, complete with detailed instructions to Field, survive as MS Rawlinson poet. 125 and BL, Add. MS 18920. Harington must have been pleased, because five years later he again called upon Field, to publish <span class="italic">The Metamorphosis of Ajax</span> (1596).<br>
<br>The most famous author published by Field was his Stratford contemporary William Shakespeare. In 1593 Field published Shakespeare's first printed work, <span class="italic">Venus and Adonis</span>, but the following year he turned over the rights to John Harrison the elder. Harrison employed Field to print Shakespeare's <span class="italic">The Rape of Lucrece</span> (1594), as well as the next three editions of <span class="italic">Venus</span> (1594&#150;6); later Edward Blount employed Field to print Robert Chester's <span class="italic">Love's Martyr</span> (1601), which contained Shakespeare's &#145;The Phoenix and the Turtle&#146;. Field was also associated with the printing or publishing of many important sources for Shakespeare's plays, suggesting the possibility that the playwright may have had access to his townsman's shop. These sources include the 1587 edition of Holinshed's <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> (which was co-published during the last year of Field's apprenticeship by his master George Bishop), North's translation of Plutarch's <span class="italic">Lives</span> (of which Field printed editions in 1595 and 1603), Ovid's <span class="italic">Metamorphoses</span> (which Field printed in 1589 for Harrison), and many more minor sources.<br>
<br>Besides Harington and Shakespeare, Field printed several other important works of poetry, including the first full editions of Spenser's <span class="italic">Faerie Queene</span> (1596) and Sidney's <span class="italic">Arcadia</span> (1598), both for William Ponsonby; Chapman's translations of Homer (1611&#150;14, for Nathaniel Butter); and Sir William Alexander's <span class="italic">Aurora</span> (1604, for Edward Blount). He was also noted as a skilled printer of complicated mathematical treatises; William Bedwell notes in the preface to his translation of Schonerus's <span class="italic">De numeris geometricis</span> (1614) that no printer other than Field would touch his manuscript. Field's skill earned the respect of his fellow stationers, for in 1598 he was admitted to the livery of the Stationers' Company, and in June 1604 he was elected to the company's governing body. He was also selected twice to attend the lord mayor's banquet.<br>
<br>Field's first wife Jacqueline died some time before 1614, and she may be the &#145;Mr Feilds wife&#146; who was buried on 9 March 1611 in St Anne Blackfriars  (parish register). By 1613 Field had moved to St Michael, Wood Street, and set up a new shop there, and it was probably about this time that he married a second wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. after 1626). The couple had five children baptized at St Michael, Wood Street, between 1614 and 1624. By now one of the senior members of the Stationers' Company, Field served as the company's master in 1619 and 1622.<br>
<br>Field died between 24 November 1624, when he made his will, and 1 December, when he was buried at St Michael, Wood Street. His will was proved on 14 December. He split his estate equally among his wife, his children, and various other legatees, including his stepchildren Manassas and James Vautrollier, and his former apprentice George Miller, who eventually took over the business. Field's three surviving sons claimed their portions when they came of age between 1640 and 1646, and in the latter year his son Henry claimed his freedom in the Stationers' Company by patrimony.<br>
