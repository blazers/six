<span class="headword">Garfield,  Leon</span>  (1921&#150;1996), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 14 July 1921 in Brighton, the younger son of David Kalman Garfield (<i>d</i>. 1951), businessman, and his wife, Rose, formerly Blaustein (<i>d</i>. 1964). He had one brother, David (<i>c</i>.1916&#150;1980). Of Jewish origin, the family lived in Brighton and Garfield was educated at Brighton grammar school (1932&#150;8), followed by a brief period of art studies at Regent Street Polytechnic, London, in 1939. His father, who was unable to pay the fees, arranged for him to work in a London office. This was cut short by the Second World War.<br>
<br>Garfield served as a private in the Royal Army Medical Corps, 1940&#150;46, including time with the war crimes investigation team. He acquired a position with the latter by falsely claiming he was an interpreter to avoid being sent to the Far East. His work included a period at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp retrieving evidence for trial. He married Lena Leah Davies (<i>b</i>. 1918/19), a saleswoman and ARP worker, on 27 April 1941 at Golders Green synagogue. They separated after a few months. During wartime service in Belgium he met his second wife, Vivien Dolores Alcock [<i>see below</i>], a commercial artist and later an established children's writer herself. Garfield divorced his first wife about 1946 and married Vivien Alcock at Hampstead register office, London, on 23 October 1948. They settled in Highgate in north London. His father disapproved of Garfield divorcing his first, Jewish, wife, to marry a non-Jew, and this led to a family rift. This fracture, in what was already a difficult father&#150;son relationship, affected Leon Garfield deeply, and was to surface in his writing. Garfield had trained in biochemistry and haematology during the war, and worked as a biochemical technician at the Whittington Hospital, Islington, north London, from 1946 to 1966. In 1964 the Garfields adopted a baby daughter, Jane Angela.<br>
<br>From 1969 Garfield worked as a full-time writer. His first book, <span class="italic">Jack Holborn</span> (1964), a story of adventure and piracy, was originally written as an adult novel. However, in the mid-1960s many promising new children's writers were being published, and Grace Hogarth, an editor at Constable, saw its potential as a children's story. This launched a writing career of three decades and more than thirty published works. In <span class="italic">Devil-in-the-Fog</span> (1966), which won the first <span class="italic">Guardian</span> award for children's fiction in 1967, George Treet, from a family of strolling players, searches for his own identity amid conflicting loyalties and surprise revelations. In <span class="italic">Smith</span> (1967), one of Garfield's best books, a London pickpocket's quest to decipher a stolen document leads him from a life of solitary deception to one of companionship and trust. In the macabre <span class="italic">Black Jack</span> (1968), in which an apprentice falls under the spell of a survivor of the gallows, Garfield diversified his output.<br>
<br>Garfield's versatility during this period is clear from his collaboration with Edward Blishen on two retellings of Greek myths, <span class="italic">The God Beneath the Sea</span> (1970), a Library Association Carnegie medal winner in 1971, and its sequel <span class="italic">The Golden Shadow</span> (1971). Garfield experimented with the ghost story in <span class="italic">Mr Corbett's Ghost</span> (1968) and the Faustian chiller <span class="italic">The Ghost Downstairs</span> (1972). He also produced shorter works, such as the series <span class="italic">The Apprentices</span> (1976&#150;8), a dozen linked stories, beginning with <span class="italic">The Lamplighter's Funeral</span>, about the sometimes bizarre lives and trades of young Londoners.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Apprentice</span> series, which many critics regard as Garfield's crowning achievement, consolidated many of his themes and techniques. Most of Garfield's children's books, atmospherically illustrated by Antony Maitland, are usually categorized as historical fiction. However, his history is more a matter of impressions than of precise dates and details. His characters are rarely linked to actual historical events but are often to be found in the richly realized miasma of an eighteenth- or nineteenth-century London slum. History in these works is used as an environment in which characters and plots can be developed, and Garfield evokes a sense of period through inventive, expressive language but without recourse to hindsight&#151;this is history as experienced by his characters, with no authorial presence. Themes of relationships, loyalties, and the search for identity recur often. Garfield's own difficult, ambivalent relationship with his father surfaces in various forms. His childhood memories of his father, and his adult revision of that understanding after his father's death, provided a double perspective which influenced the way Garfield wrote about relationships. This can be seen in <span class="italic">Devil-in-the-Fog</span>, where George's understanding of his father's identity and their relationship shifts and changes in the course of the book. Illusion is also a dominant motif&#151;fathers are absent, or appear in unexpected, sometimes unwelcome guises; villains and criminals may turn into friends and allies, and it is hard to discern the truth in a world of shifting perceptions. For his young heroes the getting of wisdom sometimes begets disillusion but stories generally end on a note of optimism, if not always of tidy closure. Garfield was a natural story-teller. His narratives, richly textured, entertaining, and inventive, demonstrate his command of language and plot.<br>
<br>Although the distinction between &#145;adult&#146; and &#145;for children&#146; often broke down in Garfield's novels, his later work was infused with a new, allegorical, often religious tone, most notable in <span class="italic">The Pleasure Garden</span> (1976) and <span class="italic">The Confidence Man</span> (1978). Garfield returned to the themes and successes of his early fiction with the Whitbread prize-winner <span class="italic">John Diamond</span> (1980), a story about a young boy dealing with problems inherited from his swindler father (David Kalman Garfield's lack of success in business, and rumours surrounding his financial dealings, possibly inspired this portrait). In <span class="italic">Blewcoat Boy</span> (1988) Nick's and Jubilee's fading memories of a real father are exchanged gradually for a new relationship with a substitute father.<br>
<br>In the latter part of his career, however, Garfield moved further away from children's fiction. In 1980 he produced a successful completed version of Charles Dickens's unfinished novel <span class="italic">The Mystery of Edwin Drood</span>, compounding critical opinion that in the combination of comedy, eccentricity, and tragedy, Garfield was comparable with Dickens. In 1982 he published his only &#145;adult&#146; novel, <span class="italic">The House of Cards</span>. His love of Shakespeare resulted in the critically acclaimed <span class="italic">Shakespeare Stories</span> (1985) and <span class="italic">Shakespeare Stories II</span> (1994); in the early 1990s he completed scripts for a television series of animated tales from Shakespeare. Garfield was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1985.<br>
<br>Known for his erudition, generosity, and talkativeness (particularly on the subject of Shakespeare), Garfield, who often wore bow ties and velvet jackets, is said to have had a dandified appearance. He died of cancer on 2 June 1996, at the Whittington Hospital, Islington, where he had once worked. He had been preparing a dramatization of <span class="italic">The Odyssey</span> for BBC radio at the time of his death.<br>
<br>Leon Garfield was one of the most prominent writers for children in the second half of the twentieth century. His novels, fast-paced and full of incident, owe much to the classic adventure story as epitomized by Robert Louis Stevenson. They have also been read and admired by adults, as he intended: he always said he wanted &#145;to write that old-fashioned thing, the family novel, accessible to the 12-year-old and readable by his elders&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). Several of his novels were adapted for television; <span class="italic">Black Jack</span> was made into a film directed by Ken Loach (it shared the International Jury award at Cannes in 1979) and the director John Huston made his last appearance in film in <span class="italic">Mr Corbett's Ghost</span> in 1987.<br>
<br>Garfield's second wife, <a name="cosubject_92562"></a><span class="headword">Vivien Dolores Alcock</span>  (1921&#150;2003), <span class="occ">children's writer</span>, was born at Lavender House, Brougham Road, Worthing, Sussex, on 23 September 1921, the youngest of three daughters of John Forster Alcock, mechanical engineer, and his wife, Marian Winifred, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pulman. Her mother was frequently ill, and Alcock and her sisters were often farmed out to relatives. She was educated at Devizes high school, Wiltshire, and then at the Oxford School of Art. She left in 1942 to join the Auxiliary Territorial Service. It was while serving as an ambulance driver in Belgium that she met Leon Garfield. She worked as a commercial artist at Gestetner from 1947 to 1953, and then as a secretary at the Whittington Hospital from 1953 to 1958. She had always harboured ambitions to be a writer, but it was not until 1980 that her first novel, <span class="italic">The Haunting of Cassie Palmer</span>, was published. Her last, <span class="italic">The Boy Who Swallowed a Ghost</span>, appeared in 2001. In between, she published (under her maiden name) more than twenty books, mostly written for older children, though including, for instance, <span class="italic">The Dancing Bush</span> (1991), a story for younger readers about a bush that comes to life at night. A number of her stories were televised, including <span class="italic">The Cuckoo Sister</span> (1985), about a girl reunited with her parents fifteen years after being stolen as a baby, and <span class="italic">The Trial of Anna Cotman</span> (1989), about a secret club where the penalties for breaking any of the rules are frighteningly severe. Her novels, though sometimes terrifying, were notable for their portrayal of character and their dry humour. Modest and almost painfully shy, she enjoyed painting and keeping large dogs. Following the death of her husband she moved from Highgate Woods to 86A Yerbury Road, Tufnell Park, London, where she died of cancer on 12 October 2003. She was survived by her daughter Jane.<br>
