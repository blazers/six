<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Herschell,  Farrer</span>, first Baron Herschell  (1837&#150;1899), <span class="occ">lord chancellor</span>, was born at Brampton, Huntingdonshire, on 2 November 1837, the eldest son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13104/', "Revd Ridley Haim Herschell (1807&#150;1864)")</script> and his first wife, Helen Skirving (<i>d</i>. 1853), daughter of William Mowbray, an Edinburgh merchant. Raised in a non-denominational form of dissent, he later adhered to the Church of England, with broad-church leanings.<br>
<br>On leaving his grammar school in south London Herschell was taken by his mother to Bonn in 1853 to complete his education at the university, but with her death a few months later this idea was abandoned. Following travels with his father he matriculated at London University in July 1855. In October he entered University College and graduated BA with honours in classics in 1857. A keen advocate of the extension of university provision, he afterwards served the university as examiner in common law (1872&#150;6), on the senate (from 1883), and from 1894 as chancellor. From early youth Herschell had proclaimed his vocation for the law. On 12 January 1858 he entered Lincoln's Inn and was called on 17 November 1860; he later became a bencher (8 May 1872) and was treasurer in 1886. He was a pupil of Thomas Chitty, the famous special pleader, and found a place in the chambers of James Hannen.<br>
<br>Herschell started out on the northern circuit with no connections and at first had to supplement his income by contributing to the <span class="italic">New Reports</span> (1863&#150;5). He soon gained a reputation, especially in commercial cases, and was able to confine his excursions to Liverpool and Manchester, eventually becoming Charles Russell's leading rival there. Blessed with a remarkable memory which usually enabled him to dispense with notes, he was not a great jury advocate but had few equals as a lucid presenter of facts and law. He took silk on 8 February 1872 and served as recorder of Carlisle from 10 October 1873 to June 1880. On 20 December 1876 he married Agnes Adela, third daughter of Edward Leigh Kindersley of Clyffe, Dorset, and granddaughter of the judge Richard Torin Kindersley.<br>
<br>Courted by both political parties, Herschell embraced Liberalism and at a by-election on 13 June 1874 became a member for Durham City. He recommended ambitious barristers to enter parliament, but few adapted their courtroom style to the very different requirements of the Commons as successfully as he. Herschell made his mark with an impressively grave and dignified speech on a controversial Admiralty circular concerning the surrender of fugitive slaves (24 February 1876) and thereafter commanded general respect, though he could not persuade the house to support his bill to discourage actions for breach of promise of marriage. His steadfast adherence to Gladstone's views on the Eastern question and Ireland bore fruit when the latter returned to power in 1880 and made him solicitor-general (3 May); he was knighted ten days later.<br>
<br>Herschell and the attorney-general, Sir Henry James, proved an unusually effective team of law officers. They met unprecedentedly heavy demands, particularly from the Foreign Office. The presentation of their opinions was admirably adapted to lay readers, and unlike many of their predecessors, they regularly attended the house. Herschell in particular was much admired for his stamina in combining onerous public duties, including leading roles in the <span class="roman">Irish Land Bill</span> (1881) and the <span class="roman">Bankruptcy Bill</span> (1883), with an enormous load of private work&#151;he appeared in almost every major case in the Lords and privy council at this time. The effect on his health became apparent only later.<br>
<br>Herschell had turned down a puisne judgeship in 1879 and subsequently declined offers to be a lord of appeal, to succeed Sir George Jessel as master of the rolls, and to be speaker. His judgement was called into question when, having had to vacate his seat through the changes wrought by the third <span class="roman">Reform Act</span>, he was defeated for Lonsdale North (Lancashire) at the election of November 1885. However, the ensuing political upheavals worked greatly to his advantage. When Gladstone formed his third administration Selborne and James declined to serve in a ministry planning Irish home rule and thus Herschell became lord chancellor, created Baron Herschell of the City of Durham on 8 February 1886. The defeat of the <span class="roman">Government of Ireland Bill</span> ended his brief tenure of office (3 August) and even his noted talents for conciliation, deployed at the &#145;round-table conference&#146; of January 1887, failed to bring Chamberlain and the Liberal Unionists back into the fold.<br>
<br>In opposition, Herschell was enabled to indulge his love of travelling&#151;spending, for example, part of the winter of 1891&#150;2 with the Gladstones at Biarritz&#151;but he was not idle in public affairs. After his masterly speech against the appointment of the Parnell commission in 1888 he dropped out of political life to some extent, but besides his judicial work he presided over royal commissions into the Metropolitan Board of Works, Indian currency, and vaccination, demonstrating his &#145;prodigious powers of acquisition and assimilation&#146;  (Atlay, 2.459) and impressive drafting skills. When Gladstone formed his last government in 1892, Herschell was the obvious choice for lord chancellor, and resumed the great seal on 15 August, staying on under Lord Rosebery until his ministry resigned on 22 June 1895.<br>
<br>Herschell had quickly learned how to manage the Lords from the woolsack, though &#145;an unfortunate tendency to distil a spirit of acrimony&#146;  (A. Fitzroy, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 1926, 1.11) was noticed, and he grew irked by the crushing weight of the Conservative majority, which led him to espouse reform of the upper house. Always an enthusiast for codification and consolidation, he had encouraged his former pupil McKenzie Chalmers in his <span class="roman">Bills of Exchange Act</span> (1882), and was now able to pass his <span class="roman">Sale of Goods Act</span> (1893), also assisting the parliamentary counsel with the <span class="roman">Merchant Shipping Act</span> of 1894. He also secured the passage of two measures to restrict betting and continued to press, in modified form, Halsbury's plans to extend title registration and assimilate real and personal property, though they were not enacted until 1897.<br>
<br>Although advocating reforms to coroners' courts, Herschell showed little inclination to tackle the defects of the superior courts, ignoring proposals for a court of criminal appeal and making only minor adjustments to the assizes. His dispensation of judicial patronage, however, was praised as scrupulously unpartisan. Having categorically refused to pack Liberals into the magistracy to reduce the tory majority, he was driven to distraction and uncharacteristic petulance by the persistent importunities of his parliamentary party.<br>
<br>It was said that Herschell aspired to a more overtly political office and many considered him admirably qualified, but the only offer he received was viceroy of India. He was however made GCB in 1893 and was held in high regard by the queen and by the Liberal Party.<br>
<br>Though he clashed with Halsbury over the latter's handling of the great Labour case of <i>Allen v. Flood</i> (1898), Herschell's services were again in demand by the Conservatives. In 1898 he agreed to sit on two commissions arising from disputes with the USA over the boundaries of Venezuela and Alaska respectively. After presiding over an inquiry into the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, of which he was a vice-president, he went to Washington for the Canadian arbitration in August 1898 and there, the following February, he was injured in a fall and died unexpectedly in the Shoreham Hotel on 2 March 1899. His body was brought home and buried at Tincleton church, Dorset. He was survived by his wife, who died at Pau on 23 February 1902, two married daughters, and an only son, Richard Farrer (<i>d</i>. 1929).<br>
<br>Herschell was of middle height and slightly built, with regular features and dark eyes. He derived his taste for music, his principal recreation, from his mother. Sociable, ready with anecdotes, and generous to unsuccessful barristers, he was generally well liked. On the bench he became somewhat overbearing and was notorious in later years for interrupting counsel, but contemporaries rated his judgments very highly. However, he conceived the judicial function narrowly: &#145;we have to interpret the law, not make it&#146;  (<i>Salomon v. Salomon</i>, 1897). This espousal of strict formalism, and the unornamented and utilitarian style of his judgments, has diminished his reputation in some quarters. Nevertheless his judgments, ranging across most important areas of the common law, remain admirable specimens of accurate legal reasoning and include several of great importance in the development of company and commercial law, such as <i>Derry v. Peek</i> (1889) and <i>Salomon v. Salomon</i>.<br>
<br>Herschell had an unusually wide range of interests outside the law. He was on the council of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science; was president of the Society of Comparative Legislation (1894); an original member and later president of the Selden Society; president of the Imperial Institute; a freemason and company director. He was honoured by the universities of Durham (DCL, 1882), Oxford (DCL, 1886), and Cambridge (LLD, 1893); and he was captain of Deal Castle from 1890 and deputy lieutenant for Kent and Durham.<br>
