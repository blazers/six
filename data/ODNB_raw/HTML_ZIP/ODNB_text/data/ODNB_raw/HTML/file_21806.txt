<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pellegrini,  Carlo</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Ape]</span>  (1839&#150;1889), <span class="occ">caricaturist</span>, was born in March 1839 in Capua, Campania, Italy, a scion of the Sedili Capuani, an aristocratic landowning family. His mother was said to be a descendant of the Medici. He was educated at the Collegio Barnibiti, and then at Sant' Antonio in Maddaloni, near Naples. Barely 5 feet 2 inches tall, with an unusually large head and ridiculously tiny feet, his winning personality attracted a variety of friends and patrons. By his twentieth year he was a &#145;pet&#146; of fashionable Neapolitan society and he developed &#145;an extravagant taste for the pleasures of the high life&#146;  (E. Harris, 53). In return he humorously caricatured his friends, inspired no doubt by reproductions of Melchiorre Delfico's <i>portraits charg&eacute;s</i> of Verdi and other prominent Neapolitan personalities. He apparently had no formal artistic training.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1860 he joined Garibaldi's forces and fought in the last battles against the Bourbons at the Volturno and at Capua. He then returned to Neapolitan society. On 9 November 1862 he celebrated the coming-of-age of the visiting prince of Wales&#151;an encounter which seems crucial to his career  (E. Harris, 53&#150;4). Less than two years later he unexpectedly left Italy, propelled, he asserted, by an unrequited love and the death of a sister. After travelling across Europe he arrived in London in November 1864. Poverty, he claimed, forced him to sleep on doorsteps in Piccadilly and Whitehall, and even in a hansom cab  (Ward, 97). Nevertheless he swiftly became an ornament in bohemian society, and a court jester in the prince of Wales's set.<br>
<br>Pellegrini produced amusing caricatures of his royal companions; some are now in the Royal Library, Windsor. These came to the attention of the politician and newspaper proprietor Thomas Gibson Bowles, who commissioned him, as Singe, to produce coloured <i>portraits charg&eacute;s</i> of Disraeli and Gladstone in January and February 1869 for <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span>, Bowles's new society magazine. Reproduced as full-page illustrations by Vincent Brooks, then London's premier lithographer, they were an immediate success. Drawings by Ape (the <i>nom de crayon</i> Pellegrini used at <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span>) shaped modern English caricature. They were styled after Delfico, Honor&eacute; Daumier, and the French school, which had itself been influenced in the 1830s by the Georgian caricaturists. &#145;Thus Pellegrini's coming to England and his subsequent triumphs in London closed the circle of European caricaturing&#146;  (Matthews and Mellini, 29). He inspired a raft of caricaturists: Spy (Sir Leslie Ward) was his grudging disciple, and Max Beerbohm idolized him, collected his work, and imitated him. Pellegrini was, Beerbohm wrote, &#145;by far the best caricaturist who lived within our time&#146;  (Beerbohm, 261). David Low called him:<blockquote>a genius in his specialty. &hellip; Ape's caricatures were maximum likenesses, that is to say they represented not only what he saw but also what he knew. Most of them today look as though they were probably more like the persons they depict than were these persons themselves. (Low, 33)</blockquote>Pelican, as Pellegrini was known to his bohemian friends, fell under Whistler's spell in the 1870s, with farcical results. He left <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> in 1871&#150;2 and again in 1876 to caricature his society friends and to try to be a portraitist. His lithographs of twenty members of the Marlborough Club are now in the entrance hall to the royal enclosure at Ascot. His talent for portraiture did not equal his genius for caricature. His contemporaries agreed, as have more recent critics, that &#145;Being a good portrait painter is more than catching a likeness; and everyone would agree with Mrs. Jopling, &#147;this essential &#145;more&#146; Pellegrini did not possess&#148;&#146;  (E. Harris, 57). Ape returned to <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> in early 1877. Until his death he shared the caricaturing with Spy and several other artists. Between 1869 and his death he caricatured 332 prominent Victorians for <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span>; a number of his original drawings, most in gouache, are in the National Portrait Gallery, London; and the Royal Library, Windsor, also has a collection of his working drawings. His original drawings are highly prized by collectors because they reveal his incisive, affectionately witty eye.<br>
<br>Short and stout, Pellegrini was extremely fastidious, wore immaculate white spats and highly polished boots, and cultivated long Mandarin-like fingernails. He never walked when he could ride. He was kind, generous, and had a seemingly unending fund of charming tales and eccentricities. His fractured English, his flaunted homosexuality, his various whims which included bringing macaroni dishes to elegant dinner parties, his refusal of invitations to country houses for fear of strange beds, his habit of keeping a cigar in his mouth as he slept, his improvidence&#151;all were tolerated (and sometimes relished) because he was such entertaining company. &#145;Whatever he did and wherever he went, he was the life and soul of the party&#146;  (E. Harris, 57). His dinners with the composer Paolo Tosti in the back parlour of Pagani's in Great Portland Street became a celebrated bohemian rendezvous in Victorian London. His caricatures, sketches, and the bars of music and other graffiti on the walls of Pagani's &#145;artist's room&#146; survived the blitz and are now preserved by the BBC.<br>
<br>Generous to a fault, Pellegrini never lacked for friends. When debilitated by tuberculosis his fashionable friends raised the money for his care in a private hospital, settled all his debts, and provided the luxuries to which he was accustomed until he died at his home, 53 Mortimer Street, Cavendish Square, London, on 22 January 1889. The Fine Arts Society sold a proof from a destroyed plate of his much admired caricature of Whistler, with Whistler's signature, to pay for his gravestone in Kensal Green Roman Catholic cemetery, London.<br>
