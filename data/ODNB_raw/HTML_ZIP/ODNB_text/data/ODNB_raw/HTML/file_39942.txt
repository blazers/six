<span class="headword">Murdoch,  Richard Bernard</span>  (1907&#150;1990), <span class="occ">actor and comedian</span>, was born on 6 April 1907 at the family home in Keston, Kent, the only son of Bernard Murdoch, tea merchant, and his wife, Amy Florence, daughter of Avison Terry Scott, archdeacon of Tonbridge. He was educated at Charterhouse School and at Pembroke College, Cambridge, which he left without gaining a degree, his appetite for a career in show business being whetted by success with the Cambridge Footlights.<br>
<br>Murdoch's professional stage career began in 1927 at the King's Theatre, Southsea, in the chorus of the musical play <span class="italic">The Blue Train</span>. He then worked in the chorus and played small parts in various musical comedies and revues including <span class="italic">That's a Good Girl</span> (1928), <span class="italic">Oh Letty!</span> (1929), <span class="italic">Cochran's 1930 Revue</span>, and <span class="italic">Stand up and Sing</span> (1931). This was followed in the 1930s by Andr&eacute; Charlot's West End revues and the musical comedy <span class="italic">Over she Goes</span> (1936). By the mid-1930s his reputation as a first-class light comedian was growing. In 1932 he married Peggy, daughter of William Rawlings, solicitor. They had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1938 the BBC teamed Murdoch with Arthur Askey in the radio series <span class="italic">Band Waggon</span>, in which they were alleged to live in a flat in Broadcasting House, and many sketches were based on this notion. Their humour was a forerunner of much radio comedy to come, for although their comic interludes took up only ten minutes of the weekly one-hour programme, the fantasy of their living in Broadcasting House, and the creation of such mythical characters as Mrs Bagwash the charlady and her daughter Nausea and their pet animals, a goat called Lewis, and two pigeons Basil and Lucy, preceded <span class="italic">ITMA</span> and <span class="italic">Hancock's Half Hour</span> and was a strong influence on many nascent comedy scriptwriters.<br>
<br>In 1938, after two series, the stage rights to <span class="italic">Band Waggon</span> were acquired by the impresario Jack Hylton, and Murdoch with Askey and a supporting cast toured the provincial music-halls and finished with a run at the London Palladium in 1939. The debonair, sophisticated West End style of Murdoch blended neatly with the more down-to-earth humour of Liverpudlian Arthur Askey, whose reputation was based on his successes in seaside concert parties. It was Askey who gave Murdoch the nickname Stinker. Together they were enormously successful.<br>
<br>In 1941 Murdoch joined the Royal Air Force as a pilot officer working in the intelligence sector of Bomber Command. Later he was posted to the Air Ministry in London, where he was promoted to squadron leader in the directorate of administrative plans, under the command of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37568/', "Wing Commander Kenneth Horne")</script>. The two quickly became friends and as both were regular broadcasters it was only a matter of time (1944) before they dreamed up the mythical RAF station <span class="italic">Much Binding in the Marsh</span>. This became the RAF segment of a services series <span class="italic">Merry Go Round</span>, alternating with the Royal Navy show <span class="italic">HMS Waterlogged</span>, written by and starring Eric Barker, and the army contribution <span class="italic">Stand Easy</span>, with Charlie Chester.<br>
<br>Murdoch and Horne wrote the scripts of the <span class="italic">Much Binding</span> shows and when peace came in 1945 they duly transferred it to a civilian milieu, where it thrived until 1954. From then on Richard Murdoch's career was varied and interesting and included a tour of South Africa, a season in Canada playing William the waiter in G. B. Shaw's <span class="italic">You Never can Tell</span>, and a round-the-world trip for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in a series of programmes called <span class="italic">Much Murdoch</span>.<br>
<br>His next major success was the BBC radio series <span class="italic">The Men from the Ministry</span> (1961&#150;77), in which he co-starred first with Wilfrid Hyde-White and later with Deryck Guyler. Towards the end of his life Richard Murdoch appeared in several episodes of the television series <span class="italic">Rumpole of the Bailey</span>, playing the aged barrister Uncle Tom.<br>
<br>Murdoch was 6 feet 1 inch tall and good looking. He was always polished and well mannered and was, to quote James Green, the show business columnist, &#145;a subtle and charming comic actor&#146;. Murdoch died on 9 October 1990. As a keen golfer he could not have wished for a better end, for he died while playing golf at Walton Heath, Surrey.<br>
