</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blake,  Robert Norman William</span>, Baron Blake  (1916&#150;2003), <span class="occ">historian and college head</span>, was born at Brundall, Norfolk, on 23 December 1916, the elder son of William Joseph Blake, schoolmaster, and his wife, Norah Lindley, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Daynes, the daughter of a leading Norwich solicitor. He was born two weeks after Lloyd George and Bonar Law ejected Asquith from 10 Downing Street&#151;an episode on which he later wrote in much detail. He was very much a Norfolk man, supposedly descended from that other Robert Blake, Cromwell's admiral, and he was devoted to East Anglia all his life. His future wife also came from Norfolk while the one post which almost enticed him from Oxford was the vice-chancellorship of the new University of East Anglia in the 1960s.<h2>
<a name="Educationwarserviceandearlycareer"></a>Education, war service, and early career</h2>From being taught in a dame school in Brundall, Blake went as a day boy to King Edward VI School, Norwich, where his father taught him history. It was decided not to enter him for the Eton scholarship examinations because of their emphasis on classics. He went on to Magdalen College, Oxford, on an Eldon law scholarship, but he decided to read philosophy, politics, and economics (modern greats) instead of law. He gained first-class honours despite diversions that included a hockey blue and playing cricket (as a pacy opening bowler) for the Oxford Authentics. One friend at Magdalen was the future Conservative politician Keith Joseph.<br>
<br>Blake considered becoming a lawyer but the Second World War intervened, and it saw him engaged in fierce active service in the western desert in the 124th field regiment of the Royal Artillery. He was captured when Tobruk fell in June 1942 and was sent to Italy as a prisoner of war. He and two British colleagues managed a daring escape and were given refuge by a peasant family. Eventually they got away, evading both Italian soldiers and fierce red-eyed wolves in the harsh winter of 1943&#150;4, to rejoin the Eighth Army. Blake described in unfinished memoirs these exciting military experiences, which led to his being mentioned in dispatches. In the latter stages of the war he worked for MI6, one colleague being the apparently harmless Kim Philby.<br>
<br>Blake's academic career began in 1947 when he succeeded Lord Pakenham, now a member of Attlee's Labour government, as student and politics tutor at Christ Church, Oxford. There he rapidly built up a distinctive personal role, bonding closely in university politics with such colleagues as Hugh Trevor-Roper and Roy Harrod, serving as a university proctor and as senior censor (senior tutor) of the college in 1953&#150;6, and upholding its interests vigorously against the threat of a highway being bulldozed through Christ Church meadow. Blake readily acknowledged that this was a Conservative-inspired project, eventually thwarted by Harold Wilson's Labour government in 1965. He nevertheless showed himself to be an active tory, serving as a Conservative city councillor (from 1957 to 1964) and a magistrate, and defending the Eden government in the 1956 Suez crisis.<br>
<br>What made Blake's national reputation was a series of authoritative works on modern British history. The first was a skilful edition of the diaries of Field Marshal Haig (1952), a project facilitated by Trevor-Roper (who later married Haig's daughter), which began a partial rehabilitation of the reputation of that controversial commander. The revelation of Haig's blunt views on the French generals (kept hidden in Duff Cooper's biography of Haig) caused some stir in France. But Blake, like another Oxford historian, A. J. P. Taylor, later, moved on to a higher plane of celebrity when he was introduced to Lord Beaverbrook. One factor that particularly impressed the old press baron was Blake's ability to consume large quantities of champagne without apparent effect. It was a talent that endured. The outcome was a fine, trenchant biography of Bonar Law, <span class="italic">The Unknown Prime Minister</span> (1955), which brought the career of this apparently drab politician vividly to life by locating him precisely within the <i>Sturm und Drang</i> of British politics between 1910 and 1923. Blake illuminated Bonar Law's relationship with Lloyd George as no other writer had done, and provided a remarkably balanced analysis of the Ulster question. However, his account of an alleged bridge game involving the prime minister, Herbert Asquith, on Whit Monday 1916 at the height of the First World War, was savaged by Asquith's daughter, Lady Violet Bonham-Carter, and Beaverbrook had reluctantly to help out, which diminished his regard for Blake thereafter. An important personal landmark was Blake's marriage on 22 August 1953 to Patricia Mary Waters (1925&#150;1995) of The Grove, Great Plumstead, Norfolk, the daughter of Thomas Richard Waters, farmer. Trevor-Roper was best man. It was an exceptionally serene marriage, which produced three lively daughters.<h2>
<a name="Biographerandhistorian"></a>Biographer and historian</h2>Blake's scholarly masterpiece was his majestic biography <span class="italic">Disraeli</span> (1966). Himself a man of seemingly conventional views, with the rubicund appearance of a country squire, Blake wrote of this colourful Jewish <i>arriviste</i> in vivid fashion, sparing nothing in his account of the raffish sex life, money troubles, and driving ambitions of the &#145;the most potent myth-maker in British history&#146;. Blake also wrote brilliantly on Disraeli's novels, <span class="italic">Sybil</span> and <span class="italic">Coningsby</span> with their feel for the social realities of industrial and political life, <span class="italic">Tancred</span> with its eccentric flights of orientalism, and <span class="italic">Lothair</span> with its &#145;fascinating but faintly disturbing ambiguity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Disraeli</span>, 735). Blake saw Disraeli as living &#145;in the long shadow of the Byronic Myth&#146;  (ibid., 52), but he also shared his subject's passion for the poet and was a member of the Byron Society. It was widely thought that Blake went too far in playing down Disraeli's concern for the trade unions and impact on the social legislation of his government of 1874&#150;80. But it was a dazzling book, as strong on foreign and imperial matters as on domestic, and it led to Blake's being elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1967.<br>
<br>Blake next intended to write a large biography of another Conservative prime minister, Lord Derby, but he lost interest. Instead, he wrote a best-selling general survey, based on his 1968 Ford lectures, <span class="italic">The Conservative Party from Peel to Churchill</span> (1970; later extended to include Margaret Thatcher and, in 1997, John Major). Written with admirable economy, it accounted for the success of the party in terms of its adaptable, undoctrinaire nature. Even though he switched his allegiance from Edward Heath (who gave him his peerage, as Baron Blake, in 1971) to Margaret Thatcher, he delivered views in the 1980s that read like a Peelite warning against contemporary versions of &#145;stern unbending toryism&#146;. His Romanes lecture of 1992 was highly sympathetic towards Gladstone, and he also directed enthusiastically the multi-volume edition of Gladstone's diaries by Colin Matthew. His mother's family, the Dayneses, had a strong Gladstonian Liberal tradition.<br>
<br>Blake perhaps never again recaptured the <i>&eacute;lan</i> of his Disraelian high noon, but he continued to be an active and greatly respected historian for the next thirty years. His <span class="italic">History of Rhodesia</span> (1977) was an interestingly different kind of book, essentially a study of white rule from Rhodes onwards, ending with sharp comments on the illegal breakaway regime of Ian Smith, where Blake's views were much influenced by his friendship with the liberal Garfield Todd. His later works included a fair-minded textbook, <span class="italic">The Decline of Power, 1915&#150;1964</span> (1985), an excellent volume of essays on Winston Churchill (1993), edited jointly with William Roger Louis of the University of Texas, and a final study of the trading house of Jardine Matheson (1989) which had involved several agreeable colonial-style visits to Hong Kong. In addition to his own flow of publications he worked vigorously to facilitate publication by others. He was a long-term delegate to the Oxford University Press, and with Christine Nicholls was editor of two large supplements to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> (that for 1971&#150;80, published in 1986, and that for 1981&#150;5, published in 1990), injecting new momentum into a project somewhat flagging at the time, and directed by Blake with his usual urbanity. He himself wrote the entry on Anthony Eden, whom he had known well. Meanwhile he also fulfilled other important roles in academia and elsewhere, including chairing the Rhodes Trust (1983&#150;7) and the Historical Manuscripts Commission (1982&#150;9), serving as a trustee of the British Museum (1978&#150;88), on the board of Channel 4 television (1983&#150;6), and as high bailiff and searcher of the sanctuary (1988&#150;9) and high steward (1989&#150;99) of Westminster Abbey.<h2>
<a name="ProvostofQueensCollege"></a>Provost of Queen's College</h2>In his later career, as well as being a leading Oxford historian, Blake became a major Oxford personality. In 1968 he was elected provost of Queen's College, where his genial and gregarious style helped massively in turning a somewhat cantankerous body of dons into a happy and thriving community. His wife, Patricia, also contributed to this end, and on her death in 1995 was given the unique honour for a provost's spouse of a college memorial service. Blake presided admirably over both the governing body and the high table. He particularly enjoyed the company of Labour guests, notably Michael Foot, with whom he shared a common interest in Byron and Disraeli. The hauteur of a head of house was always spiced with personal kindliness towards college associates and with humour. When college tenants on a progress explained that they were being paid for the non-cultivation of land, Blake observed that Queen's might be paid for not teaching classics. He seldom took a controversial line in college matters, except when he spoke against Queen's admitting women undergraduates. He advanced then views somewhat similar to those offered by Peel in opposing the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> of 1832. However, Blake accepted a heavy defeat with his usual good humour, and he vigorously opposed sex discrimination as chairman of the Rhodes Trust.<br>
<br>One of the many reasons why Blake's provostship from 1968 to 1987 was such a great success, however, was that he was outward-looking, with worlds outside Oxford. His university and political activities intersected in clubland and he was a member at various times of Brooks's, Pratt's, the Beefsteak, and the Oxford and Cambridge. The journalist Alan Watkins wrote that when he went to London to enjoy the political or media scene Blake &#145;went into overdrive&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 25 Sept 2003). His parliamentary interests were reflected in some magisterial pronouncements in the Lords, often embellished with historical analogies as on Ireland or constitutional matters. These usually reflected the Conservative orthodoxy: thus Blake became increasingly Eurosceptic. A radical exception, however, was that, in the Hansard Society's report of 1976 and later as chairman of the Electoral Reform Society, Blake became a strong supporter of proportional representation. He also joined a revolt of tory peers over the <span class="roman">War Crimes Bill</span>.<h2>
<a name="Lateryearsandassessment"></a>Later years, and assessment</h2>Blake left Queen's and Oxford in 1987 in less than agreeable circumstances. He stood for the chancellorship of the university, in succession to Harold Macmillan, earl of Stockton, but was narrowly defeated (by 575 votes) by a fellow historian, Roy Jenkins. As a loyal supporter of Margaret Thatcher, Blake was chagrined to discover that Oxonian Tory MPs and peers were dispatched to Oxford with instructions to vote for the dissident former leader, Edward Heath, who split the Conservative vote. Blake regarded this as betrayal by the tory whips. He seldom returned to Oxford thereafter, but kept his distance somewhat from the Lords, and retired to his Norfolk home, Riverview House, Brundall, inherited from his mother's family in 1966, to write. One enjoyable interlude was a semester as Cline professor of English literature at the University of Texas in Austin, where he lectured on the novels of Trollope. His retirement was sadly interrupted in 1997 by a fall at the Oxford and Cambridge Club which led to a leg being amputated. He remained active, however, reviewing books, penning a long-running column in the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> (where he succeeded another Queen's man, Arthur Bryant), and pronouncing on the radio as a &#145;constitutional expert&#146;, especially on the monarchy. His views on constitutional questions were sought by the queen's private secretary. It was said that Blake represented in his own person the unwritten constitution. His public engagements became much more occasional after the death of his wife. But he kept busy in Brundall, starting to write his memoirs in a converted coach-house, and enjoying his garden and the views of the River Yare. At the time of his death from coronary scelerosis, at his home on 20 September 2003, he was anticipating the visit of a television crew, busy to the end. He was buried in the parish church nearby at Braydeston.<br>
<br>Blake was a man of understated wisdom, shrewd judgement, courtesy, and good humour, excellent company on all occasions. He was as pleasant a guest as he was a host, with a genuine interest in others, emphasized by a stooping posture when he met them. As a historian he was sometimes underestimated. There was no flashiness of style, no arresting Blake thesis or overarching doctrine. He was never caught up in historical or personal controversies as was his Christ Church colleague and friend Hugh Trevor-Roper. New developments in historiography in the 1980s and 1990s made scant impact on him. However, he was consistently successful in making his books readable without sacrificing their scholarly quality. He brought his subjects to life both in print and on the platform. His masterpiece on Disraeli was described by an American scholar, Clarence Cline, as &#145;the best biography of anyone in any language&#146;  (private information); his life of Bonar Law was not far behind. Above all, he was chronicler and custodian of British Conservatism. Almost single-handedly he revived historical study of the Conservative Party, and gave it new academic prestige. As a man, blending simplicity with sophistication, he was widely felt by colleagues far removed from his political outlook to have represented many of the humane virtues and the best values of Oxford college life. There is a portrait of him by John Whittall (1982) in the senior common room of Queen's.<br>
