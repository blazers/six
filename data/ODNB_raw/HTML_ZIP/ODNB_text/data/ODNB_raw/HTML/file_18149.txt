<span class="headword">Marshall,  Thomas</span>  (1621&#150;1685), <span class="occ">dean of Gloucester and philologist</span>, the son of Thomas Marshall (<i>d</i>. 1628), an illiterate blacksmith, and Helen James, was born at Barkby, Leicestershire, on 13 January 1621. Educated by Francis Foe, vicar of Barkby and alumnus of Lincoln College, Oxford, Marshall matriculated as a servitor of that same college on 23 October 1640. On 31 July 1641 he was elected to a Robert Trappes scholarship which he held until 1648. An ardent royalist, in 1644 Marshall joined at his own expense the university regiment commanded by Henry, earl of Dover, for which he was excused payment of the normal fees at his graduation as BA in 1645. Before his expulsion for absence by the parliamentary visitors on 14 July 1648 he went to Holland and in 1650 became chaplain to the Company of Merchant Adventurers in Rotterdam. In 1656 he moved with the company to Dordrecht where he resided until his return to England in 1672.<br>
<br>At Oxford, Marshall developed a taste for theology and philology, undoubtedly inspired by the orientalist Edward Pococke and James Ussher, archbishop of Armagh, whose sermons he attended and whom &#145;he made the pattern for all religious and learned actions in his life&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2nd edn, 1721, 2.782&#150;3). In Holland, Marshall continued to cultivate and expand his knowledge of theology as well as of ancient languages, and met leading scholars such as the Arabist Jacob Golius, the polymath Isaac Vossius, and the philologist Francis Junius. In the late 1650s or early 1660s Junius requested Marshall to edit the Anglo-Saxon gospels, which he intended to publish with the Gothic translation facing. In the following years Marshall produced this edition and two volumes of commentary: <span class="italic">Observationes de versione Gothica</span> and <span class="italic">Observationes in versionem Anglo-Saxonicam</span>. The whole was published in 1665 as <span class="italic">Quatuor D.N.J.C. Evangeliorum &hellip; versiones</span>. The <span class="italic">Observationes</span> were the first manifestation of Marshall's scholarly versatility, combining his knowledge of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> with both Germanic and oriental languages. They incorporate the truly humanist combination of theology with philology and grammar that was so characteristic of his work.<br>
<br>Junius, Marshall's teacher of Gothic, stimulated his interest in Germanic languages, and provided him with material. Marshall briefly collected notes for an Old English and a Gothic grammar, both of which he abandoned prematurely, but made serious attempts to produce an edition of King Alfred's Old English translation of Orosius. His annotations to an incunable edition of Old Frisian law reveal his interest in Anglo-Saxon canon law. Marshall also pioneered the study of Icelandic, and possessed seventeen Middle Dutch manuscripts, mostly religious texts. His Germanic studies are characterized by sagacity and precision, and differ from Junius's in their deliberate attention to grammar.<br>
<br>In the course of the 1660s Marshall's contacts with Oxford show his increasing occupation with oriental studies. He corresponded with English orientalists such as Thomas Smith, Robert Sheringham, Edward Bernard, and Samuel Clarke, whom he supported by procuring manuscripts and books, including Apollonius's <span class="italic">Conics</span>, from the Low Countries. In Holland he bought some of his Coptic manuscripts, as well as several Armenian books. Marshall presumably edited Abudacnus's <span class="italic">Historia Jacobitarum, seu, Coptorum in Egypto</span> (1675), to which he supplied a preface announcing his forthcoming edition of the Coptic gospels. Collations and transcripts of Coptic, Greek, Arabic, and Ethiopic gospels, as well as his Coptic vocabulary are the preliminaries to a project that never materialized. Together with Thomas Hyde, Marshall supervised the publication of the gospels and <span class="roman">Acts</span> in Malay (1677), to which he wrote the preface. Marshall's publications never matched his erudition. His most important contribution to oriental studies consists of his generous assistance to others.<br>
<br>Marshall also contributed to the development of the Oxford University Press by procuring types on the continent, including Junius's matrices of Old English letters, at the request of Bishop John Fell. He was furthermore involved in the compilation of Richard Parr's life of Ussher, and published anonymously <span class="italic">The Catechism Set Forth in the Book of Common Prayer</span> (1679).<br>
<br>After the Restoration Marshall took his BD in Oxford <i>in absentia</i> by the licence of Archbishop Sheldon. Still in Holland, he was elected fellow of Lincoln College (17 December 1668), and received his DD (28 June 1669). On the resignation of Nathaniel, Lord Crewe, Marshall was elected rector of Lincoln (19 October 1672), after which he returned to Oxford for good. He was made a royal chaplain and held the rectorship at Bladon from May 1680 to February 1682. In 1681 he became dean of Gloucester. Marshall, who never married, died in Lincoln College on 18 April 1685, and was buried in All Saints' Church. He bequeathed 453 books and 159 manuscripts to the Bodleian Library, and 1040 books and 77 volumes of civil war pamphlets to Lincoln College. Marshall's executor John Kettlewell inherited his Socinian books, on condition that they &#145;not come into the hands of others, that may be corrupted by them&#146;. The remainder of his estate was sold and most of the proceeds were left to Lincoln College to provide financial support for &#145;poor schollars&#146;. &#145;Marshall's scholars&#146; were regularly elected from 1688 to 1765, when the scholarships ceased to be distinctively designated.<br>
