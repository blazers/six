<span class="headword">Hickes,  John</span>  (1633&#150;1685), <span class="occ">clergyman, ejected minister, and rebel</span>, was born at Moorhouse Farm in Newsham, near Kirby Wiske, Yorkshire, the son of William Hickes of Stonegrave, Yorkshire, and his wife, Elizabeth Kay of Topcliffe, Yorkshire. After being educated at Thirsk he graduated BA from Trinity College, Dublin, in 1655, was a fellow there, and in 1656 became minister at Ballyroan, Queen's county. On 2 October 1657 he was appointed curate at Saltash, Cornwall, and, beginning in 1659, he also served as rector of nearby Stoke Damerel, Devon, following the death of German Gouldson (Goldstone). He was ejected from Stoke Damerel prior to 17 November 1660, when a new rector was installed, and subsequently from Saltash, where his successor subscribed under the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> on 5 August 1662. Hickes remained at Saltash, and was one of six dissenting ministers living there in 1665. Following the passage of the <span class="roman">File Mile Act</span>, he moved to Kingsbridge, Devon, where he associated with the dissenting ministers James Birdwood, Christopher Jellinger, and Edmund Tucker. He and his first wife, Abigail (1632&#150;1675), daughter of John Howe, minister of Loughborough, Leicestershire, and sister of the presbyterian minister John Howe, had five children: John; William, who became rector of Broughton Gifford, Wiltshire; Abigail, who was baptized at Saltash on 1 December 1667; Catherine; and Elizabeth, wife of the martyrologist John Tutchin.<br>
<br>After justices in Devon and Cornwall began enforcing the 1670 <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span>, Hickes chronicled some of their activities in <span class="italic">A True and Faithful Narrative, of the Unjust and Illegal Sufferings</span>, published anonymously in 1671. Calling for royal intervention, he denounced informers as unreliable witnesses, argued that meetings held openly were not seditious conventicles, insisted that penal laws be applied justly and rationally, and asserted that religious persecution harmed the country's economy. Having been charged with murder after a magistrate died, allegedly as the result of forcibly dispersing a conventicle in his house, Hickes went into hiding between 11 September 1670 and February 1671. When the king saw Hickes's <span class="italic">Narrative</span> he was irate, but in December 1671 Thomas Blood, whom Hickes would have met in Ireland, intervened on his behalf. On 2 January 1672 Charles II pardoned Hickes and such dissidents as Ralph Alexander, Robert Perrott, Nicholas Lockyer, and Blood's son for all acts of treason and other crimes committed since 29 May 1660.<br>
<br>For much of 1672 Hickes remained in London, assisting numerous dissenters to obtain licences under the declaration of indulgence; of his 515 applications (282 from Devon), 86 were successful. Most of those he helped were presbyterians and congregationalists, though at least one, Adam Pearse of Exeter, was a Baptist. Many were from the south-west but others were from as far away as Yorkshire, Northumberland, and Lancashire. Hickes acquired a general licence for himself as a presbyterian on 2 April, and licences for his house at Kingsbridge on 11 April, a new meeting-house there on 30 September, and (if actually issued) his house at Hatton Garden, London, on 23 December. On 6 April 1672 he and Thomas Martin of Plymouth presented the king with a declaration of thanks from seventy-two nonconforming ministers in Devon, and he probably wrote or influenced similar statements from Cornwall and Wiltshire. Hickes also persuaded Charles to remit a third of the fines levied on dissenters in the west for holding conventicles.<br>
<br>The persecution deeply impressed Hickes, who addressed it again in the epistle to <span class="italic">A Discourse of the Excellency of the Heavenly Substance</span> (1673), in which he protested that nonconformists suffered more at the hands of fellow protestants than did Catholics. He also noted that during the preceding decade he had been forced to find employment outside the ministry and had found little opportunity to study. After the indulgence was cancelled he continued to preach, and in August 1673 was fined &pound;20 for doing so at Exeter. On 4 July 1674 the bishop of Exeter, Anthony Sparrow, noting that he had persuaded the lord keeper to restore a JP dismissed because of Hickes's complaints, protested to the chancellor that Hickes was disturbing the peace. By 1675 Hickes was ministering to a congregation at Portsmouth, where magistrates disrupted his conventicle on 14 October 1677 and fined the owner of the house. Following the death of his first wife in 1675, he married a widow, Elizabeth Mills (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1705), the daughter of John Moody, a Portsmouth maltster, and his wife, Elizabeth Arnold. They had two children, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1678), who married Captain Luke Spicer of the Royal Navy, and James (<i>b</i>. 1679). In 1681 or 1682 Hickes moved to Keynsham, Somerset.<br>
<br>Convinced that Monmouth was Charles II's legitimate heir, Hickes joined the duke at Shepton Mallet, Somerset, on 24 June 1685. He later insisted that he had not recruited men for Monmouth's forces or recommended that the duke assume the title of king at Taunton. When the rebellion collapsed, he and the attorney Richard Nelthorpe fled, taking shelter with Dame Alice Lisle at Moyles Court, Ellingham, on the edge of the New Forest. There they were captured by Colonel Thomas Penruddocke. Hickes was tried by George Jeffreys and his colleagues on 23 September. As he faced execution, having been convicted of aiding the rebels, he told his wife that he would die because he had defended protestantism and English liberties. After efforts by his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13203/', "George Hickes")</script>, dean of Worcester, to obtain royal mercy failed, Hickes was executed at Glastonbury on 6 October 1685. A month later his brother-in-law, Daniel Moody, a master gunner in the Royal Artillery, petitioned for his sister's estate, valued at &pound;100 per annum plus &pound;2000 in goods, which had been forfeited when Hickes was convicted. The latter, Moody claimed, had employed sinister artifices to persuade his father to make a will favouring his sister.<br>
