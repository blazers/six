<span class="headword">Newman,  Robert</span>  (1858&#150;1926), <span class="occ">concert manager</span>, was born on 26 July 1858 at 121 Regent Street, London, the son of Charles Newman, a job master who had contracts to supply horses to the royal mail, and his wife, Emiline Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Love. His first employment, as a stock jobber, ended in bankruptcy after two years in 1887, when he was twenty-nine. He then studied singing in Italy, ran a concert agency in London, and, from 1888 until December 1889, studied singing at the Royal Academy of Music. He sang professionally as a bass for six years, and was chosen by Sir Hubert Parry to sing the title part in the first performance of his oratorio <span class="italic">Job</span>, at the Gloucester festival in 1893. Lacking exceptional abilities as a singer, however, Newman went into partnership with an Oxford Street concert agent named Farley Sinkins. They leased Covent Garden Theatre for a series of Promenade Concerts in autumn 1893, employing a good quality orchestra of 100 players conducted by Frederick H. Cowen. The opening of the Queen's Hall complex in Regent Street that same year brought Newman the great opportunity of his life: he became its first lessee and manager. The first official concert in the large hall took place on 2 December 1893 and included a performance of Mendelssohn's <span class="italic">Hymn of Praise</span> conducted by Cowen, with a choir hand-picked by Newman. He was confident of a large public for good-quality orchestral music at the Queen's Hall and planned a continuous series of Promenade Concerts during the summer, aiming through lower prices to attract a larger and less affluent audience while fashionable society was away and no good music was available. He approached Henry Wood, as yet hardly known on the concert platform, early in 1895 to conduct them. Financial support was provided by Dr George Cathcart, a well-known throat specialist. The first concert took place on 10 August 1895. The excellence of the programmes (which always included a new work and favoured little-known Russian and French music) and the high orchestral standards were immediately noted in the press. Thus began a partnership that lasted for thirty-two years and created an entirely new audience, repertory, and status for orchestral music in London.<br>
<br>Until 1902 Newman managed the Queen's Hall entirely alone. He added Saturday Afternoon Symphony Concerts in January 1897 and Sunday Afternoon Concerts, begun in the face of much sabbatarian opposition, later that year. He invited the leading continental conductors and orchestras, and the Queen's Hall soon became the focus for London's concert music. Notable early events included two London music festivals, in 1899 and 1902, in which the celebrated Lamoureux Orchestra under its founder and the Queen's Hall Orchestra under Wood shared the programmes. In 1902 Newman became bankrupt as a result of the failure of a venture in theatrical management. A syndicate chaired by the financier and philanthropist Edgar Speyer was created to underwrite the orchestra, and the music publisher Chappell took the lease of the Queen's Hall, retaining Newman as manager until 1906. Soon after the outbreak of the First World War Chappell also assumed proprietorship of the orchestra, which it renamed the New Queen's Hall Orchestra; Newman continued as its manager. The later support of the orchestra and Promenade Concerts by the BBC was first negotiated, unsuccessfully, by Newman shortly before his death; he was the constant factor in changing commercial conditions.<br>
<br>Newman was a man of few words and a formal manner but unfailing courtesy, single-minded and straightforward in all his dealings. He was a bulky, commanding figure with a heavy, well-groomed black moustache, very blue eyes, and a stern expression. He worked his musicians hard but sympathetically, regularly observed his concerts, and sought to make them physically attractive. In 1904 he fiercely resisted the still prevalent deputy system that undermined standards; he opposed the strong anti-German feeling in 1914 by reinstating German works&#151;especially Wagner&#151;in the programmes, for which they were famous. He died on 4 November 1926 at a nursing home at 40 Belsize Grove, Hampstead, of acute entero-colitis (from which he had suffered for three months), at the age of sixty-eight, and was interred in Hampstead cemetery, Fortune Green Road, on 8 November. He was survived by his wife, Florence Maud Newman; two children are recorded, a son and a daughter (married as Mrs E. F. Andrews). His family residence at time of death was 246 Finchley Road, London.<br>
