<span class="headword">Courcy <span class="st"> [Courci]</span>,  John  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1219?), <span class="occ">conqueror of Ulster</span>, styled by contemporaries prince of Ulster, is of uncertain parentage. He was without doubt a member of the well-known family who took their name from Courcy-sur-Dives in Calvados and who were lords of Stoke Courcy (Stogursey) in Somerset, since they were patrons of St Andrew's Benedictine priory there, and John himself founded the priory of St Andrew in Ards, Down (Black Abbey), as a dependent house of Stoke Courcy. William de Courcy (<i>d</i>. 1171), lord of Stoke Courcy in the mid-twelfth century, had a brother Jordan, and one of his charters was witnessed by both Jordan and John de Courcy, the latter possibly the conqueror of Ulster, since he too had a brother Jordan. This would make John a son of William de Courcy (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1125), who married Avice de Rumilly, daughter of William Meschin, lord of Copeland in Cumberland, and hence explain John's succession to part of William's estate at Middleton Cheney in Northamptonshire, though its small extent suggests his illegitimacy.<br>
<br>A contemporary description of Courcy is provided by Gerald of Wales, who says: &#145;John was fair-haired and tall, with bony and sinewy limbs. His frame was lanky and he had a very strong physique, immense bodily strength, and an extraordinarily bold temperament&#146;. Although brave, he was impetuous, &#145;and had about him the air of an ordinary soldier rather than that of a leader, yet away from the battlefield he was modest and restrained, and gave the church of Christ that honour which is its due&#146;  (<span class="italic">Expugnatio</span>, 179&#150;81). Nothing is known of Courcy's early life but the fact that most of those whom he established in Ulster appear to have come from Cumbria and its hinterland suggests that it was spent in this region. According to the <span class="italic">Song of Dermot and the Earl</span>, a <i>chanson de geste</i> on the English invasion of Ireland, Henry II while in Ireland in 1171&#150;2 granted Ulster to Courcy &#145;if by force he could conquer it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Song of Dermot and the Earl</span>, ed. G. H. Orpen, 1892, 199), though there is no evidence for his presence there until the latter half of 1176 when he arrived with William fitz Aldelin, the king's representative. Courcy brought a retinue of ten knights who formed part of the Dublin garrison but, according to Gerald, he grew impatient with William's lack of initiative, and gathered together 22 knights and about 300 others and, in late January 1177, marched out of Dublin to invade Ulaid (which approximates to the modern counties of Down and Antrim); Roger Howden adds that this was done contrary to William fitz Aldelin's prohibition.<br>
<br>On the morning of the fourth day, about 1 February, Courcy arrived at Down (now Downpatrick), and most accounts agree that he was initially successful, forcing Ruaidr&iacute; Mac Duinn Sl&eacute;ibe, the king of Ulaid, to flee, taking booty from the surrounding countryside, and digging himself in in Downpatrick by building a castle and &#145;a dyke from sea to sea&#146;  (<span class="roman">Mac Carthaigh's Book</span>, 65), though the usually reliable annals of Tigernach report an early victory by the Ulaid, with many of Courcy's followers being slain and he himself captured. However, he soon recovered his position and Gerald notes a second battle at Downpatrick on 24 June, probably that described in <span class="roman">Mac Carthaigh's Book</span> in which Courcy's men slaughtered the Ulaid and their allies and captured the archbishop of Armagh and precious relics.<br>
<br>At Downpatrick, Courcy encountered the papal legate for Ireland, Scotland, and the isles, Cardinal Vivian of St Stephen in Monte Celio, who, according to Gerald, sought to intervene between Courcy and Mac Duinn Sl&eacute;ibe by having the latter agree to the payment of an annual tribute, if Courcy and his men consented to leave. He failed in his mediation, however, and, according to William of Newburgh, the legate then encouraged the Irish to fight to preserve their freedom. Vivian had come to Downpatrick from the Isle of Man, where he had solemnized the marriage of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50615/', "King Godred")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50613/', "Godred Crovan")</script>] to a daughter of Mac Lochlainn, king of Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain, and Courcy himself married Godred's daughter, Affreca [<a name="cosubject_50616"></a><span class="headword">Affreca  de Courcy</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1219)<span class="occ"></span>] (in 1180 according to the unreliable Dublin annals of Inisfallen). A dower charter survives granting Affreca her portion of Courcy's estates in Ulster and Northamptonshire, but two of his charters offer prayers for Beatrice de Vilers (a lady of the same name was heir to Warrington in Lancashire), who may have been a mistress.<br>
<br>In his second year in Ulster, Courcy experienced a number of rebuffs, one at the hands of the men of Fir L&iacute; (a Gaelic lordship bordering the lower Bann), a defeat attributed by the Irish annals to the intervention of saints Patrick, Columba, and Brendan. Also, having raided in north Louth, he was pursued by its king, Murchad &Oacute; Cerbhaill, and by C&uacute; Uladh Mac Duinn Sl&eacute;ibe, and the annals record that 450 English and 100 Irish were killed. This is possibly the battle of Newry Bridge (&#145;apud pontem Ivori&#146;) which Gerald of Wales describes as following Courcy's return from England  (179), a visit not elsewhere recorded, though he was certainly in England again in 1185&#150;6.<br>
<br>In 1179 Courcy granted the monastic site at Nendrum, Down, to the monks of St Bees in Copeland so that they might establish a cell there, while the Cistercian abbey at Inch, Down, on the early church site of Inis Cumhscraidh, was made a daughter house of Furness in Lancashire. In 1183 he granted ten carucates to St Werburgh's Abbey, Chester, who sent some of their community to establish a priory in the cathedral church of Downpatrick, while a priory of Augustinian canons was set up at Toberglory near Downpatrick, as a cell of St Mary's, Carlisle, and a house of Premonstratensian canons at Carrickfergus was made subject to the abbot of Dryburgh in Berwickshire, possibly pointing towards a connection with its founders, the Morville family. The most famous religious foundation dating from this era is his wife's foundation of the Cistercian Grey Abbey (Jugum Dei), Down, in 1193, a daughter house of Holme Cultram in Cumberland (the William de Courcy who was abbot of Holme in 1216 was presumably a relative). John de Courcy also founded a priory of Crutched friars at Downpatrick, the parent house of which is unknown, and he granted lands in Down to the archbishop of Dublin, St Thomas's Abbey, and the priory of Holy Trinity, Dublin.<br>
<br>Although there is no evidence that Courcy himself was responsible for changing the town's name to Downpatrick, he did alter the dedication of Down Cathedral from the Holy Trinity to St Patrick, an act for which (according to the romanticized account of his exploits in the <span class="roman">Book of Howth</span>) God later took vengeance by denying him his Ulster lordship. The life of St Patrick by Jocelin of Furness was written at his behest and was intended in part to prove the primacy of Armagh over Dublin. When John minted his own halfpence they bore, not the king's name, but &#145;Patricius&#146;, while it is possible, as peerage writers claim, that Patrick de Courcy, lord of Kinsale in the early thirteenth century, was his illegitimate son.<br>
<br>In 1185 Courcy discovered at Downpatrick, and formally translated, what he claimed were the bodies of saints Patrick, Brigit, and Columba, an event reported by Gerald of Wales and the Scottish chronicle of Melrose. Gerald believed that Courcy's conquest of Ulster was the realization of a prophecy of Columba and claimed that &#145;John himself keeps this book of prophecies, which is written in Irish, by him as a kind of mirror of his own deeds&#146;. Gerald also, in concluding his account, stated that he was leaving &#145;the theme of his mighty exploits to be unfolded more fully by his own historians&#146;  (<span class="italic">Expugnatio</span>, 177, 181), while the <span class="roman">Book of Howth</span> mentions that a Latin biography of Courcy was in circulation in Ulster in the sixteenth century.<br>
<br>Though the archaeological evidence for the progress of John de Courcy's conquest is considerable, the documentary record is remarkably thin. The archbishop of Armagh, the bishops of Down and Connor, and the heads of the churches of Bangor and Saul, occur in Courcy charters, suggesting that he quickly gained clerical support, but it is clear too that he won the allegiance of some local secular lords. Roger Howden thought that there were Irish in his army when he launched his first assault on Downpatrick, and <span class="roman">Mac Carthaigh's Book</span> reports for 1179 that Ulaid was laid waste &#145;by John de Courcy and the Irish who were along with him&#146;  (69), and that in 1196 he plundered Louth in the company of Niall Mac Mathgamna of Airgialla. In the following year Courcy's brother Jordan was killed by an Irish adherent, and when he then set about expanding his lordship to the north-west his army contained some Irish and a contingent of Gallowaymen whose lord, Duncan of Carrick, was rewarded with a grant of Ulster lands.<br>
<br>Gerald states that when Henry II's son John visited the country as lord of Ireland in 1185 he &#145;decided to prove the worth of men who were veterans and had long experience in the conquest of that island, and entrusted the overall administration to John de Courcy&#146;, whereupon &#145;the kingdom immediately began to enjoy a greater measure of tranquility&#146;, adding that he then led expeditions to Cork and Connacht  (<span class="italic">Expugnatio</span>, 243). No evidence exists for the former, but his less than successful intervention in Connacht in 1188 in the succession war among the U&iacute; Chonchobair is noted in the annals. Charter evidence suggests that Courcy held on to the justiciarship for some time, perhaps until 1192, when Peter Pipard had the position. When the Lord John rebelled against King Richard in 1193&#150;4, Courcy remained loyal, and he and Walter de Lacy, lord of Meath, are found acting as Richard's representatives in Ireland in 1194&#150;5 in opposition to Pipard, who was taken prisoner by them. In the same year the annals record that Courcy and Lacy sought &#145;to assume power over the English of Leinster and Munster&#146; and intervened again in Connacht, in opposition to William de Burgh, where they made peace with Cathal Crobderg &Oacute; Conchobhair  (<span class="italic">Annals of Loch C&eacute;</span>, 1.191). When Cathal was ejected from Connacht in 1200 he sought refuge with Courcy in Ulster, and in the following year Courcy and Lacy's brother Hugh invaded Connacht in support of Cathal but were defeated, and sixty or more of Courcy's men slain. He himself, according to the annals of Loch C&eacute;, was &#145;struck with a stone, so that he fell from his horse &hellip; and he was taken to Dublin until he gave pledges for himself that he would obey the king of the Saxons&#146;  (ibid., 1.201&#150;3).<br>
<br>At this point Courcy and the Lacys seem to have parted company and thereafter appear as firm enemies. Roger Howden claims that Hugh de Lacy treacherously captured him in 1201 but that Courcy's men secured his release. In 1203 and again in 1204 Lacy and the English of Meath defeated Courcy in battle at Downpatrick; on the first occasion he fled, on the second he was captured and, say the annals of Loch C&eacute;, released only when he undertook to take the cross and go to Jerusalem. Government records indicate that Courcy agreed to submit to the crown and gave hostages as a pledge, but in spite of several earlier safe conducts it was only in the spring of 1205 that he went to England and had his English lands restored. However, Hugh de Lacy also went to court and was awarded the whole of Ulster on 2 May and the title of earl, which Courcy never held, on 29 May. Courcy rebelled, again forfeited his English lands, and went to the Isle of Man. There his wife's brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50617/', "King Ragnvald")</script>, supplied him with a fleet of 100 ships and they launched an invasion of Ulster but failed to capture the castle of &#145;Rath&#146; (probably Dundrum) from Walter de Lacy, whereupon Courcy took refuge in T&iacute;r Eoghain with &Aacute;ed &Oacute; N&eacute;ill. Finally, on 14 November 1207, he received a licence to go to England and, although the Dublin chronicler has a lengthy and unlikely account of his movements at this point (including, though, a more likely stay with the monks of Chester), nothing further is heard of him until the summer of 1210 when he took part in King John's overthrow of Hugh de Lacy, the latter, like his ally William (III) de Briouze, having fallen foul of the king.<br>
<br>John de Courcy was never restored to his Ulster estate and seems to have lived out his days as a royal pensioner. On 30 August 1213 the Irish justiciar was ordered to provide some land by which to sustain his wife, Affreca, and on 22 September 1219 a similar order was made to provide her with her dower, from which it may be concluded that Courcy had only recently died. According to the Manx chronicle, Affreca was buried in Grey Abbey, Down, while Courcy, who had probably died in England, had expressed a wish to be buried in the Augustinian house of Canons Ashby in Northamptonshire. No legitimate children are recorded.<br>
