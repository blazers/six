<span class="headword">Odda</span> <span class="st"> [Odo, Odda of Deerhurst, &AElig;thelwine]</span>, earl  (<em>d.</em> 1056), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, is said to have been a kinsman of Edward the Confessor. It has been suggested that he was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/182/', "&#198;lfhere of Mercia (d. 983)")</script>; a more likely ancestor is <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8918/', "&#198;thelweard (d. 998?)")</script>, chronicler, ealdorman of the western shires, and a descendant of King &AElig;thelred I of the West Saxons, since Odda was earl of the same region in 1051&#150;2 and was, moreover, a benefactor of Pershore Abbey, whose refoundation is attributed to &AElig;thelweard by William of Malmesbury. He may be the Odda <i>minister</i> who attests charters late in the reign of &AElig;thelred the Unready (the earliest is <span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 931, dated 1013) and throughout the reigns of Cnut (<i>d</i>. 1035) and Harthacnut (<i>d</i>. 1042); he is certainly the Odda who attests charters of Edward the Confessor, as <i>minister</i> or <i>nobilis</i>, between 1042 and 1050, often in conjunction with Beorhtric, son of &AElig;lfgar, lord of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire (and another possible descendant of Ealdorman &AElig;thelweard) and Ordgar, patron of Tavistock Abbey, Devon, another kinsman of the king. In the 1030s and 1040s Odda, sometimes with his brother &AElig;lfric, attests charters of Lyfing, bishop of Worcester, and &AElig;lfwold, bishop of Sherborne  (S 1393&#150;4, 1396&#150;7, 1406, 1474).<br>
<br>Odda's estates included the manor of Deerhurst, Gloucestershire, assessed at 119 hides in <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>, where stood an early minster church, of which he was patron. He also held Longdon, Worcestershire, assessed at 30 hides. Land at Mathon, Herefordshire, assessed at 5 hides, was held by two of his thegns, &AElig;lfweard of Longdon and Merewine; in 1051&#150;2 the former attested, in his lord's company, a charter of Ealdred, bishop of Worcester, as one of &#145;the leading thegns in Worcestershire&#146;  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1409). Any land of Odda's brother &AElig;lfric is now untraceable, but their sister Edith held 9 hides at Upleadon, Herefordshire. Although his full estate cannot be reconstructed, Odda was clearly one of the most extensive landholders among King Edward's thegns.<br>
<br>When Earl Godwine was banished in 1051, Odda was given the western shires, part of Godwine's former earldom. In 1052 he and Earl Ralph were appointed to command the fleet at Sandwich &#145;in order that they might keep watch for Earl Godwine&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 1052, texts C, D), but they were unable to prevent his successful return. On Godwine's reinstatement, Odda lost the western shires, but received another earldom in compensation. Presumably this was Worcestershire, for he attests charters of Ealdred, bishop of Worcester, as earl (<i>dux</i>) in the early 1050s  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1407&#150;9). John of Worcester (who gives Odda's alternative name of &AElig;thelwine) describes him in fulsome terms as &#145;the lover of churches, succourer of the poor, defender of widows and orphans, helper of the oppressed, guardian of virgins&#146;  (John of Worcester, <span class="italic">Chron</span>., 2.580&#150;81), an elaboration of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle's</span> eulogy: &#145;he was a good man and pure and very noble&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 1056, text D). Odda was remembered as the restorer of Pershore Abbey, which had experienced hard times since its refoundation in the reign of King Edgar. Its lands had been seized (allegedly) by &AElig;lfhere of Mercia and in 1002 all its records were lost in a disastrous fire; the only surviving early charter is a grant of &AElig;thelred II, giving Mathon to Leofwine, earl of Worcestershire, in 1014  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 932); presumably Odda restored it to Pershore. The abbey was functioning by the 1020s, for Brihtheah, bishop of Worcester (1033&#150;8), had previously been abbot of Pershore.<br>
<br>Odda's brother &AElig;lfric died at Deerhurst on 22 December 1053, and in his memory Odda built the church now known as &#145;Odda's Chapel&#146;, consecrated in honour of the Holy Trinity by Ealdred, bishop of Worcester, on 12 April 1056. On 31 August 1056 Odda died and was buried, with his brother, at Pershore, having earlier received the monastic habit from Ealdred. He left no heirs and his lands passed to his kinsman the king, who gave Odda's secular estate at Deerhurst to the abbey of St Denis in Paris, leaving the minster church of St Mary with only 50 of the original 119 hides. Pershore suffered even worse spoliation, for two-thirds of its 300 hides were abstracted and bestowed upon the king's own foundation at Westminster.<br>
