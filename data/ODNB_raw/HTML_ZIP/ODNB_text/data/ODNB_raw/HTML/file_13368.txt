<span class="headword">Hitcham, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1573, <em>d.</em> 1636), <span class="occ">barrister and politician</span>, was born at Levington, Suffolk, the only son of Robert Hitcham, yeoman, of Nacton, Suffolk, and his wife, Joan Gillet; he was baptized at Nacton on 8 March 1573. After attending Ipswich's free grammar school he went on to Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1587, and entered Gray's Inn, as from Barnard's Inn, in November 1589. Hitcham was called utter-barrister in 1595 at the reading of Richard Barker, a Cecil prot&eacute;g&eacute;. The same connection probably underlies his return for West Looe in the parliament of 1597 and his appointment by September 1603 as Queen Anne's attorney-general. In June 1604 Hitcham was knighted and again returned to parliament, this time for the borough of King's Lynn. His colourful report to the Commons in March 1606 following a rumoured attempt on the king's life was almost immediately contradicted by other testimony, whereby &#145;Sir R [H]Itchams credit in the opinion of divers was much impaired&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Robert Bowyer</span>, 89). Neither this reverse nor his relatively infrequent subsequent contributions to debate curtailed Hitcham's parliamentary career. In 1614 he represented the borough of Cambridge, where he had been retained as fee'd counsellor since at least 1609&#150;10, as he was also at Ipswich, while in the three parliaments from 1624 to 1626 he succeeded Sir Edward Coke as member for Orford, where he had earlier replaced Coke as recorder. His 1624 speech defending the legality of impositions aroused so much resentment that Sir Thomas Wentworth moved successfully for it to be struck from the clerk's record.<br>
<br>Called ancient and permitted to sit at the Gray's Inn readers' table from January 1604 in respect of his royal office, Hitcham was chosen reader towards the end of the following year. The 1606 Lent readings at all four inns incurred the judges' displeasure, but Hitcham's bad example was particularly censured. His temporary suspension from commons for providing over-lavish entertainment and an abbreviated reading may have been a symbolic punishment, but cannot have enhanced his professional reputation. This perhaps explains why he was sarcastically termed &#145;a great learned man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 1.541) on the news of his call as serjeant in 1614. Having given up his attorney-generalship, Hitcham's legal practice thereafter appears to have been confined largely to the court of common pleas and local East Anglian jurisdictions. Although promoted king's serjeant in 1616, he never rose above the rank of chief serjeant, except as a commissioned assize judge. His stalled career may have reflected a lack of effective patronage after Buckingham's rise to power; a &#145;writhen face and sneering look&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 6395, fol. 53) possibly also told against him, though his contemporary likeness displays no such traits.<br>
<br>Yet if there were doubts about Hitcham's legal learning and professional morality, his overall ability was unquestionable. Indeed he was possibly no more anxious for promotion to the judicial bench than to end his jealously guarded bachelorhood. In material terms his career was outstandingly successful: &#145;not born to &pound;200 &hellip; not to &pound;20 or &pound;2&#146; a year  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1558&#150;1603</span>, 2.319), his land purchases culminated with a payment of &pound;14,000 for the earl of Suffolk's castle and manor of Framlingham. He died at Ipswich on 15 August 1636 and was buried at Framlingham.<br>
<br>Hitcham's will made passing allusion to the &#145;glorious and incomprehensible Trinity&#146; but only a cursory statement of personal faith  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/173, fol. 249<i>r</i>). Most of his fortune went to his old Cambridge college, on condition that it should erect and maintain almshouses and a school for the poor at Framlingham. The wording of this bequest occasioned disputes and litigation which continued into Charles II's reign.<br>
