<span class="headword">Farley,  James Lewis</span>  (1823&#150;1885), <span class="occ">banker and writer on the Middle East</span>, only son of Thomas Farley of Meiltran, co. Cavan, was born at Dublin on 9 September 1823. He was destined for the legal profession, and studied at Trinity College, Dublin. His attention, however, was early directed to Turkey and the East. After the conclusion of the Crimean War and the signing of the treaty of Paris in 1856, the Ottoman Bank was formed by British financiers including members of the Glyn and Mills families, and was initially a wholly British bank, with a royal charter. Farley accepted the post of chief accountant of the branch at Beirut, which he helped establish. In 1858 he published an account of his experiences entitled <span class="italic">Two Years in Syria</span>, and in 1861 published <span class="italic">The Massacres in Syria</span>, in which he warmly defended the cause of the Christians. In 1860 Farley was appointed accountant-general of the state bank of Turkey at Constantinople, which subsequently became merged in the Imperial Ottoman Bank, which was set up in 1863 with British, French, and Ottoman shareholders and directors, under the protection of the sultan and his government. It was the government bank with sole rights of note issue. British and French government involvement was also considerable, and the bank was a political as much as a financial institution.<br>
<br>From this time onward, and from his advantageous position within the bank, Farley was a keen student of Turkish affairs, and gained a wide knowledge of its people and rulers, as well as of its trade and financial condition. He wrote in 1861 an account entitled <span class="italic">The Druses and the Maronites</span>. The following year, in <span class="italic">The Resources of Turkey</span>, he dealt especially with the question of the profitable investment of capital in the Ottoman empire, claiming that the extension of British trade throughout the Turkish empire was mainly due to the energy and perseverance of the Greeks. <span class="italic">Banking in Turkey</span> appeared in 1863, to be followed by other books on the country in 1866 and 1872, and in 1875 by the brochure <span class="italic">The Decline of Turkey Financially and Politically</span>, in which he warned Turkish bondholders of their impending dangers.<br>
<br>Farley had been on intimate personal terms with Fuad and Ali pashas, but after their fall he severely condemned the misrule and oppression of their successors. In the autumn of 1875 he took a prominent part in public agitations in England in support of Christians living in difficult conditions in Turkey. In October 1875 he proposed to the Russian government a lecture and press campaign among protestant clergy to give a more religious emphasis to the campaign. The Russian ambassador in London suggested to St Petersburg the possibility of a monthly subvention to Farley's campaign, and spent &pound;50 on copies of Farley's <span class="italic">Decline of Turkey</span>.<br>
<br>Prompted by the Bulgarian massacres of 1876, Farley published <span class="italic">Turks and Christians: a Solution of the Eastern Question</span>, in which he suggested reforms which would combine administrative autonomy for the Christian populations with the maintenance of the authority of the sultan. Some of his suggestions were pressed upon the Porte by the great powers, and ultimately adopted. In 1878 Farley published a descriptive and historical work entitled <span class="italic">Egypt, Cyprus, and Asiatic Turkey</span>.<br>
<br>On the formation of the new principality of Bulgaria in 1880, Farley went to Sofia to be present at the reception of the newly elected ruler, Prince Alexander I. He presented a letter of introduction from the Russian foreign minister which recommended him for his past services to the Bulgarian cause and obtained for him a year's grant to supply the English press with news from Bulgaria. As a result he was later accused of manipulating the English press against Russian policy to ingratiate himself with Bulgarian liberals. On his return to England he published a monograph on the principality and its governor, under the title <span class="italic">New Bulgaria</span>.<br>
<br>Farley was in Egypt during the sultan's visit in 1863, and at Constantinople on the occasion of the royal and imperial visits to the Turkish capital in 1869. Between 1870 and 1884 he was consul for Turkey in Bristol, and made considerable, although not particularly successful, efforts to develop trade between Bristol and the Levant. Farley was a fellow of the Statistical Society of London, a corresponding member of the Institut &Eacute;gyptien (founded by Napoleon I at Alexandria), and a privy councillor in the public works department of Bulgaria. Because of his great knowledge of Bulgarian affairs his advice was frequently sought when the Bulgarian question agitated Europe in the 1860s and 1870s. Farley died at Bayswater, London, on 12 November 1885.<br>
