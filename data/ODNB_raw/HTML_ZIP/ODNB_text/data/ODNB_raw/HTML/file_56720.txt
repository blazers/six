<span class="headword">Myersbach,  Theodor</span>  (<em>c.</em>1730&#150;1798), <span class="occ">uroscopist</span>, was probably born in Bavaria. Virtually all the particulars of his life were discovered initially by Dr John Coakley Lettsom, who pertinaciously investigated Myersbach's background and exposed his dubious practices. As Lettsom was a Quaker of the highest personal and professional integrity, who used as evidence Myersbach's letters and prescriptions that he had openly acquired, his account can be taken as essentially reliable.<br>
<br>Myersbach is said to have begun his working life in Germany as a postboy, delivering letters; he then rose to a clerkship in a Post Office. He married a sister of Joseph Brenner of Schweinfurt, near W&uuml;rzburg, possibly in 1755; they were to have two sons, Alexander and Polycarp. However, owing to &#145;misdemeanours&#146;&#151;not specified by Lettsom&#151;Myersbach had to leave Germany. After residing for a while in Amsterdam he moved to England, about 1772, but was very poor as he was unable to find work.<br>
<br>Myersbach first tried for a post with a starch manufacturer in Essex. Then, while lodging over a chandler's shop in Soho, London, he and his son Alexander developed &#145;the itch&#146;. Not knowing how to treat this affliction he consulted a Dr Griffenberg, who lived nearby. Griffenberg directed him towards a job in a local riding school, but Myersbach failed as his figure was not imposing enough. Once cured of his affliction, however, he moved in with the doctor and soon acquired some expertise and much jargon. Griffenberg died not long afterwards, and in gratitude Myersbach undertook to pay a pension of 6<i>s</i>. a week to his widow.<br>
<br>In December 1773 Myersbach produced an advertisement which proclaimed, with some stretching of the truth, that &#145;Dr von Mayersbach&#146; was newly arrived from Prague; he set himself up in Berwick Street, Soho. The practice of diagnosing ills from the scrutiny of a sufferer's urine went back fifteen centuries, the title of &#145;piss prophet&#146; perhaps reflecting some lay contempt for this vocation. However, as Myersbach had such a slender grasp of medicine he chose this profession cannily, as no bodily examination was needed. He disguised his insignificant figure with very expensive apparel; that, and his elegant coach and horses, put people in awe of him. So did his pronouncements in very broken English. He would wave his hands some inches above the recumbent victim to discover the seat of the problem, and over some spot exclaim, &#145;It is here, it is here&#146;, moving on if the patient disagreed. Sometimes he knew precisely, because his employees had initiated or overheard conversations in the waiting room.<br>
<br>Lettsom asserted that Myersbach often made two hundred consultations daily, which would have meant treating one patient every three or four minutes during a twelve-hour day. More realistically he was supposed to earn 1000 guineas a month, equivalent to the income of a small German principality. He charged half a guinea per consultation and also received one-third of the income from the medicines he prescribed, each of which cost 7<i>s</i>.&#150;10<i>s</i>. Lettsom bought and analysed some hundreds of Myersbach's prescriptions: a red powder contained saltpetre; green drops were a tincture of tansy; sweet drops consisted mostly of sugar; and black pills were made from a hallucinogenic mixture of brandy and opium.<br>
<br>Early in 1776 Myersbach moved from Soho to Hatton Garden in the City of London. That April, David Garrick, the actor, consulted him for the gout and the stone that had plagued him for many years, and found relief. Among other patients were Charles Lennox, the third duke of Richmond, and his wife, the first Baron Hawke, the second Baron Archer, and a Lady Harrington. However, at the beginning of 1777 Myersbach left Britain; perhaps the Royal College of Physicians had been asking awkward questions over his improperly describing himself as a doctor. At about this time Myersbach purchased a doctorate of medicine from the University of Erfurt in Thuringia, and within twelve months he was back in London, building up as extensive a following as before.<br>
<br>Lettsom for his part had learnt that unfortunately his relentless pillorying of Myersbach had entirely failed to break him. He in his turn had to face not only anonymous counter-attacks in the press and through pamphlets, but also some hostility from eminent colleagues, aware that Myersbach did cure cases that had baffled orthodox medicine. Myersbach continued his practice until he died in London early in February 1798, after only a few hours' illness; he was described as a &#145;water-doctor&#146;. Although clearly a wealthy man, no will under his name was sworn at the prerogative court of Canterbury. However, on 19 February of that year, the will of Alexander von Myersbach (no occupation being given), of Savile Row, London, was proved there. This rare substantive information gave the wife's name as Sarah. She may possibly have been Myersbach's second wife, as the two older sons were mentioned separately from two daughters Penelope and Caroline and a son Henry Ferdinand, then minors. Regrettably, Lettsom's sleuthing instincts were never brought to bear on the riddle of this final identification.<br>
