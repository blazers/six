<span class="headword">Pound,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1807, <em>d.</em> 1881), <span class="occ">headmaster and religious writer</span>, was the son of Matthew Pound, gentleman. A William Pound, son of Matthew Pound and his wife, Sarah, was baptized at Great Stanmore, Middlesex, on 18 March 1807. After attending Grantham School, Pound entered St John's College, Cambridge, in 1829, holding the Newcome exhibition (1829&#150;36) and the Baker exhibition (1832&#150;4), and being admitted Robinson scholar in 1832. He graduated BA as sixth wrangler in 1833, ill health contributing to his failure to achieve the anticipated highest mathematical honours. He was Naden divinity student from 1833 to 1836, when he proceeded MA. Pound was fellow (and sometime librarian) of the college from then until 1839, vacating before his marriage in January 1840 to Charlotte Augusta, fourth daughter of Richard Furley, a wharfinger from Gainsborough. The couple had two sons, Robert William (<i>b</i>. 1843) and Alfred John (<i>b</i>. 1847), and one daughter, Amelia Dorothena (<i>b</i>. 1845). Pound was ordained deacon in 1835, becoming a priest in 1836. In 1839 Archbishop Musgrave appointed him headmaster of Old Malton grammar school, Yorkshire, then in a decayed condition and suffering from local competition. Pound moved the school to Norton, let the old schoolroom, and effectively conducted a private school, although he admitted without payment Malton boys wishing to study classics only. This policy generated local opposition. While at Malton, Pound served as official to the archdeacon of the East Riding, Robert Isaac Wilberforce.<br>
<br>In the 1850s Pound was a prominent campaigner for the revival of diocesan synods. He helped organize the well-attended synodal consultative meetings held at Derby, London, Gloucester, and Warrington in 1851&#150;2, and wrote much of the literature circulated by the provisional committee, of which he was secretary. Pound also edited and largely wrote the <span class="italic">Synodicon</span> (1854&#150;6), in which contemporary issues were considered with reference to synodical action. A high-churchman but not a ritualist, Pound saw the diocesan synod&#151;&#145;A whole diocese standing before its king&#146;&#151;as the heart of an ideal Anglo-Saxon church polity, which had subsequently been debilitated by a combination of papal usurpation and state interference (of which convocation was a manifestation):<blockquote>By synodical action within the diocese, in mixed assemblies of clergy and laity, the old Saxon independent action of the Church will be attained, and supply to the state a bulwark of truth to fall back on, when the combined tide of expediency and centralisation shall have recoiled upon the state with irrepressible violence. (Pound, <span class="italic">Papal Aggression &hellip; Repelled by the Revival of Diocesan Synods</span>, 1852, 8)</blockquote>It was only among his clergy that a bishop exercised his proper authority. Pound developed a scheme for diocesan synods elaborately organized to energize the existing diocesan structure, and with lay participation. He believed such synods would counteract the growth of church party, restore church discipline, and support education. In other writings on this last subject Pound upheld the moral and religious content of education, which he considered to be under threat from government proposals in the late 1860s. Diocesan synods figured here as a means of ensuring the moral content in education and preventing damaging centralization.<br>
<br>In 1866 Pound transferred his teaching activities to Appuldurcombe House on the Isle of Wight, so saving the ancestral home of the Worsleys from demolition. He remained principal of the school until in 1876 he handed over to his elder son, hoping to devote his remaining years to scriptural researches. A &#145;complication of maladies&#146; frustrated these plans, but Pound had already produced his most ambitious publication, <span class="italic">The Gospels in Unity</span> (1870). This sought to demonstrate the infallibility and inspiration of the evangelists' narratives through an elaborate explanation of apparent inconsistencies in chronology as the result of similar incidents occurring at different times in Christ's life. The <span class="italic">Literary Churchman</span> dismissed it as &#145;a last desperate effort to construct a perfect harmony of the Gospels&#146;. Pound was an active campaigner for the Conservatives on the island, organizing a Conservative association at Ventnor. In 1871 he assumed the duties of lecturer at St Catherine's, Ventnor, in which post he remained until his death at Appuldurcombe on 23 October 1881. He was buried at Godshill.<br>
