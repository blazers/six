<span class="headword">Bourne,  Kenneth</span>  (1930&#150;1992), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born at Carshalton, Wick Lane, Wickford, Essex, on 17 March 1930, the son of Clarence Arthur Bourne, a director of a printing and publishing firm, and his wife, Doris English. He attended Southend high school before becoming in 1951 a student at the University College of the South-West (later the University of Exeter). He followed his mentor, Professor William Norton Medlicott, to the London School of Economics (LSE) on the latter's appointment as Stevenson professor of international history in 1953, and obtained his PhD degree from London in 1956. He married on 1 January 1955 Eleanor Anne Wells, a press officer, daughter of Edward Ronald Wells, master grocer. They had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>Bourne's career was steady rather than dramatic. He was a research fellow at the Institute of Historical Research, London (1955&#150;6), and briefly held a research appointment at the new University of Reading (1956) before returning to the LSE in 1957, initially as an assistant lecturer, working his way upwards until the conferment of a personal professorship at the LSE in 1976, and a fellowship of the British Academy in 1982, marked the crown of his career. He had by then renounced any interest in the Stevenson professorship in favour of a colleague and friend. He retired early in 1992 and later that year died suddenly in his sleep from a heart attack, at Lewisham Hospital, Lewisham, London, on 13 December 1992.<br>
<br>Bourne was the last of a series of major historians of British foreign policy in the nineteenth century, a series which included such men as Harold Temperley, Sir Charles Webster, and R. W. Seton-Watson. He differed from his illustrious predecessors, however, in being without any connections with Oxford or Cambridge, and very much the product of the 1944 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>. His master and formative influence was W. N. Medlicott, himself a product of London University. Bourne's place among his predecessors rests on three pillars. Where they had concentrated entirely on British relations with the European great powers, he was the first to bring Britain's relations with the United States into the general picture of Victorian foreign policy. His first book, <span class="italic">Britain and the Balance of Power in North America, 1815&#150;1908</span> (1967), made him an immediate reputation both in Britain and in the United States. But the merits and new approaches he showed in that book were to figure in his second book, the second pillar to his reputation. He had moved from the traditional diplomatic history practised by his predecessors (drawn mainly from the archives of the Foreign Office and the private papers, such as they were, of major political and diplomatic personalities), to seeing foreign policy and the conduct of relations between one state and its fellows as a composition of the whole structure of government, to be documented from the archives of the palace on the one hand, and the military, naval, financial, secret intelligence, and other such organs of government on the other. Strategic factors figured throughout his narratives, not only when major wars seemed to threaten. He was one of the first to interest himself in the issues of military intelligence and foreign policy. Like his colleagues in the twentieth-century field, he found discontinuities resulting from the failure to resolve the separate approaches of different organs of government, apparent on both sides of the Atlantic as well as among the European great powers, to be no problem. Bourne's second book, <span class="italic">The Foreign Policy of Victorian England</span> (1970), by comparison, for example, with A. J. P. Taylor's <span class="italic">Struggle for Mastery in Europe, 1815&#150;1914</span>, clearly reveals that for Bourne &#145;foreign policy&#146; was made as much in cabinet, Colonial Office, War Office, and Admiralty as by heroic (or muddled) figures in charge of foreign offices. Bourne's work was to be prescribed reading for generations of schoolboys preparing for university entry.<br>
<br>The third pillar on which Bourne's reputation rests is his (alas, unfinished) biography of Lord Palmerston, the first (and only) volume of which, <span class="italic">Palmerston: the Early Years, 1784&#150;1841</span>, appeared in 1982. It was immediately recognized as the major work it undoubtedly was. Bourne's election to the British Academy followed hot on the heels of its publication. It would not have been possible without the Mountbatten family's decision to grant him access to the Palmerston papers, which they had hitherto denied to historians. But Bourne had also uncovered a series of treasure troves of private papers of Palmerston's many correspondents, containing significant papers not preserved in the Palmerston papers themselves. He had also mastered, and indeed come to own, copies of much of the considerable volume of memoirs, letters, diaries, and so on published by Palmerston's political contemporaries. An indefatigable haunter of antiquarian bookshops throughout the southern counties of Britain, he spent his weekends combing Britain's towns and villages at a time when many of the minor libraries of nineteenth-century dignitaries were being sold by their impecunious and space-starved descendants.<br>
<br>One cannot help thinking that, had Bourne ever met Palmerston face to face, he would have disapproved of him. But his historical view of Palmerston did nothing to denigrate or debunk one of the great heroic figures of early Victorian Britain. Bourne painted Palmerston as an overbearing and often unscrupulous giant, a man who hid his basic integrity and accuracy of judgement behind the manners and feuds of his time. There can be no doubt that, for all the faults which Bourne recognized in his hero, he admired and exalted him.<br>
<br>Bourne's work was such as to awake the admiration of professional historians, especially those who were not absorbed, as were so many of his contemporaries, in the new socio-economic history. But it did not catch the imagination of the general book-reading public, still less the media, who looked for the debunking of the great men of Victorian Britain rather than the confirmation of their existing reputations. He was to spend the latter years of his life in publishing source materials for his period. As well as editing the papers of Francis Horner and the second earl of Minto, he master-minded the massive publication by the University Press of America of 415 volumes of documents selected from the Foreign Office confidential print for the years 1860&#150;1939, as editor-in-chief responsible for the documents deriving from the years before 1914. His biggest disappointment was the inability of information technologists to evolve a workable technique for screening the annual <span class="italic">Foreign Office Lists</span> in such a way as to make the mechanical compilation of a biographical dictionary of members of the Foreign Office and the diplomatic service from the foundation of the Foreign Office possible. He was to play his part in the celebration at the LSE of the two-hundredth anniversary of the Foreign Office.<br>
<br>When Bourne began his graduate research, British records were accessible only in part for even the end of the nineteenth century. The fifty-year rule was adopted in 1958; by 1967 the closed period had been reduced to thirty years. With the opening not merely of the Foreign Office records but those of cabinet, service ministries, Colonial Office, India Office, Treasury, in fact of all Whitehall, there came a flood of private papers from the twentieth century. Bourne's own contemporaries were the last of British graduate students for whom the death of Queen Victoria was the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of archival research. By the time his Palmerston biography appeared, the vast majority of graduate students interested in international history as a field of research were plunged into study of the origins of the Second World War, if not those of the cold war. Only the smallest handful were interested in the fields in which Bourne was the unchallenged master. Thus he left no school of disciples behind him. The disappearance of the deference which he as a young historian had paid his elders, and the intensification of external pressures on all in British universities to justify their practices and record, certainly left their mark on him in his latter years. Indeed he was to spend valuable time and effort on university committees and the like defending the values and culture of independent scholarship against external enemies and internal critics and mischief makers. The possibility that it was the stress which this struggle induced in him which led to his early death cannot be ruled out. To those he respected among his contemporaries (and his judgement like that of Medlicott rested solely on estimates of their professionalism as scholars and historians), he was the best and most loyal of friends and an amusing, witty, if sometimes cynical companion. He was a welcome and frequent visitor at a whole range of American universities and was elected to the American Philosophical Society.<br>
