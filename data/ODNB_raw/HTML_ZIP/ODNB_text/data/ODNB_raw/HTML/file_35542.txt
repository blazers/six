<span class="headword">Plender,  William</span>, Baron Plender  (1861&#150;1946), <span class="occ">accountant</span>, was born at Low Felling, Gateshead, co. Durham, on 20 August 1861, the eldest of the nine children of William Plender, a grocer and draper, and his wife, Elizabeth Agnes Smallpiece, the daughter of John Edward Smallpiece Varday. Educated at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle upon Tyne, he was denied what he later described the &#145;supreme advantage&#146; of an Oxbridge education, and joined a Newcastle firm of accountants, John G. Benson &amp; Sons. On qualification as a chartered accountant, in 1884, he joined the London office of Deloitte, Dever, Griffiths &amp; Co. at &pound;100 per annum, the then rate of remuneration for newly qualified accountants. He complained, later, &#145;how hard it was to climb the ladder that led to a Partnership&#146;  (Kettle, 83), but he reached the top in 1897, and seven years later became senior partner of the firm, which was renamed Deloitte, Plender, Griffiths &amp; Co., under which label it conducted business until 1971.<br>
<br>Deloittes had opened its first overseas branch in New York in 1890, but under Plender's leadership expanded rapidly, with ten branches scattered through North America and southern Africa by 1911, and thirty-four by 1931. The number of staff, though minuscule by late twentieth-century standards, grew from thirty in 1882, to four partners and a staff of 189 by 1914, and a total staff of 351 by 1939. Plender's talents were exploited by the accounting profession, large public companies, and the government. He became a member of the council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in 1903, and was the first president to have qualified by examination when appointed to that position, for the first time, at the age of forty-nine in 1910. He remained on council for forty-three years, and served twice more as president, in 1911&#150;12 and in the institute's jubilee year, 1929&#150;30. In 1903 he acted for the Metropolitan Water Board, which acquired the London water companies, and in 1908 for the purchasers in the establishment of the Port of London Authority. In 1911 he officially investigated conditions of medical work and remuneration under the <span class="roman">National Insurance Act</span>, and the same year received a knighthood. He served on the royal commission on railways in 1913.<br>
<br>The war period 1914&#150;18 immensely increased the volume of Plender's public commitments, and he found himself at the centre of a political controversy following his appointment as controller of the large London branches of the German, Austrian, and Turkish banks. Their affairs were complicated, and the liquidation was necessarily slow. A degree of criticism of Plender's administration was led by Lord Northcliffe through the medium of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, which he controlled. A government inquiry fully vindicated Plender, but Northcliffe's response was to carry out his earlier threat to sack Plender's firm as auditors of Associated Newspapers Ltd. Evidence of government satisfaction with Plender's work is reflected in the fact that he continued to be showered with commissions which resulted in a list of public appointments truly amazing in terms of its length and variety.<br>
<br>In speeches, presidential addresses, and papers Plender made a significant contribution to the theory of accounting practice. In particular, in a paper delivered in 1926 to the International Congress of Accountants at Amsterdam, he reflected on the nature of the auditor's responsibility. The reputation of a professional accountant depended, he argued, not just on the adherence to legal principles, but on his &#145;much wider moral duty and responsibility&#146;  (<span class="italic">DBB</span>). The issue came to the fore in 1931 when Owen Cosby Philipps, Lord Kylsant, chairman of the Royal Mail Shipping group, was charged with publishing balance sheets which were false and fraudulent. In the aftermath of the trial, in a number of speeches, Plender urged the profession to adopt a moral, rather than a purely technical, approach to accounting practices.<br>
<br>Plender was appointed GBE in 1918, and awarded a baronetcy in 1923, and a barony in 1931. He was high sheriff of Kent (1928&#150;9) and of the county of London (1927&#150;8), and he also served as lieutenant and deputy lieutenant of the City of London. He received an honorary degree of LLD from Birmingham University in 1927. He was a knight of justice of the order of St John of Jerusalem, a governor of St Thomas's Hospital and of the King's School, Canterbury, and chairman of the board of governors of the City of London College (1935&#150;41).<br>
<br>Plender had a very wide and diverse circle of friends, and was noted for his calm demeanour, his great courtesy, and his far-reaching sympathies. His ability to stay calm under pressure proved invaluable during the war. According to an obituary,<blockquote>Never flustered or irritated at a time when the nerves of so many good workers were on edge, Plender was one of the figures that made all with whom he came into contact feel that victory was assured to a country that had such imperturbable advisers. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 21 Jan 1946)</blockquote>His relaxations were shooting and golf, but perhaps his most absorbing outside interest was the collection of pictures and antique furniture which, it has been said, he displayed with great taste in his town and country houses. He was an active freemason, being a member of a number of masonic lodges, and one of the founder members and first master of the chartered accountants' lodge in 1906.Plender married, first, on 8 October 1891, Marion Elizabeth, the daughter of John Channon of Woodford Green, Essex, at a Wesleyan ceremony in West Ham. She died at Cannes on 31 December 1930, and he married Mabel Agnes, the widow of George Norton Stevens, a publisher, and the daughter of Peter George Laurie, a stockbroker, on 27 April 1932 at St Margaret's, Westminster. In 1940 he was persuaded to leave London for the relative safety of Torquay for the duration of the Second World War. It was not a happy time. Both his London and country homes were rendered uninhabitable by bomb damage, and much of his collection of seventeenth-century furniture and <i>objets d'art</i> was badly damaged. His health was poor, and he died in the Lonsdale Nursing Home in Tunbridge Wells on 19 January 1946 at the age of eighty-four. There were no children from either of his two marriages and, on his death, his titles became extinct.<br>
