<span class="headword">Wainewright,  Thomas Griffiths</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseuds. </em>Janus Weathercock, Cornelius van Vinkbooms]</span>  (1794&#150;1847), <span class="occ">painter, writer on art, and putative poisoner</span>, was born probably on 4 October 1794, the son of Thomas Wainewright (<i>d</i>. in or before 1803) of Sloane Street, in the parish of St Luke, Chelsea, London, and his wife, Ann (1773&#150;1794), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11621/', "Ralph Griffiths (1720?&#150;1803)")</script>, founder and editor of the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, and his second wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clark. His parents had married by special licence at St Nicholas's, Chiswick, on 13 December 1792. Thomas Wainewright senior was the second son of the twelve children of Robert Wainewright, a solicitor of Gray's Inn who lived in Hatton Garden. Though their father was a Unitarian, several of the elder Thomas Wainewright's brothers became Church of England clergymen, while others followed him into the legal profession. After their marriage Thomas and Ann Wainewright lived with her father at his home, Linden House, Turnham Green, Chiswick, where Wainewright probably was born. His mother died at his birth and his father died while he was still a child, before June 1803, when his grandfather Ralph Griffiths made his will. Ralph Griffiths, to whom Wainewright owed his second name and by whom he was brought up after being orphaned, left his grandson annuities of about &pound;200 (the interest on a sum settled on his mother on her marriage and a further sum paid to his trustees on the death of his father) but no further capital or property, the bulk of which he left to his widow and the son from his first marriage, George Edward Griffiths, to whom he also left the proprietorship of the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> and the responsibility of taking care of Wainewright, his half-sister's child.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeartistandwriter"></a>Early life: artist and writer</h2>Wainewright was educated at Charles Burney's school in Greenwich. His talent for drawing the likenesses of his friends and masters led to his apprenticeship at the age of nineteen to his kinsman the fashionable portrait painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22174/', "Thomas Phillips")</script>. He made a copy (City of Nottingham Museums, Newstead Abbey collections) of his master's celebrated portrait of Lord Byron (1813; priv. coll.). Boredom and &#145;giddiness&#146;, however, led him &#145;to postpone the pencil to the sword&#146;  (Hazlitt, 305). A brief spell (from April 1814 to May 1815) as an ensign in the Bedfordshire regiment of foot (more notable in the early nineteenth century for the glamour of its uniform than for any form of active service) induced in Wainewright a deep depression. From this manifestation of the instability that was to underlie his future behaviour he was gradually restored to health by the care of &#145;a most delicately affectionate and unwearied (though young and fragile) nurse&#146; and the healing power of Wordsworth's poetry  (ibid., 306). On 13 November 1817 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Trafalgar Square, he married his &#145;fragile nurse&#146;, Eliza Frances Ward, daughter of the first marriage of Mrs Abercromby, a widow who lived at Mortlake.<br>
<br>Following his recovery Wainewright began to contribute to the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> under the pseudonyms Janus Weathercock and Cornelius van Vinkbooms. Under the editorship of John Scott, between 1821 and 1823 he regularly contributed &#145;Sentimentalities on the Fine Arts&#146; and &#145;Dogmas for dilettantes&#146;, written in a fluent but facetious style. W. C. Hazlitt's attribution to Wainewright&#151;in his introduction to <span class="italic">Essays and Criticisms of Thomas Griffiths Wainewright</span> (1880)&#151;of articles published under the pseudonym Egomet Bonmot has recently been challenged by Marc Vaulbert de Chantilly. In his last contribution to the magazine, &#145;Janus Weatherbound, or, The Weathercock Steadfast for Lack of Oil&#146;, Wainewright &#145;admitted the tawdry articles signed J. W. and C. V. V.&#146;  (Hazlitt, 304). Wainewright's connection with the magazine brought him into contact with Thomas Hood, Allan Cunningham, William Hazlitt, Thomas de Quincey, and Charles Lamb, who wrote of him as &#145;their best stay, kind, light-hearted Wainewright&#146;  (ibid., xxx). W. C. Hazlitt acknowledged that &#145;the literary criticisms of Wainewright are unquestionably the offspring of an acute and cultivated mind&#146;  (ibid., xxiv). Though many of his contemporaries wrote under a pseudonym in journals and magazines, Wainewright's literary guises, stylistically in keeping with T. N. Talfourd's description of him as &#145;a young man on the bright side of thirty, with an undress military air and the conversation of a smart, clever, lively, heartless, voluptuous coxcomb&#146;  (ibid., xxiii), may provide an indication of a deeper fragmentation of his personality. Within his reviews the two-faced Janus sometimes speaks directly to the more seriously minded van Vinkbooms, and vice versa, thereby creating a further level of literary &#145;deception&#146;. Though they remained fairly thin disguises, these literary personae provided Wainewright with opportunities to explore a variety of identities.<br>
<br>Known to have assisted in the compilation of exhibition catalogues at Somerset House, and to have contemplated the publication of &#145;An Art Novel&#146; and two works on the various schools of painting, from 1821 to 1825 Wainewright was also an exhibitor at the Royal Academy. The titles of his exhibited works record their risqu&eacute; subject matter; they include &#145;Subject from the Romance of Undine, chap. VI&#146;; &#145;Paris in the Chamber of Helen: &#147;There Jove-loved Hector Entered&#148;&#146;; &#145;An Attempt from the Undine of de la Motte Fougu&eacute; [<i>sic</i>]: &#147;By degrees, outward terrors joined to inward misgivings, to punish Bertalda's passion for the husband of her friend&#148;&#146;; and &#145;The Milk-Maid's Song: &#147;Come live with me and be my love&#148;&#146;  (Graves, <span class="italic">RA Exhibitors</span>, 8.99). Talfourd commented that Wainewright's drawings of women were &#145;voluptuous, trembling on the borders of the indelicate&#146;  (Curling, 89). The British Museum holds a sepia drawing of his that confirms that his treatment of this subject, though not devoid of skill, was coarse. His interest in erotic images he explored with fellow artists Henry Fuseli and Theodore von Holst; the latter sold many of his &#145;private&#146; drawings to the prince of Wales (later George IV).<h2>
<a name="Connectionsforgerandputativepoisoner"></a>Connections: forger and putative poisoner</h2>Of his circle of literary and artistic friends and patrons Wainewright stated that &#145;his pen and brush introduced him to the notice and friendship of men whose fame is European&#146;  (Blair, 263). Among these were Fuseli (&#145;the god of his idolatry&#146;), Stothard, Westall, Sir Thomas Lawrence, and Flaxman  (Hazlitt, xix). His occasional work as a reviewer and artist, together with some art dealing, slightly increased his income; this derived mainly from the annuity from his grandfather but was not sufficient to sustain the lifestyle that he enjoyed from 1821 to 1828 in luxuriously furnished rented apartments at 49 Great Marlborough Street (formerly inhabited by the actress Sarah Siddons), where he formed a collection of prints and maiolica and entertained extravagantly. His guests included Lamb, Sir David Wilkie, William Macready, Charles Wentworth Dilke, Talfourd, and B. W. Procter (Barry Cornwall), who described Mrs Wainewright as &#145;a sharp-eyed, self-possessed woman dressed in showy, flimsy finery&#146;  (Curling, 218). Under mounting financial pressure Wainewright, in the names of his trustees, forged the signatures on a power of attorney instructing the Bank of England to pay him part of the capital sum on which, under the terms of his grandfather's will, he was entitled to the interest alone. According to Andrew Motion the forgery took place in 1822, ten days &#145;after the &pound;5,000 Navy 5 per cent stock, which TGW had inherited from his grandfather, was converted to &pound;5,250 New 4 per cent Annuities on 5 July 1822&#146;  (Motion, 129). On that occasion Wainewright fraudulently obtained &pound;2250 and then &#145;committed a second forgery on 17 May 1823, and collected the remaining &pound;3000&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Again financially embarrassed, in 1828 Wainewright and his wife went to live with his uncle George Edward Griffiths, who had remained a bachelor, at Linden House, Chiswick. When Griffiths died, suddenly and intestate, on 16 January 1828, aged about fifty-six, his estate passed to Wainewright as his next of kin. On 4 June at St Nicholas's, Chiswick, Wainewright's son was baptized Griffiths Wainewright, after his recently deceased great-uncle (the gap of eleven years between his parents' marriage and the boy's baptism has led some commentators to suggest that he may have been illegitimate). Over the same period Wainewright's mother-in-law, Mrs Abercromby, and his wife's two half-sisters Helen Frances Phoebe (<i>b</i>. 1809) and Madalina Rosa Hibernia 
    (Madeleine; <i>b</i>. 1810)
   also came to live at Linden House. Apart from the house itself, however, the value of George Griffiths's estate had amounted to about &pound;5000&#151;not enough to pay off all Wainewright's debts and maintain the property and his extended family&#151;and he entered into precipitous loan arrangements with a number of creditors. Under a warrant of attorney he owed &pound;610 to a Mr Sharpus, to whom in July 1830 he granted a bill of sale for the furniture and effects of Linden House. Both the warrant and the bill were dated 21 December 1830. The house and estate he mortgaged to a moneylender to whom he was already heavily in debt.<br>
<br>In March 1830 Wainewright, with his wife, persuaded her half-sister Helen Abercromby (of whom Wainewright made a portrait drawing; repr. Hazlitt, facing p. 29) to insure her life for two sums, of &pound;2000 and &pound;3000. Mrs Abercromby objected to further policies being taken out on her daughter's life, but in August of that year she herself died a sudden and agonizing death in Linden House. Further policies were taken out in Helen's name; her life was insured, in total for &pound;18,000, with six different insurance companies. In each case Wainewright paid the premium. On 12 December the family moved to lodgings at 12 Conduit Street, London, where on the following day Helen made a will naming her sister Madeleine legatee and Wainewright executor. On 21 December, the day that Wainewright's bills fell due, Helen Abercromby died, aged twenty-one. Her symptoms, as recalled by the family nurse, Sarah Handcock, and the servant Harriet Grattan, were identical to those of her mother, but in contrast to her mother's sudden death Helen's condition, which led to dizziness, vomiting, loss of sight, and convulsions, had worsened over several days. Dr Charles Locock (who later attended Queen Victoria at the births of her children) had attended Helen in her illness and performed an autopsy on the day after her death. He observed some irritation to the stomach but attributed her death to the ill effects of a gastric chill and an indigestible supper of oysters and beer that Helen had consumed a few days before she died. At that date the means to detect strychnine as a cause of death had not been established, and her case is of interest in the history of toxicology. The suspicious circumstances of her death led the insurance companies to withhold payment, and Wainewright filed a bill in chancery to recover &pound;3000 from one insurance company, the Imperial, before leaving for the continent. Mrs Wainewright, the boy Griffiths, and Madeleine Abercromby meanwhile went to live in Pimlico.<br>
<br>In 1835 Wainewright's suit against the Imperial insurance company came before Mr Justice Abinger in the court of the exchequer. The judge directed the jury not to consider whether murder had been committed. They could not agree a verdict and the case went to a second trial, when the jury found for the defendants on the ground of concealment by Miss Abercromby. Throughout this period Wainewright had remained in France, where he had spent some months in prison in Paris; on his arrest the French police had found him to be carrying strychnine. In June 1837 he returned to London, even though in 1835 the Bank of England had discovered the forgery that he had committed over ten years earlier and had issued a warrant for his arrest. He was recognized by Forrester, a City runner, and arrested. On 5 July 1837 he at first pleaded not guilty to five indictments at the Old Bailey but then, after hearing that the Imperial would not press the three capital charges if he pleaded guilty to the two small charges, he changed his plea accordingly. He was sentenced by the recorder to transportation to Van Diemen's Land for life. Though strongly suspected, no charge of murder was ever brought against him. The anecdote, referred to by Oscar Wilde, that Wainewright confessed to killing Helen because she had such thick ankles, while supported by visual evidence in his drawings of women that he was fascinated by their ankles, remains unconfirmed by a first-hand confessional document. (Various sources mention that Wainewright left a diary but this has not come to light.) While in Newgate awaiting transportation he was recognized by Macready, who was visiting the prison with John Forster and Charles Dickens.<h2>
<a name="Transportationdeathandreputation"></a>Transportation, death, and reputation</h2>Sent out on the convict ship <i>Susan</i>, Wainewright arrived in Hobart on 21 November 1837. He worked on the roads in a chain gang and later transferred from the prisoners' barracks to Hobart Hospital, where he worked on the wards. Following a decline in his health he was relieved of some duties and allowed to paint portraits of hospital staff, local officials, and members of their families. His portraits of women tend to show slender, smooth-haired, doe-eyed sitters in a hard outline resembling a fashion plate. Examples of these are in the Art Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide, and the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra. A self-portrait drawing that he made in the 1840s (repr. Curling, frontispiece) shows him almost full-face, with long, thinning, receding hair and a dark moustache. His eyebrows are sharply arched over deep-set eyes that do not confront the viewer directly but look away to one side. A dark line over the bridge of his nose gives the impression of a frown. His shirt is open at the neck and the collar of his jacket turned up in a slightly Byronic fashion. The drawing is inscribed, perhaps in Wainewright's hand, &#145;Head of a <i>Convict</i>, very characteristic of <i>low cunning</i> &amp; x <i>revenge</i>!&#146;. In April 1844 he fulsomely petitioned the governor of Van Diemen's Land, Sir John Eardley-Wilmot, for a ticket-of-leave. This was refused but he was granted a probation pass, and in November his name was announced in the Hobart <span class="italic">Gazette</span> as one that would go forward to Queen Victoria for a conditional pardon  (Motion, 277). In December 1845 his ticket-of-leave was granted. Wainewright died, of apoplexy, in St Mary's Hospital, Hobart, on 17 August 1847.<br>
<br>A gentlemanly education, literary and artistic skills, and a cultivated taste for objects of high aesthetic quality, combined with the capacity for criminal acts including forgery and, apparently, poisoning, have made Wainewright an intriguing subject for fiction and biography; examples of the former include Edward Bulwer Lytton's <span class="italic">Lucretia, or, The Children of the Night</span> (1846), Dickens's <span class="italic">Hunted Down</span>, and Hal Porter's <span class="italic">The Tilted Cross</span> (1961). Melodramatic newspaper and magazine accounts of Wainewright that appeared after his death coloured later studies and biographical accounts such as those included in Talfourd's <span class="italic">Final Memorials of Charles Lamb</span> (1848); Walter Thornbury's <span class="italic">Old Stories Re-told</span> (1870); A. G. Allen's account in Thomas Seccombe's <span class="italic">Twelve Bad Men</span> (1894); B. W. Procter's <span class="italic">An Autobiographical Fragment</span> (1877); Oscar Wilde's essay &#145;Pen, Pencil and Poison: a Study in Green&#146;, in the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> (1889); and W. C. Hazlitt's biographical essay in his collection of Wainewright's essays and criticisms (1880). In <span class="italic">Janus Weathercock</span> (1938) Jonathan Curling set out to distinguish between the facts of Wainewright's existence and the layers of speculation and story-telling that have subsequently embellished accounts of his life. His conscientious use of primary sources corrected many errors but introduced others, and further records have subsequently come to light. Perceiving difficulties in the use of &#145;orthodox biographical methods&#146; in recovering Wainewright's history, Andrew Motion experimented in <span class="italic">Wainewright the Poisoner</span> (2000) with &#145;a mixture of different forms&#151;some imaginative, some factual&#146;  (pp. xvi, xviii). Although not &#145;designed to &#147;correct&#148; [Wainewright's] Confession in any consistent way&#146;  (Motion, xviii) the notes at the end of each chapter contain unreliable information that undermines their usefulness in establishing the facts of Wainewright's existence. The recent discovery of further documents relating to Wainewright means that he continues to be the subject of biographical investigation.<br>
