<span class="headword">Dillon,  Charles</span>  (1819&#150;1881), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born in Diss, Norfolk, probably the illegitimate son of Charles James Church, an itinerant actor, and Eliza, who married Arthur Dillon, a minor London actor and theatrical agent, whose name he adopted.<br>
<br>Until 1856 Dillon played small roles in London's minor theatres, writing plays on demand while at the Marylebone Theatre, and toured provincial towns, including Hull, Sheffield, Wolverhampton, Manchester, and Dublin. During this period he established himself as a Shakespearian actor in roles such as Macbeth, Othello, and Hamlet, roles which he retained for the rest of his career. He married Clara (1824/5&#150;1888), the daughter of a London theatre manager, Benjamin Conquest, and their daughter, also Clara, was born in 1845. With the financial assistance of his father-in-law, Dillon managed the Theatre Royal and, subsequently, the Adelphi, Sheffield, between 1850 and 1856.<br>
<br>The period 1856 to 1860 was the most successful of Dillon's career. His performance as Belphegor in <span class="italic">Belphegor the Mountebank, or, Woman's Constancy</span>, adapted by Charles Webb from <span class="italic">Le Paillasse</span> by Dennery and Fournier, brought him to the attention of London theatre critics. The play opened at Sadler's Wells on 21 April 1856, and John Oxenford's review in <span class="italic">The Times</span> two days later, in which he stated that &#145;it was not often that we see such rare effects of pathos produced with such a thorough absence of stage trick&#146;, made Dillon's reputation. On the strength of his success, and again with Conquest's assistance, he took a lease of the Lyceum Theatre in September 1856, which he retained for two seasons, until March 1858. During this time his performances as D'Artagnan in his own version of <span class="italic">The Three Musqueteers</span> (16 October 1856), Claude Melnotte in Bulwer-Lytton's <span class="italic">The Lady of Lyons</span> (10 November 1856), Othello (1 December 1856), and Macbeth, opposite Helen Faucit as Lady Macbeth (25 February 1858), were particularly commended for their geniality, tenderness, and understatement, characteristics which, at his best, became hallmarks of Dillon's acting. His relationship, however, with Eliza Webb, the daughter of Charles Webb, contributed to the breakup of his marriage after the closing of the second Lyceum season. Following a further tour of the provinces he sailed for New York on 22 December 1860.<br>
<br>The third period in Dillon's career, from 1861 to 1867, was taken up by a tour which included North America, Australia, New Zealand, Peru, and Chile. He began by playing a range of his repertory in New York, Boston, Baltimore, and Philadelphia, including Belphegor and Virginius (in Sheridan Knowles's play of the same name) and also Boucicault's <span class="italic">Louis XI</span>. Accompanied by Eliza Webb, he then toured Canada, including Toronto, Quebec, and Montreal. They left for San Francisco and opened there at the Metropolitan Theatre on 21 October 1861. Critical assessment mirrored that of the London critics, but financially the tour was proving disastrous. Dillon left for Australia from Vancouver and arrived in Melbourne, Victoria, in November 1862.<br>
<br>From 1862 to 1864 Dillon and Eliza Webb (now billed as Mrs Charles Dillon, although there is no evidence that they married) remained in Australia, touring the Victorian country towns of Bendigo and Ballarat, and Adelaide and Sydney, where they spent the greater part of their time. Dillon found himself occasionally in direct competition with Barry Sullivan as well as Charles and Ellen Kean, who were also in Australia in 1863&#150;4. Following a short stay in Tasmania that began in August 1864, the Dillons sailed for New Zealand. Dillon opened as Virginius in Auckland (5 January 1865) and once again included Othello, Macbeth, and Belphegor in his season. After playing in Christchurch and Dunedin, the Dillons left for Peru in July 1865. Although he intended an extensive tour of South America, political instability forced the Dillons to leave Chile hurriedly, and in December 1865 they returned to New York, where Eliza died of typhoid fever. Dillon remained in the United States until the end of 1866, and left for England in early 1867 after a final season in New York.<br>
<br>Throughout his extended tour Dillon had relied heavily on a repertory that he had developed in London, the British provinces, and on tour in North America, augmented by versions of <span class="italic">King Lear</span> and <span class="italic">Timon of Athens</span>, Byron's <span class="italic">Manfred</span>, Taylor's <span class="italic">The Ticket-of-Leave Man</span>, and John Brougham's adaptation of <span class="italic">The Duke's Motto</span>. However, there were ominous signs of deterioration in Dillon's performances, which had been noticed by Australasian and, subsequently, American critics. He was increasingly unable to sustain his roles vocally and was losing the ability to play the emotional nuances that earlier critics had applauded.<br>
<br>The last phase of Dillon's career was marked by an increasing personal sense of disappointment and, critically, by one of irrelevance to contemporary theatre practice. He opened in Manchester as Lear on 7 March 1867. Although he repeated his performance as Lear at Sadler's Wells (17 February 1868) and as Manfred at the Princess's (16 August 1873), he spent his final years in the provinces. He married Bella Mentrup, an actress, in Cardiff in June 1874. His last appearances in London were at Drury Lane, as Leontes in <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span> (28 September 1878) and as Shylock (7 December 1878). He died suddenly of a stroke in Hawick, Roxburghshire, on 24 June 1881 and was buried in Brompton cemetery on 26 June.<br>
<br>Although physically unattractive, Dillon embodied a seedy flamboyance perhaps best captured in Mrs Sam Cowell's memory of him at the beginning of his American tour: &#145;in a threadbare suit, big, dirty boots, and a large, Theatrical [<i>sic</i>] cloak (which was braided profusely, and lined with red silk), so ragged, as to hang down on all sides in festoons&#146;  (Disher, 325). As an actor, Dillon's lack of technique and his reliance on momentary inspiration rather than on consistency in characterization made his deficiencies more apparent when his vocal abilities deteriorated. Westland Marston described him as &#145;an actor of great emotional gifts, but very deficient in intellectual ones&#146;  (Marston, 308).<br>
