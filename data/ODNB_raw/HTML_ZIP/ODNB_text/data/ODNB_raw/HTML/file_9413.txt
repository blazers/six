<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fiennes,  Nathaniel</span>  (1607/8&#150;1669), <span class="occ">politician and army officer</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9415/', "William Fiennes, first Viscount Saye and Sele (1582&#150;1662)")</script>, and his wife, Elizabeth Temple (<i>d</i>. 1648). He attended Winchester College and on 19 November 1624, aged sixteen, matriculated from New College, Oxford, where he qualified as founder's kin. According to Anthony Wood, he stayed five years but did not take a degree. Edward Hyde, earl of Clarendon, noted that after university Fiennes went to Geneva and elsewhere in Switzerland, where he was influenced further in the animosity toward the church which he had already learned from his father. He also suggested that Fiennes travelled back to England by way of Scotland where he established contacts between the Scots and the English opposition. While there is strong evidence that Fiennes went to Scotland late in 1639 or early in 1640, he had returned home in the meantime. On 11 August 1636 he married at Haynes, Bedfordshire, Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1616), eldest daughter of the 1620s MP <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8630/', "Sir John Eliot (1592&#150;1632)")</script>, who had died a prisoner in the Tower of London.<br>
<br>With the convening of the Short Parliament in April 1640, Fiennes was elected MP for Banbury, thanks to the influence of his father. He does not seem to have taken a significant part, although Saye later claimed that the parliament's dissolution was above all a strategy to block a motion by his son that any money raised through taxation should not be employed against their &#145;brethren&#146; in Scotland. His role in the Long Parliament of November 1640, where he also sat for Banbury, was much more important. He became one of the chief spokesmen for the opposition to the crown and a prominent figure in the middle group under the leadership of John Pym, to whom he was one of &#145;his most trusted lieutenants&#146;  (Fletcher, 26). Fiennes was particularly significant in two areas. The first was his work in the early summer of 1641 in systematically revealing the strands of the so-called army plot, which he did through committee and in speeches. He was also active in attacking the bishops and calling for the abolition of episcopacy. In two published speeches, especially, one on the church canons of December 1640 and the other on the London petition in February 1641, he emerged as a key figure in the assault on the church. Fiennes accused the hierarchy of attempting to create a religion of its own choosing and to impose it upon the people, of trying to sow dissension between the king and parliament, and of endeavouring to punish individuals for things which were not under their jurisdiction. In reference to the canons Fiennes took issue with the bishops' claim to define heresy and saw it as the responsibility of the state to restrain and control the clergy. He has, on that account, been labelled as an Erastian. Most historians see him as a radical on the question of episcopacy, along with men like Oliver Cromwell and Henry Vane the younger. In this connection Clarendon recounted that Fiennes had asked him to go out riding, at which time the latter declared that episcopal government was intolerable to many and that &#145;if the king resolved to defend the bishops, it would cost the kingdom much blood&#146;  (cited in Fletcher, 124).<br>
<br>Fiennes also saw service on numerous committees, including those which in 1641 drew up the grand remonstrance and considered the root-and-branch petition, and in 1642 he was a member of the important committee for safety. Moreover, he was named as a commissioner to travel with the king to Scotland in August 1641 along with, among others, John Hampden. The extent to which his thinking departed from the king's is attested by his remark in the house on 2 April 1642 that &#145;the king had no negative voice in passing those acts of Parliament which both Houses had agreed unto but was to assent to them&#146;  (quoted in Russell, 501).<br>
<br>At the outset of the civil war Fiennes served with his father and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9412/', "John Fiennes (d. in or before 1710)")</script> in the unsuccessful attempt to prevent guns from Robert Greville, Lord Brooke, from falling into the hands of Spencer Compton, earl of Northampton, at Banbury, Oxfordshire, in August 1642. Later the same month he served with John Hampden in the relief of Coventry and in September was involved at Worcester. Fiennes also fought at the battle of Edghill in October. Several times he was described as having acted bravely and when the king briefly occupied Banbury in November both Fiennes and his father were exempted from the pardon.<br>
<br>In February 1643 Fiennes was sent to Bristol following suspicion of the loyalty of the parliamentary governor. The garrison had been denuded by General Sir William Waller, parliamentarian commander in the west, and the leadership of the city was royalist in sympathy; in March two men were executed for plotting to open the city to Prince Rupert. Appointed governor by the earl of Essex in May, Fiennes argued that he needed more men and supplies, but when the prince appeared before Bristol in July and commenced his attack, Fiennes was left with insufficient resources and an unsympathetic populace. Moreover the ships in Bristol harbour had been convinced to declare for the king. Though there was resistance at first, some of it quite effective, when Rupert's forces breached the walls of the city Fiennes, with no help in sight, considered the battle lost and in August he surrendered. On terms published in <span class="italic">A Copie of the Articles Agreed upon at the Surrender of the City of Bristol</span> (1643), his forces were allowed to leave Bristol with partial arms.<br>
<br>Fiennes made a defence of his actions to the House of Commons, which was published as <span class="italic">A Relation</span> (1643), and also issued <span class="italic">Colonel Fiennes Letter to my Lord General Concerning Bristol</span> (1643), but he was accused by William Prynne and Clement Walker of treason and cowardice. At Fiennes's request, a trial before Essex and a council of war was held in December. Found guilty not on the more serious charges, but only for improper surrender, he was none the less sentenced to death, but he was subsequently pardoned by Essex and may have left England for a period of time. Clarendon reflected that but for this episode Fiennes would have had a bright future. Describing him as a man esteemed by the Commons and of &#145;very good parts of learning and nature&#146;, he opined that, if he had stayed out of the army, for which some thought him not suited, &#145;he had sure been second to none after Mr. Hampden's death in those councils&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.254).<br>
<br>In 1645 Fiennes experienced a kind of vindication of his actions at Bristol when the city was quickly surrendered by Prince Rupert to parliamentary forces, and consequently that year he returned to public life. His reappearance in the House of Commons found him playing an important part in its affairs. He once again became a member of the middle group or &#145;royalist independents&#146; who had coalesced around Oliver St John after the death of Pym. Seeking to maintain the balanced constitutional reforms of 1641&#150;2, the middle group pursued a path that lay between the radicals on the one hand, and the peace party, now including the Scots, on the other. Moreover, Fiennes continued his strong objection to independent, coercive clerical power, be it episcopal or presbyterian, as can be seen in his strong warning of April 1646 to the Westminster assembly that they should obey the authority of parliament. In many of these activities he worked in co-operation with his father.<br>
<br>In this connection much attention has been given to <span class="italic">Vindiciae veritatis</span>, which appeared in 1654, although written between 1646 and 1648. Echoing the ideas outlined above, as well as containing a defence of Fiennes's military career, the pamphlet is a strong endorsement of middle-group positions and a forceful criticism of the Scots. Some have identified this as the work of Saye and some have attributed it to Nathaniel, while others have suggested a collaboration between the two. There seems no clearcut answer to the authorship, but it is clear that the ideas expressed mirror the opinions of Nathaniel Fiennes and can be read with profit to understand them.<br>
<br>In the period after the conclusion of the first civil war Fiennes worked, along with the middle group, to achieve a settlement with the king, but not at the price of sacrificing their goals or negotiating out of weakness. Thus, he supported the army in its struggle with the presbyterians in the Commons and was one of those, along with his father and brother, John, who fled to the army in August 1647. Fiennes endorsed <span class="italic">The Heads of Proposals</span>, but when Charles I escaped to the Isle of Wight in November and then refused the &#145;four bills&#146;, embodying once again the programme of the middle group, Fiennes joined in the negative reaction in November and was credited with drawing up the declaration defending the vote of no addresses to the king which appeared in February 1648. In addition, in January 1648 Fiennes was made a member of the newly formed Derby House committee.<br>
<br>However, following the second civil war, as it became evident that the army was moving in a more radical direction, Fiennes and his colleagues, seeing the destruction of their ideals of political balance, continued to attempt a negotiated settlement based on the treaty of Newport. When the king's answers to the treaty were debated in the house in December, Fiennes endorsed the need for settlement in what Underdown calls a &#145;notable speech&#146; and a &#145;remarkable oration&#146;. Fiennes's statements, he comments significantly, represented &#145;the final testimony of the middle group&#146;.<br>
<br>Shortly after, however, when the army had determined on the king's trial, Fiennes found himself swept up in Pride's Purge and was one of those members secluded, albeit being released the same day. With the establishment of the Commonwealth he left public life and remained aloof until the establishment of the protectorate. It may be that Fiennes saw the protectorate as in keeping with his ideas of a balanced polity and so was ready to resume a public role.<br>
<br>Fiennes became a member of the council of state on 26 April 1654 and was appointed one of the keepers of the great seal in June 1655&#151;he became a prominent figure under Oliver Cromwell. He sat in the parliament of 1654 for the county of Oxford and in 1656 represented the university. He emerged as one of the chief movers in the attempt to convince Cromwell to take the crown and spoke at length during the discussions, pointing out the advantage of Cromwell's taking the title of king, having that authority, rather than holding a title that had no limitations. In taking this view he was joining middle group associates like John Glyn in arguing for a settlement that would represent their political values. A pamphlet, <span class="italic">Monarchy Asserted</span> (1660), which printed these discussions, is attributed to Fiennes.<br>
<br>Later, after Cromwell had refused the crown but accepted the rest of the proposal, Fiennes and his brother John became members of the Cromwellian House of Lords, although his father staunchly refused to recognize that body. In an enthusiastic address of January 1658 Fiennes lauded the new constitution as taking a middle path between two extremes, providing the balance that was so dear to his ideology. At the same time, he continued his concern with religious issues, attempting to mitigate the treatment of the Quaker James Naylor, advocating a limited toleration, but criticizing the Quakers for not recognizing the authority of the magistrate. The spiritual quality of his speeches and interest in that dimension of Cromwellian foreign policy is notable.<br>
<br>In September 1658 Fiennes was one of those who attended Cromwell's deathbed and attested to his designation of Richard Cromwell as his successor. He was also one of those who advised Richard to dissolve parliament in April 1659 and when the Rump was restored in May he was not appointed to a position. Consequently, he removed himself to his country house at Newton Tony, Wiltshire, was ignored by the Restoration government, and took no further part in public events. He seems to have divided his time between Newton Tony and his other house, Bromby Wood Hall, Lincolnshire. By the late 1650s his wife Elizabeth had died; she was buried at Framingham, Lincolnshire. He married a second wife, Frances (1621&#150;1691), daughter of Colonel Richard Whitehead of West Tytherley, Hampshire. In his will, drawn up on 5 October 1669, he divided his lands in Wiltshire, Lincolnshire, Gloucestershire, and Hampshire between his two sons from his first marriage, Nathaniell (<i>c</i>.1637&#150;<i>c</i>.1672) and William, and four daughters from his second, Frances, Anne, Celia, and Mary. Although he then described himself as in &#145;reasonable health&#146; he died on 16 December; there is a monument to him in Newton Tony church. At least three of his children died young, but William (1639&#150;1698) succeeded his uncle James Fiennes (<i>c</i>.1603&#150;1674) as third Viscount Saye and Sele, Mary (1663&#150;1737) married Sir Edmund Harrison, a London merchant, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37414/', "Celia Fiennes (1662&#150;1741)")</script> was the celebrated traveller.<br>
