<span class="headword">Stuart,  (Herbert) Akroyd <span class="st"> [Ackroyd]</span></span>  (1864&#150;1927), <span class="occ">mechanical engineer</span>, was born at 37 Victoria Street, Halifax, Yorkshire, on 28 January 1864, the second of six children of Charles Stuart, a pattern maker, and his wife, Ann, daughter of Jonathan Ackroyd, a worsted cloth weaver of Luddenden near Halifax. His father was born in Paisley, near Glasgow, but was working in Halifax by 1858.<br>
<br>At the age of twelve Stuart was sent to St Bartholomew's Grammar School in Newbury, Berkshire. Shortly afterwards the family moved to Fenny Stratford, where his father had acquired the Bletchley ironworks, manufacturing steam engines and boilers. On leaving school Stuart joined his father as an engineering apprentice, and also worked for a time in the mechanical engineering laboratories of the City and Guilds Technical College in Finsbury, London. His father had installed a Spiel petroleum engine to drive some of the machinery in his workshops, and Stuart was inspired to work on the problem of developing an internal combustion engine that would run on heavier (and safer) grades of fuel oil. He took out his first two engine patents in 1886, and having progressively improved the design to give more complete combustion and avoid pre-ignition, in 1890 he was granted two patents for a hot-bulb oil engine, two years before Rudolf Diesel's first English patent for his compression-ignition oil engine. A small number of Stuart's engines had already been built and tested in Bletchley by 1890, on one occasion by the chief engineer of Richard Hornsby &amp; Sons of Grantham, who soon afterwards became the sole licensees, manufacturers, and developers of the Hornsby&#150;Akroyd oil engine.<br>
<br>The engine was very simple, efficient, and reliable in operation, with the minor disadvantage that the vaporizer required preheating for a few minutes before the engine could be started; when running, it retained sufficient heat to ignite the injected fuel. Essentially slow running and of limited horsepower, the majority of the many thousands of engines made by Hornsby between 1892 and 1922 were used as stationary engines for agricultural and general workshop purposes. They were also used to power the first oil-engined tractor and the first practical oil-engined locomotive, both in 1896. A 20 hp Hornsby&#150;Akroyd engine powered the world's first caterpillar tractor in 1905, but later attempts to match the development of the high-speed diesel engine were unsuccessful.<br>
<br>Stuart was elected a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1901. A few years previously he had emigrated to Australia, where he involved himself in the design and manufacture of the Akroyd patent down-draught gas producer. He evidently resented the fact that the name &#145;diesel&#146; had come to be applied to virtually every type of oil engine, hot-bulb (ignition) as well as compression-ignition, and in 1923 he asked the institution to declare that henceforth the word diesel should only be used to describe oil engines operating on the compression-ignition principle, hot-bulb engines to be known as akroyds. The institution, however, did not feel able to recommend such a change after the word diesel had been in universal use for so long.<br>
<br>Stuart died in Claremont, Western Australia, on 19 February 1927, a disappointed if not embittered man, and in his will directed that all his papers should be burned. His body was brought home and buried in the Akroyd cemetery, Halifax.<br>
