<span class="headword">Morrison,  Charles</span>  (1817&#150;1909), <span class="occ">merchant banker</span>, was born in London on 20 September 1817, the eldest of seven sons and four daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19326/', "James Morrison (1789&#150;1857)")</script>, then a humble shopman but later to become a self-made wholesale textile warehouseman, merchant banker, and MP, who made himself one of the very wealthiest men in Britain, leaving perhaps &pound;5 million at his death, as well as over 100,000 acres of land. Charles Morrison's mother, Mary Anne Todd (<i>d</i>. 1887), was the daughter of the proprietor of Todd &amp; Co., the textile warehouse at Fore Street in the City of London, of which James Morrison became manager after his marriage and which he then developed into perhaps the largest business of its kind in Britain. Charles Morrison was educated at private schools in London and Geneva until the age of fifteen, and spent three years each at the University of Edinburgh, and at Trinity College, Cambridge. Although he won several prizes at Edinburgh, through ill health he was forced to leave Cambridge without taking a degree.<br>
<br>In 1841 Charles Morrison and his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19323/', "Alfred Morrison")</script> joined their father in a new firm, Morrison, Sons &amp; Co., located at 62 Moorgate Street, which took over the financial and merchant banking interests their father had been developing. While Charles Morrison remained a partner in the Fore Street textile warehouse until it became a limited company in 1864, it was chiefly as a financier and merchant banker that he spent the remainder of his long life.<br>
<br>Morrison, Sons &amp; Co. chiefly expanded into two types of investment: lending money on the security of mortgages to British aristocrats (among them the duke of Buckingham and Chandos , who became a spectacular bankrupt), and investments in foreign railroads, especially in France and the United States. Charles Morrison travelled extensively throughout the United States in the early 1840s, and his surviving letters and diaries offer a vivid description of America in a time of great economic and demographic expansion. Although Morrison, Sons &amp; Co. was heavily hit by the liquidation of the Bank of the United States in 1841, it prospered thereafter. James Morrison owned &pound;800,000 in American securities at his death in 1857.<br>
<br>In the 1850s Morrison, Sons &amp; Co. appears to have been wound up, and, enriched by a generous inheritance from his father, Charles Morrison spent the next sixty years as an independent merchant banker, though he also sat on the boards of several companies, and served as chairman of the Hounslow and Metropolitan Railway Company and of the North British and Mercantile Insurance Company. Morrison increasingly specialized in South American securities, becoming prominent, in particular, in the River Plate Trust, which built many of the railways and utilities in Argentina from the 1870s onwards. He continued as well with mortgage, railway, and utility investments in Britain, and for many years made a speciality of purchasing good securities at what an obituarist described as &#145;absurdly low prices&#146; during times of economic disturbance, frequently selling when their prices rose. It is believed that he kept a large sum in gold as a reserve against a time of serious financial trouble. Although no miser, he lived a bachelor existence with some frugality, and habitually saved most of his vast income. By these means, continued over many decades, Morrison greatly increased even his father's princely wealth, and was certainly among the half-dozen wealthiest men in Britain when he died. Although Morrison was well-known to the financial <i>cognoscenti</i>&#151;a 300-word obituary appeared in <span class="italic">The Times</span> when he died&#151;he was virtually unknown to the general public and is a classic instance of a virtually unknown man who, quietly and behind the scenes, exercised perhaps greater economic influence than many household names. At his death Morrison left the extraordinary sum of &pound;10,936,666, considerably more than the value of any estate ever left previously by a British businessman. Despite his near total obscurity, Morrison was probably the wealthiest financier in Britain, far richer than any individual member of the renowned Baring and Rothschild families. Charles Morrison and his family also remained totally unknown to economic historians until the 1970s, when they were rediscovered as remarkable leviathans of wealth.<br>
<br>Apart from his business interests, Charles Morrison was also a landowner on a grand scale, inheriting the entire island of Islay in Argyll from his father, who had purchased it in 1849. In 1883 Charles Morrison owned 75,732 acres with an annual rental income of &pound;31,434. Apart from Islay's 67,000 acres in Argyll, Morrison owned the 7000-acre Basildon Park estate in Berkshire, and smaller holdings in Essex, Oxford, and Suffolk. The five Morrison brothers, who are recorded in John Bateman's <span class="italic">Great Landowners</span> (1883 edn), owned 106,915 acres, yielding &pound;53,740 in landed income, more than that of most dukes. Although Charles Morrison occasionally visited Islay, he spent most of his time at Basildon Park. At Islay, however, he maintained a steamer service at an annual loss of &pound;6000 in order to benefit his tenants, who had no other way of getting their stock to market.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Morrison was shy and retiring, and suffered from cystitis. He took little or no direct part in public life, although he served as deputy lieutenant for Argyll and Berkshire. In 1854 he published an <span class="italic">Essay on Labour and Capital</span> in which he advised workers to marry late, produce fewer children, and thus raise their living standards; he also praised the cautious, intelligent businessman as superior to the speculator. At his Basildon home he maintained a valuable painting collection, which included works by Leonardo, Rembrandt, Rubens, Turner, and Watteau. He was an Anglican, and a supporter of the Liberal Party throughout the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Charles Morrison died at Basildon Park on 25 May 1909. He was unmarried, and his enormous estate was divided among his many relatives, with his nephew Hugh Morrison (1868&#150;1931) (later a Conservative MP) inheriting the Islay estate and a larger share of his vast personal fortune than anyone else.<br>
