<span class="headword">Osborne, Sir  Cyril</span>  (1898&#150;1969), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 19 June 1898 in Hucknall Lane, Bulwell, Nottingham, the son of Thomas Osborne, a coalminer, and his wife, Ann, formerly Bonser (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Carnell). Brought up in what he recalled was &#145;a very stern puritan home&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 632, 12 Dec 1960, 66), he was educated at the local elementary school, began work at the age of fourteen, and undertook a variety of arduous manual jobs before enlisting as a private with the Royal Field Artillery. He served in France, Belgium, Italy, and Egypt. Thereafter, as a former serviceman, he was able to read economics at University College, Nottingham. He then became a successful businessman and stockbroker, and eventually a director of a number of textile and wholesale grocery companies. Following the death of his first wife (whose name is not known), he married on 4 December 1935 Joyce Lawrence (<i>b</i>. 1908/9), daughter of Ernest Louis Feibusch, a solicitor, of Wolverhampton. They had two sons and two daughters. During the Second World War he was a welfare adviser in the midlands and assisted the Ministry of Information. In 1945 he was elected Conservative MP for the Louth division of Lincolnshire, a seat he held until his death.<br>
<br>Osborne is chiefly associated with the campaign to limit immigration into Britain from the new Commonwealth. He first raised the issue in 1950, asking for separate figures for non-white immigration, and in 1952 he began a campaign for controls. While insisting that he was not racially prejudiced, he called for restrictions on entry on several grounds: the sheer volume of actual or potential immigrants; the abuse of the welfare state (&#145;the honey pot&#146;); overcrowding; crime, especially drug trafficking and prostitution; unemployment; and health, especially tuberculosis and leprosy. Inclined to lose his temper, and to reveal openly his wish to keep Britain white, he was sometimes an embarrassment in the Commons. Several MPs judged that his extreme, provocative manner did a disservice to the cause he was advocating.<br>
<br>In many ways, however, Osborne's campaign was successful. In 1958, for instance, the Conservative Party conference called for restrictions on entry, and the 1959 general election saw the return of many more MPs, including twelve from Birmingham, who wished to abandon the &#145;open door&#146; policy. He distributed to delegates at the 1961 conference copies of a letter he had written to the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, in which he urged immediate restrictions, warning that in time there would be more non-white than white people in Britain: &#145;We shall cease to be a European nation and become a mixed Afro-Asian society&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 11 Oct 1961). Shortly afterwards R. A. Butler, the home secretary, introduced the <span class="roman">Commonwealth Immigrants Bill</span> into the Commons, and Osborne was dubbed by <span class="italic">The Times</span> &#145;the spirit, if not the architect, of the Bill&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 17 Nov 1961). Symbolically, it was in 1961 that he was knighted. Thereafter he maintained better relations with the party. In March 1965 he was persuaded by the shadow home secretary to moderate a motion about to be put to the Commons: instead of calling for a ban on all future immigration, except for those whose parents or grandparents had been born in Britain, he called instead for &#145;periodic and precise limits&#146; to be fixed&#151;and he was supported by the votes of the whole shadow cabinet. His demand for assisted repatriation also found its way into official Conservative policy. In many ways Osborne's views prefigured those which Enoch Powell articulated in 1968, though Osborne had none of Powell's subtlety.<br>
<br>Osborne was also noted for his opposition to generally progressive causes. E. M. Forster, a fellow member of the Reform Club, remembered him as always &#145;denouncing something&#146;  (Williams, 129). He was opposed to extending the licensing laws, to the creation of football pools and premium bonds, to the abolition of corporal punishment and of the death penalty, and to the decriminalization of homosexuality. Leo Abse judged that the driving force in him was a rigid puritanism, consequent upon an unusually repressed childhood  (Abse, 148&#150;9). Certainly he often referred to his stern Victorian upbringing. He was the only MP to oppose the pay rise which the House of Commons voted itself in 1964, and, characteristically, the politician for whom he professed the most complete admiration was Stafford Cripps. Osborne had genuine fears of a world population explosion, of economic collapse, and of decadence in the West. He was chairman of the Anglo-Soviet parliamentary group, a justice of the peace in Leicester, a governor of Leicester Royal Infirmary, and, for twenty years, chairman of the Leicester chamber of commerce. He died of natural causes at the Royal Infirmary, Leicester, on 31 August 1969, having lived in his later years at Kinchley House, Rothley, Leicestershire. His second wife survived him.<br>
