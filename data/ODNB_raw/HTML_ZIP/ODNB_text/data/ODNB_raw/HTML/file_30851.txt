<span class="headword">Bridson,  (Douglas) Geoffrey</span>  (1910&#150;1980), <span class="occ">writer and radio broadcaster</span>, was born on 21 August 1910 at Heaton Norris, near Stockport, the only child of John Douglas Bridson, a Manx shipping manager, of Stockport, and his wife, Marion (1883/4&#150;1967), daughter of Josiah Barlow, of Rawtenstall, and his wife, Marion Bowker, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ruthven. His parents soon moved to Lytham St Anne's, where he attended King Edward VII School (1920&#150;27), matriculating brilliantly at an early age.<br>
<br>In 1927 Bridson and his mother went back to Manchester, already, as he later described it, &#145;the waning capital of a grimly autonomous Northern republic&#146;. He soon relieved a routine office job with the Sun Insurance Company by contributing both verse and criticism to local and national publications. Bridson's poems of social protest, written during the depression while he was still under twenty-one, caught the eye of Ezra Pound, the American poet. They also brought him to the notice of E. A. F. (Archie) Harding, the talented BBC programme director in Manchester whose Marxist views had caused Sir John Reith to remove him from being a features producer in London.<br>
<br>Bridson began to contribute programmes for Harding and found they shared a crusading passion for the radio feature as an organ of social change. In 1935 he abandoned freelancing and joined the BBC staff. An early Bridson programme, and the BBC's first verse feature, was <span class="italic">The March of the '45</span> (1936), an account of the Jacobite rising. It was broadcast eight times in the UK, overseas on BBC transcription service, and again on Radio 4 on 27 August 1989; it has been heard by an estimated audience of 100 million around the world. His radio output was prolific: in twenty-five years over 800 documentaries, plays, and feature programmes carried the imprint of D. G. Bridson. 400 had recorded repeats. Some, such as <span class="italic">Aaron's Field</span> (1939) and <span class="italic">Steel</span> (1937), became microphone classics. On 10 November 1934 he had married Vera (1909&#150;1963), the fabric designer daughter of Harry Richardson, an antiquarian bookseller. Twins, Hermione Cicely (<i>d</i>. 1987) and Gavin Douglas Ruthven, were born to them on 12 February 1936, but the marriage did not survive the war.<br>
<br>From 1939 to 1945 broadcasts to America about the British war effort occupied most of Bridson's time. He moved from Manchester to London in 1941 to become overseas features editor until 1943, when he crossed the Atlantic for the first time to act as guest producer with the New York office. Here he rapidly made friends with folk-singers such as Burl Ives and Alan Lomax, as well as Josh White and other black musicians leading the struggle against segregation. Much later he was to produce (with Langston Hughes) <span class="italic">The Negro in America</span> (1964), a series of nineteen separate shows broadcast on the Third Programme, which vividly recalled the developments of a dramatic decade.<br>
<br>After VE-day Bridson travelled the world widely for the BBC, including work as a guest writer and producer for the South African Broadcasting Corporation in 1947 and for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the New Zealand Broadcasting Service in 1948. Growing up before the cautious days of pre-recorded radio, he approached the developing technology of his profession with zest. He was the first British producer to exploit the use of magnetic tape recording, with equipment captured from the Germans in Norway.<br>
<br>Bridson's limited experience in television was less successful but he was the natural choice for BBC television to send as its adviser&#151;and indeed watch-dog&#151;for the American documentary series <span class="italic">The Valiant Years</span> based on Sir Winston Churchill's memoirs. The BBC had taken an option on the American series, but was profoundly depressed by the quality of the first scripts and considered cutting its losses. Bridson helped reshape the programmes into an acceptable and moreover popular series. This assignment, due to last six months, in fact kept Bridson in New York for a year. It followed immediately upon his second marriage, on 9 April 1960, to Joyce Thirlaway Rowe (1915/16&#150;1989), the BBC's first radio publicity officer. She was the daughter of Claude Harold Rowe, an antiques dealer in London who was a direct descendant of Nicholas Rowe, poet laureate. Her good nature tolerated the year-long separation with equanimity. Geoffrey and Joyce Bridson's Highgate home became a convivial London meeting place for poets, actors, and writers. Bridson was a short, neat man with red hair and an imperial beard; a courteous host and a witty raconteur. He loved books and collected them with discrimination. He had a well-stocked cellar and a well-stocked mind.<br>
<br>From 1964 to 1967 Bridson was programme editor for arts, sciences, and documentaries (sound). Much of the most distinguished writing of his career was produced for the Third Programme. Its transformation into Radio 3 made him unhappy, as did the eventual winding up of the once outstanding features department, of which he had become the assistant head. His autobiography, <span class="italic">Prospero and Ariel: the Rise and Fall of Radio. A Personal Recollection</span> (1971), reflected this malaise. Other publications by Bridson include <span class="italic">Aaron's Field</span> (1943); <span class="italic">The Christmas Child</span>, a collection of poems for reading aloud (1950); <span class="italic">The Quest of Gilgamesh</span> (1972); and <span class="italic">The Filibuster: a Study of the Political Ideas of Wyndham Lewis</span> (1972).<br>
<br>After Bridson retired from the BBC in May 1969 he adapted and dramatized French and English novels, which continued to be broadcast in the domestic and external services of the BBC long after he died of leukaemia at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, London, on 19 October 1980. His wife outlived him by nine years. In the memories of his contemporaries, many of Bridson's distinguished contributions to a largely ephemeral art similarly survived him.<br>
