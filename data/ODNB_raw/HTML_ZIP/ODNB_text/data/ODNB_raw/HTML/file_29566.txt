<span class="headword">Williams,  Zachariah <span class="st"> [Zachary]</span></span>  (1668<span class="mult">x</span>73&#150;1755), <span class="occ">experimental philosopher</span>, was born in Rosemarket, Pembrokeshire, to John Williams and his wife, Margaret. He was educated in medicine, and served as a medical practitioner in south Wales, where he remained until he moved to London in 1726 or 1727. It appears that at some point, probably during his residence in Rosemarket, he married Martha, with whom he had a daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29486/', "Anna Williams")</script>, in 1706. While in Wales he proposed operating a coalmine in Carmarthenshire, but the scheme came to nothing. Probably inspired by the rewards offered by the board of longitude set up in 1714, he developed a method for ascertaining longitude using a theoretically derived table of the earth's magnetic variation (declination), in which the angle between geographic north and the direction indicated by a compass needle was calculated for different points of the globe.<br>
<br>Williams's earliest friend in London was John Rowley, the instrument maker noted for his redesigned orrery. He also met with other influential figures, including Edmond Halley, J. T. Desaguliers, and William Whiston, and his magnetic globe was demonstrated before the Royal Society. Supported by a group of gentlemen subscribers hoping to be repaid by the board of longitude, he submitted his scheme to the Admiralty, which referred it to Sir Isaac Newton. The latter declined on account of his age and the proposal was sent to Samuel Molyneux, later accused by Williams of stealing his plan.<br>
<br>Despite this backing, Williams's ideas were rejected, and brought no financial reward. He was admitted on 29 September 1729 to the Charterhouse as a &#145;poor brother pensioner&#146;, on the nomination of Sir Robert Walpole. He was extremely friendly with the electrician Stephen Gray, also a member of the Charterhouse, and they exchanged information on magnetism and electricity. William Jones of Nayland, later a Hutchinsonian natural philosopher, was a schoolboy taught by Williams there. Williams continued experimenting, wrote long flattering letters to Admiral Vernon and General Oglethorpe soliciting their patronage, and printed his proposals at his own expense in 1740 and 1745.<br>
<br>From December 1745 Williams was bedridden, without a nurse, and cared for only by his nearly blind daughter, Anna. The whereabouts of Martha at this time are not known. Father and daughter both sent acrimonious letters to the governors complaining about the Charterhouse officials, against whom they voiced long-standing and partially justified complaints. An order for Williams's expulsion was given on 19 May 1748, one of his offences being that, against the rules, his daughter had lived with him at the Charterhouse for two years. On 23 May he was evicted, many of his possessions, including his mathematical instruments and books, damaged or lost.<br>
<br>After leaving the Charterhouse, Williams wrote to Samuel Johnson, who continually assisted him and Anna. Johnson studied Williams's theories on ascertaining longitude at sea magnetically, and compiled an account of his studies. This was published under Williams's name in 1755, together with an Italian translation which Johnson induced Giuseppe Baretti to make in order to give Williams's views a foreign circulation. Williams himself sent various letters to Admiral Anson and other Admiralty officials, who referred his appeals to James Bradley, the astronomer royal. Bradley examined Williams's magnetic globe and his tables but concluded that they were not sufficiently reliable to use at sea. Williams also invented a device for desalinating sea water to make it drinkable.<br>
<br>Although Johnson remained a loyal patron, many people were sceptical of Williams's claims; numerous longitude proposals during this period were mocked for their impracticality. His predictions of the earth's magnetic variation, which were based on an assumption of uniform change, initially tallied with observations but increasingly failed to match its complex fluctuations. Williams was marginalized by most of his contemporaries, and his work had little direct impact on projects to map terrestrial magnetism. In the past, historians were interested in him primarily because of his close relationship with Johnson, but more recently historians of science have increasingly valued the details of his activities for the insight they yield into projectors and communities outside formal institutions such as the Royal Society. Williams's life provides an unusually rich story representing the countless seekers after longitude money that have slipped into oblivion.<br>
<br>After an illness of eight months, Williams died on 12 July 1755. A few years later, Johnson presented a copy of the Italian version of Williams's investigations to the Bodleian Library. This copy included his handwritten comments on Williams's death and a printed newspaper obituary notice, obviously written by Johnson, in which the writer concluded that Williams was &#145;evidently worthy to have ended life with better fortune&#146;.<br>
