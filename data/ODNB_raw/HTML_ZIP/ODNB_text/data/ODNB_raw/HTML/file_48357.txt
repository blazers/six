<span class="headword">Vickers,  Thomas Edward <span class="st"> [Tom]</span></span>  (1833&#150;1915), <span class="occ">steel maker and armaments manufacturer</span>, was born on 9 July 1833 in Sheffield, the son of Edward Vickers (1804&#150;1897) and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Naylor. His brother, <a name="cosubject_48357"></a><span class="headword">Albert Vickers</span>  (1838&#150;1919)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 16 September 1838, also in Sheffield. Their father was a miller who had launched the Vickers' steelmaking dynasty in Sheffield in the 1820s; their mother was the daughter of a local steel maker. Tom attended Sheffield collegiate school and then received technical training in Germany, at Neuwied am Rhein; Albert was educated privately in Sheffield and then studied at Hameln an der Weser, Germany.<br>
<br>Tom (usually known as Colonel Tom because of his association with the local militia) had joined the business by the age of twenty-one. By then the family firm, known as Naylor Vickers, was one of the leading crucible steel makers in Sheffield, and Edward had firmly established the Vickers' name in the town's commercial and political life: he had served as the town's alderman and mayor, and was the first president of the Sheffield chamber of commerce. His sons did not maintain this involvement, but they were to take the family firm to new heights.<br>
<br>In 1860 Tom Vickers married Frances Mary Douglas (1841&#150;1904), the only child of Joseph Douglas, a London surgeon; they had two sons and four daughters. For many years the family resided at Bolsover Hill, a large house on high ground to the north of Sheffield, where they lived a life of unostentatious luxury surrounded by eight servants. Later they moved to London, where Tom indulged his taste for ceramic art and frequented the leading chess clubs. In 1861 Albert Vickers married Helen Horton George (<i>d</i>. 1873) of Boston, Massachusetts; they had three children. After her death he married, in 1875, Edith Foster (<i>d</i>. 1909), daughter of John Foster of Maltby, near Sheffield; they had a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Tom Vickers's arrival at Naylor Vickers coincided with a period of frenzied activity, as the firm shared in the heyday of the crucible steel trade. It rapidly outgrew its old site in Millsands and, beginning in 1863, under Vickers's direction, steelmaking activity was transferred to the River Don works in the Brightside district of Sheffield. Utilizing German technology, he pioneered the manufacture of steel castings, still using the crucible process to produce cast-steel bells and railway wheels. The success of the business owed much to his leadership in the foundry, where he acquired a reputation as a tough individual who never knew when he was beaten. He was known to sleep at the works, when the occasion demanded. A series of patents dealing with the production of steel castings, particularly cast-steel tyres, and a paper read before the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1861, &#145;On the strength of steel containing different proportions of carbon&#146;, testified to his technical prowess. His innovations placed Naylor Vickers at the forefront of world steel making, and only German firms such as Krupp could compete in size or technology.<br>
<br>In 1867 the firm was incorporated as Vickers, Sons &amp; Co. Ltd, with a capital of &pound;155,000 split equally between the Vickers brothers and Ernst Benzon, their American agent, who became chairman until Tom Vickers succeeded him in 1873. The business then employed about a thousand men, ranking the firm third in Sheffield behind Charles Cammells and John Browns. By then Albert Vickers was also playing a significant part in the business. He had joined the firm in 1854, gaining experience in the American market, which he was to visit thirty-four times. The brothers complemented each other: Tom was the technologist, and Albert the salesman and strategist. Although equally autocratic by nature, Albert did not have Tom's technical knowledge, but was more daring and speculative, with the courage to back his business convictions. Handsome, commanding, having an easy way with customers, and familiar with other countries and their languages, &#145;Don Alberto&#146;, as he was sometimes known, was the perfect foil for his taciturn brother.<br>
<br>Vickers was rather slower to commit itself fully to the arms business than its rivals Browns, Cammells, and Firths. But by the late 1880s a fall in profits led to a marked shift towards the arms sector, which gathered pace towards 1900. In 1897 the Maxim Gun Company was acquired for &pound;1.3 million, and in the same year the Naval Construction and Armaments Company was bought at the bargain price of &pound;425,000. Four years later Vickers absorbed Wolseley cars, partly with an eye to manufacturing military vehicles. In 1902 Vickers again extended its empire to include a half-share in William Beardmore &amp; Co., the Glasgow-based armour-plate and warship makers, and in 1906 a similar-sized holding in Whitehead &amp; Co., the torpedo makers of Weymouth and Fiume, Croatia. After 1900 Vickers also developed an interest in submarine and aircraft manufacture and began creating foreign subsidiaries or holding companies in Spain, Italy, Japan, Russia, and Turkey. Vickers, Sons and Maxim, as it became known, was then in the unique position of being able not only to build a battleship but also to equip her with engines, fit her with armour, provide the necessary guns and shells, and, in fact, launch her from Barrow in Furness ready for immediate service. &#145;All this we can do without outside help&#146;, stated Tom Vickers  (<span class="italic">Sheffield Daily Telegraph</span>, 20 Oct 1915). Significantly, by then the firm's head office had shifted to London. The brothers had turned the company into an integrated, though diverse, arms conglomerate, which vied with W. G. Armstrong as Britain's leading arsenal.<br>
<br>In 1909 Tom Vickers resigned as chairman, handing over to Albert, who held the post until 1918. By 1914 Vickers' issued share capital was almost &pound;6 million, its workforce in the UK was 22,000, and its average annual profits since 1897 had been &pound;589,391. Its growth continued unchecked during the First World War, when its products&#151;battleships, naval guns, machine-guns, torpedoes, aircraft, and submarines&#151;could be found in every theatre of war. By 1919 the company's &pound;20 million issued capital meant that only Coats, Lever Brothers, and Imperial Tobacco surpassed it in capital size as a British industrial firm&#151;though this was not entirely welcome to the old family members, who recognized that the company could no longer be under such close personal control. By the customary measures of business success, Tom and Albert Vickers had presided over a period of continuous growth; on the other hand, they might be criticized for becoming over-committed to armaments, which left Vickers with a legacy of problems which were to come home to roost when arms orders evaporated in the 1920s.<br>
<br>In his later years Tom Vickers was an aloof and patriarchal, though greatly respected, figure, who was used to deferential treatment from his shareholders, who<blockquote>soon came to realise that curiosity was a folly which could not be indulged in pleasantly while this man of iron occupied the chair. In time the enquiring shareholder became as extinct as the Dodo, and the annual meeting of Messrs Vickers was concentrated into a kind of lightning episode &hellip; [of] four or five minutes. (<span class="italic">Sheffield Daily Telegraph</span>, 20 Oct 1915)</blockquote>The River Don works was his absorbing passion and he continued to visit it until only a few months before his death, when he was wheeled around it in a bath chair. His technical achievements were recognized by the Howard Quinquennial prize from the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1907. Outside business, both Tom and Albert Vickers shunned publicity and disliked being photographed. Apart from chess, and a little shooting and fishing, Tom's only passion was drilling the Hallamshire volunteers, of which he was commanding officer from 1871 to 1899. A staunch Conservative, he also served as a magistrate, and as master cutler in 1872, and was created CB, civil division, in 1898. Albert's influence as armourer&#150;statesman is evidenced by the award of several foreign decorations, such as the order of the Rising Sun in Japan.<br>
<br>Tom Vickers died at his home, 12 Stanhope Place, Hyde Park, London, on 19 October 1915 and was cremated at Golders Green, Middlesex. Albert Vickers died at Compton Place, Eastbourne, Sussex, on 12 July 1919 and was buried at Hascombe church, Surrey.<br>
