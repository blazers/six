<span class="headword">Constable, Sir  Marmaduke</span>  (1456/7?&#150;1518), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61158/', "Sir Robert Constable (1423&#150;1488)")</script> of Flamborough, Yorkshire [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52782/', "Constable family (per. c.1300&#150;1488)")</script>], and Agnes, daughter of Sir Roger Wentworth of North Elmsall, Yorkshire, and Margery, dowager Lady Ros. Marmaduke is described as aged thirty-one and more at his father's death in May 1488, which would give a birth date of 1456 or 1457. This fits the circumstances of his career better than the claim in his epitaph in Flamborough church that he was aged seventy when he fought at Flodden (1513), which would push his birth date back by over a decade. Unlike their kinsmen of Barnby by Bossall, who were Neville associates, the Flamborough Constables followed the Percys. Sir Robert transferred readily to the service of Edward IV in 1461, but father and son were both retained by Henry Percy, fourth earl of Northumberland, after his restoration in 1470 and shared the stewardship of his lands in the East Riding. Marmaduke served under the earl in the Scottish campaigns of the early 1480s and was knighted by him beside Berwick in August 1481. According to his epitaph he had earlier gone with Edward IV into France, presumably in Northumberland's contingent.<br>
<br>Constable then entered the service of Richard III. He was a knight of the body by December 1483, when he was one of the king's associates given forfeited land and office in Kent in the aftermath of Buckingham's rebellion. Constable's Kentish base was to be the Stafford honour of Tonbridge, where he was made steward in December 1483 and where the inhabitants were informed in January that the king had deputed him &#145;to make his abode among you&#146;  (BL, Harl. MS 4332, fol. 81). However, the king had second thoughts about where Constable would be most useful and on 28 March granted him all the major duchy of Lancaster offices in the north midlands, including the constableship of Tutbury, which became his base. Unlike his predecessor in the offices, William, Lord Hastings, Constable was explicitly forbidden to retain the local gentry and was evidently intended to act under stricter royal control than Hastings, to whom Edward had allowed great independence of action.<br>
<br>It is not clear whether Constable fought at Bosworth. Perhaps, like Northumberland, he was present without fighting. He certainly escaped attainder, and was pardoned on 18 November. By May 1486, when he was granted the stewardships of Bawtry and Hotham, Yorkshire, he was again a knight of the body. He succeeded his father in May 1488, having formerly held Holme on Spalding moor, Yorkshire, and Somerby, Lincolnshire, which his father had settled on him. In November 1488 he became sheriff of Yorkshire and thus played a major role in dealing with the unrest of 1489 in which the earl of Northumberland was killed. In 1492 he accompanied the king to France and was involved in the ensuing negotiations which led to the treaty of &Eacute;taples. It seems that after Northumberland's death Constable became associated with Thomas Howard, earl of Surrey, who was taking an increasing role in northern affairs. In 1509 Surrey nominated him as a knight of the Garter, although he was not elected. In 1513 Constable served under Howard at Flodden, where he commanded the left wing; he received a letter of thanks from the king.<br>
<br>Constable died on 20 November 1518. His will, made the previous May, requested that he be buried as soon as his body was cold, &#145;without calling of friends or any other solemnity&#146;  (Raine, 91). He had married twice. With his first wife, Margery, daughter of William, Lord Fitzhugh, Constable had no children. With his second wife, Joyce, the daughter of Humphrey Stafford of Grafton, he had four sons (Robert, who succeeded him, Marmaduke, William, and John) and two daughters. His second son, <a name="cosubject_6109"></a><span class="headword">Sir Marmaduke Constable</span>  (<em>c.</em>1480&#150;1545), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, married Barbara, daughter of Sir John Sotehill of Everingham, by November 1502, the year in which the Sotehill lands were divided between her and her sister Mary, the wife of John Normanville, after the death of their imbecile brother, George. Constable fought under his father at Flodden and was knighted on the battlefield. He fought in several later Scottish campaigns, accompanied Henry VIII to the Field of Cloth of Gold and was a knight of the body by 1533. Unlike his elder brother Robert he did not support the Pilgrimage of Grace and his share of the spoils of the dissolution was Drax Priory, founded by his wife's ancestors. He died on 14 September 1545; his wife had died on 4 October 1540.<br>
