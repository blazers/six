<span class="headword">Willock,  Henry Davis</span>  (1830&#150;1903), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was born on 25 December 1830, at the palace of Abbas Mirza, prince royal of Persia, at Oujan, Persia, the third child of Sir Henry Willock (1788&#150;1858) of the Madras cavalry, who accompanied Sir Harford Jones-Brydges on his mission to Persia as interpreter and who, at the time of Henry's birth, was resident at the court of Tehran. Henry's mother was Elizabeth, eighth child of Samuel Davis, a former judge of Benares celebrated in Anglo-Indian annals for the defence of his house on 14 January 1799 against the attack of the deposed nawab of Oudh. Another of Samuel Davis's children was Sir John Francis Davis, British plenipotentiary in China. Willock was educated at Kensington proprietary school and at East India College, Haileybury (1851&#150;2). He sailed for India in December 1852 and joined Fort William College, Calcutta, for the usual course of instruction in Indian languages. At the end of 1853 he was posted to Mathura in the North-Western Provinces as assistant magistrate and collector.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the Indian mutiny in May 1857 Willock was joint magistrate of Allahabad. Holed up in the fort with the other Europeans, he commanded a company of volunteers until the arrival of a relief force commanded by General James Neill and then served under Neill at the storming and capture of Kydganj. At the end of June he volunteered to be civil officer with the &#145;forlorn hope force&#146; organized for the relief of Cawnpore and commanded by Major Renaud. The Cawnpore garrison fell before Renaud could reach them but Willock stayed on to serve under Sir Henry Havelock, fighting in the actions of Fatehpur, Pandu Nadi, Maharajpur, and finally, on 17 July, Cawnpore. He was one of the first Europeans to enter the <i>bibigarh</i>, scene of the massacre of about 200 British women and children, which was to become for the British public the most poignant and distressing image of the uprising.<br>
<br>At the end of July, thrilling to the promised glory of lifting a siege, Willock marched to the relief of Lucknow. He accompanied Havelock on his two unsuccessful advances to the city, was with Outram and Havelock when they fought their way into the residency on 25 September, and thus became a member of the defending garrison until the final relief by Sir Colin Campbell on 19 November. A letter to his parents detailing these events was published in <span class="italic">The Times</span> on 1 February 1858; it is a candid and engaging description of the fear, exhilaration, and boredom experienced by a young man at war. After the relief of Lucknow, Willock helped escort the women and children from the residency to safety at Allahabad and then, in early 1858, joined Maxwell's movable column watching the banks of the Jumna in the Cawnpore and Etawah districts. He was at the capture of Kalpi by Sir Hugh Rose's central India force in May, and in July joined Berkeley's movable column at Suraon as civil officer and took part in the capture of the forts of Dahain and Tirul in southern Oudh. He thus participated in the suppression of the uprising from first to last. He was the only civilian to receive the medal with the three clasps for the relief of Lucknow, Lucknow 1858, and central India. He was also favoured with a letter of thanks from Queen Victoria. General Sir Mowbray Thomson, last survivor of the Cawnpore entrenchment, wrote that Willock's &#145;feats of arms were patent to all the force, who asserted that he had mistaken his profession and ought without doubt to have been a soldier&#146;  (M. Thomson, <span class="italic">The Story of Cawnpore</span>, 1859, 253).<br>
<br>In November 1858 Willock was appointed joint magistrate of Shahjahanpur. In 1859 he returned to Britain on furlough, and in the same year, on 27 October, at Barnes, Surrey, married his cousin Mary Elizabeth, only child of Major Charles L. Boileau of the rifle brigade. In 1860 with his wife he returned to Shahjahanpur, where three of their four children were born. In November 1876, after several intermediate appointments in Bareilly and Bulandshahr, he was appointed magistrate and shortly afterwards judge of Azamgarh, in which position he remained until his retirement in April 1884. He was for some years a major in the Ghazipur volunteer rifles.<br>
<br>After his retirement Willock lived first at Brighton and then at Tunbridge Wells. In 1902 he published for private circulation a memoir of his career in India entitled <span class="italic">Notes on the Willock Family</span>. He died on 26 April 1903 at his home, Western House, Tunbridge Wells, and was buried at Little Bookham, Surrey. In 1906 his elder son, Henry Court, took the additional name of Pollen on succeeding to the manor of Little Bookham.<br>
