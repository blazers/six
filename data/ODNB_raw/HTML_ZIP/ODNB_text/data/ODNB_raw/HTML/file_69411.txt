<span class="headword">Middleton,  George Humphrey</span>  (1910&#150;1998), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 21 January 1910 at 47b Welbeck Street, Marylebone, London, the son of George Close Middleton, insurance broker and banker, and his wife, Susan Sophie, formerly Elphinstone, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harley. He spent much of his boyhood in Paris, where his father was chief representative of Lloyds Bank. He went to school at St Lawrence College, Ramsgate, and read French (in which he was bilingual) and Spanish at Magdalen College, Oxford, graduating with a third-class degree in 1931. He then spent a year in Heidelberg, learning German.<br>
<br>Middleton entered the consular service in 1933, serving initially as vice-consul in Buenos Aires (1933&#150;4). While there he married, on 29 October 1934, Elizabeth Rosalie Okeden (Tina) Pockley, detective novelist (as Elizabeth Antill), and daughter of Harry Pockley, of Roma Downs, Roma, Queensland, Australia. There were no children of the marriage. Middleton then filled vice-consular posts in Asuncion (1934&#150;6), New York (1936&#150;9), Lemberg (1939), Cluj (1939&#150;40), Genoa (1940), and Madeira (1940&#150;43). There followed a short spell in the Foreign Office before he was transferred to Washington as second secretary in 1944. He was promoted first secretary there in 1945. This service in Washington marked him out for higher things.<br>
<br>In 1947, by which time the consular and diplomatic services had been amalgamated in the foreign service, Middleton was appointed assistant head of the personnel department in the Foreign Office. He became head of that department in 1949, with promotion to counsellor. With the post-war reconstruction examinations in process to fill the gaps left by an absence of regular recruitment during the war, this was a post of considerable importance, which Middleton filled admirably. One of his achievements was to secure cancellation of the unkind and pointless ban on the adoption of children by foreign service officers. He also inaugurated a far-sighted policy of appointing senior ex-consular officers to a spell of duty in the Foreign Office, to contribute to the unification of the service. He was made a CMG in 1950.<br>
<br>In 1951 Middleton was transferred to Tehran as counsellor, and there had to cope with the problem of the nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company by Prime Minister Mossadeq. With the ambassador withdrawn, he became charg&eacute; d'affaires from 28 January 1952 to 31 October 1952, when the staff of the embassy was expelled, with Middleton organizing a cross-desert convoy via Baghdad and Damascus to Beirut. He next served, on secondment to the Commonwealth Relations Office, as deputy high commissioner in New Delhi from 1953 to 1956, a well-earned promotion. It was followed by his appointment as ambassador to the Lebanon, the first of his posts in the Arab world. There, using his fluent French (he was not an Arabist), he had to cope with the virulent anti-British riots that followed the ill-fated British invasion of Port Said in the Suez campaign. He was made a KCMG in the new year's honours list of 1958.<br>
<br>Further promotion followed when Middleton was made political resident in the Persian Gulf in 1958. This was an important post, supervising British relations with all the sheikhdoms in the Persian Gulf and with the sultanate of Oman. It fell to Middleton on 19 June 1961 to sign the treaty recognizing the independence of Kuwait, by now a major oil producer with growing investments in the City of London. This event stimulated an Iraqi claim to sovereignty over Kuwait, and in early July 1961 Middleton had to mastermind the landing of British forces in Kuwait to ward off an Iraqi invasion.<br>
<br>This success marked the end of Middleton's service in the Persian Gulf. He returned to Buenos Aires as ambassador to Argentina from 1961 to 1964. He then served in the senior Arab post, Cairo, as ambassador to the United Arab Republic from 1964 to 1966, when he was expelled on the breach of diplomatic relations in a widespread African protest at British policy towards Ian Smith's unilateral declaration of independence in Rhodesia. He was appointed briefly to the <i>ad hoc</i> committee on United Nations finances but retired early from the foreign service in 1966.<br>
<br>Middleton's marriage had been in trouble towards the end of his foreign service career. He was divorced on 1 November 1971 and on 10 November that year he married Marie Elizabeth Camille Fran&ccedil;oise Middleton, who had also been divorced. She was the daughter of George Sarthou, medical practitioner; she had changed her name to Middleton by deed poll before the marriage. With her Middleton had a son, George Alexander, to add to a stepson and a stepdaughter.<br>
<br>Middleton was in demand after his retirement in a variety of commercial and industrial posts. These included consultant in the Industrial Reorganization Corporation (1967&#150;8), and directorships of Overseas Medical Supplies Ltd, Britarge Ltd, and D&eacute;cor France Ltd. He was chairman of the executive committee of the British Road Federation in 1972, and chief executive of the British Industry Roads Campaign from 1969 to 1976. Towards the end of his life he chaired Mondial Expatriate Services Ltd, from 1988 to 1991. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. He also chaired the Bahrain Society, the Anglo-Peruvian society, and the British Moroccan Society. He was made a commander of the order of merit of Peru and a chevalier of the Lebanon's national order of the Cedar. In his last years he suffered from cancer of the colon. He died at his home, 1 Carlyle Square, Chelsea, London, on 12 February 1998, and was survived by his wife, son, and two stepchildren.<br>
