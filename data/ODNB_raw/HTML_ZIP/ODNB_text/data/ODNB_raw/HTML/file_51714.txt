<span class="headword">Swinnerton,  Henry Hurd</span>  (1875&#150;1966), <span class="occ">zoologist and geologist</span>, was born at Bungay, Suffolk, on 17 September 1875, the son of the Revd George Frederick Swinnerton, a Wesleyan Methodist minister, and his wife, Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith). The family moved about Britain because of the father's ministry, and Swinnerton acquired a good knowledge of the countryside. He matriculated in 1894, after attending Woodhouse Grove School, Airedale, Yorkshire, and Kingswood School, Bath.<br>
<br>Swinnerton became an assistant master at a boarding-school in Trowbridge (<i>c</i>.1894) but continued his studies through the university correspondence course and by regular visits to the Bristol City Museum. Encouraged by the curator, Edward Wilson, and by his course tutor, Dr Morley Davies, he was awarded a studentship at the Royal College of Science, University of London (1897). He graduated in zoology (1898) and then served as personal assistant to Professor G. B. Howes working on the New Zealand tuatara lizard <i>Sphenodon</i>. With typical ingenuity, he placed a dozen eggs in damp sand beneath the heating pipes of the laboratory and hatched the first <i>Sphenodon</i> in Europe. In 1902 Swinnerton was awarded a DSc following the completion of research on the cranium of the stickleback, which he had carried out while serving as a master at his old school in Bath. He married Florence Daisy Bennett, daughter of Joseph Bennett, postmaster, on 6 September 1906, and they had three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1901&#150;2 Swinnerton was appointed lecturer in natural sciences at University College, Nottingham. During his subsequent forty-four years in the college he established the departments of natural science (1902) and geology and geography (1912), as well as laying the foundation for a department of archaeology. His interpretation of fossils as living organisms contributed to a better understanding of palaeoecology and evolution. He had enormous ability as a lecturer, was noted for his enthusiasm for field studies and also for his broad, philosophical attitude to science  (Hawkins, 43), and was responsible for the introduction of visual aids into the lecture room  (Marren, 265), but his real pleasure was to be &#145;out in the field with his hammer &hellip; discovering the meaning of all things natural&#146;  (Evans, 1968, 344).<br>
<br>In 1942 Swinnerton was presented with the Murchison medal by the Geological Society in recognition of his extensive output in a wide range of zoological and geological subjects. He served as president of the Lincolnshire Naturalists' Union in 1936&#150;7, of section C of the British Association in 1938, and of the Geological Society in 1939&#150;40. In 1950 he was made a CBE for his services to university education. In addition to his professional and civic services in connection with young people, Swinnerton was an active member of the Methodist church. He retired as professor emeritus in 1946 and then briefly served as curator of the Margidinum collection of Roman antiquities before moving to Hertfordshire. He died at his residence, the headmaster's house, Haberdashers' Aske's School, Elstree, on 6 November 1966.<br>
