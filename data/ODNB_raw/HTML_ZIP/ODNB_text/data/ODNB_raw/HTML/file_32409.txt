<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Christie, Sir  William Henry Mahoney</span>  (1845&#150;1922), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, was born on 1 October 1845 at Woolwich, the eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5364/', "Samuel Hunter Christie (1784&#150;1865)")</script>, professor of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and his second wife, Margaret Ellen Malcolm (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1822), the daughter of James Mahoney of Killarney. (There were children from the first marriage, one of whom, James Robert Christie, also joined the staff of the Royal Military Academy.)<br>
<br>Christie was educated at King's College School, London, and went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1864. He became a scholar in 1866, and two years later was placed fourth wrangler in the mathematical tripos. He was elected a fellow of his college in 1869. He had tried for the Sheepshanks exhibition in 1866 and, though he was unsuccessful, one of the examiners, George B. Airy, the astronomer royal, who had known his father well, was impressed by his knowledge of practical astronomy. When the post of chief assistant at the Royal Greenwich Observatory became vacant in 1870, Airy offered it to Christie, who accepted.<br>
<br>Under Airy, the main efforts of the Greenwich observatory were concentrated on the accurate positional measurement of celestial objects. Christie observed with the transit circle and the altazimuth instrument, suggesting some useful modifications to the former, and he also worked on calculations relating to positional measurements of stars. However, it soon became apparent that Christie's real interest lay in the newly developing science of astrophysics. Airy had not considered such studies to be appropriate to the work of the observatory. Christie, with the encouragement of such leaders in the new science as Warren De La Rue and William Huggins, now persuaded him to initiate a small programme of astrophysical observations at Greenwich. The most important of these were observations of the sun's surface. In the 1860s photographs of the sun's disc had been taken at the observatory at Kew using a photoheliograph devised by De La Rue. This and other similar instruments were bought by the Greenwich observatory; E. W. Maunder began making daily photographs of the sun and using them to obtain information about sunspots.<br>
<br>When Airy retired in 1881, after forty-six years in the post, his position was first offered to the eminent theoretical astronomer J. C. Adams, who declined it. It was then offered to Christie. On his acceptance, he became the eighth astronomer royal. That same year Christie married Violette Mary (<i>d</i>. 1888), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48625/', "Sir Alfred Hickman")</script>, a prominent iron manufacturer and MP for Wolverhampton. They had two sons, the younger of whom died in childhood. The elder son became a barrister, and lived with his father.<h2>
<a name="Astronomerroyal"></a>Astronomer royal</h2>By the end of Airy's long reign the Greenwich observatory was physically in a poor condition. In addition, the observatory's expanding workload was leading to a growing shortage of space. Christie proved to be very successful in persuading the Admiralty to provide funds for new buildings, even hinting that it might become necessary to cease distributing time signals unless more accommodation became available. His refurbishment extended beyond buildings to their contents, where he had identified problems during his period as chief assistant. These changes were paralleled by an increase in the number of staff: by the end of the nineteenth century the observatory's establishment had doubled to about fifty.<br>
<br>Christie also realized the urgent need for updating the observing equipment. He was generally less skilled than Airy in the design of instrumentation&#151;apart from those for astrophysics&#151;but his observing experience allowed him to identify difficulties that Airy, a non-observer, might not always have recognized. Christie decided that the first major new item of equipment should be a large (by contemporary standards) telescope to try and keep up with current trends in astronomical research. Consequently, in 1885, the existing 13 inch telescope was replaced by a 28 inch refractor, on the same mounting, to Christie's design. With it he initiated a programme for the observation of visual double stars. The existing dome was too small for the new telescope, so it was replaced in 1893 by a new onion-shaped dome, which soon became a distinctive feature of the Greenwich skyline. In 1887 an international conference in Paris agreed to launch a co-ordinated mapping exercise&#151;the <i>Carte du ciel</i> project&#151;for photographing the whole sky and determining stellar positions and magnitudes. Christie, who had attended the conference, arranged for a 13 inch astrographic telescope to be installed at Greenwich in 1890, enabling the observatory to participate in the project.<br>
<br>The most important building change was linked to Christie's astrophysical interests. A new physical observatory, containing offices and workshops as well as telescopes, was constructed during the 1890s. In 1894 Sir Henry Thompson, an eminent surgeon with a great interest in astronomy, offered to donate &pound;5000 for a 26 inch refracting telescope. He later agreed to pay for a 30 inch reflecting telescope as well. The two telescopes were attached to the same mounting and installed in a dome in the new building. The other major change, at the end of the century, related to geomagnetic measurements. A new site&#151;the Christie enclosure&#151;was created for the magnetic instruments in Greenwich Park at some distance from the observatory, so as to decrease the disturbing effects of the magnetic materials in the new buildings.<br>
<br>Christie introduced relatively few changes into the programme of positional measurements that Airy had developed, though he pursued the long-standing problem of the personal errors of the observers. A new altazimuth to Christie's design was installed during the 1890s, but it was found to suffer from flexure. The most important problems, however, related to the changing environment of the observatory. A forerunner of these difficulties in the 1890s was the decision to discontinue observations of earth currents because of the hindrance caused by passing electric trains. Then, in the early 1900s, an electricity generating station was built right on the Greenwich meridian, where many positional observations were made. This affected observing conditions not only directly via the discharge of hot air and soot, but also indirectly via ground vibration. By this time the Greenwich meridian was of international importance. Until the 1880s numerous standard times existed in different parts of the world. Discussions during that decade, which necessarily included Christie, led to agreement that Greenwich should become the zero meridian for the measurement of longitude, and that, correspondingly, Greenwich Mean Time should become the standard for time measurement.<br>
<br>Christie did very little observing after becoming astronomer royal, but he made an exception for solar eclipses. His particular interest was in obtaining direct photographs of the solar corona. His first attempt, at the 1896 eclipse which he observed from Japan, was clouded out, but his expeditions to observe the next three eclipses were more successful. He enjoyed travelling abroad. Yachting was a favourite occupation, and in the latter years of his life he spent part of each winter in a warmer climate.<br>
<br>Christie's importance for astronomy lay less in his personal research than in the way he transformed the Greenwich observatory from a highly conservative establishment to one well attuned to the new world of science. He also established the widely read magazine <span class="italic">The Observatory</span>, and was its first editor. Though rather reserved by nature, he was an affable man who enjoyed company. He was a friend of the prince of Wales (later Edward VII). Christie was elected to the Royal Society in 1881, and served three times on its council. He was also an influential member of the Royal Astronomical Society, being its president in 1888&#150;90. Foreign learned societies bestowed various honours on him, and Oxford University awarded him an honorary degree. He became the first astronomer royal to act as master of the Clockmakers' Company. He was knighted in 1904. Christie was the first astronomer royal to follow civil service requirements and retire at the age of sixty-five, in 1910. He moved initially to Warlingham in Surrey, and then to Downe in Kent, but continued to make trips abroad. Early in 1922 he set out on a cruise to Morocco. On 22 January he suffered a gastric haemorrhage and died. He was buried at sea near Gibraltar on the following day.<br>
