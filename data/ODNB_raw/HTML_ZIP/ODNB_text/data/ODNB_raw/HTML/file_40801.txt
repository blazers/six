</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Baldwin,  Alfred</span>  (1841&#150;1908), <span class="occ">industrialist and politician</span>, was born at Stourport, Worcestershire, on 4 June 1841, the youngest of twelve children of George Pearce Baldwin (1789&#150;1840), a small-scale iron founder and businessman, and his second wife, Sarah Chalkley Stanley (1801&#150;1874), the eldest daughter of the Revd Jacob Stanley, a distinguished Wesleyan Methodist minister who was president of the Methodist conference in 1845. Alfred's father died eight months prior to his birth, and he was brought up by his mother.<br>
<br>After being educated at the Wesleyan Collegiate Institution at Taunton, Baldwin, at the age of sixteen, became a partner in the main family firm, Baldwin, Son &amp; Co. of Stourport. By the 1860s this was a relatively big firm, making ironwork of all kinds, and there were worsted spinning mills at Stourport, a carpet manufactory at Bridgnorth, and a tin-plate works at Wolverhampton. On 9 August 1866, at Wolverhampton parish church, Baldwin married Louisa Macdonald (1845&#150;1925) [<i>see </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/58274">Baldwin,  Louisa</a>, <i>under</i> <a target="_top" href="/view/article/76071">Macdonald sisters  (<em>act. </em>1837&#150;1925)</a>], one of the famous daughters of the Revd George Browne Macdonald, a Wesleyan minister, and his second wife, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jones. Louisa's eldest sister Alice was the mother of Rudyard Kipling; the second, Georgiana, married Edward Burne-Jones, and the next, Agnes, married Edward Poynter. The Baldwins had only one child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30550/', "Stanley Baldwin")</script>, who succeeded his father as MP for Bewdley and later became prime minister. A devout woman obsessed with death, Louisa Baldwin developed during her pregnancy a prolonged and never fully diagnosed illness; over the next sixteen years she spent much time at continental spas. Alfred Baldwin bought Lower Park, Bewdley, as his family residence.<br>
<br>In the 1860s the family business was split, with Baldwin assisting in running the operations of E. P. and W. Baldwin Ltd at the Wilden forge. Following a financial crisis and the death of certain members of the family in the late 1860s, Alfred bought out the remaining partners and secured control in September 1870. He moved to Wilden House overlooking the forge. Responsible for a rapid growth of the firm, he soon established a reputation as a benevolent employer and as a patriarch of the Wilden district. On the former count, by 1890 he had introduced a works medical service, a friendly society, a scheme for the encouragement of the education of workers' children, and the maintenance of high standards of safety and cleanliness, and on the latter he was responsible for the building of a school, a church (with stained glass by Burne-Jones), and a vicarage at Wilden.<br>
<br>During the 1870s and 1880s Baldwin's horizons began to expand. In 1873 the Swindon tin-plate works near Dudley was acquired and in 1886 a separate company, Alfred Baldwin &amp; Co. Ltd, was established to erect and operate a tin-plate works near Pontypool, Monmouthshire. Further developments in the Pontypool region followed in 1892, when the Pont-y-moel tin-plate works was restarted in conjunction with Wright, Butler &amp; Co. The links with this concern, and the business relationship between Baldwin and Colonel Roper Wright, led to a fusion of their business interests.<br>
<br>On 7 April 1902 the various interests of the two parties were brought together under unified control through the formation of Baldwins Ltd. Baldwin became chairman and his only son, Stanley, and Colonel Wright were among the original directors of the company. Following Baldwin's death in 1908, Colonel Wright succeeded him as chairman and Stanley became second in command. At the time of its formation Baldwins took over five concerns: E. P. and W. Baldwin Ltd; Wright, Butler &amp; Co.; the Bryn Navigation Colliery Ltd; Alfred Baldwin &amp; Co. Ltd; and the Blackwall Galvanised Iron Company Ltd. Baldwins Ltd was to become one of the giants of the British steel industry in the first half of the twentieth century, particularly following the acquisition and re-opening of the Port Talbot steel works, Glamorgan, in 1906.<br>
<br>Although his business interests were concentrated on iron, steel, and tin-plate manufacture, Baldwin also played a much wider role through directorships of a number of other concerns. Most notable among these were those of the Great Western Railway and the Metropolitan Bank (of England and Wales). At the former he was unanimously elected chairman in March 1905 following the resignation of F. A. V. Campbell, third earl of Cawdor (1847&#150;1911), on taking up the post of first lord of the Admiralty, while at the latter, under his chairmanship from 1896, the bank was transformed from a local Birmingham bank into a successful national one.<br>
<br>While the centre of Baldwin's business interests gradually moved away from the midlands, most notably into south Wales, at the time of his death he could still be described as ranking as &#145;one of the commercial kings of the Metropolis of the Midlands&#146;  (<span class="italic">Western Mail</span>). As befitted somebody with a strong yeoman background, and living for much of his married life at Wilden House, Baldwin also played a significant role in local affairs. By the end of the nineteenth century he had been made a JP for both Staffordshire and Worcestershire, and a deputy lieutenant for Worcestershire.<br>
<br>Although having been raised as a Wesleyan, Baldwin had become a high Anglican by his mid-twenties. A widely and deeply read man, he was an ardent believer in the strenuous life and devoted himself wholly to commerce and politics. In 1892 he entered parliament, unopposed, as the Unionist member for Bewdley (West Worcestershire). He was re-elected, again unopposed, in 1895 and 1900, and represented the constituency until his death. Although he rarely spoke in parliament, he was an ardent supporter of Joseph Chamberlain's tariff reform policy, and an equally vehement opponent of home rule for Ireland, of the disestablishment of the Church of England, and of local option in abolishing public houses. While his responsibilities as an MP meant spending time in London, he disliked the vulgarity of life in the capital. Alfred Baldwin died suddenly of cardiac failure on 13 February 1908, having returned home to Kensington Palace Mansions, De Vere Gardens, London, after a board meeting of the Great Western Railway.<br>
