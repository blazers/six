<span class="headword">Ede,  Harold Stanley <span class="st"> [Jim]</span></span>  (1895&#150;1990), <span class="occ">museum curator and art collector</span>, was born on 7 April 1895 in Penarth, Glamorgan, the younger son and second of three children of Edward Hornby Ede (1862&#150;1940), solicitor, of Penarth, and his wife, Mildred Mary Furley (1866&#150;1953), sometime schoolteacher, only daughter of Joseph Blanch, Methodist minister. At the Leys School, Cambridge (1909&#150;12), where he began a lifelong friendship with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38140/', "Donald Winnicott")</script>, he developed an interest in early Italian art which had burgeoned on a trip to Paris as a fourteen-year-old. He retained this passion throughout his life, and in 1926 published <span class="italic">Florentine Drawings of the Quattrocento</span>.<br>
<br>Ede was a somewhat rebellious child who enjoyed reverie and nature rather than academic discipline. In his unpublished memoir he described himself as an effeminate young man. As he grew older he placed particular value on male friendships. However, he enjoyed the company of his maternal grandmother and of his aunt Maud, a painter whom he visited in Paris. He gained a passion for reading from his mother and his father was a bibliophile.<br>
<br>Leaving the Leys early Ede began to train as a painter at Newlyn and then Edinburgh College of Art before war service interrupted his studies. In 1914 he joined the 6th battalion (pioneers) of the South Wales Borderers. He served as a lieutenant in France, was invalided back, and was posted to Cambridge (officer cadet battalion), and then India, where he suffered serious illness for several months. He returned via Alexandria, which he described as the first place in which he felt at home. Earlier generations of his family had lived around the Mediterranean.<br>
<br>In 1919 Ede enrolled at the Slade School of Fine Art; he left in March 1921 to become the photographer's assistant at the National Gallery and then, in 1922, an assistant at the Tate Gallery. During his fourteen years at the Tate (1922&#150;36) Ede established close contacts with avant-garde artists in Paris but served under a director, J. B. Manson, who was unable to recognize his talents. Had his friendships with Picasso, Braque, Chagall, Brancusi, Mir&oacute;, and others been exploited, the Tate could have had an unrivalled collection of early twentieth-century art. Similarly his friendships with younger British artists such as Ben Nicholson and Winifred Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth, Henry Moore, David Jones, and Christopher Wood were also ignored.<br>
<br>Ede met the Nicholsons in 1923, and it was they who kindled his interest in contemporary art. Others whom he acknowledged as important influences on his life were Gertrude Harris (widow of Frederick Leverton Harris), Lady Ottoline Morrell, Helen Sutherland, and T. E. Lawrence, with whom he regularly corresponded. Indeed, correspondence was a central activity in Ede's life. On 6 January 1921 Ede married Helen (1894&#150;1977), daughter of Otto Schlapp, professor of German at the University of Edinburgh. Scottish by birth, Helen began to call him Jim, a name which he was to adopt for the remainder of his life. Together they had two daughters. Within two years Ede acquired 1 Elm Row, Hampstead, with the help of his father, and there he and his wife entertained relentlessly, creating something of a salon for artists, collectors, and dignitaries. Ede was a collector of people as much as of art.<br>
<br>In 1926 Ede discovered the work of the sculptor Henri Gaudier-Brzeska (1819&#150;1915), when his estate was offered to the Tate, but there was little enthusiasm for his work. After persuading a number of collectors to purchase sculptures and drawings, Ede was given permission to acquire the remainder. From that year onwards he championed the cause of Gaudier-Brzeska by publishing books&#151;<span class="italic">A Life of Gaudier-Brzeska</span> (1930), republished as <span class="italic">Savage Messiah</span> (1931)&#151;and making generous gifts to museums, notably the Tate Gallery, the Mus&eacute;e des Beaux-Arts in Orl&eacute;ans (1959), and the Mus&eacute;e National d'Art Moderne in Paris (1967). He was nominated chevalier (1959) and officer (1967) of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur.<br>
<br>In October 1936 Ede, a leading contender to be the next director, resigned from the Tate on grounds of ill health, unable to work further with Manson. Supporting himself by American lecture tours, and with financial aid from his father, he and his family moved to Tangier. He spent the Second World War years in Tangier, North America, and England.<br>
<br>The Edes sold their house in 1952, and acquired a large, old farmhouse in the Loire valley. They returned to England in 1956, and in 1957 purchased a row of four derelict, seventeenth-century cottages in Cambridge. Ede converted them into a single dwelling and named it Kettle's Yard. Here he arranged his by then considerable collection of works of art, some given to him by his mother, who had purchased them on his advice, in a manner which would make modern art not merely approachable but alive, combining his twentieth-century enthusiasms with his love of artefacts and materials from the past. Works of art by Ben Nicholson and Brancusi would sit alongside antique country furniture, ancient stones, flints, and amphora. Old floorboards, tiles, and windows salvaged from demolished buildings found a natural home in a building which harmonized the modernist spirit of the 1930s with the experience of living in north Africa. A respect for light and space was the hub of Ede's vision. The house was infused with the spirituality which formed the core of his and his wife's life. They kept open house every afternoon and those fortunate to be there at closing time were invited to tea. In 1966 Ede gave Kettle's Yard to the University of Cambridge. He also endowed a student travel fund. Ede remained in residence until 1973, when he and his wife moved to Edinburgh. She died in 1977. He maintained links with the curators of Kettle's Yard and published a book on it, <span class="italic">A Way of Life</span> (1984).<br>
<br>Although Ede was confirmed in the Church of England in the 1960s, his belief in God was unbound by the strictures of any one denomination or by his early Methodist formation. He believed in God's all-pervasiveness and Kettle's Yard was for him a manifestation of God. Determination, obstinacy, and a sense of rightness, mixed with a twinkling charm, were important traits of his character. His own description of David Jones best encapsulates him: &#145;Someone with a strange force which comes, not out of the strength of his body, but from the strength of his intention.&#146; He died in Edinburgh on 15 March 1990 and his ashes were interred at St Peter's Church, Cambridge.<br>
