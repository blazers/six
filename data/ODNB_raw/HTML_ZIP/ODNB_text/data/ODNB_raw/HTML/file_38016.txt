<span class="headword">Storr,  Paul</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1770, <em>d.</em> 1844), <span class="occ">manufacturing silversmith</span>, was baptized in St Marylebone, Middlesex, on 28 October 1770, one of several children of Thomas Storr (<i>d</i>. 1803), a silver-chaser who by 1788 had become a victualler, and his wife, Sarah. Paul, who may himself have been trained as a silver-chaser, was apprenticed in 1784 to William Rock of Westminster, another victualler, becoming free of the Vintners' Company in 1791. Following a short-lived partnership during 1792 with the working silversmith William Frisbee, Storr removed to premises in Church Street, Soho, formerly occupied by Andrew Fogelberg, the Swedish-born silversmith, whose business had flourished there since about 1772. It is possible that Storr continued the concern, Fogelberg perhaps acting as the sleeping partner.<br>
<br>In 1796 Storr moved to 20 Air Street, Piccadilly, where a successful manufacturing silversmith of the previous generation, Thomas Pitts, had had his workshops. Supplying the retail trade with special orders and quality goods, Storr built up his business over the next eleven years into one of the most important of its kind in London. Then in 1807 he entered into an exclusive manufacturing arrangement with Rundell, Bridge, and Rundell, the crown jewellers, installing craftsmen in new jointly owned workshops in Dean Street, Soho. This subsidiary of the celebrated retail house on Ludgate Hill was known as Storr &amp; Co., the first partners, besides Storr himself, being Philip Rundell, John Bridge, the sculptor William Theed, and Edmond Waller Rundell. It is said that Rundells had to satisfy so many orders at this time that Storr &amp; Co. was obliged to work some 10,000 ounces of silver a month in the shape of dinner services, centrepieces, and other ceremonial and domestic plate.<br>
<br>Storr's agreement with Rundells terminated on 18 February 1819. By then he had already found suitable workshops in Harrison Street, Gray's Inn Road, where he set up once more as an independent manufacturer. During 1822 he also went into business as a retail goldsmith and jeweller in Bond Street with John Mortimer (<i>d</i>. 1871). This partnership, which included the silver manufactory, traded as Storr and Mortimer until Storr's retirement on 31 December 1838; thereafter the firm continued first as Mortimer and Hunt and then as Hunt and Roskell.<br>
<br>The lack of suitable evidence renders Storr's career, like that of so many contemporaries in the smaller industries, difficult to assess. Of his own personal work in any branch of the goldsmith's craft there is not a single identifiable item. Nor is there any other documentary evidence to support the contention, reinforced by the fact of his so-called maker's marks entered at the London assay office between 1792 and 1834, that he was an actual worker in the precious metals. All that may be stated with any certainty is that his knowledge of the craft must have been more than merely adequate and that he was a good businessman. In short, Storr's latter-day fame rests upon two particulars: first, that he was fortunate in working alongside some of the most talented artists, designers, and craftsmen of his time; and second, that the bulk of Rundell, Bridge, and Rundell's productions in silver during the years of their greatest success were made under his management at Storr &amp; Co. and thus bear his mark.<br>
<br>In 1801 Storr married Elizabeth Susanna (1771&#150;1843), youngest daughter of Ann and Adam Beyer (1729&#150;1804), who with his brother Lorence traded as a piano and organ builder in Compton Street, Soho. They had ten children. Storr retired to Hill House, Tooting, Surrey, and died in Tooting on 18 March 1844. He and his wife, who predeceased him, were buried in the churchyard of Tooting parish church.<br>
