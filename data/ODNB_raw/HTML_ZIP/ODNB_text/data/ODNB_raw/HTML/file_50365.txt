<span class="headword">Cooper,  John Astley</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1858, <em>d.</em> 1930), <span class="occ">propagandist for athleticism</span>, was born in Adelaide, South Australia, and baptized on 21 April 1858, the eldest of the six children of the Revd Astley Cooper (1832/3&#150;1915), the English-born vicar of St Mary's Church, Adelaide, Australia, and his wife, Fanny, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Williams. The family returned to England in 1870 and Cooper matriculated as a non-collegiate student at the University of Oxford in 1878 but did not take a degree. Little is known about his professional or private life, although in 1891 he was living in Richmond, Surrey, and described his occupation as author. He also claimed to be a company director and travelled to Africa on business at least once.<br>
<br>Cooper was an enthusiastic imperialist who first gave public expression to his views in July 1891, when he anonymously published an article entitled &#145;Many lands&#151;one people&#146; in <span class="italic">Greater Britain</span>. Later that year he put forward his proposals for an Anglo-Saxon Olympiad the aim of which was to provide a new bond for an empire threatened (as he saw it) by both internal divisions and foreign rivals. He advocated the strengthening of a &#145;great network of a common literature, fine arts, academic studies and athletic exercises&#146;, of which the latter was the most important. His views were crudely Darwinistic, and presented the English-speaking race as having a God-given responsibility for the extension of civilization; in this work the United States was envisaged as very much a junior partner to the British empire. When J. A. Froude supported him in <span class="italic">The Times</span> in 1892, Cooper's ideas received a much wider airing; and the British national and provincial press was matched in its enthusiasm by that of the empire.<br>
<br>Despite this, and despite the refining of his views in such journals as the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>, Cooper's proposals foundered because of apprehension about the likely costs and because of widespread apathy. He was also pushed out of the limelight by the growing acceptance of Pierre de Coubertin's proposals for an international Olympiad, which would serve as a peacemaker between imperial rivalries. Cooper returned to obscurity until 1908, when the Olympics were held in London and he was able to claim them as a triumph of his ideas. He also claimed to have invented Empire day, more usually ascribed to Reginald Brabazon, twelfth earl of Meath.<br>
<br>Cooper subsequently found another outlet for his views in the Royal Colonial Institute and its journal <span class="italic">United Empire</span>. He reiterated his views, if anything more crudely, in its pages in 1910, at a time of growing international uncertainty. His last known contribution came after the outbreak of the First World War, when his jingoism and assumptions about the automatic superiority of the British were presented again in <span class="italic">United Empire</span> (vol. 7, 1916), in his lecture &#145;The British imperial spirit of sport and the war&#146;. This rambling panegyric to militant athleticism appeared just before the battle of the Somme revealed how tenuous such claims were.<br>
<br>Cooper hit a popular vein of assumed superiority which events called into question. Although he disappeared from the public press after 1916 many of his ideas survived the war and came to fruition with the establishment of the British empire games, first held at Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, in August 1930. Cooper died on 4 February 1930, aged seventy-three, at 2 Beach Houses, Beach Road, Westgate-on-Sea, Kent, survived by his wife, Agnes.<br>
