<span class="headword">Blackwell,  Richard</span>  (1918&#150;1980), <span class="occ">bookseller and publisher</span>, was born on 5 January 1918 at 1 Frenchay Road, Oxford, the eldest in the family of two sons and three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30824/', "Sir Basil Henry Blackwell (1889&#150;1984)")</script>, bookseller, and his wife, Marion Christine (1888/9&#150;1977), daughter of John Soans, schoolmaster, of Ramsgate. He was educated at the Dragon School in Oxford. He won a scholarship to Winchester College, and from there a scholarship to New College, Oxford, where he rowed in the first eight; in 1938 he achieved a first class in classical honour moderations. However, the war cut short his academic career, and he did not return later, but was content with a wartime MA (1944). His six and a half years of war service were spent in the Royal Navy, as lieutenant (S), Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. He saw action and hardship on the Russian convoy route and also in the Mediterranean, where in 1944 he was awarded the DSC. On 23 May 1942 he married Marguerite Brook Holliday (<i>b</i>. 1922/3), the daughter of Major Lionel Brook Holliday, industrialist and landowner, of Copgrave Hall, Yorkshire. They had two sons. He was destined for the family firm and in 1946 he joined his father in the bookselling business.<br>
<br>After the war Blackwells enjoyed a high and enviable reputation as one of the best retail booksellers in the English-speaking world, but the actual size of the business in financial terms was modest. It was Richard Blackwell's life work to build a large, complex, and successful international business on this base. He achieved this by foreseeing the spread of English as the main international language, the post-war growth of higher education throughout the world, and the establishment of many new universities and libraries, and thus the opportunities for export. He also promoted specialization in the management of the business.<br>
<br>Blackwell travelled widely and took every opportunity for development. He nurtured many small and not so small subsidiary and associated companies in the book trade. The most significant of these was perhaps Blackwell Scientific Publications Ltd. In 1964 he formed, with Oxford University Press as a joint partner, University Bookshops (Oxford) Ltd.. When the Richard Abel library supply business in the United States failed, he developed Blackwell North America Inc. to take over the business. His aim was to develop a worldwide service supplying English periodicals and books to academic and specialist libraries and customers. While Blackwells was always a priority, he also helped to establish the Smaller Business Association (later the Association of Independent Businesses), which upheld the rights of small firms. In 1962 he worked hard for the defence of the net book agreement and played an arduous part in the case itself before the restrictive trade practices court (see R. E. Barker and G. R. Davies, eds., <span class="italic">Books are Different</span>, 1966). For two years (1966&#150;8) he was president of the Booksellers' Association.<br>
<br>In all business enterprises Blackwell always ensured the ultimate control by the Blackwell family. It was not only a question of seeing his inheritance multiply, it was also his intention that the family business should remain wholly independent and private. During the years of growth Richard Blackwell had been supported by his family, above all his father, his younger brother, Julian, and latterly his two sons, Miles and Nigel, all actively involved in the management of the business. In the early days the guidance of his father was an essential feature in his success, but he steadily took over the main burden of responsibility, becoming managing director in 1966 and chairman in 1969. In 1976 he became chairman of Basil Blackwell Publisher Ltd, the publishing business originally established by his father as Blackwell and Mott. He always down-played his achievement with characteristic modesty and self-effacement.<br>
<br>In 1971 Blackwell was made an honorary DLitt at York University, Ontario, and in 1978 he was elected a fellow of St Cross College, Oxford. He died of cancer at his home, Tubney House, Tubney, near Abingdon, Oxfordshire, on 26 February 1980; his funeral took place on the 29th.<br>
