<span class="headword">Ohthere <span class="st"> [&Oacute;ttarr]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em>871&#150;899), <span class="occ">explorer</span>, was a Norwegian chieftain who in the reign of Alfred the Great paid a visit to the royal court in Wessex and supplied some information about Scandinavia. This was included in the late ninth-century Old English translation of Orosius's &#145;History against the pagans&#146;, and provides the only source of knowledge about Ohthere. His account includes descriptions of three voyages and of Ohthere's way of living.<br>
<br>King Alfred is described as Ohthere's &#145;lord&#146;. This probably reflects the fact that the king was protector of all visitors and guests at his court, whether their visit was brief or a long one. Ohthere told his hosts that he lived furthest to the north of all Northmen. This must have been in H&aring;logaland somewhere near modern Troms&oslash;, Norway. The traditional boundary between the areas of <i>b&uacute;menn</i> (permanent settlers) and those of the nomadic Sami people is the Malangen Fjord; viking-age settlements have been excavated on islands just north of Malangen.<br>
<br>Ohthere supported himself by agriculture. He ploughed a little land with horses and kept cattle, sheep, and pigs, but only a score of each. His chief wealth was in reindeer, of which he had 600, and in the tribute which the Finnas (Sami) paid him. This consisted in skins of beasts, the feathers of birds, whalebone, and ship's ropes made from whale-hide and sealskin. He also hunted walrus; the ivory from their teeth was highly valued, and Ohthere brought some to Alfred. Tribute taken from the Samians was an important part of the economic basis of the chieftains of H&aring;logaland until the high middle ages, when this source of income was taken over by Swedish and Finnish tax collectors. Ohthere reports that he had to compete for it with the Cwenas, a Finnish tribe or group that sometimes raided the Norwegians.<br>
<br>One of Ohthere's journeys took him round the North Cape and along today's Lapmark, vast areas inhabited only by Finnas, and round the Kola peninsula, home of the Terfinnas (probably another Sami people), into the White Sea. Here he reached the permanently settled areas of the Biarmians, a Finnish people, but did not venture into them for lack of a peace agreement. His main reason for undertaking this journey, apart from exploring the land, was to hunt walruses; a party of six men had been able to kill sixty walruses in two days, he claimed. The scholars at Alfred's court seem to have been particularly interested to learn whether, when Ohthere changed direction, he did so because the land was turning, or because the sea was penetrating the land. This would have helped them to establish whether Ohthere had been travelling along the utmost edge of the world, or was merely entering another inland sea like the Baltic, said to penetrate the land.<br>
<br>Another part of the account describes the journey from Ohthere's home to the port of &#145;Sciringesheal&#146; in southern Norway. This has been identified as Kaupang near Larvik, an important market in viking-age Norway. This journey could, under adverse conditions, take as much as a month. Reference is made in the account to the location of Ireland and Britain, though not for any purpose of practical navigation. From Sciringesheal Ohthere continued his journey to Hedeby in the south of Jutland, which was reached in five days. He said that for the three days he had &#145;Denmark&#146; to port and the open sea to starboard. Then for two days he had Jutland and &#145;Sillende&#146; (south Jutland) and many islands to starboard; his interviewer commented that the Angles lived in those parts before they came to &#145;this land&#146; (England). And on the port side he had those islands which belong to &#145;Denmark&#146;. This distinction between Jutland and &#145;Sillende&#146; and many islands on one side, and &#145;Denmark&#146; and the islands belonging to it on the other, is matched in the introductory description of Europe beyond the Danube and the Rhine by a distinction between south Danes in &#145;Sillende&#146; and Jutland, and north Danes in &#145;Denmark&#146;, Zealand, with adjacent islands and the south-western coastlands of modern Sweden.<br>
