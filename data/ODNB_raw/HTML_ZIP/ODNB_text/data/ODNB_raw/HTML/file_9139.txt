<span class="headword">Fane,  Mildmay</span>, second earl of Westmorland  (1602&#150;1666), <span class="occ">politician and writer</span>, was born on 24 January 1602, the eldest son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9130/', "Francis Fane, first earl of Westmorland (1583/4&#150;1629)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9143/', "Fane, Sir Thomas")</script>], and his wife, Mary (1581/2&#150;1640), the daughter and heir of Sir Anthony Mildmay of Apethorpe, Northamptonshire, where Fane spent his early years; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/93575/', "Lady Rachael Fane")</script> was his sister. In December 1616 he matriculated from Christ's College, Cambridge; he proceeded MA in 1619. On 22 November 1620 he was returned as one of the MPs for Peterborough. Admitted on 7 August 1622 as a student of Lincoln's Inn, he was granted, on 9 September, a pass to travel overseas with his tutor, and embarked upon a two-year tour of France. At Orl&eacute;ans he devoted several months to the study of French, and at N&icirc;mes he was inspired to translate into English Beza's epigram upon the Pont du Gard.<br>
<br>The Fane family seat was Mereworth Castle in Kent, and in 1625, the newly created earl's having secured the support of the Dering family for his son's candidature, Mildmay, now styled Lord Burghersh, was returned as a knight of the shire. On 1 February 1626, at the coronation of Charles I, he was admitted a knight of the Bath, and with the death of his grandmother in June was styled Lord Le Despenser. It was probably in the same year that he married Grace, the daughter of William Thornhurst of Agnes (or Aghne) Court, Romney Marsh, in Kent and his wife, Anne, daughter of Thomas, first Viscount Howard. He records in his autobiography the birth of six children, of whom the first five were girls; the last child, born on 6 January 1635, was a boy, Charles, later the third earl, to whom Charles I acted as godfather. The following year, probably on 29 June 1636, Grace Fane died in childbirth. On 21 June 1638 the widower married Mary (<i>c</i>.1611&#150;1669), widow of Sir Roger Townshend and daughter and coheir of Horatio Vere. There were nine children of this marriage, of whom the eldest son, Vere, succeeded his half-brother in the earldom.<br>
<br>Le Despenser had already sat as MP for Peterborough in 1625&#150;6 and did so again in 1628; in February of that year he was also named to the commission of martial law in Northamptonshire. At the death of his father and his succession to the earldom other lucrative offices were secured through the assiduity of his mother and the patronage of Secretary Dorchester. He was made commissioner for the compositions for knighthood, as confirmed on 22 March 1631, and served as a JP and as a deputy lieutenant in Northamptonshire. But despite his high status in the county he fell foul of government efforts to exploit the revenue potential of the forest laws. In 1637, together with his mother, he was fined the huge sum of &pound;19,000 for infractions in Rockingham forest, though it seems that in his and many other cases the fines were not actually collected. In spring 1640 he appears to have embroiled himself, ill-advisedly, in a dispute with Lord Chancellor Coventry.<br>
<br>On 15 February 1639 Westmorland wrote to Windebanke that illness prevented him from accompanying the king's expeditionary force to Scotland, but he pledged not to &#145;fail either in person or substance at the time and place of rendezvous&#146;, and kept this promise, quartering with the army in York later in the year  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1638&#150;9</i>, 467). On 22 February 1642 he and two others received from Charles I his answer to the propositions of parliament for financing the suppression of the Irish rising. But he was also one of the lords who rallied to the king's court at York, pledging money for his campaign on 22 June. Westmorland, Lord Mountagu, and Sir Christopher Hatton wrote to the high sheriff of Northamptonshire informing him that they intended to execute the commission of array on 15 August, but on that day they sent notice to the parliamentary commissioners that they were abandoning the attempt in the hope that the outbreak of hostilities could be avoided. A week later, however, on the 22nd, they organized a muster of gentry sympathetic to the royal cause at Oundle. The arrival in the county of the parliamentarian army put an end to these efforts and, following a summons from the Lords, Westmorland was imprisoned in the Tower. On 1 April 1643 the Lords voted to parole him to his house in Bartholomew Close; despite Commons opposition, this was allowed and in August he was given permission to ride within 5 miles of the city. During the following months he pledged loyalty to the Commonwealth and directed several petitions to the Lords, complaining that his losses from fines and sequestration in several counties amounted to over &pound;3300. On 26 July 1644 the committee for compounding imposed a further fine of &pound;2000, which parliament halved on the 30th; his properties were taken out of sequestration on 14 September. He subscribed to the solemn league and covenant before the commissioners of the great seal on 22 April 1645.<br>
<br>From 1645 until 1660 Westmorland withdrew almost entirely from public affairs, though in 1652 he signed a petition of Northamptonshire landowners urging measures to regulate the wool trade. He seems not to have been much troubled by the authorities; they commandeered his London house as a barracks in 1650, but paid compensation. In 1648 he had printed for private subscription his best-known writing, <span class="italic">Otia sacra</span>, a volume of verse; another entitled &#145;Fugitive Poetry&#146;, with its epigrams, acrostics, and anagrams in English and Latin, is among the manuscripts preserved at Apethorpe. He was acquainted with Robert Herrick, who urged him to publish, and mentions him in his poems. Westmorland's seven plays remained unpublished in his lifetime; his modern editor found them &#145;sufficiently individual to merit attention&#146; but thought that Westmorland's verse, though not of the highest order, was his best achievement  (Leech, 20).<br>
<br>At the Restoration Westmorland benefited from the oblivion which so often enveloped the past record of wealthy turncoats. On 11 July 1660 he was appointed a lord lieutenant of Northamptonshire together with the earl of Bridgewater. In 1662 a warrant was issued for the payment to him of &pound;50 from secret service funds for arranging for the demolition of fortifications at Northampton, which (as at other towns) were thought to encourage attempts at urban insurrection. He died on 12 February 1666 and was buried at Apethorpe. His widow, Mary, survived him; she died at Mereworth and was buried there on 18 November 1669.<br>
