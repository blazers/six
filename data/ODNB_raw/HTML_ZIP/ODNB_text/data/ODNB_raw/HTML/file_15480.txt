<span class="headword">Ketel,  Cornelis Govertszoon</span>  (1548&#150;1616), <span class="occ">painter and poet</span>, was born in Gouda in the Netherlands on 18 March 1548. He was the illegitimate son of Elysabeth Jacobsdochter Ketel (<i>d</i>. 1582) and Govert Janszoon van Proyen (<i>d</i>. 1574), who was related to the Gouda glass painter Wouter Pieterszoon Crabeth. Cornelis received some training from his uncle Cornelis Jacobszoon Ketel, who was also a glass painter, and subsequently, about 1565, from the painter Anthonie Blocklandt in Delft. In 1566 he went to France, going to Fontainebleau and living in Paris. He was prevented from travelling on to Italy by an edict that commanded temporary residents to return to the Spanish Netherlands, which he did in 1567.<br>
<br>After practising as a painter in Gouda for six years, in 1573 Ketel moved to London, where he initially resided in Southwark with the Netherlandish sculptor William Cure (Willem Keur), a friend of his uncle. In London in 1574 he married Aeltje Gerritsdochter (<i>d</i>. 1606), also from Gouda, and the couple had three children who were baptized in London: Gedeon (1576&#150;1579), Ezechiell (<i>b</i>. 1578), and Eve (<i>b</i>. 1579). The latter two were dead by 28 February 1595, as was another son, Rafel, who was born in Amsterdam in 1581. A further son, Andries, died before November 1613. The family lived in Bishopsgate, near Crosby Place in the City of London. Many of Ketel's wealthy merchant patrons were based in this area, such as Thomas &#145;Customer&#146; Smythe (1522&#150;1591), who apparently commissioned from Ketel a set of head-and-shoulders portraits of his large family. Nine of these survive, seven in a single British private collection, one in another private collection, and one in the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut. They are all inscribed 1579, and the capital &#145;A&#146; of the Latin word &#145;A[nn]o&#146;, also written thereon, is in a distinctive serpentine form frequently found on Ketel's British works.<br>
<br>Ketel's earliest London commissions had come from the German merchants at the Steelyard, the Hanseatic trading base next to the Thames. These included the circular double-sided <span class="italic">Portrait of a Gentleman, Probably Adam Wachendorff</span> (1574; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam); the back of the wooden panel is painted with the device of a naked cherub blowing bubbles, with a Greek inscription that translates as &#145;Man's life is like a bubble&#146;&#151;a meditation on the vanity of human life. In 1577 he depicted <span class="italic">Sir Martin Frobisher</span> at full length (Bodl. Oxf.), the only surviving work from a commission from the Cathay Company for nineteen pictures, among them ones of the Inuit who had accompanied Frobisher back to England from his expedition in search of a north-west passage to China. Records for this commission show that Ketel was charging &pound;5 for a full-length portrait and &pound;1 for a head.<br>
<br>In 1578, according to his Haarlem-based friend and biographer Karel van Mander (writing in 1604, while Ketel was still alive), Edward Seymour, first earl of Hertford, commissioned him to portray Elizabeth I, for which she sat at &#145;the house of Hantworth&#146;. This work seems not to have survived. (The &#145;Sieve&#146; portrait of the queen, now in the Pinacoteca Nazionale, Siena, was long thought to be this, but was found in 1988 to be signed by another Netherlandish painter, Quentin Metsys the younger.) Ketel was also said to have painted a portrait of Aubrey de Vere, twentieth earl of Oxford.<br>
<br>In England, according to van Mander, Ketel received many portrait commissions, but none for the allegorical and historical paintings which he preferred to do. He therefore produced a large allegory, on canvas, &#145;with more than life-sized figures with the symbolic representation of how Power is overcome by Wisdom and Prudence&#146;  (van Mander, 358&#150;9). This was purchased by a &#145;young &hellip; English merchant called Mr Pieter Hachten, who presented it to Sir Christoffel Hatten, who died as Lord Chancellor&#146;  (ibid.). A large fragment of this picture, signed by Ketel and dated 1580, was recently discovered (priv. coll., USA).<br>
<br>In 1581 Ketel left for Amsterdam: it has been suggested that his free, painterly style of portraiture was out of tune with the more unshadowed, linear manner favoured by clients in England. He seems to have introduced the use of the full-length portrait for middle-class sitters to the northern Netherlands. In Amsterdam he painted many portraits, notably the large full-length group <span class="italic">The Militia Company of Captain Dirck Jacobszoon Rosecrans and Lieutenant Pauw</span> (1588; Rijksmuseum). He also produced painted and drawn allegories, accompanied by poetic texts, most of which are now lost. The Danish-born painter Pieter Isaacszoon was his pupil. In 1598 he began making clay figures. From around 1599, so van Mander reported, Ketel experimented with painting without the use of a brush, using his fingers and, in 1600, his feet. These works seem to have been conceived as displays of technical virtuosity. In October 1607 he married, second, Ael Jansdochter (<i>d</i>. 1630/31). In 1613 he was partially paralysed by a stroke. Ketel died in Amsterdam on 5 August 1616, and was buried there in the Oude Kerk three days later.<br>
