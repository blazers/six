<span class="headword">Last,  Joseph William</span>  (1809?&#150;1880), <span class="occ">printer and journal proprietor</span>, was probably born on 13 October 1809 in Stoke Green, Ipswich, Suffolk, the son of Joseph and Eliza Last. He married Elizabeth Smith on 8 January 1833 at St Bride's Church, Fleet Street, London. By 1839 he was described as a printer, dealer, and chapman, and had gained a considerable trade reputation in Edward Street, Hampstead, where he produced some highly successful weekly publications entitled <span class="italic">Tales of the Wars</span> for the publisher William Mark Clark of Warwick Lane. Splendidly illustrated with either a naval or military battle on the first page, they attained an immense circulation. Last early had a reputation for as extensive a knowledge of the machinery and practicalities of printing as any man of his time. He claimed to be the first to print a six-sheet poster and was one of the earliest to execute superior work from a cylinder-press supposedly unfitted for the requirements of woodcut reproduction.<br>
<br>With his excellent taste in effective and fancy display typography, from 1838 onwards Last established himself as a theatrical printer in various places near the Strand. Noteworthy in a forty-year career full of vicissitudes was his management of the Strand Printing Company and the Savoy Press in Savoy Street, the Strand (1861&#150;3). He finally settled down in Wych Street, London, where he carried on a successful business until his death, his son, Alfred Last, being his manager. Best known, however, was 3 Crane Court, Fleet Street (1840&#150;43), nearly opposite the Whitefriars Printing Works. Here also were born Parr's Life Pills, puffed as a longevity pill by Herbert Ingram, who for this purpose rented some rooms &#145;on the premises of his friend Mr Last&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mr. Punch: his Origin and Career</span>, 14). His landlord's close ancestral ties were with &#145;gutter papers&#146; best known for their short shelf-life, small sales, scurrility, and sensationalism. In June 1837 Last launched <span class="italic">The Town</span>, a weekly featuring original indecorous essays for aspiring gentlemen about town, which collapsed after 156 numbers in May 1840. He owned another weekly with a rickety provenance, <span class="italic">The Crown</span>, which ran from July 1838 to April 1839. He seemingly could not exist without a comic journal, his next venture being <span class="italic">The Squib</span>, self-described as a &#145;granulation of wit, satire and amusement&#146;, which survived from 29 May to 17 December 1842.<br>
<br>With the engraver Ebenezer Landells, Last was starting a periodical called <span class="italic">The Cosmorama</span> when he introduced Landells to Henry Mayhew, a son of his solicitor. Although a coherent story of its birth remains cloudy, Last's family was to claim that the initiative lay with the master printer for the birth of an English version of Philipon's <span class="italic">Charivari</span> (a periodical built around a large satirical drawing), initially to be called the <span class="italic">Funny Dog</span> but destined to achieve immortality as <span class="italic">Punch, or, The London &#145;Charivari&#146;</span>. The printer met with and discussed the project with a literary circle meeting at an inn kept by Mark Lemon, and at least one meeting took place in Last's office, where it appears a prospectus was first read and debated.<br>
<br>Despite bankruptcy proceedings in March 1839 and mindful of the bleak age of the &#145;hungry forties&#146;, when it took courage to launch a comic journal, Last contrived to invest &pound;600, representing one-third of the new property. Another third came from Landells, who was to act as art editor, and the remaining third was divided equally between three co-editors, Mayhew, Lemon, and Stirling Coyne. The first number was printed on 17 July 1842 and distributed from 13 Wellington Street. Mayhew wanted emphasis on a whole-page political cartoon with the back left blank, but Last expressed anxiety over this ingredient for success. Less emotionally involved with the project and having to bear its start-up costs, Last soon saw little prospect of any returns and refused to go on. Rival printers Bradbury and Evans (familiarly known as the &#145;Whitefriars potentates&#146;) broke off negotiations to acquire Last's share, which was eventually acquired by Landells. Last's son, however, was to maintain that there had been a direct sale to Bradbury and Evans in September 1841.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, with the growth of mass literacy Ingram had enjoyed a remarkable success with cheap, illustrated weekly periodicals, and Last was engaged as managing printer for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> (1842). His proven ability influenced that great pictorial speculation, printed on the same machinery erected for <span class="italic">Punch</span>. While still actively engaged in business as J. W. Last &amp; Co., Last died in St Peter's Hospital, Berners Street, London, on 23 March 1880 from a combination of peritonitis and &#145;exhaustion&#146;.<br>
