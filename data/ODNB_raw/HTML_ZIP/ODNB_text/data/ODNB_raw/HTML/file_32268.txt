<span class="headword">Campbell,  John Charles <span class="st"> [Jock]</span></span>  (1894&#150;1942), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Thurso, Caithness, on 10 January 1894, the second child and only son of Daniel Alexander Campbell, later in business in India, and his wife, Marion, daughter of Donald MacKay, sheep farmer, of Skelpick, Sutherland. He was educated at Sedbergh School, and on the first day of war in 1914 he enlisted in the Honourable Artillery Company. In July 1915 he was commissioned second lieutenant from the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He joined the British expeditionary force (BEF) in August, was wounded in February and May 1916, and in September was sent back to England, but returned to the front in August 1917. At the end of the war he was serving in France as a captain in the Royal Horse Artillery and had been awarded the MC.<br>
<br>Between the wars Campbell made his mark as a riding instructor at Woolwich and later at Weedon, Northamptonshire, with a reputation of being an ideal regimental officer and a first-class horseman. He was fond of all animals and devoted to horses. An excellent polo player, he was in all three Royal Artillery teams which won the inter-regimental polo cup, and for some years was probably unsurpassed in the shires as a heavyweight rider to hounds. On 12 September 1922 Campbell married Rosamond Elizabeth Rhodes (<i>b</i>. 1901/2), daughter of William Rhodes JP and great-niece of Cecil Rhodes. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>The outbreak of war in 1939 found him a major in command of C battery, 4th regiment, Royal Horse Artillery, in Egypt. In July 1940 he succeeded to the command of his regiment, and when in September the Italian advance began, he soon distinguished himself by the boldness and judgement with which he handled his guns in a series of rearguard actions while commanding alternately the 4th and 3rd regiments. During this period he organized and led a number of mobile columns, consisting of a few guns and escort, against the Italian communications, and when used against the Germans these were nicknamed, after him, &#145;Jock columns&#146;. For this service he was appointed to the DSO. During the long advance to Benghazi in which, for his work on 14 December 1940, he received a bar to the DSO, Campbell displayed the same dash and enterprise, and during the subsequent retreat to Sollum he rendered marked service.<br>
<br>The climax of Campbell's career came in the autumn of 1941 when, on 3 September, he was appointed to the command of the 7th support group with the rank of brigadier. His handling of the group during the two most critical days of the battle of Sidi Rezegh (21 and 22 November) became an epic of the war. When almost surrounded by superior forces, Campbell showed great bravery. Three times he led tank forces against the advancing enemy, guiding his troops from his open car with a blue handkerchief, and three times he helped personally in the service of the guns at critical moments of the battle. Though wounded, he refused to be evacuated. For this work he was awarded the VC.<br>
<br>The following February Campbell was appointed to command the 7th armoured division with the rank of major-general, but on 26 February 1942 he was killed in a motor accident at Halfaya Pass, Egypt. There is a memorial to him at Sedbergh School.<br>
