<span class="headword">Green,  John</span>  (1787&#150;1852), <span class="occ">architect and civil engineer</span>, was born on 20 June 1787 at Newton Fell House, Nafferton, Northumberland, the son of John Green, builder, carpenter, and agricultural implement-maker, and his wife, Ann. After attending a local school he evidently gained a practical education by working in his father's business, and soon after he came of age he was taken into partnership. The firm then moved to the larger town of Corbridge, and here they expanded their activities into general building work, with the son turning his attention to the architectural side of the business. About 1820 he moved to Newcastle upon Tyne, from where he established his extensive professional practice in the area of Northumberland and co. Durham.<br>
<br>Green's early works as an architect included the Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Society's building (1822&#150;5) and the beginnings of a lengthy sequence of somewhat undistinguished Gothic-style churches. He also developed a reputation as a designer of farmhouses: he was employed in this capacity on the Beaufront estate near Hexham (1824), and by Hugh Percy, second duke of Northumberland. Green's principal contribution, however, was in the field of civil engineering, as a builder of road and railway bridges. In 1829&#150;31 he built two wrought-iron suspension bridges, at Scotswood across the Tyne (dem. 1967) and at Whorlton across the Tees, the latter of which survives as the oldest bridge of its type in the country still supported unaided by its original chains. He also built several handsome examples in masonry; and, most important, at the Ouseburn and Willington Dene bridges (1836&#150;9; dem.) on the Newcastle and North Shields Railway and in a number of subsequent examples he successfully employed a system of laminated timber arches, which, for a short time, was widely imitated in railway bridge construction. In 1840 Green was elected to the Institution of Civil Engineers and the following year he was awarded the institution's Telford medal for his work on laminated arch design.<br>
<br>Green was said to have been a &#145;plain practical shrewd man of business&#146; whose style was &#145;plain, severe and economical&#146;  (Welford, 330). In 1805 he married Jane Stobart; they had two sons, John and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37482/', "Benjamin Green")</script>, both of whom became architects. The latter in the mid-1830s became a partner of his father, and it is not always possible to distinguish the work of the father from that of the son. The monument to John Lambton, first earl of Durham, at Penshaw Hill, co. Durham (1844), in the form of a Greek Doric temple, for example, is simply ascribed to &#145;John and Benjamin Green&#146;. In general, however, the father appears to have concentrated on the civil engineering works and the son, who was a pupil of Augustus Charles Pugin, on the more purely architectural. John Green died in Newcastle on 30 September 1852. Drawings by John and Benjamin Green are in the Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne.<br>
