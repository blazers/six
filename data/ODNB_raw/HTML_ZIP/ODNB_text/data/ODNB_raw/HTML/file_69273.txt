<span class="headword">Taylor <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Clifford]</span>,  (May Doris) Charity</span>, Lady Taylor  (1914&#150;1998), <span class="occ">prison administrator</span>, was born on 16 September 1914 at West Lea, York Road, Woking, Surrey, the third daughter and youngest of four children of (Wron) George Clifford, journalist, and his wife, Emma Ada, formerly Cundy. Her father wrote on snooker and angling for the <span class="italic">News of the World</span>. Brought up in Huntingdon, Charity excelled at Huntingdon grammar school and trained in London as a doctor at the London (Royal Free Hospital) School of Medicine for Women. In the late 1930s Dr Clifford was a house surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital and the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital. She married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39545/', "Stephen James Lake Taylor (1910&#150;1988)")</script>, also a doctor, on 3 October 1939; two sons and a daughter were born between 1940 and 1950. Resolved to continue working, Charity Taylor in 1942 became an assistant medical officer at HM prison Holloway, the largest women's gaol in Britain. Conditions were bad there during the war, as internment of Nazi-sympathizers caused overcrowding. Despite soap shortages, Dr Taylor improved hygiene and won promotion to medical officer.<br>
<br>Charity Taylor became the first ever female governor of Holloway prison in 1945. Though reluctant to abandon medicine, she wanted to show that a woman could run a major gaol as well as a man (if not better). Portraits of Elizabeth I, Joan of Arc, and Florence Nightingale adorned her office walls. Women's magazines liked to interview the pretty young brunette who combined motherhood with a career commonly associated with severe spinsters. The governor explained that she virtually worked from home, since the Taylors lived in the big battlemented governor's house within the prison complex. Having children may have given her greater insight into certain problems: her study of women gaoled for child neglect in 1948&#150;9 concluded that their offences were due to inadequacy and ignorance rather than to conscious cruelty.<br>
<br>The <span class="roman">Criminal Justice Act</span> 1948 allowed some liberalization of the prison regime. More letters and visits were permitted. Access to libraries and recreation improved. Dr Taylor had an open mind on the value of psychiatry. Everyone must stand on their own two feet, she believed, but she could be a good listener as well as a great talker. To boost prisoners' self-esteem, she let them use make-up and choose the colour of their uniforms. The range of educational opportunities widened, though a special pre-release course failed to attract many participants. More successful was the jam factory founded in 1951.<br>
<br>The governorship of Holloway was the toughest job in the women's prison system. With the start of &#145;open&#146; prisons at Askham Grange and Hill Hall, the population of Holloway dropped to about three hundred after 1952&#151;less than half full&#151;yet the proportion of &#145;unreformables&#146; grew. Alcoholism and self-harm were common, and tension mounted at the time of executions: Styllou Christofi in 1954 and Ruth Ellis in 1955. Dr Taylor arranged separate blocks for remand prisoners, first-time offenders, and younger inmates. She deemed the work of a governor easy so far as prisoners were concerned: a written code determined their respective roles.<br>
<br>Holloway was a traditional radial prison, opened in 1852, and now grimly antiquated. The governor blamed her own chronic rheumatism on the damp. Its closure, promised in 1938, was postponed in 1939 and 1950; redecoration in brighter colours failed to disguise the pervading gloom, against which Charity Taylor struggled to create a calm and domestic atmosphere. She was certain that cleanliness, orderliness, and discipline had a good effect. Visitors compared her to a firm and efficient headmistress.<br>
<br>Lady Taylor acquired her title in August 1958 when her husband, Labour MP for Barnet (1945&#150;50), became Baron Taylor of Harlow on receipt of a life peerage. In 1959 she took charge of the whole structure of female prisons and borstals in England and Wales as assistant commissioner and inspector of prisons (women)&#151;a post renamed assistant director when the Prison Commission was turned into a department of the Home Office in 1963. Of a total prison roll of 26,000 in 1959, fewer than one thousand were women, but the very smallness of the service presented difficulties, as it could render specialized programmes uneconomic. Lady Taylor was a proficient administrator who assimilated information and made decisions with extraordinary rapidity. She put much effort into training staff and opened a women's prison at Styal, Manchester, in 1963. Plans for another in Essex foundered in 1965, however: the long-awaited redevelopment of Holloway could not begin until 1970. Lady Taylor was a member of the General Advisory Council of the BBC (1964&#150;7).<br>
<br>When Lord Taylor accepted the vice-chancellorship of the Memorial University of Newfoundland in 1967, Charity took early retirement and accompanied him to Canada, where she became president of the Newfoundland and Labrador Social Welfare Council (1968&#150;71). They returned to Britain in 1973 to live near Llangollen. Widowed in 1988, Lady Taylor died at the Princess Royal Hospital, Haywards Heath, Sussex, on 4 January 1998. Her fourteen years at HM prison Holloway had banished any doubt about women governing women's prisons.<br>
