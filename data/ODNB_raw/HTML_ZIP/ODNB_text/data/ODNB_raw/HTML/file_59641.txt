<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pearse,  Margaret Mary</span>  (1878&#150;1968), <span class="occ">teacher and politician</span>, was born at 27 Great Brunswick Street (later Pearse Street), Dublin, on 4 August 1878, the eldest child of the two daughters and two sons of James Pearse (1839&#150;1900), stone carver and sometime pamphleteer, and his second wife, Margaret Brady (1857&#150;1932), the daughter of a Dublin coal factor. James Pearse had emigrated to Ireland from England and by the early 1870s had established his own firm in Dublin. Brought up by a free-thinking father and a Unitarian mother, his only formal education was at Sunday school, but he read widely and became interested in political issues. His first marriage was short-lived and unhappy, though it did produce two children and the conversion of the entire family to Roman Catholicism. Pearse married Margaret Brady within a year of his first wife's death in 1876. She was a devout Catholic who boasted something of a nationalist pedigree as two of her ancestors had died in the 1798 rising and her grandfather was an Irish-speaker who had moved from co. Meath to Dublin during the great famine of the 1840s.<br>
<br>The couple's four children were born &#145;over the shop&#146; in Great Brunswick Street within the first six years of their marriage. Much of the house was sublet, but as the family's fortunes improved they let less of the house to tenants and they eventually moved away from the business. The family home received few visitors and the children appeared to have little contact with other children of their own age. Their relationship with their mother was strong and close, but their father remained distant. Margaret Pearse, known as Maggie or Wow Wow within the family, and her siblings were devout: she and her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37840/', "Patrick Henry Pearse")</script> were very fond of the ceremonies of Holy Week and both attended church frequently. Described by her brother's biographer as &#145;plain and squat&#146;, Margaret Pearse was considered to be bossy, and did not fawn over her brother as much as the rest of the family appeared to.<br>
<br>Margaret Pearse was educated at the Holy Faith convent in Glasnevin and it is possible that she received some teacher training. She did not enter into paid employment, but she was interested in education, travelling with her brother to Brussels in 1905 to examine the workings of the bilingual education system and improving her French. Her own attempt to establish an infants' school in 1907 failed, but she was supportive of and involved in her brother Patrick's attempts to set up an innovative Irish language school.<br>
<br>Established initially at Cullenswood House, Patrick Pearse's school, St Enda's, moved in 1910 to a 50 acre site near Dublin as its student numbers continued to grow. A bilingual school, it was persistently in debt and under-staffed as a consequence. Despite not speaking Irish herself, Margaret Pearse became increasingly dedicated to the Irish language, insisting on signing her name in Irish and encouraging the teaching of the language in the school. She acted as school matron and housekeeper along with her mother and a female cousin. She also ran the preparatory school, taught junior French, and corresponded with the students when they went on holiday. As the school grew in fame and its numbers increased, the workload became more onerous, but a regular flow of prominent speakers, interesting students, and lively visitors ensured an exciting and dynamic atmosphere.<br>
<br>The school remained open largely owing to money raised during fund-raising trips to the United States, and it slipped into further financial difficulties after the execution in May 1916 of Patrick and Willie Pearse for their involvement in the Easter rising. Deeply distressed by their deaths, Margaret Pearse devoted most of the rest of her life to preserving her brothers' memory and acting&#151;with her mother&#151;as custodian of their legacy. They attempted to have the brothers' bodies released to the family for burial, but their request was refused as the corpses had been buried after execution in lime and the authorities feared in any case that their graves would became martyrs' shrines. Margaret Pearse and her mother channelled their grief into attempting to keep St Enda's running, a difficult task as Patrick Pearse had died intestate and the school was in serious debt. Some relief arrived in the form of bequests and donations, but constant quarrels over how the money should be spent plagued his sister and mother. The American St Enda's committee raised enough money to buy the school grounds and further funds were accumulated during Margaret Pearse's tour of America in 1926, but the women resented the involvement of various committees in the school's finances and general ethos. The school's standards slipped and both women were stretched beyond their abilities as staff shortages necessitated their increasing involvement in teaching and administration. It became clear to most observers that the school could simply not function without the involvement and guidance of Patrick Pearse.<br>
<br>Family dynamics became strained as Margaret Pearse became increasingly estranged from her younger sister, Mary, who had opposed her brothers' militarism and was in any case prone to anxiety and hypochondria. There were also disputes about the royalties from their brother's writings. Margaret Pearse and her mother became increasingly religious, pouring their energies into piety, prayer, and the glorification of their relatives' political actions. Some critics believed that the Pearse women had adopted a proprietarial attitude to the Easter rising, and that their family's part in the rebellion had been glorified at the expense of other insurgents. Certainly, both women did not hesitate to condemn anyone who questioned the reputation of the Pearse brothers. Their steadfast loyalty to their own version of Easter week and its legacy was reflected in their political careers. Mrs Pearse was elected to the D&aacute;il in 1919 and following her death Margaret Pearse was elected for the same co. Dublin seat in 1933. She also took her mother's place on the executive of Fianna F&aacute;il, a party to which she remained intensely loyal. Both were staunch supporters of Eamon De Valera, believing that he had attempted to sustain Patrick Pearse's political vision. It would be difficult to describe either woman as anything more than a figurehead for the party. In common with a number of other female relatives of the nationalist dead, their presence in the Irish parliament was little more than symbolic.<br>
<br>Margaret Pearse was elected to the senate in 1938, and served until her death. She had inherited St Enda's on her mother's death, but was finally forced to close the school in 1935, besieged to the end by financial worries. She nevertheless lived virtually alone in the main school house, though it had been vandalized by Black and Tans in the 1920s, and had continued to slide into further disrepair. She died, unmarried, at the Linden Convalescent Home, Blackrock, co. Dublin, on 7 November 1968 and was accorded a state funeral. The house was bequeathed finally and characteristically to the Irish nation as a monument to the memory of her brothers.<br>
