<span class="headword">Allcroft,  John Derby</span>  (1822&#150;1893), <span class="occ">glove manufacturer and entrepreneur</span>, was born in Worcester on 19 July 1822, only son and elder child of Jeremiah Macklin Allcroft (1791&#150;1867), who was a partner in the glove manufacturing firm of J. and W. Dent &amp; Co. His mother, Hannah (1801&#150;1836), was the daughter of Thomas Derby of Birmingham, and niece of the artist William Derby. In 1854 Allcroft married Mary Annette, daughter of the Revd Thomas Martin, but she died childless in 1857. His second wife was Mary Ann Jewell (1833&#150;1895), daughter of John Blundell of Timsbury Manor, Hampshire. The couple were married in August 1864; they had four sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>After completing his education, Allcroft joined his father's firm, building up the London end of the business with such diligence and success that, when the partners retired in 1846, he and three other employees bought the company. With the name changed to Dent, Allcroft &amp; Co., the metropolitan end was further expanded, moving from small premises in Friday Street to a new warehouse and headquarters in Wood Street, Cheapside. Under Allcroft's direction the organization flourished and, anticipating the growing demand for gloves, he centralized and streamlined the three Worcester factories to concentrate on the efficient production of quality goods. The advent of the railway to the town in the 1850s aided the growth of the business, and Allcroft eventually became a shareholder in seven different railway companies. By the 1870s his British employees numbered over 1000, and more factories had been opened. With new outlets and factories in New York and continental cities, the company became the pre-eminent glove manufacturers in the world. Allcroft ran the business until his retirement in 1873 when, as sole partner, his capital holding was &pound;500,000.<br>
<br>As a devout evangelical Christian, Allcroft's religious faith was central to his life. He built and endowed three churches in London: St Martin's, Gospel Oak (1865), St Jude's, South Kensington (1870), and St Matthew's, Bayswater (1881), together with mission rooms in Worcester and Stokesay village. He donated funds for the founding and repair of several other churches, including Onibury church on his Shropshire estate. On his retirement from business he became the treasurer of Christ's Hospital, of which he had been a governor since 1849. He was chairman of the Church Pastoral Aid Society, vice-president of the Church Association, and was instrumental in the founding of the YMCA.<br>
<br>Allcroft's London home was in Lancaster Gate, but in 1869 he acquired the estate of Stokesay Castle, Shropshire. After the subsequent purchase of two neighbouring estates, Allcroft commissioned Thomas Harris in 1887 to design a great Jacobean-style mansion. Furnished and fitted by well-known, mainly metropolitan companies, and including such innovative features as integral electric light, the mansion cost a total of about &pound;500,000. The family moved into the new Stokesay Court in 1892, but Allcroft himself died before the interior was properly completed.<br>
<br>Allcroft regularly bought paintings at the Royal Academy summer exhibition. He chose works by established contemporary painters, such as T. S. Cooper, from whom he purchased and commissioned nine major works. He was known as a benevolent patron of artists he particularly admired.<br>
<br>Allcroft was Conservative MP for Worcester from 1878 to 1880, and served as lieutenant for the City of London from 1879 to his death. He was a JP for Shropshire and its sheriff in 1893, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical and Royal Astronomical societies. Initiated into freemasonry in 1846, he belonged to four lodges. In 1883 he was elected to the office of grand treasurer and became chairman for the anniversary festival of the Royal Masonic Benevolent Institution. He helped found the Derby Allcroft Lodge, Worcester, becoming worshipful master in 1886.<br>
<br>Allcroft died at 108 Lancaster Gate, London, on 29 July 1893. A preliminary funeral service was held at St Matthew's Church, Bayswater; following a second service he was buried at St Michael's Church, Onibury. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
