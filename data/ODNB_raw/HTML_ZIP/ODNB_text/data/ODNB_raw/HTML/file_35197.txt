<span class="headword">Craven,  Henry Thornton</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Henry Thornton]</span>  (1818&#150;1905), <span class="occ">playwright and actor</span>, was born on 26 February 1818 in Great Poland Street, London, the son of Robert Thornton, a schoolteacher in Holborn. After working as a publisher's clerk in Paternoster Row, Henry was amanuensis to Bulwer Lytton, and began writing for <span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span>. In 1840 he made his first appearance on the stage, at York, and in 1841 he appeared on the Sunderland circuit, and at the Theatre Royal, Liverpool, Rochester, and Tunbridge Wells. In 1842 he made his London d&eacute;but at Fanny Kelly's theatre in Soho, and his first play, <span class="italic">Bertram the Avenger</span>, was produced at North Shields. His second play, <span class="italic">Miserrimus</span>, was produced at Portsmouth late in 1843.<br>
<br>From 1842 to 1850 Craven performed at the Adelphi, Strand, Covent Garden, Lyceum, City of London, Marylebone, and Princess's theatres. His plays were produced at the Theatre Royal, Liverpool, the Adelphi, Edinburgh, and the City of London, Strand, Grecian, and Adelphi theatres in London. In 1850 he was engaged at Drury Lane, where, at William Macready's farewell on 26 February 1851, he played Malcolm to Macready's Macbeth. On 12 June 1851 he appeared in his operetta, <span class="italic">The Village Nightingale</span>, at the Strand. <a name="cosubject_35197"></a><span class="headword">Eliza Nelson</span>  (1827&#150;1908), <span class="occ">singer and actor</span>, daughter of Sydney Nelson, the composer, and his wife, Sarah, took the leading female role. In November 1851 the two were engaged by Lloyd of Edinburgh for the Theatre Royal company, Craven as principal stage director. They were married in Edinburgh on 12 May 1852.<br>
<br>In June 1854 the Cravens left for Australia. From 1854 to 1856 they were engaged at the Royal Victoria Theatre, Sydney. As well as performing in a standard repertoire of comedy and farce (including Craven's plays <span class="italic">My Daughter's Debut</span>, <span class="italic">The Card Case</span>, and <span class="italic">Tic doloreux</span>), the Cravens appeared in special seasons with Australian theatrical manager George Coppin, and tragic actor Gustavus Vaughan Brooke. In April 1857 the Cravens made their farewell at Coppin's Theatre Royal, Melbourne. On their return to London, Eliza Nelson withdrew from performing, while Henry Craven continued to write and perform his own comedies, including the successful <span class="italic">The Post Boy</span> (Strand, 1860) and <span class="italic">The Chimney Corner</span> (Olympic, 1861), both written for Frederick Robson. Craven's plans for retirement were changed with the sudden death of Robson on 6 August 1864. His play <span class="italic">Milky White</span> had opened at the Prince of Wales's, Liverpool on 20 June 1864 with Robson in the title role. Craven took over the part for the London production at the Strand (28 September 1864), and established the most memorable role of his career. In the dual role of actor and playwright Craven scored again at the new Royalty on 17 October 1866 with <span class="italic">Meg's Diversion</span>, which ran for 330 nights, with himself as Jasper Pidgeon. In 1873 he made his last provincial tour. His last play, a historical drama, <span class="italic">Too True</span>, was produced at the Duke's on 22 January 1876, and in this he made his final appearance on the stage.<br>
<br>Henry Craven's career was typical of the theatre of the mid-nineteenth century. He was a versatile actor, performing in high and low comedy, as well as tragedy, and was prepared to travel extensively. He was a prolific playwright, producing twenty-nine plays between 1842 and 1876, many of them published by Lacy, Duncombe, and French, and a novel, <span class="italic">The Old Tune</span> (1876). His plays, mostly domestic comedies with a strong love story, produce humour from differences in class and education between lovers. Eliza Nelson combined success in domestic comedy with abilities as a singer of popular songs and opera.<br>
<br>Craven died at his residence, Thorntonville, Clapham Park, London, on 13 April 1905, and Eliza Nelson died at Eastbourne on 20 March 1908. Both were buried in Norwood cemetery, London. Two of their four children survived them, a daughter and a son, Tom Sidney Craven (<i>b</i>. 1864), who became a playwright and actor.<br>
