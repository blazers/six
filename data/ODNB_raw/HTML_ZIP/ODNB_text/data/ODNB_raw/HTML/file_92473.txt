<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Orl&eacute;ans,  Louis Philippe Albert  d'</span>, count of Paris in the Orleanist French nobility  (1838&#150;1894), <span class="occ">pretender to the French throne and exile</span>, was born at the Palace of the Tuileries in Paris on 24 August 1838, the elder son of Ferdinand Philippe Louis, duke of Orl&eacute;ans (1810&#150;1842), heir to his father, Louis Philippe (<i>d</i>. 1850), styled king of the French under the July monarchy (1830&#150;48), and his wife, Helene Luise Elisabeth, princess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1814&#150;1858). As a child, the count of Paris was present with his mother in the chamber of deputies on 24 February 1848 when the mob ended an attempt to constitute a regency during his minority after his grandfather had fled before the popular uprising in the capital. The exiled duchess of Orl&eacute;ans settled in England, where her son was to spend the greater part of his life. Educated mainly by tutors, and widely travelled, his upbringing after 1848 was that of a pretender, resident for a while with his small court at Claremont House, near Esher in Surrey, an English royal residence made available to King Louis Philippe and his family by a sympathetic Queen Victoria. A serious-minded youth, he always remained something of a political innocent, although intellectual tastes as well as his inherited role directed him to the study of evolving democracy on both sides of the Atlantic. A formative experience was his service in 1861&#150;2 with the federal armies in the American Civil War on the staff of General George B. McClellan. For Paris as for others, the conflict proved that Christianity could not indefinitely tolerate the institution of slavery. Moreover, the victory of the north inflicted an ideological reverse on the &#145;Caesarism&#146; of the contemporary ruler of France, Napoleon III, who backed the confederacy  (Paris, <span class="italic">Histoire de la Guerre Civile</span>, 4.667; 1.398).<br>
<br>An Orleanist pretender did not present a real threat to the Second Empire, which had confiscated his French estates; the legitimists, partisans of the elder branch of Bourbons, overshadowed their dynastic rivals. The acceptance of Paris and other members of his family in English, and more especially whig, society had no political implications, but it confirmed the Anglophile tendency of his line. The patronage of Lady Waldegrave brought him into contact with leading politicians on the Liberal side, Gladstone among them. Yet he was well aware that the cautiously progressive liberalism of the English political class, Liberal and tory alike, was not a plant easily transferable to his native country with her history of enmities that did not admit of compromise. Irish disestablishment prompted the reflection, unusual in a devout Catholic then, that in France too the union of church and state had been &#145;equally prejudicial to both&#146;  (Paris to Reeve, 26 July 1868, <span class="italic">Memoirs &hellip; of Henry Reeve</span>, 2.143&#150;4). The convictions of French monarchists precluded such radicalism on his part when the fall of Napoleon III in 1870 and the childlessness of the last of the elder branch established Paris as the count of Chambord's designated successor at the head of an outwardly, at least, unified movement. An unashamed reactionary, Chambord held out few concessions to his kinsman, whose submission in 1873 attracted some telling criticisms in England. The Orleanists were badly compromised, wrote the fifteenth earl of Derby, by the sacrifice of their liberal strain of monarchism  (2 Nov 1873, <span class="italic">Selection from the Diaries</span>, 148). The prince of Wales, the future Edward VII, had earlier taken it upon himself to advocate replacing Paris as the bearer of the Orleanist tradition by his formidable uncle, the duc d'Aumale, who was close to being a republican  (Granville to Gladstone, 18 Nov 1870, <span class="italic">Political Correspondence</span>, 1.160). A friendly majority in the national assembly permitted Paris to return to France and restored the unsold portion of his estates (1871&#150;2), where he spent a decade in semi-retirement, working on his still useful narrative of the American Civil War in seven volumes, which, though primarily a military history, ascribed the federals' success to the vitality of their free institutions. The prince of Wales appeared to have been justified in dismissing Paris's potential for leadership: &#145;as to the Comte &hellip; people must look out for themselves these days&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>On Chambord's death in 1883, however, Paris showed himself capable of organizing a monarchist revival on a scale that provoked a government of the left to send &#145;Philippe VII&#146; into exile again three years later. At the outset the British foreign secretary, Lord Granville, thought the pretender had &#145;a difficult game to play&#146;, but one that he might conceivably win if he could appeal to moderate supporters of the republic frightened by the temper of the left  (Granville to Reeve, 29 Sept 1883, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 2.317). This Paris felt unable to do: like some of his whig friends in England he came to believe that the restraint of the liberalism he and they embodied was out of date, on either side of the channel. There was no option but to side with the &#145;big battalions&#146;, he told Henry Reeve of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, and to employ those methods of animating a mass electorate which he nevertheless deplored in the later Gladstone  (Paris to Reeve, 18, 21 Sept 1885, ibid. 331&#150;4). Banished to England for a second time, in 1886, he lent his authority to collaboration between the monarchists and General Boulanger in 1888&#150;9, meeting the general in London to further their common aim of overthrowing the Third Republic. The ignominious collapse of Boulangism was fatal to Paris's cause, discredited by his uncharacteristic readiness to set aside the constitutionalism of a lifetime. &#145;The nemesis of lost opportunities and deserted ideals&#146; claimed him  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 10 Sept 1894).<br>
<br>Yet Paris remained true to his ideals in important respects. He used his influence on the right to contain the dangerous colonial rivalry between France and England. Alarmed by his country's isolation in the 1870s and 1880s, he welcomed the efforts of Salisbury and Gladstone to preserve &#145;the equilibrium of the Continent&#146; amid the rising tensions of the period, as he did England's refusal to &#145;become the accomplice or the dupe&#146; of Bismarck. He regretted the Anglo-French antagonism in Egypt where, in his view, the situation might have provided the basis for an entente, if properly handled, but it was one that &#145;we have made such a mess of&#146;  (Paris to Reeve, 12 April 1880, 18 July 1883, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 2.276, 315&#150;16). When they saw each other at Cannes in 1883, Gladstone rewarded Paris with information that had come to hand about the republicans' intentions towards him (Gladstone to Paris, 10 Feb 1883, Gladstone, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 10.405&#150;6; Paris to Gladstone, 10 Feb 1883, BL, Add. MS 44479). The count's was not an outlook that sat easily with the chauvinism and cynicism of General Boulanger.<br>
<br>The last of Paris's failures, if that is what it was, followed the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle of Boulangism. One of his daughters with his cousin (Marie) Isabelle Fran&ccedil;oise d'Assise d'Orl&eacute;ans-Montpensier (1848&#150;1919), whom he had married on 30 May 1864, was the wife of Carlos I of Portugal; another, and splendid, dynastic alliance encountered the inflexible opposition of Lord Salisbury, then prime minister. The countess of Paris, a strong-willed woman, unafraid to smoke a pipe or cigars in company, took advantage of the English royal family's anxiety to find an intelligent bride for the prince of Wales's unpromising elder son, Albert Victor, duke of Clarence. Her daughter H&eacute;l&egrave;ne, well known at the English court, was an admirable candidate but for her Catholicism. This obstacle the countess and H&eacute;l&egrave;ne, who shared her mother's ambitions for their family, proposed to remove by the latter's reception into the established church, and an informal engagement ensued. Salisbury's personal distaste for such a calculated switch of religious allegiance, his belief that the match would be unpopular, and the reaction of the French government might not have been enough to stop the marriage  (<span class="italic">Salisbury&#150;Balfour Correspondence</span>, 317&#150;31, <i>passim</i>). As it was, the count of Paris asserted himself and ruled out conversion.<br>
<br>The shock of the &#145;June days&#146; of 1848 made the French right open to ideas of social reform suspect to their bourgeois opponents. The youthful count of Paris looked to the land of his exile for a lasting solution to a fundamental conflict which in England had very largely died out with the passing of Chartism  (Paris to Gladstone, 30 May 1869, BL, Add. MS 44420). He was deeply impressed by what he found on a visit to Lancashire in the cotton famine of the 1860s: nothing less, it seemed to him, than a triumph of class collaboration in the face of adversity. The rich lived up to their social responsibilities and organized relief across the region for workers whose self-discipline and unshaken loyalty to the political order was emphasized by a propensity to sing &#145;God Save the Queen&#146; at their demonstrations. Where the English had led, the French must follow  (For&ccedil;ade, 703&#150;4, 675&#150;6). His book <span class="italic">The Trades' Unions of England</span> (1869) was an effective contribution to the debate on the labour laws that produced and accompanied the royal commission of 1867&#150;9. Within months of its publication in France it had gone through six editions there and was to be translated into German and Spanish. The significance of the English version that appeared in the same year for friends of the unions is clear from the introduction provided by its editor, Thomas Hughes MP. The Webbs wrongly dismissed this short study as little better than a summary of evidence to the commission  (Webb and Webb, 227 n. 1). Hughes singled out the way in which the count had put the problem of labour and its rights in the wider context of &#145;public meeting, free discussion, and an unshackled press&#146;, none of which were features of Napoleon III's France  (<span class="italic">Trades' Unions of England</span>, xiii). Paris himself observed that the evidence amassed by the commission did not adequately reflect the underlying cause and condition of trade union advance, &#145;political liberty, and the various rights secured by it&#146;  (ibid., 230). For this insight he was praised by, among others, George Rickards, a lawyer and economist without Hughes's radical sympathies: it was really the central point in the debate  (<span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, 130, October 1869, 399).<br>
<br>Paris deserves to be remembered in England for his rationale of trade unions in a free society such as he hoped France would become. He was altogether too English for his countrymen. The life of this prince, the last Bourbon to offer a credible alternative to the French republic, testified to the attractions of Victorian England's political culture for a thoughtful descendant of Louis XIV. Lacking the talent, or at any rate the luck, to exploit the chances he was given, he yet belonged to his time, and not to the past in which French monarchists tended to dwell. Someone with few intimates, he possessed a saving sense of the ridiculous and collected caricatures of himself. He had a good head for business, dying one of the richest men in Europe with a fortune approaching &pound;4 million spread over several countries.<br>
<br>After his marriage in 1864 Paris purchased York House, Twickenham, where he lived until his return to France in 1871. During his second period of exile, he resided for four years (1886&#150;90) at Sheen House, Richmond, and spent his last years, from November 1890, amid the splendours of Stowe House, Buckinghamshire, leased from its owner since the death of the third duke of Buckingham. He died at Stowe on 8 September 1894 after a long illness, survived by his widow and five of his eight children. His remains, interred at the Catholic church in Weybridge, Surrey, were moved in 1958 to the mausoleum of his family at Dreux, Eure-et-Loir.<br>
