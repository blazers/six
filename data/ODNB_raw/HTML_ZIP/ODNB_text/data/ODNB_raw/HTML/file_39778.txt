<span class="headword">Fulhame,  Elizabeth</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Mrs Fulhame]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1780&#150;1794), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was an original chemist but little else is known of her life. Her husband, Thomas Fulhame, had come from Ireland and enrolled in the chemistry class at Edinburgh University in 1779&#150;80. He graduated MD in 1784 and, unusually, retained a presence in the chemistry class until 1790. He travelled or lived briefly in Spain, and was a correspondent of Joseph Black, the Edinburgh physician and chemist, who in 1793 noted that Fulhame had found a new method of manufacturing white lead. Elizabeth Fulhame presumably shared her husband's interests, for in 1794 she published a remarkable monograph, <span class="italic">An essay on combustion with a view to a new art of dying and painting wherein the phlogistic and antiphlogistic hypotheses are proved erroneous</span>. This book later appeared in German translation (G&ouml;ttingen, 1798) and in an American edition (Philadelphia, 1810). It was favourably noticed by Priestley, Rumford, Herschel, Woodhouse, and others and was the subject of a long review by Coindet.<br>
<br>In her preface the author remarked that in 1780 her husband had deemed improbable &#145;the possibility of making cloths of gold, silver, and other metals, by chemical processes&#146;. In spite of such connubial discouragement and &#145;an expense so disproportionate to the fortune which supported it&#146; she persevered. Such perseverance does not surprise, for the preface reveals a formidably assured woman who stated frankly: &#145;I published this essay in its present imperfect state, in order to prevent the furacious attempts of the prowling plagiary, and the insidious pretender to chymistry, from arrogating to themselves and assuming my invention in plundering silence&#146;. She was well aware of the criticism she might receive from opponents, especially as a woman writing on controversial subjects, and took the robust line that<blockquote>censure is perhaps inevitable; for some are so ignorant, that they grow sullen and silent, and are chilled with horror at the sight of any thing that bears the semblance of learning, in whatever shape it may appear; and should the <i>spectre</i> appear in the shape of <i>woman</i>, the pangs which they suffer are truly dismal.</blockquote>Driving the point home she went on to declare that: &#145;happen what may, I hope I shall never experience such desertion of mind, as not to hold the helm with becoming fortitude against the storm raised by ignorance, petulant arrogance, and privileged dulness&#146;. It is perhaps not entirely fortuitous that her book was sold by Joseph Johnson, the publisher of Thomas Paine, Joseph Priestley, and Mary Wollstonecraft.<br>
<br>The body of the book details the approach Mrs Fulhame took towards the attainment of her original goal, her crowning achievement being the production of cloth &#145;maps, the rivers of which are represented in silver, and the cities in gold&#146;. The lengthy, systematic study of the action of various reducing agents (hydrogen, sulphur, phosphorus, charcoal, even light) on metallic salts in aqueous, alcoholic, and ethereal solution was unusual, even unique, for its time. Several incidental observations&#151;the passivation of iron, the production of colloidal gold, and the formation of images by the action of light&#151;have been viewed as foreshadowing discoveries made later and assigned to others. Indeed, late twentieth-century histories of photography include Mrs Fulhame.<br>
<br>Perhaps the most remarkable feature of this remarkable book are Mrs Fulhame's imaginative and iconoclastic views on the nature of combustion, the central problem of late eighteenth-century chemistry. Clearly she was fully familiar with the contending phlogistic and anti-phlogistic theories of those chemically revolutionary years. She postulates a reaction sequence in which water plays the role of what would later be termed a catalyst. No wonder Rumford called her &#145;the lively and ingenious Mrs Fulhame&#146;. She concludes her essay with an early statement of the ecological dogma:<blockquote>This view of combustion may serve to show how nature is always the same, and maintains her equilibrium by preserving the same quantities of air and water on the surface of our globe: for as fast as these are consumed in the various processes of combustion, equal quantities are formed, and rise regenerated like the Phenix from her ashes.</blockquote>In quoting this paragraph, J. R. Partington, the historian of chemistry, added the footnote: &#145;The phoenix, it may be noted, was a fabulous bird regarded as sexless&#146;  (Partington, 3.708&#150;9). Mrs Fulhame would not have been amused.<br>
<br>No other work by Mrs Fulhame exists, and attempts to locate her biographically have so far proven fruitless. Of her significance and interest there is, however, no doubt.<br>
