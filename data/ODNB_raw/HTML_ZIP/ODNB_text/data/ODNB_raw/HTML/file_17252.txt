<span class="headword">Lynam,  Robert</span>  (1796&#150;1845), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and literary editor</span>, was born in London on 14 April 1796, the son of Charles Lynam, spectacle maker, of the parish of St Alphage, London Wall. Lynam was admitted to Christ's Hospital in March 1806, where he passed as a Grecian in 1814. He graduated BA from Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1818 and proceeded MA in 1821. In 1818 he was appointed assistant mathematical master at Christ's Hospital, and was promoted to fourth grammar master in 1820. Having previously taken orders, he resigned the post in 1832 for that of assistant chaplain and secretary to the Magdalen Hospital. It is not known when Lynam married but in 1828 his wife gave birth to a daughter.<br>
<br>Lynam is chiefly remembered as an editor. While working at Christ's Hospital he edited Charles Rollin's <span class="italic">Ancient History</span> (1823), <span class="italic">The Complete Works of &hellip; Philip Skelton</span> (1824), <span class="italic">The Complete Works of William Payley</span> (1825), and <span class="italic">The Works of Samuel Johnson</span> (1825). Lynam's career as a writer includes a collection of sermons and the succinct <span class="italic">History of England during the Reign of George III</span> (1825), but his most significant work was <span class="italic">The History of the Roman Emperors, from Augustus to the Death of Marcus Antonius</span> (1850). His self-confessed purpose was to fill a gap left by Hooke and Gibbon &#145;with the object of connecting the History of the Roman Republic with the History of the Decline and fall of the Roman Empire&#146;  (preface, <span class="italic">History of Roman Emperors</span>). <span class="italic">The History</span> was praised by the editor, the Revd John T. White of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, who claimed that Lynam's &#145;depth of reflection satisfies the most acute and penetrating reader, and at the same time the pomp and harmony of his language gives pleasure to the most critical ear, and the most refined taste&#146;  (ibid.). However, it attracted little critical attention when it was published posthumously, perhaps because it had the misfortune to appear almost simultaneously with Merivale's <span class="italic">Romans under the Empire</span>.<br>
<br>Lynam remained active in the church. He was made St Matthew's day preacher at Christ's Hospital in 1821 and 1835. He was subsequently curate and lecturer of St Giles Cripplegate until his death. He died from lung and liver disease on 12 October 1845 at 4 Bridgewater Square, St Giles Cripplegate, London. He was survived by his wife and nine children.<br>
