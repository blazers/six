<span class="headword">Appleton,  Honor Charlotte</span>  (1879&#150;1951), <span class="occ">artist in black and white</span>, was born on 4 February 1879 at 30 St Michael's Place, Brighton, Sussex, one of four children of John Hoblyn Appleton (1834/5&#150;1881), formerly vicar of St Mark's, Staplefield, Sussex, and his wife, Georgina Rachel Maud, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wilkie. As a child she enjoyed playing with her two older sisters, Rachel and Alice Mary, and her younger brother, John. She painted watercolours while still a young girl (including a small one dated 1888 depicting two &#145;Kate Greenaway&#146; little girls in bonnets). After attending the art branch of the South Kensington Schools she went on to Frank Calderon's school of animal painting, and then in 1901 enrolled with her sister Alice at the Royal Academy Schools.<br>
<br>Appleton started her career as an illustrator in 1902, while a student at the Royal Academy Schools, writing as well as illustrating <span class="italic">The Bad Mrs. Ginger</span> (the first of several books that she wrote for children). Her next important illustrative work was for an edition of William Blake's <span class="italic">Songs of Innocence</span> in 1910. She was also a watercolour painter who exhibited at the Royal Academy, but for more than forty years she was primarily an illustrator of books for young children. She illustrated over 150 children's books, using delicate watercolours and black and white pen drawings, and on a few occasions using pen and wash. Very businesslike as an illustrator, she spent long hours studying children at play. She is best known for her illustrations to the &#145;Josephine&#146; books by Mrs Henry Craddock, which are all concerned with a small girl playing with her family of dolls, including a sailor-suited duck called Quackie Jack who appears in many of the books in the series. David Wootton wrote that Appleton's images depict for the most part &#145;an exquisitely naturalistic depiction of the girl's life, only occasionally&#151;but increasingly&#151;suggesting that the dolls with which she plays are also alive&#146;  (Wootton, 136). She used outline drawings in black and white, and soft colours for the plates. Her illustrations were often from a floor-level viewpoint that showed adults from the knees down and appealed to young children, who naturally had the same perspective. Some of her other work, particularly the colour illustrations, has been criticized for its vague and pretty romanticism and lack of definition. Fiona Halpin, however, in an exhibition catalogue issued in 1990 justly praised the Josephine illustrations for capturing &#145;the air of innocence inherent in children without clouding it in sentimentality&#146;  (Halpin, [p. 4]).<br>
<br>Appleton, who did not marry, died on 30 December 1951 at Brooklands Nursing Home, Haywards Heath, Sussex, having lived for the whole of her working career at 3 Ventnor Villas, Hove. She died just before she could see a planned exhibition of seventy-two of her original paintings for illustrations which was held at Hove Public Library in 1952 and later displayed in galleries around Britain.<br>
