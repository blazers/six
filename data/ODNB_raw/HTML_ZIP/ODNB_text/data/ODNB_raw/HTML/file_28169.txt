<span class="headword">Veal <span class="st"> [Veel]</span>,  Edward</span>  (1632/3&#150;1708), <span class="occ">clergyman, ejected minister, and nonconformist tutor</span>, is of uncertain origins. He is perhaps the son of the Lancashire gentleman Edward Veal of Laughton who was an elder of the seventh Lancashire classis in 1646. It has, however, also been suggested that he was probably born in Gloucestershire. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 27 February 1651, graduating BA in 1652 and proceeding MA on 21 February 1654. From 1655 he was minister of Dunboyne, co. Meath, on a stipend of &pound;40 per annum under the civil establishment of Henry Cromwell; he was ordained at Winwick, Lancashire, by the fourth Lancashire presbyterian classis on a call from his Irish parish on 14 August 1657. Nevertheless, in March 1655 it was by a petition of the Independent churches of Ireland that Veal was proposed as one of a raft of eight men suitable to remedy the lack of godly fellows at Trinity College, Dublin, and was duly one of the five elected fellows; he had been promoted to a senior fellowship by 24 November 1656. He was created BD there on 3 July 1661. Shortly afterwards he was deprived of both parish and fellowship for his nonconformity to the re-established Church of Ireland and, having received a certificate (dated 31 December 1661) testifying to his usefulness from Stephen Charnock and six other nonconformist divines, he left Ireland in January 1662. The certificate described him as:<blockquote>a learned, orthodox, and ordained minister, of a sober, pious and peaceable conversation, who during his abode in the college, was eminently useful for the instruction of youth, and whose ministry hath been often exercised &hellip; with great satisfaction to the Godly. (Calamy, <span class="italic">Continuation</span>, 1.83)</blockquote>He became chaplain to the former parliamentarian general Sir William Waller, after whose death in 1668 he became pastor to a small congregation in the East End of London. In 1669 it was reported that at Stepney &#145;one Mr Veale, an Independent hath lately set up a meeting in this parish, And first sollicited for Subscriptions, before he would come&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>, 501). This must be the same meeting over which he presided (if not in precisely the same location) near or in Globe Alley, Wapping; that was broken up by the authorities in 1670 but Veal took out a licence as its presbyterian minister under the declaration of indulgence two years later. In 1689 he was certified as a preacher in the parish of Whitechapel (consistent with the congregation at Wapping, to which he himself alluded in 1703). He also ran an academy at Wapping for ministerial students, for which he suffered prosecution. Among his pupils were Samuel Wesley (<i>bap</i>. 1662, <i>d</i>. 1735), the father of John and Charles Wesley; despite his later career in the Church of England, at the time that he attended Veal's academy in the late 1670s Wesley was intended for the Independent ministry. Veal gave up the academy about 1680. The apparent ambiguities over his denominational label reflect, no doubt, both the insensitivities and carelessness in reporting of the authorities and even more the fluidities of association within Restoration dissent. It is probably most significant that Veal was co-editor of works by Stephen Charnock, like himself an Independent in Ireland in the 1650s who found himself comfortable within Restoration presbyterianism; he also contributed along with other presbyterian divines to the continuation of Matthew Poole's <span class="italic">Annotations upon the Holy Bible</span> (1683).<br>
<br>Having lost his voice &#145;and ability to speak out of the pulpit&#146; and having &#145;thought fit to supply the want of it&#146;, Veal published <span class="italic">Practical Discourses</span> on sin, wickedness, and Christ as healer and saviour  (Veel, sig. A2). Another volume of <span class="italic">Practical Discourses</span> followed in 1705. Besides these he wrote many sermons on a variety of topics such as &#145;what spiritual knowledge they ought to seek for that desire to be saved&#146;. Many of these were published in the various editions of the <span class="italic">Morning Exercises</span>, the majority being republished in James Nichols's <span class="italic">The Morning Exercises at Cripplegate</span> (1844).<br>
<br>By late November 1705, when he made his will, Veal had retired south of the river to suburban Peckham. His wife (whose name is unknown) had died before him and the only kin mentioned in his will were a sister, Martha, to whom he left &pound;5 for mourning and &#145;my Pools Annotations on the Scripture in two Volumes in Folio&#146;; his widowed sister-in-law; and his unmarried daughter, Katherine, who received the bulk of the estate  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/502, sig. 157). Veal died on 6 June 1708, aged seventy-five. He had originally wished to be buried in Battersea, but was in fact buried in the parish church of Wapping on 13 June. His funeral sermon was preached by Thomas Simmons, his successor as pastor to the Wapping congregation. Preaching on a text from <span class="roman">2 Timothy</span>, Simmons declared that &#145;every part of the apostle's character may be accommodated to the case of our deceased friend and father&#146; who had been &#145;very laborious in his attempts to pull down the strongholds of sin and Satan, in the souls of other men&#146;  (Simmons, 41&#150;2).<br>
