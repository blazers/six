<span class="headword">Whittard,  Walter Frederick</span>  (1902&#150;1966), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born on 26 October 1902, in Battersea, London, the youngest of four children of Thomas Walter Whittard, a successful grocer of Clapham, and his wife, Sarah Cotterell.<br>
<br>Whittard attended the county secondary school at Battersea where he was a founder member of the school natural history society. While still at school, he was introduced to T. Eastwood of the Geological Survey who inspired in Whittard an interest in geology and advised him to attend evening classes in geology at Chelsea Polytechnic. There began a lifelong friendship with geologists Oliver Bulman and C. J. Stubblefield. In 1920 he began full-time study at Chelsea Polytechnic. In 1922 he became a student in the geology department of Imperial College under Professor William Watts and obtained in 1924 first-class honours in geology and zoology in the ARCS examinations and also in geology in his external London BSc. Attendance while an undergraduate at David Watson's lectures (at University College, London) enlarged his interest in palaeontology and this remained with him throughout his life, leading to a succession of papers which included important contributions to the study of trilobites.<br>
<br>With the award in 1924 of a Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) scholarship, Whittard began his researches on the Valentian rocks of Shropshire under the supervision of Watts, while also pursuing part-time research under Watson on fossil Amphibia. Whittard's investigations of the Lower Palaeozoic rocks of Shropshire continued throughout his life. In two years he gained his London PhD and in 1926 he entered Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, with a senior DSIR award. Here he joined in the social life with vigour and rowed for his college with distinction. Nevertheless, he completed his work for a Cambridge PhD within two years, and published the first of his major papers on the Valentian rocks of Shropshire (1928). He visited east Greenland as chief geologist to the 1929 Cambridge expedition under J. M. Wordie. This was an experience he greatly valued and he subsequently encouraged his staff and students to join expeditions to Greenland. The same year he was awarded an 1851 senior studentship at Imperial College to continue his Shropshire work and in 1930 he received the Daniel Pidgeon award of the Geological Society. It was in 1930 that he married Caroline Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1978), daughter of Albert William Sheppard, an engineer. They later had one son.<br>
<br>In 1931 Whittard was appointed assistant lecturer in geology at Imperial College and in 1935 to a lectureship. In 1937, at the early age of thirty-four, he accepted the chair of geology at Bristol University, made vacant by the move of Arthur E. Trueman to the University of Glasgow. He remained at Bristol for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Until 1960 Whittard returned regularly to Shropshire to continue mapping and collecting and he became the recognized expert on the geology of the area. His work on the extraordinarily rich harvest of fossils collected over four decades reached its acme with the monograph on the Shelve trilobites, published in eight parts between 1955 and 1966 and effectively complete when he died, although a synthesis of the geology was never finished.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Whittard was geological adviser to the south-west region of England dealing with problems ranging from the cutting of quartz oscillator plates to water supply. From the mid-1950s he became increasingly involved in marine geology, mapping the geology of the English Channel. The results of this work, which partly appeared in published maps in 1962 and 1965, formed the basis of the subsequent joint Anglo-French map of the English Channel.<br>
<br>Whittard was a most efficient administrator. He built up and ran well a happy department, enlarged threefold during his leadership, served on numerous committees, and executed the move of the department of geology from its old and cramped accommodation into the well-designed Queen's Building in 1958. He simultaneously pursued his research, and was able so to do largely because of his natural energy, the long hours he worked, and his remarkable ability to switch his mind back to research from administrative detail almost immediately. His main recreation was gardening and he lovingly supervised the university gardens. He was a shrewd but kindly man.<br>
<br>Whittard was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1957 and in 1965 received the Murchison medal of the Geological Society. After visiting Canada in 1965 he was taken ill and died of heart failure at his home, Coombe Farm House, Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol, on 2 March 1966. He was cremated at Canford crematorium, Bristol.<br>
