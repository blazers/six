<span class="headword">McCance,  William</span>  (1894&#150;1970), <span class="occ">artist and writer on art</span>, was born on 6 August 1894 at 69 Westburn Rows, Newton, parish of Cambuslang, near Glasgow, the seventh child and youngest son of the eight children of James McCance (<i>d</i>. 1911), a coalminer who originally came from Ulster, and Elizabeth MacBride, from an Ayrshire weaving family. He was educated at Hamilton Academy and then attended the Glasgow School of Art (1911&#150;15), where he studied under Fra Newbery; he won the Haldane travelling scholarship in his last year. Following a year's teacher training at Kennedy Street School, he was imprisoned in 1917 for refusing to go on parade when serving with the Scottish Rifles. He was subsequently incarcerated in Wormwood Scrubs, Knutsford, Dartmoor, and Warwick prisons before being discharged from the army in 1920, though he married, on 6 July 1918, a former student at the Glasgow School of Art, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64830/', "Agnes Miller Parker (1895&#150;1980)")</script>, the daughter of William McCall Parker, an analytical chemist. She became one of the most distinguished wood-engravers of her generation.<br>
<br>In 1919 or 1920 McCance moved to London, and he immediately adopted the style he retained for the rest of his life; derived in part from foreign artists such as Fernand L&eacute;ger, Francis Picabia, and Albert Gleizes, it also owed much to the English vorticists of the pre-war era. (The vorticist William Roberts rented a room in the McCances' apartment at this period.) McCance began to make sculptures, such as his blocky, faceted <span class="italic">Cat</span> (1921&#150;2, priv. coll.), and became art critic of <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> (1923&#150;6). His friends included the sculptor Eric Kennington, and in 1925 his work was the subject of an article in the <span class="italic">Scottish Educational Journal</span> by Hugh MacDiarmid (writing under the name C. M. Grieve), with whom his friendship lasted forty years. In 1928 he first exhibited his work in London, in a group show with Agnes Miller Parker, Blair Hughes-Stanton, and Gertrude Hermes, at the St George's Gallery. The Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh houses a number of his works from this period, such as his <span class="italic">Study for a Colossal Steel Head</span> (1926).<br>
<br>Appointed controller of the Gregynog Press in 1930, McCance moved to Newtown, Montgomeryshire. Despite his lack of previous experience of publishing fine books, he was responsible for some magnificent productions, and himself designed a number of very successful initial letters, such as those for <span class="italic">The Fables of Esope</span> which was illustrated with woodcuts by Agnes Miller Parker. Some abstract experiments, such as <span class="italic">Speed Doodle</span> (1930), were executed with lettering pens as a result of his new interest in calligraphy and letter-forms. A passionate Scottish nationalist, he contributed an article entitled &#145;Idea in art&#146; to the <span class="italic">Modern Scot</span> (2, 1930), and cartoons in favour of social credit to the <span class="italic">Free Man</span>, such as <span class="italic">Scots! Unite!</span> which appeared on 4 February 1933.<br>
<br>After three successful years at the Gregynog Press McCance and his wife moved to Albrighton, near Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, to live in a windmill where he made terracotta portraits, masks, reclining figures, and cats, as well as paintings, monotypes, and linocuts. In 1936 they moved again, to Hambleden, near Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, where McCance became friendly with John Piper. He continued to write art criticism, and powerful articles by him on Jacob Epstein in the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> (1937) and <span class="italic">Picture Post</span> (1939) so pleased the sculptor that he reprinted them in his autobiography <span class="italic">Let there be Sculpture</span> (1942). McCance also worked on an 85,000-word treatise on art, which he finished in 1941 but which remains unpublished. In 1943 he took over from Robert Gibbings as lecturer in typography and book production at the University of Reading; his first, belated, one-man exhibition was at the Reading Art Gallery in 1960. He and Agnes Miller Parker separated in 1955, and on his retirement in 1963 he returned to Scotland, settling in Girvan, Ayrshire, following his marriage on 6 April to Dr Margaret Eva Chislett (<i>b</i>. 1926/7), a microbiologist who had also lectured at Reading; she was the daughter of Stuckey Wesley Chislett, a retired farmer. McCance's <span class="italic">Self-Portrait</span> (oils, 1916, Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh) depicts a strong, angular face, and later photographs show him bearded, with thick, wiry, upstanding hair on his vigorous head. He died at Girvan on 19 November 1970.<br>
