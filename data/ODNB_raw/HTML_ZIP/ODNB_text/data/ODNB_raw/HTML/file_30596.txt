<span class="headword">Barlow, Sir  Thomas <span class="st"> [Tommy]</span>  Dalmahoy</span>  (1883&#150;1964), <span class="occ">industrialist and banker</span>, was born in London on 23 February 1883, the second son in the family of three sons and two daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30595/', "Sir Thomas Barlow (1845&#150;1945)")</script>, physician-extraordinary to Queen Victoria and kings Edward VII and George V, and his wife, Ada Helen (1843&#150;1928), daughter of Patrick Dalmahoy, writer to the signet, of Edinburgh. Thomas's elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30594/', "Sir (James) Alan Noel Barlow (1881&#150;1968)")</script>.<br>
<br>Thomas was educated at Marlborough College (1897&#150;1900) and Trinity College, Cambridge, and then entered the century-old family textile business, Barlow and Jones Ltd, of Bolton and Manchester, where he became one of the most prominent figures in the cotton-spinning and weaving industry. In 1911 he married Esther Sophia (<i>d</i>. 1956), daughter of Henry Gaselee, barrister-at-law; they had one son and two daughters. He also became a distinguished banker, joining the board of the District Bank in 1922 and becoming its chairman in 1947.<br>
<br>The interests of Lancashire industry were close to Barlow's heart. He became chairman of the Lancashire Industrial Development Council, and from 1931 to 1933 was president of the Manchester chamber of commerce. This experience fitted him for the wartime post of director-general of civilian clothing, which he held from 1941 to 1945. Shortly after the outbreak of war he went to work at the Board of Trade when Sir Cecil Weir and Alix Kilroy (later Meynell) were setting up the control of factory and storage premises. Their work involved closing factories not required by the war effort or for essential civilian production, thus releasing both employees for essential work and premises, which could be used for the replacement of factories which had been bombed. Such buildings could also be used for storage, particularly of American materials sent to Britain before the United States entered the war. Barlow was controller of factory premises, and indeed cleared one of his own factories of spinning and weaving machinery. As director-general of civilian clothing, Barlow had to cope with thousands of small businesses. Despite his outspoken and forthright manner and his vigorously held opinions, Barlow won the affection and co-operation of these businesses. Having gained their confidence, he was able to control them with a firm hand. He was an unassuming and courteous man, of great integrity and transparent honesty, with the strongest sense of public service. If he found in wartime that not everyone lived up to his high standards, he had no hesitation in telling them so, whoever they might be.<br>
<br>Barlow cannot have relished spending the whole week in London, but he had a strong sense of duty and must have known that he was at the top of a very short list of people who could do this job. Perhaps what finally decided him to accept was the thought that he would be able to wear his oldest clothes in London, thus demonstrating publicly his resolve not to buy a new suit until the end of the war. For among his many remarkable qualities masochism held an honoured place. He was known to catch a late, slow train, in order to avoid a public dinner in Manchester or a cocktail party in London. People were apt to wonder at his dislike of the latter curious form of entertaining which, it was argued, was entirely suited to his temperament, but was certainly not to his taste. For he was an excellent judge of food and wine, especially Moselle, and liked to invite a couple of friends to a small dinner at his house at Strand on the Green, Chiswick. He would carefully choose a simple dinner to match the qualities of the wines, on which his running commentary was an education. Perhaps, if the next morning were Saturday, he would catch a train to Manchester, where his wife had promised to meet him and escort him to a British restaurant, just completed in a disused factory. She was a great public worker and felt it was essential for him, a well-known personality, not only to visit such an institution, but to be seen to lunch there and, if possible, enjoy the novel experience.<br>
<br>Despite his robust views, Barlow was tolerant of those who disagreed with him. From disagreement there often developed respect and friendship. His annual statements to the District Bank shareholders, until his retirement in 1960, had the typical Barlow stamp of outspoken practicality, sound industrial and trade experience, and an understanding of financial affairs. His financial knowledge led him to be appointed a member of the Capital Issues Committee in post-war years.<br>
<br>Barlow's practical knowledge went hand in hand with artistic appreciation. He was a member of the Council for the Encouragement of Art in Industry. It was natural that Tommy Barlow, as he was known to everyone, should be called in for the preliminary discussions of the project to establish its successor, the council of industrial design, and that he should emerge as the chairman. In the early days of the council his valuable, down-to-earth comments were accepted by the well-known manufacturers who were invited to sit on the council but had not the advantage of his wide interests. It was certainly unfortunate that in 1947 he was reluctantly forced to give up the chairmanship on the strong advice of his doctors to avoid so much travelling. It was typical of him that almost immediately he took on the chairmanship of the District Bank in Manchester where, as a consolation, he was known to walk about with a book of Greek poems in his pocket. With his deep interest in the arts and his rare wish to influence his great textile business, he had started up before the war a small subsidiary, Helios, inside Barlow and Jones, to produce the finest individual weaving, and for this purpose had appointed a distinguished Swiss designer, Marianne Straub. Barlow also became a member of the council of the Royal College of Art.<br>
<br>Barlow's interest in beautiful things originated in his youth. He became a successful collector of early books and manuscripts, and gathered, over a period of forty years, a fine collection of D&uuml;rer woodcuts, engravings, and illustrated books. This collection was sold in 1956 to the National Gallery of Victoria, in Melbourne, to which Barlow had previously given important items. Barlow also lent pictures to the Art Treasures Centenary Exhibition (1957) of the Manchester City Art Gallery, of which he was for some years chairman of the council. He was created KBE in 1934 and GBE in 1946. Barlow died at his London home, 49, Strand on the Green, Chiswick, on 22 November 1964, from bronchial pneumonia.<br>
