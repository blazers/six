<span class="headword">Stewart,  David</span>, first earl of Strathearn and first earl of Caithness  (<em>b. </em>in or after 1357?, <em>d.</em> 1386?), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23713/', "Robert II (1316&#150;1390)")</script>, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26511/', "Walter Stewart")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49411/', "Stewart family (per. c.1110&#150;c.1350)")</script>], and his second wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54312/', "Euphemia Ross (d. before 1399)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54308/', "Ross family")</script>]. His parents had received a papal dispensation allowing their marriage in 1355, and although David's date of birth is unknown, the choice of Christian name for him may indicate that he was born after his royal namesake, David II, had returned to the kingdom in 1357 following a period of captivity in England. On his father's accession to the throne in 1371 David became earl of Strathearn, a title which had been held by his father since 1357. Robert II was still styled earl of Strathearn on the day of his coronation, 27 March 1371, but had apparently resigned the earldom in favour of David by the following day. David received further formal grants of Strathearn on 3 July 1371 and 19 October 1372 which elevated the earldom into a regality. The fact that he and his younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26512/', "Walter Stewart")</script>, were produced in a canonically legitimate marriage, whereas the offspring of Robert II's first marriage required a retrospective legitimation in 1347, gave rise to speculation in fifteenth-century chronicles that David and Walter regarded themselves as the king's real heirs. The &#145;dynastic ambitions&#146; of David and Walter would seem to have been exaggerated in order to provide a suitably dishonourable explanation of Walter's much later involvement in the assassination of his nephew James I in 1437. Any doubt over the succession had been removed by entails approved by the three estates in 1371 and 1373, which ordained that the crown should descend to the male heirs of Robert II's sons by his two marriages in order of seniority.<br>
<br>Strathearn was part of a great territorial endowment in the north of the kingdom settled on David by his father after 1371. On 30 March 1371 David was given a reversionary interest in the lordship of Badenoch granted to his elder half-brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26451/', "Alexander Stewart")</script> on that date. On 19 June of the same year David received a grant of the strategically vital castle and barony of Urquhart on Loch Ness, which dominated the land and water routes along the Great Glen between Inverness and Loch Linnhe, as well as a major routeway to Wester Ross and Skye. Because of his minority Urquhart was leased to Alexander, an arrangement which gave rise to considerable problems in the 1380s. On 21 March 1375 David secured a grant of the castle of Braal and various lands in Caithness following the resignation of his kinsman Alexander Ard, a grandson of David's uncle Malise, who had been earl of Strathearn and of Caithness. By 28 December 1377 David himself had been created earl palatine of Strathearn and earl of Caithness. He also obtained interests outside the central and northern highlands, most notably through his father's gift in 1381 of Lochleven Castle and the lands of Kinross.<br>
<br>During the 1380s David became embroiled in a dispute with his half-brother Alexander, and presented a complaint over Alexander's continued occupation of the castle and barony of Urquhart before a general council of April 1385. But this is the last record of the young earl, who died some time between the council of April 1385 and 5 March 1390, when his daughter, Euphemia, was styled countess of Strathearn. A later addition to a manuscript of Bower's <span class="italic">Scotichronicon</span> claimed that he died in March 1385. As David was alive in April 1385, the likelihood is that this report, if accurate, indicates a death date in March 1386.<br>
<br>Overall, David seems to have played little or no part in national politics or administration in comparison with his elder half-brothers, although his early death may partly account for his relative anonymity. Events in the central highlands after his death suggest that, at the local level, he may have acted as a significant counter-weight to the influence of his half-brother Alexander, who was earl of Buchan and lord of Ross and Badenoch.<br>
<br>David Stewart married a daughter of Sir Alexander Lindsay of Glen Esk and the couple had one child, Euphemia. The link to the Lindsays was twofold, since David was also Alexander Lindsay's brother-in-law. The Lindsays had a reputation as one of the great chivalric families of fourteenth-century Scotland, and David's purchase of tournament armour in 1381 might indicate that the earl shared these interests.<br>
<br>David's daughter, Euphemia, was countess of Strathearn by March 1390 and in the care of her uncles Walter Stewart and David Lindsay of Glen Esk. Before 1402 she resigned the earldom of Caithness in favour of Walter (later earl of Atholl). By August 1406 she had married Patrick Graham of Dundaff, who became earl of Strathearn, but on 10 August 1413 Patrick was killed in an ambush near Crieff by Sir John Drummond of Concraig. Thereafter the title to the earldom descended to the son of Patrick and Euphemia, Malise, whose tutor was his great-uncle Atholl. On 22 July 1427, however, James I gave over to Atholl, as his political ally, the liferent of Strathearn. In compensation for the loss of his rights in Strathearn, Malise was given the title earl of Menteith, although only the portion of the earldom's lands around Aberfoyle came into his possession.<br>
