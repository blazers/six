</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Edwards,  Thomas</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Twm o'r Nant]</span>  (1738&#150;1810), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born between 1 and 8 January 1738 in Penporchell Isaf in the parish of Llannefydd, Denbighshire, the son of Evan Edwards, a smallholder, and his wife, Mary. He became known as Twm o'r Nant on account of his parents' moving to Y Nant Isaf, near the village of Nantglyn, in the parish of Henllan, about 1741. He married Elizabeth Hughes (1738/9&#150;1808) of Llanfair Talhaearn in 1763, and the first of the couple's three daughters was born before the end of the same year.<br>
<br>Twm recorded the details of his early life, and sketched his subsequent movements, in a short autobiographical tract which appeared in <span class="italic">Y Greal</span> in 1805. He mentions his meagre schooling&#151;a few weeks at the Nantglyn Free School and a fortnight's instruction in the English tongue at Denbigh&#151;and boasts of his exploits as a timber haulier which were unfortunately arrested when his horses fell victim to a disease and died. Further tribulations were to follow with the bankruptcy of an uncle for whom Twm had agreed to act as surety. Twm chose to outwit his debtors by leaving Denbigh, where he had settled shortly after his marriage, and fleeing first to Dolobran in Montgomeryshire and eventually to Llandeilo in Carmarthenshire where he again undertook haulage work before returning to his native county in 1786.<br>
<br>Twm sought to overcome his financial plight by writing interludes. His involvement with this form of popular entertainment began around 1749 when he was invited to join a local company of touring actors. By the time he was twenty Twm had written seven interludes, all of which have since disappeared. There remain in print and in manuscript seven works written between about 1766 and 1789 which the author performed throughout north Wales and which brought him, according to his own testimony, considerable pecuniary reward, enhanced by the sale of printed versions. His interludes were republished after his death&#151;no other writer received this treatment&#151;and six of his works appeared collectively in an Isaac Foulkes publication of 1874, <span class="italic">Gwaith Thomas Edwards</span>.<br>
<br>His explicit commentary on the social evils of his day helps to explain Twm's renown as an interlude writer. The unpopularity of the various taxes levied by the authorities is frequently mentioned. Landowners are castigated on account of their exorbitant rents, their greed, and their absenteeism. The representatives of the church are shown to be immoral, unconcerned with the spiritual welfare of their flocks, and unable to communicate effectively with the masses due to their lack of fluency in the Welsh language. The legal profession, central in Twm o'r Nant's personal drama of misery, is portrayed as a haven for conniving swindlers. Yet, paradoxically, Twm parades as the upholder of the social order, especially so in <span class="italic">Pedair colofn gwladwriaeth</span>, published three years prior to the French Revolution. Social tension, Twm argues, is caused not by an unjust system but rather by the inability of the individual, whatever his status, to respect his predestined place and perform his required duties.<br>
<br>The interludes also proclaim the author's moral and religious values. Man is shown to be at the mercy of his nature and his sins are symbolized by the two stock characters, the miser and jester, and by parallel allegorical characters. <span class="italic">Tri chryfion byd</span>, possibly Twm's last interlude, ends not with the conventional death of the former, but with his conversion. The miser's rejection of the transient serves to remind the public of a pivotal theme in the teaching of the Methodists, and also explains how Twm became <i>persona grata</i> in the eyes of the movement's leaders, who naturally despised the interlude and the lewd actions and speech of its characters. Nineteenth-century commentators were less impressed with the religious undertones in the interludes.<br>
<br>The most prominent interlude writers in eighteenth-century Wales were also prolific ballad writers, and Twm o'r Nant was no exception. There remain approximately 200 extant pieces in print and in manuscripts, and as many poems again in <i>cynghanedd</i>, mostly <i>englynion</i>, awaiting the services of an editor. Interestingly, scraps of poetry by two of Twm's offspring, Margaret and Lowri, survive in their father's manuscripts. The poet prepared an anthology of his works (again as part of his efforts to establish himself financially); <span class="italic">Gardd o gerddi</span> appeared in 1790, and Twm gleefully informed readers of his autobiography that he had sold 2000 copies. The strict-metre <i>cywyddau</i> in the collection bear the hallmark of hurried composition. Their style and subject matter however&#151;his elegies and eulogies to the north Wales gentry take a prominent place&#151;indicate that their author was well acquainted with the poetry of the <i>cywyddwyr</i> of the late middle ages. Twm himself was the proud owner of several early manuscripts which he eventually sold to the Gwyneddigion Society (the London-Welsh Society founded in 1770).<br>
<br>Twm o'r Nant participated in the eisteddfodau held under the auspices of the same society during the latter years of the eighteenth century, but the cherished main honour eluded him, possibly as a consequence of an earlier dispute between Twm and the Gwyneddigion, which deemed the impromptu composition of its favourite, Gwallter Mechain (Walter Davies), superior to Twm's effort, in spite of the entreaties of Twm's protagonist, David Samwell, Captain James Cook's surgeon, who dubbed his hero the Cambrian Shakespeare.<br>
<br>Twm survived his wife by two years. He died on 1 April 1810 and was buried in the parish church of Denbigh. The Gwyneddigion funded a tablet in his memory.<br>
