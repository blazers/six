<span class="headword">Poynder,  John</span>  (1779/80&#150;1849), <span class="occ">lawyer and evangelical activist</span>, was the eldest son of a City of London tradesman and his evangelical wife. He was educated briefly at the Newington Butts school of Joseph Forsyth, where he imbibed a lasting love of literature. As a young man he hoped to become an Anglican clergyman but he was persuaded by family pressures to become a solicitor instead, and for nearly forty years he served as clerk and solicitor to the royal hospitals of Bridewell and Bethlem. On 15 September 1807 he married Elizabeth Brown of Clapham, Surrey, the daughter of low-church parents.<br>
<br>Poynder was one of the earliest members of the Church Missionary Society in the days when it met in London in the Revd William Goode's rectory at St Ann Blackfriars. Poynder first came to public attention in 1803 with the publication of <span class="italic">A Serious Address to the Public on the Present Times</span>, an attack on the proposed admission of Roman Catholics to political office and on the East India Company's toleration of idolatry in India. These remained abiding concerns throughout his life, so much so that on his death the Revd William Jay of Bath, a friend for over fifty years, observed fondly that &#145;Never was there a more determined enemy to Popery, and its half-sister, Puseyism&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography of &hellip; William Jay</span>, 447). Jay was a whig and a dissenter whereas Poynder was a tory and a devout churchman, but nevertheless it was one of Jay's sermons which prompted Poynder to take up the cudgels against the East India Company's policy of religious toleration in India. A sermon by Claudius Buchanan, the most fiery of the company's &#145;pious chaplains&#146;, also spurred him on. Poynder wrote numerous articles attacking the company's refusal to prohibit the rite of suttee (widow immolation), its collection of pilgrim taxes from Hindu shrines, and its requirement that civilian and military employees occasionally put on a show of respect at certain Hindu temples. In 1813, when the company's charter was due for renewal, Poynder set out his arguments in a series of letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span> under the name Laicus (published separately as <span class="italic">Christianity in India</span> in 1813). Over the next thirty-five years he pressed the court of directors with petitions and appeals on the subject of idolatry, and he was highly influential in the court's decision of 1827 to outlaw suttee and its dispatch of 1833 ordering the abandonment of pilgrim taxes. After these victories Poynder continued to agitate against the company's lingering connections with the Jagannath temple at Puri in Orissa. He also served on the committees of the Lord's Day Observance Society, the Reformation Society, and the Protestant Association.<br>
<br>Poynder was for three years under-sheriff of London and Middlesex, a post which often took him to Newgate prison and provided him with a vast store of anecdotes on London's social and moral climate. These interests were reflected in his three-volume <span class="italic">Literary Extracts from English and other Works</span> (1844, 1847), a miscellany of quotations, sermons, and aphorisms which had appealed to him in the course of his life. His other publications included works of religious controversy. His wife, Elizabeth, died, aged sixty, on 22 September 1845, after which Poynder rarely left his house. He loved her dearly and in an autobiographical fragment written after her death paid moving tribute to her companionship and affection during their thirty-eight years of marriage. After many years of suffering from bronchitis and other ailments, Poynder died at his home, Montpelier House, South Lambeth, Surrey, on 10 March 1849. He was survived by several children, including two sons who became clerics: Frederick, chaplain of Bridewell Hospital from 1849 to 1858 and second master of Charterhouse School from 1858 to 1872; and Leopold (1818&#150;1896), chaplain in India from 1847 to 1866.<br>
<br>The extent of Poynder's eclectic literary tastes was revealed in January 1850 when Sothebys took three days to sell his remarkable library. The collection included first editions of Shakespeare and many volumes with autograph letters and memoranda, including an edition of the <span class="italic">Phaenomena et diosemeia</span> of Aratus Solensis, autographed and annotated by Milton.<br>
