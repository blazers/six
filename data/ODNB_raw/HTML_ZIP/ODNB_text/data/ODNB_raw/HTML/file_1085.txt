<span class="headword">Bainbridge <span class="st"> [Bainbrigg]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1574, <em>d.</em> 1646), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was the son of Edward Bainbrig (<i>c</i>.1508&#150;1584), clothier of Hawkin Hall, Middleton, in Kirkby Lonsdale, Westmorland. Thomas, the younger son of his father's marriage to his second wife, Elizabeth Hodgson (<i>d</i>. 1590), was baptized on 18 February 1574 at Kirkby Lonsdale. Several members of the family attended Christ's, including Thomas's half-brother Christopher (fellow, 1574&#150;84), who appears later to have bought out Thomas's share of their father's properties. Bainbridge matriculated pensioner from Christ's College in 1593; he graduated BA in 1597 and by Michaelmas 1599 was a fellow of his college. He proceeded MA in 1600, and he or a namesake incorporated at Oxford in 1603. His BD is not recorded, but he was made DD in 1617. From 1618 he was rector of Icklesham, Sussex, where he never lived. At Cambridge he attracted no attention save when in 1602 he was accused by two of his colleagues of immorality, a charge they were unable to substantiate. Despite, or because of, his unobtrusive character, he was elected master of Christ's on 26 May 1622; there was apparently no contest, and his promotion may have been owed simply to his seniority. Nevertheless, on acquiring authority he developed a taste for its exercise, and would be reckoned a martinet for insisting on a rigorous performance by the fellows of their statutory duties.<br>
<br>Bainbridge has received most notice from the biographers of Milton, who was an undergraduate of Christ's during his mastership. Milton's rustication in Lent term 1626 would certainly have had the master's sanction, but the story that the delinquent was personally thrashed by the head of house is a fanciful elaboration, incompatible with the realities of discipline. Nor is there any evidence that Bainbridge directly impeded Milton's candidacy for a fellowship, thereby (as some have alleged) turning him against the Anglican establishment. But Bainbridge was certainly no friend of the radical young man, and on a later occasion was said to be ready to &#145;remove a couple of lawless persons&#146; to find room in the college for young men of the better sort  (Masson, 1.183n.). He also cultivated contacts at court. He had voted for the duke of Buckingham in the chancellorship election of 1626, and when the new chancellor duly went to Cambridge in March 1627 it was reported by Joseph Meade of Christ's that &#145;somebody&#146; (presumed to be the master) &#145;will scarce worship any other God, as long as [the duke] is in town&#146;  (Williams, 1.202). In 1627/8 Bainbridge served as vice-chancellor, and so had the even more congenial duty of hosting the king himself on a visit in the Lent term. Later in 1628 he was involved in the controversy over the subversive lectures given, at the instigation of Lord Brooke, by Isaac Dorislaus.<br>
<br>Following Buckingham's assassination on 23 August 1628 Bainbridge wrote a personal letter to Charles I in which he described the university as &#145;so stownded&#146; by the &#145;unexpressable disaster&#146; that it would be a lifeless body until the king resurrected it with the nomination of a new chancellor  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/114, no. 60). Despite seeming so well affected to the crown, Bainbridge was judged one of Cambridge's &#145;learned neutrals&#146; in the 1640s, and was able to retain his place when most other heads of houses were ejected  (Peile, <span class="italic">Christ's</span>, 131&#150;2). His mastership was distinguished by the erection of the Fellows' Building and other works. He died in office, and was buried in the church of St Andrew the Great, opposite the college, on 9 September 1646.<br>
<br>Bainbridge's widow, Mary, lived until February 1671. He was also survived by sons Thomas and Edward (the latter an undergraduate at Christ's in his father's last years), and unmarried daughters Elizabeth, Mary, and Susan. He made careful arrangements to ensure that lands he held from the college in the Cambridgeshire villages of Bourn, Impington, and Cottenham would remain vested in his family, appointing the bishop of Exeter (Ralph Brownrigg), the masters of Corpus and Emmanuel (Richard Love and Richard Holdsworth), and Thomas Buick, one of the university bedells, as his feoffees. To the college itself, his &#145;best nurse and mother&#146;, he bequeathed &pound;50, equivalent to the sum which had been spent on bringing a new cut of the river to the college grounds. His books were to be divided between his two sons. Other children died before he made his will, but the colourful story that he married at the age of sixty and then fathered an extensive family seems rather to attach to his father.<br>
