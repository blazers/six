<span class="headword">Spencer <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Poyntz]</span>,  (Margaret) Georgiana</span>, Countess Spencer  (1737&#150;1814), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was born on 8 May 1737 at St James's Palace, London, the fourth surviving child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22694/', "Stephen Poyntz (bap. 1685, d. 1750)")</script>, steward to the household of the duke of Cumberland, and Anna Maria Mordaunt (<i>d</i>. 1771), daughter of Brigadier-General the Hon. Lewis Mordaunt and granddaughter of the earl of Peterborough. Her paternal grandfather was a successful linen draper who sent his clever son to Eton College, and thereby launched him into a career and a life in society. Her mother was a maid of honour to Queen Caroline and &#145;a great royal favorite&#146;  (Friedman, 52), and her godfather was George II. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39562/', "Charles Poyntz (1734/5&#150;1809)")</script> was her brother. On 20 December 1755 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38713/', "John Spencer (1734&#150;1783)")</script>, later first Earl Spencer, who through the inheritance from his great-grandmother, Sarah Churchill, was one of the richest young men in England.<br>
<br>The countess lived a varied and active life, corresponding with an enormously divergent series of people. Her correspondence with her friend the Hon. Mrs Howe is reputed to be the largest single private collection of letters in the British Library. Exceptionally intelligent and well educated, she could write and speak faultless French and Italian, make puns in Greek, and was accomplished in botany and skilled at the viola de gamba, hunting, and billiards. Above all, however, she was known by her contemporaries as a woman of a philanthropic bent, actively involved in projects both among her neighbours, in the world of associated or charitable institutions, and as a founding member of the Ladies Society, one of the first philanthropic organizations systematically to investigate the characters and circumstances of those who appealed to them for assistance. This technique was later to be embodied in the work of the Mendicity Society (in which her son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26125/', "George John Spencer")</script>, the second earl, was an important and early member) and ultimately in the Charity Organization Society.<br>
<br>Lady Spencer was a meticulous keeper of files; she remarked of herself that &#145;method was [her] passion&#146;. In her correspondences, as well as in the published subscription lists, we can see how much time and effort she devoted to charitable activities. One of the most remarkable parts of her papers is a file that she described as her &#145;charity letters&#146;, which she kept as &#145;a Cordial&#151;to remind me of my Lord's [her husband's] never failing Generosity and Humanity and of the earnestness with which I executed and sometimes endeavored to imitate his benevolence&#146;  (Althorp MS F130). These words were probably written shortly after her husband's untimely death in 1783 and were a modest, though not entirely accurate, reflection of the couple's charitable practices. For even if the initial impulse were her husband's, Lady Spencer served as his agent many years before his demise. Among her friends and acquaintances, she was renowned for her philanthropy. Elizabeth Montague noted: &#145;The history of La Fee Bienfaisante is not half so delightful as seeing the manner in which Lady Spencer spends her day. Every moment of it is employed in some act of benevolence and charity&#146;  (Doran, 332&#150;3). Lady Spencer also corresponded with and advised a number of philanthropists and charitable institutions. Jonas Hanway, perhaps the eighteenth century's most active founder of charities, was one such correspondent. She also took great interest in, and gave minute advice to, those charitable organizations to which she donated. She sent, for example, the secretary of the Asylum for Orphaned Girls a detailed letter of instruction about how mealtimes should be conducted at the asylum. A committed, and perhaps somewhat overbearing, philanthropic involvement permeated many of her activities. She felt she knew what was best for people, and was prepared to put her money and her efforts behind her plans for them. Her condescension was to mankind in general; only her husband and son were never criticized. Despite this attitude of knowing best, she was without obvious class prejudice, and her Christian piety, which flirted with but never succumbed to Methodism, best expressed itself in her hard work and interest in the needy and deserving. She died at St Albans on 18 March 1814, and was buried on 30 March at Brington, Northamptonshire. After her death the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> said of her:<blockquote>No one was ever better formed by nature, not only to become, but to shed a grace and ornament upon the high station in which she was placed &hellip; and to exert the noblest prerogative which rank, and wealth confer, by giving a high example of virtue and piety, united with a proper display of splendour &hellip; which naturally belonged to her situation &hellip; Her words and her actions bore, in their general and unfailing benevolence, the stamp of the characteristic virtue of her religion, and shewed how intimately Christian charity was blended with her manners, her feelings and her opinions &hellip;. Amidst the pleasures and occupations of the world, she never had forgotten the offices of benevolence and piety. (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 309)</blockquote>In addition to her three surviving children, Lady Spencer had two who died in childhood. Her eldest daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4934/', "Georgiana Cavendish, duchess of Devonshire")</script>, was perhaps the most famous aristocratic woman of her day, a noted trendsetter, gambler, and leader of the female wing of the whig party. Her sister, Harriet, Lady Bessborough [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38506/', "Ponsonby, Henrietta Frances")</script>], was less flamboyant but also involved in both the beau monde and in aristocratic politics. Their brother, the second Earl Spencer, was as prominent as his sisters, serving as first lord of the Admiralty during the Napoleonic wars; he, however, was a sober-living, religious Pittite. Lady Spencer wrote voluminously to her children (as to everyone else) and much of this correspondence has been published. She wrote just as frequently, if not as warmly, to her daughter-in-law Lavinia, whom she disliked despite the latter's piety and charity. Throughout her long life she engaged in various activities of disciplined usefulness, and helped usher in an era of &#145;personal nobility&#146; in which she was the &#145;exemplar of aristocratic female virtue&#146;  (Langford, 571).<br>
