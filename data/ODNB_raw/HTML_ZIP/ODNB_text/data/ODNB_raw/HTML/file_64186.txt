<span class="headword">Newby,  Peter</span>  (1745&#150;1827), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic schoolmaster and author</span>, was born at Horncop Hall, near Kendal in Westmorland, the son of William Newby (1702&#150;1772), a waller and land agent, and his wife, Elizabeth Carter (<i>c</i>.1707&#150;1772), of Thistleton, Lancashire. After attending the Catholic preparatory school operated by Dame Alice Harrison at Fernyhalgh, near Preston, Lancashire, Newby was an ecclesiastical student at the English College, Douai, from 1757 to 1764. On returning to England in January 1764, having decided not to proceed to holy orders as his parents had hoped, Newby was rejected by his family and forced to seek his own way in the world.<br>
<br>Two major influences shaped Newby's subsequent career. Employment as a steward on a Guineaman from November 1764 to January 1766 awakened his humanitarianism. On a return voyage from Liverpool to Jamaica via west Africa, where he stayed for five months, Newby witnessed at first hand the horror of the transatlantic slave trade. Next, the inspiring mentorship of the Revd Bartholomew Booth (1732&#150;1785), an enlightened and unorthodox Anglican schoolmaster, completed his education and perfected his teaching skills. As a teacher of French and Latin at Booth's two highly successful private academies, at Woolton Hall near Liverpool (1766&#150;72) and at High Beach near Waltham Abbey in Essex (1772&#150;3), Newby discovered the many advantages of offering an unusually wide curriculum.<br>
<br>In 1773 Newby opened his own academy for boys at Burton in Kendal, Westmorland, even though Catholic schools were still officially proscribed. There his pioneering approach to education attracted significant patronage from the rising Catholic middle class of the north of England. The growth of the academy caused it to move, first in 1775 to Great Eccleston, in the Fylde area of Lancashire, and in 1780 to Gerard Hall, Haighton, near Fernyhalgh, where it remained until 1797.<br>
<br>Though Newby was the first schoolmaster in Lancashire to register his academy officially after the passing of the 1791 <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Act</span>, his success was short-lived. The migration of English Catholic schools from continental Europe to England during the French Revolution created new competition, forcing Newby to abandon teaching in 1797. He set up as a printer and bookseller in Preston, specializing in Catholic devotional literature. When this venture failed around 1805, he was once again forced to offer private tuition, but soon fell into the penury which characterized the last twenty years of his life.<br>
<br>Newby's marriage at Childwall, Lancashire, on 15 May 1768 to Elizabeth Gant (<i>c</i>.1743&#150;1782) of Prescot, and the couple's happy family life following the birth of their five children between 1769 and 1782, first inspired the schoolmaster to write poetry. Composed between 1771 and 1790, Newby's verse never received wide public acclaim owing to the poet's natural diffidence. His <span class="italic">Six Pastorals</span> (1773), of which the copy in the Beinecke Library at Yale is the only known surviving example, was published anonymously; and his longest single work, <span class="italic">The Wrongs of Almoona, or, The African's Revenge</span> (1788), an anti-slavery poem dedicated to William Cowper, appeared under the pseudonym A Friend to All Mankind. Newby's <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1790), published in two volumes with the support of some 340 subscribers, were written essentially for private purposes, &#145;to alleviate disappointments, or to encounter domestic misfortunes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, Preface). The combination of their late classicism and limited readership resulted in their being soon forgotten.<br>
<br>Newby's most enduring achievement was in founding the Broughton Catholic Charitable Society, created in 1787 to alleviate distress following a smallpox epidemic in the Fylde. Acting as its secretary for twenty years until 1807, he established an organization which was still carrying out its charitable work at the close of the twentieth century. Taken together, Newby's career exemplifies the vitality of Catholic life in pre-emancipation England. Peter Newby died on 16 December 1827 at his home in Hill Street, Friargate, Preston, and was buried in the cemetery attached to the Catholic churches of St Wilfrid and St Mary, Preston, on 19 December.<br>
