<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Prain, Sir  David</span>  (1857&#150;1944), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born on 11 July 1857 at Fettercairn, Kincardineshire, the elder child of David Prain, a native of Inchture near Dundee, and his wife, Mary, daughter of George Thomson, farmer and miller, of the Vale of Alford, Aberdeenshire. For at least two hundred years Prain's ancestry on both sides had been country people. His father, who had a saddlery business, was also clerk to the parish council and to the school board in Fettercairn. Prain was educated until the age of fifteen at the Fettercairn parish school, then for one year at the Aberdeen grammar school in order to be accepted as a clerk in the Royal Bank of Scotland. However, in 1873 he went to the University of Aberdeen where he obtained an MA (1878), with honours in natural science, botany being his strongest subject. A bursary had made it possible for him to enter the university and in vacations he added to his means by teaching. He had intended to become a schoolmaster but after two years of teaching at Chatham House School, Ramsgate, he returned to the university to study medicine. He qualified MB and CM at Aberdeen in 1883 with the highest honours; he also qualified LRCS (Edinburgh) the same year.<br>
<br>Prain was persuaded by his mentor at Aberdeen, Professor J. W. H. Traill, to seek admission to the Indian Medical Service in the expectation of opportunities to transfer to botanical research. Accepted in October 1884, he left the following spring for India where for the next two and a half years he served in military hospitals except for a few months in 1885 when he temporarily filled the post of curator of the herbarium at the Royal Botanic Garden, Calcutta. In January 1887 he was recalled to the same position in the garden under Sir George King, the then superintendent. Since he showed an active interest in economic botany, the government of Bengal requested Prain to submit a report on Indian hemp. This was followed by other official investigations on wheat, mustards, pulses, and indigo. In 1887 he married Margaret Caird (<i>d</i>. 1942), daughter of the Revd William Thomson, of Belhevie, Aberdeen. They had a son, Theodore, who was killed in the First World War.<br>
<br>When King retired in 1898 Prain succeeded him as director of the botanic garden (as the post had by then been renamed) and of the botanical survey of India. Prain had already replaced King as professor of botany at the medical college of Calcutta in 1895. In his role as government quinologist, he reorganized the management of the cinchona factory in Sikkim, making it once more commercially viable. As botanist on Sir Francis Younghusband's Sikkim&#150;Tibet boundary commission in 1903, Prain had the opportunity to collect plants on the Tibetan plateau. His travels through the Indian subcontinent, Burma, Ceylon, and the Andaman and Nicobar islands extended his knowledge of the Indian flora which he reviewed in articles in <span class="italic">Annals of the Royal Botanic Garden, Calcutta</span> and <span class="italic">Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal</span>. <span class="italic">Bengal Plants</span> (1903), published at his own expense, described nearly 3000 species. In 1905 he was elected FRS and retired from Indian service with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In June 1906 he was appointed CIE.<br>
<br>In December 1905 Prain succeeded Sir William Thiselton-Dyer as director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. The staff there were still suffering from Thiselton-Dyer's autocratic administration and someone with Prain's tolerance and diplomacy was needed to restore harmony. His willingness to delegate responsibility was especially appreciated; he was happy to leave decisions regarding the layout of the gardens to the curator and his assistant director, Arthur Hill. During Prain's term of office a medicinal garden was formed in the grounds of Cambridge Cottage, a large tank for aquatic plants was installed, and the Japanese gateway, made for the Japan&#150;British exhibition in 1910, was acquired. Also in 1910 Cambridge Cottage was converted into a museum of British forestry and timbers. Much of Prain's time at Kew was devoted to editorial duties: he revived the <span class="italic">Kew Bulletin</span> which had been languishing for several years; he abandoned the practice of the <span class="italic">Index Kewensis</span> in making taxonomic judgements regarding synonymy; he edited <span class="italic">Curtis's Botanical Magazine</span> and Hooker's <span class="italic">Icones plantarum</span>; he collaborated with I. H. Burkill in <span class="italic">An Account of the Genus Dioscorea in the East</span> (1936); and he contributed to the <span class="italic">Flora Capensis</span> and <span class="italic">Flora of Tropical Africa</span>.<br>
<br>Prain, who retired in 1922, served as the first chairman of the advisory council of the Imperial Institute on plant and animal products from 1926. During all his time at Kew and to the end of his life he was especially interested in the John Innes Horticultural Institution, being chairman of its council from 1909. He did not much less for the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture, Trinidad. He was president (1916&#150;19) of the Linnean Society, from which he received the Linnean medal (1935); vice-president from 1919 of the Royal Horticultural Society which awarded him the Victoria medal of honour (1912) and a Veitch memorial medal (1933); treasurer of the Royal Society (1919&#150;29); a trustee of the British Museum (1924&#150;36); president of the Imperial Botanical Conference in 1924; and a member of the council of the British Association (1907&#150;14), its vice-president (1931), and president of the botany section in 1909. His many honours included appointment as CMG in January 1912 and knighthood in June of the same year; he was a knight of the royal Swedish order of the Pole Star (1908) and a commander of the Belgian order of Leopold II (1919). The honorary degree of LLD was conferred upon him by the universities of Aberdeen (1900) and St Andrews (1911); he received the Albert medal of the Royal Society of Arts (1925), and was an honorary member of many foreign learned societies.<br>
<br>Prain's modest demeanour, his courtesy, and many kindly acts won him the support of his staff at Kew, where he brought stability, and consolidated the achievements of his predecessors. He died at his home, Well Farm, Godstone Road, Whyteleafe, Surrey, on 16 March 1944 and was buried at Putney Vale cemetery five days later.<br>
