<span class="headword">Timperley,  Charles Henry</span>  (1794&#150;1869), <span class="occ">printer and writer</span>, was born at Manchester on 28 December 1794, the son of John Timperley, calenderer. After education at Manchester grammar school he was apprenticed to an engraver and copperplate printer. In March 1810 he enlisted in the 33rd regiment of foot, was wounded at Waterloo, and received his discharge on 28 November 1815. He resumed his apprenticeship and in 1821 became a letterpress printer by indenture to Messrs Dicey and Smithson, proprietors of the <span class="italic">Northampton Mercury</span>. In April 1828 he gave two lectures on the art of printing before the Warwick and Leamington Literary Institution and began collecting information about printers and printing. Timperley clearly moved from job to job, as was the practice with journeymen printers, and eventually became foreman to T. Kirk of Nottingham, printer of the <span class="italic">Nottingham Mercury</span>. While working for Kirk, Timperley began editing a monthly magazine, the <span class="italic">Nottingham Wreath</span>. He married a widow and soon after left Nottingham.<br>
<br>In 1833 Timperley produced <span class="italic">Songs of the press and other poems relating to the art of printing, original and selected; also epitaphs, epigrams, anecdotes, notices of early printing and printers</span>, of which an enlarged edition of the poetry section appeared in 1845. It is still the only collection of printers' songs in English and some of the verse is by Timperley himself. In 1838 he published <span class="italic">The printers' manual, containing instructions to learners, with scales of impositions and numerous calculations, recipes, and scales of prices in the principal towns of Great Britain, together with practical directions for conducting every department of a printing office</span>. This was followed by <span class="italic">A dictionary of printers and printing, with the progress of literature, ancient and modern, bibliographical illustrations</span> (1839).<br>
<br>Timperley had charge of a bookseller's shop owned by Bancks &amp; Co. of Manchester, printer of his <span class="italic">Printers' Manual</span>. The managing partner of the firm, named Hayward, made his staff accept bank bills for the firm under their own names, which were discounted on the Manchester Bank, and when the firm's crash came the concern had debts of &pound;120,000 to the bank and a further &pound;100,000 to the London booksellers. To pay his debt Timperley sold the stock of his publications, but the auctioneer ran off with the proceeds. The stock of these works was purchased by H. G. Bohn, who issued the two together, with twelve pages of additions, under the title of <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia of literary and typographical anecdote, being a chronological digest of the most interesting facts illustrative of the history of literature and printing from the earliest period to the present time</span> (1842). Timperley also wrote <span class="italic">Annals of Manchester, biographical, historical, ecclesiastical, and commercial, from the earliest period</span> (1839).<br>
<br>Timperley accepted a literary engagement with Fisher and Jackson, publishers, of London, where he worked as a general editor and reader. &#145;Timperley was neither tall, stout, nor handsome: but there was something about him that could not but win for him respect and confidence &hellip; His dress, his address, and tone altogether bespoke the gentleman and scholar&#146;  (S. Hall, <span class="italic">The Lithographer</span>, 4.221). Described as a widower, he married, at Islington on 15 October 1842, his second wife, Mary Ann Jane, daughter of Richard Neal, cowkeeper. His health deteriorated through paralysis in his legs and severe rheumatism, which from 1846 prevented him from working. A series of successful applications for assistance from the Royal Literary Fund between 1848 and 1855 revealed his descent into immobility and poverty, and reliance on his 9<i>d</i>. per day army pension. His wife left him in 1849, and emigrated to Geelong, Australia, in 1852. Bedridden, and with no living relatives, he spent his final years in a London lodging house, 10 Owen's Row, Clerkenwell, where he died, of paraplegia, on 1 May 1869.<br>
