<span class="headword">William the Clerk</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1200&#150;<em>c.</em>1240), <span class="occ">poet</span>, presents himself at the end of the <span class="italic">Roman de Fergus</span>, a work that parodies characteristic features of several of Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes's romances, especially the <span class="italic">Conte du graal</span>, and the first and second continuations. Fergus is a <i>vilain</i> (&#145;villein&#146;) whose social ascent is charted with ironic humour. The story is given a realistic Scottish setting, though the two manuscripts of the work suggest a provenance for the author in north-east France. It was thought by some that the work was composed for a Scottish patron, Alan of Galloway (<i>d</i>. 1234) in celebration of his marriage in 1209, for he was a great-grandson of the historical Fergus, lord of Galloway, who had died an Augustinian canon of Holyrood Abbey in 1161. Cogent objections to this view were raised by Schmolke-Hasselmann, who proposed that <span class="italic">Fergus</span> was commissioned by Dervorguilla of Galloway and her husband (from <i>c</i>.1223) John de Balliol (<i>d</i>. 1269), whose claim to the Scottish throne ultimately derived from Fergus Mor mac Eirc (<i>d</i>. 501) and who was anxious to promote the claim of his son, Hugh de Balliol. <span class="italic">Fergus</span> might then be placed in the period 1237&#150;41. D. D. R. Owen's careful study of the Scottish setting leads him inescapably to the view that the author, William, must have been familiar with the leading figures, affairs, and social life of William the Lion's Scotland. He has proposed as &#145;a strong possibility&#146; that the author is to be identified with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17911/', "William Malveisin")</script>, of French stock, who probably arrived in Scotland (perhaps from England) in the 1180s to serve William I as royal clerk. His subsequent career took in the positions of king's chaplain, archdeacon of Lothian (by 1193), royal chancellor (1199&#150;1202), bishop of Glasgow (1200&#150;02) and bishop of St Andrews (from 1202 until his death in 1238). <span class="italic">Fergus</span> must be dated after 1200. Owen has also found convincing historical prototypes for some of the romance's characters, notably Somerled, lord of the Isles (<i>d</i>. 1164), for the hero's father, Soumillet, and Galiena, wife of Philip de Mowbray, for the heroine, Galiene. Another possible candidate for authorship of <span class="italic">Fergus</span> is William del Bois, a clerk in William the Lion's chapel as early as 1193 and royal chancellor from 1210 to 1226. There is a thirteenth-century Dutch translation (<span class="italic">Ferguut</span>) of William's romance.<br>
<br>Quite different is the Norman clerk called <a name="cosubject_54066"></a><span class="headword">William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1210/11&#150;1227<span class="mult">x</span>38), <span class="occ">poet</span>, who was married with a family and spent much of his life in England, composing six religio-didactic works for lay audiences. The <span class="italic">Bestiaire divin</span> (&#145;Divine bestiary&#146;, 1210/1211) was the most popular, surviving in twenty manuscripts and a series of printed editions from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries. It was written for William's lord, Radulphus (possibly to be identified with Ralph of Maidstone, treasurer of Lichfield by 1215 and consecrated bishop of Hereford in 1234), on whose name he etymologizes in the epilogue. This was followed by the <span class="italic">Vie de Tobie</span>, written for William, prior of Kenilworth in Arden (1214&#150;27), an Augustinian house in the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield, and by <span class="italic">Les joies de notre Dame</span> (surviving in one manuscript only). The date of the short <span class="italic">Vie de Sainte Marie-Madeleine</span> is uncertain. The other major work was the <span class="italic">Besant de Dieu</span> (1226&#150;7), partly inspired by Innocent III's theological work <span class="italic">De miseria conditionis humanae</span>, and containing allusions to the interdict (1208&#150;13), the fourth crusade, the war against the Albigensians, Louis VIII's expeditions in the south of France, and the oppression of peasants by the ruling class. Finally, there is <span class="italic">Les treis moz</span> (1227&#150;38), which was written for Alexander Stavensby, bishop of Lichfield and Coventry (1224&#150;38). There are no grounds for attributing to this didactic writer, William, the fabliaux <span class="italic">La male honte</span> and <span class="italic">Du prestre et d'Alison</span>.<br>
