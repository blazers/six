<span class="headword">Boyne,  (Donald Arthur) Colin Aydon</span>  (1921&#150;2006), <span class="occ">architectural journalist and editor</span>, was born on 15 February 1921 at Holnest, Farway, Honiton, Devon, the only child of Captain Lytton Leonard Boyne (<i>b</i>. 1887), formerly of the 3rd Royal Sussex regiment, and his wife, Millicent, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nisbet (<i>b</i>. 1885). He was brought up by his mother and a spinster aunt after his father's early death, and attended Tonbridge School as a day boy. They determined that Boynes had to be farmers or military men, not architects, so when the war came Boyne joined the forces, choosing the Indian army as being far from his mother. An officer in the 8th battalion of the 13th frontier force rifles, he was badly wounded in Burma when a careless Pathan shot him in the ankle and his horse fell on top of him, wounds made worse in hospital. Invalided out, in 1943 he was awarded a scholarship to the School of Architecture of the Architectural Association, although standing over a drawing board aggravated the constant pain that he endured for the rest of his life. He qualified in 1947, and on 4 July the same year he married Rosemary Barnaschone, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pater, a 27-year-old secretary, daughter of Richard Albert Macaulay Pater, sales manager, and former wife of Richard Barnaschone. They had a daughter and twin sons.<br>
<br>Boyne turned to journalism at the suggestion of his wife, who spotted an advertisement for an editorial assistant at the Architectural Press. Originally rejected by the editor, Jim Richards, he was contacted two months later, the first appointment having been a disaster. Boyne proved an outstanding success, rising in two years to become <i>de facto</i> editor in 1949 of the <span class="italic">Architects' Journal</span>, leaving Richards to concentrate on his first love, the <span class="italic">Architectural Review</span>; he became executive editor of the <span class="italic">Architects' Journal</span> in 1953.<br>
<br>In the 1930s and 1940s there were only two serious architectural magazines. The monthly <span class="italic">Architectural Review</span> was glamorous and glossy, with articles from John Betjeman, John Piper, Gordon Cullen, and Nikolaus Pevsner that mixed modernism with an appreciation of Britain's past. Boyne took the weekly <span class="italic">Architects' Journal</span> from being its poor relation and made it essential reading for the profession: campaigning, perceptive, and presenting the latest technical information. It pioneered the promotion of cost analysis in case studies written by outside experts, and reinspected buildings after a few years to see if they had met their brief. Design guides, begun in 1961, boosted sales by a third in that year alone. By 1970, when Boyne became chairman of the editorial board of both magazines, the <span class="italic">Architects' Journal</span> was supporting the <span class="italic">Architectural Review</span>. He served as chairman until 1974, and continued as editorial director of the Architectural Press for another decade.<br>
<br>Boyne was committed to modern architecture, but above all to architecture as a service for the public good. He never wavered from this social commitment, which dominated architecture in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and he regretted the subsequent return of what he termed &#145;conspicuous display&#146;  (<span class="italic">Architects' Journal</span>, 5 Oct 2006, 16). He encouraged public sector architects, whose work was until then published anonymously and generally disregarded by the profession. One of Boyne's first campaigns was to return responsibility for London council housing to the architect's department after it had been passed to London county council's valuer. He succeeded in 1949, but more than fifty years later still remembered with embarrassment that the valuer, Cyril Walker, had tears in his eyes when they met to hear the council's decision.<br>
<br>Boyne was astute, but his sense of justice was tempered with humility and warmth. His friends in the profession were the public-sector architects he championed. He did much to promote the revival of interest in the Hertfordshire prefabricated schools of the late 1940s when he brought together many of the architects who designed them as part of a team that briefed the historian Andrew Saint in the writing of <span class="italic">Towards a Social Architecture</span> (1987). This was a history of the prefabricated school movement and in particular its driving force, Stirrat Johnson-Marshall, designer of the Commonwealth Institute, a leading member of the &#145;chain gang&#146; of public architects who met regularly in the Architectural Press's own bar, the Bride of Denmark, and perhaps the architect Boyne most admired.<br>
<br>When Boyne finally retired in 1984 the architect Hugh Morris wrote that &#145;behind the dry, quizzical, abrupt, sometimes paramilitary manner and the conservative dark suit hides the 100 per cent, unreconstructed, inveterate, unrepentant hair-shirted radical &hellip; that's about the highest praise I can think of&#146;  (&#145;Gentlemen of the press&#146;). Physically tough despite his disability, in 1959 Boyne had taken on management of a 40 acre wood in Kent, where he and Rosemary built themselves a house, designed with Robert Maguire. They sought an easier life in Wells in the early 1990s, but Boyne soon became chairman of the planning committee of the local civic society and of the local branch of the Council for the Preservation of Rural England, campaigning for Wells and its environs. He died on 28 September 2006 at West Mendip Hospital, Glastonbury, Somerset, of uraemia, lymphoma, and spinal stenosis, after a short illness, and years of pain that did not prevent him from being one of the kindest if sharpest of critics. His wife, Rosemary, died a week later. They were survived by their three children.<br>
