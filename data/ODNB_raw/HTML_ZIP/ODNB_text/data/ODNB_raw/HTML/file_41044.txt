<span class="headword">Moore,  Thomas Edward Laws</span>  (<em>c.</em>1820&#150;1872), <span class="occ">naval officer and polar explorer</span>, was born in Brompton, Chatham, Kent. Nothing is known of his family or youth. He entered the Royal Navy as volunteer of the first class on 19 October 1833, but his early years in the service cannot be traced. From 1839 to 1843 he took part in James Clark Ross's Antarctic expedition as mate and magnetic observer on the <i>Terror</i>, and was promoted lieutenant on 4 October 1843 on his return. In 1845 he was sent to the Cape of Good Hope with Lieutenant Henry Clerk RA; they were to make a magnetic survey between the Greenwich meridian and 140&deg; E, towards the Antarctic continent, to fill in a gap left by Ross in 1839&#150;43. In the hired barque <i>Pagoda</i> Moore sailed to within 100 miles of the continent, making detailed observations, despite the very poor conditions and the fact that he was working without supporting vessels. He reported his findings very briefly in the <span class="italic">Nautical Magazine</span> (1846) and they were described more fully in Clerk's account, communicated by Edward Sabine, in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span> (1846). In 1846 Moore was sent to Hudson Bay in the <i>Prince Albert</i> to make similar observations. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society on 1 June 1854 for his &#145;skill, zeal, success in making magnetic observations at sea&#146;  (certificates of candidates for election to the Royal Society, 1801&#150;81, no. 42). His sponsors were John Barrow junior, Francis Beaufort, F. W. Beechey, and James Clark Ross.<br>
<br>On 11 January 1848 Moore was promoted commander and in the same year set out in the <i>Plover</i> to the Bering Strait to seek Franklin and help his search for the north-west passage. On this voyage he earned the disapproval of John Rae for having &#145;an Esquimaux girl in his cabin for purposes which were too evident&#146; and &#145;selling spirits to the natives&#146;  (Jones, &#145;Governor Moore&#146;, 38). He returned in 1852, having discovered nothing as Franklin's ships had been lost some years earlier, but he did some useful surveying. He was promoted to captain on 15 January 1852.<br>
<br>In 1855, with no prospect of further commands at sea, Moore was appointed governor of the Falkland Islands. Despite the company of his wife, Eliza (whom he had married at some point before 1854), and his first daughter, and his secretary, Captain John Sibbald RN (who had been in the <i>Terror</i> with him), he found the place desolate, his duties monotonous, the people &#145;worse than savages&#146;, and &#145;drunkenness the prevailing habit&#146;  (Jones, &#145;Governor Moore&#146;, 39). Even the clergyman and his wife were often drunk, and Moore had to suspend the surveyor for insubordination. After a year he could write &#145;the officers have taken a turn and are behaving better&#146;  (ibid., 39) and when he left the islands in 1862 the colony was in a better condition: drunkenness was less rife, thanks in part to Moore's reading room and temperance hall, and a new surveyor and clergyman proved more co-operative.<br>
<br>Moore was promoted to rear-admiral in the retired list in 1867. In 1871 he had a stroke and he died on 10 April 1872 at his home at 5 Victoria Place, Stonehouse, Plymouth, from congestion of the lungs. He was buried in St George's Church, Stonehouse. He was survived by his wife, three daughters, and a son.<br>
<br>Moore's promotion was slow, partly for lack of influence and partly because he was retiring by nature. Although relatively little known today, his magnetic observations were a useful contribution to polar exploration.<br>
