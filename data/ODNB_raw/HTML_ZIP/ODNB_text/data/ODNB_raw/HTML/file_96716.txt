<span class="headword">Abel,  Charles William</span>  (1862&#150;1930), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born at 509 Oxford Street, Bloomsbury, London, on 25 September 1862, the youngest of three sons of William Edward Abel, a cashier at Mudie's Circulating Library, and his wife, Harriett Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dobson. He was brought up in his parents' Congregational faith. After an education at Wandsworth Boys' School, at the age of sixteen he followed his father to a clerk's stool at Mudie's Circulating Library, working there until he accepted an agricultural cadetship in a New Zealand firm in 1881. He then lived for a time among the Maori near Auckland. After deciding to become a missionary he returned to Britain and in 1884 entered Cheshunt College in Hertfordshire, as a candidate of the London Missionary Society (LMS). A member of the Hertfordshire county cricket eleven, his education at Cheshunt was more distinguished for sporting prowess than scholarship; he tended to reject recondite theologizing and place his trust in the rough-hewn truthfulness and honour of the healthy, sporting Englishman. He was ordained in 1890, and arrived in British New Guinea on 23 October of that year.<br>
<br>After eight months' preliminary work, including teaching at Port Moresby, and briefly relieving the pioneer missionary James Chalmers at Motumotu, Abel joined F. W. Walker at Suau Island off eastern mainland New Guinea, moving the head station 25 miles further east to Kwato Island near the government station on Samarai Island in August 1891. By mid-1892 the island was habitable and a cricket field laid on the site of a swamp. On 22 November 1892 Abel married Elizabeth Beatrice Emma Moxon (1869&#150;1939), daughter of a Yorkshire brewer whose family had migrated to Sydney on the same ship as Abel in 1890. They had four children.<br>
<br>Walker resigned from the LMS in 1896 after a dispute with the directors. Abel, left in charge, took a keen interest in building up a model station on Kwato equipped not only with a chapel but also with a workshop, boat-building factory, and later a printing works. Elementary subjects such as <span class="roman">Bible</span> study were supplemented by carpentry for boys and fine lacework for girls, with cricket, croquet, and tennis after school. Abel conducted the mission on the &#145;settlement system&#146;, in which Papuan children, segregated from infancy from their parents and from village language and culture, were trained to become lay evangelists. They also engaged in the business of copra making, boat-building, and furniture making for sale to Europeans in Papua. The concentration of effort upon a few Papuans in the hothouse atmosphere of a mission-owned island rather than returning educated converts to infuse their own communities drew opposition from such LMS missionary pioneers as W. G. Lawes. In 1897, however, Abel succeeded in winning the support of R. W. Thompson, visiting foreign secretary of the society.<br>
<br>In the prelude to Australia's taking over the administration of British New Guinea in 1906, Abel took advantage of gifts totalling &pound;1200 from the Australian philanthropist J. H. Angas to install, in 1902&#150;4, a slipway, boat-building workshop, and sawmill on the island. During this time he enjoyed the confidence of Alfred Deakin, three times prime minister of Australia; he also had direct contact with J. C. Watson, leader of the Australian Labour Party. He also became known as a champion of Milne Bay people in criminal cases against Europeans. His disclosures in 1901 forced the government of British New Guinea to transfer one official and charge a miner with murder. When the acting administrator, Christopher Robinson, was denounced by Abel in the Australian press for conducting an affray at Goaribari in 1904, Robinson wrote to the governor-general of Australia repudiating Abel's &#145;untruthful and vindictive statements&#146; and committed suicide beneath the Government House flagstaff on 20 June by shooting himself. Many were convinced that Robinson had been hounded to his death. A monument was erected by Robinson's supporters in the main street of Samarai, and for a time Abel could enter the township only under the cover of night.<br>
<br>During Abel's leave in 1909 he managed to persuade the LMS directors to let him plant coconuts in Milne Bay. Known as the Enesi (an acronym of his Australian supporters' names) this venture allowed him to employ Papuans on plantations managed by his converts. Within two years he had 500 acres planted on land given to him by Australian sympathizers. The LMS, which was retrenching, was unable to afford the maintenance of the properties; and his fellow missionaries objected to the society becoming an employer of Papuan labour in competition with secular businesses.<br>
<br>When another deputation from London visited the Papua district of the LMS in 1916 with instructions to reduce financial commitments and disband large children's settlements such as Kwato, Abel felt he had little choice but to resign, which he did the following year. However, he remained an honorary missionary of the society and rented the Kwato properties on an annual basis for ten years. Abel then established the Kwato Extension Association, which was made up of influential businessmen in Britain and with three former administrators of Papua (British New Guinea) as patrons. Some capital was collected, but the depressed state of the Papuan economy after 1918 and the worldwide slump in copra prices made another visit to Britain necessary. In 1921 Abel embarked with his family on a fund-raising tour, leaving Kwato in the hands of Margaret Parkin (1865&#150;1939), his wife's cousin, who had been in the mission since 1896, assisted by Tiraka Anederea, the Papuan head tradesman. Wider support was won by Abel in 1922 among a group of evangelical businessmen in the USA, including Samuel R. Boggs, a founder of the Gideons, businessmen who had pledged themselves to place a <span class="roman">Bible</span> in every hotel room in the nation. As a result an American auxiliary, the New Guinea Evangelization Society, was formed with a permanent council, a regular magazine, and a promise to raise $100,000 within five years. By 1927 the American auxiliary was able to arrange the purchase of the Kwato properties from the LMS.<br>
<br>Abel was planning a new venture on the Fly River in 1929 when he visited America and Britain to settle his affairs and expand the Kwato evangelistic and business venture to the Fly. He was fatally injured in a motoring accident near Tolworth, Surrey, on 10 April 1930, and was declared dead at Woolwich Memorial Hospital. His ashes were interred at Kwato. His widow, Beatrice, ran the Kwato Extension Association until her own death in 1939. Her successor was her elder son, Cecil (1903&#150;1994), who remained with the mission until 1951. As a founder of the pro-independence Pangu Pati of Papua New Guinea, Cecil (Seselo) Abel was the author of the preamble to the constitution of the independent nation in 1975; he was knighted in 1982.<br>
<br>Charles Abel's robust, freewheeling protestantism derived from the late nineteenth-century England of the nonconformist press and free trade. His rejection of traditional culture was a consequence of a social Darwinist's evolutionary outlook. His intense belief in the virtues of metropolitan British society and lack of empathy with traditional culture meant that he advocated swift change among Papuans&#151;spiritual, industrial, social, and recreational&#151;to prepare them to compete under the strenuous conditions of the modern world. Unlike his Anglican missionary neighbours, he viewed the passing of Melanesian customs without regret.<br>
