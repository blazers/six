<span class="headword">Hoare,  Charles James</span>  (1781&#150;1865), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in London on 14 July 1781, the third son of Henry Hoare (1750&#150;1828), banker, of Fleet Street, London, one of the founders of the Church Missionary Society, and his wife, Lydia Henrietta (<i>d</i>. 1816), daughter and coheir of Isaac Malortie of Hanover and London, merchant. He was educated privately under the Revd John Simons of Paul's Cray, Kent, before matriculating as a pensioner at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1802. Here among his friends were Henry Martyn, Charles and Robert Grant, William Dealtry, and J. W. Cunningham. In 1803 he passed as second wrangler, second Smith's prizeman, and second classical medallist, graduated BA in the same year and MA in 1806, and was Seatonian prizeman in 1807. On 24 March 1806 he was chosen Lady Margaret fellow of his college, and was ordained in 1804 as curate to Thomas Rennell, dean of Winchester and vicar of Alton, Hampshire. He was ordained priest in 1806. In 1807 he was presented by the dean and chapter of Winchester to the living of Blandford Forum, Dorset. Hoare married, on 4 July 1811, Jane Isabella (<i>d</i>. 1874), only daughter of Richard Holden of Moorgate, Yorkshire, with whom he had seven children.<br>
<br>In March 1821 Hoare moved to the family living of Godstone, near Reigate, Surrey, which he held for the remainder of his life. In 1829 he became rural dean of South-East Ewell, and on 10 November in the same year the archdeacon of Winchester. On 2 December 1831 he was made a canon residentiary of Winchester Cathedral. He published on the defence of the Irish church, the maintenance of cathedral establishments, and the cause of education. He was a great supporter of religious societies, and held a yearly missionary gathering at Godstone vicarage.<br>
<br>On 14 November 1847 Hoare was transferred to the archdeaconry of Surrey, where he took an interest in the church extension movement in south London. A committed, but not narrow, evangelical, Hoare was on close terms with Hannah More, Wilberforce, the Thorntons, Venn, Macaulay, and Simeon. He had also been one of Sumner's appointments. He resigned his archdeaconry in 1860. Hoare died at Godstone vicarage on 15 January 1865, and was buried in a vault in the churchyard on 21 January.<br>
