<span class="headword">Stratford,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>1582?, <em>d.</em> in or after 1634), <span class="occ">merchant and entrepreneur</span>, came of ancient gentry stock. He was the seventh son of John Stratford and his wife, Margaret, daughter of William Tracy of Toddington and Stanway, in Gloucestershire. John and Margaret had eight sons and one daughter, and in the early years of their marriage lived at Paynes Place, Bushley, Worcestershire. Margaret died at Bushley, leaving a nuncupative will dated 10 October 1621. Their son John Stratford became a London salter, being apprenticed to Peter Robinson, and marrying his daughter Joan at Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, on 20 April 1602. There were two sons and five daughters of this marriage, all born between 1603 and 1615 and baptized at St Matthew's Church, Friday Street, London.<br>
<br>Stratford traded first in Cheshire cheese and woollen hose, sent from the country by Robinson's chapmen, but then switched to rough flax, linen yarn, wheat, and rye, bought from Eastland (Baltic) merchants in exchange for English broadcloth. He entered into partnership with John Hopkins, a fellow apprentice, who also married one of Robinson's daughters. When, through a second marriage, Hopkins became a kinsman of one Vickares, a woollen draper, Hopkins took over the broadcloth trade and Stratford concentrated on the flax trade, in partnership with three others, his half-brother Ralph, Thomas Lane, married to a third daughter of Robinson, and Humphrey Thornbury. They prospered and employed many poor in and near London to dress flax, until the Netherlanders brought in dressed flax.<br>
<br>Then business diminished, and the partners persuaded Stratford to live off his Prescott estate in Gloucestershire. He began to grow tobacco, raising some capital from Abraham Burrell, but Henry Somerscales was his main partner, for Somerscales had learned in the Netherlands how to cultivate tobacco, and took responsibility for the sale of the matured crop. Each lease of land involved separate partnerships, usually sharing the costs and profits equally. Lessees included Thomas Lorenge of Cleeve and John Ligon of Beauchamp Court, Worcestershire, each being promised inflated rents of &pound;5 and more per acre for four years. Stratford employed many poor, spending &pound;1400 on labour in one year, and taking trouble to conceal planting procedures from prying eyes. The first crop was sown in February 1619, on 100 acres, but a proclamation banned tobacco growing on 30 December. He attempted to cancel his leases, and much litigation followed, but he failed to escape his obligations, and became deeply indebted.<br>
<br>At the same time Stratford was engaged with his half-brother Ralph in soap-boiling in London, and dealt in tallow, potash, soap-ash, and oil. An appeal to the privy council in 1623 prompted their recommendation that his creditors forbear, for one year, later extended, to press for payment. He paid off some debts in sheep, and by growing flax at Winchcombe and Cockbury on 40 acres, employing 800 poor. He also experimented with linen manufacture. He urged the growing of flax and hemp as a state policy, and more ploughing of pasture to make work. The date and place of his death are unknown; a lawsuit implies that Stratford was still living in 1634, but he predeceased his wife, who died at Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. Her will was proved on 1 May 1654, and the administration of the estate of a John Stratford of Monmouth was granted to his wife Joan in 1638.<br>
