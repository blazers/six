<span class="headword">Rayman,  Jacob</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1596, <em>d.</em> in or after 1658), <span class="occ">violin maker</span>, was probably born in Faulenbach in Fussen, a town in the Tyrol well known for its lute makers, who had established instrument-making workshops throughout Europe. At an unknown date he left Faulenbach, possibly travelling via Brabant in the Spanish Netherlands, for England, where he is the earliest recorded maker of violins whose instruments survive into the twenty-first century. Sophere Rayman, widow and surgeon&#151;stated to have been born in 's-Hertogenbosch, Brabant, and listed on 16 September 1618 as a stranger living in Blackman Street in the parish of Newington, Surrey&#151;was probably a close relative; she married Nicholas Haynes at St Gregory by Paul in 1626. The earliest violin label bearing Rayman's name is reported to have been dated 1630, with the maker's address given as Bell Yard, Southwark, while the earliest surviving example, dated 1641, comes from Blackman Street, Long Southwark. Jacob Rayman's son, also Jacob, was baptized on 27 November 1642 at St Saviour, Southwark, and Rayman seems to have remained at Bell Yard or Blackman Street until at least 1658. Rayman was not associated with viol making, which was the principal occupation of stringed instrument makers in London at this date. Also in Southwark at this period was the distinguished English viol maker, Henry Jaye, and although no specific address is known for him, it is likely that the two men would have been at least aware of each other's work. Nothing is known of Rayman after 1658, although his son is supposed to have been working as a violin maker in 1691.<br>
<br>Modern interest in Rayman's work has mainly focused on the catalogue of the sale of the collection of Thomas Britton in 1714 (published in John Hawkins's <span class="italic">General History of the Science and Practice of Music</span> in 1776), which included four separate lots described as &#145;an extraordinary Rayman&#146;, offered for sale with examples of all the leading London makers of the time. James Fleming noted in <span class="italic">The Fiddle Fancier's Guide</span> (1883) that Rayman's instruments were &#145;neither scarce nor dear&#146;. They continued to appear with some regularity in nineteenth-century saleroom catalogues, but very few examples have been identified today. This is possibly because their similarity to highly prized Brescian work and that of other better known Fussen trained makers has led to much misattribution and deliberate relabelling over the centuries. A further difficulty is the irregular size of his violins, one small and one over-large pattern, much like the Brescian instruments with which they are often compared. This may have made them awkward for professional musicians of the nineteenth century, and less likely to be conserved. Hawkins also stated that Rayman was particularly prized for his tenors (violas), and two recorded examples are interestingly decorated with an intriguing carved design around the scroll reminiscent of Celtic strapwork. His instruments also frequently bear ornate purfling motifs, fashioned from inlaid strips of dyed hardwood, augmented with pokerwork similar in style to contemporary instruments made from the Netherlands to southern Germany. A small unlabelled violin attributed to Rayman has a Tudor rose surmounted by a crown inlaid in the centre of the back in this manner. A bass violin (or cello), which has a viol-like carved head in place of a scroll, has also been tentatively identified. The general form of Rayman's instruments is distinctively elongated with rather straight centre bouts and extended soundholes. The workmanship is however irregular and quickly executed.<br>
<br>Rayman's influence on subsequent early English violin makers such as William Baker of Oxford and Thomas Urquhart is clearly evident, but by the end of the seventeenth century the leading makers in London, among them Robert Cuthbert and Ralph Agutter had turned to more sophisticated Italian models and a more refined style.<br>
