<span class="headword">Jesty,  Benjamin</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1736, <em>d.</em> 1816), <span class="occ">farmer and vaccinator</span>, was born in Yetminster, Dorset, and baptized there on 19 August 1736, the youngest of at least four sons of Robert Jesty, butcher. Little else is known of his early life. In March 1770 he married Elizabeth Notley (1740&#150;1824) in Longburton, 4 miles north-east of Yetminster. The marital home was established at Upbury Farm, adjoining Yetminster churchyard, and the couple had four sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>It was known in the dairy-farming areas of south-west England that milkmaids, and others who contracted the relatively mild and non-infectious disease of cowpox through handling udders of infected cows, obtained immunity from smallpox, and in 1765 the Medical Society of London received from a Dr Fewster (possibly John Fewster) a paper entitled &#145;Cow pox and its ability to prevent smallpox&#146;. In 1774 smallpox was widespread throughout England, with epidemics in countless towns and villages, including Yetminster. Jesty's servants Ann Notley and Mary Reade, who, like him, had been infected with cowpox, had nursed smallpox patients without themselves catching the disease. Worried for his family's safety in the epidemic, Jesty resolved to provide immunity by giving his wife and two elder sons cowpox. Finding a suitable cow in neighbouring Chetnole, he used a needle to transfer the pox matter and, copying the technique used by inoculators, infected his wife and sons by scratching their arms. The boys had local reactions and quickly recovered but his wife's arm became very inflamed and for a time her condition gave cause for concern. Thus took place the earliest known vaccinations, though the treatment was thought of as inoculation with cowpox until the term vaccination (from the Latin <i>vacca</i> for cow) was coined in 1802.<br>
<br>Jesty's experiment was met by hostility in the neighbourhood; he was labelled inhuman, and &#145;hooted at, reviled and pelted whenever he attended markets in the neighbourhood&#146;. The introduction of an animal disease into a human body was thought disgusting and some even &#145;feared their metamorphosis into horned beasts&#146;. But the treatment's efficacy was several times demonstrated in the years which followed, when Jesty's two elder sons, exposed to smallpox, failed to catch the disease.<br>
<br>Interest in the prophylactic powers of cowpox virus grew and in May 1796 Edward Jenner began his series of vaccination experiments. About 1797 Jesty became tenant at Downshay Manor Farm in Worth Matravers where, encouraged by Andrew Bell, rector of neighbouring Swanage from 1801, he conducted more vaccinations. Following Jenner's reward of &pound;10,000 from the House of Commons in June 1802 for discovering and promoting vaccination, Bell took up Jesty's cause and in August 1803 wrote to George Pearson, founder of the Vaccine Pock Institute, describing in detail the 1774 vaccinations. In 1805 Jesty gave his evidence in London at the institute's invitation, when he was presented with a long testimonial and pair of gold mounted lancets. The institute also commissioned his portrait from Michael William Sharp.<br>
<br>Jesty died in Worth Matravers on 16 April 1816 and was buried in the parish churchyard. His widow, Elizabeth, died on 8 January 1824 and was buried alongside him.<br>
