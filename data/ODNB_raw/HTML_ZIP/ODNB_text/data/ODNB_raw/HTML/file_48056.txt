<span class="headword">Menelaus,  William</span>  (1818&#150;1882), <span class="occ">engineer and iron and steel manufacturer</span>, was born in East Lothian on 10 March 1818. Little is known about his family background except that his father was a writer to the signet at Edinburgh, and his mother's maiden name was Darling. He was probably educated locally, and apprenticed to a millwright or to a firm of engineers at Haddington. On 26 August 1852, in Aberd&acirc;r, he married Margaret Janet, the second daughter of Jenkin Rhys of the Llwydcoed ironworks, but she died just ten weeks later in November 1852, possibly of cholera. Menelaus did not remarry but, childless himself, he brought up and educated two nephews: William Darling, who became a law lord, and Charles Darling, who became an MP and later a baron.<br>
<br>Menelaus came to south Wales in 1844 to remodel a corn mill for Rowland Fothergill of Hensol Park, who persuaded him to stay and eventually manage Fothergill's ironworks at Llwydcoed and Aber-nant. Around 1850 he was induced by Sir John Guest&#151;offering, it was said, to double his salary to &pound;600 a year&#151;to join the Dowlais Iron Company, where, in early 1851, he became the engineer-manager of the mills and forges department. It was a risky time to join the company: the enterprise had been paralysed through most of the 1840s by the long failure to agree terms for the renewal of its lease; and when this was settled in 1848, stagnation continued because of the long illness of Guest, virtually the sole owner. There was some revival under the management by his widow, Lady Charlotte Guest, but a decade's neglect had taken a heavy toll. The real climb came after Lady Charlotte's remarriage in 1855 when overall control fell to the chief trustee, G. T. Clark, who then appointed Menelaus as general manager.<br>
<br>It was a remarkably successful combination: Clark as, in effect, managing director looking after overall strategy, and Menelaus in operational control. Menelaus astutely insisted on weekly reports on physical and financial performance from all departments. As well as this managerial data, he also ensured firsthand knowledge of production by daily walks through the extensive and exposed works. He and Clark explicitly based their main decisions on long-run considerations: the spurning of short-run profit maximization in favour of investment for long-run growth infused his magisterial 1857 report on the state of the Dowlais works. He was also responsible for another landmark report in 1861 pressing the case for Dowlais to enter the coal trade. And it was Menelaus who went to Spain in October 1871 to negotiate a long-run source of cheaper ores, culminating in the launching of the Orcenario Iron Ore Company in 1873, jointly owned by Dowlais, Consett, and Krupps. It paid off: from being close to closure in the mid-1850s and in a period when most of the other works&#151;even the Crawshays of Cyfarthfa&#151;failed, or slid into decline, Dowlais profits between 1863 and 1882 averaged nearly &pound;120,000.<br>
<br>The success derived from innovation as well as organization. Menelaus invented several mechanical handling devices and designed the massive new two-directional Goat mill for iron rolling. He fostered the famous 1860s Bessemer experiments in steel making at Dowlais and quickly adopted the Siemens furnace: in the early 1870s Dowlais was already becoming a significant steel maker, with six Bessemer converters and four Siemens open-hearth furnaces. By the time of Menelaus's death Dowlais had substantially effected the difficult transition from iron to steel. He used small coal, a waste product, in the furnaces, releasing the large coal for the lucrative steam coal trade; he exploded the entrenched belief in long blast furnace campaigns by demonstrating that old worn-out furnaces were merely vehicles for destroying fuel; and in 1870 he was first to use the waste gas from the coking ovens to fuel the furnaces.<br>
<br>Menelaus took little part in local public life, although he was a lieutenant in the Dowlais works volunteer force and supported Sir W. T. Lewis in his unsuccessful attempt in 1880 to become Conservative MP for Merthyr. His public activities were mostly related to his professional enthusiasms. He was the driving force of the 1857 meeting at the Castle Hotel, Merthyr, which led to the foundation of the South Wales Institute of Civil Engineers, of which he was the first president. Similarly, he took the chair at the 1886 meeting at the Queen's Hotel, Birmingham, which led to the founding of the Iron and Steel Institute of Great Britain, and was its president from 1875 to 1877. In 1881 Menelaus was awarded the Bessemer medal. He also appeared before numerous parliamentary committees dealing with iron, coal, and the railways, and his evidence usually related to ways of reducing costs. With Dowlais 1000 feet above sea level and with raw materials increasingly coming in as well as products going out, he saw transport as particularly crucial: &#145;we shall not make large profits in coal, until we have a more direct road to Cardiff&#146;, he reported to Clark  (Owen, 79). At his death he was said to have been responsible for all the existing rail connections to Dowlais, and he also fought for cheaper freights, being, as he told a select committee in 1881, &#145;strong enough to fight the railway companies ourselves&#146;  (&#145;Select committee &hellip; conveyance of goods&#146;). Although active in the South Wales Coalowners' Association&#151;formed primarily to present a united front in dealing with the workmen&#151;Menelaus's opposition to any &#145;artificial&#146; price-fixing bordered on the mystical: supply and demand constituted &#145;a law of God's providence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Western Mail</span>, 31 March 1882).<br>
<br>By the 1880s Menelaus's salary was reputed to be &pound;3500 p.a., while he had personally invested in several large coal and iron enterprises. All this was not to support an ostentatious lifestyle; indeed, his only extravagance seems to have been collecting works of art, which were said to fill his home in Merthyr. He was severe and autocratic at the works to which he came as &#145;a tall, strong handsome man&#146;  (<span class="italic">South Wales Daily News</span>, 31 March 1882) and was later characterized by his long, black hair and &#145;thoughtful face and piercing eye&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Menelaus died, after a lengthy illness, on 30 March 1882 at Charlton House, High Street, Tenby, Pembrokeshire. He had previously given part of his valuable art collection, which consisted of thirty-six items valued at &pound;10,000, to Cardiff Free Library. He was buried on 4 April 1882 in a secluded spot in the mountain churchyard of Penderyn, near Merthyr, in the same brick grave that had already held his wife for thirty years.<br>
