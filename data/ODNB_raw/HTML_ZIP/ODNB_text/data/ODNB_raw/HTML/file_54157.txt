<span class="headword">Crab,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1280&#150;<em>c.</em>1352), <span class="occ">pirate and merchant</span>, was probably born in Muiden in Flanders. Active as a pirate from at least 1306, he was the most notorious of the Flemish privateers who preyed on English shipping during the Scottish War of Independence. His nephew Crabbekyn served with him at sea. Crab's attacks on English shipping led to frequent complaints by Edward II to the count of Flanders. But the count usually turned a blind eye, even pardoning him for murder and, in 1315, encouraging his piracy to obtain food during a famine. After 1310 Crab apparently settled in Aberdeen; Scottish and Flemish allies sold his plunder in Flanders. When Scotland recovered Berwick in 1318, Crab moved there with his family. He organized its defences and also supplied provisions for the Scottish crown, which considered him valuable enough to compensate victims of his piracy. In 1331 he served as constable of Berwick.<br>
<br>On the invasion of Scotland by Edward Balliol (<i>d</i>. 1363) in 1332, Crab took ten ships to besiege him at Perth, but the fleet was burnt and Crab fled on foot, to be captured shortly afterwards. Although the English parliament demanded his punishment, Edward III saw his potential usefulness and paid his ransom in return for his service. In 1333 Crab helped to direct the English siege of Berwick, where his expert knowledge of the defences ensured English success. The Berwick townspeople killed his son; this action, and Crab's anger that the Scots had not ransomed him, led him to give his allegiance to Edward III. As a burgess of Berwick, he was granted valuable lands there by the king in 1334, but he sold them when he was made constable of Somerton Castle in Lincolnshire for life. He continued to help English forces in Scotland, providing ships, soldiers, and siege engines, and refortifying Berwick, while in 1339 he helped protect English wool ships going to the Low Countries. His last active military service was probably at the battle of Sluys in 1340. In his final years he worked in England on Edward's castles and war engines, and he carried out various missions for the king until his death <i>c</i>.1352. Crab is a good representative of those medieval merchants who drew little distinction between trade and privateering, and his career also shows how medieval rulers used such men for their own ends.<br>
<br>Another <a name="cosubject_59517"></a><span class="headword">John Crab</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1342&#150;<em>c.</em>1385), <span class="occ">burgess of Aberdeen</span>, has sometimes been confused with the merchant pirate, to whom he may have been related. His father was probably John Crab, an Aberdeen landholder in the 1320s. A burgess by 1342, after 1357 Crab was one of the burgh representatives negotiating David II's ransom, and he combined mercantile activity with royal service. During the 1360s he traded with England, lent money to the king, and purchased munitions in Flanders for Edinburgh Castle. He attended a general council in 1365 and parliament in 1367.<br>
<br>Crab was prominent among those medieval burgesses who invested in both rural and urban property. Outside Aberdeen his estates included Murtle, Denburn, Kincorth, and Findon; within the town he represented a new breed of rentiers who bought town property for profit. Nevertheless he was a pious man, who from the 1350s onwards gave the rents from a number of his urban holdings to the Aberdeen Carmelites. He arranged masses for himself and his late wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. before 1382), in Arbroath Abbey, Angus, in 1384 and died shortly afterwards. The Crabstone in Aberdeen is thought to have been named from him or his family.<br>
