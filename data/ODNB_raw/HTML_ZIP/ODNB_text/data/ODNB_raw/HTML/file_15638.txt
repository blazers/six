<span class="headword">Kinsey,  William Morgan</span>  (1788&#150;1851), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and traveller</span>, born at Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, was son of Robert Morgan Kinsey, solicitor and banker at Abergavenny, and Caroline Hannah, his wife, daughter of Sir James Harington, bt. He matriculated at Oxford on 28 November 1805, became a scholar of Trinity College, graduated BA in 1809, and proceeded MA in 1813. In 1815 he was elected a fellow of his college, dean in 1822, vice-president in 1823, and bursar in 1824. In 1822 he graduated BD.<br>
<br>In 1827 Kinsey made a tour in Portugal with the intention of making the country better known to the English people. From his journals and a series of letters written to his friend Thomas Haynes Bayly, as well as from historical and other sources, Kinsey published <span class="italic">Portugal Illustrated</span> (1828), an interesting account of the country, and well illustrated with engravings by G. Cooke and Skelton from drawings chiefly made by a companion during his tour. It was dedicated to Lord Auckland, to whom Kinsey was chaplain, and a second edition appeared in 1829. In 1830 Kinsey was travelling with Viscount Alford in Belgium, and, happening to be at Brussels at the outbreak of the revolution in August of that year, was an eye-witness. About 1832 he was appointed minister of St John's Church, Cheltenham, where he made a reputation as a preacher and published a few sermons. In 1843 he was appointed rector of Rotherfield Greys, Oxfordshire, where he lived until his death on 6 April 1851. He was the author of a few other pamphlets, and in January 1848 contributed a paper to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> entitled &#145;Random recollections of a visit to Walton Hall&#146;.<br>
