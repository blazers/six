<span class="headword">Sidney <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Dudley]</span>,  Mary</span>, Lady Sidney  (1530<span class="mult">x</span>35&#150;1586), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8156/', "John Dudley, duke of Northumberland (1504&#150;1553)")</script>, politician, of Halden, Kent, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70580/', "Jane Dudley (1508/9&#150;1555)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8156/', "Dudley, John")</script>], daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70790/', "Sir Edward Guildford")</script> of Halden, Kent, and his first wife, Eleanor. The Dudley genealogies do not supply dates of birth and they separate the five daughters from the eight sons. Mary Dudley may have been born as early as 1530, but equally possibly after <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8160/', "Robert Dudley (1532/3&#150;1588)")</script>. Her brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8143/', "Ambrose Dudley")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8150/', "Henry Dudley")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8156/', "Dudley, John")</script>], and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8149/', "Guildford Dudley")</script>. No details of her education are known, but she is said to have had an understanding of French, Latin, and Italian. Her intellectual interests included romances (Geoffrey Fenton dedicated his <span class="italic">Certaine Tragicall Discourses</span> to her in 1567), versifying, and alchemy.<br>
<br>Mary Dudley married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25520/', "Henry Sidney (1529&#150;1586)")</script>, courtier, of London, first son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25527/', "Sir William Sidney")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25520/', "Sidney, Henry")</script>], and his wife, Anne. The marriage took place at Esher, Surrey, on 29 March 1551, a ceremony repeated publicly at Ely House, London, on 17 May. Sidney was a gentleman of the privy chamber in Edward VI's household; he was knighted in October that year. It is not impossible that like that of her brother Robert, Mary's marriage was a romantic one, and it was certainly highly compatible. The surviving Sidney papers contain a wealth of personal information about her, including a record of the births of most of her children in the family psalter, but unlike her children neither she nor her husband has yet received a full biographical treatment.<br>
<br>Both were members of the court at Edward's death (Mary Sidney apparently brought the news to Lady Jane Grey that she was to be queen), and the disaster attending her father, now duke of Northumberland, in July 1553 placed them in an extremely difficult position. Like the rest of Northumberland's children she was included in his attainder. Sidney himself had been with Northumberland at Cambridge, but he was able to make his peace with Mary I quickly, thanks in part to three sisters who were members of her household. Nevertheless, he did not sever relations with his wife's family. He served in an embassy to Spain in the spring of 1554 partly to secure the release of his brothers-in-law from the Tower of London. Mary Sidney's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8157/', "John Dudley, Viscount Lisle and earl of Warwick")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8156/', "Dudley, John (1504&#150;1553)")</script>], died at Penshurst on his release in October 1554. Her first child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25522/', "Philip Sidney (1554&#150;1586)")</script>, born on 30 November, was given a significant combination of godparents: Philip II and the dowager duchess of Northumberland. When the duchess died in January 1555, Sidney was the executor of her will.<br>
<br>Mary Sidney accompanied her husband when he went to Ireland as vice-treasurer in 1556. It was about this time that her second child, Mary Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1558), was born. She returned to England in September 1558, having benefited from the repeal of the Dudley attainder (4 &amp; 5 Philip and Mary c. 12) passed earlier in the year. In January 1559 she was appointed a gentlewoman &#145;without wages&#146; of Elizabeth I's privy chamber  (TNA: PRO, LC 2/4/3/104), and thereafter, like her brothers, was at the centre of the new court. In the autumn of 1559 the queen employed her to tell the imperial ambassador that Charles von Habsburg, archduke of Styria, should visit her immediately. When Elizabeth later hedged the proposal with a number of qualifications, Mary Sidney claimed that the queen and her brother had exploited her.<br>
<br>Sidney returned from Ireland at the end of 1559. Mary Sidney's service at court was thereafter shaped by the demands of her family and her husband's public career (in particular his appointment as lord president of the council in the marches of Wales in 1560 and then his three postings as lord deputy of Ireland). In October 1560 she used Robert Dudley's house at Kew for the birth of her third child, her daughter Elizabeth (who died in Dublin in 1567). In 1561 she accompanied her husband to the marches, and her fourth child, Mary (1561&#150;1621) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13040/', "Herbert, Mary")</script>], the future countess of Pembroke, was born on 27 October at Tickenhall, Worcestershire. Her most dramatic if unfortunate service in the privy chamber occurred in October 1562 when she nursed Elizabeth through her near-fatal attack of smallpox. Sidney's account of the effect on their lives in his &#145;Memoir of services&#146; in March 1583 deserves quotation in full. It follows his complaints about the queen's failure to reward his manifold services and her claims that he was living too extravagantly:<blockquote>I spend above xxxli a weke, here some will object that I upon the same kepe my wief and her followers. True it is she is now with me and hath ben this half yere and before not in many yeres and if both she and I had our foode and house roome free as we have not in conscience, we have deserved it. For my parte I am not idle but every daye I work in my function and she for her ould service and marks (yet remaining in her face) taken in the same meriteth her meat. When I went to Newhaven [Le Havre] I lefte her a full faire Ladye in myne eye at least the fayerest, and when I retorned I found her as fowle a ladie as the smale pox could make her, which she did take by contynuall attendance of her majesties most precious person (sicke of the same disease) the skarres of which (to her resolute discomforte) ever syns hath don and doth remayne in her face, so as she lyveth solitairilie <i>sicut Nicticorax in domicilio suo</i> [&#145;like a night-raven in the house&#146;, Psalm 102, verse 6] more to my charge then if we had boorded together as we did before that evill accident happened. (TNA: PRO, SP 12/159, fol. 38<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>)</blockquote>There is no evidence to support claims that Mary Sidney only appeared in public afterwards in a mask. This seems to have originated in a comment by Sir Fulk Greville that &#145;she chose rather to hide herself from the curious eyes of a delicate time than to come upon the stage of the world with any manner of disparagement&#146;  (Hay, 18). Neither her court service nor their married life came to an end in 1562 as Sidney seems to imply; he often wrote in an exaggerated manner and this is no exception. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25524/', "Robert Sidney (1563&#150;1626)")</script> was born at Penshurst on 19 November 1563 and Ambrosia (<i>d</i>. 1575) was born in 1564 or 1565. Mary Sidney accompanied her husband to Dublin at the end of 1565 when he took up his first lord deputyship, losing her &#145;whole apparail and all her jewels&#146; when one of their ships was wrecked on the voyage over  (TNA: PRO, SP 15/12/245). In 1567 she succumbed to the strains of the criticisms of him, &#145;as she fell greveously sick upon the same and in that sicknes remayned ones in traunce above fifty-two houres, upon whose recoverie I sent her into England&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/159, fol. 38<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Mary Sidney did not accompany her husband to Ireland for his second lord deputyship at the end of 1568, thanks probably to her pregnancy with her last child, Thomas (1569&#150;1595), who was born on 25 March 1569. Sidney expected her and their son Philip to join him in 1570 but he was recalled in March 1571 instead. After his second recall he spent most of his time in Wales and she at court, and this seems to have been the period when they lived apart most extensively. Thanks to her unwaged status in the privy chamber, Mary was dependent on annual stipends from her husband. More of her correspondence survives from this period than for any other and, like her husband's, it has a definitely querulous tone. Both complained increasingly of ill health and of Elizabeth's failure to reward their various services. In May 1572 Mary Sidney interceded with William Cecil, Baron Burghley, lord treasurer, to have the promised offer of a barony to Sidney withdrawn if it was not accompanied by an increase in his estate. Accommodation at court was another issue, over which she appears to have gone on a virtual strike in 1574, by refusing to attend if she did not retain the chambers she had come to regard as hers. There has been a temptation to interpret this incident as a form of political harassment by the new lord chamberlain, her brother-in-law, Thomas Radcliffe, third earl of Sussex. But if Sussex displayed a certain officiousness on taking up a new post, the Sidneys' well-cultivated sense of injustice was undoubtedly a factor.<br>
<br>After the death of Ambrosia at Ludlow, Shropshire, in February 1575, Sidney received one of Elizabeth's famous letters of condolence and an invitation to send young Mary to court as a maid of honour. The family as a group joined the progress to Kenilworth in 1575, where Lady Sidney killed a buck. It was from Kenilworth that Sidney departed on what became his last lord deputyship, but this time there appears to have been no question of his wife's accompanying him. In the spring of 1577 she was superintending the arrangements for Mary's wedding to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13028/', "Henry Herbert, second earl of Pembroke")</script>, probably at Penshurst. Her court career came to an end some eighteen months later. On 6 July 1579 Don Bernardino de Mendoza, the Spanish ambassador, reported that a sister of the earl of Leicester (Robert Dudley), of whom the queen was very fond and to whom she had given rooms at court, had retired to her own house. Ill health was probably the cause, although by 1582 she had joined her husband at Ludlow. In March 1583 Sidney alluded to the possibility that he could remarry and have a second family as his wife was not &#145;so healthie&#146;. As it transpired, his health gave out first and he died on 5 May 1586; but although she attended his funeral at Penshurst in June Mary did not survive him for very long  (Coll. Arms, Dethick's book, fols. 1&#150;2). She died on 9 August, possibly at her son Philip's lodgings in Walsingham House, London, and was then buried with full dignities in her husband's tomb at Penshurst.<br>
<br>The Sidneys were in some respects the golden couple of the court in the early years of Elizabeth's reign. But from the end of the 1560s they became increasingly embittered by what they regarded as shabby treatment at the queen's hands. The extent to which they were justified is still debated. The nature of their relations with Elizabeth in the later years is best expressed in a letter of Mary Sidney's, written during the course of the dispute over accommodation in 1574: &#145;old Lord Harry and his old Moll [probably Elizabeth's nicknames for them] will do as well as the[y] can in [accepting?] lyck good friends the small portion alotted our long servis in Courght; which as lyttle as hit is, seams somethynge to mooche&#146;  (Collins, 1.272).<br>
