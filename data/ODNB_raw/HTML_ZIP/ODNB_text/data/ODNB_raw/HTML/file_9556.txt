<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  Gerald  fitz James</span>, fourteenth earl of Desmond  (<em>c.</em>1533&#150;1583), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9560/', "James fitz John Fitzgerald, thirteenth earl of Desmond (d. 1558)")</script>, and More 
    (or Maud; <i>d</i>. 1548)
  , daughter of Sir Mulroney MacShane O'Carroll, lord of Ely O'Carroll. In 1550 he married Joan (<i>d</i>. 1565), the daughter and sole heir of James fitz Maurice Fitzgerald, tenth earl of Desmond, and widow of Sir Francis Bryan and of James Butler, earl of Ossory and Ormond. Gerald succeeded his father in 1558, doing homage before Lord Deputy Sussex at Waterford on 28 November. He was graciously received by Queen Elizabeth I and confirmed in all of the hereditary Desmond lands, offices, and privileges by her on 22 June 1559. However, despite close marriage connections, he also inherited deep hostility to Thomas Butler, tenth earl of Ormond.<br>
<br>In the feud between the houses of Desmond and Ormond each was backed by rival factions in England, the earl of Leicester supporting Desmond and Sussex upholding the house of Ormond, while in Ireland Sir Henry Sidney supported Desmond and Sir William Fitzwilliam upheld Ormond. In 1560 Desmond inflamed the traditional rivalry when he quarrelled with Ormond about wine prisage in the ports of Youghal and Kinsale and about his alleged rights to lands on the River Suir, both also claimed by Butler. The two earls were summoned to submit their claims in person to the queen. Ormond, cousin to the queen and consistently loyal, complied immediately but Desmond did not appear at court until May 1562 and then only with a huge retinue. He was charged with open defiance of the law in Ireland. When he refused to make humble submission he was at once committed to the custody of the lord treasurer to teach him a lesson, as the queen wrote to Joan, his countess (who also happened to be Ormond's mother). Although released in 1564, Desmond was not permitted to return to Ireland until he had agreed to keep all measures essential to law and order, particularly the suppression of the old Gaelic laws and customs.<br>
<br>By October 1564 these undertakings were soon forgotten when Desmond was again in feud with Ormond, invading his territory and killing his tenants and his cattle as well as being mixed up in the dynastic rivalries of the O'Briens, the earl of Thomond, and his rival Sir Donall O'Brien. The death of Desmond's wife on 2 January 1565 seems to have emboldened him to enforce claims to disputed lands and to recover arrears of rents and services, this time against Maurice Fitzgerald, Viscount Decies, who enlisted the willing support of the earl of Ormond to free himself of the demands of his feudal overlord. On 8 February 1565 the two rival armies met at the ford of Affane on the Blackwater in co. Waterford. Desmond was wounded in the thigh and taken prisoner by Ormond but soon released. Affane is remarkable in that it was the last private battle fought out between two noblemen in the British Isles. Both earls were once more summoned by an outraged queen to appear at court. While Desmond arrived in Liverpool seasick and wounded and in the custody of Captain Nicholas Heron, Ormond was already at court where charges and counter-charges of high treason were bandied about.<br>
<br>However, both earls submitted and promised to keep the peace, entering into recognizances of &pound;20,000 each. On 20 January 1566 Sir Henry Sidney was sworn in as lord deputy and was told of the earls' reconciliation. But their feud was deep-seated. Sidney, especially after his tour of Munster in January 1567&#151;predominantly through Desmond lands in Cork, Kerry, Limerick, and Waterford&#151;and after an examination held in Youghal of the causes of the feud between the earls, found that the disputed lands were in the possession of Ormond &#145;at the time of the fray making&#146; and saw in Desmond the chief cause of the turbulent state of the province of Munster. &#145;From this time forward, nor never since&#146;, he wrote to Elizabeth, &#145;found I any willingness in him to come to any conformity or good order&#146;, but on the contrary found him to be &#145;a man void of judgment to govern and will to be ruled&#146;. This change of heart on the part of the lord deputy may have been one reason for the earl of Desmond's future rebelliousness, but he did fear a conspiracy between the government and Ormond to bring about the downfall of his house, especially as Sidney sought to abolish the dependence of the lesser Munster nobility on Desmond. The power of the over-mighty subject, as exemplified by Desmond's liberty of Kerry, and his local ambitions and stress on Gaelic rights, dues, and services there, was increasingly at odds with the new drive for centralized power seen in the introduction of provincial assemblies in Munster and Connaught in 1569. Ormond's kinship with Elizabeth, however, protected his liberty of Tipperary from similar attacks from Dublin. Following the judgment at Youghal, Sidney arrested Desmond at Kilmallock in co. Limerick and had him incarcerated in Dublin Castle, leaving Desmond's brother Sir John of Desmond, of whose loyalty Sidney felt more assured, in charge of the earl's lands.<br>
<br>In August 1567 Sidney left Ireland. Robert Weston and Sir William Fitzwilliam were sworn in as lords justices in his absence; they promptly had Sir John of Desmond imprisoned with his brother Gerald, and had them both sent over to be confined in the Tower of London where they remained until midwinter 1570. With the deterioration of Sir John's health, both were then placed under house arrest and the supervision of Sir Warham St Leger at Southwark who, judging by his complaints to the privy council, had difficulty in restraining the earl from ranging abroad at will into sundry parts of London. Desmond's second wife, Eleanor Butler (<i>d</i>. 1636&times;8), daughter of Edmund Butler, Lord Dunboyne, remained with him in England until his release. In 1572 he attempted to bribe Martin Frobisher to help him escape by sea, as Frobisher informed Burghley. By then Sir John Perrot had set up the provincial council of Munster, and ruled by martial law, a direct affront to Desmond's palatine jurisdiction. Perrot did not want the earl back in Ireland but conceded that Sir John of Desmond be allowed to return. Perrot marvelled at the queen's leniency to &#145;a man rather meet to keep Bedlam than to come to a new reformed country&#146;&#151;this comment and others of his contemporary detractors encouraged later historians to surmise, but without proof, that the earl was probably insane.<br>
<br>On 25 March 1573, after signing warrants for future good behaviour and a comprehensive list of articles to be observed by him, Desmond was allowed back to Ireland. But once in Dublin he was promptly rearrested and imprisoned in the castle whence he wrote to the earl of Leicester to plead for him with the queen for the restoration of his lands and castles. He escaped from Dublin Castle on 11 November, the same day as Perrot's departure. In Perrot's absence Desmond reclaimed his lands, castles, liberties, and privileges in Munster. Two attempts made in June 1574&#151;one by Edward Fitzgerald, brother of the earl of Kildare, and the other by Walter Devereux, earl of Essex&#151;failed to get him to surrender unconditionally. Yet Desmond protested his loyalty. He was pressed by Sir William Fitzwilliam to surrender certain castles and to abolish Gaelicized dues and services, coign and livery being the most burdensome. But he refused, and was supported in that stance by his kinsmen who then, on 18 July, bound themselves on oath &#145;to maintain and defend this our advice against the lord deputy or any others that will covet the earl's inheritance&#146;  (Morrin, 2.109).<br>
<br>Desmond was then proclaimed a traitor with a price on his head. Sir William Fitzwilliam and Ormond advanced into Munster in August 1574, captured Derrinlaur Castle near Clonmel, and put the garrison to the sword. On 2 September Desmond appeared in Cork to make a humble submission and on 10 September he put all his lands in trust for himself and his wife during their joint lives and made provision for his daughters and son James; Lord Dunboyne (his father-in-law), Lord Power, and Sir John FitzEdmund Fitzgerald of Cloyne were the trustees. These family arrangements and enfeoffments may indicate that Desmond was contemplating all-out rebellion on his own part; but that he was then in league with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9562/', "James fitz Maurice Fitzgerald (d. 1579)")</script>, his cousin, in his search for allies in France, Spain, and at the papal court, is not borne out by his relationship with Lord Deputy Sidney. On the contrary, he kept Sidney informed of fitz Maurice's continental negotiations. However, he continued to rail to Sidney against the arbitrary conduct of the new president of Munster, Sir William Drury, who was determined to use the presidency to undermine the power of both Desmond and Ormond. On 27 February 1576 Sidney wrote to the privy council: &#145;so long as any subject has any jurisdiction palatine &hellip; there will be no perfect reformation in Munster&#146;  (Brewer and Bullen, 2.41). His policy was clear: the Irish lords had to abandon private armies and jurisdictions and become landlords in the English sense, not Gaelic warlords.<br>
<br>No one clear motive for Desmond's gradual drift to all-out rebellion can be isolated, but the invasion of James fitz Maurice's allies (17 July 1579) and the change in government personnel indicate the steps. Sidney resigned office and finally left Ireland on 12 September 1578; Drury was sworn in as lord justice but due to ill health he was replaced by Lord Justice Sir Nicholas Malby, the vigorous governor of Connaught, and by the equally militant Sir William Pelham. Desmond's brothers Sir John and James joined fitz Maurice's rebellion but the earl was reluctant. Yet he had to appear belligerent to keep authority over the followers of his rebellious brothers. Desmond, though he showed no strong religious feelings, was influenced by the preaching and rhetoric of Nicholas Sander, the papal envoy, who was at pains to make the invasion a Catholic crusade and excite a nationwide rebellion. In any case, after the killing of fitz Maurice on 18 August 1579 in co. Limerick, the earl of Desmond became the focus of attention from Catholic Europe, principally Rome and Spain, whether he liked it or not. Through the network of Jesuits, friars, and English recusants he became the potential leader of the Catholic cause, even though his brother Sir John headed the rebel army after fitz Maurice's death.<br>
<br>These pressures and the ambitions of the other Fitzgeralds pushed Desmond into open support for the rebellion over the next four years. On 2 November 1579 he was proclaimed traitor and attainted. He marched on Youghal which he sacked and burned; his ally the earl of Clancar did the same at Kinsale. In March and April 1580 Sir William Pelham took the Desmond castles of Carrigafoyle, Askeaton, their ancestral home, and Ballyloughan, Desmond's remaining fortress. In June Desmond and Sander narrowly escaped capture by Pelham. By August 1580 Lord Grey of Wilton was sent as lord deputy to quell a rebellion which was rapidly spreading outside Munster. On 12&#150;13 September 1580 a papal force of Italians and Spaniards landed at the fortress of D&uacute;n an &Oacute;ir at Smerwick, but Desmond made no apparent attempt to come to their aid. On 7&#150;9 November Grey attacked and massacred the garrison after they had surrendered. Meanwhile, of Desmond's brothers, Sir James was captured and executed at Limerick on 4 August 1580 and Sir John was killed near Castlelyons, co. Cork, by Captain Zouche in December 1581.<br>
<br>Desmond appealed to Admiral Winter, then cruising off the Irish coast to intercept Spanish shipping, to transport him to England to beg his pardon personally from the queen. Captain Zouche's company of 450 men was sent to hunt down the earl. On 15 June 1581 he was surprised near Castlemaine, Kerry, but he escaped into the woods in a pass in the Galtee Mountains in Aherlow, co. Tipperary. During the winter of 1581 he was again almost captured at Kilmallock, and by January 1583, when Ormond was commanded to destroy his hereditary enemy, Desmond had still made two remarkable escapes. Sir Geoffrey Fenton, the secretary of the Dublin council, among others, dearly wanted Desmond assassinated. His support was already dwindling because a proclamation offering pardon to any Munster rebels who submitted deprived him of most of his followers. Deserted by his countess Eleanor in June 1583, and by all except for a chaplain, two horsemen, one kerne, and a boy, he went from one hiding place to another evading capture on the borders of west Cork and east Kerry. On Monday 11 November 1583 he was surrounded by five soldiers led by Owen MacDonnell O'Moriarty from the garrison at Castlemaine, near Tralee, in a cave in the Glanaginty woods and slaughtered; Daniel O'Kelly beheaded him and sent the head to England, thereby gaining his reward.<br>
<br>According to tradition, Desmond's body was taken to a mountain churchyard near Castlemaine for burial. His widespread estates were forfeited by the 1582 act of attainder which marked the demise of the house of Desmond, thus closing the medieval history of Munster and paving the way for its subsequent plantation. By his second marriage Desmond had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9563/', "James fitz Gerald Fitzgerald, known as the Queen's Earl")</script>, another son, Thomas, and four daughters, Margaret, Joan, Catherine, and Ellen. His widow was eventually pardoned and pensioned by the queen.<br>
