<span class="headword">Severn,  Merlyn</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Dorothy Susan Harvey]</span>  (1897&#150;1973), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born at 18 Cheyne Row, Chelsea, London, on 8 August 1897, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73039/', "Sir (Henry) Paul Harvey")</script>, civil servant and compiler of reference books, and his wife, Ethel Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Persse (1873&#150;1966). Adopting the name Merlyn Severn, she left an autobiographical account of her photographic career, <span class="italic">Double Exposure</span> (1956), that deliberately omitted all personal details; she constructed an impression of a life that was designed to authenticate her identity as a photographer and an artist. We are invited to judge her only by her work, her attitudes, her career, and her self-perception. Most remarkable is the diversity of her photographic record, which reflects her extraordinary respect for humanity, animals, and nature. She was a pioneering photojournalist in many fields, but especially in dance photography.<br>
<br>In January 1936, after a brief and unsuccessful career as a sculptor, Severn left Cheltenham to settle in London. She taught herself photography and, with the help of the aesthetic theorist Arnold Haskell, was given the freedom to photograph the dancers of Michel Fokine's Blum Company opening their season at the Alhambra Theatre in June 1936. Later that year she published <span class="italic">Ballet in Action</span>, the first serious study of choreography and dancing ever produced in Britain. Severn, labelled by Haskell as the first photographic critic of the ballet, not only contributed to the elevation of ballet in Britain as an art form and produced a valuable record of its history but also developed innovative approaches to dance photography. The success of <span class="italic">Ballet in Action</span> was followed by her equally successful one-person show at the Batsford Gallery in North Audley Street from 9 to 16 July 1937. Six of her photographs from the <span class="italic">Ballet in Action</span> series were accepted by the London Salon of Photography in 1937.<br>
<br>Severn was not only the first to photograph ballet &#145;in performance&#146;, starting the trend of action dance photographs, but also contributed numerous photographs of ballets and valuable technical photographic advice. Her technical judgement and her ability to capture the suggestion of movement in her photographs were revolutionary in dance photography; all previous photography of dance in Britain remained limited to poses. Severn's technical and stylistic skills enabled her to photograph dancers successfully during the performance, something previously thought impossible due to the difficulties of lighting.<br>
<br>Severn had planned to travel as a freelancer to Java in the East Indies to photograph Javanese dancers but was prevented from doing so because of war. During the Second World War she worked for the WAAF in &#145;special duties&#146;, or radar, and later spent a long internment on Guernsey under German occupation. After the war she returned to photographing the ballet, but this time she encountered many bureaucratic difficulties and faced increasing sensitivities towards copyright issues. She published her second book, <span class="italic">Sadler's Wells Ballet at Covent Garden</span>, in March 1946.<br>
<br>Severn was employed by <span class="italic">Picture Post</span> from 1945 to 1947 as a full-time staff photographer and continued to freelance for the magazine for the following nine years. Her work exemplifies the diverse contexts in which photography was used in journalism between 1930 and 1960, as well as the artistic techniques and developments of the medium. Her representation of the art of photography and self-presentation reveal her resistance to the prevailing stereotypes of the time. While <span class="italic">Picture Post</span> employed many freelance women journalists and photographers, Severn was the only one to be a salaried full-time employee. The extensive freedom that she experienced as a woman photojournalist set her apart from many other women working in the field. She was unique in her individuality and resistance to conformity, and often fought against being assigned stories that were thought fit for women to cover. She not only managed to avoid such stereotypical reportage but also often refused stories that she felt had no photographic potential. Her full-time status enabled her to participate in the <span class="italic">Picture Post</span> tradition of allowing its photojournalists to suggest stories of their own&#151;a custom of which she took full advantage. On average she seems to have contributed four to five stories per year.<br>
<br>Severn's work at <span class="italic">Picture Post</span> eventually led her to cover a series of successful stories in the Belgian Congo and Ruanda-Urundi. In Africa she worked as a freelancer for <span class="italic">Picture Post</span>, received a commission from the South African Tourist Corporation to photograph lions, and collaborated with Hugh Tracey on a book, <span class="italic">African Dances of the Witwatersrand Gold Mines</span>, published by the African Music Society. Her touristic account, <span class="italic">Congo Pilgrim</span> (1952), and her autobiography, <span class="italic">Double Exposure</span>, leave records of her personal and artistic development during her seven years in Africa. Her recollections of that continent reveal her intense fascination with the ways in which her subjects, whether human or animal, expressed themselves and her genuine desire to understand the meanings attached to their methods of expression. She was strikingly perceptive and sympathetic to the situation of the colonized African. In Africa she found a world in which dance and culture were intimately connected&#151;a relationship she found absent in the dance that she photographed in England. She found also an atmosphere within which she could freely work and a culture with which she felt comfortable. She returned to dance photography and became absorbed in the signification of dance in African culture.<br>
<br>Severn's photographic aims set her apart from the prevailing trends of photojournalism and appear more compatible with those of the artist. Her individuality as a photojournalist manifested itself in her approach to photography&#151;one based on an apolitical stance and a reliance on intuition and &#145;unconsciousness&#146; in order to capture a sense of naturalism in her work. Her perspective on photography, her artistic approaches, and her reliance on inspiration, instinct, and empathy for her subjects remained constant throughout her life. Such an identity as a photographer surfaces through her distinctive narrative photography and the very visual language that she developed in her writing.<br>
<br>Severn's photographic and literary legacy reveals her transference in different media of artistic and personal expressions&#151;first through sculpture, then through the camera, and ultimately through words. She had a need to understand the subject that she photographed; her sustained interest in dance was fundamental to her life and photographic career, and her sensitivity to the cultural role of dance is apparent in both her writings and her photographs. She understood European ballet as an aesthetic and impersonal style of dance, one which offered great potential for photographic experimentation. Therefore she chose to detach herself from the dancers, deeming their own personalities irrelevant to their performance roles, and appreciated ballet purely for its aesthetic and theatrical qualities. In Africa she found dance and life united. She understood African dance as &#145;an authentic example of that cosmic reality which makes men dance together for the joy of dancing and for the proof of living&#146;  (Severn, <span class="italic">Double Exposure</span>, 180). She affirmed her commitment to Africa by going to live in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia, about 1956. After returning to Britain she lived at Plantation Close, Birch Road, Aller Park, Newton Abbot, Devon, and died at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, Exeter, on 12 November 1973.<br>
