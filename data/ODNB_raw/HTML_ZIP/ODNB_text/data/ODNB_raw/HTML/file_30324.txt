<span class="headword">Abney, Sir  William de Wiveleslie</span>  (1843&#150;1920), <span class="occ">civil servant and photographic scientist</span>, was born at Derby on 24 July 1843, the eldest son of Edward Henry Abney (<i>bap</i>. 1811, <i>d</i>. 1892), vicar of St Alkmund's, Derby, afterwards prebendary of Lichfield, and Catharina, daughter of Jedediah Strutt of Greenhall, Belper. Through his mother, he was the great-great-grandson of Jedediah Strutt (1726&#150;1797), the inventor and partner of Richard Arkwright. He married Agnes Mathilda, daughter of Edward William Smith of Tickton Hall, near Beverley in the East Riding of Yorkshire, on 4 August 1864. They had one son and two daughters. After Agnes's death in 1888, he married Mary Louisa, daughter of the Revd Eward Nathaniel Mead, of East Barnet, Hertfordshire, on 3 December 1889. They had a daughter.<br>
<br>Abney was educated at Rossall School in Lancashire and the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. In 1861 he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Engineers, and he served in the sappers and miners at Bombay before being transferred to the public works department in 1865. Two years later he returned to England and was stationed at Chatham, where he developed the Abney level, a surveying instrument for use during military reconnaissance, which was cheaper and more versatile than its predecessors. In 1871 Abney was appointed assistant to the instructor in telegraphy at the School of Military Engineering, and shortly afterwards he was given a small chemical laboratory and photographic darkroom in the electrical school. He published <span class="italic">Instruction in Photography for Use at the School of Military Engineering, Chatham</span> in the same year and also became an active member of the Royal Photographic Society of London (later the Royal Photographic Society). <span class="italic">Instruction in Photography</span> was very popular and the eleventh edition was published in 1905. He was promoted to captain in 1873, and was always called Captain Abney until 1900, when he was knighted. His work demonstrated the importance of photography to the armed forces for surveying and reconnaissance and it was removed from the supervision of the instructor in electricity to form part of a new school of chemistry and photography in 1874. Abney became an assistant instructor in this new department, and in the same year was also listed as an assistant instructor in surveying. He was chosen to organize the photographic observation in Egypt of the transit of Venus in 1874. Afterwards, as a result of his Egyptian trip, he wrote <span class="italic">Thebes and its Five Great Temples</span> (1876).<br>
<br>Although Abney did not formally retire from the army until 1881, he left Chatham in 1877 to become an inspector of science schools of the Department of Science and Art at South Kensington. He was highly regarded by his new employers and he was promoted assistant director for science in 1884 and director for science in 1893. When the Department of Science and Art was replaced by the Board of Education in 1899 he was made a principal assistant secretary. Abney retired in 1903, following the changes brought about by Balfour's <span class="roman">Education Act</span>. He then became an adviser to the science department of the Board of Education and a member of the advisory council for education to the War Office. He was also appointed lecturer on colour vision at the Imperial College of Science and Technology in South Kensington in 1909.<br>
<br>The middle of the nineteenth century saw several high-powered commissions set up to investigate the state of science education in England. The Taunton Commission of 1868 had allowed government to make grants for building school laboratories, and the Devonshire Commission of 1872 strongly supported secondary science education. Abney himself gave evidence to the Samuelson Commission of 1881&#150;4. One of Abney's major tasks was to approve grants for setting up and fitting out school laboratories. At Chatham he had become convinced of the importance of practical work in scientific education and at the Department of Science and Art he considered the establishment of new school laboratories as his particular mission. At first he sought to lay down a standard plan for these laboratories, based on his experience at Chatham, but eventually practically any plan was accepted if it met the &#145;absolute necessities of instruction&#146;. His approach was later criticized for creating an excessive uniformity, but the numbers speak for themselves. When Abney joined the department only a handful of school laboratories existed, but in 1903, when he retired, 1165 laboratories were recognized by the Board of Education.<br>
<br>Abney also pursued photographic research in a darkroom, which was entered from the galleries of the South Kensington Museum (on the site of the Victoria and Albert Museum), but may have actually been in the neighbouring Royal College of Science (later Imperial College). It was described in 1883 as a cold and draughty backstairs lumber room. His studies were thorough and precise rather than inspired, and he must have found it difficult to balance his scientific work with his administrative duties. As early as 1873, at Chatham, he had developed the papyrotype photolithographic process which used paper coated with bichromated gelatin to create the initial image, and in his early years at South Kensington he concentrated on improving photographic emulsions, the development of prints, and photographic printing paper&#151;then in its infancy. He introduced hydroquinone as a developer in 1880 and the gelatino-citrochloride emulsion printing process in 1881, which became the basis of POP (Printing Out Paper), which was very popular with amateur photographers at the end of the nineteenth century. In this period Abney published <span class="italic">Emulsion Processes in Photography</span> (1878), later retitled <span class="italic">Photography with Emulsions</span>, the third edition appearing in 1885, and the popular <span class="italic">Treatise on Photography</span> (1878) which reached its tenth edition in 1905.<br>
<br>As a result of this work Abney developed a photographic emulsion that was sensitive in the infra-red region of the electromagnetic spectrum. William Herschel had discovered that the sun radiated energy beyond the red end of the visible spectrum in 1800, but no permanent visible record of the infra-red spectrum of the sun was possible until Abney used his new emulsion for this purpose. More importantly, with his colleague Major-General Edward Robert Festing FRS he studied the infra-red absorption spectra of numerous organic and inorganic chemical compounds. They established in 1881 that the absorption bands were associated with groups of atoms in the molecules rather than the molecule as a whole, and tentatively correlated different bands to specific groupings, for instance the nitro group in nitrobenzene. In the hands of later physicists and chemists, infra-red spectroscopy became an important method of identifying such groups.<br>
<br>Abney was also interested in the development of colour photography, and saw the need to clarify the whole field of colour analysis and colour vision beforehand. He developed a colour photometer in 1885, and carried out a wide range of colour measurements with Festing. He also investigated the sensitivity of the eye to light and colour. On the basis of his research he introduced his own system of colour photography in 1905. It employed three separate lenses and colour separation positives, but was not a commercial success. Abney published <span class="italic">Trichromatic Theory of Colour</span> (1914) on the basis of his research, and he tested the colour vision of a merchant seaman as his last official act in the summer of 1920 in his colour vision laboratory at Imperial College. Appropriately for someone engaged in the administration of science education, Abney was an enthusiastic lecturer and gave several series of popular lectures on &#145;the chemical action of light&#146; and on the subject of light and colour.<br>
<br>Abney was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1876 at the relatively early age of thirty-three, and was awarded the society's Rumford medal for his work on spectrum analysis in 1882. For his work at the Department of Science and Art, he was made CB in 1888 and KCB in 1900. Abney was prominent in the London-based scientific societies&#151;serving as president of the Royal Photographic Society in 1892&#150;4, 1896, 1903, and 1905; president of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1893&#150;5; and president of the Physical Society in 1895&#150;7. He was also chairman of the Royal Society of Arts in 1903&#150;5, and was elected a vice-president of the Royal Institution in 1905 and a member of the council of the Chemical Society in 1882&#150;4. A keen traveller, he often visited the Swiss and Italian Alps and published <span class="italic">The Pioneers of the Alps</span> (1887) with Carus Dunlop Cunningham. He listed painting, golf, and shooting as his interests in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span>. Abney also helped to establish a national collection of photographic history at the Science Museum in South Kensington, now transferred to the National Museum of Photography, Film, and Television at Bradford.<br>
<br>Abney lived for many years at Rathbone Lodge, South Bolton Gardens, not far from his office in South Kensington, and at a country residence at Measham Hall in Leicestershire. He went to Folkestone in autumn 1920 because of his failing health, and died there, at 12 Grimstone Avenue, of kidney failure and bronchitis on 2 December 1920.<br>
