<span class="headword">Kirkman,  Francis</span>  (<em>b. </em>1632, <em>d.</em> in or after 1680), <span class="occ">bookseller and writer</span>, was born on 23 August 1632, the eldest son of Francis Kirkman (1602&#150;1661), a citizen of London and member of the Blacksmiths' Company, and his wife, Ellen. Many details of his biography are drawn from his <span class="italic">The Unlucky Citizen</span> (1673), a picaresque tale that has been taken as autobiographical. Kirkman was inflamed from an early age with dreams of adventure, which were indirectly fulfilled by his career in the book trade. He had little interest in school, but began collecting chivalric romances and taught himself French in order to translate the sixth book of <span class="italic">Amadis de Gaul</span>. His parents forbade his seeking his fortune abroad or training as a bookseller; apprenticed to a scrivener, he ran away. His next master, a disreputable scrivener, allowed Kirkman to furnish the office with his impressive-looking library of romances. In 1652, while still an apprentice, he sacrificed most of his library to finance the publication of his schoolboy translation of <span class="italic">Amadis</span>. Also in 1652 he published <span class="italic">The Loves and Adventures of Clerio &amp; Lozia</span>, claiming it too as a translation from French. In 1653 Kirkman set up a tiny shop near the Tower, practising the trades of scrivener and bookseller, and became a freeman of the Blacksmiths' (he was never a member of the Stationers' Company). In May 1654 he presented Ann Phillips with an inscribed copy of his <span class="italic">Amadis</span> (Bodl. Oxf., Vet.A.3.e.559). They were married in June 1654 in St Olave, Hart Street, where their daughter, Elizabeth, was baptized in May 1655. On his father's death in 1661 Kirkman quickly squandered a sizeable inheritance.<br>
<br>Although a poor manager of money, Kirkman applied sound entrepreneurial instincts to meeting new demands for leisure reading. By the later 1650s he had become a theatre lover, and soon after the Restoration, he fell into reissuing pre-interregnum plays with Henry Marsh, Nathaniel Brook, and Thomas Johnson. The collaborators were accused of piracy, probably for their edition of Fletcher's <span class="italic">Scornfull Lady</span>. Kirkman later charged that Marsh swindled him extensively, but he took over Marsh's business on his death from the plague in 1666. Kirkman republished Marsh's 1662 <span class="italic">The Wits, or, Sport upon Sport</span> in 1672, and published a second part in 1673, preserving more of the drolls and farces performed clandestinely during the interregnum. By the end of his career Kirkman had published some twenty-five plays, including his own satire <span class="italic">The Presbyterian Lash</span> (1661), a satire on the presbyterian clergyman Zachary Clofton who was accused of whipping his maidservant, a number of republished titles, and a few plays previously extant only in manuscript, including Webster and Rowley's <span class="italic">Cure for a Cuckold</span> (1661) and <span class="italic">The Thracian Wonder</span> (1661). His most significant accomplishment, however, was his authoritative collection of English printed drama. The preface to <span class="italic">Tom Tyler and his Wife</span> (1661) listed Kirkman's collection of 690 plays, including almost every English play published to date, all available at his shop for sale or reading &#145;for a reasonable consideration&#146;. Ten years later, a preface to Danter's translation of Corneille's <span class="italic">Nicom&egrave;de</span> catalogued 806 plays. Kirkman's catalogue (incorporating the research of previous booksellers) was expanded by Gerard Langbaine the younger into the formative document of English dramatic bibliography.<br>
<br>Less widely recognized is Kirkman's similar influence on the canon of English prose romance: his preface to <span class="italic">The Famous and Delectable History of Don Bellianis of Greece</span> (1673, a loosely translated chivalric romance) surveys the available chivalric, Elizabethan, and heroic romances, its recommendations perhaps sustaining these titles' long popular success. Kirkman himself wrote fictional works in nearly every subgenre of the period. The two works published in 1652 span chivalric and heroic tastes in romance; <span class="italic">The Unlucky Citizen</span> exemplifies picaresque autobiography (and details abuses in the book trade). Kirkman's repeated publication of <span class="italic">The English Rogue</span> made a valuable commodity of that sprawling, bawdy tale. In 1666 he reissued and expanded the first part (first published in 1665) by Richard Head; he published a second part (probably of his own writing) in 1668, and third and fourth parts (claiming Head as co-author) in 1671. Kirkman also wrote what is arguably the best-developed of the fictionalized autobiographies of the famous impostor Mary Carleton, <span class="italic">The Counterfeit Lady Unveiled</span> (1673).<br>
<br>Despite recurrent financial difficulties, Kirkman had a long career in the book trade, keeping shops bearing (from 1661) the sign of John Fletcher's Head in various locations including Thames Street, Fenchurch Street, and St Paul's Churchyard. His last imprint is dated 1680.<br>
