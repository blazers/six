<span class="headword">Waldegrave, Sir  William</span>  (1636?&#150;1701), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was perhaps a son of Sir Henry Waldegrave, second baronet (1598&#150;1658), the grandfather of the first Lord Waldegrave; he was apparently closely connected with this branch of the family. He received the degree of doctor of medicine at Padua on 12 March 1659, and was admitted an honorary fellow of the College of Physicians, London, in December 1664. He was created a fellow of the college by the charter of James II in 1686, but does not appear to have been admitted as such at the <i>comitia majora extraordinaria</i> of 12 April 1687, which was specially convened for the reception of the charter and the admission of those who were thereby constituted fellows.<br>
<br>In 1689 Waldegrave was one of the seven fellows named by the college to the House of Lords as being &#145;criminals or reputed criminals&#146; (apparently Jacobites, Cook, 217). He was one of the physicians to Queen Mary of Modena and was hastily summoned, along with Sir Charles Scarburgh, to the queen in 1688, shortly before the birth of the prince of Wales, when she was in danger of miscarrying. Waldegrave was knighted by her bedside on 10 June 1688, shortly after the delivery of James Edward. He accompanied the queen and the prince on their flight to France, being at that time called first physician to the prince. He was a member of the exiled court and was appointed first physician to the king in 1695. He was married to Elizabeth Ronchi (the queen's almoner or confessor was named Giacomo Ronchi), who, in 1698, was described as a lady of the bedchamber to the queen. She was presumably also the Madam Walgrave who was one of her bedchamber women in 1684 and died at St Germain aged fifty in 1706. Waldegrave mentions no children in his will. He was described by Roger North as &#145;a prodigy of an arch-lutanist&#146;  (North, 123). Waldegrave died, aged sixty-five, in the old ch&acirc;teau at St Germain about June 1701, and was buried on 9 July.<br>
