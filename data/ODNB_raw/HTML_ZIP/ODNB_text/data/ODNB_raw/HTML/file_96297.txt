<span class="headword">Guillemard, Sir  Laurence Nunns</span>  (1862&#150;1951), <span class="occ">civil servant and colonial governor</span>, was born on 7 June 1862, the only son in the family of six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11724/', "William Henry Guillemard (1815&#150;1887)")</script>, clergyman, headmaster, and Hebrew scholar, and his wife, Elizabeth Susanna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Turner (<i>d</i>. 1887). The Guillemards were of Huguenot descent although William Guillemard keenly promoted the Oxford Movement. At the time of Laurence's birth his father was headmaster of the Royal School, Armagh. In 1869 he became vicar of Little St Mary's, Cambridge, where he remained until just before his death. Laurence Guillemard was educated at Charterhouse School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took first-class honours in the classical tripos in 1884. Having toyed with the idea of a career at the bar, he attended a crammer to prepare for the home civil service entrance examinations.<br>
<br>Guillemard entered the Home Office in 1886 and two years later was transferred to the Treasury, where he served as private secretary to the chancellor of the exchequer from 1892 to 1902. He was in the thick of Sir William Harcourt's controversial budget of 1894, which, to the alarm of the landed interest, introduced graduated death duties (estate duty), designed to meet increased navy estimates and redress social inequalities. When in 1895 the Liberal government gave way to a Conservative administration, Guillemard continued as private secretary to the chancellor, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, whose plans for retrenchment were frustrated by naval expenditure and the South African War. In 1902 Guillemard was appointed deputy chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue and on 2 July the same year he married Ellen (Ella) (<i>d</i>. 1940), elder daughter of Thomas Spencer Walker of Walsingham, Norfolk. She was Guillemard's junior by eighteen years. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>In 1908 Guillemard transferred to the Board of Customs to be its chairman. Commonly regarded as &#145;the Cinderella of the Revenue family&#146;  (Guillemard, 50), customs grew in importance as the result of the acquisition of excise duties from the Inland Revenue in 1909 and of new functions consequent upon old-age pensions legislation. In 1910 Guillemard was knighted KCB, having been made CB in 1905. Following Lloyd George's budgets and the vast growth in taxation during the First World War, the revenue raised by Customs and Excise from beer, tobacco, and spirits increased more than fourfold between 1913&#150;14 and 1920&#150;21.<br>
<br>At the end of 1919 Guillemard became governor of the Straits Settlements and high commissioner for the Malay states. This seemed a surprising appointment for a man who had spent thirty-four years in the home civil service. Lord Milner (secretary of state for the colonies) was confident that Guillemard would provide this particular colonial estate with necessary leadership in the modern management of public finance and economic development. As chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue during 1894&#150;7 Milner had worked closely with Guillemard on the formulation of estate duty and, as a member of the Lloyd George cabinet, he had been impressed by his part in raising war loans. Although he accepted with some hesitation, Guillemard was a natural optimist and departed for the East with what he regarded as &#145;special advantages&#146;: an insider's knowledge of Whitehall, an open mind regarding the problems and personalities of Malaya, and a &#145;close friendship&#146; with the secretary of state  (Guillemard, 78&#150;9). When, however, Milner left office in February 1921, Guillemard found himself with few allies in a virulent controversy that was to dog him for the remainder of his governorship and would torment the administration of British Malaya until the Japanese occupation.<br>
<br>The dispute was over the so-called policy of decentralization. British Malaya consisted of the colony of the Straits Settlements (Singapore, Penang, Malacca), four Malay states whose sovereign rulers had agreed to accept British residents and had joined in the Federated Malay States (FMS) in 1896, and five other protected Malay states that remained outside the FMS. By 1920 the fragmentation of government was obstructing efficiency while progressive centralization of the FMS was both undermining the autonomy of the rulers and impeding pan-Malayan policies. Decentralization was proposed to restore the sultans' authority and place all nine states on the same footing with a view to their closer association some time in the future. Reasonable though it may have been in conception, decentralization failed on account of the rulers' mistrust of the British, tension between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, differences between commercial, planting, and mining interests, and the ambitions of officials. In a brazen campaign to present himself as protector of the Malay rulers and, in so doing, reinforce his own standing, Sir George Maxwell strenuously resisted Guillemard's attempts to downgrade his position as chief secretary of the FMS. A Malay expert and the son of a Malay expert, Maxwell regarded Guillemard as an ignorant outsider and mustered considerable support for his views from the Malayan civil service, the business community, and &#145;old Malayans&#146; in retirement. As Maxwell's insubordination grew, Guillemard, who was by no means wholly isolated since he developed congenial relations with the rulers, adopted an entrenched position that jarred with the lightness of touch characteristic of his earlier career. What had started as a difference in approach to administrative matters deteriorated into an acrimonious power struggle between the chief secretary in Kuala Lumpur and the high commissioner in Singapore that came to overshadow successes in public works and even anxieties over rubber prices. Maxwell was forced to retire in 1926. Guillemard, who was appointed GCMG in the 1927 new year honours (he had been made KCMG in 1923), stayed until May, but he failed to advance the cause of decentralization beyond the devolution of some financial functions and the reconstruction of the federal council.<br>
<br>On their return to England Guillemard and his wife retired to Rodsall Manor, between Shackleford and Puttenham in Surrey. Physically slight, he had been a keen tennis player and continued to shoot and fish. He joined the board of the Prudential Assurance Company and in 1937 published his memoirs, <span class="italic">Trivial Fond Records</span>, which skated over his career. In April 1946 he joined Maxwell, Sir Frank Swettenham, Sir Cecil Clementi, and other senior officials, who had once bitterly contested forms of Malayan government, in protest against Whitehall's plans for the union of the Malay states. He died on 13 December 1951 at Rodsall Manor of an acute coronary thrombosis. His funeral was held at Puttenham parish church on 18 December.<br>
