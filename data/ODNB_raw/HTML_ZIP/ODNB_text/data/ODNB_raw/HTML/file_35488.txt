<span class="headword">Petavel, Sir  Joseph Ernest</span>  (1873&#150;1936), <span class="occ">engineer and physicist</span>, was born in London on 14 August 1873, the younger son of Emmanuel Petavel DD and his wife, Susanna, daughter of William Olliff, of Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire. An eminent Hebrew scholar, Emmanuel Petavel moved to England from Neuch&acirc;tel in 1863 to become minister of the Swiss church in Endell Street, London. In 1876 the family left England for Geneva, later settling in Lausanne where Joseph attended school and read engineering at the university. In 1893 he returned to England to study science and engineering at University College, London.<br>
<br>In 1896 Petavel published his first paper, written in collaboration with John Ambrose Fleming, of University College, on the alternating current arc. With the award for three years of an 1851 Exhibition grant he was able to work in the laboratories of the Royal Institution, where he made, for Fleming and James Dewar, accurate measurements of the physical properties of materials at low temperatures. His skill in design and measurement was also evident in the work he carried out as John Harling research fellow at Manchester University in 1901&#150;3, working in the new physics laboratory of Arthur Schuster. This work included the development of the &#145;Petavel gauge&#146; for measuring the variation in pressure caused by the explosion of gases, and the construction of electrical furnaces and apparatus for studying chemical action at high pressures and temperatures.<br>
<br>In 1904 Petavel spent a year in charge of the British scientific contribution to the St Louis International Exhibition where he built and operated a reproduction of Dewar's plant at the Royal Institution for the liquefaction of gases. Petavel returned in 1905 to the University of Manchester as a lecturer in mechanics. Three years later he was appointed to the Beyer chair of engineering, held from 1868 to 1905 by Osborne Reynolds, which he combined with the post of director of the Whitworth and later the John Hopkinson Engineering Laboratories. His work at Manchester was chiefly concerned with standards of light, ventilation, structural stresses, the theory of gas engines, and aeronautics, and Petavel showed himself to be a capable and efficient administrator. During the First World War not only was his laboratory working at high pressure on the design of instruments and on testing of materials, but he also spent much of his time in London serving on committees for aeronautics, on which he became a recognized authority.<br>
<br>In 1919 Petavel was appointed director of the National Physical Laboratory as successor to Sir Richard Glazebrook and he remained in this post until his death. During his directorship the laboratory grew steadily as new buildings were constructed for the study of physics, high-tension electricity, acoustics, and aeronautics. Petavel greatly extended the national and international authority and influence of his institution and successfully managed the often difficult relationship with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research which had assumed financial responsibility for the laboratory from the Royal Society at the end of the war. Those who worked with him at the laboratory recalled his hospitality, and his afternoon and moonlight parties were remembered fondly by his staff and friends. He will also be remembered for the beautifying of Bushy House and its grounds, for which he left the Royal Society a large sum.<br>
<br>Petavel, who had been elected FRS in 1907, was appointed KBE in 1920. He died, unmarried, at Bushy House, Teddington, on 31 March 1936 and was buried at Highgate cemetery.<br>
