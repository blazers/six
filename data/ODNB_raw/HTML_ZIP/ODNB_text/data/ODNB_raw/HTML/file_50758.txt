<span class="headword">Peckover,  Priscilla Hannah</span>  (1833&#150;1931), <span class="occ">peace campaigner</span>, was born on 27 October 1833 in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, third of the eight children of Algernon Peckover (1803&#150;1893) and his wife, Priscilla (1803&#150;1883). The Peckovers were a wealthy banking family, well established in the region; Priscilla's brother Alexander Peckover, first baronet (1830&#150;1910), of Wisbech, was the first Quaker peer. Priscilla Peckover's education was predominantly private and included the mastering of several European languages. She devoted her youth and early middle age to raising the three daughters of the widowed Alexander, though she also worked among the poor, organized a <span class="roman">Bible</span> class for girls, and was active in the cause of temperance.<br>
<br>From a family who were long-time supporters of the Peace Society, Peckover began her own peace activities following the yearly meeting of the Society of Friends in 1875 when she discovered that the Quaker testimony against all war was to be addressed to women as well as men. She was put in touch with the Ladies' Auxiliary of the Peace Society and, finding that it had only two hundred members, went from door to door in her <span class="roman">Bible</span> district, adapting the technique developed from her temperance work to secure peace pledges from women. Her activism seems also to have been provoked by the Anglo-Afghan and Anglo-Zulu wars in which Britain was engaged in the late 1870s. The result was the founding by Peckover in 1879 of the Women's Local Peace Association (later renamed the Peace Union), which became the central association of a network of more than thirty local groups run mostly by Quaker women and which had affiliated groups in thirty-one foreign countries. In 1881 Peckover also founded the Wisbech Local Peace Association, the annual subscription of which was a penny so as to attract the widest possible membership. It has been cited as having 8000 members by 1914, though a large majority of these were associate members comprising all those involved in affiliated bodies such as chapels, Sunday schools, Primitive Methodist colleges, and railway missions. (The number of full members according to the 1900 report was 942, when the total membership was given as 6429.) As a means of communicating between branches of the Women's Local Peace Association, Peckover began in 1882 to edit and publish a quarterly journal, <span class="italic">Peace and Goodwill</span>, which combined her own Christian peace message with relevant excerpts from other publications.<br>
<br>Both the Peace Union and the Wisbech Local Peace Association were opposed to &#145;all war&#146;, as being &#145;contrary to the mind of Christ&#146;. This stance was more explicit in its absolute pacifism than that of the Peace Society which, while reserving membership of its executive committee for absolute pacifists, asked its ordinary members simply to declare Christian opposition to war. Links between Peckover's organizations and the Peace Society&#151;to which she was a generous contributor&#151;were nevertheless strong.<br>
<br>Like other female Quaker peace activists of the period, including Ellen Robinson (1840&#150;1912) and Mary Lamley Cooke (1841&#150;1916), Peckover emphasized the importance of women to the peace cause, in particular their influence on children (for example, in her pamphlet <span class="italic">An Earnest Appeal to All Women, Everywhere</span>). The internationalism of the peace movement was also central to Peckover's activity: she financed continental peace groups, translated European peace literature into English (she learnt Danish for the specific purpose of translating peace pamphlets), and conducted correspondence with European peace activists. Peckover was also a regular attender at gatherings of the Universal Peace Congress, which took place most of the years between 1889 and 1913 having first been held in the mid-nineteenth century. She tended to view the familiar privileged social circle which met at these congresses as a microcosm of a wider internationalism, and was consequently convinced of the growing influence of the peace cause. Although she argued for international arbitration and disarmament, Peckover embodied an evangelical and educational rather than a political or pressure-group form of activism. Her greatest influence in the peace movement, alongside her financial input, was to represent Christian absolute pacifism at the Universal Peace Congress, which was often dominated by continental, secular, and non-absolutist peace views. The First World War did nothing to shake Peckover's pacifism, though it reduced the membership of the Wisbech Local Peace Association by a half, and adherents continued to fall away during the 1920s.<br>
<br>Peckover was a minister and elder of her local Quaker meeting, known for her tolerance and her quiet sense of humour as well as for her thorough knowledge of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. As president of the local Esperanto Society she was instrumental in having the <span class="roman">Bible</span> translated into Esperanto. She died a spinster at her home, Wistaria House, Wisbech, on 8 September 1931, while putting together what was to be the last edition of <span class="italic">Peace and Goodwill</span>.<br>
