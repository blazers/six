<span class="headword">Smith, Sir  Swire</span>  (1842&#150;1918), <span class="occ">promoter of technical education</span>, was born on 4 March 1842 at Wagon Fold, Keighley, Yorkshire, the elder son of the four children of George Smith (1812&#150;1902), a machine maker, and his wife, Mary Swire, of yeoman stock. He was educated at the local national school and at Wesley College, Sheffield, before serving an apprenticeship with a Keighley worsted manufacturer. By the age of twenty he was in business on his own account.<br>
<br>Smith was deeply stirred by his chance attendance in 1867 at an address on technical education by Samuel Smiles, whose theme, &#145;that the Germans and French, through their superior general education and by their application of the principles of science and art to manufactures and crafts, were making enormous progress in their industries&#146;  (Smith, <span class="italic">Technical Education</span>) to the future detriment of Britain, was to form the bedrock of his life's work. He promptly undertook the secretaryship of a drawing class at the Keighley Mechanics' Institute, and, shortly afterwards, the secretaryship of an ambitious new Keighley trade school council and of the Mechanics' Institute itself. In 1872, after he and several colleagues had investigated schools and polytechnics in France, Germany, and Switzerland, he published anonymously, for private circulation, <span class="italic">Unofficial Comments on Education at Home and Abroad</span>. This was followed in 1873 by his signed and more widely circulated <span class="italic">Educational Comparisons</span>. Realizing that elementary education formed an essential forerunner of any technical advance, he also became prominent in the fight in 1875 for a Keighley school board, and served as chairman for the first three years of its existence.<br>
<br>Smith's local agitation, together with his practical and commercial experience of textiles&#151;almost to the end of his life he operated the substantial Springfield mills at Keighley in two different partnerships and later single-handed&#151;led to his being invited to represent the woollen industry on the royal commission on technical instruction formed in 1880. Its report, presented to parliament four years later, stressed the superiority of European industrial training and in 1889 instigated the <span class="roman">Technical Instruction Act</span>, which, in Smith's words, &#145;did largely for technical education what <span class="roman">Forster's Act</span> of 1870 did for elementary education&#146;. His own services were recognized by a knighthood in 1898. Other honours testified severally to the national, regional, and local regard for his work: he received the freedom and livery of the Clothworkers' Company of the City of London, a doctorate of laws from Leeds University, and the freedom of the borough of Keighley.<br>
<br>An indefatigable committee member of the National Association for the Promotion of Technical and Commercial Education, Smith continued to utilize every opportunity for propagating his cause in articles, lectures, and addresses. He was in demand at prize-giving ceremonies of the fledgeling technical schools and colleges; prepared the textile sections of the catalogues for the London International Inventions Exhibition and the Chicago World Fair; and served as vice-chairman of a royal commission on international exhibitions. An outspoken authority also on free trade&#151;together with technical education he thought this &#145;necessary for promoting the highest welfare and efficiency of the nation and enabling it to resist competition and attack in the industrial sphere&#146;&#151;he was a founder of the West Riding Free Trade Federation and an executive member of the national Free Trade Union.<br>
<br>In 1915, at the age of seventy-three, Smith became Liberal MP for the Keighley division; he made his maiden speech, typically, on &#145;the real German rivalry&#146; in technical training. At the age of seventy-five he visited the battlefront, coming under fire at Vimy and finding the experience strangely exhilarating.<br>
<br>Fair and lively, Smith always looked younger than his actual age. Although he had an eye for the ladies, he never married. He enjoyed many travels and friendships with such famous contemporaries as John Bright, Lord Morley, and Andrew Carnegie (the last presented Smith's home town with the first Carnegie library in England), yet Keighley remained his permanent residence. &#145;The townspeople loved him&#146;, said his local obituary, &#145;not only for what he did, but for what he was, genial, buoyant, companionable, with a mirth in his nature that was almost frolicsome&#146;  (<span class="italic">Keighley News</span>, 23 March 1918). He contributed jokes to <span class="italic">Punch</span>, sang in the choir of his local Congregational church, and up to the year of his death entertained a variety of homely gatherings with humorous recitations.<br>
<br>Smith died of congestion of the lungs in a nursing home at 2 Beaumont Street, London, on 16 March 1918, following an operation on his prostate gland. He was buried four days later in Keighley cemetery.<br>
