<span class="headword">Denton,  Alexander</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1679, <em>d.</em> 1740), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was baptized at Hillesden, near Buckingham, on 25 August 1679, the second son of Alexander Denton and his wife, Hester, daughter and heir of Nicholas Herman of Middleton Stoney, Oxfordshire. His father was elected MP for Buckingham in 1689. His elder brother was Edmund Denton, first baronet, also member for Buckingham. Denton was admitted to St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in April 1697, and the following year to the Middle Temple, by which inn he was called to the bar in 1704 and to the bench in 1720.<br>
<br>The year after his call Denton was the victim of a serious threat to the independence of the bar. As one of the counsel representing the prisoners in the Aylesbury election case, on their application for habeas corpus, he was himself committed to prison by the House of Commons for a supposed breach of privilege. The case resulted in a major conflict between the two houses of parliament. It may, however, have served Denton well by bringing him to the attention of Lord Wharton, who probably supported him when he was elected to succeed his brother as member of parliament for Buckingham in 1708; he served in parliament from 1708 to 1710, and in the Irish parliament from 1709 to 1710, and then again (as king's counsel) in the English parliament from 1715 until 1722. On 3 March 1716 Denton married Catherine, daughter and heir of John Bond of Sundridge, Kent, with a fortune of &pound;20,000.<br>
<br>Denton's local connections secured his election as recorder of Buckingham, and as early as 1710 the duke of Devonshire wrote to Chief Justice Parker asking for &#145;your favour at the bar for him&#146;  (BL, Stowe MS 750, fol. 13); but his eminence in the profession was firmly secured when he was appointed attorney-general to the duchy of Lancaster in 1714, and king's counsel in 1715. He was considered for the position of solicitor-general in 1720, but passed over in favour of Philip Yorke (subsequently Lord Hardwicke). In 1722 he was appointed to the bench as one of the justices of the common pleas, the patrons at his serjeant's call being Viscount Townshend and Robert Walpole. A puisne judgeship was not the summit of his ambition, and in 1729 he secured the courtly position of chancellor to Frederick, prince of Wales, but his further aspirations were thwarted. In 1735 he wrote to Hardwicke, seeking the chief justiceship of the common pleas, offering to resign as prince's chancellor, but Hardwicke tactfully questioned whether his health would withstand the strain. In the event Thomas Reeve was appointed. On Reeve's death in 1737 Denton applied again to Walpole, alleging some &#145;court promises&#146; to support him; but Walpole thought him &#145;too old and infirm to discharge the duty&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>). The following year he was offered the office of chief baron of the exchequer when James Reynolds indicated his wish to retire, turned it down in a letter to Hardwicke on 2 July, suggesting Edmund Probyn instead, and then changed his mind almost immediately but too late. Mr Justice Abney wrote privately that he was unfit for either office, &#145;for he wanted spirit and rediness to preside in any court, and was a total stranger to the practice of the Exchequer&#146;  (Abney's reports, MS IHR 976(2), University of London).<br>
<br>Thomas Abney considered that these disappointments &#145;sat so heavy on his spirits that they contributed much to shorten his days&#146;  (Abney's reports), which ended at Bath on 22 March 1740. The final cause of death was &#145;a tedious complicated distemper of consumption and gout&#146;  (ibid.). A monument, with a bust in judicial robes, was erected at Hillesden, which suggests that he might have been buried there. A painting by Jonathan Richardson, in scarlet judicial robes, with the embroidered purse of Prince Frederick, was engraved in quarter length by George Vertue in 1731.<br>
<br>It is known that Denton wrote law reports, which were cited by contemporaries but have not yet been discovered. The obituary by Abney epitomizes his character by saying that &#145;though his parts were low and his manner heavy, yet he had taken great pains in his profession and had really more knowledge in it than those who were not intimate with him conceiv'd&#146;. As Denton and his wife had no children the estates devolved on the judge's nephew, George Chamberlayne, who also succeeded him as MP for Buckingham.<br>
