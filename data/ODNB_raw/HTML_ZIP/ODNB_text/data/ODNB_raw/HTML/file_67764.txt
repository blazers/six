<span class="headword">Silvester, Sir  John</span>, first baronet  (1745&#150;1822), <span class="occ">barrister and judge</span>, was born in London on 7 September 1745, the son of Sir John Baptist Silvester (<i>d</i>. 1789) of St Peter's, Cornhill, London, a doctor of medicine, and Alathea Catherine D'Aulnis, daughter of Colonel D'Aulnis of the Dutch service. Silvester was educated at the Merchant Taylors' School and from 1764 St John's College, Oxford; he took the degree of BCL in 1771 and was created DCL in 1818. Admitted to the Middle Temple on 19 April 1766, he was called to the bar on 8 February 1771. He was elected FRS in 1780 and FSA in 1804.<br>
<br>As a barrister Silvester was unsuccessful in Westminster Hall, but he appeared regularly at the Old Bailey and in the City of London's customary courts where, by virtue of his purchase of a City common pleadership in 1774, he enjoyed with three other pleaders monopoly of practice in the lord mayor's and sheriffs' courts. During the Gordon riots of 1780 Silvester, a &#145;loyal subject&#146; who would &#145;support the constitution of the country&#146;  (Silvester MS 7067), was made a justice of the peace for Middlesex, and on 23 April 1799 he was appointed deputy lieutenant of that county.<br>
<br>Precisely when Silvester began to practise regularly in London's criminal courts is unclear. A criminal bar was only beginning to emerge in London in the 1780s and he was among its first members. By the early 1780s he had established a lead in business at the Old Bailey, although his career there was eclipsed by the arrival of William Garrow in 1783. Somewhat unusually, Silvester appeared most frequently for the prosecution. His reputation as a barrister was unenviable: one contemporary described him as &#145;vulgar and ineloquent&#146; and commented &#145;The Prisoners Calendar he distinguishes by the elegant and humane appellation of a Bill of Fare. He is said to have made much money by his practice; if so, he has derived it from the groans of the gallows&#146;  (<span class="italic">City Biography</span>, 116&#150;17).<br>
<br>In 1790 Silvester was elected common serjeant of London and he became recorder in 1803 (he was made a bencher of the Middle Temple in the same year). On 27 December 1814 he was created a baronet (described as of Yardley House, Chingford, Essex); the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> noted that his politics had made him a favourite at court and that he &#145;presented the solitary instance of the Baronetage having been conferred on a possessor of the office of Recorder&#146;  (<span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, 1 April 1822).<br>
<br>&#145;Black Jack&#146; Silvester quickly earned a reputation for severity as a judge. He clearly favoured law and order over the rights of individuals, and he is on record as opposing any amelioration of England's &#145;bloody code&#146;, a system of criminal justice which relied on the terror of capital punishment to deter criminals. Among the papers he left are notebooks recording details of London's criminal underworld and four weighty volumes of indictment precedents. His obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> praised him for discharging his judicial duties &#145;in a faithful, zealous, and conscientious manner&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 371), but others held different opinions. Silvester was accused of demanding sexual favours from a woman who approached him to appeal for his assistance in obtaining a pardon for her husband and he was widely condemned for his severe summing up in the trial of Elizabeth Fenning, a servant-girl hanged for the attempted murder of her master and his family who was popularly believed to be innocent. A restrained assessment of Silvester's career indicated that his &#145;public character&#146; was not &#145;peculiarly calculated to inspire respect for the judicial office&#146;  (<span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, 1 April 1822).<br>
<br>Silvester was married twice: firstly, on 8 October 1772, to Susanne Hoissend (<i>d</i>. 1785), widow of Daniel Hoissend; and secondly, on 11 December 1793, to Harriet Speed (<i>d</i>. 1843), daughter of the Revd Owen Davies and widow of the Revd John Mylles Speed, vicar of Eling in Hampshire. There were no children from either marriage. Silvester died in his sleep at his home in Bloomsbury Square, London, on 30 March and was buried at Chingford church on 6 April 1822. The baronetcy passed to his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25550/', "Sir Philip Carteret Silvester")</script>.<br>
