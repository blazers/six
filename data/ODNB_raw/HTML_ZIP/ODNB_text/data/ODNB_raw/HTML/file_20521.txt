<span class="headword">Ua Conchobair,  Ruaidr&iacute;</span> <span class="st"> [Roderic O'Connor, Ruaidr&iacute; na Saide Buide]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1118), <span class="occ">king of Connacht</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20508/', "&#193;ed Ua Conchobair (d. 1067)")</script>, a member of the S&iacute;l Muiredaig branch of U&iacute; Bri&uacute;in A&iacute;, and of Caillech C&aacute;emgein, daughter of &Oacute;c&aacute;n Ua Fallamain, probably of Clann Uadach in Roscommon. He first appears on record in 1076, described as king of Connacht, submitting to the Munster king, Toirdelbach Ua Briain, who expelled him from kingship three years later. He killed the king of west Connacht, &Aacute;ed Ua Flaithbertaig, in 1079 and a family rival, Cathal Ua Conchobair, in 1082. At the battle of Conachail in 1087, assisted by the clergy of Clonmacnoise bearing the relics of St Ciar&aacute;n, he defeated his father's vanquisher, &Aacute;ed Ua Ruairc, thereby securing his family's hold on the kingship. By this stage he had probably married the first of at least four wives, the daughter of Ua hEgra of Luigne, who bore him at least one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1088 Ua Conchobair fended off a land and sea invasion by Muirchertach Ua Briain, whose forces he slaughtered, and retaliated with three raids on Munster; then he submitted at R&aacute;ith Cruachan to Ua Briain's rival for the high-kingship, Domnall Mac Lochlainn of Ailech, joining him on another such raid. In 1089 Ua Briain felled the sacred tree at Ruadbethach in Galway, though Ua Conchobair also blocked Ua Briain's attempted passage up the Shannon and joined forces with Domnall Ua Ma&iacute;l Shechnaill of Mide on a retaliatory naval raid, attacking Munster again in the two succeeding years. Clearly a threat to the authority of Muirchertach Ua Briain, Ua Conchobair was present when the latter gave hostages to Mac Lochlainn in 1090, joining him in his submission. However, his promising career was brought to a halt in 1092 when he was treacherously blinded by Flaithbertach Ua Flaithbertaig of west Connacht, his foster son with whom he had entered bonds of baptismal sponsorship on seven occasions. Revenge for the deed came when Ua Flaithbertaig was murdered six years later.<br>
<br>Ua Briain took advantage of Ruaidr&iacute; Ua Conchobair's plight to raid Connacht in 1092, though his invasion of the province two years later was unsuccessful. In 1093, Ruaidr&iacute;'s son Niall was killed by the Conmaicne; and in 1094 another son, Tadc (whose mother was a daughter of &Eacute;icnech&aacute;n Ua Cuind of Muinter Gilgain, Longford), triumphed over their enemies in west Connacht at the battle of Fidnacha, though he was himself treacherously killed in 1097 by one of his own followers. Another son, Conchobar, was killed in or before 1103, by his own foster brother, a member of Clann Chosraig of U&iacute; Bri&uacute;in Seola.<br>
<br>Thereafter another son of Ruaidr&iacute; Ua Conchobair, Domnall&#151;whose mother was a daughter of Ua Conaing of D&aacute;l Cais&#151;came to prominence, participating as king of Connacht in Ua Briain's Mag Coba campaign of 1103; but the latter deposed him in 1106, whereupon the most famous of Ruaidr&iacute;'s sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20524/', "Toirdelbach M&#243;r Ua Conchobair")</script> (whose mother, M&oacute;r (<i>d</i>. 1088), was the daughter of Toirdelbach Ua Briain) was inaugurated as king and ruled until his death in 1156. Little is known of their father, Ruaidr&iacute;, throughout all this time, other than that he died in Clonmacnoise in 1118; he may well have retired there after his blinding.<br>
