<span class="headword">Gilmour,  Sarah <span class="st"> [Sally]</span></span>  (1921&#150;2004), <span class="occ">ballet dancer</span>, was born on 2 November 1921 in Sungei Lembing, Malaya, the daughter of Colin and Florence Gilmour. Her father, who was of Scottish extraction, was then chief medical officer in Malaya. He encouraged Sally to dance and took her, from the age of three, to Miss Wright's Dancing Academy in Singapore. He recognized his daughter's stage potential, ensured that she saw Anna Pavlova dance on one of her Asian tours, and, after the family returned to London, sent the nine-year-old Sally to study ballet with Tamara Karsavina. Her academic education took place at Channing School and, from the age of twelve (after Karsavina had left London), she trained with Marie Rambert.<br>
<br>Gilmour became a key figure in the development of the dramatic tradition in twentieth-century British ballet. She joined Ballet Rambert in 1936 and danced with the company for the next seventeen years. After her parents returned to Asia, Ballet Rambert became her family&#151;especially after her mother was killed (in February 1942) and her father interned in Malaya during the Second World War. Although she briefly appeared with other companies and was invited to join the Ballets Russes, she felt that she belonged with Rambert, where her distinctive and individual qualities were appreciated. Gilmour was slim and pretty with an elfin quality rather than being a stereotypical ballerina. She was never a great technician, although perfectly able to dance Odette in <span class="italic">Swan Lake</span> act 2 and variations from <span class="italic">The Sleeping Beauty</span>. She was, nevertheless, acclaimed in the 1940s as second only to Margot Fonteyn among British ballerinas.<br>
<br>Gilmour had danced at the Ballet Club while still a student, her first roles on 26 April 1936 being a little swan in the <i>pas de quatre</i> from <span class="italic">Swan Lake</span> act 2 and in the <i>corps de ballet</i> in <span class="italic">Les sylphides</span>. Her individual talent was quickly recognized and, as early as 1937, she created Maria in Wendy Toye's <span class="italic">Cross-Garter'd</span> (inspired by <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span>). But it was in May 1939 that she captured the public's imagination, and was recognized as a star, when she danced the title role of the fey and fascinating Silvia Tebrick in the premi&egrave;re of Andr&eacute;e Howard's <span class="italic">Lady into Fox</span>. She assumed other leading roles in 1939 and led the company during the war years. She was also one of the small group who persuaded the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts to help restore Ballet Rambert after its closure in 1942.<br>
<br>Gilmour's range as a dancer encompassed both comedy and tragedy. She could be childlike as the Granddaughter in <span class="italic">Cap over Mill</span>, zany and boyish as Peter in <span class="italic">Peter and the Wolf</span>, and witty in <span class="italic">Le Boxing</span>, <span class="italic">Czernyana</span>, and <span class="italic">Gala Performance</span>. She moved her audiences to tears as the girl betrayed by the Inquisition in <span class="italic">Confessional</span> (1941) or as the innocent younger sister who had just discovered love in <span class="italic">The Fugitive</span> (1944). These last two roles were among the many choreographed for her by her then off-stage partner, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76614/', "Walter Gore")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63981/', "Hinton, Paula")</script>], whose muse she was from <span class="italic">Valse Finale</span> in 1939 through to the autobiographical <span class="italic">Winter Night</span> in 1948. She also inspired the choreographer Andr&eacute;e Howard, whose anti-racist <span class="italic">The Sailor's Return</span> (1947, like <span class="italic">Lady into Fox</span> based on a novel by David Garnett) featured Gilmour as Tulip, the negro princess who developed from a childish girl&#151;who jumped with glee at the finery her husband gave to her&#151;to a mature widow, desolate at the loss of her husband, son, home, and dignity. Gilmour was also a great Giselle (unrivalled in the dramatic act 1) in the production Marie Rambert had specially produced for her. Cyril Beaumont, a connoisseur of Giselles (including Pavlova, Karsavina, and Alicia Markova), praised Gilmour's performance for &#145;its lyric qualities, its poetry, its pathos. Other interpreters &hellip; may excel her in technical ability, but not one of them equals her in expression&#146;  (Beaumont, 115).<br>
<br>Gilmour led the Ballet Rambert on its important tour of Australia during 1947&#150;9. On this trip she met Allan Wynn (<i>d</i>. 1987), a doctor specializing in cardiology, and the son of Samuel Wynn (born Samuel Weintraub), a Jewish &eacute;migr&eacute; from Poland who became a prominent Australian winemaker. The couple were married in 1948 and later had two sons, Simon and Toby, and a daughter, Sabina. After marriage Gilmour divided her life between Australia and Britain. She returned to London to dance as a guest with Rambert, to create the role of Grace in <span class="italic">Orlando's Silver Wedding</span> (1951) for the Festival of Britain at Battersea Pleasure Gardens, and to take on the role of Louise in the musical <span class="italic">Carousel</span>. Her final London performance, dancing <span class="italic">Confessional</span>, was on 10 December 1952 at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith. During this period her husband undertook further medical studies in London before the couple returned to Australia, where they settled in Melbourne. In the following years Gilmour made occasional stage appearances and appeared briefly in films and on television, but devoted much of her time to being a wife and mother. She continued to be interested in dance and thanks to her phenomenal memory was able to help reconstruct ballets, including <span class="italic">Peter and the Wolf</span>, and to restore others&#151;most notably <span class="italic">Dark Elegies</span>, in which she had on occasions danced all the female solo roles&#151;to their original form. In 1970 Gilmour and her family returned to London, where her husband died in 1987. In her later years Gilmour suffered from Alzheimer's disease and in 1996 she went back to Australia. She died on 23 May 2004 in Sydney, and was survived by her three children.<br>
