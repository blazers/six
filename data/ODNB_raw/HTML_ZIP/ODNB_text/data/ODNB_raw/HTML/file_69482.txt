<span class="headword">Maybee,  Robert</span>  (1810&#150;1891), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 1 April 1810 in his parents' cottage, Windmill Cottage, near the windmill on Peninnis Head, St Mary's, in the Isles of Scilly, the fifth of ten children of William Maybee, who moved to Scilly from the Isle of Wight to take up employment as a mill worker, probably in 1798, and his wife, Florence, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mumford, a local girl whom he had married on 26 December 1798. The windmill closed in 1826 and William Maybee died in 1834, but Florence continued to live in the cottage together with some of her children, including Robert. During this time she compiled a list of their dates of birth and of the dates of death for four of her children who had predeceased her, and from this it appears that she may have had some ability in reading and writing; if so, she failed to pass on this accomplishment to her son Robert, who remained illiterate. Florence Maybee died in 1852, and after forty-two years' residence Robert was obliged to move out of the cottage into lodgings in Hugh Town. It was about this period that he began to compose his verses.<br>
<br>For all his life Maybee was poor and scraped a living from various jobs. For much of the time he was a hawker, making trips on the packet boat to Penzance to take back fruit to sell in Scilly. A verse from one of his early compositions reads:<blockquote>
<div>It was many a long summer day<br>
</div>
<div>I hawked them round the town<br>
</div>
<div>And had to work till ten at night<br>
</div>
<div>To earn one half a crown.<br>
</div> (Baxter, 37)</blockquote>The income he received from such trading he supplemented by reciting or singing his verses to customers. He relied on memory, but later sold his verses in printed form or at least exchanged them for a meal. He depended upon finding people to write down his words for him, one of whom was the kindly Dr Moyle, and this opens the possibility that his amanuenses may have assisted in matters such as syntax and punctuation.<br>
<br>In the winter months between about 1855 and 1860 Maybee worked on a farm on St Agnes; in the summer months he helped in the construction of the Bishop Rock lighthouse. In 1883, while working on Tresco, he composed an account of his life, which gave a picture of many happenings in Scilly in his lifetime and is also the main source of biographical information about him. His account was always graphic, as for instance when he described kelp-making, an important early nineteenth-century industry in Scilly, and he was always interesting, even if some of his historical detail is now discounted. He entitled the account <span class="italic">Sixty-Eight Years Experience on the Scilly Islands</span>, and in it he claimed to have composed about sixty poems, but only about nineteen were written down and are still available, the earliest being from 1871. He certainly composed some before this, because he appeared before the local magistrates in 1857 charged with selling his ballads about the streets without a licence.<br>
<br>Maybee's writings reveal his native charm but his verses seem childlike, and in this there may be a parallel with Alfred Wallis, the St Ives painter &#145;discovered&#146; by Ben Nicholson in 1928. Both started their work late in life, untutored and lacking learning and sophistication. Wallis is termed a &#145;primitive&#146; painter, and Maybee could be called a &#145;primitive&#146; poet. Not for him flights of fancy or erudite allusions; instead, his verses were simple and unmannered, telling a tale (often of shipwreck) in words short, familiar, and commonplace. Some Scillonian children learned them by heart and could recite them at will. Even at the end of the twentieth century, when in the company of older Scillonians one had only to utter the first line:<blockquote>
<div>Dark on the Gilstone's rocky shore<br>
</div>
</blockquote>for others to complete the verse thus:<blockquote>
<div>The mist came lowering down<br>
</div>
<div>And night with all her deepening gloom<br>
</div>
<div>Put on her sable crown.<br>
</div> (Baxter, 24)</blockquote>A description of Maybee at the age of about seventy-five referred to him as &#145;a pathetic little man with a kind face, yellowish curls, and red-rimmed eyes&#146;  (Baxter, introduction). He spent his last five years in the local poorhouse, dying there, unmarried, in 1891. Today Maybee is remembered not only in the Scillies but also in the USA, where the Maybee Society is devoted to researching the whole Maybee family.<br>
