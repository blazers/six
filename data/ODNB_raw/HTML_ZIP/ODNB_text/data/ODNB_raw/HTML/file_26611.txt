<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stow <span class="st"> [Stowe]</span>,  John</span>  (1524/5&#150;1605), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born in the parish of St Michael Cornhill, London, the eldest of the seven children of Thomas Stow (<i>d</i>. 1559), tallow-chandler, and his wife, Elizabeth Archer (<i>d</i>. 1568?). John Strype described the Stows as a family of &#145;good substance and credit&#146;  (Strype, <span class="italic">Survey</span>, 1.i&#150;iv) drawn from the ranks of the solid citizenry of the city. His grandfather, also named Thomas and a tallow-chandler, died in 1527 leaving household goods worth &pound;20 and plate valued at over &pound;6.<h2>
<a name="Familyandeducation"></a>Family and education</h2>Stow (who also spelt his own name Stowe) had three brothers, Thomas, William (<i>b</i>. 1547), and John the younger, as well as three sisters, Joan (Rolfe or Frowyke), Margaret, and Alice (Farmer). Family life was marred by a protracted feud with his brother Thomas over their inheritance, a conflict that involved not only the two brothers but also their mother and Thomas's wife. Thomas claimed a larger share of his mother's estate because he provided her with care during her last years. John's argument was based on his status as the eldest son and his brother's manipulation and intimidation of their mother. Elizabeth Stow's will was proved on 13 October 1568, and it appears that John never received what he regarded as his fair share of her estate. Frequent references to this unhappy quarrel in Stow's chronicles suggest that he never forgave his brother and bore a grudge against him for many years.<br>
<br>Stow married his wife, Elizabeth (her surname is unknown), after 1549. Following his marriage he lived near the well in Aldgate, between Leadenhall Street and Fenchurch Street; later he resided in Lime Street ward where he remained until his death. By about 1569 he had three marriageable daughters, of whom two, Joan and Julyan (<i>d</i>. 1611), survived him.<br>
<br>Although intimately associated with London throughout his long life, Stow cannot be connected with any city school; neither did he study at a university or the inns of court. Nevertheless, he wrote English with fluency and clarity, had a good command of Latin, and possessed an extraordinary knowledge of English history and literature. His education was acquired perhaps at a school without an established reputation or through self-study. He always held formal education in high esteem and spoke with respect when writing of those who enjoyed its benefits. Although he remained outside the circle of university-educated Renaissance humanist scholars, he became acquainted with many such, including John Dee, William Camden, Archbishop Matthew Parker of Canterbury, and Henry Savile. When he joined the Society of Antiquaries some time after its foundation in 1586, he was the only member who was not a gentleman.<h2>
<a name="Religion"></a>Religion</h2>Stow conformed to the Church of England as established during the reign of Elizabeth despite unsubstantiated accusations of Roman Catholic sympathies that derived from his collection of books and manuscripts. Early in 1569 he was examined by the lord mayor for illegally copying and circulating a manifesto against Elizabeth which had been published by the Spanish ambassador on behalf of the duke of Alva, the governor of the Netherlands. Stow admitted that he had been lent two copies of the document and had made a copy for himself. He also read it to some neighbours but denied making other copies of it. The mayor took no further action, but Edmund Grindal, bishop of London, ordered that Stow's house be searched for illegal books. On 24 February Grindal wrote to Sir William Cecil enclosing a list of thirty-nine objectionable titles including <span class="italic">An Exposition of the Creed, Ten Commandments, Pater noster, Ave Maria, &amp;c.</span> by Edmund Bonner, <span class="italic">A Great Old Book, Containing the Manner of the List of Saints</span>, <span class="italic">A Plain and Godly Treatise Concerning the Mass and Blessed Sacrament of the Altar</span>, as well as numerous historical works  (Strype, <span class="italic">Grindal</span>, 516&#150;19). The possession of these works led Grindal to the conclusion that Stow was a great favourer of Catholicism.<br>
<br>Although the privy council did not respond to Grindal's charges, this episode has been used to support allegations of Catholicism. Stow's known behaviour lends no support to the charges. Neither his manuscript nor published writings point to either Roman Catholic sympathies or a serious interest in the theological or liturgical aspects of the Reformation. Rather he identified himself with the Elizabethan protestant establishment, not least through his association with some of its leading figures, men such as Archbishop Parker, John Whitgift (to whom as archbishop he dedicated his <span class="italic">Annales</span>), and Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester. Throughout his long life Stow detached himself from religious controversy and had a generally tolerant attitude for the age in which he lived. He recorded the execution of Elizabethan Catholic martyrs with compassion but was also well informed about Elizabethan religious radicals including familists, separatists, and Arians. His strongest prejudices were not religious but were directed against the Irish, whom he portrayed as an obstacle to English domination of the British Isles.<h2>
<a name="Earningaliving"></a>Earning a living</h2>Stow was admitted to the freedom of the Merchant Taylors' Company in 1547 but remained for nearly thirty years a member of the subordinate Bachelors' or Yeoman Company, and was never admitted to the livery or to any important office. In the 1570s he produced documents that were needed to resolve a dispute over ward boundaries, and in 1584&#150;5 he was apparently employed as a surveyor of ale houses. In the latter year he was also appointed one of two collectors of the assessment in Lime Street ward for a muster of 4000 men. Towards the end of his life Stow devoted the bulk of his time to collecting historical records and to writing. Although his patrons included Leicester, archbishops Parker and Whitgift, and several mayors of London, Stow complained latterly of lack of money, a complaint endorsed by a number of contemporaries. Edmund Howes wrote that Stow never rode but travelled on foot as he visited old buildings and searched for historical records, while Ben Jonson remarked that when he and Stow were walking together, they met two lame beggars whom Stow asked whether they would take him into their order.<br>
<br>From 1579 the Merchant Taylors' Company provided Stow with a pension of &pound;4 per annum, and in 1590 he petitioned the aldermen of London for admission to the freedom of the city in order to reduce his expenses. Letters patent issued in 1604 authorized him to collect voluntary contributions and gratuities. His financial problems resulted from his difficulties in earning an adequate living from book sales and from his failure to attract a sufficiently generous patron. None the less Stow's will, which he signed on 30 August 1603, included bequests of &pound;10 apiece to his daughters, Julyan Towers and Joan Foster; the rest of his &#145;goodes, household stuf, and appareyle&#146;, as well as the lease of his house with &#145;the Residue of the yeares to come&#146;, was left to his wife  (Stow, ed. Kingsford, 1.xlv). That Stow was not rich is beyond question, but his pleas of poverty were exaggerated.<h2>
<a name="Deathandimages"></a>Death and images</h2>Stow died in London aged eighty on 5 April 1605 and was buried in the parish church of St Andrew Undershaft. In his memory Stow's wife erected near the grave a mural monument of Derbyshire marble and alabaster; still extant, it represents him writing in a book on a desk with other books about him. Above it is the motto <i>Aut scribenda agere, aut legenda scribere</i> (&#145;Either to perform deeds to be written about, or to write things to be read&#146;). The inscription, which is in good Renaissance Latin&#151;appropriate to the self-taught scholar who published so many of his writings in that tongue&#151;provides a succinct and stylish r&eacute;sum&eacute; of Stow's achievements as a historian:<blockquote>[Memoriae Sacrum] Resurrectionem in Christo pie expectat Joannes Stowe, civis Londiniensis. Qui in antiquis monumentis eruendis, accuratissima diligentia usus Angliae Annales, &amp; civitatis Londini Synopsin bene de sua, bene de postera aetate meritus, luculenter scripsit: Vitaeque stadio pie decurso, obit Aetatis anno 80, die 5 Aprilis 1605. Elizabetha coniux ut perpetuum sui amoris testimonium dolens. (&#145;Sacred to the memory. John Stow, London citizen, piously awaits resurrection in Christ. Who having employed most careful diligence in bringing to light records of antiquity, deserved well both of his own time and of posterity in writing with distinction the annals of England and the survey of the city of London. Having devoutly run the course of his life, he died in his eightieth year, on 5 April 1605. His wife Elizabeth [erected this monument] lamenting as perpetual witness of her love.&#146;)</blockquote>An engraving depicting Stow as an elderly man of seventy-seven was prepared for the 1603 edition of <span class="italic">A Survey of London</span>, but most surviving copies lack the portrait. The engraving was later reproduced in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1, 1837, 48) as well as in other modern works. John Manningham recalled a conversation with Stow in 1602 in which he mentioned this picture:<blockquote>I was with Stowe the Antiquary. He told me that a model of his picture was found in the Recorder Fleetwood's study, with this inscription: <i>Johannes Stowe</i><i>, Antiquarius</i> <i>Angliae</i>, which is now cut in brass and prefixed in print to his <span class="italic">Survey of London</span>. He sayeth of it as Pilate sayeth, &#145;What I have written I have written.&#146; and thinks himself worthy of that title for his pains, for hath no gains by his travail. (<span class="italic">Diary of John Manningham</span>, 154&#150;5)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Collectorandrecordsearcher"></a>Collector and record searcher</h2>Stow was a prolific manuscript collector whose interests included chronicles, charters, ecclesiastical and municipal records, wills, literary works, and learned treatises. The Harley collection at the British Library contains the largest group of his manuscripts, but many items are incompletely or inaccurately catalogued. Other manuscripts are included in the collections of the Bodleian Library at Oxford, Lambeth Palace Library, the Folger Shakespeare Library, and elsewhere. It is likely that Stow was the most knowledgeable record collector of the sixteenth century. In 1562 he acquired a manuscript of &#145;The Tree of Commonwealth&#146; by Edmund Dudley and presented a copy to the author's grandson, the earl of Leicester, who encouraged Stow to pursue historical research. Medieval works of which he possessed manuscripts include the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> of Matthew Paris, the <span class="italic">Gesta regum</span> of William of Malmesbury, and Gerald of Wales's <span class="italic">Itinerary through Wales</span>. He copied the long English version of the <span class="italic">Historie of the Arrivall of Edward IV in England</span> (the work that constituted the first volume of the Camden Society's publications in 1838), and thereby preserved it for posterity. Among sixteenth-century manuscripts preserved by Stow are William Lambarde's <span class="italic">Perambulation of Kent</span>, which influenced <span class="italic">A Survey of London</span>, and a narrative describing the murder of Thomas Arden of Faversham, Kent, in 1551. Stow was also an avid collector of printed books, but a complete inventory has not survived. After his death the collection was dispersed.<br>
<br>C. L. Kingsford stressed Stow's importance as an indefatigable searcher of historical records who offered &#145;something of a new departure in the art of historical inquiry&#146;, and argued that Stow was &#145;the first English historian to make systematic use of public records for the purpose of his work&#146;  (Kingsford, 266&#150;7). His writings reveal an extensive knowledge of close rolls, patent rolls, and inquisitions post mortem, along with charters, records of the city of London, and judicial sources. He was apparently the only English authority to record the attempted rescue of the sons of Edward IV from the Tower of London in 1483, in an account whose phrasing (in the <span class="italic">Annales of England</span>) suggests that he had seen official indictments that no longer exist. Kingsford concluded with justice that through the use of public records Stow did more to advance the study of fifteenth-century England than any other writer of his time.<h2>
<a name="Literaryandhistoricalpublications"></a>Literary and historical publications</h2>Stow's first publication, <span class="italic">The workes of Geffrey Chaucer, newly printed, with divers addicions whiche were never in printe before</span>, appeared in 1561. Appended to this edition was John Lydgate's &#145;Siege of Thebes&#146;. Earlier Stow worked on William Thynne's Chaucer edition of 1532 and in his own work corrected and enlarged it along lines severely criticized by later authorities. Later he supplied his notes to Thomas Speght who incorporated them in his edition of 1598. Stow edited a collection of thirty-three works of John Skelton, <span class="italic">Pithy Pleasaunt and Profitable Workes of Maister Skelton</span>, which was printed by Thomas Marshe in 1568. Stow pursued literary interests until late in life when he published <span class="italic">Certaine worthy manuscript poems of great antiquity preserved long in the studie of a Northfolke gentleman</span> (1597). The book was dedicated to Edmund Spenser and included the &#145;Statelie Tragedy of Guistard and Sismond&#146;, &#145;The Northern Mother's Blessing&#146;, and &#145;The Way to Thrift&#146;.<br>
<br>The most prolific historical writer of the sixteenth century, during his lifetime Stow produced a total of twenty-one editions and issues of chronicles together with his <span class="italic">Survey of London</span>. His longer chronicles&#151;the <span class="italic">Chronicles of England</span> (1580) and the <span class="italic">Annales of England</span>, first published in 1592, which were printed in quarto&#151;provide detailed accounts of English history from the earliest times which are continued down to the accession of James I in Stow's own last edition. His smaller summaries and abridgements offered a cheaper, simplified guide to the English past. His first chronicle, the <span class="italic">Summarie of Englyshe Chronicles</span>, was published in 1565 and subsequently extended and enlarged. For the period before 1547 Stow depended primarily on earlier writers, but for the later period he was writing about his own times. His accounts of the reigns of Edward VI, Mary, and Elizabeth were based on his own records, on those provided by his friends and correspondents, and on his own personal experience. Over the years he not only extended but made significant revisions to the chronicles with the result that his assessment of a particular individual or event cannot be determined without consulting and comparing different editions.<br>
<br>Stow's commitment to historical accuracy led him into a protracted controversy with Richard Grafton, who in 1563 published a chronicle based on the work of Thomas Lanquet to compete with earlier editions produced by Robert Crowley and Thomas Cooper. Controversy between Crowley and Cooper created an opportunity for Stow to publish the first edition of his own <span class="italic">Summarie</span> in 1565, a venture that led to a conflict with Grafton that ended only with the latter's death in 1573. To secure his place in the market for chronicles Stow had to overcome Grafton's standing with the protestant establishment in London. This he did with passion as he denounced Grafton as a plagiarist who was incapable of making accurate copies of the works from which he borrowed. Grafton replied in kind, creating a learned conflict that generated more heat than light. He criticized Stow's work as the &#145;memories of superstitious foundations, fables, and lies foolishly stowed together&#146;, while Stow retorted that Grafton's chronicles contained &#145;the thunderous noise of empty tonnes and unfruitful grafts&#146;  (Devereux, 33). Grafton's scholarship presented an easy target, but Stow exaggerated his adversary's failings and projected an unappealing image of his own self-righteousness and complete commitment to the truth.<h2>
<a name="TheSurveyofLondon"></a>The Survey of London</h2>Stow's most famous work, <span class="italic">A Survey of London</span>, first published in 1598, appeared in an expanded second edition in 1603, and has remained continuously in print. Over the centuries it has been widely praised and cited in countless works. In his invaluable edition, C. L. Kingsford describes <span class="italic">A Survey</span> as &#145;the book of a life; on it the author's peculiar title to fame now rests&#146;  (Stow, ed. Kingsford, 1.xxviii). The book is a topographical survey of the city and its suburbs developed along the lines of earlier works by John Leland, William Lambarde, and William Camden. In its composition Stow drew on a wide range of classical and medieval historical literature, public and civic records, as well as upon his own intimate personal knowledge of the city where he spent his life. The reader of <span class="italic">A Survey</span> travels with Stow through each of the city's wards and the adjoining city of Westminster, learns about the wall, bridges, gates, and parish churches of London, and peruses lists of mayors and sheriffs. May McKisack notes that the &#145;material is under control, subordinated to the demands of the author's plan, and allowing full scope for the exercise of his skill and the display of his qualities as historian&#146;  (McKisack, 132).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">A Survey of London</span> reveals dramatically the pageantry of the sixteenth-century city. Thus Stow gives details of an elaborate feast for serjeants-at-law at Ely Place in 1531 that lasted five days. Attended by the king and queen and foreign ambassadors, the celebration offered an abundance of food that rivalled a coronation feast. Stow also notes the great buildings of London that symbolize its substantial wealth. For him the most beautiful houses in the city, or even in England, are in Goldsmiths' Row, where &#145;ten fair dwelling-houses and fourteen shops, all in one frame uniformly built four stories high, beautified toward the street with the Goldsmiths' arms &hellip; cast in lead, richly painted over and gilt&#146;  (Stow, ed. Kingsford, 1.345). But he also records the negative aspects of urban growth, in the shape of unsightly sprawl, filth, the destruction of ancient monuments, and above all poverty. His book approaches the thoroughness of an encyclopaedia, but there are also striking omissions, with nothing, for instance, to suggest that the author took an interest in the theatre, or in the plays of Shakespeare. In compiling <span class="italic">A Survey</span>, Stow recognized a sense of patriotic duty to what he called his &#145;native mother and Countrey&#146;  (Stow, ed. Kingsford, 1.xcviii). It is noteworthy that while Camden's <span class="italic">Britannia</span> was written in Latin for the educated &eacute;lite, Stow's <span class="italic">Survey</span> was composed in the language of his fellow countrymen.<br>
<br>Stow made significant contributions to the famous second edition of Holinshed's <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> published in 1587. He regularly laid claim to this work, in the <span class="italic">Annales of England</span> calling it his larger chronicle, and incorporated many of his manuscript notes into it, but Abraham Fleming is now regarded as the actual compiler. About 1590 Stow also began referring to larger works that he was writing. One, described as an account &#145;not only of this famous city of London, but also of this whole island, princes of the same, and the accidents of their times&#146;, was nearly completed when he died but was never published. Stow complained that London printers wanted only shorter histories and would not accept his book. A second work, referred to as a book of foundations, was probably never completed, but parts of it may have been incorporated into William Dugdale's <span class="italic">Monasticon Anglicanum</span>.<h2>
<a name="Influenceandsignificance"></a>Influence and significance</h2>Stow's influence extended well into the seventeenth century as a result of reprints and enlargements of his work. Edmund Howes published expanded editions of the chronicles in 1607, 1611, 1615, 1618, and 1631, while Anthony Munday with the personal encouragement of Stow and some of his &#145;best collections&#146; corrected and extended <span class="italic">A Survey of London</span> in 1618 and 1633  (Stow, ed. Munday, &#145;Epistle dedicatorie&#146;). The most important later editions of the latter are John Strype's folio edition published in 1720 and C. L. Kingsford's comprehensively annotated edition of 1908. A serviceable edition of the <span class="italic">Survey</span> by H. B. Wheatley was published in <span class="roman">Everyman's Library</span> in 1912.<br>
<br>Stow is traditionally viewed&#151;often with more than a hint of condescension&#151;as an earnest, hard-working antiquarian, who produced highly accurate but old-fashioned works that were superseded by the humanistic scholarship of university-educated intellectuals. <span class="italic">A Survey of London</span> is usually acknowledged to be his most enduring work because it offers a classic descriptive account of the capital during the Tudor period. The chronicles came to be regarded as less significant than the second edition of Holinshed because of the latter's connection with Shakespeare's history plays. In reality Stow was the most productive historical writer of the sixteenth century. His chronicles were more widely read than those of any other historian of his era and, unlike Holinshed, covered the whole sixteenth century. As an eyewitness to events from the death of Henry VIII to the accession of James I he provides important insights into the political and cultural life of his age from the perspective of a London citizen who never styled himself as a gentleman.<br>
