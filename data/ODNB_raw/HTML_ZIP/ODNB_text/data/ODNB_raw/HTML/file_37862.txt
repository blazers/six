<span class="headword">Preston,  Thomas</span>  (1860&#150;1900), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, was born on 23 May 1860 in Ballyhagan, Kilmore, co. Armagh, Ireland, the youngest of three sons, the eldest of whom died young, of Abraham Dawson Preston, a gentleman farmer of Mulladry, Kilmore, and his wife, Anne, daughter of John Hall, quartermaster, and widow of John Ritchie, from which marriage she had a daughter. He was educated at the Royal School, Armagh, and graduated from the Royal University of Ireland in 1884 and from Trinity College, Dublin, in 1885. In Dublin he studied under G. F. Fitzgerald, the mathematical natural philosopher.<br>
<br>In 1886 Preston published <span class="italic">A Treatise in Spherical Trigonometry</span> with his cousin W. J. McClelland, which ran to several editions. In 1890 he published the first of his two major textbooks, <span class="italic">Theory of Light</span>, followed by <span class="italic">Theory of Heat</span> in 1894. These, with many subsequent editions, became standard textbooks for undergraduates until the Second World War. In 1891 he became professor of natural philosophy at University College, Dublin, a position he held until his death, and he was later appointed a fellow of the Royal University of Ireland. In addition to this he held a government post as inspector of science and arts for Irish schools from 1894. In 1895 he married Katherine Mary [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48676/', "Preston, Katherine Mary")</script>], daughter of Thomas McEwen, dominie of Baldernock School. They had one daughter and two sons, one of whom died in infancy; the other, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51930/', "George Dawson Preston")</script>, became a notable physicist. His widow became a pioneer of education for women in Ireland as principal of Alexandra College, Dublin.<br>
<br>Preston's fame rests on his discovery of the anomalous Zeeman effect, which he first reported in a paper presented to the Royal Dublin Society in December 1897. His discovery led to contacts with leading physicists who were investigating the recently discovered Zeeman effect (the way in which atomic spectra are influenced by magnetism), including Joseph John Thomson, William Thomson, Heinrich Hertz, and Albert Michelson. Michelson, using expensive apparatus in Chicago, attempted to disprove the empirical rule discovered by Preston, but Preston publicly disproved him. The Zeeman effect was anomalous whenever it departed from the form predicted by classical theory. Preston's rule helped the Zeeman effect become an important tool in spectrum analysis, and opened up the possibility of quantum physics.<br>
<br>Preston also engaged George Johnstone Stoney, vice-president of the Royal Society and the man responsible for coining the term &#145;electron&#146;, in a public dispute in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span> over a mathematical conclusion, in which the president, J. W. Strutt, intervened on Preston's behalf. Elected FRS in 1898 Preston was also made an honorary DSc by the Royal University of Ireland and awarded the Boyle medal of the Royal Dublin Society. He died at his home, Bardowie, Orwell Park, Rathgar, Dublin, on 7 March 1900.<br>
