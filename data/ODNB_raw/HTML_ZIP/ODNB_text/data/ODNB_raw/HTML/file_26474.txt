<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stewart, Sir  Herbert</span>  (1843&#150;1885), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 30 January 1843 in Sparsholt, Hampshire, the eldest son of the Revd Edward Stewart, rector of Sparsholt, and a grandson of the seventh earl of Galloway, and Louisa Herbert of Muckross, co. Kerry. Educated at Brighton College in 1854, and then at Winchester College from 1854 to 1862, where he was captain of the eleven, Stewart was commissioned as an ensign by purchase in the 37th foot on 24 November 1863. He purchased his lieutenancy on 18 July 1865 and was adjutant from 17 July 1866 to 11 April 1868, when he purchased his captaincy. The regiment was then serving in Bengal and Stewart acted as aide-de-camp to Major-General Beatson, commanding the Allahabad division, from 15 August 1868 to 28 November 1870. Stewart also acted as deputy assistant quartermaster-general in Bengal from 27 January 1872 to 18 October 1873, having come to the attention of the commander-in-chief, Lord Napier, through his initiative, during Beatson's absence, in dispersing troops to camps during a cholera outbreak.<br>
<br>Stewart returned to England in 1873, having exchanged into the 3rd dragoon guards on 18 October. He apparently became keener on his profession and entered the Staff College in 1877. His enrolment at the Inner Temple in April 1877 was also apparently intended to better qualify him for staff employment, but he was also interested in engineering and architecture. On 19 December 1877 he married Georgiana Janet Tombs, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26532/', "Admiral Sir James Stirling")</script> and widow of Major-General Sir H. Tombs. He did not complete the Staff College course as he secured appointment as a special service officer for the Zululand campaign in late 1878. The campaign was to launch him on a meteoric rise from captain to major-general in just six years, but initially he experienced considerable frustration. Appointed brigade major to the cavalry brigade on 26 February 1879, Stewart found himself restricted to patrolling lines of communication. He contemplated resignation, but his situation was transformed by the arrival of Sir Garnet Wolseley to supersede Lord Chelmsford. It has been suggested both that Wolseley learned of Stewart through his chief of staff, George Colley, who may have heard of Stewart in India, and also that Wolseley fortuitously met Stewart while the latter was on line of communications duty near Rorke's Drift. Either way, Wolseley immediately recognized Stewart's potential and added him to his staff, attaching him to the column under Lieutenant-Colonel C. M. Clarke.<br>
<br>Wolseley was later to describe Stewart as &#145;one of the very best staff officers all round I have ever known in the Army&#146;, but it was also Stewart's personal qualities which Wolseley appreciated, for he &#145;never makes difficulties, is always ready for any undertaking, is a highly educated soldier and one of the pleasantest men to be associated with I have ever met&#146;  (Wolseley to prince of Wales, 28 Dec 1884, Royal Archives, T8/160). Wolseley remarked on Stewart's cheerfulness and willingness to take on any undertaking however unpleasant, and clearly his charm and tact also greatly appealed. None the less, Stewart was tempted to resign when he was not included in the gazette for Zululand, until persuaded by Wolseley's military secretary, Henry Brackenbury, to query its accuracy: Stewart had been granted a brevet majority on 28 October 1879. He then served as principal staff officer to Baker Russell during the operations against Sekukuni before preparing to go home. However, after Brackenbury was appointed private secretary to the viceroy, Stewart served as Wolseley's military secretary from 7 February to 25 May 1880. He was Wolseley's only remaining staff officer and, effectively, his chief of staff. For his services against Sekukuni he was made brevet lieutenant-colonel on 24 July 1880.<br>
<br>Wolseley had resolved that he would employ Stewart again on campaign, but his next appointment was to go back to South Africa as assistant adjutant and quartermaster-general on 7 January 1881, where hostilities had broken out with the Boers. Colley's chief of staff had been killed at Laing's Nek on 28 January and Stewart was ordered up to replace him, arriving at Mount Prospect about 20 February. Stewart was party to Colley's decision to seize Majuba Hill on the night of 26&#150;27 February, and was equally complacent in believing that the Boers could not successfully assault the position. He accompanied Colley on Majuba, and at the final Boer assault was knocked over in the rush and fell down the side of the hill; he then spent some thirty hours trying unsuccessfully to evade capture. He was released with the other prisoners at the end of March. He attributed the failure to entrench on Majuba to the tiredness of the men and, controversially, the British rout to panic by the troops.<br>
<br>Promoted major in his regiment on 1 July 1881, Stewart was appointed aide-de-camp to Lord Spencer, lord lieutenant of Ireland, on 9 May 1882, but left Dublin in August to join Wolseley's expedition to Egypt. <i>En route</i> for Egypt, an ailing Wolseley found Stewart an agreeable companion and used him as amanuensis in dictating his orders for the campaign. Initially Stewart was brigade major to the 1st cavalry brigade, then assistant adjutant-general of the cavalry division. He played a key role in pushing the cavalry on to Cairo after Wolseley's victory at Tell al-Kebir on 13 September and, backed by only fifty men, personally demanded and received the surrender of the city. For his services Stewart was made a brevet colonel, a CB, and aide-de-camp to the queen on 18 November 1882. He resumed his appointment in Ireland and remained there until 17 January 1884, when selected to command the cavalry brigade in the force being sent to Suakin under Sir Gerald Graham, which appointment he held from 12 February to 17 April. If the bluff to seize Cairo indicated Stewart's courage and enterprise, he was apparently rash at al-Teb on 29 February 1884, when he misread the situation and ordered his brigade to charge large bodies of fresh enemy he assumed were defeated and retreating. His brigade suffered heavy casualties. Later he urged Graham to push forward to Berber, but the government thought the risk too great and the Suakin force was withdrawn. He was created KCB on 21 May 1884.<br>
<br>Stewart became assistant adjutant and quartermaster-general in south-east district on 18 April 1884 but on 1 September returned to Egypt for the Gordon relief expedition. Stewart went to Dongola to organize the camel corps and was appointed brigadier in command of the column intended to push across the desert to Methemmeh on 24 November, Wolseley having refused to accept anyone senior to Stewart for the task. With Colley's death, Stewart had become Wolseley's firm favourite, and jealousies were evident among other members of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69913/', "Wolseley ring")</script>, Redvers Buller in particular resenting Stewart's appointment as brigadier and constantly &#145;crabbing&#146; Stewart's reputation.<br>
<br>The number of transport camels was insufficient for the stores thought necessary to take the desert column to Methemmeh, and Stewart set out from Korti on 29 December 1884 to establish an intermediate depot at Gakdul Wells. Gakdul was reached on 2 January and the process was then repeated at the cost of exhausting many of the camels. On 14 January Stewart finally advanced on Methemmeh from Gakdul with some 1800 men and 2888 camels, intending to establish a garrison at Methemmeh, from which a small detachment would be embarked on steamers for Khartoum. On 16 January the Mahdists were found to be in force near Abu Klea. On the following day, Stewart advanced on them in square. It was due to the undulating ground that the enemy was able to make a sudden charge on the left and rear faces of the square, which had become disrupted through camels lagging. The square was briefly broken and heavy casualties were suffered before the Mahdists were driven out, the dead including Stewart's designated second in command, Fred Burnaby. Stewart himself had had his horse killed under him.<br>
<br>The march to Methemmeh was resumed late on 18 January and Stewart hoped to reach the Nile before daybreak. However, difficult terrain, the darkness of the night, and the exhaustion of men and camels left the column still some miles from the river. Stewart formed a defensive zereba for the baggage since it was clear that the Mahdists would strongly oppose any further advance, and they had already opened fire on the column. Some time between 9 a.m. and 10.15 a.m. on 19 January, Stewart was hit in the groin and compelled to hand over command to the expedition's intelligence officer, Sir Charles Wilson. Irrespective of whether the appearance of a few British troops on the river could have saved Gordon, all impetus was lost without Stewart's drive, and it was only on 24 January that Wilson finally embarked for Khartoum. The city fell on 26 January, two days before Wilson's steamers came in sight of it.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, there were some hopes that Stewart might recover as he was taken painfully back towards Korti. However, he himself recognized from the beginning that the wound was mortal, penning a last touching letter to Wolseley asking him to care for his wife and son and referring to his own fate as &#145;Bad luck but glorious&#146;  (Stewart to Wolseley, 19 Jan 1885, Wolseley MSS). News of his promotion to major-general, for which Wolseley had pressed, had been received on 29 January and Stewart knew of this before he died near Gakdul Wells&#151;where he was also buried&#151;on 16 February 1885. Stewart was not quite as brilliant a field commander as Wolseley supposed, but his loss finally doomed the expedition to failure. Wolseley was concerned greatly that Stewart, like Colley, had not been a believer in &#145;revealed religion&#146; and that Stewart's wife, whose pension he made strenuous efforts to arrange, had been twice widowed. It was also his belief, as he later remarked, that &#145;the sun of my luck set when Stewart was wounded&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Royal United Service Institution</span>, April 1913, 446), and Wolseley bitterly described Stewart's death as &#145;another holocaust on the altar of Mr. Gladstone's self-opinionated ignorance&#146;  (entry for 19 Feb 1885, TNA: PRO, WO 147/8).<br>
