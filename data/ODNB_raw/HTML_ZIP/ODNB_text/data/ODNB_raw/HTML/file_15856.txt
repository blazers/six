<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lacy,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1615&#150;1681), <span class="occ">playwright and actor</span>, born in the vicinity of Doncaster, Yorkshire, went in 1631 to London where he was apprenticed to the dancing-master John Ogilby, who ran a school in Gray's Inn Lane. Later renowned for dialect-based performances, Lacy is said (by John Aubrey in his <span class="italic">Letters Written by Eminent Persons</span>, 1813) to have furnished Ben Jonson with northern dialect terms and proverbs for his 1630s drama (critical opinion varies as to whether this was for <span class="italic">A Tale of a Tub</span>, <i>c</i>.1633, or <span class="italic">The Sad Shepherd</span>, 1637, although the north midlands setting of the latter makes that the more likely choice). Aubrey quotes Lacy on Jonson elsewhere in his manuscripts. In 1639 Lacy is recorded as acting in the company of the Cockpit Theatre. A wife, Margaret, is referred to by certain contemporaries but little more is known of her personal life. Elias Ashmole's diary refers to the baptism of Lacy's second son on 17 March 1665.<br>
<br>During the English civil wars Lacy served as a lieutenant and quartermaster under Colonel Charles Gerard, later the earl of Macclesfield. At the Restoration he was a founder member of Thomas Killigrew's King's Company at the Theatre Royal and rose to become one of that company's star performers. Like other early Restoration actors, he appears to have played some female parts, despite the advent of professional women performers, taking the lead in <span class="italic">The French Dancing Mistress</span> in 1662. Among other roles, he played Scruple the nonconformist in John Wilson's comedy <span class="italic">The Cheats</span> in 1662 and Teague in Sir Robert Howard's <span class="italic">The Committee</span> in 1663. Samuel Pepys witnessed the latter performance, remarking that it was &#145;a merry but an indifferent play&#146; but that Lacy's performance as an Irish footman was &#145;beyond imagination&#146;  (Pepys, 4.181, 12 June 1663). On seeing Lacy in the part on a subsequent occasion, Pepys observed that his role was &#145;so well performed that it would set off anything&#146;  (ibid., 8.384, 13 Aug 1667). John Evelyn also saw Lacy perform this role, praising it in his diary. It has been argued that Lacy's performances in these two roles along with that of Monsieur Galliard (the dance reference was highly apposite) in <span class="italic">The Variety</span> by William Cavendish, duke of Newcastle, are enshrined in a triple portrait of him by John Michael Wright which hung in Windsor Castle until the early nineteenth century. Other scholars have disputed this attribution, however, and argued that the roles represented are those of Galliard, Wareston from John Tatham's <span class="italic">The Rump</span>, and Ananias from Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">The Alchemist</span>, parts Lacy can be assumed to have played in the first two years of the Restoration prior to this painting's execution about 1662 (it is datable from a reference in Evelyn, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 3.338&#150;9; Cooper, 759). A later copy of this painting is owned by the Garrick Club.<br>
<br>In addition to playing in new dramas, Lacy made a name for himself in several revivals of pre-civil war play texts, including James Shirley's <span class="italic">The Changes, or, Love in a Maze</span>&#151;of which Pepys remarked &#145;The play is pretty good, but the life of the play is Lacy's part, the Clowne&#146;  (Pepys, 4.179, 10 June 1663)&#151;and several plays by Jonson: between 1664 and 1665, as well as Ananias, he played Captain Otter in <span class="italic">Epicoene, or, The Silent Woman</span> and Sir Politic Would-Be in <span class="italic">Volpone</span>.<br>
<br>About this time Lacy began to write his own plays, some of which were adaptations of existent texts. <span class="italic">The Old Troop, or, Monsieur Raggou</span> made use of his own civil war experiences and influenced Sir Walter Scott's nineteenth-century novel <span class="italic">Woodstock</span>. Lacy is believed to have played the part of Raggou, a French servant, in the original 1664&#150;5 production. The play, which was not published until 1672, deals with the resentment felt in the English countryside (justified according to the play's representations) towards the cavalier soldiers who were billeted on villages between 1642 and 1649.<br>
<br>In 1666, as well as speaking the &#145;Epilogue&#146; in Sir Robert Howard's <span class="italic">The Vestal Virgin</span>, Lacy played Sir Roger in a revival of Beaumont and Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Scornful Lady</span>; he also wrote an adaptation of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">The Taming of the Shrew</span>, entitled <span class="italic">Sauny the Scot</span>. This was performed at the Theatre Royal in 1667. It has been suggested that Lacy played Petruchio in an earlier revival of Shakespeare's drama and this inspired his version. There is no firm evidence of this but <span class="italic">Sauny the Scot</span> in many respects stays close to its Shakespearian forebear until the final act. The influence of John Fletcher's own version, <span class="italic">The Woman's Prize, or, The Tamer Tamed</span> (<i>c</i>.1611), can also be registered. Nevertheless, Lacy's appropriation of the play for the Restoration is significant. He turns a largely verse drama into prose, and relocates Shakespeare's story from Renaissance Italy to contemporary London. Lucentio, the Paduan student of the original, becomes Winlove, an Oxford graduate, and an opposition between town and country is established in the play, recognizable from other Restoration comedies. Margaret is the equivalent of Katherina and it is perhaps indicative of the changing sexual and social mores of the Restoration period that her part is considerably expanded to allow for a more sustained rebellion against Petruchio in the final act. The title character, Sauny, is a Scottish version of Grumio, Petruchio's servant, and is most likely to have been played by Lacy, considering his propensity for dialect parts: Sauny makes comic matter of English niceties and is constantly &#145;Scratten and Scrubben&#146; himself  (<span class="smallcap">II</span>.i.25).<br>
<br>Another dialect part figures in Lacy's <span class="italic">Sir Hercules Buffoon, or, The Poetical Squire</span>, staged presumably in 1684. In this play, a Yorkshire heiress speaks in a dialect form redolent of Lacy's native Doncaster: &#145;Marra, the devilst learn French for me. By my saul, ean Yorkshire word, nuncle, s'worth ten thousand French eans&#146;  (<span class="smallcap">II</span>.ii). The title character is a country squire, the nephew of Alderman Buffoon. Anxious to see the players while he is in London, he falls prey, in the tradition of country gulls, to wiser city folk who make him an apprentice of their poetical society by forcing him through an initiation ceremony. Buffoon exhibits his lack of judgement by preferring John Taylor the Water Poet over Ben Jonson (whom Lacy imitates at various points elsewhere in the play).<br>
<br>In 1667 Lacy appeared in Edward Howard's controversial satire on the court of Charles II, entitled <span class="italic">The Change of Crowns</span> (which was never published). The king and queen went to see the production on 15 April 1667. By the time Samuel Pepys tried to see it again the next day the play text had already been altered. Lacy, according to Pepys, &#145;did act the Country Gentleman come up to Court, who doth abuse the Court with all the imaginable wit and plainness, about selling of places and doing everything for money&#146;  (Pepys, 8.167&#150;8, 15 April 1667). The king was said to have been so angered by the play that he detained Lacy in the porter's lodge. He was pardoned but the play remained under censure. The dramatist Howard (younger son of the earl of Berkshire and brother to playwright Sir Robert Howard) and his star performer are said to have quarrelled shortly after.<br>
<br>In 1667, despite serious illness, Lacy performed in a revival of <span class="italic">The Changes</span>. Subsequent parts included Bayes in the second duke of Buckingham's <span class="italic">The Rehearsal</span> in 1671 (a role based on Dryden), Drench in his own play <span class="italic">The Dumb Lady, or, The Farrier Made Physician</span> (1672), an adaptation (not much liked) of Moli&egrave;re's <span class="italic">Le m&eacute;decin malgr&eacute; lui</span> and <span class="italic">L'amour m&eacute;decin</span> (about this time he also played the lead role in Moli&egrave;re's <span class="italic">Tartuffe</span>), Alderman Gripe in Wycherley's <span class="italic">Love in a Wood, or, St James's Park</span> at Lincoln's Inn (still with Killigrew's company), and Intrigo in Sir Francis Fane's <span class="italic">Love in the Dark, or The Man of Business</span>. He is also reputed to have played Falstaff.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Dumb Lady</span>, as its title suggests, tells the story of a woman about to be married (Olinda) who appears to have fallen mute. Certain characters reflect that this is unsurprising in view of the fop she is to be married to: the aptly named Squire Softhead. They inform her father who is anxious for the match: &#145;Do you think your daughter had not better be dumb and dead than marry such a ridiculous brute as this?&#146;  (<span class="smallcap">I</span>.i, p. 14). Once again, Lacy's drama exhibits considerable empathy for its women characters. A physician is sent for to attend to Olinda's ailment and Jarvis and Softhead are tricked by Isabel into believing her husband Drench (the part played by Lacy) to be a physician. A great deal of knockabout farce ensues. Indeed farce in the French style appears to have been the form Lacy most favoured in his own compositions. It has been argued that Lacy's adaptation of Moli&egrave;re influenced that by Henry Fielding in the eighteenth century  (Colmer, 35&#150;9).<br>
<br>Contemporary satires alleged that Lacy had a relationship with the king's mistress Nell Gwyn. Certainly, he gave her acting and dancing lessons. He clearly kept up his dancing skills in later life, adding dances to the entr'actes of, for example, <span class="italic">Horace</span> in 1668. Financial issues seem to have pursued him in later life. In 1673 he was sued by one Mary Bennett, presumably for debt, and in 1674 he became embroiled in a debate over the pay of French dancers at the court. Lacy died on 17 September 1681 at his address in Drury Lane after a long and successful career and was buried in the churchyard of St Martin-in-the-Fields two days later.<br>
