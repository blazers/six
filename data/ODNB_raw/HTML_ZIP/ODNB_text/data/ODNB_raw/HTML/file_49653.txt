<span class="headword">Glynne,  Mary Dilys</span>  (1895&#150;1991), <span class="occ">plant pathologist</span>, was born Mary Dilys Glynne Jones on 19 February 1895 at Glyn Dyl, Upper Bangor, Caernarvonshire, the second daughter and third of five children of John Glynne Jones (1849&#150;1947), solicitor, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48526/', "Dilys Lloyd Glynne Jones, n&#233;e Davies (1857&#150;1932)")</script>, educationist. She was a pupil at the Bangor School for Girls, her mother having been a founding governor. She then went on to study at North London Collegiate School (where her mother had also been a pupil and, later, an assistant mistress), and graduated with a degree in botany in 1917 from the University College of North Wales, Bangor, in the founding of which institution both her parents had been closely involved.<br>
<br>Having dropped the &#145;Jones&#146; from her surname, Mary Glynne began her professional life in the department of agriculture at Bangor during her graduating summer. The director, Robert G. White, soon recommended her to (Edward) John Russell, director of the agricultural plant research station at Rothamsted. She went to Rothamsted in 1917, initially on a voluntary basis but soon as an assistant botanist under Winifred Brenchley. She remained in close professional and personal contact with Russell until his death, corresponding with him on material for his last work, <span class="italic">A History of Agricultural Science in Great Britain</span>, published posthumously in 1965. She was an advisory officer to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries from 1918 and in the same year transferred to the new Rothamsted mycology department as one of the original members under William B. Brierley. Her first major work was on the wart disease of potatoes (<i>Synchytrium endobioticum</i>), a soil-borne pathogen which was leading to widespread crop failure, and further economic losses when healthy produce could not be transported owing to disease control restrictions. She devised a method of identifying certain soil fungi and susceptible and resistant varieties of potato. Her method of isolating resistant varieties, the Glynne-Lemmerzahl method, remained in use, with modification, long after her death. She was awarded her MSc by the University of Wales for her publications on wart disease.<br>
<br>In 1927 Glynne was awarded the Georgina Sweet fellowship by the Australian Federation of University Women, which afforded a year's study in Australia. She worked on cereal diseases at the University of Melbourne and travelled through Victoria on the Department of Agriculture's &#145;Better Farming Train&#146;, a mobile demonstration and lecture facility promoting better farming and housekeeping practices through the dissemination of scientific knowledge. Her study tour extended to Tasmania and New Zealand and, on the return journey, to Cape Town and on up into Rhodesia, Kenya, and Tanganyika, learning about the practical problems of agriculture in the developing world.<br>
<br>On returning to Rothamsted after her year abroad Glynne concentrated on the study of soil-borne cereal diseases, with the autumn of 1930 spent at the Biologische Reichsanstalt in Berlin. She found that, rather than wind and rain, fungal disease at the base of wheat and barley stems was responsible for fields flattened before harvest. In addition to being the first to establish the fungal cause of eyespot of wheat in Britain (<i>Cercosporella (Pseudocercosporella) herpotrichoides</i>, later known as <i>Oculimacula spp.</i>) her extensive trials also established the detrimental effects of growing successive cereal crops on the same land, with clear guidance for addressing the problems through crop rotation, nutrition, and varietal changes. In 1935 she found <i>Gibellina cerealis</i>, a fungal pathogen isolated in the UK only at Rothamsted, thought to be traceable to Roman introduction (with the only overseas outbreaks in Italy, Russia, and China).<br>
<br>Glynne's work, which had a considerable impact on improving yields, gained particular attention during the Second World War, when optimum food production was vital. In 1943 she was awarded a DSc by the University of Wales. After the war she continued to work on cereal diseases, and extensive field trials confirmed her work on crop breaks and rotations. She was made an OBE for services to agriculture in 1960 and retired from her role as a principal scientific officer at Rothamsted in the same year, although she continued to work there on a voluntary basis for two years and her name last appeared on an academic paper in 1985. She was a fellow of the Institute of Biology and, in addition to the archive at Rothamsted, there is a collection of her papers at the Royal Geographical Society, particularly with regard to the lectures that she gave on Cambodia (and especially the temple complex of Angkor Wat) in the 1950s and 1960s.<br>
<br>In addition to a long and productive professional life Mary Glynne was a passionate and pioneering mountaineer. She came to climbing via fell walking and joined the Fell and Rock Climbing Club in the mid-1920s. While on the Georgina Sweet fellowship she climbed in Australia, New Zealand, and, on her homeward journey, South Africa. She was the first woman (and only the second person) to climb Mount Spencer in New Zealand. She served as vice-president of the Ladies' Alpine Club and was a member of the Pinnacle Club (a club for women climbers established in 1921). While her major Alpine climbs, including the Matterhorn, Mont Blanc, La Meije, and Aiguille du Dru, were between 1930 and 1933, she ascended Mount Fuji in Japan during a lecture tour in 1962 in her late sixties. In addition to climbing she went diving over the Great Barrier Reef and, in later life, developed an interest in yoga. She was an amateur, but well informed, archaeologist, an interest which led to involvement in the 1930s in the excavation of Verulamium (St Albans), with Sir Mortimer Wheeler calling on her professional expertise in examining carbonized Roman wheat grains, which informed her thinking on the incidence of wheat diseases in the area. She died of bronchopneumonia in the Field House Nursing Home in Harpenden on 9 May 1991, a short distance from Rothamsted, the setting of her long and remarkable professional life which had resulted in measurable and enduring improvements in agricultural production at home and abroad.<br>
