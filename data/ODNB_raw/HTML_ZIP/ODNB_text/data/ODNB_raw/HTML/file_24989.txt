<span class="headword">Seaton,  Edward Cator</span>  (1815&#150;1880), <span class="occ">public health administrator</span>, was born at Rochester, Kent, the son of an ex-naval surgeon. His early medical career followed the classic pattern of the ambitious young medical practitioner. He received his initial medical training from his father, took his MD at Edinburgh University in 1837, and briefly studied in Paris. He then joined his father in practice in Rochester, supplementing his income by working as a poor-law surgeon in the north Aylesford area. In 1841 he purchased a small practice and moved to Sloane Street, London. In addition to his private practice Seaton held posts at the Chelsea, Brompton, and Belgrave dispensaries. He was active in a number of medical societies and was a founding member of both the Western Medical Society and, in 1850, the Epidemiological Society; later he held the president's post in each. He was also a member of the London Pathological Society.<br>
<br>Seaton owed his career in public health to his membership of the Epidemiological Society, then the foremost forum for the discussion of public health matters; its members acted as <i>ex officio</i> advisers to government. In 1850 Seaton was appointed secretary to its committee on smallpox and vaccination. The committee's report was drawn up by Seaton and presented to parliament in 1852  (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1852&#150;3, 101, no. 434, and 1854&#150;5, 45, no. 88). It recommended that voluntary vaccination be replaced with a compulsory system. The report proved highly influential, its appearance coinciding with the introduction of a bill to make vaccination compulsory; the report was consequently greeted as timely expert advice on the subject. A number of its suggestions were subsequently incorporated into the <span class="roman">Compulsory Vaccination Act</span> of 1853.<br>
<br>The report established Seaton as an authority on vaccination and began his lifelong collaboration with John Simon, a fellow member of the Epidemiological Society and medical officer to the General Board of Health and later to the privy council. Both men were eager to expand the government's role in public health and to bring public health under expert supervision. Seaton's career mirrored the development of this central government role. In 1858 Seaton was appointed as one of the first medical staff at the privy council. As a temporary inspector (paid 5 guineas per day) Seaton investigated rates of vaccination in London. The following year this local study was expanded and it became a national survey, providing Seaton with sufficient work to allow him to give up private practice. The study concluded that much public vaccination practice was incompetent&#151;a finding used to justify the creation of a permanent inspectorate to supervise the work of vaccinators. Seaton was appointed as one of the four inspectors and given a salary. Over the next few years, in addition to his routine inspection work, he produced a <span class="italic">Handbook of Vaccination</span> (1868) as well as reports on the viability of calf-lymph (1870) and on the 1871&#150;3 smallpox epidemic (1875). He was probably involved in drafting the <span class="roman">Vaccination Bill</span> of 1871, and he also conducted inspections into the sanitary state of various towns and cities. With the dissolution of the medical office of the privy council in 1871, Seaton moved to the Local Government Board and became assistant medical officer under Simon. In June 1876 he succeeded Simon as medical officer. Seaton was noted for his administrative abilities&#151;his meticulous eye for detail, his capacity for work, and his sound judgement&#151;qualities which balanced John Simon's more visionary character.<br>
<br>Seaton's career brought professional honours and increasing wealth. In 1872 he was made a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. He moved to Surbiton in 1862 and to Gordon Square, London, in 1877. Seaton was the father of four sons and four daughters, one of whom became the second wife of Sir George Buchanan (1831&#150;1895). Seaton became ill in 1878 and was greatly affected by the death of his favourite son in the same year. He suffered a stroke in late 1879, and died at his son-in-law's house, 48 Ladbroke Grove, Notting Hill, London, on 21 January 1880; he was buried at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
