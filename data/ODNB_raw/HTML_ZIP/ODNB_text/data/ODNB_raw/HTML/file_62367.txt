<span class="headword">Eckenstein,  Oscar Johannes Ludwig</span>  (1859&#150;1921), <span class="occ">mountaineer</span>, was born at 29 Douglas Road, Islington, London, on 9 September 1859, the youngest of six children of Frederick Gottlieb Eckenstein (1820/21&#150;1891), a general merchant who had fled Germany in the wake of the 1848 revolutions, and his wife, Julie Amalie Antonia Helmke (1830/31&#150;1921). His sister was the feminist polymath and cultural historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59940/', "Lina Dorina Johanna Eckenstein (1857&#150;1931)")</script>. He was educated at University College School, London, and studied mathematics and chemistry at the universities of London and Bonn. He enjoyed a professional career as a railway engineer (with the International Railway Congress Association) and, later, as an analytical chemist. He espoused radical political and social views, was intolerant of what he regarded as English snobbery and xenophobia, and enjoyed gymnastics, rowing, skiing, poetry, puzzles, and playing the bagpipes.<br>
<br>Eckenstein started climbing when just thirteen, although little is known of his early exploits. Serious ascents in the Alps began in 1886 and went on until at least 1912. Together he and his occasional climbing companion August Lorria published a lavish volume of photographs of the Pennine Alps&#151;<span class="italic">The Alpine Portfolio</span> (1889). He regularly returned to Switzerland, and although a deep aversion to publicity meant that few of his routes were recorded in detail his distinctive approach is captured by an account of him shunning Alpine huts in favour of his own tent with a cork mattress and rubber underlay, using a handy crevasse as a refrigerator. He often climbed without the assistance of professional guides.<br>
<br>Eckenstein's domestic rock-climbing began on Lliwedd in 1887 and he returned regularly to Snowdonia, making a distinctive contribution to its climbing culture. He was a member of the first recorded mixed-sex climb (with Sophie Bryant, Sophie Nicholls, and Ashley Perry Abraham) in 1897. He regularly teamed up with J. M. Archer Thomson, and occasionally with other pioneers including Humphrey Owen Jones and Harold Hughes, and was a founder member of the Climbers' Club (1898). He pioneered &#145;shack&#146; life at the Pen y Pass hotel at the foot of Snowdon, living during his visits at Christmas and Easter in an iron shed left behind by one of the copper mining enterprises. He practised his technique of holds and balance on the large &#145;Eckenstein&#146; boulder, and cultivated his muscular strength. Although he led new climbs only rarely, his climbing ethic refashioned the approach to domestic rock. It was later written that &#145;provided he could get three fingers on something that could be described by a man far advanced in hashish as a ledge, [Eckenstein] would be smoking his pipe on that ledge a few seconds later, and none of us could tell how he had done it&#146;  (Crowley, 19).<br>
<br>In 1891 (William) Martin Conway asked Eckenstein to accompany him on his expedition the following year to the Karakoram. Two more contrasting characters in ideology, temperament, and approach to mountaineering could hardly have been imagined, and their relationship was not a happy one. Any initial plans to attempt the world's second highest mountain K2 (8611m) faltered, and Eckenstein, suffering from ill health, left the party to return home. He provided a prosaic if enthusiastic travelogue of his experiences in <span class="italic">The Karakorams and Kashmir</span> (1896), the most striking episode being his account of the meal he and Charles Glanville Bruce enjoyed on coming down from the mountains after two months of living on flour and mutton. In twenty-four hours they ate three chickens, a dozen chops, and over fifty eggs, washed down with gallons of milk.<br>
<br>In 1898, while at Wasdale Head in the Lake District, Eckenstein met Aleister Crowley. They became firm and loyal friends, notwithstanding Eckenstein's lack of interest in the occult. They journeyed to Mexico, where they climbed Popacatapetl (5452m) in 1901, the expedition exhausting its supplies so that for the last three days they subsisted on champagne and butter. The following year Eckenstein and Crowley attempted the ascent of K2. The multinational expedition ran into a series of difficulties: Eckenstein was temporarily refused permission to enter Kashmir (possibly owing to fears that he was a German spy); team members suffered from illnesses including altitude sickness and malaria; and there were quarrels concerning food, pack weights, and the route to be taken on the mountain. After reaching a respectable 6532m on the north-east ridge the expedition turned back, its achievements subsequently overshadowed by sensationalist accounts and by the notoriety which surrounded Crowley.<br>
<br>Eckenstein was both a pioneer in the development of the athletic potential of the human body on rock, and an innovator in the technology of mountaineering. He designed a new design of ten-point crampons and a much shorter and more wieldy ice axe which could be used one-handed, conducted experiments into the relative strength of knots, and championed the use of tricouni nails in climbing boots. Many of these innovations, which later became commonplace among the mountaineer's tools of trade, were regarded with great suspicion by the establishment circles of the Alpine Club, which he scorned.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Eckenstein served as a special constable, replacing active mountaineering with a bibliophile's fascination with the explorer Sir Richard Francis Burton. By this time Eckenstein's health was poor as tuberculosis took a grip. As he was a bachelor of long standing his marriage on 31 January 1918 to Margery Cattley Edwards (1890&#150;1976), thirty-one years his junior, came as a shock to his friends, Crowley writing of &#145;the unhappy termination of his life in phthisis and marriage&#146;  (Crowley, 155). She was the daughter of William Edwards, vicar of Bognor. The Eckensteins moved to The Cave, Oving, Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, where Oscar died of pulmonary tuberculosis on 8 April 1921. He was cremated at Golders Green crematorium.<br>
<br>This short, sturdy, asthmatic, bearded, sandal-wearing, shabbily dressed bohemian, whose choice of pipe tobacco was found particularly noxious by his companions, in retrospect appears to belong to the alternative culture of a much later generation of rock climbers. Fiercely independent, a determined controversialist in private and very occasionally in print, Eckenstein abhorred convention. Crowley stated: &#145;His detestation of every kind of humbug and false pretence was an overmastering passion. I have never met any man who upheld the highest moral ideals with such unflinching candour&#146;  (Crowley, 151).<br>
