<span class="headword">Denham,  Henry Mangles</span>  (1897&#150;1993), <span class="occ">naval officer and author</span>, was born on 9 September 1897 at 7 Kenton Avenue, Harrow, Middlesex, the son of Henry Mangles Denham, civil engineer, and his wife, Helen Clara, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lowndes. He joined the navy as a cadet in 1910, going to the Royal Naval College at Osborne and Dartmouth. He went to sea at the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, joining the pre-dreadnought battleship <i>Agamemnon</i>, and served in her in the Dardanelles campaign, commanding a steam picket boat during the landings at Suvla Bay in August 1915. He later published his diaries and notes from this period, <span class="italic">Dardanelles: a Midshipman's Diary, 1915&#150;16</span> (1981). After service in the destroyers <i>Racoon</i> and <i>Sylph</i>, he was one of the young officers sent by the Admiralty to Cambridge. He went up to Magdalene College in 1919 for what he recalled as one of the happiest years of his life.<br>
<br>In 1920 Denham served in the battle cruiser <i>Renown</i> during the prince of Wales's cruise to Australia and New Zealand. He then spent two years in the Rhine flotilla commanding a small armed motor launch as part of the Rhine army of occupation. Next he served in the battleship <i>Centurion</i> in the Mediterranean before going to Austria to learn German. On 3 May 1924 he married Estelle Margaret Sibbald 
    (Madge; 1898/9&#150;1979)
  , daughter of Charles Sibbald Currie, of independent means. There were one son and two daughters of the marriage. Following his marriage, Denham was a divisional officer in the boys' training ship <i>Impregnable</i> at Devonport from 1924 to 1926 and was then invited by Admiral Sir Osmond Brock, commander-in-chief, Portsmouth, to be his flag lieutenant. In 1927 he went to the Mediterranean for more than five years, serving in the fleet flagships <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> and <i>Warspite</i> as boats officer and as &#145;snotties' nurse&#146;, in charge of the midshipmen. In 1937 he was appointed executive officer of the new light cruiser <i>Penelope</i> and served in her during the Spanish Civil War and the Munich crisis.<br>
<br>Denham first joined naval intelligence in 1939, when he created an &#145;information section&#146;, recruiting civilians from many walks of life to gather intelligence about enemy and potential enemy coastlines through discreet surveys by yachtsmen and disguised fishermen. He was then appointed naval attach&eacute; in Copenhagen and arrived in the Danish capital on new year's day 1940. Hearing of increased German mine-sweeping activity in the Great Belt, he went down to the coast to look and he was actually sitting on the beach with a pair of binoculars on 7 April when the German cruiser <i>Bl&uuml;cher</i> and other ships passed by. Denham hurried to signal the Admiralty that it was probable that the Germans were about to move against Norway. But his warning, like other intelligence pointing the same way, was ignored, and the German landings, forty-eight hours later, caught the Home Fleet off balance. When the Germans entered Copenhagen, Denham and the rest of the legation staff went by special train to Ostend and thence to London. He was then appointed naval attach&eacute; in Stockholm, where he arrived early in June 1940 to find himself plunged into a diplomatic furore over four destroyers which the Swedish navy had bought from Italy and which had reached the Faeroes, where they were illegally seized by the British. Denham's tactful handling of the head of the Swedish navy defused a tense situation but Great Britain had to pay 1 million Swedish kronor in damages.<br>
<br>It was Denham who first warned the Admiralty by &#145;most immediate&#146; signal on 20 May 1941 that &#145;two large warships&#146;, escorted by destroyers and aircraft, had been sighted at sea in the Kattegat off G&ouml;teborg that afternoon. They proved to be the German battleship <i>Bismarck</i> and the heavy cruiser <i>Prinz Eugen</i>, about to sail on their Atlantic sortie. Denham heard the news from the Norwegian military attach&eacute;, Colonel Roscherlund, but doubted its authenticity. It seemed to him unlikely that the sighting could have been reported so quickly and he gave it only a modest reliability grading. But the German ships had indeed been sighted and reported by a Swedish cruiser. Denham's signal set in train the dramatic series of events which led to the destruction of <i>Bismarck</i> on 27 May. Denham was gratified to receive an Admiralty acknowledgement of the crucial part his signal had played. Through such friends as Colonel Bj&ouml;rnstjerna, the director of Swedish combined intelligence, and Ebbe Munck, the Danish Arctic explorer and journalist, Denham was able to gather many other valuable pieces of information. He also played an important part in helping George Binney to organize the smuggling of special steels, ballbearings, and tools to England.<br>
<br>The Swedes were always suspicious of Denham and kept a close watch on him. At dinner in his flat one evening a noise was heard overhead. A man was discovered in the loft, eavesdropping with a microphone. The Swedes were much impressed, however, when, in a dark period for the allies, they heard that Denham had sent a telegram to England, ordering a yacht to be built for him to sail after the war. In 1945 Denham was appointed CMG, a rare award for a naval officer in the Second World War. He also received decorations from the Dutch, the Danes, and the Norwegians. Even the Swedes&#151;though they tapped his telephone, bugged his flat, and tried constantly to have him expelled as <i>persona non grata</i>&#151;offered him a decoration which the British government refused him permission to accept.<br>
<br>After retiring from the navy in 1947 Denham was able to indulge his love of sailing, and he embarked on another career as a nautical travel writer. He published a series of <span class="roman">Sea Guides</span>, <span class="italic">The Aegean</span> (1963); <span class="italic">The Eastern Mediterranean</span> (1964); <span class="italic">The Adriatic</span> (1967); <span class="italic">The Tyrrhenian Sea</span> (1969); <span class="italic">The Ionian Islands to Rhodes</span> (1972); <span class="italic">Southern Turkey, the Levant and Cyprus</span> (1973); and <span class="italic">The Ionian Islands to the Anatolian Coast</span> (1982). These were a most readable blend of practical seamanship, navigational tips, history, and mythology. In 1981 he published the diary he had kept (contrary to regulations) as a midshipman in the Dardanelles, containing many caustic remarks about his senior officers. His war memoirs, <span class="italic">Inside the Nazi Ring: a Naval Attach&eacute; in Sweden, 1940&#150;1945</span>, appeared in 1984.<br>
<br>As a naval attach&eacute;, Denham was outstanding. With his experience of <i>Renown</i>'s royal cruise and as a flag lieutenant, he was socially very accomplished. With his height and his fine-drawn features, he looked like a distinguished diplomat. Urbane and discreet, he made friends easily and had a gift for making and keeping contacts. He was a member of the Royal Automobile and Royal Cruising clubs, and of the Royal Yacht Squadron. He died at his home, 8 Carlyle Square, Chelsea, London, on 15 July 1993, of bronchopneumonia. He was survived by his son and two daughters.<br>
