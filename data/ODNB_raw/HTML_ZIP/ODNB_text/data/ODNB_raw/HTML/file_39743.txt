<span class="headword">Batchelor,  Thomas</span>  (1775&#150;1838), <span class="occ">farmer and writer on language</span>, was born on 25 September 1775 at Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire, the fifth child of Joseph Batchelor (1741&#150;1804) and Ann Brandon (<i>d</i>. 1792), farmers. He was baptized in 1785 at Ampthill where, from the age of ten to thirteen, he went to school. At this time, spelling book fables were the only texts he could read with any real sense of enjoyment, his particular favourite being <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span>. After he left school, Quarle's <span class="italic">Emblems</span> became his favourite, and this, in conjunction with Isaac Watts's hymns, nourished his interest in rhyme. These were subsequently complemented by <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>, Edward Young's <span class="italic">Night Thoughts</span>, and Daniel Fenning's <span class="italic">The Royal English Dictionary, or, A Treasury of the English Language</span> (1761).<br>
<br>In 1792 the family moved to Boughton End, half a mile south of Lidlington, where they were tenant farmers of the duke of Bedford. Although Batchelor initially had difficulty in reading without the help of a dictionary, by the age of nineteen he had written about 1500 lines of verse mainly dealing with local news. He continued to compose short pieces while working in the fields, and one of his poems was published in the <span class="italic">Monthly Mirror</span> in 1801. A journey through his native village of Marston in 1799 provided material and the inspiration for his <span class="italic">Village Scenes: the Progress of Agriculture, and other Poems</span> which was eventually published in 1804, the year of his father's death. The draft with its numerous corrections was eventually deposited in Bedfordshire Record Office.<br>
<br>In conjunction with his brothers Batchelor continued to run the farm, but his precarious financial position compelled him to look for other forms of income. In 1806, while employed by the board of agriculture, he embarked on an extensive survey of his native county. His <span class="italic">General View of the Agriculture of the County of Bedford</span>, one of a series edited by Arthur Young, was published two years later. On 6 August 1807 he married Elizabeth Franklin; their only child, Elizabeth, was born in 1809. The same year his texts <span class="italic">An Orthoepical Analysis of the English Language</span> and <span class="italic">An Orthoepical Analysis of the Dialect of Bedfordshire</span> were published in one volume. The former focused on explaining the provincial variations in pronouncing various words in different languages and dialects. Batchelor invented an orthoepical alphabet of his own consisting of thirty characters all designated by new names. One of the key aims of the latter was to provide a means of &#145;explaining the diversity of dialect among civilised nations&#146;  (Zettersten, xi). Batchelor's interest in orthography also encompassed several other fields of linguistics but principally phonetics and phonology. His research into dialects led him to study vocabulary and syntax, and he was responsible for pioneering a detailed investigation of the Bedfordshire dialect.<br>
<br>The long-term aim of Batchelor's research was to enhance the quality of pronunciation in the provincial schools of Bedfordshire. Shortly after its publication, however, his work was criticized in the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> (63, 1810) and, following the bankruptcy of his publishers in the same year, his interest in the topic virtually ceased. According to Zettersten, Batchelor occupies a distinguished place in the history of English phonology, being the first scholar to appreciate the dipthongizations of two of the most significant sound changes in the English language. His area of research remained virtually untouched until the completion of D. H. Shaw's PhD thesis in the 1960s and the publication of the first volumes of the <span class="italic">Surveys of English Dialects</span>  (Zettersten, x).<br>
<br>After 1810 Batchelor devoted his energies to devising numerous series of shorthand based on the phonetic principle. His interest in this topic was prompted by Thomas Gurney, brother of his grandmother, who had been appointed the first shorthand writer to the House of Commons in the 1750s. While Batchelor's efforts in this sphere proved too cumbersome to be used commercially, the subsequent transcription of his manuscripts provides a valuable insight into the language used by the contemporary middle class in Batchelor's locality.<br>
<br>After 1809 Batchelor focused primarily on agricultural interests and was commissioned by the board of agriculture to undertake a survey of Dorset, a task which he finished in the following year. Much to his annoyance, however, it was published in 1814 under the name of William Stevenson, who had revised Batchelor's work and incorporated some additional material. In addition to his farming activities he was a prolific agricultural writer of articles on a wide variety of rural issues. Many of his contributions were published in the <span class="italic">Farmers' Journal</span> under the name of Bedfordshire. It is also highly likely that he was the editor of the Bedfordshire <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> after 1823. He also invented the lever drill (an improvement to the seed drill) which was of limited commercial success.<br>
<br>Batchelor died at Lidlington on 23 February 1838 and was buried alongside his wife and other relatives in the old graveyard near the church of St Margaret, which rapidly fell into disuse and was pulled down  (<span class="italic">VCH</span>, 3.307). Despite his lowly social position, living an isolated life in a country village, and being almost completely self-educated, Batchelor achieved a modest level of distinction in linguistics, agriculture, and poetry which was only recognized after his death. He was a perceptive observer who did not accept the evidence of other orthoepists in an uncritical way. Batchelor was an enterprising and enthusiastic pioneer whose potential had been inhibited by family, farming, and financial troubles.<br>
