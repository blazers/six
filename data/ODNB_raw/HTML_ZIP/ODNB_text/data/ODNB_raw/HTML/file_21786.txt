<span class="headword">Pelham, Sir  Edmund</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1606), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the fifth son of Sir William Pelham (<i>d</i>. 1538) of Laughton, Sussex, and Mary, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24653/', "William Sandys, first Baron Sandys")</script>. He was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21800/', "Sir William Pelham (d. 1587)")</script>, lord justice of Ireland in 1579&#150;80. He entered Gray's Inn in 1563, was called to the bar in 1574, and was autumn reader in 1588. From about 1583 he was a justice of the peace for Sussex, and in October 1597 he became a member of parliament for Hastings. He acted again as reader in 1601 and in the same year was appointed serjeant-at-law. In September 1602 Pelham replaced Sir Robert Napier as chief baron of the exchequer in Ireland. The following year he acted as a justice of assize in Donegal, the first English judge to go on circuit to the north-west of Ireland. He recorded his impressions of the visit, commenting on the multitude of people, and how they welcomed him as if he had been &#145;a good angel sent from heaven&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1558&#150;1603</span>, 3.193) and begged him to return and administer justice. Like many of his contemporaries in the administration he saw the power of Hugh O'Neill as oppressive and tyrannical and he commented that even the better sort were forced to defer to O'Neill before they would parley with him. Nevertheless he was confident that a parliament would remove these difficulties, and that a better acquaintance with English justice would ensure &#145;the greater number will grow human and civil and merit the name of a commonwealth&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1603&#150;6</i>, 111).<br>
<br>In 1604 Pelham visited England and was knighted by James I at Greenwich on 3 July. He soon returned to Ireland, and in October was on a commission inquiring into the destruction of Sir Henry Harrington's lands during the recent war. In March 1605 he went on circuit, holding sessions in co. Meath, co. Westmeath, Longford, Queen's county, and King's county. But in 1606 he became ill and it was reported that he was unlikely to recover. He sailed to England and on the return journey died at Chester on 4 June 1606. On hearing of his death Sir Arthur Chichester said he was &#145;a very learned and worthy judge&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1603&#150;6</i>, 522). Pelham was survived by his wife, Ellen, daughter of Thomas Darrell of Scotney. They had five sons&#151;Herbert, George, Edmund, Henry, and Thomas&#151;and three daughters&#151;Elizabeth, Ellen, and Phillipa. His manor at Catsfield, Sussex, was left to his wife for her lifetime and thereafter to his son and heir, Herbert. Pelham's will was proved for his widow in 1609, at which time she was in trouble for her recusancy.<br>
