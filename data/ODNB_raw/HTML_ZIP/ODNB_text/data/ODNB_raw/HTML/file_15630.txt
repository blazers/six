<span class="headword">Kinloch,  George Ritchie</span>  (1797/8&#150;1877), <span class="occ">lawyer and antiquary</span>, was born probably in Jamaica, one of at least seven children of George Kinloch (1741&#150;1802), deputy judge advocate and master in chancery in Jamaica, and his wife, Susannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wigglesworth (1759&#150;1841), of Edinburgh. Named after his father and in memory of a dead elder brother, Kinloch returned from Jamaica as a young boy and was educated in Edinburgh, where he qualified as a writer to the signet. His early and not unsuccessful career as a clerk to several advocates depute must have been somewhat blighted by the death of his first wife, Mary Stewart. They married on 8 September 1817, and their only child, Susan Janet, was born on 6 August 1819. Mary Stewart evidently died not long afterwards, because on 29 July 1822 he married Helen Tod (1799&#150;1879).<br>
<br>A successful professional of wide literary interests, Kinloch is best known for his genuine and informed interest in Scottish song, particularly in that from his family's ancestral homelands in the north east of Scotland. Between 1827 and 1848 he edited or contributed to nine works. These ranged from his <span class="italic">Ballad Book</span> (1827), recounting the life and songs of &#145;Mussel mou'd Charlie &hellip; a celebrated peripatetick ballad singer in the town and county of Aberdeen&#146;, to <span class="italic">Nugea Scoticae</span>, a jointly edited work preserving &#145;fugitive pieces&#146; illustrative of Scottish affairs from 1535 to 1781. His most important work, however, was his studious, informative, and original <span class="italic">Ancient Scottish Ballads</span> (1827), intended to redress the preponderance of such text as Scott's <span class="italic">Border Minstrelsy</span>, drawn from southern Scotland. The glowing acknowledgement paid to Kinloch by Dr John Jamieson in his preface to the supplement to the Scottish dictionary of 1824 also bears testimony to his enthusiasm for and knowledge of the Scots language; it is a pity that his projected work on Scottish proverbs never appeared.<br>
<br>Between 1842 and 1869 Kinloch held the office of principal keeper of the register of deeds and probative writs. During this time he was a member of the Maitland and other literary societies, and &#145;devoted much time to the work that fell to him as treasurer and one of the trustees, of the Paterson and Pape fund for the relief of decayed old men and women&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>). Kinloch died at his family home, West Coates Villa, Edinburgh, on 21 April 1877.<br>
