<span class="headword">Wulfweard White</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1072<span class="mult">x</span>86), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, held eight estates in Buckinghamshire, amounting to 90 hides, with his wife, Eadgifu, on the eve of the Norman conquest. His name is not uncommon and only when his distinctive byname is used can he be identified with certainty, unless other indications are present, such as his connection with the queen (see below). Not all his land is listed in <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>; he is named as one of the leading thegns both in Kent and in Lincolnshire, but in neither case can his estates be traced, probably because they were in the hands of tenants. Nevertheless, his recorded holding, of 150 hides scattered over eleven shires, makes him the eighth richest of the thegns below the rank of earl whose lands are recorded in <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>.<br>
<br>Much of Wulfweard's land seems to have been the fruit of royal service, though he also held as a tenant of the Old Minster, Winchester, the bishop of Sherborne, and the abbot of Glastonbury. In Middlesex he is called &#145;King Edward's thegn&#146;, but in other contexts he is associated with the queen. He was probably connected with the households first of Queen Emma and then of Queen Edith, for Emma left him a life interest in land at Hayling, Hampshire, which Edith confirmed  (<span class="italic">Domesday Book</span>, 1.43<i>v</i>); the land was to be held of the Old Minster, Winchester, and the agreement between the church and Wulfweard <i>hwita</i> (&#145;white&#146;) still exists  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1476). Wulfweard survived the conquest, for he is probably the Wulfweard who attested a royal charter of 1068, and certainly the Wulfweard <i>hwite</i> who witnessed a private sale of land in 1072, the latter in company with Queen Edith; he also attested (as Wulfweard Wita) a memorandum on the customs of Taunton, which cannot be precisely dated. It has been suggested that he was alive as late as 1084, but he was certainly dead by 1086, though his wife, Eadgifu, was then still holding two of her former tenements  (<span class="italic">Domesday Book</span>, 1.87, 145). It is possible that Wulfweard predeceased Queen Edith (<i>d</i>. 1075) for it was she who arranged the marriage of his daughter with her steward, &AElig;thelsige of Bromham; by 1086 &AElig;thelsige had lost the land which he had held at Bromham and elsewhere in Bedfordshire, but was holding three manors of the queen's gift, two of which, the former possessions of Wulfweard White, he had received with his wife  (<span class="italic">Domesday Book</span>, 1.153).<br>
<br>The Wulfweard Cild, son of Eadgifu, who appears among the pre-conquest landowners in Buckinghamshire, has been identified as the son of Wulfweard White and Eadgifu; but these references may be to Wulfweard White himself, for Eadgifu was a common name, and may have been borne by his mother as well as by his wife. If Wulfweard Cild was indeed Wulfweard White's son, then he probably predeceased his father, for the redistribution of Wulfweard White's lands suggests that they reverted on his death to his lords, King William and Queen Edith.<br>
