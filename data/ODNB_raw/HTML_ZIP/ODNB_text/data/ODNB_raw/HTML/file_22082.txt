<span class="headword">Peyton, Sir  John Strutt</span>  (1786&#150;1838), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born in London on 14 January 1786, was the third son of William Peyton, chief clerk of the Navy Office, grandson of Admiral Joseph Peyton (<i>d</i>. 1804), and great-grandson of Commodore Edward Peyton. His father's three brothers were also all in the navy; one of them, John, who died a rear-admiral in 1809, was captain of the <i>Defence</i> in the battle of the Nile. His grandmother was a daughter of Commander John Strutt; his mother was the daughter of Commander Jacob Lobb, who died in command of the sloop <i>Kingfisher</i> in 1773, and was sister of Captain William Granville Lobb, afterwards a commissioner of the navy.<br>
<br>Peyton first went to sea in October 1797, on the <i>Hector</i>, off Cadiz; he was then for three years in the <i>Emerald</i> in the Mediterranean, and in January 1801 was appointed to the <i>San Josef</i>, Nelson's flagship in the channel. With Nelson, his patron, he was moved to the <i>St George</i>, in which he was in the Baltic and afterwards off Cadiz and in the West Indies, for part of the time under his uncle, Captain Lobb. During 1802&#150;3 he served, in quick succession, in several frigates in the channel or in the North Sea, and in August 1803 was sent out to the <i>Victory</i>, Nelson's flagship off Toulon. In March 1805 he was appointed acting lieutenant of the <i>Canopus</i>, from which he was moved in May to the frigate <i>Ambuscade</i>, with Captain William Durban, employed during the next two years in the Adriatic. Peyton's commission as lieutenant was dated 7 October 1805. In July 1807, having been sent to destroy a vessel which ran herself ashore near Ortona, he was wounded in the right elbow by a musket bullet; the arm had to be amputated, and he was invalided.<br>
<br>On 1 December 1807 Peyton was promoted commander, and from June 1809 to February 1811 he commanded the brig <i>Ephira</i> in the North Sea, in the Walcheren expedition, and afterwards off Cadiz. He was then appointed to the <i>Weazle</i> (18 guns), in the Aegean archipelago; and on 26 September 1811 was posted to the <i>Minstrel</i> (20 guns), in which, and afterwards in the <i>Thames</i>, he was employed on the coast of Valencia and Catalonia until near the end of the war. During this time he repeatedly fought coastal batteries and privateers, and received the thanks of Sir Edward Pellew, the commander-in-chief. In September 1813 the <i>Thames</i> returned to England and was paid off. In October 1814 Peyton married a daughter of Lieutenant Woodyear RN, of St Kitts, and they had three daughters and two sons.<br>
<br>On 25 January 1836 Peyton was made a KCH, and in June 1836 was appointed to the <i>Madagascar</i> (46 guns), in which he went out to the West Indies. In the spring of 1838 he had to be invalided, returned in extreme ill health, and died at his lodgings in Somerset Street, Portman Square, London, on 20 May.<br>
