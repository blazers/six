</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lancaster, Sir  Osbert</span>  (1908&#150;1986), <span class="occ">cartoonist and designer</span>, was born in London on 4 August 1908, the only child of Robert Lancaster (<i>d</i>. 1916) and his wife, Clare Bracebridge Manger. His grandfather, Sir William Lancaster, became secretary of the Prudential Assurance Company and his father had a job in the City but enlisted in the army in 1914. He was killed in the battle of the Somme. Lancaster was sent to St Ronan's preparatory school in Worthing, and then to Charterhouse School, an appropriate school for a caricaturist, as John Leech, W. M. Thackeray, and Max Beerbohm had all been there. (In the 1950s Lancaster received Beerbohm's warm compliments when he painted murals in the Randolph Hotel, Oxford, illustrating scenes from <span class="italic">Zuleika Dobson</span>.)<br>
<br>Lancaster did not shine at school (the headmaster's final report pronounced him &#145;irretrievably gauche&#146;) but was admitted to Lincoln College, Oxford, in 1926. Like his friend John Betjeman, Lancaster became a &#145;figure&#146; at Oxford. He wore loud checks, sported a monocle, and grew a large moustache. He contributed cartoons to <span class="italic">Cherwell</span>, the university magazine. He and Betjeman were fascinated by the Victorians and their architecture, an interest which began half in a spirit of mockery, but ended in expert championship. Lancaster obtained a fourth-class degree in English (1930) after an extra year of study. Intended for the bar, he failed his bar examinations.<br>
<br>He then went to the Slade School of Art, where he met his first wife, Karen Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1964), the second daughter of Sir Austin Harris, vice-chairman of Lloyds Bank. They were married in 1933 and had one son and one daughter. Lancaster found work alongside Betjeman as an assistant editor at the <span class="italic">Architectural Review</span>. In 1936 his <span class="italic">Progress at Pelvis Bay</span> began the long sequence of his books satirizing architecture and social life. He was appointed cartoonist to the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> in 1939 and on 1 January the first of his pocket cartoons appeared in its William Hickey column. He drew roughly 10,000 cartoons, with only brief interruptions, over the next forty years, many of them appearing on the front page. Lancaster's fusion of topicality and urbane wit was consistent. He depicted the world he knew&#151;that of Canon Fontwater, Father O'Bubblegum, Mrs Frogmarch (the Tory lady), and, his most enduring creation, Maudie, countess of Littlehampton, and her dim, monocled husband Willy. Lancaster's satire was not splenetic, and, except in the cause of good architecture, he was never a crusader.<br>
<br>In the Second World War, Lancaster joined the press censorship bureau (1939) and was sent to Greece, with which he fell in love, as a Foreign Office press attach&eacute; (1944&#150;6). The British ambassador was being too high-handed with the press, and Lancaster effectively smoothed things over. His first book published after the war was <span class="italic">Classical Landscape with Figures</span> (1947), a descriptive work based on his Greek experience. <span class="italic">The Saracen's Head</span> (1948) and <span class="italic">Draynflete Revealed</span> (1949) were in the manner of his pre-war satires, though the former was pitched as a children's book.<br>
<br>In 1951 Lancaster worked with John Piper on designs for the Festival of Britain. In the same year, on Piper's recommendation, he designed his first stage set, for <span class="italic">Pineapple Poll</span> at Sadler's Wells. This and the many stage designs that followed (several for Glyndebourne) released him from the austerity of line and allowed him to indulge in the Mediterranean colour he loved. In 1953 the Lancasters moved to Leicester House, a stucco Regency mansion at Henley-on-Thames. Karen died in 1964 and in 1967 Lancaster married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101855/', "Anne Eleanor Scott-James (1913&#150;2009)")</script>, journalist and author, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35996/', "Rolfe Arnold Scott-James")</script>, also journalist and author.<br>
<br>The 1960s with their fashionable fads and fantasies were perfect fodder for Lancaster's type of social satire. He would come into the <span class="italic">Express</span> office after lunching at one of his four clubs and hold court for a while, telling jokes, before settling down with the day's newspapers. George Malcolm Thomson, right-hand man to Lord Beaverbrook, said of Lancaster: &#145;The annoying thing at the <span class="italic">Express</span> was, not only was he the only one who could draw; he could also <i>write</i> better than anyone in the building&#146;. The prose, admittedly, was an acquired taste, and it had to be taken on its own terms. When Betjeman wrote to congratulate Lancaster on &#145;that deliciously convoluted prose you write&#146;, the implied censure was not lost on Lancaster. The prose had to be taken as part of the rich plum-cake fruitiness of the character Lancaster had created for himself. It was often said that he looked like one of his own cartoon characters and, as he aged, he resembled more and more an effigy of the English gentleman on a French carnival float: bulging eyes, bulbous nose, buffalo-horn moustache, bald head, striped shirt, pinstripe suit from Thresher and Glenny, old-fashioned shoes with rounded toes.<br>
<br>&#145;Osbert, it quickly becomes clear&#146;, wrote the architect Sir Hugh Casson, &#145;was a performance, meticulously practised and hilariously inflated and at times disturbing.&#146; What, he wondered, was behind that &#145;elaborately woven yashmak of subsidiary clauses, this defensive portcullis of anecdotes, cranked into place at one's approach?&#146; Lancaster was a work of art as memorable as any he created. It was as if he had chosen to be a &#145;living museum&#146; exhibit, representing not the period of his own life but that of his lost father.<br>
<br>Lancaster was appointed CBE in 1953 and knighted in 1975, in which year he also received an honorary DLitt at Oxford. He also received honorary degrees from Birmingham (1964), Newcastle upon Tyne (1970), and St Andrews (1974). He was a fellow of University College, London (1967), an honorary fellow of RIBA and of Lincoln College, Oxford (1979), and was made RDI (1979). He died in Chelsea on 27 July 1986 and was buried at West Winch, Norfolk.<br>
