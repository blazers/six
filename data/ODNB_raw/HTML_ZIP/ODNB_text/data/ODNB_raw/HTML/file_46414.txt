<span class="headword">Elles,  Gertrude Lilian</span>  (1872&#150;1960), <span class="occ">geologist and palaeontologist</span>, was born on 8 October 1872 in Wimbledon, Surrey, one of six children of Jamison Elles, an importer of Chinese goods, and his wife, Mary Chesney. Her father was Scottish and, when she was a child, family holidays were often spent in the Scottish highlands. She was educated at Wimbledon high school and at Newnham College, Cambridge (1891&#150;7), where she took the natural sciences tripos (second class in part one, 1894; first class in part two, geology, 1895). From 1895 to 1897 she was a Bathurst student of Newnham, and worked for part of the time in Lund, Sweden.<br>
<br>The work for which Elles became known was the monumental monograph <span class="italic">British Graptolites</span> (1901&#150;18). Brought out jointly with her friend Ethel Wood (later Shakespear), under the general editorship of Charles Lapworth, it provided reliable and detailed descriptions of this huge fossil group, critical in zonal division and correlation of Lower Palaeozoic rocks. It was perhaps the single most notable early contribution by women to British stratigraphic geology and long remained the basis of research in the area. Elles wrote the text and Wood prepared the illustrations. Also notable was Elles's 1922 paper (one of many on Lower Palaeozoic palaeontology and stratigraphy) analysing graptolite evolutionary patterns. Latterly she switched her attention to the metamorphic rocks of the Scottish highlands, her favourite part of the country.<br>
<br>Elles taught both men and women at Cambridge. Until 1926, when she was appointed university lecturer, she held an assistant demonstratorship in the Sedgwick Museum. In 1936 she became the university's first woman reader. At Newnham College she was successively lecturer, director of natural science, and vice-principal (1925&#150;36). She was remembered by colleagues as an able administrator and an enthusiastic and inspiring teacher.<br>
<br>In her youth Elles was a striking woman, with deep blue eyes and corn-coloured hair. As a student she played on the Newnham hockey team; later she was a favourite coach. During the First World War she was Red Cross commandant of a small hospital for soldiers in Cambridge, work for which she was appointed MBE in 1920.<br>
<br>A fellow of the Geological Society (where she was the first woman council member, 1923&#150;7), Elles was awarded the Murchison medal in 1919. She took a DSc at Trinity College, Dublin in 1907; in 1949, thirteen years after her retirement, Cambridge honoured her with an ScD. She moved to a nursing home in Helensburgh, Dunbartonshire, in 1960, and died there, unmarried, on 18 November of that year. Her remains were cremated at the crematorium in Cardcross, near Helensburgh, on 21 November.<br>
