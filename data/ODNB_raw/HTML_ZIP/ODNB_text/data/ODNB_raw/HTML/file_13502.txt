<span class="headword">Hole,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1746, <em>d.</em> 1803), <span class="occ">poet and antiquary</span>, was baptized on 2 June 1746 at St Peter's Cathedral, Exeter, the son of William Hole (<i>d</i>. 1791), archdeacon of Barnstaple and canon of Exeter Cathedral, and his wife, Thomasin. He was educated at the grammar school in Exeter before matriculating on 23 March 1764 at Exeter College, Oxford, where he graduated BCL on 3 May 1771. As a young man Hole involved himself with amateur theatricals, acting in <span class="italic">The Beaux' Stratagem</span> at grammar school and composing prologues and epilogues at college. While studying law at Oxford he circulated some facetious poems and began his <span class="italic">Poetical Translation of Fingal</span>, published in 1772. Under the influence of his friend General John Graves Simcoe, afterwards the first governor of Upper Canada, Hole briefly entertained the idea of a military career, though in the event he elected to enter the clergy. On 28 October 1776 he married Wilhelmina Katenkamp, daughter of a prosperous Exeter merchant, and the following year obtained the curacy of Sowton, near Exeter. He remained at Sowton after being presented in 1777 to the living of Buckerell, which lacked a suitable residence.<br>
<br>Hole's couplet adaptation of <span class="italic">Ossian</span> was the beginning of a literary career devoted to the more obscure corners of literature, history, and geography. His next literary enterprise, a translation of the <span class="italic">Homeric Hymn to Ceres</span> (1781) undertaken with the assistance of Samuel Badcock, proved more successful, being several times republished in the nineteenth century. Like his friend Richard Polwhele, Hole had a passion for Greek literature, local history, and religious superstitions. He contributed to the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, <span class="italic">British Magazine</span>, and <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, and in 1782 contributed to the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> a series of eight satirical dialogues entitled &#145;The Link Boy&#146; in which the speakers include Don Quixote, Walter Shandy, Matthew Bramble, Clarissa Harlowe, and Sophie Western. Hole's humour also appears in a posthumously published farrago of scholarship and vulgarity, &#145;The Exmoor courtship, from the best editions, illustrated with notes critical, historical, philosophical, and classical&#146;, a Theocritean eclogue in the Exmoor dialect with a facing &#145;translation&#146; into court pastoral.<br>
<br>Hole's major work, <span class="italic">Arthur, or, The Northern Enchantments</span> (1789), is a romance epic in seven books which in places imitates Homer, Virgil, Ariosto, and Spenser. But <span class="italic">Ossian</span> is the presiding influence in the first Arthuriad to recreate the manners and belief systems of fifth-century Britain. In an original story Arthur's Britons, allied with the Irish, repel a horde of invading Saxons and Scandinavians. Supernatural forces figure largely as Merlin, whose daughter is betrothed to Arthur, is pitted against Urda and the Weird Sisters, who assist Hengist. The historical and geographical setting suggests that the Exeter poet was attempting to do for west Britain what Macpherson's <span class="italic">Ossian</span> had done for Scotland.<br>
<br>Hole was a founding member of the literary society at Exeter whose members included Richard Polwhele, Hugh Downman, and William Jackson (who set to music Hole's &#145;Ode to Imagination&#146;). Writings by Hole (including Miltonic odes to terror, melancholy, and stupidity, and several philological essays) appear in the society's two publications, <span class="italic">Poems Chiefly by Gentlemen of Devonshire and Cornwall</span> (1792) and <span class="italic">Essays, by a Society of Gentleman at Exeter</span> (1796). Papers read before the Exeter literary society resulted in <span class="italic">Remarks on the Arabian Nights' Entertainments</span> (1797) which in turn led to a parallel work on Homer, a fragment of which was posthumously published in 1807 as <span class="italic">An Essay on the Character of Ulysses</span>. Hole displays a considerable if curious erudition in illustrating the monsters and marvels encountered by the two Mediterranean travellers. He left behind a commonplace book containing several original plays. Polwhele later quarrelled with Downman and Hole, and a review of the <span class="italic">Essays</span> which Hole erroneously attributed to Polwhele led to a falling-out and acrimonious exchanges in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. In 1792 Hole was promoted by the bishop of Exeter to the rectory of Faringdon, which he held with Buckerell, and afterwards to Inwardleigh, near Okehampton, which he held with Faringdon until his death. He died at Exmouth, after a painful illness, on 28 May 1803. He was survived by his wife of twenty-six years.<br>
<br>Hole's legacy as a poet and translator appears most obviously in the poetry of his nephew John Herman Merivale. While his personal character and literary abilities were highly esteemed in his Exeter circle, Hole's wry humour and antiquarian enthusiasms did not attract much attention elsewhere. In his &#145;Reply to <i>Blackwood's</i>&#146; Byron catalogues &#145;Hoole, and Hole, and Hoyle&#146; among the bards of wilted reputation  (Byron, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, ed. R. E. Prothero, 1898&#150;1904, 4.488). In the Devonshire <span class="italic">Essays</span> appear defences of Shylock and Iago, the irony of which, like that of Swift's <span class="italic">Modest Proposal</span>, was lost on several later critics. <span class="italic">Arthur, or, The Northern Enchantments</span> drew mixed reviews: while all approved of the subject, Nathan Drake objected to Hole's imitation of Ariosto, Egerton Brydges to his use of couplets, and Robert Southey, comparing <span class="italic">Arthur</span> to Wilkie's <span class="italic">Epigoniad</span>, to the departures from the Arthur of legend. Yet Southey's own ethnographic epics probably owe something to a childhood reading of Hole's romance. If his heroic couplets and Shandean wit belonged to the last age, Hole's imaginative reconstructions of exotic places and pagan beliefs anticipated much later romantic fabling.<br>
