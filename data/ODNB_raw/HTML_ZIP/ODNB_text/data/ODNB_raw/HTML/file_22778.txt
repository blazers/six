<span class="headword">Pricke,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1642&#150;1708), <span class="occ">publisher and translator</span>, was born in central London, the son of Robert Pricke (<i>bap</i>. 1624) and his wife, Dorothy Mitchell. Little is known of his early life, but Horace Walpole says that he was a student of the etcher Wenceslaus Hollar. His first known publication is an etched map of London showing the damage caused by the great fire, issued about 1667 from an address in Whitecross Street. This was probably his father's house: Robert senior was beadle of the Salters' Company which had, in 1651, granted him the lease of a &#145;tenement in Whitecross street&#146;  (Watson, 45). The fire marks the beginning of Pricke's work as a printseller, and he went on to supply the regenerators of London with a range of practical treatises and pattern books. He had contacts in Amsterdam, probably with the Danckerts family, and imported French, Dutch, and Italian books and prints. Indeed, his greatest contribution was as a popularizer and disseminator of continental ideas and models, which formed the basis for nearly all his own publications.<br>
<br>Pricke's first book was probably <span class="italic">A Booke of Archetecture</span>, copied from the French artist J. Barbet and issued in the late 1660s from &#145;the flower pot in Fleete streete&#146;. This was followed by <span class="italic">A New Book of Architecture</span> and <span class="italic">A New Treatise of Architecture</span>, both translated by Pricke, from the works of Alexandre Francine and Julien Mauclerc respectively, and published in 1669 from Whitecross Street. At about the same date he married Abigail, and their first child, Robert, was born in 1670, although he seems not to have survived infancy. They had at least six further children: Dorothy (<i>b</i>. 1671), Elizabeth (1672&#150;1678), Abigail (<i>b</i>. 1673), Mary (<i>b</i>. 1676), Anne (<i>b</i>. 1678), and Robert (<i>b</i>. 1681).<br>
<br>By 1670 Pricke was also publishing from the &#145;Golden Lion at the corner of New Cheapside&#146;; between 1674 and 1676 he was to be found &#145;adjoining Cripple Gate within&#146;, and in 1677 he moved to the &#145;Golden Ball&#146; in St Paul's Churchyard. Throughout his life he followed his father's trade of salter (invariably given as his occupation in parish records), and publishing and bookselling were evidently sidelines. However, by 1679 he had issued a dozen books on art and architecture (often in his own translations from French or Dutch), as well as selling maps, games, and anatomical, satirical, and biblical prints, and carrying on a secondhand trade. Thereafter his printselling activity was virtually suspended for twenty years, although he republished Edward Cocker's <span class="italic">Penna volans</span> in 1685. During this period he succeeded his father as beadle of the Salters' Company. In the 1690s the Golden Ball address was used by the printseller and etcher Sutton Nicholls, and in 1695 Pricke, his wife, and his daughter Mary are recorded as Nicholls' lodgers. By 1696, however, Pricke was living &#145;against Aldermary Church in Bow Lane&#146;, and in 1698 he collaborated with Samuel and John Sprint in reissuing three of his books; in 1700 his last publication appeared, a reissue of <span class="italic">The Architect's Store-House</span> of 1674. He died in late 1708, and was buried at St Mary Aldermary on 10 November.<br>
