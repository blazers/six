<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ward,  (James) Rowland</span>  (1847&#150;1912), <span class="occ">taxidermist</span>, was born at 21 Edward Street, St Pancras, London, on 12 May 1847, the second son of (Edwin) Henry Ward (1812&#150;1878) and his wife, Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hunt. His family had a long association with natural history. His grandfather was a naturalist and dealer in animal skins and his father, who had accompanied J. J. Audubon in America, was chief taxidermist in the Oxford Street business of Thomas Mutlow Williams, himself a leading taxidermist who had exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851.<br>
<br>Henry Ward set up in 1857 as an independent taxidermist and it was here that Rowland Ward served his apprenticeship, along with his elder brother, Edwin, who later also became a leading taxidermist. Despite the existence of an autobiography little is known of Rowland Ward's early life. He had artistic talent and his early ambition was to become a sculptor; later he sold bronzes as a sideline to his taxidermy work, though these were unremarkable, and even a little crude. His observational talents applied to three-dimensional objects, and a facility with modelling compounds, nevertheless lay at the heart of his innovations in taxidermy, allowing him to obtain greater accuracy and lifelike appearance in his specimens. He claimed to have pioneered the application of a malleable modelling compound under the skin of large mammals, enabling the creation of folds and wrinkles in the skin, a much needed advance on traditional stuffing methods. Although this method was not new Ward demonstrated its value most effectively, adding quality and realism to the facial details of the many lions, tigers, and primates that he and his firm produced, setting a high standard for others to follow. He is credited with introducing the use of woodwool into taxidermy, and also carbolic (phenol).<br>
<br>About 1870 he set up in business independently, trading briefly as James Ward, then as Ward &amp; Co. From about 1879 he advertised increasingly as Rowland Ward &amp; Co and was incorporated as a limited company in 1890 to trade as &#145;taxidermists, naturalists, furrier, silversmith, bookseller and publisher&#146; from his showroom in Piccadilly.<br>
<br>Ward claimed to have originated the idea of setting up animals in natural groups. He put on dramatic displays at major national and international exhibitions, attracting valuable publicity, and also won many awards for quality and ingenuity. At the London International Exhibition of 1871 he displayed &#145;Combat of Red Deer&#146;. At a later exhibition he created a display of a tiger attacking an elephant, now in the natural history museum in Paris. He made a speciality of preserving and displaying famous animals, including the heads of a prize Smithfield shorthorn, a charger from the battle of Waterloo, the Grand National winner Cloister, as well as celebrated railway collecting dogs for orphans such as London Jack (1901) at Waterloo station and the Irish terrier Tim at Paddington. He was not afraid to work with pets and domestic animals, jobs that taxidermists undertake reluctantly. His examples of famous domestic dogs, submitted to the breed judges for approval before being added to the collection, were later displayed at the Rothschild Zoological Museum at Tring.<br>
<br>Although fundamentally an entrepreneur, Rowland Ward had a deep knowledge of natural history. He insisted on the importance of accurate measurements in taxidermy, and made careful studies of animal behaviour and habitats. He became a fellow of the Zoological Society of London in 1879, signing himself FZS thereafter on letters and trade labels. He also wrote frequently to <span class="italic">The Times</span> about aspects of natural history.<br>
<br>Rowland Ward travelled extensively in his bachelor days, having as his base an apartment above the Piccadilly showroom. During a period of ill health from 1882 he stayed for a number of years as a house guest at the Hertfordshire home of his friend the businessman and racehorse owner Sir John Blundell Maple. Ward married on 9 February 1893 Lina (1867&#150;1951), the daughter of John Mann Taylor; she was connected with the Maple family. They had no children. Evidently considerably wealthy, he and his wife briefly leased Stradsett Hall in Norfolk and then Necton Hall near Swaffham, where they entertained for the shooting season many well-known guests with sporting and artistic interests, including the big-game hunters Abel Chapman, F. C. Selous, and John Guille Millais, and such artists as Edwin Landseer. He was also a keen motorist and as early as 1902 he owned a 22 hp Daimler.<br>
<br>Ward's showroom was a meeting place for well-heeled and widely travelled men, and &#145;the Jungle&#146; in Piccadilly became a focus for zoological and sporting ventures. Among his customers was Philippe, duc d'Orl&eacute;ans, who is reckoned to have purchased more than 2500 items from Ward, amassing a large private museum that formed a major showcase of Wardian taxidermy from about 1889. Ward's advice was sought by those organizing hunting trips, including Theodore Roosevelt. The firm received a royal warrant in 1904. Mounting hunting trophies for sportsmen was the most lucrative part of his business: he received sixty rhinos from a single expedition and was commissioned to mount thirty lions shot by Lord Delamere. He developed a sideline in publishing high-quality books written by his hunting friends and customers and also published <span class="italic">The Sportsman's Handbook</span> (1881), a guide to hunting areas of the world and the proper treatment of trophies in the field. This ran to ten editions in his lifetime. His <span class="italic">Horn Measurements and Weights of the Great Game of the World</span> (1892) went through numerous subsequent editions as <span class="italic">Records of Big Game</span> (1896) and arose from his own interest in careful measurements of animals for taxidermy. He acted as an agent for many museums, and supplied them with specimens: in 1906 his firm prepared the British Museum of Natural History's first full-size wild African elephant and the first ever full-mount of an okapi. His products also included &#145;Wardian furniture&#146; in which animal parts were contorted to form chairs, umbrella stands, lamps, and inkwells.<br>
<br>Having suffered from heart disease for nine years, Ward died at his home, Restmore, Sea Road, Boscombe, Hampshire, on 28 December 1912, and was buried at Bournemouth cemetery. Among the bequests from his considerable estate was a legacy of &pound;5000 to be expended by his trustees for the purchase of specimens from his company which were to be presented to the British Museum (now the Natural History Museum, London), provided that the museum undertook to keep them on view in the public galleries. Many specimens were supplied in this way and the museum's own magazine described at least eighteen full-mount mammals that were donated between 1927 and 1936. After his widow's death in 1951 the remainder of the fund was expended to create the Rowland Ward pavilion in the Natural History Museum, comprising three dioramas of African mammals, the largest depicting an African waterhole. All three were dismantled in 2004. The taxidermy business continued after Ward's death until the 1970s, the company being formally wound up in 1983.<br>
