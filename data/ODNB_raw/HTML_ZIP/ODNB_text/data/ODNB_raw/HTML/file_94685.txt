<span class="headword">Fynn,  Henry Francis</span>  (1803&#150;1861), <span class="occ">mariner and settler in Natal</span>, was born in London on 29 March 1803, the son of (Henry) Francis Fynn (<i>d</i>. 1831), a shipowner originally from Donegal in Ireland who traded between the Dutch East Indies and Cape Colony, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Copestick. From 1806 his family lived in Cape Colony, leaving him in England for his education. He attended Christ's Hospital from 1809 to 1816 and worked as a surgeon's assistant in a London hospital from 1816 to 1818. In 1818 he joined his family at the Cape, where he made several attempts to obtain employment, eventually taking a post on the government farm which had been founded by Robert Hart in Somerset, Cape Colony, in 1814. This venture was forced to close in 1823, after which he took a job as supercargo aboard the vessel <i>Jane</i>, owned by the trader Henry Nourse, whose voyages up the east coast as far as Delagoa Bay were motivated by reports of ivory supplies.<br>
<br>Having gained some knowledge of the region, Fynn became a member of Francis Farewell's trading party which left Cape Town for Port Natal aboard the <i>Julia</i> in May 1824. Of the five men aboard the <i>Julia</i> only Fynn and Henry Ogle have been identified, the other participants being possibly mixed race or &#145;free black&#146; people from Cape Colony. Fynn's party was joined by Farewell's in July 1824, and Fynn followed Farewell's lead in recognizing Shaka ka Senzangakhoma (1787&#150;1828) as paramount chief and obtaining a supposed land grant for the area around Port Natal in August 1824. Fynn and other writers later claimed that Fynn had given Shaka medical assistance, but it is more likely that Shaka saw Fynn as simply a client with permission to collect some ivory for trading purposes. From 1825 Fynn made an attempt to establish an overland trade route via the Mpondo territory to Cape Colony and, together with two Cape coloured retainers, travelled as far as the Mzimbuvu River, in the process making contact with the Mpondo leader Faku. Fynn's Zulu name Mbuyazi has been interpreted as the &#145;long-tailed finch of the ridge&#146;, suggesting that Fynn, like the finch, moved quickly from place to place obtaining news.<br>
<br>Fynn, together with Farewell's employee John Cane, were later identified as individuals who had engaged in mercenary activity in the interior, against Shaka's rivals the Ndwandwe in 1826 and in the clash between colonial, Xhosa, Thembu, and Mpondo forces and a &#145;Zulu&#146; force at Mbolompo in 1828. Fynn and Henry Ogle were also later recorded as being European men who took indigenous wives. Fynn fathered twelve mixed-race children with four indigenous women. He attempted to retain some independence from the other settlers at Port Natal and by 1827 had established homesteads at Umzimkhulu. His <i>ensimbini</i> homestead consisted of himself, his first wife, Vundhlase of the Zelemu, several other women, their mixed race children, and some Cape &#145;coloured&#146; retainers who had accompanied Fynn and Farewell to Port Natal from Cape Colony. That his post lay to the south of Port Natal meant that Fynn was able to act as host to the earliest overland white travellers from Cape Colony. This he did in 1829 when Alexander Cowie and Benjamin Green visited him and in 1830 when John Burnet Biddulph and James Collis travelled to Port Natal. In 1829 Fynn was joined by his father and his brothers William (1806&#150;1853) and Frank (1808&#150;1840), who both hoped to profit from the ivory trade between Port Natal and Cape Colony. William returned to the Cape in 1831 following the death of his father, but Frank remained with his brother at <i>ensimbini</i>, eventually taking over the extended family of indigenous women and mixed-race children whom he cared for until his death in 1840.<br>
<br>Fynn left Natal in 1832 to pursue a conventional colonial career in Cape Colony and re-entered white society by marrying a white woman, Ann Brown, in 1837. She died in June 1839 and in 1841 Fynn married Christiana Brown (1821&#150;1870)&#151;unrelated to Ann&#151;with whom he had one child, Henry Francis Fynn [<i>see below</i>].<br>
<br>Fynn was diplomatic agent to the Mpondo leader Faku from March 1835 to March 1836, and resident agent with Maphasa of the Thembu from 1836 to 1846. Following the outbreak of war between Cape Colony and the Rharhabe under Sandile in alliance with Maphasa in 1846, Fynn's post was suspended and he was unemployed until April 1848. In May 1848 he was reappointed as diplomatic agent to Faku and moved to Buntingville. In February 1852, for reasons which remain obscure, he was suspended and was not paid until March 1854.<br>
<br>During 1852 Fynn returned to Natal as assistant resident magistrate for Pietermaritzburg. He was also unofficially recruited as an interpreter for Sir Benjamin Pine's land commission, which aimed to determine the number of African communities that could claim location land in Natal. In 1857 Fynn was also recruited by Theophilus Shepstone to go to Zululand to help form the policy of Cetshwayo ka Mpande, who had succeeded as ruler of the Zulu kingdom. Fynn retired from the Natal government service in 1859 to pursue his efforts to obtain a land grant which he claimed had been given to him by Shaka in the 1820s. By the time of his death at Durban on 20 September 1861 he had been unable to secure his claim, though his widow and their son Henry Francis were eventually awarded two plots of land in the Illovo district. Fynn was buried in West Pioneer Street cemetery, Durban.<br>
<br>On his arrival in Natal Bay, Fynn had begun to record his impressions of the settlement and the indigenous peoples with whom the settlers came into contact, with a view to producing a history, which was never published. His original notes were buried with his brother Frank in 1840, but he reconstructed them and expanded them. They came to represent the principal written source for the history of Natal and of Zululand between 1824 and 1834. His evidence to the Natal native affairs commission in 1852 contained important information on the peoples who occupied that territory. An edition of his fragmentary notes was eventually published in 1950.<br>
<br>His son <a name="cosubject_94685"></a><span class="headword">Henry Francis Fynn</span>  (1846&#150;1915), <span class="occ"></span>, sometimes known as Fynn junior, was born at Colesberg, Cape Colony, on 14 November 1846. He accompanied his parents to Natal in 1852 and his formal education ended with the death of his father in 1861. By 1864 he had acquired sufficient informal knowledge of the Zulu language to enter the Natal government service as clerk and interpreter to the resident magistrate in Newcastle. In 1865 he was transferred to the Upper Mkhomazi district where he was upgraded to the post of clerk of the court for Richmond. In 1870 he married a Yorkshire immigrant, Hannah Maria Payne; they had ten children, of whom seven survived infancy.<br>
<br>In 1873 Fynn was recruited by Theophilus Shepstone to accompany him to Zululand for the &#145;coronation&#146; of Cetshwayo. In 1876 Fynn was promoted to the post of resident magistrate at Msinga. He was perceived by colonial writers as having extensive knowledge of the Zulu language, customs, and institutions and his Zulu name Gwalagwala is taken from the Zulu name for the loerie bird, a feather of which he was accustomed to wear in his hat. He acted as interpreter for Sir Bartle Frere's ultimatum to the Zulu in December 1878 and then tried to secure the surrender of Gamdana ka Xongo, a half-brother of Sihayo. However, before he could do this Msinga became colonial defensive district no. 1 and Fynn became involved in the invasion preparations and was given an unofficial post as interpreter and political adviser to Lord Chelmsford. Fynn accompanied Chelmsford into Zululand but escaped the battle of Isandlwana on 22 January 1879 by accompanying Major Glynn's column to the relief of Major Dartnell.<br>
<br>Fynn returned to Msinga as resident magistrate until January 1883, when he was given the post of British resident to the restored Zulu monarch Cetshwayo over a portion of the former Zulu kingdom. In this position Fynn witnessed the events of the civil war in Zululand including the important battles of Msebe in March 1883 and Ondini in July 1883. In October 1883 he was responsible for taking the defeated Cetshwayo into British custody. In February 1884 Fynn returned to his post as resident magistrate at Msinga, a position he then held until his retirement in 1896. Fynn was interviewed as someone with authoritative knowledge of Zululand by James Stuart in 1906. Fynn died at Foxhill, Pietermaritzburg, Natal, on 30 April 1915, having given the manuscript of his diary, which covered the events of 1883, to his youngest daughter.<br>
