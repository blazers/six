<span class="headword">Okey,  Thomas</span>  (1852&#150;1935), <span class="occ">basket-maker and Italian scholar</span>, was born on 30 September 1852 at 16 Quaker Street, Spitalfields, London, one of eight children of Thomas Okey, a basket-maker, and his wife, Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Biggs. After elementary school in Bethnal Green, he too was apprenticed at thirteen as a basket-maker, a trade he followed for over thirty years. A passionate reader, he was largely self-taught, studying French, German, and Italian over breakfast before going to work at 6 a.m., and attending evening classes afterwards. He later attended classes at Toynbee Hall, and from 1888 onwards, on his own initiative, organized educational trips to Italy for East End adult learners. In 1896 he ceased basket-making and became a full-time adult education teacher, principally at Toynbee Hall (from 1892 to 1901). On 8 June 1901 he married Amy Louisa Rye of Chiswick, a widow a year older than him; she was the daughter of Joseph Haslam, a silk mercer. There were no children from the marriage.<br>
<br>Okey's initial publications were translations: Mazzini's <span class="italic">Essays</span> (1894), a clear hint of his convictions, and in the same year <span class="italic">The Little Flowers of St Francis of Assisi</span>, which eventually ran to over a dozen editions. A translation of Dante's <span class="italic">Purgatorio</span> for Temple Classics (1899) was followed by an English edition of the same author's <span class="italic">Vita nuova</span> and lyric poetry (1906). His first major original work, <span class="italic">Italy Today</span> (1901 and 1909), was written in collaboration with the influential Risorgimento historian Bolton King. Benedetto Croce later chose it as the first work to be translated and published by the new Laterza publishing house, and in Italy it is still quoted in political debate about the southern question. Further collaboration with Bolton King appeared in volume 12 of the <span class="roman">Cambridge Modern History</span> (1910). Sole-authored books on Venice, <span class="italic">Venice and its Story</span> (1903), <span class="italic">The Story of Venice</span> (1905), <span class="italic">The Old Venetian Palaces and Old Venetian Folk</span> (1907), alternated with books of French interest, <span class="italic">Paris and its Story</span> (1904), <span class="italic">The Story of Paris</span> (1906), and <span class="italic">The Story of Avignon</span> (1911). Basket-making was not abandoned, however, for in 1912 Okey wrote <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Art of Basket-Making</span>, which is still in print and recommended by enthusiasts, even over the internet. He also compiled the entry on the craft for the eleventh edition of <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. During the First World War Okey was employed at the Foreign Office, where his knowledge of French and Italian was useful.<br>
<br>At sixty-seven, and recently widowed, Okey was surprised to be called to the Serena chair of Italian at Cambridge in 1919, as the first incumbent, despite his complete lack of formal qualifications. He fitted in easily, however, helped by welcoming and sympathetic colleagues. Elected a fellow of Gonville and Caius College in 1920, he acquired a reputation as a fine lecturer, placing a special, almost reverent, emphasis in his teaching on the works of Dante. In 1922, the same year as the march on Rome, he represented Cambridge University at the anniversary of the founding of the University of Padua, and there received an honorary doctorate, the only academic accolade to accompany his recognition as an honorary freeman in the Worshipful Company of Basket-Makers. His Mazzinian convictions, however, made him increasingly uneasy at the rise of fascism. He retired from the Serena chair in 1928 for reasons of advanced age and failing health (after a stroke he complained eloquently in a private letter of &#145;aphasia in five languages&#146;), and returned once more to basket-making, publishing his short autobiography, <span class="italic">A Basketful of Memories</span>, in 1930. In the year before he died he made a final pair of waste-paper baskets for friends at Jesus College, comparing them cruelly with handiwork much earlier in his career (a pre-war basket had constituted a special illustration for the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>). Along with a photograph of an octogenarian Okey engaged in his craft, one of these late baskets passed in 1981 into the hands of a subsequent chair-holder, Professor Patrick Boyde, almost as the insignia of office. Okey died on 4 May 1935 at his home, Barnwood, Brasted, Sevenoaks, Kent, of a cerebral thrombosis. His reputation today rests largely on his work as a timely popularizer of Italian culture and his main significance lies in his belonging to that transitional generation which, from an insecure academic base, saw to the establishment of Italian studies as a coherent discipline in British universities.<br>
