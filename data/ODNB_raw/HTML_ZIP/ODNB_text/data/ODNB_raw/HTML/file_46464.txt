<span class="headword">Gennari,  Benedetto</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1633, <em>d.</em> 1715), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was baptized in the parish of S. Biagio, at Cento in Emilia-Romagna, Papal States, on 19 October 1633. His father, Ercole Gennari (1597&#150;1658), and grandfather were also painters, and his mother, Lucia Barbieri, was a sister of Guercino. In 1643 the family moved to Bologna, where Guercino was already established and where Gennari received his early training from his father and his uncle; his early paintings clearly show the latter's influence. He remained in Bologna until the age of thirty-eight, producing portraits for some of the noble families and religious works for the local churches and convents.<br>
<br>From April 1672 to September 1674 Gennari lived in Paris where his connection with Guercino secured him a favourable reception. (During this time he began to keep a complete list of all his pictures.) He then moved to England, where James, duke of York, had recently married an Italian princess, Mary of Modena. The duchess and her husband became Gennari's most important patrons, but his first important commission was from Catherine of Braganza, who asked him to produce new paintings for the Queen's Chapel at St James's Palace in 1675.<br>
<br>Gennari lived in England for over fourteen years and produced a total of 138 pictures, divided roughly equally between portraits, religious works, and profane subjects. Most of his pictures were commissioned by members of the royal family, though he was also employed by various Portuguese and Italian courtiers and a small group of ministers and household officials. His most important commissions were from Charles II, for whom he provided mythologies for the new apartments at Windsor Castle, and James II, for whom he decorated the new Catholic chapel at Whitehall in 1686&#150;7. Gennari never held an official court appointment, but he seems to have been informally given the position of first painter by the duke of York, an arrangement that continued when the duke succeeded as James II in February 1685.<br>
<br>The revolution of 1688 brought an end to Gennari's career in England. His position was perhaps eased during the crisis itself because, exceptionally, he was working at the time on two pictures for a leading whig, the earl of Devonshire. Once they had been finished, he left the country on 28 January 1689 and never returned. This was not the end of his connection with England, however, because he joined the Jacobite court in exile at St Germain-en-Laye in February 1689, and continued to enjoy the protection of Mary of Modena for a further three years, employed almost exclusively on portraits, which comprise twenty-six of the thirty-two pictures included in his list. Gennari is the only artist to have left us with a visual record of the Stuart court both at Whitehall and in exile.<br>
<br>Gennari returned to Italy in the spring of 1692, when James II was preparing to invade England. He probably had no desire to resume his work in London in the event of a restoration and saw little prospect of obtaining commissions in France outside the Jacobite court. Before he left, he was finally granted a formal warrant by James II acknowledging him as his first painter; the warrant was renewed by his son James Stuart in December 1701. Gennari remained in Bologna for the rest of his life. He continued to be prolific and finally stopped painting at the age of seventy-six in 1709. The following year he became a founding member of the Accademia Clementina and devoted himself to teaching, being nominated direttore della scuola de nudo. He died at home in the via S. Al&ograve;, Bologna, on 19 December 1715 and was buried in the church of S. Nicol&ograve; degli Albari, Bologna.<br>
<br>Gennari was content to work within the tradition established by Guercino, of whose drawings he possessed over two and a half thousand. His style is easily recognizable, in part because of the monumentalism of his figures. But he was also influenced by the paintings of Pierre Mignard and incorporated some of the latter's grace and softness into his works. About a quarter of the pictures that he produced in London and St Germain have survived, most notably in the Royal Collection at Hampton Court. Gennari worked for a restricted number of patrons and was overshadowed as a court portraitist by Godfrey Kneller, but he was a more versatile painter. It is unfortunate that the fall of James II not only abruptly terminated his career in England but also led to the destruction of the Catholic chapels in London that he had decorated.<br>
