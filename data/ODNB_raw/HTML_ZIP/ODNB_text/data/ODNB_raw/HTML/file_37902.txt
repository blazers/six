<span class="headword">Robertson,  (William) Strowan Amherst</span>  (1894&#150;1955), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and Franciscan friar</span>, was born at Redlands, The Common, Ealing, Middlesex, on 16 October 1894, the elder of the two children of William Robertson (1853/4&#150;1925), a jeweller, and his wife, Lucy Ann Amherst (1871&#150;1957). He had one brother, Charles. Although small and delicate from birth, Robertson revealed early in life a strong will, offset by a winning charm and courtesy, which marked him out as a leader and organizer. Educated at Westminster School and at Queens' College, Cambridge, where he took a third-class degree in history in 1916, he was ever at the centre of a circle of friends and activities. He was nicknamed Algy, a name by which he was generally known for the rest of his life. Brought up as a Congregationalist, his attraction to a more catholic expression of Christianity led him to become an Anglican. However, he never forgot his nonconformist roots and he combined throughout his life the best of the catholic and evangelical traditions.<br>
<br>In 1917, being unfit for military service, Robertson accepted a post lecturing in history and English literature at St Paul's College, Calcutta. Here, he manifested his considerable teaching abilities. He was deeply moved by India, by both its cultural richness and its material poverty, and was determined to return. After three years, he left to train for ordination at Westcott House, Cambridge. Ordained deacon in 1921, priest in 1922, he served a curacy at St George's, Cullercoats, near Newcastle, and then spent three years as a travelling secretary for the Student Christian Movement, promoting ecumenism among ordinands. In 1927 he returned to India to be a novice in the Christa Seva Sangha (CSS), a multiracial Franciscan community, founded at Poona in 1922. Robertson absorbed himself in the life of the CSS <i>ashram</i>, founding a hostel for university students, but his health was unable to cope with the climate and he returned home. It was therefore in England in 1931 that he was professed as a friar.<br>
<br>Accepting the living of St Ives, Huntingdonshire, Robertson made the vicarage into a branch house of CSS. Far away from the decision-making centre of the Sangha, he spent the 1930s forging links with other small Franciscan communities in Britain. It was his vision and drive which was primarily behind these groups coming together to found one united order, the Society of St Francis (SSF). He was consequently life professed in SSF in 1937 rather than the Sangha.<br>
<br>One of the brotherhoods in the union had a friary at Hilfield in Dorset as the centre for its ministry to the poor, particularly wayfarers. Robertson moved there and reorganized the varied groups of brothers into one community, adding evangelism and retreat-giving to the social work of the friars. While maintaining the discipline of religious life, he intentionally fostered a warm and open atmosphere in the society, stressing in particular his vision of &#145;sacramental friendship&#146; as being at the heart of community life, without which he believed no collective ministry could prosper. Robertson therefore developed the traditions of Anglican religious life away from the more austere models favoured by other men's communities.<br>
<br>Robertson's own outwardly disorganized life, characterized by a habitual lateness for appointments, masked a keen judgement of events and people. His skills in listening made him respected as a spiritual director. He was in great demand as a preacher and missioner, and was a member of the Church of England's commission on evangelism. Yet it was his establishment of SSF as a coherent and successful religious order during the years 1937&#150;55 which was his lasting achievement. In the decades after his death, SSF grew to be the largest of all men's communities in the Anglican communion. He also had a significant role in the founding of both a Franciscan third order and a contemplative community for women, the Community of St Clare, at Freeland, Oxfordshire. Soon after a diagnosis of inoperable cancer of the liver, he died of pneumonia in the Gordon Hospital, Westminster, aged sixty-one, on 23 November 1955. His funeral service took place at St Matthew's, Westminster, and his ashes were interred at Hilfield Friary on 29 November.<br>
