<span class="headword">Wetherall, Sir  George Augustus</span>  (1788&#150;1868), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29144/', "General Sir Frederick Augustus Wetherall (1754&#150;1842)")</script> and his first wife, Elizabeth Mytton (<i>d</i>. 1810). He was educated at Hyde Abbey School, Winchester, and the Army College, Farnham, being already commissioned, aged seven, as lieutenant in the 7th (Royal Fusiliers) on 29 July 1795. In 1798 he was placed on half pay, but on 9 July 1803 began active service, joining the regiment of Nova Scotia fencibles formed by his father. Hitherto his name had been erroneously in the army list as F. Augustus, but the seniority given to him marks his identity. He became captain on 13 May 1805, and exchanged to the 1st (Royals) on 27 November 1806.<br>
<br>Wetherall was brigade major under his father at the Cape in 1809, was taken prisoner with him while sailing to India in 1810 (they were released in an exchange of prisoners after two months), and served as his aide-de-camp in the conquest of Java in 1811. He was made brevet major on 12 August 1819, and regimental major on 30 December. He was military secretary to the commander-in-chief at Madras from 1822 to 1825, and deputy judge-advocate-general in 1826. On 11 December 1824 he was made brevet lieutenant-colonel, and on 7 August 1828 lieutenant-colonel of the Royals. He commanded the 2nd battalion of the regiment at Bangalore, in the Madras presidency, brought it home in 1831, and went with it to Canada in 1836. He was in command of the troops at Montreal when the insurrection broke out in the autumn of 1837. On 25 November, at the head of four companies of the Royals, a detachment of the 66th, and a troop of Montreal cavalry, with two six-pounders, he stormed a stockade held by Thomas Storrow Brown and other insurgents at St Charles who had refused to negotiate. His horse was shot and he lost twenty-one men. On 15 December, at the head of a brigade consisting of the Royals and some colonial troops, he and his son <a href="#cosubject_29143">Edward [<i>see below</i>]</a> took part in the action of St Eustache under Sir John Colborne. He had received the Hanoverian order (KH) in 1833, and was made CB on 13 June 1838, brevet colonel on 28 June, and aide-de-camp to the queen on 29 July 1842.<br>
<br>Wetherall left the Royals on 14 July 1843, being appointed deputy adjutant-general at Montreal. In June 1850 he was given a post at the War Office in London. He was promoted major-general on 11 November 1851, and was appointed adjutant-general on 1 December 1854. From 1860 to 1865 he commanded the northern district of England, and on 21 August 1866 was appointed governor of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He had been given the colonelcy of the 84th foot on 15 June 1854, and had become lieutenant-general on 8 September 1857 and general on 23 October 1863. He was made KCB on 5 February 1856, and received the grand cross on 28 March 1865.<br>
<br>Wetherall was an exceptional soldier and one of the few officers who served in North America to proceed to significant posts in the United Kingdom.<br>
<br>He died at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, on 8 April 1868, aged eighty. In 1812 he had married Frances Diana, daughter of Captain Denton of the East India Company's service. Their only son, <a name="cosubject_29143"></a><span class="headword">Sir Edward Robert Wetherall</span>  (1815&#150;1869), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, entered the army on 27 June 1834, as ensign in his father's regiment, the 1st (Royals). He became lieutenant on 22 August 1837, and served in the Canadian uprising. He distinguished himself in the attack on St Eustache. Promoted captain on 19 December 1845, he transferred to the Scots Fusilier Guards on 15 July 1854. He served in the Crimea, as assistant quartermaster-general, until the fall of Sevastopol, and was the guide of the cavalry in the flank march to Balaklava. He was made brevet major on 12 December 1854 and brevet lieutenant-colonel on 17 July 1855. He was afterwards deputy quartermaster-general to the Turkish contingent at Kerch, and director-general of land transport (which he reorganized) in the Crimea. He received the medal with four clasps, CB, L&eacute;gion d'honneur (fifth class), Mejidiye (third class), and Turkish medal. On 11 December 1855 he was made aide-de-camp to the queen, and colonel.<br>
<br>Wetherall was appointed deputy quartermaster-general to the forces in China in 1857, but was employed in India, owing to the outbreak of the mutiny. He was chief of the staff of the central India field force under Sir Hugh Henry Rose, and was present at the storming of Kunch and the battle of Gulauli, 22 May 1858, in which his horse was shot. He afterwards commanded a field force in south Oudh, as brigadier, and on 3 November stormed the fort of Rampur Kussia, taking twenty-three guns. He lost seventy-eight men, and Sir Colin Campbell was &#145;much put out&#146; that he had not waited for Sir Hope Grant, as had been arranged. Even so, he received the medal and clasp, and was given an unattached lieutenant-colonelcy for his services in central India.<br>
<br>Wetherall was appointed deputy quartermaster-general to the forces in Ireland on 28 January 1859, and was rewarded for distinguished service on 20 December 1861. On 28 April 1865 he was made deputy quartermaster-general at headquarters, and in 1868 he succeeded Sir Thomas Larcom as under-secretary in Ireland. He was made KCSI on 16 September 1867, and promoted major-general on 8 March 1869. On 26 January 1847 Wetherall married Katherine, daughter of John Durie of Astley Hall, Lancashire. He died suddenly at his home, Ashtown Lodge, Phoenix Park, Dublin, on 11 May 1869, having already won &#145;the cordial respect of all with whom he had official intercourse&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). He was survived by his wife, three sons, and three daughters.<br>
