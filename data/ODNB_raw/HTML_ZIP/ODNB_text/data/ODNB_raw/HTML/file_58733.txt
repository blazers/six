<span class="headword">Barke,  James William</span>  (1905&#150;1958), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 22 May 1905 at Torwoodlee, near Galashiels, Selkirkshire, the fourth child of James Bark (1862&#150;1937), dairyman, and his wife, Jane (<i>b</i>. 1866), a dairymaid, daughter of Thomas Gibb, ploughman. The family moved in 1907 to Tulliallan, Fife, which Barke, remembering his happy rural childhood, considered to be in effect &#145;the land of my birth&#146;  (Barke, 279). In 1918 they moved again, to Glasgow. Barke was educated at Tulliallan parish school and Hamilton Crescent public school, Glasgow. He trained as an engineer and worked for a Glasgow shipbuilding and engineering firm, becoming manager of its brickworks, while beginning his writing career. His first novel, <span class="italic">The World his Pillow</span>, was published in 1933. The same year he married Agnes (Nan) Coats and they had two sons.<br>
<br>Barke listed his interests as &#145;Scotland, <i>piobaireachd</i> [bagpipe music] and anything controversial&#146;  (<span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>, 21 March 1958). A friend wrote: &#145;He was a man full of humanity, a very individual man. His novels are like him&#146;  (Allan). He was a committed socialist and his fourth novel, <span class="italic">Major Operation</span> (1936), argues the case for socialism at some length, while providing a striking impressionistic description of Glasgow in the depression years. <span class="italic">The Land of the Leal</span> (1939), considered his masterpiece, is a novel on an epic scale, the odyssey of a couple and their family in pursuit of work from their native Galloway to the Scottish borders, Fife, and Glasgow, echoing the experiences of Barke's parents.<br>
<br>After the Second World War, Barke resigned from his Glasgow job and moved to Ayrshire to work on an ambitious series of novels based on the life of Robert Burns. The <span class="roman">Immortal Memory</span> quintet, which appeared between 1946 and 1953, was extremely popular with readers, but was attacked by many Burnsians who deplored Barke's colourful rendering of the poet's life.<br>
<br>After an unsuccessful hotelkeeping venture in Ayrshire Barke returned to live in Glasgow in 1955. He had been in poor health for some years and died, following a heart attack, in Glasgow Royal Infirmary on 20 March 1958. A private cremation four days later was followed by committal at New Kilpatrick cemetery, Bearsden, where C. M. Grieve (the poet Hugh MacDiarmid) gave the funeral oration. Barke was survived by his wife.<br>
