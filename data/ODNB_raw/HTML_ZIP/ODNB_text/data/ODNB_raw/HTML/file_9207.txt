<span class="headword">Faulkner,  Benjamin Rawlinson</span>  (1787&#150;1849), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born at Manchester, Lancashire, and baptized there at St Ann's Church on 17 January 1787, the son of William Faulkner and his wife, Elizabeth. His early career was in commerce, spending several years representing a firm at Gibraltar. When an epidemic of the plague hit Gibraltar, Faulkner became seriously ill and returned to England about 1813. During convalescence, aged twenty-five, he turned to drawing, encouraged by his elder brother, the artist <a href="#cosubject_9207">Joshua Wilson Faulkner [<i>see below</i>]</a>. After practising art, which included at least two years drawing from the antique, Faulkner moved to London about 1816. He lived at Hatton Garden, then in the 1830s and 1840s in Newman Street, Soho, a centre for artists at that time. In spite of being known at Manchester for his portraits of worthy local men such as Robert Hindley (City Art Gallery, Manchester) and William Nield (Art Gallery and Museum, Salford), Faulkner's quiet nature could be taken for diffidence and this worked against him in London. However, he exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy from 1821 until 1848 (Graves records his work as being exhibited there until 1859); his paintings of women were particularly noted and he gained respect for his portraits. He also exhibited at the British Institution and the Society of British Artists, as well as the Royal Manchester Institution and the Liverpool Academy.<br>
<br>Faulkner's portraits of John Dalton FRS (1841), Sir William Fairbairn, engineer, and the geologist John MacCulloch are at the Royal Society, London, and a portrait of John George Children (1826), secretary of the Royal Society, is at the National Portrait Gallery, London. Three of his portraits of bishops are at Christ Church, Oxford, that of George Murray, bishop of Rochester (exh. RA, 1829) being, perhaps, the most distinguished. A portrait of Isaac Crewdson (1840; priv. coll.) bears Faulkner's monogram. Faulkner painted four portraits of Sir John Ross, the Arctic explorer; three are after the portrait by James Green (1833; NPG) and one of these is at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh. Painted before the age of photography and without swagger, Faulkner's portraits are usually half or three-quarter lengths, showing the sitter in clerical robes or military uniform or seated at a desk, defining the sitter's claim to fame. Good collections of engravings after his portraits are at the British Museum, London, and the City Art Gallery, Manchester. In his genre works the period is evoked with titles such as <span class="italic">Spare a Halfpenny</span> and <span class="italic">Maternal Affection</span>. Engravings after Faulkner can be found as illustrations to Sir Walter Scott's novels.<br>
<br>Faulkner died at his home, 7 Rosa Villas (later Lillie Road), Fulham, London on 29 October 1849. Besides painting, Faulkner was an accomplished musician and was for a time organist at the Caledonian Chapel in Hatton Garden when Edward Irving was minister.<br>

<a name="cosubject_9207"></a><span class="headword">Joshua Wilson Faulkner</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1783&#150;<em>d.</em> 1874), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was Faulkner's elder brother. He was baptized at St Ann's, Manchester, on 28 February 1783. He is remembered chiefly for his miniature portraits of officers. He was a member of the Liverpool Academy, where he exhibited; he also exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1809 to 1820, and settled in London in 1816 or 1817. On 29 November 1819, at St Marylebone, London, he married Elizabeth Susanna Jones (<i>b</i>. 1782/3&#150;1864), the daughter of John Burnett Jones and Elizabeth Susannah Estwick, both of whom were from wealthy Barbados families. The couple had two children, Henry Dernberg (1823/4&#150;1870) and Edrica (1821/2&#150;1890), and subsequently lived in Italy, before returning to Brasted, Kent, by the early 1850s. The British Museum has an engraving by S. Freeman after J. W. Faulkner of the actor Charles Mayne Young. He was described by the art critic William Carey as &#145;a miniature painter of reputation&#146;  (Fawcett, 176). He died at his home, The Phillipines, Brasted, near Sevenoaks, Kent, on 5 October 1874.<br>
