<span class="headword">Blundell,  Peter</span>  (<em>c.</em>1520&#150;1601), <span class="occ">clothier and philanthropist</span>, was born in Tiverton, Devon, of humble parentage. As a boy he saw the little community freed from the dominance of the Courtenay earls of Devon, and he lived to see it, untrammelled by either civic or industrial regulation, and somewhat encouraged by the protestant ethic, enter a period of considerable growth and prosperity based on the manufacture of kerseys, the woollen cloths in which the town and its immediate hinterland specialized. Whether the young Blundell himself learned any of the necessary industrial skills is not apparent. He was essentially an industrial entrepreneur&#151;still a rarity in late sixteenth-century Devon&#151;but it was his ability to find a market in London for the lightweight and inexpensive west-country product that enabled him to prosper so exceedingly. There is no evidence that he was ever a freeman of the City of London or a member of any of its guilds, but when he made his will in 1599 he left &pound;150 to each of the twelve great livery companies, part of the income of which was to be given to poor inmates of the city's various penal institutions. He left more sizeable sums to each of the three great London hospitals (St Bartholomew's, St Thomas's, and Christ's Hospital) and to some of his London business friends. Ann Whitmore, a merchant's widow living in the parish of St Michael Paternoster Royal, was generously provided for by the elderly bachelor, as were each of her nine children (one of them a future lord mayor) and several of her servants, suggesting that Blundell had lodged with the family when he was in London; and indeed it was in this parish that he was assessed for tax in 1581. It was on no less a person than his friend Sir John Popham, the lord chief justice and a fellow west-countryman, that he placed the main burden of carrying out his multifarious wishes.<br>
<br>The bulk of Blundell's considerable fortune went to a wide circle of fellow clothiers, their widows and children, many of them also his relations, in and around Tiverton, with a few in the city of Exeter. His many employees also benefited&#151;even his carrier, William Wood, receiving &pound;50. His only brother, James, having predeceased him, his heir presumptive was his nephew John, who, with his infant son Peter, received rather less than another nephew, Robert Chilcott, his clerk. Blundell's residuary legatees were the five men he named as his executors, two of them London merchants and the other three Tiverton cousins. He created several charitable trusts, including one enabling four Tiverton boys a year under the age of fifteen to be apprenticed to husbandry&#151;a new idea in 1599, reflecting Blundell's appreciation of the need for a healthy rural economy. Others to benefit were the ten inhabitants of Tiverton most heavily assessed for the subsidy. In all, Blundell provided for cash disposals amounting to the amazing sum of over &pound;32,000. This included &pound;2400 to build premises for what was to be his lasting memorial, a free grammar school in Tiverton, the running costs to be met from his estate. His extraordinary will, which he claimed to have written in his own hand, contained the most detailed particulars regarding the school's construction, the choice of pupils, and the provision of staff. Finally, for the increase of preachers of the gospel, he provided scholarships to support six former pupils at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. Blundell died, possibly on 18 April 1601, in the London parish of St Michael Paternoster Royal, his second home. The parish register for 9 May 1601 lists the burial of &#145;P er Blunden&#146;, but this may be a copyist's error.<br>
