<span class="headword">Sidney,  William Philip</span>, first Viscount de L'Isle  (1909&#150;1991), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born on 23 May 1909 in Chelsea, London, the only son of William Sidney, fifth Baron de L'Isle and Dudley (1859&#150;1945), barrister and politician, and his wife, Winifred Agneta Yorke, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bevan (<i>d</i>. 1959), elder daughter of Roland Yorke Bevan. He had an older sister, Mary Olivia (1906&#150;1959). His father, the fourth son of the second Baron de L'Isle, was mayor of Chelsea in 1906&#150;8, and a Conservative member of the London county council from 1922 to 1934; he acceded only briefly to the barony, two months before his death.<br>
<br>Bill Sidney was educated at Eton College and at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he devoted himself more to sports and the Officers' Training Corps than to academia. In 1929, from Cambridge, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the supplementary reserve of the Grenadier Guards. During the next nine years he worked hard in the City of London where, in gaining valuable business experience, he qualified as a chartered accountant. At the same time he helped his father to nurse his extensive estates at Penshurst Place near Tonbridge, Kent, and at Inglesby Manor, Great Ayton, Yorkshire. In the process he became an enthusiastic countryman.<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Sidney, by now a captain, joined his regiment and served with the British expeditionary force in France until, in May 1940, he returned home from the beaches of Dunkirk with his commanding officer, General Sir Harold Alexander; he was among the last to leave under heavy German air attack. Back in London, he married on 8 June 1940 Jacqueline Corinne Yvonne Vereker (1914&#150;1962), the only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36642/', "John Standish Surtees Prendergast Vereker, sixth Viscount Gort VC")</script>, who had been his commander-in-chief throughout the battle of France. They had four daughters and a son.<br>
<br>After various postings and intensive commando training in England, Sidney was promoted major and served in north Africa. On 22 January 1944, as a company commander with the 5th battalion, Grenadier Guards, he landed on the Anzio beachhead in Italy with the British Sixth Army corps, led again by General Alexander. At first almost unopposed, the British force was rapidly challenged by greatly superior German numbers, strongly supported by the <i>Luftwaffe</i>. In fierce fighting at Carrocento throughout the night of 7&#150;8 February 1944, Sidney, in command of a support company of a battalion of the Grenadier Guards, led a counter-attack with hand grenades at the head of the crew of a 3 inch mortar. His citation for the Victoria Cross read:<blockquote>Dashing forward with superb courage and utter disregard for danger he was wounded in the face by a German grenade which killed the grenadier at his side. Though further wounded in the thigh, Sidney sent back the remainder of his company to bring up more ammunition and grenades while, virtually single-handed and at point-blank range, he kept the enemy at bay with his tommy gun, driving them back with many casualties until the ammunition-party returned to continue the fierce fighting for another hour. Only then, gravely wounded and weak from loss of blood, did he allow himself to be assisted so that his wounds could be dressed. There is no doubt that, as a result of his action, in the face of great odds, the battalion's position was re-established with far-reaching consequences on the battle as a whole.</blockquote>Invalided out of the army, and while still suffering from his wounds, Sidney received the Victoria Cross from George V at Buckingham Palace on 12 October 1944; it was accompanied by a piece of VC ribbon cut from Lord Gort's tunic. Two days later, transferred to the regular army reserve for parliamentary duties, Sidney was returned, unopposed, as the Conservative member of parliament for his birthplace, Chelsea, in succession to Sir Samuel Hoare, who had become Lord Templewood in Winston Churchill's administration. Shortly thereafter, as parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Pensions, and now beginning to climb the political ladder, Sidney was selected to deliver his maiden speech during his first month in the House of Commons, in reply to the king's speech to Parliament. In &#145;ringing phrases&#146; he gave a much praised, authoritative comment on the state of the war.<br>
<br>Sidney's time in the House of Commons was, however, short. The death of his father on 18 June 1945 took him to the House of Lords. There followed, on 26 July 1945, the general election which brought Clement Attlee's Labour government to power for the next six and a half years. During that time de L'Isle worked in the City of London, was appointed joint treasurer of the Conservative Party, and maintained and improved his historic country seat and gardens, at Penshurst Place, which held a special nostalgia for him as the home of his forebear, Sir Philip Sidney, the gallant Elizabethan poet, diplomat, courtier, and embodiment of chivalry. De L'Isle especially enjoyed showing visitors the remarkable collection of arms and armour in the crypt, the oak-panelled long gallery, the Elizabethan gardens, and the beautiful lake, first mentioned in family records more than 500 years before. At this time also he forged his first contacts with aviation through the Air Ministry's continuously open and lighted Penshurst landing ground at Chiddingstone Causeway on the top of the North Downs; with its telephone link to Croydon airport and an automatic wind indicator, Penshurst began to be used frequently by private flyers, who enjoyed the hospitality extended whenever he was at home by de L'Isle himself.<br>
<br>When on 26 October 1951 a Conservative government under Sir Winston Churchill returned to power with a slim majority, de L'Isle was appointed secretary of state for air, to his special delight and outstanding success. He quickly displayed an enthusiasm for the service which won the unstinted regard of senior officers and all other ranks. He showed his determination for practical involvement by learning to fly at the Royal Air Force Central Flying School, also setting an example by becoming the first air minister to fly by both day and night&#151;and the first to fly a jet aircraft (a Canberra). During his fifty active months as secretary of state for air, the Royal Air Force was more than doubled in strength, from less than 125,000 personnel in 1951 to more than 269,000 in 1955. At a time of rapid technical development, not only did the RAF capture the world's air-speed record at more than 727 m.p.h., but also the first V-bombers were brought into service in the form of the Vickers Valiant in January 1955, followed by the further advanced Avro Vulcan and Handley Page Victor. De L'Isle's term at the Air Ministry also saw a major advance in the equipment of the RAF in helicopters and guided weapons.<br>
<br>De L'Isle worked closely and cordially with Sir William Dickson, chief of the air staff, and then with his successor, Sir John Slesser. Throughout his time at the Air Ministry he was seen by the RAF as one of the most effective and respected of air ministers, devoted to the service in the mould of Lord Trenchard. With his quiet but immensely competent interest in every aspect of the service, he was highly regarded by all ranks wherever his duties took him. His private secretary wrote:<blockquote>Numerous visits to Harwell, Windscale, Aldermaston and the major factories of the aircraft industry registered his concern. Yet one's abiding impression, however serious the subject, was that laughter and immense enjoyment of the human comedy were never far away. To be with him, in the office or outside, was much more a pleasure than a duty. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 April 1991)</blockquote>In August 1952 de L'Isle made an 8000 mile tour of inspection of RAF establishments in the Middle East. He had proposed to continue to Singapore, Hong Kong, and on to the United States and Canada. These plans were, however, turned down by the prime minister who, despite his own worldwide overseas visits, wrote to de L'Isle: &#145;The power of a Secretary of State is best wielded from his desk&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 April 1991).<br>
<br>When Anthony Eden succeeded Winston Churchill as prime minister in April 1955, he decided that his secretary of state for air must be responsible to the House of Commons. Loyally, but reluctantly, de L'Isle accepted his replacement by his well-trained parliamentary secretary, Nigel Birch. De L'Isle left the Air Ministry in December 1955. In January 1956 he was made a viscount, dropping from his title the term &#145;and Dudley&#146;, recalling with amusement that at a lunch at the United States headquarters in Ruislip, Middlesex, two places had been laid for him&#151;one on each side of the chairman.<br>
<br>In August 1961 de L'Isle was welcomed by the Australian prime minister, Robert Menzies, to be governor-general of Australia, the last Englishman to hold that post. At once de L'Isle disarmed any incipient criticism by his courtesy and by the informality of his presence, his delightful sense of humour, and by the extent of his local knowledge. He reinforced his regard for Australia by purchasing two properties in New South Wales and by setting up a local company to tend them. He was appointed GCMG in 1961 and GCVO in 1962. In November 1962 his wife died.<br>
<br>After four well-regarded years in Australia, de L'Isle returned to England in September 1965. He married on 24 March 1966 Margaret Eldrydd, Lady Glanusk, daughter of Major-General Thomas Herbert Shoubridge, and widow of Wilfrid Russell Bailey, third Baron Glanusk. With his second wife de L'Isle delighted once more in his historic seat at Penshurst Place, and again extended hospitality and personally conducted inspections to visitors to Penshurst. His cheerful company in the family home, together with his courteous, relaxed, and enthusiastic presence, was much valued, and he was always calm, considerate, and the essence of courtesy. At the same time his business acumen began to be much sought after. He was chairman of Phoenix Assurance and Parmerston Property Development, and a director of the British Match Corporation, Lloyds Bank, the Yorkshire Bank, and Schweppes. He was a trustee of the RAF Museum, the Churchill Memorial Trust (1975&#150;91), the British Museum (1950&#150;64), and the National Portrait Gallery (1965&#150;72), and from 1968 to 1984 he was chancellor of the Order of St Michael and St George. He was appointed KG in 1968. His concern for human rights was displayed by his chairmanship and then presidency of the Freedom Association.<br>
<br>De L'Isle, &#145;a brave and distinguished nobleman&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 13 April 1991), died at Penshurst Place on 5 April 1991. He was survived by his second wife and the five children of his first marriage. He was succeeded as second viscount by his son, Major Philip John Algernon Sidney (<i>b</i>. 1945). A memorial service was held in the Guards' Chapel, Wellington Barracks, London, on 23 May 1991.<br>
