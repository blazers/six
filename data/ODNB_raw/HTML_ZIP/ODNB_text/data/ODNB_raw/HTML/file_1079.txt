<span class="headword">Baily,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1527&#150;1591), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and college head</span>, was born in Yorkshire. On 3 June 1543, in his sixteenth year, he entered Clare College, Cambridge, as a scholar. He graduated BA in 1546. Wardale's <span class="italic">Clare College</span> says that the master and fellows of Clare resisted the king's wishes in 1549: &#145;In no college of the university can the flames of religious faction have blazed more fiercely than they did in Clare Hall.&#146; John Maden, master 1549&#150;53, was reconciled to the Roman Catholic church in 1555. It was during his mastership or just after that Baily was elected a fellow, on 16 December 1553; he became a proctor in 1554. At the beginning of Queen Mary's reign Baily was ordained a priest, and on 20 September 1557 he was elected master of the college. On Elizabeth's accession a change in the mastership took place in several Cambridge colleges and Baily was deprived of his mastership for refusing to comply with the royal injunctions. The last document he signed as master was dated 14 May 1560. His successor, Edward Leeds, signed the next extant document on 12 October 1560.<br>
<br>Baily fled, along with many other university men, to Louvain, where he became a doctor of divinity. At Louvain the exiles lived in two houses called Oxford and Cambridge. He remained until 30 January 1576, when he went to the English College, Douai, at the invitation of William Allen, the president of the college. Baily was vice-president and acted as president in Allen's absence. The college was administered by a triumvirate consisting of Allen, Baily, and Richard Bristow (one time fellow of Exeter College, Oxford). Baily was considered successful in carrying out his duties and commanded universal respect.<br>
<br>A Calvinist take-over in Douai led to the removal of the college to Rheims in 1578. On 17 January 1585 Baily visited Rome and returned in September the same year. In Rome there was a visitors' entry for Baily in the English Hospice pilgrims' book on 1 March 1585. On 27 January 1589 Baily left Rheims to return to Douai, where he spent the rest of his life with his fellow countrymen. He died at the English College, Douai, on 7 October 1591, &#145;much lamented by all the English&#146;  (Dodd, vol. 2, art. 4). He was buried in the chapel of St Nicholas in St James's Church, Douai, where some other English exiles were buried.<br>
