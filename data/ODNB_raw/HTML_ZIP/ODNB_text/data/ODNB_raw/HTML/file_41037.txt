<span class="headword">Gossip,  Arthur John</span>  (1873&#150;1954), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born on 20 January 1873 at Hillhead, Glasgow, the son of Robert Gossip, a newspaper editor, and his wife, Margaret Grieve Mundell, daughter of David Mundell of Inverlaul, Loch Broom. Gossip was educated at George Watson's College, Edinburgh, after which he attended Edinburgh University, graduating MA in 1898. He prepared for the ministry of the Free Church of Scotland at New College, Edinburgh, and was licensed in that church in 1898, serving first as assistant in the Morningside church, Edinburgh, 1898&#150;9, before serving a succession of pastoral calls. The first was to St Columba's Church, Liverpool, where he was ordained on 3 November 1899. In December 1901 he moved to the West United Free Church, Forfar. From September 1910 he was minister of St Matthew's United Free Church, Glasgow. Following service as a chaplain at the front in Belgium and France during the First World War, 1917&#150;18, he served at the Beechgrove church, Aberdeen, from 1921. In 1928 he was appointed by the general assembly of the United Free Church to be professor of Christian ethics and practical training in the divinity school of the United Free Church (known after 1929 as Trinity College). He taught at Glasgow University until his retirement in 1945, his position having become a university chair in 1939. Gossip married Janina (Nina) Henderson Carslaw (<i>d</i>. 1927), daughter of W. H. Carslaw of Helensburgh, on 4 January 1900; they had three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Gossip's publications included <span class="italic">From the Edge of the Crowd</span> (1924) and <span class="italic">Experience Worketh Hope</span> (1944), both of which, along with <span class="italic">The Hero in thy Soul</span>, were dedicated to his wife. Other works included <span class="italic">In Christ's Stead</span> (1925), <span class="italic">The Galilean Accent</span> (1926), and <span class="italic">In the Secret Place of the most High</span> (1947). He also wrote the exposition of the gospel of <span class="roman">St John</span> in <span class="italic">The Interpreter's Bible Commentary</span> (1952) and the appreciation prefaced to W. M. Macgregor, <span class="italic">The Making of a Preacher: being the Warrack Lectures, 1942&#150;1943</span> (1946). Gossip was himself the Warrack lecturer in 1925 and the McNeil-Frazer lecturer, 1932&#150;5. He received the honorary degrees of DD from Edinburgh (1929) and LLD from Glasgow (1946).<br>
<br>While Gossip invested the greater portion of his life in an academic setting, as John Mauchline, the principal of his college, wrote of him, &#145;he remained in many ways a preacher&#146;. It is indeed as a preacher, and not as a scholar, that he is best remembered. Ironically, though he wrote several popular books of sermons he is remembered chiefly for one sermon that emerged from his darkest hour. &#145;But when life tumbles in, what then?&#146; was the first sermon he preached after the sudden death in 1927 of his wife while he was minister of Beechgrove. When, in 1928, he included this sermon in his anthology <span class="italic">The Hero in thy Soul</span>, he wrote, &#145;I have not had the heart to work over it; and it is set down as it was delivered&#146;  (A. J. Gossip, <span class="italic">The Hero in thy Soul</span>, vii). The sermon remains a memorable affirmation of Christian faith in the face of grief. After his retirement in 1945 Gossip lived at Inverton, Kingussie, Inverness-shire. He died in Glasgow on 26 May 1954.<br>
