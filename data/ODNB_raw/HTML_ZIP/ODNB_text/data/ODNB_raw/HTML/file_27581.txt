<span class="headword">Tournai,  Simon  de</span>  (<em>c.</em>1130?&#150;1201?), <span class="occ">schoolman and theologian</span>, undoubtedly took his name from Tournai in what is now Belgium. However, although Matthew Paris styles him &#145;a Frenchman by birth named Simon, taking his <i>cognomen</i> from Tournai&#146;  (Paris, <span class="italic">Chron</span>., 2.476), he was often considered by English scholars before the nineteenth century to have been a native of Cornwall, who was educated at Oxford before he went to Paris. Polydore Vergil, in his <span class="italic">Anglica historia</span>, published in 1534, lists Simon Thuruaius as a celebrated man of learning who lived in the reign of King John, and implies that he was English. Surnames such as Torney and Torway are found in Cornwall in the sixteenth century, and this might be the reason why John Bale, in his <span class="italic">Illustrium maioris Britanniae scriptorum &hellip; summarium</span> of 1548  (Bale, <span class="italic">Summarium, centuria secunda</span>, fols. 99b&#150;100a), as well as following Vergil in claiming Simon for England, also reports the suggestion&#151;albeit as one made by others&#151;that Simon Thuruaius (as he follows Vergil in styling Simon) was Cornish, and moreover that the alternative name, Simon de Tornaco or Simon de Tournai, rested on a confusion caused by the similarity of the two names. By the time the first volume of his <span class="italic">Scriptorum illustrium maioris Brytanniae &hellip; catalogus</span> was published in 1557, Bale had abandoned conjecture for certainty, and he listed Simon simply as &#145;an English priest, a native of Cornwall&#146;  (Bale, <span class="italic">Cat.</span>, 1.243). In this he was followed by such seventeenth- and eighteenth-century bibliographers as Thomas Fuller, Anthony Wood, and Thomas Tanner.<br>
<br>Simon is named in contemporary sources as &#145;of Tournai&#146; because he received his early education at that city's chapter school. Probably born about 1130, before 1155 he entered the cathedral school of Notre-Dame in Paris, perhaps initially as a student under Odo of Soissons. He writes of himself as a grammarian as well as a theologian. Odo complained to Pope Alexander III in 1166 or 1167, after his retirement in 1165, that Bishop Maurice had gone back on a promise to grant his canonry or another benefice to one of his former students. This student, who may well have been Simon, was provost of the schools, and had taken over Odo's teaching. Odo writes that he taught scripture vigorously and orthodoxly, and that he himself had supported him financially for twelve years. The pope was asked to intervene with the bishop or to provide a prebend for him. It appears likely that it was at about this time that Simon obtained a canonry at Tournai. Peter Comestor was appointed in Paris, but Simon none the less stayed in the city, using his revenues from Tournai to support himself, contrary to a diocesan statute forbidding non-residence. For doing this the bishop and chapter tried to deprive him of his office. The abbot of Ste Genevi&egrave;ve, &Eacute;tienne de Tournai (1176&#150;92), intervened on his behalf with Guillaume, the archbishop of Rheims, and wrote warmly of his good name and scholarship. He appears as a master in 1172&#150;3 in the cartulary of Ste Genevi&egrave;ve and is recorded as having assisted Cardinal Pietro da Pavia in formulating a settlement favourable to Ste Genevi&egrave;ve in 1174&#150;8. He also appears, along with Gerard Pucelle, as Magister Symon de Tornaeo in the witness list of an undated document of <i>c</i>.1180. Simon may have taught theology in Paris until almost the end of the century.<br>
<br>Simon de Tournai shows himself in his surviving writings to be one of the influential group of Porretani who followed in the tradition of Gilbert de la Porr&eacute;e rather than in that of Peter Lombard. It is not known whether Gilbert, bishop of Poitiers from 1142 until his death in 1154, ever taught him; this seems unlikely, but in his <span class="italic">Sentences</span> Simon sometimes copied closely from Gilbert's writings, though without revealing his source. He was well acquainted with, and liked to cite as other Porretans also did, the works of Boethius, St Augustine, St Hilary, and John the Scot (Eriugena). His major theological writings include a collection of 102 theological <span class="italic">Disputationes</span> with 371 questions, written after 1160, and the earlier <span class="italic">Institutiones in sacra pagina</span> or <span class="italic">Summa</span>, which may not have been finished and is largely unpublished but is found in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, Paris (MSS Lat. 3114A and 14886). The former manuscript is incomplete; a portion of it, <span class="italic">Sermo de Deo et divinis</span>, has often been cited as a separate work. The relationships, chronological and other, between Simon's works and those of his contemporaries (such as Ralph Ardens and Alain de Lille) who shared many of his outlooks, present complex problems, but if his <span class="italic">Summa</span> is dated to 1160&#150;65, then Simon was an especially influential teacher of theology at a time when the numbers of identifiable teachers of theology at Paris were increasing. The part of the <span class="italic">Summa</span> that concerns the Trinity influenced closely the <span class="italic">Sentences</span> of Pierre de Poitiers. Simon drew upon the teaching on marriage of the <span class="italic">Summa decretorum</span> of the Bolognese master, Rufinus of Assisi, and of the anonymous <span class="italic">Speculum ecclesiae</span>; and he influenced the writing of the <span class="italic">Summa</span> of another Porretan, Master Martin, which survives in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, Paris (MS Lat. 14526), and was written after about 1195. His writings also influenced Lothar of Segni, who was to become Pope Innocent III (<i>r</i>. 1198&#150;1216).<br>
<br>Only one of the sermons of Simon de Tournai survives. An exposition of the Athanasian creed, written in the 1160s, it enjoyed a certain popularity until the mid-thirteenth century. Simon began this work with an observation that prompted discussion of the relationship between faith and reason during the thirteenth century: for Aristotle an argument is a reason that generates faith, but for Christ an argument is faith that gives a reason which leads to understanding. Also ascribed to him, but tentatively, are commentaries on the Lord's prayer and on the apostles' creed.<br>
<br>Simon de Tournai did not gain further promotion. He occasionally shows a mordant wit&#151;&#145;I would rather be a Catholic yokel than a heretical curialist&#146;  (<span class="italic">Disputationes</span>, 39); &#145;the church has canonized in error many of the damned&#146;  (ibid., 267). He fell victim to gossip by other writers. According to the Monk of Afflighem in his <span class="italic">Catalogue of Illustrious Authors</span> (written <i>c</i>.1270&#150;73), Simon's favourite master was Aristotle, and his adherence to Aristotle's views led to accusations of heresy against him &#145;by some moderns&#146;. Simon was, in fact, one of the earliest theologians to study the newly available translations of Aristotle's books on <span class="italic">Physics</span>, the <span class="italic">Soul</span>, and <span class="italic">Metaphysics</span>. At the end of the twelfth century, and later, stories circulated that attributed to him, but in conflicting detail, arrogance, blasphemy, and the possession of a concubine named Adelaide. Many of them appear in British sources, demonstrating not only Simon's own notoriety, but also the way in which leading masters in the Parisian schools became celebrities on the English side of the channel. According to Gerald of Wales, Simon wondered how long the superstition of Christianity could endure, and also brashly criticized the venality of the papal curia, on the occasion of a visit there, by saying publicly that access to Simon Peter was through Simon Magus. Gerald also reports that God punished him with loss of speech and memory; this probably followed a severe stroke. The Dominican friar Thomas de Cantimpr&eacute; (1201&#150;1270) wrote that Simon spoke of Moses, Christ, and Muhammad as alike impostors.<br>
<br>Matthew Paris sketches the career of Simon de Tournai in terms of rise and fall: for ten years regent of arts at Paris, he then turned his attention to theology, in which he showed a speculative bent and achieved so much proficiency that he obtained the master's chair in a few years. His tenacity of memory, natural abilities, and the brilliance with which he solved disputed theological questions, brought to his lectures audiences that more than filled the largest available room in the schools. But, while lecturing one day, he was so much elated at the acclaim that greeted his orthodox determination of questions concerning the Trinity, that he exclaimed that he could demolish his own solutions with stronger arguments if he wished to be mischievous. Whereupon he was suddenly struck dumb and bereft of his mental faculties, so that he never taught again. Nearly two years later he could barely learn from his son, or say, the <span class="roman">Pater noster</span> and the creed. This story, in which suspicion is also cast on Simon's orthodoxy, Matthew says came from an eyewitness, Nicholas of Farnham, afterwards bishop of Durham&#151;one of the many English students who went abroad and attended lectures given by famous masters in Paris and elsewhere. Matthew Paris places Simon's death in 1201.<br>
