<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Herbert,  Aubrey Nigel Henry Molyneux</span>  (1880&#150;1923), <span class="occ">diplomatist and traveller</span>, was born on 3 April 1880 at Highclere Castle, Hampshire, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13035/', "Henry Howard Molyneux Herbert, fourth earl of Carnarvon (1831&#150;1890)")</script>, secretary of state for the colonies under Lord Derby (1866&#150;7) and Disraeli (1874&#150;8), and lord lieutenant of Ireland under Lord Salisbury (1885&#150;6), and his second wife, Elizabeth or Elisabeth Catharine 
    (Elsie; <i>d</i>. 1929)
  , daughter of Henry Howard of Greystoke Castle, Cumberland, his first cousin. Aubrey was the elder son (there were no daughters) from the second marriage, Lord Carnarvon already having had a son and three daughters from his first. Although born into a family of great wealth and influence, Herbert suffered an affliction of the eyes from an early age which made him in effect blind for much of his life. He scraped through the Eton College of Dr Edmond Warre, under the particular care of Arthur Benson, his housemaster, without distinction, but in 1902 gained a first class in modern history at Balliol College, Oxford, where he also made a reputation for himself as a roof-climber, despite his blindness.<br>
<br>On leaving Oxford, Herbert was secured the position of honorary attach&eacute; at the embassy in Tokyo in 1902, but never allowed himself to become much interested in Far Eastern affairs. It was his next appointment in March 1904, to the embassy in Constantinople, which fired his enthusiasm for the Middle East and settled the subsequent course of his brief but eventful life. He was the model for the eponymous hero of <span class="italic">Greenmantle</span> (1916) by John Buchan, first Baron Tweedsmuir.<br>
<br>On his marriage on 20 October 1910 to Mary Gertrude (1889&#150;1970), only child of John Robert William Vesey, fourth Viscount de Vesci, and his wife, Lady Evelyn Charteris, daughter of the eighth earl of Wemyss, Herbert's mother gave him Pixton Park, in Somerset, with 5000 acres, and a substantial family property in Portofino, Italy. Lady de Vesci gave them her splendid London house at 28 Bruton Street, and it was thought he should have a seat in parliament. After twice contesting South Somerset in the Conservative interest in 1910 he won the seat at a by-election in November 1911 and remained an MP for the rest of his life, for South Somerset until 1918, and then for Yeovil (as the constituency was renamed).<br>
<br>Membership of the House of Commons did not interrupt Herbert's extensive travelling in the Middle East. Throughout 1911 his attention was focused almost exclusively on the Balkans, to which he travelled frequently, having many friends among remote inland brigands as well as among the cream of Kemal Atat&uuml;rk's reformist movement in Constantinople. His tireless work for the cause of Albanian nationalism was rewarded in 1913 with the first of two enquiries on the point of whether he would be prepared to accept the throne of Albania, if it was formally offered to him. On this occasion Herbert was quite keen to accept, but H. H. Asquith (a close family friend) was not encouraging and Sir Edward Grey, the foreign secretary, was against any British involvement in the Balkan tangle. The prize this time went to Prince William of Wied, representing the Austrian faction. He did not last six months. Herbert was largely responsible for the creation of the modern, independent state of Albania after the First World War, championing the rights of the Albanians against the other Balkan states.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the First World War, Herbert joined the Irish Guards, despite his near blindness, by the simple method of buying himself a second lieutenant's uniform and falling in as the regiment boarded ship for France in August 1914. After being wounded and briefly taken prisoner during the retreat from Mons, he joined the intelligence bureau in Cairo, later known as the Arab bureau, in December 1914 with T. E. Lawrence, who became a close friend and ally. As liaison officer and interpreter he took part in the Gallipoli campaign in 1915. He found that his ready command of French, Italian, German, Turkish, Arabic, Greek, and Albanian, and his personal friendship with many of the key figures in the area, made his presence invaluable to the commander-in-chief, although eyebrows were sometimes raised at his unremittingly pro-Turkish stance. He spent the rest of the war in intelligence work in Mesopotamia, Salonika, and Italy.<br>
<br>By 1920, although still receiving the Conservative whip in parliament, Herbert regarded himself as an independent, formally crossing the floor on the Irish vote on 20 November and thereafter sitting on whichever side he felt inclined. Effectively he was immersed in Albanian politics, although in February 1921, at the request of Sir Basil Thomson of Scotland Yard's special branch, he travelled to Germany for a secret meeting with Talaat, the Turk generally held responsible for the post-war Armenian massacres. Later that year, in Constantinople, he found himself put under surveillance by British military intelligence, the task being entrusted to his nephew, Henry Herbert, Lord Porchester.<br>
<br>Herbert's eccentricity was to dress as a tramp, and his appearance was further affected by his blindness and by a piebald hair coloration, the result of an early attack of alopecia. Herbert and his wife had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31223/', "Auberon Mark Yvo Henry Molyneux Herbert")</script>, and three daughters, the youngest of whom, Laura, became the wife of Evelyn Waugh. In the last year of his life Herbert was revisited by the total blindness which had afflicted his earlier years. In 1923, at a Balliol gaudy, he met his old tutor, A. L. Smith, now the master, who advised him that the best cure for blindness was to have the teeth extracted. Following this advice, Herbert developed blood poisoning and died on 26 September 1923 at 12 Beaumont Street, Portland Place, London.<br>
