<span class="headword">Stuart,  Andrew</span>  (1725&#150;1801), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, probably born at Torrance in Lanarkshire, was the second son of Archibald Stuart (<i>d</i>. 1767) of Torrance and Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Andrew Myreton of Gogar. Educated at Edinburgh high school, in 1746 he was apprenticed in his father's law practice, and became a writer to the signet in 1759. An urbane member of the Select Society and the Poker Club, he participated in the intellectual life of Enlightenment Edinburgh, counting David Hume and George Dempster as friends.<br>
<br>Through his Lanarkshire connection Stuart became in 1758 a guardian to the young James, seventh duke of Hamilton, and promoted his claim to the Douglas estates. Having named Hamilton as his heir, the duke of Douglas altered the succession in favour of Archibald Stewart, son of Lady Jane Douglas and her husband, Colonel John Stewart, whom he declared to be his nephew and heir in 1761. Stuart's challenge to this provision failed in the court of session in 1762. Undaunted, he painstakingly gathered evidence in France, the Netherlands, and Germany to prove that Lady Jane Douglas had not given birth to the boy when living in France. During his visits to Paris he impressed the <i>philosophes</i>. His proofs convinced the court to decide the succession in the duke of Hamilton's favour in July 1767. During the subsequent appeal to the House of Lords in January 1769, Stuart and the opposing counsel, Edward Thurlow (later Lord Thurlow) fought a bloodless duel. In February, in a sensational reversal of the court of session's decision in the Douglas cause, Lord Camden, lord chancellor, and Lord Mansfield, lord chief justice, attacked Stuart's integrity as a lawyer. Hume believed he had conducted the contentious case with &#145;singular Integrity and Ability&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 2.199).<br>
<br>After this d&eacute;b&acirc;cle Stuart's friends supported him financially, especially by purchasing the office of king's remembrancer in May 1770, which he held jointly from 1771 until his resignation in 1786. Meanwhile he contested the 1768 election in Lanarkshire for the duke of Hamilton's interest, which he bolstered with the votes of the Lanarkshire estates he helped to purchase for Sir George Colebrooke. In return for favouring Colebrooke's nominee in the Linlithgow burghs election in 1771, he was nominated to the East India Company's commission of inquiry in 1772, only for it to be cancelled. Stuart revenged himself on Lord Mansfield with a savage, privately distributed polemic, <span class="italic">Letters to Lord Mansfield</span> (1773), which alleged Mansfield's bias towards the Douglas claim. The <span class="italic">Letters</span> was widely admired, although Samuel Johnson compared it to &#145;the wailings of a dog that had been licked&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ominous Years</span>, 305).<br>
<br>Stuart held that the vindication of his honour was worth the price it shortly cost him of a place he desired on the Bengal supreme council. Lord North wished to help, but the king demurred, so Stuart obligingly withdrew from the contest. He was already highly effective in the legal transactions regarding freehold votes and the negotiations which underpinned the political interests of his friends and patrons, undertaking frequent journeys for the purpose. On 28 October 1774 he won the Lanarkshire seat. Stuart became a member of Henry Dundas's &#145;Scotch ministry&#146; and his close ally, sharing with him the office of keeper of the signet from March 1777. When Dundas was rewarded with the sole keepership in 1779, he insisted that Stuart be compensated with a place on the Board of Trade (6 July 1779), and the promise of the lucrative keepership of the register of sasines, which he gained in 1781. His offices and meticulously managed business made him wealthy, allowing him to spend lavishly, especially on his coaches. Boswell, no admirer, noted his &#145;awkward, stammering vanity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Applause of the Jury</span>, 21).<br>
<br>In 1775 Stuart secured a place in the East India Company for his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26709/', "James Stuart (d. 1793)")</script>, and after his suspension in 1777 Stuart published several letters to the directors of the company and the secretary at war, eloquently justifying his brother's arrest of Lord Pigot, the governor of Madras. He was a regular and assiduous attendee at the Board of Trade. During 1783 he remained friendly with North after his resignation and joined his friends in the coalition, rather than follow Dundas into opposition. Honourably resisting pleas to return to the Dundas interest at the election in 1784, he stood aside to concentrate on his legal and personal business. Before leaving parliament he assisted his brother-in-law Thomas Cochrane, eighth earl of Dundonald, concerning his salt manufacture patent, but as the earl mostly ignored his advice Stuart despaired of mitigating the financially disastrous effects of his scientific enthusiasms.<br>
<br>From 1787 Stuart researched the claims of John Stewart, seventh earl of Galloway, to the chiefship of the Stewarts, at Galloway's request. During 1789 he made discoveries in the Vatican archives concerning the marriages of Robert II, and while in Paris he professed to admire the &#145;ardent spirit of liberty&#146;  (Thorne, 5.306). At his friend Sir William Pulteney's invitation, on 19 July 1790 Stuart re-entered parliament for Pulteney's pocket borough of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis. On 9 October 1790 Stuart married Margaret, daughter of Sir William Stirling of Ardoch, who bore three daughters. In 1796 he inherited the estate of Torrance in Lanarkshire from his brother, and in 1797 the estate of Sir John Stuart of Castlemilk.<br>
<br>Stuart's assiduous research in public and private records in London, Edinburgh, and elsewhere convinced him that the Galloway claim was faulty. In his <span class="italic">Genealogical History of the Stewarts</span> (1798) he contended that with the failure of the Stewart royal line, the chiefship of the Stewarts would fall to the Stuarts of Castlemilk, coolly defending his claim in 1799. That year he recommended to Henry Dundas that the government relieve the hardships of Henry Stuart, Cardinal York. Andrew Stuart died at his home in Lower Grosvenor Street, London, on 18 May 1801.<br>
