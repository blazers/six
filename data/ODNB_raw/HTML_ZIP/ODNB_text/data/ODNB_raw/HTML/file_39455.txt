<span class="headword">Hamilton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Adamson]</span>,  Mary Agnes</span>  (1882&#150;1966), <span class="occ">politician and broadcaster</span>, was born on 8 July 1882, at 60 Parsonage Road, Withington, Manchester, the eldest of six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30339/', "Robert Adamson (1852&#150;1902)")</script>, a Scot, professor of logic at Owens College (later part of Manchester University) and subsequently at the universities of Aberdeen and Glasgow, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Duncan, teacher of botany at Manchester High School for Girls before her marriage in 1881. She attended Aberdeen Girls' High School and Glasgow Girls' High School before going to the University of Kiel in 1901 for seven months to learn German. That same year she went up to Newnham College, Cambridge, as Mathilde Blind scholar. She read classics for two years, then economics as the major element of the history tripos. She was awarded first-class honours in 1904. She became intensely interested in politics and her training in the college &#145;Political&#146; (debating society) together with her strong, low-pitched voice made her a powerful speaker. She complained that Newnham's career advice was &#145;teach or nothing&#146;, so in January 1905 she became assistant to the history professor at University College of South Wales, Cardiff. She married a colleague, Charles J. Hamilton, on 12 September 1905 but the marriage was not a success and they separated. She took up journalism to earn a living, joining <span class="italic">The Economist</span> in 1913, where her main interests were women's suffrage and reform of the poor law. She published two books on Greece and Rome and two novels before 1914.<br>
<br>In 1914 Mary Agnes Hamilton, a pacifist and admirer of Ramsay MacDonald, joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and was an original member of the pacifist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95108', "Union of Democratic Control")</script> (UDC), formed the same year. Even though she could not accept the Marxist doctrine of the ILP, she helped draw up its constitution. In 1916 she joined <span class="italic">Common Sense</span> as assistant editor, also writing for the monthly <span class="italic">War and Peace</span>. She joined the 1917 Club, a group of Liberals of the UDC variety and the Labour left who shared similar pacifist feelings. She became part of Lady Ottoline Morell's anti-war group and moved in the literary circle which included the Woolfs, the Huxleys, D. H. Lawrence, and Lytton Strachey. Her novel <span class="italic">Dead Yesterday</span> (1916) described the dilemma faced by British intellectuals at the outbreak of war. By 1918 she was a well-known journalist and speaker. In the 1920s she became, at MacDonald's instigation, assistant editor of the ILP's <span class="italic">New Labour Leader</span>, to curb the left-wing tendencies of its editor, H. N. Brailsford; the experiment was not a success. During this period, together with novels, she wrote biographies of Ramsay MacDonald, Margaret Bondfield, and Mary Macarthur.<br>
<br>Mary Agnes Hamilton stood unsuccessfully for parliament in the 1923 general election as Labour candidate for Rochester and Chatham. She was then adopted by Blackburn, where she found herself more in sympathy with the trade unionists than with the intellectuals of the Labour Party, but she lost in the 1924 election. Between 1924 and 1929 she sat on the Balfour committee on trade and industry and signed its minority report. She also served on the royal commission on the civil service (1929&#150;31).<br>
<br>In 1929 Mary Agnes Hamilton won one of the two seats for Blackburn, obtaining the highest number of votes of any Labour woman candidate. She quickly made her mark in the House of Commons with notable speeches and impressive professionalism (and always wearing red shoes in the house). She became parliamentary private secretary to the postmaster-general, Clement Attlee, who acknowledged her help in his autobiography and wrote to <span class="italic">The Times</span> upon her death that she was &#145;one of the ablest women who entered the House of Commons&#146;. In 1929 she presented the first <span class="italic">The Week in Westminster</span> for the BBC, a radio programme designed to teach women about politics. She was appointed one of two women delegates to the League of Nations in Geneva, where she was a great success, in committee and socially. She became an admirer of Arthur Henderson, Labour foreign secretary, later writing his biography (1938). She also became a friend of Hugh Dalton, future chancellor of the exchequer, one of the other delegates. She fully supported the league's search for peace and collective security.<br>
<br>In the Commons Mary Agnes Hamilton increasingly attacked the Labour Party for failing to remedy the unemployment problem. She did not join the National Government in August 1931 and was elected to the Labour Party parliamentary executive. She sat on the front bench and wound up the speech on the budget for the opposition. After losing her seat in the 1931 general election, she never returned to Westminster and her political activities during the 1930s and 1940s were confined to lecturing and broadcasting. She came out in support of League of Nations sanctions, backed by force, against Italy in 1935; and by 1943 Dalton wrote in his diary that she was now &#145;quite anti-German as opposed to her attitude in World War One&#146;. She broadcast regularly on the BBC on many topics, including new novels, and was a member of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/57624', "The Brains Trust")</script>. She was a governor of the BBC (1933&#150;7) and alderman of the county of London (1937&#150;40). In 1940 she joined the civil service as a temporary, and became head of the United States section in the Ministry of Information. She was rewarded by being made a CBE in 1949. She remained in the civil service until 1952.<br>
<br>Molly Hamilton (as she was generally known) made many trips and lecture tours to the United States, the first before the First World War, and by 1930 had a feel for the country and many friends there. In 1941 she travelled for the Ministry of Reconstruction expounding the Beveridge proposals. After the war she maintained her close connections with the USA through the English Speaking Union, to whose journal she contributed many articles. She wrote two autobiographical books, <span class="italic">Remembering my Good Friends</span> (1944) and <span class="italic">Uphill All the Way</span> (1953), an account of the achievements of a remarkable career woman and a study of her changing political and spiritual beliefs. She moved from humanism to partial acceptance of Christianity. During her latter years she disappeared from the public eye because of ill health but continued to write. She died at 28 Kenilworth Road, Ealing, London, on 10 February 1966 and was buried at Golders Green.<br>
