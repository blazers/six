<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Robertson, Sir  William Robert</span>, first baronet  (1860&#150;1933), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the son of Thomas Charles Robertson, village postmaster and tailor, and his wife, Ann Dexter Beet (<i>d</i>. 1893). Born on 29 January 1860 at Welbourn, Lincolnshire, in very humble circumstances (both of his parents were illegitimate), Robertson had two brothers and four sisters. After completing his formal education in the village school at age thirteen, he worked as a domestic servant for the Cardigan family at Deene Park, Northamptonshire, and the Vernon family at Hanbury Hall, Worcestershire. Almost nothing is known of his four years as a domestic servant, and he makes no mention of it in his autobiography.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>In November 1877 Robertson enlisted in the 16th lancers at Aldershot. His devout mother was shocked, writing to him, &#145;I would rather Bury you than see you in a red coat&#146;  (Bonham-Carter, 5). Robertson's choice of an army career seemed an especially unfortunate one for someone without the advantages of birth, wealth, or education. The Victorian army was dominated by middle- and upper-class officers, and a ranker had little opportunity for self-improvement and advancement. But Robertson was not typical of his fellow troopers who devoted their free time to women and excessive drinking. Strong and athletic, he dominated troop competitions. But it was his intellect rather than his physical fitness that largely explains his extraordinary rise through the ranks. He read widely on warfare and mastered the subjects necessary for promotion. Especially good at languages, he qualified in six Indian ones: Urdu, Hindi, Persian, Pashto, Punjabi, and Gurkhali. He also mastered German and French. His advancement is all the more noteworthy because it was achieved in the intellectual sphere of the army, in such areas as intelligence and staff work. He never commanded troops.<br>
<br>At Aldershot, Robertson's progress was steady but not remarkable: lance-corporal, February 1879; corporal, April 1879; lance-sergeant, May 1881; sergeant, January 1882; and troop sergeant-major, March 1885. In 1888 he was gazetted second lieutenant in the 3rd dragoon guards. Conscious of his inferior social standing, he was apprehensive about taking his meals in the officers' mess. &#145;You see&#146;, he wrote to his mother, &#145;I feel that I am acting under a false flag if they do not know my previous life&#146;  (Bonham-Carter, 32). His posting to India, where pay was higher and expenses for officers smaller, allowed him to survive on the economic margin. He drank water instead of alcohol and did not smoke. A pipe, for which he could afford tobacco, was not allowed in the mess.<br>
<br>Attached to the intelligence branch at army headquarters at Simla, Robertson was assigned the semi-independent and independent territories along the north-west frontier. As a member of the intelligence staff of the Chitral relief force in 1895, he was mentioned in dispatches and made DSO after he was attacked and wounded by native guides who were accompanying him on intelligence work. In December 1896 Captain Robertson departed for England with his wife (they had married on 8 September 1894), Mildred Adelaide (<i>d</i>. 1942), the second daughter of Lieutenant-General Charles Thomas Palin of the Indian army, and their five-month-old child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31616/', "Brian Hubert Robertson")</script>. Their first child, Hugh, had died in infancy. Another son, Hugh William John, born on 17 September 1909, died on 12 March 1928 when he was eighteen. There were two daughters, Rosamund Mildred (<i>b</i>. 21 Sept 1901) and Helen Millicent (<i>b</i>. 17 Dec 1905).<h2>
<a name="Militaryintelligenceandmilitarytraining"></a>Military intelligence and military training</h2>Robertson's career now took a dramatic turn. Having passed the entrance exam for the Staff College at Camberley, he joined Britain's emerging military &eacute;lite. As the first ranker to be accepted at Camberley, Robertson more than held his own with classmates such as Douglas Haig, Edmund H. H. Allenby, Archibald J. Murray, and George F. Milne, officers destined to play prominent roles in the First World War. Robertson's intellectual mentor, the military theorist George F. R. Henderson, emphasized the concentration of forces in the primary theatre of the enemy in order to overwhelm his main force in a decisive battle. These principles served as a bond between Robertson and Haig when the two men dominated British military policy. &#145;There was never, so far as I know, any material difference of opinion between us in regard to the main principles to be observed in order to win the war&#146;, Robertson notes in his autobiography  (Robertson, <span class="italic">From Private to Field-Marshal</span>, 98).<br>
<br>Robertson left Staff College, and, after a brief stint with the intelligence branch of the War Office, joined the intelligence branch of the headquarters staff of Lord Roberts in South Africa. His service in the South African War was brief. Having arrived in Cape Town on 20 January 1900, he was ordered back to the War Office after only nine months. As head of the foreign military intelligence section (1901&#150;7) he identified Germany as the greatest strategic threat to Britain, and believed that an alliance with France was essential to the security of the empire. In November 1903 he became one of the youngest colonels in the army. At the end of January 1907 he was put on half pay until May, when he became the assistant quartermaster-general at Aldershot; and in December he replaced Archibald Murray as General Sir Horace Smith Dorrien's chief of general staff at the Aldershot command. In June 1910 he was offered the prestigious position of commandant of the Staff College at Camberley, and in December he was promoted major-general.<br>
<br>Taking a common-sense approach to the art of war, Robertson trained officers at Camberley to conduct retreats as well as advances. Application took precedence over theory. &#145;Training manuals do not pretend to be exhaustive tactical treatises&#146;, he emphasized. &#145;They lay down certain principles, but they do not pretend to show how these principles must be treated or modified under conditions which are so infinitely diversified&#146;  (&#145;Remarks on visit to battlefield, 1912&#146;, Robertson MSS, 1 Feb 1912). Although Robertson did not possess the gift of extemporaneous speech, his prepared lectures were well received and especially noteworthy for their clarity. Sir James Edmonds, the compiler of the official British history of the war, ranked him with Henderson as a teacher. In October 1913 Robertson became director of military training in the War Office, an appointment that disappointed him because he wanted to command troops. Sir John French, the chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), however, promised that the 1st division at Aldershot would be his to command the following summer. Britain's involvement in the First World War altered this arrangement. Robertson, or Wully as he was affectionately known, was fifty-five years old at the outbreak of war. Powerfully built with a prominent jaw, he had a physical presence to match his blunt personality. Fools were not suffered gladly. His directness, however, was not always in evidence: known for his witticisms, he was good company and moved easily in the highest social circles.<h2>
<a name="Advocateoftrenchwarfare"></a>Advocate of trench warfare</h2>When Archibald Murray became Sir John French's chief of general staff, Robertson replaced him as quartermaster-general. By transferring supply bases from the Belgian to the Atlantic coast and cutting red tape, Robertson kept the British expeditionary force (BEF) supplied during its retreat from Mons. His hands-on approach won him the nickname Old Any-Complaints. When visiting the troops, he often enquired, &#145;Any complaints men?&#146; On 25 January 1915 Robertson replaced Murray again. Dwarfed by the much larger French army, the BEF played a supporting role on the western front. The British First Army, commanded by Haig, launched four offensives in 1915 that achieved little. Anticipating a long and wearing conflict, Robertson envisaged Britain, once her reserves of manpower were mobilized, as the decisive factor in Germany's defeat. Assisted by his handpicked director of military operations, Sir Frederick B. Maurice, Robertson in his new role as chief of general staff attempted to solve the riddle of static trench warfare which had replaced the war of movement of the first months of the war. The ever-expanding system of earthworks had the property of an elastic band. They bent rather than broke. Robertson concluded that a decisive battle was unlikely so long as Germany had reserves to bring forward. To prevent the Germans from gradually giving ground while inflicting heavy losses on the attacker, Robertson and Maurice hoped to nail the defenders to their trenches by choosing an objective which the enemy considered strategically vital. &#145;If the Germans are to be defeated they must be beaten by a process of slow attrition, by a slow and gradual advance on our part, each step being prepared by a predominant artillery fire and great expenditure of ammunition&#146;, he argued in a general staff note on 8 February 1915  (&#145;Memorandum on the possibility of undertaking offensive operations&#146;, TNA: PRO, WO 158/7). Robertson's cautious approach of placing killing Germans above conquering territory was bound to be costly, although not as costly as attempts to carry the German defensive system in a one-step breakthrough.<br>
<br>Something more than deliberate tactics was necessary for success. Robertson also lobbied for changes in the higher conduct of the war: the revitalization of the general staff in the War Office (which was being ignored by the British government's military adviser, Lord Kitchener, secretary of state for war); the adoption of conscription and an increase in the size of British forces in France and Flanders; and the formulation of a common Anglo-French plan to conduct operations.<br>
<br>Horrified by the long casualty lists, Britain's war leaders were divided over their country's military role. Acting as supreme war-lord, Kitchener sought to limit involvement in trench warfare until Britain's allies had exhausted Germany's reserves. Other war leaders, such as David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill, sought theatres where both political and military gains might be made without engaging the main body of the German army. Involved now in planning and co-ordinating allied campaigns in the western theatre, and in touch with both the political leadership and general staff in London, Robertson opposed limiting Britain's liability. Britain could not shift the responsibility of defeating its chief strategic rival to its continental allies. The casualties involved in protracted trench warfare could not be avoided so long as a victor's peace remained the goal. Robertson's criticism of peripheral operations was given added force when the Gallipoli and Dardanelles ventures ended in disaster and a British force advancing on Baghdad was surrounded by the Turks at Kut al-Amara. Meanwhile, because of French prodding, another theatre opened in the Balkans at Salonika, Greece, with little regard for military ends and means.<h2>
<a name="Militaryadvisertothegovernment"></a>Military adviser to the government</h2>Having lost faith in Kitchener, and with his cabinet unable to achieve any consensus on strategy, H. H. Asquith, the prime minister, turned to Robertson. In delicate negotiations with Kitchener, Robertson extracted terms that revitalized the general staff and reduced the secretary of state's role to little more than feeding and clothing the army. Robertson's position as the sole military adviser to the government was subsequently given constitutional authority in January 1916 by an order of council issued by George V.<br>
<br>Robertson's arrival in the War Office on his own terms on 23 December 1915 was part of a larger shake-up of the British high command. Haig replaced French as commander-in-chief. Robertson had been considered for this position, but his abilities seemed best utilized in London as CIGS. Although he lost the greater prize, Robertson enthusiastically endorsed Haig as French's successor. Robertson did not share Haig's enthusiasm for seeking decisive victory in every major offensive, but he closed ranks with him to prevent opponents of concentrating British military resources in the western theatre from exploiting any division in the high command.<br>
<br>In December 1915 allied military leaders meeting at Chantilly designated France, Russia, and Italy as the &#145;principal&#146; fronts. Although all other theatres were declared &#145;subsidiary&#146;, Robertson was displeased. What he called the &#145;hideous nightmare&#146;, the allied campaign in the Balkans, had not been terminated because of pressure from Britain's allies  (Robertson, <span class="italic">Soldiers and Statesmen</span>, 1.288). The allied leaders at Chantilly also decided upon simultaneous offensives in 1916 in the &#145;principal&#146; theatres, and Robertson sought to end talk in London of limiting Britain's participation in the war until German forces had become demoralized and exhausted. He gained approval for a major Anglo-French offensive on the Somme and then successfully lobbied for conscription to replace the BEF's losses. Robertson's success in gaining a larger British commitment to the western theatre was in large part due to the logic of his arguments. A powerful German offensive, launched in March against Verdun, was wearing down the French army. And there was little sympathy within the government for President Woodrow Wilson's offer of American mediation of the conflict. As Robertson argued, a compromise peace would only lead shortly to a future war in which Germany would represent an even greater strategic threat to the British empire.<br>
<br>British losses on the first day of the Somme offensive&#151;almost 60,000 casualties&#151;shocked Robertson. Haig's one-step breakthrough attempt was the antithesis of Robertson's cautious approach of exhausting the enemy with artillery and limited advances. Although he secretly discussed more prudent tactics with Haig's subordinates he defended the BEF's operations in London. The British offensive, despite its limited results, was having a positive effect in conjunction with the other allied attacks under way against the central powers. The continuation of Haig's offensive into the autumn, however, was not so easy to justify. The French army was no longer in danger at Verdun, and the Russians were in retreat in the east where the Germans had regained the strategic initiative. When Lloyd George, who had become secretary of state for war in June 1916 without in any way altering the Kitchener&#150;Robertson compact, demanded that reinforcements be sent to aid Romania (a recent addition to the alliance), Robertson argued that maintaining pressure in the west could best prevent that country from being overrun. Romania's subsequent collapse coincided with Robertson's admission that Germany, despite its enormous losses in 1916 at Verdun and on the Somme, had increased the number of its divisions. Although Robertson had not promised victory in 1916 and had been candid about Britain's potential casualties, the civilians expected more than the apparently barren results of Haig's offensive. No strategic advantage had been gained and Haig's breakthrough mentality had not made attrition work in Britain's favour.<h2>
<a name="RobertsonandLloydGeorge"></a>Robertson and Lloyd George</h2>In December 1916 Lloyd George replaced Asquith as prime minister. Robertson, although he sided with no political faction, supported this transfer of power. Asquith had deferred to the soldiers, but Robertson believed him incapable of providing the dynamic and purposeful leadership required to see the war through to victory. Lloyd George's ascendancy, however, threatened Robertson's control over strategy. Sickened by the mounting casualties, which he blamed on the high command's fixation on the western front, Lloyd George planned to assert civilian control over the higher direction of the war. Britain, however, continued its commitment to the western front in 1917 because Britain's allies were more inclined to Robertson's views than to the prime minister's. The prime minister's influence over strategic and military questions was also limited by the support that Robertson enjoyed from the king, powerful elements in the national press, and key members of the government.<br>
<br>After failing to shift emphasis to the Italian front at an inter-allied conference at Rome in January 1917, Lloyd George manoeuvred to give the new French commander-in-chief, Robert Nivelle, who promised to rupture the German defences in twenty-four to forty-eight hours, operational command of the BEF at an Anglo-French conference at Calais in February. Robertson, exploiting France's apparent desire to co-opt the BEF, succeeded in removing some of the more objectional aspects of this flawed effort to unite the British and French forces for the next campaign. Nivelle's subsequent failure to live up to his inflated promises demoralized the French army whose decline was only one of Britain's many concerns in the spring of 1917. The Russian army collapsed following the overthrow of the Romanov dynasty in March. Italy wanted British support, more for defensive than offensive purposes. And the United States, a new entrant in the war, was building an army from scratch and was unlikely to be a factor in the war for a year or more. The primary burden of fighting the German army shifted to Britain. Fearing that Britain's manpower might be exhausted, Lloyd George opposed the all-British offensive that general headquarters had long favoured in Flanders. Haig was confident that he could decisively defeat the German army as well as satisfy his government's desire to capture the Belgian ports from which German surface raiders threatened British sea traffic. Robertson did not think in such grandiose terms and was not prepared to squander British manpower in a prolonged offensive aimed at decisive victory. But he saw no other theatre where British arms might be as effective or where the war would ultimately be won or lost. If the BEF assumed a passive position during the last half of 1917, Britain's continental allies might falter before American troops arrived in force. In Flanders the Germans would have to stand and fight, and Robertson believed that British artillery superiority would make attrition work in Britain's favour. The war cabinet, at Lloyd George's prodding, considered alternative offensives all around the Mediterranean from Alexandretta (Iskenderun) to the Italian front to the Balkans. The government, however, eventually sanctioned an offensive in Flanders, but only on the condition that operations would be suspended if the attack degenerated into another Somme. Robertson initially accepted these conditions, suggesting to Haig that the success of his offensive might be judged after only two weeks. Fearing that his government would make Italy the primary theatre, Haig protested. He demanded and got Robertson's support for the continuation of his Passchendaele offensive although heavy rain reduced the ground to a quagmire throughout much of the prolonged battle and limited both his progress and the effectiveness of his artillery. Believing that the enemy would crack at any moment, Haig continued to push forward in September and October. A concerned Robertson met with the BEF's commanders. With Haig looking on, they expressed confidence in the ultimate success of their offensive. One word from Robertson would have emboldened the civilians to terminate the offensive. This word never came. In retrospect Robertson clearly regretted his silence. The dispatch of some of Haig's divisions to rescue Italy after the Austro-German success at Caporetto finally forced Haig to halt his attack after the village of Passchendaele was captured in November.<h2>
<a name="Thenonwesternfronts"></a>The non-western fronts</h2>Robertson's support for the Flanders offensive (third Ypres) undermined his position, as did his technical advice on British operations in the Turkish theatres. The political leadership in late 1917 had to consider the possibility that Germany might defeat their continental allies. In this event control of areas such as Palestine would be vital to secure the British empire from a Turko-German threat and to acquire bargaining chips if peace negotiations materialized. Robertson is frequently pictured as an inflexible &#145;westerner&#146;, but this view requires modification. Recognizing that a victory over the Turks would boost British morale, and being concerned about the defence of the empire, he had supported an aggressive stance in the Turkish theatres at the beginning of 1917 when the conquest of Baghdad coincided with reports of a British victory at Gaza. But these favourable military conditions changed abruptly. Unrestricted German U-boat warfare created a serious shipping crisis in the outlying theatres. A Russian advance out of Persia (which would shield the forward British position at Baghdad) collapsed following the March revolution; and reports of British success at Gaza proved misleading. Robertson consequently urged a passive policy in the Turkish theatres. Despite the depressing results of the battles on the western front, Robertson argued that it was more important than ever to concentrate British resources there. Lloyd George, now backed by the war cabinet, wanted to reinforce and expand the mission of the Egyptian expeditionary force (EEF) under General Allenby. When Allenby captured Jerusalem with relative ease in December 1917, Lloyd George and other members of the war cabinet suspected Robertson of trying to limit the EEF's role by exaggerating its requirements. Rather than face a public reaction to Robertson's dismissal, Lloyd George chose indirect means of circumventing him: the creation of an inter-allied body, the supreme war council (SWC) with its own general staff located at Versailles. Robertson objected to this inter-allied body whose military representatives provided advice independent of the national general staffs. Robertson had long recognized the necessity of co-ordinating allied military operations, and had worked to create the model for previous allied co-operation, the meeting of allied generals at Chantilly in December 1915. But Lloyd George's previous efforts at unity of command suggested that he was inclined towards subordinating Haig to the French rather than co-ordinating allied operations. An additional goal of the prime minister now seemed to be the diminishing of Robertson's influence over strategy.<h2>
<a name="RemovalfromtheWarOffice"></a>Removal from the War Office</h2>Robertson's opposition to the new machinery of the SWC provided the background for his removal as CIGS. At a meeting of the supreme war council (30 January&#150;2 February 1918) Lloyd George's soldier on the SWC, Sir Henry Wilson, shepherded a proposal through the committee of military advisers for a major spring campaign in Palestine. Robertson, convinced that Germany would try to win the war in the west before the United States became a factor, angered the prime minister when he spoke in the presence of other allied political leaders against gambling scarce military resources in the outside theatres. A further disagreement between Robertson and the prime minister emerged over the command of a general reserve. Robertson thought a reserve essential to counter the German offensive he anticipated, and was prepared to accept Field Marshal Joseph Joffre as generalissimo if he were appointed his chief of staff. When Lloyd George rejected this proposal Robertson insisted that the chiefs of the general staff be given authority over the general reserve, but Sir Henry Wilson and Lloyd George supported an executive war board, chaired by Ferdinand Foch, with broad powers over allied reserves. Robertson expressed his opposition to General Sir Herbert Plumer in a letter on 4 February:<blockquote>It is impossible to have Chiefs of the General Staffs dealing with operations in all respects except reserves and to have people with no other responsibilities dealing with reserves and nothing else. In fact the decision is unsound, and [neither] do I see how it is to be worked either legally or constitutionally. (Woodward, <span class="italic">Military Correspondence</span>, 283)</blockquote>When the London press took up the issue and parliament became involved, Lloyd George's ministry appeared in danger. Robertson's political skills, however, were ill-matched to those of Lloyd George. Unity of command was in reality a secondary issue. As Robertson told the war cabinet on 14 February, the real question was whether the war cabinet wished to retain him as their military adviser. When this civil&#150;military conflict focused on who was in charge, the prime minister or his CIGS, Robertson could not win, especially when Haig did not put up a fight to save him. Rejected by Haig as one of his army commanders, Robertson took the eastern command when he left the War Office on 18 February.<h2>
<a name="Theendofthewarhonoursandretirement"></a>The end of the war: honours and retirement</h2>Robertson had been removed from the centre of power but the government still felt his presence on two occasions during the last months of the war. When the German offensive, launched on 21 March, destroyed the British Fifth Army, critics of Lloyd George's war leadership demanded that Robertson be returned as CIGS. To placate Robertson's supporters Lloyd George considered sending him to France as Haig's second in command. Robertson, however, wrote to Haig on 19 April: &#145;My job is C.I.G.S. or nothing&#146;  (Haig MSS, no. 126). As this controversy died down in the press another erupted when Maurice, having consulted Robertson, published a letter that accused the government of dangerously weakening the BEF prior to the 21 March German offensive. Lloyd George, fighting for his political life, suspected a military conspiracy to place the soldiers in charge of the country. Robertson may have hoped that the government might reappoint him CIGS, but that was not the same as aspiring to be a British Hindenburg. Lloyd George emerged from the &#145;Maurice debate&#146; in parliament in a stronger political position than ever. In June, Robertson became commander-in-chief, home forces. Following the armistice Robertson took command of the British army of the Rhine. When the list of war honours and rewards was published in October 1919 he received a grant of &pound;10,000 (Haig got &pound;100,000, French and Allenby &pound;50,000 each) and a baronetcy. After relinquishing his command in Germany in March 1920 he returned to London. No official greeting party awaited him at Victoria Station. &#145;Having secured a broken-down taxi&#146;, he writes, &#145;I drove to my residence in Eccleston Square, and thereupon joined the long list of unemployed officers on half-pay&#146;  (Robertson, <span class="italic">From Private to Field-Marshal</span>, 377). Although his military career was over, other honours awaited him. Because of Churchill's intervention, he was promoted field marshal, the most impressive of the many &#145;firsts&#146; he had achieved as a ranker. He was also created GCVO (1931); he had earlier been made CB (1905), CVO (1910), KCVO (1913), KCB (1915), GCB (1917), and GCMG (1919). Cambridge awarded him the LLD degree in 1919 and Oxford that of DCL in 1920. In 1925 he became colonel of his old regiment, the 3rd dragoon guards. He also became a member of the royal household when he accepted the colonelcy of the Royal Horse Guards (the Blues).<br>
<br>Of modest means, Robertson became a business executive, serving as chairman of the Brewers' Trustees and as a director on numerous boards, including British Dyestuffs, the Palestine Corporation, and the London General Omnibus Company. At his death he had amassed a considerable estate with a probate value of &pound;50,000; this did not include gifts he had made to family members.<br>
<br>Robertson published his autobiography, <span class="italic">From Private to Field-Marshal</span>, in 1921, and in his later work, <span class="italic">Soldiers and Statesmen, 1914&#150;1918</span> (2 vols., 1926), he gives a generally even-handed account of the formulation of British wartime policy and strategy. In 1932 he served as president of the British Legion. Although he wrote on war, emphasized preparedness, and criticized the United States for going too far in reducing its naval strength, his public opposition to war made him a prominent spokesman for peace.<br>
<br>Robertson's pastimes were fishing, shooting, and golf. In retirement he lived at 88 Westbourne Terrace near Paddington Station. On 12 February 1933, while dressing at his home, he died of a thrombosis. On 16 February, following a memorial service at Westminster Abbey, which was attended by many dignitaries, including Lloyd George, he was buried at Brookwood. He wanted to be remembered as a &#145;simple civilian&#146;, and his strictly private funeral was surely unique for such a distinguished British soldier. No uniformed officers were present, no gun carriage conveyed his coffin, and the &#145;Last Post&#146; was not sounded. The only indication of his forty-two years' military service was that a union flag, which had been used at the funerals of Haig, C. C. Monro, and Plumer, covered his coffin.<br>
