<span class="headword">Symes,  John Elliotson</span>  (1847&#150;1921), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born at 77 Grosvenor Street, London, on 31 December 1847, the second son of Edmond Sheppard Symes MD and his wife, Mary, formerly West. He was educated at University College School, London, before being admitted as a scholar at Downing College, Cambridge, in October 1867. He was president of the Cambridge Union and graduated in 1871 as tenth junior optime in the mathematical tripos; he proceeded MA in 1874. He taught at Lancing College, Sussex, from 1872 to 1875. In 1875 Symes was ordained priest and became a Cambridge extension lecturer, serving also as a curate in Stepney, London. Five years later he became second master at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle upon Tyne.<br>
<br>In 1881 Symes was appointed professor of language and literature at the newly founded Nottingham University College. On 31 December 1884 in Gateshead he married Eleanor Sabina Baylee, daughter of W. C. P. Baylee, vicar of Alston, Cumberland. At Nottingham Symes lectured also on history and political economy (Henry, later Baron, Snell was one of his students). He introduced teacher training and commercial courses, and later created an engineering department. As principal from 1890 he had far-reaching ambitions for the college, proposing to the Bryce commission on secondary education of 1894&#150;5 that it should become an educational centre to serve the whole of the east midlands. He also wanted to see each region of the country with its own university or college. However, Symes's three decades as professor and principal brought only relatively modest growth to the college. It relied almost wholly on funds from the municipality, and most councillors wished for little more than a technical college. Incapable of cajoling his paymasters into laying out funds as an act of civic pride, by his views and activities he unwittingly turned the worthies of Nottingham against him.<br>
<br>Although an acclaimed preacher in local churches, Symes shared platforms with such high-profile freethinkers as Charles Bradlaugh and with the unorthodox cleric Stewart Headlam. At the church congresses of 1877 and 1880 he helped to distribute humanist pamphlets, and at the latter congress commended the nobility of secularist principles. An executive member of the Guild of St Matthew, a pressure group for the promotion of Christian socialism, he regularly lectured to secularists in the hope of converting them.<br>
<br>For a while Symes enthusiastically supported Bradlaugh's Land Law Reform League, founded to publicize Henry George's proposals for a land tax. George Bernard Shaw later quipped that the radical Symes was &#145;the chaplain of a pirate ship&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bernard Shaw: Collected Letters, 1898&#150;1910</span>, ed. D. H. Lawrence, 1972, 489). However, Symes soon resigned from the league, and in <span class="italic">A Short Text Book of Political Economy</span> (1888) advocated a tax on the rental value of land, preferably topped up by a highly progressive income tax. He urged state action to relieve the widespread poverty and unemployment of the 1880s, advocating job-creating government workshops. He also protested at the low wages and poor working conditions of the Nottingham laceworkers. To assist the welfare of deprived children Symes was chairman of the committee of the Nottingham branch of the NSPCC and of the Children's Holidays in Country Cottages scheme.<br>
<br>In 1887 Symes caused further rumpuses by delivering some public lectures on the Irish question, and was condemned for using the college to spread political propaganda. Having in various ways incensed councillors, businessmen, and other influential local people, he gave them every excuse to withhold extra funds from the college, and this ruled out any move to its becoming a university during Symes's principalship.<br>
<br>Having fought off several attempts by the council to unseat him, Symes remained as principal until he retired in 1912, and was then made an emeritus professor. He thereafter intended to devote himself to work consistent with his strong sympathies; one part was the writing of <span class="italic">Broad Church</span> (1913), in which he maintained that a socialist programme must above all be a moral one, to improve human character, rather than a purely material one. He died at the Pension Suisse, via Monteleone, Palermo, Sicily, on 31 March 1921. He was survived by his wife and by two daughters, both teachers at independent schools.<br>
