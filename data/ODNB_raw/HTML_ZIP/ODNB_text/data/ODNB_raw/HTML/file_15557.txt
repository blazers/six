<span class="headword">King <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Freeman]</span>, Sir  Edmund</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1630, <em>d.</em> 1709), <span class="occ">physician and surgeon</span>, the eldest son of the five sons and four daughters of Edmond King (<i>d</i>. 1651) of Northampton, physician, and Alice, was baptized as Edmond on 22 August 1630 in All Saints' Church, Northampton. As Edmund Freeman, alias Kinge, his father received on 9 May 1612 an archbishop's licence to practise medicine and surgery in the dioceses of Peterborough, Lincoln, Norwich, Coventry, and Oxford. His mother was named as the wife of Edmond King in the baptisms of three children at All Saints, Northampton, but no marriage of Edmond and Alice was recorded in Northampton, nor is there an extant licence.<br>
<br>King went to London after his father's death in July 1651 and practised surgery; it is not known if he underwent any apprenticeship. He attended the surgeons at St Bartholomew's Hospital between 1651 and 1660, and as Edmund Freeman, alias King, he received a licence on 1 June 1663 from Archbishop Juxon to practise medicine in England, with the exception of London and 5 miles around. On 12 May 1663 he was given a Lambeth degree of MB, as Edmund Freeman, alias King. He was incorporated MD at Cambridge on 5 October 1671 on his Lambeth degree. Initially King lived in Little Britain, London, in a house which had a museum of anatomical specimens, such as a dried ileocaecal valve pressed in a large paper book. In 1665 he moved to a house in Hatton Garden, where he remained for the rest of his life. On 20 December 1666 he married Rebecca Polsted (<i>b</i>. 1631/2), the widow of John Polsted and third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6705/', "Sir Nicholas Crisp (c.1599&#150;1666)")</script>, and his wife, Anne Prescott. On 23 February 1666 King witnessed the will of Crisp, who died three days later, at which time King performed an autopsy on him. Rebecca was buried on 27 October 1698 at St Mildred's Church, Bread Street, in her father's vault, where her child, Martha, had been buried on 27 February 1684.<br>
<br>In addition to cultivating an extensive surgical practice King was active as an experimental anatomist of humans and other animals. On 11 July 1666 John Wilkins, the mathematician and Anglican divine who sponsored an experimental club in natural philosophy while warden of Wadham College, Oxford, proposed King as a member of the Royal Society, and he was admitted as Mr Edmond King on 25 July 1666. On 28 November 1666 he presented a dissected foetus at a meeting. King's notable society activities included his participation in early blood transfusion experiments. Following a protocol for animal-to-animal blood transfusions developed by physician and anatomist Richard Lower, with the assistance of Christopher Wren and others, in Oxford during late 1665 and early 1666, on 14 November 1666 King led in London a group that duplicated Lower's experiment. On 5 December 1666 King collaborated with Lower on bleeding a sheep into a dog at a society meeting. In 1667 he published in the society's <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> a detailed account of an experiment that used an apparatus of pipes and quills to transfuse the blood of a calf into a sheep. Samuel Pepys, an onlooker, reflected in his diary that a discussion with friends about the experiment &#145;did give occasion to many pretty wishes, as of the blood of a Quaker to be let into an Archbishop, and such like&#146;  (Pepys, 370&#150;71). King's most notable transfusion work occurred on 23 November 1667, when he undertook a private trial with Lower, who then lived in London, to transfuse blood from a sheep into an Oxford student, Arthur Coga, who was paid 20<i>s</i>. The three participated in a public demonstration before members and guests of the Royal Society a few weeks later, and results were soon published in <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>. King and Lower stopped transfusion experiments after a human participant in a French trial died from the effects in February 1668.<br>
<br>From 1666 until 1668 King used his surgical skills in a number of collaborative experiments on respiration with Robert Hooke and Peter Balle. At issue was whether respiration depended on a chemical component in the air entering the blood as it circulated through the lungs (Hooke's, Lower's, and Robert Boyle's position), or a mechanical mixing of blood and air dependent on pulmonary motion (Walter Needham's argument). King also studied insects, primarily ants, and published papers in <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> in 1667 and 1670 on ants and leaf-cutter bees. His case notes on post-mortem examinations of patients, as well as his published microscopic researches on reproductive glands in men, guinea pigs, and bulls  (<span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>, 1668), recorded his belief that animal tissues, including human, are primarily composed of fibres, tubes, and liquors.<br>
<br>King's surgical practice expanded greatly in the late 1660s and early 1670s, when he became the preferred surgeon for Thomas Willis, then London's leading physician, and Richard Lower, another collaborator of Willis. King also worked with Willis on autopsies of their patients and in the preparation of part one of Willis's <span class="italic">De anima brutorum</span> (1672) and <span class="italic">Pharmaceutice rationalis</span> (1674). Unlike Willis, however, King eschewed making broad hypotheses based on anatomical findings. In addition to referring patients to him, Willis may have facilitated King's professional success through introducing him to his patron, Gilbert Sheldon, archbishop of Canterbury, and a powerful figure at court. By the mid-1670s King was attending Charles II, who knighted him in 1676, and in a letter of 20 January 1677 recommended him to the Royal College of Physicians for admission as an honorary fellow. The college refused; however, he was admitted as a fellow on 12 April 1687 by the renewed college charter of James II. King attended Charles II during his final illness, which involved seizures. The king's initial revival from a fit after a bleeding administered by King caused the privy council to recommend a fee of &pound;1000, but Charles II's death soon after caused the matter to drop.<br>
<br>In 1693 King was the subject of a complaint made by a Mr Lynn, an apothecary, who stated that King had turned himself and a Dr Biggs out from attending Sir John Heron, claiming that if he (King) had been called in earlier he could have done more, thereby implying that Biggs was less than competent. King asserted his innocence and the charge was dropped.<br>
<br>King retired from practice at the age of seventy-two and died in Hatton Garden on 29 May 1709; he was buried with his wife at St Mildred's, Bread Street, on 3 June. King's will, dated 24 March 1709, refers to portraits of himself by Godfrey Kneller and Peter Lely. The latter work was bequeathed to the Royal College of Physicians while the Kneller seems lost.<br>
