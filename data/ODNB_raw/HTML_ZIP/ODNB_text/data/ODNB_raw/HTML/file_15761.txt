<span class="headword">Knollys,  Charles</span>, styled fourth earl of Banbury  (<em>bap. </em>1662, <em>d.</em> 1740), <span class="occ">peerage claimant and duellist</span>, was baptized at Boughton, Northamptonshire, on 3 June 1662, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15757/', "Nicholas Knollys (1631&#150;1674)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15760/', "Knollys, William, first earl of Banbury")</script>], who claimed to be third earl of Banbury, and his second wife, Anne Sherard (<i>d</i>. 1680). Nothing is known of his early years and education, but it can be safely assumed that he was drawn into his father's struggle for his title from an early age. Nicholas, whose father may have been William Knollys, the eighty-six-year-old first earl of Banbury, or his mother's lover and eventual second husband, Edward, fourth Baron Vaux, had since 1661 been excluded from the House of Lords, which firmly believed that he was illegitimate.<br>
<br>In June 1685 Knollys petitioned the Lords for a writ of summons. As had happened in his father's case, an order of the house for a full hearing went unfulfilled, and his claim remained undetermined. It was still at issue when on 16 May 1689 he married, at the Nag's Head Coffee House, James Street, Covent Garden, Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1663, <i>d</i>. 1699), daughter of Michael Lister of Burwell, Lincolnshire, and his wife, Ann Burrell. She took the title countess of Banbury. At the same time Knollys seems to have been involved with an actress, Elizabeth Price, with whom he apparently travelled in France and Italy from November 1689 until the spring of 1692. Price, in a claim rejected by the court of arches in 1697, said she married Knollys at Verona in 1692. They were reputedly the parents of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15765/', "Sir Charles Knowles, first baronet (d. 1777)")</script>, although a later unknown mistress may well have been Knowles's mother.<br>
<br>The dispute over the Banbury title took on a new urgency in 1692. Abandoning his mistress, who then drifted to the Stuart court at St Germain, Knollys returned to London. His callous behaviour towards his wife probably was behind the duel he then fought with his brother-in-law, Captain Philip Lawson. Knollys killed Lawson, and on 7 December 1692 the Middlesex grand jury indicted him for murder&#151;as Charles Knollys, esquire. His life in the balance, Knollys petitioned the Lords for trial as a peer, a move which provoked the house to resolve that he had no right to the Banbury title&#151;a decision against which twenty peers entered a protest in the Lords' journal. The upper house remained, by a relatively small majority of about eight, unpersuaded by Knollys's claims. Judicial proceedings, however, gave his claim an important boost, and rescued him from his murder charge as well. Knollys successfully had his trial moved from the Middlesex sessions to the king's bench, and at his arraignment in Hilary term 1693 he argued that his indictment was invalid, since he had been charged as Charles Knollys and not earl of Banbury. In Trinity term 1694, after months of argument, the four judges of the king's bench, agreeing unanimously, threw out the indictment on the principle that <i>pater est quem nuptiae demonstrant</i>, presuming the legitimacy of children born in wedlock, and freed Knollys.<br>
<br>Reinforced by the judges' unambiguous support for his claim to the earldom, Knollys continued to press ahead, petitioning again in 1698. The Lords, to whom William III referred the petition, reiterated their 1693 resolution and complained about the judges' presumption. His marriage, on 30 April 1702, at St Bride's, London, to Mary (<i>d</i>. 1762), daughter of a London merchant, Thomas Woods, might have eased his financial plight, but was a sign of his declining social position. Yet Knollys saw a new chance for his claim in 1712, as Queen Anne's government desperately sought votes in the Lords for its policies. He petitioned the queen in March, but the privy council, to whom it was referred, had not reported by Anne's death in August 1714. Knollys made a final attempt, in 1727, at the accession of George II. He petitioned once again for a writ of summons, but the attorney-general, Sir Philip Yorke, in 1728 advised that the matter should be taken no further on the grounds that the Lords and king's bench could not agree on the case. From then until his death at Dunkirk on 26 August 1740, Knollys seems to have given up the unequal struggle. He was buried on 28 August. His only surviving son with his first wife, William Knollys (1694&#150;1740), who became MP for Banbury in 1733, always styled himself Viscount Wallingford as the eldest son of the earl of Banbury, but died just under three months before his father, on 6 June 1740, and so was unable to renew the claim. His eldest son with his second wife, Charles Knollys (1703&#150;1771), went into the church, and neither Charles nor his two sons, William Knollys (1726&#150;1776) and Thomas Woods Knollys (1727&#150;1793), laid formal claim to the title.<br>
<br>The son of Thomas and his wife, Mary Porter (<i>d</i>. 1798), <a name="cosubject_15761"></a><span class="headword">William Knollys</span>, styled eighth earl of Banbury  (<em>bap. </em>1763, <em>d.</em> 1834), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was baptized at St Thomas's, Winchester, on 2 March 1763. He entered the army as an ensign in the 3rd foot guards in 1778, was promoted lieutenant in 1788, lieutenant-colonel in 1793, and colonel (brevet) in 1795. On 23 June 1795, at St Thomas's, Winchester, he married Charlotte Martha (<i>d</i>. 1818), daughter of Ebenezer Blackwell, a London banker. He was promoted major-general in 1802.<br>
<br>In 1806 Knollys petitioned the crown for a writ of summons to the House of Lords as earl of Banbury. The report of the attorney-general, Sir Vicary Gibbs, on the case took two years to complete, and was ambiguous, declaring that no final decision about the earldom had been reached in the multitude of proceedings in the case since the 1660s, but suggesting that Nicholas Knollys's legitimacy was doubtful. The petition was referred to the committee of privileges of the House of Lords, who reported after a further five years' discussion that Knollys had not made out his claim. On 15 March 1813 the Lords resolved that Knollys was not entitled to the earldom. The decision was controversial, and sparked a formal protest by eleven peers led by the former lord chancellor, Lord Erskine.<br>
<br>Defeated, Knollys abandoned the use of the title earl of Banbury, and returned to his military career. He had been promoted lieutenant-general in 1808, was lieutenant-governor of St John's, Newfoundland, from 1818 to 1827, was promoted general in 1819, and was governor of Limerick from 1826 until his death in Paris on 20 March 1834, from influenza. His descendants never formally claimed the earldom, although his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15762/', "Sir William Thomas Knollys (1797&#150;1883)")</script> asserted his right to the title in a letter to the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> in 1863 and in his will, and his grandson William Wallingford Knollys (1833&#150;1904) did the same in a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> in 1883. Another grandson was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34351/', "Francis Knollys")</script>, private secretary to Edward VII, who was to return the family to the Lords when he was created Baron Knollys in 1902 and Viscount Knollys in 1911.<br>
