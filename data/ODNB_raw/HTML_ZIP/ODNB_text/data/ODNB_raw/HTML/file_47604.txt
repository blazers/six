<span class="headword">Harrison, Sir  Cyril Ernest</span>  (1901&#150;1980), <span class="occ">cotton industrialist</span>, was born on 14 December 1901 at Sileby gas works, near Leicester, the son of Alfred John Harrison, a gas works manager, and his wife, Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Perry. He was educated at Padiham Wesleyan school and Burnley grammar school, the family having moved to east Lancashire.<br>
<br>Harrison's early career was far from smooth. In 1917, through the influence of his father, he was appointed office boy at Herbert Noble's Perseverance Mill, Padiham, under the impression that he was serving an apprenticeship for a managerial position, but he was soon pushed out to make room for Noble's sons. For a time, Harrison trained as a weaver&#151;a lowly occupation&#151;and then as a fabric dealer on the Manchester Cotton Exchange. On 4 June 1927 he married Ethel (1901/2&#150;1971), daughter of Edward Wood FCA JP, a leading Burnley accountant. The couple had two sons. Having learned the trade, Harrison and a friend, Ralph Harling, set up their own fabric merchanting business, C. E. Harrison &amp; Co., in 1928. After further vocational studies, Harrison qualified as a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Secretaries, and in the 1930s he took an interest in the deliberations of the Burnley chamber of commerce.<br>
<br>Harrison's potential was spotted in 1939, and he was appointed manager of the yarn sales division of English Sewing Cotton (ESC), Britain's second largest producer of cotton thread. It was not considered unusual at that time for someone without a technical or managerial degree to fill an important post in a major company. Harrison's skill at selling thread was not, however, to be put to the test. When war broke out in 1939, market forces in the textile industry were gradually replaced by a system of planning. In 1940 ESC sent Harrison to work for the official Cotton Control, which supervised the rationing of raw cotton supplies, and ensured that each mill gave priority to essential orders. ESC granted Harrison a directorship in 1942, and he became managing director in 1948, and vice-chairman in 1952. The late 1940s were halcyon days for Lancashire; with Japanese and continental European mills temporarily out of contention, British firms could make large profits with ease. Harrison rose to the top at a time when ESC was not exposed to the discipline of market forces, and in 1950 he remained an untried man.<br>
<br>Under Harrison's vigorous leadership, ESC adopted a policy of modernization, investing &pound;4 million in new machinery and other facilities between 1945 and 1955, reforming its manning practices, and revitalizing its marketing procedures. Significant gains were made in productivity. Harrison introduced a pension scheme for operatives, and enjoyed an excellent relationship with the unions. But Lancashire faced a daunting struggle in the 1950s against competition from countries with lower labour costs, and men such as Harrison could do no more than mount a spirited rearguard action. In 1963, Harrison became chairman of ESC. This was a year of crisis in the cotton industry. Courtaulds and ICI, Britain's main producers of man-made fibres, were about to embark on a series of acquisitions of large textile companies and had set their sights on ESC and another firm, Tootal. Harrison was in favour of the creation of larger, multi-process textile groups, but did not relish the prospect of ESC's being absorbed by a bigger firm. As a compromise, he arranged for ESC to purchase Tootal, and for Courtaulds and ICI to accept minority stakes in the enlarged company. Then, in 1968, in order to frustrate a takeover bid by Viyella, and shortly before Harrison's retirement from the chair, ESC merged with the Calico Printers Association, the dominant firm in the textile finishing sector, and adopted the name English Calico. Harrison had saved ESC from extinction, but English Calico was financially weak and unable to compete internationally, a situation not unrepresentative of the Lancashire textile industry as a whole. It would be unfair to blame Harrison for the problems of ESC in the 1960s; it is, of course, much harder to succeed in a declining industry than in one which is expanding.<br>
<br>Harrison was a busy man with many interests. He was active in the Cotton Board, the umbrella organization representing the Lancashire interest, and led a Cotton Board trade mission to Australia and New Zealand in 1959; he was president of the Shirley Institute, the cotton industry's research association; between 1958 and 1960 he was president of the Manchester chamber of commerce. He then served as president of the Federation of British Industries, 1961&#150;3, proving that his performance at ESC in the 1950s was held in high regard in other industries, and he thereafter remained on the grand council of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). He was a member of the National Economic Development Council and the British National Export Council. He was knighted for his services to industry in 1963. Between 1965 and 1972, he was a deputy chairman of William and Glyns Bank, and joined the board of the Royal Bank of Scotland in 1966. He was a member of the North West Electricity Board, sat on the governing council of Manchester University (receiving an honorary MA in 1961), and served on the council of the Manchester Business School. In 1959, he was appointed chairman of the Christie Hospital in Manchester, which specialized in cancer research, and between 1966 and 1974 was chairman of governors of the United Manchester Hospitals. He declined an invitation to become high sheriff of Lancashire in 1970, due to the illness of his wife, who died in 1971. Harrison was a deacon and secretary of Wilmslow Congregational Church for many years. Sir Cyril Harrison died at his home, 8 Harefield Drive, Wilmslow, Cheshire, on 14 March 1980, aged seventy-eight.<br>
