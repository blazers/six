<span class="headword">London,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1653&#150;1660), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, whose parentage, education, and private life are obscure, had a bookshop in Newcastle upon Tyne in the 1650s. His claim to fame derives mainly from <span class="italic">A Catalogue of the most Vendible Books in England</span>, which he published in 1657. In the preface London explained that he wanted to promote knowledge in the northern counties and had therefore compiled this catalogue which contained approximately 4500 titles and was arranged by subject category. The catalogue itself is preceded by &#145;An introduction to the use of books: in a short essay upon the value and benefits of learning and knowledge&#146;. London claimed to be the first to list the books with their full titles, &#145;for a full title tels us the purport and intent of the books&#146; contrary to the usual practice of listing short titles only which &#145;are great deluders and deceivers of mens expectations&#146;. The title-page announces that besides the books in the catalogue maps, globes, paper, and wax may also be bought in his shop. The annual supplements promised are extant for 1658 (as part of the 1658 reissue of the catalogue) and for 1660 (also found as part of a 1660 reissue). The only other work known to be written by London is <span class="italic">The Civil Wars of France</span> (1655) where the author professes to be &#145;a true Protestant, and friend to the Common-wealth of England&#146;. This claim seems to be contradicted by his association with the printer Stephen Bulkley (Buckley) who had to move several times rather hurriedly due to his support for the royalist cause and who printed several anti-Quaker tracts which, according to the imprint, were sold in London's shop. The first of these is J. Gilpin's <span class="italic">The Quakers Shaken</span> (1653). In the preface to his <span class="italic">Catalogue</span> London said that he &#145;will not stop the Currant of a generall knowledg of Books, by leaving out all that are accounted Heterodox&#146;. The <span class="italic">Catalogue</span> was reissued twice with a cancel title-page and was possibly no great success, which may be the reason that the catalogue of Latin books London spoke of in his preface never materialized.<br>
