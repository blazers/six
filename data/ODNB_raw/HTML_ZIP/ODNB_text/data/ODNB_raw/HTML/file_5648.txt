<span class="headword">Clifford,  Henry</span>, second earl of Cumberland  (1517&#150;1570), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest of the six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5647/', "Henry Clifford, first earl of Cumberland (c.1493&#150;1542)")</script>, and his second wife, Margaret (<i>c</i>.1492&#150;1540), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21936/', "Henry Percy, fifth earl of Northumberland")</script>. He was educated at home and then at court, where he spent much of his youth. He also attended the duke of Richmond in the latter's household at Pontefract Castle, and was made knight of the Bath at Queen Anne's coronation in 1533. In June 1535 he married Henry VIII's niece Eleanor (1519&#150;1547), daughter of Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, and Mary, daughter of Henry VII and widow of Louis XII of France. His father built for them the octagonal tower and long gallery extension at Skipton Castle. Clifford escorted Lady Mary Tudor at the funeral of Queen Jane at Windsor on 12 January 1537, and represented his father when Henry VIII met Anne of Cleves in January 1540. That year he served in the king's chamber, as a carver.<br>
<br>Clifford was prominent in the military crises of Henry VIII's later years. In 1536 he rallied the Carlisle townsmen to stand firm against the rebels. He played some part in the defence of the west march in 1541, and from September 1542 until 1544, following his father's death, he was continually employed mustering his Yorkshire tenants and leading them on the borders. He was proposed as warden-general for all the marches, but the king preferred a more experienced man, in John Dudley, Viscount Lisle. Instead, Clifford was appointed to the council of the borders, and was rewarded in 1544 by being added to the council in the north. He repeated this service during Elizabeth I's Scottish campaign of 1559&#150;60. It was his military outlay, rather than court life, which forced him to sell lands during the 1540s. Even so, the rental from his estates at his death amounted to some &pound;2000 per annum.<br>
<br>Clifford was tall, slender, and dark-haired, a learned man with a fine library whose interests were alchemy, astrology, and distilling. These he indulged after Countess Eleanor's death in 1547, a blow which so prostrated the earl that he was laid out for dead, according to family tradition recovering his strength by sucking milk from a woman's breasts; thereafter he retired to his northern castles, rarely visiting the court. He was instrumental with William Ermysted in founding Skipton grammar school. A testimony to his cultural concerns and pride in his royal marriage is the organ he presented to Carlisle Cathedral in 1542. The organ case, of Italian design, displays on its heraldic panels the coats and supporters of the Cliffords and Brandons. The oldest in England, it is now in St Lawrence's, Appleby.<br>
<br>Clifford's absence from court exposed him to political intrigue. His parliamentary patronage in Westmorland and friends in the privy council enabled him to obstruct Thomas, Lord Wharton's bills in 1549 and 1558 to deprive him of his hereditary sheriffwick of Westmorland and punish his servants. He was potentially dangerously exposed in 1553 when his only child, Margaret, heiress to the great Clifford inheritance and with a claim to the throne, was drawn by John Dudley, now duke of Northumberland, into his schemes to achieve his own dynastic ambitions and perpetuate the protestant regime. But Northumberland's proposal, that Margaret should marry his own son Lord Guildford Dudley, came to nothing, and on Mary Tudor's accession Clifford was swift to extricate himself by demonstrating his loyalty to her. His inheritance worries only ceased well after his second marriage in 1554 to Anne (<i>c</i>.1538&#150;1581), daughter of William, third Baron Dacre of Gilsland, with the birth in 1558 of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5645/', "George Clifford, the future third earl (1558&#150;1605)")</script>. (His second son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67095/', "Francis Clifford (1559&#150;1641)")</script>, eventually the fourth earl.) This marriage also served to heal a long-running dispute between the Dacres and the Cliffords.<br>
<br>Clifford's initial support for Queen Mary was unequivocal. A traditionalist in matters of religion, he welcomed her restoration of Catholicism and used his electoral patronage in Westmorland to return members of like mind, but he became disenchanted with her later policies. Under Elizabeth he was accused of protecting popish priests in the north. However, the agreement he reached in 1565 for George's marriage with Margaret, daughter of Francis Russell, second earl of Bedford, signalled his alignment with the strongly protestant group at court under Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester. At the time of the 1569 uprising he was suspected of sympathy, at the very least, with the rebels, but again demonstrated his loyalty to the Tudor crown by holding Brougham Castle for the queen. He died there on 8 January 1570 and was buried in Holy Trinity Church, Skipton.<br>
