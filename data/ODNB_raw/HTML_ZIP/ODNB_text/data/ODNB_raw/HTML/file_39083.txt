<span class="headword">Craig,  Edith Ailsa Geraldine</span>  (1869&#150;1947), <span class="occ">theatre director and costumier</span>, was born on 9 December 1869 at Gustard Wood Common, Hertfordshire, the first of two children of the actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36460/', "Dame Ellen Alice Terry (1847&#150;1928)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10889/', "Edward William Godwin (1833&#150;1886)")</script>, architect, with whom Terry had eloped in 1868. The family lived in Fallows Green, Harpenden, Hertfordshire, designed by Godwin, until 1874. After her separation from Godwin in 1875, Terry was primary carer (helped by housekeeper Mrs &#145;Boo&#146; Rumball) for Edith Craig and her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32608/', "(Edward Henry) Gordon Craig (1872&#150;1966)")</script>. Terry's second husband, Charles Wardell (whom she married in 1877), provided a parental figure for the children such that Edith took the name Wardell. However, Terry's third husband, James Carew (whom she married in 1907), met with Edith Craig's disapproval. Craig was educated at Mrs Cole's school, a co-educational institution in Foxton Road, Earls Court, London; the Royal Academy of Music; by Alexis Hollander in Berlin, Germany from 1887 to 1890; and intermittently by Elizabeth Malleson of Dixton Manor Hall, Winchcombe, Gloucestershire.<br>
<br>Craig worked for the Lyceum Theatre company, designing costumes and acting under the stage name of Ailsa Craig, touring America in 1895 and 1907. Craig appeared with Henry Irving in a number of plays, such as <span class="italic">The Bells</span> (1895) by Leopold Lewis. In 1895 her performances in Sir Arthur Wing Pinero's <span class="italic">Bygones</span> and Charles Reade's <span class="italic">The Lyons Mail</span> respectively were praised by George Bernard Shaw and Eleanora Duse. Craig acted in plays by G. B. Shaw and H. Ibsen, toured with Mrs Brown Potter and the Independent Theatre, and was stage director for her mother on tour after she left the Lyceum Theatre.<br>
<br>With financial backing from her mother Craig started a business, Edith Craig &amp; Co., producing costumes for several London theatre productions. During Terry's lease of the Imperial Theatre, Edith Craig collaborated with her mother and brother on various productions. In 1902&#150;3 she collaborated with the artist Pamela Colman Smith on the design of scenes for W. B. Yeats's <span class="italic">Where there is Nothing</span> and J. M. Synge's <span class="italic">The Well of the Saints</span>. Craig was an active member of several significant theatre societies which produced experimental drama in London; some of them directly challenged the lord chamberlain's regulation of the stage: the Independent Theatre; the Stage Society; the Masquers; the Pioneer Players; the Phoenix Society; and the Renaissance Theatre Society.<br>
<br>Craig was active in the women's suffrage movement, selling newspapers in the street and working at branch level for the Women's Freedom League after getting into conversation with a woman selling its paper in the street. A member of many suffrage organizations, she worked in a professional capacity for the Actresses' Franchise League and independently on numerous successful suffrage productions. Craig notably directed <span class="italic">A Pageant of Great Women</span>, a play she devised with the writer and actor Cicely Hamilton. This was performed nationwide with audiences in some cases of 2000.<br>
<br>Craig consolidated her work as a director with the Pioneer Players (1911&#150;25), the London-based theatre society which she founded. Under Craig's leadership this society became internationally known for promoting women's work in the theatre. It performed significant plays by women such as Susan Glaspell (<span class="italic">Trifles</span>, 1919, and <span class="italic">The Verge</span>, 1925), &#145;Hrotsvit&#146; (<span class="italic">Paphnutius</span>, 1914), and Christopher St John (<span class="italic">The First Actress</span>, 1911, and <span class="italic">Macrena</span>, 1912). It also became renowned for its support of progressive political campaigns and its production of a number of significant translated plays by dramatists such as Paul Claudel, Anton Chekhov, Nikolay Eveinov, and Saint-Georges de Bouhelier.<br>
<br>After the Pioneer Players was effectively wound up in 1920, Craig worked on several productions in London and the provinces. Notable productions included nativity plays in London and York; John Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Faithful Shepherdesse</span> (1923), formerly directed by Craig's father, Godwin; Hugo von Hofmannstahl's <span class="italic">The Great World Theatre</span> (1924); the first modern production of John Webster's <span class="italic">The White Devil</span> (1925); and George Bernard Shaw's <span class="italic">Back to Methuselah</span> (1930). In the 1920s work took Craig to Hampstead, where she directed plays for the Everyman Theatre, and to Yorkshire as art director for Leeds Art Theatre. Craig valued the traditions of stagecraft but she also welcomed innovations in the theatre and film. Her expertise in the latter medium was demonstrated by her performance in <span class="italic">Fires of Fate</span> (1923), a film adaptation of a story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.<br>
<br>After her mother died in 1928, Craig began her campaign for a fitting memorial. In 1929 the barn in the grounds of Ellen Terry's house in Smallhythe Place, Tenterden, Kent, was converted into a theatre where Craig directed performances on the anniversary of Ellen Terry's death. The Priest's House, next door to Ellen Terry's house, Craig's home, became a dynamic cultural centre, attracting Radclyffe Hall and her partner Una Troubridge, together with Vita Sackville West and Virginia Woolf.<br>
<br>Active in teaching and adjudicating amateur theatricals for the British Drama League, the Women's Institute, and the British Empire Shakespeare Society, Craig gave one of the prestigious Shute lectures at the University of Liverpool in 1935. She developed a national reputation for her pageant productions at Mount Grace Priory, Northallerton, Yorkshire (1927) and the Tenterden jubilee pageant (1935). The Chilham pageant (1946) was Craig's last work.<br>
<br>Craig lived with the writer Christabel Marshall (known as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57057/', "Christopher Marie St John")</script>) from 1899, when the two women shared a flat at 7 Smith Square, London. They lived in a flat in Adelphi Terrace House from 1907 to 1909 before moving to 31 Bedford Street, Covent Garden, where they were joined in 1916 by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48921/', "Clare Atwood (known as Tony) (1866&#150;1962)")</script>, the artist, forming a permanent <i>m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois</i> about which George Bernard Shaw urged St John to write. Although Craig rarely wrote, she was involved in some publications relating to her mother and to Bernard Shaw which provoked a rift in the relationship with her brother. Edward Gordon Craig's <span class="italic">Ellen Terry and her Secret Self</span> (1931) explicitly objected to <span class="italic">Ellen Terry and Bernard Shaw: a Correspondence</span> (1931) edited by St John. In 1932 Craig co-edited with St John <span class="italic">Ellen Terry's Memoirs</span>, responding to her brother's representation of their mother. Craig had taken on other family responsibilities that year, having adopted Ruby Chelta Craig, daughter of Edward Gordon Craig's son. Craig was reconciled with her brother some time before her death.<br>
<br>Opinions differed about Craig's personality. Some found her domineering and difficult to work with, while others enthused about her professionalism and inspirational effect on newcomers to the profession. May Whitty remembered her as a &#145;magician&#146;. Craig's friends claimed that she was denied opportunities to establish herself in a permanent theatre; Lilian Baylis is said to have excluded her from a post at the Old Vic. However, Craig worked successfully on several collaborations and was credited with numerous directorial achievements&#151;so much so, that George Bernard Shaw claimed that &#145;Gordon Craig has made himself the most famous producer in Europe by dint of never producing anything, while Edith Craig remains the most obscure by dint of producing everything&#146;  (Holledge, 162). Craig's work in the theatre received national press coverage yet she has rarely featured in theatre histories or biographies or autobiographies of her contemporaries. Overshadowed by her mother and brother, Craig has received recent critical re-evaluation by feminist critics, particularly in the ground-breaking work on Edwardian actresses by Julie Holledge (1981) and Katharine Cockin (1998). Literary portraits of Edith Craig have been claimed for Virginia Woolf's pageant organizer, Miss La Trobe, in <span class="italic">Between the Acts</span> (1941) and for Clemence Dane's possessive daughter, Blanche Carroll, in <span class="italic">Eighty in the Shade</span> (1958).<br>
<br>Rheumatism prevented Craig from pursuing a musical career as a pianist. Later in life she had restricted mobility although she was reluctant to allow this to affect her work. Craig died of coronary thrombosis and chronic myocarditis on 27 March 1947 at Priest's House, Smallhythe Place, Tenterden, Kent, and her body was cremated.<br>
