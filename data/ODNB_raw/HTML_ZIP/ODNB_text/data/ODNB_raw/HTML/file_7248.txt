<span class="headword">Davies,  John</span>  (1679&#150;1732), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born in London on 22 April 1679 and baptized on 13 May at either St Vedast, Foster Lane, or St Michael-le-Querne, London. He was the son of John Davies, merchant, who died while Davies was young, and Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Turton, justice of the court of king's bench. He was educated at the Charterhouse School, and in 1695 matriculated from Queens' College, Cambridge. He graduated BA in 1699, was elected fellow of his college on 7 July 1701, and commenced MA in 1702. In 1709 he was junior proctor of the university. He was ordained deacon at Ely on 21 September 1711, and priest on 23 September, and in that year was collated by Dr John Moore, bishop of Ely, to the rectory of Fen Ditton, near Cambridge, and to a prebend in the church of Ely; he also took the degree of LLD. From 1712 to 1718 he held the rectory of Glemsford, Suffolk, another living in Moore's patronage.<br>
<br>On the death of Dr Henry James, president of Queens' College, Davies was elected to succeed him on 23 March 1717. A fervent whig and supporter of the Hanoverian succession, he was created DD when George I visited Cambridge in the same year. In 1726 he was elected vice-chancellor of the university. At some stage he married Sarah, who is mentioned in his will, but nothing more is known of his marriage.<br>
<br>Davies was a close friend and ally of the eminent classical scholar Richard Bentley. Bentley's scholarly influence can be seen in Davies's correct editions of works by Caesar, Lactantius, and Minucius Felix; his second edition of <span class="italic">Maximi Tyrii dissertationes</span> (1703; 2nd edn, 1740) contained material supplied by Bentley. Davies projected new and beautiful editions of Cicero's philosophical treatises to supplement Graevius's edition of Cicero's works, and accordingly published the first, <span class="italic">Tusculanarum disputationum libri quinque</span>, at Cambridge in 1709; five more volumes were published in the series, and most went to a second edition. Davies had got as far as editing the middle of the third book of Cicero's <span class="italic">Offices</span> when he died, on 7 March 1732 at Fen Ditton. He was buried in Queens' College chapel. In his will he entrusted his unfinished edition of the <span class="italic">Offices</span> to the care of Dr Mead, who gave it to Bentley's nephew Dr Thomas Bentley to prepare for the press. All Davies's notes and emendations were lost in a fire at the house where Bentley lodged, in the Strand, London, caused by his carelessness while reading in bed.<br>
