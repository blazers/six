<span class="headword">Skene,  William Forbes</span>  (1809&#150;1892), <span class="occ">historian and Celtic scholar</span>, the second of seven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25668/', "James Skene (1775&#150;1864)")</script> of Rubislaw, near Aberdeen, and Jane (1787&#150;1862), daughter of Sir William Forbes, sixth baronet, of Pitsligo, Aberdeenshire, was born on 7 June 1809 at Inverie, Kincardineshire. He was educated at the high school of Edinburgh, and there began on his own account to study Gaelic, of which he had some opportunity of learning the rudiments through his maternal relationship with MacDonell of Glengarry, but still more through his being boarded for a time at Laggan, Inverness-shire, with the parish minister, Mackintosh Mackay, on the recommendation of Sir Walter Scott, a close friend of his father.<br>
<br>After a session at the University of Edinburgh, Skene went in 1824 with his elder brother, George, to Hanau, near Frankfurt, where he acquired German and a taste for philology, which he afterwards turned to account in Celtic studies. On his return to Scotland he spent a session at St Andrews University (1825&#150;6), then served a legal apprenticeship under his uncle-in-law, Sir Henry Jardine, passing writer to the signet in 1831. He held a post as a clerk in the court of session, becoming depute clerk of session from 1853 to 1867. He also engaged in private practice, and became senior partner of Skene, Edward, and Bilton, writers to the signet, a position which he retained until his death. It was to Skene's firm that Robert Louis Stevenson was attached in 1872 during his brief flirtation with the law.<br>
<br>While never neglecting his professional duties, Skene had his eye from earliest manhood on highland history and Celtic scholarship. In 1833, with Donald Gregory and others, he founded the Iona Club to promote Celtic history and literature. The club's only publication, <span class="italic">Collectanea de rebus Albanicis</span> (1834; repr. 1847), included Skene's earliest transcription and translation of the famous highland genealogical manuscript now known as MS 1467, but there called MS 1450. In 1837 he published, in two volumes, <span class="italic">The Highlanders of Scotland, their Origin, History, and Antiquities</span>, a landmark in its day, although later research, not least Skene's own, altered many of the views there expressed. In 1862 he contributed an introduction to Thomas M'Lauchlan's pioneering edition of the precious sixteenth-century Gaelic literary manuscript known as the <span class="roman">Book of the Dean of Lismore</span>. Skene's rejection there of the chronological scheme of the older school of Irish antiquaries would now be universally accepted; although his defence of James Macpherson's <span class="italic">Ossian</span> would not.<br>
<br>In 1868 Skene published the manuscripts known as <span class="italic">The Four Ancient Books of Wales</span> (the <span class="roman">Black Book of Carmarthen</span>, the <span class="roman">Book of Aneirin</span>, the <span class="roman">Book of Taliesin</span>, and the <span class="roman">Red Book of Hergest</span>) in two volumes, with a commentary on fifth- and sixth-century British history with particular reference to the <i>Gw&#375;r y Gogledd</i>, the &#145;men of the north&#146;, and to King Arthur, whom Skene took to be a historical character. This ground was not to be traversed again in such scholarly fashion until the publication in 1949 of H. M. Chadwick's <span class="italic">Early Scotland</span>. In 1869 Skene published an <span class="italic">Essay on the Coronation Stone of Scone</span>, in which he overthrew the Scottish legend that this stone was the <i>Lia Fail</i> on which Irish kings were crowned at Tara.<br>
<br>In 1867 Skene edited <span class="italic">The Chronicles of the Picts and the Scots</span>, and in 1871&#150;2 he published for the <span class="roman">Historians of Scotland</span> series a critical edition in two volumes of the <span class="italic">Chronica gentis Scotorum</span> of the fourteenth-century Scottish historiographer John of Fordun, with a translation by his nephew Felix Skene. In the former work he collected for the first time the earliest fragments of Scottish history from Irish and Welsh sources, as well as the older medieval legends and annals which had not been absorbed into the chronicles of Wyntoun and Fordun. In the latter he put into the crucible the <span class="italic">Scotichronicon</span> as published by Walter Goodall in 1759, and by a thorough inspection of the manuscripts distinguished the portion written by Fordun himself from the additions of Walter Bower, and other continuators. He also added several notes, including one on the origins of Scottish thanages. Skene's Fordun has not yet been superseded; and a modern scholarly edition of Bower did not appear until the 1990s.<br>
<br>With his cousin, Bishop Alexander Penrose Forbes of Brechin, Skene reprinted in 1874, in the <span class="roman">Historians of Scotland</span> series, Bishop Reeves's edition of Adomn&aacute;n's <span class="italic">Life of St Columba</span>, with translation and rearranged introduction and notes. Felix Skene's edition of the <span class="italic">Liber pluscardensis</span> in the same series (2 vols., 1877, 1880) incorporated his uncle's argument that the author was Maurice Buchanan, treasurer of Princess Margaret, daughter of James I of Scotland, who was married to Louis XI when dauphin. Skene also edited for the New Spalding Club in 1887 <span class="italic">Memorials of the Family of Skene of Skene</span>.<br>
<br>However, Skene's <i>magnum opus</i>, for which he had prepared all his life, was <span class="italic">Celtic Scotland: a History of Ancient Alban</span>, which appeared in three volumes from 1876 to 1880, taking the story of Scottish history up to 1286. Following in the path indicated by Father Thomas Innes, and with the aid of better and fuller texts, as well as more advanced methods of criticism, both philological and historical, Skene accomplished more for the annals of his native country than any other contemporary writer. He effectively opened out to view a period of more than five centuries, from the reign of Malcolm Canmore back to the time of St Columba. A second edition appeared in 1886&#150;90.<br>
<br>Shortly after Skene's death Alexander Macbain published a paper severely critical of Skene's methods, &#145;Mr Skene <i>versus</i> Dr Skene&#146;. Macbain's main purpose in appealing, as he put it, &#145;from &#147;Skene Young&#148; to &#147;Skene Old&#148;&#146; was due to the fact that Skene's <span class="italic">Highlanders of Scotland</span> of 1837 was all too often preferred by &#145;the popular historian and clan controversialist&#146; to his later, more fully considered <span class="italic">Celtic Scotland</span>. As Macbain demonstrated, Skene's <span class="italic">Highlanders</span> was deeply flawed, and much had been corrected, albeit often silently, in <span class="italic">Celtic Scotland</span>. Even in <span class="italic">Celtic Scotland</span>, Macbain believed that Skene had erred grievously in suggesting that the northern Picts had spoken Gaelic and were the true ancestors of the highland Scots, and in suppressing a century of Dalriadic history before the reign of Kenneth mac Alpin.<br>
<br>Macbain's <i>cri-de-c&#339;ur</i> regarding the reliance of clan historians on Skene's <span class="italic">Highlanders</span> has been echoed by many later scholars. Some writers still do not realize that the MS 1450 of <span class="italic">The Highlanders</span> and the MS 1467 of <span class="italic">Celtic Scotland</span> are one and the same, and that the version in the later book is infinitely preferable to that in the former, despite the fact that Macbain produced a second edition of Skene's <span class="italic">Highlanders</span> with valuable corrective notes in 1902. Macbain included in this volume a short memoir of Skene and there made some amends for his earlier harsh criticism:<blockquote>The Celts of Scotland owe Dr. Skene a deep debt of gratitude, for he was the first to draw their early history out of the slough into which it had got, and to make it respectable. For this end he lent the weight of his learning and position to the cause of the Scottish Celt at a time when it was sorely needed; and he made writers of Scottish history devote fuller attention to the Celtic side of Scottish affairs. (Macbain, &#145;Life of Dr Skene&#146;, xiii&#150;xiv)</blockquote>Macbain's later, more generous opinion has been echoed by later historians. A. O. Anderson shrewdly commented of Skene's critics that &#145;All those that condemn him use his books&#146;  (A. O. Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources of Scottish History: <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 500 to 1286</span>, 1922, 1.lxxxiii). In 1981 Gordon Donaldson, like Skene historiographer royal for Scotland, noted that <span class="italic">Celtic Scotland</span>, for all its flaws, had not been superseded. Only in the 1990s, one hundred years after his death, is Skene's account of Celtic Scotland gradually being replaced.<br>
<br>Skene was a keen supporter of St Vincent's Episcopal Church in Edinburgh and was instrumental in the union of that congregation with the Scottish Episcopal church. He wrote a <span class="italic">Gospel History for the Young</span> in three volumes (1883&#150;4). He acted as secretary to the relief committee in the highlands, set up because of the potato famine from 1846 to 1850. He was also for many years a director of the Commercial Bank of Scotland. Skene received the honorary degrees of LLD and DCL from the universities of Edinburgh and Oxford respectively. He was appointed historiographer royal for Scotland in 1881 on the death of John Hill Burton. Skene died at his home, 27 Inverleith Row, Edinburgh, on 29 August 1892. He never married, but brought up as a father several members of the family of one of his nieces.<br>
<br>As Aeneas Mackay rightly concluded, in his <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> article:<blockquote>Skene had many advantages for the task of a Scottish historian: a talented father, an intellectual home, a boyhood spent in the atmosphere of Walter Scott, a thorough knowledge of the Highlands and its inhabitants, a taste for languages and philology, especially Celtic, with opportunities for cultivating it both at home and abroad, ample preparation by the study of Celtic sources at first hand, and a long life. Yet all these would not have sufficed had he not possessed an historic instinct and a patriotic desire to enlarge the boundaries of the history of Scotland and throw new light on its darkest age.</blockquote>
