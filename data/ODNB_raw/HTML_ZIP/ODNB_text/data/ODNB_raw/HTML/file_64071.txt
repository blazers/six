<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tubbs,  Ralph Sydney</span>  (1912&#150;1996), <span class="occ">architect and exhibition designer</span>, was born on 9 January 1912 at Banavie, The Crescent, Hadley Wood, Hertfordshire, the youngest of the four sons of Sydney Walter Tubbs (1876&#150;1940), chartered accountant, and his wife, Mabel Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Frost (1877&#150;1948). He was educated at Mill Hill School and trained at the Architectural Association, London (1930&#150;35), before working unpaid for a year with Ern&ouml; Goldfinger to learn about modern construction. Tubbs was briefly an assistant to Walter Gropius and Maxwell Fry, which he found less stimulating, before returning to work on Goldfinger's own house at 2 Willow Road, Hampstead. In the interim he joined the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96308', "Modern Architecture Research (MARS) Group")</script>, then in the vanguard of thinking on modernism, and exhibited a model of a bandstand at its major exhibition in January 1938. At a time when there was little work for architects committed to the modern movement in architecture, Tubbs found a niche in exhibition design, producing an exhibit on town planning for the British pavilion of the New York World's Fair (1939&#150;40).<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Tubbs was deemed unfit for military service on account of a permanent limp caused by a school sports injury. Instead he worked on the design of munitions factories, in collaboration with Ralph Freeman of the civil engineering firm Freeman, Fox &amp; Partners, and also joined the night watch at St Paul's Cathedral. In 1939 he became secretary of the dispersed MARS group and in 1940 designed &#145;Living in Cities&#146;, an exhibition for the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts, in which he reviewed past instances of urban planning and stressed the need for sensitivity in post-war design. &#145;The city should be a place of happiness for everyone&#146;, somewhere &#145;to live in and not &hellip; merely worked in and escaped from at nights&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 28 Oct and 5 Nov 1941). In 1942 Tubbs produced a book of the same title which sold 134,000 copies, and in October of that year he staged another exhibition, &#145;The Englishman Builds&#146; (National Gallery, London)&#151;a history of architecture, landscape, and culture&#151;which three years later was also published in book form. On 7 November 1946, at St Mary's Church, Friston, Sussex, he married (Edith) Mary Taberner (<i>b</i>. 1923), daughter of William Howard Taberner, civil servant; the couple had two sons and one daughter. Between 1944 and 1951 Tubbs sat on the RIBA council and executive committee, during which time he was also vice-president of the Architectural Association (1945&#150;7), prior to his re-election to the RIBA council in 1951.<br>
<br>Tubbs's most significant building was also for an exhibition, and it acquired a fame out of all proportion to its eleven-month life. This was the Dome of Discovery, built beside the River Thames for the Festival of Britain (1951), for which Tubbs was appointed one of the co-ordinating architects, alongside Hugh Casson and Misha Black, in April 1949. Tubbs's initial proposal, to make a pedestrian thoroughfare from Trafalgar Square to the South Bank site, was frustrated by limits on materials; thereafter he focused on the dome while Casson and Black organized the architects who worked on the smaller buildings around it.<br>
<br>The first plan for the site appears to have been for a round, semi-subterranean structure to display developments in mining and tunnelling. However, the chance receipt of an advertisement for an aluminium dome inspired something more ambitious. With his wartime experience of factory construction, and the technical expertise this brought, Tubbs was the natural choice to design the dome, on which he again worked with Ralph Freeman as the project's consulting engineer. As befitted the festival, Tubbs's design was spectacular. At 365 feet in diameter (a figure deliberately chosen to be memorable), rising to 95 feet at its crest, it was both the world's biggest dome and the largest aluminium structure, and was more than twice the size of the Perisphere at the New York World's Fair. The dome's structure was based on a series of concentric circles, over which were laid ribbed arches in three directions to create a lattice of triangular sections, enclosed by a continuous aluminium wall. This made for an economical and light structure able to expand and contract, yet braced against wind from any direction. The dome was the festival's principal exhibition space with exhibits set on a series of balconies supported on massive concrete fins; these were linked by open staircases from a central platform, reached via what was then Britain's longest unsupported escalator.<br>
<br>In contrast to the open-air setting of much of the festival site, the dome's interior was artificially lit; for many visitors the relative darkness and the numerous exhibits detracted from the beauty of Tubbs's design. Nevertheless, there was a prominent campaign to save the dome after the festival's closure in September 1951. Tubbs and Freeman estimated the cost of its removal to Crystal Palace, which was then being acquired as a park by the London county council. However, the Conservative minister of works, David Eccles, refused time for the matter to be properly debated in parliament and the dome was demolished, its aluminium sold back to its suppliers for a fraction of the original cost. For his contribution to the festival Tubbs was appointed OBE in 1952, in which year he also became a fellow of the RIBA.<br>
<br>In the decade after the festival Tubbs became known for a small number of carefully thought-out institutional buildings, of which the first was the Indian YMCA student hostel on Fitzroy Square, London, opened in 1952. This was a light structure&#151;clad in brick and stone panels with long bands of windows&#151;which retained the proportions of Robert Adams's neighbouring terraces. Internally the hostel's tight plan was enlivened by festival-style setting staircases and walls at angles. Constructed when controls on materials and public building were at their height, the hostel (which Tubbs extended in 1962&#150;4) proved a major addition to the canon of humane British modernism.<br>
<br>Tubbs repeated this mix of spaces and non-orthogonal proportions at Baden Powell House, Queen's Gate, Kensington, commissioned in 1956 and opened in 1961. The finished building&#151;which comprised a hall, library, common room, and two floors of dormitories&#151;displayed Tubbs's characteristic attention to detail in all areas of a design; indeed for one reviewer it was &#145;the workaday parts of the building, the Scouts' bathrooms and kitchens&#146; that were &#145;the aesthetic high points&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 10 July 1961, 17). After the Indian YMCA and Baden Powell House, Tubbs was commissioned in 1961 to construct four halls of residence for University College, London. Though he did not court commercial commissions, Tubbs also worked closely in this period with the entrepreneur Sidney Bernstein on the building of new offices and studios for Granada Television on Quay Street, Manchester. Tubbs's curtain-walled office slab&#151;crowned with large, red signage&#151;became a powerful addition to the skyline in 1960 and remains one of the city's very few post-war office buildings of genuine quality. Other commissions outside the capital include the delicate brick Institute of Education for Cambridge University (1963&#150;4), and housing schemes in Basildon and Harlow new towns.<br>
<br>Tubbs's later career was dominated by another London commission, the rebuilding of Charing Cross and Fulham hospitals on the site of the latter, for which he was commissioned in 1959. Work began in 1963 with a two-storey building, enabling part of the Fulham Hospital to be demolished and replaced by a sixteen-storey ward block. Built to a cross plan between 1966 and 1972, the new Charing Cross Hospital opened in January of the following year, though some facilities were not operational until as late as 1984. Tubbs's design demonstrated his concern not only with the interrelationship of the hospital's departments, but also for good architectural and landscape design to render large-scale buildings on a human scale. &#145;Everywhere I have tried to make it as unfrightening as possible for patients&#146; he commented in 1973, extolling the cruciform design as a means of making a large building seem more intimate  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13 Jan 1973): &#145;Patients going to hospital are naturally anxious and need an architecture which is very sympathetic&#146;  (<span class="italic">Building</span>, 26 Oct 1984). He was disappointed that discussions of his career invariably focused on the Dome of Discovery and overlooked later works, in particular Charing Cross Hospital, where his compact plan offered an alternative to the &#145;racetrack&#146; corridor patterns then favoured by specialist hospital architects.<br>
<br>Ralph Tubbs was a quiet, extremely charming man with a firm commitment to seeking &#145;humanity and joy&#146; in architecture  (<span class="italic">Building Design</span>, 6 Dec 1996). In addition to architecture he was a dedicated and knowledgeable entomologist, and served as vice-president of the Royal Entomological Society of London (1982&#150;4). He lived at 9 Lingfield Road, Wimbledon, south London, before his death, from septicaemia and subacute bacterial endocarditis, at St George's Hospital, Tooting, on 24 November 1996. He was survived by his wife and three children, and was buried on 2 December at Putney Vale cemetery following a funeral service at St John's Church, Wimbledon.<br>
