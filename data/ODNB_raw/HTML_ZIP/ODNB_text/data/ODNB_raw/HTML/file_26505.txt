<span class="headword">Stewart, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1670?), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was probably the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26504/', "Robert Stewart, first earl of Orkney (1533&#150;1593)")</script>, and his wife, Jean Kennedy (<i>d</i>. 1598), who had been born by 1584. Through their common grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14591/', "James V")</script>, Robert was a kinsman of James VI and I, and his financial misfortunes and foreign engagements can be traced in some detail in Jacobean state papers. It is likely that he was the same Sir Robert Stewart who served as a royalist army officer, constant in his allegiance to the king in Ireland in the 1640s. However, the civil-war soldier has also been identified as the third son of Archibald Stewart of Bardyce, Wigtownshire, and younger brother of Sir William Stewart (<i>d</i>. 1662). Robert and William served together in the civil wars: the latter was an undertaker for the plantation of Ulster and MP for co. Donegal in 1613&#150;15; and the two men served together in Ulster in the 1640s. If Sir Robert was indeed William's brother he married Helen McKie, daughter of John McKie of Palgown, Dumfriesshire, with whom he had a son and daughter, George and Agnes. However, while it is possible that the careers of two men named Sir Robert Stewart, sharing experience in the armies of Sweden, have been conflated into one long life, on balance it seems most likely that the Jacobean courtier and the civil-war army officer who was governor of Culmore by 1638 were one and the same man, the earl of Orkney's son.<br>
<br>By the time the courtier Stewart accompanied his royal kinsman to England he had been knighted. On 3 July 1604 he was granted letters of denization. His name crops up in the state papers and the correspondence of Robert Cecil, seeking and receiving places and positions of profit. He became a gentleman of the privy chamber and received the grant for life of the keepership of Bewdley Park, Worcestershire, and Ticknall House, Derbyshire; he also sought a monopoly to police the proper keeping of parish registers, for a fee of a shilling a year from each parish. He needed to be bailed out of his financial difficulties on several occasions. In early 1605 both the king and Cecil wrote supporting his pursuit of the eleven-year-old daughter of Frances Stallinge. Stewart continued to press his suit even after the child's mother had politely but firmly turned him away. She explained to Cecil:<blockquote>I always wished him to take all opportunities for his best fortune elsewhere and not to rely upon marriage with my daughter, considering how unfit it were for him to stay until she were of ripe years, being yet but a child, and that it was uncertain how she would be affected towards him hereafter. (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 17.152)</blockquote>The following year Stewart had to be rescued from debtors' prison over a debt of &pound;1600 by his kinsman Lord Lindores, who in turn had to appeal to the king for money the following year when he found himself pursued by both Stewart's and his own creditors.<br>
<br>There seems to have been more to Stewart than seeking after place and a dowry, however. In 1608 he served in the suppression of the short-lived rising in Ulster of Sir Cahir O'Doherty, who succeeded in capturing Culmore and Derry. The following year, when it was decided to send 800 men from Ireland to serve as mercenaries in the armies of the king of Sweden as part of the policy to remove kerns (swordsmen) loyal to Hugh O'Neill, second earl of Tyrone, from Ulster, Stewart's name was put forward to command it. The king's initial resistance to the idea (&#145;For satisfaction of the competitors, he cares not greatly for the satisfaction of Sir Robert Steward, but refers all that to your determination&#146;, Cecil was told) in the event proved entirely justified  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 20.193). In September 1609, while Sir Arthur Chichester, the lord deputy, was waiting in Dublin for his arrival, Stewart was in London interceding on behalf of Sir John Kennedy who had been accused by his wife of bigamy, cruelty, and adultery. Stewart apparently reached Ireland in early October (ambiguity is caused by Chichester's referring to him as &#145;Sir William&#146; in a letter of 8 October).<br>
<br>The small fleet of three ships sailed that month but only got as far as Newcastle upon Tyne. Early in December Stewart was arrested in London for a debt of &pound;2500 which he had owed to the now-dead Lindores, and which was being claimed by the latter's son-in-law James Leslie. In dispute was partly whether &pound;2500 paid by the crown to Lindores had been as a reward for service or to pay off the debts of Stewart's he had taken on, and great efforts were made by senior ministers to block Leslie's suit. In January 1610 the king granted Stewart the &#145;tops and lops&#146; in the royal parks, but even if he succeeded in evading Leslie's claims, his financial situation remained parlous; a year later he sought the right to two trees out of every hundred decayed or fuel trees, as the earlier grant was not enough to cover his debts. In May 1611 he took refuge at the court at Greenwich to escape his creditors. His debts, he explained to Cecil, were a round sum, but he hoped that the king would pay them as he had neither the liberty nor means to pursue ways of improving his lot himself.<br>
<br>The way out of this situation was to find Stewart employment overseas, and in August 1611 he left England for Sweden. His attempt to involve James VI and I in diplomatic mediation between the kings of Denmark and Sweden was rebuffed in December 1611. He may be the Robert Stewart who served as a lieutenant in the regiment of Samuel Cockburn between 1611 and 1617. In 1617 he was granted lands to the value of &pound;100 in the planted Ulster counties of Leitrim, Cavan, and Fermanagh. In 1623, with Captain Butler, he attempted to raise 8000&#150;10,000 troops for the service of Sigismund III, king of Poland, which he was to command in a planned Polish&#150;Spanish attack on Sweden. The Swedish ambassador was successful in blocking Stewart's scheme, persuading James VI and I to withdraw his unconditional consent to a levy designed to attack a Christian monarch. By the summer of 1624 the king was able to assure the ambassador that he doubted that Stewart's force would ever come to anything given what he had imposed on it in the way of the logistical problems and the conditions (which included not landing on any Swedish territory or fighting the Swedes anywhere). The king also made clear that he would not be answerable for any debts that Stewart might end up owing Sigismund. A significant proportion of the levy, a mix of Gaelic Irish, Ulster Scots, English, and Old English, never reached Poland and many were later arrested &#145;lurking on obscure places&#146; by the Scottish authorities  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, <i>1622&#150;5</i>, 364).<br>
<br>Stewart's dealings with Catholic Poland were clearly just business. He rejoined the Swedish army, in 1629 serving at the siege of W&uuml;rzburg in Alexander Hamilton's regiment, and later becoming colonel of Lumsden's pikemen. He was sent on recruiting missions to Britain and Ireland in 1635 and 1637, in the latter year raising Irish troops. However, by the following year he had left Swedish service to serve Charles I in Ireland. On 11 April 1638 Stewart was appointed governor of the strategic fort at Culmore on Lough Foyle guarding the entrance to the port of Londonderry. He was returned as MP for the city in the Irish parliament of 1639. After the outbreak of the Irish rising in October 1641 his military experience was invaluable. Even more than Sir William Stewart he was the natural choice of commander for the hastily assembled militia forces raised from the largely Scots (but also English) settlers in the Laggan district of Donegal and north-west Ulster. His position was officially sanctioned by a commission of 16 November from Charles I to raise 1000 foot and a troop of horse. The Laggan, or &#145;British&#146;, forces acted almost independently, managing to hold their own against the disorganized Irish levies and securing a home base in the areas around Derry and Raphoe. Stewart's troops were initially deployed in a mainly defensive and reactive posture because of a lack of supplies from either Dublin or England though they did manage to relieve other isolated protestant garrisons such as that of Sir Audley Mervyn at Augher in Fermanagh, and to defeat Sir Phelim O'Neill at Glenmaquin in June 1642.<br>
<br>Living off the land allowed Stewart and the Laggan forces to take the offensive against the Irish, raiding as far as co. Monaghan, capturing and burning Strabane, even surprising and heavily defeating Eoghain Ruadh O'Neill (Owen Roe O'Neill) near Clones on 13 June, and capturing many officers who had travelled from the continent to Ireland. These successes were undoubtedly facilitated by the arrival in east Ulster between April and July 1642 of a Scots army paid by the English parliament under the command of another continental veteran, Major-General Robert Monro. Lack of munitions and the scarcity of provisions in the ravaged province prevented Stewart from following up his achievements. On the death of Sir John Vaughan in 1643, after forceful lobbying by the royalist commander James Butler, marquess of Ormond, Stewart was appointed in April governor of Londonderry over Sir William Stewart, whose sympathies were with the covenanters and lords justices. He was replaced as governor of Londonderry by Sir Audley Mervyn in 1644.<br>
<br>Stewart's position as a royalist became increasingly difficult. He was fully inclined to obey Ormond's orders but though the British regiments in Ulster were generally well disposed to Charles I they were in a poor state, unpaid since the beginning of the war and lacking in all essential supplies, while most of the rank and file could not stomach the cessation of arms between the king and the Irish confederates in September 1643. His difficulties were exacerbated by the proclamation of the solemn league and covenant in September and its condemnation by the lords justices at Dublin in December. Unless he joined the Scots and complied with parliament Stewart could not hope for supply, and unless he accepted the covenant he might lose authority over his troops, or Monro might attack and impose the covenant by force. In addition he had been ordered by Ormond to keep Monro's forces in Ulster. In January 1644 it was privately agreed by Stewart, Lord Montgomery of Ards, and others to remain loyal to king and Ormond, and not to accept the covenant, nor any other commander over them. Stewart was finally forced to comply in April 1644 when Monro was issued with a commission from parliament to command all the English and Scots forces in Ulster.<br>
<br>Resupplied by the committee of both kingdoms, Stewart routed an Irish cavalry force near Sligo on 17 August 1645 and captured the town itself on 8 October. He was appointed governor in June following. His troops were fortunate to escape the destruction of Monro's army by Owen Roe O'Neill at Benburb on 5 June 1646 and Stewart was able to retreat and consolidate at Derry. In December 1648 Sir Charles Coote seized the city on behalf of parliament and arrested Stewart after luring him from Culmore on the pretext of attending a baptism. He was sent a prisoner to London but managed to escape in January 1649. On 26 May he rejoined his troops besieging the parliamentarian army at Londonderry and on Ormond's instructions surrendered Sligo to Ulick Burke, marquess of Clanricarde, on 7 July. Undoubtedly ill at ease with the new alliance of Catholics and protestants in the royalist camp, he none the less remained in Ireland after his forces were driven off and defeated at Derry in early August by the unlikely combination of parliamentarian and Ulster Irish forces under Sir Charles Coote and Owen Roe O'Neill. He voted at the council of war on 23 August to defend Drogheda.<br>
<br>After the royalist collapse in Ireland, Stewart retired to Scotland. The <span class="roman">Settlement Act</span> for Ireland of 12 August 1652 excepted him from pardon for life and estate. At the Restoration he regained the governorship of Culmore, and was reappointed governor of Londonderry, city and county, and given a company of foot. He was superseded in most of these positions on 17 September 1661 by Colonel John Gorges, though he seems to have retained the governorship of Culmore. On 22 May 1662 he was appointed a trustee for the officers of 1649. He probably died at the end of 1670, this being when he was succeeded as governor of Culmore.<br>
