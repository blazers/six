<span class="headword">Parker,  Mary Ann</span>  (1765/6&#150;1848), <span class="occ">traveller</span>, was a physician's daughter but her parents' names are unknown. Nothing is known of her early life save that she lived three years in Spain as a very young child. She was evidently a well-educated woman who had travelled widely in Europe and was fluent in Spanish. She was originally reputed to be beautiful in face and figure, but smallpox left its marks on her. Before 1790 she married John Parker (1749?&#150;1794), captain in the Royal Navy, and they had four children. Their two sons died early but their two daughters survived. John Parker was a veteran of the siege of Gibraltar (1779&#150;83) and in 1791 he was sent on the <i>Gorgon</i> to relieve the starving convict colony at Port Jackson, New South Wales. Mary Parker accompanied him on a journey which took them around the world before they returned to London by June 1792.<br>
<br>On 4 August 1794 John Parker died of yellow fever off Martinique leaving Mary Parker and their children in very difficult circumstances. She began to write an account of her experiences to raise money. An adroit publicity campaign was engineered on her behalf by Joseph Budworth with the help of John Nichols, publisher of the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. Budworth, a Sloane Street neighbour in London, and like John Parker a veteran of the siege of Gibraltar, drew attention to Mary Parker's situation with the publication of his <span class="italic">Siege of Gibraltar: a Poem</span> (1795) for her benefit, advertising her forthcoming narrative and filling her subscription list. The list was substantial, and drew on literary, naval, and militia connections, and on loyalist sentiment of a sometimes intensely particularist kind, finding tight pockets of local patriotism in Sloane Street and the Lancashire town of Blackburn. Surviving distinguished veterans of the siege signed up, as did dozens of navy pay-office employees; Budworth's London sociability provided members of the Society of Antiquaries, the Trent Club, and others in the highly charged loyalist atmosphere of the time.<br>
<br>Parker's <span class="italic">Voyage Round the World, in the Gorgon Man of War</span> appeared in 1795. The author presented herself as the conventional private, financially embarrassed, reluctant woman writer, and apologized for the book's &#145;brevity and other greater demerits&#146;, attributing these faults to her predicament as &#145;nurse, and being obliged to attend so much to her domestic concerns&#146;  (Parker, preface). Despite her frank admission that she was publishing for money, Parker was no sensationalist. Constrained by her genteel persona, she did not dwell on the sufferings of her long journey, though she was immediately so violently seasick that she was close to &#145;desert[ing] &hellip; &amp; waver[ed] between Husband &amp; Children&#146;, noticed the officer John Gardner; nor did she ever emphasize the &#145;rare circumstance&#146;, as a reviewer put it, of seeing &#145;a female name in the list of circumnavigators&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, 20, 1796, 112). Instead, her narrative is brisk, matter of fact, and entertaining, enlivened by the &#145;little dash of satire&#146; in her personality observed by Gardner. At ports of call&#151;Tenerife, Cape Town, Port Jackson&#151;she gives a lively account of her social life, interspersed with descriptions of the personalities of her many hosts and hostesses, and observations on landscape, local customs, and manners. The second half of the book is given over to Port Jackson, where she left the impression of &#145;a very amiable intelligent Woman&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journals and Letters of Elizabeth Macarthur</span>, 34). Sections of her husband's log, minutes, and reports are included, as are his whaling notes; his eyewitness government report on the dreadful condition of Third Fleet transportees; and details of the spectacular electrical storm which greeted the <i>Gorgon</i>'s arrival, where Parker memorializes her husband and Gibraltar, likening the latter to &#145;a besieged garrison&#146;  (Parker, chap. 5). She praises Governor Phillip's regime as benign and paternal, devoting a chapter to the natives of New Holland.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">A Voyage</span> was well received thanks to Nichols but, despite proceeds from it, her pension, and Budworth's book, within a year Parker, in &#145;great distress&#146;, was receiving money from the Literary Fund. Happily, Nichols, Budworth, and several subscribers were also Literary Fund committee members, and her appeals were repeated through to 1804, when she lost her house and was confined for debt, &#145;within the Gloomy Walls of a prison&#146;&#151;the Fleet&#151;&#145;this horrid abode&#146;  (<span class="italic">Archives of the Royal Literary Fund</span>, Case 39: a, 6, 8). Little is known of her later life. She died aged eighty-two at the house of her son-in-law Robert Vincent, in Connaught Terrace, Edgware Road, London, on 30 August 1848.<br>
