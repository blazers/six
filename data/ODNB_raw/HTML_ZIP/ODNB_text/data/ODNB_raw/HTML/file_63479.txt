<span class="headword">Maxwell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Brisbane]</span>,  Darcy</span>, Lady Maxwell of Pollok  (1742/3&#150;1810), <span class="occ">follower of Methodism and philanthropist</span>, was born at Brisbane in Largs, Ayrshire, the youngest daughter of Thomas Brisbane. She was educated at home and in Edinburgh. On 19 February 1760, aged seventeen, she married Sir Walter Maxwell (1732&#150;1762) of Pollok in Nithsdale. Sir Walter died on 29 April 1762 when Lady Maxwell was nineteen, and six weeks later their only child, a son, also died. This double bereavement had a profound effect on Lady Maxwell, resulting in a religious conversion: &#145;I see that God requires my whole heart, and He shall have it&#146;  (Lancaster, 7). Although she took no vow, she effectively consecrated herself to a celibate life, steadfastly refusing to remarry, despite many offers. She lived in or near Edinburgh after her husband's death.<br>
<br>In 1764 Lady Maxwell became acquainted with John Wesley and a close lifelong friendship ensued. They corresponded regularly. When Wesley died in 1791 Lady Maxwell was delivered from grief by a quasi-visionary experience in which she &#145;saw&#146; Wesley in heaven, worshipping before the throne of God. Although she had been brought up religiously in the Church of Scotland, from 1764 she worshipped in a Wesleyan chapel and joined a Methodist society. However, she still went to the Church of Scotland for holy communion&#151;that ordinance not being generally available in Methodist chapels. In the great Calvinist&#150;Arminian controversy among evangelicals, she sided decisively with Wesley's Arminianism. She also espoused Wesley's doctrine of &#145;Christian perfection&#146;, claiming in 1787 that she had herself been perfected in love. Lady Maxwell's Arminianism and perfectionism strained her working relationship with the other leading female Scottish evangelical, the Calvinist Lady Glenorchy, although their personal friendship endured unscathed.<br>
<br>Despite her gentry status Lady Maxwell dressed plainly and simply, and ran a fairly spartan household, in order to devote her wealth to philanthropic enterprises. In July 1770 she established a school for poor children in Edinburgh, managing its finances and superintending its activities personally. She also gave strong backing to the nascent Sunday school movement of Robert Raikes, founding two such schools in Edinburgh and one in London. Further, she financially supported a steady stream of evangelical students training for the ministry in Edinburgh University.<br>
<br>A contemporary pen-portrait by William Atherton, reproduced in Lancaster's biography, described Lady Maxwell as tall, slender, well-proportioned, and slightly dark in complexion, her face bold and intelligent, and her eyes piercing but sweet. Her central significance for her own day was the profound impression she made on her society&#151;a prominent female member of the Scottish social &eacute;lite whose life and personality were wholly surrendered to evangelical religion. Others found her an awe-inspiring, angelic figure. Lady Maxwell's religious experience was intense, and distinctive in its focus on the Trinity; she lived in an almost unbroken consciousness of all three persons of the godhead, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, whom she referred to habitually as &#145;the Sacred Three&#146;. Her diary and letters are a rich mine of spiritual reflections and recorded experiences. Lady Maxwell died in Edinburgh on 2 July 1810 after a long illness and was buried in the city's Greyfriars churchyard.<br>
