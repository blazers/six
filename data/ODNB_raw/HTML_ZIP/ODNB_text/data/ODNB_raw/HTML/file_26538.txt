<span class="headword">Stisted, Sir  Henry William</span>  (1817&#150;1875), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, son of Charles Stisted, lieutenant-colonel of the 3rd hussars (<i>d</i>. 1842), and his wife, Eliza, daughter of Major-General Burn, was born at St Omer, France. After Sandhurst he was commissioned ensign in the 2nd foot on 4 December 1835, and served with them in Afghanistan and Baluchistan, taking part in the storming of Ghazni, where he was wounded at the gateway, the capture of Kalat, and the occupation of Kabul. In 1845 he married Maria, sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4136/', "Sir Richard Francis Burton")</script>.<br>
<br>On 19 April 1850 Stisted was gazetted lieutenant-colonel of the 78th foot, and in the Anglo-Persian War of 1856&#150;7 commanded a brigade in the night attack and battle of Khushab, and took charge of his own regiment at the bombardment of Muhammarah, after which he received the thanks of the governor-general. He commanded the advanced guard of Havelock's force at the relief of Lucknow on 25 September 1857, when on Brigadier-General James George Smith Neill being killed, he was appointed to command the 1st brigade. That post he held until the close of the operations, when, on 1 January 1858, he was nominated CB. In that year he served also in Rohilkhand, and commanded the 2nd brigade at the battle of Bareilly on 7 May. He became lieutenant-colonel of the 93rd foot on 30 September 1859, and served with the field force against the peoples on the north-west frontier in December 1863.<br>
<br>Stisted was nominated to a divisional command in Canada in 1867, and appointed lieutenant-governor of Ontario in June of the same year. For his services in this capacity he received the thanks of the governor-general of Canada, and was nominated a KCB on 20 May 1871. On 5 February 1873 he was appointed a lieutenant-general, and was nominated colonel of the 93rd foot on 28 September 1873. He died at Wood House, Upper Norwood, Surrey, on 10 December 1875.<br>
