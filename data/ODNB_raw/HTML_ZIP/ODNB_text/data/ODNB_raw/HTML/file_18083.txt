<span class="headword">Marmion,  Shackerley</span>  (1603&#150;1639), <span class="occ">playwright and poet</span>, was born in the village of Aynho in Northamptonshire on 21 January 1603, the eldest of four children of Shackerley Marmion (1575&#150;1642) and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lukyn (<i>d</i>. 1632). The family estate at Aynho had been secured by the playwright's great-grandfather Rowland Shackerley, who died in 1565. Shackerley Marmion senior was the eldest son of Thomas Marmion of Lincoln's Inn, who died in 1583 but who in 1577 had married Mary, the youngest daughter of Rowland Shackerley of Aynho. He married Mary, the daughter of Bartrobe Lukyn, a London gentleman, on 16 June 1600 at the church of St Dunstan-in-the-West  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Collectanea</span>, 5.518). He evidently encountered financial difficulties and mortgaged part of his estate to Sir Thomas Penyston of Stanton in Buckinghamshire; in 1615 he sold his remaining interest in the estate at Aynho to Richard Cartwright of London. By 22 June 1616 the family had moved to Adderbury in Oxfordshire and thereafter there is no further reference to them there. A reference appears in the parish records of the church of St Bartholomew in Smithfield of the burial in 1632 of Mary Marmion, presumed to be the playwright's mother, and there is a further record of the burial of a Shackerley Marmion in the register of the church of St Margaret's, Westminster, dated 5 September 1642.<br>
<br>Marmion was educated at Thame School under the tutelage of Richard Butcher and proceeded thereafter to Wadham College, Oxford, as a commoner, in 1618. His caution money was received on 28 April 1618 and he matriculated on 6 February 1621; he obtained his BA on 1 March 1622 and proceeded to his MA on 7 July 1624. There is no record of Marmion's activities between the years 1625 and 1629, although it is thought that following graduation, and as an impoverished member of the gentry, his father sent him into the Netherlands, where he may have become part of a troop commanded by Sir Sigismund Alexander, identified by Marion Jones as Sir Alexander Zinzan.<br>
<br>Marmion was back in England by 11 July 1629 and living in the parish of St Giles-in-the-Fields, in the highway of St Giles, since on that date he is alleged to have attacked a certain Edward Moore, wounding him in the head. He was released on bail of &pound;80, &pound;20 having been put up by his father, a further &pound;20 by one Richard Browne, and a further &pound;40 by Marmion himself, and ordered to appear on the following 1 September. Nothing more is heard of the case but it had evidently been resolved satisfactorily by December 1631, the date when Marmion's first play, <span class="italic">Hollands Leaguer</span>, was performed by the newly constituted Prince Charles's Men at the Salisbury Court theatre. Marmion took the title of his play from a celebrated event involving the siege of a brothel run by the notorious Southwark prostitute Elizabeth Holland; the siege had become the subject of popular ballads and an anti-Catholic prose account by Nicholas Goodman. The play was entered in the Stationers' register on 26 January 1632 by John Grove and was printed by John Beale, but only after the master of the revels, Sir Henry Herbert, had demanded certain &#145;alterations&#146;. In addition to the heavy influence of the writings of Ben Jonson that play reveals an awareness of the conflict between platonic and profane love, which had also been the subject of the court masques <span class="italic">Love's Triumph through Callipolis</span> and <span class="italic">Chloridia</span>, both of which were performed at court in January and February 1631.<br>
<br>Marmion's second play, <span class="italic">A Fine Companion</span>, was performed at the Salisbury Court theatre in 1633 by the Prince's Men and also received a royal performance at Whitehall before Charles I and his queen. The play took its title from a well-known dance (printed by Playford in 1652) and appeared in the same year that Charles I reissued James I's declaration of sports, which had been originally formulated in 1618; its emphasis on festivity indicates a degree of sympathy with Charles's championing of such &#145;sports&#146;. The play was entered in the Stationers' register on 15 June 1633 by the bookseller Richard Meighen and was printed in quarto shortly afterwards by Augustine Mathewes, with a dedicatory epistle to Sir Ralph Dutton, Marmion's third cousin and a distant relative of Sir Christopher Hatton, Elizabeth I's &#145;dancing chancellor&#146;. Such was Marmion's burgeoning reputation that Richard Meighen solicited from him a poem dedicated to the actor Joseph Taylor, who had performed in John Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Faithful Shepherdess</span> before the king and queen on twelfth night 1633, and which Meighen printed as part of the quarto that he published in 1634.<br>
<br>Although Marmion's third play, <span class="italic">The Antiquary</span>, was not entered in the Stationers' register until 11 March 1639 and was not printed by Felix Kingston in quarto until 1641 it is almost certain that it was performed some time during 1635&#150;6. All that is known about its performance is that it was acted by Queen Henrietta's Men at the Cockpit theatre. Like Marmion's two previous plays it incorporates an actual historical event, the closure in 1629 of an antiquarian library, presumed to be that of Sir Robert Cotton  (K. Sharpe, <span class="italic">Sir Robert Cotton, 1586&#150;1631</span>, 1979). It is thought to have been revived twice in 1718 to celebrate the revival of the Society of Antiquaries  (Dodsley, <span class="italic">A Selection of English Plays</span>, 1780). In its borrowings from various of Shakespeare's plays and poems, as well as from the works of Petronius and Virgil, and from books of &#145;characters&#146;, such as Overbury's <span class="italic">Characters</span>, John Earle's <span class="italic">Microcosmographie</span>, or Wye Saltonstall's <span class="italic">Picturae loquentes</span>, it is possible that Marmion was burlesquing the earlier texts that his audience could not have failed to recognize. In each of Marmion's plays there is an opposition between romantic and profane love, and this is sometimes aligned with the opposition between youth and age. Characters are driven by Jonsonian &#145;humours&#146; and in each case idiosyncrasies are corrected through the celebratory power of comedy. Threats to the well-being of society are overcome by ingenuity but in the end all that is potentially harmful is rehabilitated within a social order that is shown to be capable of dynamically recharging itself. Marmion aligns the &#145;turbulenta prima, tranquilla ultima&#146; (&#145;turbulent beginning, tranquil conclusion&#146;) definition of the structure of comedy derived from his friend Thomas Heywood with Ben Jonson's Ciceronian definition: &#145;Imitatio vitae, speculum consuetudinis, imago veritatis&#146; (&#145;Imitation of life, mirror of manners, image of truth&#146;).<br>
<br>In addition to Marmion's three known plays his name was associated with a fourth play, <span class="italic">The Sodder'd Citizen</span>, the manuscript for which was brought to the British Museum by its owner, Lieutenant-Colonel E. G. Troyte-Bullock, in 1932. The first mention of Marmion's association with the play was in 1653 in an entry in the Stationers' register under the name of the publisher Humphrey Moseley. The play was acted between 1631 and 25 January 1632, the latter being the date when the actor Richard Sharpe, who had delivered both the prologue and the epilogue in performance, died. It is now generally thought that the author of this play was the highwayman&#150;poet John Clavell, whose name, alongside the date, 1633, appears on the manuscript  (Clavell).<br>
<br>Marmion also contributed occasional poems to Mathewe Walbancke's <span class="italic">Annalia Dubrensia, or, Celebration of Captain Dover's Cotswold Games</span> (1636), Thomas Heywood's <span class="italic">The Phoenix of these Late Times, or, The Life of Mr. Henry Welby, Esq.</span> (1637), <span class="italic">A true description of his majesties royall ship, built in this year 1637 at Wooll-witch in Kent</span> (1637), and <span class="italic">Pleasant Dialogues and Dramas</span> (1637), and a memorial poem to a collection commemorating the achievement of the dramatist and poet Ben Jonson, who died in 1637, <span class="italic">Jonsonus virbius</span> (1638). As well as occasional poetry Marmion published a long allegorical poem, <span class="italic">The Legend of Cupid and Psyche, or, Cupid and his Mistress</span> (1637), based on Apuleius's <span class="italic">The Golden Ass</span>. The poem was entered in the Stationers' register on 24 June 1637 by John Okes and the quarto was subsequently printed by Nicholas and John Okes, with prefatory verses by Richard Brome, Francis Tuckyr, Thomas Nabbes, and Thomas Heywood, who had treated this theme in his masque <span class="italic">Love's Mistress, or, The Queen's Masque</span> (1636); it was dedicated to Charles Lewis, prince elector and count palatine of the Rhine. It is thought that a second edition of the poem may have appeared in 1638  (Maxwell, 278ff.). In January 1639 Marmion joined Sir John Suckling's expedition against the Scots. He contracted a cold at Selby in Yorkshire and returned to London, where he died later that month. He was buried in the church of St Bartholomew in Smithfield.<br>
<br>With the exception of <span class="italic">The Antiquary</span> (1641) all of Marmion's plays and his poetry were published during his lifetime. Dodsley's <span class="italic">A Selection of Old English Plays</span> (1780) and Sir Walter Scott's <span class="italic">Ancient British Drama</span> (1810) both contain editions of <span class="italic">The Antiquary</span>, while W. H. Logan and J. Maidment produced a complete but poorly edited edition of the plays in 1875. In the twentieth century <span class="italic">A Fine Companion</span> was edited in 1979 by Richard Sonnenshine, and A. J. Nearing published an edition of <span class="italic">The Legend of Cupid and Psyche</span> in 1944. There have been three significant research theses on Marmion: Sue Maxwell (Yale University, 1941), Marion Jones (University of Oxford, 1956), and John Drakakis (University of Leeds, 1988), the last of which contains a complete old-spelling edition of the plays and a full textual analysis.<br>
