<span class="headword">Hicks,  Baptist</span>, first Viscount Campden  (1551?&#150;1629), <span class="occ">mercer and moneylender</span>, was the third son of Robert Hicks (<i>d</i>. 1557), a rich London citizen. He was probably educated at St Paul's School, and then at Trinity College, Cambridge. He was brought up in, and inherited, his father's flourishing mercer's business at the White Bear in Cheapside. The influence of his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13215/', "Sir Michael Hickes (1543&#150;1612)")</script>, a secretary to Lord Burghley and an intimate of Robert Cecil (later the earl of Salisbury), provided him with opportunities to supply the court with silks and mercery, as well as to make loans to the crown and to courtly persons, among them the earl and countess of Shrewsbury, the earls of Pembroke and Montgomery, Lord Chandos, Anthony and Francis Bacon, and Sir Fulke Greville.<br>
<br>Baptist Hicks complained more than once to his brother about his undeserved reputation for hard dealing, &#145;when others &hellip; goe awaye with the gaines and yet byte to the bone&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 89, no. 32). He was one of the most important individual lenders to the early Stuart kings, his loans to whom amounted to at least &pound;33,000, not including some of his contributions to syndicated loans, which cannot be precisely quantified, nor the extended credit which he gave for silks and luxury items for the royal household and wardrobe. About this last involvement he expressed concern in a letter to his brother on 9 January 1607: &#145;I would to god that I had never procured yt&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 90, no. 3). In 1609 he obtained a lucrative concession as one of a number of contractors for the purchase and resale of royal lands. His importance to the crown was demonstrated in November 1611, and on other occasions, when royal intervention was instrumental in saving him from serving as alderman.<br>
<br>In 1584 Hicks married Elizabeth, daughter of Richard May, merchant tailor of London. According to Stow, each of their two daughters and coheirs had a fortune of &pound;100,000  (Stow, 760&#150;61). Soon after 1608 Hicks purchased the manor of Campden in Gloucestershire, where he erected a noble mansion near the church; the &#145;outside&#146; of the house was said to have cost him &pound;29,000. The building was destroyed during the civil war. In 1612 he became involved in a long but ultimately successful dispute with Lionel Cranfield (later the earl of Middlesex), over the profits of the rectory of Campden. In 1611&#150;12 he built at his own cost a sessions house in Clerkenwell for the Middlesex magistrates. This became known as Hicks Hall.<br>
<br>Knighted in 1603, shortly after James I's accession, Hicks was one of the first knighted citizens to continue keeping shop after being honoured. On 1 July 1620 he was created a baronet. He served as MP for Tavistock in the parliament of 1621, and for Tewkesbury in the parliaments of 1624, 1625, 1626, and 1628. In 1625 he was appointed a deputy lieutenant for Middlesex, and on 5 May 1628 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Hicks of Ilmington, Warwickshire, and Viscount Campden of Campden, Gloucestershire. The titles were inherited by special remainder by his son-in-law, Edward, Baron Noel.<br>
<br>Campden died in London on 18 October 1629, aged seventy-eight, and was buried, on 4 November 1629, in Campden church, where a magnificent monument of black and white marble was erected, with reclining effigies of himself and his wife (who survived him). His epitaph stated that he gave &pound;10,000 to charitable uses, though a later estimate reckoned this sum at &pound;7058. Among the parish churches to benefit from his generosity were those of Campden, Tewkesbury, Hampstead, his City church of St Lawrence Jewry, and Kensington, where in 1612 he had built another country house conveniently near the City. Other benefactions included the building of a market house, the endowment of twelve almshouses in Campden, and bequests for the poor, both there and in Kensington.<br>
