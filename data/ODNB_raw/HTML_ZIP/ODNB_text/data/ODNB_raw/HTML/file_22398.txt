<span class="headword">Plumpton, Sir  William</span>  (1404&#150;1480), <span class="occ">landowner and administrator</span>, was the eldest son, and heir, of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59064/', "Sir Robert Plumpton (1383&#150;1421)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52793/', "Plumpton family")</script>] of Plumpton near Knaresborough in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and Alice, daughter of Sir Godfrey Foljambe of Hassop in Derbyshire. Born on 7 October 1404 he was still a minor at the time of his father's death in 1421: not surprisingly, since both his father and grandfather had been Percy retainers, he became a ward of Henry Percy, second earl of Northumberland, and, after he attained his majority in 1425, his prime loyalty to the Percys wavered significantly only when they were eclipsed by the Nevilles in the 1460s. Like many young gentlemen of the day he saw service as a soldier in the war against France: in 1427&#150;8, when he probably received his knighthood, and again, in 1435, as a captain in the retinue of John, duke of Bedford. From the late 1430s, however, his main interests centred on Yorkshire. In 1439 he became steward and master forester of the royal honour of Knaresborough and constable of Knaresborough Castle, and remained closely connected with the honour's administration for the rest of Henry VI's reign. Then, in 1442, the earl of Northumberland appointed him steward of his lordship of Spofforth and other estates in Yorkshire for life, with an annual fee of &pound;10. To this was added in 1447, for his good service, a further &pound;10. From November 1439, moreover, Plumpton's name appeared on the commission of the peace for the West Riding and he served as sheriff of Yorkshire (1447&#150;8), and Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire (1452&#150;3).<br>
<br>During the 1450s, as a retainer of the earl of Northumberland, Sir William Plumpton became increasingly identified with the Lancastrian regime. Shortly before the first battle of St Albans in May 1455 he was summoned to attend a Lancastrian great council as a representative of the West Riding, and he may have fought in the battle (where his patron was killed). In 1456 he probably took part in a raid over the Scottish border led by the new earl of Northumberland, and it was no doubt as Northumberland's man that he appeared on royal commissions in the later 1450s. Perhaps present in the Lancastrian force at Ludford Bridge on 12 October 1459 he was certainly a commissioner of array to counter Yorkist rebels in the West Riding in December 1459. Significantly, following the Yorkist victory at Northampton on 10 July 1460, he ceased to be a justice of the peace and in all probability he actively supported the earl of Northumberland and the Lancastrians in the autumn of 1460 and was present at the battle of Wakefield on 30 December. On 12 March 1461, a few days after the Yorkist Edward IV had been proclaimed king in London, orders were issued by the Lancastrian leadership requiring Plumpton and two other knights &#145;to summon all liegemen of the forest or demesne of Knaresborough to set out with them to meet the enemy&#146;, while the following day a letter purporting to come from Henry VI himself at York begged that he present himself &#145;in all hast possible&#146; to &#145;resist the malicious entent and purpose&#146; of Edward IV  (Kirby, 26). Plumpton almost certainly answered the call and fought for the Lancastrians at Towton on 29 March 1461; his son and heir, another William, probably lost his life in the fighting; and since his patron, the third earl of Northumberland, perished there, it is hardly surprising that the next few years proved traumatic for him.<br>
<br>Initially, following Towton, Plumpton fled to Cumberland, only to be captured at Cockermouth, and on 1 May 1461 he was brought before Edward IV at Newcastle. However, he managed to avoid the attainder for treason that might easily have been his fate, and even secured the protection of the king against his enemies providing he agreed to bind himself in the sum of &pound;2000 as a guarantee of his future good conduct. He apparently failed to raise the money and, when the time allowed expired on 12 July 1461, he surrendered himself as a prisoner at the Tower of London: he probably remained imprisoned there until he obtained a general pardon on 5 February 1462. Even then his troubles were far from over, since in late 1463 he had to face further charges of treason when he was accused of receiving &#145;false, damnable, deffamatory and slaunderous writing&#146; against the king and secretly aiding &#145;divers persons coming out of Scotland fro the king's adversaries&#146;  (Stapleton, lxix). These were very serious charges but he was acquitted on all counts and from early 1464 appears to have enjoyed complete liberty. Even so his position remained difficult: hence his attempts to find favour with John Neville, who became earl of Northumberland in 1464, and his brother Richard Neville, earl of Warwick, as a result of which he regained his office as steward of Spofforth and became Warwick's deputy as steward, constable, and master forester of Knaresborough. Perhaps this explains why, when Henry Percy was restored to his father's earldom in 1470, his early relations with Plumpton were rather frosty: for instance, he deprived him of his offices in the honour of Knaresborough in 1471. Plumpton's appointment as steward of Spofforth was nevertheless renewed by Northumberland in 1472 and he managed to win a measure of royal favour as well: he served as justice of the peace in the West Riding for most of the 1470s, figured on several government commissions, and even received permission to fortify his manor house at Plumpton. He died on 15 October 1480.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_22397"></a><span class="headword">Sir Robert Plumpton</span>  (1453&#150;1525), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, son of Sir William and his second wife, Joan Wintringham of Knaresborough, certainly soon developed a strong connection with the fourth earl of Northumberland, both as retainer and member of his comital council, and this ensured his role in resisting the mounting Scottish threat during Edward IV's last years: most notably, in 1482, he campaigned north of the border in a massive force commanded by Richard of Gloucester and Northumberland, probably receiving his knighthood in the process. His sympathies during Richard III's reign can only be guessed at: in all probability he followed the line of his patron, Henry Percy, and may even have been in the earl's non-participating force at Bosworth on 22 August 1485. During the early years of Henry VII's reign Sir Robert seems to have enjoyed Northumberland's patronage to the full, regaining his father's former offices in both the royal honour of Knaresborough and the Percy lordship of Spofforth. When the king paid his first visit to Yorkshire in April 1486 he rode with the earl and a company of fellow Percy feedmen to greet him; he may have fought for Henry VII at the battle of Stoke in June 1487 and was certainly involved in the mopping-up operations following Lambert Simnel's defeat there; later in the year he travelled to London for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth. When the spring of 1489 brought a rebellion of considerable proportions in Yorkshire, he responded to an urgent summons to attend the earl of Northumberland at Thirsk and, following Percy's murder at the hands of the rebels on 28 April, played a sufficiently prominent role in suppressing the insurrection to receive a personal letter of thanks from the king, as he did again in 1492 for his part in putting down a further obscure rising in the western part of the county. Thereafter he ceased to play any significant political or military role in the north, partly because Northumberland's death removed his prime benefactor and the new earl was only a child, and partly because much of the rest of his life was dominated by a gargantuan effort to defend his inheritance.<br>
<br>The central theme of much of the <span class="italic">Plumpton Correspondence</span>&#151;and, indeed, the main reason why the family's letters and papers were preserved&#151;is the protracted struggle from the 1470s onwards to prove rightful title to and, ultimately, obtain possession of the family estates. For this, moreover, Sir William Plumpton must bear prime responsibility. With his first wife, Elizabeth, daughter of his near neighbour Sir Brian Stapleton of Carlton, he had several daughters and two sons, Robert and William. Robert died in 1450, soon after becoming betrothed to Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas, Lord Clifford, of Skipton in Craven. Elizabeth then married Sir William's second son, William, in 1453, and by the time of her husband's death in 1461 she had given birth to two daughters. In the meantime Sir William Plumpton himself had taken a second wife, Joan Wintringham of Knaresborough, with whom he had a son, Robert. For reasons that cannot be fully explained he chose to keep this marriage a secret. Only when taken to task by the ecclesiastical authorities many years later for his apparent immorality in living with Joan did he at last acknowledge her as his wife in 1468. Eventually, in 1472, the marriage was declared valid and Robert Plumpton recognized as his legitimate son. By 1472, moreover, he was the only legitimate son of Sir William. In the early 1460s, however, Sir William's granddaughters had been married: the elder, Margaret, to John Rocliffe of Cowthorpe near Wetherby and the younger, Elizabeth, to another local gentleman, John Suthill. Both these marriages had been arranged before Sir William Plumpton made public his own second marriage and in the clear expectation that the two girls would be coheirs to the family estates. Thus when in the 1470s Sir William made it increasingly clear that he favoured his son, Robert, and, indeed, in 1478 married him to Agnes, daughter of Sir William Gascoigne, as his heir presumptive, conflict with the Rocliffes and Suthills was inevitable.<br>
<br>Even before Sir William Plumpton's death in the autumn of 1480, arbitration machinery had been set in motion: now battle was joined with a vengeance until, in September 1483, a compromise was reluctantly agreed. There matters rested for over a decade until in 1497 Henry VII's notorious financial agent Sir Richard Empson chose to give his formidable backing to Sir William Plumpton's granddaughters in a new challenge to the settlement of 1483. Thus by the end of 1502 Sir Robert Plumpton found himself deprived of the legal right to lands he had occupied for over twenty years. Not that he had any intention of giving up the struggle. Indeed, a few days after the verdict on his Yorkshire estates went against him at the York assizes in the autumn of 1502, he ordered his wife to &#145;see that the manor and place of Plumpton be surely and stedfastly kept&#146; and for months thereafter attempts by the victors to occupy the family lands were parried, with both Sir Robert's wife, Agnes, and his son William playing prominent roles  (Kirby, 152). Sir Robert meanwhile journeyed to London to press his claims personally, even appealing to Henry VII for protection. In February 1503 he became a knight of the body. Eventually, on 16 July 1503, his efforts were partially rewarded when the king issued an injunction that &#145;William Plompton, son and heir of Sir Robert Plompton, peacably enjoy the Lordships of Plumpton and Idle&#146;  (Stapleton, cxii&#150;cxiii). But his troubles were not over, as a letter from his second wife, Isabel, daughter of Ralph, Lord Neville, whom he married in 1503 after the death of Agnes, makes clear: &#145;Sir, for God's sake take an end&#146;, she concluded, &#145;for we are brought to beggar staffe&#146;  (Kirby, 181). Both Sir Robert and his son William may have served a period of imprisonment in the Fleet towards the end of Henry VII's reign, as he and his wife certainly did in the Counter in 1510. Moreover, although a fresh arbitration in March 1515 did at least give Sir Robert firm possession of the manor of Plumpton, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59065/', "William Plumpton (1485&#150;1547)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52793/', "Plumpton family")</script>] clearly received a much depleted inheritance at his father's death.<br>
