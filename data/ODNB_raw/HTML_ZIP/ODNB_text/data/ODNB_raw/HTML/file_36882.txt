<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Whitworth,  Geoffrey Arundel</span>  (1883&#150;1951), <span class="occ">founder of the British Drama League</span>, was born in Kensington, London, on 7 April 1883, the youngest child of William Whitworth, barrister, and his wife, Phyllis Mary Draper; he had two brothers and two sisters. Owing to early developed spinal trouble&#151;which prevented him from going to school and which he met courageously&#151;he was educated privately until he went up to New College, Oxford, where he obtained a third class in modern history in 1906. He joined the staff of the <span class="italic">Burlington Magazine</span>, edited by Charles Holmes; then, from the autumn of 1907, he worked for Chatto and Windus, the publishing firm. There, in building up a list of contemporary books, he was a colleague of Frank Swinnerton, the novelist, who noticed his &#145;eager adventurousness&#146; and his &#145;indomitable good temper, a part of his nature and his faith&#146;. Whitworth knew many writers, established and new; through him the firm attracted works by such authors as G. K. Chesterton, Lytton Strachey, and Clive Bell.<br>
<br>In 1910 Whitworth married Phyllis Grace (<i>d</i>. 1964), fifth daughter and ninth of the ten children of the Revd George Edward Bell, vicar of Henley in Arden, Warwickshire, from 1876 to 1914. They had a son and a daughter. During the first two years of their marriage Phyllis Whitworth did the secretarial work for a monthly literary magazine, the <span class="italic">Open Window</span>, which her husband published from their Chelsea home with Vivian Locke Ellis.<br>
<br>Whitworth's main love was the theatre. He enjoyed going to plays, and occasionally writing them; he had frequented the Court Theatre and was devoted to George Bernard Shaw. But his first enthusiasm at that time was for the project of a national theatre, to be regarded as a Shakespeare memorial and (it was hoped) opened in time for the tercentenary in 1916 of Shakespeare's death. With all his preoccupations in publishing, and his own writing&#151;for example, <span class="italic">A Book of Whimsies</span> (with Keith Henderson, 1909) and <span class="italic">The Art of Nijinsky</span> (1913)&#151;Whitworth never ceased to think of the national theatre.<br>
<br>With the coming of war in 1914 these plans were shattered, but Whitworth became in 1919 the honorary secretary of his own organization, the British Drama League, founded &#145;to assist the development of the art of the Theatre and to promote a right relation between Drama and the life of the community&#146;. In the previous autumn he had been much impressed by an amateur rendering, half-reading, half-performance, of a one-act play in a hut attached to a factory at Crayford in Kent&#151;something undertaken, he said, &#145;in the spirit of community enterprise &hellip; which had endowed the performance with a peculiar dignity&#146;  (G. Whitworth, 14). He held that this dignity must be the mark of a national theatre, and that the theatre itself, &#145;for all its costly elaboration, for all its perfection or professional technique&#146;, must be &#145;nothing more and nothing less than a Community Theatre writ large&#146;  (ibid., 14&#150;15). For him the drama was &#145;<i>par excellence</i> the art of the people, and the theatre everybody's business&#146;.<br>
<br>Hence the conception of the British Drama League, devoted to the &#145;encouragement of senior amateur actors throughout the land&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 Sept 1951). Lord Howard de Walden served as president, Harley Granville-Barker as chairman of council, and Whitworth as honorary secretary. It held its first annual conference in the summer of 1919 at Stratford upon Avon, where one resolution pledged members to help the development of &#145;acting, the drama, and of the Theatre as forces in the life of the nation&#146;, and another called for &#145;a National Theatre policy adequate to the needs of the people&#146;. These phrases might speak for Whitworth's career: his constant and ardent advocacy of the theatre as a power in life. Rapidly the Drama League burgeoned. In 1928 Whitworth at last left publishing to give his whole time to the league, as a practical achievement, and to the national theatre, as a hoped-for vision. He was able to see in the league's growth&#151;with its many affiliated societies, its 100,000 actors and playgoers, its training department, its National Festival of Community Drama, and its library (eventually the largest in the world devoted solely to the theatre)&#151;a &#145;new and extraordinary outbreak of dramatic energy&#146;. His steady insistence on the value of drama in education prepared the way for the appointment of full-time professional county drama advisers.<br>
<br>No man was better fitted than Whitworth, selfless, persuasive, and much loved, to battle for causes he admired. As director of the league and as honorary secretary of the Shakespeare Memorial National Theatre Committee (1930&#150;51), he used his talents as speaker and organizer. Before giving his entire time to these tasks, he acted as drama critic of <span class="italic">John O'London's Weekly</span> (1922) and the <span class="italic">Christian Science Monitor</span> (1923); and in 1924&#150;5 he organized the theatre section of the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley. From 1919 until 1948 he edited the league's magazine, <span class="italic">Drama</span>.<br>
<br>At a public tribute to him in 1934, the year before the league's move from Adelphi Terrace to Fitzroy Square, Shaw described Whitworth as &#145;one of the most important people in the theatre today&#146;. When war again intervened, Whitworth did not cease from crusading. It was owing to his persistence and vision that the league's civic theatre scheme&#151;first suggested in 1942&#151;was approved, and that in 1948 the insertion of a clause (132) in the <span class="roman">Local Government Act</span> enabled municipal authorities to spend up to the value of a 6<i>d</i>. rate on providing all kinds of entertainment, including the theatre. Whitworth had a final reward when the queen laid the foundation stone (later moved) of the National Theatre upon the South Bank site, London, in July 1951: it was just two months before his death at the Acland Nursing Home, Oxford, on 9 September 1951. He had retired from the directorship of the Drama League during 1948, a retirement he described as &#145;a sort of minor death&#146;, and had become instead chairman of its council.<br>
<br>Whitworth, a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, translated <span class="italic">The Legend of Tyl Ulenspiegel</span> (1918); and wrote a novel, <span class="italic">The Bells of Paradise</span> (1918), and two notable plays, <span class="italic">Father Noah</span> (1918) and <span class="italic">Haunted Houses</span> (1934). He was also the author of works on his special subject, <span class="italic">The Theatre of my Heart</span> (1930; revised 1938) and <span class="italic">The Making of a National Theatre</span> (1951), as well as <span class="italic">The Civic Theatre Scheme</span> (1942). He served on the executive committee of governors of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre and the committee of the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust. In 1947 he was appointed CBE.<br>
<br>Whitworth was survived by his wife, Phyllis Whitworth, who died in 1964. A tireless worker on behalf of the league, she also directed, and managed, between 1924 and 1931, the Three Hundred Club for staging plays of merit likely at first to have a limited public.<br>
