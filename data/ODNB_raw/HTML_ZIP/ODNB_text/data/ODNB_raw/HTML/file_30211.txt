<span class="headword">Yelloly,  John</span>  (1774&#150;1842), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at Alnwick, Northumberland, on 30 April 1774, the youngest son and sole survivor of the seven children of John Yelloly and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davison (<i>d</i>. 1799). His father died in his infancy and he was brought up by his widowed mother, whose family owned extensive property in the Vale of Whittington, near Alnwick. Yelloly was educated at Alnwick grammar school and the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated MD in 1799. His mother died in that year, leaving him a substantial legacy and in 1800 he moved to London where he became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians and was physician to the General Dispensary, Aldersgate Street.<br>
<br>There was dissatisfaction with the Medical Society of London at the beginning of the nineteenth century and on 22 May 1805 a group of members met to discuss the establishment of a new society. The Medical and Chirurgical Society of London was founded on 28 June 1805 with William Saunders as president, Astley Cooper as treasurer, Yelloly and Arthur Aikin as secretaries, and Alexander Marcet as foreign secretary. Their aim was to exchange ideas and practical knowledge, though papers read at the meetings were not discussed. Yelloly was a zealous supporter of the new society, securing its charter and establishing its library. He also contributed articles to its journal. In 1808 he read a paper on a case of paralysis caused by a tumour of the brain. This was published in the first volume of the <span class="italic">Medico-Chirurgical Transactions</span> in 1809. With Astley Cooper's help he also investigated the distribution of the nervous influence through the spinal cord. When one of the columns of the spinal cord in a dog was divided Yelloly found that paralysis occurred on the same side of the body showing that the nervous action was direct. A second paper on anaesthesia without loss of the power of movement was published in 1812. He was elected FRS on 5 May 1814.<br>
<br>On 4 August 1806 Yelloly married Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1865), only daughter of Samuel Tyssen of Narborough Hall, Norfolk. They lived in Finsbury Square and there were ten children of the marriage. In 1807 Yelloly was appointed physician to the London Hospital, a post he held until 1818, when the poor health of his children made it desirable to live in the country. He therefore resigned from the London Hospital and moved with his family to Carrow Abbey, Norwich. In recognition of his work for the Medical and Chirurgical Society he was granted permission to receive library books from the society at his home in Norwich. In 1827 he made a tour of the Netherlands.<br>
<br>Yelloly became physician to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital in 1821 and served for eleven years. Norfolk was known for an exceptionally high incidence of bladder stone and the hospital held a large collection of stones taken from patients since 1771. With the surgeon John Green Crosse, Yelloly undertook to study the epidemiology of these stones and to analyse them chemically. The results were published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> of the Royal Society in 1829&#150;30. Continuing his work on physiology and pathology Yelloly showed in 1835 that vascular fullness of the villous coat of the stomach was not necessarily a sign of disease or inflammation. His work, valuable in its own time, presaged the rapid developments in physiology, pathology, and medical chemistry which followed later in the nineteenth century. Yelloly also maintained his interest in the activities of the Medical and Chirurgical Society which was granted its royal charter in 1834. It was proposed that the name should be changed to the Royal Society of Medicine and Surgery, but Yelloly wrote at once objecting to this and his arguments prevailed with the council so that the change was not made, apart from the addition of the word Royal. Members were to become fellows, the king was to be the first patron, and Yelloly, along with Astley Cooper, were the first members of council.<br>
<br>Yelloly retired in 1832 and moved to Woodton Hall, near Norwich. A series of misfortunes followed. In 1836 his third son died and in 1838 he lost two daughters on successive days. He moved his family temporarily to the milder climate of Hastings and Dawlish, but in January 1840 he lost his fourth child. Then in April 1840, three days after the marriage of another daughter, he was thrown from his phaeton and received a serious injury to his forehead. Fifteen days later he became paralysed on his right side. He did not fully recover, but in July 1840 he moved to Cavendish Hall, Suffolk, where he gradually regained strength. He visited London in September 1841, but on 28 January 1842 he was seized by paralysis of the left side and was rendered speechless. Gradually losing consciousness, he died at Cavendish Hall on 31 January 1842.<br>
