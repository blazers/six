</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Penny,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1530&#150;1589), <span class="occ">botanist and entomologist</span>, was born at Gressingham, near Lancaster, one of two known sons of John Penny, a smallholder in the hamlet of Eskrigge in that parish. After perhaps attending the local grammar school he went up to Queens' College, Cambridge, as a pensioner in 1546, but on being awarded a sizarship at the larger Trinity College he transferred there in 1550, graduating BA in the following year. Elected a fellow in 1553 he stayed on to study, becoming senior bursar of Trinity in 1564.<br>
<br>Though not ordained until June 1561, Penny was already preaching, and on 2 March 1560 was collated to the prebend of Newington in St Paul's Cathedral. A strong supporter of the Reformation, his 1565 Spital sermon at Paul's Cross caused him to be censured by Archbishop Matthew Parker, as being ill-disposed towards the established church. With his clerical career in jeopardy, he imitated an earlier Cambridge divine and naturalist, William Turner, and went abroad to equip himself for medical practice instead. Already knowledgeable about butterflies and plants, he was warmly received in Z&uuml;rich late in 1565 by Conrad Gesner, then engaged on his <span class="italic">Historia plantarum</span>. Penny presented Gesner with some choice plant specimens, and probably received some insect drawings by Gesner in exchange. Gesner's death a few months later, however, ended their collaboration, and led Penny to move to Geneva and spend the next summer exploring botanically the neighbouring mountains. He went next to Montpellier, where his friendship with Matthias de l'Obel, then a student there, doubtless originated, visited Majorca, and then seems to have travelled up through France to spend a period at Heidelberg. There he probably became acquainted with the elder Joachim Camerarius and collected plants and insects with two English medical students who were fellow naturalists. After a final tour of Prussia and the Baltic coast he returned to England, apparently in 1569, and set up in London in what proved to be a practice of some renown. No friend of established authority, however, he twice defied the College of Physicians by practising without its licence, even incurring imprisonment, before it eventually bowed to his reputation and admitted him a fellow (by 1582). Surprisingly, he retained his prebend until 1577, when he was deprived of it for nonconformity.<br>
<br>Anchored for the rest of his life in Leadenhall Street, Penny nevertheless travelled widely in England in pursuit of natural history, records credited to him in the works of de l'Obel, John Gerard, and others including several plants new to the British list. Though insects increasingly now became his dominant interest, he was still botanist enough to introduce Charles de l'Ecluse to several English rarities as late as 1581.<br>
<br>In November 1587 the death of his wife, Margaret, the daughter of John Lucas, master of requests to Edward VI, seemingly hastened Penny's end. Asthmatic and suffering from symptoms diagnosed by his friend and colleague Thomas Moffet as due to abstinence from salt, he died in January 1589 in London and was buried in the churchyard of St Andrew Undershaft, his home parish. A puritan to the last, he stipulated in his will, dated 4 June 1588, that there should be no ceremony whatever at his interment, mourning apparel, ringing, and singing being all expressly prohibited. Papers he purportedly left to Turner's son Peter cannot now be traced; those he had been amassing for a major work on insects Penny left to Moffet. A book man where Penny had been a field man, Moffet went to much trouble in putting these into order and added so much that he felt justified in presenting the manuscript of 1200 folios he had ready for publication in March 1589 as having four authors. The first-hand observations and more detailed descriptions (including of nineteen British butterflies) were, however, probably Penny's. No copy appears to have survived of a German imprint of 1598, apparently the basis of Edward Topsell's plagiarism in an English translation under the title <span class="italic">A Historie of Foure-Footed Beasts</span> (1607), the earliest-known entomological work published in Britain. Moffet's Latin version, <span class="italic">Insectorum sive minimorum animalium theatrum</span>, repeatedly submerged by his many competing commitments, eventually appeared posthumously in 1634.<br>
<br>The Balearic St John's Wort now known as <i>Hypericum balearicum</i> was named <i>Myrtocistus pennaei</i> by de l'Ecluse in honour of its discoverer.<br>
