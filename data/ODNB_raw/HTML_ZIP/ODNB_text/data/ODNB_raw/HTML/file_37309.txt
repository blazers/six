<span class="headword">Conroy, Sir  John Ponsonby</span>, first baronet  (1786&#150;1854), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was born on 21 October 1786 at Maes-y-castell, Caerhun, Caernarvonshire, the eldest of the five sons and one daughter of John Ponsonby Conroy (1759&#150;1797), barrister, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Francis Vernon Wilson, who were both Irish-born. Educated by tutors and at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, he was commissioned into the Royal Artillery in 1803.<br>
<br>On 26 December 1808 Conroy married Elizabeth (1790&#150;1864), daughter of Major-General Benjamin Fisher and Charlotte Clarke, and niece of Dr John Fisher, bishop of Salisbury, who had tutored Edward, duke of Kent. They had four sons, one of whom died young, and two daughters. Conroy believed his wife to be the duke of Kent's natural child, and this fantasy may have accounted for his arrogance towards Queen Victoria. Through his wife's connections, he became equerry to the duke of Kent on the latter's marriage to Princess Victoire of Leiningen in 1818. Conroy was an organizer of genius. He made it possible for the duke and his wife, in the eighth month of pregnancy, to rush back from Germany to Kensington Palace for the birth, putting up the royal cavalcade at his home in Shooter's Hill, Kent, on the way. When the duke died suddenly in 1820, Conroy became comptroller of the duchess of Kent's household; alone in a hostile environment, she came to place great reliance on him.<br>
<br>At first Conroy shared his influence on the duchess with her brother, Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, but after Leopold ascended the Belgian throne in 1830, Conroy ruled supreme. He survived the &#145;Cumberland plot&#146; in 1829, when a rumour said to have been started by Ernest, duke of Cumberland, circulated, to the effect that the duchess of Kent was Conroy's mistress. This was intended to discredit the duchess and have Princess Victoria removed from her care, and even, Conroy feared, killed. He established the &#145;Kensington system&#146;, with the intention of seeing Victoria educated as heir presumptive to the crown, her mother created regent if the king died before Victoria was eighteen, himself appointed Victoria's private secretary with a peerage, and a rival court developed at Kensington, cut off from the tory politics and lax morals of William IV, who referred to Conroy as &#145;King John&#146;. Victoria had no youthful companionship except Conroy's daughters and no personal champion but her German governess, Baroness Lehzen, Conroy's implacable foe. In order to make Victoria known to the people, and to enhance his own importance, Conroy took her around the country on semi-royal tours, after the last of which, in 1835, she succumbed to typhoid. While she was still on her sickbed, Conroy tried to force her to appoint him as her personal secretary when she became queen. Afterwards she told Lord Melbourne: &#145;I resisted in spite of my illness&#146;.<br>
<br>As William IV lay dying, Conroy's final desperate attempt to coerce Victoria failed. On her succession to the throne on 20 June 1837, she dismissed him from her household. But he continued to serve her mother, and was partly responsible for the fate of the duchess's lady-in-waiting, Lady Flora Hastings, who died of a tumour while suspected of being pregnant by Conroy. The duchess, too, was reported to be Conroy's mistress, though without conclusive evidence. However, he cannot be absolved of mismanaging her funds and those of Princess Sophia, Victoria's aunt and Conroy's &#145;spy&#146;, from whom he also received gifts and money amounting to &pound;148,000.<br>
<br>In 1839 Wellington persuaded Conroy to resign from the duchess of Kent's household and go abroad for a time. He had a Guelphic knighthood, an honorary DCL from Oxford, and foreign honours. He was created baronet in 1837, but Sir Robert Peel refused him the Irish peerage promised him by Melbourne. &#145;JC&#146; was not the arch-villain Victoria painted, but the victim of his own inordinate ambition. He died at his home, Arborfield Hall, near Reading, Berkshire, on 2 March 1854. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son, Edward.<br>
