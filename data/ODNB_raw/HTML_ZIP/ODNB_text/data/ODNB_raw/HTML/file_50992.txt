<span class="headword">Atkinson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Gaynor]</span>,  Sarah</span>  (1823&#150;1893), <span class="occ">philanthropist and writer</span>, was born on 13 October 1823 in Athlone, co. Westmeath, Ireland, the eldest of five daughters and one son of John and Anne Gaynor. She was educated at home; the family moved to Dublin about 1838. On 11 August 1849 she married George Atkinson (1810&#150;1893), a doctor and apothecary who was also joint proprietor of the <span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span> until he sold his shares in 1852. In 1850 the couple had a son, who died in his fourth year; they had no other children. Sarah Atkinson appears to have suffered a deep depression after the loss of her child: Lady Gilbert noted &#145;that grief seems to have completely changed her life&#146;  (Gilbert, ix). Thereafter she devoted much of her life to charitable work in Dublin.<br>
<br>With her great friend Ellen Woodlock (1811&#150;1884) Atkinson investigated the conditions in which girls were held in Irish workhouses, and argued for urgent reform in this area at the Social Science Congress held in Dublin in 1861 and in an article in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> of January 1859. In 1856, together with Woodlock, she established St Joseph's Industrial Institute in Dublin, which took girls from the workhouse and trained them for domestic service. Among her other charitable endeavours she helped establish the children's hospital in Temple Street in Dublin, which was given over in 1876 to the care of the Sisters of Charity, a religious congregation in which two of her sisters were nuns. She also campaigned successfully to have the South Dublin Union workhouse opened to visitors, and she was a regular hospital visitor. Through her charitable work Sarah Atkinson became firm friends with Bessie Rayner Parkes (1829&#150;1925), whom she is credited with converting to Catholicism.<br>
<br>Atkinson was a prolific writer, but all her works appear to have been published anonymously or signed only with her initials. She wrote articles for the <span class="italic">Irish Quarterly Review</span>, <span class="italic">Duffy's Hibernian Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">The Month</span>, <span class="italic">The Nation</span>, <span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span>, and the <span class="italic">Irish Monthly</span>. Her subjects ranged over art, travel, history, economics, and biography, and all involved a profound level of research. Her best-known work was the official biography of the founder of the Sisters of Charity, <span class="italic">Mary Aikenhead: her Life, her Work, and her Friends</span> (1879), which was praised by the historian Edward Lecky. In the tradition of other women who wrote biographies at this time, she read through original documentary material relating to the congregation and sought the oral testimony of Aikenhead's friends to construct her biography. While it is hagiographical in approach, it contains a wealth of information about the congregation. The introductory chapter of this biography provided an overview of Irish history that attempted to place Aikenhead's work in the context of the oppression visited on Catholics by, among other things, the penal laws. Reviews of the biography favourably compared the introductory chapter with Lecky's own work on the eighteenth century. A collection of Sarah Atkinson's <span class="italic">Essays</span> was published posthumously in 1894. Among her friends she counted the well-known writers Katharine Tynan (1861&#150;1931) and Rosa Mulholland, later Lady Gilbert (1841&#150;1921). She died on 8 July 1893 at Drumcondra, Dublin, and was buried in the city's Glasnevin cemetery.<br>
