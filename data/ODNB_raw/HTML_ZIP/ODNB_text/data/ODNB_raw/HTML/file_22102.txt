<span class="headword">Philip,  Alexander Philip  Wilson</span>  (1770&#150;<em>c.</em>1851), <span class="occ">physician and physiologist</span>, was born Alexander Philip Wilson in Scotland on 15 October 1770. He studied medicine at Edinburgh and graduated MD on 25 June 1792, with a dissertation entitled &#145;De dyspepsia&#146;. In the same year he published the first of a long series of medical works.<br>
<br>Admitted a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh on 3 February 1795, Wilson practised in that city for a few years, and gave a course of lectures on medicine. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 26 January 1795. About 1799 he settled at Winchester, and he afterwards moved to Worcester, where in 1802 he was elected physician to the Worcester General Infirmary. He was successful in practice, but in 1817 he resigned his post and moved to London. On 22 December 1820 he was admitted licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, and on 25 June 1834 he was made a fellow. In 1835 he delivered and published the Goulstonian lectures, &#145;On the influence of the nervous system in disease&#146;. He was also elected fellow of the Royal Society, in 1826. Before moving to London he had assumed the additional surname of Philip; his books appeared up to 1807 under the name of Wilson, and after that date under that of Wilson Philip, by which he became generally known.<br>
<br>For many years Wilson Philip maintained a large and apparently lucrative London practice in Cavendish Square but he was overtaken by misfortune in his old age. About 1842 or 1843 he suddenly disappeared from London. William Munk states that his investments were injudicious, and that the scheme in which he had placed his accumulated fortune failed, so that he had to leave the country to avoid arrest for debt  (Munk, 227). He went to Boulogne in France and is thought to have died there; his name disappeared from the list of the Royal College of Physicians in 1851. These circumstances may have suggested to Thackeray the unfortunate career of Dr Firmin in <span class="italic">The Adventures of Philip</span>.<br>
<br>Wilson Philip was a popular physician and an assiduous researcher even while he was busily engaged in practice. His investigations in physiology and pathology earned him a considerable reputation in his day, particularly as an expert on indigestion. He was one of the first to employ a microscope in the study of inflammation, and his observations attracted much attention both at home and abroad; the work in which they were contained, <span class="italic">An Experimental Enquiry</span>, was translated into German and Italian. In his physiological studies the principles stated by Wilson Philip to have guided him in the performance of experiments on living animals were considered both rational and humane. His numerous practical works, especially on indigestion and fever, were widely circulated, and also translated into several languages; and he published several papers in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span>. They demonstrate his wide medical experience.<br>
