<span class="headword">Tooley,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1551), <span class="occ">merchant adventurer and burgess</span>, about whose early life little is known, is first heard of as a merchant in 1515, but it is likely that he was born in the 1470s, possibly in Catton, near Norwich. The Tooley family marriages suggest a comfortable background, with good Suffolk and Norfolk connections. Tooley's sister Joan was married twice to Yarmouth merchants, the second of whom, Ralph Dene, was three times bailiff of Yarmouth. Another sister, Margaret, married about 1500 William Rede, a merchant of Beccles with wealthy Norwich merchant relations. Margaret's children provided Tooley with useful connections: her son, William (<i>d</i>. 1543), became a London mercer who did business for Tooley in the Low Countries and married Anne Fernely of West Creeting; Anne Fernely's sister married Sir Nicholas Bacon and Anne herself married Thomas Gresham as her second husband. Tooley's subsequent connections with the Greshams included assistance with a court case involving Sir Richard Gresham in 1544, and financial dealings with Thomas Gresham, to whom Tooley lent money between 1547 and 1551 and left his only non-family legacy. Margaret's daughter Jane married Robert Daundy (<i>d</i>. 1558), a member of a leading merchant family in Ipswich; he became a business colleague of Tooley's and was an executor of his will. Henry Tooley was married by 1525 to Alice Purpet (<i>d</i>. 1566), daughter of John Purpet, a yeoman of Ipswich, and his wife, Alice. They had one son and two daughters, none of whom survived adolescence. Alice's family was sufficiently wealthy to use Sir Humphrey Wingfield (<i>d</i>. 1545) as its lawyer. Alice's brother, John, also exported goods from Ipswich.<br>
<br>Tooley's business life is exceptionally well documented. Ipswich town records show his official activities in the town from the 1520s to his death, customs accounts show his imports and exports, and taxation returns give information about his rising level of wealth. There are about twenty surviving business letters. His many legal cases illustrate the nature, scope, and problems of his dealings, in particular two cases involving his factors: the first one affected Simon Cowper, a merchant tailor of London, who traded for Tooley in Bilbao, San Sebastian, Pasajes, and Bordeaux from 1520 to 1522; the second case involved John Armiger in Antwerp between 1541 and 1544. A more unusual survival is his account book of 1521&#150;51, which includes rare details of retail trade and the crewing, provisioning, and use of his ship, the <i>Mary Walsingham</i>, bought in Bordeaux in 1521, which Tooley used for trade with the Spanish and the French, and also for Icelandic fishing and trading.<br>
<br>By 1520 Tooley was established in several areas of merchant activity. In the 1520s and 1530s his business was based on the annual import of wine and its sale to retailers and households in the Ipswich hinterland. He also dealt in fish, iron, woad, and salt. In this traditional trade the woad was used to buy coloured woollen cloth from Suffolk, and the salt was used for the fishing trade. The wine, woad, and iron were paid for by the sale of cloth in local currencies or by direct barter of the cloths. Profits came from the retail sales of the wine, fish, miscellaneous household commodities, and dyestuffs, which were distributed largely through local carriers, who also collected payments and took orders. Goods also went by local water traffic to Norfolk, Suffolk, and Essex ports. In the 1540s this trade was disrupted by the war with France. Thereafter Tooley increased his cloth exports through London, to include Antwerp. He also expanded his imports of luxury goods, hitherto a lesser interest, and acted as a middleman in the cloth trade. He lent money at interest. At all periods he traded in miscellaneous goods, dyestuffs, and grain, where the opportunity arose.<br>
<br>Three business letters and entries in Tooley's account book suggest that his wife, Alice, also played an active role in his business, supervising shipments, negotiating payments and deliveries, and collecting debts. Later, as a widow in Mary's reign, Alice suffered for her protestant beliefs. Foxe's <span class="italic">Actes and Monumentes</span> of 1563 says that Mistress Tooley, widow, was persecuted out of Ipswich and her name was on a list of the town's active protestants in 1558 who had fled the town. However, there is no evidence that Henry, who died two years before Mary came to rule, had suffered for his religious beliefs.<br>
<br>Tooley was first chosen for a town office in 1521; in 1523 he was elected to the Twenty Four (as the town's governing body or corporation was called); and then he became one of the twelve portmen. In 1534 possibly, and in 1542 and 1548 definitely, he served as one of the two bailiffs. In 1546 and 1549 he was one of the six town justices. In the 1540s taxation lists he was the highest burgess taxpayer in Ipswich.<br>
<br>Tooley died at Ipswich in August 1551, and was buried there in the church of St Mary Quay. At the time of his death, he was owed over &pound;2000, and had about &pound;400 in goods, &pound;200 in plate, and &pound;500 in gold money. His land was valued at &pound;46 per annum from two manors totalling 900 acres (in 11 villages) purchased in 1548; he also had four properties let in Ipswich to two brewers, a clothmaker, and the master of the grammar school, in addition to his own house in the parish of St Mary Quay. In his will of November 1550 Tooley bequeathed about &pound;100 to his relatives, &pound;100 to the poor, and &pound;220 for road and bridge repairs; he left a fifth of his income to his wife for her life, while the remainder of his wealth and all his property went to found a philanthropic trust, which became known as Tooley's Foundation. Not surprisingly, his family challenged his will, but in 1556 a start was made on almshouses for ten disabled persons. In 1562 an indenture was drawn up by Lord Keeper Bacon, setting out arrangements for the management of the trust by wardens chosen annually from the aldermen and the Twenty Four and for regular inspections by writ of chancery. In 1569 money from the Tooley fund was used to buy an old Dominican friary and in it to establish Christ's Hospital for the sick, a school for the poor, and a workhouse. Other donors to the trust contributed further almshouses and a library. The nearby grammar school eventually used part of the site. Individual grants from the fund were made for medicine, pensions, for outdoor poor relief, and for education. This provided the bulk of the social provision in the town until the <span class="roman">Municipal Reform Act</span> of 1835.<br>
<br>The almsmen thanked God daily that it pleased his &#145;holy spyryte to move and styrre the harte of Henry Tooley &hellip; to gyve landes and possessyons suffycent for a necessarye relesse of us thy poore servantes and to the performance of dyvers other dedes of charytie about this town&#146;  (Webb, 159). In February 1566 a memorial tomb for Henry Tooley was erected in the church of St Mary Quay, with a brass of the Tooley family and the epitaph, &#145;A marchant welthye, whose affayres God furtherid with successe&#146;  (ibid., 153). An important Suffolk merchant, Tooley made full use of his offices, of good lawyers, and of his family, his friends, and their connections, to amass a solid provincial fortune.<br>
