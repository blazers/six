<span class="headword">Ua Conchobair,  &Aacute;ed</span> <span class="st"> [Aedh O'Connor, &Aacute;ed in Ga&iacute; Bernaig]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1067), <span class="occ">king of Connacht</span>, was the son of Tadc in Eich Gil (<i>d</i>. 1030), a member of the S&iacute;l Muiredaig branch of U&iacute; Bri&uacute;in A&iacute;. He first appears in the historical record in 1036, when he slew his father's killer, but the kingship of eastern Connacht was held at this point by Art Uallach Ua Ruairc of U&iacute; Bri&uacute;in Br&eacute;ifne. &Aacute;ed killed one of the latter's sons in 1039 (and another in 1047) and can be regarded as king of east Connacht following the death of Art Uallach in 1046. He extended his rule in 1051, when he blinded the king of west Connacht, whom he had held captive for a year, and thereupon took up residence in the west, probably on an island in Lough Corrib.<br>
<br>Ua Conchobair now engaged in inter-provincial warfare, invading north Munster in 1051, felling the Tree of Mag Adair, the D&aacute;l Cais inauguration site; and although pursued by Donnchad mac Briain B&oacute;raime, the claimant to the high-kingship, he went unpunished, and indeed killed the latter's son at about this time. He raided here again in 1054, and ravaged Lorrha in 1058. Remarkably, Donnchad submitted to him in 1059, the annals recording a strange story for 1061, that &Aacute;ed demolished Kincora and broke the wall of the well, eating its two salmon.<br>
<br>However, 1061 saw a resurgence of opposition from west Connacht, by the U&iacute; Fhlaithbertaig of U&iacute; Bri&uacute;in Seola, who deposed &Aacute;ed Ua Conchobair from the kingship, having ousted him from his base on Lough Corrib. Although he regained power, returning to Cruachu bearing the head of his defeated rival, his position was weakened and he submitted to the king of the northern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill, Ardgar Mac Lochlainn, in 1063. In 1065, however, he defeated Ua Ruairc of Br&eacute;ifne and Ua Cellaig of U&iacute; Maine after they had plundered Clonmacnoise, the annals suggesting that &Aacute;ed was its patron. Although the Leinster&#150;Munster alliance headed by Diarmait mac M&aacute;el na mB&oacute; and Toirdelbach Ua Briain is said to have paid him 30 ounces of gold for mutual aid in 1066, &Aacute;ed's last triumph was his successful resistance to their invasion of Connacht in the following year.<br>
<br>Ua Conchobair was killed a week later at the battle of Turlach Adnaig in Galway (receiving a particularly glowing obit in the annals of Tigernach), by &Aacute;ed, son of Art Uallach Ua Ruairc, who succeeded him as king of Connacht. His wife was Caillech C&aacute;emgein, daughter of &Oacute;c&aacute;n Ua Fallamain; a family of that name provided minor lords of Clann Uadach in Roscommon. With her he had his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20521/', "Ruaidr&#237; Ua Conchobair")</script>, who recovered the kingship before 1076.<br>
