<span class="headword">Coleman,  Charles</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1664), <span class="occ">musician and composer</span>, was possibly the son of Clare Coleman (<i>d</i>. 1641), described at her burial in 1641 as &#145;an ancient widow gentlewoman&#146;  (Ashbee and Lasocki, 273). He first appears singing the part of Hymen in <span class="italic">Cupid's Banishment</span>, a masque by Robert White put on at Greenwich on 4 May 1617. By 27 February 1620, when the registers of St Andrew's, Holborn, London, record the baptism of his eldest son, Charles (<i>d</i>. 1645), &#145;in Churchyard Alley in Fetter Lane&#146;, he had married. Two further children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5870/', "Edward Coleman")</script> and Alice (<i>d</i>. 1627), were baptized in 1622 and 1624.<br>
<br>Exactly when Coleman became one of the king's musicians is not known, but he was listed among the lutes and voices at the funeral of James I in 1625. He took part in James Shirley's inns of court masque <span class="italic">The Triumph of Peace</span> (1634) as both singer and instrumentalist, and wrote the music for <span class="italic">The King and Queen's Entertainment at Richmond</span>, presented by Prince Charles on 12 September 1636.<br>
<br>According to Lucy Hutchinson (wife of the regicide John Hutchinson, whose music master he was) Coleman had a house in Richmond-on-Thames. She relates how<blockquote>the man being a skilful composer in music, the King's musicians often met at his house to practise new airs and prepare them for the king; and divers of the gentlemen and ladies that were affected with music, came thither to hear; others that were not took that pretense to entertain themselves with the company. (Ashbee and Lasocki, 271)</blockquote>It was probably through Colonel Hutchinson's influence that Cambridge University awarded Coleman the MusD degree on 2 July 1651. John Playford lists him among London teachers &#145;For the Voyce or Viole&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Musicall Banquet</span>, 1651), and he was sufficiently well known for Lodewijck Huygens&#151;who calls him &#145;a famous musician&#146;&#151;to pay him a visit on 12 March 1652 while in London. Not finding him at home, he saw instead his wife, pronounced &#145;a pretty woman&#146;; this must have been Grace, almost certainly his second wife, mother of his younger children Charles (<i>d</i>. 1694), Regina (<i>bap</i>. 1650), and Grace.<br>
<br>Coleman was one of the leading composers of his time. Though not a prolific songwriter, a number of his songs were published in John Playford's <span class="italic">Select Musical Ayres and Dialogues</span> (1652, 1653, 1659, etc.) and survive in manuscript, notably in Lambeth Palace Library, MS 1041, which once belonged to Lady Anne Blount, daughter of the earl of Newport, and whose music master he may thus have been in the early 1650s. They are musically more advanced than those of his most famous contemporary Henry Lawes; among the best are &#145;Wake, my Adonis, do not cry&#146; from Cartwright's <span class="italic">The Lady Errant</span> (thought to have been performed at Oxford early in the civil war) and the dialogue &#145;Did you not once Lucinda vow&#146; from <span class="italic">The King and Queen's Entertainment</span>. A half-dozen viol fantasias of five and six parts are extant (the latter dating from before 1625), as are more than 250 consort airs, mostly arranged in suites. These show him as a close runner-up to John Jenkins and William Lawes, both as to quantity and quality. Many were published in Playford's <span class="italic">A Musicall Banquet</span> (1651), <span class="italic">Court Ayres</span> (1655), and <span class="italic">Courtly Masquing Ayres</span> (1662), but many more remain in manuscript (BL, London; Bodl. Oxf. and Christ Church library, Oxford; also Dublin, New York, etc.). At least twenty-six airs for lyra viol are known from editions of Playford's <span class="italic">Musick's Recreation on the Lyra-Viol</span> (1652, 1661, etc.) and various manuscripts. Coleman also wrote instrumental music for Davenant's <span class="italic">First Dayes Entertainment at Rutland-House</span> (1656) and <span class="italic">The Siege of Rhodes</span> (1656).<br>
<br>Despite his anti-royalist connections Coleman set Shirley's <span class="italic">Ode upon the Happy Return of King Charles to his Languishing Nation</span> at the Restoration, though the music does not survive. In due course he was reappointed to his place in the King's Musick &#145;for the viall, among the lutes and voices&#146; at a salary of &pound;40 per annum with &pound;20 for strings and livery of &pound;16. 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. In November 1662, on the death of Henry Lawes, he was appointed composer to the king, with a further &pound;40 per annum.<br>
<br>Coleman died at his house in Churchyard Alley, Fetter Lane, and was buried in St Andrew's, Holborn, on 8 July 1664. His will, dated 2 July, was proved by his wife Grace on 16 July; in it he refers to himself as &#145;an Antient man&#146; and mentions his children Charles (who succeeded to his place in the &#145;lutes and voices&#146;), Regina, and Grace.<br>
