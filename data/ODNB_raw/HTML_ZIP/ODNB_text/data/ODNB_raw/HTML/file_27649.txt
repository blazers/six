<span class="headword">Tozer,  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1601&#150;1650), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in North Tawton, Devon, to unknown parents. Having matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford, on 3 May 1621, when he was said to have been aged twenty, he graduated BA on 18 June 1623, and that year became a fellow of the college. He proceeded MA on 28 April 1626 and was ordained. Two years later he published the very conventional <span class="italic">Directions for a Godly Life: Especially for Communicating at the Lord's Table</span> (1628), dedicated to Viscount Falkland's son Lorenzo Cary, whose tutor he was, but by May 1630 he had been reported to the vice-chancellor as having discussed the differences disturbing the peace of the church. On 21 October 1632 he was appointed lecturer at St Martin's, Carfax, Oxford, where his sermons were especially frequented by those deemed puritans and he himself gained the reputation of a &#145;precise puritan&#146;; according to Anthony Wood, Tozer also preached at St Giles, to the north of the city  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.273&#150;4). Even so, his second publication, <span class="italic">A Christian Amendment</span> (1633), originally a St Martin's sermon, was an equally uncontroversial exhortation to holiness, dedicated to his former student Sir Walter Pye the younger of Hereford. On 28 July 1636 Tozer proceeded BD.<br>
<br>Like his college head, John Prideaux, whom he assisted as bursar and sub-rector, Tozer apparently remained a convinced Calvinist and he retained over the next decade his popularity among those keen for &#145;primitive religion&#146;. However, qualities that could simultaneously gain him acceptance from the Laudian establishment are evident in his <span class="italic">Christian Wisdome</span> (1639), based on a sermon delivered at the university church of St Mary's in November 1638. Dedicated to Robert Ker, earl of Ancrum, a courtier and apparently a patron of long standing, it located true wisdom&#151;the wisdom of Solomon&#151;in striving to be like God, not in spending time in such activities as &#145;the curious ordering of thy haire&#146;  (<span class="italic">Christian Wisdome</span>, 7). It firmly rejected &#145;Romanists, monks and friars&#146;  (ibid., 86&#150;7) who locked up, or steered men away from, wisdom, but condemned those who sought Solomons of their own in &#145;a Parlour, an Anabaptisticall Convention&#146;  (ibid., 100). If an incumbent were non-resident, or otherwise unsatisfactory, God would &#145;put in a better Solomon&#146;, but in the meantime it was preferable to stay put than to journey to seek a better, and better to attend the parish church than to read &#145;in your closet&#146;  (ibid., 104).<br>
<br>Tozer was approved by the House of Commons on 25 April 1642 as representative for Glamorgan in the Westminster assembly, but had not attended by 25 October 1643 when he was ordered to do so, and he never complied. In 1644 he became vicar of Yarnton, Oxfordshire, an Exeter College living, but he apparently continued to live in Oxford, where in 1646 he refused a DD degree. In the absence of Exeter's new rector, George Hakewill, Tozer managed the college and was prominent among opponents of the parliamentary visitation of the university. On 21 March 1648 he was called before the commission on a charge of reinstating the use of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> in Exeter chapel. On refusing to surrender prayer books and college keys he was expelled from his fellowship in May, and at the end of June, having been forcibly ejected from his pulpit at Carfax by soldiers of the garrison for preaching defiance, was briefly imprisoned in the Boccardo. He was allowed to retain his chamber at Exeter, and was then given permission to travel.<br>
<br>Tozer went to Rotterdam, where he became minister to the Company of Merchant Adventurers. There on 27 August 1650, &#145;weake in bodie&#146;, he made his will, leaving his friend Thomas Marshall and his servant Henry Parr between them French, Spanish, and Italian dictionaries and bibles, &#145;all my musical instruments&#146; and manuscripts there, and the works of Henry Ainsworth, the leader of English separatists at Rotterdam  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/215, p. 84). His former colleague William Standard, who had eventually submitted to the parliamentary visitors, and Exeter College itself also benefited from bequests, including Tozer's manuscripts at Exeter and &pound;50 due from land in Exeter Castle. Tozer died in Rotterdam on 11 September 1650, reportedly aged forty-eight, and was buried locally in the English church. Probate was granted on 6 January 1651 to his executor, George Potter, mercer and mayor of Oxford, who received the residue of the estate.<br>
