<span class="headword">Walker,  Samuel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1713, <em>d.</em> 1761), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was baptized on 30 December 1713 at St Paul's, Exeter. He was the fourth son, and the seventh and youngest child, of Robert Walker (1665?&#150;1749?) of Withycombe Raleigh, Devon, and his wife, Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1669?), daughter of Richard Hall, rector of St Edmund's and All Hallows, Exeter; Sir Thomas Walker, merchant and MP for Exeter, was his grandfather. Members of his family, including a cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28496/', "Dr John Walker (bap. 1674, d. 1747)")</script>, had been prominent as clergymen in Exeter. His three brothers also became clergymen.<br>
<br>Walker attended Exeter grammar school (founded by an ancestor) from 1722 to 1731, during the headmastership of the Revd Dr John Reynolds, who was from another local family and great-uncle of Sir Joshua Reynolds. On 4 November 1732 he matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford, becoming BA on 25 June 1736. Disappointed in his hope of a fellowship, he was made deacon by Dr Stephen Weston, bishop of Exeter, on 25 September 1737, to serve as curate at Doddiscombsleigh, near Exeter, and was ordained priest on 28 May 1738 on the same title. In August of the same year he resigned this curacy to accompany, as tutor and companion, young Mr Rolle&#151;whose relatives were prominent at Withycombe Raleigh and elsewhere in Devon&#151;on a visit to France. Returning early in 1740 Walker became curate to his friend Nicholas Kendall at Lanlivery in Cornwall. Kendall was archdeacon of Totnes, and on his death Walker succeeded as vicar of Lanlivery (3 March 1740), holding the benefice under bond and resigning it in favour of a nephew of Walter Kendall, the patron, in 1746.<br>
<br>In the same year Walker accepted the curacy of Truro parish church (St Mary's, later incorporated in Truro Cathedral), where the Revd St John Elliot (also of Exeter College, but after Walker's time) was instituted as rector on 3 June 1746. By 5 May 1749 Elliot had become non-resident at Truro, having been instituted also to the rectory of Ladock, 10 miles north-east of Truro, where he chose to live. In recognition of the inadequate stipendiary arrangements at Truro, Bishop Clagett instituted Walker as vicar of Talland, a village some 25 miles north-east of Truro, on 13 July 1747, but Walker came to believe that this arrangement was morally wrong and resigned Talland in 1752.<br>
<br>Until this time Walker, tall and handsome with a notable presence, had been a cleric of nominal religious conviction, who particularly enjoyed dancing. Contact with the able headmaster of Truro grammar school, George Conon, a Scottish layman and graduate of the University of Aberdeen, attracted him towards a more biblical faith, and evangelical conversion followed. Walker soon preached in a different strain; large numbers of parishioners came under spiritual instruction and conviction. Soon half the population of Truro, some 800, attended Sunday services, and were organized during the week into religious societies; their children were catechized publicly. Opposition arose and the non-resident rector tried to dismiss Walker, finding however that he was unable to bring himself to do it.<br>
<br>In spite of hostility to evangelicals shown by contemporary bishops of Exeter (Clagett and Lavington, 1742&#150;62), Walker remained a fully convinced churchman (accepting now the moderate Calvinism of article 17) and in 1750 formed a club for like-minded clergymen, of whom a sprinkling had appeared in Cornwall. Unlike Berridge and others, Walker believed that evangelical clergy should minister strictly within their parish boundaries. Nevertheless, the Wesley brothers were in touch with him, and in 1756 Walker was instrumental in preventing, for the time being, the Methodists' leaving the Church of England. Walker was also in contact with evangelical clergy elsewhere in England, notably Thomas Adam, vicar of Wintringham in Lincolnshire. In spite of a favourable opportunity to wed a lady of similar Christian outlook, he refrained from marriage.<br>
<br>Three young men from Truro, in Walker's time, became well-known as evangelical leaders: Thomas Haweis, Thomas Wills, and George Burnett, subsequently vicar of Elland in Yorkshire, and founder of the Elland Society for educating young men for the ministry, which still operates. John Martyn, father of Henry Martyn, pioneer missionary in India, was an active member of Walker's congregation. Haweis, Wills, and Burnett went up to Oxford, where Haweis was subsequently ordained as curate to the Revd Joseph Jane, senior student of Christ Church, at St Mary Magdalen, Jane's father having been Elliot's predecessor as rector of Truro. Walker's occasional visits to Oxford made him better known to the small band of evangelicals in the university, of which the leader was the Revd James Stillingfleet, fellow of Merton College (1752&#150;68), who subsequently published, as a preface to Walker's <span class="italic">Sermons</span> (1763), what was for many years the only account of Walker's life.<br>
<br>The strain of his parochial and other activities, amid frequent opposition, proved too much for Walker's health. He recovered from serious illness in 1744 but ten years later his physical health had seriously deteriorated. In 1758 his rector insisted on receiving a larger proportion of the meagre financial returns (collected annually, and in person from parishioners) of the benefice. Walker was obliged to move back into lodgings and was no longer able to provide a home for the elderly sister who had kept house for him. (Nevertheless he survived Elliot, who died in June 1761.) On 27 April 1760 Walker preached for the last time at Truro. He travelled to Bath and elsewhere, seeking to restore his health; Truro friends helped to meet his financial and other needs. But he was dying, apparently from consumption, and the second earl of Dartmouth, a leading benefactor of evangelicals, who had helped Walker financially on at least one occasion, took him into his house at Blackheath. For his last few weeks Walker was transferred to lodgings, where Haweis and Burnett attended him. He died at Lewisham, Kent, on 19 July 1761, aged forty-seven, and was buried on 23 July in Lewisham churchyard, where a memorial remained in 1889. In his lifetime, though his writing was cogent and succinct, Walker published little apart from eleven sermons, printed as <span class="italic">The Christian</span> (1755), which reached a twelfth edition in 1879. His sermons were considered by Charles Simeon of Cambridge, a leading figure in the later evangelical revival, to be &#145;the best in the English language&#146;  (Brown, 320).<br>
