<span class="headword">Popple,  William</span>  (1700/01&#150;1764), <span class="occ">government official and writer</span>, was the only son of William Popple (1665/6&#150;1722), government official, and Anne (1673/4&#150;1730), of St Margaret's, Westminster.<br>
<br>Popple's grandfather, also <a name="cosubject_22544"></a><span class="headword">William Popple</span>  (1638&#150;1708), was born in Hull on 4 February 1638, the son of Edmund Popple, sheriff of Hull in 1658, and Mary Marvell (<i>b</i>. 1616), sister of Andrew Marvell, under whose guidance Popple was educated, and with whom he corresponded. In 1663 he married Mary Alured (<i>d</i>. 1723). After moving from Hull to London in the early 1660s to embark on a career as a merchant Popple resided at Bordeaux from 1670 to 1688, whence he dated his first publication, entitled <span class="italic">A Rational Catechism</span> (1687). After returning to London he met William Penn, became secretary of the Dry Club, set up by John Locke to debate issues of religious liberty, and translated Locke's <span class="italic">Letter on Toleration</span> (1689) from the Latin. When Locke was appointed a commissioner of the Board of Trade in 1696 Popple became the board's secretary. He served as secretary for eleven years before retiring in favour of his son. Manuscript verses, a play, and translations survive in the British Library (Add. MS 8888). He died in 1708 in the parish of St Clement Danes.<br>
<br>Popple's grandson's life of government service began in 1723 as secretary to Horatio Walpole in Paris. In early 1729 Popple replaced the deceased William Congreve as an under-searcher in the port of London, and by the time Walpole returned from France in 1732 as cofferer to the royal household, Popple was already employed in the cofferer's office.<br>
<br>Popple had first published some verses in a <span class="italic">Collection of Miscellaneous Poems</span> edited by Richard Savage in 1726. Encouraged by Aaron Hill, Popple penned two comedies which Nicoll deemed &#145;of the Cibber type of moral-immoral sentimental comedy&#146;  (Nicoll, 2.200). <span class="italic">The Lady's Revenge</span> (published 1734) ran for four nights at Covent Garden in January 1734, and <span class="italic">The Double Deceit</span> (published 1736) first played there for a single night on 25 April 1735. As co-editor of <span class="italic">The Prompter</span> (with Hill; 172 numbers, 12 November 1734 &#150; 2 July 1736), Popple displayed a clear understanding of stagecraft in some important early professional theatrical criticism, and given his genuine knowledge of drama he was probably justified in ascribing his playhouse failures to political resentment of his loyalty to Walpole.<br>
<br>In 1737 Popple transferred to the Board of Trade and Plantations, and in 1745 he succeeded his brother Alured (1699&#150;1744) as governor of the Bermudas. Although his command was often strained and his salary frequently in arrears, Popple remained there until shortly before his death with only one visit to England, from November 1751 to November 1754. Having relinquished the stage for colonial administration, Popple's only other publications were a smooth but diffuse translation of the <span class="italic">Ars poetica</span> of Horace (1753) and an anonymous verse satire, <span class="italic">The Age of Dullness</span> (1757). Surviving manuscript works include a stage adaptation of Petronius's <span class="italic">Ephesian Matron</span> (BL, Add. MS 18614), translations from Juvenal, and several satires attacking religious conservatism and the literary opinions of William Warburton (Bodl. Oxf., MS Douce 201). Stuart Gillespie has further identified a manuscript at Yale University (Yale U., Beinecke L., Osborn fc 104, 1&#150;2) as Popple's complete translation of Horace's works and has published editions of the Juvenal and selections from the Horatian collection in two valuable essays in 2006 and 2007. All of these verses appear to have been written while Popple was in Bermuda and prepared for publication upon his return to London. Popple retired to London in late 1763 and died in Hampstead on 8 February 1764, bequeathing half his estate to his natural son, William Prosper Popple, and half to Elizabeth Fielding. He was buried on 13 February in Hampstead churchyard.<br>
