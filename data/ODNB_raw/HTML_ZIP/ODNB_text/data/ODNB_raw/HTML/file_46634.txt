<span class="headword">Blackburn,  Robert</span>  (1885&#150;1955), <span class="occ">aircraft designer and manufacturer</span>, was born on 26 March 1885 at Kirkstall near Leeds, the eldest of three sons of George William Blackburn, an engineer, and his wife, Kate, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Naylor. His career was influenced by his engineering background&#151;George Blackburn was works manager of William Green &amp; Sons, lawnmower and steamroller manufacturers&#151;and by the world's first heavier-than-air flight by the Wright brothers in 1903. He attended Leeds modern school and gained an honours degree in engineering at Leeds University; he became an associate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1906, and was given practical experience at his father's firm.<br>
<br>Blackburn considered the company's methods old-fashioned and went to the continent to study new techniques. In France he saw Wilbur Wright fly, and this proved the catalyst for his future career. He began to design an aircraft in Paris during that year (1908) and when he returned home his father set him up with a workshop in Benson Street, Leeds. There the first Blackburn aircraft, a monoplane powered by a 35 hp Green engine, was built. He had it transported to Marske by the Sea on the Yorkshire coast, where he taxied it along the sands at increasing speeds, eventually becoming airborne. Although the machine side-slipped into the ground and was wrecked, Blackburn had achieved his initial ambition and his second monoplane was more successful. Within three years he had proved himself as designer, builder, and pilot. By June 1914 he had become a manufacturer, founding his own company, the Blackburn Aeroplane and Motor Company. He was twice married, first to Jessica Tryphena Thompson on 31 October 1914; they had three sons and two daughters. This marriage was dissolved on 23 March 1936. His second wife was Phyllis Margaret Kirton, whom he married on 9 April 1936; they had two daughters. Both wives survived him.<br>
<br>Blackburn's genius for organizing large-scale production showed itself during the First World War, when the company received Admiralty and War Office orders and through subcontracting arrangements proved itself capable of undertaking aircraft work of every kind. In January 1920 he was made OBE for services in connection with the war.<br>
<br>During 1915 Blackburn had sponsored two important developments for his company&#151;the acquisition of an airfield and slipway at Brough, by the River Humber, and a decision to specialize in naval aircraft design and manufacture. In post-war years he demonstrated his organizational skill overseas, setting up, at the Greek government's invitation in 1925, a national aircraft factory near Athens. For this he was awarded the gold cross of the order of the Redeemer.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Blackburn's Brough works, to which all manufacturing had been transferred in 1936, built 1700 Fairey Swordfishes and 700 Barracudas&#151;in addition to its own Skuas and Rocs&#151;for the Royal Navy, plus Bothas for the RAF, and co-operated with the Clydeside shipbuilders Dennys of Dumbarton in building Sunderland flying boats. A 1948 amalgamation with General Aircraft led to production of the Beverley heavy freighter for the RAF, and Blackburn saw one of these on show at the Society of British Aerospace Companies' display only a few days before his death in Exeter from a heart attack on 10 September 1955.<br>
<br>In 1950 the Royal Aeronautical Society had made Blackburn an honorary fellow, and in 1953, when he went to live in Branscombe, Devon, in semi-retirement, he proudly said at a dinner given in his honour that 274 of his employees had served for twenty-one years. A friendly, unpretentious but determined man, who remained based in Yorkshire throughout his career, Blackburn inspired such loyalty; his original belief in the future of aviation never wavered.<br>
