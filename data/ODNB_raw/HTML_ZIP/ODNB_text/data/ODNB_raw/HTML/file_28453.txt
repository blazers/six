<span class="headword">Wale,  Samuel</span>  (1721?&#150;1786), <span class="occ">painter and book illustrator</span>, is said to have been born in Yarmouth, Norfolk, possibly on 25 April 1721, the son of Samuel and Margaret Wale. His background is obscure, however, and certain sources give his place of birth as London. Apart from producing a handful of oil paintings, he is chiefly remembered as one of the most prolific book illustrators of the eighteenth century and as a founder Royal Academician. He was apparently apprenticed to a goldsmith in 1735 and is said to have gone on to study drawing at the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96317', "St Martin's Lane Academy")</script>. He reportedly painted decorative designs for ceilings (although none survive) and tradesmen's signs, and in the 1740s he presented three views of London hospitals to the Foundling Hospital, where they still remain. Possibly also in the 1740s he painted a historical scene in oils of the Norfolk insurrectionary Robert Kett: entitled <span class="italic">Under the Oak of Reformation at his Camp on Mousehold Heath, Norwich</span>, it is now in the Norwich Castle Museum. About 1751 Wale designed a series of prints of Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, including a rococo <span class="italic">General View of Vauxhall Gardens</span>, engraved by Johann Sebastian M&uuml;ller (copy in the Victoria and Albert Museum).<br>
<br>Wale's chief occupation throughout his career was book illustration, and he produced designs for more than 100 publications. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he chose not to engrave his own designs, preferring to pass them on to engravers such as Charles Grignion. Although this may have reduced Wale's profit (designers were given one-off payments while engravers were paid for the time spent on the work), it had the effect of distancing him from the mechanical part of the trade and increasing his output. Despite often producing schematic designs (on at least one occasion, too&#151;when illustrating Thomas Percy's <span class="italic">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</span> (3 vols., 1765)&#151;he worked to the author's direction), Wale's range was broad. His <i>&#339;uvre</i> included dense allegorical work for the <span class="italic">Oxford Almanack</span> in 1753 and 1755 (original drawings are in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford); extensive religious illustrations (for instance, for <span class="italic">The Liturgy of the Church of England</span>, 1755, and J. Fleetwood's <span class="italic">Christian's Dictionary</span>, 1775); and graphic illustrations of violent crime for John Cooke's <span class="italic">The Tyburn Chronicle</span> (4 vols., 1768) and <span class="italic">The Newgate Calendar</span> (5 vols., 1773). Many of Wale's original drawings, usually in pen, ink, and wash, for the latter two publications survive in the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, Nottingham Castle Museum, and the Tate's Opp&eacute; Collection.<br>
<br>Wale was an active participant in every major effort of the mid-eighteenth century to establish an academy of the arts in London. In 1749 he assisted the architect John Gwynn with his <span class="italic">Proposals for Erecting a Public Academy</span>, and in 1755 both men were involved in an early abortive effort to found such an institution. In 1759 Wale was on the committee of artists chaired by Francis Hayman which successfully made an approach to the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce to request the use of their rooms to mount the first major exhibition of contemporary art in Britain. When the artists split after the first exhibition in 1760, Wale exhibited with the breakaway Society of Artists of Great Britain, and produced a vignette of <span class="italic">The Genius of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture Relieving the Distressed</span> for the catalogue of their 1761 exhibition. Other than in 1765, Wale exhibited at the Society of Artists every year until 1768, when he was among the twenty-two artists who petitioned the king to found a royal academy. After the foundation of the academy he was appointed as the first professor of perspective, on 17 December 1768. According to Edward Edwards, Wale possessed &#145;a good deal of science in the accessary parts of his art&#146;  (Edwards, 116), and he had demonstrated his skill in architectural drawing in the designs which he published with Gwynn for the decoration of St Paul's Cathedral in 1752: these were engraved by Edward Rooker, and a 1755 print from the series is held in the Victoria and Albert Museum. As a professor, Wale delivered six lectures a year for an annual salary of &pound;30, and he remained in the post for the rest of his life, despite reportedly being a very timid and diffident lecturer.<br>
<br>At both the Society of Artists and the Royal Academy, Wale showed &#145;stained drawings&#146; (pen and wash), including original designs for book illustration, and designs for &#145;an altar-piece for a gothic chapel&#146;. Over half of his exhibited works were scenes of British history, including <span class="italic">The Widow of Sir John Grey Petitioning Edward IV</span> (exh. Society of Artists, 1760) and <span class="italic">King Alfred Making a Code of Laws</span> (exh. RA, 1771); both were engraved by Grignion for Thomas Mortimer's <span class="italic">New History of England</span> (1764&#150;6). Wale was probably the most prolific illustrator of native historical scenes in the eighteenth century: although many designs were repeated in several historical texts, he produced more than 150 different designs for works such as Rapin-Thoyras's <span class="italic">History of England</span> (vol. 5, 1744&#150;7), Mortimer's <span class="italic">New History of England</span>, and W. H. Mountague's <span class="italic">New and Universal History of England</span> (2 vols., <i>c</i>.1771). The artist was described as &#145;the celebrated Wale&#146; on title-pages, and his narrative scenes of dramatic and sometimes obscure episodes in British history enlivened what were sometimes mediocre and derivative texts. His work appears to have influenced senior academicians such as Benjamin West, whose painting of <span class="italic">Oliver Cromwell Dissolving the Long Parliament</span> (exh. RA, 1783; Montclair Art Museum, New Jersey) is compositionally very similar to Wale's illustration of the same scene for Mortimer's <span class="italic">New History of England</span>.<br>
<br>In 1778 Wale suffered a paralytic stroke and became the first recipient of the Royal Academy's benefit fund for artist members incapable of work. He continued to serve as professor of perspective, but because of ill health was allowed to deliver his lectures from home. In 1782 he was also given the post of librarian of the Royal Academy, which he held until his death, on 6 February 1786 at his home, Little Court, Castle Street, Leicester Fields. Wale was apparently unmarried and childless and left his copperplates, prints, and belongings to his friend John Gwynn, with whom he shared his house, and his nurse, Mrs Mary Gurpin. He was buried in St Martin-in-the-Fields.<br>
