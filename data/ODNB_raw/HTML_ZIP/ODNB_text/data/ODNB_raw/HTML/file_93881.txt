<span class="headword">Cook, Sir  Alan Hugh</span>  (1922&#150;2004), <span class="occ">physicist and college head</span>, was born on 2 December 1922 at 5 Garnett Villas, Felsted, Essex, the eldest of the six children of Reginald Thomas Cook (<i>d</i>. 1954), a customs and excise officer, and his wife, Ethel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Saxon (<i>d</i>. 1986), who held various positions in the Congregational church. The family were active churchgoers and Cook was to remain deeply committed to the Christian faith throughout his life. His primary education was first at the village school at Felsted and then at West Leigh School. In 1933 he came top in the entrance examination to Westcliff High School for Boys, where he received an excellent education, particularly in the physical sciences, and he began his lifelong interest in the earth sciences. In 1939 he won a major entrance scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, which he entered the following year to read the natural science tripos, taking geology as his additional experimental subject.<br>
<br>After taking his BA degree in 1943 Cook was drafted into the Admiralty signals establishment as a temporary experimental officer, where he was involved in electronic counter-measures. After his war service he returned to Cambridge, where he studied for a doctorate under the supervision of Edward Bullard and B. C. Browne. The topic of his dissertation was precise measurements of gravity in the British Isles, which was to lead to an interest in a very wide range of problems in precision measurement in the physical sciences. These were to form the core of his most distinguished scientific work. On 30 January 1948 he married Isabell Weir Adamson, a 23-year old hospital cook, and daughter of James Lamb Adamson, engineer; the couple had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Cook's first published papers concerned the gravity surveys of the British Isles and anomalous effects due to different geological formations. After a period as a research assistant at Cambridge he followed Edward Bullard to the National Physical Laboratory at Teddington, south-west London, where he carried out a number of innovative and important experiments stimulated by his geophysical interests. These included the absolute measurement of the density of mercury, which is essential in order to obtain precise estimates of atmospheric pressure. Cook's measurements established the density of mercury to one part in a million. This was a brilliant achievement and remained the standard result for many decades. Cook's interest in precise gravity measurements continued with his clever experiments to measure the absolute acceleration of falling bodies, which achieved an accuracy of one part in 10 million by 1965. It also led to his interest in using the precisely known orbits of the Sputnik satellites to determine in detail the earth's gravitational potential.<br>
<br>Another important interest was precision measurement for time standards, in particular the use of the hyperfine lines in the spectrum of cadmium as time and length standards. With Dick Rowley, Cook became involved in interference spectroscopy, which enabled these delicate experiments to be carried out with very high accuracy. In turn these experiments resulted in the use of laser interferometry for precise distance measurements. Cook's interest in masers and lasers led to a new direction of research with the discovery in 1965 of extremely high brightness sources of microwave radiation of the hydroxyl radical by radio astronomers at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1966 he wrote a seminal paper in which he interpreted the radiation as beamed maser emission under interstellar conditions. His long-standing interest in masers resulted in his textbook <span class="italic">Celestial Masers</span> (1977).<br>
<br>In 1966 Cook was appointed superintendent of the quantum metrology division at the National Physical Laboratory and in 1969 was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London. He returned to academic life in 1969 with his appointment as professor of geophysics at Edinburgh University, where he set up the geophysics department, recruited three lecturers, and introduced geophysics into the university's science courses. He remained only three years in Edinburgh before being appointed Jacksonian professor of natural philosophy at the Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge. His principal scientific achievement in Cambridge was to set up the laboratory astrophysics group, which continued his interests in precise measurements in astrophysics and geophysics. Innovative experiments in microwave spectroscopy were carried out by Cook with Bob Butcher, and tests of the inverse square law of gravitation at short distances were performed with Y. T. Chen and Alan Metherell. An ambitious attempt to develop a large-scale version of the Cavendish experiment to determine the constant of gravitation was sadly abandoned with the early death of Cook's collaborator, Antonio Marussi of the University of Trieste. The culmination of his interests in experimental gravitation was his book, co-written with Chen, <span class="italic">Gravitational Experiments in the Laboratory</span> (1993).<br>
<br>Cook took a very active interest in university affairs and became head of the Cavendish Laboratory in 1979. In 1983 he was appointed master of Selwyn College, the first head of the college not to have taken holy orders. This was a position he greatly enjoyed and which he carried out for ten years with characteristic humour, dignity, and humanity. He was also chairman and member of numerous national science committees during a period of considerable financial stringency, among them the Science and Engineering Research Council's astronomy, space and radio board. For his many services to science, he was knighted in 1988. Following his retirement in 1993 from the mastership of Selwyn much of his energy was devoted to the history of science. The culmination of this interest was his biography of Edmund Halley (1997) whose biography&#151;among others&#151;he also contributed to the <span class="italic">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</span>. In 1996 he became editor of <span class="italic">Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London</span>, the society's main journal in the history of science. He enjoyed this role and contributed numerous articles and editorials. He died from cancer on 23 July 2004 at Arthur Rank House, Cambridge. He was survived by his wife, Isabell, and their two children.<br>
