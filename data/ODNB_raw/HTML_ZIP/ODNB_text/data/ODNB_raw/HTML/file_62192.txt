<span class="headword">Thorold, Sir  Nathaniel</span>, baronet  (<em>d.</em> 1764), <span class="occ">entrepreneur and adventurer</span>, was the son of John Thorold and his wife Anne (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Alcock), of the Grantham branch of the family. He inherited Harmston Hall, Lincolnshire, quite unexpectedly in January 1738 following the death of his distant cousin Sir Samuel Thorold, second baronet. He was created a baronet on 24 March 1741. Overwhelmed by this sudden change in circumstance, he ran through his new fortune and, deeply in debt, was obliged to go abroad in 1745. He left in a hurry, for it was discovered that breakfast was still on the table, the chairs hastily pushed aside. But Sir Nathaniel emerged triumphant. In the Netherlands he befriended a Jewish merchant, and together they devised a method of salting cod so that the fish would last long enough to be transported to southern Europe. Thereafter he moved to Italy, and settled first in Leghorn. There he lived with a beautiful young woman from Capri, Anna della Noce, the wife of a Signor Antonio Canale, who accepted his wife's affair. However, the scandal of the <i>m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois</i> drove Thorold and his lover from Leghorn to Naples, where he re-established his salted cod business. Further scandal forced the couple to move to the island of Capri. There Sir Nathaniel built a large and beautiful home, the Palazzo Inglese, and his business flourished. He and Anna had several children, who took the name Canale. In 1754 the bishop of Capri wrote in his report to the pope, <i>Ad limina apostolorum</i>, that &#145;a scandal had been caused by the co-habitation, for almost ten years, of a certain married woman with an heretical English nobleman&#146;. However, the pope refused to be drawn on the issue. Thorold lived with Anna on Capri until his death at the Palazzo Inglese on 28 August 1764. He is said to have been buried near the springs of Marucella, where tradition has it that he introduced the growing of cress, sent out to him from Lincolnshire. His son Samuel, to whom his father had left his English property, came to Harmston to inherit, assumed the name Thorold, and was made high sheriff of Lincolnshire at the age of twenty-five.<br>
