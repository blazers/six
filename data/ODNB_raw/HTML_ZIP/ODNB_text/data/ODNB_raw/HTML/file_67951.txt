<span class="headword">Adson,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1587?, <em>d.</em> 1640), <span class="occ">musician and composer</span>, may have been the Johannes Adson baptized at Watford, Northamptonshire, on 24 January 1587. Nothing else is known of his origins. By 1604, well before the usual age to finish an apprenticeship (which was about twenty-four), he was employed as a cornetto player at the court of Duke Charles III of Lorraine, having been recruited in England by the French cornetto player Jean Presse. When the duke died in 1608, an engraving of his funeral showed players of five cornettos, two sackbuts, and two bass shawms alongside a group of singers. By 1613 Adson had returned to England. On 23 May 1614 he was appointed to the London waits and paid for serving from the previous Christmas. He kept this place until his death.<br>
<br>In 1621 Adson published <span class="italic">Courtly Masking Ayres for Violins, Consorts and Cornetts</span>, which contains twenty-one anonymous pieces in five parts and ten in six parts, largely taken from the court masque repertory. The music for masques was often provided by composers outside the court, so it is not surprising that a wait like Adson had access to it. His collection was dedicated to George Villiers, marquess of Buckingham (the unpopular favourite of James I and Charles I), who was a frequent participant in masques and may have sponsored the publication. A few pieces of Adson's own have survived in manuscript.<br>
<br>On 4 November 1633 Adson was sworn into a court place as a musician &#145;for the flute and cornet&#146;  (Ashbee, 73), being paid from the previous Michaelmas. A warrant dated 13 January 1636 to pay Adson &#145;for a treble cornett and a treble recorder by him provided and bought for his Majesty's service&#146;  (ibid., 85) shows that he was required to play the recorder and perhaps other wind instruments beyond those that his nominal place warranted.<br>
<br>Adson had ten children with at least two wives: on 26 February 1614 he was licensed to marry Jane Lanerie, and by 1629, after her death, he had taken his second wife, Anne. It was presumably on behalf of his eldest son, Islay or Islip (<i>bap</i>. 1615), that he petitioned the City of London's court of aldermen on 15 September 1634 &#145;in regard of his charge in breeding up a son to perfection in voice, song and music for the City's service&#146;  (repertories of the court of aldermen, fol. 235) and was granted the proceeds of making someone a freeman of the city by redemption (&pound;2 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.). Another son, Roger (<i>bap</i>. 1621), was apprenticed to Ambrose Beeland, a fellow London wait and later a fellow royal musician.<br>
<br>Soon after he joined the court Adson ran into a conflict of loyalties. Many of the royal musicians and some independent musicians took part in James Shirley's masque <span class="italic">The Triumph of Peace</span>, presented jointly by the inns of court on 3 February 1634 at Whitehall and ten days later at Merchant Taylors' Hall. For the second performance Bulstrode Whitelocke, in overall charge of the music, chose the wind musicians (&#145;loud music&#146;) from the Blackfriars and Cockpit theatres to fill two chariots for processions before and after the masque. The Blackfriars musicians consisted of six of the London waits, including Adson. In a letter to Whitelocke dated 12 February, the younger Nicholas Lanier, the master of the king's musick, claimed that the royal musicians had been excluded at the suggestion of Adson, whom he dubbed &#145;an unworthy fellow&#146;  (Sabol, 18&#150;19). Whitelocke replied that he had &#145;thought the service was too mean&#146; for the royal musicians and begged Lanier to &#145;take no dislike to Mr Adson upon this occasion&#146;. In the event, Adson was one of the twelve court wind musicians who played in the processions.<br>
<br>Adson's association with the King's Company, who played at both the Blackfriars Theatre and the Globe Theatre, is confirmed by two references to him in the company's plays. He took the minor role of an invisible spirit in <span class="italic">The Late Lancashire Witches</span> by Thomas Heywood and Richard Brome (1634); and his music is referred to, in a playfully derogatory manner, in William Cavendish's <span class="italic">The Country Captain</span> (1639&#150;40).<br>
<br>Adson died in London on 29 June 1640 and was buried the following day at St Giles Cripplegate, London, the church of the parish in which he had lived (on Redcross Street) since about 1615. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
