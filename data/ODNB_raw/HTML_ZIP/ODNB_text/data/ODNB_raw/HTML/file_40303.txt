<span class="headword">Dalrymple,  James</span>  (1859&#150;1934), <span class="occ">tramway manager</span>, was born on 15 September 1859 at 3 Gaskill Street, Charlton upon Medlock, Lancashire, the son of James Dalrymple, a draper, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Adams. His family was Scottish and in 1864 moved to Gatehouse of Fleet, Kirkcudbrightshire, where Dalrymple attended school until the age of fourteen and afterwards worked at the Union Bank. In 1880 he was transferred to its Glasgow office, where in 1881 he entered municipal service. Having qualified as a chartered accountant, he became accountant to the newly formed municipal tramways department in 1894, rising in 1902 to deputy general manager and in 1904 to manager.<br>
<br>In his obituary in the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> (2 July 1934) Dalrymple is described as an &#145;energetic and competent organiser&#146; under whose leadership the tramways reached &#145;a high state of perfection&#146; and &#145;spread farther and farther into the countryside&#146;. He controlled the second largest tramway undertaking in the UK with well over 8000 employees and a book value of about &pound;7 million; remarkably for a municipal concern, the entire capital debt was paid off by 1917 despite a policy of low fares. The undertaking was a progressive one, with well-built trams fitted with the latest features, such as windscreens and upholstered seats. In 1923 he persuaded the corporation of Glasgow to take over the neighbouring company-operated lines in Airdrie and Paisley, but Dalrymple's expansionist dictum of &#145;we've still a long way to go&#146; was not accepted without controversy, and for his part he did not always approve of voter-driven pressure for ever lower fares, though in the event increased passenger numbers more than compensated for these.<br>
<br>Dalrymple's organizing ability was shown to supreme effect in the First World War when he recruited a total of 10,000 men from the city within fourteen months, including a battalion raised from tramway men in September 1914 within a record twenty-four hours. Advertisements and military bands were carried on the trams and collections made for war schemes, though in the latter case Dalrymple had to be reprimanded for selling tickets involving lottery prizes. The tramway workshops were used for war work, including building aircraft bodies, and in 1920 Dalrymple was made a CBE for his contribution to the war effort. His own military experience was confined to a volunteer rifle brigade. Over 3000 tramway men joined up, so pre-war plans for employing women as conductors were put into effect in March 1915, followed in November by what were probably the first ever women drivers in the UK, a development which aroused much interest from other hard-pressed tramway managers.<br>
<br>Dalrymple served on two committees of the Board of Trade (the department then responsible for tramways) and was a member of the council and president (1910&#150;11) of the Municipal Tramways Association (MTA), in whose journal he published a number of professional papers. He was consultant to tramways in Bombay, Chicago, Johannesburg, and S&atilde;o Paulo; the last two of these were after his retirement in 1926, which resulted directly from his handling of labour relations, but was also the consequence of a long history of conflict between a strong-minded manager and the elected tramways committee. After the general strike he dismissed 316 men and refused to reinstate them, despite a decision by the committee to do so. Although supported on a close vote in the full council, he did not withdraw his resignation. Described variously by councillors as a sympathetic manager and as arbitrary and unreasonable, Dalrymple was clearly something of a martinet whose approach was becoming outdated as the political balance changed on the council. J. Beckett of the MTA nevertheless described him on 9 December 1926 as having had &#145;one of the greatest careers in the tramways service of this country. Among English-speaking peoples no man is better known in the tramway world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Tramway and Railway World</span>, 60.338). As well as being a JP, his outside interests included charitable and Scottish societies. A stocky, bearded man who appears in numerous official photographs, Dalrymple was married to Elizabeth Gardner McGowan (who survived him), and they had a daughter and a son. In June 1934 he had a cerebral haemorrhage and died a few days later, on 1 July, in a nursing home at 3 Claremont Terrace, Glasgow. After a funeral service at Lansdowne church, Glasgow, on 4 July, he was buried at Gatehouse of Fleet.<br>
