<span class="headword">Thompson,  John</span>  (1785&#150;1866), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born in Manchester on 25 May 1785, the son of Richard Thompson, a London merchant, and his wife, Sarah. He was baptized at the collegiate church, Manchester, on 12 June 1785. Skilled in several media, he ranked at the head of British wood-engravers for fifty years. Wood-engraving was developed into a significant art in Newcastle by Thomas Bewick and in London by Robert Branston, whose pupils Thompson joined at the age of fourteen. These engravers devised a &#145;white line&#146; technique which achieved effects peculiar to wood-engraving, epitomized in Bewick's <span class="italic">British Birds</span> (2 vols., 1797&#150;1804). Comparison of these with Thompson's illustrations for W. Yarrell's <span class="italic">British Birds</span> (1843) shows Thompson's technique to be more exquisitely finished but not more vivid. Thompson's most individual work was in engraving over 900 illustrations by John Thurston, who, having been a wood-engraver, drew to suit the wood-engravers' technique; examples may be found in J. Puckle, <span class="italic">The Club</span> (1817), Tasso's <span class="italic">Jerusalem Delivered</span> (1817), and Thomas Dibdin's <span class="italic">London Theatre</span> (1814&#150;18). The minute skill of Thompson's engravings was sometimes praised as rivalling copper-engraving, for example, the portrait frontispiece to Samuel Butler's <span class="italic">Poetical Remains</span> (1827), but this was not the way forward for wood-engraving. The new possibilities which it offered included cheap pictorial journalism, but Thompson contributed little here; rather, he worked closely with the fine Chiswick Press, which catered for connoisseurs of illustrated books. Another virtue of wood-engraving was that it permitted exact reproduction of line drawings, though this meant sacrificing the &#145;white line&#146; technique. Thompson's skill in facsimile engraving was shown in his rendering of the sprightly line of caricaturists such as George Cruikshank  (<span class="italic">Mornings at Bow Street</span>, 1824) and (for French publishers) Grandville and Johannot. Facsimile wood-engraving made possible the celebrated illustrated books of the 1860s, inaugurated by the Moxon edition of Tennyson's <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1857), to which Thompson contributed. Thompson signed his engravings with his full name in capital letters, and with a monogram of his initials, T superimposed on I (for J), which produced a Latin cross with serifs.<br>
<br>Thompson's address in the 1820s was Barden Place, Peckham; from the 1830s, 3 (later 5) Bedford Place, Kensington, convenient for business with the Chiswick Press and convivial evenings with its owner, Charles Whittingham the younger; and from <i>c</i>.1847 to 1859, 1 Campden Hill Terrace, Kensington. In 1819&#150;21 he assisted in Applegath and Cowper's attempts to produce forgery-proof banknotes, and in the 1850s he engraved in relief on steel Maclise's vignette of Britannia, which appeared on English banknotes from 1855 for more than a hundred years. In 1838 he got to know Henry Cole, then writing an article on wood-engraving. When Cole worked on the penny post in 1839&#150;40, he commissioned Thompson to engrave on brass a postage cover design by Mulready. The Cole and Thompson families, neighbours in Kensington, became friendly. Cole's wife's sister married Thompson's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27259/', "Charles Thurston Thompson")</script>, who, with his brother <a href="#cosubject_67714">Richard [<i>see below</i>]</a>, worked under Cole at the South Kensington Museum. In 1843&#150;4 Thompson led the wood-engravers of London (with Cole's support) in opposition to the teaching of wood-engraving to women in the Government School of Design, but, when Cole took over the school in 1852, Thompson became director of a revived female wood-engraving class until its abolition in June 1859. He lectured on wood-engraving and formed a collection of historic and modern examples, which he used as teaching aids and donated in 1857 to the new South Kensington Museum, where they were on display during the museum's early years. Thompson's siblings <a href="#cosubject_27258">Charles [<i>see below</i>]</a> and Eliza and his daughters Isabel and Augusta were wood-engravers. He married Harriott Eaton in 1807; five of their eight children survived to adulthood. He died a widower at 9 Vicarage Gardens, Kensington, on 20 February 1866, and was buried on 27 February at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>

<a name="cosubject_27258"></a><span class="headword">Charles Thompson</span>  (1791&#150;1843), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born in London, the younger brother of John Thompson, and trained with Robert Branston and his brother John. In 1816 he visited Paris to investigate prospects for wood-engraving, and, encouraged by the printing firm Didot, stayed there, training French engravers and contributing to books illustrated by Grandville, Gigoux, Johannot, and others. He died at his home in Bourg-la-Reine, near Paris, on 19 May 1843.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_67714"></a><span class="headword">Richard Anthony Thompson</span>  (1819&#150;1908), <span class="occ">art administrator</span>, was baptized on 15 September 1819 at St Giles's, Camberwell, London, the son of John Thompson and his wife, Harriott. He was employed at the Great Exhibition of 1851, in the English section of the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1855, and at subsequent international exhibitions. He was one of the first curators at the South Kensington Museum, having joined on 12 January 1857 to set up its educational collection, of which he was keeper until promoted in 1863 to be in charge of the general arrangement of the museum. He was an assistant director from 1866 until his retirement at the end of 1891, and acting director from 1876 to 1878 and in 1886. He died on 25 March 1908.<br>
