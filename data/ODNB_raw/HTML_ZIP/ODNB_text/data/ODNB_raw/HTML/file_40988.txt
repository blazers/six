<span class="headword">Young, Sir  Frederick</span>  (1817&#150;1913), <span class="occ">imperial publicist</span>, was born on 21 June 1817 at Mitre Building, Limehouse, London, the third son of the seven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40809/', "George Frederick Young (1791&#150;1870)")</script>, London shipbuilder and politician, and his wife, Mary (<i>c</i>.1790&#150;1876), youngest daughter of John Abbot, brewer of Canterbury. Young was educated first by his mother and then, from the age of ten, at Dr Burnet's school at Homerton, Middlesex, for five years. In 1833 he joined a family business, Young, Dowson &amp; Co., copper merchants, as clerk; from 1839 he was a partner (the firm continued to make brass fittings for ships until 1911 but was latterly moribund). In the 1840s he also set up with Christopher Dowson as a baker of ships' biscuits, living on the premises in Limehouse and there entertaining Browning, Domett, and other &#145;colloquials&#146;. With his father he was actively involved in promoting Victoria Park in east London (1840&#150;45) and in the management of the London Hospital. He also helped to found Bromley cricket club, travelled to Europe and the Mediterranean, and dabbled in a few literary ventures. Above all he pursued his wish to marry his childhood sweetheart Cecilia (<i>c</i>.1820&#150;1873), daughter of Thomas Drane, brewer of Torquay. In 1836 they agreed not to meet for three years, after which they were allowed to engage to marry in five years. They married in April 1845 and soon had four children.<br>
<br>At this time Young came under the spell of his father's close associate in the colonization of New Zealand, Edward Gibbon Wakefield. Already a shareholder in the New Zealand Company, Young became shipping manager in 1850 to the Canterbury Association, an experiment in high-Anglican colonization, and he helped to send out 1500&#150;2000 emigrants before the venture failed in 1852. Throughout his long life Young regarded Wakefield's <span class="italic">Art of Colonisation</span> (1849) as the bible of British colonialism, inspiring his own interest in emigration (or &#145;transplantation&#146; as he preferred) as well as informing his guiding principle of imperial federation. In 1857 Young left east London for Cobham, in rural Surrey, to bring up his family; he also enjoyed hunting, joined the volunteers, and helped to rebuild the parish church. He produced several &#145;penny readings&#146; (see <span class="italic">Long Ago and now</span>, 1863), including an admiring biography of Garibaldi, whom he met in 1864. In 1867 the family were obliged to move back to London (to Kensington) and Young resumed an active role in the East End, promoting working-class emigration&#151;he was chairman of the National Colonial Emigration League&#151;and standing (unsuccessfully) for the new Tower Hamlets school board in 1870. As chairman of the Epping Forest Fund he did much to secure the act of 1878 which preserved its open spaces. In the 1880s as a trustee of the Beaumont Trust he helped to found the People's Palace in Mile End. He was also chairman of the Tower Hamlets magistrates until 1894.<br>
<br>Above all Young became a vigorous proponent of the ideal of closer imperial unity. He took a leading part in protests against the withdrawal of British troops from New Zealand in 1868&#150;9, an episode which contributed to the foundation in 1868 of the Royal Colonial Institute (RCI), of which he became a fellow in 1869 and a member of council in 1871. The sudden and unexpected death of his wife in July 1873 threw Young into intense despondency. But after a recuperative European tour with his daughters, he became honorary secretary of the RCI, in 1874, and threw himself enthusiastically into its affairs, doing much to raise its public profile. He initiated a correspondence published as <span class="italic">Imperial Federation</span> in 1876, and for the rest of his life forcefully advocated the idea of an imperial parliament. He did much to keep the ideal of &#145;Greater Britain&#146; in the public mind, and took an active part in the Imperial Federation League (1883&#150;93) and in the British Empire League. Having attended, on behalf of the RCI, the first Colonial Conference in 1887, he became KCMG in January 1888.<br>
<br>Young kept up a regular correspondence with like-minded British and colonial politicians, including the seventh duke of Manchester. Later in life he travelled to South Africa (1889) and Canada (1901), propagating the cause he believed essential to Britain's destiny. In line with his father's earlier protectionism he supported &#145;fair trade&#146; in the early 1880s and commercial union of the empire in the 1890s; in <span class="italic">Exit Party</span> (1900) he hailed Rosebery as the leader of a non-partisan Liberal Imperialism but turned to Chamberlain's tariff reform in 1903. Slim and erect in bearing, but repetitious with age, Young survived as a venerable patriarch of empire, campaigning for a monument to Wakefield in New Zealand in 1907 and active in the Royal Colonial Institute as late as 1909. By then he was living in straitened circumstances, tended by his daughter Ada, and he was eventually reconciled to his son, Brigadier-General Sir George Frederick Young (1846&#150;1919), whose allegedly unsuitable marriage in India in 1874&#151;to Caroline, widow of Captain W. A. Cripps&#151;had led to their estrangement. Young died at his home, Leny, Cobham, Surrey, on 9 November 1913 and was buried with his wife at Reigate, Surrey, on 12 November.<br>
