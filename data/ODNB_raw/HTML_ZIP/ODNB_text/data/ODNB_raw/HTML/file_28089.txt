<span class="headword">Aken,  Joseph  van</span>  (<em>c.</em>1699&#150;1749), <span class="occ">drapery painter and painter of genre and conversation pieces</span>, was born probably in Antwerp, where he first practised as a painter. The title to a mezzotint of him by John Faber after Thomas Hudson gives his name as Vanhaeken, under which spelling of his name, rendered &#145;Van Haeken&#146;, he appeared in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. He moved to London about 1720 with his artist brothers Arnold and Alexander. His Flemish-style conversation pieces, such as <span class="italic">An English Family at Tea</span> (Tate Gallery, London) and <span class="italic">Schoolmaster with a Class of Boys</span> (City Museum and Art Gallery, Hereford), painted on arrival in England, are of considerable interest to the social historian, as are his crowded city scenes, <span class="italic">The Stocks Market</span> (Bank of England, London) and <span class="italic">Covent Garden Market</span> (Museum of London). His powers of observation were most profitably employed when he turned his hand to the depiction of &#145;silks satins Velvets, gold &amp; embroideryes&#146; for a number of London's leading portrait painters, including Thomas Hudson and Allan Ramsay  (Vertue, 3.117). His particular skill in differentiating between fabrics and in delineating jewels, so accurately as to enable identification of, for example, a Spitalfields silk or a paste necklace, make the portraits on which he worked a rich resource for the study of costume.<br>
<br>Hogarth bitterly remarked that an industrious drapery painter could not &#145;fail of getting a fortune&#146; and often painted nine-tenths of a portrait, though &#145;all the reputation is engrossed by the fizmonger&#146;  (Kitson, 100&#150;01). Van Aken's services were jealously guarded by those fortunate enough to secure them. Many portraitists sent their canvases out to his studio (Reynolds is said to have left his apprenticeship to Hudson after refusing to carry a canvas to van Aken's house in the rain), but a few provincial painters such as Henry Winstanley and the amateur Rhoda Delaval sent painted heads on small pieces of cloth to be let in to full-size canvases on arrival in London.<br>
<br>Neither Hogarth nor Stephen Slaughter employed a drapery painter, but the majority of portraitists were willing to pay approximately 4 to 5<i>s</i>. a day to a run-of-the-mill practitioner and much more to someone of van Aken's ability. It appears that Jeremiah Davison, Henry Pickering, and Isaac Whood, as well as Hudson and Ramsay, all used van Aken's services, some giving guidelines as to hands, pose, and background, and others not. His earnings enabled him to form his own collection of works of art, which included Rembrandt's <span class="italic">The Entombment</span> (Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow) and three &#145;models in clay&#146; by Michael Rysbrack  (Vertue, 3.90). He won the respect and friendship of fellow artists and joined Hogarth, Hudson, Francis Hayman, and the sculptor Henry Cheere on a trip to Paris in 1748, going on to Flanders and the northern Netherlands with Hudson and Cheere to visit some of the leading continental painters of the day. Van Aken died in London on 4 July 1749, leaving a widow but no children. He was buried in St Pancras Church in London. At his death Hudson and Ramsay were joint executors of his will.<br>
