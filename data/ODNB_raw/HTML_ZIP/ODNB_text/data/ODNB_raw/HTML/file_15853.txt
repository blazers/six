<span class="headword">Lacy,  Hugh  de</span>, earl of Ulster  (<em>d.</em> 1242), <span class="occ">magnate and soldier</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15852/', "Hugh de Lacy (d. 1186)")</script> and his first wife, Rose of Monmouth, and younger brother of Walter de Lacy (<i>d</i>. 1241), lord of Meath. Hugh was a minor on his father's death, but had reached his majority by 1195 when he and John de Courcy led an army to Athlone and negotiated a treaty with Cathal Crobderg &Oacute; Conchobair, king of Connacht. At about this time he was also the recipient of a speculative grant from William de Burgh of ten cantreds in Connacht, a grant confirmed by John, count of Mortain. From his brother Walter he received in Meath the barony of Ratoath and land in Morgallion, and by his marriage, some time between 1194 and 1199, to Lesceline de Verdon, daughter of Bertram de Verdon (<i>d</i>. 1192) and sister of Thomas and Nicholas de Verdon, he acquired the Cooley peninsula, Louth, and land north of Dundalk. In 1201 Lacy and Courcy supported an attempt by Cathal Crobderg to regain the kingship of Connacht from his great-nephew Cathal Carrach &Oacute; Conchobair, but they were heavily defeated. Lacy then arrested Courcy and Cathal Crobderg but released them soon after. King John had grown suspicious of Courcy and used Lacy against him. In 1203 Lacy defeated Courcy at Down and in the following year captured and released him again. In November 1204 Hugh and Walter de Lacy were granted eight cantreds in Ulster and on 29 May 1205 Hugh was granted all Ulster as earl to hold as Courcy had held it on the day he was captured by Lacy.<br>
<br>In 1206 Lacy plundered Armagh, causing the archbishop of Armagh, Echdonn Mac Gilla Uidhir, to travel to England to complain to the king. In 1208 he attacked the Meath lands of the justiciar, Meiler fitz Henry, and captured his castle of Ardnurcher in Westmeath. This was done in support of William (I) Marshal whose position in Ireland was being undermined by King John. At the same time John had begun to persecute his former friend William (III) de Briouze who had quarrelled with the king over the murder of Arthur of Brittany. Briouze held land in Limerick and his daughter was married to Walter de Lacy. John hounded him for money owed to the crown and in 1209 he and his family fled to Ireland. Briouze returned to Wales the same year but his family were sheltered by Hugh de Lacy. In 1210 John arrived in Ireland to crush his opponents there. As Lacy moved north into Ulster he ravaged north Louth, thereby revenging himself on his brother-in-law, Nicholas de Verdon, who had objected to the marriage portion assigned to Lacy and attempted to claw some of it back. Lacy was chased from Ulster and fled to Scotland, where he spent a short time at St Andrews. Either before his expulsion or following his restoration in 1227 he granted the church of Carlingford in Louth to St Andrews. He and Walter de Lacy appear to have travelled to France and may have sheltered among the monks of St Taurin in &Eacute;vreux. Hugh de Lacy later participated in the Albigensian crusade, being present at the siege of Toulouse in 1216 and the death of Simon de Montfort on 25 June 1218.<br>
<br>Negotiations for Lacy's restoration were already underway by the time of John's death. Soon after the coronation of Henry III in 1216 he was given safe conduct to meet the Marshal, and this was repeated in February 1217. Lacy, however, appears to have remained in France until 1219. The death of the Marshal in that year and the rise to power of Hubert de Burgh signalled a less sympathetic approach by the government. In 1220 Lacy responded by joining Llywelyn ab Iorwerth of Gwynedd in attacking the lands of William (II) Marshal in Wales. Attempts were again made to reach a compromise with a safe conduct being issued to Lacy to travel to England in 1221. He seems to have been confident of success at this point and in 1222 used the title earl of Ulster when witnessing a grant by Ranulf (III), earl of Chester, whose nephew and eventual successor, John the Scot, was married to Llywelyn's daughter Helen.<br>
<br>In December 1222 Lacy was offered his land in Meath and his wife's land in Louth, but he demanded the return of Ulster. The king offered to place it instead in the custody of the earls of Chester, Salisbury, and Gloucester and Walter de Lacy for five years, but in the summer of 1223 these lords refused to accept it. By this time Lacy was preparing to invade Ireland and the king sent letters from the pope to the archbishop of Dublin excommunicating anyone who aided him. Henry III's sister, Joan, the wife of Alexander II, king of Scotland, wrote to her brother to inform him that Alexander would not aid Lacy but that the king of Norway might do so. Lacy was involved in supporting one candidate for the kingship of Man and the Isles, Olaf, against the incumbent ruler, his brother Ragnvald. In 1224 the kingdom was divided between them with Ragnvald keeping Man and some of the isles and Olaf taking the rest. The latter subsequently supported Lacy's invasion of Ireland.<br>
<br>Lacy arrived in Ireland late in 1223 and went to Meath where he joined his half-brother, William Gorm de Lacy, in plundering his enemies. On 19 June 1224 the new justiciar, William (II) Marshal, arrived in Ireland and with the support of Walter de Lacy besieged Trim Castle which had been taken by adherents of Hugh. Marshal sent his cousin William le Gros with a force to relieve Carrickfergus Castle in Ulster which was being besieged by Hugh. Trim was taken and Hugh de Lacy abandoned the siege of Carrickfergus and joined his ally A&eacute;d M&eacute;ith &Oacute; N&eacute;ill, king of T&iacute;r Eoghain, in destroying the castle of Coleraine which had been built by Thomas of Galloway after Lacy's expulsion in 1210. He and A&eacute;d then turned south and harried the Verdon lands around Dundalk. A large force under William Marshal met them at the Ulster passes in October and Lacy surrendered. His captivity, however, seems not to have been onerous. About May 1225 he was granted 200 marks by the king at the instance of Marshal and in May of the following year all his lands were placed in the custody of Walter de Lacy, with Marshal acting as guarantor. Finally in April 1227 Ulster was restored to Hugh as earl, with the proviso that it would return to the crown in the absence of a male heir.<br>
<br>The lands of the Galloway lords Alan and Thomas were also excluded from the grant to Hugh de Lacy, but he continued to undermine their position. In 1228 he rebuilt Coleraine Castle for himself. In 1229 his daughter married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49362/', "Alan of Galloway")</script> but the Scottish lord did not recover his interests in Ulster. When Alan died in 1234 he left three daughters and an illegitimate son, Thomas. Alexander II was determined that Galloway would be divided between the daughters, but in 1236 an unsuccessful invasion was launched from Ulster by Thomas, with Lacy's support. As part of his attempts to neutralize Galloway involvement in Ulster, Lacy also introduced into the earldom the family of Bisset of Moray, some of whose members murdered Patrick the son of Thomas, earl of Atholl, Alan of Galloway's brother, in 1242.<br>
<br>In 1230 Lacy's ally and client A&eacute;d M&eacute;ith &Oacute; N&eacute;ill died and in the ensuing succession contest Lacy supported not A&eacute;d's son Domnall but his rival Domnall Mac Lochlainn. In 1234&#150;5 Mac Lochlainn killed &Oacute; N&eacute;ill but soon turned against the earl. In 1238 the Irish of Ulaid (Antrim and Down) revolted against Lacy and appealed to Mac Lochlainn for help. Lacy was expelled but returned the following autumn with the justiciar Maurice Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1257). Domnall was banished to Connacht and Brian &Oacute; N&eacute;ill, a nephew of A&eacute;d M&eacute;ith, was set up in his place. Mac Lochlainn regained power in 1239 but in 1241 he and his family were finally destroyed by &Oacute; N&eacute;ill.<br>
<br>In 1228 Hugh de Lacy was summoned by the king to fight in France and in 1234 he demonstrated his loyalty to Henry III by participating in the murder of Richard Marshal on the Curragh. Considering the favour shown to Lacy by both Richard's older brother and father this was a particularly unpleasant incident in the earl's career. In the following year he was involved in the conquest of Connacht by Richard de Burgh. His reward was the revival of the grant made to him almost forty years earlier by Richard's father William. He was granted five cantreds in Sligo for the service of ten knights. Apart from founding the manor of Meelick, Lacy did not involve himself personally in Connacht and granted most of his lands there to others such as Maurice Fitzgerald, Jordan of Exeter, Gerald de Prendergast, Peter of Birmingham, and Miles de Nangle. In 1235 he also reached agreement with Roesia de Verdon, daughter of Nicholas de Verdon and niece of his wife, Lesceline, about the half of the Verdon lands he had acquired by his marriage. For a payment of &pound;200 these were returned to Roesia on condition that the men enfeoffed there by Lacy remained undisturbed. In 1237 Lacy opposed the piratical attacks of the Mariscos in the Irish Sea and arrested Scottish merchants then in Ulster. His rehabilitation into royal favour was shown by two summonses he received to give counsel to the king in 1234 and 1237.<br>
<br>Hugh de Lacy died shortly before 26 December 1242 in Ulster. It is possible but not certain that he was buried at the Franciscan house in Carrickfergus, which he may have founded. He certainly founded the Franciscan house at Down in 1240. He had no surviving sons and his lands reverted to the crown. He married twice. With his first wife, Lesceline de Verdon, he had at least two sons and at least three daughters. His sons Walter and Roger were alive in 1226, but both predeceased him. One of them, or possibly another son, was killed fighting Mac Lochlainn in 1238. Of the daughters of Lacy and Lesceline one, Matilda, married David, baron of Naas, and brought as her marriage portion Lesceline's lands around Carlingford as well as Lacy's lands in Meath and Limerick. She died at a great age in 1281. Another daughter married Miles de Nangle and on her death in 1253 was buried at Boyle Abbey. A third daughter, Rose, married Alan of Galloway and was still alive in 1237. Lacy's second wife was Emeline, daughter of Walter of Ridelisford, with whom he had no children. Shortly after Lacy's death she married Stephen Longesp&eacute;e, a kinsman of Henry III, bringing with her as dower Lacy's Connacht manor of Meelick.<br>
