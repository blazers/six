<span class="headword">Burnett, Dame  (Annie) Maud</span>  (1863&#150;1950), <span class="occ">local politician</span>, was born at 10 Prior's Terrace, Tynemouth, Northumberland, on 27 February 1863, the second daughter in the family of two daughters and two sons of Jacob Burnett (1825&#150;1896), and his first wife, Annie Daglish (1830&#150;1866); there were a further daughter and son from his second marriage. Her father, the last of the Tyneside alkali manufacturers and a shipowner, was also a patron of the arts and a collector of pre-Raphaelite paintings, who had moved to Tynemouth by 1861. Maud was educated first at Miss Baker's school and then at Miss Hoald's school, both in Tynemouth, and completed her education at Vevey, Switzerland. She honed her public skills with work at the church of the Holy Saviour, Tynemouth, a <span class="roman">Bible</span> class in North Shields, and voluntary welfare work of various kinds. Though said to espouse no particular party she followed her family's political sympathies and was honorary secretary of the Tynemouth Women's Liberal Federation from 1895 to 1910, assisting at three parliamentary general elections.<br>
<br>When in 1902 it became necessary for there to be two women on municipal education committees Maud Burnett was co-opted onto that for Tynemouth. In 1907 she founded a branch, at Tynemouth, of the Women's Local Government Society (WLGS) and in 1909 she stood unsuccessfully as an independent candidate for election to Tynemouth council. She was returned in the following year, with Liberal support, for the Dockray ward, becoming the first woman in the north of England to become a municipal councillor, following the passage in 1907 of the WLGS's bill allowing women ratepayers to be elected. She was immediately placed on the committees for health, finance, smallholdings and allotments, public libraries, education, local pensions, and distress. In 1915 she was made deputy chairman of the committee for the care of the mentally defective. She also concerned herself with the provision of welfare for mothers and babies (including play centres) and with the issue of women's employment. Described as a &#145;charming suffragette&#146;  (<span class="italic">Tyneside Weekly News</span>, 1 Jan 1909) she supported the non-militant campaign for women's parliamentary suffrage.<br>
<br>During the First World War Maud Burnett was president of the War Savings Association in Tynemouth and chairman of committees concerned with war aims, food control, and food economy. She served on the YMCA committee on comforts for the forces, and on the naval and military war pensions committee. For her war work she was created DBE in 1918. She was appointed a JP on 28 August 1920 and retired from Tynemouth council in 1921 to resume voluntary work within the town. She was re-elected to the council in 1926, and served as mayor of Tynemouth in 1928&#150;9 and 1929&#150;30, being the first woman to hold that office. She finally retired from the council in 1934. Comparing her municipal record with the rest of Tyneside there were women councillors at Newcastle upon Tyne by 1919 and in Gateshead by 1920, the latter being in 1929 the first Tyneside municipality to raise a woman to the aldermanic bench.<br>
<br>Indomitable in old age, Dame Maud Burnett ruled the women's organizations of Tynemouth village with a rod of iron. In her seventies, when she lost her eyesight, she learned Braille and took up blind welfare. She died at her home, Collingwood House, Collingwood Terrace, Tynemouth, on 17 November 1950 and was buried at Preston cemetery, North Shields, on 21 November.<br>
