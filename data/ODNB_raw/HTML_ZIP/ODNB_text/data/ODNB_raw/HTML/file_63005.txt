<span class="headword">Maddocks <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Thomas]</span>,  Ann</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>y Ferch o Gefn Ydfa]</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1704, <em>d.</em> 1727), <span class="occ">tragic heroine</span>, is believed by many to have been the subject of one of the great star-crossed romances of modern Wales. She was probably born at her father's house, Cefn Ydfa, near Llangynwyd, Glamorgan, and was baptized on 8 May 1704. Her parents were the lawyer William Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1706) and his wife, Catherine, of Tyn-ton, Llangeinor, Glamorgan, who was the sister of Rees Price, the father of the philosopher Richard Price.<br>
<br>According to popular tradition centred on Llangynwyd and the surrounding region, William Thomas, who died in December 1706, had placed his heir, Ann, in the wardship of Anthony Maddocks, a lawyer of Cwm Rhisga, who eventually compelled her, against her wish, to marry his own son Anthony (<i>d</i>. 1764). Although there is no reference to this wardship in William Thomas's will, Ann and Anthony junior, who was also a lawyer by profession, did marry on 4 May 1725 and their detailed marriage contract is extant. There is some evidence to suggest that the marriage was not an entirely happy one. Ann died in Llangynwyd in 1727 and was buried in the church there on 16 June, barely two years after her marriage. Her daughter, Catherine, the only child of that marriage, died some three weeks previously and was buried on 28 May 1727.<br>
<br>Around these facts a poignant romantic story has been woven. It is claimed that Ann was deeply in love with Wil Hopcyn (1700&#150;1741), a poet from Llangynwyd to whom various Welsh verses are attributed by popular tradition, including &#145;Bugeilio'r gwenith gwyn&#146; (&#145;Watching the white wheat&#146;), which, it is believed, he had composed for her.<br>
<br>The story of the Maid of Cefn Ydfa, embroidered with a plethora of sentimental details and associated in particular with the song &#145;Bugeilio'r gwenith gwyn&#146;, became very popular in Wales during the second half of the nineteenth century. It was discussed in detail by G. J. Williams, who cogently argued that, after it had been stripped of the accumulation of details that were manifestly the product of romantic fantasy and conjecture, its central core consisted of a few facts that Taliesin Williams 
    (Taliesin ab Iolo; 1787&#150;1847)
   claimed in April 1845 to have heard from the parish clerk of Llangynwyd thirty-two years previously, and that it was Taliesin who had initiated the process of conjectural elaboration others later ingeniously continued. Williams believed that it was Edward Williams 
    (Iolo Morganwg; 1747&#150;1826)
   who first maintained that Wil Hopcyn was the author of the verses and that it was his son, Taliesin, who, after finding the poem in his father's manuscripts, began connecting it with the traditional story. Although it may contain a core that is genuinely old, it seems likely that Iolo himself was the author of the poem in its final form. Taliesin passed the words to Maria Jane Williams (1795&#150;1873), who published them in her <span class="italic">Ancient National Airs of Gwent and Morganwg</span> (1844). Later, Mrs Mary Pendrill Llewelyn (1811&#150;1874), wife of the vicar of Llangynwyd, began to collect the Welsh verses associated by popular tradition with that area and to claim that some had been written by Wil Hopcyn and were connected with the Cefn Ydfa episode.<br>
<br>The story became the theme of various literary works in the second half of the nineteenth century and some mawkish elements, similar to those frequently found in such romantic tales, were soon added to it&#151;the heartless mother who forcibly confined her love-smitten daughter to her room; messages being carried to the maiden's lover by a servant; love letters, written with Ann's own blood on a sycamore leaf, being concealed in the hollow of a tree; the hapless maiden incessantly languishing and eventually dying of a broken heart. The story was also the theme of an opera composed by Joseph Parry in 1902, with an English libretto by Joseph Bennett.<br>
