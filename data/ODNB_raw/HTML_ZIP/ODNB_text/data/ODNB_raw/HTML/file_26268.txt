<span class="headword">Stanley,  Edward Smith</span>, thirteenth earl of Derby <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Lord Stanley]</span>  (1775&#150;1851), <span class="occ">politician and naturalist</span>, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47080/', "Edward Stanley, twelfth earl of Derby (1752&#150;1834)")</script>, and his first wife, Lady Elizabeth Hamilton (1753&#150;1797), only daughter of James, sixth duke of Hamilton, was born in London on 21 April 1775. His great-grandfather, Edward, eleventh earl of Derby, was descended from a brother of Thomas, second earl of Derby, and succeeded to the earldom on the extinction of the direct line in 1736. His grandfather, James, Lord Strange, took the additional name of Smith in accordance with the will of his wife's father, Hugh Smith (<i>d</i>. 1745) of Weald Hall, Essex.<br>
<br>Styled Lord Stanley until 1832, he was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated as a nobleman in 1793 and graduated MA in 1795. He married, on 30 June 1798, his cousin, Charlotte Margaret, second daughter of his aunt, the Hon. Lucy Stanley, by her marriage with the Revd Geoffrey Hornby. Charlotte died on 16 June 1817; they had three sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>In the general election of 1796 Stanley was returned as a whig member of parliament for one of the two Preston seats. For half a century a dispute had existed between the earls of Derby and the corporation of Preston as to the right to nominate the representatives of the borough. Between 1768 and 1795 both seats had been held by nominees of the Derby family. In the elections of 1796 Preston corporation determined to secure one of the two seats for the tories and nominated John Horrocks, of the Lancashire firm of Horrocks, Miller &amp; Co. Horrocks and Stanley stood as arch rivals in 1796, but by the election of 1802 an amicable arrangement had been made between the two men to share the seats, an arrangement which was subsequently maintained by Stanley and Horrocks's brother Samuel. In 1806 and 1807, although technically opposed in politics, Stanley and Samuel Horrocks shared a joint committee and a joint canvass, and were elected together. In spite of opposition by other candidates, this agreement lasted at least until 1826, when Stanley's son successfully contested the seat.<br>
<br>In 1812 Stanley ceased to sit for Preston and was elected one of the members for the county of Lancashire. He held that seat continuously until the passing of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> in 1832. Throughout his parliamentary career he was a firm and consistent supporter of the whig party without ever taking a prominent place in it; he spoke little in the House of Commons. In 1832 Lord Grey's ministry needed further strength in the House of Lords; Stanley was thus elevated to the peerage during his father's lifetime by using the title Baron Stanley of Bickerstaffe. Two years later, on the death of his father on 21 October 1834, Stanley succeeded to the earldom; on 17 April 1839 he was created a knight of the Garter.<br>
<br>Subsequently Derby played little part in political life, but became increasingly prominent in the world of natural history, especially as one of the figureheads of the science of zoological classification, particularly the taxonomy of birds. He was president of the Linnean Society of London from 1828 to 1834, and president of the Zoological Society of London for twenty years from 1831 until his death. He not only encouraged the reading of accounts of new species by chairing meetings of the two societies, but contributed many scientific papers himself to the proceedings of the Zoological Society and donated many specimens to its collections. He actively encouraged collectors in the field, such as Thomas Bridges in South America, Joseph Burke in South Africa and North America, John MacGillivray in Australia and Indonesia, and Thomas Whitfield in west Africa. With contributions from such individuals, and from other zoological contacts, he formed at Knowsley Hall, near Liverpool, a private and very extensive menagerie of birds and mammals. His record of keeping and breeding rare and later extinct species of bird is still regarded as extraordinary; he was the first to breed in captivity such species as the nene (or Hawaiian goose) and the passenger pigeon. He was probably the first person to breed the Australian budgerigar in captivity in Britain, hatching two chicks in his aviaries in February 1848. Fish and reptiles were also kept in the Knowsley collections; the first live African lungfish (<i>Protopterus</i> sp.) seen in Britain were brought there from the Gambia in 1843. They were placed in warm tanks within the plant-houses and successfully induced from their mud cocoons.<br>
<br>Derby also formed a fine museum from specimens purchased at auction or contributed by his collectors and contacts, and from animals from his menagerie as they died. One of the last, an Asian parrot, was an undescribed species which his assistant Louis Fraser named Lord Derby's parakeet, <i>Palaeornis derbyanus</i>, in 1850. Many other species are named after the thirteenth earl, such as the Stanley crane, <i>Anthropoides paradisea</i>; the white gallinule, <i>Porphyrio stanleyi</i>; Derby's puffbird, <i>Trochilus derbyi</i>; Lord Derby's eland, <i>Tragelaphus derbianus</i>; and the woolly opossum, <i>Caluromys derbianus</i>. In 1814 Henry Salt brought back from Abyssinia twelve new species of bird, which Derby named scientifically, calling one of them, a lovebird, <i>Psittacus taranta</i> Stanley. Many of the forms in his menagerie were painted by such famous artists as Josef Wolf and Edward Lear. Lear also composed many of his limericks for the Derby children.<br>
<br>The maintenance of the menagerie alone cost &pound;10,000&#150;&pound;15,000 per annum; it occupied 100 acres of land and 70 of water. Derby spent much of his own time caring for the occupants of the menagerie and wrote copious notes on day-to-day events. At his death the living collections included 345 mammals of 94 species (principally antelopes); of these, no fewer than 207 individuals of 39 species had been bred at Knowsley. His aviaries contained 1272 birds of 318 species (excluding poultry), of which he had bred 549 individuals of 45 species. Even more remarkable is the total figure of 619 bird species kept at Knowsley over the forty-five years the menagerie existed. After Derby's death some of the living animals were given to the Zoological Society in Regent's Park; the queen selected two black-necked swans and five rare Impeyan pheasants for her own gardens. The remainder were sold at auction in October 1851 but realized only &pound;7000.<br>
<br>The Knowsley Museum is estimated to have included 20,000 mammals, birds, and lower vertebrates; some invertebrates, such as specimens of molluscs, are known to have been donated to the British Museum before Derby's death. The vertebrate collections were bequeathed to the city of Liverpool, where they provided the foundation of what was first the Derby Museum, then the Liverpool Free Public Museum. In 1983 this institution became part of the newly created National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside, the bestowal of national status being in some measure due to the importance of Derby's collections. These include not only many forms now extinct or endangered, but also numerous specimens on which the original scientific descriptions of their species were based (types), and which are therefore of unique importance. Type specimens include those for many of the forms named after the thirteenth earl, as well as for species such as the brown kiwi from New Zealand, the possibly extinct paradise parrot from Australia, and the red-flanked duiker from west Africa; the specimens continue to be actively researched, particularly by bird taxonomists.<br>
<br>In later life Derby was lord lieutenant of Lancashire, and passed much of his time at Knowsley Hall. He died there on 30 June 1851, and was buried in the family vault at Ormskirk, Lancashire, on 8 July; the funeral procession was more than a mile in length. His eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26265/', "Edward George Geoffrey Smith Stanley")</script>, succeeded him in the title.<br>
