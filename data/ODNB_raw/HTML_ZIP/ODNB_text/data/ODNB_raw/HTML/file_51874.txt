<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fairlie,  Alison Anna Bowie</span>  (1917&#150;1993), <span class="occ">scholar of French literature</span>, was born on 23 May 1917 at the manse, Lerwick, Shetland, the eldest daughter of Robert Paul Fairlie, minister of the Church of Scotland, and his wife, Florence Annie Allan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wilson. She always maintained an intense feeling for her homeland. Scotland was where she spent most of every August, on holiday with her family, up to 1947, and thereafter she returned at every opportunity. She was educated at Ardrossan Academy, Dumfries Academy, and then, between the ages of twelve and seventeen, as a boarder at Penrhos College, Colwyn Bay. As an undergraduate at St Hugh's College, Oxford, she came into contact with the group of scholars who were then laying the foundations for Oxford's outstanding contribution to the development of French studies as a modern university discipline. She remembered with particular pleasure the lectures or tutorials given by Gustave Rudler, Will Moore, Enid Starkie, E. A. Francis, C&eacute;cile Hugon, Rhoda Sutherland, L. A. Bisson, and H. J. Hunt. At Oxford she also joined the Communist Party, at the same time as her exact contemporary Denis Healey and many others of their generation. She joined not because she had deeply studied Marxist doctrine, nor even because she had been persuaded by its principal tenets, but as a way of expressing her indignation and disgust at the rise of fascism in Europe. Her membership probably lapsed at the end of her undergraduate career, but throughout her later life her political views remained steadily of a sceptical left-wing kind.<br>
<br>After taking a first in medieval and modern languages in 1938, Fairlie began work on her DPhil thesis, supervised by Rudler. Initially her research was conducted in Paris, but on the outbreak of war she returned to Britain and undertook voluntary work in billeting and rationing offices. Early in 1940 she was advised by the central employment bureau for universities to complete her research. In accordance with this advice she returned to Paris with the Zaharoff research scholarship that she had been awarded in the summer of 1939, and continued research until the fall of France in June 1940. For Fairlie these were months of intensive and exhilarating scholarly enquiry, during which she accumulated the unruly mass of material on nineteenth-century intellectual history that was eventually published, in a pruned and methodized form, in <span class="italic">Leconte de Lisle's Poems on the Barbarian Races</span> (1947), the book form of her thesis, for which she was awarded a DPhil in 1943. What emerges from her own modestly worded accounts of this period is the single-mindedness of her devotion to scholarship&#151;part of her fully expected the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale to remain open in defiance of the German armies as they advanced on Paris&#151;and the good-humoured courage with which she faced physical danger. By the time she reached Bordeaux, and a cargo steamer prepared to convey her back to Britain, the local docks and shipping offshore were already under German bombardment.<br>
<br>The years 1940&#150;42 saw Fairlie back in Oxford, finishing her thesis. From September 1942 she served for two years as a temporary administrative officer with the Foreign Office, spending most of her time in naval section 6 at Bletchley Park. Her academic career began in the autumn of 1944, when she was appointed lecturer in French at Girton College, Cambridge. She was elected fellow and director of studies in modern languages in 1946, and university lecturer two years later. The arrival of Odette de Mourgues as a research fellow of Girton in 1948 marked the beginning of a long professional collaboration and a lifelong friendship between the two. In 1967 Fairlie became university reader, and in 1972 the first holder of a personal professorship in the Cambridge French department. Although she repeatedly refused offers of professorships at other universities, new and old, her outlook was in no way parochial. In 1968 and 1969 she was elected president of the Society for French Studies; in 1969 a member of the council of the Association Internationale des &Eacute;tudes Fran&ccedil;aises, becoming one of its vice-presidents in 1983; and in 1972 a member of the editorial board of <span class="italic">French Studies</span>. Her election to an honorary fellowship of St Hugh's in 1972 gave her particular pleasure. She was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1984, and became one of the founding honorary senior research fellows of the Institute of Romance Studies, University of London, in 1989.<br>
<br>Very soon after her arrival in Cambridge Fairlie's name became a byword in the university and outside for her abilities as a college teacher. She had an unusual and not entirely comfortable tutorial style. She considered that the function of the tutorial hour was for students to bring and explore their own ideas: <i>they</i> were expected to do the talking, with only occasional incisive comments from her. If they had not done enough work, or if their ideas dried up, she would ask a probing question and then simply wait and wait for the answer, the ash on her cigarette growing ever longer and sometimes finally dropping off on her clothes. The silence would grow until it became unbearable, and would at last be broken either by an admission of ignorance from the student or by a pointed remark from her to the effect that such and such &#145;needed further thought&#146;. Many Girtonians found this technique terrifying.<br>
<br>Fairlie's most remarkable achievement as a university teacher was the central part she played in relaunching modern languages as a serious intellectual discipline in British universities. Until then the subject had been something of a poor relation to history and classics, and had often had little ambition beyond the efficient inculcation of basic linguistic skills. Fairlie brought to the study of French a keen responsiveness to the grain and texture of literary language, and in her own critical writing skilfully exposed layers of implied meaning in works that others had been content to characterize simply as &#145;masterpieces&#146; or as &#145;typical of their time&#146;.<br>
<br>In her criticism Fairlie's manner was often one of questioning and speculation, but the questions she asked and the hypotheses she ventured invariably took their cue from the words on the author's page and, far from clothing the literary text in interpretative fantasies, sought to bring the reader back with clearer sight and a renewed power of enjoyment to its central riches. During a period when criticism of French literature suffered from severe factional narrowness and ill temper, she remained generously plural in her interests and approach. While attending closely to the formal and expressive properties of the individual literary work, she remained scrupulously aware that many things lying beyond that work&#151;manuscripts, variant readings or &#145;sources&#146;, the author's personal relationships or his letters&#151;could prompt the scholar to valuable new kinds of critical perception. Perhaps most important of all, the language she herself used was, in its attunement to the subjects discussed, its economy, and its discreet inventiveness, a lesson to all those critics who sought, by their luxuriant verbal displays, to outwit and outwrite their writers.<br>
<br>The close examination of Leconte de Lisle was an improbable training ground for a scholar who later contributed decisively to the study of Constant, Baudelaire, Flaubert, and Nerval. For although the poet in mid-career was still driven by strong sexual and political passions, he had the ambition of becoming the exemplary literary artist of his age and this involved him in an extensive programme of scholarly and semi-scholarly reading. Fairlie took her reader back from the serried verbal textures of Leconte de Lisle's poems to the bibliographical labyrinth in which they had been conceived. What was more impressive, however, than her willingness to document the poet's reading was her insistence upon historicizing his historical project. The historians of Leconte de Lisle's day, upon whose work he drew so trustingly, were often exceptionally unreliable. Their skewed and imprecise vision of the past was then subject to a variety of further distortions, conscious and unconscious, as the poetic imagination played upon it and turned it into verse. Fairlie proved adept at detecting and teasing out the disparate source materials that lay behind Leconte de Lisle's orotund periods. Her readings of the <span class="italic">Po&egrave;mes barbares</span> were a series of elaborate radiographic portraits, and the book as a whole offered a working model of the acquisitive and integrative literary imagination at work.<br>
<br>This quality of Fairlie's book prepared her extremely well for her later researches. Although she never again devoted such intensive scrutiny to any single body of textual sources, her later work was born of the same fascination with literary texts as complex semantic fields. Constant, Baudelaire, Flaubert, and even Nerval, who was extremely erudite in his own fashion, did not call for the same sort of detective work as had Leconte de Lisle. But in Fairlie's view all four writers did demand to be discussed in terms of the co-present and interactive ideas, images, and verbal motifs that their works contained. Her skill in anatomizing such canonical texts as Constant's <span class="italic">Adolphe</span>, Baudelaire's <span class="italic">Les fleurs du mal</span>, or Flaubert's <span class="italic">Madame Bovary</span>, and her ability to preserve, while doing so, an overall sense of their drama, made her essays and monographs into standard works.<br>
<br>Fairlie's &#145;retirement&#146; was energetic: during it she was a member of the editorial team responsible for the new <span class="italic">&#338;uvres compl&egrave;tes</span> of Benjamin Constant and always available to help and encourage an innumerable company of friends, colleagues, and fellow scholars from around the world. Her appetite for experience persisted even after she had been diagnosed as having inoperable lung cancer. Equally persistent, however, was the wish to share her experience with others, and it was this that made her into a compelling literary critic, an inspiring teacher, and an irreplaceable friend. She died at Papworth Hospital near Cambridge on 21 February 1993; her body was cremated at Cambridge. She was unmarried.<br>
