<span class="headword">Thomas,  William</span>  (1670&#150;1738), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and antiquary</span>, was born in Worcester, the only son of John Thomas and Mary, daughter of William Bagnall of Sidbury, Worcestershire. He was educated at Westminster School from 1685 and at Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1688; he graduated BA (1692) and proceeded MA (1695), BD (1723), and DD (1729). A skilful classicist and Anglo-Saxonist, he became fluent in French and Italian on his tour to France and Italy in 1700. Shortly after his return to England he was ordained in the Church of England, and through the influence of Lord Somers, a distant relative, he was presented to the rectory of Exhall, Warwickshire. Queen Anne was well disposed towards him, for his grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27244/', "William Thomas (1613&#150;1689)")</script>, bishop of Worcester, had been her preceptor, but Thomas declined all court preferment.<br>
<br>Thomas married Elizabeth, daughter of George Carter of Brill, Buckinghamshire, from whom he gained &#145;a considerable fortune&#146;  (Nash, clxiii), part of which was a large estate at Atherstone upon Stour, in Warwickshire. He previously had acquired from his uncle William Thomas an estate at Teddington, in Gloucestershire. He and his wife had nine daughters and five sons, and in 1721 the family moved to Worcester for their education. In 1723 he was appointed rector of St Nicholas, in Worcester, through the influence of the bishop, John Hough, to whom he dedicated his published works.<br>
<br>Thomas published three valuable works on the history and antiquities of Worcestershire and Warwickshire. The first was an account of Malvern's antiquities, published in 1725 under the title <span class="italic">Antiquitates prioratus majoris Malverne in agro Wicciensi</span>. Thomas made considerable use of Thomas Habington's collections and supplemented them with his own transcripts from episcopal, parish, and corporation records, with the intention of publishing a history of Worcestershire. To this end he &#145;hardly allowed himself time for sleep, meals, or amusement&#146;  (Chambers, 338) but the work remained incomplete at his death. In 1730 he produced a fine edition of Sir William Dugdale's <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Warwickshire</span>, originally published in 1656, which boasted much new material from his own archival research and excellent maps by Henry Beighton. He next published <span class="italic">A survey of the cathedral-church of Worcester, with an account of the bishops thereof &hellip; to 1660</span> (1736).<br>
<br>Thomas died in Worcester on 26 July 1738 and was buried in the cathedral cloisters, close to his grandfather's tomb. Most of his children predeceased him; only one son, George (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1746), survived him and only his daughter Elizabeth, who married George Wingfield of Lipard, near Worcester, was alive in 1782, when Treadway Nash wrote his memoir of Thomas. Thomas's Worcestershire collections were purchased by Charles Lyttelton, who had encouraged him in his history and left the papers to the Society of Antiquaries, where they were used by Nash.<br>
