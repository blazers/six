<span class="headword">Maule, Sir  William Henry</span>  (1788&#150;1858), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 25 April 1788 at Edmonton, Middlesex, the son of Henry Maule, a medical practitioner, and his wife, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rawson, a Quaker from Leeds. Maule was educated at a private school run by his uncle, John Maule, rector of Greenford, Middlesex, who was described by Charles Greville, a fellow pupil at the school, as &#145;an excellent scholar and a great brute&#146;  (C. Greville, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 1885, 2.101). Greville described Maule himself as &#145;a very clever boy&#146;. In October 1806 Maule matriculated from Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was senior wrangler in the mathematical tripos of 1810 and also won the first Smith's prize. In October 1811 he was elected a fellow of Trinity. After taking his MA degree he stayed in Cambridge for some time, working as a mathematical coach. Among his pupils was Edward Ryan, afterwards chief justice of Calcutta, who remained a lifelong close friend. Another of his Cambridge friends was Charles Babbage, the mathematician.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1810 Maule became a student at Lincoln's Inn. While still a student there he was offered, but declined, the professorship of mathematics at East India College, Haileybury. In 1814 he was called to the bar, took chambers at 3 Essex Court, Temple, and joined the Oxford circuit. His progress at the bar was slow at first, but he gradually obtained a reputation and business as a commercial lawyer, becoming an authority on marine insurance. He became king's counsel in Easter term 1833 and in 1835 was appointed counsel to the Bank of England in succession to Sir James Scarlett, who had been appointed chief baron. Not only did this position earn him a good deal of money but it also enabled him to act as leading counsel for the sitting member in the county Carlow election petition. His success in the case led to his being returned for Carlow borough as a Liberal MP at the general election in August 1837.<br>
<br>In March 1839 Maule was appointed a baron of the exchequer in succession to Baron Bolland and was knighted. In Michaelmas term 1839 he was transferred to the common pleas on the death of Mr Justice Vaughan. He continued a member of that court until June 1855, when he resigned because of ill health. Shortly after his resignation, Maule was sworn of the privy council, and acted as a member of the judicial committee until his death.<br>
<br>Maule was considered by his colleagues to be an excellent judge who combined common sense with legal knowledge, and was affectionately remembered for his humorous irony. At the Warwick assizes, for instance, while sentencing to one day's imprisonment a poor man convicted of bigamy, whose first wife had deserted him and lived with another man, Maule outlined at length to the bemused prisoner the various legal steps which he must take in order to obtain a divorce at the cost of about &pound;1000.<br>
<br>Maule died unmarried on 16 January 1858 at the home he shared with his widowed sister, Emma Maria Leathley, and his unmarried niece, Emma Leathley, at 22 Hyde Park Gardens, London.<br>
