<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ramsden,  Harry</span>  (1888&#150;1963), <span class="occ">fish and chip restaurateur</span>, was born on 10 February 1888 at 64 Chatham Street, Bradford, the sixth child of seven born to Henry Ramsden and his wife, Emily Gledhill, formerly Holroyd. His father was then a police constable, but later became a stage-door manager, publican, and fish frier. Shortly after Harry's birth his father was running a fish and chip shop at 22 Manchester Road, Bradford, a main thoroughfare in a working-class district. At this time the fish and chip trade was developing rapidly from its small and often disreputable origins in the 1870s and becoming an important provider of main meals as well as late-night snacks for working-class families in London and the northern industrial towns. It was a labour-intensive, invariably family-run business, using coal-fired ranges and ingredients prepared by hand, and it recruited mainly from skilled workers and their families, with limited capital saved or borrowed from relatives and friends. Children were usually pressed into service, but Ramsden took evasive action, working half-time in a mill in the mornings and as a lather boy in a barber's shop after school. In his late teens he borrowed heavily, and successfully, to set up a small taxi business, and at twenty-one he leased the Craven Heifer in Bolton Road, reputed to be a publican's graveyard, and made it pay by introducing (unlicensed) piano music. Then war service intervened.<br>
<br>It was after the First World War that Harry Ramsden followed his father into the fish and chip trade, combining it with theatrical lodgings. The latter were managed by his first wife, Bridget (<i>b</i>. 1888/9), daughter of James Murphy, a farmer; they had married on 13 June 1911. He subsequently traded up from small beginnings and opened the Cosy Caf&eacute; in Westgate, which his lodgers promoted by introducing it into their stage patter. In 1928 he moved to White Cross, Guiseley, at the edge of the Leeds&#150;Bradford conurbation, in search of cleaner air for his wife and son. The former died within a few months; but the move was to make Ramsden famous. In 1931, in the depths of the depression, he opened a full-scale restaurant at White Cross, with chandeliers, wall lighting, leaded lights in the windows, piano music, and a conspicuous clock. This was not the first attempt to propel fish and chips up market: there had been several since the turn of the century, in Leeds as well as London, Manchester, and indeed Reading. In 1917 a restaurant in Wigan had given tripe the same treatment. But Harry Ramsden's became a famous success. It was solidly based in the established lunch-time take-away trade of the surrounding factories; but the restaurant soon became a destination for evenings out, and also captured the returning weekend motor traffic from the Lake District and Yorkshire dales. Above all, it was stimulated by Ramsden's obsessive attention to detail and eye for improvement, and his flair for populist advertising. He created and propagated his own myth, and was sometimes referred to as &#145;the uncrowned king of fish and chips&#146;. Through his nephew the television puppeteer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69051/', "Harry Corbett")</script> he made contact with a world of Blackpool showmanship with which he had much in common.<br>
<br>Ramsden took pride in dressing well but without pretension. But his own roots remained resolutely local, and after he handed over management of the restaurant to Eddie Stokes in 1954 he set up two more fish and chip restaurants, before terminal illness set in. It is in many ways ironical that his name should be attached to the Harry Ramsden restaurant chain which spread its wings internationally in the 1990s, because he himself exemplified the local entrepreneur who knew his market well enough to respect his customers, in a trade where such local knowledge was at a premium. His career belongs to a tradition of extrovert populist showmanship which also flourished in the music-hall, and his personal success was a product of that era.<br>
<br>Harry Ramsden died from cancer on 7 January 1963 at the hospital, Middleton, Wharfedale, Yorkshire. He was survived by his second wife, I. M. Ramsden.<br>
