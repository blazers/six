<span class="headword">Mayo,  Charles</span>  (1767&#150;1858), <span class="occ">Old English scholar</span>, born in London on 24 March 1767, was the younger son of <a name="cosubject_18457"></a><span class="headword">Herbert Mayo</span>  (1720&#150;1802), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, and his wife, Mary (1732/3&#150;1824), daughter of George Coldham, surgeon-extraordinary to the prince of Wales. Herbert Mayo was the son of Charles Mayo of Hereford; he matriculated in April 1739 at Brasenose College, Oxford, and was elected fellow in 1740 (BA, 1742; MA, 1745; DD, 1763). After curacies in the east of London he was presented in 1764 to the living of Middleton Cheney, Northamptonshire, but left the same year to return to the East End of London as rector of St George-in-the-East, Stepney. He married Mary Coldham on 15 January 1765, and served as JP for Middlesex and treasurer of Raine's Hospital. Herbert Mayo was an exemplary parish priest, and cared for the poor and took an interest in the welfare of black people. He died in London on 5 January 1802, and was buried in the churchyard of St George-in-the-East on 13 January.<br>
<br>Charles Mayo was admitted to Merchant Taylors' School in 1776, and was elected to St John's College, Oxford, in June 1785, becoming a fellow in 1788. He graduated MA in 1793 and BD in 1796. In 1795 he was elected by the university as professor of Old English (a chair founded by Dr Rawlinson); he was the first to hold that office, which he occupied for the allotted period of five years. According to Dr Samuel Parr his lectures were well received. Mayo was ordained in 1791 and was Whitehall preacher in 1799&#150;1800. On 2 June 1801 he married Louisa (1774&#150;1852), the youngest daughter of James Landon; they had no children. Mayo also served as morning lecturer at the old chapel of St Michael, Highgate, from 1803 to 1833. He was elected FSA in 1820, FRS in 1827, and a governor of Sir Roger Cholmeley's School in Highgate in 1842. He was proud to be an examiner of his old school, Merchant Taylors'. He lived for most of his life at Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, where in 1824 he inherited the manor of Andrewes and Le Motte from his grandmother Rebecca, daughter of Sir John Shaw, baronet. Charles Mayo died on 10 December 1858 at Cheshunt, where he was buried.<br>
<br>Charles's elder brother, <a name="cosubject_18460"></a><span class="headword">Paggen William Mayo</span>  (1766&#150;1836), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 11 January 1766, and was baptized on 7 February at St George-in-the-East, Stepney, his father's parish. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School and St John's College, Oxford, and was elected to a medical fellowship at St John's on 6 July 1792; he graduated DM in 1795. Having been elected physician to the Middlesex Hospital on 23 August 1793, he was admitted FRCP on 30 September 1796, and was censor in 1797, Goulstonian lecturer in 1798, and Harveian orator in 1807. He resigned his hospital appointment in 1801, and moved from Conduit Street, Hanover Square, London, to Doncaster, and eventually to Bridlington. He married on 8 February 1798 Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1828), daughter of the Revd Stephen Buckle LLD of Norwich. They had six children. Paggen William Mayo died at Bridlington on 6 July 1836, and was buried in the churchyard there.<br>
