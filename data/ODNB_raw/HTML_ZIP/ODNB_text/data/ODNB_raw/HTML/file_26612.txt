<span class="headword">Stowe,  William Henry</span>  (1825&#150;1855), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, eldest son of William Stowe, surgeon at Buckingham, and his wife, Mary, was born at Buckingham on 1 January 1825. After attending a school at Iffley, near Oxford, he spent six months at King Edward's School, Birmingham, which he left at Easter 1840. He studied medicine for three years at Buckingham, but, finding this uncongenial, entered Wadham College, Oxford, in January 1844, and was Hody (Greek) exhibitioner from 1845 to 1850. His health had previously been considered delicate, so he began his studies at a significant disadvantage.<br>
<br>At Oxford, Stowe was intimately associated with G. G. Bradley (afterwards dean of Westminster), John Conington, and others of the Rugby School set. In 1848 he was placed in the first class in <i>literae humaniores</i> with Edward Parry (afterwards bishop-suffragan of Dover) and William Stubbs (afterwards bishop of Oxford); he graduated BA in 1848 and MA in 1853. After two years as a private tutor at Oxford, he began in 1851 a connection with <span class="italic">The Times</span> by contributing literary articles, among them a comparison of the characteristics of Thackeray and Dickens. In March 1852 he obtained an open fellowship at Oriel College, and the following month was admitted as a student at Lincoln's Inn.<br>
<br>In May 1852 John Walter, the proprietor, gave Stowe a permanent post on <span class="italic">The Times</span>. His work for the paper was mainly on literary subjects, though he wrote many leading articles on miscellaneous topics. His reviews of Kaye's <span class="italic">Afghanistan</span> and of <span class="italic">David Copperfield</span> were reprinted in <span class="italic">Essays from The Times</span> (2nd ser., 1854). Defying popular enthusiasm, Stowe with &#145;academic fastidiousness&#146; gave <span class="italic">Uncle Tom's Cabin</span> its first unfavourable review in an English paper. His obituary article on Lord Brougham appeared in <span class="italic">The Times</span> of 11 May 1868, thirteen years after Stowe's own death.<br>
<br>In 1855 <span class="italic">The Times</span> organized a &#145;sick and wounded fund&#146;, which reached &pound;25,000, for the relief of the British army in the Crimea, and Stowe was selected, probably by Walter, to go to the scene as the fund's almoner. He reached Constantinople before the end of February and was instructed in his duties by Thomas Chenery. He was soon at Scutari, whence he moved to Balaklava. There he visited the hospitals and camp, reported on the defects of the sanitary situation, and distributed supplies provided by the <span class="italic">Times</span> fund. As a <span class="italic">Times</span> representative he was regarded by some as a &#145;dangerous person&#146;, but welcomed by others. Frances Taylor, a &#145;lady volunteer&#146; nurse, in her <span class="italic">Eastern Hospitals and English Nurses</span> (1857) wrote that while others talked, Mr Stowe acted; she praised his concern, thoroughness, insight into the hospitals' needs, and &#145;kind and friendly manner&#146;  (Taylor, 92).<br>
<br>On 16 March, Stowe's first letter from the Crimea appeared in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and described the Balaklava hospitals and the health of the army. Many further dispatches on like subjects followed. In the temporary absences of William Howard Russell, Stowe also reported military operations: two of his letters (nos. 80 and 81) described the third bombardment of Sevastopol and were included in Russell's <span class="italic">The War</span> (1855). Stowe was deserted by his servant, and, unable to resist the fatigue and unhealthy climate, he fell ill. Although as <span class="italic">Times</span> fund almoner he had much assisted the military hospitals, as a civilian he was refused admission. He was carried down to the church at Balaklava used to accommodate the sick, and there he died of &#145;camp fever&#146; (presumably cholera or typhus) on 22 June 1855, at the age of thirty. He was buried in the British cemetery at Balaklava, and in 1857 a memorial was placed in Oriel chapel. In a leading article in <span class="italic">The Times</span> of 6 July 1855, John Walter described Stowe's experiences in the Crimea, and praised his dispatches as &#145;an astonishing effort of intellectual and descriptive talent&#146;.<br>
