<span class="headword">Fuller family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1650&#150;1803), <span class="occ">gun-founders and landowners</span>, came to prominence with John [i] Fuller (1617&#150;1679), the son of Samuel Fuller, of Waldron, Sussex, and his wife, Joan, daughter of Stephen French, of Chiddingly, Sussex. He married Ann, the daughter of John Nutt, of Selmeston, Sussex. In 1650, together with Sir Thomas Dyke, he obtained from his maternal grandfather the lease of Stream iron furnace, Chiddingly, where ordnance was cast in the 1660s. He was succeeded by his second son, John [ii] Fuller (1652&#150;1722), a major in the trained bands, who continued to work the furnace at Stream until 1693, when he leased land at Heathfield, Sussex, on which he built a new furnace in the same year.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_42073"></a><span class="headword">John [iii] Fuller</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1680, <em>d.</em> 1745), <span class="occ">ironmaster and gun-founder</span>, was the eldest son of John [ii] Fuller, of Tanners, Waldron, Sussex, and his wife, Elizabeth, the daughter of Samuel Fowle of London. He was baptized at Waldron on 28 July 1680. On 20 July 1703 he married Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1681, <i>d</i>. 1728), daughter of Fulke Rose, of Jamaica, and his wife, Elizabeth, who later married Hans Sloane. The marriage settlement brought a large fortune from sugar plantations in St Katherine's and St John's parishes in Jamaica, the income from which formed an increasingly significant element in the family's wealth. In 1705 he took possession of Brightling Park, which he renamed Rose Hill, in honour of his wife. During the ensuing years a substantial amount of property in the Brightling and Burwash areas was purchased. It is likely that he took control of the family's furnace at Heathfield as early as 1703, when the first furnace account book was begun, and thereafter the accounts (at East Sussex Record Office) form a number of series. In 1713 he was elected MP for Sussex, but did not stand for re-election when parliament was dissolved in 1715. In 1716 he purchased Burwash forge from William Western, having worked it since 1700. During the peace of the 1720s and 1730s Fuller kept Heathfield furnace at work supplying Sussex forges with pig iron, returning to large scale ordnance production at the onset of war in 1739. Fuller favoured a protectionist policy in respect of the importation of iron, seeing the reinvigoration of the English, and not least the wealden, iron industry as a means of providing employment as well as improving the quality of iron produced. In 1734 he unsuccessfully contested one of the Sussex parliamentary seats, espousing the tory anti-excise cause. Fuller died on 4 August 1745 at Rose Hill, Brightling, and was buried on 10 August at Waldron.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_42074"></a><span class="headword">John [iv] <span class="st"> [Jacky]</span> Fuller</span>  (1706&#150;1755), <span class="occ">ironmaster and gun-founder</span>, was the eldest of the ten children of John [iii] Fuller and his wife, Elizabeth. He was born on 1 February 1706. In 1723 he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, and in 1724 was admitted to the Middle Temple. He was elected FRS in 1726. On the death of his father in 1745 he took over the estate and its ironworks in a period of great demand for ordnance. The late settlement of accounts by the Board of Ordnance, the main purchaser of the family's guns, caused Fuller much concern. The reputation of Fuller guns was such, however, that a number of orders were received from foreign states. In August 1746, at Croydon, Surrey, he married Elizabeth, daughter of Francis Dayrell, of Shudy Camps, Cambridge. There were no children from the marriage. In the same year he was appointed a justice of the peace. In 1750 he dispensed with the services of the family's Ordnance agent of more than twenty years, Samuel Remnant, concerned that he was not receiving a fair distribution of contracts compared with the other gun-founders that Remnant represented. In December 1754 Fuller was elected as MP for the duke of Newcastle's constituency at Boroughbridge, Yorkshire. He died on 5 February 1755 at Rose Hill, and was buried on 12 February at Waldron.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_42077"></a><span class="headword">Rose Fuller</span>  (1708&#150;1777), <span class="occ">politician, gun-founder, and landowner</span>, the second son of John [iii] Fuller, was born on 12 April 1708. He studied medicine at Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1725 to 1728, and from 1729 to 1732 at the University of Leiden. He graduated MD from Cambridge in 1732. He was elected FRS in 1732. In 1733 he was sent by his father to Jamaica, to supervise the family's sugar estates. In April 1737 he married Ithamar (<i>c</i>.1720&#150;1738), daughter of the Hon. Richard Mill, of St Katherine's, Jamaica, and in the same year was appointed to the Jamaica council. The island's council and assembly contained strong factions for and against the governor; Fuller joined the opposition. The couple had one son, who was stillborn. Ithamar Fuller died on 22 April 1738, but the marriage had brought Rose Fuller financial security. In 1740 he was dismissed from the council by Governor Trelawny, and was elected to the Jamaica assembly. He now led the faction against Governor Trelawny and, having returned to England in 1748, used his family's friendship with the duke of Newcastle to gain support against Trelawny, with whom, however, he was reconciled in 1751. Fuller was appointed chief justice by the new governor, Admiral Knowles, in 1753, but he was soon in opposition to him over the latter's plan to move the island's capital to Kingston. He resigned as chief justice over the dismissal of a fellow judge but in 1755 returned to England on inheriting the Sussex estates. In the following year he was elected MP for New Romney, and in 1761 for Maidstone. That year he was appointed a justice of the peace. Fuller, unlike his father, had whig sympathies, and supported the duke of Newcastle's faction. In parliament he was an important spokesman for Jamaica, and spoke frequently on American affairs. In 1765 the decrease in the price offered for guns by the Board of Ordnance, occasioned by the Carron Company's low tender for orders, caused Fuller to withdraw from the manufacture of guns for the government. In the next decade, when Carron guns repeatedly failed the Ordnance board proofs (or tests of quality), Fuller and his brother Stephen tried again to tender for business but met with only limited success; within ten years, however, increased income from the Jamaica estates had almost compensated for the financial loss. As in their father's time Heathfield furnace returned to serving the needs of a diminishing number of local forges. In 1768 Rose Fuller was elected MP for Rye, the seat he held until his death on 7 May 1777, at Gerrard Street, London. At his death his landed estate amounted to 5584 acres. He was buried at Waldron on 15 May.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_42075"></a><span class="headword">Stephen Fuller</span>  (1716&#150;1799), <span class="occ">merchant and agent for the Jamaica assembly</span>, John [iii] Fuller's seventh son, was born on 26 November 1716. He was educated at Tonbridge School and, from 1734, at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was a scholar, and elected fellow in 1741. On 8 July 1744 he married Elizabeth (Betsy), daughter of Laurence Noakes of Brightling. The couple had five daughters. On the death of his eldest brother, John [iv], he took charge of the Sussex estates and ironworks in the interim before his brother Rose returned from Jamaica. He continued to have a management role in both thereafter, and lived at Brightling. He was appointed justice of the peace in 1761. From 1764 until his death he was English agent for the Jamaica assembly and with his brother did much to further the Jamaica interest, being the author of several pamphlets, notably on slavery. He died on 8 September 1799 at South Stoneham, Hampshire. His wife predeceased him; she was buried on 9 March 1753. The Fuller estate was inherited, on the death of Rose Fuller, by his nephew, John [v] Fuller (1757&#150;1834)&#151;known as Honest John or Mad Jack Fuller&#151;who maintained Heathfield furnace in operation, supplying local forges with pig iron, until 1787. The forge at Burwash closed in 1803.<br>
<br>In the diversity of their interests the Fullers were not typical of their wealden contemporaries. Long-term investment in agriculture was the basis of their wealth, and their Jamaica estates eventually made large profits; in their political activities, with the exception of Rose Fuller, they were largely unambitious; and in the manufacture of iron they were not numbered among the innovators of their age. Where their significance lies is in the wealth of letters and accounts which have survived and the light which they shed, not only on the family's interests, but on the provincial, colonial, political, and commercial life of the time.<br>
