<span class="headword">Spottiswoode <span class="st"> [Spottiswood]</span>,  John</span>  (1509/10&#150;1585), <span class="occ">Scottish reformer and superintendent of Lothian</span>, has been identified as the second son of William Spottiswoode of that ilk in Berwickshire, who was killed at Flodden in 1513, and Elizabeth Pringle (<i>d</i>. 1514/15), daughter of Henry Pringle of Hoppringle or Torsonce in Lothian. Spottiswoode was orphaned when four years old; &#145;his friends put him to school in Glasgow&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of the Church</span>, 2.336), where he entered the university in 1534, as &#145;schir&#146; John Spottiswoode (denoting clerical status), and graduated MA. Acting as the rector's servant in 1534, he was licensed in 1536 as a student of Alexander Logan and later reappeared as the rector's deputy in 1543. His intention was to proceed to study divinity, but he was discouraged by the persecution of heretics at home and so left Scotland in favour of England where he was befriended by Archbishop Cranmer, who brought him to &#145;knowledge of the truth&#146;  (ibid.). He returned to Scotland after James V's death in 1542, with released Scottish nobles captured at Solway Moss, and &#145;stayed a long time&#146; with the fourth earl of Glencairn, an early protestant sympathizer and friend of England. Glencairn introduced him to the fourth earl of Lennox, employed by Henry VIII to foster support for England among the Scots. When Lennox took to arms in the west at Henry's bidding, in an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the government, Spottiswoode was present at Dumbarton Castle as servitor to the earl's brother, Robert Stewart, bishop elect of Caithness, who became another exile in England and temporarily lost his bishopric.<br>
<br>Spottiswoode remained with Lennox for some months in England (where Lennox was exiled for his unpatriotic activities) and served as a bearer of Lennox's communications with Henry VIII. On obtaining a pardon enabling him to return home, he was already known to James Sandilands of Calder, himself a supporter of the reformer George Wishart and &#145;assured&#146; to the English cause. Accepting Sandilands's offer of the parsonage of Calder in 1548, a living with an annual income at the Reformation valued at &pound;185, he lived sometimes with Sandilands, who was preceptor of Torphicen (a hospital of St John of Jerusalem), and sometimes with Lord James Stewart, Queen Mary's half-brother and commendator of St Andrews Priory. In September 1550 Spottiswoode and Sandilands received a licence from the crown to visit France. Spottiswoode went in the entourage of Mary of Guise, the queen mother, whose party also included Lord James, and was in France again in April 1558 when the young Queen Mary was married to the dauphin. At Paris, along with Robert Colville of Cleish, he signed a contract on 14 May 1558 with the Parisian master printer Jean Cavalier, who promised, on gaining approval from the Paris faculty of theology, to deliver to them 200 copies of Patrick Cockburn's <span class="italic">De vulgari sacrae scripturae phrasi</span> (1552).<br>
<br>With the outbreak of the Reformation, Spottiswoode took up residence at Calder, where he served as minister in the reformed church. By then he had been moving in reforming and Anglophile circles for a generation, and a Roman Catholic controversialist depicted him as &#145;profundlie learnit in the misteriis of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of John Knox</span>, 6.167). He was certainly well equipped to offer his ideas on reform by contributing to the <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span> and the confession of faith, as he was invited to do in 1560. On 9 March 1561 he was admitted by John Knox, who himself declined the office, as superintendent of Lothian, though he retained his parish ministry at Calder. This led his parishioners to complain to the general assembly in 1562 and again in 1563 that they were deprived of his services for much of the year on account of his duties as superintendent which they wished him to demit; the assembly refused their plea.<br>
<br>In a circular letter written from Edinburgh on 22 March 1561, Spottiswoode showed that he regarded his commission as superintendent to be valid and effective: first, because he possessed the approval and support of the churches in his province; second, because he was so charged by the nobility; and third, because as a consequence of this authorization so to act he had received from the privy council endorsement and added authority for effecting a visitation of his province. Even so he may have felt himself somewhat disadvantaged by Knox, who occupied the pulpit of St Giles in the capital. Knox had authority to call general assemblies, served as a visitor, and had the ear of the English ambassador, who in all his dispatches during Mary's personal rule seems only once to have alluded to Spottiswoode (and even then only in the context of Knox's activities, without mentioning his name). Knox's name also took precedence over Spottiswoode's in a decree granting the earl of Eglinton's divorce in 1562. Nor was Spottiswoode elected moderator of the general assembly, though a regular attender at its meetings.<br>
<br>In May 1565 Spottiswoode, who was by now married to Beatrix Crichton, mother of his two sons <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26167/', "John Spottiswoode")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26165/', "James Spottiswood")</script>, delivered to the queen a petition from the brethren of Edinburgh seeking punishment of adulterers and papists and was assured by the queen in &#145;fair words&#146; of her desire to satisfy men's consciences  (<span class="italic">Knox's History</span>, 2.147). He also several times presented to Mary petitions for payment of ministers' stipends. In December 1565 he was appointed by the general assembly to seek from the queen redress of grievances, and in 1566 to ask her that Prince James &#145;be baptized according to the form used in the Reformed Church&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of the Church</span>, 2.40). Although Mary received him graciously, she avoided answering. Yet she allowed him to take the prince in his arms and to offer &#145;a short and pithy prayer, which was very attentively heard by her&#146;; thereafter &#145;he spake to the babe, and willed him to say Amen for himself; which she took in so good part, as continually afterwards she called the superintendent her Amen&#146;  (ibid.). In the event James was baptized according to Roman Catholic rites, but on 29 July 1567, following Mary's enforced abdication, Spottiswoode officiated at James's protestant coronation at Stirling. With Mary's escape from captivity in Lochleven Castle and the ensuing civil war, he attempted to rally support for the king's cause in a letter in 1569 in which he admonished those nobles who supported Mary and urged them to defect to the king's party, for Mary was an adulterer and murderer who &#145;deserved more than ten deaths&#146;  (Calderwood, 2.482).<br>
<br>A participant in the convention of Leith in 1572, which sought to settle the vexed question of ecclesiastical endowment and assimilate protestant bishops, Spottiswoode continued to discharge his duties as superintendent of Lothian and to convene meetings of the synod of Lothian, despite the appointment of an archbishop of St Andrews. He repeatedly urged the general assembly to let him demit his superintendent's office, but the assembly showed reluctance. Even in 1575, when Spottiswoode was said to have &#145;become sickly and not altogether able in his own person presently to visit the whole bounds allotted to him in commission&#146;  (Thomson, 1.327), the assembly encouraged him to persevere and granted him the support of assistant visitors. In April 1576 he was censured by the assembly for inaugurating Alexander Hepburn to the bishopric of Ross after &#145;being admonished of the brethren not to doe it&#146;  (ibid., 1.349). Yet he remained prominent in the assembly's deliberations until old age and infirmity intervened. Although he seems to have played no part in the preparation of the second <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span>, when the assembly pressed ahead with plans for presbyteries in 1581 it was recommended that a presbytery seat be located at Calder, where Spottiswoode &#145;might be had to be moderator&#146;  (ibid., 2.523). As his son John Spottiswoode, the historian and archbishop of St Andrews, remarked of his father in his declining years:<blockquote>When he saw the ministers take such liberty as they did, and heard of the disorders raised in the Church through that confused parity which men laboured to introduce, as likewise the irritations the king received by a sort of foolish preachers, he lamented extremely the case of the Church to those that came to visit him, who were not a few, and of the better sort. (<span class="italic">History of the Church</span>, 2.336&#150;7)</blockquote>Spottiswoode died in his seventy-sixth year, on 5 December 1585, &#145;well esteemed for his piety and wisdom, loving, and beloved of all persons, charitable to the poor, and careful above all things to give no man offence&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
