</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Abrahams,  Harold Maurice</span>  (1899&#150;1978), <span class="occ">athlete and civil servant</span>, was born at 30 Rutland Road, Bedford, on 15 December 1899, the youngest in the family of two daughters and four sons of Isaac Klonimus (1850&#150;1921) of Vladislavovka in Russian-occupied Poland and his wife, Esther Isaacs, of Merthyr Tudful. Klonimus, who proclaimed himself a Lithuanian Jew, escaped to Britain and by 1880 had changed his name to Abrahams, in recognition of his father, Abraham Klonimus (<i>b</i>. 1810).<br>
<br>Though Isaac Abrahams never mastered the script (and barely the speech) of his host country, he set up the Bedfordshire Loan Company in 1885 and was naturalized in 1902. In the county town, in addition to moneylending, he dealt as a certificated pedlar in jewellery, gold, and silver plate. Despite their tempestuous marriage Esther and he raised four remarkable sons. Adolphe, the eldest, after gaining firsts at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, became a consultant physician at Westminster Hospital and was knighted in 1939. Sir Sidney Solomon (Solly) Abrahams, who competed for Britain at both the Olympic celebrations at Athens (1906) and Stockholm (1912), was sworn of the privy council after serving as chief justice of Tanganyika and Ceylon. The third son, Lionel, became senior partner of his firm of solicitors and was coroner for Huntingdonshire.<br>
<br>Harold Abrahams was sent to Bedford School, briefly to St Paul's, and afterwards to Repton, where he won the public schools' 100 yards and long-jump championships in 1918. His imagination had been fired in the summer of 1908, when he watched his brother compete in the fourth Olympic games at the White City stadium, London. He served briefly as a second lieutenant in 1919 and then went up to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, to read law. If the road to popularity at university lies in never inculcating a sense of inferiority into one's contemporaries, Abrahams stood little chance of being popular. Athletically he swept all before him with three wins in the freshmen's sports at Fenners and was immediately selected for the sixth Olympic games in Antwerp. He stood 6ft &frac12;in. and had a spare but muscular frame. He won a unique eight victories at the 100 yards, 440 yards, and long jump in the annual Oxford versus Cambridge sports. His election to the Hawks club was opposed due to a contribution by him to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, which the committee regarded as immodest. <span class="italic">Chariots of Fire</span>, a highly successful film on the life of Abrahams, stressed an antisemitic undertone of his time at Cambridge. Though he did not live to see the film, Abrahams, on his own testimony, would certainly have regarded such a portrayal as over-fanciful.<br>
<br>Before the next Olympic games, held in the stade de Colombes in Paris in 1924, Abrahams trained assiduously with his north-country coach Sam Mussabini, a French Arab. For nine months they worked on the theory of perfecting the start, on arm action, control of the stride pattern, and a then-unique &#145;drop&#146; finish of the torso on to the tape. As a stickler for accuracy, Abrahams would have regarded the portrayal of Mussabini in the stade de Colombes (whereas he remained anxiously in Britain) as an excess of cinematic licence. At the 1924 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92495', "Amateur Athletic Association (AAA)")</script> championship Abrahams won the 100 yards in 9.9 seconds but was still a fifth of a second outside the British record set the previous year by the great Scottish rugby and athletic hero and 440-yard champion Eric Liddell. In Paris the twenty-three eliminating heats to bring the seventy-five starters down to twelve semi-finalists were to be staged on Sunday 6 July and Liddell, a strong sabbatarian, felt impelled to confine himself to the 200 and 400 metres, in which he took the bronze medal in the shorter event and the gold medal for 400 metres in a time which gave him the metric world record. Abrahams equalled the Olympic record in the 100 metres in the second round with 10.6 seconds and next day, despite being badly &#145;left&#146; in a poor start in the semi-final, came through (again in 10.6 seconds) to beat by inches the world record holder, Charles Paddock, from the USA. Abrahams later said that the next three-and-three-quarter hours were the worst in his life because now he knew he could win. At 7.05 p.m. he came out with the four Americans, Paddock, Scholz, Murchison, and Bowman, and the Oxford Rhodes scholar Arthur Porritt, from New Zealand.<br>
<br>Abrahams was drawn in lane four and got a perfect start. He showed fractionally ahead at half-way and dropped on to the tape 2 feet clear of Scholz, with Porritt beating Bowman for third. His winning time of 10.52 seconds would under later rules have been returned as 10.5 but was rounded up to 10.6. Abrahams thus set three Olympic record-equalling performances in the space of twenty-six hours. In Paris there were no flag-raising victory ceremonies. His gold medal, sadly later stolen, was sent to him by post. In May 1925 Abrahams severely injured a leg when attempting to improve on his English native long-jump record of 24 feet 2&frac12; inches (7.38 metres), which had been set at Woolwich and which survived for more than thirty years.<br>
<br>His athletic career ended, Abrahams applied his analytical mind to the bar, to which he had been called at the Inner Temple in 1924, and where he practised until 1940. He also engaged in athletics administration and journalism with the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> (1925&#150;67), and was a consummate radio broadcaster with the BBC for fifty years (1924&#150;74). Against the stolid petty opposition of senior office-holders in various governing bodies, often athletes <i>manqu&eacute;s</i>, he managed by sheer force of personality and with very few allies to raise athletics from a minor to a major national sport. His innovative mind and drafting ability enabled him to rewrite the AAA rules of competition which themselves transformed the rules of the International Amateur Athletic Federation. He was possessed of a fresh resonant voice, while his clear diction and wide vocabulary were models for any English speaker.<br>
<br>Abrahams served as honorary treasurer (1948&#150;68) and chairman (1948&#150;75) of the British Amateur Athletic Board. In November 1976 he was elected president of the AAA. He was an unrivalled compiler of athletics statistics and was founder president of both the world and British associations in this field, the Association of Track and Field Statisticians (instituted in 1950) and the National Union of Track Statisticians (instituted in 1956). His <span class="italic">Oxford versus Cambridge, 1827&#150;1930</span> (compiled with J. Bruce-Kerr, 1931), which listed all the 7489 blues, inevitably resulted in the exposure of a number of self-appointed blues in the bars and clubs of the world. During the Second World War he was with the Ministry of Economic Warfare (1939&#150;44) and then with the new Ministry of Town and Country Planning until 1963. He was secretary of the National Parks Commission (1950&#150;63). He was appointed CBE in 1957.<br>
<br>In 1936 Abrahams married Sybil Marjorie, daughter of Claude Pilington Evers, assistant master at Rugby School. She was a D'Oyly Carte singer and producer of light opera and died suddenly in 1963. During his fourteen years as a widower, Abrahams always carried a gold medallion bearing her effigy in profile. This he privately referred to as &#145;my real gold medal&#146;. They had an adopted daughter and an adopted son. Abrahams died on 14 January 1978 at Chase Farm Hospital, Enfield, London. An English Heritage blue plaque was unveiled in 2007 at Hodford Lodge, 2 Hodford Road, Golders Green, Abrahams's London home at the time he won the Olympic gold medal in Paris.<br>
