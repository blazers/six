<span class="headword">Fromanteel,  Ahasuerus</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1607, <em>d.</em> 1693), <span class="occ">clockmaker and mechanic</span>, was baptized in the Dutch Reformed church at Norwich on 25 February 1607, the eldest of five sons and two daughters of Mordecai Fromanteel, wood turner, and his wife, Leah. The Fromanteels were an armigerous family of high standing in Flanders during the sixteenth century; to escape life under Spanish rule a number of them crossed to East Anglia, to settle in Colchester, Norwich, and London. During Fromanteel's lifetime he and his children frequently passed between England and the Low Countries, though references to them simply as &#145;Fromanteel&#146; make identification problematic.<br>
<br>Fromanteel was apprenticed as a blacksmith for seven years, afterwards moving to London in June 1629 where he set up as a maker of steeple clocks at East Smithfield, joining the Blacksmiths' Company in 1631. He also made conventional lantern clocks with balance-wheel escapement, and spring-driven table clocks. He was made free of the Clockmakers' Company in 1632. The Fromanteels' relationship with the Clockmakers' was always contentious: in 1658 Ahasuerus and his son Louis were proceeded against for taking more apprentices than was allowed, which suggests a flourishing business, and in later years there were arguments over payments of quarterage for those years when they were out of the country.<br>
<br>In 1631 Fromanteel married Maria de Bruijne of Colchester. They raised six sons and two daughters, of whom Louis, Ahasuerus (1640&#150;1703), John (<i>d</i>. before 1692), and Abraham (1646&#150;1730), also became clockmakers. Ahasuerus Fromanteel senior, after a year of fruitless discussion with the elders of the Dutch Reformed church in London, was in 1646 officially proclaimed to have gone over to the Baptists, a move which he and his wife marked by having themselves rebaptized.<br>
<br>While on a visit to Amsterdam in 1648, Fromanteel spoke with Benjamin Worsley concerning microscopes, explaining that, having made tubes for Cornelis Drebbel's microscopes, he had been sufficiently interested to grind lenses himself, four of which he had brought to Amsterdam for sale. Worsley was impressed by their quality and persuaded Fromanteel to make him a microscope when he returned to London.<br>
<br>In 1657 John Fromanteel went to the Netherlands to learn the art of making pendulum clocks as invented by Huygens in 1656 and made there by Salomon Coster. On John's return in 1658 Ahasuerus Fromanteel lost no time in advertising this new method of regulation, suitable for steeple and domestic clocks, &#145;made by Ahasuerus Fromanteel, who made the first that were in England&#146;. They could be had at his house in Moses Alley, Southwark, or at the sign of the Mermaid in Lothbury (for over a century a noted shop for clocks). He also advertised his &#145;new invented engins for quenching of fire&#146;, which were made in a variety of sizes, some small enough to be carried upstairs in a house, and which would also serve for &#145;the washing of vermin of Trees and Hops, &amp; for the watering of Gardens &amp; Cloaths, &amp; the like&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Politicus</span>, no. 439, 28 Oct 1658). A further (undated) list of his undertakings mentions a weight-driven clock striking the quarters on two bells and the hour on another bell; a watch or clock to run for a month or a year with a single winding; a clock keeping time without a balance, instead of which &#145;there shall be a pleasant motion of bullets runing continually&#146;; an engine to level the bottom of the river, taking away the shelves or sandbanks on which craft could run aground, and other engines to raise water or weights &#145;and many things of this kinde&#146;  (Hartlib MS 71/19/1A).<br>
<br>One Fromanteel clock &#145;to run a month or more&#146; was sold to Dudley Palmer FRS of Gray's Inn in 1654 for &pound;200, another to the lord protector in 1657 for &pound;300, considerable sums at this time. John Evelyn, in 1660, saw one of Fromanteel's more elaborate clocks in the king's cabinet, and in 1661 recorded a visit he paid in the company of Huygens to view Fromanteel's pendulum clocks. In July 1679 one of Fromanteel's fire-engines was ordered for the city of Norwich.<br>
<br>Fromanteel's decision to settle in the Netherlands between 1667 and 1676 may have been caused by the problems which afflicted Baptists in London at that time. His son Abraham joined him, leaving the London business in the hands of John and his own former apprentice Thomas Loomes, to whom John had been apprenticed and who was married to Ahasuerus's daughter Mary. On his return some ten years later Abraham was made free of the Clockmakers' Company at his father's urgent request; he later settled in Newcastle upon Tyne, where he died in 1730. John returned with his brother Ahasuerus to the Netherlands in 1680, where the latter settled and started an important workshop in Amsterdam.<br>
<br>After Maria's death, Ahasuerus married, about 1660, Sarah Winnock (<i>d</i>. 1665), a widow with three sons and a daughter. He was living in Whitechapel, where other members of the Fromanteel family worked as silk weavers, at the time of his death early in 1693 and was buried at St Mary Matfelon, Whitechapel, on 31 January 1693.<br>
