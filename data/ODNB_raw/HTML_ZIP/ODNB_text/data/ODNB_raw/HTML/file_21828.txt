<span class="headword">Pencester <span class="st"> [Penchester, Penshurst]</span>, Sir  Stephen  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1298), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, is of obscure origins&#151;surprisingly so, in the light of his prominence later. Evidence even for the names of his parents or his date of birth is lacking. Edward Hasted, the late-eighteenth-century historian of Kent, claimed that Pencester's family took their name from Penshurst soon after the time of William I, but this is conjectural. His manor of Penshurst was held at his death in portions from four different lords, so it is uncertain what he inherited there. Most of his other possessions were acquired in his own lifetime. He referred in a charter of 1282 to his uncle John Belemeyns, a canon of St Paul's, London, from at least 1216 to about 1252, who had endowed a chapel at Leigh near Penshurst.<br>
<br>Pencester first appears in royal records in June 1263, when, probably already a knight, he was made captain to repress disorder in Sussex and Kent. He must already have acquired administrative experience, perhaps in the service of the Clare lords of Tonbridge, 5 miles from Penshurst. If so, he changed his allegiance, once civil war began to divide local society, to the Lord Edward, who was henceforth his patron. He was certainly unsuccessful as captain: his powers were given to Roger of Leybourne in December 1263. Once royal authority was restored in 1265, however, Pencester's career revived. Keeper of Hastings, Winchelsea, and Rye from November 1265, he became constable of Dover Castle, initially as Edward's deputy, in December 1267, and sheriff of Kent from 1268 to 1271. In August 1271 he was first referred to as warden of the Cinque Ports; Leybourne's death in that year probably offers a partial explanation for his rise to local prominence. Thereafter Pencester served as both warden and constable until his own death. Deputies were often appointed, but royal mandates imply, and sometimes specify, that he exercised close personal control over his offices.<br>
<br>On Edward I's return to England in 1274, Pencester's appointments were confirmed, with an allowance of &pound;274 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. later raised to &pound;300, to maintain Dover Castle and his staff. As warden, he enforced royal orders to regulate cross-channel travel and trade, such as the embargo on exports of wool to Flanders of 1270&#150;74. He also supervised the government of the ports, exacting the services that they owed to the crown and intervening in their disputes, whether local, like those over rights in Minster and Fordwich, or with other towns, notably Yarmouth in Norfolk. These powers spilled over into more general peacekeeping in the south-east, orders to arrest malefactors in Kent and Sussex being accompanied by a stream of more specific oyer and terminer commissions, often joining Pencester with established royal judges. Some, like the inquiries into former rebels in Canterbury in 1275, or into royal rights usurped by Gilbert de Clare, earl of Gloucester, in 1279, reflected the inheritance of disputes from the civil wars of the 1260s. Responsibility for collecting revenues in the ports also led Pencester into a wider involvement with royal fiscal policy, joining a commission to prosecute coin-clippers, mostly Jews, and to regulate the workings of the royal exchanges in 1279. From 1281 he took a leading role in implementing Edward I's project to build the new town of Winchelsea. But Pencester's one diplomatic mission to Gascony, with Otto de Grandson in 1276, does not seem to have been repeated, though he was in Wales for part of 1277.<br>
<br>It seems therefore that the pattern of Pencester's regional responsibilities set in the 1270s lasted to the end of his life, though in the 1290s he had to cope with the additional demands of the French war: first the attempts to resolve maritime disputes in 1291&#150;4, and then the war effort itself, culminating in the king's Flemish expedition of 1297. His career set important precedents in linking together responsibilities for the government of south-east England and its coastline under the wardenship of the Cinque Ports based at Dover. He showed an ability to work with other royal officials and with the leaders of local society, even in some measure to reconcile their interests; though the evidence for this is largely negative, in the relative paucity of complaints against him in Edwardian records. The chronicle of Dover Priory, championing the cause of Prior Richard de Wenchepe, who was faced with a revolt of his own monks in 1270&#150;73, accused Pencester of hostility to the prior, and dramatized several conversations between them. But the events suggest rather that Pencester sought to avoid involvement in the dispute, until forced into action by royal command.<br>
<br>While the focus of his authority was in Dover, Pencester accumulated property near his original holdings in west Kent. A grant of free warren in his demesne lands at Penshurst, Tonbridge, Hever, and Chiddingstone in 1263 was augmented by another in 1280, for demesnes he now held at Allington, Boxley, and Aylesford. Licence to crenellate his house at Hever in 1271 was followed by another in 1281 for Allington, where he also held a market and fair. The flow of royal favours normal for an official in good standing was accompanied by occasional substantial grants, the largest that of &pound;600 &#145;for his long and praiseworthy service&#146; in 1277  (<span class="italic">CClR, 1272&#150;1279</span>, 379). Nevertheless, given the scale of that service over thirty years, his fortunes bear out the view that Edward I rewarded his agents sparingly.<br>
<br>Pencester married first Rose de Baseville, before 1268, then by 1281 Margaret, a member of the de Burgh family, though her exact parentage is unclear. On her death in 1308 her heir was John Orreby, her son from a previous marriage, while her dower lands reverted to Pencester's two daughters from his marriage to Rose: Joan &#145;aged forty and more&#146; and Alice &#145;aged thirty and more&#146;. Pencester himself died between 14 February and 14 April 1298, not 1299 as misreported in a later entry on the close roll for 1313. His failure to leave a male heir meant that his estates were broken up, and this has contributed to the obscurity of his family history. He is commemorated by the upper half of a Purbeck marble effigy in Penshurst church, where he was buried.<br>
