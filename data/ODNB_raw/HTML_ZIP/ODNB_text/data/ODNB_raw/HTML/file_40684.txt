<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Edrich,  William John <span class="st"> [Bill]</span></span>  (1916&#150;1986), <span class="occ">cricketer</span>, was born on 26 March 1916 in Lingwood, Norfolk, the second son and second child in the family of four sons and a daughter of William Archer Edrich, tenant farmer, and his wife, Edith Mattocks, originally of Cumbrian farming stock, whose family had moved to Norfolk. Educated at Bracondale School, Norwich, where his cricketing prowess soon became evident, Bill Edrich was a member of a noted family of cricketers, which was able to field an entire eleven under the family name. His three brothers&#151;Geoffrey, Eric, and Brian&#151;all played first-class cricket, while his cousin John Hugh Edrich MBE was to be a well-known Surrey and England batsman.<br>
<br>After several successful seasons with Norfolk in the minor counties championship, Edrich was advised to seek an engagement with Middlesex. He qualified for Middlesex and lived in London, playing variously for the Marylebone Cricket Club and Norfolk. He made his first-class d&eacute;but for the minor counties in 1934, and such was his progress that, in his first full season for Middlesex in 1937, he scored more than 2000 runs, and was chosen to accompany the third Baron Tennyson's tour of India the following winter. In spite of several failures, he retained his test place, and in South Africa in the winter of 1938&#150;9 he scored a match-saving 219 at Durban. In 1938 he managed the unusual feat of 1000 runs before the end of May. During the Second World War he served as a pilot with 21 squadron, Coastal Command, rising from flight lieutenant to acting squadron leader, and his bravery was rewarded with the DFC (1941).<br>
<br>Returning to the cricketing fray in 1946, Edrich eventually regained his England place&#151;his test career was always dogged by selectors' inconsistencies&#151;and in 1947 he changed status from professional to amateur. The year 1947 proved to be his greatest. In partnership with the mercurial <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63003/', "Denis Compton")</script>, he broke many records, and Middlesex and England flourished accordingly. In that summer he made 3539 runs, including 12 centuries, and averaged 80.43. He captained Middlesex from 1951 to 1957, initially in harness with Denis Compton, and, after his retirement from first-class cricket in 1959, played for his native Norfolk until 1971.<br>
<br>In his 571 games in first-class cricket, Edrich scored 36,965 runs, including 86 centuries, with an average of 42.39. His highest score was 269 not out, against Northamptonshire in 1947. He also took 479 wickets and 529 catches, and made a solitary stumping. In 39 test matches he scored 2440 runs for an average of 40, and took 41 wickets.<br>
<br>Edrich approached his cricketing duties with much the same fervour with which he tackled his romantic ventures. Gusto and valour were his watchwords. As a batsman, he was a courageous player of quick bowling, relishing the hook and the pull-drive, and dealing plainly and authoritatively with much that he faced. As a bowler, he rushed intrepidly into the attack, hurling the ball awkwardly at often startled opponents. He was a most effective fielder, initially in the out-field, but mainly in the slips. Above all, he was, in cricket as in his domestic life, abundantly cheery and optimistic. A Robert Bruce among cricketers, he was ever ready to try again. A very popular sportsman, he was only a little short of the highest rank of cricketers, and his fame was very much bound up with his sparkling relationship with Denis Compton. The sports journalist R. C. Robertson-Glasgow wrote that, while Compton was poetry, Edrich was &#145;prose, robust and clear&#146;. Edrich was short, dark, and keen-eyed, with brisk, lithe movements. A man of ardent amorous energies, he was married five times, each for relatively short periods. His first four marriages ended in divorce, and his fifth wife outlived him briefly. His first marriage, in 1936, was to Betty, typist, daughter of Sydney William Hobbs, railway official. The marriage ended in divorce in 1944 and in the same year he married Marion, an officer in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, the divorced wife of Edward Reginald Fish and daughter of Albert Ernest Forster, works manager. They were divorced in 1948, and in 1949 he married Jessy Shaw, the divorced wife of Harold Tetley and daughter of Hubert Gomersall, building society manager. They had one son and the marriage ended with divorce in 1960. In the same year he married Brenda Valerie Terry, insurance consultant, whose previous marriage had been dissolved, the daughter of Constant Wells Ponder, medical practitioner. They had one son; the marriage ended with divorce in 1973. His fifth and final marriage, in 1983, was to Mary Elizabeth Somerville, hairdresser, whose previous marriage had been dissolved, daughter of Frederick Vincent Wesson, sales manager. Edrich died in Chesham as the result of a fall down the stairs at home, following a St George's day celebration, just after midnight on 24 April 1986. A grandstand at Lord's cricket ground is named after him, matching one for Denis Compton.<br>
