<span class="headword">Loosemore,  Henry</span>  (1605<span class="mult">x</span>9&#150;1670), <span class="occ">composer and organist</span>, was born probably at Barnstaple, Devon, son of Samuel Loosemore (<i>bap</i>. 1577, <i>d</i>. 1642) and his wife, Gillian Maney (<i>bap</i>. 1584), and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17007/', "John Loosemore (1613/14&#150;1681)")</script>, the Exeter organ builder, and <a href="#cosubject_17005">George Loosemore [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Although his ancestors had lived at Bishop's Nympton since the early sixteenth century, Henry may have been a chorister in one of the Cambridge colleges and spent most of his adult life in the service of King's College. At Michaelmas 1627 he was listed for the first time as lay clerk and organist, and he continued to receive regular payments in respect of both posts for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>In his long career at King's, Loosemore apparently served the college well. At Christmas 1627 he was paid for copying a new organ book (probably New York Public Library, MS Drexel 5469), and during the next three years he received further payments for augmenting the college's choral partbooks and for binding his organ book. Most of Loosemore's extant compositions are choral and were composed for liturgical use at King's, though six keyboard dances and two consort pieces by him also survive. Loosemore's sacred music includes two services, full anthems (one of which, &#145;O Lord, increase my / our faith&#146;, was long attributed to Orlando Gibbons), and verse anthems. Although the quality of his music is variable, his best work is very well crafted and bears comparison with that of his more famous contemporaries.<br>
<br>On 17 February 1634 Loosemore married Elizabeth Brooke (<i>bap</i>. 1595, <i>d</i>. 1660) at St Botolph's, Cambridge. In 1640 he took the Cambridge MusB degree. Between 1640 and 1652 Loosemore was paid for teaching the choristers at King's, though with the cessation of choral services by 1643 all his college posts probably became sinecures. Between 1652 and 1660 he is said to have acted as organist and music teacher to the family of Dudley, third Baron North, at Kirtling, Cambridgeshire, but he evidently resumed his full college duties at the Restoration. On 7 July 1670, having &#145;died suddenly in a privy house&#146;  (Shaw, 357), he was buried at St Botolph's, Cambridge.<br>
<br>Loosemore's brother <a name="cosubject_17005"></a><span class="headword">George Loosemore</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1619, <em>d.</em> in or before 1682), <span class="occ">composer and organist</span>, was baptized on 12 September 1619 at Barnstaple. Having been a chorister at King's College, Cambridge, he was from 13 June 1635 organist at Jesus College.<br>
<br>Most of Loosemore's music, which is both sacred and incomplete, survives in two autograph manuscripts at the British Library, London, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he became organist in 1660. He is known also to have composed fancies for viols, now lost, which were admired by Baron North, of Kirtling, whose family Loosemore served as organist and music teacher between 1660 and 1666, following in his brother Henry's footsteps. Loosemore possessed neither the technical fluency nor the creative talent of his brother, to whose best music his own is inferior. In October 1665 he was paid by Jesus College for copying choral music, and in the same year he obtained the Cambridge MusD degree. He was dead by 11 September 1682, and his widow, Honorah, died on 3 February 1692.<br>
