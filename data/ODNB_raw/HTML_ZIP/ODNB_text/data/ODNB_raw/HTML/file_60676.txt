<span class="headword">Dunbar,  Andrea</span>  (1961&#150;1990), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born on 22 May 1961 at 23 Oliver Street, East Bowling, Bradford, the third of the eight children of John Brian Dunbar (1936&#150;1989), a wool warehouseman, and his wife, Alma (<i>b</i>. 1935), a worsted twister, daughter of John Chippendale of Bradford and his wife, Millicent. Both Andrea's grandfathers were woolcombers and both her parents were textile workers at the time of their marriage in 1958. However, with the decline of the textile industry her father found alternative employment as a demolition worker until an injury left him partially disabled. His consequent feckless drinking, and foul-mouthed and sometimes violently abusive behaviour towards his wife and children at their council-house home on Bradford's notorious Buttershaw estate, has been identified as the dramatic centre of Andrea's childhood.<br>
<br>Andrea Dunbar was educated at Horton Bank Top junior school from 1966 to 1972 and Buttershaw high school from 1972 to 1977. She showed little interest in school until her repeated failure to bring the required ingredients to her domestic science lessons resulted in an imposition, which turned into a spontaneously hilarious, pertinently intelligent two-page essay questioning the relevance to her family situation of the confection of a raspberry pavlova. Sympathetic teachers recognized, in her talent for observation of the foibles of human behaviour, her potential as a writer: she was encouraged to develop a taped dialogue for submission as coursework for CSE English. She later confessed that at that time she read little other than horror comics, and learned to write dramatic dialogue by copying out the Victorian melodrama <span class="italic">Maria Marten, or, Murder in the Red Barn</span>, the story of a rich seducer and an innocent country lass. Her education was interrupted when she became pregnant at fourteen and lost the baby she was carrying following a car crash. She subsequently returned to school to develop her burgeoning interest in drama, leaving with three CSEs at sixteen with no particular plans or aspirations for her future, and obtaining employment French combing at Bowling Mills in Bradford.<br>
<br>In 1980 Dunbar entered the script of her first play, <span class="italic">The Arbor</span>&#151;written when she was a fifteen-year-old schoolgirl in green biro on pages torn from a school exercise book&#151;in a national competition for young writers. Her work impressed Max Stafford-Clark, director of London's Royal Court Theatre, and the play was produced at the Theatre Upstairs before transfer to the main stage, where it followed Richard Eyre's celebrated production of <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>. &#145;For most of the Royal Court audience&#146;, one sympathetic critic observed, &#145;the language and substance of the play were as remote as a piece of anthropology&#146;  (Ritchie). Revolving around the pregnancy and subsequent miscarriage of the central character, the semi-autobiographical play was set against a background of domestic violence, boredom, poverty, and overcrowding in Brafferton Arbor, the crescent on the Bradford council estate where Andrea had spent her childhood and adolescence. Its success resulted in the commissioning of a second play, <span class="italic">Rita, Sue and Bob too</span>, a ribald comedy-drama in which a pair of teenage schoolgirls living on a run-down Bradford council estate are seduced by an older married man for whom they work as babysitters. Opening at the Royal Court in 1982, it was awarded the George Devine award for promising young playwrights and subsequently adapted for the cinema in 1986. A third play, <span class="italic">Shirley</span>, centring upon the infidelity of the play's eponymous heroine while her long-standing boyfriend serves a short prison sentence, opened at the Theatre Upstairs in 1985 and was acclaimed by the critic Michael Billington as &#145;a short, sharp, brutally funny slice of Bradford life&#146;  (&#145;Andrea Dunbar a tribute&#146;, Bradford Libraries and Information Services).<br>
<br>Dunbar's three plays about contemporary working-class urban life were widely praised for their earthy realism and sharp wit. The playwright Shelagh Delaney pronounced her &#145;the genius from the slums&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mail on Sunday</span>, quoted in <span class="italic">Bradford Telegraph and Argus</span>, 21 Dec 1990), while the drama critic Benedict Nightingale dubbed Dunbar &#145;the bard of the West Riding council-estate jungle&#146; and hailed her achievement in &#145;steeping herself in a distinctive geographical, social and human area&#146;, making it &#145;unmistakably her own&#146;  (B. Nightingale, <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, undated, &#145;Andrea Dunbar a tribute&#146;, Bradford Libraries and Information Services). The tabloid press sensationally represented her work as &#145;Thatcher's Britain with its Knickers Down&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 30 Aug 2000). However, her writing was as devoid of political and social comment as it was of moralizing and self-pity. She simply recorded her raw experiences of social and cultural deprivation in the depressed environment of the council estate which she knew best in the 1980s, revealing an acute ear for idiom, a firm grasp of a dramatic narrative, an impressive capacity for total recall, and an ability to import humour into the direst of circumstances.<br>
<br>Dunbar's personal life was certainly tumultuous and ultimately tragic. After the trauma of her initial teenage pregnancy and miscarriage she never married, but had three more children by different fathers between 1979 and 1983, seeking refuge from the first of these partners, an Asian taxi driver, in an eighteen-month sojourn in a refuge for battered women at Keighley. Moreover, the release of the film version of <span class="italic">Rita, Sue and Bob too</span> created a furore in her native Bradford, where &#145;all hell broke loose &hellip; at news of the contents of the film&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bradford Telegraph and Argus</span>, 21 Dec 1990). Dunbar recognized that the film<blockquote>probably upset councillors who would like to show a fairytale side of Bradford and ignore the darker elements of it, the Tourist Office who also shut their eyes to the rundown parts and even some residents on the Buttershaw estate itself. (<span class="italic">Bradford Telegraph and Argus</span>, 11 Sept 1987)</blockquote>The film also received some hostile reviews. The <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span> critic pronounced it &#145;without doubt the crudest film I have ever seen&#146;  (9 Sept 1987), while the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> complained of ninety minutes of &#145;unmitigated abusive gloom &hellip; filmed with an inexperienced cast and an appalling script&#146;  (quoted in <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, 6 Sept 1987). Her unofficial agent, Rob Ritchie, commented: &#145;I think the film was the point at which whatever dreams she might have had about being a writer collapsed. It unleashed all those problems for her family and the community that she was living in&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 30 Aug 2000). However, Dunbar insisted on riding out the storm of controversy by remaining close to her roots in Bradford with the children she adored, even after arousing further controversy when she was fined by Bradford magistrates for claiming social security without declaring her royalty payments.<br>
<br>Grotesquely caricatured in appearance by some journalists as &#145;boot-faced&#146; with &#145;black teeth&#146; and hard-bitten fingernails  (<span class="italic">Mail on Sunday</span>), others commented more sympathetically on Dunbar's watchful eyes, strong chin, and brilliant smile. She was usually photographed informally, sometimes at her local enjoying a pint of ale or in the bleaker surroundings of the desolate Buttershaw estate with its boarded-up windows, graffiti-vandalized walls, and tangled, overgrown gardens. Beneath a belligerent fa&ccedil;ade she displayed a disarming modesty, shyness, and sensitivity, but also an impermeable stoicism and dour stubbornness. A heavy drinker and smoker, and a victim of both domestic violence and sexual harassment, she suffered a brain haemorrhage and collapsed while drinking alone in her local public house on the afternoon of 20 December 1990 and was rushed to the Bradford Royal Infirmary, where she died at the age of twenty-nine. She professed no religious faith, but a neighbour on the Buttershaw estate, the Revd Arthur Tuffee, a Baptist minister, conducted her funeral service at Scholemoor Crematorium, Bradford, on 28 December 1990, describing her as a &#145;happy-go-lucky character, who spoke up for the poor and disadvantaged&#146;  (<span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>, 29 Dec 1990). New facilities for creative writers were established at Bradford Central Library as a living memorial to her in 1997, and the actor and playwright Robin Soans wrote a new play, <span class="italic">A State Affair</span>, a sequel to <span class="italic">The Arbor</span>, after revisiting the Buttershaw estate with Max Stafford-Clark in July 2000, which was premi&egrave;red in Liverpool in October 2000.<br>
