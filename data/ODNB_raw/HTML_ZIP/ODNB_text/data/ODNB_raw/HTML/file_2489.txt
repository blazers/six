<span class="headword">Blackadder <span class="st"> [Blacader]</span>,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1445&#150;1508), <span class="occ">administrator and archbishop of Glasgow</span>, may have been born in Berwickshire; he was the brother of Sir Patrick Blackadder of Tulliallan, Fife. He determined as BA at the University of St Andrews in 1462, was admitted to the faculty of arts at the University of Paris in 1464, and graduated MA there in 1465. A study of his seven visits to Rome from 1471 onwards, and especially after his admission as protonotary apostolic in 1476, shows him to have been a strong and forceful pursuer of causes for James III, James IV, and for himself at the papal curia, despite the debts he incurred with the apostolic camera as he sought to annex the precentorship of Dunkeld, the archdeaconry of St Andrews, and the archdeaconry of Aberdeen to his rectory of Lasswade, Edinburghshire, before being provided to the see of Aberdeen on 14 July 1480. He was transferred unconsecrated to Glasgow on 19 March 1483; the cathedral chapter there had already elected George Carmichael to the see by 13 February 1483, but this election was annulled by the pope, and Blackadder was consecrated in Rome between 13 and 30 April 1483.<br>
<br>Blackadder, conscious of the ancient traditions of Glasgow as a <i>filia specialis</i> of the Holy See, deeply resented being subject to the jurisdiction of William Scheves (<i>d</i>. 1497) when St Andrews was raised to the primacy of the Scottish church in 1487, and with his diocese he was formally exempted from its jurisdiction by Innocent VIII (<i>r</i>. 1484&#150;92) on 25 May 1488. Backed by a strong plea from James IV, whom Blackadder had supported in his rebellion against his father in 1488, Glasgow was raised to archiepiscopal and metropolitan, but not primatial status on 9 January 1492&#151;a situation which could only deepen the rift between the two metropolitan jurisdictions. Nevertheless, Blackadder remained an active, hard-working participant in the daily government of the realm. He was one of James III's representatives at the coronation of Henry VII at Westminster in 1485 and visited Spain twice, in 1495 and 1496, to seek a bride for James IV. He helped to negotiate the terms of the marriage settlement between James IV and Margaret Tudor, and performed their marriage ceremony in Holyrood Abbey on 8 August 1503.<br>
<br>A learned, orthodox archbishop, Blackadder also devoted much time and energy to his cathedral, refashioning its choir and transepts and extending a project to provide a proper setting for the shrine of St Kentigern, besides building a chapel at Culross, where St Kentigern was thought to have been educated. In February 1508 he set off on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. In June, having got to Venice, he made his will, leaving most of his goods and money for the completion of his building projects in Glasgow, to religious orders to preach the gospel throughout his archdiocese, and to the poor. But on 28 July 1508 he died at sea between Venice and Jaffa with twenty-six other pilgrims, almost certainly from typhoid or cholera, and never reached Jerusalem. He was probably buried at sea on the day of his death or soon after.<br>
