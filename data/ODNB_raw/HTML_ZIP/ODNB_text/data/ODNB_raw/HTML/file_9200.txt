<span class="headword">Faucit,  Helen</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Helena Faucit Saville or Savill; <em>married name </em>Helena Martin, Lady Martin]</span>  (1814&#150;1898), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 11 October 1814 in London or Greenwich, the fifth of the six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49703/', "John Faucit Saville (Savill) (1783?&#150;1853)")</script> and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49704/', "Harriet Elizabeth Savill, n&#233;e Diddear (1789&#150;1857)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49703/', "Saville, John Faucit")</script>], both of whom were actors. Her baptismal name, Helena, later used for literary and social purposes, was shortened to Helen for home and professional use. Savill was given as the surname at her parents' marriage and her own baptism, but she used Faucit publicly; after 1821 her mother, by then living with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9193/', "William Farren (1786&#150;1861)")</script>, retained the name Faucit professionally, and the two daughters, who stayed with her, were also called Faucit; her father (and eventually the sons) used the surname Savill(e). Helen had two half-brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33090/', "William Farren (1825&#150;1908)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9192/', "Henry Farren (1827&#150;1860)")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlytheatricalcareer"></a>Education and early theatrical career</h2>Like her elder sister, Harriet (Miss Faucit), with whom she is sometimes confused, Helen attended a boarding-school in Greenwich and studied for the stage under her stepfather's brother, the sympathetic but exacting Percy Farren. She suffered periodically from an illness affecting her chest and was sent to Brighton to recuperate. Her seaside reading and daydreaming later influenced her stage interpretations: an admirer of Milton's Satan, she saw a heroic spirit in Juliet and Desdemona as well. She spent her summers at Richmond, Surrey, where she once met Edmund Kean.<br>
<br>On 30 September 1833, at the small theatre in Richmond, Helen Faucit made her first stage appearance. Billed simply as &#145;A Young Lady&#146;, she portrayed Juliet very successfully; later she repeated this character and acted several others. But, although <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> praised her for naturalness and spontaneity (9 November), she did not satisfy Percy Farren. After two years of further study, punctuated by another trial at Richmond and a more ambitious one at Brighton, she was considered ready for London. The time was propitious, for the gap left by Fanny Kemble's departure had never been adequately filled. On 5 January 1836 she made her d&eacute;but at Covent Garden as Julia in Sheridan Knowles's <span class="italic">The Hunchback</span>, arousing such enthusiasm that she was given a three-year contract as leading lady. Reviewers pronounced her d&eacute;but one of the most successful within memory. They were disappointed, however, by her portrayals of traditional favourites such as Belvidera in Otway's <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span> (in which she was later very successful), and some early devotees turned against her. Although she was always popular with audiences, she had, for a while, an erratic relationship with critics. Her first new part, Margaret in Joanna Baillie's esteemed though untheatrical drama <span class="italic">The Separation</span> (25 February), enhanced her reputation.<h2>
<a name="RelationshipwithMacready"></a>Relationship with Macready</h2>When W. C. Macready joined Covent Garden in May 1836 (after he had assaulted Alfred Bunn at Drury Lane), Faucit had the first of many opportunities to play opposite him. Although she admired his acting, she initially resented his arrogance; soon, however, she became his adoring disciple. During the next season, 1836&#150;7, when she acted with both Charles Kemble and Macready, she portrayed nine Shakespearian heroines, mostly new to her. While she was generally cast in tragic or romantic roles, she revealed in Beatrice, acted for Kemble's farewell, an unexpected comic vivacity. Other notable parts were the heroine in Bulwer-Lytton's <span class="italic">The Duchess de la Valli&egrave;re</span> and the Countess of Carlisle in Browning's <span class="italic">Strafford</span>, first dramatic efforts by both writers. In the next two seasons Macready was manager as well as chief actor at Covent Garden. Faucit's infatuation with this happily married man, twice her age, had become very ardent; though fond of her, he kept their relationship platonic and directed her energy into improving her art. His approach to acting was more psychological than the ideal one of Kemble, her fatherly adviser. Her most popular part at Covent Garden&#151;indeed throughout her career&#151;was Pauline in Bulwer-Lytton's new play <span class="italic">The Lady of Lyons</span> (15 February 1838); in it she ran the gamut of emotions and made her audiences do the same. Another success was her portrayal of Hero, a comic <i>tour de force</i>, in Knowles's <span class="italic">Woman's Wit</span>. When Macready ended his management (summer 1839) and took an engagement at the Haymarket, Faucit, among others, followed him there. On 30 December, suffering from an attack of her recurrent illness, she withdrew, on doctors' orders, and took a prolonged rest at the seaside. Several actresses, jealous of Macready's attention to her, spread the rumour that she was pregnant; only her lawyer's threat of prosecution and her physicians' published diagnoses stopped the gossip. In later years this short-lived scandal was properly forgotten.<h2>
<a name="Rolesinthe1840s"></a>Roles in the 1840s</h2>Faucit returned to the Haymarket on 25 April 1840 and, after completing that season, remained for most of the next two. In addition to earlier popular parts she took roles in several new plays, notably Clara Douglas in Bulwer-Lytton's popular comedy <span class="italic">Money</span> and the heroine of Zouch Troughton's neo-Elizabethan tragedy <span class="italic">Nina Sforza</span>. Early in 1842 she joined Drury Lane, newly under Macready's management, and made her first appearance on 14 February. Her most important roles there were in the following season, 1842&#150;3. Particularly challenging was Lady Macbeth, which she attempted only once, during the absence of the &#145;heavy&#146; actress Mrs Warner; she had played this dreaded part &#145;remarkably&#146; well at Dublin that summer, Macready thought, but in London she became distraught and disappointed his expectations. Actually she was unsuited, either in physique or in conception of character, to reproduce Mrs Siddons's powerful Lady Macbeth, which was Macready's ideal. As Constance in <span class="italic">King John</span>, too, she was hampered by Mrs Siddons's influence: she failed when attempting her predecessor's grand passion, but gradually achieved an effective pattern of lofty moments contrasted with tender ones. Rosalind in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, which she had previously acted, was disappointingly assigned to Mrs Nisbett, who played it in Dorothy Jordan's &#145;saucy lackey&#146; tradition; Faucit's interpretation, suggesting emotional depth beneath the raillery, was seen on several nights, however. Rosalind was soon to become her most popular Shakespearian character. Interesting new roles were Mildred Tresham in Browning's <span class="italic">Blot in the 'Scutcheon</span>, potentially the most dramatic of his plays but insufficiently developed, and Lady Mabel in Westland Marston's <span class="italic">The Patrician's Daughter</span>, an attempt at blank-verse tragedy on a contemporary subject.<br>
<br>When Macready gave up management and went to America, Faucit began travelling in the provinces. She had proved her right to eminence in London (Macready considered her &#145;beyond all compare the best English actress&#146;; Macready, letter to T. J. Searle, Folger Shakespeare Library), but stardom on her own was another matter. Her great breakthrough came on 14 November 1843 at the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh. She opened triumphantly as Pauline, attracted crowded audiences from then on, and inspired lavish encomiums in the press. Her Lady Macbeth, now interpreted as a passionately loving wife who violated her own nature to help gratify her husband's ambition, proved particularly fascinating; her combination of wickedness, charm, and pathos, however, though convincing then for influential critics, was always controversial. In an &eacute;lite Edinburgh circle she met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34906/', "Theodore Martin (1816&#150;1909)")</script>, a lawyer and writer, who fell in love with her and pursued her for the next eight years. Her next engagement, at Glasgow, was equally successful, perhaps more so: even the resentful Walter Baynham said she was, from first to last, &#145;Glasgow's favourite actress&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Glasgow Stage</span>). In Scotland, where clergymen often denounced the theatre, reviewers praised Faucit for her inspirational performances. In the summer of 1844 she caused a furore of enthusiasm in Ireland (Cork and Limerick). In December 1844 and January 1845 she was in Paris as leading lady in a series of performances by an English company at the Salle Ventadour, with Macready in the starring roles. Although Desdemona, Ophelia, and Virginia (in Knowles's <span class="italic">Virginius</span>) were not starring parts, many French critics were ecstatic about her performances, and when she played Lady Macbeth she received so much applause that Macready was offended. An abridged version of <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> gave her a chance to act, with great success, one of her favourite characters. The engagement boosted Faucit's career but caused a rift in her friendship with Macready; they never acted together again.<br>
<br>An outstanding success in Dublin followed, Faucit's greatest triumph being as Antigone in an English version of Sophocles' tragedy (22 February 1845). This called for somewhat stylized acting and, in one passage, recitative with an orchestral background. Seeing Antigone as both heroic and vulnerable, she combined formal techniques with natural ones: for example, sculpturesque poses held only momentarily, and passionate vocal tones and facial expressions in the &#145;aria&#146;. Audiences found her portrayal exalting and deeply moving. Dublin's most eminent classical scholars presented her with a laudatory address and a gold fibula set with emeralds. Frederick Burton painted her portrait as <span class="italic">The Greek Muse</span>. Her success was so great that the Dublin manager produced a version of Euripides' <span class="italic">Iphigenia in Aulis</span> for her in 1846. Her starring career continued to flourish. Manchester had become a major centre of popularity, and numerous other towns welcomed her periodically. Occasionally she returned to the Haymarket in London; in 1847 she introduced Marston's <span class="italic">The Heart and the World</span> there, but it failed for want of action. At her brother J. F. Saville's theatre in Sheffield (January 1850) she first acted Iolanthe, the blind but na&iuml;vely happy princess in <span class="italic">King Ren&eacute;'s Daughter</span>, Theodore Martin's adaptation of a Danish &#145;dramatic poem&#146; by Henrik Hertz. This was repeated, to great applause, in Glasgow, and it became one of her most loved impersonations. A much acclaimed new creation was her Marie in Marston's <span class="italic">Philip of France and Marie de Meranie</span>, produced by William Farren at the Olympic on 4 November 1850, with G. V. Brooke as Philip. During another Olympic engagement, in 1851, she won favourable notices with Lady Macbeth, her first in London since the unsatisfactory attempt eight years previously.<h2>
<a name="MarriagetoTheodoreMartinandlatercareer"></a>Marriage to Theodore Martin and later career</h2>On 25 August 1851 Faucit finally married Theodore Martin at St Nicholas's Church, Brighton. The marriage was happy, and childless. Martin had previously moved to London and now had a lucrative business as a parliamentary agent; he continued his literary work as well. The Martins bought a fine house, 31 Onslow Square, where they entertained a wide circle of prominent friends. Mrs Martin, though occupied largely with domestic and social duties, occasionally accepted theatrical engagements (as Miss Helen Faucit) in London and the provinces. Her continued enthusiasm for her profession promoted respect for it among the privileged classes. She looked in vain for dependable new parts: her acting was praised at Manchester in <span class="italic">Adrienne Lecouvreur</span> (Martin's translation, 1852) and at the Haymarket in Browning's <span class="italic">Colombe's Birthday</span> (1853) and John Saunders's <span class="italic">Love's Martyrdom</span> (1855), but the plays drew mixed responses. Although she was a versatile actress, she limited her repertory by her preference for heroines of the now declining poetic drama. In 1858 she played Lady Macbeth to Samuel Phelps's Macbeth during the festival productions celebrating the princess royal's wedding; the occasion, though unsatisfactory, led to a successful engagement at Charles Dillon's Lyceum, where she acted Lady Macbeth, Pauline, and Beatrice. Among the most important engagements of her career were three at Drury Lane, the first with Phelps as male lead and the others with Walter Montgomery: in October&#150;December 1864 (Imogen and Lady Macbeth); in March&#150;April 1865 (Imogen, Rosalind, and Juliet); and in November&#150;December 1866 (Rosalind, Pauline, and Julia in <span class="italic">The Hunchback</span>). Despite initial problems readjusting to the huge theatre, she drew large, enthusiastic audiences and high praise from most critics (often at the expense of other actors). It is remarkable that an actress in her fifties, still impersonating the heroines of her youth&#151;and in a style associated with the past&#151;could have aroused so much admiration. Only rarely was an incongruity admitted: that she no longer looked like Juliet, or that Pauline could have been Claude's mother. As she continued to act such parts, however, in provincial engagements, the hints multiplied. Having decided to retire, Faucit gave a few farewell performances in 1869 and 1870 (Edinburgh, Glasgow twice, and Liverpool), then made her final farewell at Manchester (13&#150;25 November 1871), acting Lady Macbeth, Rosalind, Juliet, Pauline, Beatrice, and (on two last nights) Iolanthe and Portia's act IV. She later participated in a number of benefits, usually in London. Her two final performances were in 1879: Beatrice to Barry Sullivan's Benedick on 23 April, the inaugural night of the new Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford upon Avon; and Rosalind on 2 October at the Theatre Royal, Manchester, in a benefit for Mrs Charles Calvert.<h2>
<a name="Walesdeathandreputation"></a>Wales, death, and reputation</h2>In 1880 Theodore Martin was rewarded with a knighthood for his weighty biography of Prince Albert. The Martins, who had already been guests of the queen, continued to be favoured by the royal family and to have many friends among the aristocracy. In 1880, too, Lady Martin, at the urging of Geraldine Jewsbury, wrote the latter a &#145;letter&#146; (an essay) on the character of Ophelia; letters to various friends, on Portia, Desdemona, Juliet, Imogen, Rosalind, and Beatrice, followed. After separate publication in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>, these were collected in a book, <span class="italic">On some of Shakespeare's Female Characters</span> (1885); a further essay, on Hermione, was included in the 1891 edition. Despite their gushing style, these essays give valuable insights into the actress's interpretations. In the 1860s the Martins had bought and rebuilt a hillside house, Bryntysilio, near the River Dee in north Wales. In later years they spent increasingly long periods in this home, where they often entertained friends. Browning and his sister visited them daily while staying at nearby Llangollen (1886), and Queen Victoria took tea there one afternoon (1889). Lady Martin's final years were marred by periodic bouts of neuralgia. She died at Bryntysilio on 31 October 1898. Her body was taken to London, where, after an impressive funeral service at St Peter's, Cranley Gardens, she was buried in Brompton cemetery.<br>
<br>Helen Faucit made the most of her natural endowments: dark hair and blue-grey eyes, attractively contrasted; features lacking classic regularity but &#145;possess[ing] the whole beauty arising from powerful and changing expression&#146;; an unfashionably slender figure developing to statuesque proportions; a musical voice, strengthened by practice, whose &#145;deep intonations and flexible richness&#146; stirred the emotions  (Alison, <span class="italic">Essays</span>, 3.585). De Quincey compared her to Helen of Troy, and other enraptured admirers were equally extravagant. Such was the force of illusion at the height of her career. As a mature actress, she was termed &#145;psychological&#146;, &#145;intellectual&#146;, &#145;poetically natural&#146;. Her subtle, evocative style was a hard-won accomplishment, however. While she had originally been inclined towards uninhibited, often stormy acting, which her delicate constitution could not effectively support, she learned to reserve her power for the passionate climaxes; building towards and receding from them gradually, she gave even terrible scenes a shapely beauty. Her greatest talent was in suggesting suppressed emotion and unspoken thought by facial expression, gesture, and vocal tone; thus she gave humanity to potentially melodramatic characters and complexity to tradition-bound ones. Some critics, preferring a simpler style, accused her of self-conscious mannerism. In later years, indeed, her pictorial effects became noticeably artificial, her elucidations of &#145;inner meaning&#146; overly meticulous. At its peak, however, her acting created a sense of reality, with, at special moments, a suggestion of transcendence through poetry or art. Scholars and artists felt her attractions keenly; some acknowledged her influence on their ideas. Three decades after her professional farewell Joseph Knight called her, correctly, &#145;the greatest interpreter of the poetic drama that living memory can recall&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Her acting, though not &#145;great&#146; in the Siddons tradition (exciting by apparently superhuman power and grandeur), has probably been unexcelled in its artistic, interpretive, and emotional effectiveness.<br>
