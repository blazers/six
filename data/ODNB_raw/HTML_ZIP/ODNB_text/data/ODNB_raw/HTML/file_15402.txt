</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kennett,  White</span>  (1660&#150;1728), <span class="occ">historian and bishop of Peterborough</span>, was born in the parish of St Mary, Dover, on 10 August 1660, the eldest of the seven children of Basil Kennett (<i>d</i>. 1686) and Mary, eldest daughter of Thomas White, a wealthy shipwright. His father was a storekeeper in the dockyards at Dover, but after the Restoration he was ordained and became in 1668 vicar of Postley and in 1676 rector of Dymchurch, both in Kent.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Kennett attended local schools at Elham and at Wye, after which he was sent to Westminster School in London. On contracting smallpox he returned home and after regaining his health he spent a year tutoring the three sons of a family in Beaksbourne, Kent. He matriculated from St Edmund Hall, Oxford, on 25 June 1678. A conscientious student, Kennett was tutored by Andrew Allam and was also taught by Anthony Wood, the celebrated antiquary. At Oxford he developed a lifelong fascination with historical and antiquarian scholarship.<br>
<br>It was during the Exclusion crisis, while he was an undergraduate, that Kennett produced his first publication. <span class="italic">A Letter from a Student at Oxford to a Friend in the Country</span> appeared just before the opening of parliament in 1681. The anonymous pamphlet attacked parliament for its support of exclusion and railed against papists and puritans alike. It aroused parliament's ire to the point that the vice-chancellor was ordered to identify the offending author and punish him. Fortunately for Kennett the king quickly dissolved parliament and the matter was dropped, prompting Kennett to publish a celebratory poem in which he declared &#145;that our King's a God on earth&#146;  (Bennett, <span class="italic">White Kennett</span>, 6).<br>
<br>After graduating BA on 2 May 1682, Kennett settled on a career in the church and began to study for his master's degree in January 1684. To support himself, and to make his mark as a scholar, he translated several Latin works into English, most notably Erasmus's <span class="italic">Moriae encomium</span>, which was published as <span class="italic">Wit Against Wisdom, or, A Panegyric upon Folly</span>. On 12 October 1684 Kennett became curate and assistant schoolmaster of Bicester, Oxfordshire, where his pupils included his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15401/', "Basil Kennett")</script>. Having received his MA on 22 January 1685, he was ordained priest by Bishop John Fell in Oxford on 15 March. He was befriended by Sir William Glynne, who presented him to the vicarage of Ambrosden on 3 June 1685. Kennett carried out his clerical duties conscientiously, but it was a small parish and the workload was not taxing. Ambrosden's proximity to Oxford facilitated Kennett's continuing scholarly research. His translation of Pliny contained a dedication to Glynne which reiterated Kennett's arch-royalist views.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, James II's pro-Catholic policies alienated Kennett. Like most of the clergy in the diocese of Oxford he refused in May 1687 to sign an address to the king or to read the second declaration of indulgence in his church. The accession of William and Mary to the throne tested Kennett's loyalty. He eventually decided to take the oaths of allegiance to the new sovereigns, arguing that he could &#145;abridge&#146; his obedience to James because the king was too far away for Kennett to give him &#145;just tribute&#146;; motivated also by self-interest, he recognized that his refusal would &#145;promote my own ruine&#146;  (Bennett, <span class="italic">White Kennett</span>, 12).<h2>
<a name="Misfortuneandmarriage"></a>Misfortune and marriage</h2>The strain imposed on Kennett from these political events was compounded by personal adversity. The barrel of his gun splintered while he was out shooting in January 1689 and a piece of metal fractured his skull. He endured painful surgery and &#145;a hot and distempered brain&#146; which afflicted him for five weeks  (Bennett, <span class="italic">White Kennett</span>, 11). He had a scar on his forehead and wore a patch over it for the rest of his life. Kennett married Sarah (1674/5&#150;1694), daughter of Robert and Mary Carver of Bicester, on 6 June 1693 at Ambrosden. She died in childbirth on 2 March of the following year. Kennett was devastated and fell seriously ill for several days. He later wrote that he suffered &#145;so great weakness and decay of spirits that my Physician and my Friends expected nothing but death&#146;  (ibid., 256). Fifteen months later, on 6 June 1695, he married as his second wife Sarah Smith (<i>d</i>. 1702), the sister of Richard Smith MD, of London and Aylesbury. They had two children: White Kennett (<i>d</i>. 1740), who became rector of Burton-le-Coggles, Lincolnshire, and prebendary of Peterborough, and Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1756), who married John Newman, of Shottesbrooke, Berkshire.<h2>
<a name="Advancingcareer"></a>Advancing career</h2>In 1691 Kennett was appointed tutor and vice-principal at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, and moved back to Oxford. In the same year he was chosen as public lecturer and pro-proctor, and named as one of the city lecturers at St Martin's, Carfax; his sermon upon the death of Queen Mary was printed in 1695. In June 1694 he was presented by Francis Cherry, a nonjuring squire, to the rectory of Shottesbrooke, Berkshire, in the diocese of Salisbury; he retained the Ambrosden living. Shottesbrooke was then a haven for nonjurors, such as Henry Dodwell and, briefly, George Hickes, and Kennett found the environment strengthened his opposition to the rigid principles of the nonjurors. His political and theological thinking was moving towards a more latitudinarian stance.<br>
<br>Release from Shottesbrooke came in 1700 when Kennett was appointed curate of St Botolph, Aldgate, by the impropriator of the parish, Samuel Brewster. Kennett secured the cure only after the incumbent, Richard Hollingsworth, was ejected and lost his suit to regain his office. As priest in a large London parish, and still in possession of his two rural livings, Kennett now enjoyed a comfortable income. He sedulously carried out his duties and his sermons were much admired; he preached before the City corporation in 1705, the House of Commons in 1706, and later that year before Queen Anne.<h2>
<a name="Churchpolitics"></a>Church politics</h2>Kennett's arrival in London coincided with the convocation controversy. Francis Atterbury's <span class="italic">Letter to a Convocation Man</span> (1697) and <span class="italic">The Rights, Powers, and Privileges of an English Convocation</span> (1700) made the high-church case that the convocation of Canterbury had legislative authority in ecclesiastical affairs; thus it was not in the power of the king&#151;or of the archbishops&#151;to call or prorogue it. Atterbury's works touched off a battle of books in convocation between &#145;high-flying&#146; champions of the lower house and whiggish advocates of the episcopal upper house. The principal critics of Atterbury and his circle were William Wake, Edmund Gibson, and White Kennett. Kennett's several contributions to this debate, most notably his <span class="italic">History of the Convocation of the Prelates and Clergy of the Province of Canterbury</span> (1702), exposed the flimsy historical basis of Atterbury's arguments and, in particular, vindicated the archbishop's authority over the lower house. He contended that such authority, rather than diminishing the church's standing in society, actually enhanced it.<br>
<br>By the time convocation opened on 30 December 1701 Kennett had won the confidence of Archbishop Thomas Tenison and became his primary adviser and advocate in the lower house. He remained so in the convocations of 1702&#150;5, 1708, and 1710&#150;13. His task was to obstruct the high-church majority in the lower house and uphold the power of the bishops. Dabbling in newspaper journalism, Kennett contributed to the whig <span class="italic">Medley</span> in 1711, defending the bishops against Jonathan Swift's claim in the <span class="italic">Examiner</span> that the low-church clergy were crypto-Presbyterians out to subvert the church. The bitter divisions within convocation guaranteed that the meetings would be fruitless, and convocation was suspended in 1717.<br>
<br>Kennett's defence of the upper house won him the favour of Gilbert Burnet, bishop of Salisbury, who collated him to a prebend in the cathedral church of Salisbury in April 1701. And on 16 May Kennett was appointed archdeacon of Huntington, Lincolnshire, an office he held until 1720.<br>
<br>Following the death of his second wife in August 1702, Kennett married Dorcas Havers (<i>d</i>. 1743) in 1703. The daughter of Thomas Fuller, rector of Wellinghale, Essex, and the widow of Clopton Havers, a physician, Kennett's new wife proved to be a forceful character. Thomas Hearne's jaundiced view was that Dorcas &#145;wears the Breeches, and manages him as his Haughty, insolent Temper deserves&#146;  (Bennett, <span class="italic">White Kennett</span>, 257).<h2>
<a name="Statepolitics"></a>State politics</h2>In the ideological conflict between whigs and tories Kennett robustly defended in print and from the pulpit the ministry of Marlborough and Godolphin. On 31 January 1704, the fast day to commemorate the execution of Charles I, Kennett delivered a sermon, <span class="italic">A Compassionate Enquiry into the Causes of the Civil War</span>, which supplied historical justification for the ministry's war against France: he blamed the &#145;French Interest and Alliance&#146;, personified by Queen Henrietta Maria, for causing the civil war  (Bennett, <span class="italic">White Kennett</span>, 91). The publication of this sermon on 19 February 1704 provoked a torrent of pamphlet attacks from tory loyalists. Kennett's views of the civil war were reformulated at length in the <span class="italic">Compleat History of England</span>, published in 1706. The author's negative portrayals of the early Stuarts and his enthusiasm for the war against France ignited another round of broadsides against Kennett. On 22 November 1709, soon after the costly battle of Malplaquet, Kennett preached a sermon before Queen Anne in which he praised Marlborough's &#145;unblemishe'd and uninterrupted Honour&#146; and called to task those who &#145;could be counted to diminish and detract from his merits&#146;  (ibid., 106).<br>
<br>Eager to advance his career, Kennett cultivated the favour of whig ministers. In April 1707, angling for the deanery of Peterborough, Kennett asked Bishop William Wake to approach Lord Sunderland on his behalf. In June 1707 Kennett was made a royal chaplain at Windsor. He acquired a reputation for sycophancy, exemplified by the flattering eulogy he delivered at the funeral in Derby of William Cavendish, first duke of Devonshire and a whig grandee, whose licentiousness was notorious. This sermon prompted a new round of salvos against Kennett, most notably one by John Sharp, reader at Stepney, to which Kennett responded in <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Church and Clergy of England</span>. This anonymously published tract expressed Kennett's opposition to &#145;Popery and French Power&#146;, favoured by &#145;a Party who have been out of humour ever since the Revolution&#146;  (Bennett, <span class="italic">White Kennett</span>, 101). Kennett's loyalty to the whigs paid off when the second duke of Devonshire successfully pressed Queen Anne to nominate Kennett as dean of Peterborough, which she did on 8 January 1708.<br>
<br>Kennett was drawn into the heated controversy generated by Henry Sacheverell's infamous sermon, <span class="italic">The Perils of False Brethren, both in Church and State</span> (1709). The high-church Sacheverell identified Kennett by name as the author of the anonymously published <span class="italic">Compleat History of England</span> and cited the work to support his claim that William of Orange was not bent on resistance to James II when he landed at Torbay in 1688. Kennett retorted, in <span class="italic">A True Answer to Dr Sacheverell's Sermon</span>, that he had made no such statement. He further defended archbishops Tenison and Tillotson and Bishop Burnet against Sacheverell's aspersions.<br>
<br>The tory electoral victory in 1710 drove Kennett into further activity. His sermons and pamphlets expressed his concern to preserve the Hanoverian succession and the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span>, and to combat the nonjuring doctrines of divine right kingship and non-resistance. Assailed by George Hickes in 1711 as an immoral pluralist, political time-server, and promoter of dissent, Kennett responded with a pamphlet, and retorted that &#145;I have for many years looked upon Hereditary Succession and Passive Obedience in the rigid Notions of Dr Hickes to have no Foundation in the Christian Gospel or in the English Constitution&#146;  (Bennett, <span class="italic">White Kennett</span>, 117&#150;18).<h2>
<a name="Anembattledwhig"></a>An embattled whig</h2>Kennett was preoccupied with the issue of lay baptism throughout most of 1712. The high-church party had claimed in the previous year that baptism was valid only when it was conferred by an episcopally ordained minister. Such a position, Kennett wrote, constituted &#145;dangerous Pretensions of unchurching the Foreign Churches, and paganizing Fellow-Christians, and excluding Protestant Heirs to the Crown&#146;  (Bennett, <span class="italic">White Kennett</span>, 122). He undertook historical research to uphold the validity of lay baptism, on behalf of Archbishop Tenison, who met his bishops at Lambeth Palace, where they decided against the high-church position.<br>
<br>On 1 November 1713 Kennett preached a sermon at Windsor &#145;against Popery and Profaneness&#146;  (Bennett, <span class="italic">White Kennett</span>, 125). He warned about the danger to the protestant succession before a congregation that included&#151;besides the queen&#151;the earl of Oxford, Viscount Bolingbrooke, and Jonathan Swift. Kennett observed later that Swift &#145;drew the eyes of many upon him, when I happen'd to mention among other corruptions of the Age, the prevailing foolishness of Wit and Humour so called&#146;  (ibid., 125). Kennett's whiggish sermons did not win him any friends at court, but he never compromised his views. A pamphlet in 1713 made the case that a monarch could not name his or her own successor in defiance of parliament. It read like a cautionary warning to Queen Anne.<br>
<br>Kennett's outspokenness made him anathema to the tory high-flyers. In 1714 one of their number, Dr Richard Welton, rector of Whitechapel in London, had an altarpiece placed in his church that depicted the last supper. The painting showed Judas with a mark on his forehead and the face was clearly recognizable as that of White Kennett. People turned out in droves to admire the wicked caricature. Verses appeared lampooning the &#145;new false Brother&#146;  (Bennett, <span class="italic">White Kennett</span>, 127) and a new round of pamphlets was published, some of which contained images from the painting. Kennett was humiliated. The whig press came to his defence. The <span class="italic">Flying-Post</span> attacked Dr Welton and the <span class="italic">Daily Courant</span> offered a reward for information that could lead to the prosecution of those responsible for the altarpiece. The chancellor of the diocese viewed the painting and ordered that it be taken down.<h2>
<a name="TheHanoverianaccession"></a>The Hanoverian accession</h2>Kennett had great expectations that the accession of George I in 1714 would rapidly advance his career, and he was disappointed when no new offices or rewards came his way. He seems to have been held back by his reputation as a controversialist&#151;even though on behalf of the whigs&#151;and by his ineptness as a courtier. The death of Bishop Burnet and the resignation of the second duke of Devonshire deprived Kennett of his influential patrons. When the see of Lincoln went to Edward Gibson in 1716, instead of to Kennett, the dean's spirits sank and he described himself as &#145;a forgotten man&#146;  (Bennett, <span class="italic">White Kennett</span>, 135).<br>
<br>Nevertheless Kennett remained a vigorous publicist for a latitudinarian church and whiggish politics. In published sermons he denounced the Jacobite rising of 1715. He continued his attacks on papists and the nonjurors in controversies with Jeremy Collier and Mathias Earbury. He was also drawn into the Bangorian controversy in 1717, when he was accused, plausibly, of having toned down before publication the sermon by Benjamin Hoadly, bishop of Bangor, entitled <span class="italic">The Nature of the Kingdom or Church of Christ</span>. Kennett vigorously denied the charges in an open letter in the newspapers. He staunchly defended Hoadly against his high-church critics in convocation.<br>
<br>Kennett's opportunity for preferment finally came in 1718 when the bishop of Peterborough, Richard Cumberland, died. William Wake, the archbishop of Canterbury, commended him to the earl of Sunderland and Kennett was nominated to the see of Peterborough on 12 October 1718. Henceforth Kennett faithfully attended the House of Lords, where he became part of Sunderland's circle in that body. Kennett spoke in the Lords in support of the ministry's bill to repeal the <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity and Schism Acts</span>. He aspired to be influential at court and hoped that Peterborough would be a stepping-stone to a more prestigious bishopric. But Sunderland's political decline and his death in 1722 meant that Kennett had no entr&eacute;e to higher office. Although Kennett continued to speak out in favour of whig policies, he now spent more time on historical scholarship and on running his diocese.<h2>
<a name="Historicalworks"></a>Historical works</h2>White Kennett made a significant contribution to British historical scholarship. By the early 1690s he had joined a circle of historians at Queen's College, Oxford&#151;led by William Nicholson, and including William Wake, Edmund Gibson, and Thomas Tanner&#151;which conducted pioneering research in medieval and antiquarian studies. While at Oxford Kennett wrote <span class="italic">Parochial antiquities attempted in the history of Ambrosden, Burchester, and other adjacent parts in the counties of Oxford and Bucks</span> (1695). Tracing the land tenures in north Oxfordshire before and after the Norman conquest, Kennett showed that a new structure of landholding was imposed by William I. The book bolstered the argument of Henry Spelman, Robert Brady, and others that the Norman conquest had produced novel legal and military institutions, namely feudalism. It also discussed lay impropriations, deaneries, and papal policies. It was the first substantial parish history and was well received, but Kennett's proposal that he and his colleagues should write a general history of medieval England fell on deaf ears.<br>
<br>The convocation disputes, based on appeals to history, further propelled Kennett's research. <span class="italic">The Case of Impropriations</span> (1704) examined the history of lay impropriations. In 1706 Kennett's massive <span class="italic">Compleat History of England</span> (3 vols.) was published anonymously. The <span class="italic">Compleat History</span> answered William Temple's call in 1695 for a general history of England from ancient times to the present. It was among the most ambitious and expensive publishing ventures up to that time. Thirteen booksellers collaborated on its publication and requests for subscriptions were sent throughout the provinces. Kennett was paid &pound;150 for the work, which was edited, probably, by John Hughes. The first two volumes consisted of old chronicles; the third offered a narrative of the period from the reign of Charles I to that of William III.<br>
<br>Kennett wrote his <span class="italic">History</span> in part to refute the tory view of the English revolution and Restoration. The work chronicled the perils of &#145;popery&#146;, especially the arbitrary power that, Kennett argued, always attended it. Kennett made extensive use of Clarendon's recently published <span class="italic">History of the Rebellion</span> and wanted to show that &#145;the noble historian&#146; could not be appropriated by the tories  (Okie, 28). Although Kennett upbraided Charles I for his laxity towards Catholics and Catholic powers, it is only with the Restoration that the work took on a consistently whiggish tone. Kennett painted a very unflattering picture of Charles II, wrote favourably of the <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span>, and authenticated the Popish Plot. He argued that the revolution of 1688 was based on &#145;Church of England principles&#146; in the face of the popish threat posed by James II  (ibid., 29).<br>
<br>Kennett's narrative was embedded in copious documentation. Most of the work consists of state documents, memoirs, histories, newsletters, trials, and so forth, threaded together with the author's level-headed narrative. It broke no new ground and displayed a rather static concept of history, but was notable for its scholarship and its relatively impartial tone, notwithstanding Kennett's whiggish interpretation.<br>
<br>Kennett's <span class="italic">Compleat History</span> was generally well received, going through four reprints, and a new edition in 1719. Inevitably it provoked hostile reactions from tory writers. As late as 1740 a 700-page critique, <span class="italic">The Examen</span>, by Roger North, was published to discredit Kennett's &#145;pretended Complete history&#146;  (Okie, 31).<br>
<br>Kennett's final work, <span class="italic">A Register and Chronicle Ecclesiastical and Civil</span> (1726), was a massive collection of English historical documents which covered the years 1660 to 1662. Kennett intended it as an example of the kind of documentary record which could be continued by future scholars with government support.<h2>
<a name="Churchman"></a>Churchman</h2>Despite the many hours Kennett devoted to historical and political writing, he did not neglect his considerable pastoral duties. As chaplain at St Botolph, Aldgate, he preached twice every Sunday, visited the sick, and officiated at numerous marriages, baptisms, and funerals. When a less burdensome living at the combined rectory of St Mary Aldermary and St Thomas the Apostle in the City presented itself in 1708, Kennett accepted it.<br>
<br>Kennett was a latitudinarian churchman who encouraged greater toleration of dissenting protestants. Although devout, he was more interested in winning souls and in church administration than he was in theology. He was also one of those churchmen who feared that irreligion, immorality, and lawlessness were on the rise. Hence he became a leader of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK) and the Society for the Reformation of Manners. He joined the SPCK in 1700 and for several years thereafter attended meetings every week. He was most active during the latter years of Queen Anne's reign in nourishing relations between the SPCK and similar organizations on the continent. He did much to promote charitable giving for the Palatinate refugees in 1709 and to defend their cause. The SPCK's project that elicited Kennett's most ardent support was the charity school movement. He promoted the growth of charity schools in Aldgate and wrote a pamphlet for the students there, <span class="italic">The Christian Scholar</span> (1708), that was adopted by the society for schools elsewhere; it reached its twentieth edition in 1811. Kennett's anti-Catholic views can be seen here as well: &#145;Every Charity-School is as it were a Fortress and a Frontier Garrison against Popery&#146;  (Bennett, <span class="italic">White Kennett</span>, 190).<br>
<br>Kennett was in 1701 among the first members of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts and of its governing standing committee. His book <span class="italic">An Account of the Society for Propagating the Gospel in Foreign Parts</span> (1706) related the early history of the society and argued that the American colonies should have a suffragan bishop. He attended meetings of the society regularly even after becoming a bishop, occasionally serving as its vice-president.<br>
<br>As archdeacon of Huntington, Lincolnshire, from 1701 to 1720, and dean of Peterborough from 1708 to 1718, Kennett was a highly conscientious and meticulous administrator. He took it as his mandate to further the &#145;Apostolical Cause of having All Things done decently and in order&#146;  (Bennett, <span class="italic">White Kennett</span>, 196). He upbraided clergy for their slovenly appearance, closely monitored the financial accounts of his archdeaconry and cathedral, hectored churchwardens to keep their churches in good repair, laid down a code of conduct for all employees of the cathedral church, and imposed fines on those who breached regulations.<br>
<br>Kennett brought his passion for order and discipline to the see of Peterborough, which had been neglected by his predecessor. He complained in 1723 that the clergy of the cathedral church were &#145;most idle&#146; and that the buildings were in disrepair  (Bennett, <span class="italic">White Kennett</span>, 235). He took it upon himself to see that the cathedral prebends performed their duties faithfully. He had to deal with insubordination by the new dean, Richard Reynolds, and misconduct by the registrar, Thomas Cumberland, whom he dismissed. He undertook three episcopal visitations and several additional tours to confirm lay people. He presided over forty-four ordinations&#151;a higher rate than most bishops&#151;and made every effort to select qualified priests.<br>
<br>Kennett's indefatigable devotion to the church testifies to his boundless energy and to his strong sense of moral purpose. He had firm convictions and harboured few doubts about his personal worth. He was outspoken, combative, and tactless&#151;traits that hindered his career. But he was also empathetic, generous, and not without charm; he had close, lasting friendships, and good working relationships with colleagues and associates.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsanddeath"></a>Final years and death</h2>Personal troubles clouded Kennett's last years. He felt pained and humiliated when he found out that his daughter, Sarah, had formed a relationship with his coachman, John Newman. She became pregnant, and in December 1721 clandestinely married Newman. The marriage lasted, and father and daughter were eventually reconciled. Kennett's will designated that she receive half of his money.<br>
<br>Having been unwell for months, White Kennett died on 19 December 1728 of an undisclosed illness at his St James Street town house in Westminster. He was survived by his wife, who died on 9 July 1743. He was buried behind the high altar at the cathedral in Peterborough, where a marble monument was erected in his honour. He bequeathed over 1500 books printed before 1641 to the Peterborough Cathedral Library; they are now on deposit at Cambridge University Library.<br>
