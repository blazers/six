</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bates, Sir  Percy Elly</span>, fourth baronet  (1879&#150;1946), <span class="occ">merchant and shipowner</span>, was born at Beechenhurst, Wavertree, Liverpool, on 12 May 1879, the second of seven sons of Edward Percy Bates (1845&#150;1899), who became second baronet, and his wife, Constance Elisabeth, daughter of Samuel Robert Graves, a former mayor of and member of parliament for Liverpool.<br>
<br>Educated at Winchester College (1892&#150;7), Bates then studied in Germany for a year. Apprenticeship with William Johnston &amp; Co., shipowners, of Liverpool followed, but after his father's death Bates joined the family business of Edward Bates &amp; Sons, merchants and shipowners, long established in Liverpool and India. In 1903 he succeeded his brother in the baronetcy and in 1910 began his connection with the Cunard Steam-Ship Company of which he became deputy chairman in 1922. In 1924 Bates became a director of the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, then in 1930 chairman. He held that position until the sale of the paper in 1937, and became a friend of fellow director, Rudyard Kipling, whom he greatly admired and often quoted.<br>
<br>In the First World War, Bates joined the transport department of the Admiralty. When the Ministry of Shipping was created, he continued as director of commercial services, being concerned with the shipment of civilian supplies to Britain and her allies. In recognition of his war service Bates was appointed GBE in 1920. Nevertheless, he, in general, disliked government interference in commerce. During the Second World War he was a member both of the advisory council and of the liner committee of the Ministry of War Transport.<br>
<br>In 1930 Bates became chairman of Cunard in succession to Sir Thomas Royden. He and his predecessor had together masterminded a scheme to provide a weekly transatlantic passenger service using two large, fast modern liners instead of the current three vessels. Before the end of 1930 Cunard had placed the order for the first of the &#145;big ships&#146; with shipbuilders John Brown at Clydebank where the new vessel was given the yard number 534. The year 1930 also witnessed the collapse of the Royal Mail group, one of the biggest British shipping groups, and Cunard put in a bid for the transatlantic White Star Line which was one of the group's companies. The initial bid by Bates was unsuccessful, but attempts to obtain White Star were to become closely linked to the fortunes of the &#145;big ships&#146; project over the next few years.<br>
<br>The economic crisis of 1931 forced Cunard to suspend construction of no. 534 at the end of that year. Bates now sought government financial support to complete the &#145;big ships&#146; project. The government was unenthusiastic, but suggested assistance might be available if Cunard merged with White Star on terms acceptable to the creditors of the latter company. Bates still wanted White Star, but intended to absorb it rather than agree to a merger. Eventually the government decided to provide financial support, confirmed by the <span class="roman">North Atlantic Shipping Act</span> of 1934, and Bates accepted a merger with White Star. The new Cunard-White Star company was formed in 1934 with Bates as chairman.<br>
<br>Work recommenced on no. 534 in 1934 and the ship was launched later in the year as the <i>Queen Mary</i>, entering transatlantic service in 1936. The second &#145;big ship&#146;, the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>, was launched by John Brown in 1938, but did not enter commercial service before the outbreak of the Second World War.<br>
<br>Although deeply committed to the &#145;big ships&#146; project, Bates was not unaware of the beginnings of transatlantic air travel during the 1930s. He mistakenly believed that the aeroplane would not compete with the ocean liner, but would cater for a small and select passenger market. Between 1934 and his death, Bates made various efforts, all unsuccessful, to obtain a share for Cunard in transatlantic air travel.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, the two <i>Queens</i> served as troopships, initially east of Suez from 1940 to 1942, then on the north Atlantic run from 1942 to 1944. On the latter service they brought across many of the American troops who took part in the Normandy landings in 1944. Bates took great pride in the work of these ships and liked to believe that they shortened the war in Europe by a whole year. These great ships had unexpected ends: the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> was destroyed by fire in Hong Kong harbour in 1971 while being converted into a floating university; the <i>Queen Mary</i> became a floating museum, berthed at Long Beach, California, from 1967.<br>
<br>Bates was terse in speech and judgement: he never encumbered his talk with platitudes, or troubled to obscure the directness of his thought. Such characteristics, allied with a determined jaw, and, on occasion, an emphatic manner, made him formidable to those who did not know him well. However, he was always scrupulous in the use of power, ready for interchange of ideas and considerate and sensitive in personal relationships. He regarded himself as fortunate in having a group of brothers and other colleagues who looked to him for leadership and on whose support he relied. During his career he gave due time to those offices which fall to a leading shipowner; he was a member of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board (1908&#150;10), chairman of the Liverpool Steamship Owners' Association (1911, 1945), president of the Institute of Marine Engineers (1939), and chairman of the General Council of British Shipping (1945). He was also high sheriff of Cheshire (1920&#150;21), and a justice of the peace for the county.<br>
<br>On 20 June 1907 Bates married Mary Ann (1880&#150;1973), daughter of William Lefroy, dean of Norwich. They had one son, Edward Percy, a pilot officer in the Royal Air Force whose death in action over Germany in 1945, borne by his father with outward stoicism, was a deep wound. He found relaxation in golf and shooting, was enthusiastic about curling, and was a keen fisherman. Annual fishing trips to Ireland, Scotland, and Scandinavia were occasions when Bates and his brothers could all get together.<br>
<br>Having presided as host on a short preliminary run of the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>, Bates suffered a heart attack at his office in Liverpool on 14 October 1946. He died at his home, Hinderton Hall, Neston, Wirral, Cheshire, on 16 October 1946, on the very morning when he should have sailed on the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>'s first voyage as an Atlantic passenger ship. He was buried at Childwall church, Wavertree, Liverpool, and was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Bates was succeeded as chairman of the Cunard Steam-Ship Company and Cunard-White Star by two younger brothers, first Frederic Alan Bates (1884&#150;1957) and then Colonel Denis Haughton Bates (1886&#150;1959). Born on 25 August 1886, the latter served with the duke of Lancaster's own yeomanry during the First World War and was mentioned in dispatches. On 12 December 1922 he married Aline Mary Crook (<i>d</i>. 1974), daughter of Edward Tipping Crook of Woodlands Hall, Bridgnorth; they had a son and a daughter. He died on 13 September 1959. His only son, <a name="cosubject_73849"></a><span class="headword">Philip Edward Bates</span>  (1925&#150;2000), <span class="occ">shipping executive</span>, was born on 19 July 1925 and educated at Shrewsbury School. In 1943 he was commissioned into the Royal Marines and began service with the 3rd commando brigade in the Far East. He was demobilized in 1946 but continued to serve in the Royal Marine Forces Volunteer Reserve, and was commanding officer of its Merseyside unit. Having joined the freight shipping line T. &amp; J. Brocklebank, part of the Cunard group, he became a director in 1952, managing director in 1959, and deputy chairman in 1962. He was made a member of Cunard's board in 1957, and in 1965 became managing director of Cunard Line, presiding over the shift of Cunard's management base from Liverpool to Southampton. Though he had been closely involved from the beginning in the decision to build the <i>Queen Elizabeth II</i> (popularly known as <i>QE2</i>), his main interest remained in freight transportation. In 1968 he negotiated Cunard's entry into Atlantic Container Line, a freight-shipping consortium formed by Swedish, Dutch, and French companies in 1965 which was prominent in the growing container trade. He was seconded by Cunard as temporary chairman of the consortium later in 1968, but remained as chairman until his retirement in 1983. He had married, on 22 April 1952, Mary Patricia Carol Moberly Bell, an assistant purser on the <i>Queen Mary</i>, and younger daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Clive Vincent Moberly Bell, army officer; they had two sons and two daughters. He died on 29 February 2000. His wife survived him.<br>
