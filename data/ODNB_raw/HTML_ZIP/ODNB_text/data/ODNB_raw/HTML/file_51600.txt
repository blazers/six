<span class="headword">Leachman,  Gerard Evelyn</span>  (1880&#150;1920), <span class="occ">army officer and traveller</span>, was born in Petersfield, Hampshire, on 27 July 1880. Known to his friends as Gerald, he was the sixth child and only surviving son of Dr Albert Leachman, a medical practitioner, and his wife, Louise Caroline Singer. After four years at Charterhouse School (1893&#150;7) he attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, passing out in the summer of 1899. He embarked for service in the South African War early in 1900 as a second lieutenant in the 1st battalion of the Royal Sussex regiment, and after two years' service in South Africa he was posted to India.<br>
<br>Leachman's first postings in India were near the border with Nepal, and in June 1905 he made a daring (and unauthorized) journey into Tibet for several weeks, the first of many adventurous travels into the mountains and deserts of Kashmir, Persia, Iraq, and Turkey. Early in 1907 he left India for leave in England, travelling from Bombay to Muscat, up the gulf to Basrah, on by paddle steamer to Baghdad and Abu Kemal, and then by land to Aleppo.<br>
<br>On his return to India Leachman was assigned to military intelligence in Simla. The Anglo-Russian convention of August 1907, setting out spheres of influence in Afghanistan and Persia, effectively marked the end of the &#145;great game&#146;, the struggle between Russia and Britain for influence over central Asia which had lasted for most of the nineteenth century. Russia had extended its borders and indirect influence hundreds of miles south, in a seemingly inexorable advance towards British India. By 1907 it had become clear to Britain, Russia, and France that a more imminent threat was the growing naval power and imperial ambition of Germany.<br>
<br>In the early twentieth century the intelligence agencies of Britain and Germany were attempting to establish footholds within the Ottoman empire (and, to a lesser extent, in Persia), by such apparently innocent means as archaeology, mapping, exploration, the telegraph, and commercial activity, since&#151;apart from Britain's unequal treaties with the gulf sheikhdoms and her occupation of Egypt&#151;more direct forms of colonial rule could not be employed. In Simla, Leachman learned Arabic and German and studied intelligence reports from Arabia. He arrived in southern Iraq late in 1909 to begin his career in the field, one of a cohort of colourful contemporaries including Douglas Carruthers, T. E. Lawrence, Alois Musil, S. F. Newcombe, Conrad Preusser, Barclay Raunkiaer, William Shakespear, E. B. Soane, and Wilhelm Wassmuss.<br>
<br>Like many of them Leachman took to wearing Arab dress. In 1910 he undertook a journey into the desert south of Baghdad, apparently in an effort to persuade the Rashids of Ha&#146;il not to attack Ibn Sa&#145;ud. In March 1911 the Royal Geographical Society awarded him its Gill memorial medal for his account of these travels (published in the <span class="italic">Geographical Journal</span>, 38, 1911, 265&#150;74), and also offered to fund a modest expedition to central Arabia. He set off from Damascus at the end of 1912, probably with the connivance of &#145;Abd al-&#145;Aziz ibn Sa&#145;ud (who was anxious to secure British protection against the Rashids, and subsequently, recognition of his independence <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the Ottomans), visiting Qasim and Riyadh and bringing back the first photographs of members of the Sa&#145;udi royal family.<br>
<br>Early in March 1915 Leachman was posted to Basrah to work among the tribes of southern Iraq as the Mesopotamia campaign moved northwards to Baghdad, competing for their allegiance with the German archaeologist Preusser on the Ottoman side. What appeared to be an unopposed advance was firmly halted at Kut, where the Indian expeditionary force was besieged by fresh Ottoman troops. In an act of extraordinary heroism Leachman entered the city and enabled some 5000 troops to escape in the first days of December 1915, before the Turkish troops were fully organized.<br>
<br>At the same time as the defeated army of Kut was being marched to prison camps in Turkey, the Arab revolt was beginning on the west of the Arabian peninsula. Once Baghdad had been captured in March 1917, and the situation had become more stable, it was important that someone from Mesopotamia should be sent to Cairo to be briefed on London's plans for the post-war Arab world. The authorities in Iraq had not been informed either of the Sykes&#150;Picot agreement or of the McMahon&#150;Husayn correspondence. Leachman, who shared his Mesopotamian superiors' mistrust of the Arab revolt, went first to Cairo and then to Hejaz, where he met Faysal and T. E. Lawrence at Wajh in May. Captain Bray has described the meeting, with Lawrence in sumptuous Arab clothing, and Leachman in his army khakis: Faysal's aristocratic charm, Leachman's straightforwardness, Lawrence's condescending superiority.<br>
<br>On his return to Mesopotamia in 1917 Leachman, gazetted brevet lieutenant-colonel, was posted to the Shi&#145;i shrine city of Karbala&#146;. Two of his contemporaries, Captain I. Chalmers and Edmund Candler, described him in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> and <span class="italic">The Long Road to Baghdad</span> (1919) as &#145;O.C. (Officer Commanding) Desert&#146;; this description, which was later used in the title of a biography, referred to his &#145;parish&#146; of some 20,000 square miles. He was awarded the DSO in November 1918.<br>
<br>In April 1920 the treaty of San Remo awarded the Middle Eastern mandates to Britain and France. Arnold Wilson, together with many of his colleagues in the Mesopotamia administration, was unable to accept even the limited independence that this implied. Pent-up nationalist feelings, nourished partly by British support of the Hashemites over the previous years and partly by Shi&#145;a seeking independence, combined to cause a major insurrection in Iraq in June 1920. Leachman, whom Wilson had asked to return to Iraq early in 1920, was killed in the course of the revolt, at Khan Nuqta near Baghdad on 12 August 1920, by Khamis, son of Dhari al-Mahmud of the Zuba&#146; tribe. Leachman's body was subsequently reinterred at the British cemetery in Baghdad on 1 March 1921. He never married.<br>
<br>Along with many of his contemporaries Leachman was largely unsympathetic towards aspirations for Arab independence (both from Ottoman rule and more generally) which were gathering momentum before and during the First World War. He was imbued with many of the stock attitudes of his generation towards &#145;inferior peoples&#146; though he evidently respected many individual Arabs with whom he came into contact. Upright, cantankerous, and ascetic, he was a courageous and devoted servant of empire.<br>
