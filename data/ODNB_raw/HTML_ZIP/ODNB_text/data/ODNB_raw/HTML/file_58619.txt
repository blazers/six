<span class="headword">Molony,  Helena Mary</span>  (1883&#150;1967), <span class="occ">actress and Irish nationalist</span>, was born at 8 Coles Lane, Dublin, on 15 January 1883, the daughter of Michael Molony, a grocer, and his wife, Catherine McGrath. The family were Catholic, and Helena was educated locally. She first became involved in the Irish nationalist movement at the age of nineteen. After attending a public meeting at the Custom House in Dublin at which Maud Gonne spoke, she joined Inghinidhe na hEireann (daughters of Ireland), founded by Gonne and others in 1900 to mobilize women nationalists who were barred from membership of men's political organizations. In 1908 Molony co-founded and assumed the editorship of <span class="italic">Bean na hEireann</span> (&#145;Women of Ireland&#146;), a radical journal which advocated militancy, separatism, and feminism. She wrote much of the journal herself, although it attracted support from established writers such as Katherine Tynan and James Stephens, and public figures including Roger Casement, Arthur Griffith, and Constance Markievicz. <span class="italic">Bean</span> also became a vehicle for Molony's socialist beliefs, and she wrote the labour notes for the journal under the pseudonym A Worker. Molony's support for the labour cause, and her belief in the right of workers to organize, had a significant influence upon the political development of Constance Markievicz, and the two were to work together on a range of political movements.<br>
<br>From 1909 Molony trained under Dudley Digges as an actress in the Abbey Theatre, and she played there regularly until 1913. Her political development continued apace, and in 1911 she was arrested as a result of her protest at the visit of George V to Dublin, in the course of which she had broken a window containing images of the royal party. After her release she was again imprisoned for a seditious speech, but was bailed out by Anna Parnell, sister of Charles Stewart, who wished her to edit her (Parnell's) scathing account of the Land League years.<br>
<br>Between 1909 and 1916 Molony worked closely with James Connolly, the trades union organizer. Molony believed that nationalism and democracy were inextricably linked, a position to which Connolly was eventually to move. In 1913 she was active in the support of those workers taking part in the Dublin lock-out for the right to join trade unions, and she was subsequently asked by Connolly to assist in the organization of women workers, becoming the secretary of the Irish Women Workers' Union (IWWU) in 1915. Her journalistic experience made her an obvious choice as co-worker on Connolly's <span class="italic">Worker's Republic</span>, although Connolly's request that she be registered as the proprietor made her personally responsible, under the <span class="roman">Defence of the Realm Act</span>, for anything published in it. She was one of the founder members of the Irish Citizen Army, the militant workers' group in which women enjoyed equal membership, and fought with them in the 1916 Easter rising. After the surrender of the City Hall garrison, of which she was a part, she was deported to England, one of only six women to be interned. She returned to Dublin in December 1916, and immediately resumed her political work. She joined Cumann na mBan (Society of Women), despite some reservations about its commitment to radical labour and feminist politics, and played a key role in the organization's opposition to the treaty settlement of 1921.<br>
<br>After the civil war of 1922&#150;3 Molony devoted herself full time to the labour cause, having become honorary president of the IWWU in 1917, while still retaining an active role in nationalist politics. In the 1920s and 1930s she opposed attempts to restrict women workers' rights. She fought against the <span class="roman">Conditions of Employment Bill</span> of 1935, which sought to limit female industrial workers, as well as the 1937 constitution which implied, through articles 41 and 45, that women should have a restricted public role.<br>
<br>Although Molony continued to actively pursue workers' rights in the inter-war years, serving as president of the Congress of Trade Unions until 1945, she suffered from increasing ill health, and was forced to limit her activities after 1946. She never married, and faced increasing financial hardship in her later years, receiving a pension from the IWWU only after a long struggle. She died at Lungamore, Strand Road, Sutton, Dublin, on 29 January 1967. She was buried in the republican plot, Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin, on 31 January.<br>
