<span class="headword">Carte,  Helen</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Susan Helen  Couper Black]</span>  (1852&#150;1913), <span class="occ">businesswoman and theatre manager</span>, was born on 12 May 1852, at Wigtown, Scotland, the second daughter of George Couper (or Cowper) Black (1820&#150;<i>c</i>.1874), procurator fiscal, and his wife, Ellen Barham (1823&#150;1875?). Originally christened Susan Helen, she early reversed her names and later changed &#145;Black&#146; to &#145;Lenoir&#146;, the original surname of the Black family in seventeenth-century France.<br>
<br>Between 1871 and 1874 Helen Black passed with honours the examinations in mathematics, logic, and moral philosophy at the University of London, for which she was privately tutored since the university did not admit women to courses or degrees. When, around this time, her widowed mother emigrated to Australia, Helen stayed behind, first briefly as a teacher, then as an actress&#151;a strange choice for a woman as essentially shy and private as she. Nevertheless by 1877 as Helen Lenoir she had appeared at Dublin and Glasgow in <span class="italic">The Great Divorce Case</span>, and had been engaged to play in India. This engagement, however, was formally broken so that she could join <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32311/', "Richard D'Oyly Carte's")</script> theatrical organization at the Opera Comique.<br>
<br>As Carte's secretary, Helen soon proved indispensable. She was a &#145;workaholic&#146;, enjoying minutiae, even drudgery, as well as larger details of successively mounting operas by W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan, of building the Savoy Theatre and the Savoy Hotel, into which she introduced the new hydraulic passenger lifts. She also assisted Carte in arranging American lecture tours for Oscar Wilde, Matthew Arnold (who called her Carte's &#145;American brain&#146;), and others. As Carte's business associate, she frequently crossed the Atlantic to superintend American productions and tours of what became known as Gilbert and Sullivan's Savoy Operas. In 1886 Carte raised Helen's salary to &pound;1000 a year with an additional 10 per cent on net profits. When she demurred, he wrote, &#145;You know very well, and so do all those who know anything about my affairs, that I could not have done the business at all, at any rate on nothing like the same scale, without you&#146;  (D'Oyly Carte MSS). Eighteen months later on 12 April 1888 she became his second wife, Sir Arthur Sullivan acting as his best man.<br>
<br>As the editor of <span class="italic">The Era</span> wrote in Helen Carte's obituary, &#145;She never took advantage of anybody; but I never heard of her letting anybody take advantage of her&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Era</span>). Yet she was very tactful, maintaining a more or less even balance among the often conflicting temperaments of Gilbert, Sullivan, and Carte; dealing sympathetically with problems, personal and professional, of the D'Oyly Carte London and touring companies; always emending her typewritten letters by hand to show she had read them herself.<br>
<br>In person Mrs Carte was small and slim, but very energetic. A dog lover, she was also so generous to humans that King George V conferred on her the order of the League of Mercy in 1912. James McNeill Whistler, one of her friends, did an etching of her and told her she was delightful. He himself mixed the paint for the Cartes' Adelphi Terrace flat, including his favourite yellow.<br>
<br>During Carte's last, invalid years, Helen Carte oversaw every detail of their far-flung organization. Lonely after his death in 1901, she married Stanley Carr Boulter, a barrister, in 1902, but continued to use the name Carte for all her business dealings. Contemporary newspapers describe her on opening night of the 1906 revival of <span class="italic">The Yeomen of the Guard</span>, when she and Gilbert took three curtain calls: dressed in white, carrying white flowers, she peeped out shyly and trembled visibly at a &#145;hurricane&#146; of applause. Illness prevented her from attending the last night of the 1909 Gilbert and Sullivan revivals, and she then gave up the management of the Savoy Theatre.<br>
<br>After another illness lasting several months, Helen Carte died in London on 5 May 1913 of cerebral haemorrhage complicated by acute bronchitis. At her wish, her funeral at Golders Green crematorium on 7 May was private. She was perhaps the foremost businesswoman of her era.<br>
