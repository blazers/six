<span class="headword">Parker,  Frederick Moore Searle <span class="st"> [Eric]</span></span>  (1870&#150;1955), <span class="occ">author and journalist</span>, was born at The Grange, East Barnet, Hertfordshire, on 9 October 1870, the eldest son of Frederick Searle Parker, a solicitor of Bedford Row, and his wife, Elisabeth, daughter of William Wilkieson, of Woodbury Hall, Bedfordshire. As a King's scholar at Eton College, fishing was already his passion and, with no encouragement, he was a keen naturalist. He went as a postmaster to Merton College, Oxford, where he obtained a second class in classical moderations (1891) and a fourth in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1893). Then came a few years of schoolmastering until in 1900, at the age of thirty, he entered journalism as a junior assistant editor on the <span class="italic">St James's Gazette</span>, under Theodore Cook. He soon started to write also for St Loe Strachey in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, to which he was a regular contributor for twelve years. In 1902 Strachey bought the <span class="italic">County Gentleman</span>, a sporting weekly devoted mainly to horses, and, with Parker as editor, set about widening its appeal.<br>
<br>Meanwhile <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span> had serialized Parker's first novel, <span class="italic">The Sinner and the Problem</span>, published as a book in October 1901 and twice reprinted within three months. Parker married in 1902 Ruth Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1933), daughter of Ludwig Messel, of Nymans, Handcross, Sussex. They had four sons, two of whom were killed in the Second World War, and two daughters.<br>
<br>When Strachey's ownership and his editorship of the <span class="italic">County Gentleman</span> came to an end in 1907, Parker devoted himself with his customary thoroughness to the Surrey volume (1908) in Macmillan's <span class="roman">Highways and Byways</span> series, exploring on foot every nook and cranny of the county where much of his life was to be spent; few came to know it better or loved it more. For two years (1908&#150;10) he edited the monthly <span class="italic">Gamekeeper</span>; it was then, in <span class="italic">A Book of the Zoo</span> (1909), that he foresaw that the grey squirrel might &#145;become a country problem&#146;, a couple of decades before it was officially recognized as such. In 1910 Parker was in the running for the post of editor-in-chief of <span class="italic">The Field</span>; but the trustees regarded him as &#145;too much of a poet&#146; and appointed the same Theodore Cook with whom he had started his journalistic career. Cook invited Parker to help him and a year later appointed him shooting editor, a post he was to fill with distinction for over twenty years (1911&#150;32). At this time he was writing regularly for <span class="italic">The Field</span>, <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, and <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, but he found time to finish a novel of child life, <span class="italic">Promise of Arden</span> (1912), to prepare with William Hyde <span class="italic">A West Surrey Sketch-Book</span> (1913), and to undertake at the request of Reginald J. Smith a book of reminiscences, <span class="italic">Eton in the 'Eighties</span> (1914).<br>
<br>In November 1914 Parker was gazetted to a captaincy in the 5th battalion of the Queen's Royal West Surrey regiment, in which he served until June 1918, when he was attached to the intelligence department at the War Office. During the war years, which he spent in England, he wrote <span class="italic">Shooting Days</span> (1918) and began <span class="italic">Playing Fields</span> (1922), the story of life at a preparatory school and at Eton as seen through the eyes of a schoolboy; it has been described as the best school story ever written. Between the wars not a year passed without the appearance of at least one book written, compiled, or edited by him. A selection of titles indicates their range: <span class="italic">Elements of Shooting</span> (1924), <span class="italic">Between the Wickets</span> (1926), <span class="italic">Field, River and Hill</span> (1927), <span class="italic">English Wild Life</span> (1929), <span class="italic">Ethics of Egg-Collecting</span> (1935), <span class="italic">The Gardener's England</span> (1936), and the autobiographical <span class="italic">Memory Looks Forward</span> (1937).<br>
<br>In 1927 Parker gave the first in what became a series of talks to schools for the BBC. In the following year he became editor of the <span class="roman">Lonsdale Library of Sports, Games and Pastimes</span>. Then, in December 1929, came Sir Leicester Harmsworth's offer of the post of editor-in-chief of <span class="italic">The Field</span>. In the eight years that followed Parker put new life into the weekly, widening its interest and appeal. His most noteworthy achievement was the devastating exposure of the trapping and caging of linnets, goldfinches, and other small birds, which was largely responsible for the passage of the <span class="roman">Protection of Birds Act</span>, 1933. Parker also gave a talk on the subject for the BBC. The broadcasting of &#145;Birds in Paper Bags&#146; did much to alert public opinion to the cruel conditions in which wild birds were kept and sold at London markets. He also campaigned in <span class="italic">The Field</span> against the docking of horses, which was later made illegal. At the end of 1937 Parker gave up his post with the journal so that he might have more time for writing and broadcasting, and accepted a seat on the board. His literary output was maintained, although with less emphasis on field sports and more on cricket, dogs, natural history, and gardens. He contributed the volume on Surrey (1947) to Hale's <span class="roman">County Books</span> series and added to the <span class="roman">Lonsdale Library</span> <span class="italic">The History of Cricket</span> (1950). The last of his fifty-odd books, <span class="italic">Surrey Gardens</span> (1954), was published shortly before his death at his home, Feathercombe, Hambledon, Surrey, on 13 February 1955.<br>
<br>In his bearing, talk, kindness, honesty of mind and purpose, outlook on life, and general character Parker was outstandingly an English country gentleman. He had a fund of humour, was a keen observer, and wrote with ease and sureness. He enabled readers to see about them things which they had not noticed before, and shared with them delightfully his appreciation of beauty in the countryside.<br>
