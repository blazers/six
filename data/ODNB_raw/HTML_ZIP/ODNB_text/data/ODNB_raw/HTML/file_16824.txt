<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Charles Dalton Clifford</span>  (1844&#150;1891), <span class="occ">magistrate and diplomatist</span>, was born in Portsmouth on 13 January 1844, the eldest son of Colonel Robert Clifford Lloyd (1809&#150;1863) of the 68th Durham light infantry, and his wife, Annie Savage (<i>d</i>. 1908). Both his grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16817/', "Bartholomew Lloyd")</script>, and his uncle, Humphrey Lloyd, had been provosts of Trinity College, Dublin.<br>
<br>Lloyd was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst and, in 1862, entered the police force in British Burma, where he rose through the ranks as assistant, deputy commissioner, and finally inspector-general of registration. On 30 April 1867 he married Isabel Henrietta Browne; they returned to Britain in 1872. On 3 July 1872 he entered Lincoln's Inn, London, and on 16 February 1874 he was appointed resident magistrate for co. Down, in Ireland. He was called to the bar in Trinity term, 1875.<br>
<br>The battle conducted by the Land League on behalf of tenant farmers against rack rents and extortion by landlords resulted in non-payment of rent, riots, and agrarian crime throughout the country. W. E. Forster (then Irish secretary) quickly moved Lloyd from co. Down to the south of the country. Lloyd managed to restore order during riots in Longford and was seen by his supporters as having displayed energy and discretion in his role. His detractors, however, saw him as being &#145;cruel and despotic&#146;  (Townshend, 138&#150;40).<br>
<br>Lloyd began a campaign to break the resistance of tenants to payment of rent in the counties of Cork and Limerick. This he did by extending both his powers and those of the Royal Irish Constabulary, ostensibly within the bounds of the ordinary law. He was a staunch unionist and favoured the decentralization of the Irish administrative system. He was opposed to the use of emergency measures since he felt these would undermine the authority of the union. He therefore extended the interpretation of the <span class="roman">Riot Act</span> so far that people could be arrested on the merest suspicion of criminality. On 20 May 1881, amid mass hysteria, he arrested Father Sheehy and other members of the league under the <span class="roman">Protection of Person and Property Act</span>.<br>
<br>Ireland under Forster was divided into five regions, each governed by a special resident magistrate with executive powers. With such executive freedom Lloyd was able to request an increase in the number of troops in Ireland, until by the end of 1881 they numbered over 25,000. He also gradually infused the Royal Irish Constabulary with a military element until by the end of the same year it was composed almost entirely of military personnel, with officers sent from divisional police headquarters to avoid using local forces. He organized an extensive patrolling network, involving &#145;flying columns&#146;, and so intensified security arrangements that they became tantamount to martial law. As a result, over sixteen parliamentary questions were lodged about Lloyd's conduct in 1881&#150;2. Allegations were made to the effect that he refused to accept bail, dispensed summary justice in his own house, and dispersed crowds under the <span class="roman">Riot Act</span> with threats that they would be shot. In 1883 he eventually resigned and moved to Egypt, where he was to serve under the khedive as inspector-general of reforms and, subsequently, as under-secretary at the Home Office.<br>
<br>In Egypt Lloyd's career was again tainted by controversy. He threw himself with zeal into sanitation schemes and judicial reform. However, in his attempted reform of the prison system he met with much resistance from the mudirs, members of the Egyptian ruling class who occupied much the same position as special resident magistrates did in Ireland. Under the existing judicial system an individual could be arrested and convicted without even a written order. Prisons were overcrowded and bribes, torture, false imprisonment, and false convictions were rife.<br>
<br>Lloyd set about reforming the police force so that it would be answerable to local authorities but could also report to central government. No arrest could be made without a written order. Those who opposed reform were removed from office and replaced by Egyptians from the central administration. The reforms had initial support from Sir Evelyn Baring, but eventually the Egyptian minister Nubar Pasha threatened to resign on the grounds that the proposed reforms deprived the mudirs of all authority and gave their executive powers to the police. There were also allegations that torture in prisons had not been completely eradicated. Despite Lloyd's best efforts he again had to resign, but later he defended his plan of reform in letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span>  (30 June; 7 and 10 July 1884; 29 Sept 1888).<br>
<br>In 1885 Lloyd resumed his post as resident magistrate in Ireland, this time in Londonderry. However, in the winter of that year he left for Mauritius, where he had been appointed lieutenant-governor and colonial secretary. This appointment was short-lived, as he could not see eye to eye with the then governor, Sir John Pope Hennessy, recently elected nationalist MP for co. Kilkenny. Lloyd was then transferred to the Seychelles, in August 1886 (to a post which he never took up), and he eventually resigned in 1887. During his subsequent period of unemployment he published memoirs of his time in Ireland under the title, <span class="italic">Ireland under the Land League: a Narrative of Personal Experiences</span>. Finally, on 15 September 1889, he was appointed consul for Kurdistan, where his attempts to promote the Armenian cause were appreciated by Sir William White, the English ambassador at Constantinople. Lloyd died of pneumonia at Erzurum, Kurdistan, on 7 January 1891; his wife survived him.<br>
