<span class="headword">Baker, Sir  Rowland</span>  (1908&#150;1983), <span class="occ">naval architect</span>, was born on 3 June 1908 at Upchurch, Sittingbourne, Kent, the eldest son of Isaac Baker, a sailing bargee, and his wife, Lizzie Palmer. He had a brother and three sisters. Always top of the class in school and successful at sports, he became an apprentice at Chatham Dockyard, where, after four years of dockyard school, he won a place as a constructor cadet at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, graduating in 1931 and completing his sea training in 1932. He was married on 28 November 1931 to Frances Edna Cornish (1912&#150;1994), with whom he had four children: daughters born in 1932 and 1934, and twins (another daughter and a son) born in 1943.<br>
<br>As an assistant constructor Baker held a number of appointments in both the Whitehall design office and in dockyards. On promotion to constructor in 1938 he took charge of sloop design, for which his principal task was the structural design of the <i>Seagull</i>, the first all-welded ship for the Royal Navy. It was a brilliant design, well ahead of its time with longitudinal framing and flush butt joints. No commercial shipyard would build it so it was built in Devonport Dockyard, showing considerable savings in both time and cost over a riveted half-sister on an adjoining slip. He then designed the very cheap <i>Bangor</i>-class mine-sweepers followed by the <i>Algerines</i>, both built in large numbers. He was also responsible for the highly successful improved <i>Black Swan</i>-class sloops.<br>
<br>Baker continued to make an important contribution to naval design during the Second World War. After the fall of France, the need was felt for large numbers of ships and craft to carry men and vehicles for a beach landing. The majority of landing ships and craft for both the Royal Navy and United States Navy were conceived by Baker, working for Earl Mountbatten. The combination of light weight for shallow draught, simplicity of construction, and seaworthiness made their design very difficult. A particular feature was his conviction that bow doors would always leak and, unlike modern ferries, his vessels would float upright with the vehicle deck flooded. In November 1941 he was granted a special pay allowance in recognition of his unusual responsibilities. Late in 1941 he spent some time in the USA initiating the design of the LST(2), the backbone of the allied invasion fleet, for which he was awarded the American medal of freedom after the war. In 1947 Baker described the design of landing ships and craft in two papers to the Institution of Naval Architects. After the war he was lent to the Canadian navy as constructor commodore, designing a successful icebreaker, the novel <i>St Laurent</i>-class frigates, and other vessels&#151;and making many new friends.<br>
<br>On return from Canada in 1956 Baker was put in charge of the nuclear submarine programme as technical chief executive, <i>Dreadnought</i> project, again under Mountbatten. It was a strange organization with many staff having dual line of authority but Baker transmitted his own enthusiasm and the project was completed at cost and on time, very rare among defence projects of that day. Baker had proved that his managerial skill was as great as his design skill. <i>Dreadnought</i> used American machinery in order to get her into service quickly but while she was being built the first British nuclear submarine machinery was installed for test at Dounreay and <i>Valiant</i>, the first all-British nuclear submarine, was being built, all under Baker's direction. Even before <i>Dreadnought</i> was completed he was put in charge of the Polaris submarine project, which was also completed within time and cost budgets.<br>
<br>Baker was appointed KB in the new year's honours of 1968, an unusual honour for a civil servant of his rank, and he retired in November of that year. He was persuaded to return to sort out problems with the mark 24 torpedo; later he tried, unsuccessfully, to develop a plant for the offshore oil industry.<br>
<br>Baker was an unforgettable man for whom to work. His command of the English language, learned on a working Thames barge, was unusual for a senior civil servant and very disconcerting to those unfamiliar with his ways. His staff worshipped him in classical mode: his thunderbolts were as effective as those of Zeus&#151;he would often throw files at his staff. On the other hand, his kind and valuable support was there when the going was tough. One junior officer (the author of this memoir) received a note reading &#145;Cor mate, you aint 'arf sticking your neck out! Don't worry, I'll back you if it goes wrong.&#146;<br>
<br>Baker's design skills were shown in the advanced longitudinal structure of <i>Seagull</i>, the safety of his flimsy landing craft, and the many novelties in the Canadian <i>St Laurent</i>-class frigates, further developed in later classes. He very strongly believed that a new design of ship should be 25 per cent novel and 75 per cent well-tried practice in order to be both up to date and reliable. In the submarine projects he pushed the use of network scheduling used in <i>Dreadnought</i>, a technique then unfamiliar in the UK, and then the more advanced PERT (programme evaluation and review technique) system for Polaris. It was no coincidence that both held to budget. Following a divorce, he married on 15 March 1972 Barbara Mary Comley (1921&#150;2008). Baker off duty was full of fun and his ribald performance at the annual submarine dinner was unforgettable. He died at the Royal United Hospital, Bath, on 25 November 1983.<br>
