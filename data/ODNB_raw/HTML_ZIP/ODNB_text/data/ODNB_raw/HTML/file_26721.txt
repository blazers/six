<span class="headword">Stuart,  John McDouall</span>  (1815&#150;1866), <span class="occ">land surveyor and explorer in Australia</span>, was born in Rectory Lane, Dysart, Fife, on 7 September 1815, the fourth of the seven (possibly nine) children and third (or fifth) son of William Stuart, a customs officer and retired army captain, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McDouall. Educated at Edinburgh, first privately and later at the Scottish Naval and Military Academy, he emigrated to South Australia, where he arrived in January 1839. Working first as a government and later as a private surveyor, he quickly acquired considerable skills as a bushman. On 12 August 1844 he joined Charles Sturt's expedition to explore central Australia and, following the death of James Poole, was appointed second in command. From this experience Stuart learned a great deal about travel in arid Australia and the difficulties of large cumbersome expeditions. Between 1846 and 1858 he practised land surveying and as a land agent surveyed runs and discovered new pastures for James Chambers, a horse breeder, pastoralist, and financier, and William Finke, who became the principal backers for all six of Stuart's expeditions into the interior.<br>
<br>The first of these (14 May &#150; 16 August 1858) was a three-man expedition prospecting for new pasture country to the west of Lake Torrens and south of Lake Eyre, when Stuart found and named Chambers (now Stuart) Creek on the south-western side of Lake Eyre South. Stuart reported finding 40,000 square miles of new territory, of which around one-third was, he claimed, suitable for grazing. His achievements were drawn to the attention of Sir Roderick Murchison, president of the Royal Geographical Society, by the governor of South Australia, Sir Richard MacDonnell. Stuart was rewarded when MacDonnell named the Stuart range after him and gave him a rent-free lease of 1000 square miles around Chambers Creek.<br>
<br>Stuart next led a four-man expedition (2 April &#150; 3 July 1859) north to discover and name Peake Creek and Neales River, draining into the western shore of northern Lake Eyre. This was followed almost immediately by a third expedition, which left Adelaide on 22 August. With a party of five, which included English-born William Kekwick, his faithful and resourceful second in command, Stuart spent the next five months surveying some 8000 square miles of pastoral prospects as well as looking for gold to the west of Lake Eyre. Sighting the lake's northern shore, he realized that a way was open to solve the mystery of the inland sea, fix the position of the centre of Australia (which Sturt had failed to do), and find a route for the proposed overland telegraph line connecting Australia to London via India.<br>
<br>With the way open, Stuart, Kekwick, and others left Chambers Creek on 2 March 1860, heading for the centre. They discovered and named the Finke River and the MacDonnell range before arriving on 21 April at the spot which Stuart considered to be the centre. After building a cairn and raising the &#145;British flag&#146;, the party pushed on until, on 26 June, 800 miles beyond Stuart's previous furthest, they were faced with Aboriginal hostility. Nearly starving, Stuart, suffering from scurvy and almost blind, ordered a retreat at Attack Creek, just north of Tennant Creek.<br>
<br>Stuart reached Adelaide on 7 October 1860 to find the South Australian government hurriedly organizing another attempt to cross the continent to beat the Victorian party led by Burke and Wills. Stuart's party consisted of Kekwick as second in command and ten others. Stuart's fifth expedition started from Chambers Creek on 1 January 1861 and crossed Attack Creek in April. However, by 12 July the party was so short-rationed and worn out that Stuart had again to retreat. On reaching Adelaide on 23 September 1861 he received the Royal Geographical Society's patron's medal, its highest award, for his previous exploits.<br>
<br>Stuart was almost immediately provided with a widely supported new expedition, with Kekwick as second in command, F. G. Waterhouse as government-appointed botanist, twelve men, and seventy-one horses. Although Stuart, by now a confirmed alcoholic and the second oldest and least fit, had the misfortune to have a horse break his hand, and was held up, the party left Chambers Creek on 8 January 1862, reached the centre on 12 March 1862, and, on 24 July, after bursting through a thick belt of scrub, arrived at the Indian Ocean at the mouth of what Stuart mistakenly thought was the Adelaide River. Consequent doubt as to whether Stuart had in fact crossed the continent remained until his marker was found at the mouth of the nearby Mary River in 1883.<br>
<br>After immense hardship, the abandonment of all but the bare essentials, and with Stuart suffering from scurvy, the party finally reached Adelaide on 17 December 1862. He was awarded &pound;2000 (later increased by a further &pound;1000), of which he was allowed only the interest, and his party &pound;1500 between them. Stuart later received a watch from the Royal Geographical Society.<br>
<br>With his health broken by the combined effects of alcohol and the privations of being almost constantly in the field from May 1858 to December 1862, Stuart left for England in April 1864. He died, unmarried, on 5 June 1866 in London at 9 Notting Hill Square. He was buried at Kensal Green cemetery on the 9th. Stuart was a superb bushman, capable of surviving and to a certain extent living off the land in Australia's arid and near waterless interior. His very considerable exploits are to be compared with those of such other practical surveyor-explorers as Augustus and Frank Gregory and Alec and John Forrest. His track to the north settled the route of the overland telegraph and his perhaps too favourable account of the country to the north did much to encourage the South Australian government in its successful bid for the incorporation of the Northern Territory. His modesty, indomitable spirit, determination, and practical achievements place him among the greatest of Australian explorers.<br>
