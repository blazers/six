<span class="headword">Wendy,  Thomas</span>  (1499/1500&#150;1560), <span class="occ">physician</span>, born between May 1499 and May 1500, was the second son of Thomas Wendy of Clare, Suffolk. He was educated at Cambridge, graduating BA in 1519. In the same year he became a fellow of Gonville Hall (afterwards Gonville and Caius College), and continued as such until 1524. He proceeded MA in 1522, and then went abroad to study medicine. He graduated MD at Ferrara, and was incorporated in this degree at Cambridge in 1527.<br>
<br>Wendy was able to build a lucrative medical practice and became a substantial landowner. In 1534 his services were retained by Henry Percy, sixth earl of Northumberland. As part of his duties for Northumberland he carried letters to Thomas Cromwell in 1536, and attended the earl during his final illness in 1537.<br>
<br>Wendy was subsequently appointed physician to Henry VIII, who on 12 June 1541 granted to him and his wife, Margery, the manor of Haslingfield, Cambridgeshire.<br>
<br>According to John Foxe, Wendy played some part in thwarting Stephen Gardiner's scheme to have Queen Katherine Parr condemned for heresy. Wendy was appointed physician to the queen in 1546. He attended Henry VIII on his deathbed, was one of the witnesses to his will, and was bequeathed &pound;100 by the king. He was continued as royal physician with a salary of &pound;100 by Edward VI, who made him further grants of land.<br>
<br>On 12 November 1548 Wendy was appointed one of the ecclesiastical visitors of Oxford, Cambridge, and Eton College, and on 6 May 1552 was again commissioned to visit Eton. He was admitted fellow of the College of Physicians on 22 December 1551, and became an elect in 1552. In the same year he married his second wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1570), daughter of John Porter of London, and widow of Thomas Atkins of London. Wendy attended Edward VI on his deathbed, and was continued as royal physician by Mary, to whom he performed a similar service.<br>
<br>On 26 March 1554 Wendy became member of parliament for St Albans, and on 10 October 1555 for Cambridgeshire. He was appointed an ecclesiastical visitor by Elizabeth in 1559.<br>
<br>Wendy died at Haslingfield on 11 May 1560, in his sixty-first year, and was survived by his wife. He was buried at Haslingfield on 27 May. Having been a benefactor of Gonville and Caius College, he is commemorated there by a service held on 11 May. The college library has his collection of medical and classical books. Wendy had a stepson, but his nephew Thomas, son of his elder brother, John, was his heir. Thomas was sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire in 1573&#150;4, 1585&#150;6, and 1602&#150;3; in 1586&#150;7 he was in trouble with the privy council for refusing the oath. He added his lands at Barrington, Cambridgeshire, to his uncle's endowment of Gonville and Caius College.<br>
