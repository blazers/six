<span class="headword">Randolph,  John</span>  (1749&#150;1813), <span class="occ">bishop of London</span>, was born in Oxford on 6 July 1749, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23124/', "Thomas Randolph (1701&#150;1783)")</script>, president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and Thomazine Honywood (1707/8&#150;1783). He was educated at Westminster School and matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 17 June 1767. He graduated BA (1771), MA (1774), BD (1782), and DD by diploma on 30 October 1783. From 1779 to 1783 he was a tutor and censor at Christ Church where he helped the dean, Lewis Bagot, to enforce discipline; he was appointed proctor in 1781. He was tutor to William Wyndham, later Baron Grenville, and to Richard Polwhele, who complained that, entrenched behind forms and ceremonies, Randolph's &#145;manner was frigid, and his words were few&#146;  (Polwhele 1.84). On 13 September 1785 he married Jane Lambarde (<i>d</i>. 1836), the daughter of Thomas Lambarde of Sevenoaks, Kent.<br>
<br>His father's influence at Oxford enabled Randolph to become a &#145;professorial pluralist&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hist. U. Oxf.</span> 5: <span class="italic">18th-cent. Oxf.</span>, 517) as professor of poetry (1776&#150;83), regius professor of Greek (1782&#150;3), professor of moral philosophy (1782&#150;6), and regius professor of divinity (1783&#150;1807). He delivered one lecture a term, in Latin, on the poetry of Homer and the course was still incomplete after seven years. The regius chair in Greek was a sinecure which normally went to a man from Christ Church and Randolph resigned it when he was promoted to the regius chair in divinity. He sought in his lectures on divinity to provide ordinands with a thorough instruction in the theology of the established church and a clear understanding of how it differed from that of Rome. However, as Cox remembered, the lectures were<blockquote>given late in the evening by candle-light; one effect of this (and not a very surprising one, considering the hour, the subject, and the audience) was, that many of the class slept through the lecture &hellip; the only things really carried away by the majority of the class, were the Syllabus given to each one at the commencement of the course, and a formidable printed list of authors recommended for future reading, presented at the close of the lectures. (Cox, 140)</blockquote>Randolph was a conscientious and assiduous teacher who kept, in his own hand, a list of all students who attended each lecture. But his colleagues were critical of the appropriateness of these discourses; later Cyril Jackson, dean of Christ Church, commenting on over-long lectures, complained that Randolph &#145;used to write complete doctrinal treatises, which is absurd&#146;  (letter to Howley, 20 Oct 1810, LPL, MS 2186 fol. 24). His library, which was sold after his death, consisted of 1623 items that reflected his wide interests in theology, classical literature, history, natural science, and travel.<br>
<br>Randolph's clerical career was as successful as his academic one; his limited experience as a parish priest did not bar his route to the episcopate. He held the prebend of Chute and Chisenbury in Salisbury Cathedral for twelve months from October 1782, was rector of Ewelme and canon of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford (1783&#150;1807), and sinecure rector of Darowen in Montgomeryshire (1797&#150;1800). He was consecrated bishop of Oxford on 1 September 1799, translated to Bangor on 6 January 1807, and thence to London on 9 August 1809. The charges issued on his primary visitation of each diocese reflect his consistent concerns: a profound distrust of Catholics and protestant dissenters, especially the Methodists; his opposition to clerical non-residence; his support for the education of the children of the poor; and his concern to keep his clergy well informed of clerical legislation in parliament. As bishop of London his correspondence reveals a conscientious bishop, much concerned to enforce the clergy residence act of 1803 and aware of the need for new church buildings to accommodate the rapidly growing population. His politics were traditional: he believed it was the duty of the clergy &#145;to promote the good order of society &hellip; by stifling every seed of discontent&#146;  (J. Randolph, <span class="italic">A Charge Delivered to the Clergy of the Diocese of Bangor</span>, 1808, 6), and warned &#145;the spirit of democracy is not easily subdued &hellip; it again rears its head wherever it can find or create the seeds of discontent; the dog returns to its own vomit again&#146;  (ibid., 9). Earlier a staunch opponent of the principles of the French Revolution, in 1813, as bishop of London, he rejected a proposal by the duke of Bedford to erect a statue of Charles James Fox in the porch of St Paul's Church, Covent Garden, commenting &#145;It looks like dedicating the Church to him.&#151;If the Porch has been the scene of popular Elections for Westminster I can only lament the abuse, but this is no reason for augmenting it&#146;  (letter to Mr Embry, 22 May 1813, LPL, Randolph MSS 3, fol. 43).<br>
<br>As well as sermons and charges Randolph published the heads of his divinity lectures in 1784 (the whole course being published posthumously by his son in 1869&#150;70) and engaged in controversy with Herbert Marsh on the synoptic gospels. He edited <span class="italic">The Clergyman's Instructor</span>, a collection of tracts on clerical duties, in 1807; his son published his lectures on Homer in 1870. He was a leading supporter of the National Society, a Busby trustee of Westminster School (1804), a governor of Charterhouse, and an official trustee of the British Museum. Sworn of the privy council on 27 September 1809, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 19 December 1811.<br>
<br>Randolph died suddenly on a visit to one of his sons, Thomas, rector of Much Hadham in Hertfordshire, on 28 July 1813, following an apoplectic fit while on horseback. He was buried in Fulham churchyard on 5 August.<br>
