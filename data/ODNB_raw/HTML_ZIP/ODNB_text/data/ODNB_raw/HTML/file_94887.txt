<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Large, Sir  Peter</span>  (1931&#150;2005), <span class="occ">civil servant and campaigner for the rights of disabled people</span>, was born on 16 October 1931 at 100 Hawkeys Lane, Tynemouth, the son of Rosslyn Victor Large (<i>d</i>. 1955), bank clerk, later a principal at the Bank of England, and his wife, Ethel May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Walters (<i>d</i>. 1981). At the time of the registration of his birth his parents lived at 34 Chase Court Gardens, Enfield, London. He was educated at Enfield grammar school and University College, London where he graduated BSc in civil engineering. His love of sport and his ability on the football field earned him a trial with Arsenal Football Club. During his national service (1953&#150;5) he served on submarines and was the first national serviceman to be appointed a submarine engineer officer. He left the navy as a sub-lieutenant.<br>
<br>In 1956 Large joined Shell International Petroleum as an engineer. Initially posted to Nigeria, he served also in Ghana and the Persian Gulf before being posted to Indonesia in 1962. There he contracted poliomyelitis, which left him paralysed. He was flown back to the UK by the Royal Air Force and spent fourteen months in hospital. He was unable to use his legs or arms and was totally dependent on others. Had it not been for his determination and intellectual vigour he could well have been consigned for life to an institution. On 27 April 1962, while still an in-patient at the Royal Free Hospital, London, he married Susy Baber, a 33-year-old divorcee (through whom he acquired a stepson and two stepdaughters), and daughter of Bernard Fisher, medical practitioner. With her assistance he was able to leave hospital. In 1966 he joined the Board of Trade and in 1976 he became a senior scientific officer.<br>
<br>Although he remained a civil servant until 1991, Large's main impact was elsewhere. Also in 1966 he joined the board of the British Council for Rehabilitation of the Disabled, and when this merged with the Central Council for the Disabled in 1977, to form the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation (RADAR), he became a member of the executive committee of the new organization, a position he held until 2001. This gave him a pivotal role in the world of disability politics. Meanwhile he had noticed that services for disabled people were geared towards those of non-managerial status and, together with Mary Greaves, he established the Association of Disabled Professionals in 1971. He became its first chairman, a post he retained until 1993 when he became its parliamentary adviser.<br>
<br>Large quickly became a superb lobbyist who won the respect of those he worked with as well as of the ministers and civil servants whose minds he had to change. In the 1960s there were no social security benefits to meet the particular needs of disabled people who had not been in the military. Large campaigned for a disability benefit in two parts. One part would be taxable and would compensate for loss of earnings and the other, which would be tax free, would meet the extra costs that disability inevitably imposed. Although this was never achieved in the form Large wanted, his efforts bore fruit in social security benefits such as the disability living allowance and incapacity benefits. For twenty years Large was the parliamentary adviser to the Disablement Income Group and from 1985 to 1993 was its vice-chairman.<br>
<br>Large also made a major contribution to the mobility of disabled people. In the 1960s the assistance disabled people received towards their mobility was, apart from wheelchairs, an invalid tricycle that had only one seat; passenger carrying was forbidden. A number of disability organizations campaigned to have these tricycles replaced by a small car. Large, who could not drive because he could not use his arms, argued that the existing scheme helped those who already had the most mobility and ignored those with greater impairments. Against considerable opposition he won the argument and the government introduced the mobility allowance, a cash payment intended to enable disabled people to purchase a car. However, as the allowance was not enough for that purpose Large joined a working group set up by the Central Council for the Disabled. The government accepted its main recommendation that a new organization should be established to enable disabled people to lease a car for the value of their allowance. The charity Motability was the result and Large was a trustee from its inception in 1978 until his death. By that time it was supplying cars to 440,000 disabled people and was responsible for 5 per cent of all new car sales in the UK. Large also worked to make public transport accessible. His main platform was his chairmanship of the Joint Committee on Mobility for Disabled People (1971&#150;97) but he also advised the Department of Transport through his membership of the influential Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (1986&#150;2002). He promoted accessible air travel but his diffidence seemed to prevent him taking advantage of the services he won for other people. He rarely travelled further than London.<br>
<br>Perhaps Large's greatest contribution was his successful fight for legislation outlawing discrimination against disabled people. The world's first minister for disabled people, Alfred (Alf) Morris, invited Large to chair the Silver Jubilee Committee on Improving Access for Disabled People (1977&#150;9) to investigate the extent to which disabled people were prevented from getting around by the structure of the built environment. His report, <span class="italic">Can Disabled People Go Where You Go?</span> (1979), prompted the response &#145;no&#146;. Also in 1979 Morris invited Large to chair another committee, the Committee on Restrictions Against Disabled People, which reported in 1982. The new (Conservative) minister was less responsive to meeting the needs of disabled people than Morris had been. Large pointed out that discrimination was not only about employers and service providers treating disabled people unjustly because of their disability. It also occurred when buildings were designed with features such as steps that prevented wheelchair users getting into them. Hotels routinely turned disabled people away, as did caf&eacute;s, restaurants, and shops. He argued that seeking to tackle discrimination by persuasion was a waste of time; legislation was needed to make it unlawful. He argued that he did not care what people thought about him, what was important was the way they treated him. Jack Ashley introduced a <span class="roman">Disability Discrimination Bill</span> into parliament. It was defeated, as was every other attempt until 1995, when a <span class="roman">Disability Discrimination Act</span> was finally passed. This legislation provided inadequate means to enable disabled people to enforce their rights, but in 2000 the Disability Rights Commission was established. A twenty-year battle had been won.<br>
<br>Large's wife, Susy, developed a kidney disease in 1979 and was advised to stop smoking. Large, who was a heavy smoker, supported his wife and gave up overnight, another example of his remarkable willpower. Susy died in 1982. Large needed help for all physical activity and hired a number of carers to support him. Eventually he employed Sheenah McCaffrey (the daughter of Joseph James McCaffrey, hospital boiler stoker), who moved into his home to provide the twenty-four-hour care he needed. They married on 16 October 1992. With her support he was able to continue attending countless meetings in London to press the cause of disabled people. In later years he used artificial respiration during the day as well as at night. He was drafting a response to a government document on behalf of the Association of Disabled Professionals the day before he died.<br>
<br>Large was appointed MBE in 1974 and CBE in 1987, and knighted in 1993. Those who knew him were struck by his intelligence and determination, and his endless ability to support any disabled person who sought his help. He was always courteous and modest. His favourite entertainments were talking to his cats and listening to jazz. He died of respiratory failure on 23 January 2005 at his home, 14 Birch Way, Warlingham, Surrey, and was survived by his wife, Sheenah.<br>
