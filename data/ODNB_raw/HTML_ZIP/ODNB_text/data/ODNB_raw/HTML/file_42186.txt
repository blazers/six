<span class="headword">Hope,  Henry Thomas</span>  (1808&#150;1862), <span class="occ">patron of the arts and politician</span>, was born in London, probably in Duchess Street, on 30 April 1808, eldest of the three sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13737/', "Thomas Hope (1769&#150;1831)")</script>, of the Amsterdam banking family, and his wife, Louisa (<i>d</i>. 1851), daughter of William de la Poer Beresford, first Baron Decies, and his wife, Elizabeth. Hope's inheritance of money, property, and art collections from his father and his uncle, Henry Phillip Hope (<i>d</i>. 1839), led to bitter estrangement from his brothers, who included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13713/', "Alexander James Beresford Hope")</script>, but allowed him as &#145;one of the richest commoners of the kingdom&#146;  (Watkin, 26) to follow his political and cultural interests in a style of enlightened opulence.<br>
<br>Hope was educated at Eton College (<i>c</i>.1823) and at Trinity College, Cambridge (1825&#150;9). His first parliamentary seat was the rotten borough of East Looe (1829&#150;32), purchased by his parents, who hoped to exchange his political services for a peerage for his father. The tactic failed, though Henry became briefly a groom of the bedchamber (1830). He opposed parliamentary reform, asserting that his constituents were under &#145;no other influence than that of kindliness and respect&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 22 July 1831). East Looe lost its separate representation in 1832, and Hope sought an alternative seat, standing unsuccessfully for Gloucester in December 1832 and Marylebone in March 1833, before being elected as a Conservative at Gloucester in April 1833, largely because of his spending and his whig opponents' squabbling. He represented it for fifteen years in all&#151;1833&#150;7, 1838&#150;41, and 1847&#150;52. He was, however, a shy man who seldom spoke in the Commons, and he is memorable, not as parliamentarian, but as patron and host.<br>
<br>In spending and in commitment, Hope prided himself on always &#145;doing more rather than less of what I promised&#146;  (Hope to Disraeli, 23 Feb 1854). He had diverse interests, being a founder of the Art Union of London (1836) and the Royal Botanical Society, vice-president of the Society of Arts, and president of the Surrey Archaeological Society. He kept his own accounts and was an early promoter (1833) of the London and Westminster Joint Stock Bank. In his London house on Duchess Street, he entertained sumptuously among his art treasures; guests, Disraeli reported in 1834, &#145;supped off gold and danced in the Sculpture Gallery&#146;  (<span class="italic">Disraeli Letters</span>, 1.322 and n.13). At Deepdene (demolished in 1969), in Surrey, visiting aristocrats, diplomats, and politicians occupied luxurious suites, and strolled among more statues and pictures; even so, their host's conversation, sophisticated and learned, was &#145;the finest thing in it&#146;  (L'Estrange, 2.305). From 1836 he continued his father's remodelling of Deepdene into &#145;the most perfect Italian palace&#146;  (<span class="italic">Disraeli Letters</span>, 3.1104), adding (probably to his own design) impressive reception rooms and a spectacular two-storey galleried entrance hall. By 1840 his modifications made it a pioneering example of Victorian Italianate architecture and landscaping.<br>
<br>In this appropriately picturesque setting, Hope played Maecenas to political idealists, such as Young England in 1842&#150;4, or the Spanish Carlists in 1846. Disraeli began <span class="italic">Coningsby</span> there in September 1843, but in dedicating it to Hope he was acknowledging more than hospitality and encouragement: in 1842, his seat in parliament had been saved by Hope's willingness to accede to an informal agreement between the party election agents that the Liberal candidates would drop their petition against Disraeli's election at Shrewsbury in return for Hope's withdrawing his petition against the successful Liberal candidates at Gloucester. Ten years later, he was still supporting Disraeli's political views with financial contributions to Disraeli's newspaper, <span class="italic">The Press</span>. Nevertheless, it was as a Conservative free-trader that he was re-elected for Gloucester in 1847, and as a Peelite that he was defeated in July 1852.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Hope bought an 18,000 acre Irish estate, Castle Blayney, co. Monaghan, partly to show how to improve a neglected property. He was an organizer of the Great Exhibition of 1851, while constructing (1849&#150;51) a palatial French-designed mansion at 116 Piccadilly (later the Junior Athenaeum). Lavishly decorated, it reputedly cost &pound;30,000 (about one third of his annual income) and again anticipated architectural style rather than merely following contemporary taste. It housed his collection of Dutch and Italian masters, which he opened to the public. Also in 1851, he married Anne Adele Bichat (<i>d</i>. 1887), daughter of Joseph Bichat; she was already mother of his daughter, Henrietta Adele (1843&#150;1913). Shortly afterwards Isambard Kingdom Brunel persuaded him to chair the Eastern Steam Navigation Company, rightly judging that Hope's perseverance and ability to raise funds would surmount the problems which surrounded the building of Brunel's largest ship, the <i>Great Eastern</i>. Henrietta Hope named it in November 1857. Hope thankfully resigned his position in 1858.<br>
<br>In 1861 the family at last obtained the title which Hope's father had wanted, when Henrietta Hope married Lord Lincoln (later sixth duke of Newcastle). In effect, Hope saved the dukedom, paying Lincoln's debts with &pound;35,000 and an allowance of between &pound;10,000 and &pound;12,000. Hope died, after a long illness, on 4 December 1862 at 116 Piccadilly, London. Probably to preserve them from his brothers, his money (sworn at under &pound;300,000) and a life interest in his landed properties were secured to his wife.<br>
