<span class="headword">Blair, Sir  Robert</span>  (1859&#150;1935), <span class="occ">educational administrator</span>, was born in Wigtown in south-west Scotland on 8 March 1859, the eldest of the ten children of William Blair and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hood. His father, a Presbyterian, appears to have had a variety of jobs but was principally a cobbler by trade. Robert attended the Free Kirk school in Wigtown, where he was introduced to classical scholarship and academic rigour. The school catered for children from different social backgrounds, a style of education which he later recalled with approval. He was a pupil teacher at the Garlieston endowed school from 1873 to 1876 before entering Edinburgh University with the help of a bursary from the Edinburgh Galloway Association. The novelist S. R. Crockett was a fellow student and Blair appears as Rob Grier in Crockett's semi-autobiographical <span class="italic">Kit Kennedy</span> (1899).<br>
<br>After graduating MA in 1880 Blair taught for a short time in Kelso before moving to London in 1881 to take up an appointment at Aske's Hatcham School, New Cross, where he was a master for twelve years. During this period he became increasingly interested in science education, studying part-time for a London University BSc, and eventually taking responsibility for this area of work throughout the school. This experience helped him to secure his next appointment as headmaster of the Cheltenham Science and Technical School. This was followed in 1894 by six years as an inspector with the Scottish education department, after which Blair moved to Ireland, where he became inspector of science and art and subsequently assistant secretary for technical education. He was a member of Alfred Mosely's commission to study American education in 1903.<br>
<br>The period of Blair's greatest influence came with his appointment in June 1904 as the first education officer to the London county council (LCC). Physically impressive (he had &#145;a magnificent leonine head&#146;), and with a forceful personality, he came to exercise great authority at the LCC. His first task was to effect the fusion of the London school board and the technical education board; his work in this area helped to establish the professional role of the chief officer. He was president of the National Association of Education Officers in 1914 and was knighted in the same year. A strong believer in educating adolescents for employment, he recognized the fundamental importance of technical education. He reorganized technical education in London in 1913, attempting to raise its quality, but his failure to win support from London employers convinced him of the need for compulsory day-continuation schools for all those aged between fourteen and sixteen not in full-time education. As chairman of the Liberal Party's advisory committee on education he was able to exert a significant influence upon H. A. L. Fisher's 1918 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>, which gave continuation schools a central role. Compulsory attendance was enforced by the LCC until opposition from employers became overwhelming in the council elections of 1922. In 1924, the year of Blair's retirement, London began the reorganization of elementary schools into junior and senior branches, which he had long advocated.<br>
<br>In 1883 Blair married Ida Kathleen Westrup of Kensington, London, with whom he had four sons and one daughter. He died at his home, 33 Gresham Gardens, Golders Green, Middlesex, on 10 June 1935 and was buried in Hampstead cemetery.<br>
