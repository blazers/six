<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Chadwick,  Henry</span>  (1920&#150;2008), <span class="occ">theologian and church historian</span>, was born on 23 June 1920 at St Andrews, Oaklands Road, Bromley, Kent, the third of four sons and the fourth of six children of John Chadwick, barrister, and his wife, Edith Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Horrocks, a gifted musician. The four sons all became men of distinction: Sir John Chadwick (1911&#150;1987) as a diplomat, (William) Owen Chadwick (<i>b</i>. 1916) as a church historian (he was appointed KBE in 1982 but, like Henry himself, was an ordained clergyman and so did not use the title), and Martin Chadwick (1927&#150;1998) as a churchman.<br>
<br>Henry Chadwick was a king's scholar at Eton College (1933&#150;8), from where he won a music scholarship to Magdalene College, Cambridge. He was said to have been sent into the organ loft at Eton to study with the school's famous teacher, Henry Ley, because his Greek was considered weak. However, throughout his long career his patristic Greek and Latin left nothing to be desired. In Cambridge his reputation as a virtuoso keyboard player was quickly established. In his very first term Boris Ord of King's College, whom Chadwick described as then the greatest influence on him, summoned him one evening to entertain his dinner guests with Chabrier's arrangement of his <span class="italic">Espa&ntilde;a</span> for two pianos. Chadwick had to read his extremely difficult part at sight. Patrick Hadley, professor of music, turned the pages for him, at every turn thumping him in the back, shouting &#145;Bravo!&#146;  (Darlington, 2). He retained his musical brilliance into old age, and saw music as giving to his whole life a vital sense of elevation, &#145;a ladder of ascent&#146; as he called it in a sermon preached in the chapel of King's College, Cambridge, in 1991  (ibid., 3). In 1995 he gave a lecture at Oxford of astonishing range and insight on the power of music.<br>
<br>After obtaining the MusB in 1941 Chadwick turned to the study of theology, mainly because as a committed evangelical Christian he felt a vocation to the church's ministry. One of the relatively hidden aspects of his personality was his pastoral gift, as would be revealed by his many letters of encouragement and compassion to diverse individuals. Studying at Ridley Hall, Cambridge, he was ordained deacon in 1943 and priest in 1944. He held a harrowing curacy in south Croydon (1943&#150;5), which suffered much German bombing. On 24 August 1945, at Holy Trinity Church, Brompton, he married Margaret Elizabeth (Peggy) Brownrigg, a talented singer who sometimes maintained that she had married her accompanist. The daughter of William Pemell Brownrigg, she was later a secondary school teacher. The marriage was a long and happy one; to each of their three daughters (Priscilla, Hilary, and Juliet) Chadwick dedicated one of his books. His wife was always a vital support to Chadwick, watcher over his well-being, co-host in his generous hospitality, proof-reader of his books, and insister on clarity in his sermons and scholarly writings. Chadwick was a prodigious accumulator of books, but he could not always find them. Peggy usually could.<br>
<br>After a few months as assistant master at Wellington College, Chadwick was from 1946 to 1958 fellow and chaplain of Queens' College, Cambridge. His lectures there showed him to be a born communicator; each would end with a cliff-hanger&#151;some exciting question or problem for the following week. Published in 1953, his monumental work on Origen's <span class="italic">Contra Celsum</span> placed him at once in the front rank of patristic scholars. This work was remarkable for its fine translation and &#145;succinct introduction and notes, which reveal a great deal about the engagement between the Christian apologist and the Greek philosophical heritage&#146;  (<span class="italic">SBL Forum</span>). Chadwick always loved footnotes and excelled in the art of composing them. Other early works included <span class="italic">Alexandrian Christianity</span> (with J. E. L. Oulton, 1954), <span class="italic">Lessing's Theological Writings</span> (1956), and <span class="italic">The Sentences of Sextus</span> (1959). Chadwick was also editor of the important <span class="italic">Journal of Theological Studies</span> from 1954 to 1985, and contributed many of its most distinguished book reviews.<br>
<br>Early in 1959 Chadwick became regius professor of divinity at Oxford and a canon of Christ Church. In 1966 appeared a book of massive erudition and clear judgement, <span class="italic">Early Christian Thought and the Classical Tradition</span>, on how, in the second and third centuries, Christianity defined itself and gained credibility in its own eyes by its relation to Greek philosophy. Thus the book followed up his interest in <span class="italic">Contra Celsum</span>. With a mastery of Platonism and neo-Platonism, it related the kind of paradox in which Chadwick delighted: the harsher the words about Greek philosophy of Justin, Clement, and Origen became, the more deeply impregnated with Platonism was their actual theology. Earlier, in 1961, he had given a paper at a major classical conference in Oxford on the same subject. Its preparation was to him &#145;a nightmare&#146;: &#145;I sat up working at the wretched thing each night and somehow it wouldn't go&#146;  (letter to Peggy Chadwick, 11 Aug 1961, priv. coll.). However effortless the end product looked, Chadwick's scholarship always involved struggle. The paper was in fact a success, and Arnaldo Momigliano, as chairman, said that it marked a change of emphasis in classical studies that for the first time their conference was addressed by a professor of divinity. In 1967 Chadwick's brilliant and much reprinted survey, <span class="italic">The Early Church</span>, was published in the <span class="roman">Pelican History of the Church</span>.<br>
<br>In 1969 Chadwick became dean of Christ Church, Oxford. As such he was both the head of a college and the dean of a cathedral, a demanding position. Emollient, ready to see all sides of an argument, reluctant to say no, he could hardly feel entirely comfortable in the role. His days were filled with often none-too-calm meetings, and with committees and administration, which by no means always played to his gifts, let alone to his inclinations. He felt for Augustine, who &#145;wanted to be a monk rather than a busy town pastor constantly beset by unreasonable people&#146;  (Chadwick, <span class="italic">Augustine</span>, 1986, 58). To his (eminently reasonable) colleague Peter Oppenheimer, who once offered him a cup of coffee after lunch, he replied soulfully, &#145;Ah! My dear Peter, it might keep me awake during Hebdomadal Council!&#146;  (private information). But if it came to a great occasion in the college or the university, whether at the lectern or in the pulpit of the cathedral, he displayed a clarity of utterance and dignity of bearing which, together with his pre-eminent scholarship, were the pride of his colleagues. He thought that he would never be able to write a book while dean, but by rising exceptionally early, and working on it for three hours before the morning office in the cathedral, he wrote a highly original one on the Spaniard <span class="italic">Priscillian of Avila</span> (1976), defending with verve Priscillian's orthodoxy against his enemies. He relished conflict of this kind in a past age, as much as he hated it around him.<br>
<br>During his deanship fell the greatest part of Chadwick's work in the Anglican&#150;Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC), of which he was a member from 1969 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1990, and on which he was the leading figure. Here his emollience became a positive virtue, and his scholarship was massively deployed. In the ARCIC statement <span class="italic">Salvation and the Church</span> (1976), for instance, a range of the writings of Augustine of Hippo, as of the early Anglican divines on whom Chadwick was if anything even more learned at the time, served to point up possible theological resolutions of much that seemed to divide Anglicans and Roman Catholics. The hand of Chadwick can be seen, not exclusively, but in large measure here. He was at pains to show, as in his later book on Boethius, how linguistic usage rather than substance could be theologically divisive. His brilliant footnote on transubstantiation in the ARCIC <span class="italic">Agreement on the Eucharist</span> (1971, ed. Julian Charley) was a case in point.<br>
<br>Chadwick well knew that the resolution of theological difficulties would not in itself lead to Christian unity. There were also intractable problems of authority and ecclesiology. In his view progress here depended on the continuation within the Roman Communion of the Second Vatican Council's emphasis on the collegiality of all bishops as well as on the Roman primacy. In 1969 he brought Cardinal Leo Suenens to Oxford to lecture on collegiality. This attitude of Chadwick's went back a long way. In his Oxford inaugural lecture of 1959, &#145;The circle and the ellipse&#146;, he argued that from very early on the church was conceived to have not one centre but two, Jerusalem and Rome, and thus the local churches were not united with each other by a circular line centred on one church, but by an elliptical line centred on two. This idea was pregnant with consequences for his later thinking about primacy and episcopal collegiality. The retreat from collegiality in Rome, which he traced back to Pope Paul VI, was the first cause of disappointment in his ecumenical hopes which Chadwick would come to feel deeply. Notwithstanding his disappointment, however, the degree of unity in 2000 was vastly greater than in 1950, and he had played a significant role in that change.<br>
<br>Early in 1982 Chadwick went to Rome as Archbishop Runcie's emissary, to discuss directly with Pope John Paul II in particular the form of service at Canterbury during the pope's forthcoming visit to England. Afterwards he wrote of his impression that Anglicans had come &#145;to seem a bore to the top administrators of the Roman Catholic Church&#146;  (Carpenter, <span class="italic">Robert Runcie</span>, 241). But he personally was held in great respect by the pope, who presented him with a splendid embroidered stole, a mark of specifically priestly honour, which at his funeral lay on his coffin.<br>
<br>From 1979 to 1983 Chadwick was regius professor of divinity at Cambridge. In 1981 his book on Boethius was published. This was a subject peculiarly congenial to him. Boethius was a deeply Platonist thinker, ever searching after the One that bound the whole cosmos together, and Chadwick's book integrated into a coherence all the intellectual aspects, including music, of this early sixth-century Italian nobleman. During the 1980s Chadwick's interest in Augustine was always deepening, stimulated by his work in ARCIC, as well as by his friendship with Peter Brown and others. His <span class="italic">Augustine</span> (1986) was intended as a short introduction, but it represented the distillation of great learning and insight. It also represented a large investment of his own personality; for, always compatibly with critical scholarship, he seemed often to identify himself with Augustine's faith and humanity. Even more arresting was a book on Augustine which had been abandoned for the one published in 1986; it was discovered after his death by Peggy and published posthumously as <span class="italic">Augustine of Hippo: a Life</span> (2009). In his foreword Peter Brown wrote that no one else could seize with greater clarity and firmness the nerve centres of entire systems of thought, without ever freezing them into static structures. Besides its profundity this book contained some fine examples of Chadwick's characteristic wit, such as his description of Augustine's biographer Possidius as &#145;an honest uninventive man, gasping with astonishment in the presence of personal greatness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Augustine of Hippo</span>, 4). As regius professor in Cambridge he was a fellow of Magdalene College, where the many fond memories of him included his own delight when he returned some books to the college library late and with profuse apologies, to be answered by the kindly assistant, &#145;don't worry dear, I'm a slow reader myself&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Chadwick came out of retirement in 1987 to become, for six years, an eirenic master of Peterhouse, Cambridge. There he worked on his two last books, <span class="italic">The Church in Ancient Society: from Galilee to Gregory the Great</span> (2001), a summation of his life's scholarship; and the much shorter but even more remarkable <span class="italic">East and West: the Making of a Rift in the Church</span> (2003), about what he called &#145;the greatest Christian split of all&#146;  (<span class="italic">East and West</span>, 1). The epilogue of the latter book harked back to his long ecumenical experience, when he observed that the characteristic of those against ecumenism always was, in effect, their refusal to bring themselves out of the past into the present. This book had a hero in Photius, the ninth-century patriarch of Constantinople. Photius was an urbane churchman, and a great collector and reviewer of books. For one glorious moment it looked as if he and Pope John VIII had resolved all the then disputes between Rome and Constantinople. The pope sent him a pallium and other vestments, but after his death all was to end in disappointment.<br>
<br>In 1960 Chadwick was elected a fellow of the British Academy and thereafter he was showered with many honorary doctorates and fellowships. He was an honorary or corresponding member of learned societies in America, France, Germany, and Belgium. He was made a KBE in 1989 (but as an ordained priest did not use the title &#145;Sir&#146;), and in 1993 was elected to the German Order Pour le M&eacute;rite, an order of truly world-class scholars and scientists. This election reflected not only his personal distinction, but also his study of German theology and his sympathetic friendships with German theologians immediately following the Second World War and subsequently. In the memorial address about Chadwick, delivered for the order by his fellow theologian Eberhard J&uuml;ngel, J&uuml;ngel called him a great builder of bridges (<i>pontes</i>), bridges between different kinds of people, and between the early Church and our own present; truly a <i>pontifex</i>, who even sought to build bridges to the Roman <i>pontifex maximus</i>. For all his Olympian presence, his tall form and slight stoop, his fine forehead and piercing eyes, his sing-song diction, he was so courteous, so compassionate, so good a listener, and so engaged with people, as to be also a most loveable person. He lived latterly in St John Street, Oxford, and died on 17 June 2008 at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, of pneumonia. He was survived by his wife, Peggy, and their three daughters. Memorial services were held at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, on 27 September 2008, and at Great St Mary's, Cambridge, on 22 November 2008.<br>
