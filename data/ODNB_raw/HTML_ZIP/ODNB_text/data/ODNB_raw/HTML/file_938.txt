<span class="headword">Ayloffe, Sir  Joseph</span>, sixth baronet  (1709/10&#150;1781), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was the only son of Joseph Ayloffe (1662/3&#150;1726), barrister, of Gray's Inn, London, and Mary Ayliffe (<i>d</i>. 1747), daughter of Brian Ayliffe, merchant of London. His father was said to have spent the last years of his life in Kirk Ireton, Derbyshire, in a most miserable state and died in 1726, aged sixty-three. Ayloffe was admitted to Westminster School in 1719 and Lincoln's Inn in 1724. He matriculated as a gentleman commoner at St John's College, Oxford, on 23 April 1726, aged sixteen, but left about 1728 without taking his degree and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1730. Later the same year he succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his unmarried cousin Sir John Ayloffe, fifth baronet. In January 1734 he married Margaret Railton (1704/5&#150;1797), the daughter of Thomas Railton of Carlisle and the widow of Thomas Railton JP of Westminster. They had one son, Joseph, who died of smallpox in 1756, aged twenty-one.<br>
<br>Ayloffe was described by the Revd Mark Noble as having a better education than fortune, and for much of his life he had salaried employment. In 1736 he was appointed clerk to the commissioners for building Westminster Bridge at &pound;200 p.a. He managed the commission's affairs efficiently and was discharged in 1750, when the bridge was completed. Confusion with Joseph Ayliffe has led to the mistaken claim that he was auditor-general of the Bridewell and Bethlem hospitals in 1750. Ayloffe launched a series of unsuccessful publishing schemes in 1751. His <span class="italic">Universal Librarian</span>, whose authorship was attributed anonymously &#145;to a Fellow of the Royal Society&#146;, was intended to review the most important new books published in Britain and abroad, but only volume 1, part 1 (1751), was published. He circulated proposals for printing the debates in parliament prior to the Restoration, but never published them. His plan to issue a translation of Diderot's <span class="italic">Encyclop&eacute;die</span> in parts, with additional articles on English subjects, was severely criticized in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> after the first number was published in 1752, and the project was abandoned.<br>
<br>Ayloffe's chief interest was antiquarian research. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1731 and of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1732, and served as vice-president of both learned societies. Later in life he established himself as the unofficial legal adviser to the Society of Antiquaries and in 1776 drew up their petition to George III for accommodation in the new Somerset House. He was also a member of the Spalding Gentlemen's Society in 1739. In 1764 he found congenial employment with Andrew Ducarel and Thomas Astle as a commissioner for methodizing, regulating, and digesting the records in the state paper office in Whitehall. The salary was &pound;100 p.a., and the following year the task was extended to cover some of the exchequer records for an additional &pound;100 a year. Ayloffe continued this work until his death. The commissioners primarily arranged records rather than digesting or calendaring them, and twentieth-century archivists criticized their method for sorting without maintaining archival integrity.<br>
<br>In 1764 Ayloffe drew up proposals for a history of Suffolk, which he claimed to have been working on for many years, but according to John Nichols the project did not receive sufficient encouragement to proceed. All Ayloffe's antiquarian publications date from after his appointment at the state paper office. The most substantial were based on the work of others. In 1769 he revised John Thorpe's <span class="italic">Registrum Roffense</span> before publication, and in 1771 revised new editions of John Leland's <span class="italic">Collectanea</span> and Thomas Hearne's <span class="italic">Curious Discourses</span>. The work by which he is best known, <span class="italic">Calendars of the Ancient Charters &hellip; in the Tower of London</span>, was begun by Philip Morant but the 1774 edition is credited to Ayloffe. His friend Richard Gough called Ayloffe the Montfaucon of England for his work in publishing source materials for English history, which he believed was as important as the work of the French Benedictine monk Bernard de Montfaucon. Ayloffe read several papers at meetings of the Society of Antiquaries between 1766 and 1780, the most important of which were published in <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> and separately. In 1769, with Lord Chancellor Hardwicke's encouragement and financial support, he proposed the engraving of the Tudor historical painting then at Windsor Castle, later moved to Hampton Court, <span class="italic">Henry VIII at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520</span>, and read a paper on it in 1770. The painting was so large that to preserve the detail without joining plates James Basire engraved the largest copperplate and Whatman made the largest sheet of handmade paper (31 in. &times; 53 in.), known afterwards as antiquarian size. The print was finally distributed in 1775, and was followed by others described by Ayloffe and copied from Tudor historical paintings at Windsor Castle and Cowdray, Sussex. The latter were destroyed by fire in 1793 and the copies provide the only record. In 1772 Ayloffe superintended the opening of the tomb of Edward I in Westminster Abbey and gave an account of the discoveries.<br>
<br>Ayloffe was described by contemporaries as knowledgeable in history and antiquities, friendly, and sociable. He lived at various addresses in London: Carey Street, Lincoln's Inn, in 1739; Margaret Street, Cavendish Square, in 1762; and Kennington Lane, Lambeth, from at least 1766. He also had a house at Whartons, Framfield, Sussex, from about 1767. He died, aged seventy-one, at Kennington Lane on 19 April 1781, and was buried with his father and son in Hendon churchyard. Some prints and those of his manuscripts which had not been claimed by his friends were sold at Leigh and Sothebys auction sale from 25 February 1782. Ayloffe's widow died on 8 March 1797, aged ninety-two, and was also buried at Hendon.<br>
