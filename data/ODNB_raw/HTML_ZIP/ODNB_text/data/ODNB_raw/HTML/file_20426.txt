<span class="headword">Oakes, Sir  Hildebrand</span>, first baronet  (1754&#150;1822), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 19 January 1754 at Exeter, Devon, the eldest son of Lieutenant-Colonel Hildebrand Oakes (1733&#150;1797), late of the 33rd foot, and his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1775), the daughter of Henry Cornelison of Braxted Lodge, Essex. He was made ensign in the 33rd foot (later the Duke of Wellington's regiment) on 23 December 1767 and promoted lieutenant in April 1771. In December 1775 he accompanied his regiment to America, where he served under Lord Cornwallis. He was present at the attack on Charlestown in June 1776, was promoted captain on 8 August following, and served throughout the American War of Independence until the peace. He returned to England in May 1784.<br>
<br>In May 1786 Oakes was aide-de camp to Major-General Bruce on the staff in Ireland. On 18 November 1790 he was promoted brevet major, then on 13 September 1791 major in the 66th foot. In February 1792 he took temporary command of his regiment at St Vincent in the West Indies, whence he embarked with it to Gibraltar. On the arrival of a new lieutenant-colonel in February 1794 he returned to England, becoming a brevet lieutenant-colonel on 1 March. Oakes served as aide-de-camp to Sir Charles Stuart in Corsica in April, became deputy quartermaster-general there in May, and was promoted quartermaster-general of the army in the Mediterranean in June 1794. Although on 12 November 1795 he was made lieutenant-colonel of the 66th foot, he was transferred to the 26th ten days later; at the same time he retained his staff position in Corsica until June 1796. On 3 December 1796 he became quartermaster-general to Stuart's forces in Portugal, and on 1 January 1798 was made brevet colonel. He was promoted brigadier during the capture of Minorca.<br>
<br>Oakes joined Sir Ralph Abercromby's army in the Mediterranean in August 1800, serving with distinction in the Egyptian campaign of 1801 as second in command of the reserve under Sir John Moore. On 21 March he was wounded at the battle of Alexandria. For this service he was included in the votes of thanks from parliament. Between October 1802 and August 1804 he was brigadier-general at Malta, and on 10 November 1804 he became lieutenant-governor and commandant at Portsmouth. Promoted major-general on 1 January 1805, in June Oakes was appointed a commissioner of military inquiry, whose reports appeared in the parliamentary papers  (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1806&#150;7, 2). On 11 July 1806 he was appointed major-general on the staff and quartermaster-general to the army in the Mediterranean. After returning home from Sicily with the troops under Moore in December 1807 he was given command of the Malta garrison in March 1808 and received the local rank of lieutenant-general on 30 April 1810. In May 1810 Oakes accepted the civil and military commissionership of the island, but he did so reluctantly, telling Hudson Lowe, &#145;I shall not be sorry when the appointment passes into other hands&#146;  (Gregory, 319). Nevertheless he held the post until ill health forced him to relinquish it to Sir Thomas Maitland in October 1813, when he returned home. He became a lieutenant-general on 4 June 1811 and a baronet in recognition of his service on 2 November 1813. The outbreak of plague in Malta, which killed 5000 people, occurred during Oakes's government in 1813.<br>
<br>In January 1814 Oakes was appointed lieutenant-general of the ordnance, a post he retained until his death, and in May 1820 he was made GCB. His other appointments included colonel of the 1st garrison battalion (23 November 1803) and colonel of the 3rd West India (24 April 1806). On the death of Sir Thomas Moore he succeeded to the colonelcy of the 52nd light infantry on 25 January 1809. He was a member of the consolidated board of general officers, and one of the commissioners of the Chelsea Hospital and the Royal Military College. He died, unmarried, at Hereford Street, Mayfair, London, on 9 September 1822, and was succeeded by his younger brother Henry Oakes.<br>

<a name="cosubject_20425"></a><span class="headword">Sir Henry Oakes</span>, second baronet  (1756&#150;1827), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, was born at Exeter on 11 July 1756. He received an India cadetship on 8 February 1775 and was appointed a second lieutenant in the Bombay army on 18 May 1775. Thereafter he saw extensive service in India, serving in Gujarat in 1775&#150;6, in the Poona expedition of 1778, and at the sieges of Tellicherry, Onore, Mangalore, and Bednur in 1780&#150;81. He was adjutant-general of General Mathew's force, which on 28 April 1783 surrendered at Bednur, where he was taken prisoner by Tipu Sultan of Mysore. After his release in 1784 the Madras government made him captain-commandant of a sepoy battalion on 10 June 1784. Following its disbandment, Oakes commanded the grenadiers of the 2nd Bombay European regiment, and in September 1788 was transferred to the 12th Bombay native infantry. In 1790 he served with this regiment, first as quartermaster-general and later as commissary of supplies. He was present at the sieges of Cannanore and Seringapatam in 1791, at Cotapore in Malabar, and later in Palghautcherry with troops under Major John Cuppage in October 1791. In October 1792 he became deputy adjutant-general of the Bombay army, and on 9 December 1792 he married Dorothea (<i>d</i>. 1837), the daughter of General George Bowles of Mount Prospect, co. Cork, Ireland; they had four sons and two daughters. In 1796 he received the title of adjutant-general, having attained the rank of major on 6 May 1795 and lieutenant-colonel on 8 January 1796.<br>
<br>Oakes returned home on sick leave in 1798, but went again to India in 1802 and became colonel of the 7th Bombay native infantry. Once more ill health forced him to go back to England, but he was in India again in 1807, as military auditor-general at Bombay. However, he was soon obliged to return home. On 25 July 1810 he became major-general and on 4 June 1814 lieutenant-general. In his last years his ill health led increasingly to bouts of insanity, and on 1 November 1827 he killed himself with a pistol in the stable of his home at Mitcham, Surrey. His widow died on 24 May 1837.<br>
