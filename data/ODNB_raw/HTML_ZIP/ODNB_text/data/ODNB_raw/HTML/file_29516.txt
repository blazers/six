<span class="headword">Williams,  John</span>  (1633<span class="mult">x</span>6&#150;1709), <span class="occ">bishop of Chichester</span>, was born in Northamptonshire; his parents are unknown. He matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, as a plebeian, aged about seventeen, either in 1651 or in 1653; he graduated BA in 1655 and MA in 1658. He was incorporated at Cambridge in 1660, where he was created DD in 1690, <i>comitiis regiis</i>. In 1660 he also became the rector of St Peter Paul's Wharf. He was instituted rector both of St Mildred Poultry, London, and St Mary Colechurch in 1673. He was preferred to the prebend of Rugmere in St Paul's in 1683 and was appointed as chaplain-in-ordinary to William III soon after the revolution of 1688&#150;9. He was subsequently made a prebendary of Canterbury Cathedral and in 1696 was appointed bishop of Chichester.<br>
<br>Williams was a prolific writer and controversialist, though most of his important publications were produced before he attained his bishopric. Underlying most of his writings was a firm adherence to protestantism. He spent much of his time defending the Church of England against the aspersions of Catholic authors. In work after work he strove to define the difference between the Anglicans (who he maintained were clearly protestant) and the Catholics. He averred that though there were some commonalities between the Church of Rome and the Church of England as Catholic authors of his time had claimed, there were still significant disparities, and Anglican clergy more often than not were correct when they decried the errors of Catholicism from their pulpits. Thus Williams rhetorically asked, &#145;But what if after all, this <i>Pulpit-Popery</i> is true Popery; and that nothing is charged them as a Principle, but what the Pulpits learn'd from themselves&#146;  (Williams, <span class="italic">Pulpit-Popery</span>, 5). &#145;Pulpit popery&#146; was &#145;true popery&#146;. Williams's political perspective was also shaped by his commitment to protestantism. In 1679, and again in 1681, he published a book that argued that the Popish Plot was a genuine, nefarious Catholic conspiracy reminiscent of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, and that it demonstrated that the English needed to remain vigilant against the threat of popery. He also seems to have favoured the <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span>. After the bill failed and James II acceded to the throne Williams was roundly criticized for his thanksgiving sermon on the occasion of the defeat of the duke of Monmouth because he took for a text &#145;We must not do Evil that Good may come&#146; thereby implying that the removal of James would be a good end, even if rebellion was not the means by which it should be achieved  (J. Williams, <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached July 26, 1685, being the Day of Publick Thanksgiving for the Late Victory over the Rebels</span>, 1685, i&#150;vi). Williams had no sympathy for nonjurors at the time of the revolution either: he argued that they were nothing more than schismatics  (J. Williams, <span class="italic">A Vindication of a Discourse Concerning the Unreasonableness of a New Separation on Account of the Oaths</span>, 1691).<br>
<br>Williams was the Boyle lecturer for 1695 and 1696. His lectures, which were published separately as they were delivered, focused on the validity of scripture as genuine revelation, the adequacy of scripture as religious authority (without the need of an infallible interpreter like the pope), and the unreasonableness of infidelity and heterodoxy. John Evelyn seemed quite pleased with Williams's lectures: after the 1695 series he voted that Williams be again selected for the 1696 lectures.<br>
<br>Williams's success as a Boyle lecturer undoubtedly influenced the decision to elevate him to the bishopric of Chichester, which was done in 1696. He remained bishop of Chichester until his death at Gray's Inn, London, on 24 April 1709. He was buried in the church of St Mildred Poultry, and was survived by his daughter Elizabeth, who was unmarried at the time of his death.<br>
<br>Many prominent clergymen thought highly of Williams. Gilbert Burnet considered him a moderate and judicious clergyman, who was in no small part responsible for keeping the church on a steady course when the winds of controversy threatened disaster. Archbishop Tillotson, whom Williams defended against accusations of Socianism and in whose comprehension scheme he participated, considered him &#145;one of the best men I know, and most unwearied in doing good, and his preaching is very weighty and judicious&#146;  (Birch, 210). Williams's works were popular. His <span class="italic">Brief Exposition of Church-Catechism</span> (1689) went through at least twenty-seven editions, and was in print until the late eighteenth century.<br>
