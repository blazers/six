<span class="headword">Cheriton,  Odo  of</span>  (1180s&#150;1246), <span class="occ">author and scholar</span>, was born in Kent in the 1180s, into a wealthy Anglo-Norman family originally settled at Cheriton near Folkestone by a founding Odo, recorded as being kin to the then archbishop of Canterbury. His father, William of Cheriton, grandson of this first Lord Odo, enjoyed the considerable inheritance that his own father (also William) had ensured for the family by his marriage to an heiress of the Fitz Helt barony, and soon moved into the manor of Farningham in west Kent with his wife, Matilda, and their children. William was an active, powerful lord: he spent three years from 1190 with King Richard on the third crusade, and was an important figure after 1200, increasing in wealth as he expanded his estate, and enjoying a long life well into the new century (he died in 1232 or 1233).<br>
<br>The career of his eldest son, however, was to move in radically different spheres. In 1200 young Odo was a student at the University of Paris; formally referred to from 1210 onwards as <i>magister</i>, he seems to have spent the best part of twenty years studying, teaching, and preaching in the French capital, becoming a master in the university's pre-eminent school of theology. There, acquainted with such luminaries as Peter of Capua, Robert de Courson and possibly the great exemplist Caesarius of Heisterbach, Odo was ideally situated, at a time of increasing intellectual ferment, to digest the compendious amount of religious and didactic source material that he would incorporate into his various writings, together with his keen sense of personal observation and experience. He also travelled widely through France and beyond, both as pilgrim and master, the stuff of his sermons often catering for students of theology south of the Loire (quite possibly in Toulouse, in the orthodox wake of the Albigensian crusade), and over the Pyrenees into Spain, where he was clearly a recognized figure. Although attempts have been made to associate him with various religious orders, these are ill-founded: his interest in the Cistercians seems to centre on money owed him by the abbey of Bonport, near Rouen (in his sermons he actually criticizes the order for its avarice and corruption); and while he is far more approving of the Dominicans, it is&#151;like his French contemporary Guiot de Provins&#151;as an outsider, welcoming the evangelism of the new preaching friars.<br>
<br>In 1232&#150;3 Odo of Cheriton returned more permanently to England, to enter at last into his inheritance on the death of his father, William, and was duly seised of the considerable family lands. However, although the master had now become a lord, Odo's scholarly theological work was not completely at an end: his final work of clerical instruction dates from this period, and there is some evidence of later revision of some of his previous sermon material. Indeed, as the new feudal head of his household, Odo appears somewhat to have lacked his father's taste for activity and acquisition. He was exempted from serving with Henry III in Ireland, and records show him as more than willing to make over to others parts of the Cheriton estate. He died before 15 October 1246 and was buried in Rochester Cathedral; his brother Waleran of Cheriton was declared his heir.<br>
<br>It is perhaps indicative of Master Odo's true vocation that his only extant seal shows his namesake and patron saint Odo of Cluny seated at a writing-desk: certainly it is on his extensive writings that his reputation stands. His earliest works, composed before 1219, are two treatises, one on the Lord's prayer, the other on the passion. By the end of the year 1219 he had completed the first of three extant sets of sermons, the <span class="italic">Sermones de tempore</span> (or <span class="italic">Dominicales</span>), on the gospel texts for the year. These sixty-six sermons, based on Odo's own preaching and addressed in the main to students of theology, contain the blend of erudition, <i>exemplum</i>, and lively personal anecdote that is the Cheriton signature. Dating from 1224 are his <span class="italic">Sermones de epistolis</span> (or <span class="italic">Sermones de sanctis</span>) devoted to the epistles for saints' days, many of which are clearly tailored to a Spanish audience. Two years later he wrote an exposition on the <span class="roman">Song of Songs</span> (this <span class="italic">Super cantica canticorum</span> surviving in a single Spanish manuscript, proof again of his Peninsular activities). The contents of his third sermon collection, some twenty pieces for feast days (<span class="italic">Sermones de festis</span>), date from this same period, and show the preacher moving up from Spain into the south of France. It was during his travels that Odo began to gather material for what was to prove his most popular work: a collection of fables (his <span class="italic">Narrationes</span> or <span class="italic">Parabolae</span>, preserved in many manuscripts all over Europe). These improving tales (serving both as individual resources for preachers and as a moral encyclopaedia in its own right), are a highly readable mixture of bestiary, Aesopic fable, and Reynard beast epic, studded with lively English and Anglo-Norman tags and maxims that complement well the regular citations from the <span class="roman">Vulgate</span>. Odo's last and most seriously didactic work was composed after 1235: it is a <span class="italic">Summa de penitencia</span>, a confessional handbook for priests, inspired by the Spanish scholar Ram&oacute;n de Pe&ntilde;aforte's <span class="italic">Summa</span> and stressing the triple process of confession, contrition, and absolution. Odo of Cheriton's influence may be found in a number of subsequent <i>exempla</i> collections that make use of his writings: the work of the French preacher &Eacute;tienne de Bourbon and of the Anglo-Norman Franciscan Nicholas Bozon; the late thirteenth-century English <span class="italic">Speculum laicorum</span>; and the fourteenth-century Anglo-German <span class="italic">Gesta Romanorum</span>. His fables also exist in later French and Spanish versions. Odo's life and career are notable examples both of the flowering of preaching throughout western Europe following the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 and the emergence of the mendicant friars, and of the intertwining of the secular and the religious in thirteenth-century English society.<br>
