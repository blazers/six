<span class="headword">Owen,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Owain Alaw]</span>  (1821&#150;1883), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born in Crane Street, Chester, on 14 November 1821. Both his parents were natives of Llanfachraeth, Merioneth, but had settled in Chester shortly before his birth; his father was the captain of a small vessel. Owen was initially apprenticed to a firm of cutlers, Messrs Powell and Edwards, but in 1844, having shown considerable aptitude for music, he gave up business and became a professional musician. He was subsequently organist of, in succession, Lady Huntingdon's chapel, St Paul's, Broughton, St Bridget's, St Mary's, and the Welsh church (all in Chester), and at the same time gave tuition in music.<br>
<br>It was, however, in connection with the eisteddfod that Owen attracted the attention of his fellow countrymen. His success in winning the prize for the best anthem at the Rhuddlan eisteddfod in 1851 with &#145;Deborah a Barac&#146; was the first of a series of victories which gave &#145;Owain Alaw&#146; a recognized place among Welsh musicians. He devoted himself energetically to composition, and during the next few years wrote a large number of glees, songs, and anthems, published in various Welsh musical magazines of the time. His only attempts at more ambitious works were the cantatas <span class="italic">Tywysog Cymru</span> (1862), the first Welsh secular cantata, and <span class="italic">G&#373;yl Gwalia</span> (1866); the oratorio <span class="italic">Jeremiah</span> (1878) has been called his &#145;greatest work&#146;  (<span class="italic">DWB</span>). In 1860 he edited the first number of <span class="italic">Gems of Welsh Melody</span>, a collection of Welsh airs, published in four numbers in Ruthin. <span class="italic">The Welsh Harp: a Selection of Welsh National Songs</span> appeared in 1871, and Owen also made arrangements of songs by celebrated composers, including Mendelssohn and Weber. His fluent and melodious style of composition made him one of the most popular of Welsh musicians, and he was also much in demand as a conductor and adjudicator.<br>
<br>In 1842 he married a Miss Williams of Chester, and their son, William Henry, was born in 1845; he was an organist in Dublin before being killed in a railway accident at Abergele on 20 August 1868. Some of his anthems were published in Welsh by his father. John Owen died in Chester during the night of 29/30 January 1883, and was buried there in the old cemetery.<br>
