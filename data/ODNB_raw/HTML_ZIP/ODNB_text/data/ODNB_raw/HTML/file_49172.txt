<span class="headword">Evance, Sir  Stephen</span>  (1654/5&#150;1712), <span class="occ">goldsmith and entrepreneur</span>, was born at New Haven, New England, the son of John Evance, a London merchant who had emigrated to Virginia in 1635 and traded with the Caribbean islands. Evance presumably spent his youth in New England but in 1669, when he was fourteen and perhaps as a result of his father's recent death, he was sent to London as an apprentice to the Goldsmiths' Company. He prospered there, being admitted a freeman of the company in 1676 and elected prime warden in 1691. During these years he became acquainted with leading figures in many of the larger trading companies, notably the Hudson's Bay Company, for which by 1681 he had become the principal cashier, responsible for most of its financial transactions. His work for the company concentrated on the sale of North American furs, and on establishing trade with Russia in furs and hemp. Within twenty years he owned more than &pound;4300 in stock, but his own considerable loans to the company, on which it often depended to remain solvent, were frequently jeopardized by late or incomplete reimbursements. The profits from his investments, when paid, were dispersed among diverse business interests, which included leasing a trading ship, purchasing stock in the White Paper Makers', Royal African, and East India companies, financing various schemes for manufacturing steel, guns, and hollow sword blades, exploiting royal copper mines in New England, and developing a newly invented air pump to allow divers to salvage wrecks.<br>
<br>From 1689 Evance became one of the crown's main domestic lenders. In that year alone he raised loans to the crown amounting to &pound;175,000, and in addition supported the government's commitments to supplying armies in Ireland and Flanders, and provided subsidies for the allies in Europe. He was able to finance these enterprises by drawing bills of exchange on the Amsterdam market while accepting payment in the form of government debt. Evance was rewarded for these endeavours by a knighthood and several gifts of money, as well as being appointed the king's jeweller and a commissioner of excise and wine licences.<br>
<br>His support for the government would explain Evance's return to parliament in 1690 for Bridport, a borough recently granted a new charter and comprising a reduced corporation purged of all court opponents. Outside the house, Evance's natural opposition to the formation of the Bank of England, which threatened his financial activities, was criticized by the lords justices, but this posed no immediate threat to his importance as a financier and man of business. However, early the following year he was censured for accusing two of his fellow excise commissioners of Jacobitism, and when he was threatened with a prosecution for defamation his backers considered that his financial usefulness to the government was outweighed by both his political liability and emerging evidence of irregularities in his government contracts; by the summer he had been removed from the excise commission.<br>
<br>Evance's political career was swiftly terminated by this crisis but his involvement in public life, and in a variety of entrepreneurial schemes supported by his business contacts, continued to occupy him. In 1700 he was appointed, for the second time, governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, and the following year he led a consortium to raise a voluntary subscription of &pound;1 million to create a company manufacturing woollen goods. He also attempted to secure a private bill for the company's incorporation. By 1702 Evance's private trading had brought him into contact with Thomas Pitt, governor of Madras, and the latter's son Robert, and when Robert returned from Madras with his father's celebrated diamond Evance was chosen as its custodian. Soon afterwards Evance embarked on an unsuccessful speculative enterprise insuring merchants, but as his losses overwhelmed him so did his business partners desert him. He was declared bankrupt early in January 1712, reputedly owing more than &pound;100,000. On 5 March, at Woodford, in the house of Sir Caesar Child, a relative, he hanged himself from an attic window. He was unmarried, and his remaining stock, held in trust for him and amounting to &pound;4000, was settled on his niece.<br>
