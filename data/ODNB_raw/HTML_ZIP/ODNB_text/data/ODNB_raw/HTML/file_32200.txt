<span class="headword">Burt,  Thomas</span>  (1837&#150;1922), <span class="occ">trade union leader and politician</span>, was born on 12 November 1837 at Murton Row near North Shields, the elder of two sons of Peter Burt, coal-miner, and his wife, Rebecca, daughter of Thomas Weatherburn, colliery engineman. He had twin sisters who died in infancy and a brother who predeceased him at the age of thirty-three. Burt's father moved to the Durham coalfield with his family in 1844 after being victimized for taking part in trade union activities. Burt received little formal education, but became an avid reader during his late teenage years, and attributed much of the learning that he did acquire to the interest shown in him by his maternal grandfather.<br>
<br>Burt began work underground at the age of ten, first as a trapper and then as a pony driver, and worked in a number of local collieries before returning with his family to Northumberland, where he was a hewer at various collieries around Cramlingon and Choppington. He became involved in trade unionism from the age of about sixteen, was victimized, and joined the Northumberland and Durham Mutual Confidence Association when it was founded in 1863. He became delegate for Choppington, moved the resolution that led to the secession of Northumberland from the association in 1865, and was elected full-time secretary and agent of the new Northumberland Miners' Mutual Confident Association, remaining secretary until 1905 and agent until 1913.<br>
<br>These were the years that saw the formation and growth of county mining unions, the foundation of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain, and the adoption (and abandonment) of the system of tying wages to selling-price sliding scales, but Burt remained firmly wedded to the principles of industrial co-operation and class harmony which he had advocated since the beginning of his career. It was his adherence to these principles that explains Burt's refusal to join the Labour Party, and helps to explain the strained relations that developed between the Northumberland Miners' Mutual Confident Association and the Miners' Federation of Great Britain: Burt and his colleagues, unlike the leaders of the federation, continued to believe that the sliding scale, or some form of arbitration or conciliation, provided the best way of dealing with the north-east coalfield's particular sensitivity to changing market conditions.<br>
<br>In 1873 Burt was adopted as the Liberal candidate for Morpeth, and in the following year he was returned as MP, retaining the seat for forty-four years until his retirement in 1918, by which time he had become the &#145;father of the House&#146;. Like other radicals, Burt supported issues such as Irish home rule, household suffrage, the reform of trade union law, and the disestablishment of the Church of England. He was a member of several parliamentary committees and commissions (including the royal commission on accidents in mines, 1879&#150;86, the royal commission on mining royalties, 1890&#150;91, and the royal commission on labour, 1891&#150;4); he was parliamentary secretary to the Board of Trade between 1892 and 1895; and he was made a privy councillor in 1906. His career &#145;illustrates better than [that of] almost any other labour leader the phenomenon of the Liberal&#150;Labour alliance in the closing decades of the nineteenth century&#146;  (Bing and Saville, 61).<br>
<br>Unlike many other miners' leaders, Burt was physically frail, and he was described, by supporters and opponents alike, as meek, gentle, and pacific. He turned down several opportunities to augment his income, but received an annuity under the will of his friend Andrew Carnegie, who died in 1919. He married his cousin, Mary Weatherburn, in 1860 and they had four sons and four daughters. He described his wife, who predeceased him, as a &#145;daughter of the people&#146;, who was &#145;in complete sympathy with my public work, and throughout what was destined to be a long, happy married life &hellip; proved in every sense a brave and loving helpmate&#146;  (Burt, 139). Burt died at his home, 20 Burdon Terrace, Newcastle upon Tyne, on 12 April 1922, having been bedridden for three years, and was buried in Jesmond cemetery, Newcastle, on 19 April.<br>
