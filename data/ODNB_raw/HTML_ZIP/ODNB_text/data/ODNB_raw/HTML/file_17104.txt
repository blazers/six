<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lowth,  Robert</span>  (1710&#150;1787), <span class="occ">biblical critic and bishop of London</span>, was born in his father's house in the cathedral close at Winchester on 27 November 1710. He was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17106/', "William Lowth (1661&#150;1732)")</script>, prebendary of Winchester, and his wife, Margaret (<i>fl</i>. 1675&#150;1735), daughter of Robert Pitt of Blandford, Dorset. He attended Winchester College, as a scholar, from November 1721 until September 1729. He matriculated as a commoner at St John's College, Oxford, on 26 March 1729 but was admitted as a scholar at New College in January 1730. He graduated BA in October 1733 and MA in June 1737, and became a fellow of New College.<br>
<br>Lowth made a name for himself as a very young man through his composition of verses in both English and Latin. To the pious stanzas that he wrote in his bed at the age of fourteen, &#145;On a Thunder Storm by Night&#146;, he soon added a poem (printed in 1729) on the genealogy of Christ as displayed in the east window of Winchester College chapel, and another, written as a school exercise, &#145;Katherine-Hill, Near Winchester&#146;, in which he turned a consideration of the place where he played as a schoolboy into an elegy on the fate of Charles I and of Winchester during the civil war. Lowth's career as a poet developed at Oxford, where he published Latin verses in several collections of poetry from the university, as well as in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. His poem <span class="italic">The Judgment of Hercules</span> was printed in 1743. Conservative in tone and essentially predictable in style, Lowth's poetry nevertheless commanded the attention of Christopher Pitt and Joseph Spence; it was frequently anthologized later in his life. Yet it was Lowth's skill as a critic, not a writer, of verse that would win him genuine and widespread fame.<br>
<br>In June 1741 Lowth was elected professor of poetry at Oxford, a chair that Spence had held. Re-elected in 1746, he served for a total of ten years, in the course of which he delivered the thirty-four <span class="italic">Praelectiones de sacra poesi Hebraeorum</span> that were to make his name. Published in 1753, together with a short confutation of Bishop Francis Hare's system of metre, Lowth's lectures established a new method for reading and understanding those passages of the Hebrew <span class="roman">Bible</span>, such as the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> and many of the writings of the prophets, that were traditionally considered as verse, as well as a means to expand and define the canon of biblical poetry. Building on the work of contemporary Oxford scholars, notably Thomas Hunt, Lowth urged the importance of setting biblical poetry in the context of oriental rather than classical style and the impossibility of ever determining the ancient vocalization of the Hebrew <span class="roman">Bible</span> with sufficient accuracy to identify its true metrical structure. In place of metre Lowth argued that the structure of Hebrew verse could be identified by its often parabolic or figurative mode of expression, and in particular by the parallelisms, or repetitions of similar words or phrases, sometimes in a regular order, sometimes not, that gave rhythm to Hebrew poetry and song, and served almost as an alternative to metre. Using these critical tools Lowth also tried to identify a sublime, and divinely inspired, quality in Hebrew verse.<br>
<br>In December 1741, shortly after his election as professor of poetry, Lowth was ordained deacon by Bishop Thomas Secker; he became a priest in December 1742. In July 1744 Bishop Benjamin Hoadly collated him to the rectory of Ovington, Hampshire, and in August 1750 promoted him archdeacon of Winchester, adding the rectory of East Woodhay to his preferments in June 1753. The University of Oxford created him DD by diploma on 18 July 1754. In March 1748 Lowth travelled with the embassy of Henry Bilson-Legge to Berlin, where he took the opportunity to instruct Frederick the Great, king of Prussia, about the principal English poets. He returned in February 1749 but was soon travelling again with lords George and Frederick Cavendish, sons of William Cavendish, third duke of Devonshire. They journeyed together through France and Italy, visiting Herculaneum in the spring of 1750. Lowth thus established firm connections with prominent whig noblemen and with influential figures in the ministry. He also cemented his own place in the life of his native county. On 26 December 1752 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1803), daughter and heir of Laurence Jackson of Christchurch, Hampshire, in the process securing substantial property and a considerable fortune. Despite the careful financial arrangements that preceded it this seems also to have been a loving marriage, and Lowth evidently took pleasure in the family that resulted. Two sons and five daughters were born between December 1753 and June 1765, but Lowth's later life was increasingly tinged by sadness as a result of the premature deaths of some of his children, of whom only Martha (1760&#150;1812) and Robert (1762&#150;1822), later vicar of Halstead, in Essex, and prebendary of St Paul's, survived their father. In 1768 Lowth composed a moving epitaph on the death of his eldest daughter, Mary, whom he had celebrated as &#145;a little brown Beauty&#146; after her birth in 1755  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. lett. c. 572, fols. 66&#150;7).<br>
<br>In spite of his personal success Lowth complained in March 1755 that &#145;my affairs seem to be at a dead stand&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. lett. c. 572, fol. 9<i>r</i>). As a result he felt bound to accept appointment as chaplain to William Cavendish, then marquess of Hartington, who was appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland in 1755. He extracted a promise that Hartington would intercede with Thomas Pelham-Holles, duke of Newcastle, then prime minister, to exchange any Irish preferment that Lowth might obtain for a suitable position at home. Lowth sailed for Dublin in May 1755, by which time Hartington was pursuing another scheme that would allow Lowth to change places with someone who would have liked an Irish bishopric &#145;&amp; had the wherewithal to pay well for it&#146;  (ibid., fols. 15&#150;16). Lowth was granted the freedom of Limerick in June 1755 and soon afterwards Hartington's plans began to bear fruit. Protracted negotiations involving Joseph Butler, bishop of Durham, and Benjamin Hoadly, bishop of Winchester, as well as the duke of Newcastle eventually resulted in the appointment of James Leslie as bishop of Limerick, an office that Lowth had declined, and the transfer to Lowth of a prebendal stall at Durham. In place of Leslie's other preferments Lowth was granted the valuable living of Sedgefield. He took up his new positions and moved to co. Durham in October 1755, purchasing a post-chaise to facilitate communication with his family in Hampshire. Through Hartington, who had become duke of Devonshire, he was appointed a royal chaplain on 18 August 1757. Lowth was now free to pursue literary and theological controversy, and although further preferment took some time he was also set on a significant career within the Church of England. He was considered a candidate to be warden of Winchester College in 1764. In 1765 he became a fellow of both the Royal Society of London and that of G&ouml;ttingen. On 15 June 1766, as one of the final beneficiaries of Newcastle's ecclesiastical patronage, he was consecrated bishop of St David's. On 16 October, however, he was translated to the see of Oxford, and on 12 April 1777 he was nominated bishop of London. He was made dean of the Chapel Royal, was sworn of the privy council, and from 1786 was a member of the committee for trade and plantations. He was also a governor of the Charterhouse and a trustee of the British Museum. On the death of Frederick Cornwallis, archbishop of Canterbury, in 1783, he declined the offer of the primacy.<br>
<br>Although Lowth had been astute in the pursuit of worldly success, and of the patronage necessary to achieve it, he was nevertheless a dedicated and effective churchman and administrator. He preached regularly, and although his conclusions were often predictable the subjects that he tackled were sometimes controversial ones, such as the importance of instructing African slaves in Christian religion or the need to overcome the weakening of the constitution by &#145;a general national depravity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sermons, and other Remains, of Robert Lowth</span>, 194). Richard Price attacked Lowth's Ash Wednesday sermon in 1779, arguing that he had abandoned the concern with freedom and the constitution that had been expressed in some of his earlier sermons, but others praised his love of liberty. More significant than Lowth's preaching, however, was his concern for the godly administration of the church. He was an efficient archdeacon, and as bishop of London conducted a campaign in the early 1780s against the practice of some lay patrons in forcing clergymen to accept bonds of resignation before instituting them to their livings. After legal battles lasting two and a half years the House of Lords finally ruled in Lowth's favour, upholding the principle that the beneficed clergy should be able to act as freeholders, without obligation to their patrons. Like Secker he was amenable to the revision of the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> and showed some sympathy for those who felt unable to subscribe to their current form. More significantly Secker drew on Lowth's learning for support in his efforts to promote a revision of the Authorized Version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, a project that Lowth continued to encourage after his own consecration as bishop. His reputation for scholarship and good sense ensured that individuals as different from one another as John Wesley and Alexander Geddes could enjoy his company and regard him as sympathetic and encouraging to some of their ideas. He was a prominent supporter of Benjamin Kennicott's collation of Hebrew manuscripts of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and, later, of Robert Holmes's work on the text of the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span>.<br>
<br>To other eyes, however, Lowth's career was marred by his tenacity in controversy. <span class="italic">The Life of William of Wykeham</span>, which first appeared in 1758 and was based on considerable research in the Winchester archives, contained a dedication to Lowth's patron, Bishop Hoadly, that reignited debate over Hoadly's role in the election of Christopher Golding as warden of Winchester College and led to a sharp exchange of pamphlets. Lowth's care in revising subsequent editions of this biography, in 1759 and 1777, did not extend to any softening of his support for Hoadly. His Hebrew scholarship won him many admirers, especially among his contemporaries at Oxford and at the University of G&ouml;ttingen, where J. D. Michaelis in particular championed his interpretation. Michaelis added his own notes to an edition of Lowth's <span class="italic">Praelectiones</span> (1758&#150;61), which were included in the translation by George Gregory, published in 1787. But the regard for Lowth's work in Germany and, following its translation in 1812, in France did not lessen the offence that it gave to some English critics. His attack on Bishop Hare generated a hostile reception, notably from Thomas Edwards, to which he characteristically responded by amplifying his criticisms in <span class="italic">A Larger Confutation of Bishop Hare's System of Hebrew Metre</span> (1766).<br>
<br>More heat and less light were produced by the quarrel that ensued with William Warburton and his followers as a result of Lowth's remarks in the <span class="italic">Praelectiones</span> about the punishment of idolatry by the civil power among the ancient Hebrews. Lowth's arguments called into question some of the conclusions of Warburton's <span class="italic">Divine Legation of Moses</span>. A long correspondence developed in 1756, into which Warburton's criticisms of the work of Lowth's father were drawn. The dispute eventually appeared to have been settled but it was reignited by Warburton's comments on <span class="roman">Job</span> in the appendix to the sixth book of the <span class="italic">Divine Legation</span>. As part of his reply Lowth printed the correspondence from 1756, angering Warburton, who objected to the publication of private letters, and generating a torrent of pamphlets from his friends. By the summer of 1766 Secker was concerned about the open and petty quarrel between two of his most prominent churchmen and struggled to bring about a rapprochement that recognized &#145;the Relation, in which you are soon to stand, as Bishops in the same Church, obliged frequently to meet &amp; act together&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 42560, fols. 147&#150;8). Nevertheless Warburton's followers continued to worry at the sore that had been created, and as late as 1796 were still trying to retaliate for the injury inflicted on their champion.<br>
<br>In 1762 Lowth published <span class="italic">A Short Introduction to English Grammar</span>, in which he extolled the simplicity of the form and construction of the English language while remarking that it could still not rival the most ancient of languages, Hebrew, in this respect. Lowth intended his work to provide a succinct guide to grammar and to overcome imperfect or imprecise usage, even when found in the Authorized Version of the English <span class="roman">Bible</span>. It proved immensely popular in both Britain and America and was republished dozens of times during the eighteenth century alone; more than 34,000 copies had been printed by 1781. A German translation with critical notes by Christian Heinrich Reichel appeared in 1790. The most substantial of Lowth's publications was his new translation, with notes, of the book of <span class="roman">Isaiah</span>. This came out in 1778, with a second edition in the following year. It enabled Lowth to work out his interpretations of the form and structure of Hebrew poetry, as well as to set out his conjectures about the original text and his opinions about its translation. It was the first and most successful example of a short-lived genre of biblical criticism and commentary that was emulated by several Oxford scholars and that owed much to Secker's desire that there should be progress towards a new English translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. A German translation by Johann Benjamin Koppe, a professor of theology at G&ouml;ttingen, appeared between 1779 and 1781. As usual, however, Lowth's work proved controversial; David Kocher in particular attacked Lowth's doubts about the value of vowel points for an understanding of the Hebrew text. When selections from Lowth's <span class="italic">Isaiah</span> were published in parts by the Society for Promoting the Knowledge of the Scriptures in the mid-1780s they were criticized by Michael Dodson.<br>
<br>In his old age Lowth was hampered by fits of bladder and gall stones, and he became incapable of travel. He died at Fulham Palace, London, between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. on 3 November 1787, probably following a stroke, and was buried at Fulham church on 12 November. He had already given the copyright in his lectures on Hebrew poetry to the University of Oxford, and that in his life of William of Wykeham to New College, Oxford. His will honoured the terms of the trust set up when he married.<br>
