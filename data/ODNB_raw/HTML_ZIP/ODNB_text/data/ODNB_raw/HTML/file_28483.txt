<span class="headword">Walker,  George</span>  (1803&#150;1879), <span class="occ">writer on chess</span>, was born in Great Portland Street, London, on 20 March 1803 and baptized at St Marylebone on 17 April. He was the son of the novelist and publisher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28482/', "George Walker (1772&#150;1847)")</script>. Working in his father's music publishing business at 17 Soho Square, he was a partner by 1836. On 1 November 1827 he married Maria Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Oxley (1801/2&#150;1864). After his father's death George Walker went on to the stock exchange, where he practised until 1873 in partnership with William Bull.<br>
<br>As a chess player Walker was bright without being extremely brilliant. His recorded games with masters show that he was an adept in developing his pieces and making exchanges, but he admits that players of the strength of Morphy or Macdonnell could always give him the odds of the pawn and move. His particular hero was Labourdonnais, whom he tended in his last illness, and buried at his own expense in Kensal Green cemetery (December 1840). Walker wrote a memoir of the &#145;roi d'&eacute;checs&#146; for <span class="italic">Bell's Life</span>, which was translated for the Parisian <span class="italic">Palam&egrave;de</span> (15 Dec 1841) as &#145;Derniers moments de Labourdonnais&#146;. From 1840 to 1847, when he ceased playing first-rate chess, Walker was inferior only to Buckle and Staunton among English players.<br>
<br>More significant, however, were Walker's administrative and literary activities. As a young man he founded the Percy chess club in Rathbone Place in 1823; impressed by defeats at the hands of William Lewis, he defected to the latter's chess school. He was a prime mover in the Westminster chess club (1831&#150;43; secretary to 1838)&#151;host to the Macdonnell&#150;Labourdonnais match at Bedford Street, Covent Garden, and later based in the Strand&#151;and helped resurrect it in the form of the St George's club, before the enmity of Howard Staunton caused him to migrate to the London chess club. Walker's long-running chess column in <span class="italic">Bell's Life in London</span> (1835&#150;73) has been described as his &#145;real service to chess&#146;  (Harding, 364), particularly in the column's early years, when he was almost alone as an advocate of the game. In 1838 he sought to start a specialist magazine (<span class="italic">The Philidorian</span>).<br>
<br>As a writer on the game, George Walker's reputation was European, although the <span class="italic">Oxford Companion to Chess</span> now considers his work &#145;more enthusiastic than accurate&#146;  (Hooper and Whyld, 444&#150;5). His production of cheap books had a significant publicizing role. &#145;No writer has produced so many books upon the subject of chess as Mr. Walker&#146;  (<span class="italic">ILN</span>, 427). His first publication, a pamphlet of twenty-four pages, <span class="italic">New Variations in the Muzio Gambit</span> (1831), was followed in less than a year by his <span class="italic">New Treatise</span> (reprinted thrice to 1846), which gradually supplanted the chess <span class="italic">Studies</span> of Peter Pratt (1803) and the far from thorough <span class="italic">Treatise</span> by J. H. Sarratt (1808), as amended by Lewis in 1821; a German translation of the <span class="italic">New Treatise</span> went through several editions. Walker's <span class="italic">Chess Studies, Comprising one Thousand Games actually Played during the Last Half-Century</span> (1844), also an improvement on Lewis's previous work, was re-edited by E. Freeborough in 1893; it finally established the principle that games of major masters (even quite casual ones) should be recorded. The year 1847 largely saw the end of Walker's writing. He is to be distinguished from William Greenwood Walker, who published <span class="italic">A Selection of Games at Chess</span> in 1836.<br>
<br>Walker died at his home, 40 Albion Road, Stoke Newington, London, on 23 April 1879, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. He was survived by his second wife, Matilda (<i>b</i>. 1840/1).<br>
