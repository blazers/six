<span class="headword">Lacy,  Peter</span>, Count Lacy in the nobility of the Holy Roman empire  (1678&#150;1751), <span class="occ">army officer in the Russian service</span>, was born in Killeedy, co. Limerick, Ireland, on 29 September 1678, the son of Peter Lacy (Pierce de Lacy) of Coylross and his wife, Maria de Courtenay. His military career dates from 1691, when at the age of just thirteen he saw action as an ensign at the second siege of Limerick. Following five years in French service he entered that of Peter the Great, being among the first group of 100 western European officers recruited in 1700 at the start of Russia's Great Northern War against Charles XII of Sweden. The talent Lacy showed in the earliest Russian campaign in the Baltic territories of Livonia and Ingria ensured him rapid promotion: from captain in 1701 to colonel in 1708. In 1706 he was given command of the Polotsky regiment as well as three newly raised regiments to train. In December 1708 he attacked and captured the headquarters of Charles XII at Rumna, and the delighted tsar rewarded Lacy with the prestigious command of a grenadier regiment. He went on to become &#145;one of the most famous soldiers of the 18th century. Indeed no Irish family has attained greater fame in the military history of Europe&#146;  (MacLysaght, 205).<br>
<br>In July 1709, at the battle of Poltava, the Swedes lost to a Russian army twice their size, thereby precipitating their eventual defeat. Lacy's advice to the tsar on musketry methods is said to have played a decisive role in Russia's celebrated victory. Crucially, he insisted that the musketeers should hold their fire until coming within a few yards of the enemy. Consequently Charles was defeated and in one action lost the advantage of nine previous campaigns. In 1711 Lacy married Martha Philippine von Funcken, of the Livonian family of L&ouml;ser. They had five daughters and three sons: Peter Anthony, who became a general in the Polish service; Francis Maurice, an Austrian field marshal and chancellor of the Holy Roman empire; and Patrick Boris, a general of infantry.<br>
<br>In 1719, newly promoted to the rank of major-general, Lacy led a devastating raid on several Swedish coastal towns and villages. In a similar action two years later, by which time he was lieutenant-general in command of 5000 troops, he razed Sundsvall. This set-back was enough to prompt the Swedish negotiators at Nystadt to yield Livonia to Russia, thus affording her direct access to the Baltic Sea and so paving the way for the treaty of Nystadt, which was at last concluded in September 1721.<br>
<br>After Russia's victory over Sweden, Lacy's rise continued apace. In 1723 he became a member of the war college. In 1725 Catherine I made him a knight of the order of St Alexander Nevsky on the very day of its institution, 21 May. He was appointed general-in-chief of infantry and commander of all forces garrisoned in St Petersburg, Ingria, and Novgorod. In the general staff list for 1728 his name ranked third among the six full generals in the Russian army. As a foreigner, his annual salary was 3600 roubles whereas Russians received only 3120. A further indication of Lacy's standing at this time is the fact that his signature always occupied first place on war college reports to Catherine I.<br>
<br>In 1727 Lacy was ordered to expel Maurice de Saxe from the duchy of Courland. Maurice, much to Russia's irritation, had managed to have himself elected duke of Courland. The duchess of Courland was Anna, the daughter of Peter the Great's half-brother Ivan. She later became empress of Russia, on the death of Peter II in 1730. Her request to marry Maurice de Saxe had been rejected by Catherine I and led to the decision to expel him and his retinue from the duchy. Lacy's successful execution of this task confirmed him as the most influential foreigner at the Russian court. This position, however, was not without its dangers. Lacy was always careful to avoid court intrigue. Indeed, it is precisely to this quality that his remarkable survival throughout the &#145;era of palace revolutions&#146; is generally attributed. But his high standing caused resentment among the many ambitious Germans at the court of Empress Anna (1730&#150;40). The most powerful threat came from Burkhardt Munnich (Minikh), one of Anna's Courland favourites, who was determined to achieve sole authority over Russia's military affairs.<br>
<br>The rivalry between Lacy and Munnich grew when they saw action together in 1733 in the Russians' march on Warsaw in support of Augustus of Saxony's candidacy as king of Poland against that of Stanislas Leszczynski, who was supported by France. The ensuing War of the Polish Succession, which was concluded in 1735, gave both men the opportunity to display their military prowess. Of the two, in the view of the military historian Maslovsky, it was Lacy, overall commander of Russian forces in Poland, who had the better war. After successfully raising the siege of Danzig in 1733, Lacy further distinguished himself the following year at the battle of Wisiczin. Then, at the decisive battle of Busawitza, although outnumbered ten to one, he completely routed Leszczynski's forces. Following victory in the War of the Polish Succession, Lacy was created a knight of the order of the White Eagle of Poland by Augustus III. He spent the next two years assisting Augustus to consolidate his position as king of Poland, defeating counter-attacks in a series of remarkable actions. Lacy then visited Vienna, where he was warmly received by the emperor and empress and presented with gifts. It was on his return from the Austrian capital to St Petersburg that he was made a Russian field marshal. This was the first time in Russia's history that there had been two foreigners serving as field marshals in imperial service&#151;the other being Munnich.<br>
<br>Lacy's first mission as field marshal was to prepare for the siege of Azov in anticipation of the long-expected war with Turkey, which was waged from 1735 to 1739. During the ensuing siege he was wounded and fortunate not to fall into Turkish hands. Azov capitulated to Lacy's forces in July 1736.<br>
<br>In 1737 Lacy was appointed to the order of St Andrew and made commander of a new campaign to annex the Crimea. Two previous attempts to do so, Leontyev's in 1735 and Munnich's in 1736, had ended in failure. Lacy eagerly accepted this new challenge and rose to it with characteristic brilliance. To the astonishment of the Crimean khan, Lacy bridged the Azov Sea at a narrow point near Perekop. Within four days his entire army crossed it and began marching on Arabat. As one commentator wryly observed, &#145;the parallel to a well-known incident in the book of <span class="roman">Exodus</span> was sufficiently striking to make an immense impression upon the superstitious Russian soldiers&#146;  (Jane, 73). Then, on learning that the khan had reached Arabat before him, Lacy decided to spring a further surprise by fording the sea separating him from the rest of the Crimea. By the use of typically imaginative strategy Lacy successfully completed his mission. Nevertheless, the Crimea was not finally annexed to the Russian empire until 1783.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Lacy's relationship with Munnich deteriorated. The Irishman's achievements in the field, together with his popularity among his troops and at court, so antagonized the Courlander that on one occasion he drew his sabre and attacked Lacy. Fortunately, a third party, General Levashov, managed to separate the two field marshals before any serious damage could be done.<br>
<br>In 1740 Lacy was made a count, and in the spring of 1741 he was made commander of Russian forces in Finland mobilizing for renewed war with Sweden. Following Sweden's declaration of war that July, he advanced at the head of 30,000 troops on Villmanstrand and defeated its 11,000 Swedish defenders under General Wrangel. However, lack of reinforcements and supplies compelled him to return to St Petersburg. There, in December, Elizabeth, the daughter of Peter the Great, became empress literally overnight as a result of a palace revolt. Lacy, suddenly challenged to declare his support for Anna of Brunswick, regent for the boy emperor Ivan VI, or Elizabeth, judiciously indicated his support for &#145;the party of the reigning empress&#146;, an answer which apparently satisfied Elizabeth. Her accession brought down the so-called German party at court. Senior Courlanders, among them Ostermann, Biron, and Munnich, were disgraced and exiled. Lacy, however, became the principal field marshal in the Russian service. An immediate consequence of Elizabeth's policy of Russifying the court and the armed forces was an outbreak of xenophobic riots in the capital. Lacy promptly implemented a system of strict policing of army personnel in St Petersburg, thus averting potentially much more dangerous disturbances between Russian and foreign serving officers in the capital. After the three-month truce with Sweden following Elizabeth's accession, Lacy returned in June to Swedish Finland at the head of a large force. He took Fredrikshamn, which had been torched and abandoned by the Swedes. There was jubilation at the capture of what was the only fortified town in Swedish Finland without the loss of a single man. Lacy pursued the retreating Swedish army and eventually surrounded it near Helsingfors (Helsinki). He cut off its further retreat to Abo by leading his forces along an unmapped road which had been built during the campaigns of Peter the Great and was revealed to the field marshal by a Finnish peasant. The surprised Swedish army capitulated, leaving all Finland subject to the Russian empire. Lacy thus returned with renewed triumph to the Russian court.<br>
<br>In 1743 Lacy was made a senator. At the start of Russia's operations against Sweden in that year Elizabeth boarded the field marshal's ship in St Petersburg to present him with gifts and to bless his newest enterprise, which, in the event, was pre-empted by the treaty of Abo (August 1743). Once more he returned in triumph to St Petersburg, this time aboard a yacht sent by the empress herself. After the peace celebrations, which marked the culmination of his fifty years' active service, Lacy retired to his estates in Livonia as governor of the province, a post to which Peter II had originally appointed him back in 1729. Over the years Lacy had acquired a number of properties at Riga in Livonia, among them Grosser Rop, Alt-Kalzenau, Segewold, Lindenhof, and Dahlen. There he resided until his death, in Riga on 30 April 1751 at the age of seventy-two, survived by his wife. John Cook, the doctor who attended Lacy in his last months, recalled that the citizens of Riga so mourned the field marshal's death that &#145;they tolled their bells eight days&#146;  (Cook, 622). He left a large fortune (&pound;60,000 sterling) and sizeable estates, acquired, as his will states, by way of an epitaph, &#145;through long and hard service and with much danger and uneasiness&#146;  (ibid., 498).<br>
<br>Lacy was a popular commander who combined qualities of unusual ability and sound judgement. He had a notoriously quick temper, but, in the words of one English historian, &#145;he was generous to a fault, as brave as a lion and incapable of committing a mean action&#146;  (Bain, 219). In the course of his remarkable career he served five eighteenth-century sovereigns, and he partnered a sixth, the future Catherine II, at her wedding dance in 1745, when she was sixteen years old. Unquestionably his most affectionate imperial patron was Elizabeth. This is evident not only from the various attentions she showed him, but also from the fact that other foreign officers regarded him as the best channel for reaching the empress themselves. Moreover, when she was told that Lacy's health was improving (during what was to be his final illness), &#145;she expressed as great satisfaction as if he had been her father&#146;  (Cook, 617). What impressed Russians about Lacy was his loyalty to their country: &#145;He differed markedly from the other Russian commanders of foreign birth in that he always pursued Russia's interests, never his own&#146;  (<span class="italic">Russkii biograficheskii slovar</span>, 86). The admiration he aroused was typically expressed in a common soldier's view, as recorded by Sergey Solovyov: &#145;Even though he was a foreigner, he was a good man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Voennaya entsiklopediya</span>, 1914, 517). In 1891 a division of the Russian army&#151;the 13th Belozersky infantry regiment&#151;was named in his honour.<br>
