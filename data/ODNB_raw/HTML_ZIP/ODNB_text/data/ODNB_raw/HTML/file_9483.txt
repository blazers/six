<span class="headword">Firth,  Mark</span>  (1819&#150;1880), <span class="occ">steel manufacturer</span>, was born at Sheffield on 25 April 1819, the eldest son of Thomas Firth (1789&#150;1850), steel manufacturer. After education at Eadon's academy, Redhill, he joined his father in 1833 at Sanderson Brothers &amp; Co., where his father was chief smelter. His younger brother Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1858) followed, and in 1842 both left, setting up in steel smelting at Portobello works, Charlotte Street, Sheffield, with six employees and a six pothole furnace. They were joined by their father, and head smelter Joseph Bridden.<br>
<br>After slow beginnings trade expanded, with more than twenty-five employees of Thomas Firth &amp; Sons (as the business was called) by November 1846. Management and technical problems were handled by Firth's father and brother, while he sought sales. Their crucible steel and finished products obtained an enviable reputation, and sales outlets in North America, Europe, and Australia.<br>
<br>The Portobello works was soon outgrown, and in 1849 a new 13 acre Norfolk works was begun in Savile Street. Thomas Firth died in 1850, Mark Firth became head, and a third brother, John, joined the partnership. By September 1851 the Norfolk works consisted of file works, crucible furnaces, rolling mill, and Sheffield's biggest steam engine. By 1857 the business employed 500 men and joined Cammell's Cyclops and Brown's Atlas works in Sheffield's shift eastwards. Elsewhere they leased Claywheels forges at Wadsley Bridge (1849&#150;58) and after 1856 developed the 22 acre site at Whittington Moor, Chesterfield, complete with forge, rolling mills, iron refining, foundry facilities, air melting furnaces, and pattern and fitting shops. Tee sections and angles were rolled from puddled steel. Crucible steel depended still upon Swedish bar iron, landed at a wharf at Norfolk works.<br>
<br>Changing markets demanded responsiveness. File and edge tool sales to Russia weakened in the Crimean War, so Firth increased American sales, secured orders for crinoline hoops, then switched to armaments, specializing in gun tubes and projectiles. By 1860 Armstrongs, Vavasseurs, and Woolwich arsenal were major customers, and Whittington Moor sent steel telegraph poles to India, made other steel fabrications, and supplied plant for Sheffield. There a new West Gun works by 1863 produced bigger guns and shells, using two 25 ton steam hammers, on anvil blocks of 160 tons. Manufacture of edge tools and files was subsequently moved to Windsor Street, Sheffield, and rifle barrel production began with a few American machines. Forty or fifty new boring machines from Whittington Moor subsequently replaced them with capacity to make 300 barrels a day.<br>
<br>With Vickers Brothers, Firths became the biggest crucible steel maker in Sheffield. Projectile and gun sizes grew, from 68 lb shot in 1860 to 700 lb in 1871, and this required investment in much new plant. The &#145;Woolwich infant&#146; gun of 1871 reputedly required 1000 crucibles to cast its outer and four inner tubes, and naval guns were manufactured for the British and French navies. Land guns reached 100 tons, with 16 in. gun blocks and 2000 lb projectiles, and were sold to Gibraltar, Malta, and Italy. In addition, Firths led the way in attempts to manufacture compound armour plate. By 1871 1000 men were employed, producing turnover of &pound;421,109, though it fell in depressed 1879 to &pound;187,484.<br>
<br>Firth worked until his death, a popular local figure, exemplifying nonconformist paternalist business leadership. A founder of the Iron and Steel Institute in 1869, he remained active in its affairs thereafter. He married twice; first, on 15 September 1841, to Sarah Bingham (<i>d</i>. 1855); and second, in September 1857, to Caroline Bradley, daughter of the mayor of Nottingham. Four daughters and five sons survived him. Among the more civic minded of Sheffield steel manufacturers, he became councillor for St Peter's ward, Sheffield, in 1860, he served as a school board member from 1863 to 1874, and was master cutler from 1867 to 1869. He was elected mayor and alderman in 1874, and hosted the prince and princess of Wales at his home, Oakbrook, Ranmoor, Sheffield, in 1875. The prince opened a 35 acre park on 16 August, which Firth donated to the town. In January 1875 Firth donated &pound;20,000 towards building Firth College in Leopold Street, adding a further &pound;15,500 endowment, and &pound;150 for a chemistry professor. Opened in 1879, this institution was the embryo of the later Sheffield University.<br>
<br>A Methodist of the New Connexion, Firth taught at Sunday school at South Street Chapel as a youth. He contributed &pound;500 to Broomhill Chapel, and later an endowment of &pound;1000. In 1860 he added &pound;1000 to his brother Thomas's legacy of &pound;5000 to the New Connexion College at Ranmoor. In 1869 he spent &pound;30,000 on thirty-six almshouses at Nethergreen, not far from Oakbrook, &#145;as an expression of his gratitude to the Almighty God for his favouring providence, and as a means of benefitting many of the aged and indigent of his native town&#146;  (Marshall and Newbould, 33). However, help was restricted to protestant denominations. In 1872 J. M. Martin wrote on Firth's behalf about Salford model housing to the duke of Norfolk, who had stayed at Oakbrook in 1869:<blockquote>I believe the erection on our Model would soon produce a social revolution in Sheffield. We should not suffer a Tavern, Beerhouse, or dramshop on the property. Every house would be supplied with water, gas and a separate yard and dryash closet. The property would be thoroughly drained and each house ventilated from foundation to roof. (Arundel Castle MS S484)</blockquote>A Liberal, Firth declined the chance of standing for parliament when J. Roebuck retired in 1876. After a stroke at work, he died twelve days later at Oakbrook on 28 November 1880 from apoplexy and paralysis and was buried in Sheffield general cemetery on 2 December. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
