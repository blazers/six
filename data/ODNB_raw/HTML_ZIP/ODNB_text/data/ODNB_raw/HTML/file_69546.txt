<span class="headword">Lowe,  Douglas Gordon Arthur</span>  (1902&#150;1981), <span class="occ">athlete</span>, was born on 7 August 1902 at 314 Lower Broughton Road, Broughton, Salford, the son of Arthur John Lowe, a wool merchant, and his wife, Emily Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Read. After attending Manchester grammar school and Highgate School he went up to Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1921 where he read for the medieval and modern languages tripos; he gained a second in French in 1923 and a lower second in German in 1925. Lowe was a superb all-rounder who demonstrated his athleticism both at Highgate, where he won the public schools' half mile in 1920, and at Cambridge, where he won blues for athletics and football. He was honorary secretary and then president (1924&#150;5) of Cambridge University athletic club. In appearance he was &#145;trim and dark, with sleek hair parted in the centre&#146;. He had &#145;clean-cut features and a glittering smile that might have made him a matin&eacute;e idol&#146;  (Lovesey, 68).<br>
<br>Though he won the 880 yards for Cambridge against Oxford three years in succession (1922&#150;4), Lowe failed to finish in the first three at the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92495', "Amateur Athletic Association (AAA)")</script> championships in either 1922 or 1923. In 1924 he came a close second to Henry Stallard, and both men were selected to represent Britain in the Olympic games in Paris. But it was Stallard rather than Lowe who was considered the first-string runner, and in the final of the 800 metres he set a fast pace in an attempt to break the field. Stallard's tactic, however, played to Lowe's advantage, for as the former faded in the final straight, Lowe came through to take the Olympic gold medal in a British record time of 1 min. 52.4 sec. Stallard came fourth. Two days later Lowe narrowly missed out on a medal in the 1500 metres final, when Stallard won the bronze.<br>
<br>Lowe was Olympic champion at the age of twenty-one and yet still had a point to prove. Press accounts of the Paris race praised him but were also &#145;heavy in sympathy for the luckless Stallard&#146;  (Lovesey, 71). And the Olympic champion, it was noted, had yet to win an AAA title. Lowe, a &#145;dignified, self-possessed man&#146;, waited for his moment to reply  (ibid.). In 1925 he raced in America with the Oxford and Cambridge team and his next AAA championships came in 1926. A week before the championships he set a new world record of 1 min. 10.4 sec. for the 600 yards, an indication of his superb form. But barring his way to a title was the impressive Otto Peltzer, German champion at 400 and 1500 metres. It was the first time since the war that Germans had been invited to compete at the championships and in the 880 yards final the 27,000 spectators at Stamford Bridge saw a duel worthy of the occasion. Lowe was determined to make his mark and led at the halfway mark, which he reached in world record pace, 54.6 sec. Peltzer, though, proved the stronger and came from behind to win in 1 min. 51.6 sec. The German had broken Ted Meredith's world record of 1 min. 52.2 sec., as indeed had Lowe, who was unofficially credited with 1 min. 52.0 sec.<br>
<br>Peltzer also ran in the 440 yards, where he showed impressive speed in coming second, and this persuaded Lowe to race at the shorter distance himself. At the AAA championships in 1927 he won both the 440 and 880 yards, and was in the Achilles club team that won the 440 yard relay. In 1928, an Olympic year, he repeated his 440 and 880 yard double. In two years he had won five AAA titles and he approached the defence of his Olympic 800 metres title in Amsterdam with justifiable confidence. In the weeks before the games, though, the world record was twice lowered, by Lloyd Hahn of the United States and S&eacute;ra Martin of France respectively. Both men were in the world-class field for the final. Lowe drew the last of the cards for the start positions and got pole, his favourite. He led to the first bend and then took up second place, behind Hahn, ready to respond to any move from the field. Off the final bend he produced a devastating burst of speed to win in 1 min. 51.8 sec., a new Olympic record. It was a perfectly run tactical race and Lowe became the first man successfully to defend the Olympic 800 metres title.<br>
<br>In August 1928 Lowe accepted an invitation to run in Berlin against Peltzer, who at the Olympics had been below par through injury. Lowe won a close contest in a British record time of 1 min. 51.2 sec. It was his last race before retirement and a fitting end to a magnificent career. Lowe had contributed to a golden age of British middle-distance running, when Britons won the Olympic 800 metres title four times in succession. &#145;He was the perfect Olympic champion, and the perfect artist on the track&#146;  (Killanin and Rodda, 52).<br>
<br>After his running career was over Lowe made a significant contribution to the administration of athletics. He was honorary secretary of the AAA (1931&#150;8), and in this capacity drafted, with Harold Abrahams, the constitution of the body that became, in 1937, the British Amateur Athletic Board. He thus helped to resolve the crisis over British representation on the International Amateur Athletic Federation, clarifying the distinction between teams representing Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the home nations. He also wrote on athletics, and with Arthur Porritt published <span class="italic">Athletics</span> (1929), a training manual for track and field which included a history of the Olympic movement. In 1936 he published <span class="italic">Track and Field Athletics</span> (reissued in 1961), an illustrated guide for the aspiring beginner.<br>
<br>Lowe also pursued a distinguished career as a barrister and judge. In 1928 he was called to the bar at Inner Temple, of which he became a bencher in 1957, and in 1964 was made queen's counsel. He was chairman of Warwickshire quarter sessions (1965&#150;71), recorder of Lincoln (1964&#150;71), and a recorder of the crown court (1972&#150;7). He was a chairman of the governors of Highgate School. In 1930 he married Karen, daughter of Surgeon Einar Thamsen; they had one son. Lowe died of heart disease on 29 March 1981 at his home, 26 Great Maytham Hall, Rolvenden, Cranbrook, Kent.<br>
