<span class="headword">Delafaye,  Charles</span>  (1677&#150;1762), <span class="occ">public servant</span>, was born on 25 July 1677 in Paris, probably the eldest of the three children of Lewis and Mary Delafaye. His father, whose family originated in Dijon, abjured the Roman Catholic faith, moved to England, and entered the service of the duke of Ormond; he later became the French translator of the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span>. Nothing is known of Charles's early education. In 1692 he matriculated at All Souls College, Oxford, and in 1696 received the degree of BA. A year later he was appointed secretary to Sir Joseph Williamson, ambassador to the United Provinces. Shortly after Williamson's return to England in March 1699 Delafaye secured employment as a clerk in the secretary of state's office through the influence of his father. He served in the southern department successively under the earl of Jersey, James Vernon, and the earl of Nottingham. On 30 April 1700, at Aske's Hospital, Hoxton, Middlesex, he married Elizabeth Coulbourne 
    (or Coleborne; <i>d</i>. 1742)
  , possibly the third daughter of the Edward Colbourne of Cambridge included in the herald's visitation of Cambridgeshire in 1684.<br>
<br>In 1702 Delafaye was given the additional post of writer of the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span>. In this capacity he was summoned before the House of Lords in 1704 to explain how a notice reflecting on the instructions of the lord high admiral had come to be inserted in the <span class="italic">Gazette</span>. Despite this apparent setback Delafaye's career did not suffer. On the removal of the earl of Nottingham in April 1704 he passed first into the service of Sir Charles Hedges and then into that of the earl of Sunderland, who appointed him chief clerk, a position of special trust. He continued in this office under the next secretary of state, Lord Dartmouth.<br>
<br>In August 1713 Delafaye was selected by the duke of Shrewsbury, lord lieutenant of Ireland, to be his second or Ulster secretary. In accepting this office Delafaye abandoned the relative security and obscurity of a clerk for the greater prominence and responsibility of a secretary, whose fortunes were closely bound up with those of his political masters. He accompanied Shrewsbury to Dublin for the meeting of the Irish parliament and was rewarded with the post of gentleman sewer in the royal household. Following the death of Queen Anne in August 1714 Shrewsbury was replaced as lord lieutenant by Delafaye's former master Sunderland, who continued him in his post. When in August 1715 the Irish administration was placed in the hands of the duke of Grafton and the earl of Galway, Delafaye was made one of their joint secretaries, and he continued as such under their successor, Viscount Townshend. In order to strengthen the official representation in the Irish House of Commons Delafaye was found a seat as one of the members for Belturbet, co. Cavan, which he held until 1727.<br>
<br>In April 1717, when Sunderland became once more secretary of state, Delafaye was appointed one of his under-secretaries. Thereupon he left Ireland to begin the final phase of his official life. At first he served in the northern department under Sunderland, Viscount Stanhope, and Townshend. Delafaye appears to have left the bulk of foreign business to his colleague as under-secretary and to have concentrated on home affairs. In particular he was employed in the delicate and confidential business of managing the press on behalf of the government. In April 1724 he was transferred to the southern department to become one of the under-secretaries to the newly appointed duke of Newcastle. In addition to his strictly departmental duties he developed an interest in colonial affairs, and acted as agent for the colony of Jamaica between 1728 and 1734. Between 1719 and 1727 Delafaye was called upon to act as secretary to the lords justices of England during the absence of the king in Hanover. In 1728 he obtained the sinecure office of one of the clerks of the signet, which he held until his death. In 1725 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. He was an active freemason.<br>
<br>Delafaye suffered a serious illness in 1733 and resigned as under-secretary in July of the following year, being then aged fifty-seven. His career was remarkable in a number of respects. His introduction to government service was due to family influence and he was sustained throughout his career by powerful patrons. At no point did he enjoy permanent status in a formal sense. Nevertheless his abilities were such that he remained continuously in the service of the government for nearly forty years. Aided by a good education and linguistic proficiency, he was able to work his way up from the clerical to the secretarial level of government service. His responsibilities in Ireland provided him with invaluable experience and led directly to his appointment as an under-secretary. In this office he was able to place his skills at the disposal of four secretaries of state for a period of seventeen years, providing continuity at the intermediate level which made an essential contribution to the orderly processes of administration.<br>
<br>Delafaye retired to the village of Whitsbury in Wiltshire, where he died on 11 December 1762 at the advanced age of eighty-five. None of his children survived him.<br>
