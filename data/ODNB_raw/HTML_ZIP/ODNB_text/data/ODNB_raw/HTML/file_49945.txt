<span class="headword">Rook <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Nash]</span>,  Jean Kathleen</span>  (1931&#150;1991), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 13 November 1931 at 91 Albert Avenue, Sculcoates, Hull, Yorkshire, the only child of Horace Rook, a consultant engineer from Boston, Lincolnshire, and his wife, Freda Garton, a cinema usherette. She was educated at Malet Lambert Grammar School, Hull, and read English at Bedford College, University of London, graduating in 1954 with an upper second-class degree. She went on to take an MA in 1956, writing her thesis on T. S. Eliot. While at Bedford College she was the first woman to edit the university newspaper, <span class="italic">Sennet</span>, and won a place on a graduate trainee scheme run by the <span class="italic">Sheffield Telegraph</span>. From there she moved to Leeds to be fashion editor of the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span> and then to London as fashion editor of <span class="italic">Flair</span>. When Hugh Cudlipp launched <span class="italic">The Sun</span> in 1964, he asked her to be fashion editor. On 3 July 1965 she married Geoffrey Nash (1923&#150;1988), a journalist whom she had met on the <span class="italic">Sheffield Telegraph</span>; they had one son.<br>
<br>From <span class="italic">The Sun</span>, Jean Rook moved to the <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span>, where the circulation soared after she ran a &#145;Save our mini-skirt&#146; campaign for the editor, David English, at a time when hemlines were falling, and when the <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span> merged with the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> under the editorship of English in 1971 she became woman's editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>. In 1972 she was successfully wooed by the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, the main rival of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, and became its woman's editor; soon she was writing a weekly column with an enormous following. It was at the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> that she was dubbed the First Lady of Fleet Street by the deputy editor, and she always believed it was the actor Derek Nimmo who retitled her the First Bitch of Fleet Street. She was caricatured as Glenda Slagg in the satirical magazine <span class="italic">Private Eye</span>, and for years was savaged by the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> gossip columnist Nigel Dempster, all of which added to her fame. She put her success down to the fact that she wrote what millions of ordinary people were already saying, and wanted to read: she was the first journalist to suggest that Princess Margaret's marriage was in difficulties. Her readers loved her down-to-earth approach.<br>
<br>Rook regarded herself as a royalist, but wrote exactly what she thought about members of the royal family, treating them as fallible human beings. She adored the queen mother, admired the queen, was fascinated by Princess Margaret, liked Prince Charles, and detested Princess Anne, but she argued that the monarchy needed to be in touch with ordinary people in order to survive, and that it was necessary to make everyday remarks about them. When she made scathing comments in <span class="italic">The Sun</span> about Princess Margaret's unfashionable black diamond-patterned stockings, or wrote that the queen needed to have her eyebrows trimmed, her mailbag was swamped and the phone lines jammed, but she also defended Sarah Ferguson, the future duchess of York, when the rest of the press was denouncing her as a frump: &#145;Fergie may dress like a tumbledown English cottage, covered with a lichen-coloured cardigan, but this huge handful of an energetic romping girl could make Randy Andy very happy&#146;  (Rook, 148).<br>
<br>An admirer of Margaret Thatcher, Rook later claimed that in 1974 she was the first journalist to take Mrs Thatcher seriously, and to predict that she would be Britain's first woman prime minister. In February 1974 she wrote:<blockquote>If you spotted Margaret Thatcher in a tea shop, you'd try to buy her. She has a spun sugar complexion, and pale, whipped-gold hair. She looks so deliciously light and fluffy you feel that, in an argument, you could swallow her whole &hellip; But in fact, when you get your teeth in to her, the luscious Margaret is a well-baked rockbun, and an extremely tough cookie. (<span class="italic">Rook's Eye View</span>, 1979, 67)</blockquote>She backed Mrs Thatcher in her campaign for the leadership of the Conservative Party in 1975, going against the line taken by the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, and went on to interview her nine times between 1974 and 1989&#151;on one occasion, in 1978, introducing her to her impersonator Janet Brown. As well as politicians, she interviewed other public figures, from Hollywood film stars to famous sportsmen, never allowing any of her victims to see her words until they were in print: a cartoon by Giles in the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> depicted a killer rook with a half-eaten politician in her beak, with the caption &#145;Anyone Jean Rook doesn't like&#146;.<br>
<br>Rook was the highest-paid woman in Fleet Street, and enjoyed living up to her tough, hard-bitten, and outrageous reputation, clanking with extravagant gold jewellery, and driving a Jaguar. She was highly professional, and addicted to work, but in her private life she was a warm-hearted Yorkshirewoman, devoted to her family. She published <span class="italic">Dressing for Success</span> (1968), which included a chapter on &#145;How to dress to land a husband&#146;; <span class="italic">Rook's Eye View</span> (1979), a collection of some of her pieces in the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>; and an autobiography, <span class="italic">The Cowardly Lioness</span> (1989).<br>
<br>When breast cancer was diagnosed in 1989, Rook's readers were allowed to share her experiences as the disease progressed. She died on 5 September 1991 in the Nuffield Hospital, Kingswood Road, Tunbridge Wells, Kent.<br>
