<span class="headword">Furlong,  Alice Maud Mary</span>  (1871&#150;1946), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 17 January 1871 at Knocklaiquin Lodge, near Rathfarnham, co. Dublin, one of the four children of James Walter Furlong (<i>d</i>. 1897) and his wife, Mary Josephine Murtagh (<i>d</i>. 1897). Her father was a Wexford man and had at one stage been a leather merchant but later became the sporting editor of a Dublin newspaper. Her childhood was spent at Fernvale, Broohernabreena, Tallaght, in co. Dublin.<br>
<br>Furlong's sister, Mary (1866&#150;1898) was a published poet and Alice Furlong began to publish her own poems about 1892. Throughout her career her poems appeared in a number of newspapers and journals such as the <span class="italic">Shan Van Vocht</span>, the <span class="italic">Irish Press</span>, <span class="italic">United Ireland</span>, <span class="italic">Sinn F&eacute;in</span> and the <span class="italic">Weekly Independent</span>. Much of her work was published in the <span class="italic">Irish Monthly</span>. The editor of that journal, Mathew Russell, took a keen interest in Furlong's work and was instrumental in having her first and only volume of poetry, <span class="italic">Roses and Rue</span>, published in 1899. It was well-received, one reviewer noting that it contained &#145;Irish poems inspired by passionate patriotism&#146;  (Russell, 393). Many of her poems were strongly nationalist and Catholic in flavour. Her second published volume was a book of Irish fairytales and mythology, <span class="italic">Tales of Fairy Folks, Queens, and Heroes</span>, which appeared in 1907. She was popular in her day; one obituarist went so far as to say that she<blockquote>was for some years supreme amongst the living poets of this century &hellip; it is not too much to claim that between the death of Yeats and her own she had a mastery of pure lyric song unequalled by any other Irish poet. (Little, 138)</blockquote>Furlong lived near the writer Katharine Tynan and was also an acquaintance of the nationalist activists Maud Gonne and Jennie Wyse Power. The family home in Tallaght was the gathering place for a number of writers such as W. B. Yeats, Dora Sigerson, and the Fenian John O'Leary. Furlong was active in the Irish nationalist movement. She was elected vice-president of the ad hoc committee, later called the Patriotic Children's Treat Committee, which had been formed in 1900 in order to organize a treat for those children who had not attended that arranged on the visit of Queen Victoria. In October 1900 Furlong was also elected as one of the four vice-presidents of Inghinidhne na hEireann (Daughters of Ireland), an organization which had a specific cultural purpose and promoted the Irish language and Irish literature. She had begun to learn the Irish language shortly after the setting up of the Gaelic League in 1893, and in July 1908 she was awarded a certificate as a teacher of Irish.<br>
<br>Although Furlong published in both Irish and English, after 1916 she wrote mostly in Irish, publishing under the names Eil&iacute;s N&iacute; Pharthol&aacute;in and Eil&iacute;s de Fhurlaing. Her Irish-language publications appeared in <span class="italic">F&aacute;inne an Lae</span> and <span class="italic">An Claidheamh Soluis</span>, and her poem &#145;Dublin Easter 1916&#146; was sold as a leaflet to support the Irish National Aid Association. She published lessons for beginners in Irish in <span class="italic">Nationality</span> in 1918, and her poems continued to appear in the <span class="italic">Irish Monthly</span> in the 1930s. Alice Furlong died, unmarried, at her home, 378 Harold's Cross Road, Dublin, on 20 October 1946, of heart disease. She was buried in Tallaght graveyard.<br>
