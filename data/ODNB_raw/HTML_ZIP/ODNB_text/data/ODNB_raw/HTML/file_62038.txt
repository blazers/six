</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Handl,  Irene</span>  (1901&#150;1987), <span class="occ">actress and novelist</span>, was born on 28 December 1901 at 13 Leith Mansions, Paddington, London, the second daughter of Frederick Handl, a bank clerk originally from Vienna, and his French wife, Maria Schiepp. She grew up in nearby St John's Wood, and later characterized herself as a fiercely affectionate and rather na&iuml;ve child who, until she was &#145;quite old&#146;, actually believed that her name was Dolly  (television interview, 18 June 1985), because that is what her family had dubbed her in reference to the popular South African War song &#145;Goodbye, Dolly Gray&#146;. An ardent bookworm in later childhood, she was educated locally, and left the Maida Vale High School for Girls at fourteen. For the next twenty years she helped to run her father's household until, at his instigation, she decided in her mid-thirties to embark on an acting career.<br>
<br>Handl promptly enrolled on a short course at the Embassy School of Acting. During her audition for the school she managed to reduce the panel of interviewers to helpless laughter with what was intended to be a serious Shakespearian set piece, and it thus became apparent from the very first that her talent lay in comedy. Having completed her training, Handl made a show-stopping West End d&eacute;but at Wyndham's Theatre, as the maid in Gerald Savory's drawing-room comedy <span class="italic">George and Margaret</span>: she played her comical &#145;below stairs&#146; role with relish for the duration of the play's two-year run, and in doing so established a reputation for outstanding character acting which dominated her entire career.<br>
<br>For the next fifty years Irene Handl, who had come to her vocation so relatively late in life, was never out of work. She made her first screen appearance in 1937, playing a chambermaid in the film <span class="italic">Missing, Believed Married</span>, and this led to a seemingly endless succession of cinematic roles which she undertook in tandem with her theatrical work. From rather modest beginnings (she notched up many cameo appearances in the films of the 1940s, and actually appeared uncredited as an organist in the 1946 cinema classic <span class="italic">Brief Encounter</span>), Handl went on to become a familiar figure in popular British comedies of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. She featured in almost every well-known film series from <span class="italic">St Trinian's</span> to <span class="italic">Carry On</span>, and also gave notable performances as Peter Sellers's wife in <span class="italic">I'm All Right, Jack</span> (1959) and Tony Hancock's <span class="italic">The Rebel</span> (1961). Through the increasing popularity of television she became better known to an even wider audience, starring in a number of sitcoms, including <span class="italic">Hancock's Half Hour</span> (1956), <span class="italic">The Rag Trade</span> (1961), <span class="italic">For the Love of Ada</span> (1972), <span class="italic">Maggie and her</span> (1978), and <span class="italic">In Sickness and in Health</span> (1985), and in 1980 she endeared herself to yet another generation of viewers when she played the grandmother figure in the hit children's television series <span class="italic">Metal Mickey</span>. On both stage and screen Handl was best known for what she herself diffidently termed &#145;the usual old girl in the crossover apron&#146;. Pleasantly plump and always with a twinkle in her eye, she made colourful cockney chambermaids, charladies, housewives, and matrons her dramatic forte and, as she advanced in years, eccentric old ladies of all kinds became an additional speciality. Many of her characters were based on the servants around whom she had grown up in her father's house, but Handl had what can only be described as a great comic presence, which transformed what could so easily have been workmanlike, two-dimensional character performances into something far more memorable. A fan of music-hall humour from an early age, she had an impeccable sense of comic timing, but at her very best she could bring something more to the roles she played: a curious and almost tragicomic blend of mettlesomeness, personal warmth, and childlike innocence that was uniquely hers.<br>
<br>Ever the late developer, Irene Handl astonished the literary scene when, at the age of sixty-four, she published her first novel, <span class="italic">The Sioux</span> (1965), a work which she had first envisaged in her teens and had, out of boredom, taken up again in the 1960s during an exceptionally long stage run as the eponymous heroine in Arthur Lovegrove's <span class="italic">Goodnight, Mrs Puffin</span>. A frenetic present-tense account of the neurosis-laden and increasingly tribalistic behaviour of a family of French aristocrats, <span class="italic">The Sioux</span> not only reflected Handl's own affluent and exclusively continental roots; it also made obvious an eloquence, an acuity of intellect, and a depth of intuition on her part which were generally masked by the kind of characters she played. She came to view the book as one of her finest and most enduring achievements and published a sequel, <span class="italic">The Gold Tip Pfitzer</span>, in 1973.<br>
<br>Apart from acting and writing, Handl's interests were many and eclectic. She had a passion for fishing, and was a fellow of the National Geographical Society, as well as a staunch member of the Elvis Presley Club. She was also a devoted animal lover and was for some years president of the British Chihuahua Club, a role which reflected the great affection she always felt for her own pets. She never married and her only full-time companion during the later years of her life was her dog, Rosie. During 1987 Handl was as busy as ever, and completed work on a Channel 4 sitcom entitled <span class="italic">Never Say Die</span>, in which she played an elderly medium. Towards the end of that year, however, she became unwell, and although she remained confident that &#145;Dr Theatre&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 30 Nov 1987) offered the best available cure, and continued to honour all her previous work commitments, her condition deteriorated.<br>
<br>After a short illness, Irene Handl died in her sleep on 29 November 1987 at her home, 31 Viscount Court, 1 Pembridge Villas, Kensington, London. When asked in an interview by Mavis Nicholson two years before whether she felt she would like &#145;to be remembered&#146;, Handl had chucklingly and with typical self-effacement replied that indeed she would &#145;because I am an ass&#146;  (television interview, 18 June 1985). Her considerable achievements both within and outside the sphere of British stage and screen comedy ensured, of course, that she was and will continue to be remembered as anything but.<br>
