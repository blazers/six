<span class="headword">O'Rourke, Sir  Brian</span> <span class="st"> [Briain &Oacute; Ruairc; <em>known as </em>Brian-na-M&uacute;rtha]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1591), <span class="occ">chieftain and rebel</span>, was a younger son of Brian Ballagh O'Rourke (<i>d</i>. 1562), chieftain, and his wife, Grainne (<i>d</i>. 1551), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20556/', "Manus O'Donnell (d. 1563)")</script>, chieftain. Brian Ballagh is considered to have been the last king of West Breifne, co. Leitrim.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsaschieftain15621580"></a>Early years as chieftain, 1562&#150;1580</h2>Following the death of Brian Ballagh in 1562 his son Aodh Gallda was declared chief of the O'Rourkes of Breifne, but was murdered in Leitrim in 1564. Contemporaries suspected that this was done on Brian O'Rourke's behalf. Brian Ballagh's next eldest son, Aodh Buidhe, declared himself chief, but he was killed in 1566, again possibly at Brian O'Rourke's instigation&#151;at which point O'Rourke was declared chief. The remainder of O'Rourke's life was characterized by resistance to the English occupation of Connaught, interspersed with battles with his nephews. During the 1570s the Irish administration increased its efforts to bring Connaught under royal control by pressuring the Irish chieftains to surrender their lands, receiving them back again on English tenures, and allow sheriffs into the province. Like many Irish chieftains, O'Rourke was opposed to this interference; consequently, he maintained a large host of galloglass, and often led raids within the province.<br>
<br>Brehon law in Ireland allowed for multiple marriages, and O'Rourke had more than one wife. The first of whom there is record is Annably ni Crean (<i>d</i>. after 1582). He seems to have been married to his second wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. in or before 1589), daughter of Richard Burke, second earl of Clanricarde, and widow of Theobald Burke, while still married to Annably. However, the English government, opposed to multiple marriages, recognized only Mary as O'Rourke's legitimate wife. O'Rourke married her some time after 1582. While he wrote of the death of his wife in 1589, he was probably referring to a later wife, Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1589), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9560/', "James fitz John Fitzgerald, thirteenth earl of Desmond")</script>, nobleman, and his fourth wife, Ellen. Eleanor O'Rourke's death is recorded in the Irish annals under 1589. Brian O'Rourke had at least six children by his various wives, the eldest two being <a href="#cosubject_20846">Brian Oge [<i>see below</i>]</a> and Owen (<i>d</i>. 1589), from his marriage to Annably; however, the English considered only Tadhg, the son of Mary, legitimate.<br>
<br>By 1576 O'Rourke was among the growing number of chieftains who had agreed to submit, meeting the lord deputy, Sir Henry Sidney, in Dublin in June. By October 1577 O'Rourke had made an agreement with Sir Nicholas Malby, governor of Connaught, to pay rent to the crown. Despite these agreements, Malby suspected Hugh O'Donnell and O'Rourke of conspiring to revolt in 1578. Malby's men seized O'Rourke's castle at Leitrim. O'Rourke met Sidney shortly after and Leitrim was returned to him; it is likely at this point that he was knighted. If a knighthood was meant to pacify him, it had little effect, for he took advantage of the rebellions that had spread under his brothers-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9556/', "Gerald fitz James Fitzgerald, fourteenth earl of Desmond")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9562/', "James fitz Maurice Fitzgerald")</script>, and rejoined the resistance in Connaught against the government. However, he twice agreed to give Brian Oge to Malby as a pledge, but failed to deliver him.<h2>
<a name="Rebel15801591"></a>Rebel, 1580&#150;1591</h2>In summer 1580 O'Rourke hired 500 galloglass to support O'Donnell, and fought Malby over control of Leitrim. In 1581 O'Donnell ended his rebellion and, along with Donough O'Conor Sligo, agreed to guarantee O'Rourke's good behaviour on 3 October. The following year O'Rourke agreed to a one-year truce. Nevertheless, in 1583 he attacked Sligo; it was probably during this raid that he captured his nephew, Tadhg, who later died in his custody. In January 1585 another of O'Rourke's nephews, Brian O'Rourke, sheriff of Sligo, made an incursion into Dartry; O'Rourke came to the aid of Dartry. His men then took his nephew under their own protection, but they killed him three days later. O'Rourke was blamed for being involved in &#145;this unbecoming deed&#146;  (<span class="italic">AFM</span>, 5.1826&#150;7).<br>
<br>Increasingly preoccupied with the threat from Spain, Elizabeth I charged the new lord deputy, Sir John Perrot, with the task of bringing order to Connaught. Along with the new governor of Connaught, Sir Richard Bingham, Perrot began taking inquests in 1585 to determine the ownership of all the lands in the province and the rent due from each chieftain to the crown. These inquests were to form the basis of the composition of Connaught. On 27 September O'Rourke signed an indenture which identified his lands from which rent was due to the crown. He did well under the composition and was granted the castles of Dromahair, Leitrim, and Newtown rent-free. Despite these favourable terms, he refused to pay the rent he did owe. By 1586 Bingham had pressured him to agree to make payments, to give up his galloglass, and to surrender his eldest son, Brian Oge, as a pledge. In turn, Brian Oge was sent to study at Oxford.<br>
<br>Following the defeat of the Spanish Armada in summer 1588, a portion of the remaining Spanish fleet was wrecked off the coast of Ireland. Fearing a Catholic alliance, Elizabeth ordered Bingham to execute all Spanish survivors captured in Ireland, and declared it treason to offer them aid. The remaining Spanish, starving and destitute, had to rely on the help of the Irish. Faced with such a stark choice, many of the Irish chieftains who found Spanish survivors handed them over to the English authorities; O'Rourke did not. Captain Francisco de Cuellar, one of the survivors to whom he offered comfort, later wrote to Philip II of his ordeal. Cuellar described O'Rourke as &#145;a very good Christian and an enemy to the heretics, and always fights against them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letter</span>, trans. Sedgwick, 59). Philip wrote to O'Rourke, thanking him for his support.<br>
<br>Once the Spanish threat had receded, Bingham redoubled his efforts to subdue Connaught, but his brutal approach prompted another revolt in 1589. The chieftains, including O'Rourke, cited Bingham's harassment as the cause of their revolt. O'Rourke complained specifically about Bingham's attacks on him, of his son Owen's death at the hand of William Taaf, and of Dromahair having been burnt. Bingham, it seems, had also attempted in spring 1589 to exact payments from O'Rourke for Brian Oge's board at Oxford. He responded to O'Rourke's complaints, declared &#145;how naughtily O'Rourke hath always carried himself&#146;, and accused him of having defiled an effigy of the queen  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1588&#150;92</i>, 141). According to the lord deputy, Sir William Fitzwilliam, O'Rourke apparently made an effigy of Elizabeth which his galloglass hacked with axes, before tying it to a horse's tail and dragging it along the ground. These complaints aside, it is also quite possible that O'Rourke was stirred to revolt through the machinations of the chief justice of the common pleas, Sir Robert Dillon. Bingham had many enemies, including Dillon, who may have wished to oust him by fomenting revolt in Connaught. There is evidence that Dillon and O'Rourke corresponded.<br>
<br>After smuggling Brian Oge back from Oxford, O'Rourke renewed his revolt. Despite half-hearted attempts at pacification by Fitzwilliam, the fighting continued. However, the situation deteriorated to the point where, on 14 March 1590, Fitzwilliam ordered Bingham to attack O'Rourke. Bingham, aided by O'Rourke's nephews, Donnell and Hugh Oge (Aodh &Oacute;g), drove O'Rourke out of Breifne within the month. Brian Oge returned to his father's territory and continued the fight against Bingham. With the tide in their favour, the government now determined to remove O'Rourke permanently. Confident, Bingham described him as &#145;more like a beggar than a king, for above a king he esteemed himself, and assuredly the proud beggar held that opinion of his own greatness, as he thought all the force Her Majesty had, durst not meddle with him; but I hope this journey will end his kingdom, if not himself, and haply they may get his head&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1588&#150;92</i>, 329). On 30 April the privy council informed Fitzwilliam that they wanted additional forces for Bingham's attack on O'Rourke, considering that &#145;the subduying of whom wee thought allmost as needefull as the defence against the Spaniardes&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1590</i>, 77). O'Rourke fled to Tyrconnell in late May, sending word that he would consider surrendering if he was promised an &#145;indifferent&#146; trial. Bingham responded by calling him &#145;the veriest beggar and wretch, whose demeanour is most odious to all good subjects&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1588&#150;92</i>, 231). In December Sir George Carew, president of Munster, informed the privy council that O'Rourke was expected to return to his territory with galloglass in support.<br>
<br>Instead, O'Rourke fled to Scotland in 1591, possibly to raise Scottish troops, although he professed that it was to receive protection from James VI. After reaching Glasgow in February, he wrote to James, complaining of his rough treatment and asking for royal protection. James informed Robert Bowes, the English ambassador. Keen to have him captured, Elizabeth asked that O'Rourke be kept waiting in Glasgow until he could be apprehended, and James complied. On 16 March the king ordered O'Rourke's arrest in Glasgow, which caused a riot among the townspeople, who feared that their trade with Ireland would be disrupted.<br>
<br>O'Rourke was sent to the Tower of London by May and the privy council instructed Fitzwilliam and Bingham to supply evidence of treason. On 28 October, O'Rourke was tried in Westminster Hall on eight counts of treason, including trying to depose the queen, abusing an effigy of her, offering protection to survivors of the Armada, and receiving letters of thanks from Philip. When he refused to honour the privy council by kneeling before it, the privy councillors asked why he was willing to kneel before Catholic images but not before them. He is reported to have replied, &#145;because between God and his saints, whose images I respect, and you, I have ever thought there was a great difference&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ireland under Elizabeth</span>, 63). Through an interpreter, John Ly, he informed the judge that he would not consent to be tried by the jury without being given access to a lawyer and a week to prepare his defence. O'Rourke also asked for Elizabeth to be one of the jurors. He refused to enter a plea, but was found guilty none the less. When he was told that he would suffer a traitor's death, he remained unmoved.<br>
<br>O'Rourke was hanged, drawn, and quartered at Tyburn on or soon after 3 November (he was certainly dead by 23 November). On his way to the scaffold, his interpreter asked him to beg forgiveness of the queen, to which he replied that if she had given him the time to defend himself or spared his life he would have asked her forgiveness and promised to serve her. He also remarked that he had not expected James to hand him over to Elizabeth without any protection. His death was described by the four masters as &#145;one of the mournful stories of the Irish&#146;  (<span class="italic">AFM</span>, 6.1906&#150;7).<br>
<br>O'Rourke was the subject of poems by a number of Gaelic bards. Sean MacTorna &Oacute; Maelchonaire composed a poem for him when he became lord of Breifne in 1566. Tadhg Dall &Oacute; hUiginn, who wrote for various families in Ulster, Connaught, and Leinster, composed a poem to him about 1580. In 1589 Conaire &Oacute; Maoil Chonaire was accused of writing a poem for O'Rourke; however, in a letter he urged Donough O'Brien, fourth earl of Thomond, to intervene on his behalf, pointing out that the charge was groundless, since his family wrote chronicles, not poetry.<h2>
<a name="ORourkesrebelson"></a>O'Rourke's rebel son</h2>
<a name="cosubject_20846"></a><span class="headword">Brian  Oge O'Rourke</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Brian-na-Samhthach]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1569&#150;1604), <span class="occ">chieftain and rebel</span>, was the elder of two known sons of Sir Brian O'Rourke and Annably ni Crean. He was educated at New College, Oxford, from 1584 to 1588. In 1588 his father arranged his escape, and he was back in Ireland by 1589, taking part in O'Rourke's revolts of 1589&#150;90. Following his father's execution his lands were assessed, and the government considered whether to divide the territory among his heirs, or to take control of it. The chief lords, including Brian Oge, wanted the seignory divided among them, and his ensuing battle with his brother Tadhg for the patrimony lasted for the rest of their lives.<br>
<br>During the 1590s Brian Oge's own problems became linked to the Nine Years' War. Unable to return to Breifne, in 1592 he stayed with the MacSweenys and the Maguires, joining the developing confederacy of Irish chiefs under Hugh Roe O'Donnell. According to Philip O'Sullivan Beare, a contemporary who wrote his own history of the period, Brian Oge was committed to the confederacy, losing &#145;no opportunity of avenging the death of his father, who was killed by the Queen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ireland under Elizabeth</span>, 69). Brian Oge also had more immediate reasons for revolt. In 1593 Clement VIII acknowledged him as O'Rourke's legitimate heir. However, he was still not allowed to occupy his land, despite the fact that the government demanded that he continue to pay rent on it.<br>
<br>Elizabeth knew that the confederacy was in contact with Philip and that he had promised to send Spanish troops to Ireland. Consequently, Brian Oge, Hugh O'Neill, second earl of Tyrone, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20554/', "Hugh Roe O'Donnell (1572&#150;1602)")</script>, Hugh Maguire, and Hugh Roe MacMahon were declared traitors on 23 June 1595. Despite his position, Brian Oge was declared chief of the O'Rourkes by his clansmen in 1595. In 1596, as the rebellion spread, Bingham was dismissed as governor of Connaught and replaced by Sir Conyers Clifford, who took a more conciliatory approach. He sent envoys to Tyrone and O'Donnell to negotiate a peace. Loath to trust the government, Tyrone and O'Donnell rejected the offer, and Elizabeth sent a stronger force to Connaught under Sir John Norreys. Upon his arrival Norreys marched towards the territory of Theobald MacWilliam Burke, who in turn sent to O'Donnell for help. O'Donnell summoned his supporters, among whom Brian Oge was the first to arrive. After some sporadic fighting the two sides met at the Robe River, co. Mayo, to negotiate. Norreys promised O'Donnell, Brian Oge, and others consideration if they returned to the queen's allegiance, but after several attempts by both sides to spy on each other, he ran out of provisions and had to leave.<br>
<br>In summer 1597 the new lord justice, Thomas Burgh, fifth Baron Burgh, removed Norreys and took over as general himself. Brian Oge and Maguire joined O'Donnell against Burgh and Clifford, but little fighting occurred over the summer. In the autumn O'Donnell decided to attack the government forces as well as Hugh O'Conor Roe, who had defected from the rebels. However, Brian Oge had promised O'Conor that he would inform him if O'Donnell planned to attack him. To thwart this, O'Donnell sent for Brian Oge to meet him at his camp, but headed himself for O'Conor's territory, which he plundered and then left. About this time Brian Oge married Mary, daughter of C&uacute;chonnacht Maguire and his wife, Nuala, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17791/', "Sir Hugh Maguire (d. 1600)")</script>.<br>
<br>Following a dispute with O'Donnell, Brian Oge requested a royal pardon in late 1597, asking that he be restored to his father's lands. About a month later he presented the terms for his submission: he requested both a pardon, and to have his land given back to himself and his heirs; both were granted. He also asked that Bingham not be allowed to arrest him without order from the queen, stating, &#145;it is openly known how the Binghams maliciously urged [Brian Oge's] father to go into exile&#146;  (Brewer and Bullen, 3.279). In May 1598 Brian Oge surrendered hostages to Clifford and the two men promised to support each other, which served only to antagonize O'Donnell further. Nevertheless O'Donnell was loath to attack Brian Oge, since they were related, and tried instead to pressure him into rejoining the rebellion. Brian Oge's retainers feared an attack from O'Donnell more than one from the government and persuaded him to return to O'Donnell.<br>
<br>On 5 August 1599 Brian Oge joined O'Donnell in the battle of the Curlews (in Gaelic, Coirrshliabh). In the continuous warfare, O'Conor Sligo had been stripped of almost all his castles, and joined up with Clifford in order to recoup his losses. He also stole some of O'Donnell's cattle, which O'Donnell used as a pretext and attacked him, causing Clifford to come to O'Conor's aid. Clifford was killed during the battle, and Brian Oge ordered his corpse to be beheaded. Brian Oge himself was shot in the hand and leg. As a result, O'Conor submitted to O'Donnell and the chieftaincy of Sligo was restored to him.<br>
<br>In summer 1600 Charles Blount, eighth Baron Mountjoy, the new lord deputy, appointed Sir Oliver Lambert governor of Connaught. In September 1601 a Spanish force sent by Philip III arrived at Kinsale, co. Cork, to assist the Irish. Mountjoy immediately made for Kinsale, as did Carew and his forces. Tyrone and O'Donnell summoned their supporters, including Brian Oge, to aid the Spanish. The rebels arrived, and besieged the garrison, but on 24 December they were routed, and the Spanish left on 2 January 1602. Kinsale was a disaster and heralded the end of the Nine Years' War. In January 1602, O'Donnell went to Spain to seek help from Philip, but died there, and support ebbed away. O'Donnell's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20559/', "Rury O'Donnell (1574/5&#150;1608)")</script> sought Brian Oge's continued backing, but Brian Oge refused, instead returning to Breifne to fight his brother Tadhg, who was attempting to seize the chieftaincy.<br>
<br>On his accession as James I in 1603, the new king offered a pardon to all those involved in the rebellion willing to submit. Most of the chiefs, including Tyrone, accepted. On 9 January Mountjoy informed the privy council that only the &#145;proud, insolent, and faithless rebel&#146; Brian Oge had not submitted, but while it would be difficult to hunt him down, the lord deputy would eventually be able to overcome his &#145;pride and contempt&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1601&#150;3</i>, 554). In March 1603 Lambert launched an attack on Brian Oge but was driven back. However, Brian Oge's victory was short-lived, for Lambert's attack was followed by another from Brian Oge's brother Tadhg, who succeeded in capturing most of Breifne. Tadhg then went to Mountjoy who planned to give him the territory and aid him in banishing Brian Oge.<br>
<br>On 4 May Brian Oge wrote to James reminding him of how his father had fled to Scotland and been turned over to Elizabeth, at whose hands he had been unjustly killed. He asked the king that he be restored to O'Rourke's lands as his rightful heir. James was unmoved, for he wrote to Mountjoy (now earl of Devonshire) on 11 September in support of Tadhg, who was subsequently granted the entire territory. Brian Oge's situation turned from bad to worse. He was attacked by Rury O'Donnell, who was still angry with him for his refusal to support him after the defeat at Kinsale. He plundered Breifne and seized Dromahair, driving Brian Oge into the woods. Without his lands, and deprived of his patrimony, Brian Oge died in co. Galway on 28 January 1604 and was buried in the monastery of Rosserilly, co. Galway. According to O'Sullivan Beare, he died of a fever, &#145;deserted by those to whom he had entrusted his government&#146;; however, at least one more recent historian suspects that he was poisoned by Lambert (<span class="italic">Ireland under Elizabeth</span>, 177; MacDermot, 118).<br>
