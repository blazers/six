<span class="headword">Ross,  William Henry</span>  (1862&#150;1944), <span class="occ">whisky distiller</span>, was born on 19 June 1862 in Gowanside, Carluke, Lanarkshire, the youngest son of John Ross, tenant farmer, and his wife, Euphemia Forrest. A year later the family moved to a farm near South Queensferry, outside Edinburgh. After attending the local school Ross went to George Watson's College in Edinburgh (1873&#150;7).<br>
<br>After leaving school at fifteen, Ross went to work as a clerk at the Grassmarket, Edinburgh, branch of the City of Glasgow Bank. When this collapsed in 1878, he got a post as a junior clerk with the Distillers Company Limited (DCL), which had been formed a year earlier by six of the largest Lowland patent distillers to rationalize production. Through hard work and attendance at night school to learn bookkeeping, he quickly gained promotion, becoming accountant and cashier in 1884 and company secretary in 1889. He was appointed general manager in 1897, and managing director in 1900. When the large whisky-blending house of W. and G. Pattison collapsed fraudulently the following year, he tried and failed to arrange a rescue package, but DCL did provide financial help to firms unwittingly caught up in the crash.<br>
<br>After 1900 the whisky trade slipped into deep recession, exacerbated by the &#145;What is whisky?&#146; debate between the pot malt distillers and the patent distillers. Ross organized the patent distillers' campaign and was largely responsible for their victory before the royal commission on whisky that reported in 1909. In the meantime, he had been pursuing a policy of rationalizing the trade by buying patent and grain distillery businesses that were in difficulty, collaborating closely with the large blending houses. He displayed considerable skill in matching supply to the much reduced demand by working plant at below capacity.<br>
<br>From the 1909 budget, and throughout the First World War, the government was antagonistic to whisky, imposing large duty increases and restrictions. Ross became the unofficial leader of the whole trade, working hard to ensure survival. Scottish Malt Distillers was formed under his chairmanship in 1914 to acquire five Lowland pot distilleries. He was appointed OBE for his services during the war, when he acted as intermediary between the government and the distillers for the supply of alcohol for munition purposes. After the war, with the anti-drink lobby gaining ground worldwide, he led the campaign to restructure the industry and diversify DCL into other activities, particularly the production of industrial alcohol. His crowning achievement was the &#145;big amalgamation&#146; of 1925, which brought DCL together with the three largest blending houses, John Walker &amp; Sons, James Buchanan &amp; Co., and John Dewar &amp; Sons. Ross was appointed chairman of the enlarged company. Other amalgamations followed.<br>
<br>Ross was also concerned to develop the international market for whisky, making several sales tours overseas. It was on one of these to Australia in 1929 that his sight was severely damaged in an accident. He fought hard to overcome his disability, and established the W. H. Ross Foundation for the Study and Prevention of Blindness in Edinburgh in 1935. He retired from DCL in that year.<br>
<br>On 21 August 1888 Ross married Annie Gilmore Pollock Dalglish, daughter of David Dalglish, cotton-mill manager. They had two sons and one daughter. Increasingly infirm, he married as his second wife his nurse, Florence Ridley, and, when she died, he married her successor, Gladys Murdoch (who survived him). Ross died on 22 August 1944 at his home, Stanmore, Barnton Avenue, Davidsons Mairs, in Edinburgh.<br>
