<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Foskett <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Kirk]</span>,  Daphne</span>  (1911&#150;1998), <span class="occ">art connoisseur and writer</span>, was born on 23 December 1911 at Shoddesden, Kimpton, Hampshire, the daughter of John William Carnegie Kirk, a captain in the Duke of Cornwall's light infantry, and his wife, Agnes Maud Haynes. Her paternal grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34336/', "Sir John Kirk")</script>, the noted botanist and physician, who was David Livingstone's chief assistant and photographer on his second Zambesi expedition (1858&#150;63). Proud of this Scottish ancestry, in the early 1980s Foskett arranged for her grandfather's archive to be placed on long-term loan at the National Library of Scotland (which has since acquired it).<br>
<br>Daphne Kirk had a peripatetic childhood centred mainly on Sevenoaks in Kent. She was educated at St Ives School in Bexhill, Sussex, but left with no formal qualifications. After a period in the mid-1930s as matron at a Kent preparatory school, she married on 7 April 1937 Reginald Foskett (1908/9&#150;1973), then a curate, the son of Albert Ernest Foskett, a technical engineer. Daphne was the driving force behind her husband's career as curate and as vicar in the Nottinghamshire parishes of Rainworth (1937&#150;43) and Ordsall (1943&#150;7), and then at Ilkeston in Derbyshire (1948&#150;56). In 1956 Reginald Foskett was appointed provost to St Mary's Cathedral in Edinburgh, where the couple stayed for the next eleven years.<br>
<br>It was during this period that Daphne Foskett developed her love for and expertise in portrait miniatures. For several years she assisted Arthur Tite, a dealer in miniatures, at the annual Grosvenor House art fair. As her immense knowledge of the subject increased, she was encouraged to publish her research. Her first book was published in 1963, the lavishly illustrated <span class="italic">British Portrait Miniatures: a History</span>. In the following year she produced the first ever monograph on the outstanding but hitherto under-appreciated eighteenth-century miniaturist John Smart. For this book she was able to draw on Arthur Jaff&eacute;'s extensive unpublished research on Smart. In 1965 Foskett was invited by the Scottish committee of the Arts Council for Great Britain to curate a major exhibition, &#145;British Portrait Miniatures&#146;, to coincide with the Edinburgh international festival. Held at the Arts Council gallery in Rothesay Terrace, this major exhibition presented more than 400 miniatures from public and private collections across the world.<br>
<br>In 1967 Reginald Foskett was appointed bishop of Penrith, a suffragan bishopric in the diocese of Carlisle. The Fosketts lived at Brathay, near Ambleside, but after Reginald retired on account of ill health in 1970 they moved to Field Broughton, also in Westmorland. Daphne became a governor of St Ann's School in Windermere.<br>
<br>In 1972 Foskett published her massive research in the two-volume <span class="italic">A Dictionary of British Miniature Painters</span>, which recorded biographical information on more than 4500 portrait miniaturists. This publication superseded and expanded Basil Long's landmark dictionary <span class="italic">British Miniaturists</span> (1929). Foskett's dictionary has been in print since 1987, when it was republished together with a new edition of her book <span class="italic">Collecting Miniatures</span> (1979) to form the one-volume <span class="italic">Miniatures: Dictionary and Guide</span>.<br>
<br>Reginald Foskett's death at Field Broughton in 1973 was a considerable blow to Daphne, but she had two monographs and an exhibition catalogue published in the following year. Her book on the greatest of all British miniaturists, Samuel Cooper, was accompanied by her catalogue to the exhibition &#145;Samuel Cooper and his Contemporaries&#146;, which she curated for the National Portrait Gallery, drawing together nearly 250 outstanding seventeenth-century miniatures from across the world. In addition she produced her significant monograph on the Lakeland artist John Harden of Brathay Hall. In 1983 Foskett was involved as a consultant on the ground-breaking exhibition &#145;Artists of the Tudor Court&#146;, held at the Victoria and Albert Museum. She left an unpublished but completed manuscript on this key period of the portrait miniature. Foskett published numerous articles on miniatures and portrait miniaturists throughout her career.<br>
<br>Arguably more than anybody since the end of the Second World War, Foskett succeeded in bringing the art of the portrait miniaturist closer to collectors and connoisseurs, as well as to the wider public. Her prolific and popular output of writings compares well with the major scholarly contributions made by a series of curators and conservators who worked at the Victoria and Albert Museum, principally Graham Reynolds, Roy Strong, Jim Murrell, and John Murdoch. Foskett's knowledge was generously shared across the world with museum curators and private collectors, as well as with dealers and auctioneers. On her regular visits to London or elsewhere, such as during two punishing tours of the United States, she would leave behind a re-enthused curator or a budding cataloguer much the wiser and the keener. She conducted a very wide international correspondence and built up a substantial photographic archive; these were the building blocks of her painstaking research.<br>
<br>Foskett also received numerous visitors and students at her home in Field Broughton. There her razor-sharp memory was deployed in honing the eyes of younger specialists. This was often in discussion over some of her own exquisite collections. Apart from portrait miniatures, these included ivories, porcelain, and pottery, as well as Georgian furniture. Such close training in minute connoisseurship was a bracing experience, but it was mediated by her twinkling sense of humour. She was indefatigable, sometimes formidable, but always generous. After her death her photographic archive and a major part of her collection of portrait miniatures were placed on long-term loan at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh, where the miniatures were catalogued and exhibited in 2003.<br>
<br>Daphne Foskett died on 15 June 1998 in the Solihull Parkway Hospital. She had moved to Solihull ten years earlier to be closer to some of her family, and is buried there. She was survived by her two daughters. Foskett's numerous publications and significant exhibitions reached a wide audience, while her writing was driven by a keen eye and by a desire to make miniature painting more accessible to amateurs and specialists alike, while also furthering existing knowledge. She did a great deal to popularize this much-loved but often hidden mode of portraiture.<br>
