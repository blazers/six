<span class="headword">Ball,  Frances</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Mary Teresa]</span>  (1794&#150;1861), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic nun</span>, was the fifth and youngest child of John Ball of Dublin (<i>d</i>. 1804), a wealthy merchant, and his second wife, Mabel Clare Bennett (<i>d</i>. 1831). She was born on 9 January 1794 at 47 Eccles Street, Dublin, and baptized the same day. At the age of nine she was sent to England to be educated at the Bar Convent, a branch of the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary (IBVM), or the Sisters of Loreto, outside Micklegate Bar, York; she remained there until the death of her father. Then she returned to Dublin, where she met Daniel Murray, afterwards archbishop of Dublin, who became her close friend and spiritual director. She became active in the charitable circle of her eldest sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56306/', "Anna Maria O'Brien")</script>, but about 1812, the conflicting demands of her social activities and her spiritual expectations led to a crisis, which convinced her that she was called to the religious life. Murray directed her to establish a female teaching order in Ireland and, after the opposition of her mother had been overcome, Frances Ball entered the Bar Convent as a novice on 11 June 1814.<br>
<br>Here Frances Ball spent seven years, preparing to return to Ireland to found a new branch of the IBVM. She received the white veil in September 1814, and was professed on 9 September 1816, when she took the name of Mary Teresa. While at the Bar Convent her preference seems to have been for the contemplative life: she found teaching a distraction from her devotions, and is said to have spoken of her projected return to Ireland as if she were to be sent to Russia. She remained at York for longer than had originally been envisaged by Murray, because several postulants who were to accompany her to open the Irish branch of the order died prematurely. In 1821, however, Murray purchased a suitable house at Rathfarnham, near Dublin, and Mother Frances Mary Teresa and two companions, Anne Therry and Eleanor Arthur, travelled to Dublin. They took up residence at Rathfarnham on 4 November 1822 with a dozen pupils.<br>
<br>The early days of the foundation were not easy, and were marked by the deaths of several hard-worked nuns. But as early as September 1823 Rathfarnham had two novices, and many friends, relatives, and pupils of the first members were professed there. In addition to the boarding-school for young ladies, Mother Frances Mary Teresa opened a poor school in an outbuilding; such dual establishments became characteristic of her foundations. She worked tirelessly, assisting with such mundane activities as wall-papering and fruit-picking, as well as composing a martyrology for use in the houses and designing the plans for the abbey church at Rathfarnham, the first stone of which was laid in 1838.<br>
<br>The first filiation of the Loreto at Rathfarnham was established at Navan in 1833; it was followed by the establishment of a boarding-school and a poor school in Harcourt Street, Dublin (later 53 St Stephen's Green), in 1833, and a Loreto house at 43 North Great George's Street in 1837. In 1842 Mother Frances Mary Teresa purchased property at Dalkey on the east coast of Ireland, where she established a health resort for the nuns and arranged for the construction of a swimming pool. In 1841 she was asked to found a sister house in Calcutta and, after some hesitation, she agreed. Seven sisters were sent out, and a school was opened in 1842; other filiations in India followed. In 1845 the mission in Canada opened in Toronto; several daughter houses were founded, including one at Niagara Falls in 1861. Meanwhile the order expanded in Ireland, with the establishment of houses at Gorey in Wexford (1843), Fermoy (1845), and elsewhere. Mother Frances Mary Teresa's last foundation was at Killarney in 1860.<br>
<br>In the October of that year Mother Frances Mary Teresa fell and fractured her hip, probably also incurring some internal injuries. She did not recover, and in May 1861 she went to Dalkey, where she died on the 19th. Her body was taken back to Rathfarnham Abbey and buried there.<br>
