<span class="headword">Studd,  Charles Thomas</span>  (1860&#150;1931), <span class="occ">cricketer and missionary</span>, was born in Spratton, Northamptonshire, on 2 December 1860, the third of the six sons (with one daughter) of Edward Studd (1819&#150;1877), indigo planter in India, later of Tidworth House, Wiltshire, and his second wife, Dorothy (Dora) Sophia (<i>d</i>. 1923), daughter of John Thomas, Calcutta merchant, of Bletsoe, Bedfordshire; there were four children of the first marriage. He was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took a pass degree and graduated BA in 1883. Like his elder brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36363/', "J. E. Kynaston Studd (later first baronet)")</script> and G. B. Studd, he played cricket for Eton and Cambridge. The three brothers captained Cambridge University from 1882 to 1884, with C. T. captain in 1883. He was a superb all-rounder, famous at the age of twenty-one for his century when Cambridge beat the Australians by six wickets in a celebrated match of 1882. That year he played for England at the Oval when Australia won by 7 runs. He was among the top all-rounders in England in 1882 and became only the second player (after W. G. Grace) to achieve the &#145;double&#146; of 1000 runs and 100 wickets. In 1882&#150;3 he went to Australia with the England team which recovered the &#145;Ashes&#146;.<br>
<br>A dedicated rather than a born cricketer, Studd trained himself to supremacy. He used a longer bat than was usual, had the typical upright stance of the top amateurs of the day, and had a hard wrist stroke, with which he scored rapidly. He bowled slightly above medium pace, round-arm, his best performance being eight wickets for 40 runs for Cambridge University against Middlesex, the county he later played for. In his brief career in first-class cricket he made 4391 runs (average 30.49) and took 441 wickets (average 17.36).<br>
<br>By 1884 C. T. Studd was a household name. The sensation therefore was immense when he abandoned cricket, and a life of wealth and ease, to go as a missionary to China. In 1875 his father had heard the American evangelist D. L. Moody in London, and had sold his racehorses and devoted himself to personal evangelism. His three cricketing sons became committed Christians while still at Eton but after his father's death C. T. lost his fervour, until January 1884, after he had believed that his brother G. B. was dying. C. T. threw himself into Christian activity with the same discipline and dedication he had given to cricket, and determined to join another well-known Cambridge athlete, the oarsman Stanley Smith, in the then little-known China Inland Mission led by J. Hudson Taylor. Five of their friends followed their example and volunteered, making the celebrated &#145;Cambridge seven&#146; who left for China in 1885.<br>
<br>Studd spent nine years as a pioneer missionary in north China. In 1887 he gave away his fortune and &#145;lived by faith&#146; (and, indeed, on the generosity of his family). On 7 April the following year, while in China, he married another missionary, Priscilla Livingstone (1864/5&#150;1929), daughter of William Stewart, flax merchant, of Lisburn, Ireland. They had four daughters (two sons died in infancy). In 1894 he was invalided home and never completely recovered his health. In 1896&#150;8 he toured North American universities. Though not a natural speaker his pithy style, backed by his fame and renunciation, strengthened the student volunteer missionary movement.<br>
<br>From 1900 to 1906 the Studds served in India. In 1908, in Liverpool, C. T. saw a poster&#151;&#145;Cannibals want missionaries&#146;&#151;the first step in an extraordinary saga which led him, against medical and family advice, to found the Heart of Africa mission in the Congo. In 1913 Studd and his daughter Edith's young fianc&eacute;, Alfred Buxton, a descendant of the emancipator Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, bicycled across east Africa to a populous region untouched by Christianity. In the next years Studd and a small band of young people overcame difficulties to found a flourishing church, the start of a new pioneer mission, the Worldwide Evangelization Crusade (1919).<br>
<br>Studd's personality and methods became increasingly controversial; his autocratic leadership caused dismissals and resignations, and his determination to continue despite declining health led to dependence on morphine. Yet when he died in Ibambi, Belgian Congo, on 16 July 1931, 2000 Africans attended his funeral there in torrential rain.<br>
