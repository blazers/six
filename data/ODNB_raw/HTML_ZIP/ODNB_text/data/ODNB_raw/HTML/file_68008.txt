<span class="headword">K&ouml;nigsmark <span class="st"> [Coningsmark]</span>,  Karl Johann</span>, Count K&ouml;nigsmark in the Swedish nobility  (1659&#150;1686), <span class="occ">army officer and accused accessory to murder</span>, was of Swedish origin and was born at Nieuburg auf F&uuml;hnen in Germany on 15 May 1659. He was the son of General Kurt Christoph K&ouml;nigsmark (<i>d</i>. 1673) and his wife, Marie Christina Wrangel. His brother was Philip Christoph K&ouml;nigsmark, who was the lover of Sophia Dorothea of Celle, the wife of George, elector of Hanover and later George I of Great Britain, and who met his death under mysterious circumstances in 1694.<br>
<br>K&ouml;nigsmark was privately educated at home at the castle of Agathenburg and at Hamburg and Stade. He subsequently from the mid-1670s travelled throughout Europe, selling his sword and engaging in a number of adventures. He saw action in the forces of the Maltese knights of St John against the Barbary corsairs. After a supposedly single-handed assault against a corsair galley K&ouml;nigsmark was rewarded by his installation as a knight of the order. He eventually went to England to seek service in Charles II's forces and to make some money by his other main talent as a card-sharp.<br>
<br>K&ouml;nigsmark fought in action at Tangier and on his return to England he was favoured by the king and was enough of a gallant at this time to attempt a liaison with and even proffer marriage to Lady Elizabeth Percy, styled countess of Ogle (1667&#150;1722). She was heir to the inheritance of the earls of Northumberland and had been widowed for the first time when not quite fourteen. She was seduced by the count's charms, but K&ouml;nigsmark was considered a very unsuitable match for the heir to one of the great estates of England and so her guardians rebuffed him. Instead she was given to the wealthy Thomas Thynne of Longleat, which angered K&ouml;nigsmark, although the marriage was never consummated and Elizabeth soon absconded to the Netherlands. While K&ouml;nigsmark hoped for an annulment of the marriage, Thynne, anxious to retain Elizabeth's property, sought legal redress and the return of his wife. K&ouml;nigsmark, still feeling the insult of the marriage, planned his vengeance against Thynne. He sent a number of challenges to Thynne through his retainer Captain <a name="cosubject_68007"></a><span class="headword">Christopher Vratz</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1682), <span class="occ">army officer and murderer</span>, a professional soldier of German origin who had previously served as a mercenary in many of Europe's armies. Vratz had also at some point received a serious head injury, and latterly lived a dissolute life in Hamburg, having already spent some time as a highwayman in Poland. In Hamburg his arrogance led to his imprisonment and then expulsion. He then obtained a commission in the Dutch army and commanded a forlorn hope at Mons. His bravery was undoubted and one contemporary noted that he was as &#145;hard as flint&#146;  (Burnet and Horneck, 198). As a result of his bravery Vratz had obtained a lieutenancy in the Dutch guards and the king of Sweden was said to have given him command of a troop of horse. However, insubordination led to his further expulsion and he took service in the French army under Turenne. With the treaty of Nijmegen, Vratz made his way to Paris and then to London before ending up in Tangier, where he made the acquaintance of K&ouml;nigsmark.<br>
<br>It was later claimed that Thomas Thynne ignored the many challenges sent by the count and had hired men to kill K&ouml;nigsmark and Vratz. An attack apparently took place, but failed and left Vratz wounded. Soon afterwards Vratz recruited Lieutenant <a name="cosubject_68008"></a><span class="headword">John Stern</span>  (1640/41&#150;1682), <span class="occ">army officer and murderer</span>, to his design. Stern, who was in his forty-second year at his execution in 1682, was the illegitimate son of a Swedish baron who had been educated in Germany before becoming a professional soldier in the forces of the elector of Brandenburg. He had then spent twenty-three years or so wandering Europe in pursuit of his trade. In October 1681 he also had made his way to the kingdom of Charles II hoping to gain a place in one of the guards regiments. Falling in with him Vratz told Stern that he had a quarrel with an English gentleman and needed a second in order to duel with him. Stern agreed to fill this role. However, Vratz was also in communication with K&ouml;nigsmark, who was lying low in London, allegedly recovering from a venereal disease.<br>
<br>Planning continued, and when <a name="cosubject_68009"></a><span class="headword">Charles George Borosky <span class="st"> [Boratzi, Borodzycz; </span></span> <span class="st"> <em>called </em> the Polonian]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1682), <span class="occ">murderer</span>, a Polish servant of K&ouml;nigsmark's, arrived in England he was immediately handed over to Vratz and told to obey the captain. On Sunday 12 February 1682 Vratz told Borosky that he had a quarrel with an English gentleman, had sent him two challenges, and had been ignored; moreover, he said, the Englishman had attempted to have both himself and K&ouml;nigsmark murdered. Vratz told him that he was bent on revenge and gave him a musquetoon. Borosky was reassured that, as in Poland, servants were not held responsible for carrying out the orders of their masters and together the pair, with Stern, ambushed Thynne's coach in Pall Mall at 8 o'clock that evening. As Stern moved in front of the coach Vratz and Borosky came up alongside. Borosky immediately fired his weapon into the coach and the blast struck Thynne in the stomach and hip, mortally wounding him. Sir John Reresby, in his capacity as a Middlesex magistrate, was able to arrest the trio quickly. K&ouml;nigsmark's role was soon revealed and he fled. He was caught at Gravesend attempting to escape to Sweden. Brought back to London he arrogantly denied any complicity in the murder and claimed he had left only because he feared the possible fury of the English mob when he heard that he had been accused. He was committed to Newgate, but Reresby, for one, believed that Charles II was not keen to see the young man suffer for his crime. Indeed, at the ensuing trial K&ouml;nigsmark, assisted by pressure from foreign ambassadors and judicious bribery, was the only one of the men actually released. Vratz claimed that he had wished only to get Thynne out of the coach so that he could duel with him; unfortunately a bemused Borosky had fired into the coach first. Vratz, Stern, and Borosky were all found guilty.<br>
<br>In prison Vratz, Stern, and Borosky were visited by two leading clergymen, Gilbert Burnet and Anthony Horneck, eager to bring these notorious murderers to a proper state of their sins and to ensure that they made a public, properly repentant, and godly end. Stern and Borosky showed the greatest signs of repentance and their confessions were duly published; Stern's was a lengthy and impassioned mix of autobiography and confession with prayers and spiritual meditations. Vratz was the most recalcitrant, though on the night before the execution Burnet detected signs of repentance. To Horneck, &#145;honour and bravery was the idol [Vratz] adored&#146;; the captain regarded God<blockquote>as some generous, yet partial, prince, who would regard men's blood, descent, and quality more than their errors; and give vast grams of allowance to their breeding and education: and possibly the stout behaviour of some of the ancient Roman bravos (for he had read history) might roll in his mind. (Burnet and Horneck, 204)</blockquote>Vratz, Stern, and Borosky were hanged at the site of the murder on Pall Mall on 10 March 1682, the day after Thynne's burial in Westminster Abbey. Narcissus Luttrell contrasted Stern's and Borosky's penitent and &#145;dejected&#146; demeanour with Vratz's &#145;very undaunted temper&#146; on the gallows  (Luttrell, 1.170). To Sir John Reresby, to whom Vratz bowed &#145;with a steady look&#146; from the cart carrying him to his place of execution, &#145;his whole carriage, from his first being apprehended till the last, relished more of gallantry than religion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Sir John Reresby</span>, 257). The bodies of Stern and Vratz were given to their friends for burial; Borosky's was left to hang in chains at Mile End, &#145;being the road from the seaports where most of the northern nations doe land&#146;  (Luttrell, 1.171).<br>
<br>K&ouml;nigsmark sought consolation for the loss of Lady Elizabeth Percy in fresh military adventures. The authorities prevented any duels with whig lords, who still accused him of complicity in the crime, and he went to serve Louis XIV in his army, serving in 1683 and 1684 in the War of the Reunions between France and Spain and its allies. He was wounded at the action around Courtrai, and on his recovery served in Spain under Marshal Bellefonds and saw distinguished service in the French attack on Genoa. Eventually he went with his uncle Count Otto Wilhelm K&ouml;nigsmark to Greece to fight against the Turk. There are various accounts of K&ouml;nigsmark's death. He was either killed in action at Argos, or subsequently died of wounds and disease there, on 26 August 1686. He was later interred at the family mausoleum in Stade.<br>
<br>K&ouml;nigsmark was the classic Restoration bully and bravo. There is no doubt that he possessed a popular reputation for gallantry with women, as well as a headstrong nature. A short-tempered and violent man, who frequently stood upon his honour and engaged in a number of duels, he was also an excellent card player. Despite his protests at the trial and his subsequent release there is little doubt that he had been culpable in Thynne's murder. The fact that at the trial he was less concerned about the murder and more with having been placed in Newgate gaol, which he thought was &#145;a stain to his blood&#146;, says a great deal about his character  (Lucas, 172).<br>
