<span class="headword">Foster,  John</span>  (1759&#150;1827), <span class="occ">architect and engineer</span>, was born in Liverpool, the son of John Foster (<i>d</i>. 1801), master joiner, and his wife, Isabella. Although little known outside Liverpool, Foster's career was the archetypal tale of success in a boom town. Apprenticed as a joiner under his father, he purchased his freedom of the borough for 12 guineas in 1773.<br>
<br>Foster proved himself a competent, if derivative, architect, and was involved in such projects as the new gaol (1786), the Athenaeum (1799), the major modifications to the town hall (1789&#150;92, 1795&#150;7, 1802, 1811), and the new exchange (1807). He was also responsible for the public dispensary (1781), extensions in 1802&#150;3 to the Theatre Royal (built 1772), St John's market (1822), and the corporation church of St Luke, begun in 1811 and completed, massively overspent, to a much altered design by his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9962/', "John Foster")</script> in 1831. However, he was more important as an early town planner: under his direction&#151;for he gained significant political influence in the 1780s&#151;street widening, paving, and lighting were coupled with control over building heights, spacings, and fire resistance.<br>
<br>In 1799 Foster was appointed dock surveyor (chief engineer) in place of Thomas Morris, who was dismissed for seeking an allegedly unreasonable pay increase. Foster, who was not a qualified engineer, was paid three times as much as Morris, who was. Such were his talents that he was able, lacking both qualifications and experience, adequately to discharge these heavy new responsibilities. Working to the advice of John Rennie (1761&#150;1821), he doubled the area of Liverpool docks, and modernized every dock already existing when he was appointed. In 1802 he became corporation surveyor as well, by equally suspect means but with equally successful results.<br>
<br>A flawed genius, Foster was the master, and sometimes inventor, of almost every known form of local government corruption. His sister Jane married Matthew Gregson, who came of an old family of merchants, bankers, and manufacturers: Matthew disliked his parvenu brother-in-law and acquired some incriminating papers which give a glimpse of Foster's personality. His funding of his son John's &#145;archaeological&#146; trips to Greece with C. R. Cockerell, for example, is exposed as speculation in the acquisition of antiquities for resale to the highest bidder, whether in Britain, Bavaria, or France. Ethically this equated with his property speculations in partnership with Stanistreet and Eden, the corporation solicitors, to whom Thomas Foster was articled. Insider knowledge enabled them to appropriate profits which rightly belonged to the corporation.<br>
<br>Foster established a dynasty which temporarily controlled the fastest-growing town and port in Britain, from offices rather than from the council chamber. His son Thomas became town clerk, William was secretary to the dock committee, and John the younger was borough architect. Corrupt as they undoubtedly were, all the Fosters were very able men, and were pioneers of the new system of employing expert local government officers to manage the corporation's large and valuable estate rather than merely to organize banquets.<br>
<br>Dissenting merchants engineered Foster's fall: gaining power as dock audit commissioners, they investigated his largest single project, Princes Dock, opened in 1821 at a cost of about &pound;650,000, and found serious malpractice. The work itself was excellent, employing innovative techniques learned from Rennie, but gross overcharging by contractors connected with or related to Foster made the completed job cost at least double what it should. Among the accused was Timothy Grindrod, masonry contractor for St Luke's Church. In 1824 a compromise was reached: Foster resigned and the audit commissioners, rather reluctantly, dropped the matter. He died a rich but deeply disgraced man on 27 April 1827 at his home at Newington Bridge, Liverpool. His death was briefly noted by just two Liverpool newspapers: none carried any obituary or account of the funeral of the &#145;city boss&#146;. He might have been lauded as an architect, engineer, and town planner, a key man in the growth of professional local government. His dishonesty ensured that none of these professions wished to own him: instead, recitals of his misdeeds contributed to the passage of the <span class="roman">Municipal Reform Act</span> of 1835.<br>
