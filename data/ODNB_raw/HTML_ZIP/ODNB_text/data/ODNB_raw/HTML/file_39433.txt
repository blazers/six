<span class="headword">McNaughtan <span class="st"> [McNaghten]</span>,  Daniel</span>  (1802/3&#150;1865), <span class="occ">criminal lunatic</span>, born in Scotland (probably in Glasgow), was a wood-turner and political radical in Glasgow prior to the events of 20 January 1843 which earned him a place in the legal history of the plea of insanity, as the eponymist of the McNaughtan (or McNaghten) rules. On that day he shot Edward Drummond, private secretary to Sir Robert Peel, mistaking him for the prime minister. Five days later Drummond died of complications from his pistol wound. The assassin was charged with murder in the first degree and tried on 3 and 4 March at the central criminal court in London, the Old Bailey.<br>
<br>McNaughtan's defence rested upon the state of his mind at the time he committed the act, not upon the denial of the act itself. His counsel, Alexander Cockburn, proclaimed McNaughtan &#145;the victim of a fierce and fearful delusion&#146; that caused him to believe the tories were his enemies. The prosecution argued that McNaughtan was merely insane on the subject of politics and, unless proven to be generally incapable of knowing &#145;right from wrong&#146;, was legally responsible for his crime. The defence responded by introducing the testimony of nine medical experts. When the prosecution chose not to counter this evidence the trial ended, and the jury found McNaughtan &#145;not guilty by reason of insanity&#146;.<br>
<br>The public&#151;including Queen Victoria, whose assailant in 1840, Edward Oxford, had been found insane&#151;were alarmed by McNaughtan's acquittal. They feared that madmen could now kill with impunity. Debate in the House of Lords established a precedent that continued to exert a powerful influence in Anglo-American law throughout the twentieth century: the &#145;right from wrong&#146; rules were the sole test of criminal responsibility until 1957, when they were largely replaced by the Scottish concept of &#145;diminished responsibility&#146;. In the United States the McNaughtan rules remained in effect in twenty-four states at the end of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Most scholarly interest in McNaughtan has limited itself to legal and psychiatric difficulties in applying the rules. Until recently McNaughtan was universally regarded as a criminal lunatic. New evidence has emerged, however, suggesting McNaughtan was a political activist who was financed to assassinate the prime minister. Banking records from the Glasgow and Ship Bank indicate that McNaughtan accumulated most of the &pound;750 found on him at the time of the shooting during the two years prior to the assassination, which he spent travelling round Great Britain and France. There is strong evidence that McNaughtan was intensely involved in radical politics. In 1835, when Abram Duncan came to work as a wood-turner in McNaughtan's shop, Duncan was already a well-known Chartist leader. In the next five years, however, Duncan became the chief spokesman for the trade unions in Glasgow and the west of Scotland. In addition, McNaughtan's reading ticket from the mechanics' institution in Glasgow indicates the former actor and medical student was familiar with the symptoms of insanity, and that he may have been feigning insanity.<br>
<br>On 13 March 1843 Daniel McNaughtan was sent to Bethlem Hospital, St George-in-the-Fields, London, to &#145;await the Crown's Pleasure&#146;&#151;the equivalent of a life sentence. McNaughtan spent the next twenty-one years confined in a stone cell measuring 8&frac12; by 10&frac12; feet. When Broadmoor opened in 1864 McNaughtan was transferred to the new state criminal lunatic asylum at Crowthorne in Berkshire. By the age of fifty his health had deteriorated and he complained of &#145;palpitations of the heart&#146;. On 3 May 1865 he &#145;gradually sank and died at 1:10 a.m.&#146;. A forgotten man, Daniel McNaughtan was buried on the grounds of the asylum. <span class="italic">The Times</span>, which had devoted much attention to his crime, took no notice of his passing.<br>
