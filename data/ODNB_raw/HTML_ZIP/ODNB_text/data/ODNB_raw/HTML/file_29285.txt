<span class="headword">Whitehead,  Charles</span>  (1804&#150;1862), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in London on 4 September 1804, the eldest of the seven children of a City wine merchant, possibly the Joseph Whitehead listed in contemporary trade directories as the proprietor of wine and brandy vaults in Tottenham Court Road. The details of his early life are exceptionally obscure, and nothing is known of his education. After some time as a clerk in a commercial house he embarked on the hazardous career of a professional author. In 1831 he published <span class="italic">The Solitary</span>, a lengthy meditative poem whose implacable melancholy was partly occasioned by the drowning of one of his three brothers. This first work attracted favourable notice but few purchasers.<br>
<br>Whitehead married Mary Ann Loomes on 29 October 1833. During the 1830s he contributed widely to magazines (among them <span class="italic">The Monthly</span>, <span class="italic">The Court</span>, and <span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span>) and to such annuals as <span class="italic">Friendship's Offering</span> and <span class="italic">Amaranth</span>. He was also, for some eight years, a reader for Bentley and, from 1836, editor of Chapman and Hall's <span class="roman">Library of Fiction</span>. Of his more substantial works from this decade, <span class="italic">The Lives and Exploits of English Highwaymen, Pirates and Robbers</span> (1834) is essentially an updated revision of earlier compilations by other hands, but <span class="italic">The Autobiography of Jack Ketch</span> (1834) adroitly parodies the vogue for &#145;Newgate&#146; fiction while simultaneously generating its own macabre comedy. A blank verse historical play, <span class="italic">The Cavalier</span>, was produced at the Haymarket Theatre, London, in September 1836 and was revived in 1840, 1850, 1856, and 1868.<br>
<br>By the end of the 1830s, then, Whitehead had established himself on the London literary scene (among other affiliations, he was a member of Jerrold and Blanchard's Mulberry Club) and in 1841&#150;2 he produced his masterpiece, <span class="italic">Richard Savage</span>, a novel based on the career of Samuel Johnson's early friend. The eponymous narrator, vain and unreliable, presents a disturbing study in obsession, and Whitehead skilfully contextualizes his protagonist's deepening paranoia in a credible reconstruction of eighteenth-century Grub Street. <span class="italic">Richard Savage</span> is a major achievement, but it had no real successor. <span class="italic">The Earl of Essex</span>, an impenetrably stilted historical romance, enjoyed only moderate sales on its first appearance in 1843, and of the magazine pieces collected in <span class="italic">Smiles and Tears</span> (1847) only a few dark confessional tales (such as the Poe-like &#145;Narrative of John Ward Gibson&#146;) rise above the level of hack work. <span class="italic">The Life and Times of Sir Walter Raleigh</span> (1854) owes more to scissors and paste than to scholarship.<br>
<br>Whitehead's work was neither prolific nor popular enough to ensure a regular income and as early as 1836 he was petitioning the Literary Fund for relief, an application repeated in 1837, 1843, 1852, and 1854. Constantly in debt and in fear of bailiffs (in 1843 he was being housed and supported by his sisters), his mental and physical health deteriorated, and in 1852 he confessed that &#145;now-a-days I am a bad hand at writing against time, being excited and highly nervous&#146;  (Hodder, 357). Finally, on 13 November 1856, he and his wife left England to start a new life in Australia, arriving in Melbourne on 17 March 1857.<br>
<br>Whitehead rapidly became a contributor to various colonial journals, including <span class="italic">The Examiner</span> and the <span class="italic">Melbourne Punch</span>. He may, briefly, have edited the journal <span class="italic">My Note Book</span>, which began, in 1858, to serialize his new novel <span class="italic">Emma Latham</span>, but he was, once again, unable to write himself out of poverty. His mentally-ill wife died at Yarra Bend Asylum on 21 August 1860. Whitehead himself drifted into chronic alcoholism (a tendency which perhaps began in England) and, after appearing in a police court &#145;charged with lunacy, caused through drink&#146;  (Turnbull, 20), he was eventually admitted to the Immigrants' Home for the destitute. He died of hepatitis and bronchitis at the Melbourne Hospital on 5 July 1862 and was buried in a pauper's grave.<br>
<br>Whitehead is remembered chiefly as the author invited by Chapman and Hall to write the letterpress for a series of illustrations by Robert Seymour, and who suggested that they approach Dickens instead (a suggestion which resulted in <span class="italic">The Pickwick Papers</span>). There appears to be no solid evidence for this story, and Whitehead, with characteristic misfortune, has thus survived only as the subject of an apocryphal anecdote. He deserves a better fate, for he was able to harness his brooding, depressive imagination (suicide is a recurrent motif in his work) to produce, in <span class="italic">Richard Savage</span>, a novel of compelling power.<br>
