<span class="headword">Boulton,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1674, <em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1724), <span class="occ">medical writer</span>, the son of Ralph Boulton, of Chester, and Agnes Brown, was baptized at Ince, Wigan, Lancashire, on 3 December 1674. He matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford, on 29 November 1697. Boulton was already well versed in medical texts, publishing <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Reason of Muscular Motion</span> in 1697 and composing another treatise. John Meare, principal of Brasenose, urged Arthur Charlett, master of University College, to lend Boulton help. On 11 February 1698 Charlett wrote to Hans Sloane that Boulton had laboured hard at the books of &#145;your faculty&#146;, desiring to &#145;become an Early Author&#146;, but that because Boulton was only &#145;a Poor Servitor&#146;, he had never had the chance to see patients. Perhaps the letter helped Boulton's second work, <span class="italic">A Treatise Concerning the Heat of the Blood</span>, to earn the imprimatur of the College of Physicians, London, on 5 March 1698. Dedicated to Meare, the treatise took respectful exception to Thomas Willis's view that heat in the blood was caused by sulphurous particles, advancing instead the mechanical explanation that heat was rarefied matter in swift motion.<br>
<br>By 18 May 1698 Boulton felt able to approach the influential physician Charles Goodall by letter. Goodall replied on 26 May via a third party, asking Boulton to come to London to help with a work of natural history. Near the end of the summer Boulton arrived in London; Goodall asked him to work on books against opponents of the College of Physicians, in return for room and board, and Goodall's influence in advancing Boulton's medical career. Boulton attacked one of the thorns in Goodall's side in <span class="italic">An Examination of Mr John Colbatch</span> (1698); but he could not resist adding to it an appendix against a pamphlet printed by Charles Leigh, a physician from Manchester, who had attacked the reasoning of Boulton's work on heat in the blood, going on to compare him to the London empiric Gideon Harvey and to Rabelais's Pantagruel. Boulton's appendix replied that Leigh's pamphlet would serve a purpose only in a &#145;bog-house&#146;, although &#145;most People are afraid of fouling their Fingers with a Piece of Paper the Doctor hath dirty'd already&#146;. Needless to say, Leigh took high exception to such remarks from an Oxford student, and hearing who had backed Boulton, wrote to Goodall. Goodall replied to Leigh in a letter dated 6 December, disowning Boulton, who confronted his patron, only to be kicked out of Goodall's house. To Leigh's <span class="italic">Reply to Mr Richard Bolton</span> (1698), further cutting at Boulton and printing Goodall's letter, Boulton responded with <span class="italic">A Letter to Dr Charles Goodall</span> (dated 18 January 1699), which reviewed Goodall's turncoat and underhanded behaviour. Goodall tried to destroy Boulton by publishing <span class="italic">A Two-Penny Answer to R. Boulton's Six-Penny Letter to Dr Charles Goodall</span> (1699), said to be from William Wilkinson, his footman. It compared Boulton to some famous London quacks and to religious radicals, such as &#145;W. Pen, G. Whitehead, or one of Muggleton's Successors&#146;. The controversy spread, and when the well-known William Salmon weighed in on Boulton's side, Goodall or one of his defenders replied in turn in the <span class="italic">Post Boy</span> of 14 February 1699, with an advertisement asking that two quacks be brought to Bedlam (Bethlem Hospital): the first Salmon, the second Boulton, who was described as:<blockquote>an odd contriv'd sort of a Country Clown, in a grey Coat, which he cannot change for want of another; &hellip; wears his own hair; late of <i>Brazen Nose</i> and still of <i>Brazen Face</i>; being Impudent, proud, insolent, Atheistical, silly senceless, and a most abominable Lyer, Betrayer of his Trust, and a notorious Contriver and Fomenter of Mischief; with the several signs of a Madman following.</blockquote>Boulton had obviously fallen into difficulties, and turned to publishing to support himself: he brought out <span class="italic">A System of Rational and Practical Chirurgery</span> in 1699 and <span class="italic">The Works of the Hon. Robert Boyle Epitomised</span> in three volumes, from April 1699 to 1700. According to Wilkinson's <span class="italic">Two-Penny Answer</span>, the advance offered by the publisher for the Boyle epitome gave Boulton the wherewithal to print his <span class="italic">Letter to Goodall</span>; Boulton also wrote to Sloane that he undertook the epitome on account of &#145;misfortunes still attending&#146; him. He later begged Sloane to help him find a way to make a living. He may have turned to medical practice, for between 1714 and 1724 he brought out four more medico-surgical works: a treatise on gout, the king's evil, and venereal disease; a work on external remedies; an essay on plague; and <span class="italic">Some Thoughts Concerning the Unusual Qualities of the Air</span> (1724). He also published <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Compleat History of Magick</span> (1722), in which he mentions that he had been out of England for some time. The date of Boulton's death is unknown.<br>
