<span class="headword">Bowdler,  Thomas</span>  (1754&#150;1825), <span class="occ">writer and literary editor</span>, was born on 11 July 1754 at Ashley, near Bath, the younger son of Thomas Bowdler (<i>bap</i>. 1719, <i>d</i>. 1785) and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74743/', "Elizabeth Stuart Bowdler, n&#233;e Cotton (d. 1797)")</script>. His father, a gentleman of independent fortune, was descended from an ancient family originally settled at Hope Bowdler, Shropshire, and his mother was the second daughter and coheir of Sir John Cotton of Conington, Huntingdonshire, the last baronet in the line of Bruce Cottons. His mother, an accomplished and educated woman, was the first instructor of her six children, who included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3029/', "Jane Bowdler (1743&#150;1784)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3031/', "John Bowdler (1746&#150;1823)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3028/', "Henrietta Maria Bowdler (1750&#150;1830)")</script>.<br>
<br>Thomas Bowdler is said to have suffered much from a serious accident when he was nine, which required operations and an extended convalescence. It was about that time, however, in 1765, that he went to Mr Graves's school at Claverton, near Bath, and first met William Anne Villettes, who was to become a military officer and a lifelong friend. In 1770 Bowdler went to study medicine at St Andrews University, and then moved to Edinburgh, where in 1776 he graduated MD and published his thesis <span class="italic">Tentamen medicum inaugurale de febrium intermittentium natura et indole</span>. He spent the next four years travelling in Europe, where in Lisbon in 1781 he caught a fever from a friend whom he attended during a fatal illness. He returned to England in broken health, with his &#145;physical aversion to sick people&#146;  (Perrin, 69) accentuated. Despite being elected a fellow of the Royal Society and a licentiate of the College of Physicians on 9 April 1781, Bowdler retired from the practice of medicine on the death of his father in 1785.<br>
<br>Thomas Bowdler settled in London, where he lived until 1800. He obtained an introduction to Elizabeth Montagu, &#145;Queen of the Blues&#146;, and became part of a literary and philanthropic circle which included bishops Hinchcliffe and Porteus, Elizabeth Carter, Hester Chapone, and Hannah More. Bowdler devoted himself to charitable work: he acted for many years as chairman of St George's vestry, and was a member of the committee in charge of the Magdalen Hospital. He was also active in the Proclamation Society, formed in 1787 to enforce a royal proclamation against impiety and vice. In 1781 he became a commissioner with Sir Gilbert Elliot and Sir Charles Bunbury to examine the state of the penitentiaries, and he remained an active proponent of prison reform, inspecting gaols throughout the country in 1790. Beginning to feel some disenchantment about the slow progress of his proposed prison reforms Bowdler visited the Low Countries in 1787 and wrote a detailed account of the revolution there in <span class="italic">Letters Written in Holland in the Months of September and October, 1787</span> (1788). He also travelled in France in 1788.<br>
<br>In 1800 Bowdler left London, partly because of the failure of his prison reform project. The economic advantages of the new scheme of transporting prisoners to Australia meant that parliament lost any interest that Bowdler had been able to generate for reform. He moved to St Boniface, in the Isle of Wight, where he lived for ten years, leasing a country estate. On 13 September 1806, aged fifty-two, he married Elizabeth Frevenen or Trevennen, the widow of a naval officer. The marriage was unhappy, however, and after a few years they lived apart. The relationship was never again mentioned by the Bowdler family, even in the posthumous biography of Bowdler by his nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3033/', "Thomas Bowdler (1782&#150;1856)")</script>; as a result, Thomas Bowdler is usually assumed to have been a bachelor. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>In 1814 Bowdler visited Geneva to settle the affairs of his old friend Lieutenant-General Villettes, who had died in Jamaica in 1807, and he also wrote <span class="italic">The Life of Villettes</span>, published in 1815. In the same year he published <span class="italic">Observations on emigration to France, with an account of health, economy, and the education of children</span>, which warned Englishmen against France, and English invalids against French watering-places, recommending Malta instead, which he had visited with a nephew in 1810. His <span class="italic">Observations</span> was eventually appended to later editions of the biography of Villettes.<br>
<br>It was in 1818, however, that Thomas Bowdler produced the work for which he is best-known, <span class="italic">The Family Shakspeare</span>, an edition of the complete plays best described by its subtitle: <i>in which nothing is added to the original text; but those words and expressions are omitted which cannot with propriety be read aloud in a family</i>. This notion of reading aloud was key, as his own father's reading of Shakespeare had had a formative influence on the young Thomas Bowdler. As he later put it:<blockquote>In the perfection of reading few men were equal to my father; and such was his good taste, his delicacy, and his prompt discretion, that his family listened with delight &hellip; without knowing that those matchless tragedies contained words and expressions improper to be pronounced &hellip; It afterwards occurred to me, that what my father did so readily and successfully for his family, my inferior abilities might &hellip; be able to accomplish for the benefit of the public. I say, therefore, that if &#145;The Family Shakspeare&#146; is entitled to any merit, it originates with my father. (preface, <span class="italic">The Family Shakspeare</span>, 1843, viii)</blockquote>The edition published by Longman in 1818 was not the first expurgation for which Thomas Bowdler accepted responsibility. His sister Henrietta Maria Bowdler had originated the project at Bath in 1807, with the publication of the first edition of <span class="italic">The Family Shakespeare</span> (spelt differently in his sister's edition). It had contained only twenty plays, avoiding such perilous works for the editor as <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, and throughout had excised sexually explicit passages and religious references which might offend the Anglican reader. Thomas Bowdler had assumed the credit for this edition by 1809, probably in order to protect the reputations of his sister and the family. His own fuller edition of the plays operated on much the same principles as his sister's: in the preface he writes of Shakespeare's language that &#145;[m]any words and expressions occur which are of so indecent a nature as to render it highly desirable that they should be erased&#146;  (p. viii). He also complains of the unnecessary and frivolous allusions to scripture, which &#145;call imperiously for their erasement&#146;  (p. ix). But Thomas Bowdler was in some respects more faithful to the original text than his sister had been. While it is true that he detected and excised more religious references than she had felt necessary, he also restored scenes that she had cut because she had found them trivial or uninteresting. As Noel Perrin puts it:<blockquote>He substituted very few of his own words for Shakespeare's, and he neither abridged nor (with rare exceptions) added commentary. That is, he treated Shakespeare rather as an unusually scrupulous television producer might now. His sister, who started expurgating Shakespeare ten years before he did, used a similar approach, but also often cut &#145;an uninteresting or an absurd scene&#146;, even though she considered it decent. That is, she treated Shakespeare rather as a normal television producer would. (Perrin, xii)</blockquote>Neither the Bath edition of 1807 nor the London edition of <span class="italic">The Family Shakspeare</span> (1818) caused much of a stir on publication. In 1821, however, <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> roundly criticized Bowdler's edition, and the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> published a defence of his aims and achievement written by Lord Jeffrey, which went so far as to state that all other editions of Shakespeare had been rendered obsolete. The controversy led to increased sales for <span class="italic">The Family Shakspeare</span>, and it became a best-seller&#151;Lord Jeffrey's review served as a frontispiece to subsequent editions for over sixty years. Bowdler's expurgation ran into many editions, and as late as 1860, when it came out of copyright, demand for it was running high enough for another publisher to bring out a rival edition to Longman's.<br>
<br>During the final years of his life Bowdler wrote <span class="italic">A Short Introduction to a Selection of Chapters from the Old Testament</span> (1822), intended for a Sunday school society at Swansea, and he also continued his editorial work, attempting to purify Gibbon's <span class="italic">History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</span>. This was completed just before &#145;a cold &hellip; falling on his lungs&#146; caused his death at Rhydings on 24 February 1825  (Bowdler, 326). Bowdler was buried in Oystermouth parish churchyard, near Swansea. His expurgation of Gibbon was published by Longman in the following year, proclaiming itself to be &#145;for the use of families and young persons, reprinted from the original text with the careful omissions of all passages of an irreligious or immoral tendency&#146;. In his preface Bowdler declared himself confident enough in the worth of his project to assert that Gibbon himself would have approved of it, and he also expressed his hope that his altered work might form the basis for future editions. Bowdler's nephew adds in a note that &#145;it was the peculiar happiness of the writer&#146; to have so purified Shakespeare and Gibbon that they could no longer &#145;raise a blush on the cheek of modest innocence nor plant a pang in the heart of the devout Christian&#146;  (T. Bowdler, &#145;Note&#146;, <span class="italic">Gibbon's History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</span>, ed. T. Bowdler, 1826, xiii).<br>
<br>Bowdler's editing has come in for much criticism for almost two hundred years. The <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> summarized the view which has largely prevailed by commenting that &#145;Bowdler's prudery makes sad havoc with Shakespeare's text&#146;, and by calling attacks on the edition &#145;deserved&#146;. Most illustrative of this view of his edition is the word &#145;bowdlerize&#146;, derived from the Bowdler surname. The <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span> defines this word as &#145;to expurgate (a book or writing), by omitting or modifying words or passages considered indelicate or offensive&#146;, but goes on to offer the secondary, more editorial definition of &#145;to castrate&#146;. First used in print as early as 1836, and still used to denigrate acts of censorship, the verb encapsulates the commonly held view of Bowdler's editorial philosophy and methods.<br>
<br>It is generally acknowledged that Bowdler's treatment of Shakespeare's text was unacceptable, and its influence can certainly not be denied. His sister's original expurgation and Bowdler's elaboration of her work set a more general movement of literary expurgation into play, and although <span class="italic">The Family Shakspeare</span> ran into many editions, more importantly it affected how Shakespeare was edited and read for generations. By 1850 there were seven expurgated editions of Shakespeare on the market, and by 1900 that number had increased to fifty  (Perrin, xiii). Bowdlerization, however objectionable on intellectual grounds, clearly had a readership. And a defence of Bowdler's effect on the young reading public, if not of his larger philosophy, came from a quarter as unexpected as Algernon Charles Swinburne:<blockquote>More nauseous and more foolish cant was never chattered than that which would deride the memory or deprecate the merits of Bowdler. No man ever did better service to Shakespeare than the man who made it possible to put him into the hands of intelligent and imaginative children; it may well be, if we consider how dearly the creator of Mamillius must have loved them, that no man has ever done him such good service. (Swinburne, &#145;Social verse&#146;, <span class="italic">Works</span>, 15.278)</blockquote>
