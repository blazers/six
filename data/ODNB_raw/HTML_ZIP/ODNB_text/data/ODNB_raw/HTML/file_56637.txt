<span class="headword">Mounsey,  James</span>  (1709/10&#150;1773), <span class="occ">physician and naturalist</span>, was born at Skipmire, 3 miles west of Lochmaben, Dumfriesshire, the son of the merchant Thomas Mounsey (1658/9&#150;1714) and his second wife, Mary Steel (1683/4&#150;1747), sister of the Lochmaben minister. He studied medicine at Edinburgh University under Charles Alston (1729) and Alexander Monro <i>primus</i> (1730) but did not graduate and was apprenticed on 20 March 1731 for three years to the Edinburgh surgeon Thomas Wood, and then signed a three-year contract in July 1736 with the Russian ambassador in London. After working at the St Petersburg Admiralty Hospital he was posted in March 1738, on an outbreak of the plague, to the Russian forces in Ukraine. Accompanying General James Keith, wounded in the Russo-Turkish War, to Paris for medical treatment in November 1738, he graduated MD at Rheims University on 9 November 1739. On his return to Russia he re-enlisted as a doctor to the land militia corps in August 1741, but transferred in 1742 to Keith's army at &Aring;bo, Finland, during the Russo-Swedish War. This was followed by service with the Livonian division, Prince Repin's corps in central Europe (where, as at Kalmar, Sweden, in 1744, he showed great capacity in organizing field hospitals), and, finally, with the 1st Moscow division (1750&#150;56).<br>
<br>In 1747 Henry Baker initiated a correspondence with him, resulting in six publications in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>, and fellowship of the Royal Society on 8 March 1750. Mounsey's papers included a summary of his very skilful operation at &Aring;bo in 1742 to remove a foetus lodged in a Finnish woman's Fallopian tube for thirteen years  (<span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 45, 1748, 131&#150;7), outlined more comprehensively in the Swedish Academy's <span class="italic">Handlingar</span> for 1744 (vol. 5, 102&#150;14; in Sweden he had met and corresponded with Linnaeus, narrowly missing election to the academy); one on the &#145;quab&#146;, or &#145;frog-fish&#146;, <i>Pseudis paradoxa</i>, a frog from Surinam and the Guianas whose very large tadpoles develop into much smaller froglets (<span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 45, 1748, 175&#150;6; and see Klaver, 201&#150;2); some excellent descriptions of the Karlsbad thermal springs and salt-mines near Cracow  (<span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 46, 1749, 217&#150;32); and the detailed case history of an English wallpaper stainer whom he treated in Moscow for lead poisoning  (<span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 50, 1758, 19&#150;22; 54, 1764, 15&#150;23). On 1 May 1754 Mounsey married, as his second wife, Joanna Grieve, a relative of James Grieve (1708&#150;1763), Moscow city physician. (He had a son and a daughter by his first marriage.) Two months later he escorted Grand Duke Peter and his wife Catherine to St Petersburg, obtaining microscopes and telescopes made by John Cuff and James Short, the London optical instrument makers. In September 1756 he was sent, on the empress's orders, to treat the former duke of Courland's wife at Yaroslavl, leaving the army, highly commended by the medical chancery, to engage in extremely successful private medical practice at Moscow.<br>
<br>Elected one of the Society of Arts' earliest corresponding members, in April 1755, Mounsey sent it useful information in 1756 and 1760, respectively, about marketing British manufactures abroad and providing winter feed for livestock. Sir John Pringle, in his &#145;Medical annotations&#146;  (5.329 and 7.267&#150;8), and in his November 1776 presidential address to the Royal Society, incorporated Mounsey's findings on the effectiveness of Russian kvass, a drink fermented with malt and rye, and rye bread leavened with malt, in combating scurvy on land, at sea, and in gaols (which Mounsey visited at Moscow and St Petersburg in the early 1750s after reading Pringle's <span class="italic">Observations on the Nature and Cure of Hospital and Jayl Fevers</span> (1750)). He also mediated the election of Count Kirill Razumovsky, president of the Russian Academy of Sciences, to the Royal Society in 1755, supplying Baker and the society with large numbers of minerals (1749&#150;57) and seeds (1752&#150;5) from Russia, Siberia, Astrakhan, Persia, and Bohemia, and reciprocating with twelve Moscow birds for the twelve prints of birds and a copy of his <span class="italic">Natural History of Uncommon Birds</span> sent to him in 1757 by George Edwards, to whose <span class="italic">Gleanings of Natural History</span> he subscribed in 1764. In September 1760 Mounsey became the Empress Elizabeth's personal physician with the title of councillor of state; he tended her at her deathbed in December 1761, and his account of her final illness was printed in the <span class="italic">St Petersburg Journal</span> on 28 December. Her successor, Peter III, appointed him his chief physician, privy councillor with the rank of lieutenant-general, and archiater, or director, of the medical chancery, responsible for all Russian medical affairs&#151;civilian, military, and naval. Within four months Mounsey had compiled, and the senate ratified, three significant pieces of medical legislation: a table of ranks, with a supplement, integrating military and civilian posts by rank and function for the first time, an extensive report on medicine in Russia, and a precept for doctors&#151;all evidence of his considerable knowledge, experience, and administrative flair. The tsar was poisoned and strangled on 17 July 1762 and the widowed Empress Catherine dismissed Mounsey, Russia's last archiater, on health grounds and with a pension, five days later.<br>
<br>On arrival at Edinburgh in 1762 Mounsey gave Sir Alexander Dick, president of the Royal College of Physicians, a parcel of medicinal rhubarb seeds (<i>Rheum palmatum</i> L.), gathered from a single plant, sown at St Petersburg Apothecaries' Garden in 1754 from seed obtained on the Russo-Chinese border. John Hope, professor of botany, cultivated them at the Royal Botanical Gardens, describing the plant in a letter to Sir John Pringle which appeared in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> in 1766. For introducing medicinal rhubarb, Mounsey was elected an honorary member of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in November 1762 and received the Society of Arts' gold medal in 1770. Widely disseminated, the plant was successfully cultivated in Britain for the first time, and specimens grown by John Inglish, another gold medallist, from seed sent by Mounsey to Baker in 1763, produced further seed which Benjamin Franklin propagated in 1770 to John Bartram, the pioneer Philadelphian botanist. Mounsey purchased Killielung Farm near Dumfries and built a mansion in 1763 at Rammerscales, reputedly assassination-proof, on an estate 4 miles south of Lochmaben. He became an Edinburgh city burgess and guild brother in December 1762, and a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh. As shown by his arms matriculated a year later, he was elected master of the Lochmaben masons in 1769 and the burgh's ruling elder to the general assembly in 1768, 1769, and 1772. Thirty-two letters (1747&#150;72) in the Phillimore MSS at the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth, reveal much about his medical practice, colleagues, and the merchant community in Russia, as well as his continuing interest in natural history. During 1771 he travelled to Latvia to arrange the duke of Courland's election to the Royal Society, whose dining club Mounsey attended on nine occasions between 1771 and 1772. Dying of a bowel infection at Edinburgh on 2 February 1773, before his petition for a baronetcy could be processed, and characterized by James Boswell as &#145;a very well informed man and communicative&#146;, he was commemorated by a 30-foot high monument in Lochmaben's old churchyard.<br>
