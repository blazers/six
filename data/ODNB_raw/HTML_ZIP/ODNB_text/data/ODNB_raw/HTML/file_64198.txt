<span class="headword">Gwilliam,  Freda Howitt</span>  (1907&#150;1987), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born on 29 July 1907 at Feltham, Middlesex, the only daughter of Frederick William Gwilliam, a prison governor, and Kate Elizabeth Howitt. She was educated at Rochester Girls' Grammar School, Kent, at Notting Hill high school, London, and at Girton College, Cambridge, from where she graduated with a BA honours degree in history in 1929 (MA, 1934). She subsequently taught at Falmouth county high school from 1929 to 1931 and the Francis Holland School, London, from 1931 to 1936 before becoming a lecturer at the Bishop Otter Teachers' Training College in 1936 and then principal of the Brighton Training College from 1941 to 1946. In May 1947, aged almost forty and after much soul-searching, she abandoned the security and status of a senior teaching position for the uncertainty of the newly created post of woman educational adviser at the Colonial Office.<br>
<br>During the next twenty-three years (from 1947 to 1970) Freda was to play a unique role in the promotion of education, and in particular teacher training and the education of women and girls, throughout the British colonial empire. From the outset she proved to be an inveterate and indefatigable traveller in an age which largely preceded jet air travel and one of the best-known of the Whitehall advisory staff to numerous directors of education in Britain's far-flung outposts of empire. Her visits provoked mixed feelings from colonial officials, her initial question invariably being &#145;Now what are you doing for the girls?&#146; Woe betide the director of education who did not have a convincing answer ready to hand. Over the years she was also a constant and invaluable source of inside knowledge to her immediate superior, Sir Christopher Cox. Her many letters to him from abroad were always highly informative and exceedingly frank, and reflected a very close working relationship with him. When not away on tour, Freda spent much of her time recruiting and interviewing prospective female staff for service abroad.<br>
<br>Throughout her life Freda was a staunch Anglican with a strong social conscience which manifested itself in a variety of roles. These included a member of the house of laity and the World Council of Churches, a JP, a youth worker in Battersea in the 1930s and later with the Red Cross Society and the Girls' Training Corps, the chairperson of the executive committee of Voluntary Services Overseas, a council member of the Associated Country Women of the World, and an honorary fellow of the College of Preceptors.<br>
<br>Freda made no claim to academic scholarship&#151;writing reports reduced her to pulp&#151;but she was a popular and frequent lecturer to students in the colonial department of the London Institute of Education in the 1950s. When in London she also regularly attended the monthly meetings of the advisory committee on education in the colonies and served on its numerous subcommittees. She was also deeply involved in the staging of the Cambridge conference on African education in 1952 and the first Commonwealth education conference held at Oxford in 1959. Her services to colonial education were formally acknowledged by her appointment as OBE in 1954 and CBE in 1966, and the award of an honorary DLitt from the New University of Ulster, Coleraine, in 1973.<br>
<br>By the late 1960s Freda was aware that it was time to make way for new blood. To Cox she wrote &#145;I should go. &hellip; I'm the Great Aunt figure&#151;the batterer at doors that are opening ajar&#151;unable to move with the young (why should I&#151;with my life behind me)&#146;  (Gwilliam to Cox, 2 May 1968, Cox MSS). Her last major educational assignment was to lead the British delegation to the conference on education in rural areas held at the University of Ghana in March 1970.<br>
<br>Freda Gwilliam never married. She lived out her well-earned but characteristically busy retirement with her late brother's family in the village of Frant in Sussex where she became a much loved and respected figure. Her last major public duty occurred in 1972 when she served as the only woman member of the commission of inquiry led by Lord Pearce, which visited Rhodesia to determine whether the people supported proposals for a settlement of the constitutional crisis. She died unexpectedly at her home, One Ash, Frant, on 14 August 1987, aged eighty. Freda Gwilliam belonged to that breed of tough and tireless ladies who fostered the education of girls across the globe. She was no feminist but she helped many thousands of women in developing countries. She was equally no do-gooder, but she did untold good.<br>
