<span class="headword">Elfoddw</span>  (<em>d.</em> 809), <span class="occ">archbishop of Gwynedd</span>, is known for three things. First, in 768, he is said by the <span class="italic">Annales Cambriae</span> to have brought about the adherence of the Britons to the Roman method of calculating Easter. He is there described as &#145;a man of God&#146; which implies that the annalist perceived him as saintly, and perhaps also, though less certainly, that his reputation for holiness played some part in persuading the Britons to abandon their traditional paschal cycle. This is the last known change from the customs adopted by the Britons, probably in the fifth century, which they had spread to the Irish, and which were then handed on by the Irish to the Picts and the Northumbrians. It is not known, however, when the Bretons and Cornishmen adopted the Roman Easter. The change brought about by Elfoddw was not the first among his people. Bede says that some of the Britons conformed to the Roman Easter having been persuaded by Adomn&aacute;n about 690. These were presumably the Britons of Strathclyde, with whom Iona had good relations, as shown by Adomn&aacute;n's life of Columba. Bede's information also indicates that the churches of Strathclyde were not directly subject to Iona, since those that were subject apparently did not change at that date.<br>
<br>The second notable thing about Elfoddw is the description of him in his obit as &#145;archbishop of Gwynedd&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annales Cambriae</span>, s.a. 809). He is not claimed to be &#145;archbishop of Britannia&#146;&#151;that is, of Wales&#151;as one might have expected, given some of the models for such a claim: both Kildare and Armagh had, in the seventh century, claimed to be the sees of archbishops of all Ireland. Their claims were probably modelled on the position given to Theodore of Tarsus (<i>d</i>. 690), namely archbishop of the island of Britain. As Theodore was archbishop of one island, so might Kildare, or Armagh, provide an archbishop of the other island. A British response to such claims might have taken the form of an archbishopric of Britannia (meaning Wales), yet Elfoddw was only said to be archbishop of Gwynedd. This makes it more likely that the model was the English situation after 735, when there was one archbishopric for the northern English at York and another for the southern English at Canterbury. Elfoddw's archbishopric of Gwynedd may have been the northern archbishopric of Britannia. Asser (<i>d</i>. 909) avers without any apparent sense of stating something remarkable that his kinsman Nobis of St David's was archbishop. There may thus have been a southern archbishopric of Dyfed alongside a northern archbishopric of Gwynedd.<br>
<br>It is usually said that these claims must have been remote from reality because no Welsh bishop could have received a pallium from Rome or had his title of archbishop conferred by the pope. This argument rests on anachronistic assumptions. Theodore's archbishopric represented an extension to the west of a position previously set out, without any reference to the papacy, by the emperor Justinian (<i>r</i>. 527&#150;65): the archbishop or patriarch was to be the ecclesiastical head of an imperial diocese, such as Egypt or Britain, while the metropolitan bishop corresponded to an imperial province and the bishop to a city and its territory. A different, probably consciously anti-imperial, scheme is set out by Isidore of Seville (570&#150;636) in his <span class="italic">Etymologiae</span>: patriarchs were only for apostolic sees, such as Alexandria or Rome (he carefully does not include Constantinople), while below the patriarch come archbishops, metropolitan bishops, and the ordinary bishops of cities. Neither Isidore's patriarchs nor his archbishops are said to have required papal pallia: as the register of Gregory the Great shows, pallia were given on occasion to ordinary bishops; they were not given to those metropolitan bishops in Illyricum who were traditionally known as archbishops. The link between the English metropolitan bishoprics and the papal pallium was created by the special papal sponsorship of the English mission; its link with an English archbishopric was created by the particular office conferred upon Theodore and his immediate successors. The elevation of York to an archbishopric was in substance a reversion to the earlier Gregorian scheme for Britain of two metropolitan bishoprics, but with the addition of the title of archbishop. There was no reason why an archbishop of Gwynedd should have been required to obtain a papal pallium, apart from the fact that, in the Gregorian scheme, all Britain was to be subject to his two metropolitan bishops. No doubt the claim would have been rejected at Canterbury and at Rome, but just the same problems were caused by the political impossibility of subjecting the Picts to an archbishop based at York.<br>
<br>The third guise in which Elfoddw appears is in the &#145;Nennian preface&#146; added in the tenth century to the &#145;Nennian&#146; or Cambridge recension of the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span>, itself composed in 829&#150;30. This claims that Nennius was a disciple of Elfoddw. While chronologically not impossible, this claim cannot be corroborated by evidence of ninth-century date.<br>
