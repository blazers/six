<span class="headword">Denton,  William</span>  (1815&#150;1888), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, born in March 1815 at Newport in the Isle of Wight, was the eldest son of James Denton of that town. He matriculated from Worcester College, Oxford, in 1841, graduating BA in 1844 and MA in 1848. Influenced by the Tractarian movement he was ordained deacon in 1844, as curate of St Andrew's, Bradfield, in Berkshire, where Thomas Stevens was rector, and priest in 1845, as curate of Barking. In 1847 he became curate of Shoreditch, and on 22 June 1848 married Jane, youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/767/', "William Hurst Ashpitel")</script>, architect, of Clapton Square. They had at least two sons.<br>
<br>In 1850 Denton was presented to the vicarage of St Bartholomew, Little Moorfields, Cripplegate, a crown living, which he retained until his death. As the incumbent of an inner-London parish, he took up the cause of the poor whose homes were demolished to make way for new railways. His <span class="italic">Observations on the displacement of the poor by metropolitan railways and other public improvements</span> (1861), which pointed out that railway companies chose routes through working-class areas because tenants there had fewer legal rights, and that the problems of overcrowding were increased by the tendency for housing adjoining railways to be turned over to warehouses, attracted considerable attention. On 28 February 1861 the earl of Derby presented a petition from Denton to the House of Lords, and the question was debated for two nights. He later gave evidence to the royal commission on the housing of the working classes (1884&#150;5), advocating that industries should be moved out of city centres into suburbs, where workers could be rehoused in healthy surroundings.<br>
<br>Denton had personal contacts with members of the Orthodox church in the Near East, and produced in 1862 <span class="italic">Servia and the Servians</span>, one of the first well-informed books in English on Serbia. He subsequently produced an edition of Chedomil Miyatovi&#263;'s <span class="italic">Serbian Folklore</span> (1874) and a work on Montenegro (1877). His <span class="italic">The Christians in Turkey</span> (1863), which alleged that British diplomats had carried out a conspiracy of silence about the sufferings of Christians under Ottoman rule, initially attracted little notice, but in 1876, when the &#145;Bulgarian atrocities&#146; had aroused public outrage, the original edition sold out and a new and enlarged edition appeared. A third edition was reached in 1877, and was translated into German and Serbian. He was on the platform of the National Convention on the Eastern Question, chaired by the duke of Westminster and Lord Shaftesbury, at St James's Hall, London, in December 1876. In recognition of his campaigning on behalf of Balkan Christians he was created a knight commander of the Serbian order of St Saviour of Takhova, and awarded a grand cross of the order of St Saba.<br>
<br>Apart from occasional sermons, Denton published commentaries on the gospels for Sundays and holy days (3 vols., 1861&#150;3), the Lord's prayer (1864), the <span class="roman">Epistles</span> (2 vols., 1869&#150;71), and the <span class="roman">Acts of the Apostles</span> (2 vols., 1874&#150;6). In 1863 he published an edition based on the original manuscripts of the <span class="italic">Sacra privata</span> of Thomas Wilson (1663&#150;1755), bishop of Sodor and Man. His last work was a study of <span class="roman">England in the fifteenth century</span> (1888). Denton died at his home, 22 Westbourne Square, Paddington, London, on 2 January 1888.<br>
