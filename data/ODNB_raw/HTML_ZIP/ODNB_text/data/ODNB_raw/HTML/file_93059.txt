<span class="headword">Gillies,  Ian Malcolm</span>  (1927&#150;2002), <span class="occ">question-setter and broadcaster</span>, was born at Upper Heath, Hampstead, London, on 7 December 1927, the son of Duncan Neil Gillies, company accountant, and his wife, Elsie Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nowell, of 16B Golders Way, Golders Green, London. He spent his early life in London, but was evacuated to Worcester in 1940 and educated at the city's Royal Grammar School. From there he went to Jesus College, Oxford, where he read modern history. After graduating with a second-class degree in 1949, he spent his national service in the RAF, indulging his boyhood love of aviation. He was posted to RAF Felixstowe, and was quickly appointed the station's education officer. After two years' service he returned to London and joined the advertising firm of Saward Baker as an account director.<br>
<br>Gillies's general knowledge was already exceptional. According to a colleague at Felixstowe &#145;he had a wide and deep knowledge of history, politics, world affairs, cricket, literature, music, art, religions, philosophy&#151;and he could instantly recall facts relating to any of them&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>). Impressed by this, a girlfriend persuaded him to enter <span class="italic">What Do You Know?</span>, the jauntily named national quiz of the BBC Home Service. Gillies won the 1964 series, as well as two subsequent programmes, <span class="italic">Brain of Brains</span> (in 1965), in which past winners of <span class="italic">What Do You Know?</span> competed against each other, and <span class="italic">Top Brain</span> (in 1971), in which he defeated the other winners of <span class="italic">Brain of Brains</span>. He could justly be described as the finest contestant the series had seen in its nineteen-year history, and in 1972 he was sent, with Irene Thomas, to Australia to compete for the title of <span class="italic">Brain of the World</span>.<br>
<br>In 1967 <span class="italic">What Do You Know?</span> was renamed <span class="italic">Brain of Britain</span>. When its avuncular chairman, Franklin Engelmann, died suddenly in the middle of the 1972 series, Gillies, as reigning &#145;top brain&#146;, was invited to take over for the final ten programmes. Although he acquitted himself well, Robert Robinson, a more experienced broadcaster and a more famous name, was appointed full-time chairman for the 1973 series. Gillies, however, was retained as the programme's adjudicator. In this role he was required to sit at Robinson's side and determine whether a contestant's vague stab at an answer was sufficiently close to the correct version to merit a point. To preserve his anonymity and cultivate a certain mystique Robinson dubbed him Mycroft, after Sherlock Holmes's older brother, of whom, like Gillies, it was said that &#145;all other men are specialists, but his specialism is omniscience&#146;  (A. Conan Doyle, &#145;The adventure of the Bruce-Partington plans&#146;, in <span class="italic">The Complete Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</span>, 1980 edn, 914). This being radio, however, Gillies was amused to receive letters from some of his less omniscient audience addressed to &#145;Mike Croft&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Gillies was by this stage writing most, if not all, of the questions for <span class="italic">Brain of Britain</span>, and to accommodate this huge task he had left advertising in 1971. In a quiz book derived from the programme he described his method:<blockquote>About a quarter of my questions are inspired during ordinary reading of newspapers, magazines or books, by radio or television, and the like, or even occur to me apparently without external prompting. The remaining three-quarters I have consciously to sit down and set. I have twelve subject categories, five major ones, Geography, History, Literature, Science and Technology, and Miscellaneous, and seven minor ones, Current Affairs and Politics, Flags and Heraldry, Music, the other Performing Arts, Religion and Mythology, the Visual Arts, and Sports. For each half-hour quiz I set seventy questions, nine or ten of each of the major categories and between two and four of the minor ones. Thus for a twenty-three programme series I know I will need, for example, about two hundred and thirty geography questions, ninety current affairs, and fifty sport &hellip; To build up contestants' confidence the first question each gets in each of the first two rounds is meant to be very easy, and in fact all the first twenty are on the easy side; the next twenty or so between the two music inserts are the hardest, and from there they get easier so that the programme ends on a high note rather than with lots of &#145;I don't knows&#146;. (Gillies, 6)</blockquote>The high notes of <span class="italic">Brain of Britain</span> prompted Radio 4 to devise another national quiz, this time devoted to music. <span class="italic">Counterpoint</span> was launched in 1986 with Ned Sherrin as its chairman. Gillies joined the production team as a question-setter in 1988, and succeeded the programme's first producer, Edward Cole, as referee in 1993. For this programme he was renamed (by Sherrin) Young Grove, after the founder of the musical dictionary. He remained in this role until the 2002 series (when he was succeeded as question-setter by Stephen Follows). He had by this time discovered that he was suffering from prostate cancer, and he retired simultaneously from both <span class="italic">Counterpoint</span> and <span class="italic">Brain of Britain</span> (where his successor was Kevin Ashman, the most accomplished winner of the programme since Gillies's own triumphs of the 1960s). He died of cancer at Southend Hospital, Essex (near his home in Warren Road, Leigh-on-Sea), on 13 April 2002. He was unmarried, though it was said that &#145;he always had an eye for a pretty girl&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>).<br>
