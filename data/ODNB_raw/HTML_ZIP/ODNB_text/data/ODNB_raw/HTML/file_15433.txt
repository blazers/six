<span class="headword">Keogh,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1650&#150;1725), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland clergyman and scientist</span>, was born near Limerick at &#145;Cloonclieve&#146; (probably Clooncleagh in co. Tipperary), the son of Denis Keogh and his wife (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Wittington), widow of a clergyman named Eyres. The Keoghs, descended from an old Irish Catholic family, the Mac Eochaidh, had lost their lands near the rivers Shannon and Mulkear during the Cromwellian wars. John Keogh was educated by his protestant mother who kept him at a school in Dublin, where he entered Trinity College in 1669. He was a scholar of the college in 1674, proceeded MA in 1678, and took orders in the episcopal Church of Ireland. He twice competed unsuccessfully for a fellowship of the college. John Hodson, possibly a relative and bishop of Elphin, appointed him to a living in that diocese and he was installed prebendary of Termonbarry in February 1678.<br>
<br>Keogh married in 1679 Avis Clopton, daughter of Dr Rous Clopton, of an old Warwickshire family that had settled under Cromwell near Athlone, and his wife, formerly Mrs Day. The Keoghs may have had as many as twenty-one children. He settled down to a scholar's life at Strokestown, co. Roscommon, where he also kept a school and prepared pupils for the University of Dublin. His favourite studies seem to have been Hebrew and the application of mathematics to mystical religious problems. Keogh wrote a demonstration of the Trinity in Latin verse, which was shown by his son John to Isaac Newton who expressed approval of it. In his &#145;Scala metaphysica&#146; Keogh attempted a mathematical demonstration of a dependence on God of a scale of beings from the highest angel to the lowest insect. A part of his extensive writings, none of which were published, may have been destroyed by a fire at his residence. However, a number of manuscript works, including a Hebrew lexicon, a work entitled &#145;De orthographia&#146;, Latin and Greek grammars, and an &#145;Analogy of the four gospels&#146;, were saved. Some of Keogh's manuscripts were deposited in the library of Archbishop William King and subsequently sold.<br>
<br>In 1684 and 1685 Keogh was associated with William Molyneux and the Dublin Philosophical Society. He wrote in March 1684 to Molyneux enclosing a detailed description of co. Roscommon intended as a contribution to the Irish part of Moses Pitt's &#145;English atlas&#146;. In correspondence with Molyneux, Keogh expressed enthusiasm for the aims of the Dublin Philosophical Society and received information on its progress and activities. In December 1684 Keogh informed the society of various investigations including that of a philosophical character or characteristic. He worked on this topic for about a year and at the end of 1685 he presented a discourse to the society, then under the chairmanship of St George Ashe. His philosophical character may have proved a disappointment, however, and no more was heard of the project after 1685. In one respect Keogh stood out among the members of the society, namely in his extensive use of Latin in contributions. When in 1707 and 1708 the Dublin Philosophical Society was revived under its secretary Samuel Molyneux, Keogh was once again a corresponding member reporting on curiosities such as a giant tooth and rare plants grown in greenhouses near Athlone.<br>
<br>Keogh died in 1725 and was survived by six of his children including sons Michael (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1734) and <a name="cosubject_15433"></a><span class="headword">John Keogh</span>  (1680/81&#150;1754), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland clergyman and author of scientific and medical tracts</span>. Like their father both sons entered the church. Michael was beneficed in the diocese of Elphin at Strokestown and John, after acting for some time as chaplain to James King, fourth Lord Kingston, obtained the living of Mitchelstown, co. Cork. John married Elizabeth, daughter of Dr Henry Jennings, a cousin of the duchess of Marlborough, and had three sons and three daughters. He died in 1754 aged seventy-three. His published books, <span class="italic">Botanologia universalis Hibernica, or, A general Irish herbal &hellip; giving an account of the herbs, shrubs and trees &hellip; in English, Irish and Latin</span> (1735) and <span class="italic">Zoologica medica Hibernica, or, A treatise of birds, beasts, fishes, reptiles, or insects &hellip; in this kingdom, giving &hellip; their names in English, Irish and Latin</span> (1739), emphasized the medicinal value of plants and animals and separate medical tracts were appended to these. A third work, in which he included an account of his family, entitled <span class="italic">A vindication of the antiquities of Ireland and a defense thereof against all calumnies and aspersions cast on it by foreigners</span> (1748) contains an appended etymological tract on Irish names and is distinctly patriotic in character.<br>
