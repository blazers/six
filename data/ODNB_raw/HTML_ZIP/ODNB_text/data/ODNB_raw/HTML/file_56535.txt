<span class="headword">Cohen <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Kellner]</span>,  Elsie</span>  (1895&#150;1972), <span class="occ">cinema owner</span>, was born in Amsterdam on 14 June 1895, the daughter and second child of Joseph Cohn (1865/6&#150;1937), textile merchant, and his wife, Jenny (1868/9&#150;1934). Her parents were of German nationality. She was brought up in London, where her father was a commercial traveller for a corset manufacturer, and was educated at Priory College and at Queen's College, London. She was sometimes known as Elsa, and used the surname Cohen. She entered the cinema industry in 1915 as a junior sub-editor on the trade paper <span class="italic">Kinematograph Weekly</span>, beating numerous male applicants who were liable to be called up in the war. She became deeply interested in films, particularly after conducting a long interview in 1916 with the director D. W. Griffith when he went to London for the opening of his epic <span class="italic">Intolerance</span> (1916). In 1919 she accepted the post of publicity manager for the Hollandia film-making company in Holland, becoming the studio manager and its travelling sales executive until the owner died and it closed down. She then worked in Germany before becoming floor manager on a British film, <span class="italic">His House in Order</span>, starring Tallulah Bankhead, made in 1927.<br>
<br>In 1929 Elsie Cohen discovered that an old cinema, the Palais de Luxe, in the West End of London was vacant for a short while prior to its reconstruction as the Windmill Theatre. She decided to use the building to show important foreign films which were not being seen in the centre of London, and achieved a great success. This became the first art cinema in the country.<br>
<br>It was not until 1931 that Elsie Cohen found a new base for showing foreign films&#151;the Academy Cinema in Oxford Street, where she gained the support of cinema owner Eric Hakim. She started with one-week revivals of famous silent films from the continent and scored a huge success with the Russian <span class="italic">Earth</span> (1930), followed by <span class="italic">Turksib</span> (1929), <span class="italic">The End of St Petersburg</span> (1927), and others, also reviving the British documentary <span class="italic">Drifters</span> (1929). She then went abroad, acquiring new sound films from France, Germany, and Sweden, the Netherlands, and Russia to show at the Academy, supported by worthwhile shorts. Among her major successes were <span class="italic">Kameradschaft</span> (1931) and <span class="italic">M&auml;dchen in Uniform</span> (1931), of which <span class="italic">Close-up</span> magazine in its June 1932 issue noted: &#145;Actually, we are becoming so accustomed to assisting at the best Cosmopolitan talkies at the Academy that we are apt to forget the initial miracle of having a specialised theatre in sleepy London&#146;.<br>
<br>Elsie Cohen was soon launching films with lavish premi&egrave;res that attracted royalty and leading society figures, even persuading director Ren&eacute; Clair to grace with his presence the opening in 1935 of <span class="italic">Le dernier milliardaire</span>&#151;but she made a policy of providing a section of low-price seats within the reach of students and other impecunious film enthusiasts. Part of her marketing skill lay in building up a mailing list which was used to send detailed information about each new choice of film.<br>
<br>The Academy was so successful that it encouraged other cinemas like the Boltons at Kensington to show foreign pictures, widening the market for quality subtitled releases. Elsie Cohen herself expanded operations to run foreign films at Cinema House in Oxford Circus for several years, and later at the Berkeley Cinema in Mayfair.<br>
<br>After 1937 Cohen dropped German films and concentrated on French productions, introducing British audiences to such master-works as Jean Renoir's <span class="italic">La grande illusion</span> in 1938 and <span class="italic">Quai des Brumes</span> in 1939. She was managing director of Unity Films, which imported many of the productions.<br>
<br>Occasionally there were censorship problems. Showing the documentary <span class="italic">Spanish Earth</span> in the late 1930s, Elsie Cohen was forced to eliminate almost all the footage revealing German support for General Franco but alerted the press to the glimpse that remained, creating headlines. When she was refused a censor's certificate to show the Russian anti-Nazi film <span class="italic">Professor Mamlock</span> (1938), she gained a special licence from the London county council and was playing the film at the declaration of war in September 1939.<br>
<br>Elsie Cohen had planned to open a chain of Academy cinemas in the provinces until war intervened. The Academy itself was forced to close in October 1940 because of bomb damage and passed into the hands of a receiver. George Hoellering, an Austrian who had impressed Elsie Cohen with his film <span class="italic">Hortobagy</span> and settled in England, becoming a director of the Academy before the war, was able to re-open the cinema in 1944. It was soon re-established as London's leading art house but Elsie Cohen, to her regret, was no longer involved. During the war and until 1947, she organized the recording of entertainment broadcasts for the troops and their distribution overseas.<br>
<br>As Elsa Cohen she married, at Hampstead register office on 27 September 1933, Endre, or Andrew, Kellner (1901/2&#150;1959), medical practitioner, son of William Kellner, a government official in Hungary. He was naturalized a British subject in 1935. They divorced in 1936. From 1939 she lived at Rottingdean, Sussex, and in 1968 moved to Saltdean, where she died at her home, 13 Heathfield Avenue, following a long illness, on 26 January 1972, and was cremated at the Downs crematorium, Brighton.<br>
