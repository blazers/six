<span class="headword">Jenkins,  John</span> <span class="st"> [Ifor Ceri]</span>  (1770&#150;1829), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and antiquary</span>, was born on 8 April 1770 at Cilbronnau, a farmhouse in Llangoedmor, Cardiganshire; exact details of his parents are unknown, though (according to Foster) he may have been the son of one Griffith Jenkins. He was educated at the village school, then went to the Carmarthen Academy, from there to Jesus College, Oxford, and then to Merton College, where he graduated BA in 1793. In the same year he was ordained deacon and went as curate to his uncle, rector of Whippingham on the Isle of Wight. In 1799 Jenkins became chaplain in the <i>Agincourt</i> in the West Indies, later transferring to the <i>Theseus</i>. Returning home to recover his health, he was appointed rector of Manordeifi, Pembrokeshire, and in 1807 he became vicar of Ceri in Montgomeryshire, the living being in the gift of Thomas Burgess, bishop of St David's.<br>
<br>Jenkins took the name by which he was known in antiquarian circles, Ifor Ceri, from the parish where he was vicar; the parsonage he had built for himself became known as Llys Ifor Hael (&#145;The court of Ifor the generous&#146;), a reference to Ifor ap Llywelyn, patron of Dafydd ap Gwilym, whom the poet had called Ifor Hael. He kept open house during the first week of every year for &#145;all comers provided only that they could compose an <i>englyn</i>, sing a song, or play the harp&#146;  (<span class="italic">DWB</span>, 434), and the place became a mecca for poets, musicians, and antiquaries from all parts of Wales.<br>
<br>One of the most distinguished visitors to enjoy the hospitality at Ceri was Bishop Burgess. In August 1818 he and Ifor Ceri hatched a plan &#145;to rekindle the bardic skill and ingenuity of the principality &hellip; by holding eisteddfodau in different places in the four provinces&#146;  (<span class="italic">DWB</span>, 434). The first of these eisteddfodau was held at the Ivy Bush inn in Carmarthen on 8 and 9 July 1819, an occasion at which the Gorsedd of Bards invented by Iolo Morganwg (Edward Williams) became an essential part of the proceedings. They were directed by Ifor Ceri, as were all their successors until 1829 when, at Denbigh, he came to the conclusion that English influence was more and more apparent and that the eisteddfod, in its emphasis on grand concerts, was becoming an &#145;Anglo-Italian farce&#146;  (ibid.). Even so, the provincial eisteddfodau were the forerunners of the national eisteddfod inaugurated towards the end of the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Ifor Ceri had begun collecting folk-songs as a young man, especially ballads and carols, for which he had a penchant. Some of his manuscripts were used by Maria Jane Williams (1795&#150;1873) of Aberpergwm in her <span class="italic">Ancient Welsh Music</span>; other tunes appeared in the <span class="italic">Cambrian Journal</span> between 1854 and 1857 or were included by John Parry (Bardd Alaw) in <span class="italic">The Welsh Harper</span> (vol.2, 1848), while some remain unpublished and are kept in the National Library of Wales. Ifor Ceri also collected psalm tunes and hymn tunes sung during the early years of the Methodist revival. In addition he was a local historian of some repute. He wrote the parish histories of Ceri and Mochdre included anonymously in <span class="italic">A Topographical History of Wales</span> (1811) by Nicholas Carlisle and again in William Cathrall's <span class="italic">The History of North Wales</span> (1828). His only writings in Welsh were the articles he contributed to the periodical <span class="italic">Y Gwyliedydd</span> under the pseudonym Hooker.<br>
<br>As one of the leading members of the group now known as <i>yr</i> <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95356', "hen bersoniaid llengar")</script> (&#145;the old literary clerics&#146;) Ifor Ceri played a crucial role in keeping alive a remembrance of early Welsh literature on which later scholars were able to build. Given the neglected state of Welsh scholarship in his day, his achievement in helping to reform the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion and in organizing the provincial eisteddfodau was all the more remarkable. That he was able to do so much against the prevailing attitudes of the established church&#151;Bishop Burgess was a shining exception to the widespread Anglican prejudice against all things Welsh&#151;says much for his patriotic zeal and tenacity. Ifor Ceri remained in Ceri from 1807 until his death, unmarried, on 20 November 1829.<br>
