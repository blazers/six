<span class="headword">Radford,  Nicholas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1455), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was the son of Robert Radford of Okeford, Devon. Radford first appeared on the scene in 1420 when he stood as surety for the lessees of two Somerset manors, was appointed a feoffee for a London goldsmith, and attended the shire elections at Exeter Castle. In 1421 he was elected MP for Lyme Regis; his only other election to parliament was in 1435 for the county of Devon. A justice of the peace in Devon from 1424 until his death, Radford also served as escheator of Devon and Cornwall in 1435&#150;6, and on numerous royal commissions of inquiry in Devon, Cornwall, Somerset, and Wiltshire. Married by 1431, he became a wealthy man and purchased lands in Devon at Grantland, North Yeo, Babbadon, and Cheriton Fitzpaine along with the manors of Cadeleigh, Poughill, and Ford. At his death he had goods worth well over &pound;1337 and a minimum of &pound;780 in cash.<br>
<br>Described at his death as &#145;one of the most notable and famous&#146; apprentices-at-law  (Radford, &#145;Nicholas Radford&#146;, 274), Radford's legal skill and reputation are evident in his wide client base. He was retained by several Devon boroughs, especially Exeter which he served in the office of city recorder from 1442 until his death, at a salary of &pound;3 per annum plus other fees. During the mayoralty of John Shillingford in 1447&#150;50 Radford was Exeter's chief representative in London, and its legal adviser in a suit brought against the city by the dean and chapter of Exeter Cathedral and by Edmund Lacy, bishop of Exeter, over their jurisdictional claims in Exeter. Many prominent members of the gentry, especially in Devon, also sought Radford's legal advice. Cardinal Henry Beaufort, John Holland, earl of Huntingdon, Humphrey Stafford, earl of Stafford, the duchy of Lancaster, members of the Carew family, and the Courtenay earls of Devon were among his more notable clients.<br>
<br>Radford's contact with the Courtenays began in 1423, when he was appointed joint steward of the estates of the earldom of Devon until the heir, Thomas Courtenay (<i>d</i>. 1458), came of age <i>c</i>.1435. Radford became close enough to the family to act as godfather to the earl's second son, Henry. Radford's relations with the Courtenays later soured, however, as he came more and more to be associated with Sir William Bonville (<i>d</i>. 1461), Lord Bonville from 1449, a Devon landowner who, with the support of William de la Pole, earl of Suffolk (<i>d</i>. 1450), from the 1430s contested the pre-eminence in south-west England hitherto enjoyed by the earls of Devon. An increasingly bitter struggle led to serious disorders, and Bonville's success in avoiding their consequences probably owed much to Radford's counsel.<br>
<br>Whether the earl authorized the killing of Radford is uncertain, but he certainly sheltered the murderers and participated in the ensuing cover-up. The murder and subsequent events are related in several contemporary accounts. Late on the night of 23 October 1455, Sir Thomas Courtenay (<i>d</i>. 1461), the eldest son of Earl Thomas, arrived at Radford's manor house in Upcott Barton (about 11 miles north of Exeter) at the head of an armed band of some ninety men. Woken by the noise, Radford agreed to come down and talk only after Sir Thomas had promised as a knight and gentleman that no harm would come to him or his goods. But once inside the house Courtenay distracted Radford while his men broke open Radford's coffers and stole valuable goods worth 1000 marks along with a good deal of cash; they even rolled Radford's invalid wife, Thomasina, out of her bed to take the very sheets on which she lay to bundle up some of their loot. Courtenay then lured Radford out of the house by telling him that the earl wished to see him; only a stone's throw away, however, Courtenay rode off saying &#145;Farewell, Radford&#146; and leaving behind several followers who then stabbed Radford to death.<br>
<br>The Courtenays' injuries against Radford did not stop there. Four days later Henry Courtenay, the earl's second son and Radford's godson, came to the chapel at Upcott where Radford's body lay, and held a farcical coroner's inquest which declared Radford a suicide. Henry Courtenay then ordered servants to bear Radford's body to the nearby churchyard of Cheriton Fitzpaine, where Courtenay's men cast the naked corpse into a pit and threw stones Radford had purchased for his own grave onto the body, crushing it beyond recognition. A few days later on 1 November the earl and his two sons marched at the head of some 1000 armed men from Tiverton to Exeter where they seized the gates of the city, set their own watch, and quartered in the city until 21 December. On 22 November the earl compelled the dean and treasurer of Exeter Cathedral to hand over goods worth &pound;600, and &pound;700 in money, which Radford had deposited with them. Two days later over a hundred of the earl's followers raided a house formerly belonging to Radford in Exeter and carried away more valuable plate, jewels, and money. Whether these actions of the Courtenays indicate that financial gain had been a motive for Radford's murder, or only show that they needed such plunder to pay their followers, is unclear.<br>
<br>News of Radford's murder and of the Courtenays' subsequent actions quickly reached London where they gave considerable strength to a petition to the lords by a group of MPs that Richard, duke of York, should be appointed protector of the realm for a second time. York duly became protector, but the Courtenays and the three murderers nevertheless eventually secured royal pardons for their actions, in spite of the complaints of Radford's heir and cousin, John Radford.<br>
