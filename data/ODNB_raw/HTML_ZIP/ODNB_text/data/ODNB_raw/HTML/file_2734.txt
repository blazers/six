<span class="headword">Boardman,  Andrew</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1595), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was a native of Lancashire. He was admitted a scholar of St John's College, Cambridge, on 9 November 1568, matriculating as a pensioner three days later. He graduated BA in early 1572, and was admitted fellow on Lady Margaret's foundation on 12 March 1573, the same day as his friend Everard Digby, to whose <span class="italic">Theoria analytica</span> (1579) he contributed some prefatory Greek verses. Having proceeded MA in 1575, on 5 September 1580 he was appointed Greek lecturer at St John's, and was elected one of the college preachers some days later, at Michaelmas. He was made junior bursar on 27 January 1582, and, proceeding BD shortly afterwards, was that year appointed minister of St Mary, Bury St Edmunds, where his house was identified in the feoffees' accounts for 1586 as &#145;next St. James steple&#146;.<br>
<br>Boardman left Bury in 1586, moving to the benefice then known as Allchurch, near Warwick. On 11 January 1591 he was appointed by the town corporation to the vicarage of the collegiate church of St Mary, Warwick. Here he clashed with the presbyterian Thomas Cartwright, master of Leycester's Hospital, who claimed that Boardman welcomed into his pulpit preachers who issued &#145;whole sermons invective&#146; against him  (Pearson, 451). Cartwright's imprisonment during the Star Chamber trials of 1590&#150;91 left him vulnerable, and in January 1592 he wrote to Lord Burghley that Boardman, already possessed of a living worth &pound;100 per annum, had designs on the hospital. If so, Boardman did not succeed, and Cartwright remained in possession.<br>
<br>In 1594 Boardman was granted the degree of DD at Cambridge, but in 1595 Thomas Hull succeeded to the vicarage of St Mary, and after this date nothing further is known of Boardman. Although he has been identified as the writer of some English commendatory verses, subscribed A. B., prefixed to Thomas Morley's <span class="italic">Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke</span> (1597), the attribution seems highly unlikely.<br>
