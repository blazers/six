<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Elliott,  Denholm Mitchell</span>  (1922&#150;1992), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 31 May 1922 at 48 Lexham Gardens, Kensington, London, the second son of Myles Layman Farr Elliott (<i>d</i>. 1933), barrister, and his wife, Nina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mitchell (<i>d</i>. 1966), the daughter of an Ayrshire old colonial. Elliott, who had lost the tip of his right thumb in a lawnmower accident, began acting at his preparatory school, Ripley Court, Surrey. In 1933 his father was killed by terrorists while he was serving as a crown prosecutor in Palestine, and Denholm was packed off to Malvern College. Detesting public-school life, he resorted to kleptomania until a psychiatrist recommended his enrolment at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Quitting after two terms, he joined the RAF as a gunner, only to be shot down off Denmark in 1942 and sent as a prisoner of war to Stalag 8B at Lansdorf, Silesia. Here he resumed his acting career as one of the No Name Players, taking roles as diverse as Macbeth and Eliza Doolittle.<br>
<br>Still in uniform, Elliott auditioned for Amersham repertory after his release in 1945, going on, the following year, to make both his West End bow in <span class="italic">The Guinea Pig</span> and his television d&eacute;but in <span class="italic">Mary Rose</span>. Great things were predicted for him after Laurence Olivier cast him in Christopher Fry's <span class="italic">Venus Observed</span> (1950), and he wowed Broadway as the twins in Jean Anouilh's <span class="italic">Ring Round the Moon</span> (1950). Yet he fell victim to the tumultuous changes occurring in British theatre in this period, not helping his situation by feuding with Binkie Beaumont of the all-powerful H. M. Tennent organization. At a time of &#145;angry young men&#146;, Elliott was &#145;tennis anyone?&#146;  (Elliott and Turner, 118), and so he sought refuge in cinema. Having made his screen d&eacute;but in <span class="italic">Dear Mr Prohack</span> (1949), he so impressed Sir Alexander Korda with his performance in David Lean's <span class="italic">The Sound Barrier</span> (1952) that he was offered a five-figure contract and the lead in a mooted Lawrence of Arabia biopic. But, following his excellent performance in <span class="italic">The Cruel Sea</span> (1953), he quickly became typecast as a gentleman cad in films such as <span class="italic">The Heart of the Matter</span> (1953). This professional slough was exacerbated by a personal crisis following his 1957 divorce from actress Virginia Anne McKenna (<i>b</i>. 1931), daughter of Terence McKenna, an auctioneer at Christies, whom he had married on 1 March 1954. However, his fortunes revived in 1962 when his marriage, on 15 June, to American model Susan Robinson (1942&#150;2007), daughter of Edwin Robinson, a magazine editor, was followed by his casting as &#145;a pompous, weak, opinionated creeper&#146;  (Elliott and Turner, 164) in <span class="italic">Station Six Sahara</span>, the first in a long line of unromantic losers that would make him one of cinema's most sought-after character actors.<br>
<br>Writing in <span class="italic">The Listener</span> in 1973, John Elsom described Elliott as &#145;one of nature's attendant lords&#146;  (Elliott and Turner, 244). Shy, sensitive, and easily discouraged, he resented authority without having the will or the anger to confront it. He considered acting a serious business, &#145;which I take seriously&#151;in an amateurish sort of way&#146;  (ibid., 273), and he was quite content to remain in support, because &#145;as a character actor you get interesting parts and are in a good position to steal the film&#146;  (ibid., 242). Gabriel Byrne, his co-star in <span class="italic">Defence of the Realm</span> (1985), testified to this genius for shameless upstaging when he declared: &#145;Never act with children, animals or Denholm Elliott&#146;  (302).<br>
<br>F&ecirc;ted for his cynical tutelage of Alan Bates in <span class="italic">Nothing but the Best</span> (1964), Elliott revealed his talent for sleaziness and corruption as the abortionist in <span class="italic">Alfie</span> (1966). Often accepting roles purely for the cash, he also delighted in rising above otherwise atrocious pictures, such as <span class="italic">Percy</span> (1969). Notable as the director reduced to filming bar mitzvahs in <span class="italic">The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz</span> (1974) and as the errant father in <span class="italic">Brimstone and Treacle</span> (1982), he excelled at seedy, dishevelled types, whose ill fortune was rooted in some private torment. However, Hollywood tended only to exploit his eccentric Englishness, with Steven Spielberg pitting him as Harrison Ford's mentor in <span class="italic">Raiders of the Lost Ark</span> (1981) and <span class="italic">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</span> (1989); John Landis used him as a sneering butler in <span class="italic">Trading Places</span> (1984). Yet he also possessed immaculate comic timing, as he demonstrated in <span class="italic">The Missionary</span> (1980) and <span class="italic">A Private Function</span> (1984), and he was eminently capable of the shabby gentility that brought him a best supporting actor Oscar nomination for his performance as Mr Emerson in Merchant-Ivory's <span class="italic">A Room with a View</span> (1985). In addition to his seventy-three features, Elliott was also regularly on television, particularly impressing in <span class="italic">School Play</span> (1979) and <span class="italic">Blade on the Feather</span> (1980), for which he won a BAFTA award. However, he was reluctant to return to the stage, although his work in <span class="italic">Hedda Gabler</span> (1972), <span class="italic">The Father</span> (1972), and <span class="italic">A Life in the Theatre</span> (1989) was much admired. Actively bisexual throughout his life, Elliott had already been identified as HIV positive by the time he was appointed a CBE in 1988. He died of AIDS-related tuberculosis at his long-time home of Santa Eulalia, Ibiza, Spain, on 2 October 1992. He was survived by his second wife and their two children, Jennifer (1964&#150;2003) and Mark (<i>b</i>. 1967). His ashes were scattered in the garden of Santa Eulalia.<br>
