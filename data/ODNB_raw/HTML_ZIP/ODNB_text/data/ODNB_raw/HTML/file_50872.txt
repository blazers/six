<span class="headword">Toms,  William Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1765), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was probably born in London, the son of Peter Toms, gentleman, of St Margaret's, Westminster, London. Details of his background and upbringing are unknown. His elder brother was the naval officer Peter Toms (1690/91&#150;1763), one-time commander of the <i>Saltash</i>; a fellow officer, Captain Philip Toms (<i>d</i>. 1772), was also a relation. Toms was apprenticed to the draughtsman and cartographer John Harris (<i>fl</i>. 1686&#150;1730), and his indenture of apprenticeship, which gives details of his father, is dated 30 April 1716  (Worms and Baynton-Williams, 670). He was married, first, to Rachael, with whom he lived at Union Court, Holborn, London; their son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27529/', "Peter Toms")</script>, was baptized on 3 July 1726 and later became a noted painter and herald. After a long illness his wife died about 1736. On 28 October 1738, at St Mary's, Marylebone, he married Anne (or Anna Maria) Sweet; the couple had two daughters, Sidney (<i>b</i>. 1739) and Henrietta Maria (<i>b</i>. 1743), and a son, William Henry (<i>b</i>. 1741), who were baptized at St Andrew's, Holborn.<br>
<br>Toms produced his first engravings in 1723 and 1724, but these were not published until after his death; the engraver's name appears on four plates, two of which are dated, in the second part of William Stukeley's <span class="italic">Itinerarium curiosum</span>, first published in 1776. Toms was a subscriber to John Dart's <span class="italic">Westmonasterium</span> in 1723, and in 1726 he appears in Samuel Sympson's list of leading engravers. Early plates by Toms appear in Michael Hoare's <span class="italic">The Builder's Pocket-Companion</span> and Batty Langley's <span class="italic">A Sure Method of Improving Estates</span>, both dated 1728, while in the following year he produced forty-eight plates for Stephen Switzer's <span class="italic">An Introduction to a General System of Hydraulicks and Hydrostaticks</span>.<br>
<br>Toms's output increased during the 1730s. William Williams's <span class="italic">Oxonia depicta</span> (1733?) featured eight of his plates, and in the same year Toms collaborated on Henry Popple's <span class="italic">A Map of the British Empire in America</span>&#151;the largest printed map of North America published during the colonial period. In 1734 he engraved a prospect of Greenwich Hospital which prompted George Vertue to note that Toms had &#145;lately done many works of Etching or Stylographic work with great skill and merrit&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note Books</span>, 30.194). From April 1735 Toms was commissioned by Francis Blomefield to engrave plates for <span class="italic">An Essay towards a Topographical History of the County of Norfolk</span>. Blomefield's correspondence offers insights into Toms's temperamental character. From the outset the engraver was dilatory and Blomefield was pressed to write three letters, each more demanding in tone, before the first proof was delivered. A second order was then issued, again requiring three additional letters before its delivery in January 1736, accompanied by an inflated bill. Had Blomefield's relationship with Francis Hoffman, Toms's potential replacement, not proved so disastrous, it is likely that the two men would have parted company. In the event Blomefield and Toms were reunited in 1736, at a time when Toms was desperate for work, due in part to his wife's ill health, which he informed Blomefield had cost him &#145;upward of two hundred pounds&#146;  (Stoker, 143). Relations briefly improved. In 1736 Toms executed the well-known <i>ex libris</i> for his patron, but by October of the following year Blomefield was again disputing charges; despite the two men continuing to collaborate until at least 1743, there were noticeably fewer commissions for Toms in later volumes of the <span class="italic">Essay</span>.<br>
<br>Between 1735 and 1739 Toms was engaged in a partnership with the painter Robert West on one of his most successful and best-known works, <span class="italic">Perspective Views of all the Ancient Churches, and Other Buildings, in the Cities of London, and Westminster</span>, a pioneering work and &#145;an indispensable record of the appearance of London churches mostly now vanished without trace or demolished and rebuilt&#146;  (Adams, 78). Despite the success of the work's first and second series in attracting both subscribers and patrons&#151;who numbered the artist William Hogarth, the engraver Hubert Fran&ccedil;ois Gravelot, and the architect James Gibbs&#151;no further series were issued. However, during the production of the second series, West and Toms collaborated on a series of plates to illustrate William Maitland's monumental <span class="italic">History of London</span>.<br>
<br>In 1741 the engraver and print-seller John Boydell was bound apprentice to Toms, having famously been inspired by one of his cuts. In 1739, then in a state of despair and considering emigrating, Boydell had discovered a print of Hawarden Castle engraved by Toms: &#145;I admired it to a great degree &hellip; I thought I should like to Follow the art of Engraving [and] &hellip; wrote to Mr. Toms who offered to take me on trial&#146;  (Boydell, 82&#150;3). Boydell spent the next six years in Toms's studio, working alongside Louis-Philippe Boitard and Jean-Baptiste Chatelain. He found his master &#145;very civil&#146;, though &#145;subject to be in Liquor, and very Outrageous and at such times striking his Servants and beating the wainscott with his fist&#146;; he was also &#145;a very passionate man&#146; and one who &#145;committed many extravagances while his phrenzy lasted&#146;  (ibid., 85). In 1746 Boydell paid Toms &pound;30 to release him from his final year's service, and after Toms's death Boydell purchased some of the engraver's plates.<br>
<br>In addition to engraving plates for the book trade, Toms produced a substantial body of single-sheet prints. His portraits include those of the celebrated strongman Thomas Topham, &#145;lifting 1836 lbs&#146; (1741), from a drawing by C. Leigh, and of the clergyman Henry Barker by George White, after a mezzotint by Thomas Gibson. However, the largest part of Toms's single-sheet output comprised maps and views, often produced with other draughtsmen. Among some fine perspectives are a series of London views, five of Hampstead Heath and three of Highgate, produced in 1745 with Chatelain, and a skilled engraving from 1753 of the newly constructed <span class="italic">London Hospital, Whitechapel</span>, again with Chatelain, after the painting by William Bellers. Toms developed a particular expertise in engraving maps and plans, many clearly intended for naval instruction and aimed at naval buyers&#151;perhaps influenced by, or marketed with the help of, his brother. His output in this field was prolific and his naval connections allowed him to respond rapidly to contemporary events. Following the fall of Cartagena, Toms and Samuel Harding were commissioned to engrave a drawing of the attack provided by Captain William Laws at a meeting at Will's Coffee House on 2 May 1741. Remarkably, the resulting plan was on sale only a week later, a feat achieved by recutting an existing plan of the harbour, executed by Toms in 1740. Also of note are his <i>ex libris</i>, including that of Sir Rowland Winn, fourth baronet, which he engraved in 1743 from a design by the architect James Paine, the only bookplate designed by the architect.<br>
<br>Toms's output declined in the 1750s, but both book work and single-sheet commissions continued, albeit more sporadically. In 1754 he engraved the River Humber after G. Woodhouse, the plate dedicated to The Worshipful Corporation of Trinity House in Kingston upon Hull, and the following year he placed an advertisement in the <span class="italic">London Evening-Post</span> offering <span class="italic">A New and Accurate Map of &hellip; Jersey</span> (24&#150;6 June 1755). A subscription call in the <span class="italic">Gazetteer and London Daily Advertiser</span> (28 April 1756) is the only surviving evidence for Toms's <span class="italic">An Exact Representation of that Beautiful and Capital Ship called, Henry Grace de Dieu</span>, while an advertisement for another lost print, a <span class="italic">Third Rate Man of War</span>, appeared later in the same year  (<span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span>, 21 October 1756). Toms's spectacular trade card for the undertaker John Deschamps, after No&euml;l-Nicolas Coypel, engraved no later than 1757, is also noteworthy, though this may have been completed several years earlier. The last known engravings by Toms for books appear in the second edition (1756) of John Armstrong's <span class="italic">The History of the Island of Minorca</span>.<br>
<br>Whatever the cause of Toms's declining output, matters reached a head in March 1761, when he was imprisoned at the king's bench for debt. However, in March 1763 it was reported that &#145;By the death of the late Admiral Toms of Masham Street, Westminster, a genteel fortune devolves to his brother Mr William Henry Toms, formerly an eminent engraver in Union-court, Holborn&#146;  (Walpole, 225). With the inheritance also came his brother's house in Masham Street, to which Toms now moved. He may have produced occasional prints after this&#151;the frontispiece to the catalogue of the Society of Artists exhibition (1766) is said to have been signed by him, despite appearing after his death. Toms died at Masham Street, Westminster, on 12 September 1765, when he was remembered as &#145;an Eminent Engraver in various branches of that Art&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lloyd's Evening Post</span>, 11&#150;13 September 1765). Toms's output as an engraver was mixed. At his best he certainly displayed Vertue's &#145;great skill and merrit&#146;, at his worst precious little of either. While his naval and cartographic work was abundant and significant, his most skilled prints were the views and perspectives of London. His contributions to books such as Francis Drake's <span class="italic">Eboracum</span>, William Stukeley's <span class="italic">Stonehenge</span>, and Thomas Badeslade's <span class="italic">Chorographia</span>&#151;the first genuine pocket-sized atlas of the eighteenth century&#151;have been regularly plundered and ensure that his work continues to circulate widely in the twenty-first century.<br>
