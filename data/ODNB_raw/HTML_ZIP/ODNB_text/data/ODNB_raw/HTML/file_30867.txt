<span class="headword">Bryant, Sir  Arthur Wynne Morgan</span>  (1899&#150;1985), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 18 February 1899 at Dersingham on the royal Sandringham estate in Norfolk, the elder son of Francis Morgan Bryant (1859&#150;1938), chief clerk to the prince of Wales, and his wife, May, elder daughter of H. W. Edmunds of Edgbaston. Two years later, on the accession of Edward VII, Bryant's father joined the royal secretariat, becoming registrar of the Royal Victorian Order in 1916, and being knighted in 1920. Bryant's childhood was spent in a house in Lower Grosvenor Place, London, close to the Royal Mews. He attended two fashionable day schools in London before going to Pelham House, Sandgate, followed by Harrow School. In 1916 he gained a history exhibition to Pembroke College, Cambridge, but instead joined the Royal Flying Corps in 1917, becoming a pilot officer. In January 1919 he returned to England, and entered the Queen's College, Oxford, where in 1920 he gained a distinction in the former servicemen's shortened modern history honours course.<br>
<br>Bryant started his career as a teacher in a London council school in Holloway. He was called to the bar by the Inner Temple but in 1923 was appointed principal of the Cambridge School of Arts, Crafts, and Technology. On 16 July 1924 he married Sylvia Mary Shakerley (1900/01&#150;1950), daughter of Sir Walter Geoffrey Shakerley, third baronet, of Somerford Park, Cheshire. Within a year, on his appointment as lecturer in history for the University of Oxford department of extra mural studies, they moved from Cambridge to White House, East Claydon, north Buckinghamshire, where he was to live for the next twenty years.<br>
<br>In 1929 Bryant became educational adviser to the Bonar Law College at Ashridge, Hertfordshire, and produced his first book, <span class="italic">The Spirit of Conservatism</span>, imbued with nostalgic Baldwinite traditionalism. Soon he was editing the <span class="italic">Ashridge Journal</span>. His nostalgia for an ideal English past had been further expressed in the successful historical pageants he had organized in the vicinity of Cambridge, and then Oxford, which were to lead to his role as co-ordinator of the Greenwich pageants in London in the 1930s.<br>
<br>Bryant's first book of history was <span class="italic">King Charles II</span> (1931), a biography favourable to that monarch as a protector of traditional English interests, which was dramatic in its impact, and also readable; so much so, that it became a best-seller, and the Book Society's monthly choice. A modern reader of it will note the detailed research involved, but also at times the rather sentimental, mannered tone, which was to be a constant in his output. Both aspects were to the fore in his highly successful life of Samuel Pepys, in three volumes (1933, 1935, and 1938), the making of his reputation as a historian.<br>
<br>Bryant was asked, in 1936, to succeed G. K. Chesterton as writer of &#145;Our note book&#146; in the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> (which he was to write regularly for the rest of his life). In the same year he left his post with the University of Oxford department of extra mural studies, and was from now on to be a freelance writer. In 1937 he became general editor of the National Book Association, a tory counterblast to the Left Book Club.<br>
<br>Bryant's politics, like those of many people on the right, were affected from 1933 onwards by a na&iuml;ve pro-Nazism. In 1934 he had published a collection of essays entitled <span class="italic">The Man and the Hour: Studies of Six Great Men of our Time</span>, in which his &#145;Summary&#146; described Hitler as a &#145;mystic&#146; who had enabled Germany to &#145;find her soul&#146;  (pp. 143&#150;4). In the late thirties he was still publicly railing against the calumnies with regard to Germany that he believed &#145;warmongers&#146; to be spreading.<br>
<br>All this would seem comparatively innocuous, and typical of the attitudes of many at the time; but, even after war broke out, when so many others had recanted, Bryant continued in the same vein, publishing in January 1940 a book (based in part on earlier work), entitled <span class="italic">Unfinished Victory</span>; this, while purporting to be an explanation of Germany's attitudes, attempted among other things to justify Germany's actions against the Jews: &#145;The native Germans &hellip; were confronted with a problem&#151;that of rescuing their indigenous culture from an alien hand and restoring it to their own race&#146;  (p. 141). The book ended with a triumphant evocation of the victory of the German revolution. Bryant, in his continual use and reuse of everything he had written, had failed to notice that times had changed. The public reactions to his book soon showed him that they had.<br>
<br>Bryant swiftly embarked, in responsive reaction, upon his well-known career as a writer of patriotic history, starting with <span class="italic">English Saga</span> (1940), and continuing with <span class="italic">The Years of Endurance, 1793&#150;1802</span> (1942), and <span class="italic">The Years of Victory, 1802&#150;1812</span> (1944). Clear parallels were drawn between Napoleon and Hitler, and England's heroic role in the Napoleonic wars was given a contemporary gloss. These books lacked the detailed research that had marked his writing of the thirties, but were strongly popular in their appeal. They were widely read, and did much to raise public morale.<br>
<br>In 1939 Bryant's first marriage had been dissolved, and on 29 January 1941 he married Anne Elaine Primula, daughter of Bertram Willes Dayrell Brooke, a retired captain in the Royal Artillery and heir to the last raja of Sarawak (they were to be divorced in 1976). There were no children of either marriage.<br>
<br>Bryant had always been a very prolific writer. In the post-war period his output was prodigious, with, apart from his journalism, more than twenty books, and many shorter works. Many of these were in the nature of pot-boilers, but his two-volume edition of the diaries of Lord Alanbrooke, <span class="italic">The Turn of the Tide</span> (1957) and <span class="italic">Triumph in the West</span> (1959), showed that he was still capable of research. The volumes caused something of a furore, because of the criticisms of Churchill contained in them and because they exposed the extent of Anglo-American rivalry over the European campaign in 1944&#150;5. Much of his other output could be best described as &#145;generalist&#146; history. He had, however, become something of a national institution, and as Britain's leading writer of patriotic history was showered with honours, becoming CBE (1949), a knight (1954), and CH (1967). His one venture into politics, in this period, was his opposition to Britain's entry to the European Common Market.<br>
<br>Bryant died at New Hall Hospital, Bodenham, Salisbury, Wiltshire, on 22 January 1985. The reputation he left as a historian is a mixed one. Academics have tended to disdain his particular form of popular history. There is a good story about the reactions of A. J. P. Taylor when Bryant was introduced to him as &#145;our greatest living historian&#146;; yet, to many people, he was just that. His writings have performed a very important function, because by making history a &#145;good read&#146; he encouraged countless people, who would not otherwise have thought of doing so, to take a real interest in the events of the past.<br>
