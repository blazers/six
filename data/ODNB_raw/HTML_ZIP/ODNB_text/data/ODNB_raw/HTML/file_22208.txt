<span class="headword">Pickering, Sir  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1398/9), <span class="occ">speaker of the House of Commons and administrator</span>, was probably the son of Thomas Pickering of Killington, near Kendal, Westmorland. Probably of age by 1354, he was knighted by 1361. He later claimed to have served Edward III in Scotland&#151;perhaps in military operations before the 1357 truce, even in the king's own campaign of 1355&#150;6. Pickering's interests in Yorkshire, around Ellerton, in Swaledale, and Selby, developed later&#151;although his surname might suggest otherwise; he first became a West Riding justice of the peace and commissioner of array in 1376&#150;7; these connections may have stemmed from his marriage, though the identity of his wife is unknown.<br>
<br>Pickering was twice elected to parliament for Westmorland (1362, 1365) and then for Cumberland (1368). He served as deputy (1365&#150;6, 1368, 1371&#150;5) to Roger, ninth Lord Clifford (<i>d</i>. 1389), hereditary sheriff of Westmorland. At the same time he became involved in Irish affairs, through his Westmorland neighbour, Sir William Windsor (<i>d</i>. 1383). In 1369, if not earlier, Pickering joined Windsor when he became lieutenant of Ireland in that year, serving as chief justice, though his legal experience is obscure. Participating in creative expedients to fund Windsor's administration, Pickering was named in several of the eighty-seven charges directed against the lieutenant and his agents, attracting accusations of peculation, extortion, and barratry. He left Ireland before the lieutenant, at an uncertain point in 1370&#150;71, and did not return when Windsor was reappointed. Possibly because of the Irish allegations, he spent some time in London (obtaining a royal pardon in 1377), but he also attended to more local affairs, not that these were devoid of controversy either. In 1378 he procured a royal commission to investigate ambushes laid for him by Sir Thomas Roos of Kendal; he was himself accused of bribing a jury. Though not formally retained by John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster (<i>d</i>. 1399), he was associated with those who were, and received money for the duke when the latter had to retire to Scotland in 1381. At some point Pickering joined the duchy of Lancaster's northern council.<br>
<br>Again representing Westmorland in parliament (October 1377, 1378, 1379, October 1382), Pickering progressed to the office of speaker (1378; conceivably 1379, but the incumbent is unknown). In that capacity he made the first known speaker's &#145;protestation&#146;, disclaiming personal responsibility for any offensive statements. He was caught between Gaunt and a resentful Commons, and this caution was understandable; it is unclear whether his appointment owed anything to Gaunt's efforts to neutralize parliament after its behaviour in 1376. Whatever may have been hoped, in 1378 the Commons produced attacks on the government, but no taxation. Pickering subsequently became member for Yorkshire (February 1383, November 1384, September 1388, November 1390, September 1397) instead of Westmorland; he was again speaker in the first of these parliaments. The fact that this session called for Gaunt to concern himself with Scotland and the north, rather than with his Spanish ambitions, suggests that Pickering had no direct links of patronage with the duke.<br>
<br>Pickering, an executor of his friend Windsor, was embroiled from 1384 in the latter's tangled affairs (which were brought up in the parliament of November 1384). He also became sheriff of Yorkshire (1389, 1393, 1397&#150;8); Richard II in 1390 granted him an annuity of 40 marks (but not for life), perhaps to compensate for the expenses involved. It was against the background of Richard's purge of his adversaries in 1397 that Pickering was elected to his twelfth and last parliament, that he was then given his last double term as sheriff, and that he returned to the West Riding bench (from which other commitments had presumably forced him). He died in late 1398 or early 1399, apparently during the 1398&#150;9 shrieval term, before he would have had to choose between his royal and Lancastrian connections. He left at least two sons; one of these, Thomas, died in 1406 as escheator of Yorkshire.<br>
