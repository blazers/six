<span class="headword">Ker,  Patrick</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1684&#150;1691), <span class="occ">writer</span>, is generally supposed to have been Scottish, or at least to have had connections with Scotland, though the only evidence of this can be derived from internal witness in his poetry (such as &#145;An Elegy on Mr John Forbes, Late Sheriff of Aberdeen&#146;) and the speculative testimony of a contributor, J. O., to <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> in the late nineteenth century. The latter conjectures that Ker may have been compelled to leave Scotland for the greater tolerance of episcopalianism in England during a period of intense presbyterian conflict.<br>
<br>Ker's cultural production is centred in London, and the period in which his works appeared in print, 1684&#150;91, spans the later reign of Charles II and the ascendancy of James VII and II to the throne. Attribution of his work has been ambiguous, largely owing to the mere inscription of initials in some of his printed works. There is, however, a marked degree of internal textual correspondence and thematic echoes between the ascribed works, and, in one instance, a near identical ornamental illustration of the Trinity facing the frontispiece of two works, <span class="italic">Flosculum poeticum</span> and <span class="italic">The Map of Man's Misery</span>.<br>
<br>The most powerful poetic expression of Ker's royalism is found in the collection <span class="italic">Flosculum poeticum: Poems Divine and Humane, Panegyrical, Satyrical, Ironical</span> (1684). The volume opens with a politically impassioned series of verses on the execution of Charles I, &#145;Great king and constant martyr&#146;, an illustration of Charles in the oak subscribed &#145;O cruel English nation!&#146;  (p. 3), and frequent invocations of &#145;Loyal hearts&#146;. There are briefer anti-Cromwellian pieces; poetry that celebrates the restoration of Charles II; occasional and dedicatory verse possibly addressed to Ker's London coterie, and a dramatic prologue; religious verse that is frequently subsumed by royalist defence; and a body of amatory and erotic poetry in conventional seventeenth-century anti-platonic, sensualist vein.<br>
<br>Ker's political poetry in two single-sheet broadsides is found in the Luttrell Ballad collection, <span class="italic">An elegy on the deplorable and never enough to be lamented death of the illustrious and serene Charles II</span> (1685), and <span class="italic">A Mournful Elegy on the Deplorable Death of Charles II</span> (1685). These elegies proclaim the political renewal augured by the coronation of James VII and II. Ker is also the probable author of the Latin panegyric <span class="italic">In illustrissimum, ac serenissimum, Jacobum II</span> (1685).<br>
<br>Ker's other major printed work includes a religious almanac, <span class="italic">The Map of Man's Misery</span> (1690), containing &#145;spiritual Meditations&#146;, and dedicated to Lady Rachel Russell on 24 January 1689; <span class="italic"><i>Logomachia</i>, or, The Conquest of Eloquence</span> (1690), two rhetorical disputations on classical models; and <span class="italic"><i>Politikos megas</i>: the Grand Politician</span> (1691), dedicated to the earl of Nottingham on 27 August 1690, a supposed &#145;translation&#146; of a treatise by (the pseudonymous) Conradus Reinking. Reminiscent of Machiavelli's <span class="italic">Il principe</span>, it prescribes the most expedient political conduct, reveals &#145;the Secret Art of State-Policy&#146;, describes various duplicitous strategies&#151;&#145;How to speak one's mind freely without any danger&#146;&#151;and even offers military advice to the &#145;Nobles, Statesmen, Judges, Lawyers, Justices of Peace&#146; to whom the work is addressed.<br>
<br>Ker, a moderately prolific polemicist and political writer, sustained, within the cultural context of late seventeenth-century London, traditions of episcopalian and royalist writing which had particular currency in Scotland. His association with Scotland, however, can only be inferred.<br>
