<span class="headword">Uniacke, Sir  Herbert Crofton Campbell</span>  (1866&#150;1934), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 4 December 1866, the eldest son of Crofton James Uniacke (1841&#150;1928), a member of an Irish landowning family settled in Halifax, Nova Scotia, who attained the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the army service corps, and his wife, Frances Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1919), whose father John Campbell was lieutenant-colonel of the 60th rifles. After attending the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, he was commissioned in the Royal Artillery in 1885 and promoted captain in 1896. On 21 March 1899 he married Minnie Mary (1867&#150;1947), daughter of Thomas Wild, with whom he had two sons. Further promotions followed, to major in 1901 and lieutenant-colonel in 1913. His early career was marked by a lack of campaign experience, and an enthusiasm for shooting, riding, and polo. <br>
<br>In October 1913 Uniacke was appointed chief instructor of the school of gunnery, training Royal Horse Artillery and Royal Field Artillery officers. He seems to have spent August to November 1914 training territorial force and new army officers before proceeding to France in November 1914 with the 8th division as commander of the 5th brigade of the Royal Horse Artillery. Both formations were gatherings of scattered imperial garrisons. In February 1915, after a few months holding the line with minimal action, he was promoted brigadier-general to command 2nd heavy artillery reserve group. The heavy artillery had two missions, bombarding trenches and counter-battery fire at German guns. Bombardments were largely determined by the infantry, who would be in harm's way, and thus by division, corps, or even army commanders. Counter-battery fire was mainly left to artillerymen, for whom Uniacke developed new techniques. He produced a map showing what grid squares his batteries could hit; he put an aeroplane up to watch for German activity; he developed &#145;zone calls&#146; that let the aeroplane signal simply what sector and what activity, speeding up communications and thus the response time. He also took part in training, chivvying the territorial force and new army units to a higher standard. <br>
<br>Uniacke mainly spent 1915 in quiet sectors, although he took part in the battle of Neuve Chapelle. In mid-November 1915 he was promoted to command the artillery of the 5th corps, and in March 1916 he changed to the 3rd corps on the Somme sector, as part of a policy to move better officers to the Somme. He oversaw the bombardment, counter-battery work, and barrage planning for the 3rd corps. In such a large operation his autonomy was sharply limited; he could do little more than co-ordinate his subordinates and make sure that they would fit into army-wide plans.<br>
<br>At the end of July 1916 Uniacke was promoted to major-general, Royal Artillery of Reserve (later Fifth) Army. At first he was closely watched by Sir Hubert Gough (commander) and Neill Malcolm (chief of staff). As Uniacke proved himself, they gave him more leeway. For the first month the Reserve Army was largely supporting the Fourth Army's continuing attacks with counter-battery fire. Uniacke also demanded daily reports, not from a love of paperwork but to guide his subordinates, to systematize and focus their thinking (in 1917, once he was satisfied with his subordinates, the requirement ended). Once Haig shifted the attacks to Reserve Army's sector, Uniacke had more work co-ordinating bombardments and infantry support. He accepted the Royal Artillery ethos that artillery was a supporting arm, not a combat arm, and that in a combined-arms war the artillery could not expect to dominate it. He spent much time spreading &#145;best practices&#146; about tactics and techniques, relaying both successes and failures. For the winter of 1916&#150;17 he developed and oversaw a 2,000,000-shell programme of harassing fire and local attacks. <br>
<br>In March 1917 Uniacke was temporarily assigned to the Third Army. The commander, Sir Edmund Allenby, and his artillery commander, Major-General Arthur Holland, had devised an innovative and risky plan to sacrifice thorough artillery preparations to achieve surprise. The plan was regarded by some in the high command as questionable, and Haig transferred Holland as a warning to Allenby. Uniacke was brought in as a safe pair of hands and rapidly had an effective traditional plan. Gough rushed both planning and execution of Fifth Army's part of the offensive, resulting in heavy losses to gain the ruins of Bullecourt. <br>
<br>The Fifth Army's next battle was at Ypres. Gough's plans were optimistic; he cited first-day success in most attacks by the British expeditionary force as a reason to plunge ahead rather than tackling smaller chunks. Uniacke first had to fight a counter-battery struggle (which would only drive the Germans back, not destroy them), bombard the German positions (including pillboxes built during the British preparations), and organize the barrage. The Fifth Army did gain ground on 31 July, but pushed too far and German counter-attacks regained any key ground lost. The next weeks were spent in a series of over-hasty attacks that did little good; improving British tactics could not overcome German geographical advantages. In September Haig switched his emphasis to the Second Army and Uniacke was again left to organize supporting fire. <br>
<br>For the winter of 1917&#150;18 the British expeditionary force assumed a defensive posture and emphasized training. Uniacke threw himself into this, switching the emphasis from technical gunnery to tactics, including practice in mobile warfare. He also wrote a 103 page report on the lessons of 1917, concluding &#145;the final decisive factor is the bayonet of the Infantry soldier&#146;, which drove home his belief that artillery was vitally important but still a supporting arm in combined-arms warfare. In early 1918 the Fifth Army was moved to the Somme sector, but lacked the labour to build new defence-in-depth positions. On 21 March 1918 almost 10,000 German guns and mortars blasted the British positions; spearheaded by storm troopers, the German infantry nearly broke the allied line. The Fifth Army's only option was a fighting retreat, where the training in mobile warfare was useful, but after two weeks Haig lost confidence in Gough and Fifth Army headquarters, replacing them with Sir Henry Rawlinson and the Fourth Army. Uniacke thought Gough had been badly treated and vowed &#145;to stick by Goughie&#146;. Uniacke spent much of his time at the Fifth Army artillery school until, in a &#145;d&#151;d impertinence&#146;, Fourth Army seized it  (diary, Uniacke papers). <br>
<br>On 9 July 1918 Uniacke, who had been mentioned in dispatches ten times during his service on the western front, was made deputy inspector-general for training under Sir Ivor Maxse. He continued to emphasize combined-arms work and advocated a central artillery school, which in 1920 led to the creation of the Royal School of Artillery, Larkhill. He was recognized by his contemporaries for his tactical and technical expertise and strength of character, giving his honest opinion to superiors. Liddell Hart regarded his contribution as central to the evolution of artillery tactics on the western front. <br>
<br>In 1919 Uniacke became commander of the lines of communication during the demobilization and was knighted (KCMG; KCB 1926). In 1920 he took command of 1st Indian division and Rawalpindi district for four years. He then held various largely ceremonial positions (including colonel commandant, Royal Artillery, and lieutenant of the Tower of London) until retirement in 1932. He oversaw the erection of the Royal Artillery memorial at Hyde Park Corner, edited the Royal Artillery war commemoration book to tell the human side of the war, and was active in the Old Contemptibles Association. He died in his sleep at his home, Rivermead, Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on 14 May 1934. His funeral took place at Marlow parish church. His two sons were both commissioned in the Royal Artillery and served in the Second World War.<br>
