<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wheatstone, Sir  Charles</span>  (1802&#150;1875), <span class="occ">developer of telegraphy</span>, was born on 6 February 1802 at the Manor House, Barnwood, Gloucester, the second of four children of William Wheatstone (1775&#150;1854), shoemaker, and his wife, Beatta. In 1806 the family moved to London, where Wheatstone went to school. At the age of fourteen he was apprenticed to an uncle, also Charles Wheatstone, who had a musical instrument manufacturing business in the Strand. Young Wheatstone did not take to business life, but he was fascinated by the physics of sound, and studied the working of musical instruments. In particular, he wanted to know what distinguished sounds of the same pitch but different timbre, and how sounds were transmitted through solid rods and stretched wires.<br>
<br>On his uncle's death in 1823, Wheatstone, together with his younger brother William, took over the business. In the same year he contributed a paper to Thomson's <span class="italic">Annals of Philosophy</span>, describing his early experiments with sound. Other papers followed, including a description of his &#145;kaleidophone&#146;. This instrument consisted of steel wire of rectangular cross-section fixed to a heavy base and carrying a silver bead at the top. The times of vibration of the bead in two directions at right angles being regulated by the particular rectangular section of the wire, the bead could be made to describe very beautiful curves illustrating the combination of harmonic motions of different periods. In 1825 he constructed a mouth organ with free reeds governed by a small button keyboard; further experiments led to the bellows-blown concertina (patent 10,041 of 1844), an improvement on the German instrument, which was allied to the accordion. One of the few original British musical instrument designs, it is still being played at the present time. His principal contribution to acoustics, a memoir on the so-called Chladni's figures, produced by strewing sand on an elastic plane and throwing it into vibration by means of a violin bow, was presented to the Royal Society and published in their <span class="italic">Transactions</span> (1833). Wheatstone showed that in square and rectangular plates every figure, however complicated, was the resultant of two or more sets of isochronous parallel vibrations; and by means of simple geometrical relations he carried out the principle of the &#145;superposition of small motions&#146; without the aid of any profound mathematical analysis, and succeeded in predicting the curves that given modes of vibration should produce.<br>
<br>Wheatstone made several important contributions to optics. The stereoscope, which, by presenting slightly different pictures to each eye, gives the viewer an apparently solid image, is entirely due to Wheatstone. In 1835 he read a paper on the &#145;Prismatic analysis of electric light&#146; before the British Association meeting at Dublin. He demonstrated that the spectrum of the electric spark from different metals included rays of definite refrangibility, producing a series of lines differing in position and colour from each other. Thus the presence of a minute portion of any given metal might be determined. &#145;We have here&#146;, he said, &#145;a mode of discriminating metallic bodies more readily than by chemical examination, and which may hereafter be employed for useful purposes.&#146; This remark is typical of his far-sightedness into the practical utility of any known scientific fact. His &#145;polar clock&#146; was another instance of this trait. When David Brewster discovered that light from the sky is always polarized in a plane 90&deg; from the sun, Wheatstone devised a clock by which it was possible to tell the hour of the day by the light from the sky even though the sun might be invisible.<br>
<br>This skill in turning knowledge to practical account was used to its full in Wheatstone's telegraph inventions. Although his inventions in other branches of science are as numerous as they are various, the name of Wheatstone has been most closely connected with the electric telegraph. He was not the &#145;inventor&#146; of this; indeed, no one can lay claim to such a title. But to Wheatstone, with his collaborator William Fothergill Cooke, is due the credit for having been the first to render it available for the public transmission of messages. In 1834, at about the time he was appointed professor of experimental philosophy at King's College, London, Wheatstone began experimenting on the rate of transmission of electricity along wires, using about half a mile of copper wire. He then obtained permission from the college to suspend 4 miles of wire in the vaults under the buildings. Three interruptions of this circuit were made by three pairs of brass knobs with a small interval between them. One of these interruptions was in the middle of the conductor, and the other two were near the ends. A Leyden electrical storage jar was discharged through the wire, and the interval of time between the occurrence of the sparks at the ends and the occurrence of the spark at the middle was observed by noting the displacement of the image of the middle spark in a mirror revolving at a known speed. This experiment yielded a transmission velocity of about 250,000 miles per second&#151;rather more than the true speed of 186,000 miles per second.<br>
<br>From this research Wheatstone passed on to the transmission of messages by electricity, and, in conjunction with Cooke, he devised the five-needle telegraph, and then the two-needle telegraph, the first that came into general use. Wheatstone's fertility of scientific resource led to many new developments, including the letter-showing dial telegraph in 1840, and the type-printing telegraph in 1841. The automatic transmitting and receiving instruments by which messages were sent with great rapidity over the telegraph system in the last third of the nineteenth century were designed by Wheatstone alone, after the partnership with Cooke had been dissolved. Wheatstone was the first to appreciate the importance of reducing to a minimum the amount of work to be done by the current at the receiving station, by diminishing as far as practicable the mass, and therefore the inertia, of the moving parts; this was beautifully exemplified in that marvel of ingenuity, the &#145;ABC&#146; letter-showing telegraph, which was much used for private telegraphic communication.<br>
<br>From 1837 Wheatstone devoted a good deal of time to submarine telegraphy, and in 1844 experiments were made in Swansea Bay, with the assistance of J. D. Llewellyn. Wheatstone also had a share in the development of the electric generator. In 1837 he devised a method of combining several armatures on one shaft so as to generate a continuous current, and in 1867 he described to the Royal Society a method of making such machines self-exciting. He used a shunt circuit; the use of a series circuit for the same purpose by Werner Siemens was described at the same meeting. Wheatstone was also inventor of a system of electro-magnetic clocks for indicating time at any number of different places united on a circuit.<br>
<br>Wheatstone had an extraordinary facility in deciphering hieroglyphics and cipher dispatches, and himself invented a cryptograph, or secret dispatch writer, which was used by the British army. His miscellaneous inventions are too numerous to mention in detail but they include electric chronographs, apparatus for making instruments record automatically, and instruments for measuring electricity and electrical resistance, including the rheostat. It was he who called attention to Christy's combination of wires, commonly known as &#145;Wheatstone's bridge&#146;, in which an electric balancing of the currents is obtained, and he worked out its application to electrical measurement. He was one of the first in Britain to appreciate the importance of Ohm's simple law of the relation between electromotive force, resistance of conductors, and resulting current&#151;the law which is the foundation of all electrical engineering. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1836.<br>
<br>Wheatstone married, on 12 February 1847, Emma (<i>d</i>. 21 Jan 1865), daughter of J. West, and they had a family of two sons and three daughters. He was made a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1855, and a foreign associate of the Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences in 1873. On 2 July 1862 he was created DCL by the University of Oxford, and in 1864 LLD by the University of Cambridge. Moreover he possessed some thirty-four distinctions or diplomas conferred upon him by various governments, universities, and learned societies. On 30 January 1868 he was knighted.<br>
<br>Wheatstone bequeathed his collection of books and instruments to King's College, London. Although nominally professor of experimental philosophy there, he seldom lectured after 1840, and indeed was an indifferent teacher because of an almost morbid timidity in the presence of an audience. On a one-to-one basis, however, he was an excellent tutor, and there are testimonies to his eloquence in such circumstances. He died of bronchitis in the H&ocirc;tel du Louvre, Paris, on 19 October 1875, and was buried on 27 October in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
