<span class="headword">Fitzherbert,  Thomas</span>  (1552&#150;1640), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born on 4 September 1552, the oldest son and heir of William Fitzherbert (<i>d</i>. 1558/9) of Swinnerton, Staffordshire, and Elizabeth or Isabella (<i>d</i>. 1616), second daughter and coheir of Humphrey Swynnerton. His grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9602/', "Sir Anthony Fitzherbert")</script>, the noted jurist, while the recusant author Nicholas Fitzherbert was his cousin. He went in 1568 to Oxford University, where he made the acquaintance of Edmund Campion. But his Catholic faith got him into trouble and in 1572 he was gaoled for recusancy. When Campion went to England with Robert Parsons in 1580 Fitzherbert joined the association of young gentlemen around George Gilbert to aid the two Jesuits. He was given the task of verifying the patristical citations in Campion's <span class="italic">Decem rationes</span>. In 1580 he married Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1588), the only daughter of Edward East of Bledlow, Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>In 1582 Fitzherbert and his wife migrated to France, where he defended the interests of Mary, queen of Scots. He also served Catherine de' Medici, and was a firm member of the Allen party among the English Catholic exiles. In 1589, after the death of his wife and the defeat of the Spanish Armada, he moved to Spain. There, with the help of the duke of Feria, he received a pension from Philip II. In 1596, after the death of Sir Francis Englefield, he succeeded him in the post of Philip's English secretary.<br>
<br>During these years Fitzherbert's name was often mentioned in reports from English agents abroad. When on a visit to Brussels in 1595, he was charged before the state of Flanders with holding a correspondence with the English secretary of state, and with a design to set fire to the magazine at Mechelen, but was extricated by the duke of Feria. In 1598 he was accused of being one of the conspirators in the bizarre Squire plot, in which a deadly substance was to be spread on the saddle which Queen Elizabeth was to use in a ceremonial parade, in order to poison her.<br>
<br>Fitzherbert defended himself vigorously in his first published book, <span class="italic">An Apology of T. F.</span>, dated Madrid 31 August 1599. It was printed along with <span class="italic">A Defence of the Catholic Cause</span> (1602), in which he wrote proudly of how he had been proven trustworthy by kings and nobles during the fifteen or sixteen years he had lived as a courtier.<br>
<br>In 1601 Fitzherbert made a vow to become a priest. He moved to Rome where he was ordained on 24 March 1602. After that he devoted himself to writing. He had thought long and hard about the relationship between politics and religion. In 1606 he published the first part of his <span class="italic">A Treatise Concerning Policy and Religion</span>. It dealt with the chief questions raised by Nicolo Machiavelli in <span class="italic">The Prince</span>. The second part followed in 1610, the same year in which he published a shorter treatment of the same theme, <span class="italic">An sit utilitas in scelere, vel, De infelicitate principis Machiavelliani</span>. The two volumes of the English treatise were reprinted at least four times in the course of the seventeenth century. Some have seen a new accent in this work. Whereas there was a note of optimism and enthusiasm in the Roman Catholic cause after 1580, <span class="italic">Policy and Religion</span> concentrated on the &#145;natural imbecility of man's wit&#146; and the despair that is inevitable for those who put their trust in princes.<br>
<br>For a good while Fitzherbert was the agent in Rome of the vicar apostolic, the leader of the secular clergy of England. He discussed the instructions he received and the suggestions he made with Robert Persons, prefect of the Jesuit mission. This was deeply resented by one party among the secular clergy, since they felt that Persons was against establishing the hierarchy in England. He resigned his position as agent at Rome for the English clergy, and entered the Society of Jesus in 1615. After his noviciate was completed he was sent to Brussels to be the agent of the English Jesuits there. In 1618 he took his solemn vows in Louvain. The next year he was named rector of the English College in Rome, a post which he held until 1639. He died in the college on 7 August 1640 and was buried in the chapel.<br>
