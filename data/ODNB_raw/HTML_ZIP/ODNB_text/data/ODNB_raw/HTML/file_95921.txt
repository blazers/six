<span class="headword">Baldry,  John William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Long John Baldry]</span>  (1941&#150;2005), <span class="occ">singer and guitarist</span>, was born at East Haddon Hall, East Haddon, Northamptonshire, on 12 January 1941, the first of three children of William James Baldry (1915&#150;1990), a Metropolitan Police constable, and his wife, Margaret Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Parker (1915&#150;1989). At the time of the registration of his birth his parents lived at 18 Frinton Road, East Ham, London. He obtained the sobriquet Long John as a baby, being remarkably long, and by his mid-teens he was six feet seven inches tall. He was raised in Queensbury, Middlesex, attended Downer County Grammar School, Edgware, and sang in the choir at St Lawrence's Church, also in Edgware. By 1953 he was listening to American blues performers and learning twelve-string guitar. He made his first public appearance as a guitarist and blues singer in 1956 and also played with the renowned guitarist Davey Graham.<br>
<br>After leaving school Baldry worked for an advertising agency, but soon joined Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies in their group, Blues Incorporated. The fluid line-up included Jack Bruce, Ginger Baker, and Charlie Watts alongside such vocalists as Baldry, Mick Jagger, and Paul Jones. His commanding presence was heard on the album <span class="italic">R&amp;B from the Marquee</span> (1962). In 1962 Baldry toured Germany working with the vibraphonist G&uuml;nther Hampel and his quartet. He returned to find Korner and Davies at loggerheads. As Baldry later recounted, &#145;Both Alex and Cyril were anxious for me to join their bands, and I joined Cyril on the toss of a half-crown&#146;  (BBC Radio Merseyside, 13 July 2002). Exactly one year later Davies died of leukaemia. Baldry assumed leadership of his band but renamed it Long John Baldry and the Hoochie Coochie Men. The musicians ranged from nineteen to forty-eight, the youngest being Rod Stewart, whom Baldry had heard playing harmonica on Twickenham Railway Station. Rod Stewart later remarked, &#145;In those days the only music we fell in love with was the blues and John with his wonderful voice was the first white guy singing it&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 25 July 2005).<br>
<br>In 1966 Baldry, Stewart, Brian Auger, and Julie Driscoll formed Steampacket. They toured with the Rolling Stones, but there were management problems. Baldry wanted another new band but did not want the rigmarole of forming another line-up. He recalled, &#145;I was at a gambling casino opposite the V&amp;A, the Cromwellian Club. There was live music in the basement and this night it was Bluesology with Reg Dwight [later known as Elton John] playing keyboards, and I gave them the job <i>en bloc</i>&#146;  (BBC Radio Merseyside, 13 July 2002). Baldry's rich voice was appreciated by a songwriting and production team at Pye Records, Tony Macaulay and John MacLeod. They offered him a polished pop&#150;soul ballad, &#145;Let the Heartaches Begin&#146;. Macaulay remembered, &#145;Long John Baldry [sang] it extraordinarily well, thanks to three-quarters of a bottle of Courvoisier&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 25 July 2005). The record climbed to the top of the charts and Baldry performed it at the royal variety performance in 1968. It is often assumed that he hated the song, but he said in 2002 that &#145;I liked doing anything in the studio and I was very happy that Pye was employing me. I was hugely flattered to be backed by a large orchestra, and it's not a bad song&#146;  (BBC Radio Merseyside, 13 July 2002).<br>
<br>Baldry had further hits with &#145;When the Sun Comes Shinin' Thru&#146; (written by Manfred Mann's new vocalist, Mike D'Abo), &#145;It's Too Late Now&#146;, and &#145;Mexico&#146;. Of the latter Baldry said, &#145;That was done for the Olympic Games in 1968 and it was constantly on the radio. I wanted to scream every time I heard the damn thing, talk about overkill&#146;  (BBC Radio Merseyside, 13 July 2002). His albums <span class="italic">Let the Heartaches Begin</span> (1968) and <span class="italic">Wait for Me</span> (1969) included some excellent cover versions, including &#145;Stay with Me&#146; and &#145;Man Without a Dream&#146;. When Dwight told Baldry that he was leaving Bluesology to pursue a career as a singer and songwriter the band gave him a new name. They took Elton from their saxophone player, Elton Dean, and Dwight added John as a tribute to Baldry. Baldry had prevented the emotional Dwight from committing suicide, the subject of Elton John's song, &#145;Someone Saved my Life Tonight&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1971 Baldry released the album <span class="italic">It Ain't Easy</span> produced by Elton John and Rod Stewart. He promoted it in North America and liked Canada so much that he moved to Vancouver and became a Canadian citizen in 1981. A witty and friendly man, he quickly became acclimatized to the Vancouver musical scene. He had a Canadian hit with &#145;Don't Try to Lay No Boogie Woogie on the King of Rock and Roll&#146; and recorded several albums including <span class="italic">It Still Ain't Easy</span> (1991), <span class="italic">Right to Sing the Blues</span> (1996), and <span class="italic">Remembering Leadbelly</span> (2001). His main income came from lending his deep voice to commercials and cartoons including <span class="italic">Sonic the Hedgehog</span>. He died from a chest infection in Vancouver, British Columbia, on 21 July 2005. He was survived by a sister.<br>
