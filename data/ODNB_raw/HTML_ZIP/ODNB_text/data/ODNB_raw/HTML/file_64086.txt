</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">MacLeod,  Norman, of Dunvegan</span>  (1705&#150;1772), <span class="occ">politician and chief of clan MacLeod</span>, was born on 29 July 1705 in Perth, the younger son of Norman MacLeod of Dunvegan (<i>c</i>.1685&#150;1706) and Anne Fraser, daughter of Hugh, Lord Lovat, and his wife, Lady Amelia Murray. Though known in his own family as the Red Man, from the red tartan that he wears in his portrait by Allan Ramsay, at the family seat in Skye, he was better known to his tenants and indeed to posterity as An Droch Dhuine (the Bad Man). He succeeded his elder brother, John (1704&#150;1706), when only a year old, following his father's untimely death. His mother subsequently married Peter Fothringham, of Powrie, Forfarshire, in 1708 and, in 1717, the somewhat feckless John Mackenzie, second earl of Cromarty. He therefore suffered a somewhat rootless childhood, with his education seemingly &#145;much neglected&#146; under his governor, John Macrae.<br>
<br>During MacLeod's minority some &pound;90,000 Scots of longstanding debt on the vast MacLeod estate was apparently liquidated by the factor John MacLeod of Contullich and his brother Alexander, the clan lawyer. Nevertheless their traditionally-minded administration, as well as an ill-concealed Jacobitism, left them in a somewhat vulnerable position. When the chief came of age in 1724, at Cromarty's urging he initiated legal proceedings against the previous administration on grounds of dishonesty. His eventual success came at no small cost to his personal reputation.<br>
<br>About 1726 MacLeod married Janet, daughter of Sir Donald MacDonald, fourth baronet, of Sleat (Domhnall a' Chogaidh). The match was far from happy and they separated in 1733. The young chief revealed a rather dangerous penchant for meddling, finding himself caught up in the Lady Grange affair when in 1732 he assisted in the kidnap of Rachel, wife of James Erskine, Lord Grange [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58796/', "Erskine, Rachel, Lady Grange")</script>]. Seven years later he was seriously implicated in the notorious <i>Long nan Daoine</i> (Ship of the People) scheme when over a hundred of MacLeod's tenants and their children were forcibly abducted to be sold into slavery in American plantations. The ship being stormbound in Donaghadee, co. Down, some of the prisoners escaped to raise the alarm. The resulting scandal was hushed up with the help of Duncan Forbes, lord president of the court of session.<br>
<br>Forbes became something of a father figure to MacLeod, reconciling him with his wife, and, together with Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat, engineering his election as MP for Inverness-shire in 1741 as a supporter of the Argyll interest. Though not above Jacobite intriguing in his early years, after the rising of 1745 MacLeod employed brazenly duplicitous delaying tactics against Lord Lovat to keep the latter's Frasers at home during the crucial first few months. The chief's loyalty won him commissions to raise four independent companies for Loudon's regiment, and he supposedly tricked his own clansmen into marching against the Jacobite army. On 23 December 1745 they saw action at Inverurie. Though MacLeod himself showed great personal bravery, his forces were required to retreat before a superior Jacobite contingent, eventually ending up back in Skye. MacLeod's loyalties caused widespread animus against him in the aftermath of Culloden, his situation exacerbated by the government's tardy repayment of the &pound;2500 that he had spent on his companies and by the death of Forbes in December 1747.<br>
<br>MacLeod's wife had died in April 1743. In October 1748 he married Anne, daughter of William Martin of Braes, Skye. Considerably younger than her husband, she is said to have encouraged him in his growing extravagance, a lifestyle that he was increasingly unable to afford following his retirement from parliament in 1754. Indebtedness and an increasing addiction to gambling and drink meant that he had to leave London; he subsequently settled in the Whitehouse estate, near Edinburgh, then in the modest house of Park, near St Andrews. Rents on the MacLeod estate had already been raised significantly, and for many tacksmen and tenants the widespread famine of the early 1770s proved the final straw. With mass emigration looming, rents were lowered and the estate placed in the hands of trustees. Racked by sores, gout, and stomach pains Norman MacLeod of Dunvegan died at Strathtyrum House, St Andrews, on 21 February 1772. He was buried in the churchyard of St Andrews Cathedral.<br>
<br>From his first marriage to Janet MacDonald, MacLeod had three children: John, his heir, who predeceased him in 1767, Ann, and Emilia. From his second marriage to Anne Martin he had three daughters: Elizabeth, Anne, and Rich Mary. He also fathered two illegitimate sons: Alexander, &#145;whose mother is said to have been an Edinburgh lady&#146;, and Norman. He was succeeded as chief by his grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64087/', "Norman MacLeod (1754&#150;1801)")</script>. He well merits his somewhat evil reputation. Extravagant and boorish, with a taste for intrigue, his chief interest to historians is in his spanning of two eras in the history of the G&agrave;idhealtachd, being the model of a new type of landlord whose future lay not so much with his clanspeople but rather in the wider British political and financial sphere. He appears to have been the first of the MacLeod chiefs not to have spoken Gaelic, and it is notable that, rather uniquely, no praise-poem for him has come down in the oral tradition of the Isle of Skye.<br>
