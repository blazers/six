<span class="headword">Taylor,  John</span>  (1703&#150;1772), <span class="occ">itinerant oculist</span>, the elder son of John Taylor (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1709), a Norwich surgeon and apothecary, was born in Norwich on 16 August 1703. He came from a family which produced medical men for at least five generations. In 1722 he became an apothecary's assistant in London, where he also studied surgery under William Cheselden at St Thomas's Hospital and developed a special interest in eye diseases. He practised for some time in Norwich as a surgeon and oculist but encountered opposition, and in 1727 he began travelling around Britain as an itinerant eye-doctor.<br>
<br>In 1733 Taylor obtained an MD degree from Basel, where he was made a fellow of the College of Physicians; in 1734 he was granted further MD degrees from the universities of Li&egrave;ge and Cologne. In the same year he made a tour through France and the Netherlands, and visited Paris. Taylor returned to London in November 1735, and was appointed oculist to George II in the following year. For more than thirty years he continued his itinerant method of practice, with London as his headquarters. He visited in turn nearly every court in Europe, with a tour through Spain and Portugal from 1737 to 1742; an appearance in Rouen in 1743; another tour of the British Isles from 1744 to 1746; the Netherlands and Flanders in 1747; Germany and Austria in 1750; Rostock in 1751, at the invitation of the duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, followed by visits to Hamburg and Denmark; Sweden in 1752; a return visit to northern Europe and Russia in 1753 to 1754; Germany and Bohemia in 1755; a visit to Italy in 1756; Vienna and Ghent in 1757; and another tour of the British Isles in 1759 to 1760, living for a while at Gravel Street, Hatton Garden, London. Taylor went around in style, travelling with two coaches and many liveried servants, and presenting the appearance of a grand seigneur. The ostentatious narration of his wanderings in his three-volume autobiography, <span class="italic">History of the Travels and Adventures of the Chevalier John Taylor</span> (1761&#150;2), with its endless name-dropping of eminent people treated and grand ladies flirted with at masked balls, must be taken with a pinch of salt, but he was clearly a tireless traveller in pursuit of glory in his craft.<br>
<br>Taylor possessed considerable skill as an operator. His early book <span class="italic">Mechanism of the Eye</span> (1727) is an able compendium of contemporary science; his <span class="italic">Nosographia ophthalmica</span> (1746) was the first attempt at an atlas of diseases of the external eye, containing an accurate description of conical cornea and dealing in a competent fashion with lesions of the eyelids, lacrimal passages, conjunctiva, and cornea. Taylor's main claim to priority lies in his views on strabismus. He kept up with the discoveries of the day, made original contributions to the treatment of squint, and was expert at couching for cataract. Works such as <span class="italic">An Exact Account of 243 Diseases to which the Eye and its Coverings are Exposed</span> (1759) show the range of his knowledge. No less a figure than Albrecht von Haller judged him &#145;a skilful man, but too liberal of promises&#146;  (Coats, 152).<br>
<br>One of the principal medical entrepreneurs of his day, Taylor was a shameless self-advertiser, continually dropping the names of princes and savants. Styling himself &#145;Chevalier&#146; and &#145;ophthalmiator pontifical imperial and royal&#146;, he stated in his autobiography that he was &#145;the most public man under the sun, being personally known not only in every Town in Europe, but in every part of the globe&#146;  (Taylor, 2.100). His vanity and range of boasted cures knew no bounds: he claimed to have restored Bach's sight (in truth he may have been remotely responsible for the composer's death). He also treated Handel in 1758, diagnosing a paralytic disorder in the near-blind composer. Taylor finally quit England about 1767, and, after visiting Paris, he died in a convent at Prague on 6 June 1772. He is said to have become blind before his death. With his wife, Ann King, he had an only son, <a href="#cosubject_27049">John Taylor [<i>see below</i>]</a>, but little is known of his family life.<br>
<br>Taylor's methods of self-promotion were those of a charlatan, which caused him to become the subject of many satires and pasquinades, including <span class="italic">The Operator: a Ballad Opera</span> (1740) and <span class="italic">The English imposter detected, or, The life and fumigation of the renown'd Mr. J&#151;&#151; T&#151;&#151;</span> (1732). He was accustomed to make bombastic orations before performing his cures, expressing himself in what he called the true Ciceronian style; its idiosyncrasy consisted in commencing each sentence with the genitive case and concluding with the verb. He skilfully played upon the fascination with light and sight that was so strong in the age of enlightenment, and stressed before Johann Kaspar Lavater how the eye was the index of the mind&#151;hence the oculist was also a kind of psychologist. Johnson declared him &#145;an instance of how far impudence could carry ignorance&#146;  (Boswell, 1022), and doubtless his ostentatious behaviour betrays personal vanity; but it also says much about the need for self-promotion at that time in the precarious world of those pioneering the new medical specialities.<br>
<br>His son, <a name="cosubject_27049"></a><span class="headword">John Taylor</span>  (<em>c.</em>1724&#150;1787), <span class="occ">oculist</span>, was born in London and educated at the Coll&egrave;ge du Plessis in Paris. About 1739 he moved to London, and, after studying under his father, he practised independently as an oculist. On the death of the Baron de Wenzel, Taylor succeeded as oculist to George III in 1772. In 1761 <span class="italic">A Life and Extraordinary History of the Chevalier John Taylor</span> was published in his name. Exceedingly scurrilous, it represented his father as a libertine and his alleged cures as mere frauds. No serious attempt to disown the book was made at the time by the younger Taylor, but according to John Taylor, the chevalier's grandson, the biography was really the production of Henry Jones (1721&#150;1770), who, after being entrusted with the materials, had betrayed his trust. Taylor died at Hatton Garden, London, on 17 September 1787, and was buried six days later in the new burying-ground of St Andrew's. Taylor and his wife, Ann Price, had three sons, of whom the eldest, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27056/', "John Taylor (1757&#150;1832)")</script>, was afterwards oculist to George III and George IV.<br>
