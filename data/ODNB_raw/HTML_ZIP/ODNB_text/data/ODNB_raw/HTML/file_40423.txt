<span class="headword">Hill, Sir  (Austin) Bradford <span class="st"> [Tony]</span></span>  (1897&#150;1991), <span class="occ">medical statistician</span>, was born on 8 July 1897 in Hampstead, London, the third of four sons and third of six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33872/', "Sir Leonard Erskine Hill (1866&#150;1952)")</script>, professor of physiology at the London Hospital medical college, and his wife, Janet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Alexander (1868&#150;1956), daughter of Frederick Alexander, bank clerk. On his father's side he was great-great-nephew of Sir Rowland Hill. When he was five years old the family moved to Loughton, a village in Epping Forest, where he acquired a lifelong love of the countryside. He was educated at Chigwell School from 1908 to 1916 and was distinguished there more by sporting than academic ability. He nevertheless became head boy, staying on for an extra year as he was not allowed to enlist and did not want to start a long medical training during the war. On leaving school he obtained a commission in the Royal Naval Air Service and was soon posted to the Greek islands in support of the attack on the Dardanelles. While there he contracted pulmonary tuberculosis, which probably saved his life as it kept him <i>hors de combat</i>. Confined to bed, he was unable to study medicine, which he had wanted to do since boyhood, so studied economics as an external student of London University, obtaining a second-class honours degree in 1922. After a long attachment dating back to before his naval service began, on 31 July 1923 he married Florence Maud Salmon (1892&#150;1980), daughter of Edward George Salmon, editor and author. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>An opportunity to work in the medical field occurred when the Medical Research Council (MRC) sought someone to investigate the reasons for the high mortality of young adults in rural areas and Hill obtained the appointment with the support of Major Greenwood, an old friend of his father's, who was in charge of statistical work at the Ministry of Health. This provided the opportunity to extend his knowledge of statistics (initiated in the study of economics) by attending part of the London BSc course. He was inspired by the teaching of Karl Pearson at University College, though more by his general ideas and philosophy than by his erudite mathematics, and he settled for a career in epidemiology, with a special interest in occupational medicine. A series of grants from the MRC led to a staff appointment until, in 1933, he obtained a readership in epidemiology and vital statistics under Greenwood, who had become the first professor of medical statistics at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. In this position Hill made his first great contribution to medicine, publishing in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> in 1937 his lectures on statistics to postgraduate medical students. The seventeen articles were subsequently brought together in a book, <span class="italic">The Principles of Medical Statistics</span> (1937), which was translated into Spanish, Korean, Indonesian, Polish, and Russian, and was repeatedly reprinted and revised: fifty years later the text was still widely read (the eleventh edition appeared in 1985), but could be considered overly simple. It was, however, its very simplicity, combined with its clarity of expression and logical development, that made it so successful and was primarily responsible for making an innumerate profession understand the need for appropriate statistical analysis and allowance for the play of chance.<br>
<br>With the onset of the Second World War, Hill was seconded to the research and experimental department of the Ministry of Home Security and later to the medical directorate of the Royal Air Force. With the latter he maintained a relationship as an honorary civil consultant in medical statistics until 1978. (He was also civil consultant in medical statistics to the Royal Navy, from 1958 to 1977.) Greenwood retired in 1945 and Hill was appointed to his chair and to the honorary directorship of the MRC's statistical research unit. A year later he persuaded two MRC committees to adopt a new technique for testing the value of new drugs or prophylactic regimes: namely, random allocation of subjects to treatment or control groups. He did so not for theoretical statistical reasons, but for the practical reason that it guaranteed the avoidance of bias in the allocation of treatment, something that was always possible, in one way or another, with other regimes. One of the trials (of streptomycin for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis) had notably clear results; the benefits of the technique were quickly appreciated and within a few years random allocation became the essential characteristic of a reliable trial.<br>
<br>In 1947 Hill was asked by the MRC to try to find a reason for the increased mortality attributed to lung cancer, which an MRC conference (in which Hill participated) had concluded was unlikely to be wholly an artefact of improved diagnosis. He consequently planned a study of patients with lung cancer, in which their histories would be compared with those of patients with other diseases, and he obtained the assistance of Richard Doll to undertake its day-to-day conduct. The results, published in 1950, led Doll and Hill to conclude that &#145;cigarette smoking is a cause, and an important cause, of bronchogenic carcinoma&#146;  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 2, 1950, 739). This unpopular conclusion (for 80 per cent of British middle-aged men were regular smokers) was not generally accepted and Hill (with Doll) designed a different type of study to test its validity, in which 40,000 doctors were asked to describe their smoking habits and were then followed to determine their causes of death. The results soon confirmed the earlier conclusion and, with further follow-up, showed that smoking also caused many other diseases. These case-control and cohort studies, as they came to be called, broke new ground and were frequently cited as models of their type. Consideration of the evidence that had led to the conclusion that cigarette smoking was a cause of disease led Hill to review the type of evidence required to deduce causality from observational studies. His findings came to be known as &#145;Hill's guidelines&#146; and they were subsequently used widely for both scientific and legal purposes.<br>
<br>Hill was a quiet, unassuming, private person, known to everyone as Tony, who sought to lead but not to drive. In committee he expressed his opinion firmly and cogently but never sought to impose, and was in consequence listened to with respect. He lectured brilliantly, reading texts in such a way that he was thought to be speaking spontaneously, often without the use of visual aids but always with humorous asides. His many public functions included membership of the committee on the safety of medicines (1964&#150;75) and the MRC (1954&#150;8), and he served as secretary (1940&#150;50) and president (1950&#150;52) of the Royal Statistical Society and, for two years, as dean of the School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (1955&#150;7). In 1951 he was made CBE and in 1961 knighted. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1954 and received honorary degrees from Oxford and Edinburgh and many honorary fellowships and medals, including an honorary fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians of London and the gold medal of the Royal Statistical Society (1953). He retired early to devote himself to his wife, who had stayed by him when he had pulmonary tuberculosis, and he looked after her at home when she developed Alzheimer's disease, until shortly before she died in 1980. His last years were marred by frequent transient ischaemic attacks, one of which left him with a weak left leg. He died, mentally alert to the end, in Balla Wray Nursing Home, High Wray, Ambleside, Westmorland, of bronchopneumonia, on 18 April 1991. A service of thanksgiving for his life was held at St Clement Danes on 4 October 1991.<br>
