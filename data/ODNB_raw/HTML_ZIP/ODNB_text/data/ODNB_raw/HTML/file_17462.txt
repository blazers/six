<span class="headword">MacDonnell,  Randal</span>, marquess of Antrim  (1609&#150;1683), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the eldest legitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17461/', "Randal MacDonnell, first earl of Antrim (d. 1636)")</script>, and Alice (<i>b</i>. 1582/3, <i>d</i>. in or after 1663), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20775/', "Hugh O'Neill, second earl of Tyrone (c.1550&#150;1616)")</script>, magnate and rebel, and his second wife, Siobh&aacute;n (or Joanna). He had one younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17457/', "Alexander MacDonnell (1615&#150;1699)")</script>, four illegitimate brothers (James, Alistair, Daniel, and Maurice), and six sisters (Anne, Mary, Sarah, Catherine, Rose, and Ellis).<h2>
<a name="Backgroundandearlycareer"></a>Background and early career</h2>Reared at Dunluce Castle in co. Antrim and fluent in both Irish and English, MacDonnell was &#145;bred the highland way&#146; wearing &#145;neither hat, cap, nor shoe, nor stocking&#146; until he was seven or eight years old  (Hill, 252). In 1625 he left Ireland to spend eighteen months in France to complete his education and to master the language. In the spring of 1627 as Viscount Dunluce&#151;described as &#145;a tall, clean-limbed, handsome man with red hair&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.509)&#151;he returned from France and was presented at the English court, where he sought a suitable spouse. In 1628 he jilted Lady Lucy Abercorn (to whom he had been affianced in 1613) in favour of one of the sisters of James Stuart, fourth duke of Lennox. Nothing came of this match and so he turned to Honora Burke, a half-sister of the earl of Essex and the daughter of Frances Walsingham and the fourth earl of Clanricarde and St Albans, the most powerful Old English grandee in Connaught. After much wrangling the countess of St Albans dismissed the match as &#145;most inconvenient and dangerous&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 46188, fols. 124, 126). Undaunted he married, in April 1635, Katherine Villiers (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Manners), duchess of Buckingham (1603?&#150;1649) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69581/', "MacDonnell, Katherine")</script>], the most eligible widow at court, and through her secured the patronage of&#151;among others&#151;Archbishop William Laud and the king himself.<br>
<br>On his father's death in 1636 MacDonnell became second earl of Antrim and inherited the baronies of Dunluce, Cary, and Kilconway, co. Antrim, together with Dunluce Castle, and took control over his brother's estates in the barony of Glenarm. His empire covered nearly 340,000 acres, making him the largest landowner in Ulster and one of the greatest in Ireland. Determined to improve his estates he travelled to Ireland in 1637 and later boasted:<blockquote>I have compounded my affairs here with my tenants wherein I was not so inward to my [own] profit as to the general good and settlement by binding them to plant [trees] and husband their holdings so near as may be to the manner of England. (Sheffield Archives, Strafford MS 17, fol. 151)</blockquote>Contemporary valuations suggest that he received an approximate annual rental from his Irish lands of between &pound;6000 and &pound;8300.<br>
<br>Ultimately Antrim's power rested not on his estates but on the influence he exercised over a heterogeneous pool of people both in Ulster and along the western seaboard of Scotland. To begin with he commanded the loyalty and support of many of his co. Antrim tenants (especially the native Irish and highland Scottish ones) and the various branches of the Irish MacDonnells. He enjoyed extensive contacts in Scotland: the MacDonnells of Antrim, the MacDonalds of Dunyvaig and the Glens, of Clanranald, of Glengarry, of Keppoch, and of Sleat all shared a common heritage and outlook and were united by an overriding ambition to rid the Western Isles of their arch-rivals, the clan Campbell. The earl was also closely allied to the great Catholic Scottish house of Gordon and, as an opponent of Campbell hegemony, was supported by the Ogilvies, the Hamiltons, and the lesser clans of MacLeod of Lewis, MacNeils of Gigha, MacAllasters of Loup, and MacFies of Colonsay. These ties of blood and animosity were supplemented by bonds of marriage. Thanks to the carefully calculated marriages of his siblings the earl was allied with leading Old English families in the pale (the Westmeaths, Slanes, Dillons, and Louths), and native Irish ones in Munster (MacCarthy More) and in Connaught (the O'Connors). Their strongest connections were in Ulster, where they had intermarried with most of the leading Gaelic families (the O'Neills, O'Haras, O'Cahans, MacQuillans, and O'Donnells) and even with English protestant settlers such as Sir Moses Hill. Given these links and the English patronage networks he had access to through his wife, Antrim enjoyed the rare privilege of truly being a man of the &#145;three kingdoms&#146;.<br>
<br>After spending three years living at court &#145;in great expense and some lustre&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.509), excessive debts forced the couple to move to Ireland in September 1638. Surviving figures suggest that Antrim's debts probably hovered between &pound;40,000 and &pound;42,000 during the late 1630s, and by the end of 1638 there was hardly a leading merchant or tradesman in London and Dublin to whom he did not owe money. Hence he mortgaged many of his own&#151;and his wife's&#151;properties, including the barony of Cary, the lordship of Ballycastle, Rathlin Island, and his English mansion in Hampshire, and other assets in order to raise money. Ironically, however, being in debt also had a positive side, and in Antrim's case his indebtedness&#151;particularly to leading landowners in Ulster and to members of the London business community&#151;helped to ensure his political survival. At the Restoration his creditors formed a powerful pressure group which lobbied for the earl's restoration principally to ensure that the money he owed them from the late 1630s might at last be repaid. In the long term, therefore, his debts bought him political and tenurial security, while in the middle term (1640s and 1650s) his indebtedness was relative since the majority of his class was similarly embarrassed. However, his debts had their dangers in the short term (the late 1630s) because they put him in severely straitened circumstances. Frequently he could neither meet his current expenses nor raise the capital he so desperately needed to support the king during the first bishops' war.<h2>
<a name="Warandpolitics16381648"></a>War and politics, 1638&#150;1648</h2>In May 1638 the marquess of Hamilton&#151;who was eager to foster an anti-Campbell alliance&#151;recommended Antrim to the king and suggested using the MacDonnells on both sides of the north channel as bulwarks against the covenanters in western Scotland. Hamilton suggested that an army levied and paid for by Antrim, and supplemented where possible by Lord Deputy Wentworth, should be the first line of royalist offence in the west of Scotland. In return Charles promised the earl that &#145;whatsoever land he can conquer from them [the Campbells], he, having pretense of right, he shall have the same&#146;  (<span class="italic">Strafforde's Letters</span>, 2.319). By spring 1639 Antrim had levied an army of 5000 foot and 200 horse. These men were drawn from the leading Irish families in Ulster: the O'Neills, O'Haras, O'Lurgans, Magennisses, MacGuires, MacMahons, MacDonnells, MacHenrys; or, as the lord deputy charmingly phrased it, &#145;as many Oe's and Macs's as would startle a whole council board&#146; and &#145;in a great part the sons of habituated traitors&#146;  (<span class="italic">Strafforde's Letters</span>, 2.300). Ultimately the expedition was frustrated by Charles I's inconsistent attitude towards it and by Wentworth's hostility to it. Yet the abortive expedition was not without significance. On the one hand, it destabilized affairs in Scotland by alienating support for the king and forcing Argyll and his followers into the covenanting camp. On the other, the king's willingness to conspire with an Irish papist against his protestant subjects (albeit Scottish ones) did little to dispel the rumours of popish plots which were circulating around London.<br>
<br>Antrim played no part in the second bishops' war and from the summer of 1640 until the outbreak of the Irish rising he appears to have lived principally in Dublin, where Sir Adam Loftus, a senior government official, leased the couple his house. From here Antrim continued to plot with the king. According to his own account (made in May 1650), some time early in May 1641 Charles I sent Antrim and Ormond a messenger with instructions that Wentworth's new army should be increased to 20,000, &#145;armed out of the store of Dublin, and employed against the parliament&#146;  (Hill, 448&#150;51). This Antrim plot came to nothing and it was the O'More&#150;Maguire plot which gave rise to the insurrection of October 1641. With the outbreak of rebellion Antrim remained in Dublin and agreed to act as an intermediary with the &#145;discontented gentlemen&#146; (as he termed the insurgents). In order to negotiate more effectively he moved to the earl of Castlehaven's house at Maddenstown in co. Kildare, where he harboured &#145;a great number of English protestants that had been robbed by the rebels&#146; and then helped them find their way to safety  (TCD, MS 813, fols. 285&#150;285<i>v</i>). It was there that he learned that his followers in co. Antrim had joined the rising and that a Scottish army, under the command of Robert Monro, had occupied his patrimony. The need to recover his estates became his priority for the next twenty years, and he was prepared to do almost anything in order to secure their return.<br>
<br>In an attempt to do so by forging a deal with the Scottish commander in Ulster, Antrim travelled to Dunluce, where he was captured in May 1642. Six months later he escaped when a friend procured a passport for an invalid to leave Carrickfergus Castle, and Antrim, disguised as an invalid, fled to a waiting ship bound for Carlisle; from there he journeyed to York, where he joined his wife some time in November. He spent most of his time at York plotting an invasion of Scotland with the queen, the details of which were made public in May 1643 when he was captured by a Scottish colonel off the coast of co. Down. Following another dramatic escape from Carrickfergus he hurried to Waterford, where the third general assembly of the confederate Catholics had just convened. Almost at once he secured the support of the general assembly for an invasion of Scotland. The confederates promised to raise and transport 2000&#150;3000 men to the Western Isles to join forces with troops levied by the Scottish royalists under the command of the marquess of Montrose. The following June some 1600 fully armed soldiers under the command of Alasdair MacColla left Ireland to form the backbone of Montrose's very successful army.<br>
<br>Delighted, the king rewarded Antrim with a marquessate in February 1645. However, the need to reinforce his brigade in Scotland now preoccupied him. Unable to secure additional aid from the confederates he turned to the Spaniards. In May 1645 he signed a contract with Manuel de Moura y Cortereal, marqu&eacute;s de Castel Rodrigo, governor-general of the Spanish Netherlands, promising to recruit, from among his Irish and Scottish dependants, &#145;2,000 men, of which he is to be the colonel&#146;  (B. Jennings, ed., <span class="italic">Wild Geese in Spanish Flanders</span>, 1964, 368). In return Castel Rodrigo gave him two Dunkirk frigates which he collected late in 1645. Rather than sail directly to Scotland, as originally planned, in November 1645 Antrim led his armada instead to Falmouth in Cornwall, where he rescued the prince of Wales and provided supplies, subsequently stored in Pendennis Castle, for the beleaguered royalist garrisons in Cornwall. Early in 1646 he returned to Ireland and set his frigates up as privateers. Within a short period he had acquired at least four other vessels which provided him with a lucrative, if erratic, source of income and enabled him to ship supplies and reinforcements to Scotland.<br>
<br>In May 1646 Antrim arrived in the Western Isles with between 600 and 800 men. Even before he had disembarked his troops, the political situation in all three Stuart kingdoms was transformed when Charles I handed himself over to the Scots near Newark in Nottinghamshire on 5 May 1646. Almost immediately the king sent orders that all men in arms in Scotland in his name should disband their forces. Fired both by his desire to keep the traditional clan Donald heartland under his command and by the hope that his continued presence there would free his lands in co. Antrim from the Scottish army of occupation, Antrim refused. Then during the late summer and autumn of 1646 Antrim mooted &#145;a design to raise &hellip; 30,000 men &hellip; to reduce Scotland this winter &hellip; and from hence to march into England&#146;. Their quarrel, royalists at the exiled court in France later reported to the king, &#145;is to be, to free your majesty from imprisonment&#146;  (Scrope and Monkhouse, 2.271). Antrim's military endeavours in Scotland were thus no longer merely an embarrassment, but rather a serious threat to any chance of securing a British peace. Only after Charles I personally intervened did the marquess order his army to disband, his compliance purchased by an express verbal undertaking that as soon as Argyll's estates in Kintyre could be forfeited he would receive all those lands that he claimed belonged to the MacDonnells.<br>
<br>Antrim returned to Ireland in January 1647 and played a key role in the seventh confederate general assembly by leading the opposition to any peace with Ormond. In March the general assembly elected him president of the new supreme council and he became responsible for the day-to-day administration of the confederate armies, for the smooth running of the confederate provincial assemblies, and for the distribution of confederate material and financial resources. His eagerness to serve as a member of the supreme council and his enthusiastic adherence to the papal nuncio, Rinuccini, marked a new phase in his political career and illustrated his willingness to be formally associated with the Irish Catholic&#151;as opposed to the royalist&#151;cause. Despite his ties to the increasingly unpopular nuncio, Antrim was nominated by the eighth general assembly as part of a confederate delegation to treat with the royalist court in exile. He arrived at St Germain in March 1648 but was outwitted by Ormond during the subsequent negotiations. Furious and increasingly marginalized, Antrim resorted to armed rebellion in an effort to undermine Ormond (who returned to Ireland in September 1648 at the head of a pan-archipelagic royalist coalition). The plan ran awry from the start and the insurrection was quashed, forcing Antrim to flee late in 1648 to the safety of Owen Roe O'Neill's camp in Ulster.<h2>
<a name="Laterlifeandassessment"></a>Later life and assessment</h2>With the death of his wife in November 1649 Antrim's prospects looked increasingly bleak, yet in another remarkable volte-face he clandestinely threw in his lot with the Cromwellians. Though the details are obscure, he appears to have been in fairly close contact with the parliamentarian commander, Michael Jones, since he returned from France in the autumn of 1648 and quickly made contact with Henry Ireton, Cromwell's son-in-law, when he arrived in Ireland late in the summer of 1649. He demonstrated his willingness to serve the Cromwellians by securing the surrender of New Ross (19 October 1649), by persuading his former followers to surrender Carlow peacefully (July 1650), and by disrupting the Scottish royalists' war effort during the third civil war. The administration in Dublin, though it refused to restore his estates, rewarded him financially for his loyalty to the regime. In addition to an annual pension of &pound;500 (later increased to &pound;800), he received occasional additional contributions towards everyday expenses and the Cromwellians also paid off a number of his creditors. In 1653 Antrim married a protestant heiress, Rose O'Neill (1631&#150;1695), daughter of Sir Henry O'Neill and Martha Stafford. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69582/', "Rose MacDonnell")</script> and her husband remained in east Ulster throughout the 1650s.<br>
<br>With the restoration of Charles II, Antrim was immediately imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he languished until May 1661. However, thanks to an extraordinary combination of factors&#151;especially the tenacity of his creditors, and the support and generosity of his family, the queen mother, and members of her court, combined with the fact that his enemies were disorganized, disunited, and unprepared&#151;he finally regained his estates. In July 1663 Charles II declared the marquess &#145;innocent of any malice or rebellious purpose towards the crown&#146; and ordered Ormond to assist him to recover his estates by making known the king's wishes to the commissioners of the court of claims  (Hill, 467&#150;8). Adventurers and soldiers&#151;led by Sir John Clotworthy, later Lord Massareene&#151;who had acquired farms on the Antrim estate during the 1650s immediately protested and the publication of a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Murder Will Out</span> (August 1663) drew public attention to their grievances. But the marquess's tenacity was eventually rewarded and clause 173 of the <span class="roman">Act of Explanation</span> (December 1665) granted him a full pardon and restored him to his property in co. Antrim.<br>
<br>With this, Antrim's dramatic political career came to an end and he distanced himself from international and even national affairs&#151;dividing his time between Dunluce, his summer residence at Ballymagarry, and his wife's estate near Randalstown. He passed his time hunting, gaming, arranging suitable matches for his family and friends, interfering in county politics, socializing with other local grandees, and settling his debts. Just before he died he mortgaged his entire estate for thirty-one years so that his financial obligations to roughly 220 individuals&#151;some incurred nearly fifty years before&#151;could be honoured. On 3 February 1683 he died &#145;at his dwelling near Dunluce&#146;. Since he had not produced an heir the marquessate died out and his younger brother Alexander succeeded him as the third earl. Antrim's body lay in state until 14 March 1683 when he was finally buried, after an elaborate funeral, alongside many of his ancestors in the family vault at the Franciscan friary of Bonamargy, near Ballycastle.<br>
<br>Antrim's extraordinary career as a Caroline loyalist, Catholic confederate, Cromwellian collaborator, and Restoration pragmatist caused him to be vilified by his contemporaries and by later historians. There was undoubtedly an unsavoury, greedy, myopic side to Antrim's character and he was willing to twist ruthlessly every opportunity to his own advantage. However, there was also a very positive (and overlooked) dimension to his personality. He remained loyal to his family and kinsmen, devoted to Catholicism, and was charming, determined, dynamic, enterprising, and resourceful. These qualities, combined with the fact that he was an important political power broker in a remote and unstable corner of the three kingdoms, ensured that he survived the upheavals of the mid-seventeenth century with his inheritance, religion, political influence, and head intact.<br>
