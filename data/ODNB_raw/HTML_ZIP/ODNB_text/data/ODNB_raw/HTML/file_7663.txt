<span class="headword">Dillon,  Robert Crawford</span>  (1795&#150;1847), <span class="occ">author and rebel Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in the rectory house of St Margaret's, Lothbury, in the City of London, on 22 May 1795. His parents' names are unknown, but his father is said to have died when Robert was young; his mother then had him privately educated by John Cawood. He entered St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in the Michaelmas term of 1813. He took his BA on 16 May 1817 and his MA on 3 February 1820, and proceeded BD and DD 27 October 1836. He was ordained on 20 December 1818 to the curacy of West Milton, Dorset. Having received priest's orders, in 1819 he was appointed assistant minister of St John's Chapel, Bedford Row, London, the recognized centre of evangelical teaching, of which Daniel Wilson, later bishop of Calcutta, was at that time the incumbent. There he became a popular preacher, and was much sought after, especially by the female members of the congregation. Dillon moved in 1824 to the curacy of Willesden and Kingsbury, Middlesex, and the next year to that of St James's, Clerkenwell; the following year, 1826, he obtained an appointment at St Matthew's Chapel, Denmark Hill, London. In 1822 Dillon was chaplain to Alderman Venables when sheriff and remained so when Venables was lord mayor of London in 1826&#150;7. In the latter year he accompanied the lord mayor and corporation on an official visit to Oxford, of which, on Venables's request, he wrote an account, published in 1826, which quickly became notorious. Its preface acknowledges that &#145;it is a species of writing not altogether in accordance with the sacred profession of which the writer is the unworthiest member&#146;  (R. C. Dillon, <span class="italic">The Lord Mayor's Visit to Oxford</span>, 1826). Its style is hyperbolic and it was felt that the mayorial party had been held up to ridicule. Dillon tried to buy up copies&#151;which were &#145;rigorously suppressed&#146;, as the bookseller's advertisement, tipped into the copy in the Bodleian, reads&#151;and the book became a collector's item.<br>
<br>In 1828 Dillon was elected by a large majority to be morning preacher of the Female Orphan Asylum, a post which he resigned the next year for a proprietary chapel in Charlotte Street, Pimlico, to which he was licensed on 24 July 1829. From 1829 to 1837 he was early-morning lecturer at St Swithin's, London Stone, where he attracted large congregations. During this period Dillon continued his evening lectureship at St James's, Clerkenwell, and in 1839, on the vacancy of the rectory, which was in the gift of the parishioners, he became candidate for the benefice. The consequent election was marked by bribery and the publication of broadsheets. Dillon's private life was closely enquired into, and various sexual scandals were brought to light; despite the support of a vocal group of female parishioners (organized as a &#145;ladies' committee&#146;), Dillon was not elected. The charges of immorality having been proved, C. J. Blomfield, bishop of London, revoked Dillon's licence, and suspended him from his ministry in Charlotte Street on 29 February 1840. In defiance of the inhibition, Dillon continued to officiate in the chapel, and a suit was brought against him in the consistory court in April of the same year, when he was condemned with costs.<br>
<br>Dillon then left the Church of England, and, helped by his female followers, set up a &#145;reformed English church&#146; in Friar Street, Blackfriars, with a new system of discipline and a reformed liturgy. His congregation increased, and Dillon moved to a large building in White's Row, Spitalfields, where he appointed himself &#145;first presbyter&#146; or &#145;bishop&#146; of his new church, and ordained ministers to serve branch churches in various parts of London. On 26 November 1839, Dillon married Frances Charlotte, daughter of John Rumball, from whom he soon separated. In 1842 Dillon was involved in an unsavoury case in the consistory court, brought against him by his wife, for the restitution of conjugal rights. His defence was that his wife had committed adultery with James Nicholls, a barrister. In his evidence he claimed that his wife was the illegitimate daughter of John Rumball and the wife of Captain Augustus Vere Drury. Despite this, Dillon continued to be a popular preacher, and at the time of his sudden death on 8 November 1847, in the vestry of his chapel in Spitalfields, he had received large promises of money for expanding his church outside London. He was buried in the churchyard of his native parish, St Margaret's, Lothbury, in which church a mural slab was erected to his memory.<br>
