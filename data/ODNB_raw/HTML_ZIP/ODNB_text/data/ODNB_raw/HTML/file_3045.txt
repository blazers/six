<span class="headword">Bower <span class="st"> [Bowmaker]</span>,  Walter</span>  (1385&#150;1449), <span class="occ">abbot of Inchcolm and historian</span>, was born at Haddington. Nothing is known of his parentage, though he may have been related to a John Bowmaker who served as a bailie and custumar at Haddington in the late 1390s. In 1436 he was represented at the Roman court by a John Bowmaker, the rector of a Stirlingshire church; and in 1437 he was a mandatory for a papal provision to an Alexander Bowmaker, an Augustinian canon at St Andrews and teacher of law in the new university there. But no family relationships can be proved.<br>
<br>Since Bower's chronicle contains many references to events over the years in and around Haddington, it may be assumed that he grew up there and afterwards kept in touch. It would be about 1400 that he joined the community of Augustinian canons who served St Andrews Cathedral, for he appears to write about Bishop Walter Trail (<i>d</i>. 1401) from personal knowledge. He certainly trained as a novice from 1400 onwards under Prior James Biset, who held office from 1394 to 1416 and was one of the founders of the university at St Andrews. Bower himself describes vividly the celebrations surrounding the arrival in February 1414 of various bulls of privileges for the new university from Benedict XIII, the Avignon pope who was then recognized in Scotland. He was surely an eyewitness. And by 29 November 1417 he had qualified as a bachelor of canon law, when provided on that day by Pope Benedict as abbot of the Augustinian monastery on the island of Inchcolm in the Firth of Forth. He was blessed as abbot by his diocesan, the bishop of Dunkeld, on 17 April 1418. By 22 November 1420 he was claiming to hold the further university degree of bachelor of theology. There is no record of his ever having studied abroad, and so it is presumed that he earned his degrees at St Andrews. At any rate these degrees are a guide to the kind of intellectual training according to scholastic method that is reflected in his writing.<h2>
<a name="AbbotofInchcolm"></a>Abbot of Inchcolm</h2>Some evidence survives regarding the measures which he took as abbot between 1420 and 1435 to secure his abbey's property. With papal backing for several years he forced the bishop of Dunkeld to compromise in a dispute over the appropriated vicarage of Dalgety nearby in Fife. He took the trouble to obtain a papal protection for the abbey's property on 27 February 1430: as a monastic superior qualified in law, he knew what had to be done to guard the abbey's possessions.<br>
<br>As it turned out Bower was to remain abbot of the modestly endowed abbey on Inchcolm for more than thirty years until his death. He twice became involved in attempts to move to the wealthier house of his order at Holyrood, near Edinburgh. His first attempt was as early as 1420, but his hopes were dashed in 1423 when a candidate supported by the governor of Scotland at the time (Murdoch Stewart, duke of Albany) secured the office. When that abbot quarrelled with one of his canons in 1436&#150;7, Bower was given papal authority to sort things out at Holyrood; yet the main body of canons were successful in having his powers cancelled. Inchcolm remained his base, within sight of Edinburgh.<h2>
<a name="Involvementinpubliclife"></a>Involvement in public life</h2>As abbot even of that small house Bower ranked as one of the ecclesiastical magnates of Scotland, and after the return of James I from captivity in England in 1424 he was presumably a regular attender at the king's councils and parliaments. He was certainly engaged on duties within the royal administration from time to time. He served several times as a collector of taxes&#151;first for two years from May 1424 to raise funds to pay the king's ransom, and then for other purposes in 1431 and 1433. He tells himself in his book of how unpopular these unfamiliar levies were among all sections of the community. In late 1431 he had to provide custody on Inchcolm for the countess of Ross, the mother of Alexander MacDonald, lord of the Isles, whose power the king was intent on curbing.<br>
<br>In at least one parliament, that which met in January 1435, he was appointed to a committee to hear &#145;causes and complaints&#146;, and in the absence of similar records for other parliaments we may assume that with his legal training he regularly served in this way. But only once do we have information (provided by Bower himself) about his participation in practical politics. This is found in his report of a debate at a council general in October 1433 to discuss a response to a peace embassy from England. Bower was involved in collecting and summing up the views of the majority in favour of rejecting the English advances because of Scotland's prior commitment to France; and he tells with some satisfaction that the abbot of Melrose, who had spoken in favour of peace with England, was soon afterwards forced to recant his opinions when challenged by the inquisitor of heretical deviation. Bower was apparently in favour of an authoritarian alliance of church and state, a stance which he was to develop more theoretically when he came to write his great work. He was clearly a man with considerable administrative and political experience, not a man of the study.<br>
<br>If he had views of this kind about strong government, it is understandable why Bower went to such lengths in his book to lament the murder of King James in 1437. Not much is known about his activities in the first years after the king's death; but by the early 1440s at any rate he can be seen to be involved in the troubled affairs of the minority government of the young James II, attending general councils on 3 April 1441 and 9 February 1442, and serving again as an auditor of causes and complaints in the parliament of July 1445. He had his reward from the government on 8 June 1441, when a crown charter erected the lands of Inchcolm Abbey into a barony to help his community to recover from damage done by pirates.<h2>
<a name="TheScotichronicon"></a>The Scotichronicon</h2>It was while Bower was still engaged on such public duties as well as heading his monastic community that, without any known previous experience as a writer, he half unwillingly composed his <span class="italic">Scotichronicon</span>, the most elaborate work of Latin literature to survive from medieval Scotland. This came about when he was asked by a neighbouring laird, Sir David Stewart of Rosyth, to transcribe the chronicle and annals composed some eighty years earlier by John Fordun, and on the basis of the annals to continue the chronicle from the year 1153 (where Fordun had stopped) to his own day. Between November 1441 and October 1445 Fordun's five books were expanded to sixteen. Bower took the chance to insert in the first five books some passages derived from his own reading, which were carefully distinguished from Fordun's original work; and then he greatly expanded the coverage of the annals with less and less regard for Fordun's text, until by books 15 and 16 he was writing contemporary history of his own down to the king's murder in 1437.<br>
<br>Bower's working fair copy, intended to be kept on Inchcolm, still exists (Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 171), and it shows how he latterly had his scribe make many marginal additions with extra material, all of which after his death came to be incorporated in the main text of all five of the surviving copies which were made in the next sixty years for various other monasteries and individuals. One of the copyists was <a name="cosubject_17630"></a><span class="headword">Magnus Makculloch</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1477&#150;1484), who was probably born at Tain, Ross-shire, and is recorded as a student at Louvain in 1477. In 1481 and 1483&#150;4 he made full copies of Bower's work for the Augustinian abbey of Scone and Archbishop William Scheves of St Andrews respectively. On the strength of two pages of additional annals relating to the reign of James II (1437&#150;60) which were copied into the latter of these manuscripts, Makculloch has sometimes been given the scarcely deserved status of continuator of Bower's work; but he was a <span class="occ">professional scribe</span> rather than a scholar.<br>
<br>As early as 1444 Bower was working also on a shortened version of his main chronicle (now represented by a later copy, NL Scot., MS Advocates 35.1.7), which contains some extra items as well as Bower's own literary improvements. After a period of failing health he died on 24 December 1449. The whole corpus of his two books has been published in Latin and in English translation with commentary.<h2>
<a name="Outlookandpurposes"></a>Outlook and purposes</h2>Besides handing on Fordun's work, Bower preserves with convincing reliability a wide range of supplementary information about people and events in Scotland between 1153 and 1437. But his didactic aims (not least with the training of the young James II in mind) led him to expand the scope of the book to include discussion of many other matters. He thought, for example, that his Scottish readers should be better informed about developments on the continent from Roman times onwards, and in general he gave more space to people and events in France than in England. This reflects the experience and intellectual outlook of his putative teachers in St Andrews, who had been students at Paris. He drew on his academic training also for literary allusions and parallels from the works of classical and medieval writers to illumine Scottish history by putting it into proportion in a larger intellectual context. Such features in his book are the product of the culture of fifteenth-century Scotland, and his work (including various later summaries of it) helped to perpetuate this attitude well into the sixteenth century.<br>
<br>Bower shared Fordun's hostility to English aggression and enthusiasm for Scottish liberty, while at the same time he added warning passages of political reflection on how all kinds of people in authority should conduct themselves. His advice was not merely theoretical, but based on personal experience, especially in the light of the factional rivalries in the years following the death of James I which were harming the country as he was writing; and as a practised preacher he knew how to engage the interest of his readers by inserting pithy stories with a moral. His declared intention, indeed, was to entertain, though as a churchman he did not fail to paint the horrors of hell, and particularly those that awaited sinners in high places who disobeyed the laws of the church. He was not just a chronicler preserving all that he could find about the past: he was a sage through whose wide-ranging reflections much can be learned about the customs and attitudes of his time.<br>
