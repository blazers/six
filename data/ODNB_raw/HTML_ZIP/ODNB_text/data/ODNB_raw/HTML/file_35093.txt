<span class="headword">Moorhouse,  James</span>  (1826&#150;1915), <span class="occ">bishop of Melbourne and bishop of Manchester</span>, was born at Sheffield on 19 November 1826, the only son of James Moorhouse, master cutler, and his wife, Jane Frances, evangelical daughter of Captain Richard Bowman, of Whitehaven. Intended originally to follow his father, he was educated privately and at St John's College, Cambridge. After a period of doubt he underwent a mystical conversion. He was ordained priest in 1854.<br>
<br>After serving curacies at St Neot's (1854&#150;5), at Sheffield (1855&#150;9), and at Hornsey, London (1859&#150;61), Moorhouse was appointed perpetual curate of St John's, Fitzroy Square, London, in 1862, and vicar of St James's, Paddington, in 1868. Lord Salisbury was a parishioner at St John's and became Moorhouse's patron. A forthright, vivid preacher, by this time Moorhouse had been the first curate ever appointed select preacher to the University of Cambridge, in 1861; he was also Hulsean lecturer in 1864, and Warburton lecturer at Lincoln's Inn in 1876. In 1874 he was made chaplain-in-ordinary to the queen and prebendary of St Paul's. He married on 12 September 1861 Mary Lydia (<i>d</i>. 1906), daughter of the Revd Thomas Sale, vicar of Sheffield. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>In 1876 Moorhouse was consecrated bishop of Melbourne, having refused the see of Calcutta. At Melbourne his eloquence, leadership, administrative abilities, and physical strength flowered. He played the bluff Yorkshire gentleman, smoked a pipe, drank wine, walked a bulldog, attended football matches, and won deep affection. His public lectures&#151;historical, philosophical, and theological&#151;were conventional and simplistic, but they drew audiences of up to 4000 people.<br>
<br>In 1878 Moorhouse started a new building for the theological faculty at Trinity College in the University of Melbourne. In the 1880s he oversaw the building of a cathedral designed by William Butterfield, costing &pound;100,000, and in 1882 he presided over the synod which framed the constitution of the Church in Australia. As chancellor of Melbourne University from 1884 to 1886, he defended the traditional education in the classics and opposed the foundation of a women's college. He made strenuous journeys to distant parishes and out-stations for three months in each year, and he stimulated the religious life of priests and settlers.<br>
<br>To the consternation of those in Melbourne, Moorhouse was called to the see of Manchester in 1886 (he was about to be offered Southwell in 1884, but Gladstone changed his mind). Besides the ordinary activities of a very extensive diocese, to which he devoted himself wholeheartedly, he continued the Victorian practice of personally visiting each of his 600 parishes, entering each church and inspecting each church school. His most notable public efforts were a sermon to the British Association in 1887, an address to the church congress at Manchester in 1888, a reply to Cardinal Vaughan's assertion of Roman Catholic claims in the Manchester diocese in 1894, and, consistent with his policy in Victoria, attempts to protect religious instruction and church schools. He retired from Manchester in 1903 and died at his home, Poundisford Park, near Taunton, on 9 April 1915. He left an estate of over &pound;54,000.<br>
<br>Moorhouse was a broad-churchman, outwardly tolerant, but invariably a fierce defender of scriptural authority and protestantism. His earliest published lectures included an attack on Baden-Powell's contribution to <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span>. He read German biblical criticism in translation and reproduced ill-digested conflations of it in his sermons. Moorhouse upheld the authenticity of miracles in the apostolic age, but allowed that scientific laws obtained in the post-apostolic era. He took a mystical view of the incarnation and of atonement, and conceded that parts of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> were morally indefensible. Moorhouse supported Christian working men's clubs and church missions to the urban poor, but he opposed independent working men's political and trades-union activities as threats to social order and property. He was an orthodox believer, sustained by his inner light and his will to believe.<br>
