<span class="headword">Beddoe,  John</span>  (1826&#150;1911), <span class="occ">physician and anthropologist</span>, was born in Bewdley, Worcestershire, on 21 September 1826, the son of John Beddoe JP, a merchant, and Emma, daughter of Henry Barrer Child of Bewdley. Educated at Bridgnorth School, he studied medicine at University College, London, graduating in 1851. He then studied at Edinburgh University where he received an MD in 1853 and became house physician at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. In 1846 Beddoe began observations on hair and eye colours in the west of England, and continued these in Orkney (1852). During the Crimean War he was assistant physician at a civil hospital at Renkioi. After completing his medical training at Vienna, Beddoe made an extended continental tour. In 1857 he began practising as a physician at Clifton in Bristol. On 15 September 1858 in Foulden, Berwickshire, he married Agnes Montgomerie (<i>b</i>. 1828/9), daughter of the Revd Alexander Christison and his wife, Helen, and niece of Sir Robert Christison. They had one son and one daughter. Beddoe was physician to the Bristol Royal Infirmary (1862&#150;73) and consulting physician to the children's hospital there (1866&#150;1911).<br>
<br>Beddoe began active research in ethnology during his early travels in Europe scanning bodies &#145;ready to hand in streets and market places&#146;  (Beddoe, <span class="italic">Races</span>, 2), and became an authority on the physical characteristics of living European races. He was to have an important influence on the development of anthropology in both Britain and continental Europe, leaving an inheritance of great taxonomic subtlety as he strove to compile, county by county, a detailed physical anthropological account of the races of Britain before the railway confused older patterns of distribution. Beddoe devised three categories for eye colour: the first consisted of blue and light grey, the second of dark grey and very light hazel or yellow, the third of brown, hazel, and black. In England he found the &#145;British Bronze race&#146;  (ibid., 270), a &#145;richly endowed&#146; breed, was preserved in its greatest purity in those with blue eyes and light hair, while the artisan class was &#145;generally darker&#146; and increasing disproportionately through &#145;rapid multiplication&#146;  (ibid.). His empirical observations were influenced by racialist ideas which emerged through his choice of language, with terms such as &#145;purity&#146; and &#145;rapid multiplication&#146; betraying his prejudices and alignments. Beddoe's observations on colour and race hierarchy had already been endorsed by the renowned ethnologist James Cowles Prichard, who argued that the lighter varieties of the human race were analogous to &#145;the finer, and more delicate specimens in other kinds&#146; which are often endowed with &#145;a more beautiful appearance&#146;  (ibid., 169); these ideas were soon taken up and developed by Francis Galton, founder of eugenics. Beddoe and Galton corresponded and exchanged research: for example, in 1887 Beddoe sent Galton his &#145;promised paper on the stature of the older races of England, as deduced from their long bones&#146;  (Beddoe to Galton, 26 April 1887, UCL, Galton MS, 199). Evidently, the class and race based statistics Beddoe had accumulated were useful for Galton's own researches into heredity and population.<br>
<br>The cluster of ideas informing Beddoe's researches directly influenced the work of the late nineteenth-century sexologist Havelock Ellis. Ellis took up the pattern of sexual difference at work in Beddoe's observations on colour, observing in <span class="italic">Man and Woman: a Study of Human Sexual Secondary Characters</span> (1894): &#145;women have darker hair than men, and decidedly darker eyes&#146;  (pp. 314&#150;15). He noted that the question of the proportion of brown eyes among women in a given population &#145;was fully studied in the first place by the late Dr. Beddoe&#146;  (ibid., 309) and declared himself &#145;indebted to Dr. Beddoe for a series of figures showing the sexual differences in various parts of Great Britain&#146;  (ibid.). Charles Darwin drew on Beddoe's work in <span class="italic">The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</span> (1871), arguing:<blockquote>Dr Beddoe has lately proved that, with the inhabitants of Britain, residence in towns and certain occupations have a deteriorating influence on height; and he infers that the result is to a certain extent inherited, as is likewise the case in the United States. Dr Beddoe further believes that wherever a &#145;race attains its maximum of physical development, it rises highest in energy and moral vigour&#146;. (Darwin, 115)</blockquote>Beddoe emphasized &#145;the theory of a hereditary and progressive physical degeneration in certain classes of the inhabitants of towns&#146;, selecting Cornwall as one of the few places in Britain &#145;which produce the finest and largest men&#146;. These men &#145;yield more than their share of ability and energy for the national benefit&#146;  (Beddoe, &#145;Stature&#146;, 566&#150;7). His research was underpinned by ideas of social and racial hierarchy and national worth, ideas which reached full fruition in Galton's theories of &#145;civic worth&#146; in the late nineteenth century. Beddoe's interest in the relationships among physical appearance, moral qualities, and social position was part of the enthusiasm for a biological basis for hierarchy which came to birth in the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>In 1853 Beddoe published &#145;Contributions to Scottish ethnology&#146; and in 1908, in &#145;A last contribution to Scottish ethnology&#146;, he surveyed intervening developments in the field. In 1867 he received from the Welsh national eisteddfod a prize of 100 guineas for the best essay on the origin of the English nation; this became part of <span class="italic">The Races of Britain: a Contribution to the Anthropology of Western Europe</span> (1885). Beddoe's racial data &#145;On the stature and bulk of man in the British Isles&#146; appeared in 1870 in <span class="italic">Memoirs Read before the Anthropological Society of London</span>. In 1903 he published a paper in <span class="italic">L'Anthropologie</span>, &#145;De l'&eacute;valuation et de la signification de la capacit&eacute; cranienne&#146;, which was received with hostility by Karl Pearson, professor of applied mathematics and mechanics at University College, London, from 1884, and founder of biometrics, and M. A. Lewenz, in a joint paper in <span class="italic">Biometrica</span> in 1904. They accused him of showing &#145;a complete ignorance of the nature of modern statistical theory&#146;, namely correlation&#151;the mathematical process of finding the best linear relation between the known value of one character and the most probable value of a second&#151;and the regression curve; it was, they emphasized, only with such methods that &#145;we can hope to render anthropometry in all its branches a real science. The day for the old methods is once and for ever gone&#146;  (Lewenz and Pearson, 367&#150;8). Conceding that Beddoe had &#145;done good service in widening the field of anthropometric interest in this country&#146;, they stressed that<blockquote>statistical enquiry is not a field for guesswork and elementary arithmetic; there is a mathematical science of statistics which must be learnt, and papers dealing numerically with anthropometric and craniometric data which do not now apply this theory are simply outside the field of science.</blockquote>They also emphasized that in addition to method in statistical reduction a craniologist should distinguish between &#145;what holds for a local race of man, and what may be applied to mankind as a whole&#146;, and criticized Beddoe for drawing no distinction here, or between the sexes.<blockquote>Dr Beddoe makes no attempt to deduce intra-racial formulae from fairly homogeneous racial series by recognised statistical methods; he does not then compare these among themselves and see whether an inter-racial one can be deduced from them. He simply makes a guess, tries it on a most heterogeneous series, and if it does not fit makes another guess &hellip; This is not science; it is the dilettantism which in the past has made anthropometry and craniometry impossible subjects for academic study. (ibid., 396&#150;7)</blockquote>Beddoe replied in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute</span> (34, 1904).<br>
<br>Beddoe was a founding member of the Ethnological Society, president of the Anthropological Society (1869&#150;70) and of the Anthropological Institute (1889&#150;91). In 1905 he delivered the Huxley lecture of the Anthropological Institute, &#145;Colour and race&#146;, and received the Huxley memorial medal. He served on the council of the British Association, 1870&#150;75, and co-authored its &#145;Anthropological instructions for travellers&#146;. In 1890 he was made Officier (premi&egrave;re classe) de l'Instruction Publique, France; he was a member of a number of European anthropological societies. He was elected FRCP in 1873 and after retiring from practice in Bristol in 1891 he moved to Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire. In the same year the University of Edinburgh conferred on him the honorary degree of LLD and in 1908 the University of Bristol elected him honorary professor of anthropology. A founder member of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society (established in 1875), Beddoe became its president in 1890, and in 1909 was president of the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society. At the time of his death he was president of the British Kyrle Society. Beddoe died on 19 July 1911 at his home, The Chantry, Bradford-on-Avon, as a result of a prostatic haemorrhage.<br>
