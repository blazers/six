<span class="headword">Manvell,  (Arnold) Roger</span>  (1909&#150;1987), <span class="occ">film critic and historian</span>, was born on 10 October 1909 at St Barnabas vicarage, Leicester, the only child of the Revd Arnold Edward William Manvell, later canon of Peterborough Cathedral, and his wife, Gertrude Theresa Baines. He was educated at King's School in Peterborough. He studied English literature at University College, Leicester, obtaining his PhD on W. B. Yeats at London University. He began work in 1931 as a schoolmaster and adult education lecturer in Leicester, moving to the department of extramural studies at Bristol University in 1937.<br>
<br>In 1940 Manvell joined the films division of the Ministry of Information, screening factual films and lecturing to non-theatrical audiences. Seizing the opportunities offered by current interest in &#145;film appreciation&#146;, he wrote <span class="italic">Film</span> (1944), which broke new ground as a critical history of the great films of the past. It was an immediate best-seller, introducing a whole generation to an understanding of film as an art form. In the following year he was appointed research officer and lecturer at the British Film Institute and was instrumental in setting up, and at first guiding, the institute's academic series of volumes <span class="italic">The History of the British Film</span>.<br>
<br>In 1946 Manvell began broadcasting and his name became a household word through the BBC series <span class="italic">The Critics</span>. Also in 1946 he founded the <span class="italic">Penguin Film Review</span>, and edited it until 1949, and in 1947 became the first director of the senior film-makers' own organization, the British Film Academy, the forerunner of BAFTA, where he remained until 1959. All the while he busily produced books written or edited by himself alone or in collaboration with experts in various aspects of the cinema. After 1959 he acted as consultant to the British Film Academy, continuing to write, lecture, and sit on numerous committees. He was also prominent in the humanist movement, and was associate editor of <span class="italic">New Humanist</span> from 1967 to 1975. Books of film criticism, analysis, and history continued thick and fast, interspersed with biographies of Charlie Chaplin (1974) and of several great English actresses. In later years he was involved in film studies at Sussex University, Louisville University (1973), and the London Film School, of which he was a governor (1966&#150;74), and he did useful work for the Society of Authors and other bodies.<br>
<br>Manvell also took up a new interest. Heinrich Fraenkel, a Jewish film journalist and scriptwriter, who had fled Germany in 1933, had founded a Free German movement in Britain and written several slight books to persuade his adopted country that not all Germans were Nazi. Manvell began a fruitful collaboration with him in 1959 with a thoughtful and well-documented biography, <span class="italic">Doctor Goebbels</span> (1960). Together, during the next dozen years they produced eight solid books on the history of Nazism, including four biographies and an account of the 1944 July plot to kill Hitler. Fraenkel had gone to the Nuremberg trials and interviewed many key people. He had valuable contacts in Germany, as well as access to relevant archives. Manvell's expertise in scholarly presentation, as well as his wide contacts and fluent style, helped make this an important body of work.<br>
<br>By 1975 film studies in Britain and France had developed in directions uncongenial to a man of Manvell's generation and he felt more at home in American universities. He joined Boston University in 1975, was made a professor in 1982, and worked there for the rest of his life, continuing his large and varied output of books, of which two of the most notable were <span class="italic">Films and the Second World War</span> (1974) and <span class="italic">Elizabeth Inchbald, England's Leading Woman Dramatist</span> (1987).<br>
<br>In 1970 Manvell was made commander of the order of merit of the Italian Republic, and in 1971 was awarded the order of merit (first class) of the German Federal Republic. A scholar&#150;teacher of the year award for 1984&#150;5 from Boston University followed, as well as an honorary DFA of New England College (1972), and honorary DLitts from Sussex (1971), Leicester (1974), and Louisville (1979) universities.<br>
<br>These were meagre distinctions for an influential writer who had pioneered the serious study of film in his native land. Brisk and practical, he was a good organizer and a prolific writer, who combined accuracy with a readable middlebrow style. Even his puzzling insistence on the use of his academic title of &#145;Dr&#146; played its part, perhaps, in the emergence of film as a respectable subject for academic study, belatedly accepted at last by British universities. His assiduous use of contacts, combined with great energy and drive, did much to spread a serious appreciation of the cinema in Britain.<br>
<br>Of medium height, fairly heavily built, and inclined to be pudgy, he always seemed in a hurry to get to the next opportunity that beckoned. As he grew older his hair receded fluffily and his eyes peered shrewdly from behind thick glasses. Ambition and determination almost hid a wry, slightly sardonic humour. In 1936 he married Edith Mary, daughter of John Cook Bulman; they had one son. The marriage was dissolved and in 1946 he married Margaret Hilda, daughter of Percy James Lee, dental surgeon, of Bristol. After a divorce, in 1956 he married Louise, daughter of Charles Luson Cribb, of London. They divorced in 1981 and in the same year he married Fran&ccedil;oise Baylis, daughter of Ren&eacute; Nautr&eacute;, company director. There were no children of the final three marriages. Manvell died in Boston on 30 November 1987.<br>
