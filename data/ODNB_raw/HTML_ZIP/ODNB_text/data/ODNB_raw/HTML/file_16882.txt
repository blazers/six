<span class="headword">Loch,  Henry Brougham</span>, first Baron Loch of Drylaw  (1827&#150;1900), <span class="occ">colonial administrator</span>, born on 23 May 1827 at Drylaw, Midlothian, Scotland, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16883/', "James Loch MP (1780&#150;1855)")</script>, of Drylaw, and his wife, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1842), the daughter of Patrick Orr. His brother was the naval officer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16881/', "Granville Gower Loch (1813&#150;1853)")</script>. He entered the Royal Navy in 1840, but left it as a midshipman in 1842 and was gazetted to the 3rd Bengal cavalry in 1844. Although he was only seventeen, he was chosen by Lord Gough as his aide-de-camp, and in that capacity served through the Sutlej campaign of 1845. In 1850 he was appointed adjutant of the famous irregular corps Skinner's Horse. On the outbreak of the Crimean War his gift for managing Asian soldiers led to his being selected in 1854 to assist in organizing the Turkish horse in Bulgaria. He served throughout the war, and at its close was singled out for the employment which was destined to close his military career. In 1857 James Bruce, eighth earl of Elgin, was dispatched on a special embassy to China to arrange the final terms of settlement of the Second Opium War, then in progress, and Captain Loch was attached to his staff. He was present at the taking of Canton (Guangzhou) on 28 December and the seizure of Commissioner Ye, and he subsequently proceeded with Lord Elgin on his mission to Japan. In 1858 he was sent back to England with the treaty of Yeddo, concluded by Great Britain with that country. In 1860 the failure to obtain the ratification of the treaty of Tientsin (Tianjin) with China led to Lord Elgin being again sent out as minister-plenipotentiary. Mindful of Loch's services, he took him with him as private secretary. In conjunction with Harry Smith Parkes, Loch conducted the negotiations which led to the surrender of the Taku (Dagu) forts and he shared in the advance on Peking (Beijing).<br>
<br>On 18 September Loch formed one of the small party which was seized by Chinese officials on returning from Tungchow (Tongzhou), where they had been to arrange the preliminaries of peace. Loch had actually made his way through the enemy's lines to the British camp and had given warning of the intended arrests, but he chivalrously returned in order to try to save his comrades. For three weeks he endured the most terrible imprisonment, loaded with chains, tortured by the gaolers, and herded with the worst felons in the common prison. His situation was the more deplorable as he could not speak Chinese with any fluency. Fortunately the loyalty and determination of his fellow prisoner Parkes led first to the amelioration of his condition, and eventually to their joint release, only ten minutes before the arrival of an order from the emperor commanding their execution. On 8 October they rejoined the British camp, but, with the exception of a few Indian troopers, the rest of the party&#151;French, British, and native&#151;died in prison from maltreatment, and Loch himself never fully recovered his health. In 1869 he published his <span class="italic">Personal Narrative of Occurrences during Lord Elgin's Second Embassy to China</span>.<br>
<br>In 1860 Loch was sent home in charge of the treaty of Tientsin. The following year he finally left the army and was appointed private secretary to Sir George Grey, who was then secretary of state at the Home Office. On 7 May 1862 he married Elizabeth Villiers (1841&#150;1938), the niece of the fourth earl of Clarendon; they had two daughters and a son. In 1863 Loch was made governor of the Isle of Man, a post which he occupied until 1882. In 1880 he was appointed KCB. He was transferred in 1882 to a commissionership of woods and forests and land revenue, and his career outside the somewhat narrow bounds of the British civil service seemed at an end. In 1884, however, Gladstone sent him to Australia, as governor of Victoria. He was made a GCMG on 24 May 1887. During his five years' tenure of this post his kindness and tact endeared him to the population, and he left a legacy of philanthropic and cultural projects behind him when in 1889 the marquess of Salisbury, the Conservative prime minister, chose him to succeed Sir Hercules Robinson, who had just completed his first term of office as governor of the Cape and high commissioner in South Africa.<br>
<br>It was during Loch's residence at the Cape that Anglo-Boer hostility first began to assume the threatening proportions which led to the war of 1899. In Cape Colony itself matters were peaceful enough, owing to the temporary combination of Cecil Rhodes with the Afrikaner-Bond Party. There were few constitutional difficulties, and Loch found himself generally in accord with his constitutional advisers and able to work with them with little friction. Outside the borders, however, the elements of unrest were beginning to ferment, and Loch had inadequate knowledge of South African problems to enable him to master the situation. He was impressed, however, with the scale of Rhodes's conceptions, and with the danger to British paramountcy that would inevitably attend any expansion of the Transvaal republic. He therefore assisted the expeditions which led to the occupation of Mashonaland and Matabeleland, and he allowed the Bechuanaland police force to be sent up to threaten the Matabele (Ndebele) from the west on the outbreak of the war of 1893. One of his major objects was to bring Rhodes's British South Africa Company under greater imperial control, but in this he was largely unsuccessful. In 1891 he did, however, help to establish the separate existence of the Bechuanaland protectorate, which later evolved into Botswana.<br>
<br>A striking episode in Loch's South African career was his mission to Pretoria, in 1894, to interfere on behalf of the British subjects who had been commandeered by the Boers in their operations against Mmalab&ocirc;h&ocirc; or Malaboch, the Xananwa chieftain. He was successful in obtaining the abandonment of the claim of the Boer government; but it was thought he had not pressed the British case with sufficient vigour. It was the rough treatment accorded to President Kruger at Johannesburg on this occasion, in contrast with the enthusiastic reception accorded to the high commissioner, which persuaded Loch that a <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> by British Transvaalers, with subsequent imperial military backing, was feasible. The Colonial Office vetoed this secret project, but it reappeared in modified form, after Loch's departure, as the Jameson raid.<br>
<br>Earlier in his term of office Loch had succeeded in putting strong pressure on President Kruger to prevent the incursions to the north and west of immigrant Boer trekkers and roving filibusters. During negotiations on Swaziland he had, however, made to the Transvaal government an offer of access to the sea coast on condition that the president should moderate his attitude of hostility and join the Cape customs union, which Kruger refused.<br>
<br>Loch's Transvaal policy failed locally to create the impression of any great strength or decision. Fortunately his term of office expired at the beginning of 1895, and he left South Africa before the disasters of the Jameson raid. In spite of his bearded, patriarchal appearance, his fiery cavalryman's temperament would probably have let him down in circumstances that required a cool head.<br>
<br>On his return to England he was raised to the peerage in July 1895 as Baron Loch of Drylaw, but he took small part in politics, though he did vote with the Liberal Unionists. When, in December 1899, the reverses to the British army in Natal and Cape Colony at the hands of the Boers gave rise to the call for volunteers from Britain, Loch threw himself heartily into the movement, and took a leading share in raising and equipping a body of mounted men who were called, after him, Loch's Horse. He lived to hear of the occupation of Pretoria, but his health had been failing, and he died of heart disease after a short illness, at his home, 23 Lowndes Square, London, on 20 June 1900. He was buried on 25 June at Stoke by Clare, Suffolk.<br>
<br>His son, Edward Douglas, second baron, entered the Grenadier Guards and served with distinction in the Nile expedition of 1898 and in the South African War; he received a severe wound in the latter campaign. He also served throughout the First World War, during which he became major-general and was awarded several decorations.<br>
