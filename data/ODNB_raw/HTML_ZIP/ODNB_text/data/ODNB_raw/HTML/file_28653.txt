<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Walton,  Izaak</span>  (1593&#150;1683), <span class="occ">author and biographer</span>, was born in September 1593 and baptized on 21 September at St Mary's Church, Stafford, the only surviving son of Gervase Walton (<i>d</i>. 1597) of Yoxall, Staffordshire, and his wife, Anne (<i>c</i>.1554&#150;1623), probably a daughter of Peter Griffin and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Leigh. His father was a tippler (he kept an inn but provided neither meals nor rooms) and had moved to Stafford in 1591 after at least fifteen years of marriage. Izaak's elder brother Ambrose was buried in the town on 3 March 1596; there may have been other siblings, but only Izaak and his sister Anne survived to adulthood. Their father died on 11 February 1597, and on 8 August 1598 their mother married Humphrey Burne, baker and inn-holder. She continued to live in Stafford until her death, and was buried at St Mary's on 23 May 1623. Burne was buried on 16 March 1639.<h2>
<a name="Earlylife"></a>Early life</h2>Izaak Walton was educated at the Edward VI Grammar School, Stafford, then situated in St Bertelin's Church at the west end of St Mary's parish and likely to have been run by a single schoolmaster. This was all the formal education he received: once he became known as an author, friendly and unfriendly critics alike were inclined to note that he was rather literate than learned. It is true that, as a non-university figure who spent much of his adult life with poets and divines, he was vulnerable to patronizing judgements. But while books he is known to have owned later in life are almost all written in English, they demonstrate breadth and some intellectual curiosity, as well as a bias towards sacramentalist devotional literature. Anthony Wood, for example, remarked of his biographies that they were &#145;well done, considering the education of the author&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.698), in a very similar spirit to the one in which Leslie Stephen, over two centuries later, was to call him a &#145;worthy tradesman&#146;  (Beeching, 60).<br>
<br>About 1608, his fifteenth year, Walton left school and followed his sister Anne's new husband, Thomas Grinsell, a well-to-do linen draper, to the parish of St Dunstan-in-the-West, London, and in 1611 became his apprentice. In London, some time between 1608 and 1613, he discovered poets and poetry. Curiosity, and perhaps the &#145;genius for friendship&#146;  (Keynes, 614) which served him so well throughout his life, helped Walton to find his way in his late teens into a literary circle which included Ben Jonson (he later wrote an uncharacteristically concise&#151;not to say sharp&#151;character sketch of Jonson, in 1680, in a letter to John Aubrey, intended for the latter's <span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>). His initial introduction may have been through Samuel Page, vicar of St Nicholas, Deptford, who contributed prefatory verses to Thomas Coryat's <span class="italic">Crudities</span> (1611), a volume which included work by such writers as Michael Drayton, John Donne, and Thomas Campion. In 1613 Page brought out his book <span class="italic">The Loves of Amos and Laura</span>: printed by Grinsell's neighbour Richard Hawkins, the volume is dedicated to the twenty-year-old &#145;Iz[aak] Wa[lton]&#146;. On 12 November 1618 Walton, recommended by Grinsell, became a freeman of the Ironmongers' Company, the guild under which his own trade fell. He was a linen draper and sempster (that is, he sold cloth and made it up into garments, probably including hats), and by then he owned &#145;half a shop&#146; in Chancery Lane. His rise to prominence in the guild was marked in November 1629, when he was made a &#145;batchelor in foins&#146;: the honour conferred was signified by an official fur-trimmed costume.<h2>
<a name="FriendofJohnDonne"></a>Friend of John Donne</h2>In spring 1624 John Donne became vicar of Walton's parish of St Dunstan-in-the-West. Walton was impressed by Donne, describing himself as his &#145;convert&#146;, and his friendship was returned. Through Donne, Walton met and grew friendly with a number of his circle, including Sir Henry Wotton and the poet Henry King, later bishop of Chichester. On 27 December 1626 Walton married Rachel, daughter of William Floud and his wife, Susannah Cranmer, niece of Archbishop Thomas Cranmer; Walton had the following verse inscribed on his marriage-chest:<blockquote>
<div>We once were two, we two made one<br>
</div>
<div>We no more two, through life bee one.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Selected Writings of Izaak Walton</span>, ed. J. Martin, 1997, 158)</blockquote>Their first child, Izaak, was born on 19 December 1627; a second son, John, followed on 23 July 1629. John died some time that year, the first of the infant deaths which punctuated his parents' marriage: in 1631 Thomas, born on 21 January, died at six weeks on 6 March; and three-year-old Izaak was dead too by 28 March. Henry, born on 12 October 1632, lived only five days; a namesake born on 21 March 1634 lived only until 4 December 1634; and their last son, William, died in August 1637. A daughter, Anne (1640&#150;1642), was born on 10 July 1640, but Rachel herself then died on 22 August.<br>
<br>By the end of March 1631 John Donne had also died. Walton's later account in his <span class="italic">Life of Donne</span> (1640) strongly implies that he was present for Donne's last sermon on 25 February 1631; if so, then Donne &#145;preach[ed] &hellip; mortality by a decayed body and dying face&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lives</span>, ed. Saintsbury, 75) to a father whose three children were dead or dying. Perhaps Walton was at Donne's deathbed, three days after the death of small Izaak, witnessing at first hand the extraordinary self-possession of Donne's last performance all the way to his final breath when he &#145;closed his own eyes; and then disposed his hands and body into such a posture as required not the least alteration by those that came to shroud him&#146;  (ibid., 82). Walton's presence is suggested, if rather tentatively, in Henry King's letter to Walton, printed with the revisions of the <span class="italic">Life of Donne</span> after 1670 and first published with the <span class="italic">Life of Hooker</span> of 1665. Walton's intimacy with Donne is definitely, though problematically, implied in his involvement with the posthumous sorting and publication of Donne's work. The issue was complicated by growing difficulties between Donne's son John and his initial literary executor, Henry King, over who had authority to publish Donne's texts; but in the publications of the 1630s the employment of Walton's friend John Marriot as publisher is a reasonably stable indication of Walton's closeness to the early projects. In <span class="italic">Poems, by JD</span> (1633), one of the appended elegies, rough but attractive, is by Walton himself; in the 1635 edition further verses by Walton appear to accompany an engraving of Donne by William Marshall, and look towards the publication of the sermons. After 1637 the right of John Marriot and his son Richard to the copyrights of Donne's works was disputed by Donne the younger. Since Walton continued to use the Marriots as publishers for his own works it may be assumed that he on the whole distanced himself from the editorial claims of Donne's son, siding instead with King and the Marriots.<br>
<br>Walton was made junior warden of the yeomanry in 1637, and in 1638 was promoted to senior warden, an administrative post: he collected fines and advised members of coming meetings. That year also saw the publication of his complimentary verses before Lewis Roberts's <span class="italic">Merchants Mappe of Commerce</span>. In February 1640 Walton became verger at St Dunstan-in-the-West. The final year of the decade also saw the preparation and publication of Walton's first, and perhaps most considerable, biography: that of Donne. It initially appeared as a preface to Donne's <span class="italic">LXXX Sermons</span> (1640), though it was revised and expanded three times more in Walton's lifetime, in 1658, 1670, and 1675. Marriot was the printer; but some inconclusive evidence suggests that Walton may have tried to deal with both sides of the now hopelessly fractured editorial team: an ambiguous allusion in one of King's letters refers to Walton as the &#145;Messenger&#146; who had &#145;lost both to me and your self&#146; the collected manuscripts to Donne's son  (<span class="italic">Lives</span>, ed. Saintsbury, 15). Walton's own version, given in his introduction, of his involvement in the production of the 1640 volume was that he had researched a life projected by Sir Henry Wotton, but that Wotton's death and the spectre of a volume &#145;publisht without the Authors Life&#146;  (Walton, <span class="italic">Life and Death of Dr Donne</span>, A3) had galvanized Walton, albeit unworthily, into authorship.<br>
<br>Whatever the accuracy of this modest account of its inception (Wotton's death, in December 1639, would have left little time for Walton to write his <span class="italic">Life of Donne</span> from scratch), the result was remarkable. As a layman, Walton had a real problem of authorial voice in constructing a preface to a clerical biography, where an exemplary intention would have gained firepower from clerical authorship. Whence came Walton's power to edify? Walton adopted a modest position, stressing the condescension involved in Donne's intimacy with him (a condescension implicit also to a lesser degree on the part of other clerical members of his coterie) and promising a life which was necessarily honest in lacking &#145;skill to deceive&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lives</span>, ed. Saintsbury, 21). The emphasis on author&#150;subject intimacy not only formed a pattern for Walton's later biographies, but also influenced the modern stress on particularity and intimacy in the genre. Walton also made so extensive a use of Donne's own written work that it is hardly an exaggeration to describe the <span class="italic">Life</span> as a patchwork sewn almost entirely from Donne's words, artfully juxtaposed and paraphrased to highlight the side of Donne most apparent after his ordination in 1615. This selectivity reflected both the context of religious controversy in which the 1640 volume was conceived and Walton's sense of the clerical Donne's exemplary importance; the slant this gave to his portrait took insufficient account of his early career and was unfair to Donne's secular interests. Yet the Donne that Walton paints is both passionate and changeable, figured in the prominent use of St Augustine in its typology; the portrait is of a performer in pulpit and deathbed, given to mood swings which Walton's creative editing of his letters rather deepens than smoothes. The &#145;Character&#146; with which Walton concludes the <span class="italic">Life</span> is perhaps his finest piece of writing; and made finer in its sensitive counterpoint with sources in Donne's own work.<h2>
<a name="CivilwarinterregnumandTheCompleatAngler"></a>Civil war, interregnum, and The Compleat Angler</h2>Walton's sympathy for the Laudian ecclesiastical programme was translated from 1642 into support for the king; he proved an unwavering royalist. He was one of several linen drapers, and several parishioners of St Dunstan-in-the-West, who signed the London petitions for peace of 14 and 22 December 1642. Since his last child, Anne, had died on 11 May 1642, his house in Chancery Lane was empty and he probably left in 1643, though he may not at this point have left London altogether. Wood thinks he spent the 1640s and 1650s travelling, staying with &#145;eminent Clergymen&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.264&#150;5), but Walton's own attestation in his <span class="italic">Life of Sanderson</span> (1678) is that he was at least part of the time in London, and he says that he was there for Laud's execution in January 1645. Other evidence bears this out. Walton is likely to have written the preface for Francis Quarles's <span class="italic">Shepheards Oracles</span> (1646), signed by John Marriot on 9 November 1645 and issued by the Marriots from their shop in St Dunstan's churchyard. It was at St James's, Clerkenwell, that on 23 April 1647 Walton married, second, Anne (1610&#150;1662), daughter of Thomas Ken (<i>d</i>. 1651), an attorney of Furnivall's Inn, London, and half-sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15342/', "Thomas Ken (1637&#150;1711)")</script>, who lived with the couple after Thomas senior's death. Izaak and Anne had three children: Anne, born on 11 March 1648; Izaak, born on 10 February 1650, who died in infancy; and another <a name="cosubject_28652"></a><span class="headword">Izaak Walton</span>  (1651&#150;1719), who became a <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, born in Clerkenwell on 7 September 1651. Later that year Walton left London briefly for the one adventure of his life&#151;to fetch the garter jewel, the &#145;lesser George&#146; lost at the battle of Worcester (3 September), and deliver it to Colonel Thomas Blagge, imprisoned in the City of London. The Waltons are likely to have lived in Clerkenwell until about 1655.<br>
<br>Walton's complimentary verses prefaced another Marriot publication, Edward Sparke's <span class="italic">Scintillula altaris</span>, in 1652, and, in spite of the handicap which his political sympathies might have been expected to impose upon his publications, his writing career was beginning, in his sixties, to take off. In 1651 the second of his biographies, <span class="italic">The Life of Sir Henry Wotton</span>, appeared, again as a preface, this time to <span class="italic">Reliquiae Wottonianae</span> (though the entry of the <span class="italic">Reliquiae</span> in the Stationers' register in 1648 suggests that it was written some years earlier). This is a genial memorial which stresses their shared love for Donne and for angling; more secular in its subject than any of Walton's other biographies, it nevertheless uses Wotton's ordination as deacon (on becoming provost of Eton College) as a conversion point not unlike Donne's ordination, and depicts an orderly life whose &#145;Circumference&#146; was &#145;closed up&#146; by a serene and exemplary death  (<span class="italic">Lives</span>, ed. Saintsbury, 150&#150;51). Four more editions of his <span class="italic">Life of Sir Henry Wotton</span> appeared in Walton's lifetime: in 1654, 1670, 1672, and 1675; as was Walton's invariable practice, it too was considerably expanded and revised in the process of reissue.<br>
<br>Walton's lives of Wotton and of Donne were rather differently refracted in his third and most enduring (though not, in his lifetime, his most esteemed) work: <span class="italic">The Compleat Angler</span> (1653). The fishing manual, which has gone through more than 400 editions since its publication in that difficult year, is suggestively but not sufficiently characterized by its epigraph from <span class="roman">I Thessalonians</span>: &#145;Study to be quiet.&#146; Like the pastoral tradition of which it was a part, Walton's <span class="italic">Angler</span> reflected on a fractured world by celebrating (and recommending) an order characterized as both &#145;natural&#146; and vulnerable. In a manner reminiscent of other poets of the Commonwealth, such as Robert Herrick in his <span class="italic">Hesperides</span> (1648) or Andrew Marvell in his &#145;Upon Appleton House&#146; of the early 1650s, the disorder of the present times received muted comment in the work's scenes of harmony. Similarly, Donne's love of church music was to receive, in Walton's revised <span class="italic">Life of Donne</span> in 1658, the gloss (dated 1656) &#145;but now, O Lord, how is that place become desolate&#146;; and Wotton's &#145;surplice&#146;, in 1651 a forbidden item, was in Walton's <span class="italic">Life of Wotton</span> offered as a potent sign of holy employments. The abolition in 1649 of regular Wednesday fast-days, on which one might eat exclusively fish and &#145;sallets&#146;, is deplored in the <span class="italic">Angler</span> as bad for the health both of soul and body (though they were replaced by frequent occasional fast-days). Walton used an abundance of sources, ancient and modern, for the &#145;facts&#146; of fish and fishing, from Pliny and Gesner to Topsel and Bacon; and he quoted from George Herbert, Donne, and Michael Drayton, who all died in the early 1630s but might have been expected to support his political views, and from Herbert's imitator Christopher Harvey, still very much alive, who did.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Compleat Angler</span> was conceived as dialogue between men travelling on foot who each represented a different recreation. In the first edition there were two, Piscator (fisherman) and Viator (traveller); in the second and much expanded edition of 1655 the two had become three: Viator was now Venator (hunter), and Auceps (falconer) was added. By this means the art of fishing was introduced, defended, and expounded: its strong precedent in the fishermen apostles of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> was established, the detail of baiting for, catching, and cooking different kinds of fish was catalogued, and the whole was accompanied by aphorisms which would show the reader what it might mean to live well. Walton's conservative message was not lost on one reader, Richard Franck, who in his own book <span class="italic">Northern Memoirs</span> (1694) attacked Walton for historical and technical inaccuracy. Franck fished for Scottish salmon, not Staffordshire trout, and had served under Cromwell, so it is hardly surprising that in their only meeting Walton &#145;huffed away&#146;  (Franck, 1821, 10.175). Walton revised the <span class="italic">Compleat Angler</span> four times in his lifetime: in 1655, 1661 (with a second issue in 1664), 1668, and 1676. Its last edition was so much expanded from the first as to constitute almost a different text.<br>
<br>Alongside his larger projects, Walton also wrote smaller pieces. From this period comes his manuscript commemorative couplet for the puritan conformist preacher Richard Sibbes, written in the 1650 edition of the latter's <span class="italic">Returning Backslider</span>, and his preface for <span class="italic">Heroe of Lorenzo</span> (1652), Sir John Skeffington's translation of Baltasar Gracian y Morales's exemplary study of aristocratic (and monarchical) virtue. As well as this, Walton's <span class="italic">Life of Donne</span> (1658) was published alone (perhaps only because he no longer had access to the copyrights of the sermons) and was revised accordingly. At the same time he began to take notes for a projected life of Richard Hooker at the back of his copy of Eusebius.<h2>
<a name="RestorationandLifeofHooker"></a>Restoration and Life of Hooker</h2>Walton celebrated the Restoration (and his own return to London) with a celebratory eclogue, &#145;Daman and Dorus&#146;, a conventional pastoral dialogue in praise of Charles II, printed in Alexander Brome's <span class="italic">Songs and Other Poems</span> (1661). In the same year he provided verses for Christopher Harvey's <span class="italic">The Synagogue</span> and joined, belatedly, the flurry of elegists for the conservative William Cartwright (<i>d</i>. 1643). Much later, in 1676, he wrote dedicatory verses for Cartwright's nephew Jeremiah Rich, promoter of Cartwright's shorthand system.<br>
<br>Walton received a Restoration reward of his own, indirectly, through the translation of his friend George Morley, then bishop of Worcester, to the see of Winchester in 1661. Walton seems to have had some connection (how much is not clear) with several former members of the Great Tew circle, and most intimately with Morley, who made Walton his steward. Walton accordingly moved with Morley. His wife, Anne, died in Worcester on 17 April 1662; she was buried in Worcester Cathedral and was touchingly commemorated by her husband  (<span class="italic">Selected Writings of Izaak Walton</span>, ed. J. Martin, 1997, 163&#150;4). In 1665 their daughter, Anne, married one of the cathedral prebendaries, William Hawkins, also rector of Droxford in Hampshire. The same year Thomas Ken moved to Winchester as Morley's chaplain. Morley, together with the then bishop of London, Gilbert Sheldon, was also the instigator of Walton's next project. This was his <span class="italic">Life of Mr. R. Hooker</span>, which appeared first alone in 1665, and then in 1666 as a biographical preface to Hooker's <span class="italic">Works</span>. Morley and Sheldon more or less commissioned Walton, as a known loyalist, to provide a suitably conservative biographical gloss on Hooker's work which would undo the damage (as they saw it) done by the Restoration edition of Hooker prefaced by the moderate bishop of Exeter, John Gauden. Gauden had edited a copy of Hooker's <span class="italic">Works</span> in 1661/2 which issued all eight books of the latter's <span class="italic">Lawes of Ecclesiastical Politie</span>: that is to say, it added books 6 and 8 (first published in 1648 by James Ussher) and book 7, which had never yet been published. These last three were unrevised and contentious texts, and book 8 put the cat firmly among the pigeons by discussing the rights of the monarch in terms which were by no means exclusively predicated on divine right. To make things worse, Gauden's prolix biography (which also, incidentally, made Hooker sound extraordinarily dreary) had made his own moderate views rather too plain. Walton's brief was to discredit Gauden's version and the provenance of the disputed Hookerian books; he was offered the lease of a house in Paternoster Row at the same time.<br>
<br>Walton had an indirect connection with Hooker through his first wife. George Cranmer, Rachel Walton's maternal uncle, had been Hooker's friend, and her maternal aunt Dorothy Cranmer married Hooker's executor, John Spenser, president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Walton took on the task (and the lease) as offered, and wrote a biography which characterized Hooker as a figure like John the Baptist who prophesied the &#145;unity&#146; of the Restoration from his vantage point in the 1590s. Walton chose not to &#145;engage&#146; himself in the episcopal squabbles directly and put all his evidence about the &#145;doubtfull Books&#146; into appendices signed by senior clergymen  (<span class="italic">Lives</span>, ed. Saintsbury, 236). The backdrop against which this was drawn was a highly biased parallel picture of the squabbles of the 1580s and 1590s, seen through a filter defined by the civil wars, and characterized by the debates on conformity between Archbishop John Whitgift and Thomas Cartwright. Notwithstanding, in writing on Hooker, whom he had never known, Walton reached for authoritative narration by making extensive use of his family connection with the Cranmers, which forced him to treat the oral information he received from them somewhat trustingly. In the circumstances this was a pity, not least for the memory of Mistress Hooker; the estate was in litigation, and the information Walton received, and famously recorded, on Joan Hooker's shrewishness was given by witnesses who had every reason for prejudice. However, it formed an essential part of another pastoral scene, where Hooker read Horace's <span class="italic">Odes</span> while he minded the sheep in his benefice or was forced to &#145;rock the Cradle&#146; of his firstborn. This, and the picture Walton drew of Hooker's obscure and peaceable round of pastoral duty while writing the <span class="italic">Lawes of Ecclesiastical Politie</span> in his last parish of Bishopsborne, drew for the first time the &#145;heat-pimpled&#146; face of the Church of England rural parson in what was to become a highly recognizable clerical mixture of personal asceticism, distrust for emotional extremes, a love of hierarchical order, and passionless masculinity. In this book one critic claims Walton &#145;invented Anglicanism&#146;  (Lake, 229&#150;30); certainly it did more than any of Hooker's own works to establish Hooker as the primary representative of the &#145;Anglican&#146; <i>via media</i>.<h2>
<a name="LaterLives"></a>Later Lives</h2>This commissioned biography by Walton was followed in 1670 by a &#145;free-will offering&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lives</span>, ed. Saintsbury, 6), the <span class="italic">Life of Mr George Herbert</span>. It appeared first as a flyer, not for an edition of Herbert's works but for a collected edition in the same year of the four lives Walton had so far written, which sufficiently indicates, perhaps, not only the extent to which Walton had become established as a biographer but also the new dignity which was being accorded to the genre. His life of Herbert again dealt with someone Walton had not known but &#145;only seen&#146;  (ibid., 259), but their mutual intimacy with Wotton and Donne, and Walton's readiness to &#145;know&#146; his subjects through their writings, made him less troubled by the task than he had been in his life of Hooker. The <span class="italic">Life of Herbert</span>, too, is a tissue of paraphrase and quotation, more Herbert than Walton&#151;except that every word is deployed to insist upon the essential nobility of the priesthood (particularly the country priesthood) as a vocation, and the events are transformed and marked by edifices (the churches Herbert is narrated as restoring, for example) which underscore Walton's belief in the beauty of holiness and transform Herbert's own book of precept, <span class="italic">The Country Parson</span>, into &#145;factual&#146; example, and his poetry into an untroubled version of a spiritual autobiography.<br>
<br>Walton's <span class="italic">Lives</span>&#151;of Donne, Wotton, Hooker, and Herbert&#151;was reissued in 1675 with further revisions and expansions: Donne's vision of the death of his wife, for instance, was added at this time. In 1676 Walton published his fifth and final edition of the <span class="italic">Angler</span>, under the title <span class="italic">The Universal Angler</span>. This included a section by Charles Cotton on trout fishing which paid touching tribute to their relationship: &#145;he gives me leave&#146;, wrote Cotton, &#145;to call him Father, and I hope is not yet ashamed to own me for his adopted Son&#146;  (I. Walton, <span class="italic">Universal Angler</span>, pt 2, [x]). Walton also made some notes for a life of John Hales, another of the Great Tew circle&#151;not, apparently, intending to write them up himself (he was, after all, over eighty by this time) but collecting them for another writer; and he produced an anonymous piece of polemic, <span class="italic">Love and Truth</span> (1680), which in its anxious insistence on lay obedience echoed with some precision the concerns of his life of Hooker.<br>
<br>Finally, somewhat against his will, Walton was persuaded by Morley into his last considerable work, <span class="italic">The Life of Dr Sanderson</span>. A fascinating figure, Robert Sanderson was a stern Calvinist yet an eminent casuist. He had been chaplain to Charles I, yet was also in 1627 the last preacher on predestination at Paul's Cross before the subject was proscribed, and had been invited to join the Westminster assembly (an honour he declined). He was made bishop of Lincoln at the Restoration, in the first flurry of moderate appointments; yet he found it extraordinarily difficult to come to terms with the predominantly Arminian temper of his Restoration colleagues. Walton had known Sanderson personally, and this <span class="italic">Life</span> is the only one in which Walton appears in the narrative. However, the Sanderson presented by Walton shows no trace of Sanderson's distinguishing Calvinism; instead Walton concentrates on the preservation of ceremonies and liturgy, to which the bishop was also committed. As <span class="italic">Hooker</span> prefigured the &#145;unity&#146; of 1660, so arguably <span class="italic">Sanderson</span>, which narrated the events of the civil wars and Commonwealth, was intended as a warning against potential religious and political dissent. The most involved of the biographies, and showing some small signs of age (for instance, Walton began to get his scriptural allusions a little muddled), it nevertheless made particularly sensitive and ingenious use of its subject's prose. It appeared in 1678, the year that the exclusion crisis erupted and that Walton's son Izaak (who had matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, in 1668, graduated BA in 1672, and proceeded MA in 1676) was made domestic chaplain to the bishop of Salisbury, Seth Ward. Walton's biography supposedly prefaced works by Sanderson; but in fact the main &#145;work&#146; it headed was a digest of different fragments, and the <span class="italic">Life</span> emerged as the central point of the edition. A revised version was published in 1681 (one of Walton's last pieces of work), prefacing the &#145;eighth edition&#146; of Sanderson's <span class="italic">Thirty Five Sermons</span>.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsandreputation"></a>Last years and reputation</h2>By this time Walton was probably living with his daughter and son-in-law in Droxford. Approaching ninety, he was still writing. His letter to John Aubrey on Ben Jonson was composed in 1680, and in 1683, the year of his death, he wrote the preface to a verse pastoral, <span class="italic">Thealma and Clearchus</span>, attributed to John Chalkhill. His will, a humane and readable document, is dated 9 August of that year, but it was on 24 October that Walton signed and sealed it with the bloodstone seal left to him by John Donne. Walton died in Winchester, on 15 December 1683, when the weather was exceptionally cold, and was buried in the cathedral's Silkstede Chapel. He was survived by his daughter, who died in 1715, and son Izaak, who after a successful clerical career in the diocese of Salisbury died unmarried in London on 29 December 1719 and was buried in Salisbury Cathedral.<br>
<br>In the course of his long life (he was born, after all, before Shakespeare had really got into his stride) Walton produced a work&#151;<span class="italic">The Compleat Angler</span>&#151;which has commanded huge popularity: it has been reprinted almost as many times as <span class="italic">A Pilgrim's Progress</span>. Yet for biography, arguably, he performed a yet greater service. His unique combination of intimacy and edification formed a model highly influential on James Boswell and Samuel Johnson; and this makes him, perhaps, modern biography's father. Though he has been censured for his inaccuracy (and he was inaccurate) and for his bias (for which Dr Johnson's own judgement of him as a &#145;great panegyrist&#146; is perhaps a fairer characterization), and though he was regarded by many as a na&iuml;ve and thus, in a sense, accidentally effective writer, nevertheless his skill is at last receiving the recognition it deserves.<br>
