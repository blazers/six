<span class="headword">Ashmore,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1621), <span class="occ">translator and poet</span>, was probably a native of the area near Ripon in Yorkshire (to which his poems repeatedly refer), but his life appears obscure. There are no records of his attending university. He was the first to publish a selection of Horace's odes in English translation, in a work entitled <span class="italic">Certain Selected Odes of Horace, Englished</span> (1621). In twenty-eight pages he translates seventeen odes, starting with i.1, and ending with iii.30, but otherwise avoiding Horace's ordering. One ode, iii.9, is translated three times, the third time &#145;paulo fusius&#146; (&#145;a little more loosely&#146;; <span class="italic">Odes</span>, trans. Ashmore, 16). All translations are Ashmore's own, except ii.3 which &#145;came into my hands under the name of Mr <i>Ben Iohnson</i>&#146;  (ibid., 22) (an &#145;improbable&#146; attribution according to Carne-Ross and Haynes although some Jonson scholars have been less sceptical  (Carne-Ross and Haynes, 77)). There follow fifty pages of epigrams, epitaphs, anagrams, &#145;And other Poems of divers subjects; in <i>Latine and English</i>&#146;; finally Ashmore offers a set of poems in praise of country life, translated from Martial, Virgil, and the neo-Latin author Flaminio  (<span class="italic">Odes</span>, trans. Ashmore, 29). Among the liminary verses praising Ashmore's achievement is a pair of elegiac couplets by John Owen, the well-known Latin poet; Ashmore reciprocates with two poems addressed to Owen, and also praises Ben Jonson. Samuel Pullein's commendatory verses claim that Ashmore would be another Horace, if he could have another Maecenas as patron; as it is, &#145;forma eadem est, ingeniique genus&#146; (&#145;you have the same appearance, and type of intellect&#146;; ibid., sig. [A] 4<i>r</i>). Ashmore's own Latin and English dedication of the translation to Toby Matthew, archbishop of York, suggests a robust attitude to potential detractors: he does not fear<blockquote>
<div class="indent">spitefull Gibes,<br>
</div>
<div>Nor crabbed Criticks, nor Grammarian Tribes.<br>
</div> (ibid., sig. [A]3<i>v</i>)</blockquote>The rest of the book he dedicates to George Calvert, secretary of state and Yorkshire MP.<br>
<br>Ashmore was probably present at James I's visit to Ripon on 15 April 1617, as the work also includes verses he composed to be recited &#145;<i>In the Person of</i> Mercurie&#146;, and others to be presented to the king  (<span class="italic">Odes</span>, trans. Ashmore, 33). His poems address many other persons of national or local importance; the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> found his puns vile, but they may have been more attractive to Renaissance tastes. Ashmore writes wittily to Sir Edward Mosley in &#145;On Nothing&#146;, a subject also found in <span class="italic">Nemo</span> (1617) by the contemporary Latinist John Leech. Local clergymen, and members of the Fairfax and Mallory families, appear prominently in Ashmore's verses; he includes a dialogue between the two rivers at Ripon. One poem, &#145;De seipso&#146; (&#145;On himself&#146;), may be of biographical interest:<blockquote>
<div>
<i>Surety</i>, what's that? I to my loss have try'd,<br>
</div>
<div>Who for anothers Debt too <i>Sure</i> am <i>Ty'd</i>:<br>
</div>
<div>If this I had Etymologiz'd before,<br>
</div>
<div>I never had been shut within this doore.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Odes</span>, trans. Ashmore, 78)</blockquote>It is uncertain whether he merely enjoyed the punning etymology, or had actually suffered imprisonment as a result of imprudent generosity.Ashmore's work may usefully be compared with the next attempt to translate Horace, in <span class="italic">Odes of Horace</span> (1625), by Sir Thomas Hawkins. Hawkins may have taken inspiration from Ashmore's recent version, and also sought to outdo it, both in number of odes and moral standards. Hawkins's claim that he &#145;had rather teach Vertue to the modest, th[a]n discover Vice to the dissolute &hellip; [and not] take unhappy draughts, from the troubled and muddy waters of <i>Sensuality</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Odes</span>, trans. Hawkins, 38) suggests he may have been thinking of the more dangerous side of Horace that Ashmore had dared to reveal. Hawkins admits the &#145;lesse morall&#146; ninth ode of book three with reluctance, and only &#145;for <i>Iul. Scaliger's</i> sake, who much admireth it&#146;  (ibid.), while Ashmore approaches it with gusto:<blockquote>
<div>In Fortunes lap, who then, but I,<br>
</div>
<div>By <i>Venus</i> luld-asleep did lie?<br>
</div>(<span class="italic">Odes</span>, trans. Ashmore, 17: from the third, looser version)</blockquote>Ashmore displays a variety of metrical forms, choosing short lyric lines for some odes; he also prefaces each ode with a neat verse &#145;argument&#146;. Ashmore makes a bold stab at the Pyrrha ode (i.5), his translation being certainly more passionate and arguably more successful than Milton's later attempt: in the notoriously difficult final stanza Ashmore's &#145;doublet wringing wet, and cod-piec't breeches&#146;  (ibid., 11) is a more vigorous expression than the &#145;dropping weeds&#146; favoured by Milton and others.<br>
