<span class="headword">Davies,  Thomas Stephens</span>  (1794?&#150;1851), <span class="occ">mathematician</span>, was probably born in 1794, but little else about his early life is known. A formative influence was the mathematician William Trail (1745&#150;1831), best known for his <span class="italic">Account of the Life and Writings of Robert Simson</span> (1812). It was Trail who instilled in Davies a lifelong fascination for geometry and a profound interest in its history. Davies began his career as a schoolmaster in Bath. His first scientific communications were published in the <span class="italic">Leeds Correspondent</span> in July 1817, and the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Diary</span> for 1819, and he subsequently contributed largely to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's and Lady's Diary</span>, to Clay's <span class="italic">Scientific Receptacle</span>, and to the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">Bath and Bristol Magazine</span>, and the <span class="italic">Mechanics' Magazine</span>. These papers earned him a considerable reputation as a mathematician and scientific writer. He became a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1831, and contributed several original and elaborate papers to its <span class="italic">Transactions</span>. That on the &#145;Geometrical character of the hour-lines upon the antique sun-dials&#146;  (<span class="italic">Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh</span>, 12, 1832, 77&#150;122) led to the discussion of the &#145;Equations of loci traced upon the surface of the sphere&#146;  (ibid., 259&#150;362; 379&#150;428) and the development of a new system of spherical geometry, by means of spherical co-ordinates. This system, more general than its predecessors, deserves more recognition than it has subsequently received. Further research on this subject was published as a supplement to John Radford Young's <span class="italic">Elements of Plane and Spherical Trigonometry</span> in 1833. On 18 April that year, Davies was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London, and served on that body's mathematical committee until 1844.<br>
<br>Davies's principal area of research was geometry, in which he exhibited equal skill in both ancient and modern methods and acquired a reputation as &#145;the first of British geometers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>, 55, 1851, 83). Among the numerous subjects which engaged his attention were the properties of the trapezium, Pascal's <i>hexagramme mystique</i>, Brianchon's theorem, symmetrical properties of plane triangles, the geometry of three dimensions, and stereographic projection. However, he also wrote on many other areas of science and literature, contributing papers on the &#145;Phenomena of terrestrial magnetism&#146; to the Royal Society's <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> (1835, 1836) and on &#145;Determination of the law of resistance to a projectile&#146; to the <span class="italic">Mechanics' Magazine</span>, as well as many other papers in the <span class="italic">Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal</span>, the <span class="italic">Civil Engineer</span>, <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>, and <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>. Many such contributions were anonymous or published under a pseudonym such as &#145;Pen-and-Ink&#146;, &#145;Peter Twaddleton&#146;, or &#145;Knickerbocker&#146;. He also edited, with William Rutherford and Stephen Fenwick, the first volume of <span class="italic">The Mathematician</span> (1845).<br>
<br>In 1834 Davies was appointed one of the mathematical masters in the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. While there, he helped to publish several useful textbooks for the use of its students. The eleventh edition of Charles Hutton's <span class="italic">Course of Mathematics</span> (1837) was principally Davies's work. In 1840 he produced <span class="italic">Solutions of the Principal Questions in Dr Hutton's &#145;Course of Mathematics&#146;</span>, containing 4000 solutions to problems in nearly all mathematical subjects and at every degree of difficulty. Next appeared the twelfth edition of Hutton's <span class="italic">Course</span> (2 vols., 1841&#150;3) &#145;with considerable alterations and additions&#146; by Davies&#151;so considerable, in fact, that it contained &#145;not a single line of the original work&#146;. Finally, his geometrical part of <span class="italic">An Elementary Course of Mathematics Prepared for the Use of the Royal Military Academy</span> was published as volume 2 in 1852.<br>
<br>Davies's deep interest in the history of geometry led to his election as a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 19 March 1840. He was also a council member of the short-lived Historical Society of Science, founded by James Orchard Halliwell in 1840. The last six years of his life were plagued by bronchitis. His death, following an attack of influenza, took place at his home, Broomhall Cottage, Shooter's Hill, Kent, on 6 January 1851, when he was in his fifty-seventh year.<br>
