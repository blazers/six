<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mitford,  Jessica Lucy  Freeman-</span>  (1917&#150;1996), <span class="occ">writer and journalist</span>, was born on 11 September 1917 at Asthall Manor, Oxfordshire, the fifth of six daughters and sixth of seven children of David Bertram Ogilvy Freeman-Mitford, second Baron Redesdale of the second creation (1878&#150;1958), soldier and landowner, and his wife Sydney (1880&#150;1963), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32005/', "Thomas Gibson Bowles")</script>, magazine proprietor (the founder of <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> and <span class="italic">The Lady</span>) and MP. Although she lived for much of her adult life as a self-proclaimed communist in California, she never lost the voice and mannerisms of her privileged English background. Her sympathies were always with the outsider and the underdog, but she disliked earnestness and displays of emotion, preferring jokes and teasing. Her childhood was spent at Swinbrook, also in Oxfordshire, in a large and ugly house built by her father, with occasional visits to London where he kept an establishment in Rutland Gate. Her own memoir, <span class="italic">Hons and Rebels</span> (1960), and the novel by her elder sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31450/', "Nancy Mitford")</script>, <span class="italic">The Pursuit of Love</span> (1945), depicted the family life of the Mitfords as a series of comic but unnerving episodes, dominated by their father's frequent fits of rage and irrational prejudices, which led him to attack:<blockquote>not only Huns, Frogs, Americans, blacks, and all other foreigners, but also other people's children, the majority of my older sister's acquaintances, almost all young men&#151;in fact the whole teeming population of the earth's surface, except for some, though not all, of our relations and a very few tweeded, redfaced country neighbours. (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 25 July 1996)</blockquote>As a child, Jessica (or Decca, as she was usually called by friends and family) longed to go to school; but her parents, following upper-class conventions of the time, saw no need for girls to be educated outside the home.<br>
<br>The restrictions of her upbringing produced in Jessica Mitford unusual determination and independence of mind. By the time she was twelve she had opened a &#145;running away account&#146; at Drummonds Bank; by the time she was eighteen she had decided she was a Marxist and had taken out a subscription to the communist newspaper the <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span>. While she was an admirer of Joseph Stalin, her sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58824/', "Unity Mitford")</script> had become a devotee of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis; their political posturings may have started as a game but soon grew deeply serious. Although her sister Nancy had socialist sympathies for a time, both their parents, their brother Tom, and their sister Diana [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/92691/', "Mosley, Diana (1910&#150;2003)")</script>] as well as Unity supported fascism.<br>
<br>In 1937 Jessica Mitford met and fell in love with her second cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60277/', "Esmond Marcus David Romilly (1918&#150;1941)")</script>, younger son of Colonel Bertram Henry Samuel Romilly, and a nephew of Winston Churchill. Romilly was also in open rebellion against his background. After running away from school and founding a subversive magazine he had joined the International Brigades and fought for the republicans against Franco in the Spanish Civil War. When he returned to Spain, Jessica Mitford laid a false trail for her parents and went with him, and despite every effort by her family to dissuade her they were married by the British consul in Bayonne, France, on 18 May 1937. She never saw her father again. On their return to England they joined the Labour Party and moved to Bermondsey in the East End of London; they had a daughter, Julia, who died of measles at the age of four months. At first, like many of their left-wing contemporaries, the Romillys regarded the prospect of war between Britain and Germany as irrelevant to the revolutionary struggle and left for the United States in February 1939. When the Second World War began in September, they were further confused by the fact that since the Nazi&#150;Soviet pact the previous month Russia and Germany were allies; but Germany's attack on Russia in 1941, as Jessica Mitford put it, &#145;changed everything overnight&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Fine Old Conflict</span>, 29). Leaving his wife and baby daughter (Anne) Constancia (born in 1941 and named after a heroine of the Spanish Civil War) living in Virginia with friends, Esmond Romilly joined the Canadian air force. He was killed during a bombing raid on Hamburg in November 1941.<br>
<br>According to her own account of her political life, <span class="italic">A Fine Old Conflict</span> (1977), Jessica Mitford joined the Communist Party in America after her first husband's death. She moved to Washington, DC, and found work with the office of price administration, where she met Robert Edward Treuhaft (1912&#150;2001), a Harvard-educated lawyer of Hungarian-Jewish extraction, son of Albin Treuhaft, of New York. They married on 8 June 1943, and Jessica Mitford took American citizenship in 1944. Despite their very different backgrounds, Bob Treuhaft and Decca Mitford had the same political opinions and the same subversive sense of humour. They settled in Oakland, California, near San Francisco and close to the Berkeley campus of the University of California, where their agreeable but modest suburban house became a haven for the next four decades for radicals and protesters and campaigners against racial and social injustice. They had two sons: Nicholas, born in 1944, and Benjamin, born in 1947. In 1955 Nicholas was killed in a traffic accident. Jessica Mitford preferred never to mention the loss of two of her children.<br>
<br>Although she worked hard for the Communist Party during the 1940s and 1950s, attending meetings and study groups and campaigning with particular courage and conviction against racial discrimination, Jessica Mitford was too anarchic and individualistic by nature to take kindly to party discipline. She always liked breaking rules and had an instinctive distaste for jargon; in 1956, after her sister Nancy Mitford had invented U (for upper class) and non-U language, Jessica promptly produced a parallel investigation &#145;into current L (or Left Wing Usage)&#146;  (Mitford, <span class="italic">A Fine Old Conflict</span>, 254). In 1958 she and her husband both resigned from the party, feeling that they could pursue their ideals more effectively outside. Later, she admitted that the party had made mistakes but she would never attack it or the former Soviet Union directly, nor would she apologize for her own allegiance to it.<br>
<br>Jessica Mitford's book about her background and how she escaped from it, published in 1960 as <span class="italic">Hons and Rebels</span> in the UK and as <span class="italic">Daughters and Rebels</span> in the USA, began in 1957 as a short introduction to a proposed collection (never published) of her first husband's letters. It was written, she explained, as &#145;a thoroughly collective endeavour&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Fine Old Conflict</span>, 222): a group of friends, as well as Bob Treuhaft, formed a book committee to advise and encourage her. It was initially turned down by several American publishers, but it was widely praised when it came out in 1960 as an affectionate, if mocking, picture of her eccentric family, although her estranged sister Lady Mosley described it in print as &#145;supremely unpleasant&#146;  (ibid., 230). Jessica Mitford was more concerned about the reaction of her former Communist Party colleagues; to her slight surprise, they were in favour. Even so, she acknowledged that she would probably not have become a writer had she stayed in the party, &#145;since members were somewhat circumscribed by Party discipline in their choice of occupations&#146;  (ibid., 231). The good reception of this first book launched Jessica Mitford on her successful career as a writer and journalist. At Bob Treuhaft's instigation and with his collaboration, she wrote a macabre and satirical expos&eacute; of the funeral business, <span class="italic">The American Way of Death</span> (1963), which became a best-seller and established her as a witty and effective critic of her adopted society. Subsequent books included <span class="italic">The Trial of Dr Spock</span> (1969), <span class="italic">The American Prison Business</span> (1975), and a collection of her journalism, <span class="italic">Poison Penmanship: the Gentle Art of Muckraking</span> (1979).<br>
<br>From the late 1950s Jessica Mitford made regular visits to England, where she would rent a London base and entertain her left-wing friends and selected relations&#151;the breach with her sister Lady Mosley was never healed&#151;over martinis and Bob Treuhaft's speciality, Boston baked beans. She would then repair to Chatsworth to visit her sister Deborah (Debo), the duchess of Devonshire. But if she retained many ties with and much affection for England, there was never any doubt that California was her home. With her pretty round face, large, deceptively innocent blue eyes, and precise, slightly languid voice she continued to reveal her origins, but her tough professionalism and her unwavering support for radical causes set her apart from the society she had left behind. In 1984 she published <span class="italic">Faces of Philip</span>, a memoir of her old friend the writer and critic Philip Toynbee, followed in 1984 by a short life of Grace Darling and in 1992 by <span class="italic">The American Way of Birth</span>. She became much in demand as a lecturer at American colleges, where she would always encourage the young to stir up trouble, and she also turned out to be a natural television performer, with her quick wit and deadpan humour.<br>
<br>When she became ill, Jessica Mitford was working on a new edition of <span class="italic">The American Way of Death</span>, an irony that did not escape her. She died of cancer in Oakland, California, on 23 July 1996, and was cremated in San Francisco, her ashes being scattered at sea. She was survived by her husband Bob Treuhaft, her daughter Constancia, and her son Benjamin. Her new edition of <span class="italic">The American Way of Death</span> was completed by her husband and published in 1997.<br>
