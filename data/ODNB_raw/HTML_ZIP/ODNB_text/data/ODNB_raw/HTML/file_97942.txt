<span class="headword">Orde, Sir  Julian Walter</span>  (1861&#150;1929), <span class="occ">secretary and general manager of the Royal Automobile Club (RAC)</span>, was born at Hopton House, Hopton, Suffolk, on 14 January 1861, the third of the seven children of James Henry Orde (1830/31&#150;1880), a partner in Gurneys, Birkbeck, Brightwen, and Orde Bank (subsumed by Barclays in 1896), and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gurney. He attended Haileybury College (1874&#150;5), and then spent time travelling on the continent. On his return home he joined the Great Yarmouth branch of Gurneys as a clerk. He married at Baldock, Hertfordshire, on 7 July 1885, Alice Georgiana Archdale (1861&#150;1945), the second of the eight children of Frederick Archdale (formerly Hogge), banker, brewer, and merchant. They had five children.<br>
<br>Orde disliked banking and for a period ranched in the United States at Sibley, Iowa. After he returned permanently to England &#145;he became interested in political and other organisations&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 20 June 1929) and worked as a &#145;merchant&#146; in the City of London  (<span class="italic">Haileybury Register</span>). In 1903, through the influence of his friend the motoring promoter John Montagu (later Lord Montagu of Beaulieu), he was appointed secretary to the Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland (RAC from 1907). He held the post for twenty years and remains the club's longest-serving secretary. At first Orde was one of three in day-to-day control of club affairs, the others being William Rees Jeffreys, in charge of administration, and Basil Joy, responsible for technical matters. But Orde was &#145;first among equals&#146;  (Brendon, 100). In 1904, after <span class="italic">Autocar</span> lamented the club's lack of a &#145;managing director&#146; or &#145;master brain&#146;, Orde became sole secretary  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Orde was an effective organizer and administrator. He oversaw the RAC's transfer from its cramped clubhouse on Piccadilly to opulent new headquarters on Pall Mall (opened 1911) and, in 1913, its acquisition of an extensive country property at Woodcote Park, near Epsom, Surrey. In both locations full members of the club could enjoy the high life or, as some saw it, indulge in &#145;sloth and luxury&#146;. In contrast associate members were treated as something like second-class citizens  (Brendon, 152&#150;3, 180, 184).<br>
<br>Orde, who enjoyed motoring from its earliest days, had a particular interest in motor sport. He accompanied Montagu and Charles Rolls as an &#145;obligatory passenger&#146; when they competed in the 1899 Paris to Ostend race  (Tritton, 58). He assisted in creating Brooklands motor-racing track, was a committee member of Brooklands Automobile Racing Club (1906&#150;29), and often served as a steward on race days. He helped organize and promote many motor races and trials including the Gordon Bennett race in Ireland (1903), Isle of Man Gordon Bennett trials (1904), Scottish reliability trials (1906), and Isle of Man tourist trophy (TT) races, where he was a &#145;ubiquitous and omnicompetent presence&#146; as late as 1922 (Brendon, 116; <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, 25 June 1922).<br>
<br>Orde initiated the RAC's &#145;get you home&#146; scheme whereby the club guaranteed to get stranded members and associates home at its expense. The scheme was a &#145;masterstroke&#146; that provided motorists with a valuable and unique service  (Brendon, 156). Since the Automobile Association (AA) declined to emulate it, the club long held a significant membership attraction over its main rival.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Orde faced several challenges. In 1915 the RAC banned as members or guests anyone with enemy alien connections. Orde justified the decision on grounds that it was in line with public opinion and would prevent friction. Falling membership led to financial difficulties which were met by axing the club's <span class="italic">Journal</span> and opening up full membership to less exclusive sections of society, even shopkeepers. In 1917 the club successfully resisted a government proposal to commandeer its London premises under the <span class="roman">Defence of the Realm Act</span>. Instead it opened its doors as the headquarters of the Royal Overseas Officers Club. Overall Orde was deemed to have presided over the wartime RAC in a &#145;masterly&#146;, even &#145;fatherly&#146; way  (Brendon, 184). He was knighted in 1919 for his &#145;exceptional services in providing for overseas officers during the war&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13 Aug 1919).<br>
<br>Orde participated in several government inquiries during and soon after the war. He sat on a review of the use of partially disabled drivers on public vehicles (1919), served on the mechanical transport section of the committee for the disposal of government surplus (1919), and was a technical adviser to the advisory committee on London traffic (1920).<br>
<br>Tall, &#145;elegant and imposing&#146;, with an &#145;outstanding personality&#146;, Orde was socially well connected and long considered an arbiter of motoring fashion (Brendon, 100; White, 229). He was a &#145;stickler for discipline&#146; and colleagues and staff at the club knew him variously as &#145;His Ordeship&#146;, &#145;Lord Orde&#146;, and &#145;Orde God Almighty&#146;. But he had a &#145;light touch&#146; and RAC members admired him as an &#145;entertaining wit&#146;  (Brendon, 100). <span class="italic">The Times</span> considered Orde the &#145;ideal secretary&#146;  (19 March 1909) and with a salary of &pound;2500 p.a. in 1912 the RAC rewarded him well for his services  (Brendon, 154). Between 1903 and 1919 club membership grew tenfold and revenue more than a hundredfold  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 30 May 1923). Nevertheless the RAC was outstripped by its main rival, the newer and socially inclusive AA. Orde had other failures. During a lengthy controversy over the standards of country garages, including those approved by the RAC, an editorial in <span class="italic">The Times</span> accused him of &#145;complacency&#146;  (19 Nov 1920). Only after he retired, in 1923, were RAC road guides &#145;organised into an efficient, full-time force&#146;  (Brendon, 206&#150;8).<br>
<br>For several years before his retirement Orde's health was poor. In 1921&#150;2 he took six months' leave of absence during which he toured the Americas. His illness and absences have been deemed factors in initiating the RAC's long period of interwar decline  (Brendon, 206&#150;8). In the 1920s Orde was vice-president of the Auto Cycle Union. He also held directorships with several companies. He died of heart failure and fibrosis of the lung at his home, The Orchards, Raveningham, Norfolk, on 17 June 1929. His funeral was held in private. A memorial service was held at Holy Trinity Church, Sloane Street, west London. Two married daughters survived their father. One son was killed in action in the Dardanelles in 1915; another died in a flying accident in 1920. A third, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35328/', "Cuthbert Julian Orde")</script>, became a distinguished artist.<br>
