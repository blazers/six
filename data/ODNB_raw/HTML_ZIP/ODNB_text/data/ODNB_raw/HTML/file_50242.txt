<span class="headword">Bourchier, Sir  William</span>, count of Eu  (<em>c.</em>1374&#150;1420), <span class="occ">magnate and soldier</span>, was the son and heir of Sir William Bourchier (<i>d</i>. 1375) and his wife, Eleanor Lovayne (1345&#150;1397).<h2>
<a name="Backgroundandearlycareer"></a>Background and early career</h2>Bourchier's family had risen to prominence during the fourteenth century through an unblemished record of service to the crown, gaining estates concentrated in Suffolk and Essex. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2992/', "Sir Robert Bourchier")</script>, William's grandfather, was the first layman to become chancellor of England, and was duly elevated to the peerage as a reward. Both he and his eldest son, John, the second lord, distinguished themselves in the wars with France, establishing a reputation for military prowess which many of their descendants sought to emulate. Ennoblement brought wealth, and a substantial estate centred upon Halstead in Essex, but since he was only a younger son William's father could expect little in the way of inheritance. He was, however, well placed to make a lucrative marriage, to Eleanor, the second daughter and coheir of Sir John Lovayne (<i>d</i>. 1347). She eventually succeeded to all her father's property, which comprised seven manors in Essex and Suffolk, including Little Easton, the family seat. These passed directly to Bourchier's father when she died in 1397, providing him with an income of about &pound;154 a year net and adding greatly to his influence in the region.<br>
<br>The early death of his father, while he was still an infant, drew Bourchier into the orbit of his powerful neighbour, Thomas of Woodstock, duke of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1397). He may well have spent some of his youth in the ducal household at Pleshey Castle, Essex; and in May 1392, when he was about eighteen, he contracted to accompany the duke to Ireland, where he then held office as king's lieutenant. Gloucester's summary dismissal meant that they never actually set sail, but in 1394 the duke accompanied Richard II on an expedition there, and Bourchier travelled with them. He was knighted shortly afterwards. That he made an extremely favourable impression is evident from Gloucester's decision to engage him for life, in 1396, as a member of his personal retinue at a substantial fee of over &pound;36 a year. His patron's arrest and murder in the following year must have come as a bitter blow to Sir William; although he was too shrewd to show his hand (and even served on a royal commission to levy a fine imposed upon the duke's partisans in Essex and Hertfordshire), he remained in close touch with members of Gloucester's circle. One such was Walter, Lord Fitzwalter, with whom he sailed to Ireland in 1398, possibly remaining there for the rest of Richard II's reign. The value of his services was soon recognized by Henry IV, who arranged in March 1400 for the fee previously granted to him by Gloucester to be assigned directly upon the exchequer at Westminster and thus rendered more secure. Henry, prince of Wales, also thought highly of Sir William, assigning him a similar annuity as a knight of his chamber, in 1401, and entrusting him with the diplomatically sensitive task of negotiating two royal marriages with King Erik of Denmark. He returned to England in the spring of 1403, in time for Henry IV's victory at the battle of Shrewsbury on 21 July that year.<h2>
<a name="MarriagetoAnneofWoodstock"></a>Marriage to Anne of Woodstock</h2>Among the many fatalities on the king's side was Edmund Stafford, fifth earl of Stafford, who had been married to Gloucester's daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54430/', "Anne of Woodstock")</script>. As sole heir to the great estates left by the duke and his wife, Eleanor de Bohun, she laid claim to an income worth over &pound;2200 a year net. Although several of the properties in question were currently in other hands, she still ranked as one of the richest women in England and by far the greatest heiress. Then aged about twenty and the mother of one infant son, she offered any prospective husband the promise of great wealth combined with spectacular connections. Such a prize was not, however, within the common reach: Anne's proximity to the throne (she was a granddaughter of Edward III) and the extent of her holdings in eleven English counties, Wales, and Ireland made the question of her remarriage a matter of pressing political as well as financial concern to the crown. Until her cousin Henry V forced her to accept a repartition of the Bohun estates in 1421, she owned swathes of property across the south-east, including Pleshey Castle. In addition, her dower lands (from the third as well as the fifth earl) gave her control of well over half the Stafford inheritance, with a string of castles and lordships along the Welsh border. Fear that the rebels might seize one of these strongholds led Henry IV to entrust Sir William with the task of supervising the defences. He and Anne found themselves together at Huntington Castle in Herefordshire, and it seems to have been then, within a few weeks of Earl Edmund's death, that their clandestine marriage took place. Since they had almost certainly become acquainted at Pleshey in the 1390s, their conduct was less impetuous than it might at first appear. Not even Bourchier, a man of undoubted eloquence and charm, could expect to escape scot-free, but he was clearly prepared to risk the threat of Henry's immediate displeasure. His qualities as a soldier and administrator, as well as his proven loyalty to the beleaguered house of Lancaster, meant that he and his wife were soon excused the &#145;great sums&#146; that Henry had ordered them to hand over personally in his chamber. Even so, there can be little doubt that, however highly they may have regarded Sir William, neither Henry IV nor his eldest son felt the slightest compunction in obstructing Anne's efforts to recover and retain substantial parts of her inheritance&#151;an inheritance that might, but for Sir William, have been enjoyed by one of their own kinsmen as her new husband. Bourchier's marriage received the unequivocal support of his neighbours in Essex, who had probably learned of it before the elections to the first parliament of 1404. This, his only known return to the House of Commons, reflects the warmth of feeling still felt in the county for the memory of the late duke, as well as the respect that he himself inspired.<h2>
<a name="Increasedwealthandresponsibilities"></a>Increased wealth and responsibilities</h2>During the years immediately after their marriage Bourchier and the countess enjoyed a net annual income of between &pound;1300 and &pound;1700 from her estates, which were administered separately by a staff of experienced bureaucrats. This was considerably less than she might have hoped for, but it represented untold riches for Sir William, who now lived the life of an English nobleman in all but name. Over the year ending September 1409, for example, payments in excess of &pound;894 were made into his own coffers by Anne's officials, she received her customary allowance of &pound;266 for personal expenses, and their joint household cost about &pound;442. Bourchier's private income from this source fluctuated considerably, but never appears to have fallen below &pound;412. His new status brought with it a heavy burden of responsibilities, including the protection of Anne's lordships along the Welsh border, which were still vulnerable to attack. For much of the time he remained in attendance upon Prince Henry, fighting under his banner throughout the summer of 1404, and again, in 1407, when the rebel force supporting Owain Glyn D&#373;r at Aberystwyth surrendered after a long siege. As a marcher lord he clearly had a vested personal interest in the suppression of disorder in Wales. He did not, even so, miss the opportunity to extend his own holdings by leasing property in Essex and Norfolk that had been confiscated from a number of alien priories by the government. His membership of the Essex bench, on which he sat for approximately seven years, also bolstered his authority in the region. In this and many other respects, Bourchier profited greatly from his close association with Prince Henry, who mounted the throne in 1413, and (initially at least) looked more favourably upon some of the Countess Anne's claims as a widow and an heiress. He allowed her to recover her father's lordship of Oakham, Rutland, and to collect revenues from the Stafford family estates in Ireland, using these concessions to reward his former companion-in-arms.<h2>
<a name="ServiceinFranceanddeath"></a>Service in France, and death</h2>As one of Henry's most trusted advisers Bourchier played a significant part in the diplomatic negotiations that preceded the outbreak of hostilities with France in 1415. He spent several weeks in Paris discussing &#145;secret matters&#146; with the French king's emissaries  (TNA: PRO, E404/31/106), being paid &pound;100 in expenses sustained on a mission which, despite its avowed intention of establishing a permanent peace between the two countries, was seen by the English as little more than a cosmetic exercise. Henry V was already mobilizing an army for the invasion of Normandy when Sir William returned home in March. An experienced commander, whose keen intelligence evidently matched his valour in the field, Bourchier now took his place among the leading English captains. He contracted to serve with a large contingent of ninety mounted archers and twenty-nine men-at-arms, and was singled out as one of the beneficiaries of the will that King Henry made in July 1415, just as the army was about to sail. He was promised one of the king's best horses, an appropriate legacy in view of the great bravery he is said to have displayed during the battle of Agincourt in the following October, when 102 men fought directly under him. A number of distinguished prisoners were taken back to England by the victorious army and held in the Tower of London. Since Edward, duke of York, the previous constable, had fallen at Agincourt, Bourchier seemed an ideal replacement. He held the constableship of the Tower from November 1415 until his death, with special responsibility for the safe keeping of the French captives. He was, in addition, granted the less demanding post of master of the royal hounds. As might be expected, given the confidence that he inspired, he was sent as an envoy to receive the visiting emperor, Sigismund, when the latter arrived at Rochester in the spring of 1416. King Henry showed his approval in more concrete ways, too, allowing him to farm some of the estates of his stepson, Humphrey Stafford, future duke of Buckingham (<i>d</i>. 1460), and of other royal wards.<br>
<br>Bourchier played an even more important part in Henry V's second expedition to France, which he joined with a personal retinue of 164 men, including 39 mounted lances. This was an army of occupation, whose commanders could expect a share of the conquered territories. After a summer of hard campaigning, in November 1417 Bourchier was given custody of the confiscated estates of the Hermanville family and of a large town house called the Golden Lion in Caen. He spent much of the following year at the sieges of Louviers and Rouen, and in February 1419 assumed the captaincy of Dieppe, which had surrendered to him just a few days before. In order to maintain open lines of supply and communication, it was vital for the English to keep the port firmly under their control, so the appointment was no sinecure. Bourchier became serjeant of Mantes and Meulan as well, being entrusted with the task of provisioning King Henry's headquarters while he was in the vicinity. It was at this time that Henry decided to take possession of the town and <i>comt&eacute;</i> of Eu (to the north-east of Dieppe), whose lord, Charles d'Artois, then a prisoner in the Tower, had consistently refused to acknowledge his suzerainty. Bourchier was instructed to appoint officials loyal to the English, and then, in June 1419, was himself given the <i>comt&eacute;</i> in tail male. In all, six of Henry V's most valued adjutants were rewarded in this way, as part of a policy designed to strengthen the English presence in Normandy and give leading commanders a personal stake in the success of the enterprise. A few months later Bourchier and his male heirs were likewise confirmed in possession of the Hermanville estates, but he himself did not survive to enjoy them. He died at Troyes on 28 May 1420, his body being sent back to England for burial at Llanthony Priory in Gloucestershire.<h2>
<a name="TheBourchierlegacy"></a>The Bourchier legacy</h2>As her correspondence with her great friend the prior of Llanthony reveals, the Countess Anne had avidly followed the progress of the English army in France, recording with pride &#145;the valiant prowess, wisdom and good governance&#146; of her husband  (TNA: PRO, C115/K2/6682 fol. 129<i>r</i>). Her sorrow at his death seems to have been real and lasting: she never remarried and asked, in her will, to be buried beside him. She employed two priests at Little Easton to pray daily for his salvation, and had two masses sung each day at Llanthony for the same purpose. Whatever distress he may have felt at the loss of an old friend, Henry V showed little sentiment in his dealings with Anne, who was forced to accept a repartition of the Bohun estates in 1421, and obliged to struggle on for another decade before all her inheritance was restored to her. This may have intensified her determination to see that her five children with Bourchier did well for themselves, for it was she who promoted their careers and arranged their marriages. They did not disappoint her. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2987/', "Henry Bourchier")</script>, the eldest, succeeded his father as count of Eu and eventually became first earl of Essex; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2993/', "Thomas Bourchier")</script>, archbishop of Canterbury, dominated the political stage for over three decades; and both William and John were elevated to the peerage as, respectively, Lord Fitzwarine and Lord Berners. Their sister, Eleanor, married John (VI) Mowbray, third duke of Norfolk.<br>
