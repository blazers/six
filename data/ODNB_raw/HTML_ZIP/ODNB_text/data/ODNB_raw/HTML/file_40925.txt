<span class="headword">Flaherty,  Robert Joseph</span>  (1884&#150;1951), <span class="occ">film director</span>, was born on 16 February 1884 in Iron Mountain, Michigan, USA, the first of the seven children of an Irish father, Robert Henry Flaherty, a highly respected figure in iron-ore exploration in Canada, and a German mother, Susan Kl&ouml;ckner. Educated in Minnesota, Michigan, and Ontario, Flaherty studied at the Upper Canada College (from which he was expelled) in Toronto, Canada, followed by the Michigan College of Mines (which he left after seven months). He married Frances Hubbard (<i>d</i>. 1972), the daughter of the mineralogist Lucius L. Hubbard, in 1914, and with her had three daughters, Barbara, Frances, and Monica.<h2>
<a name="Arcticexplorerandfilmmaker"></a>Arctic explorer and film-maker</h2>Flaherty worked first as a surveyor for the Grand Trunk Pacific railroad from 1906 to 1908. Through an introduction from his father, in 1910 he was hired by Sir William Mackenzie, the mining and railroad magnate, to explore for iron ore on the Nastapoka Islands and Belcher Islands in the Canadian Arctic. During his extensive travels with Inuit guides, Flaherty developed a close affinity for the Arctic environment and its indigenous peoples. Mackenzie provided him with photographic equipment so that Flaherty might document the native people and geological features of the areas he explored on his expeditions. Flaherty became an expert photographer, producing a prodigious number of beautiful portraits of the Inuit. Overshadowed by his later film work, the photographs comprise an important and valuable contribution to early twentieth-century photography. In these portraits Flaherty suggests an inherent nobility of his Inuit subjects, while capturing a distinctive range of individuals.<br>
<br>Recognizing the value of Flaherty's documentary skills, Sir William Mackenzie sent him to Rochester, New York, for three weeks to be instructed in the art of cinematography by the Eastman Company. This was to be his only formal training in film-making. On his following Arctic expeditions for Mackenzie in 1913&#150;14, Flaherty travelled to Baffin Island and again to the Belcher Islands in Hudson Bay, off the coast of Arctic Quebec, where he mapped, sampled minerals, and filmed. In recognition, the Canadian government later named the largest of the Belcher Islands after him. Although Flaherty was a mineralogist by profession, he had a strong artistic sensibility, as demonstrated by his talents as a violinist and story-teller. He was also good-humoured and possessed a charismatic personality. Upon his return to Toronto, Flaherty edited the 70,000 feet of film he had shot in the Arctic, but was dissatisfied with the outcome. By his own account, &#145;it was a bad film; it was dull&#151;it was little more than a travelogue. I had learned to explore, I had not learned to reveal&#146;  (Barsam, 15). His first film lacked a compelling story. By accident, Flaherty dropped a lighted cigarette on the editing-room floor and the film's highly flammable nitrate stock instantly went up in flames, destroying the negative and burning Flaherty in the process. The only copy, known as the &#145;Harvard print&#146; because it had been screened at the university, was later lost.<br>
<br>None the less, Flaherty was captivated by the potential of film-making, and decided that this was where his future lay. He would try again. This time he was determined to make a film that captured the essence of Inuit life and the hardships the Inuit faced, and one that people would want to see. Raising the capital to do so became a frustrating process which extended over several years. With his wife, Frances, as his constant supporter, he lectured, worked on a book about his experiences, and approached film companies and institutions in an effort to raise the necessary finance. In New York he met Edward Curtis who was establishing a reputation as the leading photographer and film-maker of native American tribes. The influence and parallels between the two men's photographic and early film work is significant. Curtis had already achieved success with his dramatic recreation of Kwakiutl Indian ceremonies in his film <span class="italic">In the Land of the Head Hunters</span> (1914).<h2>
<a name="NanookoftheNorth"></a>Nanook of the North</h2>In 1920 Flaherty finally managed to secure sponsorship from the French fur trading company Revillon Fr&egrave;res, which was the major competitor of the long-established Hudson's Bay Company in the Canadian north. The fur company underwrote Flaherty's sixteen-month trip to make a film about the Inuit, using their trading post at Port Harrison (now Inukjuak) on the Ungava peninsula in Arctic Quebec as the base for his activities. Although the $53,000 from Revillon Fr&egrave;res came with few known pre-conditions, the issue of corporate sponsorship of <span class="italic">Nanook</span> and Flaherty's final film, <span class="italic">Louisiana Story</span> (1948), raises key questions about how the subjects were portrayed. In the resulting film, <span class="italic">Nanook of the North</span> (1922), the Revillon Fr&egrave;res trader Captain Thierry Mallet is seen only briefly, but his representation is that of the kind white man who is on friendly terms with the Inuit. He is also the only white man to appear in the film. Mallet is seen playing records on his phonograph for Nanook, providing medicine for one of Nanook's children, and enjoying friendly banter. There are no suggestions of the more complex relations traders might have, of the relationship of dependence that developed, or of social issues and controversies associated with the increasing Inuit contact with other elements of white society, including the government and the church.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Nanook of the North</span> is a landmark film which presents a family's captivating story of survival, adapting to life in an extreme physical environment. Robert Flaherty is often referred to as the father of the documentary and the ethnographic film. Yet he is more than that. With <span class="italic">Nanook of the North</span>, Flaherty invented a new film language, a hybrid that combined elements of the ethnographic with the dramatic structure and cogent form of a fiction film. His methodology was brave and unusual, even by today's practices. He enlisted the aid of his subjects to make the film a collaborative effort. He trained Inuit assistants and paid them to develop and print the film stock on location and maintain the cameras. He showed his footage to his Inuit subjects in order to ensure their interest and support, and to gain their views on how to improve the story. Flaherty blurred the boundaries of the traditional film-maker and subject relationship. Although the film was a novelty in that it showed Inuit living out scenes from their daily lives, these non-actors were cast in their roles. The scenes, such as a seal hunt or the building of an igloo, were all staged for the camera. Nanook's very name was an invention&#151;a transliteration of the Inuktitut word for &#145;polar bear&#146;. His actual name was Alakariallak. In the film he wears bear pants, in keeping with his stage name, even though the Inuit in Arctic Quebec did not. The highlight of the film was to be a polar bear hunt, but they could not find one. Nanook's &#145;family&#146; had been cast. His wife Nyla was in fact a relative, Maggie Nujarluktuk, with whom Flaherty was to have a son, Joseph. Poignantly, Joseph Flaherty and his family were moved in the 1950s by the Canadian government to Grise Fiord on Ellesmere Island in the high Arctic, as part of a social engineering experiment designed to &#145;rehabilitate&#146; them  (Marcus, 13, 67).<br>
<br>It was not Flaherty's intention to mislead; instead his objective was a meticulous visual attempt to enhance the impression of actuality. &#145;One often has to distort a thing to catch its true spirit&#146;, he said  (Calder-Marshall, 97). The humanistic and collaborative nature of his venture is one he clearly felt: &#145;I wanted to show them, not from a civilized point of view, but as they saw themselves, as &#147;we, the people&#148;&#146;  (Griffith, 36). Despite the absence of overt social issues in this film or in most of his later work, Flaherty was alarmed by what he saw as the detrimental impact of white people on Inuit culture. He wished to show &#145;the former majesty and character of these people, while it is still possible&#151;before the white man has destroyed not only their character, but the people as well&#146;  (Danzker, 72). Flaherty thus minimized examples of the white man's influence and culture in his film, deciding not to include scenes of the Inuit using rifles to hunt, for example. While some have referred to this approach as salvage ethnography, the film offers much more than an improvisatory document of pre-contact Inuit culture. In presenting a series of sequences, Flaherty uses imagination, humour, and artistry to reveal the ingenuity and impressive abilities of his Inuit friends, and their parallels with our own daily lives.<br>
<br>Finding it difficult to secure a distributor for his unusual film, Flaherty persuaded the French company Path&eacute; to take a risk. <span class="italic">Nanook of the North</span> opened in New York on Broadway at the Capitol Theatre as a double bill with Harold Lloyd's new comedy, <span class="italic">Grandma's Boy</span>, on 11 June 1922. It was an instant hit with audiences and critics, and quickly received worldwide distribution to great acclaim. The film popularized Eskimo pie ice creams, refrigerators, and Nanook love songs. When Nanook's death from starvation was reported two years later, such was his fame outside the Arctic that the great hunter was mourned in Peking. It was part of the myth that even today the real cause of his death, suggested to be tuberculosis, the white man's disease that was to plague the north, has been conveniently obscured.<h2>
<a name="Atropicalparadise"></a>A tropical paradise</h2>To a large extent, most of Flaherty's later films continued to trace and reinvent the &#145;primal drama&#146; archetype he featured in <span class="italic">Nanook of the North</span>, depicting man's relationship with his natural environment. At times this was presented as a heroic struggle against the odds, and in other films it was characterized by a quiet equilibrium. John Grierson coined the term &#145;documentary film&#146; when applying it in a review in the <span class="italic">New York Sun</span> to Flaherty's next film, <span class="italic">Moana</span> (1926), thereby christening the new genre of factual film-making. While Grierson was using the word as an adjective, rather than as an example of the kind of socio-political documentary films of which he later became a proponent, the term has continued to be first associated with the work of Robert Flaherty  (Barsam, 42). Following the commercial success of <span class="italic">Nanook</span>, Flaherty received a <i>carte blanche</i> offer in 1923 from Jesse Lasky, head of Paramount Pictures, to go anywhere in the world to make another <span class="italic">Nanook</span>-like film. Two months later he embarked for the Samoan islands in the south seas. This time he took his three young daughters, his wife, Frances, and his younger brother David as collaborators. While abroad, the book he wrote in collaboration with Frances, <span class="italic">My Eskimo Friends</span> (1924), which described his adventures of making <span class="italic">Nanook of the North</span>, was published by Doubleday.<br>
<br>On the island of Savaii, Flaherty and his team set about documenting the lives of Samoans. In this tropical paradise Flaherty was unable to discover a tale of survival, so he filmed the Samoans undertaking ritual dances and body tattooing, and a story involving the courting of a young couple. As with <span class="italic">Nanook</span>, Flaherty pushed his cinematography to the limits, and experimented with the use of colour-sensitive panchromatic film, achieving an extraordinary luminosity and beauty. Once again he trained his subjects to process the film on location, and exhibited the rushes to them as the film was being made. Flaherty further honed his skill in trying to achieve a non-ethnocentric representation, so that the film would reflect a more indigenous perspective. With <span class="italic">Moana</span>, the Flahertys adopted a more rigorous approach to realizing an internal ethnographic vision, though without the film actually becoming self-reflexive. After twenty months of filming and travelling, the Flaherty entourage returned to the United States with their 240,000 feet of film. Admired by the critics, the finished film was curiously publicized by the Hollywood studio as <span class="italic">Moana: the Love Life of a South Sea Siren</span>, but failed to achieve commercial success.<br>
<br>Flaherty went on to experience a familiar cycle of attempts to raise funds from Hollywood and elsewhere for his film projects. Although he completed two short sponsored films, <span class="italic">The Pottery Maker</span> (1925) and <span class="italic">The Twenty-Four Dollar Island</span> (1927), more ambitious plans, such as one to make a film on the Acoma Pueblo in New Mexico, went unrealized. Invited by the producer Irving Thalberg to work on a film for MGM, <span class="italic">White Shadows in the South Seas</span> (1928), to be filmed in Tahiti, Flaherty ultimately left the production when it was transformed into a romantic drama. Another feature film, <span class="italic">Tabu</span> (1931), set in Tahiti and co-directed with the German director Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau, was fraught with creative differences between the two men. Flaherty's approach to film-making, characterized by lengthy periods of reflection and constant and prolonged observational filming, usually without the aid of a script, diverged entirely from prevailing professional practices. His methodology was considered too abstract and unconventional, and his only commercial success, <span class="italic">Nanook</span>, came to be viewed by the industry as an anomaly.<h2>
<a name="Finalfilms"></a>Final films</h2>Flaherty turned his sights towards Europe and accepted an invitation from John Grierson to make a documentary film for the Empire Marketing Board in London, entitled <span class="italic">Industrial Britain</span> (1933). Michael Balcon of Gaumont-British then offered Flaherty the opportunity to film his next project, <span class="italic">Man of Aran</span> (1934), focusing on the lives of the Aran islanders off the west coast of Ireland. Returning to his theme of primal struggle and the perils of living in a harsh environment, Flaherty choreographed a vision of traditional Aran life, including the islanders' attempts to turn rock into soil for their crops and hunt basking sharks in the mountainous seas. The islanders risked their lives at times to provide the director with the realism he sought, and the film captures convincing moments of real drama. Although criticized for presenting a romanticized view of island life and for not confronting the serious economic and political issues of the day, Flaherty's film was awarded the grand prix at the Venice film festival in 1934, in admiration of its heroic storyline and impressive cinematography.<br>
<br>As a result, Flaherty was once again approached to direct a big-budget dramatic film. The British producer Alexander Korda engaged Flaherty to adapt Rudyard Kipling's <span class="italic">Toomai of the Elephants</span>. Flaherty and his family set out for Mysore, India, with the crew, and spent months shooting large amounts of footage, often of tangential interest to the storyline. Unhappy with the film's direction and progress, the producer finally replaced Flaherty with his brother Zoltan Korda, and <span class="italic">Elephant Boy</span> (1937) was completed at a studio in England. The young star of the film, Sabu, whom Flaherty discovered, went on to Hollywood, but the film marked an end to any ambitions Robert Flaherty had of harnessing the resources of mainstream cinema.<br>
<br>Pare Lorentz, director of the new American government film service, provided Flaherty with his next documentary subject. <span class="italic">The Land</span> (1942), which was made for the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, starkly documents America's depression-era dustbowl disaster and its impact on the land, animals, and people. The film is more akin to Griersonian concepts of documentary film-making, designed to increase public awareness of social issues, than to the lyrical approach of Flaherty's other work. Completed during wartime, <span class="italic">The Land</span> is unlike his other work in being a film about victims. <span class="italic">The Land</span> was suppressed and received its first screening before a private audience at the Museum of Modern Art in 1942. Often overlooked by film historians, perhaps because of the limited availability of prints and the fact that it does not fit neatly within the Flaherty aesthetic, <span class="italic">The Land</span> deserves serious further study.<br>
<br>In 1944 Standard Oil of New Jersey approached Flaherty with a view to making a film about the company's oil exploration activities in Louisiana. The sponsored film would come with a generous budget. As with Revillon Fr&egrave;res and <span class="italic">Nanook of the North</span>, both companies hoped for a beneficial association with Flaherty and a filmic vision that would cast their business practices in a positive light. Given the controversies surrounding the oil companies' later destruction of the bayous and wetlands of Louisiana, Flaherty's lyrical story about a Cajun boy and his encounter with the non-intrusive exploration activities of the oilmen could be seen as ironic. <span class="italic">Louisiana Story</span> (1948), directed by Flaherty co-written with his wife, Frances, and filmed by Ricky Leacock, was a critical success, and Flaherty's final film.<h2>
<a name="Significance"></a>Significance</h2>Flaherty died on 23 July 1951 at the family home, Black Mountain Farm, Brattleboro, Vermont, with his stature as a pioneer film-maker intact. The enormous influence of his handful of films and their contribution to the art of cinema have been continually reaffirmed by film historians and leading directors. Fred Zinnemann referred to Flaherty as his &#145;creative godfather&#146;. Jean Renoir wrote that &#145;he was a man made of love. That is why he had so much feeling for the characters in his films.&#146; Importantly, Flaherty's subjects are never presented as oddities, regardless of their exotic surroundings and unusual customs. Instead they are revealed as resourceful and sympathetic individuals who exist in harmony with their environment, whether chiselled in struggle or muted in quiet compatibility. &#145;A sympathetic understanding of peoples all over the world is becoming more and more important&#146;, wrote Flaherty, &#145;it is one of the urgent needs of our time. And here, surely, is a vital field for the motion picture&#146;  (&#145;Flaherty Talking&#146;, 26). The sincerity of his humanistic mission and creative vision is evident in his writings and now classic films.<br>
