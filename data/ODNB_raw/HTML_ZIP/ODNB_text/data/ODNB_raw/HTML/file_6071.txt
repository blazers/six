<span class="headword">Coningham,  James</span>  (1669/70&#150;1716), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and tutor</span>, of unknown parents, was described as &#145;Anglus&#146; when he graduated MA from Edinburgh University on 27 February 1694. His first ministry was at Penrith, Cumberland, at a new Presbyterian meeting established as a result of a lectureship supported by Dr Thomas Gibson of Hatton Garden, London. Subsequently, the Congregational Fund Board made a grant of &pound;5. He was ordained in August 1694 as a licentiate of the Church of Scotland. While at Penrith he began to prepare students for the nonconformist ministry. He married Agnes Cookson (<i>bap</i>. 1671), daughter of William and Alice Cookson, at St Andrew's, Penrith, on 30 July 1694. There is evidence that locally he became a figure of some note. In 1696 he rode to London &#145;in a monstrous large cloth hat&#146; to present the <span class="roman">Cumberland Association</span> to King William  (J. Coningham to R. Thoresby, 14 Sept 1699, Thoresby MSS), and he was involved in promoting the reformation of manners. He corresponded with the Leeds antiquarian Ralph Thoresby concerning natural curiosities, making a number of donations to Thoresby's museum. He is said to have been the author of <span class="italic">A critical essay on modern medals, with some reflections on the taste and judgment of the ancients</span> (1704).<br>
<br>In May 1699 Richard Stretton suggested Coningham as a suitable successor to Timothy Manlove as minister of the Mill Hill Chapel at Leeds, but in 1700 Coningham accepted the call to Cross Street, Manchester, as co-pastor with John Chorlton and to assist in the academy there. Little is known about what was taught, but the surviving manuscript notes of one student, John Turner (1689&#150;1737), in his <span class="roman">Bible</span> provide evidence for the study of Semitics. Coningham was said to be &#145;admirably well fitted for the Work &hellip; his Learning was very considerable&#146;  (Wright, 23). His most celebrated student was Samuel Bourn the younger. After Chorlton's death in August 1705, unsuccessful attempts by his congregation were made to obtain Samuel Benyon, tutor and minister at Broad Oak. Coningham's situation became increasingly uncomfortable. He was prosecuted for conducting an academy without a licence, and experienced much hostility locally as a dissenter. It was, however, the doctrinal divisions within his own congregation which persuaded him to accept the call to London from the congregation at Haberdasher Hall following the death in 1712 of their minister, Richard Stretton. There his ministry was much more comfortable, but his health was broken and he died on 1 September 1716 in his forty-seventh year. He was buried in Bunhill Fields, London.<br>
