<span class="headword">Inglis,  Brian St John</span>  (1916&#150;1993), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 31 July 1916 at 89 Lower Baggot Street, Dublin, the only child of Sir Claude Cavendish Inglis (1883&#150;1974), civil engineer to the Bombay government, and his wife, Vera Margaret St John Blood (<i>d</i>. 1972). He lived with his parents at Poona, India, from 1918 until 1921 but saw little of them thereafter; at the age of five he was sent to England to board at St Catharine's School, Bexhill-on-Sea, before passing to the Dragon School, Oxford (1925&#150;9), which he liked far better than Shrewsbury School (1929&#150;35). His holidays were spent with his grandmother Sophie Blood at Malahide, co. Dublin, in an old-fashioned Anglo-Irish milieu.<br>
<br>In 1935 Inglis went to Magdalen College, Oxford. He obtained a second-class degree in history in 1939, by which time he had imbibed vaguely left-wing ideas. Studying Irish history made him cease to think of the English as his fellow countrymen, but he would always be aware of conflicting loyalties arising from an Irish Protestant background. He left for Dublin when the war began and reported local news for the <span class="italic">Irish Times</span>.<br>
<br>From June 1940 to January 1946 Inglis served voluntarily in the Royal Air Force, piloting flying boats for Coastal Command in west Africa and reaching the rank of squadron leader. The <span class="italic">Irish Times</span> re-engaged him on his return to Dublin as Quidnunc of &#145;An Irishman's Diary&#146;. Patrick Campbell, Conor Cruise O'Brien, and Erskine H. Childers were numbered among his friends. A supporter of the Irish Labour Party, Inglis went freelance for two years from 1948 while completing a doctoral thesis at Trinity College, Dublin, on the freedom of the press in Ireland (1784&#150;1841). From 1951 to 1953 the <span class="italic">Irish Times</span> carried his parliamentary sketches of the D&aacute;il.<br>
<br>Inglis moved to London in June 1953 to work for the tabloid <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span>. Highly sociable, he appeared at home in Fleet Street bars and clubs. There was nothing loud or pushy about Brian; standing quietly at the side of parties, he let other people come to him for lively talk, which spiced scholarly syntax with swear words. He never had an Irish accent. After a year he gave up his job, intending to write a novel, but in September 1954 he was asked to be assistant editor of <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, a prestigious weekly. This placed him third within its hierarchy, rising to second in 1956. The editor-in-chief was the proprietor, Ian Gilmour.<br>
<br>On 5 November 1956 Inglis appeared on television for the first time, as writer&#150;presenter of Granada TV's press review <span class="italic">What the Papers Say</span>. He reappeared on 160 editions over the next twenty years. Inglis in 1958 married Ruth (Boo) Woodeson (<i>b</i>. 1928), otherwise Ruth Langdon, an American journalist with a daughter from a previous marriage. They had a son in 1962.<br>
<br>When Inglis thought about leaving <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> in 1959, Gilmour responded by making him editor. Its circulation rose from 39,000 to 48,000 during his term. The journal boasted &#145;star&#146; columnists in Bernard Levin (politics), Alan Brien (theatre), and Cyril Ray (wine). Often satirical in tone, it refrained from endorsing the Conservatives in the general election of 1959 and aired support for easier divorce, tolerance of homosexuality, and ending the death penalty. Gilmour began to complain that the content was becoming too lightweight&#151;which Inglis took to mean too liberal. When he heard that Gilmour aimed to be a Conservative MP he resigned as editor in February 1962, fearing that the political independence of <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> would be compromised. He remained on its board, however, until November 1963, when he severed all ties in protest at the appointment as editor of tory politician Iain Macleod.<br>
<br>To a wider public Brian Inglis became familiar as the presenter of <span class="italic">All Our Yesterdays</span> (1962&#150;73), Granada TV's weekly look at the events of twenty-five years earlier as shown in Path&eacute; newsreels. He enjoyed the social life of a television celebrity but liked even more the short hours and high income which enabled him to devote most of his time to writing books. The industrial revolution, the First Opium War, and Roger Casement were among his historical subjects. Having himself coined the term &#145;fringe medicine&#146; in 1960, he now wrote extensively on homoeopathy, acupuncture, and the like. When he separated from his wife in 1972&#151;they divorced in 1974&#151;his home ceased to be a large house in Paddington and became a small basement flat, full of books, at 23 Lambolle Road, Belsize Park. He was a founder member of the British-Irish Association (1972), an educational charity intended to promote better relations.<br>
<br>Arthur Koestler encouraged Inglis to pursue research into supernatural and paranormal phenomena. His later books concern dreams, intuition, coincidence, trances, spontaneous combustion, dowsing, levitation, poltergeists, fire walking, and ghosts. He condemned scientists for overlooking these matters and privately regretted his own lack of psychic experience. He never forced his opinions on his friends, many of whom were young women. His reputation as a good-natured philanderer was deserved, but from 1984 he adored Margaret van Hattem (1948&#150;1989), a Dutch-born Australian-educated journalist. Brian Inglis died of ischaemic heart disease at the Royal Free Hospital, Camden, on 11 February 1993 after collapsing in the street. The body was cremated.<br>
