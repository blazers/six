<span class="headword">Collet,  Collet Dobson</span>  (1812&#150;1898), <span class="occ">radical and tax reformer</span>, was born on 31 December 1812 in London. He was the eldest son of John Dobson (1778&#150;1827), a London merchant, and his wife (and first cousin), Elizabeth Barker (1787&#150;1875). Collet assumed the name of his maternal grandparents, as did his sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41272/', "Sophia Dobson Collet")</script>. He was educated at Bruce Castle School, north London, and then studied law at University College, London, where he took third prize in the subject in 1833. Lacking the independent means that would have enabled him to study at the bar, Collet instead pursued musical studies at the Royal Academy of Music, and was a member of the choir at Drury Lane, under William Macready, and then at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden. In 1841 he was appointed director of the choir at South Place Chapel, Finsbury Square, then under the ministry of W. J. Fox.<br>
<br>At South Place, Collet began his lifelong association with the milieu of Finsbury radicalism. In February 1848 he went to Paris with W. J. Linton and other members of the Democratic Committee of Observation of the French Revolution in order to congratulate the French on the overthrow of Louis-Philippe and the declaration of the republic. Back in London in April 1848, Collet joined with other Finsbury radicals in the People's Charter Union (PCU), the main purpose of which was to oppose Feargus O'Connor's leadership of the Chartist movement. In February 1851 the PCU evolved into the Association for Promoting the Repeal of the Taxes on Knowledge (APRTK), and Collet became its secretary.<br>
<br>Supported in parliament by Thomas Milner Gibson and Richard Cobden, the association spearheaded the campaign to repeal those remaining indirect taxes which affected the newspapers&#151;not only the newspaper stamp itself, but also the advertisement and paper duties. The association also campaigned against the security system, which in order to discourage libel and blasphemy required that newspapers be registered so as to make proof of liability easier. Collet and, to a lesser extent, Richard Moore, undertook virtually all of the organization of the association themselves. Collet gave evidence to the select committee on the newspaper stamp in 1851, and during 1853&#150;4 deliberately tested the limits of the law by publishing (along with G. J. Holyoake) unstamped papers that carried news. The duty on advertisements in newspapers was abolished in 1853 and the stamp duty in 1855. In 1854 Collet married Mrs Jane Marshall, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sloan, widow of a Dunfermline newspaper proprietor.<br>
<br>During the Crimean War, much to his colleagues' surprise, Collet became associated with David Urquhart, the Russophobe and vehement enemy of Lord Palmerston. Collet joined with Urquhart in the Turkish Association, and then in August 1855, when the Urquhartite <span class="italic">Free Press</span> moved from Sheffield to London, he became its editor (and, when it became the <span class="italic">Diplomatic Review</span>, its publisher as well), a connection he retained for over twenty years. Collet also became Urquhart's unofficial secretary, dealing with the correspondence and the organization of the self-styled working men's foreign affairs committees which were established between the mid-1850s and early 1860s. Collet's work with the <span class="italic">Diplomatic Review</span> brought him into contact with Karl Marx, and during the 1860s and 1870s the two men's families became friendly with one another.<br>
<br>When the <span class="italic">Diplomatic Review</span> folded in 1877, Collet found another outlet for his considerable propagandist energies. In October 1877 he became secretary of the Travelling Tax Abolition Committee, which was set up to press for the repeal of the railway (and tramway) passenger duty&#151;a repeal which had been recommended by a parliamentary select committee in 1876. The publicity that the committee gave to the issue undoubtedly contributed to the partial repeal of the duty in 1883.<br>
<br>Collet's journalism spanned some forty years, and a handful of newspapers and reviews. As well as publishing the <span class="italic">Potteries Free Press</span>, and editing the <span class="italic">Diplomatic Review</span> and the APRTK's <span class="italic">Gazette</span>, and the Travelling Tax Abolition Committee's <span class="italic">Gazette</span>, he also contributed to G. J. Holyoake's <span class="italic">The Reasoner</span>, the <span class="italic">Industrial Review</span> (formerly <span class="italic">The Beehive</span>), the <span class="italic">Anglo-American Times</span>, and <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> (as Diplomaticus). He was a well-known music critic, and wrote for the <span class="italic">Musical World</span>. (He also sang in the annual Handel festival at the Crystal Palace until well into his eighties.) Collet wrote a number of pamphlets connected with the campaign to repeal the passenger duty, and towards the end of his life he wrote what remains a worthy account of the repeal of the newspaper taxes: <span class="italic">History of the Taxes on Knowledge</span> (2 vols., 1899).<br>
<br>Collet died three days short of his eighty-sixth birthday at 7 Coleridge Road, his home in Finsbury, on 28 December 1898; he was survived by his wife. Among their five children were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39079/', "Clara Elizabeth Collet (1860&#150;1948)")</script>, the educationist, and Wilfred Collet (1856&#150;1929), the colonial administrator, who was created KCMG in 1915.<br>
