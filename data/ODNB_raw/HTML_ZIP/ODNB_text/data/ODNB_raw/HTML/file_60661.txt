<span class="headword">Dehn,  Paul Edward</span>  (1912&#150;1976), <span class="occ">writer and film critic</span>, was born on 5 November 1912 at 13 Belfield Road, Didsbury, Manchester, the elder son and eldest of the three children of Frederick Edward Dehn (1881/2&#150;1947), cotton merchant, and his wife, Helen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Susman (1880&#150;1976). His parents were British of German Jewish descent. His godfather was James Agate, the drama critic, a close friend of his father. Known as Fritz (his original name before Anglicization), Dehn's father was very musical and was remembered by Agate for his panache and high spirits, along with a tendency to launch out into political tirades in inappropriate places. Dehn's siblings were <a href="#cosubject_100311">Olive Dehn [<i>see below</i>]</a> and Eric Dehn (1916&#150;2009), a schoolteacher.<br>
<br>Dehn was educated at Shrewsbury School (1925&#150;30), for which he retained an affection, and at Brasenose College, Oxford (1930&#150;34). After a brief spell on the <span class="italic">Birmingham Post</span>, in 1936 he joined the <span class="italic">Sunday Referee</span> as a film critic and columnist. At the start of the Second World War he went into intelligence, and is said to have worked for a while as personal assistant to General Gubbins. His talent as a linguist resulted in his being transferred to the Special Operations Executive (SOE) at Beaulieu, where his task&#151;along with Kim Philby&#151;was to teach propaganda (including &#145;black&#146;) warfare. He delighted everyone with his entertaining manner and piano playing, and could put on a &#145;good nightclub act&#146;. He is also recorded as having been a &#145;serious thinker&#146;, with a warm and romantic nature, not to mention an outstanding instructor. In America it was said that listening to him was more exciting than reading a spy novel. The story goes that once he lay in his bath learning by heart how to deliver a lecture in Polish to Polish students. The talk went off perfectly, but the students were perplexed when he was unable to answer their questions.<br>
<br>In the winter of 1942 Dehn was posted as chief instructor to Camp X at Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. Then in the summer of 1943 he went to the United States to read propaganda warfare to members of the office of strategic services. After the German surrender he went to Norway on an interrogation mission; he also compiled an agent's handbook. It was in 1944 that he met James Michael (Jimmy) Bernard (<i>b</i>. 1925), later to become a well-known composer of film music, and they lived together until Dehn's death. After leaving the army as a major he worked as a film critic of considerable distinction on the <span class="italic">Sunday Chronicle</span>, then on the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>, and from 1960 to 1963 on the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span>. He contributed lyrics to many of the very successful theatre revues of the early 1950s: <span class="italic">The Lyric Revue</span>, <span class="italic">The Globe Revue</span>, <span class="italic">Penny Plain</span>, <span class="italic">At the Lyric</span>, and so on. In 1952 he wrote a masque for Shrewsbury School's 400th anniversary and a verse commentary for an award-winning film on the Thames, <span class="italic">Waters of Time</span>. In the same year both he and James Bernard were awarded Hollywood Oscars as joint authors for the film <span class="italic">Seven Days to Noon</span>. An adaptation of Wilde's <span class="italic">A Woman of No Importance</span> ran at the Savoy in 1953, and in 1954 Lennox Berkeley's opera <span class="italic">A Dinner Engagement</span>, for which Paul had written the libretto, was presented at the Aldeburgh festival and later ran at Sadler's Wells. He was also a critic on the BBC, and in 1956 president of the Critics' Council. Meanwhile he had published two books of poetry, <span class="italic">The Day's Alarm</span> (1949) and <span class="italic">The Romantic Landscape</span> (1952), which included one of his best poems, &#145;The Sunken Cathedral&#146;. <span class="italic">For Love and Money</span> (1956) was a miscellaneous collection of articles, essays, poems, and light verse, mostly already published in <span class="italic">Punch</span>, <span class="italic">The Listener</span>, <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, and elsewhere.<br>
<br>In 1958 Dehn received the British Film Academy award for the script of <span class="italic">Orders to Kill</span>. His collaboration with Terence Rattigan in <span class="italic">Joie de vivre</span> (1960), a musical version of <span class="italic">French without Tears</span>, was not a success, but the musical version of Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">Virtue in Danger</span> (1963, with James Bernard), for which he wrote the book and lyrics, was better received. In 1967 he wrote the librettos for William Walton's <span class="italic">The Bear</span> and Lennox Berkeley's <span class="italic">The Castaway</span>. After giving up film criticism, he concentrated on screenplays, for which he gained a brilliant reputation. These included <span class="italic">Goldfinger</span> (1964, as co-author), <span class="italic">The Spy who Came in from the Cold</span> (1966), <span class="italic">The Deadly Affair</span> (1966), Zeffirelli's version of <span class="italic">The Taming of the Shrew</span> (1967), three of the <span class="italic">Planet of the Apes</span> films (1969, 1971, 1972), and most notably <span class="italic">Murder on the Orient Express</span> (1974). This last received an Oscar nomination, and Agatha Christie declared that it was the best film adaptation of any of her books. There were two more books of poems: <span class="italic">Quake, Quake, Quake</span> (1961), written with ghoulish wit, and with drawings to match by Edward Gorey; and <span class="italic">The Fern on the Rock</span> (1965).<br>
<br>It is not surprising that with all this tremendous literary activity friends were periodically told that &#145;Paul is in purdah&#146;. Nevertheless there were many lavish dinner parties at 19 Bramerton Street, Chelsea, where he and Bernard lived for twenty-five years. A menu book was kept so that guests would not have the same dishes twice. Colour schemes were mostly strong, and in a corner there might be a large pot of flowering orchids. Paintings by Ivon Hitchens and Keith Vaughan were special features. Among the most famous of Dehn's and Bernard's friends were Terence Rattigan, John Gielgud, Lennox and Freda Berkeley, Michael Redgrave, William Walton, and Arthur Marshall. Dehn's earnings were of course considerable at times, but taxation in the 1950s was punitive. In one year Dehn wrote to <span class="italic">The Times</span> gently pointing out that he had had to pay &pound;80,000 in tax. Slightly built, good-looking with pale skin and long black eyelashes, a splendid host, witty and affectionate, Paul Dehn in obituaries was chiefly remembered as a superb writer of screenplays and lyricist; his work in the Special Operations Executive during the Second World War was virtually overlooked. Dehn would give ornithology as his hobby. He was a heavy smoker and developed lung cancer, from which he suffered for nearly two years. In the last year of his life he and Bernard moved to 18 Tite Street, Chelsea, London, where he died on 30 September 1976. He bequeathed his body to the Westminster Hospital for cancer research.<br>
<br>Dehn's sister (the second of the three siblings), <a name="cosubject_100311"></a><span class="headword">Olive Marie Dehn</span>  (1914&#150;2007), <span class="occ">poet and children's writer</span>, was born on 29 September 1914, also at 13 Belfield Road, Didsbury. Her contrariness developed early: at the age of four she proclaimed that she actually liked corners when told to stand in one. She was educated at a girls' school in Seaford, Sussex, an unhappy experience. By the age of eighteen she was already contributing to <span class="italic">Punch</span> and <span class="italic">Country Life</span>. In 1933, while staying in Germany with relatives, she wrote a satirical poem, &#145;Goebelchen (a Half-Aryan Ballad)&#146;, for <span class="italic">Punch</span>. She was promptly arrested and deported from the country under armed guard. Back in England she became an established writer, with stories for the BBC radio programme <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span>, poetry illustrated by E. H. Shepard, children's plays, and a notably successful book for children, <span class="italic">The Basement Bogle</span> (1935). On 5 June 1937 she married the actor (Peter) David Markham (1913&#150;1983); they had four daughters. During the Second World War her husband, a libertarian anarchist and pacifist, was sentenced to twelve months' hard labour as a conscientious objector. Olive Dehn shared his political beliefs, and like him joined the Committee of 100 soon after it was founded in 1960. She was also arrested with him in Moscow in 1974 and deported when, as founding members of the Campaign Against the Abuse of Psychiatry, they campaigned for the release of Soviet dissidents. She thus had the unusual distinction of having been deported by both the Nazis and the KGB. After the Second World War she and her husband had bought Lear Cottage, near Coleman's Hatch in Ashdown Forest, Sussex. There, in a clearing in the forest, they farmed organically, becoming largely self-sufficient, raising sheep, pigs, geese, and hens, growing a wide variety of fruit and vegetables, and taking pride in the prizes awarded for their animals and produce. Dehn continued to write, though she published less frequently. Her children's book <span class="italic">The Pike Dream</span> (1958), illustrated by her eldest daughter, Sonia, was a particular success, as was <span class="italic">Spectacles for the Mole</span> (1968). Her last children's story was <span class="italic">Goodbye Day</span> (1980). She continued to write poetry, and in 2006 published <span class="italic">Out of My Mind: Poems, 1929&#150;1995</span>. She died in Wych Cross, Sussex, on 21 March 2007, and was survived by her four daughters.<br>
