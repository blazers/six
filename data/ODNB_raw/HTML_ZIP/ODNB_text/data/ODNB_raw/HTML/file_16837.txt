<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Hugh</span>  (1546&#150;1601), <span class="occ">headmaster</span>, was born in Ll&#375;n, Caernarvonshire. Nothing is known of his parents but there were at least two other sons and a daughter of the marriage. He was elected a scholar of Winchester College in 1560, as was his brother John in 1574. They were only two of numerous Welshmen who entered the college in Elizabeth's reign, an upsurge perhaps resulting from the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> in 1536. He proceeded to New College, Oxford, in 1562, becoming a fellow in 1564. He graduated BA in 1566, BCL in 1570, and DCL in 1588. He married at an unknown date; nothing is known of his wife except that she survived him. He resigned his fellowship in 1578 on his appointment as chancellor of Rochester.<br>
<br>In 1579 Lloyd became vicar of Charlbury, Oxfordshire, and was elected headmaster of Winchester College. In the latter case he had attracted the support of Ambrose Dudley, earl of Warwick, who wrote to the warden and fellows of Winchester that his recommendation was hardly needed when Lloyd was &#145;so well known unto you all for his lyfe, religion, and learninge&#146;  (Winchester College muniment 23443). As headmaster his teaching of classics seems to have had a certain breadth: one of his pupils was John Owen, the noted writer of epigrams, and another was the poet and wit John Hoskins (whom Lloyd remembered in his will). Lloyd himself compiled <span class="italic">Phrases elegantiores ex Caesaris commentariis Cicerone, aliisque, in usum scholae Winton</span>, although this was not published until 1654.<br>
<br>In 1584 Lloyd was made a prebendary of St Paul's and in 1588 he resigned as headmaster on becoming rector of Islip, near Oxford. There he maintained his intellectual interests through contact with a number of academics, particularly from St John's College and New College. Two of them&#151;Ralph Hutchinson, the biblical scholar, and Anthony Ayleworth, regius professor of medicine&#151;were made his executors. Lloyd died on 17 October 1601 and was buried in the outer chapel of New College.<br>
