<span class="headword">Somerset <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Capel]</span>,  Mary</span>, duchess of Beaufort  (<em>bap. </em>1630, <em>d.</em> 1715), <span class="occ">gardener and botanist</span>, was baptized on 16 December 1630 at Hadham Parva, Hertfordshire, the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4583/', "Arthur Capel, first Baron Capel of Hadham (1604&#150;1649)")</script>, and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1661), daughter and heir of Sir Charles Morrison and his wife, Mary Hicks.<br>
<br>On 28 June 1648 Mary married Henry Seymour, Lord Beauchamp (<i>c</i>.1626&#150;1654), which short but happy union produced a son and a daughter. Like Mary's father, who died for his royalist sympathies, Lord Beauchamp spent time in the Tower for his support of Charles I.<br>
<br>The young widow married again, on 17 August 1657, opting for a &#145;republican&#146; marriage in front of a justice of the peace. Her groom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26009/', "Henry Somerset (1629&#150;1700)")</script>, then styled Lord Herbert, proved a second loving husband. They had many children: five sons, three of whom survived to adulthood, and four daughters, three of whom also survived, including the fourth, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6474/', "Anne Coventry")</script>. On 2 December 1682 Somerset was created duke of Beaufort.<br>
<br>About 1660 Henry Somerset inherited the Badminton estate from a female cousin and beginning in 1664 embarked on a major building project there. Mary, meanwhile, focused her attention on the gardens and by 1678 had installed conservatories, the fashion for which is sometimes credited to her brother Sir Henry Capel (<i>d</i>. 1696). The duchess also built almshouses and the Badminton School. In 1681 the Somersets bought a home in Chelsea, which they remodelled, and Mary once again took charge of the gardens.<br>
<br>From early 1699, for eighteen months, William Sherard (1659&#150;1728) was at Badminton as tutor to Mary's grandson. While there, through his correspondence with John Ray (1627&#150;1705), James Petiver (1664&#150;1718), Hans Sloane (1660&#150;1753), and others, he added 1500 plants to her collection. He believed that &#145;no place raises or preserves plants better&#146;  (BL, Sloane MS 4063, fol. 44), making Badminton a natural destination for exotic seeds, many of which were unknown elsewhere in Britain. After her husband's death in 1700 Mary redoubled her attentions to gardening and amassed thousands of exotic plants from around the globe. These rare specimens brought the duchess into correspondence with the foremost botanists of her time, linking her to a network of foreign suppliers and ensuring that her plants were identified and published. During this period she also collected insects.<br>
<br>Two illustrated albums of plants in Mary Somerset's gardens were produced by Kychique and Daniel Frankcom, who had visited Badminton between 1703 and 1705. Frankcom also viewed her Chelsea garden. These albums, in addition to the images, contain information about provenances and the treatment of particular plants in the dowager duchess's care.<br>
<br>In 1709 a suit was filed in chancery against Mary Somerset by her children, demanding the distribution of the balance of the late duke's personal estate. The initial ruling against her was overturned on appeal in 1710. The dowager duchess died on 7 January 1715 at Beaufort House in Chelsea, and was buried in St Michael and All Angels' Church, Badminton. She bequeathed her twelve-album herbarium to Sloane and it is now in the Natural History Museum. About twenty-five years after Mary's death, Sloane also bought Beaufort House, which he demolished. The duchess of Beaufort is commemorated in the genus <i>Beaufortia</i> of the myrtle family, several species of which are grown as ornamentals.<br>
