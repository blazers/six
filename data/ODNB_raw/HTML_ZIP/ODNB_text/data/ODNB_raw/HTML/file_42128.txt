<span class="headword">Williamson,  James</span>  (1855&#150;1933), <span class="occ">film-maker</span>, was born on 8 November 1855 at Pathhead, Dysart, near Kirkcaldy, Fife, the illegitimate son of Janet Williamson (<i>b</i>. 1822/3), a domestic servant. Raised in Edinburgh, he later moved to London to train as a master chemist. In 1877 he found employment as an apprentice chemist at Eastry, Kent. He had purchased the chemist's shop from his employer by 1881, and on 9 August that year married Betsy, daughter of Thomas Heaysman, a gardener. They had four sons and three daughters. In 1886 the family moved to new premises at 144 Church Road, Hove, Sussex. During the next decade Williamson developed a keen interest in photography and optical entertainments and, as a Kodak agent, he acquired a good understanding of the technical and chemical nature of photography. In 1896 he introduced X-ray photography to Sussex and began to make regular trips with the apparatus to the county hospital. The year also saw him become involved with moving pictures, as he introduced the first programme of films to the camera club at Hove town hall in November.<br>
<br>Williamson began to make his own films, or animated photographs, in 1897. His first catalogue of 1899 listed sixty films, each usually single shots between 60 and 75 feet in length. Williamson did not produce his first edited multi-shot narrative film until his <span class="italic">Attack on a China Mission</span> (1900). This four-shot film of 230 feet, his longest film to date, was made in the autumn of 1900 and came after a summer of inspired film-making by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42132/', "George Albert Smith (1864&#150;1959)")</script>, his Hove friend and counterpart. It is in the context of Smith's active development of English film form that Williamson conceived and executed this film. Its appearance marks his move from &#145;non-continuous&#146; to &#145;continuous&#146; narrative. <span class="italic">Attack on a China Mission</span> was a new model for film realism as it was founded on naturalistic acting, a real location, and a linear structure which worked to bring the viewer into the fictional world. The events in China in 1900 informed the making of the film and its reception. The majority of the film's viewers presumably experienced pleasure and comfort from this rescue narrative because of its dramatic energy and its evocative and topical representation of the Boxer uprising.<br>
<br>Williamson's next significant multi-shot film, <span class="italic">Fire!</span> (1901), was shot on the streets of Hove. It showed a wide familiarity with the &#145;fire dramas&#146; found in the theatre, magic lantern lectures, newspaper reports, and other &#145;fire&#146; films. Like <span class="italic">Attack on a China Mission</span>, <span class="italic">Fire!</span> reflected Williamson's understanding of the rescue narrative and his ambition to find the means to develop a more complex and arresting film structure; and in this he was largely successful, across 280 feet and five shots. By designing a work of fiction which employed the apparatus and staff of a real fire brigade, used locations, a set, and careful shot construction, allied to a clear editing strategy, Williamson created a film which was simple in form yet radical for its time. Williamson's subsequent social dramas <span class="italic">The Soldier's Return</span> (1902) and <span class="italic">A Reservist before the War and after the War</span> (1902) and his ingenious trick films, especially <span class="italic">A Big Swallow</span> (1901), continued this spirit of innovation.<br>
<br>A growing commitment to film production became central to Williamson's life. This process began in 1898, when he moved his chemist's shop to 55 Western Road, Hove. The size of this new property and its close proximity to Smith's &#145;film factory&#146; at St Ann's Well enabled him to concentrate on film processing and film production. By 1902 the Williamson Kinematographic Company opened its first purpose-built film production studio and film processing works at Cambridge Grove, off Wilbury Road. Williamson was now a professional &#145;animated photographer&#146; and no longer a high street chemist. This site also furnished the family with a detached house. Williamson's wife and children played a distinctive role in the new business by participating in the creation of scenarios, by making sets and costumes, and by taking both small and major acting roles. Tom Williamson's part in <span class="italic">Our New Errand Boy</span> (1905), as the anarchic boy upsetting the pillars of society, expresses this enthusiasm for film-making and his father's provocative imagination. The eldest son, Alan, would become more involved in the company's business affairs, and was responsible for the opening of its New York office in 1907.<br>
<br>Williamson began to withdraw from film production in 1909 as a result of changes in the world film market. In 1910 he sold his studio and premises in Hove and moved to London. The company now devoted itself to film processing and the manufacture of cameras and printers. The Williamson apparatus acquired an excellent reputation and was used worldwide. His last years were spent in his neo-Tudor mansion at Mortlake, Surrey, where he would conduct experiments with colour photography. Williamson died on 18 August 1933 at his home, 593 Upper Richmond Road, Mortlake, following a heart attack while in his bath. His wife survived him.<br>
