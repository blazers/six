<span class="headword">Stevenson,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>1778, <em>d.</em> in or after 1844), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, son of Joseph and Deborah Stevenson, was baptized at Kegworth, Leicestershire, on 13 March 1778. He was educated privately, and was apprenticed to his father, a surgeon, at the age of sixteen. Three years later he was sent to the united hospitals of St Thomas's and Guy's, London, where he stayed until 1800. It is probable that his medical studies were much interrupted by ill health, for he was not admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons until 20 November 1807. On account of his health he determined to devote himself to ophthalmic surgery. After studying for some time under John Cunningham Saunders, the oculist, he settled in or near Nottingham. The death of Saunders in 1810 led Stevenson to return to London, where he commenced to practise.<br>
<br>In 1813 Stevenson was oculist and aurist to the princess of Wales, and to Leopold, duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld; he was then living in Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury. He delivered the anniversary oration at the Medical Society of London in March 1817, taking as his subject the treatment of gutta serena. He founded in 1830, at 13 Little Portland Street, Cavendish Square, the Royal Infirmary for Cataract, and he was soon afterwards appointed oculist and aurist to William IV. Stevenson operated on cases of cataract at an earlier period than was thought advisable by other surgeons, and his infirmary was founded with the express design of carrying out his mode of treatment. He published several books on this subject: the first, <span class="italic">On the Morbid Sensibility of the Eye, Commonly Called Weakness of Sight</span> (1810), was criticized for plagiarism  (<span class="italic">Medical and Physical Journal</span>, 77&#150;80), but went through several editions up to 1841. Likewise, his <span class="italic">Deafness, its Causes, Prevention and Cure</span> (1828) &#145;offered nothing new&#146;  (Politzer, 277). Stevenson's <span class="italic">Practical Treatise on Cataract</span> (1813), however, had reached its seventh edition by 1843.<br>
<br>In 1841 Stevenson became oculist and aurist to Leopold I, king of the Belgians. Until mid-1844 he was living at 38 Conduit Street, London, and at Norwood Park, Middlesex. All trace of him is lost after this year.<br>
