<span class="headword">Howard,  Charles</span>  (1630&#150;1713), <span class="occ">landowner and natural philosopher</span>, was born on 13 September 1630, the fourth son in the family of nine sons and three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13915/', "Henry Frederick Howard, fifteenth earl of Arundel (1608&#150;1652)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Stuart (<i>d</i>. 1674), daughter of Esm&eacute;, earl of March and later third duke of Lennox.<br>
<br>In the late 1640s and early 1650s Howard spent time in France and the Netherlands. In 1652, on the death of his father, he inherited the estate of Deepdene, near Dorking, Surrey, and thereafter he devoted much effort to its beautification, constructing an elaborate Italianate garden of the kind popular in seventeenth-century England, with terraces landscaped on a U-shaped hillside, and with appendages including a laboratory. The garden was admired by John Evelyn in 1655, while John Aubrey gave a lengthy illustrated account of the estate in his <span class="italic">Perambulation of Surrey</span> (1673). The remains of Howard's landscaping are still to be seen at Deepdene; a further surviving relic of his horticultural activities there is provided by his herbarium, dated 1660, now at Arundel Castle. In the 1650s Howard evidently also developed an interest in industrial practices, and on 27 October 1660 he applied for a patent for a new method of tanning, the subject of a printed broadsheet, <span class="italic">Brief Directions how to Tanne Leather According to a New Invention</span> [n.d.].<br>
<br>On 24 December 1662 Howard was elected a fellow of the Royal Society; he almost immediately began to participate in its proceedings, taking a special interest in agrarian and technological matters. Various of the committees on such topics that the society instituted in 1663 and 1664 met at his lodgings at Arundel House, notably the agricultural or georgical committee. Howard's own contribution to the latter particularly concerned kitchen gardens and winter greens. In addition, a paper by him on the cultivation of saffron was published in the society's <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> in 1678 (a paper on his novel tanning technique had appeared there in 1674). In 1678 he applied for a patent for a new way of processing flax, which may have been related to investigations of this topic made under the society's auspices in the 1660s.<br>
<br>In the early 1680s Howard was twice involved in the public arena. In 1681 he was the victim of blackmail involving Titus Oates. More importantly, Howard engaged in protracted litigation against his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13907/', "Henry Howard, sixth duke of Norfolk")</script>, concerning the estate of Greystoke in Cumberland. His father had provided for this property to pass to Charles if his brother inherited the earldom of Arundel; but when this occurred in 1677 Henry refused to give up the estate, and Charles took the case to chancery, in 1682 obtaining a celebrated decision in his favour by Heneage Finch, first earl of Nottingham. This was challenged by his brother, however, and reversed by the lord keeper, Francis North, first Baron Guilford; the case continued after Henry's death and the succession to the dukedom of Charles's nephew, Henry. The issue was finally resolved in Charles's favour in the House of Lords in June 1685.<br>
<br>In his later years Howard seems increasingly to have retired from public life. His attendance at the Royal Society dwindled after the early 1670s, and he evidently divided his time between London and Deepdene, devoting himself to horticultural, alchemical, and other pursuits. His wife, Mary, daughter of George Tattershall of Finchampstead, Berkshire, whom he had married in the early 1660s, died on 7 November 1695, and Howard himself died on 31 March 1713; both were buried in Dorking church. As laid down in the will that he had made on 29 April 1696, revising an earlier one dated 13 July 1685, in which his wife had been named as his sole heir, Howard's estates were inherited by his only surviving child, Henry Charles Howard (<i>b</i>. 18 Oct 1668); from him they descended to his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13890/', "Charles Howard")</script>, who became tenth duke of Norfolk in 1777.<br>
