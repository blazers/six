<span class="headword">Taylor, Sir  Herbert</span>  (1775&#150;1839), <span class="occ">courtier and army officer</span>, second son of the Revd Edward Taylor (1734&#150;1798), of Bifrons, Kent, rector of Patrixbourne, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1780?), daughter of Thomas Payler of Ileden, Kent, was born on 29 September 1775 at Bifrons. He was educated privately on the continent between 1780 and 1790, and became a good linguist. Through Lord Camelford and Lord Grenville, he was employed in the Foreign Office under James Bland Burgess. His knowledge of foreign languages made him very useful, and Lord Grenville occasionally employed him on confidential work at his own house. In December 1792 Taylor accompanied Sir James Murray (afterwards Murray-Pulteney) on a special mission to the Prussian headquarters at Frankfurt. After a few weeks Murray left Frankfurt to take up his military duties as adjutant-general to the duke of York's army at Antwerp, and Taylor remained behind for a short time in charge of the mission. In April 1793, he joined the army headquarters where Murray presented him to the duke of York, to whom he became greatly attached. He was employed as Murray's secretary, and was present as a volunteer at the action of St Amand (8 May), the battle of Famars (23 May), and the sieges of Valenciennes and Dunkirk.<br>
<br>On 25 March 1794 Taylor was given a commission as cornet in the 2nd dragoon guards, and in July was promoted to be lieutenant. On Murray's return to England, Taylor remained with the duke of York as assistant secretary. He generally joined his regiment when in the field, and was present at the April actions near Cateau Cambr&eacute;sis, those near Tournai in May, and at other operations of the campaign, including the retreat into the Netherlands. In May 1795 he was promoted to be captain in the 2nd dragoon guards. When the duke of York returned to England, Taylor remained with the army as assistant secretary to the commander-in-chief of the British forces on the continent, and served in that capacity successively with Lieutenant-General Harcourt and Sir David Dundas.<br>
<br>On 16 September 1795 Taylor returned to England, having been appointed aide-de-camp to the duke of York. He was soon afterwards nominated assistant military secretary in the commander-in-chief's office. In July 1798 he accompanied Lord Cornwallis to Ireland on the latter's appointment as lord lieutenant, in the threefold capacity of aide-de-camp, military secretary, and private secretary. Cornwallis described him as &#145;indefatigable in business; and in honesty, fidelity and goodness of heart he has no superior&#146;  (<span class="italic">Taylor Papers</span>, 56). He returned to England in February 1799 to take over the duties of private secretary to the duke of York. He went to the Netherlands as aide-de-camp to the duke in the expedition to The Helder in September, and was present at several battles.<br>
<br>In January 1801 Taylor was promoted to be major in the 2nd dragoon guards, and in December of the same year to be lieutenant-colonel in the 9th West India regiment. On 25 June 1802 he was placed on half pay, and on 25 May was brought into the Coldstream Guards, of which the duke of York was colonel. He rose to the rank of lieutenant-general in 1825. He continued in the appointment of private secretary and aide-de-camp to the duke until 13 June 1805, when he was appointed private secretary to the king. The king placed every confidence in him, so that his position was one of great delicacy, but his straightforwardness secured the good opinion of all. On the establishment of the regency he continued in the same office to the queen, who was appointed by act of parliament guardian of the king's person. By the same act Taylor was appointed one of the three commissioners of the king's real and personal estate.<br>
<br>In November 1813 Taylor was appointed to command a brigade in the army of Sir Thomas Graham (afterwards Lord Lynedoch), which was besieging Antwerp. He returned to England in March 1814, when he was sent on special military missions to Bernadotte, crown prince of Sweden (then commanding the Swedish force in Germany), and to The Hague. During these absences from the court his place was taken by his brother <a href="#cosubject_27020">Brook Taylor [<i>see below</i>]</a>. He resumed the duties of private secretary to Queen Charlotte on his return, and continued in this office until her death in November 1818. In 1819 he was made a knight of the Royal Guelphic Order, and on 5 October of the same year he married Charlotte Albinia, daughter of Edward Disbrowe of Walton Hall, Derbyshire, vice-chamberlain to Queen Charlotte, and granddaughter of the third earl of Buckingham; they had two daughters.<br>
<br>From 1820 to 1823 Taylor represented Windsor in parliament, resigning his seat because he found he could not satisfactorily fulfil both his parliamentary and his other duties. On 25 March 1820 he was appointed military secretary at the Horse Guards, and in 1824 he was made a knight grand cross of the Royal Guelphic Order. In January 1827 he was appointed military secretary to the new commander-in-chief, the duke of Wellington; but on the duke resigning in July 1827, Taylor was nominated by Lord Palmerston to be a deputy secretary at war in the military branch of the War Office; the king had already made him his first and principal aide-de-camp.<br>
<br>On 19 March 1828 Taylor was appointed master surveyor and surveyor-general of the ordnance of the United Kingdom. On 25 August of the same year he became adjutant-general of the forces, an appointment which he held until the accession of William IV, to whom he became private secretary, and continued in that office during the whole of the reign. He played a significant part as mediator between the king and the government during the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> crisis.<br>
<br>On 16 April 1834 Taylor was awarded the grand cross in the Order of the Bath. On the death of William IV in 1837 he retired into private life, but remained first and principal aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria. He had already received from George III a pension of &pound;1000 a year on the civil list, with remainder to his widow. In the spring of 1838 he went to Italy, and he died at Rome on 20 March 1839. His body was embalmed for conveyance to England, but was buried in the protestant cemetery at Rome. In the middle of April his remains were exhumed and sent to England, and on 13 June were deposited in a vault of the chapel of St Katherine's Hospital, Regent's Park, London, to the mastership of which he had been appointed in 1818 by Queen Charlotte.<br>
<br>Taylor, who was a confidential friend of the duke of York and his go-between in the financial negotiations with Mary Anne Clarke, wrote the <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Last Illness and Decease of HRH the Duke of York</span> (1827). He was prepared to go to lengths to defend the royal family's reputation. As one of York's executors he defended what was left of York's estate from the attempts of York's many creditors to recover their lost money, directing enquirers to pursue their case in the court of chancery. On behalf of George IV between 1828 and 1830 he negotiated with Captain Thomas Garth, son of the king's sister Sophia, to obtain papers from Garth that allegedly revealed secrets about Garth's parentage damaging to the royal family; Taylor was said to have paid the scandalous journalist Charles Molloy Westmacott &pound;5000 for his help in overcoming Garth.<br>
<br>Taylor's younger brother, <a name="cosubject_27020"></a><span class="headword">Sir Brook Taylor</span>  (1776&#150;1846)<span class="occ"></span>, joined the diplomatic service under the patronage of Lord Grenville, and was British minister to Cologne and Hesse-Cassel in 1801&#150;6, to Denmark in 1807, to W&uuml;rttemberg in 1814&#150;20 and to Bavaria in 1820&#150;28. He was minister at Berlin in 1828&#150;31, and was created GCH in 1822 and sworn of the privy council in 1828. He died, unmarried, at Eaton Place, London, on 15 October 1846.<br>
