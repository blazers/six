<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ramsay, Sir  William</span>  (1852&#150;1916), <span class="occ">physical chemist</span>, was born on 2 October 1852 at 2 Queen's Crescent, Glasgow, the only child of William Ramsay (1811&#150;1887), civil engineer and later surveyor to the Scottish Union Insurance Company, and his wife, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1891), daughter of Dr Archibald Robertson of Edinburgh, who was a governess before her marriage. On his father's side he was descended from a long line of chemist-dyers, and on his mother's side, physicians; both of his grandfathers published works on chemistry. His father had a good general knowledge of science and mathematics, while his uncle was the well-known geologist Sir Andrew Crombie Ramsay (1814&#150;1891). Ramsay's own scientific interests developed at an early age, and despite his mother's initial intention that he should enter the Calvinist ministry, he had by the age of sixteen decided to become a chemist.<br>
<br>When he was about six Ramsay was sent to a preparatory school kept by a Mr Stark. In 1862 he entered the Glasgow Academy, and four years later he matriculated at the University of Glasgow, where he studied classics, English literature, logic, and mathematics. In May 1869 he began to work in the laboratory of the city analyst, Robert Tatlock, as the university could not provide a full course of instruction for students who wished to take up chemistry as a profession. During the next eighteen months he continued as a pupil of Tatlock, while attending university lectures on physics, chemistry, anatomy, and geology; he did not take a degree.<br>
<br>In October 1870 Ramsay went to Heidelberg, intending to study under Robert Bunsen, but decided to return to Glasgow for the winter. In April of the following year he entered the laboratory of the organic chemist Rudolf Fittig, in T&uuml;bingen, where he worked on the toluic and nitrotoluic acids; in August 1872 he received the PhD degree at T&uuml;bingen. In October he was appointed assistant in the Young Laboratory of Technical Chemistry at Anderson's College, Glasgow. In 1874 he became tutorial assistant to Professor John Ferguson in the chemistry department of the University of Glasgow, and carried out research in organic chemistry. He synthesized pyridine and a variety of pyridinic acids  (<span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>, 1876, 1877), and showed the connection between the alkaloids and pyridine  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Chemical Society</span>, 1877, 1879).<br>
<br>Ramsay's interest in physico-chemical problems grew out of his studies of the molecular volumes of elements at their boiling points, begun in 1879, and he continued this work after he was appointed professor of chemistry at University College, Bristol, in 1880. In 1882 Sydney Young became his assistant, and together they published over thirty papers on vapour pressure, the critical states of liquids, evaporation, and dissociation. The work required the design and construction of novel apparatus and a high degree of manipulative skill, and helped to establish the foundations for Ramsay's later experimental researches on gases.<br>
<br>On 3 August 1881 Ramsay married Margaret Johnstone Marshall (<i>d</i>. 1936), daughter of George Stevenson Buchanan of Glasgow. They had two children: Elizabeth Catherine (1883&#150;1960), known as Elska, who married H. L. Tidy in 1906; and William George (1886&#150;1927), who died early of disseminated sclerosis. In September 1881 Ramsay was appointed principal of University College, Bristol, in succession to Alfred Marshall. In that capacity he was instrumental in the successful movement to obtain government funding for the university colleges. He combined the post with his duties as professor until 1887 when, at the retirement of A. W. Williamson, he was elected to the chair of general chemistry at University College, London.<br>
<br>In London Ramsay continued his research on critical states, with John Shields and others. He studied the variation of surface tension with temperature, confirming a linear relationship between them, and used the results to deduce the molecular complexity of associating liquids. During this period he became a strong proponent of the osmotic-ionic theories of van't Hoff, Arrhenius, and Ostwald, and helped to ease the introduction of the new physical chemistry to Britain. By 1894 his laboratory had become a centre of research activity and he had firmly established his reputation as a physical chemist.<br>
<br>In 1894 Ramsay began his most important research, on the seemingly chemically inert, monatomic, elemental gases. The physicist J. W. Strutt (Lord Rayleigh) had found that the density of atmospheric nitrogen was consistently higher than that of chemically pure nitrogen, a discrepancy first noted by Henry Cavendish in 1785. Ramsay thought that this might be due to a heavy gas in atmospheric nitrogen, while Rayleigh ascribed it to a light gas in chemical nitrogen. Throughout the summer of 1894 they worked to find the source of the anomaly, using two different methods. Ramsay removed oxygen, water vapour, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen from air, the crucial step being the absorption of nitrogen by red-hot magnesium, and was left with a residue which appeared to be a new element. Rayleigh too had been partially successful, and in August 1894 they made a joint announcement at the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. They named the new gas argon, from the Greek word meaning &#145;idle&#146;, and formally presented their results to the Royal Society in January 1895  (<span class="italic">PRS</span>, 1895). Later that year they were awarded the Smithsonian Institution's Hodgkins prize, given for the most important discovery concerning atmospheric air.<br>
<br>In February 1895 Henry Miers called Ramsay's attention to the work of W. F. Hillebrand of the United States Geological Survey, who had found that two uranite minerals, pitchblende and cleveite, gave off a considerable amount of gas when heated. Ramsay, seeking to determine whether the gas contained argon, repeated the experiments with cleveite and was able to isolate another inert elementary gas in March  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Chemical Society</span>, 1895). Spectrum analysis showed that it was identical with the element helium, which had in 1868 been spectroscopically detected in the sun's atmosphere by the astronomer J. N. Lockyer (who named it) and the chemist Edward Frankland, but had hitherto been terrestrially unknown.<br>
<br>It had earlier occurred to Ramsay that there was room in the periodic table for a new, eighth, group of elements. The discovery of helium increased the likelihood that further &#145;inert&#146; gases might exist, and in his book <span class="italic">The Gases of the Atmosphere</span> (1896; 4th edn., 1915), he reproduced the periodic table with spaces reserved for several new elements. He made his ideas public in his presidential address, entitled &#145;An undiscovered gas&#146;, to the Chemistry Section of the 1897 British Association meeting in Toronto, predicting the existence of at least one other gaseous element whose atomic weight would lie between those of helium and argon. Working with his student Morris W. Travers from April 1895, Ramsay searched for further sources of both gases, and attempted to make them combine with other substances; J. N. Collie, Ramsay's assistant, worked with them until he left University College in 1896. Their discovery that thorium and uranium minerals produce helium was explained by subsequent developments in the study of radioactivity.<br>
<br>Ramsay refined his experimental techniques during the work on helium, learning to manipulate increasingly small quantities of gas; he and Travers, both skilled glass-blowers, designed and constructed all the apparatus that they used. In 1898 they began to look for a third new element by liquefying argon and subjecting it to fractional distillation, a method made possible by William Hampson's independent development of a liquefaction process; Ramsay was on bad terms with James Dewar, who had pioneered the technology of liquid air.<br>
<br>In May 1898, as a preliminary trial, Ramsay and Travers allowed a small quantity of liquid air to evaporate slowly, and collected the least volatile fraction. After removal of oxygen and nitrogen, spectroscopic examination of the residue showed the presence of an unknown gas, which they named krypton (hidden). It was heavier than argon, and was thus not the gas they had been looking for. They then condensed 15 litres of argon and collected the most volatile fraction; spectrum analysis revealed that they had found the light gas, which they named neon (new). In July they found that the heavy fraction of liquid air contained a gas more dense than krypton; in September they announced the discovery of xenon (stranger). Ramsay and Travers spent the next two years isolating the gases and determining their properties, thereby confirming the existence of a new group of elements in the periodic table  (<span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 1901). In 1904 Ramsay became the first British recipient of the Nobel prize for chemistry, in recognition of this unique achievement.<br>
<br>In 1903, working with Frederick Soddy, Ramsay observed the spectrum of helium in the gaseous emanation from radium (radon), thus providing experimental evidence for Rutherford's theory of radioactive disintegration. Rutherford and Soddy had earlier shown that radon was probably a sixth member of the family of inert gases; in 1910 Ramsay and Robert Whytlaw-Gray confirmed this by determining its physical properties from minute samples  (<span class="italic">PRS</span>, 1911). In showing that its atomic weight differed from that of radium by the mass of one helium atom, they provided further proof that &#945;-particles emitted during radioactive decay were helium nuclei. Ramsay's research in the field of radioactivity was not always so fruitful: after 1905 he performed many unsuccessful experiments in attempts to discover whether chemical or physical means could cause the transmutation of elements.<br>
<br>Ramsay was a man of many interests. He was concerned by the state of science education in Britain and was the first to write textbooks based on the periodic system of classification&#151;<span class="italic">A System of Inorganic Chemistry</span> and <span class="italic">Elementary Systematic Chemistry for the Use of Schools and Colleges</span> (both 1891). Throughout the 1890s he was involved in the movement to reorganize the University of London, which had been an examining body independent of the London colleges; he was a strong supporter of the role of research and teaching in a modern university. In 1900 he went to India at the invitation of J. N. Tata, who proposed to endow a technical research institution; he advised that it be sited in Bangalore, where the Indian Institute of Science was eventually established with Travers as its first director.<br>
<br>At about this time Ramsay began to write magazine articles of a semi-popular nature, a selection of which were published in his <span class="italic">Essays Biographical and Chemical</span> (1908). For many years he acted as a consultant to industry, advising on a wide range of chemical matters and appearing as an expert witness in several court cases. He was a member of the royal commission on sewage disposal (1898&#150;1915), chemical adviser to the British Radium Corporation (1909&#150;12), and a director on the boards of two short-lived chemical companies. After the turn of the century these commitments took up increasing amounts of his time.<br>
<br>Ramsay received many awards and honorary degrees, and was elected a member of scientific societies in twenty countries. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1888 and awarded its Davy medal in 1895; in 1897 he received the Longstaff medal from the Chemical Society, of which he was president in 1907&#150;9. He served three terms as a vice-president of the Institute of Chemistry, and was president of the Society of Chemical Industry (1903&#150;4), the International Congress of Applied Chemistry (1909), and the British Association (1911). He was created KCB in 1902, was awarded the Prussian order of merit (1911), was an officer of the French L&eacute;gion d'honneur, and a commander of the order of the Corona d'Italia.<br>
<br>Ramsay was loved by his students, who affectionately called him &#145;the Chief&#146;. He was unfailingly optimistic and enthusiastic; colleagues found him charming, witty, and generous. He had an aptitude for languages and music, and enjoyed travel and outdoor activities. At his retirement, in 1912, he was the most famous British chemist of the day. After moving to Hazlemere, near High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, he continued to work from his home, Beechcroft, and was engaged in work connected to the war effort when he died there of cancer on 23 July 1916. He was buried at Holy Trinity Church, Hazlemere, on 26 July.<br>
