<span class="headword">Boucher,  John</span>  (1819&#150;1878), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister</span>, was born in Moneyreagh, co. Down, the son of David Boucher, a tenant farmer. His educational history is obscure, owing in part to the complex and unfortunately only spottily documented history of the Belfast Academical Institution, from which he was accorded the general certificate from the college department in 1837. He may then have pursued further theological instruction from Henry Montgomery (1788&#150;1865) and John Scott Porter, both of whom had since 1832 lectured to students intended for the non-subscribing ministry and who in 1838 were appointed unpaid professors of divinity to, respectively, the Remonstrant Synod and the presbytery of Antrim, bodies representing the latitudinarian wing of a badly fractured Irish presbyterianism. The Arianism of the latitudinarians&#151;their view, that is, of a limited divinity of Christ as against the full-blooded Trinitarianism of their conservative opponents&#151;easily progressed into belief in the simple humanitarianism of Jesus, and a number of younger remonstrants took up Unitarian pulpits in England.<br>
<br>In 1842 Boucher moved to England and in 1844 he became minister at Union Street, Glasgow, where he healed the serious congregational rift resulting from the extreme theological radicalism of his predecessor, John Taylor (1812&#150;1853), increased attendance, and undertook an only partially successful fund-raising tour in England and Ireland. Boucher's success in Glasgow brought an invitation in September 1846 from the New Gravel Pit Chapel in Hackney, which had been in decline (and some confusion) since the death in 1845 of its pastor of nearly forty years, Robert Aspland. Here, too, Boucher overcame congregational divisions (he had been invited on a split vote of 82&#150;79) and increased both numbers and morale. Rationalistic in outlook at the start, Boucher began to move towards more orthodox positions. A sermon preached in 1852 called into question the central nonconformist principle of private judgement in religious matters. While he retained the votes of a majority of the congregation, he had lost support among the subscribers to the chapel's funds, and his resignation came as a matter of course.<br>
<br>On 9 January 1850 Boucher married Louise (1822/3&#150;1879), daughter of Ebenezer Johnston (<i>d</i>. 1850) of Stamford Hill, London; a son and a daughter survived him. His pastorate ended, they moved to Chesterton, Cambridgeshire, and in Easter term 1853 Boucher matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge. He took a first in the moral sciences tripos in 1856 and proceeded BA the next year. His health broke, however, and he had to abandon his intention of taking Anglican orders. He lived on in Chesterton, an invalid, until his death on 12 March 1878.<br>
