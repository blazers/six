<span class="headword">Manby,  Peter</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1697), <span class="occ">dean of Derry and religious controversialist</span>, was of unknown parents and background. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, and took orders in the Church of Ireland before 1660, when he became a minor canon at St Patrick's, Dublin. In 1666 he became chancellor of that church. He found favour with Dr Michael Boyle, archbishop of Dublin, who made him his chaplain and promoted him to a canonry at Kildare Cathedral in 1670. Manby became dean of Derry in 1672. Little is known of his personal life at this time beyond that he married a wife, Mary, and started a family. He published some unremarkable sermons and hoped for promotion to a bishopric.<br>
<br>In 1687 Manby became notorious when he published <span class="italic">The Considerations which Obliged Peter Manby, Dean of Derry, to Embrace the Catholique Religion</span>. His stated reasons for converting included concerns about the lack of authority of the reformers at the English Reformation, a commitment to confession which he saw as a shocking omission in protestantism, and, finally, an insistence that Catholicism was not to be reviled as idolatrous since it was the origin of the Anglican religion. Manby declared that there was much to be admired in Catholic writings and credited the mass as the ultimate inspiration for his conversion. There was nothing original in Manby's arguments, but his timing, his position, and some of his recent activities caused a stir. He fully expected that protestant readers would attack him, and he was not disappointed. William King, then chancellor of St Patrick's, Dublin, his most tenacious and cynical critic, challenged Manby's motives. King accused him of converting because he had not received a promotion and because he was an informer to James II's Catholic court. King's criticisms were justified. In 1686 the dissatisfied Manby had come to the attention of James, who took a personal interest in his case. Manby was to provide a prominent example of the advantages to be had when embracing Catholicism and openly supporting James. The state papers reveal that Manby received James's protection when he turned informer, and that James wished to reward Manby for his services. The king arranged for the proceeds from the deanery of Derry be paid to the exchequer, which would then pay an allowance to Manby, who, &#145;being a married man&#146;, could not be given a living in the Catholic church. By April 1687 this plan had changed, and Manby was given a royal dispensation &#145;to hold the said deanery with all rights, profits and advantages, any law, statute or custom to the contrary notwithstanding&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1686&#150;7</i>, 415).<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Manby responded to King's attacks with <span class="italic">A Reformed Catechism in Two Dialogues</span> (1687), in which he attempted to use the writings of protestant historians of the Reformation to prove the validity of his conversion. King and others were still not convinced of his sincerity. Manby repeated his themes in <span class="italic">Some Queries Humbly Offered to the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury</span> in 1688. James II continued to favour Manby and made him an alderman of Londonderry as part of a scheme to increase the Catholic presence in the local government of Ireland. When James brought his army to Ireland in 1688 Manby's position in Londonderry became untenable. He was not present at the famous siege of the town in 1688&#150;9, and he fled to France with James's forces after the battle of the Boyne in 1690. Manby died in London in 1697 attended by the prominent Catholic scholar Cornelius Nary. The fate of his immediate family is unknown. Although his writings were heavily criticized and his motives were questioned by his opponents, Manby managed to inspire others to convert. His brother, Robert, left the established church to become a friar, and both Robert's sons joined the Society of Jesus. One of these sons, <a name="cosubject_17921"></a><span class="headword">Peter Manby</span>  (<em>b. </em>1681)<span class="occ"></span>, was born in Leinster and educated at the University of Coimbra. He had returned to Ireland by 1724, when he published <span class="italic">Remarks on Dr Loyd's Translation of the Montpelier Catechism</span> in Dublin, arguing that the catechism contained the condemned propositions of Jansenius and Quesnel. His date of death is unknown.<br>
