<span class="headword">Mardisley,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1350&#150;1375), <span class="occ">Franciscan friar and theologian</span>, was probably born in the 1320s, and entered the order at its Oxford convent. He studied in Oxford in the 1340s and became doctor of theology soon after 1350. By 1355 he was a member of the York convent; probably in that year he disputed there with the Dominican William Jordan in the chapter house and the chancellor's school on the subject of the conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Given these locations, this must have been intended as a formal academic exercise, but Mardisley seems to have attracted bitter criticism for his opinions, from Jordan himself and other observers, and the chapter at York found it necessary to issue letters exonerating him. Mardisley seems to have followed up his verbal defence of this doctrine with a written exposition of his arguments; it was known to Bale but no longer survives.<br>
<br>Scarcely more than a year later he had become involved in further controversy, joining another Franciscan, Roger Conway (<i>d</i>. 1360), in replying to Richard Fitzralph's attacks on the mendicants. Mardisley's growing reputation as an outspoken theologian may explain his appointment in May 1374, together with a Dominican and a Benedictine, to deliberate at a great council in Westminster Hall over the right of the pope to interfere in temporal affairs in England. The meeting of the council, and Mardisley's contribution, is discussed in some detail in a contemporary chronicle, the <span class="italic">Eulogium historiarum</span>, compiled by a monk of Glastonbury. The Dominican refused to answer, and the Benedictine, Uthred Boldon (<i>d</i>. 1397), resolutely defended papal authority. Mardisley gave a more detailed answer, and somewhat surprisingly, given his status, upheld the claims of the crown that Christ conferred only spiritual rule on Peter, not earthly dominion. His argument can be seen as an attempt by the English Franciscans to improve their political position and to win royal favour. The drama of the scene and the uncompromising nature of the dialogue led earlier historians to assume that the entire episode was fictional, contrived by the chronicler in order to raise some important and controversial issues, but it has since been shown to have taken place.<br>
<br>Mardisley was elected minister provincial of the order in England in 1375. He resigned his office towards the end of the 1370s, and probably died at the York convent within a decade and was buried there. Bale suggests he died in 1376, but his evidence for this is obscure. Several theological works have been attributed to Mardisley, but none is known to survive. A commentary on the <span class="italic">Sentences</span> of Peter Lombard which survives in Padua, MS Antoniana IX 159, was for some time thought to be the work of Mardisley, but is now believed to be the work of another author.<br>
