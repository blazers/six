<span class="headword">Cunningham,  David</span>  (<em>c.</em>1540&#150;1600), <span class="occ">bishop of Aberdeen</span>, is of uncertain parentage&#151;his father may have been William Cunningham of Cunninghamhead. Although the identification cannot be taken as certain, he was probably the David Cunningham who was incorporated in St Leonard's College, St Andrews, by 25 March 1557, and who graduated MA between 23 November 1560 and 6 November 1562&#151;most probably in 1561. These dates suggest that he was born about 1540. There is no doubt that he studied in France, first in Paris, and then at Bourges, where he read civil law. He clearly found no difficulty in accepting protestantism, for by 1562 he had become minister of Lanark. Under a contract of 20 December 1569 he married Katherine Wallace. In November 1570 he was transferred to the parish of Lesmahagow, and two years later to that of Cadder. In 1573 he was mentioned as minister of Monkland, and in 1574 he was also in charge of Lenzie.<br>
<br>In 1573 the general assembly elected Cunningham to the committee that formulated instructions for the assembly's commissioners in their forthcoming negotiations with the regent and the privy council concerning the remuneration of ministers. Two years later the assembly nominated Cunningham and three others to review the election of George Douglas as bishop of Moray, and in 1576 he was appointed to a committee to investigate the state of the kirk in Ayrshire, Clydesdale, and Lennox. The committee's report was drafted by Cunningham, who in that same year was also elected to a committee chosen to prepare the assembly's answers to questions from the government. In the meantime Cunningham was also one of several ministers who helped Andrew Melville with preparing the second <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span>. Melville had introduced reforms at Glasgow University from 1574, and probably facilitated Cunningham's translation to Glasgow, where in 1576 he was dean of the faculty of arts and subdean in the cathedral. The government appointed him in 1584 to perform the principal's duties, until the position was filled by Patrick Sharp at the beginning of 1586.<br>
<br>In 1576 Patrick Adamson, minister of Paisley and Regent Morton's chaplain, accepted the archiepiscopal see of St Andrews. Cunningham succeeded him as chaplain to Morton's household, but did not keep that position for long, since on 5 October 1577 he was appointed to the see of Aberdeen; he was consecrated on 11 November. In the same year he became chancellor of King's College, Aberdeen, a post which he held until his death. As well as his bishopric he had the charge of Aberdeen East parish, which in 1596 he exchanged for St Nicholas's parish; this too he held until he died. His acceptance of Aberdeen did not at first estrange Cunningham from a general assembly that was becoming increasingly hostile to bishops, possibly because it hoped to use him as a means of access to the regent. But Morton's fall in 1580 and his execution in 1581 saw Cunningham reduced to hiding in the west in abject poverty, a fate which Andrew Melville's nephew James saw as God's punishment of Cunningham's apostasy from the &#145;guid cause&#146; by becoming a bishop.<br>
<br>Cunningham's relations with the general assembly were commonly strained thereafter. The assembly increasingly saw itself as the supreme authority in the kirk, and could not therefore accept the appointment of bishops by the government. It raised the issue in 1580, 1582, and 1583, though without conclusion. Then in 1586 it accused Cunningham of adultery with one Elizabeth Sutherland. The loss of the assembly's records makes it impossible to know whether the charge was politically inspired, but in the following year James VI (though not the assembly itself) found that he had been sufficiently cleared of the slander. In 1585 Cunningham founded a grammar school at Banff, but his effectiveness as bishop was probably limited by the poverty to which his predecessor had reduced his see. He became a trusted servant of King James, however, and baptized Prince Henry at Stirling on 30 August 1594. In the winter of 1596&#150;7 he took part in the negotiations which eventually led to the reconciliation of the Catholic earl of Huntly with the government, and in 1598 he was sent with Peter Young on an embassy to Denmark and northern Germany in order to gain support for James VI's claim to the English throne.<br>
<br>Cunningham died in Aberdeen on 3 August 1600, leaving assets valued at &pound;3052 Scots. He had no children. He was survived by his wife, who two years later married Robert Udny of Tillicortrie, second son of William Udny of that ilk.<br>
