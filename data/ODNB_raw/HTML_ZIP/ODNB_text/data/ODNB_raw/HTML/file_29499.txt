<span class="headword">Williams,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1762, <em>d.</em> 1833), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born at Leighton, Shropshire, and baptized there on 8 September 1762, the eldest son of Edward Williams (1730&#150;1824), later of Eaton Mascott, said to have been a coachman by trade, and his wife, Barbara Letitia (1732&#150;1796), daughter of John Mytton, of Halston, Shropshire, and widow of John Corbet (<i>d</i>. 1759), of Sundorne in the same county. Educated at Repton School, Williams matriculated from Pembroke College, Oxford, on 28 October 1779, and graduated BA in 1783. He was ordained deacon and priest in 1786, when his half-brother John Corbet nominated him to the perpetual curacies of Battlefield and Uffington, near Shrewsbury. On 26 October 1787 he proceeded MA from All Souls College, where he held a fellowship from 1783 to 1818; on 13 June 1817 the college presented him to the rectory of Chelsfield, Kent. He retained his three livings for life. As there was no benefice house at Battlefield and only a small one at Uffington, Williams was licensed to be absent, and he lived at Eaton Mascott, about 6 miles from Uffington, until his father died.<br>
<br>A good classical scholar and botanist, Williams was well acquainted with &#145;most subjects in polite literature&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1.182) and early became interested in the antiquities and topography of his native county. He transcribed the Haughmond and Shrewsbury abbey cartularies (the latter from a copy) and compiled abstracts of Shropshire deeds (in private hands and Oxford libraries), pedigrees (some from the Harleian MSS), parish registers, and other records both printed and unprinted, as well as a Shropshire flora cataloguing over 1000 flowering plants and cryptogams. His drawings of church monuments, with inscriptions and arms, fill two large volumes (now held in the British Library). Of perennial interest are his <i>c</i>.300 drawings of Shropshire churches and chapels, made between 1786 and 1791, and now housed at the Shropshire Records and Research Centre in Shrewsbury. Many are aesthetically pleasing, though Williams did not strive for mere artistic effect, and every one is&#151;as was said of his drawings of the principal gentlemen's seats&#151;an accurate record of what preceded the &#145;ravages of time&#146; and the alterations of &#145;equally relentless innovators&#146;  (ibid.). Williams assisted Archdeacon Plymley with his <span class="italic">Agriculture of Shropshire</span> (1803), the Revd H. Owen and the Revd J. B. Blakeway with their <span class="italic">History of Shrewsbury</span> (1825), and Blakeway with his <span class="italic">Sheriffs of Shropshire</span> (published posthumously, 1832). Perhaps through modesty Williams seems to have had no strong wish to print his work, but his manuscripts (most now in the Shropshire Records and Research Centre and the British Library) continue to be of use to historians and, in the case of his manuscript &#145;Flora of Shropshire&#146; (held at Shrewsbury), to botanists.<br>
<br>Latterly Williams discontinued his antiquarian studies, his religious and pastoral duties having claimed him. Touched by the evangelical renewal within the church, he seems to have formed his life on the model of Archbishop Robert Leighton of Glasgow, whose commentary on the first epistle of <span class="roman">Peter</span> he read annually. He was an exemplary parish minister and devoted most of his Chelsfield income to his curate there and to the parochial schools and charitable donations to the poor. His Shropshire cures he served himself from his home, Glansevern Lodge, Coton Terrace, on the Berwick road out of Shrewsbury, where he had moved after Eaton had passed to a younger brother in 1824; it was convenient for his two churches. Both parishes were small, but at Battlefield, Williams also undertook (by arrangement with the vicar of St Alkmund's, Shrewsbury) the pastoral care of the inhabitants of Harlescott. The subscription school he established and managed at Battlefield drew pupils from many surrounding villages, and he also founded a Sunday school there. His sermons were plain and practical but very far from &#145;mere moral essays&#146;. Williams preached last on 23 December 1832, caught a severe cold, and died at Glansevern Lodge, unmarried, on 3 January 1833. He was buried at Battlefield a week later.<br>
