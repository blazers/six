<span class="headword">Collins,  Hercules</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1702), <span class="occ">Particular Baptist minister</span>, appears to have received little formal education. A keen interest in Christianity showed itself at an early age, which may indicate religious parentage. Beyond this, though, nothing is known about his parents. By the mid-1670s he may have been a member of Petty France Particular Baptist Church, London. On 23 March 1677 he was appointed pastor of Wapping Particular Baptist Church, situated at that time between Broad Street and Old Gravel Lane, Wapping. Ten years later, in 1687, Collins led the congregation in a move to a location on James Street, Stepney, where a new building was erected for worship. Although this came after the declaration of indulgence issued by James II in April of that year, plans for the new building had been in the making before the declaration. The move is typical of the vigorous leadership that Collins exercised within his church and the larger Baptist community in London.<br>
<br>In 1684 Collins was imprisoned in Newgate under the provisions of the <span class="roman">Five Mile Act</span>. His earlier defence of nonconformity in <span class="italic">Some reasons for separation from the communion of the Church of England, and the unreasonableness of persecution upon that account</span> (1682) may have been a factor in his imprisonment. When toleration for nonconformists did come in 1689, Collins was involved in the national assembly of Particular Baptists that gave official sanction to the confessional document known as the second London confession of faith, the doctrinal standard for the British Particular Baptist community throughout the next century.<br>
<br>Although Collins had not had the advantage of a learned education, he was well versed in theology. This is evident in his publications. In 1680 he published a Baptist version of the <span class="italic">Heidelberg Catechism</span> (1562), which he entitled <span class="italic">An Orthodox Catechism</span>. A steady stream of books and tracts issued from his pen in the 1690s, dealing with such subjects as divine sovereignty (<span class="italic">Mountains of Brass, or, A Discourse upon the Decrees of God</span>, 1690), believers' baptism (<span class="italic">Believers Baptism from Heaven, and of Divine Institution</span>, 1691), and the death of infants (<span class="italic">Truth and Innocency Vindicated</span>, 1695). A final work, <span class="italic">The Temple Repair'd</span> (1702), is an eloquent plea for Baptist churches to serve as seminaries for aspiring ministers.<br>
<br>By the time of his death, in London, on 4 October 1702, Collins was probably preaching to an auditory of around 700 people. His funeral sermon was preached by fellow Baptist John Piggott and subsequently printed. It contains the scantiest of biographical particulars. He was buried in Bunhill Fields, London.<br>
