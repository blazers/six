<span class="headword">Worthington family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1849&#150;1963), <span class="occ">architects</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_65160"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Worthington</span>  (1826&#150;1909)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born on 11 April 1826 at Crescent Parade, Salford, Lancashire, the fourth of six sons of Thomas Worthington (1779&#150;1842), a merchant of Manchester, and his second wife, Susanna (1792&#150;1869), the daughter of Samuel Barton, a tallow chandler of Hackney. Thomas's twin sister died in infancy and a son of his father by a previous marriage died in 1827. The family were Unitarians and members of the historic Cross Street Chapel, Manchester. Thomas Worthington senior owned a warehouse in High Street, Manchester, then the spine of the city's cotton trade. His death in 1842 left the family impoverished, but Susanna owned property and maintained the family in a smaller house in Cheetham Hill, Manchester. Thomas was educated at the Unitarian school of Dr John R. Beard in Higher Broughton, Salford. At the age of fourteen he was articled for seven years to Henry Bowman and began to &#145;grind at the drill and routine of an Architect's training&#146;  (T. Worthington, &#145;Memories&#146;, 10). The Gothic style championed by A. W. N. Pugin was then at its height, and Bowman, a scholarly architect, published two books of carefully measured and drawn architectural plates: <span class="italic">Specimens of Ecclesiastical Architecture</span> (1846) and, with J. S. Crowther, <span class="italic">Churches of the Middle Ages</span> (1853). Worthington joined Bowman in &#145;church hunting&#146; and also assisted in the preparation of plates. In 1844 he won the Royal Society of Arts gold medal for a finely drawn design of a Gothic chancel, and two years later the silver medal essay prize of the Institute of Architects. He was introduced to William Tite, an architect practising on a national scale, who offered him &#145;a berth&#146;. On completing his articles, Worthington joined Tite's office. For some months he worked from Carlisle on railway projects until a financial crash halted investment and his employment.<br>
<br>In February 1848 Worthington set out with a Mancunian friend, Henry Darbishire, on a tour of the continent with the aim of seeing Rome and the colourful architecture of northern Italy, then attracting popular attention. Sketching <i>en route</i> (Worthington was a talented watercolour painter), in mid-March they reached Rome, where, apart from a walking tour to Assisi and Perugia, they remained until late May. Worthington then continued alone to Naples and Paestum before returning north to the cities of Tuscany. He arrived home in October with a first-hand knowledge of Italian Gothic and Renaissance architecture which he had recorded in sketchbooks and to which he later referred when in practice. In his memoirs, written fifty years later, Worthington summarized the diary and notes kept during his tour.<br>
<br>Tite advised Worthington to establish his own practice in Manchester and, after gaining experience of quantity surveying, in 1849 he opened an office in King Street, a prime location in the city. He received commissions for houses in developing residential areas and submitted a design in the competition for a building to house the Great Exhibition of 1851. Though unsuccessful, his entry was noticed by the architectural commissioners and he was appointed secretary to the Manchester local committee for the exhibition; he declined a London appointment, astutely choosing to represent the interests of exhibitors from Lancashire and Yorkshire.<br>
<br>By 1850 the need to improve the living conditions of the poor was widely recognized. Through his Unitarian inheritance, Worthington actively participated in voluntary societies promoting reform. Foremost was the Manchester Statistical Society, national in the range of its inquiries and the first of its kind in the country. Worthington contributed to its investigations and published two papers in its annual transactions. Housing reform was most conspicuous among his social interests; his first Statistical Society paper was on &#145;Homes for the poor&#146; (<span class="italic">Transactions</span>, 1860&#150;61), and in 1866, by invitation of Lord Shaftesbury, he lectured on housing to the Social Sciences Association, then meeting in Manchester. His appointment as architect to a charitable body two years later enabled him to realize his ideas. When abroad he had noticed the widespread use of urban tenements, and this and the improved health produced by model housing schemes in London led him to propose multi-storey blocks combining improved facilities with a more humane character. On a congested Salford site he built two four-storey blocks with adequately ventilated dwellings of varied size, each including a scullery, rubbish chute, and WC compartment. Although built economically, and a notable improvement on other contemporary models, Worthington's more generous example was not followed, but in other fields he proved more influential. As architect to a company founded to provide public laundries, baths, and swimming pools in needy areas of Manchester and Salford, between 1855 and 1860 he completed three projects, each meeting different functions and incorporating improvements progressively. These were typologically important and became influential through the technical press. Copies of drawings were purchased for use abroad.<br>
<br>Less innovative conceptually but of wider significance was Worthington's work on hospital design. From 1858 Florence Nightingale's <span class="italic">Notes on Hospitals</span> promoted a vigorous campaign to improve hospital design, mainly by introducing the pavilion principle, which reduced cross-infection by locating airy wards in isolated, cross-ventilated, widely spaced parallel blocks. In Manchester this principle was strongly supported by the Statistical Society, and when in 1862 the building of a new hospital was proposed for the Chorlton Union at Withington, Worthington was entrusted with the design. It contained 480 beds in five three-storey blocks and closely followed the new principles. In 1865 the design was published, and a letter of 23 July 1865 from Miss Nightingale comments that, if the estimated costs were achieved, the hospital would &#145;set up a model to the whole country&#146;  (Pass, 91). Worthington presented a paper on the project to the Statistical Society (<span class="italic">Transactions</span>, 1866&#150;7), and as a pamphlet the design was circulated to all boards of guardians and to centres in Europe and the colonies. Miss Nightingale's forecast was fulfilled and Worthington's reputation was established.<br>
<br>Worthington's general practice expanded simultaneously with the social projects. In 1862 he was invited to prepare designs for a &#145;receptacle&#146; in which to house and display a newly commissioned commemorative statue of Prince Albert. His design, a richly decorated Italian Gothic ciborium, received royal approval and preceded G. G. Scott's similar memorial designed for Kensington Gardens, London. Early in 1863 the newly created space was named Albert Square, and the memorial, placed at its centre, became the focal point of the emerging prime civic space of the city.<br>
<br>A pronounced Italian influence is evident in much of Worthington's architecture. In 1858 he made a second Italian tour concentrating on the Veneto, the inspiration of which is reflected in the handsome memorial hall (which commemorated the deposition of dissenting clergy in 1662), completed in 1866, also in Albert Square. Stylistically, Worthington was a versatile pluralist, equally at ease with the Renaissance palazzo mode as with Venetian Gothic. He also had a flair for English Gothic, which he used in his designs for a number of Unitarian chapels in the Manchester area. A fine, soaring example is Brookfield Unitarian Chapel, Gorton (1871). For his last major commission, Manchester College, Oxford, Worthington looked back to the Perpendicular style he had studied as a pupil. Uncharacteristically, it is ill-suited to its context, but in central Manchester he used the eclectic high Victorian Gothic vocabulary skilfully, and in his police and magistrates' courts in Minshull Street (1868&#150;72) he produced a masterpiece of urban design.<br>
<br>On 10 April 1863 Worthington had married Elizabeth Ann Scott (1835&#150;1870) of Stourbridge, Worcestershire, and he later built Fieldhead, a house where they lived at Crumpsall, a suburb of north Manchester. Four children, including <a href="#cosubject_37030">Percy Scott Worthington [<i>see below</i>]</a>, were born there, and in 1869 the family moved to Broomfield, Alderley Edge, an attractive house that Worthington had designed in 1847. Elizabeth died shortly after the birth of their fifth child, a son. On 10 October 1873 Worthington married Edith Emma Swanwick (1847&#150;1942), the 26-year-old daughter of a friend. The family increased by six more children, the youngest of whom was <a href="#cosubject_37029">Hubert Worthington [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>Worthington served as president of the Manchester Society of Architects in 1875, as vice-president of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) from 1885 to 1889, and as president of the Royal Manchester Institution; in 1881&#150;2 he led the negotiations for the transfer of its fine building and modest art collection to Manchester corporation with the proviso that the corporation would spend &pound;2000 annually for twenty-five years on expanding the art collection. Manchester gained a distinguished art gallery, and the funding laid the foundation of the modern collection.<br>
<br>From 1895 Worthington largely withdrew from the practice and in 1906 his connection was formally dissolved. His interest in architecture remained undimmed and his son Hubert recalled that when he was an architectural student his father could hardly be stopped from taking a hand in his entries for student competitions. Just over 6 feet tall, he had &#145;a noble head and figure with his snowy white hair and beard and his fresh complexion&#146;  (J. H. Worthington, 8). Thomas Worthington died peacefully at Broomfield on 9 November 1909 and was buried in the graveyard of the Unitarian chapel at Dean Row, Wilmslow, where the family had worshipped.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_37030"></a><span class="headword">Sir Percy Scott Worthington</span>  (1864&#150;1939), <span class="occ">architect</span>, the eldest son of Thomas and Elizabeth Worthington, was born on 31 January 1864 at Green Bank, Bennett Road (then described as &#145;Polygon&#146;), Crumpsall. In 1878 he went to Clifton College, Bristol, where he proved himself to be a good sportsman and scholar. He entered Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in 1883 to read classics, and graduated in 1887. Following architectural studies under his father, he spent a period in the office of John McVicar Anderson in London; he also attended the Royal Academy Schools and University College, London, where he was awarded the Donaldson medal. A sketching tour through the Balkans to Athens and Istanbul followed. Writing on the construction of five famous domes, in 1889 he won the silver medal essay prize of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and in 1890 he qualified as an architect by examination. In 1880 Thomas Worthington had made his chief assistant John Elgood a partner in his firm, which was then styled Worthington and Elgood. In 1891 Percy Worthington became a partner, and following Elgood's death in 1893 the firm became Thomas Worthington &amp; Son. On 3 July 1895 at the Presbyterian meeting-house, Hale, Altrincham, Cheshire, Percy Worthington married Lucy Juliet (1866&#150;1956), the daughter of Charles Henry Wolff. They lived modestly, first in a converted cottage at Styal, Wilmslow, and from 1922 at Gorsey Brow, Mobberley, a house he designed. They had one son, Thomas Shirley Scott Worthington (1900&#150;1981), who became a partner in the practice in 1945, and a daughter.<br>
<br>Percy Worthington shared the interest of his generation in vernacular buildings and the revival of arts and crafts. Good examples of the latter include the richly detailed Ullet Road Unitarian Church, Sefton Park, Liverpool (1896&#150;1902), and the first phase of Ashburne Hall, Fallowfield, Manchester (1909&#150;31), a women's hall of residence. From about 1904 Worthington turned to the current revival of classicism, using its vocabulary with assured inventiveness, as is illustrated in Manchester by the Union Bank, London Road (1910&#150;11), and the office of Liverpool and London Globe Insurance, Albert Square (1915&#150;19), and by many neo-Georgian houses in Cheshire, among which the remodelled Kerfield House, Ollerton (1912), is notable. On some of his major commissions, such as the faculty of arts building, Manchester University (1911&#150;19), and the masonic temple, Bridge Street, Manchester (1923&#150;9), which despite its extremely compact form is surprisingly spacious and grand internally, he embraced full neo-classicism using giant orders and highly formal planning, quietly integrating and exploiting the new technology of steel and reinforced concrete with apparent ease. These two commissions were the principal works cited when Worthington received the RIBA gold medal in 1930. Towards the end of his career he worked in a quieter form of classicism, best seen in Manchester grammar school (1928&#150;31), produced in collaboration with Francis Jones (1864&#150;1975).<br>
<br>In a professional life of almost fifty years Worthington was responsible for more than a hundred projects&#151;domestic, educational, ecclesiastical, and medical&#151;and won many of his major commissions in competition. He maintained a consistently high standard of design and craftsmanship, and his work on hospitals was described by his obituarist and confr&egrave;re W. G. Newton as pioneering. From 1919 his half-brother Hubert was active in the practice, but it appears that generally each was responsible for his own projects.<br>
<br>In 1919 Manchester University conferred the degree of doctor of letters upon Worthington and in 1935 he was knighted. Like his father, he had given generous support to many of Manchester's institutions, and in 1903&#150;4 he had been instrumental in the creation of a school of architecture in the university. He served on the Royal Fine Arts Commission and was vice-president of the RIBA. Percy Worthington died at his home on 15 July 1939 and was cremated three days later. There is a memorial to him in Mobberley churchyard. He was described by Newton as modest, unhurried, meditative, and possessed of &#145;a critical judgement, perhaps over-acute, and at all times an obstinacy not to be satisfied with anything less than the best, as he saw it&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_37029"></a><span class="headword">Sir (John) Hubert Worthington</span>  (1886&#150;1963), <span class="occ">architect</span>, the youngest son of Thomas Worthington and his second wife, Edith, was born on 4 July 1886 at Chorley, Alderley Edge, Cheshire. He was educated at Sedbergh School (1900&#150;05) and then at the school of architecture, Manchester University. During this period he visited Rome and returned full of enthusiasm for the Italian Renaissance, especially the work of Peruzzi. He was also inspired by the work and personality of Edward Lutyens and, after being articled to his half-brother Percy, from 1912 he spent two years in Lutyens's office. During the First World War, when a captain in the Manchester regiment, Worthington was severely wounded on 1 July 1916 in the offensive on the Somme, but he survived overnight in a shell hole and was rescued the following day. His subsequent army duties were educational, but the Manchester regiment remained a part of his life. He was mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>Worthington returned to architectural practice in 1919, when he joined Percy in the family firm. Twenty-two years his senior, Percy Worthington was then engaged on his major works. Hubert proposed opening a London office and was keen to extend the firm's patronage, but his early commissions were small and in the north. In 1923 he was appointed professor at the Royal College of Art, London, a post he held for five years. In addition to his enthusiasm for the Italian Renaissance and the work of Lutyens, he had as his architectural bible Geoffrey Scott's <span class="italic">The Architecture of Humanism</span> (1914). Early commissions included the war memorial cloister at Sedbergh (1922&#150;4) and the dining-hall and staff wing at Rossall School (1926&#150;8), both Renaissance-inspired designs. The arcaded cloister at Sedbergh is cut into a hillside and supports a terrace facing the grandeur of a Pennine landscape. In contrast, the building at Rossall is enclosed. The large, expressive dining-hall and flanking clock tower are reminiscent of an Italian basilica and campanile. The studied quiet of Sedbergh and the exuberance of Rossall are equally characteristic of Worthington's personality. Simultaneously he carried out many smaller schemes in the Greater Manchester area; particularly notable are his gateway and lodge to Ashburne Hall (<i>c</i>.1926), where the handsome set of gates, a <i>tour de force</i> of wrought ironwork, provides a fine flourish to the setting.<br>
<br>In 1929 Worthington was appointed Slade lecturer in architecture at Oxford University, and four years later he designed a new wing to the university's Radcliffe Science Library (1933&#150;4), the first of many commissions he executed for the university and its colleges. Most were for new buildings, such as the forestry and botany building, but he also carried out internal restoration and refurbishment of the Radcliffe Camera in 1939 and the Bodleian Library in 1955. As a designer Worthington aimed to create a personal style based largely on traditional building. Probably Lutyens was the role model, but Sir Herbert Baker's Rhodes House in Oxford provided a precedent in the modern use of squared limestone rubble in small blocks with ashlar dressings. Worthington adapted this mode for almost all his Oxford commissions and combined it with idiosyncratically detailed door casings and window heads. His buildings have weathered handsomely, but the mannerisms have detracted from his reputation. His library interiors are notably successful, the most distinctive being that at New College (1939). Notable exceptions to the usual pattern of his Oxford designs are the neo-Georgian Lincoln House in Turl Street (1939) and the dolphin gate to Trinity College (1947&#150;8) on St Giles'.<br>
<br>On 20 October 1928 Worthington married, at Holy Trinity Church, Sloane Street, Chelsea, (Sophie) Joan (<i>b</i>. 1905), the daughter of Sidney Marshall Banham, a physician; they had three children. Following Percy Worthington's death in 1939 Hubert became the principal of the firm, and in 1941 he was joined in the practice by his wife. Though unqualified professionally, she had studied architecture at the Royal College of Art during his professorship. A gifted draughtswoman, one of her roles was to prepare exhibition drawings. The Second World War reduced the range of the practice but brought industrial work and the care of damaged historic buildings, and in 1943 Worthington was appointed by the Imperial War Graves Commission as principal architect for Egypt and north Africa. The work, which lasted until the 1950s, included the selection of sites and the design and supervision of the various cemeteries and memorials to the missing, among them one at Valletta, Malta, to missing airmen. Economy favoured large cemeteries, but Worthington insisted that sites should be located close to the battlefields and given their familiar names. They extend from Alexandria to Tunisia. Worthington adopted simple means of expression with low buildings, occasionally shallow-domed, screen walls, and pergolas. The largest cemetery is at El Alamein, where there are more than 7000 graves. The architectural design relies on stark, simple geometry. One of the most attractive cemeteries is Knightsbridge, close to the Egyptian border, where the sloping site is terraced and the headstones follow the stepped formation.<br>
<br>Worthington's major rebuilding commission was the inns of court, London, where the intricate and historic area occupied by the Middle and Inner temples had been so heavily devastated that not only repair but reconstruction was required. This work was shared with Sir Edward Maufe and T. W. Sutcliffe. Some of the repairs and remodellings are historic reconstructions, but the larger replacements reflect the styles of their respective designers. Their outstanding achievement was the retention and re-creation of an intimate historic environment. More personal to Worthington was his work at Manchester Cathedral, where he succeeded Percy as architect in 1938. He was called out early on 23 December 1940 after a heavy air raid. The north-east corner had been demolished and the blast had left the famous choir stalls of <i>c</i>.1510 precariously balanced against each other across the chancel. Worthington immediately organized a team of skilled craftsmen to secure the stalls and collect the oak fragments, relating them where possible to individual stalls. In their repaired state the war damage is almost indiscernible. The repair of the general fabric was not completed until 1955, and Worthington and his wife visited the site daily when in Manchester.<br>
<br>Worthington served as vice-president of the RIBA in 1943&#150;5 and was a member of the Royal Fine Arts Commission from 1945 to 1950. He received a knighthood in 1949, but the honour he prized above all was his membership of the Royal Academy, where he was elected an associate in 1945 and an Academician in 1955. In his later years he was regarded as representative of the pre-war establishment with outmoded architectural ideas, but in practice he showed a flexible awareness of contemporary design. It is evident in the development plan he prepared in 1951 for Manchester College of Science and Technology which was adopted and has been largely realized.<br>
<br>Tall and broad, with a colourful personality, Worthington was a conspicuous figure. He was open, direct, businesslike, quick to respond but unpretentious. The family home at Alderley Edge was modest, architecturally informal, comfortable, and quietly reflective of a lifelong interest in the arts. Worthington died at Manchester Royal Infirmary on 26 July 1963 and was cremated. He is commemorated in the chapel of the Manchester regiment in Manchester Cathedral, where the east window was donated by his friends from the regiment, and a plaque records his devoted service to the cathedral.<br>
