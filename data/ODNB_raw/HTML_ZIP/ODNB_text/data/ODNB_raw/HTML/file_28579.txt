<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wallmoden,  Amalie Sophie Marianne  von</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Amalie Sophie Marianne  von Wendt]</span>, <i>suo jure</i> countess of Yarmouth  (1704&#150;1765), <span class="occ">royal mistress</span>, was born on 1 April 1704, the daughter of Johann Franz Dietrich von Wendt, a general in the Hanoverian army, and his wife, Friderike Charlotte, <i>n&eacute;e</i> von dem Bussche, the widow of another Hanoverian general named Welk. Her grandmother Maria Elisabeth von Meysenbug was probably the first mistress of George I in the late 1670s, and her father's intense correspondence with Ernest Augustus, duke of York and Albany, the brother of George I, has been interpreted as evidence of a homosexual relationship. In 1727 Amalie married Gottlieb Adam von Wallmoden (<i>d</i>. 1752), <i>Oberhauptmann</i> of Calenberg in the electorate of Hanover; they had a son, Franz Ernst, and a daughter, Friderike.<br>
<br>In 1735 Amalie von Wallmoden met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10539/', "George II (1683&#150;1760)")</script> on one of his visits to Hanover, and they began a love affair. According to John, Lord Hervey, the king sent a detailed account of the relationship's progress to Queen Caroline, who remained in London. Reports of Wallmoden, &#145;a young married woman of the first fashion&#146;  (Hervey, 2.457), alarmed the queen, who saw in her a royal mistress who could threaten the queen's influence with George II, and also Sir Robert Walpole, who saw in Wallmoden not only a rival to Queen Caroline but also an incentive for George II to remain in Germany and impede the effectiveness of the British government. During the king's stay in Hanover, Wallmoden conceived a child, Johann Ludwig von Wallmoden (1736&#150;1811), who was widely believed to be the king's, although he was never recognized as such. George returned to Hanover to be with his mistress in 1736, but the queen was opposed to her following the king to Britain. The affair became public knowledge in London, where details, real or imagined, were seized upon by the opposition to Walpole. Wallmoden was said, without foundation, to be a Catholic, and on the king's return it was reported that he &#145;caused the picture of his mistress &hellip; to be hung up opposite to his bed's feet&#146;  (16 March 1737, <span class="italic">Egmont Diary</span>, 2.369&#150;70).<br>
<br>Following Queen Caroline's death in November 1737, Walpole was convinced that only Wallmoden could maintain the king's well-being; he probably also preferred a Hanoverian mistress over a British one with her own family connections, who might influence George II against his ministers. The king's casual relationship with Mary Scott, countess of Deloraine, was put aside. Wallmoden arrived in London in June 1738, and moved into apartments at St James's Palace and Kensington Palace. According to one report she was accompanied by Gottlieb Adam von Wallmoden, but with George II requiring her to act as the king's hostess at court and as the royal sexual partner there was no room for her husband, who divorced her in Hanover in summer 1740. By then, on 8 February 1740, Wallmoden had been naturalized a British subject, and on 24 March 1740 she was created a British peeress, for life, as countess of Yarmouth. She was awarded a pension of &pound;4000 a year from the Irish revenues.<br>
<br>Lady Yarmouth &#145;appears at the drawing-room like one that has been used to the courts of Princes&#146;  (A. Windham to [Charles, third Viscount Townshend], 22 June 1738, <span class="italic">Townshend MSS</span>, 356), but she was a newcomer to British politics. For the first few years of her period as mistress of George II it may have been true that she &#145;had the good sense to abstain as a rule from meddling in court intrigues&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), but although she seems to have exhibited good sense she came to be relied upon by the king's ministers to introduce George II to people and ideas that the king might have resisted. She also took a role in the creation of peers; it was alleged that she had been allocated the fees for peerage creations in 1741, and in 1747 Horace Walpole wrote to George Montagu that she had &#145;touched twelve thousand for Sir Jacob Bouverie's coronet&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 9.51). These activities made her a more effective political mistress to George II than her predecessor Henrietta Howard, countess of Suffolk. Contrary to what some supposed or hoped, she did not rule the king. In the 1740s, Philip Stanhope, fourth earl of Chesterfield, thought that by cultivating her interest he could strengthen his position in Henry Pelham's cabinet, but Lady Yarmouth's approval on a personal level did not lead her to intercede in his favour, and he was eased out of office in February 1748. Lady Yarmouth was more supportive of Thomas Pelham-Holles, duke of Newcastle, when he sought the removal of John Russell, fourth duke of Bedford, as a secretary of state in 1750&#150;51. She helped persuade George II that Bedford was a liability to the administration, contributing towards the latter's resignation in 1751. In the political turmoil of the 1750s Lady Yarmouth's word was useful even to members of the royal family; after William, duke of Cumberland, had capitulated to the French army at Kloster-Zeven in September 1757, he approached Lady Yarmouth to inform the king of his intention to resign his offices. Her alliance with Newcastle has been credited with persuading George II to remain faithful to the Pitt&#150;Newcastle ministry formed in 1757, despite the king's antipathy to William Pitt.<br>
<br>Lady Yarmouth was credited by Horace Walpole with persuading George II to support a &#145;jubilee masquerade in the Venetian manner&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 20.46&#150;7) at Ranelagh Gardens as part of the celebrations of the end of the War of the Austrian Succession in 1749, but in general she appeared content with the unexciting routine of the widowed king's court. Horace Walpole said that she was left &#145;A strong box containing about ten thousand pounds&#146;  (ibid., 21.450) by the king when he died on 25 October 1760, to which George III added the other contents of the bureau where the money was found. She remained in Britain at first, and spent summer 1761 with the duke and duchess of Newcastle, but afterwards returned to Hanover, where she died of &#145;a cancer in her breast&#146;  (J. Twells to the duke of Newcastle, 31 Oct 1765, BL, Add. MS 33069, fol. 295) on 19 October 1765. She was reported to have &#145;left her two sons a million of crowns&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 35, 1765, 534), although this may express the financial rapacity conventionally ascribed to royal mistresses rather than a genuine estimate of her wealth. Her younger son, Johann Ludwig, was made a count in 1783, became a field marshal in the Hanoverian army during the French revolutionary war, and died in 1811.<br>
