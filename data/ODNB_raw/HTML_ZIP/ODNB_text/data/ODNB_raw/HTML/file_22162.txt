<span class="headword">Phillips,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1778&#150;<em>c.</em>1817), <span class="occ">writer on inland navigation</span>, was a native of Essex, of whom little is known other than statements he made about himself in his own publications. He married and apparently had a son called John, for in 1803 he was described as John Phillips, senior. He was &#145;brought up in the building and surveying branches&#146;  (Phillips, <span class="italic">Treatise</span>, preface), and toured Lancashire and Cheshire when the Bridgewater Canal was under construction. He was also present at the digging and vaulting of Harecastle Tunnel, whether as an employee or as an observer is not known, although he did state he had been employed by Brindley. He may have worked with Brindley on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal.<br>
<br>In 1778 Phillips discussed contracts to construct sewers and pavements in Madrid and to investigate the possibility of canals in Spain, but in 1779 war put an end to these plans. In 1779 and 1780 he investigated the feasibility of a canal from London to Norwich and King's Lynn using existing rivers wherever possible. At some date between 1780 and 1783 he was a prisoner on parole in America, but his role in the War of Independence is not known. On his release he travelled in the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, and Russia, inspecting inland navigations, and in Russia was employed as official canal surveyor under the supervision of Charles Cameron, the court architect. In 1783 he was sent to southern Russia to work on a 5 mile canal linking tributaries of the Don and the Volga, but accomplished little besides cutting down a few thousand trees. On his journey back to England he inspected the North Sea and Baltic Canal in Sweden.<br>
<br>Back in England Phillips appears to have concentrated on a publishing career. In 1785 he published anonymously <span class="italic">A Treatise on Inland Navigation</span>, with detailed proposals for canals from London to Norwich and King's Lynn, and from Bishop's Stortford to Cambridge. However, neither scheme was implemented. In 1792 he and Thomas Kitchin published <span class="italic">A New Map of England and Wales</span> on which Phillips inserted the canals. Also in 1792 Phillips published the first edition of <span class="italic">A General History of Inland Navigation, Foreign and Domestic</span>, with information about all known canals. This became an essential contemporary reference work. He updated this book with addenda in 1793 and 1794, and issued new revised editions in 1793, 1795, 1803, and 1805. He also took on in 1805 the editorship of <span class="italic">Crosby's Builders New Price Book</span>, an annual guide to building material prices issued by the booksellers Crosby &amp; Co., and he was possibly still involved in the 1817 edition. It is not known when he died.<br>
