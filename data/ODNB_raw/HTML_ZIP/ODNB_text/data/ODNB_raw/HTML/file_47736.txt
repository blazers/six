<span class="headword">Oats,  Francis</span>  (1848&#150;1918), <span class="occ">mining engineer and authority on diamonds</span>, was born on 24 October 1848 at South Torfrey Farm, Golant, near Fowey, Cornwall, the elder child of Francis Oats (1796&#150;1874), farmer, and his wife, Marion, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rundle (<i>b</i>. 1810). About 1854 his family moved to St Just. As a working miner he attended the classes of the Mining Association of Cornwall and Devon and was top of his class in 1866, when he obtained a first-class pass in mineralogy and passes in mining and chemistry, becoming a pupil&#150;teacher in 1867. Poverty prevented him from accepting the free place offered to him at the Royal School of Mines.<br>
<br>In 1870 Captain Frank Oats&#151;as he was commonly called&#151;became an underground superintendent at Botallack mine, St Just, and in 1874 he was sent by the Griqualand West government to the Kimberley diamond fields in South Africa as provincial engineer and inspector. Also in 1874, on 17 August, he married Elizabeth Ann (<i>b</i>. 1855), daughter of John Olds, a butcher, at St Just parish church. They had four children&#151;three sons and a daughter&#151;born between 1880 and 1888. Oats was back at Botallack in 1876 but returned to Kimberley in 1877 as engineer to the Kimberley Mining Company and manager of the Victoria Diamond Mines Company. Here he stressed the technical arguments in favour of consolidating the diamond producers' interests as a director of the Victoria Company. That concern was taken over by De Beers Consolidated Mines in 1887, when Oats joined its board; he was chairman from 1906 to 1918. From 1889 he was a member of the De Beers diamond sales committee, and from 1898 to 1908 he represented Namaqualand in the Cape parliament. Being the best-qualified director on the De Beers board, he undertook work for the company in Mashonaland, Nama Land, and south-west Africa, prospecting for diamonds, and elsewhere in South Africa for other minerals. He visited British Guiana and Brazil in 1901 to inspect diamond mines, and in 1907 he went to France and exposed as fraudulent the claim by Henri Lemoine that he had made artificial diamonds. Besides directorships in numerous South African companies, some not connected with mining, he was a director of Levant Mine, St Just (1889&#150;1918), and director and later chairman of Basset Mines, Illogan (1896&#150;1918), spending half of each year in Cornwall and half in South Africa.<br>
<br>Frank Oats died at his daughter's house at 1 Bird Street, Port Elizabeth, Cape Province, South Africa, on 1 September 1918. His <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary described him as a very able Cornishman, ambitious, somewhat pugnacious, and masterful, but a born captain of industry .<br>
