<span class="headword">Speechly,  William</span>  (1723&#150;1819), <span class="occ">agriculturist</span>, was born near Peterborough, Northamptonshire, the son of a farmer. He began work as a gardener at Milton Abbey, Dorset, and after working at Castle Howard in Yorkshire he became head gardener to Sir William St Quintin of Harpham, Yorkshire. In 1767 he became gardener to William Henry Cavendish Cavendish-Bentinck, third duke of Portland, at Welbeck Abbey in Nottinghamshire. In 1771 he visited the Netherlands. He married, and had at least two sons.<br>
<br>In 1776 the duke asked him to write a description of the method of planting trees on the Nottinghamshire estates for Alexander Hunter's edition of John Evelyn's <span class="italic">Silva</span>. This later appeared as an article in Hunter's <span class="italic">Georgical Essays</span> (1803). Speechly also contributed a note on the possibility of raising the pineapple without the use of tanner's bark.<br>
<br>Speechly was mainly known for his skill in growing pineapples and grapes. He revolutionized the cultivation of the pineapple, and was particularly concerned that it should not be kept at too hot a temperature in the winter. He introduced new methods for cultivating grapes. In 1779 he issued a <span class="italic">Treatise on the Culture of the Pine Apple</span>; this was followed in 1790 by a <span class="italic">Treatise on the Culture of the Vine</span>. Both works were republished, in one volume, in 1820. In 1797 Sir John Sinclair (1754&#150;1835), president of the board of agriculture, thought about bringing out a comprehensive work on agriculture, and, at his request, Speechly prepared the sections on gardening and domestic rural economy. But in 1798 the project was laid aside, and in 1800 Speechly's manuscript was returned to him at his own request.<br>
<br>In 1801 his younger son died, and Speechly retired from Welbeck Abbey to manage his son's farm. During this time he neglected his manuscript on rural economy, but on his retirement to Great Milton in Oxfordshire he completed and enlarged it, and it was published in 1820, with several other essays appended, under the title <span class="italic">Practical Hints in Domestic Rural Economy</span>. This work was devoted to the management of cottage gardens. Speechly died at Great Milton in Oxfordshire on 1 October 1819.<br>
