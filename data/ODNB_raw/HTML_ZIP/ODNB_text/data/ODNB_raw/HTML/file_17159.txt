<span class="headword">Ludlam,  Thomas</span>  (1727&#150;1811), <span class="occ">theologian and essayist</span>, born in Leicester and baptized at St Mary's on 3 March 1727, was the youngest son of Richard Ludlam (1680&#150;1728), physician, and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17160/', "William Ludlam (bap. 1717, d. 1788)")</script>, mathematician and writer on theology. After being educated at Mr Andrew's school in Leicester he was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, as a pensioner on 9 May 1745; he graduated BA in 1749 and proceeded MA in 1752. Following his ordination as deacon by the bishop of Ely in 1750 he spent some time as chaplain in the navy, and on 31 May 1750 he was appointed chaplain to the <i>Prince Henry</i>. He was ordained priest by the bishop of Lincoln in 1753 and, with the help of John Jackson, was appointed confrater of Wigston's Hospital, Leicester, in 1760 and rector of Foston, Leicestershire, in 1791.<br>
<br>At a time when the importance of religious experience was being urged by those influenced by the evangelical revival Ludlam remained committed to the widespread eighteenth-century belief in the basic consonance between Christianity and reason, and suspicion of &#145;enthusiasm&#146;. In particular, as a devoted disciple of Locke, he argued that religious experience, like all forms of experience, should be subject to the tests of demonstration and analysis, a view he argued at length in his tellingly entitled <span class="italic">Four essays, on the ordinary and extraordinary operations of the Holy Spirit; on the application of experience to religion; and on enthusiasm and fanaticism</span> (1797). He conceded that infallible knowledge might be received from God but claims to such knowledge had to be closely scrutinized since &#145;the knowledge men receive by the use of their various faculties is very imperfect&#146;  (<span class="italic">Four Essays</span>, 67). As he made plain, such a critique was directed particularly at those like the Methodists who mistake &#145;the confidence of expectation for the certainty of experience, the positiveness of opinion for the convictions of reason&#146;  (ibid., 44). His writings in the same vein in the <span class="italic">Orthodox Churchman's Review</span> earned him a reputation as &#145;one of the most formidable opponents of the Calvinistic writers&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 81/2, 492). Predictably such views led to tension with such prominent evangelicals as his former friend, Isaac Milner, who, in his edition of the sermons of his brother, Joseph Milner, characterized Ludlam's work as being written &#145;with an unexampled self-sufficiency, arrogance, and contempt of others&#146;  (Milner, 1.102). A more charitable view of his forthright style was that of his obituarist in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> who claimed that &#145;he was in temper, independent, frank, and friendly, not unobservant of human follies, nor unwilling to expose them&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 81/2, 492). Ludlam died on 13 November 1811 in Leicester.<br>
