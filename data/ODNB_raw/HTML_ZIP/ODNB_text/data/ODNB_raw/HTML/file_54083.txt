<span class="headword">Guppy <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Nicholl; <em>other married name </em>Guppy-Volckman]</span>,  (Agnes) Elisabeth</span>  (1838&#150;1917), <span class="occ">medium</span>, was born Agnes Elisabeth White at 1 Gloucester Crescent, Regent's Park, London, the daughter of Charles Taylor White. Her parents died when she was eleven months old and she was raised by her maternal grandfather, the London sculptor William Ginsell Nicholl (1796&#150;1871), who taught her sculpting and photography. She took her grandfather's name, and was known from an early age as Elisabeth Nicholl (or Nichol). From the age of nine she had visions of spirit figures, which persisted despite exercise and the water cure. In the early 1860s her photographic skills attracted Fanny Sims, an amateur photographer and sister of the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace. Sims convinced her of her spiritual powers, and in December 1866 Miss Nicholl held her first s&eacute;ances in the Wallace household. Her powers caused tables to rap messages and nearby objects to levitate. Later that month she first produced the apports for which she became celebrated: fresh flowers materialized out of the darkness and fell onto participants' laps. During this period she became a professional mesmeric healer, which enabled her to finance private evening s&eacute;ances. Her mediumship was strengthened through collaboration with mediums such as Mrs Makdougall Gregory, Georgiana Houghton (<i>d</i>. 1887), and Catherine Berry (1813&#150;1891): her apports now included fruit and small animals, she began producing spirit drawings, and during one s&eacute;ance with Wallace she levitated herself onto a table.<br>
<br>On 10 December 1867 Miss Nicholl married Samuel Guppy (1790?&#150;1875), a rich and elderly spiritualist and amateur photographer. The newly wedded couple subsequently toured Europe and enthralled nobility and literati with s&eacute;ance apports. Elisabeth's first child, Thomas, was born in Naples during September 1869. On returning to England in July 1870 the couple lived in Highbury, where Mrs Guppy gave private s&eacute;ances and taught mediums such as Frank Herne and Charles Williams. Her most celebrated achievement occurred on 3 June 1871, when she was allegedly transported 3 miles from Highbury to a joint Herne&#150;Williams s&eacute;ance in Holborn. A s&eacute;ance participant had jokingly asked the invisible spirits to bring her there&#151;considered an impossible feat, as she was an enormous woman. Minutes later an entranced Mrs Guppy appeared above the s&eacute;ance table, unaware of her new surroundings.<br>
<br>In January 1872 Mrs Guppy became the first British medium to materialize spirit hands and faces. In the following March the London photographer Frederick Hudson used her mediumship to produce some of the first British spirit photographs. However, Mrs Guppy's stardom was soon threatened by the sensational young medium Florence Cook (1856&#150;1904), who could materialize a fully formed spirit called Katie King. By late 1873 Mrs Guppy had grown so jealous that she devised plots to expose Cook as a fraud. Although she attracted attention for her own fully formed materializations, Mrs Guppy's subsequent sharp decline in popularity suggests that these plots tarnished her reputation. Investigators' opinion of Mrs Guppy was not always favourable: Lord Rayleigh, having attended several of her s&eacute;ances in mid-1874, decided he could not stand her &#145;even in the cause of science and philosophy&#146;; in 1886 Eleanor Sidgwick supported her sister's suspicions that Mrs Guppy's materializations were caused by devices concealed inside her voluminous gown.<br>
<br>Samuel Guppy died in April 1875 and Elisabeth later married William Volckman, a lawyer whom she had used to expose Cook in December 1873. From the late 1870s a protracted illness forced her to discontinue regular s&eacute;ances and take the water cure. By 1897 she had recovered and was once again producing apports and fully formed materializations in private s&eacute;ances. Elisabeth Guppy-Volckman died at 3 Norfolk Square, Brighton, on 9 December 1917.<br>
