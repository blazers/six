<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Repington,  Charles  &Agrave; Court</span>  (1858&#150;1925), <span class="occ">army officer and military writer</span>, was born on 29 January 1858, at 15 Chesham Street, London. He was the son of Charles Henry Wyndham &Agrave; Court Repington (1819&#150;1903), a staunch Anglican and Peelite, MP for Wilton, 1852&#150;5, and of Emily, the eldest daughter of Henry Currie, banker, of West Horley Place, Surrey. The &Agrave; Courts and Repingtons were wealthy country gentry, well connected with the aristocracy, with a long, distinguished history of service to the church, armed services, and parliament. Following family custom, the extra surname Repington was assumed when, in 1903, Charles succeeded to Amington Hall, near Tamworth, Staffordshire. He was educated at Eton College, where he showed no particular distinction (1871&#150;6), and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst (1876&#150;8), before being commissioned in the rifle brigade (1878). His active service was disrupted frequently by ill health. He campaigned in Afghanistan, Burma, Egypt, the Sudan, and South Africa, served five years in army intelligence, was twice military attach&eacute; to the Low Countries, and was also a technical delegate to the first Hague peace conference of 1898. By diligent study he became an expert on military affairs, and was generally recognized as &#145;the most brilliant student&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) during his time at the staff college in Camberley (1887&#150;9). When invalided home from the South African campaign he had reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel, had been mentioned in dispatches four times, and created CMG. Bold, tenacious, able, ambitious, and hard-working, he had proved himself a fine regimental, and an outstanding staff, officer. But his considerable virtues were complemented by not inconsiderable faults. He was extravagant, impetuous, and sometimes cavalier in his attitude to authority and routine. He never suffered fools gladly, whatever their rank.<br>
<br>On 11 February 1882 Repington married Melloney Catherine (1860&#150;1938), daughter of Colonel Henry Sales Scobell. They had one son who died in infancy and two daughters. The marriage eventually foundered on Repington's frequent infidelities, and they separated in 1901. While serving in Egypt Repington began a passionate affair with Mary Isabella 
    (<i>n&eacute;e</i> North; 1868&#150;1953)
  , the wife of Sir William Edmund Garstin, a senior official in the Egyptian ministry of public works. Repington was never a discreet lover, and the liaison was soon common knowledge. In order to accept an appointment to General Buller's staff in South Africa, Repington was required by a high-ranking officer, almost certainly the commander-in-chief, Lord Roberts, to give his written promise, &#145;upon his honour as a soldier and a gentleman&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13 Dec 1901), never again to write to or meet with Mary, Lady Garstin. His parole was given to a brother officer in the rifle brigade, Henry Wilson, for safe-keeping. Subsequently, for reasons he considered adequate and of which he advised Wilson, Repington broke his parole. Garstin sued successfully for divorce. Repington was tried for breach of his parole and told to resign immediately. His treatment was undoubtedly harsh. Repington thereafter blamed Wilson for his dismissal, but he contributed to his own downfall by his careless attitude to a superior officer's command. Repington was condemned by most of society, not for the sin of adultery so much as the solecism of being &#145;found out&#146;. His reputation was permanently tarnished.<br>
<br>Repington turned to journalism. His first regular contributions were to J. A. Spender's <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span>. But it was his account in <span class="italic">The Times</span> of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904&#150;5 that earned him almost instant international recognition as an outstanding military commentator. He frequently disagreed with his editors about defence policy but insisted on his independence. As he told his friend Raymond Marker: &#145;I take orders from no man &hellip; I say precisely what I think; when I'm asked to support some scheme in which I do not believe I shall stop writing in <span class="italic">The Times</span>&#146;  (C. Repington to R. Marker, 17 April 1905, BL, Add. MS 52277B, fols. 17&#150;21). Before 1914 international tensions forced changes in British foreign policy that in turn posed complex defence problems. Repington offered solutions that his civilian readers could comprehend. He advocated a general staff, and, believing in the co-ordination of military and naval planning and closer imperial ties, was an enthusiastic supporter of the infant committee of imperial defence. He opposed the dominant &#145;blue water&#146; strategists, who claimed the navy alone was sufficient to secure Britain against invasion. With Lord Roberts and others he warned of a possible German invasion, a &#145;bolt from the blue&#146;. He fought a long, peacetime battle for conscription, without success. He was contemptuous of almost all politicians, whatever their party loyalty, dismissing them as &#145;Tadpoles and Tapers shivering for their shekels &hellip; rabble seeking office and rewards&#146;  (C. Repington to L. Maxse, 11 March 1908, West Sussex TNA: PRO, MS 458, fol. 671). But he hated the radical Liberals most of all for their sentimentalism; they dubbed him &#145;the gorgeous Wreckington&#146;  (Repington, <span class="italic">Vestigia</span>, 256). For the most part he dismissed ministers as &#145;ignorant &hellip; uncaring &hellip; they know nothing of the Army&#146;, but Richard Burdon Haldane he admired as &#145;the best Secretary of State we have had at the War Office so far as brain and ability are concerned&#146;  (C. Repington to R. Marker, 26 Jan 1906 and 15 Aug 1906, BL, Add. MS 52277B, fols. 35&#150;39 and 78&#150;85), and generally supported his military reforms. Repington was long convinced that Germany was Britain's most dangerous rival, and supported alliance with France. In 1905, when the French sought to initiate military conversations with England, they chose Repington to act as intermediary, for which service he was awarded the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. More clearly than most other commentators in the press, on the brink of war in 1914, he foresaw the likely unfortunate consequences of inconsistent pre-war diplomacy and strategic planning.<br>
<br>In 1911, when Repington was appointed editor of the general staff quarterly, <span class="italic">Army Review</span>, many wrongly supposed he had hopelessly compromised his independence. The war confirmed Repington's ideas and some of his predictions, yet his influence waned. He supposed himself martyred for exposing the incapacities of politicians. To those he criticized he appeared too partisan to convince as objective, the willing mouthpiece of the army's high command. He was an unrepentant advocate of war by attrition; a die-hard &#145;westerner&#146;, scathing of &#145;side-shows&#146; dreamed up by politicians whom he derided as amateur strategists who starved the army of the men and munitions it required. In 1915 his notorious disclosure of a shell shortage contributed to the government's fall. Differences with his editor became increasingly difficult to sustain as Dawson spiked or altered Repington's copy. In January 1918 Repington resigned and joined &#145;Taffy&#146; Gwynne's <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>. Given his new editor's blessing he pursued the prime minister with even greater vigour. Within two months he and Gwynne were convicted of a minor breach of the <span class="roman">Defence of the Realm Act</span>. Unabashed he continued to censure the government for interfering in matters he judged better left to the military. Lloyd George never forgave Repington and, ten years after the military correspondent's death, unfairly accused him of &#145;treachery&#146; and &#145;treason&#146;.<br>
<br>After the war Repington worked for the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>. He never again achieved the eminence he had enjoyed at <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Chronically short of money he decided to publish his war diaries (1920). Though they remain an important historical source, at the time his public recollection of private gossip further damaged his already precarious social position. Repington's wife had refused to divorce him. Nevertheless Mary Garstin, through all their vicissitudes, supported Repington: she took his name, lived with him as his wife, bore him a daughter, and forgave him his not infrequent indiscretions. The last years together in Hove were amicable and peaceful. He died on 25 May 1925 at their home, Pembroke Lodge, Hove, Sussex, penning an article at his desk. He was buried at St Barnabas's Church, Hove, on 29 May.<br>
<br>As a military writer and critic Repington was not without fault. His views on tactics were conventional. He was over-fond of political intrigue although, except in the case of Henry Wilson, he never allowed personal prejudice to cloud his public judgements. But his greatest failing was his inability sufficiently to appreciate the problems that politicians faced during the war. His most important and significant work was completed before the First World War. It is unfortunate that he has been judged largely on the basis of observations by opponents he had wounded in public debate, who sought to salve their self-esteem with lies and cheap jibes, or by deliberately misleading press campaigns, such as that conducted by J. L. Garvin at the behest of Alfred Milner, falsely accusing Repington of giving pusillanimous and contradictory advice. Repington, the <i>beau sabreur</i> and &#145;prince of military correspondents&#146;  (Luvaas, 303), deserves a better memorial.<br>
