<span class="headword">Cornewall,  Folliot Herbert Walker</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1754, <em>d.</em> 1831), <span class="occ">bishop of Worcester</span>, was baptized Folliot Herbert Cornewall on 9 May 1754 at Ludlow, Shropshire, the second son of Frederick Cornewall (1706&#150;1788), of Delbury, Shropshire, a naval officer and MP for Montgomery from 1771 to 1774, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Francis Herbert, a first cousin of Henry Arthur Herbert, first earl of Powis. His elder brother, Frederick Cornewall (1752&#150;1783), was MP for Leominster from 1776 to 1780, and for Ludlow from 1780 until his death. Cornewall entered Eton College on 27 April 1765 and was admitted pensioner at St John's College, Cambridge, on 24 June 1772. He graduated BA in 1777. On 14 December that year he was ordained deacon by John Hinchcliffe, bishop of Peterborough, and on 20 December 1778 he was ordained priest. He proceeded MA in 1780, the same year that he was appointed chaplain to the House of Commons, nominated by the speaker, his second cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6335/', "Charles Wolfran Cornwall")</script>. His sermon before the House of Commons for 30 January, the anniversary of the execution of Charles I, was given and printed in 1782. Cornewall continued to accumulate preferment. He was rector of Frilsham, Berkshire, from 1781 to 1784, canon of Windsor from 1784 to 1793, master of Wigston's Hospital, Leicester, from 1790, and dean of Canterbury from 1793 to 1797. In Ludlow he was a common councilman from 1781 to 1797.<br>
<br>On the death of his brother in 1783 Cornewall inherited the estates of a relative, Francis Walker, and took the additional name of Walker. On 19 June 1787, at Taplow, Buckinghamshire, he married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1795), daughter of George Hamilton, canon of Windsor; they had two sons and two daughters. On 9 April 1797 Cornewall was consecrated bishop of Bristol. His fast sermon preached before the House of Lords was published in 1798. He was translated to the diocese of Hereford, a wealthier see than Bristol, on 28 January 1803. In 1805 he deputized for Richard Hurd, the elderly bishop of Worcester, on a confirmation tour, as the octogenarian Hurd was too infirm to travel. Following Hurd's death, he was nominated to succeed him. The prime minister, William Henry Cavendish Cavendish-Bentinck, third duke of Portland, wrote to George III that Cornewall's character and learning were highly distinguished, that his appointment was &#145;much wished for by the principal gentry as well as clergy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Later Correspondence of George III</span>, 5.3668), and that his political opinions would help secure the diocese's loyalty to the administration. He was consecrated in 1808.<br>
<br>Cornewall died at home at Hartlebury Castle, Stourport, Worcestershire, on 5 September 1831, and was buried in the family vault at Delbury, Shropshire. The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> remembered him as &#145;possessed of fair scholarship, strong good sense, polished manners, and an amiable temper: &hellip; [he] passed a virtuous and exemplary life&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 370).<br>
