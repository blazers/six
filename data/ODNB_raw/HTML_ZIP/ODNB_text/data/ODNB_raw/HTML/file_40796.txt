<span class="headword">Wolsey,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1610<span class="mult">x</span>12?), <span class="occ">separatist leader</span>, was ordained deacon on 6 June 1568 and priest on 1 April 1569 by Bishop John Parkhurst of Norwich. Nothing is known of his parents or his early life, or of his activities during the 1570s. About 1580 he became deeply involved in the emerging East Anglian separatist movement. He may have been a member of Robert Browne's and Robert Harrison's congregation, but this cannot be proven conclusively. However, between 1580 and 1582 he was gaoled on two occasions for his religious beliefs. These periods of incarceration were difficult: by Harrison's account, he was thrust into &#145;lothsome prison houses&#146;  (Harrison, 43).<br>
<br>During this period Wolsey came into conflict with Edward Fenton, rector of Booton, Norfolk, not far from the town of Aylsham. Fenton was a radical nonconformist who had apparently considered separating from the established church, but eventually decided to remain within it. After several admonitions, Wolsey sent Fenton a letter severely rebuking him for his decision. Fenton replied by writing against both Wolsey and Harrison. Harrison then composed a letter defending both Wolsey (referred to only by his initials) and himself. It was printed eventually as the second portion of &#145;A treatise of the church and the kingdome of Christ&#146;.<br>
<br>Wolsey appears to have remained behind in East Anglia when Browne, Harrison, and their followers departed for Middelburg in the spring or summer of 1582. In fact, according to Stephen Offwood, he seems to have spent much, if not all, of the rest of his life in gaol. Thetford assize records indicate that he and four other separatists were sentenced to death on 30 March 1584, but were later reprieved in prison. He was still confined at Thetford in July 1584, and at Norwich in July 1585. He was also listed as a prisoner in Norwich Castle in December 1595. When Offwood visited him in 1602, he was still a prisoner, but &#145;he had a keye for to lete in unto him [w]home he [w]ould and to goe out as he pleased at a back gate&#146;  (Offwood, 40).<br>
<br>In gaol or out, Wolsey converted sizable numbers of people to his views. Offwood records that &#145;he perverted many zealous professors, of which I knewe twentie&#146;, including Henry Barrow, the greatest of the Elizabethan separatists  (Offwood, 40). After reading one of Robert Browne's books, Barrow visited Wolsey, who completed his conversion to separatism.<br>
<br>Wolsey's subsequent relationship with Barrow did not go smoothly. In the late 1580s and early 1590s, Wolsey was apparently beginning to adhere to several Jewish laws and practices, which Barrow condemned. Among other things, Wolsey maintained that it was unlawful for Christians to eat blood, things strangled, and meats offered to idols. Barrow's death on 6 April 1593 seems to have ended the controversy, but it broke out again when Wolsey sent a letter to Francis Johnson's &#145;Ancient&#146; separatist congregation at Amsterdam in 1602 reasserting these positions. Writing in the name of the whole church, Johnson and Henry Ainsworth replied on 7 December, rejecting Wolsey's opinions and threatening to discontinue their recognition of him as &#145;a Preacher of the kingdome of God&#146; if he did not recant  (<span class="italic">Seasonable Treatise</span>, 16).<br>
<br>Wolsey stands alongside Browne and Harrison as one of the founders of East Anglian separatism. He was one of its earliest exponents and one of its most effective spokesmen. Nevertheless, as Offwood observed, he was a &#145;harshe spirit&#146;, who rejected or excommunicated almost all of his followers at one time or another. After 1602 Wolsey's life is unknown, but Offwood claimed that he held his &#145;Jewishe errours&#146; until his death  (Offwood, 40). Since by Offwood's calculation his imprisonment lasted about thirty years, he probably died between about 1610 and 1612.<br>
