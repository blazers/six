<span class="headword">Scott,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1566&#150;1635), <span class="occ">landowner and politician</span>, was the eldest in a family of four sons and two daughters of Charles Scott (<i>d</i>. 1596), a puritan landowner and justice of the peace, of Godmersham near Canterbury, and his wife Jane, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30112/', "Sir Thomas Wyatt")</script> of Boxley, executed for rebellion in 1554. Scott's education is uncertain but it seems likely that he attended the cathedral school, Canterbury, and afterwards went to Cambridge University.<br>
<br>Scott inherited the family estate in 1596, the year in which he married his first wife, Elizabeth, the daughter of John Webbe, a prominent Canterbury merchant; they had one child, Jane. His second wife, whom he married in 1602, was Mary, the daughter of John Knatchbull of Mersham, a substantial Kentish landowner; they had a son, Thomas (who predeceased him), and three daughters.<br>
<br>From 1612 until towards the end of his life Scott lived for a good part of the year in Canterbury. In 1613&#150;14 he was in conflict with Archdeacon Charles Fotherby over an amalgam of personal and religious issues. Increasingly involved in local politics, in 1614 he supported Sir Edwin Sandys as a candidate in the county elections to the Addled Parliament. In 1618 he obtained the freedom of the city of Canterbury and shortly after became a member of the common council, though he was soon removed, owing to the hostility of the corporation ruling group. A zealous though conformist puritan, Scott acquired a reputation in the early 1620s as an opponent of the city leaders and as a critic of royal policy.<br>
<br>In 1624 Scott was elected MP for Canterbury in a fierce campaign inflamed by anti-Catholicism. He also stood in the 1625 and 1626 elections, but was defeated by the corporation's candidates. He was re-elected as MP for Canterbury in 1628, with wide freeman and puritan support. Little is known about his activities in parliament, but in 1628 he opposed the billeting of troops and was summoned before the privy council; four years later he was in conflict with the authorities again over musters.<br>
<br>The principal evidence for Scott's radical opinions comes from his extensive diaries and other unpublished writings. In 1626 he wrote on the need for parliamentary reform, calling for the expulsion of non-resident borough MPs whom he regarded as illegally elected, and also for a major redistribution of seats in the House of Commons. In 1627 he produced a radical and wide-ranging indictment of royal policy, denouncing George Villiers, first duke of Buckingham, identifying Charles I as a tyrant, and espousing resistance theory.<br>
<br>Scott's life was dominated by an intense commitment to godly religion, which involved searing spiritual experiences and recurrent bouts of melancholic despair. But he also showed a striking interest in international developments, particularly the progress of the protestant cause in France and Germany during the Thirty Years' War. He was a passionate, combative, choleric, and difficult man, frequently embroiled in legal disputes. Thomas Scott died in Godmersham in May 1635. His heir was Dorothea Scott [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67762/', "Gotherson, Dorothea")</script>], a friend of several of the regicides and a Quaker pamphleteer and preacher during the 1650s.<br>
