<span class="headword">Castle,  Vernon</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Vernon William Blyth]</span>  (1887&#150;1918), <span class="occ">ballroom dancer</span>, was born Vernon William Blyth on 2 May 1887 at Mill Hill Road, Heigham, near Norwich, Norfolk, the youngest in the family of four daughters and one son of William Thomas Blyth, public house manager, and his first wife, Jane Finley. His mother died when he was a child, and after attending local schools he studied civil engineering at Birmingham University. In the summer of 1906 he accompanied his sister, Coralie Blythe, and her husband, Lawrence Grossmith, to New York, where they had been engaged to act in a revue, <span class="italic">About Town</span>, the first Broadway show put on by the comedian Lew Fields at his Herald Square Theater. When the play went on tour, he became Grossmith's understudy, and back in New York he was given a small part in <span class="italic">The Girl behind the Counter</span> (1907), in which he was noticed for his elegant dancing. It was at this point that he took the name of Castle.<br>
<br>Castle played comic roles and danced in several more Lew Fields productions, including <span class="italic">The Midnight Sons</span> (1909), <span class="italic">Old Dutch</span> (1909), <span class="italic">The Summer Widowers</span> (1910), and <span class="italic">The Hen Pecks</span> (1911), which set off a craze for ragtime, with dances such as the turkey trot, the grizzly bear, and the bunny hug. Castle married <a href="#cosubject_58751">Irene Foote [<i>see below</i>]</a> in May 1911. He had persuaded Lew Fields to give her a very small part in the replacement cast of <span class="italic">The Summer Widowers</span> in November 1910 at the Majestic Theater in Brooklyn, her first professional engagement. After their honeymoon in England, she joined the cast of <span class="italic">The Hen Pecks</span> for its reopening.<br>
<br>Vernon and Irene Castle first appeared professionally as dancing partners in Paris in 1912. Vernon had been engaged to appear in a comic revue by a Paris manager who had seen him in <span class="italic">The Hen Pecks</span> in New York, in a famous slapstick scene in a barber's shop. Irene was given a small part, but they soon left to try out as dancers at the Caf&eacute; de Paris, dancing the grizzly bear and the Texas tommy. An overnight success, they spent six months there as cabaret entertainers.<br>
<br>On their return to New York the Castles were inundated with offers of work, and they set off a dancing craze which swept America. Turning their backs on the acrobatic animal dances, they popularized social ballroom dancing with dances such as the hesitation waltz and the Castle walk, and showed that dancing could be refined and graceful. Their most popular dance was the one-step, danced to ragtime music, and they introduced the tango to the ballroom in 1912, and the foxtrot in 1914. The Castles danced in C. B. Dillingham's Broadway production of <span class="italic">The Sunshine Girl</span> (1913), in which Vernon also had a comic role. They taught at Castle House, a school of modern dancing in New York&#151;Vernon was an excellent teacher&#151;and in 1914 they brought out <span class="italic">Modern Dancing</span>, showing people exactly how to dance the new dances: &#145;real dancing means graceful measures tripped to the lilting rhythm of fine music&#146;  (p. 37). Tea dances were held at Castle House, and the Castles danced most evenings at Castles in the Air, a rooftop dancing and supper establishment in New York, or at Castles by the Sea at Long Beach, Long Island, and they also owned a restaurant, Sans Souci, on 42nd Street, New York, where Vernon indulged in his passion for drumming. In 1913 they appeared in a film, <span class="italic">The Whirl of Life</span>: Irene continued to make films, and later went to Hollywood, where she starred in fifteen episodes of <span class="italic">Patria</span> for Path&eacute;. With Jim Europe's band they went on a whirlwind tour of America in a special train in the spring of 1914. Their best, and last, work on stage together was for C. B. Dillingham in <span class="italic">Watch your Step</span>, advertised as &#145;the first Syncopated Musical&#146;, with music and lyrics by Irving Berlin, which opened on Broadway in December 1914, and then toured America.<br>
<br>The Castles were in France at the beginning of August 1914, engaged to dance for a month in the casino at Deauville, but with war imminent they went to England, where Irene persuaded Vernon not to enlist. But in December 1915, at the peak of his career, he left <span class="italic">Watch your Step</span> to train as a pilot at Newport News, Virginia, before sailing to England, where he was commissioned in the Royal Flying Corps. He flew 150 missions in France, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre, but after a flying accident in 1917 he was sent to Camp Mohawk, Deseronto, in Canada, as a flying instructor, and from there went with his squadron to winter quarters at Benbrook Field, near Fort Worth, Texas. Vernon Castle was killed in an air collision on 15 February 1918, while instructing a cadet. He was buried at Woodlawn cemetery, New York, five days later. Despite his success, he was a modest, unassuming man. When not performing, he liked to play polo near the Castles' home in Manhasset, Long Island, New York, and he showed German shepherd (Alsatian) dogs.<br>

<a name="cosubject_58751"></a><span class="headword">Irene Castle <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Foote]</span></span>  (1893&#150;1969)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 7 April 1893 in New Rochelle, New York, the younger of the two daughters of Hubert Townsend Foote (<i>d</i>. 1912), a homoeopathic doctor, and his wife, Anne Elroy Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1922). It was thanks to Vernon Castle, whom she met at a swimming party, that she went on the stage, and after he joined the Royal Flying Corps she continued to perform in <span class="italic">Watch your Step</span>. She was in C. B. Dillingham's revue <span class="italic">Miss 1917</span>, which ran for only nine weeks after its opening in November 1917, and at the time of Vernon's death she was playing the leading role in Dillingham's <span class="italic">The Century Girl</span> at the Century Theater in New York. After his death she found a new dancing partner, Billy Reardon, and continued to act occasionally, coming out of retirement in 1939 to play the lead in No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">Shadow Play</span>. She wrote about their partnership in <span class="italic">My Husband</span> (1919), and in <span class="italic">Castles in the Air</span> (1958). The Castles were much admired by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and it was they who were engaged to play the leading roles in the film <span class="italic">The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle</span> (1939), adapted from <span class="italic">My Husband</span>, with songs and dances from their heyday, including the Castle polka, danced to &#145;Little Brown Jug&#146;, and the Castle walk, to &#145;Too much Mustard&#146;. Irene Castle was technical adviser to the film.<br>
<br>At the height of the popularity of the Castles, Irene set the fashions of the day. She was the first woman to bob her hair, and all America copied the Castle bob. Tall and elegant, she designed silk dresses for the Corticelli Silk Company in the 1920s, and later worked for the Formfit Company, promoting corsets in department stores. In 1928 she opened a dogs' home, Orphans of the Storm, in Illinois, and campaigned against cruelty to animals.<br>
<br>Irene Castle remarried three times. In 1919 she married Robert Treman. After their divorce in 1923 she married Frederic McClaughlin: there were two children from this marriage. After his death at the end of the Second World War she married George Enziger (<i>d</i>. 1959) in 1946. Irene Castle died on 25 January 1969 in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, USA.<br>
