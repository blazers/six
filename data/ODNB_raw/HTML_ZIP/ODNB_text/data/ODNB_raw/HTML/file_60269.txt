<span class="headword">Jebb,  Julian Alvery Marius</span>  (1934&#150;1984), <span class="occ">journalist and television producer</span>, was born on 2 April 1934 at Hawkesyard Priory, Rugeley, Staffordshire, the youngest of the four children of Reginald Douglas (Rex) Jebb (1883&#150;1977) schoolmaster and journalist, and his wife, Eleanor Philippa (1899&#150;1979), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30699/', "Hilaire Belloc (1870&#150;1953)")</script> and his wife, Elodie. He was brought up in the Belloc family home, Kingsland, near Horsham, Sussex, its rooms lined with some ten thousand books, richly redolent of candle-grease and his grandfather's Catholicism. Jebb was educated at Downside School (1947&#150;52) and King's College, Cambridge (1953&#150;6), where he co-edited the magazine <span class="italic">Granta</span> with Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy and performed in reviews with the Cambridge Footlights. His childhood and education pointed him towards a career as a novelist, but after spasmodic attempts to write fiction his contribution to English artistic life was channelled into reviews of novels and films, and his own arts documentaries made for BBC television. He was always a devoted enthusiast and promoter of talents.<br>
<br>After leaving Cambridge Jebb worked for the Catholic weekly <span class="italic">The Tablet</span> and the literary agent Stephen Aske. In Germany he produced and acted in English-language plays for Radio Bremen. In the sixties he taught English in Rome. He travelled in Spain and Greece, leading the expatriate life, the typewriter set up by the open window, the Aegean beyond. Such money as he earned tended to be spent rapidly and generously. He was homosexual, but the claims of close friendship suited him better than the uncertain territory of love affairs.<br>
<br>In 1967 Jebb joined the arts department of BBC television as an assistant producer. He co-produced a series of literary programmes, flourishing in the friendlier climate of those times, with BBC2 only recently started, and a mission to put writers on the screen, spearheaded by the young Melvyn Bragg. By means of a quotation guessing game, called <span class="italic">Take it or Leave it</span>, which was devised by Brigid Brophy, Jebb, through contacts and friendships, introduced a number of writers to the television studio for the first time. Participants included Anthony Burgess, John Bayley, Iris Murdoch, Cyril Connolly, A. S. Byatt, Philip Toynbee, and Mary McCarthy. He conducted the first studio interview with the painter Francis Bacon and made interview-based documentaries with Christopher Isherwood, John Osborne, Patricia Highsmith, and Anthony Powell. In 1969 he filmed &#145;Tennyson on the Isle of Wight&#146; with John Betjeman, the best of several collaborations with the poet laureate. His longer documentaries on Virginia Woolf, the Mitford sisters, and Dame Edna Everage (Barry Humphries) drew on a lively affection for his subjects. It was the only way he knew how to work. In those days the BBC was happy to retain on the staff someone who had a wide-ranging knowledge and enjoyment of the arts&#151;literature, opera, ballet, painting, films of all kinds, the pop culture of television (not rock music, however): Jebb cheerfully crossed the boundaries of critical definitions. He was an excellent radio broadcaster and in some respects had more in common with the old-style producers of Radio 4, but he found himself entranced with the new world of television. Unfortunately the medium did not nurture his abilities, even if the excitement of programme making convinced him that he was fully stretched. The weeks before his death were marked by increasing despair at the callous treatment he felt he had received. He was a literary amateur working in a world increasingly dominated by career-driven professionals.<br>
<br>Jebb was a brilliant mimic with a wonderful vein of fantasy, but a haunting sense of failure increasingly plagued him. No one could halt the inroads of alcohol and pills, which undermined his health and work. Finally, on 31 October 1984, he killed himself at his flat, 171 Ladbroke Grove, London, with an overdose of heminevrin. He had, as a pained and angry Germaine Greer wrote, been given so much and thrown it all away. Sadly a rare gift for friendship and promoting the talents of others had undermined the will-power needed for his own survival.<br>
<br>In 1993 a memoir, called <span class="italic">A Dedicated Fan</span>, was published. It includes interviews with Evelyn Waugh (<span class="italic">Paris Review</span>, 1962, a sparkling performance) and Elizabeth Bowen, unpublished journals, personal memories from friends, family, and a number of writers including V. S. Naipaul, Alison Lurie, Patricia Highsmith, A. S. Byatt, Caroline Blackwood, Paul Theroux, Frances Partridge, Patrick Leigh Fermor, Antonia Fraser, Barry Humphries, Melvyn Bragg, Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy, and Elaine Dundy.<br>
