<span class="headword">Primmer,  Jacob</span>  (1842&#150;1914), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and religious controversialist</span>, was born on 6 October 1842 at 9 Broad Wynd, Leith, the second of the four children of John Primmer (1815&#150;1846), merchant seaman, and his wife, Louisa (1810&#150;1891), daughter of Commodore Jacob White RN. Primmer was educated at St John's Free Church Infant School (<i>c</i>.1848&#150;1850), where he also attended a Sunday school held in the same building, and Kay's Commercial School (<i>c</i>.1850&#150;1855). Here, in recollection at least, Primmer's enthusiam was confined to scripture lessons and devotional exercises; by his own account his most formative religious experience as a child was gloating over the illustrations to Foxe's book of martyrs. After leaving school he was apprenticed as a compositor, but continued to educate himself by independent study and attendance at Christian Fellowship meetings, and, significantly, at the anti-popery classes instituted by John Hope. He studied divinity at the University of Edinburgh from 1865 and, by 1872, the year of his graduation, Primmer's views were fully formed. He believed in total abstinence and sabbatarianism, and was committed to defending the principles, and often the forms and practices, of the original protestant reformers.<br>
<br>Primmer's first charge, which he took up in 1872, was at Gardenstown Mission, Banff. At Gardenstown he met Jessie Munro (1848&#150;1912), the village schoolmistress, who became his wife on 12 July 1876; they had two sons. In the year of his marriage he was given charge of Townhill Mission, in a mining village near the town of Dunfermline, Fife; in 1903 he moved to Kingseathill in Dunfermline. Immediately on his arrival at Townhill he courted controversy. In defiance of the presbytery of Dunfermline he administered unfermented wine to communicants in his church and successfully took his case to the general assembly in 1879. This experience gave him a taste for litigation and many of his causes were pursued through civil and church courts. He relished direct confrontation and, in his campaign against ritual and vestments, visited other churches and denounced offending ministers as they preached in their own pulpits. In Primmer's own estimation, his major achievement was the series of open-air meetings, or &#145;historic conventicles&#146;, held throughout Scotland between 1888 and 1908. These were impressive, rowdy occasions, where Primmer's simple, pugnacious preaching style and bearded, prophet-like appearance were used to powerful and provocative effect.<br>
<br>Primmer wrote at least fifty pamphlets and was a tireless correspondent, both in the press and with public figures. In 1897 the curious <span class="italic">Jacob Primmer in Rome</span>, a comprehensive tourist account of the Italian capital, as seen through the eyes of a primitive protestant zealot, was published. Ultimately, though contemporaries testified to his sincerity and energy, his antics were an irrelevant and eccentric sideshow in the religious life of Scotland. Primmer died from a stroke on 14 August 1914 at the manse, Kingseathill, Dunfermline, and was buried four days later at Warriston cemetery in Edinburgh.<br>
