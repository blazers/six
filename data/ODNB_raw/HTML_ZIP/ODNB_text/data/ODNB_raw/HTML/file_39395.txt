<span class="headword">Monckton,  (John) Lionel Alexander</span>  (1861&#150;1924), <span class="occ">composer and songwriter</span>, was born in London on 18 December 1861, the eldest son of Sir John Braddick Monckton (1832&#150;1902), town clerk to the City of London, and his wife, Maria Louisa Long (<i>d</i>. 1920). Lady Monckton was an enthusiastic amateur actress. The young Monckton was educated at Charterhouse School and at Oriel College, Oxford (1880&#150;85), where he took part in college theatricals and composed music for the dramatic society's productions. Called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1885, he subsequently practised as a lawyer but worked simultaneously as a theatre critic and a songwriter. His first stage piece, an operetta called <span class="italic">Mummies and Marriage</span>, was produced by amateurs in 1888.<br>
<br>Monckton broke through in the professional theatre when George Edwardes put his song &#145;What will you have to Drink?&#146; into the burlesque <span class="italic">Cinder-Ellen up-too-Late</span> (1891), and he afterwards had individual songs heard in several other London shows before Edwardes gave him the job of supplying additional numbers to Ivan Caryll's score for the Gaiety Theatre's <span class="italic">The Shop Girl</span> (1894) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62430/', "Caryll, Ivan")</script>]. Monckton's &#145;Beautiful Bountiful Bertie&#146; and &#145;Brown of Colorado&#146; proved to be among the show's favourite numbers. The association with Edwardes, the Gaiety, and Caryll thus established continued for some fifteen years: the tuneful Monckton by and large supplied the melodies for featured songs while the musically educated Caryll took care of the more plotful pieces and the ensemble work. During the period in which the pair provided the Gaiety's music, Edwardes's theatre was the most popular musical house in London, and the shows produced there&#151;<span class="italic">The Circus Girl</span> (1896), <span class="italic">A Runaway Girl</span> (1898), <span class="italic">The Messenger Boy</span> (1900), <span class="italic">The Toreador</span> (1901), <span class="italic">The Orchid</span> (1903), <span class="italic">The Spring Chicken</span> (1905), <span class="italic">The Girls of Gottenberg</span> (1907), <span class="italic">Our Miss Gibbs</span> (1909)&#151;went round the world, popularizing Monckton's songs such as &#145;Soldiers in the Park&#146;, &#145;Maisie&#146;, &#145;Keep off the Grass&#146;, and &#145;Moonstruck&#146; not only throughout the English-speaking world, but even around Europe, as the product of the Gaiety Theatre established itself as the favourite musical-theatre entertainment of the <i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i> years.<br>
<br>Alongside his contribution to the Gaiety's lightweight musical comedies, Monckton wrote additional numbers for Edwardes's other major theatre, Daly's, where a more substantial kind of romantic musical play was produced, and where the house's chief composer was Sidney Jones. Monckton began his Daly's career by supplying several numbers for Jones's <span class="italic">The Geisha</span> (1896, &#145;Jack's the Boy&#146;, &#145;The Toy Monkey&#146;), and, while that show went on to become the most internationally successful English-language musical play of the nineteenth century, he followed up with numbers for <span class="italic">A Greek Slave</span> and another major worldwide hit, <span class="italic">San Toy</span>.<br>
<br>In 1902, when Jones moved on, Edwardes gave Monckton his first opportunity to compose a full score for the London stage. <span class="italic">A Country Girl</span> (1902, for which the additional numbers were by the rising Paul Rubens) gave the producer and composer another enormous success. Its successor <span class="italic">The Cingalee</span> (1904), however, brought all sorts of problems with it, and Edwardes switched to importing continental shows for Daly's. As a result Monckton ended up composing his next show score for Robert Courtneidge. The outcome was <span class="italic">The Arcadians</span> (with Howard Talbot), the classic musical play of the Edwardian era. Like <span class="italic">The Geisha</span>, and like <span class="italic">A Country Girl</span>, <span class="italic">The Arcadians</span> (1909) became a worldwide success, and its favourite songs&#151;&#145;The Pipes of Pan&#146;, &#145;The Girl with the Brogue&#146;, and &#145;All Down Piccadilly&#146;&#151;held their own with the melodies of the now fashionable Viennese operetta as the song hits of the period.<br>
<br>When Edwardes purchased the lease of the Adelphi Theatre, Monckton and his wife, the Gaiety star <i>ing&eacute;nue</i> <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35022/', "Gertie Millar")</script>, whom he had married on 20 December 1902, were deployed there, and Monckton supplied the music for the house's biggest success, <span class="italic">The Quaker Girl</span> (1910, &#145;The Quaker Girl&#146;, &#145;Come to the Ball&#146;, &#145;Tony from America&#146;). He nevertheless wrote music for only three more book shows for the London stage after <span class="italic">The Quaker Girl</span>. After providing Courtneidge with the score for a <span class="italic">Geisha</span> clone called <span class="italic">The Mousm&eacute;</span> (1911) and the Adelphi and Miss Millar with the pretty but unexceptional <span class="italic">The Dancing Mistress</span> (1912) he had one last major hit when he combined once more with Talbot to provide the songs for <span class="italic">The Boy</span> (1917), a musical version of Sir Arthur Wing Pinero's <span class="italic">The Magistrate</span>, which was one of the greatest hits of the wartime years.<br>
<br>The death of George Edwardes and the changing fashions in popular music sparked by the introduction of syncopated American dance music to British shores in the years before the war had, however, discouraged the composer and, although he for a while tried his hand at writing for the newly popular genre which called itself revue (<span class="italic">Bric &agrave; Brac</span>, <span class="italic">We're All in it</span>, <span class="italic">Airs and Graces</span>), he soon renounced and went into retirement. He died at his home, 49 Golden Square, London, on 15 February 1924. His widow remarried later that year, becoming the countess of Dudley.<br>
<br>One of the most successful writers of popular melodies of the Victorian era (his arrangements and orchestrations were inevitably left to everybody's favourite arranger, Carl Kiefert), Monckton contributed materially to the success of a quarter of a century of musical shows.<br>
