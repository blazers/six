<span class="headword">Whitehead,  Hugh</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1551), <span class="occ">prior then dean of Durham</span>, was a Benedictine monk of Durham Cathedral priory by 30 March 1499, when he was ordained deacon. He was made priest on 18 December 1501. From that year he was a student at Durham College, Oxford. After seven years' study counted there and two elsewhere (doubtless in his own cloister) he supplicated BTh on 15 January 1509, being admitted on 14 March. He proceeded DTh on 4 July 1513. He was proxy for the prior of Durham Cathedral at the provincial chapter of the black monks on 2 July 1509. He became the prior's chaplain in 1511, and from then until 1515 he was warden of the Oxford cell. He held the major obediences of terrar and hostillar in the priory from 1515 to 1520, and was elected prior on 3 January 1520. He was an enterprising administrator, having licence from the absentee Bishop Wolsey to exploit the mineral wealth of Weardale. During the final years of the priory the monks were generous in grants of leases and advowsons, and co-operated in the surrender of their cells (subordinate houses). Whitehead was nevertheless bold enough to refuse Henry VIII a lease for a client in 1538. He is said to have been present as the shrine of St Cuthbert was destroyed in 1539. The house surrendered on 31 December that year; Whitehead was named dean of the successor secular chapter in the charter of foundation, of 12 May 1541. Over half his former monastic colleagues were accommodated in the new cathedral body; while their interest predominated, life in the close at Durham was uneventful.<br>
<br>In the last year of his life Whitehead was caught up in treason charges intended to unseat the conservative Bishop Tunstall. The privy council had in August 1550 investigated a report that &#145;great quantitie of treasure&#146; had been taken to the dean's house  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, 3.102). In May 1551 Whitehead was summoned to London and examined by a committee of councillors. On 3 November he was bound in 200 marks to appear before them again on the first day of the following term; but by 8 November he had died in London. He was buried in the church of Holy Trinity Minories, London. His kinsmen Thomas and Hugh received what goods he left in London. Whitehead owned a number of books which survive (including an old breviary, BL, Harleian MS 4664), some of which he gave to his fellow monks.<br>
