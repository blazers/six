<span class="headword">Wilson,  James Maurice</span>  (1836&#150;1931), <span class="occ">headmaster and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at King William's College, Isle of Man, on 6 November 1836, the younger of twin sons of Edward Wilson (1802&#150;1876), first principal, from 1833 to 1838, of King William's College and later vicar of Nocton, Lincolnshire, and his first wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1842), eldest daughter of James Pears, rector of Charlcombe and headmaster of Bath grammar school. Steuart Adolphus Pears, the headmaster of Repton, was his uncle. He was educated first by an incompetent governess and then by his father, before being sent in 1848 to King William's College, where he suffered bullying, cruelty, and neglect. He then spent two years at Sedbergh. When in 1855 he went up to St John's College, Cambridge, he had read a good deal of Latin and Greek, but little else, except that his early training in an evangelical household had given him a very thorough knowledge of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>.<br>
<br>In March 1856 Wilson was bracketed second with Henry Sidgwick for the Bell university scholarship: in the following term, in order to compete for a college scholarship in which advanced mathematics were required, he took a short but intensive course in that subject, and showed so much promise that he was pressed to read for the mathematical tripos, in which he came out senior wrangler (1859). A nervous breakdown followed, the result of overwork, which erased from his mind all the advanced mathematics so triumphantly acquired. Recovering this knowledge required him to learn again from scratch. He stood for a fellowship at his college a year later and was elected on his classics.<br>
<br>Wilson had already in 1859 been appointed to a mathematical mastership at Rugby by Frederick Temple. His chief duty was to organize the teaching of science there. The subject was new to him and new to the school's curriculum, but he tackled the problem with enthusiasm. A chemistry laboratory was built in 1861 and an astronomical observatory was added in 1877. He was soon engaged in schemes for developing science teaching throughout the country, and served with T. H. Huxley and John Tyndall on a committee of the British Association appointed to study the question. His contribution on teaching natural science in schools to <span class="italic">Essays on a Liberal Education</span> (1867), edited by F. W. Farrar, argued that its development depended on encouragement from the universities. He was also interested in modernizing the teaching of mathematics and, in particular, breaking away from the traditional teaching of geometry based on Euclid. His textbooks on <span class="italic">Elementary Geometry</span> (1869&#150;78) were criticized by C. L. Dodgson (1879). He was one of the original promoters of the Association for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching which eventually (1897) became the Mathematical Association; he was president in 1921.<br>
<br>In 1863 Wilson succeeded to a boarding-house, and five years later (18 December 1868) he married Annie Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1878), daughter of Edward Moore, bank clerk, of Douglas, Isle of Man. He was devoted to Temple, but was not happy under his two successors. With his brother-in-law, Arthur Sidgwick, Wilson opposed the Conservative Henry Hayman, and he found the easy-going T. W. Jex-Blake too lacking in moral and spiritual fervour. Unusually for a public-school housemaster of this period he was a layman, and about 1875, wanting to teach Christianity in the broad-church spirit of Temple, he applied to Henry Philpott, bishop of Worcester, to enter holy orders. Philpott refused to ordain him on learning that he no longer accepted the verbal inspiration of scripture, rejected <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> miracles, and doubted the virgin birth. On the sudden death of his wife in July 1878 Wilson decided to give up schoolmastering, but in October 1878 his plans changed when John Percival, also a former Rugby master, liberal, and broad-churchman, recommended Wilson as his successor as headmaster of Clifton College, Bristol. Wilson was reluctant, but pressure was brought from various quarters, and Temple, when consulted, urged him to accept. He finally agreed. Before he took office as head he was ordained deacon and priest by Temple, &#145;the first time, so far as is known, a bishop accepted for ordination an Anglican who held a suspended judgment about all physical miracles&#146;  (Chadwick, 145), though on the understanding that he should not publicize his controversial views.<br>
<br>Twenty years at Rugby were followed by eleven years (1879&#150;90) as headmaster of Clifton. These were perhaps the happiest years of Wilson's life. He had been deeply influenced by one great headmaster, Temple, and was following another, Percival, the maker of Clifton, and found there an unusually able staff, including his old friend the poet T. E. Brown. He returned to his old love, the classics, and his lessons in Plato and Thucydides were an inspiration and revelation to his sixth form. He was a born teacher and preacher, and his influence on the school was probably exerted more through his sermons (published in 1883) than by any other means. Simple, direct, and stimulating, they came home to boys of every age and temperament. His address to teachers on &#145;Morality in public schools&#146; was one of the first attempts publicly to address the sexual problems arising in boys' boarding-schools, and marked the beginning of concerted action by headmasters to uphold the ideal of purity.<br>
<br>The busy life of a school did not monopolize Wilson's energies: he was active in civic affairs in Bristol. Percival had started a school mission in the poorest part of the city and this work was greatly extended by Wilson, who felt that education which ignored social duties and responsibilities was of little value. He was the first headmaster to introduce a summer camp for working-class boys, run by members of the school. His second wife, Georgina Mary (1853/4&#150;1926), daughter of Admiral J. T. Talbot, whom he married on 26 March 1883, took part in social work among girls in Bristol after the example of Josephine Butler. Wilson himself gave public lectures to answer secularists (see his <span class="italic">Essays and Addresses</span>, 1887), and continued his interest in biblical criticism. His paper to the church congress in 1888 on <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> criticism  (published in his <span class="italic">Some Contributions to the Religious Thought of our Time</span>, 1888) brought him wider notice as a liberal theologian.<br>
<br>In 1890 the bishop of Manchester, James Moorhouse, who was sympathetic to his broad-churchmanship, offered Wilson the living of Rochdale with the archdeaconry of Manchester, and his growing interest in social work decided him to accept the invitation. Fifteen years of strenuous service followed. There was bitter rivalry between church and chapel, and his efforts to introduce more charity and to secure co-operation were regarded with suspicion by die-hards in both camps. Although Wilson was a liberal in outlook, and determined to work with nonconformists, he was an uncompromising advocate of the national church and its role in education, and was in conflict with the nonconformist-dominated school board. He went ahead with building and extending church schools in the parish, in the face of the opposition marshalled by J. Hirst Hollowell; he also supported the 1902 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>, which abolished the school boards. The principles of his work in stimulating church life in a growing industrial district by such means as the formation of a strong Lay Helpers Association were discussed in his <span class="italic">Six Lectures on Pastoral Theology</span> (1903). In spite of exacting duties he found time for lectures on many subjects, and nearly fifty sermons, addresses, and other papers appeared in print during these years, including his Hulsean lectures delivered at Cambridge in 1898&#150;9 and published in the latter year as <span class="italic">The Gospel of the Atonement</span>.<br>
<br>In 1905 Wilson was offered and accepted a canonry at Worcester, which gave him leisure from parochial work. He became governor of the Worcester College for the Blind; as receiver-general he took over the accounts of the chapter, and as cathedral librarian he discovered a new field of activity. There were scores of old manuscripts which had never been properly examined, and he learned how to decipher the abbreviations and medieval script. Nearly 6000 items were catalogued and a series of publications followed, until failing eyesight put an end to his study of manuscripts. In 1908 he stepped in temporarily as headmaster of the King's School, Worcester. He also became president of a committee formed to find a remedy for the high infantile death rate in the city, and in six years' time the rate was halved. Another cause which he championed was that of playgrounds and open spaces.<br>
<br>In 1926 growing deafness and blindness forced Wilson to resign his canonry. His second wife died later in the same year. But neither loneliness nor physical infirmities could quench his mental vigour or his interest in life. His tastes were frugal and his chief recreations card playing and solving chess problems. Wilson died at his home, Hither Northfield, Steep, near Petersfield, Hampshire, on 15 April 1931. He was buried in the churchyard at Steep. With his first wife he had two sons, of whom the elder was killed in action in 1915 and the younger was killed by an accident in youth, and two daughters, the elder of whom was the author <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70137/', "Mona Wilson")</script>; with his second wife he had one daughter and three sons, of whom the eldest was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36944/', "Sir Arnold Talbot Wilson")</script> of the Indian political service, the second was killed in action in 1916, and the youngest was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36961/', "Sir James Steuart Wilson")</script>, the singer.<br>
<br>&#145;No scientific discovery can be contrary to religion. The mere apprehension that this could be so is itself a deep infidelity.&#146; These words give the key to much of Wilson's theological writings, for to him one of the tasks of the age in which he lived was to present the underlying truth in terms not inconsistent with the new knowledge, and to separate the essential from the inessential in traditional theology. &#145;The essence of Christianity is the individual experience of Christ, but God reveals himself in the physical laws of the universe as well as in the voice of conscience, so that any contradiction between them is impossible.&#146; On such problems Wilson tried to throw light, and many, even if they could not agree with his conclusions, would recognize in him not only a fearless, honest, and deeply earnest thinker, but a warm-hearted human being to whom religion was the great reality of life. Wilson's intellectual gifts and inexhaustible energy, his intuition and imagination, his omnivorous curiosity and swift power of mastering the essentials of a problem would have made him a prominent figure in any profession; had he confined himself to any one field, he might have been remembered as one of the greatest thinkers or discoverers of his times.<br>
