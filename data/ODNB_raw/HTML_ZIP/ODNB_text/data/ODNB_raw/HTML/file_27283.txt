<span class="headword">Thompson,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1730&#150;1800), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, sometimes referred to as Blarney Thompson, was born in Dublin. He received his artistic education in London, and does not seem to have exhibited his works elsewhere. He lived for several years at Warwick Court, Holborn, and subsequently at Half Moon Street, Piccadilly. Between 1760 and 1782 he exhibited forty-three pictures at the Society of Artists, of which he was for some time secretary, and one at the Free Society of Artists. The majority of these were portraits, but he also showed pictures of historical and classical subject matter, for example, <span class="italic">A Wounded Officer Supported from the Field of Battle at Minden</span> (exh. Society of Artists, 1762) and <span class="italic">Jupiter and Leda</span> (exh. Society of Artists, 1764). Though acknowledged as good likenesses, his portraits, now known chiefly in print form, were generally considered to have been of limited artistic merit. Thompson's portraits include <span class="italic">Cadwallader, 9th Baron Blayney, Lord Lieutenant of Co. Monaghan and Grand Master of the Masons</span>; <span class="italic">Anna Swan</span>; <span class="italic">Sir Edward Hamilton, 1st Bart. of Trebinshun</span>, and <span class="italic">Henry Baker</span>, a portrait of the naturalist and author. All of these were engraved in mezzotint, stipple, or lithograph. His marriage to a wealthy woman allowed him temporarily to relinquish his profession, but he fell into debt and was incarcerated in the king's bench prison. His noisy protests against his imprisonment earned for him considerable notoriety; Thompson produced a portrait of James Stephen, author of <span class="italic">Considerations on Imprisonment for Debt</span>, who had been a fellow prisoner in the king's bench. After the death of his first wife Thompson married Mary, another rich woman in whose boarding-school he had taught drawing, which enabled him to retire for good from active work. He joined the notorious circle associated with Mrs Theresa Cornely's house in Soho Square, where he founded and ran a school of oratory. He died suddenly in London early in 1800, his will being proved on 4 February; his wife survived him.<br>
<br>Thompson published <span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Elementary Principles of Beauty in the Works of Nature and Art</span>, and also, anonymously, in 1771, <span class="italic">The Conduct of the Royal Academicians while Members of the Society of Arts, from 1760 to their Expulsion in 1769</span>. He was, according to Strickland, given the nickname Blarney because of his &#145;specious address and love of talking&#146;  (Strickland, 447).<br>
