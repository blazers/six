<span class="headword">Corkine,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1610&#150;1617), <span class="occ">composer</span>, brought out two volumes of accompanied solo songs, both with other music for instruments. His first, <span class="italic">Ayres, to sing and play to the lute and basse violl, with pavins, galliards, almains and corantoes for the lyra violl</span>, appeared in 1610. The newly fashionable lyra viol was played from tablature like a lute, but chords were restricted to adjacent strings because of the use of a bow. Corkine's <span class="italic">The second booke of ayres, some to sing and play to the base-violl alone, others to be sung to the lute and base violl, with new corantoes, pavins, almaines: as also divers new descants upon old grounds, set to the lyra-viol</span> (1612) begins with songs for voice and bass viol alone, in which both parts have an equal importance, rather than being a melody and its harmonic bass. The setting of John Donne's &#145;Break of Day&#146; is particularly successful. Corkine combined the new chordal lyra viol techniques with traditional &#145;divisions&#146;, in which a relatively slow-moving melodic line was divided into running passage work, and here he used the entire compass of the instrument. This is evident in the &#145;new descants upon old grounds&#146; in his setting of the melody for &#145;Come live with me and be my love&#146;.<br>
<br>Describing himself as &#145;a poor man indebted to many&#146;, Corkine dedicated parts of his books to different people, seven in all, rather than inscribing each volume to a single patron. One of his dedicatees was Edward Herbert, later Lord Herbert of Cherbury, whose own manuscript lute book indicates that he was himself no mean player. A song, &#145;What booteth Love&#146;, for voice and three instruments (probably viols), was included in a 1956 recording, but the original was lost sight of until it was rediscovered in 1983 by David Greer, who also found a second song, &#145;Sad is the time&#146;, in the same source. This is a combined volume of John Dowland's first three printed books of ayres, into which the manuscript songs were introduced  (Greer). In 1617 a passport was issued by the privy council to a certain George Vincent &#145;to goe over to the Prince of Poland, and to carry over with him to the sayd Prince his master these musicians&#146;, including one &#145;Wm Corkin&#146;, perhaps indicating the pronunciation of his name  (Limon, 101).<br>
