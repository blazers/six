<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Chamberlain, Sir  Neville Bowles</span>  (1820&#150;1902), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Rio de Janeiro on 10 January 1820, the second son of Henry Chamberlain, consul-general and charg&eacute; d'affaires in Brazil, and his second wife, Anne Eugenia (<i>d</i>. 28 Aug 1867), daughter of William Morgan of London. His father was created a baronet in 1828, and died on 31 July 1829. By his second marriage (his first had been dissolved in 1813) Henry Chamberlain had five sons and three daughters. The eldest son, William Charles (1818&#150;1878), became an admiral; the other four entered the East India Company's service and distinguished themselves as soldiers. The third son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32348/', "Sir Crawford Trotter Chamberlain")</script>, was closely associated with Neville throughout his military career. The fourth son, Thomas Hardy (1822&#150;1879), was major-general, Bombay staff corps. The fifth son, Charles Francis Falcon CB (1826&#150;1870), was colonel in the Bombay staff corps.<br>
<br>At thirteen, on the nomination of Lord Beresford, Neville entered the Royal Military Academy as a cadet; but, more combative than studious, he was withdrawn at the end of his probationary year. On 24 February 1837, on the nomination of Mr Buckle, a director of the East India Company, he was commissioned as ensign in the company's army. He reached Calcutta in June and was posted to the 55th Bengal native infantry, joining it at Lucknow early in 1838. On 28 August he was transferred to the 16th Bengal native infantry, which was at Delhi. His brother Crawford was serving in the same regiment. Sir Henry Fane, the commander-in-chief and a friend of his father, wished the two sons to take part in the imminent invasion of Afghanistan.<br>
<br>The 16th formed part of the army of the Indus; at the end of June the army marched on Kabul and on 23 July Ghazni was stormed. Chamberlain distinguished himself in the fighting which preceded this assault. His regiment was left at Ghazni when the army moved on to Kabul, and the brothers became friendly with some of the sons of Dost Muhammad, who were on parole there. In June 1841 the 16th was relieved at Ghazni by the 27th, in which <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20141/', "John Nicholson")</script> was a subaltern. He and Neville Chamberlain became close friends.<br>
<br>On 25 August the 16th arrived at Kandahar, and on 8 November set out for India, but the outbreak at Kabul led to its immediate recall to Kandahar. During the next nine months General Nott's force had repeated encounters with the Afghans, in which Chamberlain was prominent. He was temporarily appointed to the 1st cavalry of Shah Shuja's force, and soon made a name for himself as a daring leader of irregular horse. In the action of the Arghandab (12 January 1842) he was wounded in the knee, but nevertheless took part in the pursuit. In March his men failed him, and he had to fight hard for his life. On 29 May he was again wounded, in the thigh. He was awarded a gratuity of twelve months' pay for his injuries.<br>
<br>In August 1842 Nott's force marched from Kandahar on Kabul. Chamberlain went with it, and took part in the capture and burning of Istalif on 28 September, which made him &#145;disgusted with myself, the world, and, above all, with my cruel profession&#146;  (Forrest, 149). The combined forces of Nott and Pollock left Kabul on 12 October. Chamberlain, with the rear-guard, was twice wounded, in the spine and in the leg. In nearly four years in Afghanistan he had been wounded six times. General Nott so praised him that on 2 January 1843 he was appointed to the governor-general's bodyguard. This did not remove him from his regiment (the 16th), in which he had become lieutenant on 16 July 1842.<br>
<br>Though still suffering from his last wound, Chamberlain took part in the Gwalior campaign and in the battle of Maharajpur on 29 December 1843. On 20 February 1845 he left Calcutta for England, very reluctantly, for the First Anglo-Sikh War was imminent, but this was regarded as his only chance of cure. He returned to India at the end of 1846, having partially recovered the use of his leg. He was military secretary to the governor of Bombay until May 1848, and was then employed for a few months at Indore; but on the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Sikh War he was appointed brigade major of a cavalry brigade.<br>
<br>In the operations preceding the passage of the Chenab Lord Gough called for a volunteer to swim the river and reconnoitre the right bank. Chamberlain swam across with a few men of the 9th lancers, found that the Sikhs had gone, and was greeted by Gough on his return as &#145;the bravest of the brave&#146;. At Chilianwala his brigade was left to protect the baggage, but at Gujrat it was actively engaged. Chamberlain distinguished himself in the pursuit, and Gough promised him the command of a regiment of irregular cavalry. When he became captain in his regiment on 1 November 1849 he was given a brevet majority.<br>
<br>In May 1849 Chamberlain was appointed assistant adjutant-general of the Sirhind division, but he soon tired of office routine. In December he was made assistant commissioner in the Rawalpindi district, from where he was transferred to Hazara in June 1850 and organized the military police for the Punjab.<br>
<br>After a bad bout of malaria in late 1852 Chamberlain went to South Africa on sick leave and spent a year and a half hunting lion. He returned to India at the end of 1854 to take up the command of the Punjab irregular force, which Lord Dalhousie had reserved for him. This force, modelled upon the corps of Guides, numbered 11,000 men and had to guard 700 miles of frontier against turbulent tribes. Chamberlain was only a captain in his regiment, but he was made brevet lieutenant-colonel (28 November 1854) and was given the local rank of brigadier. &#145;That glorious soldier&#146;  (Barthorp, 51), as Lumsden called him, was liked and respected by all who knew him. He was thanked by government for his services on the frontier.<br>
<br>In May 1857, at the Indian mutiny, a column was formed to crush any outbreak in the Punjab, and Chamberlain was given command of it. But he soon handed this over to John Nicholson, being appointed adjutant-general of the Bengal army, and he joined the force before Delhi on 24 June. He took a leading part in repulsing the attacks of the mutineers on 9 and 14 July. In the latter action, seeing that the men hesitated before a wall lined by the enemy, he leapt his horse over it. They followed him, but he was shot in his shoulder, which partially disabled him for the rest of the siege. He helped, however, to stiffen the wavering purpose of the British commander during the storming of the city, and on 16 September he took temporary command of the force. He received the thanks of the governor-general, and was made CB on 11 November 1857.<br>
<br>Chamberlain was prevented by his wound from taking part in the relief of Lucknow, and had to decline Sir Colin Campbell's offer of command of the cavalry in the Rohilla campaign of 1858. He resigned the post of adjutant-general and was reappointed to the command of the Punjab irregular force with the rank of brevet colonel on 27 November 1857, and the local rank of brigadier-general. In August 1858 he crushed a dangerous conspiracy among the Sikh troops at Dera Ismail Khan. In December 1859 he led an expedition against the Kabul Khel Wazirs, and another in April 1860 against the Mahsuds, forcing his way to Kaniguram, which they boasted that hostile eyes had never seen. His force was composed entirely of native troops, including some men led by their own chiefs. On 11 April 1863 he was made KCB.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1863 Chamberlain commanded a force of 5000 men against the Wahabi fanatics at Sitana. He decided to take one column from Peshawar over the Ambela Pass into the Chamla valley, while another column co-operated from Hazara. He reached the top of the pass on 20 October. During fierce fighting Chamberlain received a wound in the arm, which obliged him to hand over command. Lord Elgin the governor-general, died on the same day, and his council decided to withdraw the expedition. Chamberlain opposed this; eventually reinforcements were sent and under General Garvock the Yusufzai field force completed its task.<br>
<br>Chamberlain went home as soon as he was fit to travel, and joined his mother and sisters at Versailles in July 1864. He was promoted major-general on 5 August 1864, and was made KCSI on 24 May 1866. In 1869 he accompanied the duke of Edinburgh on his visit to India. He was promoted lieutenant-general on 1 May 1872, GCSI on 24 May 1874, and GCB on 29 May 1876. On 26 June 1873 he married Charlotte Cuyler, sixth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23345/', "Major-General Sir William Reid")</script>; she died on 26 December 1896 without children.<br>
<br>Chamberlain returned to India in February 1876 to take command of the Madras army. When it was decided, in August 1878, to send a British mission to Kabul, he agreed to go as envoy, but the mission was stopped at Ali Masjid on 21 September by the amir's orders. Chamberlain agreed with Lord Lytton that this insult should be punished, and he acted for some months as military member of council. But he did not wholly approve of the treaty of Gandamak, still less of Lytton's policy of retribution after the second occupation of Kabul and the continuance of the army's commitments in Afghanistan. He opposed the retention of Kandahar in 1880.<br>
<br>Chamberlain's Madras command ended on 3 February 1881, and he left India. He spent the rest of his life at Lordswood, near Southampton. He had become general on 1 October 1877, was placed on the unemployed supernumerary list on 3 February 1886, and was made field marshal on 25 April 1900. He died at Lordswood on 18 February 1902, and was buried beside his wife at Rownhams near Southampton.<br>
