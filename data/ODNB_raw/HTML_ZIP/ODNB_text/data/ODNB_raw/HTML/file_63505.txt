<span class="headword">Ducarel,  Gerard Gustavus</span>  (1745&#150;1800), <span class="occ">East India Company servant</span>, was born on 15 April 1745 in London, the youngest of the four children of Adrian Colt&eacute;e Ducarel (1718&#150;1745), a merchant and director of the South Sea Company, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hamilton (1719&#150;1792). He was a nephew of the antiquarian Andrew Colt&eacute;e Ducarel. The Huguenot family emigrated to England from Caen around 1715.<br>
<br>In 1758 Gusty Ducarel was a midshipman in the Royal Navy and present at the siege of Louisburg. He was still in the navy in 1762 but, under Lord Clive's patronage, he obtained a writership in the East India Company, arriving in Calcutta in December 1765. Almost at once he placed himself in an invidious position by improvidently signing a memorial objecting to Clive's plan to transfer Madras officials to Bengal. Full of remorse he hurriedly withdrew his name. After brief spells as deputy paymaster to the 1st brigade, assistant cash keeper to the governor, and Persian translator to the resident at Murshidabad, he was appointed supervisor at Purnea in 1770. Purnea was a poverty-stricken district with tracts of wasteland and depressed smallholdings. Ducarel disapproved of the official policy of short-term revenue farming, but his measures to revive the local economy were vitiated by famine and the obtuseness of the superior revenue authorities. Although he left Purnea in 1772, his service there earned him recognition as an able and imaginative fiscal administrator. Several short appointments followed until he became fourth member of the Calcutta committee of revenue in 1775.<br>
<br>In October 1774 Philip Francis alighted in Calcutta as a member of the newly established Bengal supreme council. Like Ducarel he was attached to the Clive interest, and Ducarel soon became his adviser on the revenue and a personal friend. Ducarel declined an important part in Warren Hastings's survey of the revenue system (the <i>amini</i> commission) inaugurated in 1776. His appointment as superintendent of the <i>khalsa</i> (treasury) in July 1778 was managed by Francis. Beyond the call of official duty, Ducarel assisted in the escapade at the house of G. F. Grand on 8 December 1778 which culminated in Francis's appearance in court as defendant in an action for criminal conversation during which Ducarel was called as a witness. In December 1779 he was an intermediary in the opening of negotiations to try to arrange an accommodation between Francis and Hastings.<br>
<br>When Francis left India in December 1780 his associates were left without a patron and protector. Although Hastings listed Ducarel among &#145;the lees of Mr. Francis&#146;  (Gleig, 2.384&#150;6), he conceded an obligation to indemnify him for loss of office when a centralized revenue committee formed in Calcutta in 1781 absorbed the functions of the <i>khalsa</i>. Thus, in 1782, Ducarel was appointed commissioner at Burdwan, where he remained until he retired and returned to England in 1784.<br>
<br>Ducarel began a relationship with Elizabeth (Bibi) Mirza (<i>c</i>.1758&#150;1822) in the early 1770s. They had six children: five were born in India and one in England. She accompanied Ducarel back to his retirement home in Exmouth, Devon. Presumably at some stage she converted from Islam to Christianity, and they probably married, most likely in India between 1780 and 1784 (they had not married by 22 April 1780, when the youngest of three recorded natural children was born). An Indian traveller, Abu Taleb, wrote of visiting Ducarel's house, seemingly in London, about 1799 or 1800. He saw portraits of Indian acquaintances and described Mrs Ducarel as &#145;very fair and so accomplished in all the English manners and language, that I was sometime in her company before I could be convinced she was a native of India&#146;  (Abu Taleb Khan, 1.198&#150;9). Philip Francis facetiously alluded to Ducarel's diminutive stature (he was 5 feet &frac12; inch tall) in a letter to his wife written from Paris, where Ducarel and he were on a visit in September 1784  (Parkes and Merivale, 2.219). Although a good deal occupied with family affairs in retirement, two letters from Francis in 1795 suggest that Ducarel was anxious about the effects of the continuance of the war with France. Ducarel died at Stilton, Huntingdonshire, on 14 December 1800 while travelling. He was an efficient and principled administrator, respected though regarded warily by Hastings for his closeness to Francis.<br>
