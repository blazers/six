<span class="headword">Blanchard,  William</span>  (1769&#150;1835), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born at Nessgate, York, on 2 January 1769, and for a few years was educated at a private school in that city. Both his father, John Blanchard, a staymaker and hosier, and his mother, Ann Bowzer, or Nancy as she was commonly called, died when he was still a child, and he was left to the care of his uncle, William Blanchard, long well known as the proprietor of the <span class="italic">York Chronicle</span>. In 1782 he was placed in his uncle's office, but he took such delight in Shakespeare that in 1785 he resolved to become an actor. He joined Welsh's company of travelling comedians at Buxton. His first appearance was as Allan-a-Dale in MacNally's <span class="italic">Robin Hood</span>. For four years he played under the name of Bentley, but from 1789 he resumed his own name. He took the parts of Achmet, Douglas, and even Romeo. Blanchard next became a manager and opened theatres at Penrith, Hexham, Barnard Castle, and Bishop Auckland, but he lost a lot of money, and abandoned this occupation to join Brunton's company of players on the Norwich circuit, taking on comic parts.<br>
<br>Blanchard's first appearances in London were at Covent Garden in October 1800, as Bob Acres in Sheridan's <span class="italic">The Rivals</span> and Crack in Thomas Knight's musical farce <span class="italic">The Turnpike Gate</span>. He was so successful that he remained at Covent Garden, except for a brief professional visit to America in 1832, continuously for thirty-four years. He was especially noted for playing Shakespeare's Fluellen, Sir Hugh Evans, Menenius, and Polonius. According to Leigh Hunt, his best performance was as the Marquis de Grand-Ch&acirc;teau in the musical toy show <span class="italic">The Cabinet</span>. Hunt also praised highly his Russett in Colman's <span class="italic">The Jealous Wife</span>.<br>
<br>On 15 May 1807 Blanchard's first wife, Susan, an actress, died, leaving behind four children. On 15 October 1808 Blanchard married the Sarah Harrold (1784&#150;1875), a schoolfriend of one of his daughters. They had two sons, William and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2602/', "Edward Litt Laman Blanchard (1820&#150;1889)")</script>; the latter later became famous as a writer of pantomimes and Christmas extravaganzas. Blanchard's daughter Elizabeth also took to the stage; she appeared at Covent Garden and the Haymarket and, after marrying Thomas Hamblin about 1824, continued playing under her married name.<br>
<br>In 1831 Blanchard was engaged by Hamblin to appear at the Bowery Theatre, New York, and subsequently performed in Boston and Baltimore. This trip, however, was not very successful, so eventually he returned to England. The last character created by him was that of Counsellor Crowsfoot in Douglas Jerrold's comedy <span class="italic">Nell Gwynne</span>, produced at Covent Garden in January 1833.<br>
<br>Blanchard's death occurred suddenly. On 6 May 1835 he dined with a friend and left for home at 6 p.m. Some nine hours later he was found in a ditch, having had a fit. Two more attacks followed before he died, on 9 May 1835, at his residence, 1 Camera Square, Chelsea. He was buried in the graveyard of St Luke's Church, Chelsea. Sarah Blanchard survived her husband nearly forty years; she died on 15 February 1875.<br>
