<span class="headword">Vernon,  Richard</span>  (1726&#150;1800), <span class="occ">horse-racing entrepreneur and politician</span>, was born on 18 June 1726 and baptized on the same day in Shaveshill, Staffordshire, the fifth son of the seven children of Henry Vernon (1663&#150;1732), MP for Hilton, Staffordshire, and his wife Penelope Phillips (<i>d</i>. 1726), daughter and coheir of Robert Phillips of Newton Regis, Warwickshire. Two of his elder brothers were Henry Vernon (1718&#150;1765), who became MP for Lichfield and then Newcastle under Lyme, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28238/', "Admiral Sir Edward Vernon (1723&#150;1794)")</script>.<br>
<br>After travelling in Italy and France in 1743, Vernon was appointed ensign in the 1st regiment of Horse Guards on 22 November 1744. He was promoted lieutenant and captain on 12 January 1747, but resigned on 30 October 1751 in order to enter politics. He attached himself to John Russell, fourth duke of Bedford, and acted as his second secretary when Bedford was lord lieutenant of Ireland. He was returned to parliament on 10 December 1754 for the duke's borough of Tavistock, and, as member for Bedford in the succeeding parliament, was appointed in April 1764 a clerk comptroller of the household. He was re-elected for the same constituency in the next parliament (1768&#150;74), and sat for Okehampton from 1774 to 1780, and for Newcastle under Lyme from 1784 to 1790. There is no evidence that he ever spoke in the Commons during the thirty-six years he sat as an MP in the chamber.<br>
<br>It was on the turf, and not in the army or in parliament, that Vernon made a name for himself. As early as 4 June 1751 the betting book at the old White's Club records a wager between Lord March and &#145;Capt. Richard Vernon, <i>alias</i> Fox <i>alias</i> Jubilee Dicky&#146;. Vernon was blackballed at the new club the following year on account of his closeness to Bedford, although he was &#145;a very inoffensive, good-humoured young fellow, who lives in the strongest intimacy with all the fashionable young men&#146;  (H. Walpole to Sir Horatio Mann, 2 Feb 1752, Walpole, 20.301). On 15 February 1759 he married at St George's, Bloomsbury, Evelyn Fitzpatrick, countess of Upper Ossory (<i>bap</i>. 1724, <i>d</i>. 1763), widow of John Fitzpatrick, first earl of Upper Ossory, and sixth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16546/', "John Leveson-Gower, first Earl Gower")</script>, and his first wife, Evelyn Pierrepont. She was also the sister of the duchess of Bedford. They had three daughters; she died only four years after their marriage on 12 April 1763 at Montauban, France, where she was buried.<br>
<br>After moving to Newmarket, Vernon entered a racing partnership with Lord March, afterwards the fourth duke of Queensberry, commonly known as Old Q. Thomas Holcroft the dramatist, who was for two and a half years in his stables, thought Vernon &#145;a gentleman of acute notoriety on the turf&#146;. By means of betting and breeding horses Vernon converted &#145;a slender patrimony of three thousand pounds into a fortune of a hundred thousand&#146; before quitting the turf as an owner  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Holcroft</span>, 1.91, 117, 165).<br>
<br>Vernon, who was one of the original members of the Jockey Club, bred and owned a large number of horses. The Vernon Arabian, sire of the dam of Emigrant, winner of the July Stakes in 1796, was owned if not imported by him; and Diomed, winner of the first Derby, came from his stables. He also ran horses for many years, and in 1758 himself rode in a gentleman-jockey race at Newmarket. In 1753 he won one of the two Jockey Club plates, and in 1768 carried off the first Jockey Club challenge cup with Marquis, son of the Godolphin Arabian. At the first Craven meeting (1771) he won the stakes with Pantaloon against a field of thirteen; and his three-year-old Fame by that sire ran second for the first Oaks on 14 May 1779. In 1787 he won the Oaks with Annette (by Eclipse).<br>
<br>Vernon was one of those who began the running of yearlings at Newmarket. In 1791, when the conduct of Chifney, the prince of Wales's jockey, had been criticized by the club but upheld by his master, Old Dick Vernon (as he was called) was reported to have said that the prince, having the best horses and the best jockey, was &#145;best off the turf&#146;. The Jockey Club were his tenants at the old coffee-room at Newmarket. The ground lease was purchased by him in 1771, and bought by the stewards on its expiration sixty years later.<br>
<br>Vernon was an innovative horticulturist and is credited with the introduction of fruit-forcing. His peaches at Newmarket were famous. His sporting traditions were carried on by his nephew, Henry Hilton, whose name appears in the first official list of the Jockey Club, published in 1835.<br>
<br>Vernon died at Newmarket on 16 September 1800. Of his daughters, who are frequently mentioned in Horace Walpole's letters, the eldest, Henrietta, married in 1776 George Greville, second earl of Warwick. The second, Caroline, who shared her father's love for horse-racing, married the wit <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25897/', "Robert Percy Smith (Bobus Smith)")</script>, and was the mother of Robert Vernon Smith, Lord Lyveden, who edited Walpole's correspondence with his grandmother, the countess of Ossory.<br>
