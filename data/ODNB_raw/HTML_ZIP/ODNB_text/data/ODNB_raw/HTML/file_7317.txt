<span class="headword">Davy,  John</span>  (1790&#150;1868), <span class="occ">physiologist and anatomist</span>, was one of the five children of Robert Davy (<i>d</i>. 1794), woodcarver, and Grace Millett. He was the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7314/', "Sir Humphry Davy")</script>. John Davy was born at Penzance, Cornwall, on 24 May 1790. In his childhood he appears to have been helped by his brother, and both boys acknowledged the great assistance they received from their mother. Davy was chiefly educated at the preparatory schools of Penzance. About 1810 he went on to study medicine at Edinburgh University, where he took his MD degree in 1814. When Humphry Davy advanced theories as to the constitution of muriatic acid which were opposed to the teaching of Berthollet, and attacked by Dr Murray, John Davy supported his brother's views. He carried out experiments in the laboratory of Edinburgh University and obtained results which entirely confirmed Humphry Davy's theory.<br>
<br>Davy entered the army as a surgeon, saw a great deal of foreign service, and eventually became inspector of hospitals. He usually made careful notes, and studied especially the characters of the local people who came under his notice, and who were often under his medical care. In 1821 he published <span class="italic">An Account of the Interior of Ceylon and of its Inhabitants, with Travels in that Island</span>. In 1830 Davy married Margaret, daughter of Archibald Fletcher. A daughter, Grace, married George Rolleston, Linacre professor of anatomy and physiology at Oxford.<br>
<br>Davy visited his brother Humphry during his convalescence at Ravenna in 1827, and was present at his brother's death in 1829. In 1836 he edited the <span class="italic">Memoirs of Sir Humphry Davy</span>, and in 1839, his collected works. In the same year Davy published <span class="italic">Researches, Physiological and Anatomical</span>, and in 1842 his <span class="italic">Notes and Observations on the Ionian Islands</span> (2 vols.). In 1849 he published his <span class="italic">Lectures on Chemistry</span>, and <span class="italic">Discourses on Agriculture</span>. He lived in the West Indies for about three years before 1854, and in that year he published a volume entitled <span class="italic">The West Indies before and since Slave Emancipation, Comprising the Windward and Leeward Islands Military Command</span>. As inspector-general of army hospitals, in 1862 he published <span class="italic">On some of the More Important Diseases of the Army, with Contributions to Pathology</span>, and in the following year <span class="italic">Physiological Researches</span>. Up to 1863 Davy had published 152 memoirs and papers in various medical journals and in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Royal Society</span>. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1834. He was a great lover of fishing, and in his <span class="italic">The Angler and his Friends, or, Piscatory Colloquies and Fishing Excursions</span> (1855) he described the deep delight he took in angling in the Lake District.<br>
<br>Davy died at his home at Lesketh How, near Ambleside, Westmorland, on 24 January 1868. His wife survived him.<br>
