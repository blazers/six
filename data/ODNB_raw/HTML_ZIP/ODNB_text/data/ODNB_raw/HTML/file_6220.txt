<span class="headword">Cooper,  John</span>  (1793&#150;1870), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born in Bath, the son of a tradesman. After playing Alonzo in E. Young's <span class="italic">The Revenge</span> in a private theatre, he appeared on the Bath stage, on 14 March 1811, as Inkle in <span class="italic">Inkle and Yarico</span> and subsequently in two or three other parts. Following a short visit to Cheltenham, he appeared on 15 May 1811 at the Haymarket in London as Count Montalban in John Tobin's <span class="italic">The Honeymoon</span>, and, besides playing other characters, was the original William Wyndham in W. Dimond's <span class="italic">Royal Oak</span> and Hartley in Theodore Hook's <span class="italic">Darkness Visible</span>. He then joined Andrew Cherry, the manager of several Welsh theatres, after whose death in 1812 he played in the north of England and Scotland. In Edinburgh he acted Edgar to Edmund Kean's King Lear, and was in Glasgow the original Virginius in Sheridan Knowles's tragedy of that name. In November 1820 he made his first appearance at Drury Lane, as Romeo, and was well received. In the course of the opening season at Drury Lane he played Antony in <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span>, Tullus Aufidius in <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span>, Joseph in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>, Richmond in <span class="italic">Richard III</span>, Iago to Kean's Othello, and many other parts.<br>
<br>Around 1825 Cooper married the widowed actress Mrs Dalton, originally Miss Walton, of Dublin. During the twenty-five years which followed his services were generally in request at Covent Garden, the Haymarket, the English Opera House, and the Surrey. A steady, capable, and eminently conscientious actor, but heavy and mechanical, he played during this period a singularly large number of parts, some of them of leading importance. He was the original Duke of Sheridan Knowles's <span class="italic">Love</span> at Covent Garden in 1839. Among his best parts were Iago and the Ghost in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>. Cooper was also a great favourite in the York and Lincoln circuits, which he quitted for Norwich. There he was appointed stage-manager in 1843, in which year his wife died in London. In September 1845 the Norwich circuit passed into the hands of W. J. A. Abingdon, and Cooper joined Charles Gill at Newmarket. Next he was engaged by Knowles, the proprietor of the Theatre Royal, Manchester, and made his d&eacute;but there as Menenius in <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span>. Cooper was also popular in Hull and Leeds, and finally played under Charles Kean at the Princess's Theatre in London, performing such characters as Henry IV in <span class="italic">Henry IV, Part I</span>, the Duke of York in <span class="italic">Richard II</span>, and Kent in <span class="italic">King Lear</span>. On retirement from the Princess's in 1859 he withdrew from the stage and lived on his savings. At the end of his life he lived at 6 Sandringham Gardens, Ealing, and he died on 13 July 1870 at Tunbridge Wells, where he had gone for his health.<br>
