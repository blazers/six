<span class="headword">Prime,  John</span>  (1549/50&#150;1596), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and preacher</span>, was born in Holywell parish, Oxford&#151;according to Anthony Wood, son of Robert Prime, a fletcher. Scholar of Winchester College from 1564 and then of New College, Oxford, from 1569, he became fellow there in 1571, gaining his BA in 1572 and his MA in 1576. Ordained in 1575, he then proceeded to supplicate successfully for a university preaching licence in 1581, and for the degrees of BTh and DTh in 1584 and 1588 respectively. He established a reputation for aggressively protestant preaching, and fittingly dedicated to Sir Francis Walsingham in 1583 <span class="italic">A Short Treatise of the Sacraments</span> and a longer <span class="italic">Fruitefull and Briefe Discourse &hellip; of Nature &hellip; [and] of Grace</span>, especially directed against the Rheims edition of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, both insisting on the indefectibility of election. Between 1586 and 1590 Prime delivered the Oxford city lecture at Carfax. His longest work, <span class="italic">An Exposition and Observations upon St Paul to the Galatians</span> (1587), was dedicated to John Piers, bishop of Salisbury (possibly also the recipient of a paper by Prime two years before on the question of Christ's descent into hell), and was professedly based upon sermons that Prime had been preaching at Abingdon &#145;every other week&#146;.<br>
<br>Prime made something of a speciality of sermons in the university church, St Mary the Virgin, for Elizabeth's accession day, 17 November. In 1585 he delivered and then rapidly published <span class="italic">Sermon Briefly Comparing the Estate of King Salomon and his Subjects with Queene Elizabeth and her People</span>, in which he seemed to consider himself as compensating for the popish past of New College (perhaps hinting at tensions that he might have experienced there); in 1588 there followed <span class="italic">The Consolations of David Briefly Applied to Queen Elizabeth</span>. This last was dedicated to Thomas Cooper, bishop of Winchester, with expressions of dismay at the attack on him by Martin Marprelate. &#145;Were all thinges amisse, is this the way to reforme &hellip; ?&#146;  (sig. A2). Calvinist theology did not presuppose presbyterian sympathies, and Prime was certainly concerned to dissociate himself from Marprelate. The latter retorted in <span class="italic">Hay any Worke for Cooper</span> (1589), calling Prime &#145;Wynken de Worde&#146;, an otherwise obscure allusion to a printing pioneer which may refer to Prime as having been one of the signatories of the foreword to John Case's <span class="italic">Moral Questions</span> (1585), the first book from Oxford University's press, which soon afterwards printed books by Prime himself. <span class="italic">Hay any Worke</span> threatened, &#145;I'll bepistle you, Dr Prime, when I am at more leisure; though, indeed, I tell you true, that as yet I do disdain to deal with a contemptible trencher-chaplain&#146;  (Pierce, 267).<br>
<br>In 1589 Prime was presented to the New College vicarage of Adderbury, Oxfordshire, being instituted early the following year and soon afterwards quitting his fellowship and lectureships. Perhaps he fulfilled the stern views of parochial duties he had expressed earlier; at any rate he seems to have distracted himself no further with publication. In April 1596 he made his will in &#145;sickness of body&#146;, but with &#145;full hope for a better resurrection&#146;  (Oxfordshire Archives, MS Wills Oxon. 190, 167), leaving his books to his old college and most of his money to his nieces. He died on 11 or 12 April at Adderbury, and was buried there.<br>
