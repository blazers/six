<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Armstrong,  Henry Edward</span>  (1848&#150;1937), <span class="occ">chemist and educational reformer</span>, was born on 6 May 1848 at Caroline Place, Avenue Road, Lewisham, Kent, the eldest son of Richard Armstrong (1827&#150;1884), a commission agent and importer, and his wife, Mary Ann Biddle. He was educated at Colfe Grammar School, Dartmouth Hill, and began to study chemistry in the spring of 1865 at the Royal College of Chemistry in London, first under A. W. Hofmann, and then with Edward Frankland. Within a very short time he was assisting the latter in devising methods for water analysis, particularly for detecting and estimating sewage contamination in public supplies. The methods which they devised were subsequently used by Frankland in a survey of the whole British drinking water supply, which put Britain ahead of all others in its safe provision.<br>
<br>In 1867 Armstrong went to Leipzig to study chemistry under Frankland's friend, Hermann Kolbe (1818&#150;1884), returning in 1870 with the degree of PhD and a passion for research which never left him; it was undoubtedly Kolbe's &#145;try it and see&#146; approach to a research problem that was to inspire his later educational ideas. After holding teaching appointments at St Bartholomew's Hospital (1870&#150;82), where he assisted A. Matthiessen in research on alkaloids, and at the London Institution as professor of chemistry (1871&#150;84), he became associated in 1879 with the City and Guilds of London Institute, first at Finsbury College in Cowper Street where he organized classes in technical chemistry, and then, in 1884, as professor of chemistry at the new Central Institution at South Kensington (after 1893 the Central Technical College). At Finsbury, alongside his engineering colleagues, W. E. Ayrton and J. Perry, and equipped with good laboratory facilities, Armstrong pioneered the heuristic, or &#145;discovery&#146;, method of teaching science. Later, at the Central College, he, Ayrton, and W. C. Unwin were pioneers in designing courses in higher technical education for engineers and chemists. The chemistry school was small, but it produced an impressive amount of research in organic chemistry and was among the first in the country to train chemists for work in factories, and the first to produce what were later called chemical engineers.<br>
<br>Following the formation of Imperial College in 1907 it was inevitable that the Central College would be forced to amalgamate, and when this happened in 1912, Armstrong was forcibly retired, though he was allowed laboratory space until 1913. In his long retirement he became Britain's elder statesman of science, and its Thersites. His interests as a scientist ranged over a wide field of chemistry, which he brought to concise order in his <span class="italic">Introduction to Organic Chemistry</span> (1874) and in a series of entries in successive editions of <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. His researches in the chemistry of naphthalene were of fundamental importance when this substance was becoming increasingly used as a starting material for the manufacture of intermediates for dyestuffs. The value of this work was especially appreciated in Germany. Concurrently he carried out research into the puzzling rules of substitution in benzene derivatives, suggesting a &#145;centric&#146; formula for benzene to explain its chemical behaviour. His double-bond or &#145;quinone&#146; theory of the colour of organic compounds proved a guiding principle for students of dyestuffs until superseded by quantum mechanical ideas.<br>
<br>The theory of aqueous solution was another subject to which Armstrong devoted much attention, and upon which he carried out a great deal of experimental work. He contested hotly the dissociation theory of Svante August Arrhenius and Wilhelm Ostwald on the justifiable ground that the ionic theory took insufficient account of the part played by the solvent and of the complex character of water. Armstrong's mathematical abilities were inadequate to give his alternative ideas a quantitative basis, but in its modern form the dissociation theory has been modified so far as to justify his ferocious criticism. His broad interest in the causes and conditions of chemical change, which he explained in terms of association, or &#145;reversed electrolysis&#146;, meaning that no reactions ever took place without the presence of an electrolyte, were influential on Arthur Lapworth and the development of ideas on the mechanism of chemical reactions. Other subjects of research in his laboratory were the constitution of camphor and its derivatives, the study of plant enzymes, and the crystallography of organic compounds, of which he realized the fundamental importance, for as early as 1886 he invited H. A. Miers to give instruction in the subject. In all this research work Armstrong was assisted by a succession of students, many of whom, such as W. J. Pope, subsequently made their mark in academic and industrial spheres, carrying his influence with them. He was also an accomplished geologist, walking and photographing almost the entire coastline of southern England with a Margate friend, Dr Arthur Rowe. His long association with the Rothamsted Research Station, where he was a member of the Lawes Agricultural Trust committee from 1889 and eventually chairman in 1937, testified to his keen interest in agriculture.<br>
<br>On 30 August 1877 Armstrong married Frances Louisa (1843&#150;1935), daughter of a Lewisham druggist, Thomas Howard Lavers. They had three daughters and four sons, one of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56141/', "Edward Frankland Armstrong (1878&#150;1945)")</script>, became a distinguished industrial chemist.<br>
<br>Armstrong was elected FRS in 1876 and received the Davy medal in 1911. He did much to raise the profile of the Chemical Society, of which he was a fellow for nearly seventy years, and served as secretary for eighteen years, as president from 1893 to 1895, and as councillor for over sixty years. He received the honorary degree of LLD from the University of St Andrews and that of DSc from the universities of Melbourne and Madrid. He was awarded the Messel medal of the Society of Chemical Industry (1922), the Albert medal of the Royal Society of Arts (1930), and the Horace Brown medal of the Institute of Brewing (1926). He spoke and wrote much upon matters of public interest in which the application of science was involved, and was a frequent contributor to <span class="italic">The Times</span>. In retirement he continued as a critic, writer, and lecturer and came to be regarded as the doyen of British chemistry. He believed it his duty to point out the errors of governments, universities, and individuals and to indicate the path they ought to take.<br>
<br>Armstrong was a man of forceful personality who held ideas tenaciously and advocated them vigorously. Immensely sociable and a connoisseur of food and beer, he loved travel and visited America three times, as well as India, Australia, and north Africa. He rendered great service to English education by the reforms which he caused to be brought about in the teaching of science, not least by advocating that all secondary schools should be equipped with laboratories. Between 1884 and 1891 the elementary teaching of science was studied by the British Association, inspired by Armstrong. He believed that young children could find out things for themselves if properly guided, and he strongly advocated the heuristic method, notably in a Board of Education report in 1898. He rendered valuable service to Christ's Hospital school as the Royal Society representative on the council of almoners, guiding its move from Newgate Street to West Horsham in 1902; under his guidance it became one of the best-equipped schools in the country for the teaching of science. His reports and essays on science teaching were collected in his <span class="italic">The Teaching of Scientific Method</span> (1903, 2nd edn, reprinted 1925). Other essays were published in <span class="italic">The Art and Principles of Chemistry</span> (1927).<br>
<br>Armstrong's personality was elegantly summarized by his son-in-law, Stephen Miall, who described him as &#145;a vigorous man physically and mentally, a keen critic, a great worker, a good friend, and a good companion&#146;, and compared him to Dr Johnson, ascribing to his father-in-law &#145;many of the good qualities, and some of the faults characteristic of the great lexicographer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chemistry and Industry</span>, 1935, 669). Armstrong died at his home, 55 Granville Park, Lewisham, on 13 July 1937.<br>
