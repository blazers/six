<span class="headword">Davis, Sir  William Wellclose</span>  (1901&#150;1987), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born in Simla, Punjab, India, on 11 October 1901, the elder son and eldest of the three children of Walter Stewart Davis, of the Indian political service, and his wife, Georgina Rose. Having been to Summer Fields School in Oxford, he joined the Royal Navy as a cadet in May 1915 and attended the Royal Naval College at Osborne, Isle of Wight and Dartmouth. He first went to sea as a midshipman in the battleship <i>Neptune</i> in 1917. He specialized in torpedoes in 1926 and quickly showed his ability as a staff officer. He was fleet torpedo officer to Admiral Sir Frederic Dreyer on the China station and was promoted commander in 1935. He then became fleet torpedo officer and staff officer, plans, to the commander-in-chief, Home Fleet, and was subsequently appointed executive officer of the battle cruiser <i>Hood</i> in January 1939. He served in her for the first eighteen months of the Second World War and was mentioned in dispatches. In 1934 he married Lady (Gertrude) Elizabeth Phipps (<i>d</i>. 1985), second daughter of Constantine Charles Henry Phipps, third marquess of Normanby, canon of St George's Chapel, Windsor, and his wife, Gertrude Stansfeld, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Foster. They had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Promoted captain in December 1940, Davis went to the Admiralty as deputy director of plans. He was for a time seconded to the staff of admiral of the fleet Sir Roger Keyes, director of combined operations. Davis displayed his tact in his handling of Operation Workshop&#151;the projected seizure of the Mediterranean island of Pantelleria, a plan proposed by Keyes and espoused by Winston Churchill, but fiercely resisted by the chiefs of staff and Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham, the commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean. Operation Workshop never took place, but Davis himself emerged with credit, Keyes calling him &#145;the admirable staff officer&#146;. In March 1943 Davis took command of the cruiser <i>Mauritius</i>, a ship in a very sensitive state of discipline which was aggravated in January 1944 when she arrived in Plymouth Sound with her ship's company expecting to pay off. In spite of Davis's representations to the Admiralty, proper leave was not granted and the ship had to return almost at once to the Mediterranean. Her sailors believed, not unreasonably, that they were being punished for previous acts of indiscipline and there was further unrest, with outright refusals of duty. It was a discouraging start, but Davis, with his gift for making people work together, turned the commission into a triumph. <i>Mauritius</i> was the only major British warship to take part in the four invasions, of Sicily, Salerno, Anzio, and Normandy, bombarding enemy shore positions on more than 250 occasions. Later in 1944 <i>Mauritius</i> destroyed two enemy convoys in the Bay of Biscay. Davis himself was mentioned in dispatches three more times and appointed DSO with bar (1944).<br>
<br>After the war Davis was director of the underwater weapons division at the Admiralty, where he helped to form the new electrical branch, and then he became chief of staff to the commander-in-chief, Home Fleet (1948&#150;9). Promoted rear-admiral in 1950, he was naval secretary to three first lords of the Admiralty. From 1952 to 1954 he was flag officer, second in command, Mediterranean Fleet, when the first Earl Mountbatten of Burma was commander-in-chief. It was made clear to Davis that he was to run the fleet while Mountbatten dealt with the numerous political and strategic problems in the Mediterranean.<br>
<br>A tall man, and extremely good-looking in his youth, Davis had great personal charm and a good brain. There was nothing bombastic or dramatic about him; he was no fire-eater. But when he went to the Admiralty in 1954, as vice-chief of the naval staff, he provided the competent, imperturbable staff work which ably supported the much more flamboyant Mountbatten, then first sea lord, during a seemingly interminable series of crises in the late 1950s, notably the &#145;Crabb affair&#146;, when Commander Crabb, a naval frogman, disappeared while allegedly inspecting the propellers of the Soviet cruiser which had brought Nikolay Bulganin and Nikita Khrushchov to Portsmouth in 1956; the Suez operation, later that year, which Mountbatten himself deplored; and the navy's response to the swingeing cuts proposed by the 1957 white paper of Duncan Sandys, a man whom Davis privately thought had little grasp of the strategic needs of the country.<br>
<br>Davis's last appointment, as a full admiral, was from 1958 to 1960 as commander-in-chief, Home Fleet, and NATO commander-in-chief in the eastern Atlantic. He was by then the only senior naval officer still serving who had served in the First World War. He was also the first commander-in-chief to haul down his flag afloat and hoist it again ashore over the &#145;F&uuml;hrer Bunker&#146;, the NATO headquarters at Northwood in Middlesex. He was appointed CB in 1952, KCB in 1956, and GCB in 1959. After he retired in 1960 he devoted much time to county affairs in Gloucestershire. To the end of his life he took a close interest in naval history and naval affairs. William Davis died in hospital in Gloucester on 29 October 1987.<br>
