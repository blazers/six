<span class="headword">Ogle,  Robert (VI)</span>, first Baron Ogle  (<em>c.</em>1406&#150;1469), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was the son of Sir Robert (V) Ogle of Ogle (<i>c</i>.1380&#150;1436) and Matilda (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1380, <i>d</i>. after 1451), daughter of Sir Thomas Grey of Heaton. Through this match he was nephew of the Sir Thomas Grey who married Alice Neville and was executed at Southampton for his part in the plot to murder Henry V, and first cousin to Thomas Grey, who married Isabel, daughter of Richard, earl of Cambridge. His father had been constable of Norham Castle, Northumberland, and sheriff of Norhamshire, 1403&#150;36, a member of parliament for Northumberland in 1416, 1419&#150;20, 1421, and 1425, and sheriff of Northumberland in 1416. He was also constable of Wark Castle in 1419, and warden of Roxburgh Castle in 1424. He died in August 1436. Robert Ogle married Isabel (<i>d</i>. 1478), daughter and heir of Sir Alexander Kirkby of Kirkby Ireleth in Lancashire, and had three sons, Robert, Thomas, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20613/', "Owen Ogle")</script>, and a daughter, Isabel.<br>
<br>Ogle was appointed with his father as a commissioner of truce in 1434, and in 1435 was styled as captain of Berwick, when he was captured in a skirmish by the Scots. He was ransomed for 750 marks and promised indemnification from a Scottish ship seized at Newcastle, but this proved to have been already sold, and he was still trying to get compensation in 1442. He succeeded his father as constable of Norham and sheriff of Norhamshire, and was on numerous commissions for conserving truces with Scotland and arraying the forces of Northumberland against the Scots. He served as sheriff of Northumberland in 1437&#150;8, and was also a member of parliament in 1435 and 1442. In 1438 he was appointed captain of Roxburgh Castle and given charge of the east march of Scotland until a warden was appointed. He occurs in 1452 as bailiff and lieutenant of Tyndale. Three years later he supported the Yorkists when they took up arms, and brought 600 men from the marches to the first battle of St Albans, probably in the train of Richard Neville, earl of Warwick, being a retainer of his father, the earl of Salisbury, at a fee of &pound;20. He was one of the commissioners appointed by the victors to raise money for the defence of Calais. Shortly after Towton (28 March 1461) he and Sir John Conyers were reported to be besieging Henry VI at Carham.<br>
<br>For his services, being the principal Northumbrian gentleman to support the Yorkist cause, Edward IV on 26 July 1461 summoned Ogle to his first parliament as Baron Ogle, and invested him (8 August) with the offices of steward and constable of the castles of Alnwick, Warkworth, and Prudhoe, and with other lordships forfeited by the earl of Northumberland. He was also appointed warden-general of the east marches, an office previously held by the earl. In October 1462 Ogle distinguished himself in the dash upon Holy Island, which resulted in the capture of all the French leaders who had come over with Margaret of Anjou, except de Br&eacute;z&eacute;, and during the operations against the Northumbrian strongholds in the winter Ogle assisted John Neville, Lord Montagu, in the siege of Bamburgh, which surrendered on Christmas eve. Betrayed to the Lancastrians again in the following year, the castle was finally reduced in June 1464, and entrusted to Ogle as constable for life. Just a year later he was commissioned with Montagu, now earl of Northumberland, and others, to negotiate for peace with Scotland, and for a marriage between James III and an English subject. In compensation for the loss of custody of the Percy estates with their transfer to Montagu, he received in April 1465 a grant in fee tail of the lordship of Redesdale and castle of Harbottle in central Northumberland, forfeited by Sir William Tailboys of Kyme in Lincolnshire, who was executed after the battle of Hexham in 1464. To these were added other forfeited lands in Northumberland. Lord Ogle's consistent loyalty to the Nevilles and the house of York may be explained by the fact that William Bertram, the cousin whose inheritance of Bothal Ogle's father had disputed, had been retained since 1440 by Henry Percy, second earl of Northumberland. Ogle died on 1 November 1469.<br>
