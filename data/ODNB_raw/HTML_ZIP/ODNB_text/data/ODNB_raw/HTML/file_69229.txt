<span class="headword">Scott,  Robert</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1632, <em>d.</em> 1709/10), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was the son of Arthur Scott, clerk of York. Nothing is known about his early childhood or his education, but on 10 January 1649 he was apprenticed to Daniel Frere, a London bookseller. After two years he was turned over to the bookseller William Wells, and freed of the Stationers' Company on 31 March 1656. His name appears in imprints rather infrequently from the year 1661 with the address <i>ad insignia</i> <i>Principis</i> <i>in vico</i> <i>Little Britain</i> <i>dicto</i>, or in English at the Prince's Armes in Little Britain, London, which was to remain his address throughout his career. He was made a liveryman of the Stationers' Company on 20 April 1664. At some point he married a daughter of William Wells; this may have been the Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1697) who was noted as Scott's wife in the marriage tax assessment for the London parish of St Botolph, Aldersgate, in 1695.<br>
<br>The 1670s and 1680s were the busiest years for Scott as a publisher, judging by the number of publications that carried his name, although his total output was never as large as that of some of his contemporaries. He frequently published works in association with other booksellers, in the early years often with William Wells, his former master. His publications range from solid theological or scientific volumes such as George Bull's <span class="italic">Harmonia apostolica</span> (1670) or Marcello Malpighi's <span class="italic">Opera omnia</span> (1686) to popular literature, such as <span class="italic">The Famous History of the Seven Champions</span> (1687) and <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> (1675). He also published several works written by John Evelyn. After the death of William Wells in early 1673 Scott went into publishing partnership with his brother-in-law, George Wells, but Scott was first and foremost a bookseller, selling books to people such as Samuel Pepys and Robert Hooke. Scott was considered the major importer of scholarly books in Latin from the continent and made frequent trips abroad to supplement his stock and to fulfil commissions given him by cherished customers such as John Cosin, bishop of Durham. In 1674 he brought out his <span class="italic">Catalogus librorum ex variis Europae partibus advectorum</span> of well over 200 pages with about 6500 items. A large part of his stock (25,000 items in 8800 lots) was sold in 1688 in an auction organized by his former apprentice Benjamin Walford, but Scott retained a bookshop, possibly on a smaller scale, until at least 1692, when Pepys mentions to his friend John Evelyn that he has been in Scott's shop. An unwise association with Adiel Mill of Amen Corner, whom many considered to be a speculator, led to a substantial loss for Scott, who tried with several other of Mill's creditors to recoup some assets by selling off Mill's stock of books in 1691.<br>
<br>Scott was the London agent of the Oxford University Press, for whom he published William Beveridge's <span class="italic">Pandects</span>, and of the Bodleian Library, selling them the manuscripts that had belonged to Lord Christopher Hatton, which Scott had bought after Hatton's death in 1670. He was an active and leading member of the Stationers' Company. He was elected to its governing body in June 1681 and, over the remainder of his career, fined for all the offices, including that of master of the company in 1691, when reference was made to his considerable deafness. No publications carry his name after 1706 and his last attendance at a company meeting was in November 1708; he may have retired to the country. He was buried on 13 January 1710 in the parish of St Botolph, Aldersgate. His will, made on 4 February 1708 and proved on 17 January 1710, appointed as executors his eldest sons, Charles and Robert, and his daughter, Ann, who were to benefit equally from his estate; he also requested only a modest funeral.<br>
