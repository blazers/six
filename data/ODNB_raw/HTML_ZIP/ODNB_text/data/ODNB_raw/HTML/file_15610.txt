<span class="headword">Kinghorn,  Joseph</span>  (1766&#150;1832), <span class="occ">Particular Baptist minister</span>, was born at Gateshead on 17 January 1766. His father, David Kinghorn (1737&#150;1822), was a shoemaker and Baptist preacher at Newcastle upon Tyne; he was ordained on 1 May 1771 as minister of a Baptist congregation at Bishop Burton in the East Riding of Yorkshire, serving until July 1799, when he retired to Norwich. Joseph was the eldest son of David and his second wife, Elizabeth (1737/8&#150;1810), second daughter of Joseph Jopling of Satley. After four years' classical schooling, Kinghorn was taken on trial as an apprentice to a watch- and clockmaker in Hull in 1779, but in March 1781 became a clerk in Richard Fishwick's white-lead works at Elswick, Northumberland. In April 1783 he was baptized by his father at Bishop Burton and looked forward to entering the ministry. He made the acquaintance of Robert Hall (1764&#150;1831) and had thoughts of joining him at the University of Aberdeen, but on 20 August 1784 he entered the Bristol Baptist college, under Caleb Evans. Among his fellow students his most intimate friend was James Hinton, father of John Howard Hinton. On leaving the college he ministered for several months (from May 1788) at Fairford, where some found his Calvinism not high enough: he was always in favour of a robust call to the unconverted to turn to God. His former employer, Richard Fishwick, introduced his name to the Baptist congregation at St Mary's Chapel, Norwich, located in the parish of St Mary-in-Coslany. On 27 March 1789 he settled in Norwich, and he was ordained on 20 May 1790. One of his closest friends there was William Wilkin of Costessy, a farmer and miller of both fortune and culture. Wilkin died in 1799 leaving his eight-year old son, Simon, to the care of the bachelor Kinghorn, who soon began a school for his ward and other pupils.<br>
<br>Kinghorn's ministry at Norwich, which lasted until his death, was unusually distinguished. He was famed for his pulpit rhetoric, which was at once scriptural, systematic, and practical; his power of apt illustration was noted by Edward Irving. In 1804 he was invited to preside over the new Horton College, about to be established in Bradford, and six years later was invited to take a similar position at the new college established by the London Particular Baptists at Stepney. Kinghorn had an extremely high view of his local pastorate and therefore refused to move from Norwich, though he did prepare in his own home a number of candidates for ministerial training for work both in Britain and overseas. His old chapel was replaced in 1811 by a very handsome structure on the same site.<br>
<br>Like many dissenters Kinghorn welcomed the French Revolution, and the fall of the Bastille in particular, but he was not a political preacher, though he was active in seeking the removal of dissenting disabilities. He also worked for the opening up of British India to dissenting missionaries through the revision of the East India Company charter in 1813, by persuading Bishop Bathurst of Norwich to present the case in the Lords and William Smith (MP for Norwich and a Unitarian associate of the Clapham Sect) to present it in the Commons. In the communion controversy which much occupied Baptists in the years following the end of the French wars, Kinghorn, after some initial hesitation, became the chief spokesman of the closed-communion position, against the open-communion position of his friend, Robert Hall. Kinghorn believed that baptism as a believer was clearly required by the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> as a prerequisite for participation in holy communion, and that unless this position were protected, Baptist insights into the restriction of baptism to believers would be lost. Kinghorn served on the committee of the infant Baptist Missionary Society and journeyed to Scotland in 1818 and 1822 on its behalf. In every enterprise connected with the Baptist denomination he played a prominent part, and has been called &#145;the de facto Bishop of the Baptists in Norfolk&#146;  (Jewson, 73).<br>
<br>Norwich at this time enjoyed a lively intellectual life. From 1790 Kinghorn was a member of the Speculative Society, of which William Taylor, the German scholar, was the leading spirit; the society welcomed cultured Roman Catholics to its discussions, alongside representatives of all protestant churches. Kinghorn gave considerable time to linguistic and critical studies, not only mastering Greek, Hebrew, and Syriac, but also becoming an authority on rabbinical writings. He was much involved in the work of the London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews. In 1828 he was awarded the honorary degree of MA by Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, but never advertised the honour.<br>
<br>Kinghorn died, unmarried, on 1 September 1832, and was buried on 7 September in the vestibule of St Mary's Chapel. Joseph John Gurney, the Quaker philanthropist, spoke at his funeral; the sermon was preached by John Alexander, minister of Prince's Street Congregational Church.<br>
<br>A list of twenty of Kinghorn's publications is given in Wilkin's biography; they include controversial works on the nature of the church, Christian baptism, the terms of communion, and the training of Christian ministers, as well as treatises in opposition to the beliefs of Unitarians and Roman Catholics. He wrote on Christian worship and edited several collections of hymns. A number of his sermons were published, and he was a frequent contributor to the <span class="italic">Baptist Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">Eclectic Review</span>, and the <span class="italic">Evangelical Magazine</span>. Wilkin also enumerates twelve of his unpublished manuscripts, chiefly controversial. The catalogue of his extensive library was published at Norwich in 1833.<br>
