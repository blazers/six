<div class="para">
<span class="headword">King,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1621), <span class="occ">bishop of London</span>, was one of twelve children of Philip King (<i>d</i>. 1592) and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Edmund Conquest. According to Thomas Fuller his birth took place in the ancestral home at Worminghall, Buckinghamshire, in the same chamber as his father had been born. A brass erected in Worminghall church by Elizabeth King records that her husband was educated at the expense of his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15592/', "Robert King (d. 1557)")</script>, abbot of Oseney and Thame and first bishop of Oxford, and of his kinsman John Williams, Lord Williams of Thame (<i>c</i>.1500&#150;1559). John King was sent to Westminster School, whence in 1577 he was elected a student of Christ Church, Oxford. He graduated BA on 26 January 1580, at which time he was presented to the London parish of St Anne and St Agnes, and to a prebend at Windsor. He proceeded MA on 15 February 1583.<br>
<br>King served as domestic chaplain to John Piers, a former dean of Christ Church and now bishop of Salisbury, and followed his household north upon his translation to York in 1588. In that year King became preacher to the city of York. Piers preferred him to the archdeaconry of Nottingham in 1590 and on 2 July 1591 he proceeded BD. King established a reputation as a powerful evangelical preacher, and delivered Piers's funeral sermon at York on 17 November 1594 (printed in 1597). Probably during his time in York, King married Joan, daughter of Henry Freeman of Staffordshire; their eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15564/', "Henry King (1592&#150;1669)")</script>, was born at Worminghall in January 1592, and their second, <a href="#cosubject_15570">John King [<i>see below</i>]</a> at York in 1595.<br>
<br>Shortly afterwards King joined the household of the newly appointed lord keeper Thomas Egerton, a noted patron of evangelical clergy, as his domestic chaplain. Another appointee in Egerton's household was John Donne, who was to remain intimate with the King family. In May 1597 King was instituted rector of St Andrew's, Holborn, London, and in October 1599 prebend of Sneating in St Paul's, both by royal prerogative following the consecrations of Richard Bancroft to London and William Cotton to Exeter respectively. From these pulpits King established himself as one of London's foremost preachers, noted for Calvinist orthodoxy, moral rectitude, and strident anti-Catholicism. In December 1601 he was created DD at Oxford. It has often been stated that King was a chaplain to Elizabeth but at the accession of James in 1603 Archbishop John Whitgift listed him among nineteen prominent preachers who were &#145;no chapleins&#146; yet &#145;fitt to preach&#146; before the new sovereign  (Westminster Abbey muniment book 15, fol. 6). King's eminence and reliability in the pulpit received official endorsement when Whitgift appointed him to deliver the first Sunday sermon at court after Elizabeth's death, and it would seem that Whitgift's faith in him was not misplaced. King's discourse evidently made a deep impression on John Manningham, who transcribed his notes from the sermon at unprecedented length. Deftly but forcefully addressing concerns about Roman Catholic agitation at the succession, King warned against &#145;intestine discord&#146;, eulogizing Elizabeth, and welcoming James as a new Solomon  (<span class="italic">Diary of John Manningham</span>, 211&#150;17).<br>
<br>Upon his arrival in London, James made King one of his chaplains in ordinary. He was to remain one of the most popular court preachers of the reign, praised by James in one of his predictable puns as &#145;the king of preachers&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.295). He was also held in particular regard by Queen Anne. With the enthusiastic endorsement by petition of thirty-two students (that is, fellows) of the college, James appointed King dean of Christ Church in August 1605. Thus King became the latest of the college's unbroken succession of evangelical Calvinist heads, who had dominated theology and churchmanship in Oxford since the beginning of Elizabeth's reign. He served as vice-chancellor of Oxford University from 1607 until 1610.<br>
<br>In September 1605 King was one of four chaplains selected by James to instruct leaders of Scottish presbyterianism in sermons at Hampton Court (an appointment which led to the later assumption that he was chosen to preach at the Hampton Court Conference in 1604, which King did not in fact attend). King's contribution, printed by royal command, asserted the royal prerogative over ecclesiastical causes, as well as episcopacy instituted by divine right. Although he accepted the possibility of other forms of church government as legitimate abroad, he held presbyterianism to be inherently anti-monarchical and therefore illegitimate in the kingdoms of England and Scotland. The sermon's prime target, James Melvill, called the performance &#145;a most violent invective againes the Presbyteries&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 667).<br>
<br>In December 1610 King was collated to the prebend of Milton Manor in Lincoln Cathedral but he resigned this and all his other preferments after his consecration at Lambeth as bishop of London on 8 September 1611. Fuller praised him as &#145;full fraught with episcopal qualities&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 1.138). Like his friend and most recent patron, George Abbot&#151;his predecessor in London and now promoted archbishop of Canterbury&#151;King exemplified the evangelical Calvinistic model of the preaching chief pastor, in contrast to the disciplinarian and ceremonialist style emerging among proto-Arminians such as Lancelot Andrewes and Richard Neile. Distinctive was King's commitment to continuing to preach himself, and not only in &eacute;lite pulpits such as the court and Paul's Cross; King took pride in preaching a parochial sermon somewhere in his diocese every Sunday during his episcopate. He also assiduously appointed like-minded men to livings in his diocese, and the huge number of dedications to him of sermons printed by aspiring young evangelicals attests to his position as an evangelical patron, perhaps second only to Abbot. King and Abbot, sometimes with the dean of the Chapel Royal, James Montagu, formed the nexus of evangelical interests at court, as they also did on the court of high commission. King's visitation articles (in 1612 and 1615) show similar evangelical priorities in their insistence on catechizing, and their comparative lack of concern for strict ceremonial conformity. In 1613 King and Abbot were joint dedicatees of the fourth edition of Andrew Willet's seminal statement of English Calvinistic church polity, <span class="italic">Synopsis papismi</span>, where both were praised for standing firm against the encroachment of the &#145;semi-popish errors&#146; encouraged by Richard Hooker's anti-puritanism  (Milton, 22). King figured prominently in the protestant triumphalism surrounding the marriage of Princess Elizabeth to the elector palatine on 14 February 1613. On the Tuesday after the wedding, King preached at court on a text chosen by James I (&#145;Thy wife shall be as the fruitfull vine&#146;  (<span class="roman">Psalm 28</span>: 3), a sermon notable not only for King's trademark anti-Catholicism, but also for its celebration of women and the equality between partners in marriage. This may inform an understanding of the bishop's own conjugal and domestic happiness, remarked upon by Donne and others. Describing his participation in a sociable family dinner that year in their house at St Paul's, Donne referred jocularly to the couple as &#145;the King&#146; and &#145;the Queen&#146;  (Bald, 282). Later in 1613 King and Abbot led the godly opposition on the commission hearing the divorce suit brought against the earl of Essex by his countess, Frances Howard.<br>
<br>In his last years as bishop King presided over a campaign for the restoration of St Paul's Cathedral, marked by James's only visit there on 26 March 1620 to hear King preach from Paul's Cross. Also in 1620 King presided at the festival consecration of the earl of Bridgewater's private chapel at Bridgewater House in the Barbican. King's appeal for the cathedral epitomizes the lesser-known fact that concern for the maintenance and beautification of church fabrics throughout his diocese was a particular achievement of his episcopate. Upon his elevation to the see, King commissioned Anthony Munday to compile a parish-by-parish survey of church refurbishments in the City of London; although Munday did not complete his task until the 1630s, King received the dedication of Munday's 1618 edition of his expansion of Stow's <span class="italic">Survey of London</span>.<br>
<br>King's health failed within a year of James's visit to St Paul's. Suffering from gall and bladder stones, on 4 March 1621 he wrote his will &#145;weake in body and full of payne&#146;, and six days later John Chamberlain reported that his family hoped only &#145;to kepe him alive &hellip; till our Lady day [25 March] be past, for the goode of his children&#146; (who would benefit from the episcopal revenues due then), after which time he would consent to surgical removal of the stones  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 2.352). He died on 30 March 1621. King's will directed that he be buried &#145;in the Cathedrall church of St Paule without any pompe or solempnities onlie with a Tombestone with this Inscription (<i>Resurgam</i>)&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/137, fols. 285<i>r</i>&#150;286<i>r</i>). Accordingly the day after his death &#145;at night he was buried privatly in Paules&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 2.360). Fuller transcribes the fine elegy on the humility of King and the modesty of his burial that was inscribed on a brass plaque placed on the wall adjacent to the tomb. King was survived by his wife, five sons&#151;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15564/', "Henry King")</script>, John, Philip, William, and Robert&#151;and four unmarried daughters, Elizabeth, Mary, Dorothy, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68071/', "Anne King")</script>. All received significant cash bequests from an estate Chamberlain estimated at more than &pound;12,000 in value. Dorothy and Anne were bequeathed King's gifts of plate from Queen Anne; Henry was given the first choice of forty books from his father's library, with the remainder to be divided between the younger sons. King appointed as overseers Archbishop Abbot and Sir Henry Martin, chancellor of London diocese. False rumours of a deathbed conversion to Roman Catholicism by King were fully exploited by Catholic presses at home and abroad; these claims were sharply refuted by his eldest son, Henry, residentiary canon of St Paul's, in a sermon at Paul's Cross on 25 November, printed immediately.<br>
<br>King's second son, <a name="cosubject_15570"></a><span class="headword">John King</span>  (1595&#150;1639), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in York and educated with his elder brother Henry at Westminster School, London. He matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 20 January 1609, aged fourteen, and graduated BA on 19 June 1611; he proceeded MA on 7 July 1614, and published poems in the university collections of 1613 and 1619. He became a prebendary of St Paul's in 1616. Rector of Remenham, Berkshire, and (for three years) public orator to Oxford University from 1622, he became a canon of Christ Church in 1624 and proceeded BD and DD on 19 May 1625. That year he became a canon of Windsor and published a sermon preached at Oxford. He died on 3 January 1639 and was buried in Christ Church Cathedral.<br>
