<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Arnaud,  Yvonne Germaine Jeanne</span>  (1890&#150;1958), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 20 December 1890 in Bordeaux, France, the daughter of F&eacute;lix L&eacute;on Paul Arnaud, a colonel in the French army, and his wife, Antoinette de Mont&eacute;gu. Educated in Paris she won a first prize for piano playing at the Paris Conservatoire at the age of twelve. After training as a classical pianist, she toured in Europe and the United States as a child prodigy. Her first stage appearance was somewhat accidental. During a lull in her concert engagements in Britain in 1911 she went to see a musical comedy. Deciding on a career on the theatrical stage, though with no formal training, she made her d&eacute;but the same year as Princess Mathilde in J. T. Tanner's <span class="italic">The Quaker Girl</span> (with music by Lionel Monckton) at the Adelphi.<br>
<br>Arnaud scored a big success the following year as Suzanne in <span class="italic">The Girl in the Taxi</span> at the Lyric, a role she reprised in numerous revivals. With her natural charm and high spirits and a &#145;musical broken English-French accent&#146;, which she herself felt was something of a croak, she quickly became a firm favourite, and more successes followed as she turned her hand to anything from Shakespeare to farce. She appeared as Noisette in <span class="italic">Oh, be Careful!</span> and Phrynette in the French mime play <span class="italic">L'enfant prodigue</span>, both in 1915; as Kitty Pearson in <span class="italic">Jerry</span> (1916); as Georgette St Pol in <span class="italic">Kissing Time</span> by Guy Bolton and P. G. Wodehouse (1919); and as Chiquette in J. Hastings Turner's <span class="italic">The Naughty Princess</span> (1920). On 28 October 1920 Arnaud married Hugh McLellan (<i>b</i>. 1895/6), author and later farmer, the son of playwright C. M. S. McLellan; they had no children.<br>
<br>Arnaud's portrayal of Mrs Pepys in James B. Fagan's <span class="italic">And So to Bed</span> (1926) (which she also played in New York) received much favourable comment, as did her Elizabeth in Harry Graham's <span class="italic">By Candle Light</span> (1928). Successes as Louise Allington in Will Evans's <span class="italic">Tons of Money</span> (1922), Marguerite Hickett in Ben Travers's <span class="italic">A Cuckoo in the Nest</span> (1925), Elma Melton in Frederick Lonsdale's <span class="italic">Canaries Sometimes Sing</span> (1929) (again played in New York), and the Duchess of Tann in James B. Fagan's <span class="italic">The Improper Duchess</span> (1931), were repeated in the film versions of these of 1931, 1933, 1930, and 1936 respectively. Other roles included Louise in <span class="italic">Will you Love me Always?</span> (1932), Helene Lorimer in <span class="italic">Doctor's Orders</span> (1933), Princess Katharine in <span class="italic">Henry V</span> (1934), and Mrs Val Shannon in Peter Traill's comedy <span class="italic">Tread Softly</span> (1935).<br>
<br>Arnaud made her first films in 1920 (<span class="italic">Desire</span> and <span class="italic">The Temptress</span>) but then no more until 1930. She appeared occasionally thereafter through the 1930s and 1940s. She was seen in <span class="italic">On Approval</span> (1930), <span class="italic">Widow's Might</span> and <span class="italic">Princess Charming</span> (1934), <span class="italic">Lady in Danger</span> (1935), <span class="italic">Stormy Weather</span> and <span class="italic">The Gay Adventure</span> (1936), <span class="italic">Neutral Port</span> (1940), <span class="italic">Tomorrow we Live</span> (1942), and <span class="italic">Woman to Woman</span> and <span class="italic">The Ghosts of Berkeley Square</span> (1947). Her last film appearance was as the maid, Georgette, in Jacques Tati's <span class="italic">Mon oncle</span> (1958).<br>
<br>Yet Arnaud remained first and foremost a West End stage actress and she also played during the 1930s in <span class="italic">Plan for a Hostess</span> (1938), and <span class="italic">What Say They?</span> (1939). In the following two decades she had roles in <span class="italic">In Good King Charles's Golden Days</span> (1940), which she had also played at the Malvern Festival the previous year, in S. N. Behrman's <span class="italic">Jane</span> (1947), and also in <span class="italic">Mrs Willie</span> (1955), <span class="italic">Six Months' Grace</span> (1957), and <span class="italic">The Big Tickle</span>, her last role, which opened in May 1958. Roles of particular note were in Margery Sharp's <span class="italic">The Nutmeg Tree</span> (1941); as Mrs Frail in William Congreve's <span class="italic">Love for Love</span> (1943); as Lady Catherine &#145;Kitty&#146; Champion-Cheney in W. Somerset Maugham's <span class="italic">The Circle</span> (1944); in Arthur Macrae's <span class="italic">Traveller's Joy</span> (1948); and as Denise in Alan Melville's <span class="italic">Dear Charles</span> (1952). A rare failure was as Madame Alexandra in Jean Anouilh's <span class="italic">Colombe</span> (1951), &#145;where her essential kindliness and good nature was ill-suited to the cruelty and egotism of Anouilh's ageing actress&#146;  (<span class="italic">Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre</span>, 22). She also broadcast in the early days of radio, later in both classical and straight plays, and went on to become a favourite on both radio and television panel games. Arnaud was always an actress whose abundant charm was impossible to resist, yet she was &#145;much more than a delightful creature with whom every playgoer fell in love: she was the wittiest of actresses, too&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 22 Sept 1958).<br>
<br>Arnaud died at the National Hospital, Queen Square, Holborn, on 20 September 1958, never recovering from a cerebral haemorrhage for which she had undergone an operation on 2 August. She and her husband, who survived her, had long lived in Effingham Common, Surrey. In 1965, two years after construction began, the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, on its island site on the River Wey in nearby Guildford, opened as a memorial.<br>
