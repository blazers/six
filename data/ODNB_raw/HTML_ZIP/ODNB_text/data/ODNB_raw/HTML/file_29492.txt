<span class="headword">Williams, Sir  David</span>  (1550&#150;1613), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on St David's day (1 March) 1550. He is described on his tomb, by his own request, as &#145;Natus ex progenie Adam [Howell Ychan] et Oweni Gethin&#146;, which was doubtless an attempt to gloss over his more humble immediate origins as a younger son of Gwilym ap John Vaughan, yeoman, of Blaen Newydd, Ystradfellte, Brecknockshire, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Rhys Griffith Melyn. He preferred to tell friends that he was &#145;of the same house as the lord Williams of Thame&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liber famelicus</span>, 30). He was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1568, and called to the bar in 1576, after which he seems to have practised chiefly in south Wales, where he acquired the priory of St John in Brecon and, in 1600, a house at Gwernyfed near Hay-on-Wye. Williams became a justice of the peace for Brecknockshire about 1577, and from 1581 until 1604 he was both recorder of Brecon and attorney-general for south Wales in the great sessions. He represented the Brecon boroughs in four parliaments from 1584 to 1598. In 1589 the earl of Pembroke put forward his name as not unworthy to be a lawyer member of the council in the marches, though in fact he was never added to the council.<br>
<br>Williams became a bencher of the Middle Temple in 1590, and in Lent 1591 delivered a reading on the <span class="roman">Statutes of Wills</span>, a version of which survives. A mere three years later, in Easter term 1594, he was made a serjeant-at-law, the patrons at his creation being the earls of Warwick and Worcester and Lord Howard of Effingham. His principal real patron is thought to have been Lord Burghley, but he had been chosen by a more senior serjeant. Williams was the junior of the call, and as serjeant-elect he delivered a double reading in the Middle Temple, this time on the jointure provisions of the <span class="roman">Statute of Uses</span>. He was thereafter active as counsel in Westminster Hall, and was soon under consideration for the bench. Burghley considered him for a vacancy in the exchequer in 1598, despite his &#145;small living&#146;, and in 1599 Sir Robert Cecil proposed his appointment to the common pleas. The preferments were opposed by Dean Goodman of Westminster, who needed Williams's continued services as counsel.<br>
<br>Williams was knighted on 23 July 1603, and on 4 February 1604 was appointed a fifth or additional puisne justice of the king's bench. In 1610 he was removed from the Oxford circuit for covertly opposing the council in the marches, and for allowing recusants to swear a modified oath of allegiance. At the following Cambridge assizes he ruled that &#145;it was not meet to keep poor prisoners in the gaol for small matters or felonies from one assizes to another&#146;, and instructed the magistrates to try petty larceny and &#145;small felonies&#146; at the quarter sessions  (Dalton, 39). He did not live quite long enough to serve under the chief justiceship of Coke, whose policies (according to Archbishop Abbott in 1612) he utterly disliked, but died of a fever on 22 January 1613 at Kingston House, Kingston Bagpuize, Berkshire. His entrails were buried at Kingston, but in accordance with his will his body was removed to St John's Chapel (now the cathedral), Brecon, which was part of the priory that he owned. His effigy in judge's robes, alongside that of his first wife Margaret, still remains at Brecon, once part of an elaborate canopied monument which has been destroyed. The present Latin inscription is an incomplete modern copy of that prescribed in his last will.<br>
<br>Margaret, to whom Williams was married by 1586, was one of the daughters of John Games of Aberbr&acirc;n, Brecknockshire. They had nine sons and two daughters, but only four of the sons survived. Williams was survived by his second wife, Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1629), daughter and coheir of Oliver Wellesbourne of East Hanney, Berkshire, and widow of John Latton of Kingston Bagpuize, whom he married in 1597. She brought him estates in Berkshire and Oxfordshire, including Kingston House, where he died, which was said to have been the home of Empress Matilda. He also had a house called Ham Court in Oxfordshire, leased from the earl of Shrewsbury. There were two children by this marriage. Williams died &#145;a man of great living and personall wealthe&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liber famelicus</span>, 30). His extensive Welsh estates were inherited by his eldest son, Sir Henry Williams MP (<i>d</i>. 1636), father of the first baronet. He left a number of charitable bequests, including poor relief and endowed sermons in Glasbury, St John's, Ystradfellte, and Aberllynfi churches. Among his legacies was &#145;a greate guylte standinge cupp with a cover&#146; left to Lord Chancellor Ellesmere in token of his love and affection, &pound;20 to the society of Serjeants' Inn, Fleet Street, and eight gilt cups to the vicars-choral of Hereford. The hangings from Kingston, and a third of his plate, were left to his son Thomas as heirlooms to the house of Cockthorpe, Oxfordshire. His best robes were left to Mr Justice Warburton, whom he called &#145;a good and kynde brother&#146; (judge), under a mutual agreement &#145;that the survivor of us twayne shoulde have the others best scarlet robes&#146;.<br>
