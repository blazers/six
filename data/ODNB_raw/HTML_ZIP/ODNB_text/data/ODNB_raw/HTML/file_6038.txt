<span class="headword">Compton <span class="st"> [ Compton Carleton]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (1592&#150;1666), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born in Cambridgeshire, the son of Richard Compton and Anne Fludd. The Comptons were a well-to-do Catholic family and the name Compton (or Compton Carleton) figures prominently in lists of early seventeenth-century Jesuits. Like some of his brothers Thomas Compton went to the continent in order to become a priest; he stayed at the English Jesuit college at St Omer from 1606 until 1611. Together with his brother Henry he subsequently moved to the English College at Madrid. In June 1614 all the English students were transferred to Valladolid in order to continue their studies at the College of St Alban. After three years at Valladolid, Thomas Compton was ordained priest. He was received into the Society of Jesus at Li&egrave;ge in September 1617. The two years of his noviciate at Li&egrave;ge were followed by further studies in France, which prepared him for a teaching career at the Jesuit colleges of St Omer and Li&egrave;ge. During the years 1622&#150;6 he taught a number of basic subjects, such as grammar, syntax, poetry, and rhetoric, at St Omer. On 21 May 1628 he completed his training as a Jesuit by being professed of the four vows at Li&egrave;ge, where he became professor of philosophy and theology and prefect of studies. Apart from a short stay at St Omer in 1631 he remained at Li&egrave;ge for the rest of his life. The contradictory information in Foley about the date of his ordination and his whereabouts in 1625 must be due to his being confused with another member of the Compton Carleton family  (Foley, 7.154).<br>
<br>In his entry on Compton, Southwell praises him for his great gifts as a teacher. These gifts are discernible in the handbooks on philosophy and theology that he published. <span class="italic">Philosophia universa</span> (Antwerp, 1649) is a well-organized treatment of the main branches of philosophy; <span class="italic">Prometheus Christianus</span> (Antwerp, 1652) surveys the field of moral philosophy on the basis of nineteen &#145;disputationes&#146; and contains an address to Compton's pupils at Li&egrave;ge; and <span class="italic">Cursus Theologici tomus prior/tomus posterior</span> (Li&egrave;ge, 1659&#150;64) is a monumental two-volume theological handbook of more than 1000 pages. The many subsequent editions of his works and two posthumous publications dealing with Aristotelian philosophy testify to his reputation. He died at Li&egrave;ge on 24 March 1666.<br>
