<span class="headword">Edwards,  Hilton Robert Hugh</span>  (1903&#150;1982), <span class="occ">actor and theatre director</span>, was born on 2 February 1903 at 1 Bathurst Mansions, 460 Holloway Road, London, the only child of Thomas George Cecil Edwards (<i>d</i>. 1910), a district magistrate in India, and his second wife, Emily Murphy (<i>d</i>. 1926), a woman of Irish descent. He lost his father at the age of seven when the unfortunate man died as a result of a pig-sticking incident in India. Young Bobby Edwards, as he was then called, was educated at East Finchley grammar school, Middlesex and, briefly, at St Aloysius College, Highgate, Middlesex, a college for Roman Catholic boys.<br>
<br>After a brief spell in the machine-gun corps and on army reserve, Hilton Edwards began his acting career in 1921 when he was employed as assistant stage manager and walk-on actor with Charles Doran, a Shakespearian actor&#150;manager. From this he progressed in 1922 to the Old Vic Theatre in London, where he remained for three years, acting and singing in a number of increasingly important Shakespearian roles. The turning point in Edwards's life came in June 1927 when he was engaged by Anew MacMaster for his Intimate Theatre Company tour of Ireland. MacMaster's travelling company presented Shakespeare in the small towns of Ireland and included in the company was MacMaster's brother-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55445/', "Miche&#225;l MacLiamm&#243;ir (born Alfred Lee Willmore) (1899&#150;1978)")</script>.<br>
<br>Edwards and MacLiamm&oacute;ir immediately became lovers and this was the beginning of a lifelong partnership. Drawn together by a shared enthusiasm for modern theatre, they made plans during the summer of 1927 to move to Dublin and to set up a permanent company, directing and designing works of contemporary drama. The handsome and flamboyant MacLiamm&oacute;ir, a former child actor and self-invented Irishman, was the perfect partner and foil for the pragmatic and determined Edwards. Edwards's abilities as a director and actor were perfectly complemented by MacLiamm&oacute;ir's flair for acting, writing, and design. This enduring relationship as Ireland's most visible and much-loved gay couple was one of the most remarkable features of their career.<br>
<br>This career began on 14 October 1928 with the first Gate Theatre Studio production at the Peacock Theatre, next to W. B. Yeats's Abbey Theatre in Dublin. They presented the Irish premi&egrave;re of Ibsen's <span class="italic">Peer Gynt</span>, with Edwards directing and also taking the title role, and with MacLiamm&oacute;ir as designer. They followed up the success of this first play by producing Wilde's <span class="italic">Salome</span>, another premi&egrave;re for Irish theatre. Edwards's skill as a director was confirmed by his championship of a rejected Abbey play, Denis Johnston's <span class="italic">The Old Lady Says &#145;No&#146;!</span>, which opened in June 1929. Johnston's masterpiece was the Gate Theatre Studio's greatest artistic and commercial success at this point, allowing them to find a permanent theatre in the Rotunda Assembly Rooms, an eighteenth-century hall at the north end of Dublin's O'Connell Street.<br>
<br>Edwards and MacLiamm&oacute;ir lived at 4 Harcourt Terrace in the centre of Georgian Dublin and this remained their permanent base for the rest of their lives. Over the next forty years Edwards acted and directed at the Gate Theatre. One of his most important discoveries as a director was the sixteen-year-old Orson Welles, on a visit to Dublin in 1931 as part of a European vacation and already eager to act. Edwards cast Welles in a series of plays during the Gate Theatre's winter season of 1931&#150;2 and this began a lifelong association between Welles and the Dublin Gate Theatre. In his film version of <span class="italic">Othello</span> (1950) Welles cast Edwards as Rodrigo and MacLiamm&oacute;ir as Iago, the novelty of film acting for Edwards being only somewhat marred by scant payment of salary. To compensate, Welles agreed to narrate a short film, <span class="italic">Return to Glenascaul</span>, directed by Edwards and released in 1950. Edwards's other important excursion into cinema came in 1961 when he appeared in <span class="italic">Victim</span>, a ground-breaking film about homosexuality directed by Basil Dearden and starring Dirk Bogarde and Sylvia Syms. In 1958 Edwards published <span class="italic">The Mantle of Harlequin</span>, an entertaining but autobiographically uninformative account of his life and his work in the theatre.<br>
<br>Perhaps the greatest artistic achievement for Hilton Edwards came in 1960 with <span class="italic">The Importance of being Oscar</span>, a one-man show on the life and the writings of Oscar Wilde, devised and directed by Edwards and performed by MacLiamm&oacute;ir. This show, described by Bernard Levin as &#145;a beautiful flower on his [Wilde's] grave&#146;  (Fitz-Simon, 232), was a crucial text in rehabilitating Oscar Wilde for a general theatre audience. Such was its popularity that it toured in Ireland, Britain, America, South Africa, and Latin America, and was eventually televised. Edwards's talents as a director found a new medium in 1961 when he was appointed head of drama at the new Irish television station, Radio Telefis &Eacute;ireann. In 1973, as a mark of affection from their adopted city, Edwards and MacLiamm&oacute;ir were made freemen of Dublin, and when MacLiamm&oacute;ir died in 1978 the president of Ireland attended the funeral and paid his respects to Edwards as acknowledged life partner and chief mourner. Edwards died of diverticulitis at the Royal City of Dublin Hospital on 18 November 1982 and was buried by MacLiamm&oacute;ir's side, in St Fintan's cemetery, Howth, Dublin, on 22 November. After their deaths the Gate Theatre continued to flourish as a living presence in Dublin's artistic life.<br>
