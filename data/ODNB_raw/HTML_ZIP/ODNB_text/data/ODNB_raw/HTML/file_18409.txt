<span class="headword">Maxwell, Sir  William Edward</span>  (1846&#150;1897), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born on 5 August 1846, the younger son of <a name="cosubject_18409"></a><span class="headword">Sir Peter Benson Maxwell</span>  (1817&#150;1893), <span class="occ">colonial official</span>, who became chief justice of the Straits Settlements, and his wife, Frances Dorothea, the only daughter of Francis Synge of Glanmore Castle, co. Wicklow. His father, who was the fourth son of Peter Benson Maxwell of Birdstown, co. Donegal, was born in January 1817 and educated at Paris and at Trinity College, Dublin (BA 1839). He entered the Inner Temple in 1838, moved to the Middle Temple two years later, and was called to the bar on 19 November 1841. In 1855 Peter Maxwell published <span class="italic">Whom Shall We Hang? The Sebastopol Enquiry</span>, and the following year he was knighted. He was recorder of Penang (1856&#150;66) and of Singapore (1866&#150;71), and chief justice of the Straits Settlements from 1867 to 1871. In 1883&#150;4 he reorganized the judicial tribunals of Egypt. He published two legal works of some importance, <span class="italic">An introduction to the duties of police in the settlement of Prince of Wales Island, Singapore and Malacca</span> (1866) and <span class="italic">On the Interpretation of Statutes</span> (1875). He died in France, at Grasse, Alpes-Maritimes, on 14 January 1893.<br>
<br>William Edward Maxwell was educated at Repton School (1860&#150;64) and was employed from 1865 to 1869 in the supreme court at Penang and Singapore. In 1867 he qualified as an advocate at the local bar, and in September 1869 he was appointed a police magistrate and commissioner of the court of requests at Penang. In 1870 he married Lillias Grant Aberigh-Mackay (1846&#150;1925), the daughter of James Aberigh-Mackay, a chaplain in the Indian service. In February of that year he was placed in the same offices in Malacca, in August 1871 at Singapore, and in 1872 in Province Wellesley. In May 1874 he was nominated a temporary judge of the supreme court of Penang, and in September he was appointed assistant government agent for Province Wellesley. In November 1875 he accompanied, as deputy commissioner, the Larut field force in their retributive expedition against the murderers of James Wheeler Woodford Birch, the British resident at Perak. He was mentioned in dispatches and received a medal. Maxwell became assistant resident in Perak and a member of the state council in February 1878. In 1881 he was called to the bar by the Inner Temple, and in the following year he was commissioned to visit the Australian colonies and report on the Torrens land registration system, which resulted in <span class="italic">The Torrens System of Conveyancing by Registration of Title in the Straits Settlement</span> (1883).<br>
<br>On returning to the Straits Settlements Maxwell became commissioner of land titles, and in 1883 was gazetted a member of the executive and legislative councils. The following year he was employed by the Foreign Office on a successful mission to the west coast of Atchin to obtain the release of the survivors of the British ship <i>Nisero</i>, who had been in captivity for ten months; for this he was created CMG. From 1884 to 1889 he was acting resident counsellor at Penang, and in 1889 became British resident at Selangor. In 1892 he was nominated colonial secretary of the Straits Settlements, and from September 1893 to January 1895 he was acting governor.<br>
<br>In March 1895 Maxwell was nominated governor of the Gold Coast. He found the colony on the brink of a war with the Asante, who made frequent slave raids, and refused to pay the balance of the war indemnity due to the British government. On 17 January 1896 an expedition under Sir Francis Scott entered Kumasi without resistance, and made prisoner the Asante king, Prempeh. Maxwell, who was nominated KCMG in 1896, visited England in the summer, and addressed large meetings at Liverpool and Manchester on the future of the Gold Coast and the Asante kingdom. He returned to the Gold Coast in October, but contracted blackwater fever. Before he could reach England he died and was buried at sea on 14 December 1897, off Gran Canaria. He was survived by his wife, with whom he had six sons, the eldest being <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94841/', "(William) George Maxwell")</script>, who became an administrator in the Malay states.<br>
