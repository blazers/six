<span class="headword">Sheppard,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1641&#150;1660), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, makes his first appearance in historical records in February 1641, when &#145;Mr. Sheppard a Picture maker by Cree church [St Katharine Cree]&#146; paid his admittance fee to the London Company of Painter&#150;Stainers  (Guildhall Library, MS 5667/1, fol. 157). It is also during this decade that Sheppard acquired his only recorded apprentice, Francis Barlow, who on arrival from Lincolnshire was &#145;put prentice to one Shepherd, a Face-Painter, with whom he lived but a few years because his Fancy did not lie that way&#146;  (Vertue, 2.135).<br>
<br>During the Commonwealth years Sheppard may have allied himself with the exiled royalists; he is referred to in the notebooks of Richard Symonds, the royalist diarist and antiquary, during the latter's stay in Rome from 1649 to 1651. Sheppard, then in Rome, informed Symonds of the price paid in London for <i>azzuro</i> (ultramarine). In Venice in 1650 Sheppard painted the portrait of the royalist Thomas Killigrew, who had been appointed Charles II's resident to the Venetian republic. This image, which is both a portrait of Killigrew and a mourning picture for Charles I, is the only painting by Sheppard known to survive; there are various versions, of which the principal belongs to the National Portrait Gallery, London. It was engraved by William Faithorne.<br>
<br>In 1651 &#145;William Sheppard, an English limner&#146; sailed from Italy to Constantinople. He was shipwrecked near Samos and was taken to Rhodes, where he was &#145;kept in restraint&#146;, and his wife in London had to solicit the Levant Company to obtain his release  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, 50). Sheppard was back in London by the Restoration. Despite the lack of evidence, it seems that he enjoyed a good practice as in 1658 William Sanderson included him in his list of &#145;English modern masters&#146;: &#145;In the <i>Life</i>, <i>Walker</i>, <i>Zowst</i>, <i>Wright</i>, <i>Lillie</i>, <i>Hales</i>, <i>Shepheard</i>, <i>de Grange</i>, rare Artizans&#146;  (Sanderson, 20). The only work that may be attributed to William Sheppard apart from the portrait of Killigrew is a portrait of Sir Henry Terne (after 1660). It is only known from the engraving by William Faithorne.<br>
<br>George Vertue's information on Sheppard was brief:<blockquote>Mr. Shephard face painter. who livd in K. Charles 2d time. Mr. Russel. when a boy knew him. he livd in London at that time. near the Royal exchange. was a pleasant Companion&#151;afterwards retird into Yorkshire where he died. (Vertue, 4.64)</blockquote>Horace Walpole transcribed Vertue's account in his <span class="italic">Anecdotes</span> but had nothing to add to it.<br>
