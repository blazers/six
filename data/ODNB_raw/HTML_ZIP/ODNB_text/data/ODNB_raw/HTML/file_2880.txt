<span class="headword">Booth,  Henry</span>, first earl of Warrington  (1652&#150;1694), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 13 January 1652, probably at Dunham Massey Hall, Cheshire. He was the eldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2877/', "George Booth, second baronet and first Baron Delamer (1622&#150;1684)")</script>, politician and military leader, and Lady Elizabeth Grey (1621/2&#150;1691), his second wife and the eldest daughter of Henry, first earl of Stamford. One of a dozen children Booth became heir apparent to the barony upon the death of his older brother William in 1662. He was well educated in preparation for the responsibilities of family and position he would assume, but he matriculated neither at Cambridge nor Oxford, nor was he admitted to one of the inns of court as his father had been. Booth succeeded to the title of Baron Delamer [Delamere] on 8 August 1684, the name by which he was best known both to contemporaries and subsequent students of history, and was created earl of Warrington on 17 April 1690.<br>
<br>On 7 July 1670 Booth married Mary Langham (1652&#150;1691), the only child to survive from the several marriages of Sir James Langham, second baronet, of Cottesbrooke, Northamptonshire; Mary was the niece of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/106715/', "Sarah Seymour, duchess of Somerset")</script>. The ceremony took place at St Helen's, Bishopsgate, London, a reflection of the long-standing Langham business interests and political ties in the city. Mary had also been baptized there, on 10 March 1653; she died on 23 March 1691 and was buried in the Booth family vault at Bowdon, Cheshire. Their first born son, James, died an infant. The surviving children included three other sons&#151;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2878/', "George Booth, later the second earl")</script>, Langham, and Henry, and two daughters&#151;Elizabeth and Mary.<h2>
<a name="Exclusionpolitics"></a>Exclusion politics</h2>Booth's public career began in 1673 at the age of twenty-one when his father resigned as <i>custos rotulorum</i> for Cheshire in his favour. The task of presiding over the commission of the peace was combined in many counties with the traditional military duties of the lord lieutenant, but since the lieutenancies of both Cheshire and Lancashire were firmly in the grasp of the earl of Derby, the separation of functions in the former had provided Charles II with a convenient way to recognize the very considerable influence of the Booths without giving substantial offence to the Stanleys. It was a position that Henry Booth learned to use to good advantage as a vehicle for advancing both personal and public goals. Among surviving examples of the charges he delivered to grand juries at the opening of quarter sessions are forceful pleas for the reformation of manners&#151;he inveighs frequently against &#145;Swearing and Drinking&#146; and &#145;the Horrible Profanation of God's name&#146;&#151;as well as cogent analyses of various national issues from a decidedly whig point of view. There is in these speeches, as well as in a number of essays he penned, evidence of a widely read man of strong intellect. They also give clear evidence of his presbyterian upbringing, although he himself conformed to the externals of Anglican practice, and of a degree of self-righteousness that has discomforted historians from Burnet to Macaulay.<br>
<br>In a 1678 by-election Booth was returned unopposed to the House of Commons as a member for Cheshire and as an open and ardent opponent of the court. He was then re-elected to all three Exclusion parliaments, the first two times apparently without contest and to the Oxford parliament with an overwhelming majority despite some local effort to stay the whig juggernaut. While in the Commons, Booth advocated frequent meetings of parliament and spoke out strongly against those members of the lower house who accepted pensions or other perquisites from the king&#151;a stand that would come back to haunt him after the revolution of 1688 when he joined those on the receiving end of such favours. He also agitated for reform of the judiciary. In particular he singled out for stinging criticism Sir George Jeffreys, then (1680) chief justice of Chester, accusing him of heavy drinking, dereliction of duty and generally behaving &#145;himself more like a Jack-Pudding, than with that gravity that beseems a Judge&#146;  (Booth, 143). An early and passionate supporter of exclusion Booth took the position that the duke of York had no absolute right to the crown given the fact that the succession had been altered in the past when circumstances necessitated. As political passions mounted, however, he was careful to temper his rhetoric in an effort to reassure the county community that he was not trying to undermine the institution of monarchy and to quiet fears &#145;That 80, &amp; 81 is become 40, &amp; 41&#146;  (Booth, 627).<br>
<br>Even after the dissolution of the Oxford parliament Booth continued to offend in Stuart eyes. He was, for instance, one of a half dozen individuals prominently identified in the entourage that accompanied the duke of Monmouth on a trip into the north-west in the summer of 1682 likened by some to a royal progress. Then he directed the Cheshire grand jury at the October quarter sessions not to indict protestant dissenters on the grounds that the applicable Elizabethan legislation had really been enacted only for use against Catholics. By the end of the year Booth was removed as <i>custos rotulorum</i> and from the commission of the peace, and with the discovery of the Rye House plot in the summer of 1683 he suddenly found himself taken up with a dozen or more other radical whig activists, including lords Grey, Lovelace, and Russell, and imprisoned in the Tower of London on a charge of treason. In his case Charles II was particularly suspicious, perhaps because the rising that Booth's father had led in 1659&#151;royalist in inspiration though it was&#151;still lingered in memory as an example of the family's ability to command a significant popular following especially among protestant nonconformists. In any event Booth was closely examined by the privy council, and Dunham Massey Hall was carefully searched, as were the homes of surrounding tenants on the theory that weaponry might already have been put in their hands. Several months later he was finally released on bail since nothing could be proved against him.<h2>
<a name="Trialfortreason"></a>Trial for treason</h2>His father having died the year before, Booth took his seat in the House of Lords as second Baron Delamer when parliament assembled shortly after James II ascended the throne in 1685. Then in July, while a prorogation was in effect, he was again arrested on a charge of high treason. Suspected of complicity in the Monmouth rebellion, he was essentially held incommunicado and without formal indictment for several months on the government's expectation that sufficient evidence would come to hand to warrant a trial and secure the conviction he had managed to side-step two years earlier. In truth, Delamer had been incautious in his contacts with agents of the duke of Monmouth, but there is no reliable evidence that he was actually prepared to take up arms even though several individuals were ready to implicate him in order to save their own necks. In any event, there followed some complicated legal manoeuvring. First Delamer petitioned the House of Lords to consider the grounds for his incarceration, arguing that it was a violation of his privilege as a peer and member of parliament. Despite efforts by both the earl of Devonshire and the marquess of Halifax to interest the upper house in the question, the matter was swept aside by a vote to adjourn that brought the session to an end. Delamer next sought and briefly secured his freedom under the terms of the <span class="roman">Habeas Corpus Act</span>. He was soon back in the Tower, however, this time with a bill of particulars specified and a trial date set for 14 January 1686.<br>
<br>Because parliament was not in session jurisdiction in this case fell to a special court presided over by a lord high steward appointed for the occasion by the crown and the lord triers, a panel of peers acting as a jury. The intent, obviously, was to make an example of Delamer. Lord Jeffreys&#151;Delamer's Cheshire &#145;jack-pudding&#146; of 1680 and now the most powerful judge in the land&#151;was put in charge of the proceedings and he, in turn, picked a jury of thirty, of whom Macaulay reports fifteen were commanders of regiments who held their jobs at pleasure, another fifteen were court dependants, and all thirty were tories by political conviction. Heneage Finch, solicitor-general, did his best to make a case for conviction but was able to produce only one direct witness, whose testimony was doubtful at best, and circumstantial evidence that Delamer rebutted with relative ease. At the end of the trial, one by one, each of the twenty-seven lord triers then present declared him not guilty, although Ailesbury reported that the earl of Peterborough, groom of the stole, whispered into the ear of his neighbour just afterwards, &#145;Guilty by God&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 1.135). In fact, the case became something of a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> that caught the attention of the entire political spectrum from Lady Rachel Russell, widow of the whig martyr, to a high-church Oxford tory like Anthony Wood who spent 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. to buy a copy of the pamphlet describing the trial. Certainly Wood and most other loyalists would have agreed with Peterborough's private view of the matter; but the patent unfairness of the proceeding, the trammelling of aristocratic privilege, and perhaps some element of disquiet growing out of the savage revenge visited upon even the most humble followers of Monmouth combined to save Delamer from the axe.<h2>
<a name="Therevolutionof1688"></a>The revolution of 1688</h2>Within the week Delamer was admitted to kiss the king's hand and to be lectured about his future conduct. Thereafter he dropped out of sight for the next few years, except when he agreed in 1687 (with others) to stand surety for the earl of Devonshire who was forced to give the king a bond for &pound;30,000 as a guarantee of good behaviour. Although the circumstances of the case were vastly different, to Delamer it was another instance in which privilege of parliament was being unfairly denied to the accused. Certainly Delamer's name appears on the various lists of peers opposed to James II and his policies drawn up during this period, but he was not admitted to the carefully orchestrated contacts and correspondence that ultimately led to the dispatch of the invitation to William of Orange at the end of June 1688. During that summer, however, he was finally brought into the conspiracy, and evidence survives of meetings with the earl of Devonshire and the bishop of London as plans were developed for risings centred on Nottingham and York to coincide with William's expected arrival along the northern coast. Although he worried about the fate of his family, particularly because the children were so young, Delamer was absolutely confident in his decision to participate. He subsequently elaborated on his reasons for engaging, but at bottom strong religious conviction, pride of class, and a well-developed sense of personal grievance were the key motivators.<br>
<br>While the prince of Orange's descent at Torbay temporarily disrupted the plans of the northern conspirators, Delamer was in motion within less than a week, rallying friends and political associates among the Cheshire gentry and then reaching out for support from his tenantry and others willing to take up arms. Certainly he and the earl of Devonshire and, in turn, Devonshire and the earl of Danby, had to settle on a new timetable for action. But while the others moved cautiously at first Delamer was absolutely forthright about his intentions. On paper and then publicly at Manchester and on Bowdon Downs, where volunteers had been directed to assemble, he declared openly for William rather than taking cover under a call for a free parliament and, as well, made no secret of the planned rendezvous at Nottingham or of the names of the other principals associated in the project. Delamer understood the psychology of the situation. He fully expected that news of his taking up arms would encourage others to do likewise and that it would also complicate planning in London about how to deal with the larger situation at hand. Had there been a body of reliable troops available the force Delamer assembled might easily have been dispersed. However, he and the earl of Derby, recently restored to the lieutenancies of both Cheshire and Lancashire, had agreed that the latter would sit on his hands; and the one band of regular soldiers Delamer encountered at Manchester, a troop under the command of his neighbour Captain Richard Leigh, had yet to receive a supply of arms and, in fact, proved fertile recruiting ground for the rebel side.<br>
<br>On 18 November, Delamer and a few hundred mounted followers rode out from Bowdon Downs, going first to Newcastle under Lyme and then to Derby before reaching Nottingham on the 21st. Newsletters of the day quickly spread word about Delamer's movements, some of them embellishing their reports with tales of plunder, Catholic chapels despoiled, and other violations of the rules of knight errantry. One concluded with some accuracy that &#145;of all the men that have appeared in Armes &amp; declared for the P[rince] none have done more zealously than those who began the Dance in Cheshire who gather weight like a Snow-Ball&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 4194, fol. 426). In fact, a basic difference in strategy if not in ultimate goals became quickly apparent after Delamer arrived at Nottingham. He remained intent on marching south to join William almost immediately, while the earl of Devonshire wanted to play a more cautious game and wait for other associates to come in and for additional troops to be raised and organized. Even the matter of securing agreement about the terms of a public declaration was apparently problematic, with the document that finally appeared focusing on a catalogue of grievances and looking to a freely elected parliament as the sole remedy to the national dilemma. The prince of Orange was not even mentioned, although at the Saturday market just before he left the city, Delamer remedied that lack with a crowd pleasing speech that emphasized the hand of providence in William's arrival to save protestantism and traditional English liberties.<br>
<br>Delamer's departure on 25 November brought with it a switch of partners. Lord Cholmondeley who had accompanied him from Cheshire stayed behind while the earl of Stamford, one of the first peers to join Devonshire, left with his cousin and long-time political associate. They took with them a troop of about 300 horse and set out to the west and then south&#151;through Derby, Lichfield, Worcester, and Tewkesbury&#151;on a line of march intended to avoid contact with any royal forces. Reaching Gloucester at the end of the month Delamer and Stamford freed Lord Lovelace from the castle where he had been held under arrest since making his own abortive attempt to reach the prince. They then moved on to Bristol and remained there until directed by William to join him at Hungerford on 7 December, by which time the focus of attention had shifted rapidly from the military to the political arena. The immediate and pressing problem was what to do about James II now that he had retreated from the contest, and Delamer numbered among the nineteen peers William summoned to consider the question at a meeting at Windsor ten days later. Joined by Lord Mordant, his cousin Stamford, and the earl of Shrewsbury, Delamer urged incarceration in the Tower, a plan the majority of the group wisely eschewed in favour of simply encouraging the king to flee England. That was advice William found to his liking, and he selected Delamer, Halifax, and Shrewsbury to deliver the message, a task by subsequent report that Delamer handled with greater sensitivity than might have been expected. Thereafter, however, he became an outspoken supporter of declaring the throne vacant. As Clarendon records in his diary for 31 January 1689:<blockquote>Lord Delamer said, it was long since he thought himself absolved from his allegiance to King James; that he owed him none and never would pay him any; and if King James came again, he was resolved to fight against him, and would die single with his sword in his hand, rather than pay him any obedience. (Singer, 2.257)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Aftertherevolution"></a>After the revolution</h2>Whatever good feelings Delamer had about the beginning of the reign of William and Mary soon dissipated, despite substantial rewards recognizing his role in bringing them to the throne. Almost immediately (14 February 1689) he was made a member of the privy council, and later that spring he was appointed chancellor of the exchequer (28 March 1689) and one of the commissioners of the Treasury (5 April 1689). William also restored him to the position of <i>custos rotulorum</i> of Cheshire and named him to the lieutenancy, a step taken with some reluctance perhaps because of the bitter quarrel that had erupted between Delamer and the earl of Derby about the latter's failure to act more forcefully during the revolution, but an appointment on which Delamer insisted saying &#145;he would not value all the K[ing] could give him, except hee might have that&#146;  (Foxcroft, 2.209). Other tokens of favour and emoluments followed, including long-term leases on former Jesuit properties in several counties, but appointment to one of the great offices of state eluded him, and Delamer soon came to feel that his advice on major issues confronting the government was ignored. For William, too, the working relationship was less than successful. Tory influence had increased substantially in the parliament elected to replace the Convention, and he needed financial managers able to persuade parliament to pay the bills for his military campaigns and other needs. Accordingly, Delamer and his two whig associates at the Treasury, Henry Capel and the earl of Monmouth, were all removed from their posts in the spring of 1690. To soften the blow Delamer was created earl of Warrington on 17 April of the same year and granted a pension of &pound;2000 payable annually, but frequently paid in arrears.<br>
<br>The decision to push Delamer to the sidelines was wise, given his temperament. &#145;Actuated with a sense of Honour and Justice, not afraid to declare his Opinion, not willing to conceal his Sentiments, which he seldom found reason to alter&#146;, even his eulogist felt constrained to allude to his inflexibility, a rigidity of character simply unsuited for a major governmental post  (Wroe, 19). However, Macaulay's characterization of him: &#145;A restless malecontent even when preferred&#146;  (Macaulay, 3.1797), misses the essence of the man and, rather unfairly, relies on the satirical and Jacobite inspired depiction of Delamer in Arthur Mainwaring's poem, <span class="italic">King of Hearts</span> (1690), from which the line is taken. The truth is that he was something of a throwback to an old-fashioned puritanism. It made him a very difficult man to deal with at close quarters; but it fed a public personality that many protestant dissenters and those to whom the label puritan low-churchmen has been applied found powerfully attractive. It was also the vein he tapped into when he returned to Cheshire in triumph as lord lieutenant in the early summer of 1689, escorted on his way out of London by as many as 500 horse; but at the same time it represented a view of the world that simply did not fit in the delicate balance of party politics that emerged after the revolution. As a consequence Warrington figured ever less importantly in that history, although he continued active in both local politics and parliament. Then late in 1693 he caught a cold at the Middle Temple Hall while listening to legal arguments growing out of a dispute between two peers. Characteristically, he insisted on continuing to attend sessions at the House of Lords, developed a fever and died in London, probably of pneumonia, on 2 January following. He was buried in the family vault at Bowdon twelve days later.<br>
