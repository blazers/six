<span class="headword">Sheldon,  Joseph Harold</span>  (1893&#150;1972), <span class="occ">geriatrician</span>, was born at North View, Derby Road, Woodford, Essex, on 27 September 1893, the eldest son of John Joseph Sheldon (1858&#150;1942), a bank clerk in the City of London and a noted horticulturist who was treasurer of the British Pteridological Society, and his wife, Marion Squire, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Spring, daughter of Henry Spring, a Lloyd's underwriter who insured sailing ships. He had two sisters and two brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31674/', "Sir Wilfred Percy Henry Sheldon")</script>, a paediatrician, and Colin, a general practitioner. Sheldon assisted both his brothers in the cost of their medical training.<br>
<br>Sheldon was educated at Bancroft's School, a Drapers' Company school at Woodford. He left at the age of sixteen to work for Lloyds Bank (for whom his father also worked) but became convinced that he should become a medical missionary. He obtained a Worsley scholarship in 1913 to assist with the cost of training at King's College, London. Following the outbreak of the First World War he joined the Royal Navy as a surgeon probationer, serving on HMS <i>Wisteria</i> in the Mediterranean. He qualified in 1918, continuing to serve after the conclusion of hostilities as a surgeon-lieutenant on a minesweeper in the Baltic. While serving in the navy he decided not to become a medical missionary and gave up the Worsley scholarship, aiming to return the money he had been given. Following demobilization he was appointed to junior medical posts at King's College Hospital, London, and in 1920 became MD and MRCP. In 1921 he was appointed to the staff of the Royal Hospital, Wolverhampton, as a consultant physician, and on 6 July the same year he married Marjorie Bannister, the 29-year-old daughter of George Henry Bannister, schoolteacher, of Newport, Monmouthshire. They had one daughter, Margaret (Peggy) (<i>b</i>. 1924).<br>
<br>A modest unassuming man with a considerable capacity for friendship, who was always ready to give help and who inspired affection and admiration, Sheldon was a gifted teacher with astute clinical observation. His renown soon spread across the west midlands. He was appointed Hunterian professor of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1928, elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1929, and appointed lecturer in medicine at Birmingham University in 1942. Initially his clinical research was into endocrine disorders, maternal obesity, and mineral elements, which culminated in a major study of haemochromatosis, presented to Royal College of Physicians in its Bradshaw lecture in 1934 and published as a detailed monograph in 1935. He subsequently developed a deep interest in older people. He held his out-patient sessions in Wolverhampton on market days so that patients could visit him more easily. He studied older people in the community using the ration card register to locate a sample of 583 old people. The results were published in 1948 as <span class="italic">The Social History of Old Age</span>, and were the basis of his F. E. Williams lecture to the Royal College of Physicians in 1949. More papers on age and ageing followed. His work was acknowledged internationally by his appointment as the president of the International Association of Gerontology in 1954. His presidential address, &#145;The social philosophy of old age&#146;, was given in London at the association's third congress that year, and subsequently published in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>.<br>
<br>In the 1950s the Birmingham regional hospital board (whose consultant services committee Sheldon chaired from 1948) became concerned about the quality of care given to its elderly patients and asked Sheldon to survey its entire regional geriatric services. Sheldon's report was published in 1961. A highly unsatisfactory state of affairs was revealed. Hospital buildings, some of which were over 200 years old, were unfit for purpose, having been originally designed as &#145;human warehouses&#146;. He recommended that six should be either partially or totally demolished. He found it totally unsatisfactory that the same room should be used for washing bedpans, and domestic crockery and bedpans stored for the night in the patients' bath. The report aroused considerable ire in the medical and national press. Subsequently the regional authorities designed purpose-built geriatric units, giving Sheldon's name to them as well as to new medical research fellowships.<br>
<br>Sheldon was a councillor of the Royal College of Physicians from 1948 to 1950, and was awarded the college's Moxon medal in 1966. He examined in medicine in the universities of Birmingham, London, Bristol, Liverpool, and Kaherere, Uganda. He was appointed CBE in 1955, made an honorary fellow of King's College, London, in 1956, and awarded honorary doctorates by Bristol and Birmingham universities, in 1958 and 1965 respectively. It is said that he refused more professorial chairs in medicine than anyone else had ever done. His outside interests included cycling, ecclesiastical architecture, mountaineering, photography, and ornithology. He was a member of the Alpine Club and in 1928 took part in a courageous Alpine rescue operation on the Aiguille du Petit Dru, for which the French government honoured him. He published his observations on the northern golden plover in <span class="italic">British Birds</span>. His first wife died in 1927, while on holiday in the Alps, and on 9 November 1963 he married Florence Maud Luckett, a secretary, and daughter of Herbert William Luckett. He died on 23 June 1972 at his home, Monkhams, Codsall Wood, Seisdon, Staffordshire, of bronchopneumonia, and was survived by his daughter, Peggy, and wife, Florence.<br>
