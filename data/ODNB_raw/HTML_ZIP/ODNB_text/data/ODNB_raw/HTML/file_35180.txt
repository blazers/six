<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Myres, Sir  John Linton</span>  (1869&#150;1954), <span class="occ">archaeologist and historian</span>, was born on 3 July 1869 at Preston, Lancashire, the only son of the Revd William Miles Myres (<i>d</i>. 1901), vicar of St Paul's, Preston, and his first wife, Jane, daughter of the Revd Henry Linton. He won scholarships to Winchester College, thence to New College, Oxford, where he took first classes in honour moderations (1890) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1892). He had already shown a lively interest in antiquities and local history as an undergraduate, publishing articles, digging at Alchester, and organizing the local history museum at Aylesbury. As a fellow of Magdalen (1892&#150;5) and Craven fellow (1892) he was able to visit the Mediterranean, travelling in the Greek islands, exploring Caria and the Dodecanese, and working with Arthur Evans. He travelled widely in Crete, collecting minor antiquities and copying inscriptions. These were the early days of excavation in the island and of the discovery of Minoan civilization, although Knossos itself had yet to be dug. By comparing Cretan vases with some vase fragments found by Flinders Petrie in Egypt, at Kahun, he found the first important link and correlation to be observed between the two ancient civilizations. He did not join Evans in the excavations at Knossos, but dug with the British School at Palaikastro, and, notably, at the hilltop shrine of Petsofa, the finds from which he soon published.<br>
<br>It was to Cyprus and to Cypriot antiquities that much of his archaeological work was at first devoted, and he several times returned to the problems of its archaeology in his writings. He had conducted excavations in the island in 1894, at Kition; he wrote a catalogue of the Cyprus Museum (1899, with M. Ohnefalsch-Richter); and in 1914 published an exemplary catalogue of the rich Cesnola collection in New York. In these years he had been a student of Christ Church (1895&#150;1907) and university lecturer in classical archaeology, and he went to Liverpool as professor of Greek and lecturer in ancient geography (1907&#150;10). In his early teaching and writing his knowledge of the geography of the Aegean was put to good account and he had the happy gift of being able to elucidate problems of antiquity by modern analogies. Quite apart from his Greek studies, he wrote a schools' <span class="italic">History of Rome</span> which was published in 1902.<br>
<br>The creation of the new Wykeham professorship in ancient history took Myres back to Oxford in 1910 and he held this chair until his retirement in 1939. The title of his inaugural lecture&#151;&#145;Greek lands and the Greek people&#146;&#151;set the theme of his future interests and these years saw the publication of several books on the various aspects of ancient history which his wide experience encompassed. <span class="italic">The Dawn of History</span> (1911) was a semi-popular exposition of fundamental principles about the study of early civilizations and approach to ancient history. It displayed already the easy style of writing which informed all his work. To the <span class="italic">Cambridge Ancient History</span> he contributed several chapters. <span class="italic">Who Were the Greeks?</span> (1930) was his most brilliant and provocative work, based on the Sather lectures which he had been again invited to deliver in California in 1927 (the first time had been in 1914). On Sir Arthur Evans's death in 1941 he took on the task of editing the Linear B tablets from Knossos which, half a century after their discovery, were finally published (as <span class="italic">Scripta Minoa II</span>) in 1952, and he lived to applaud the decipherment by Michael Ventris of their language as Greek. Myres continued writing until his death&#151;a vivid and highly personal account, <span class="italic">Herodotus: Father of History</span> (1953), and essays on <span class="italic">Homer and his Critics</span>, edited after his death by Dorothea Gray in 1958. To his collection of essays <span class="italic">Geographical History in Greek Lands</span> (1953), he appended a select bibliography of his writings. The most valuable aspect of his work was probably not so much the new material or solutions which he presented&#151;although these were numerous&#151;but the challenging approach to the more conventional problems of ancient history which a scholar versed in geography, anthropology, and the classics could take. His services to scholarship were recognized by honorary degrees from Wales, Manchester, Witwatersrand, and Athens, and the Victoria medal of the Royal Geographical Society (1953). He was elected FBA in 1923 and knighted in 1943.<br>
<br>Myres's interests were not confined to any narrow field of research in antiquity. When he went to Greece in 1892 one of his awards was the Burdett-Coutts geological scholarship. As an anthropologist he served the Royal Anthropological Institute as its honorary secretary, then president (1928&#150;31); and in 1901 he had inaugurated its new monthly periodical, <span class="italic">Man</span>, which he edited in 1901&#150;3, and again in 1931&#150;46, and to which he regularly contributed on subjects often far removed from classical studies. As a Hellenist and archaeologist he was vice-president of the Society of Antiquaries (1924&#150;9) and its gold medallist in 1942; president of the Hellenic Society (1935&#150;8); chairman of the British School at Athens (1934&#150;47), and organizer of its jubilee exhibition in Burlington House in 1936. He was librarian of New College, Oxford, up to 1946. He was general secretary of the British Association from 1919 to 1932, following its conferences to many parts of the world. His range in scholarship was matched by the variety and vigour of his other activities. As well as his concern for the administration and welfare of the various societies which he served, he was active in Oxford politics, in the establishment of new graduate degrees, and the promotion of new subjects, notably geography and anthropology. In the First World War he commanded small craft in raiding operations on the Turkish coast on the tug <i>Syros</i> and then the former royal yacht <i>Aulis</i>. In this his ingenuity and buccaneering spirit served him no less than his detailed knowledge of the geography and people of the Asia Minor coast. He ended the war as acting commander of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and was made OBE and appointed to the Greek order of George I. In the Second World War he used his great experience of the geography of Greece in editing handbooks for naval intelligence.<br>
<br>Through most of his life Myres was troubled by his eyesight and at the end, although still writing, was quite blind. In appearance he was a handsome man, bearded and blue-eyed. In his dealings with younger scholars he was generous and kindly, and his work must be judged not only by what he wrote but also by what he inspired in others, by example or casual precept. He founded no school. In his lifetime he saw classical archaeology grow from a dilettante study to a discipline which has much to contribute to all departments of classical scholarship. His part in this development was to show how historian, archaeologist, anthropologist, and geographer should combine their skills in the study of antiquity.<br>
<br>In 1895 Myres married Sophia Florence (<i>d</i>. 1960), daughter of Charles Ballance, with whom he had two sons and one daughter. The younger son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39815/', "John Nowell Linton Myres")</script>, was Bodley's librarian at Oxford (1948&#150;65). Myres died in Oxford on 6 March 1954.<br>
