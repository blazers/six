<span class="headword">Holme,  Benjamin</span>  (1683&#150;1749), <span class="occ">Quaker minister</span>, was born of Quaker parentage at Penrith, Cumberland, in January 1683 <span class="smallcap">NS</span> and brought up as a Friend. In his autobiography he says that &#145;he grew up in wildness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collection of the Epistles</span>) but that when he was about fourteen years of age he prayed, and that somewhat later he testified at Quaker meetings for worship. While still very young he was recognized as a minister and travelled to &#145;visit Friends&#146;. In 1699 he made a journey with Leonard Fell and Joseph Kirkbride, an American Friend, through the north of England. Two years later he visited a number of meetings in the east and west of England and in Wales, and in 1703 he went to Scotland, where he was imprisoned for a night at Glasgow for travelling on the sabbath. The following year he visited Ireland for the first time.<br>
<br>In April 1706 Holme went to live at York, where he appears to have been engaged in business, but he continued to spend a large part of each year in ministerial journeys. In 1712 he again visited Ireland; he was imprisoned at Longford for holding a Quaker meeting, and was ill-treated at Londonderry. In the following year he published <span class="italic">A Tender Invitation and Call to All People, to Embrace the Offers of God's Love</span>. In 1714 he visited the Friends in the Netherlands, and in the following year those in New England, travelling thence down the eastern colonies to the Carolinas. While in America he debated in public with various ministers but he escaped persecution; he also wrote a tract against mixed marriages, which were then common among American Quakers. In 1719 he visited the West Indies for a few months and was received with kindness by the governors of various islands. He returned to England via Ireland in 1720.<br>
<br>In 1722 Holme took an active part in obtaining from parliament a less objectionable form of affirmation than that then prescribed for Quakers. During the following year he again went to the Netherlands and while there he visited the Baptists and wrote <span class="italic">A Serious Call</span>, a treatise giving a succinct account of Quaker principles, which was first printed in Dutch and published in 1723; it was subsequently reprinted twenty-four times in English and translated into Latin, French, and Welsh. The following two and a half years were chiefly spent in a minute investigation of the Quaker meetings in Ireland. In a letter to David Bull of Tottenham, dated December 1725, Holme states that he was arrested at Letterkenny for refusing to make a declaration of fidelity in a form that was unacceptable to Quaker thinking, but that he was released after some time at the instance of the bishop of Raphoe. After his return from Ireland, Holme was chiefly occupied in ministerial journeys in England and Scotland. He visited Ireland again in 1734 and once paid a visit to Jersey, where a small meeting was much oppressed by the magistrates, and sought to obtain redress for their grievances.<br>
<br>It is not known whether Holme married. He died at Swansea on 14 April 1749 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, following an illness brought on by attending a meeting when in bad health, and was buried there. He was widely esteemed, plain, simple, and charitable. His writings are extremely practical and broad in tone, while their style is pleasant and lucid. An autobiographical work, <span class="italic">A collection of the epistles and works of Benjamin Holme, to which is prefixed an account of his life and travels in the work of the ministry, through several parts of Europe and America, written by himself</span>, was published posthumously in 1753 and reprinted in 1754.<br>
