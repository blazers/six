<span class="headword">Levy,  Lewis</span>  (1785/6&#150;1856), <span class="occ">farmer of tolls</span>, was probably born in 1786, but nothing else is known about his early life. Until 1864&#150;5, tolls were levied on the major roads leading into London. The resulting revenue was used to repair and sometimes light the roads, and to service the debts incurred during construction and maintenance work. Collection of the tolls was generally not carried out by the turnpike authorities themselves, but was let by auction. Levy bid at these auctions, often with partners, sometimes as lessee or joint lessee, sometimes as surety. However, he was the dominant partner in these transactions and he was so successful that he became known as Turnpike Levy.<br>
<br>The earliest known record of Levy as a toll lessee dates from 1812. By 1825, he rented about three-quarters of the tolls in Middlesex and the neighbourhood of London, and in 1832 <span class="italic">The Times</span> referred to him as &#145;the master of nearly all the toll gates within 15 miles of London&#146;  (20 Aug 1832). In 1839, asked by the parliamentary select committee on turnpike roads whether he farmed them to a great extent, he responded &#145;Not so great an extent as I used to do. I used to farm &pound;400,000 or &pound;500,000 a year. I think I have had as much as &pound;300,000 or &pound;400,000 with Post Horse Duties&#146;  (&#145;Select committee on the effect of the formation of railroads&#146;, qq. 204&#150;7). He had not come prepared to say what the current amount was, but it was nothing like one fourth as much, he thought about &pound;100,000. In 1854, however, he was again reported as leasing most of the tolls north of the Thames.<br>
<br>Levy also lent funds to turnpike trusts to finance road improvements, although his offer to lend &pound;10,000 to the commissioners of the metropolitan roads had been turned down in 1827. He told the same select committee that he &#145;unfortunately&#146; was a creditor on a great many turnpike roads, meaning that they had defaulted on interest or repayment and that he had had to exercise his right to collect the tolls to recover the money owed him  (&#145;Select committee &hellip; formation of railroads&#146;, q. 220).<br>
<br>Levy's name came before the public not only in newspaper reports of the auctions, but also in their reports of court cases, notably of one initiated by Cobbett in 1823, acting on behalf of &#145;several poor persons&#146;. He claimed that Levy's toll-keepers were charging more than the law allowed for a one-horse cart. He was invited to sit on the bench. <span class="italic">The Times</span> reported Cobbett as saying to Levy &#145;You are a Jew I suppose,&#146; to which Levy replied &#145;I am a Jew, it is true; but you are neither Jew, Christian or any other religion. You are an atheist as everybody knows&#146;  (17 Oct 1823). Cobbett then complained: &#145;I abstained from abuse &hellip; But he called me an atheist. This Jew-dog called me an atheist, this Jew-dog did&#146;  (21 Oct 1823). In another case, Levy had his claimed right to charge king's messengers confirmed. In 1830, he petitioned the House of Commons, saying that he did not desire the franchise but wanted a law removing doubts as to the ability of Jews to hold landed property.<br>
<br>Levy is known to have been married twice. His first wife was named Elizabeth, his second Rebecca. He died on 30 November 1856 at his home, 55 Tavistock Square, London. He had no children, but left half his fortune to his stepson Jonas, Elizabeth's son by her first marriage (to a Joseph Levy). Jonas, a lawyer, became vice-chairman of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway. The other half went to Levy's brother Nathaniel, who, like Jonas, had participated with Levy in turnpike contracting. The size of this fortune, amounting to approximately &pound;250,000, testifies to the importance of Levy's business.<br>
