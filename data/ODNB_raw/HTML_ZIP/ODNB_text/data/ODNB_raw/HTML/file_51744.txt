<span class="headword">Smith,  Mary  Bentinck</span>  (1864&#150;1921), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was born on 2 November 1864 at Hamburg, the daughter of James Smith (1822&#150;1906), a Congregational minister of great learning, and his wife, Countess (Wilhelmina) Augusta Friederike Bentinck (1834&#150;1922), daughter of Willem, second Count Bentinck in the nobility of the Holy Roman Empire (a great-grandson of Hans Willem, first earl of Portland), and his second wife, Sara Geddes. She had a younger brother, William Frederick Bentinck Smith (<i>b</i>. 1872), who became professor of philosophy at Tulane University, New Orleans. Mary was educated privately in England and France, and at the public girls' school at Wiesbaden. In 1890 she won a scholarship to Girton College, Cambridge, gaining a starred first in the medieval and modern languages tripos in 1893, and a second class in English in 1894, later gaining the degrees of MA (1904) and DLitt from Trinity College, Dublin. In the same year she wrote to the University of Edinburgh to ask whether women might be considered for lectureships recently advertised, but the court &#145;did not contemplate the appointment of women&#146;. She went on to build the first part of her career in the women's colleges.<br>
<br>From 1894 to 1897 Miss Bentinck Smith was lecturer in modern languages at Victoria College, Belfast, and during the next two years in German and philology at Royal Holloway College. She returned to Girton in 1899 as lecturer in medieval and modern languages and became director of studies in 1901. She established an international reputation as a Chaucer scholar. She published an edition of his <span class="italic">Prologue</span> and <span class="italic">Knight's Tale</span> (1908), translated <span class="italic">The Language and Metre of Chaucer</span> from the German of B. Ten Brink (1901), made valuable contributions to the <span class="italic">English Dialect Dictionary</span> and to the <span class="italic">Cambridge History of English Literature</span>, and translated O. L. Jiriczek's <span class="italic">Northern Hero Legends</span> (1902). So far her career was a paradigm of a successful new academic woman.<br>
<br>In 1906 Miss Bentinck Smith was appointed principal of Avery Hill Training College, founded by the London county council in the opulent mansion of a self-made City man, the first and most prestigious of the colleges the new local education authority was empowered to provide under the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1902. The principal was to be responsible not only for college &#145;instruction&#146;, but also for the &#145;board, recreation and social life of the students in residence&#146;, with a salary of &pound;500 and residence, calculated at &pound;100. Within two months of taking up the appointment, she was taken ill and &#145;never returned to her desk&#146;  (Shorney, 53). In this short time she had made her mark on the college, insisting on high academic standards while paying close attention to the students' welfare. Forty years later she was still remembered with affection, one of a small number of women who began to transform training colleges from oppressive and restrictive sectarian seminaries into stimulating places of professional education.<br>
<br>In 1907 Mary Bentinck Smith became headmistress of St Leonards School, St Andrews, founded by a Girton pioneer and already flourishing, with high academic standards. Although lacking previous school experience she quickly identified herself with St Leonards. Her staff and pupils appreciated her magnetic personality, her genius for friendship, and her sense of humour. She herself was an original and stimulating teacher. A woman of deep faith, her scripture lessons were especially memorable, and in all her teaching girls remembered that there was &#145;no spoon feeding&#146;. Pupils were encouraged to read up a subject for themselves, to draw their own conclusions, and form their own judgements.<br>
<br>The whole curriculum was kept under constant review. Since 1902 the school had been recognized as teaching for the first MB of the University of London. Under Miss Bentinck Smith, one of the pioneers of science teaching for girls, two new laboratories and a lecture theatre were built, and opened in 1908 by Sir Ernest Shackleton. An additional mistress was appointed for science, and it became a separate department under its own head. Vocational education was provided in Spanish and typewriting for those who desired it. Aural culture was added to the music course, already very wide and part of the main curriculum, while art was seriously taught. A special domestic science department was created for girls over seventeen, who continued their general education and were examined for the certificates of the Edinburgh School of Cookery. Above all the academic standards of the school were maintained, and indeed raised to meet the increasing competition for places at the Oxford, Cambridge, and London colleges and the needs of the new Higher Certificate. Help and encouragement were given to girls in relation to higher education and their choice of careers.<br>
<br>Miss Bentinck Smith was one of the first women JPs for the county of Fife. She helped to found the Girls' Club and the Women Citizens' Association in St Andrews. She also served her former college, and in 1916 was elected by the Girton College Roll to the college council. In spite of the long journey from Scotland she seldom failed to attend its meetings, though the war years were a great strain upon her health. Mary Bentinck Smith died at St Leonards School, St Andrews, on 20 December 1921. Her academic record was one of high distinction and Girton, Avery Hill, and St Leonards had all benefited from her clear-sighted policy and optimistic outlook, which helped her to overcome obstacles to progress in women's education. Girton acknowledged her contribution by erecting wrought-iron entrance gates as a memorial. <span class="italic">Ad vitam: Papers of a Headmistress</span>, a volume of her school sermons and addresses, was published posthumously. It included papers on the educational ideals of H. G. Wells, the education of girls intending to enter the medical profession, and the need to provide support for women wishing to carry out academic research. Her account &#145;The girls' school in literature and life&#146;, reviewing the history of girls' education as depicted in fiction, concluded that there was &#145;no just reason for excluding [girls] from the practice of any profession worthy of a human being's interest and devotion&#146;  (Smith, 108).<br>
