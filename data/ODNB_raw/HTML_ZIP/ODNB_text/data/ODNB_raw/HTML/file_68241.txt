<span class="headword">Newdigate,  Sebastian</span>  (1500&#150;1535), <span class="occ">Carthusian monk and Roman Catholic martyr</span>, was born on 7 September 1500 at Harefield, Middlesex, the seventh of seventeen children of John Newdigate (<i>d</i>. 1528), serjeant-at-law, and his wife, Amphyllis (<i>d</i>. 1544), daughter and heir of John Neville of Rolleston, Nottinghamshire, a kinsman of the earls of Westmorland. The family was influential politically, and Newdigate was brought up at court. He may have spent time at Cambridge University, and later became a favoured member of Henry VIII's privy chamber. Newdigate married Katherine, daughter of Sir John Hampden of Great Hampden and widow of Henry Ferrers. They had two daughters, Amphyllis and Elizabeth.<br>
<br>Following Katherine's death, Newdigate entered the London Charterhouse. His elder sister Jane Dormer (1496&#150;1571), wife of Sir Robert Dormer of Wing, Buckinghamshire, visited the prior to question Sebastian's suitability for so strict an order, after life at court. Nevertheless Newdigate was admitted, was ordained deacon on 3 June 1531, and had become a priest before he died. His family was exceptionally devout: two brothers were knights of St John, two sisters became nuns, at Syon and at Holywell, and Jane Dormer was renowned for her piety. In the later 1520s Newdigate was himself involved in the confiscation of protestant books in London, where he brought to light the activities of the radical heretics known as the Christian Brethren. The London Charterhouse was at the forefront of the propaganda war against protestantism in England. In May 1535, after the community refused to accept Henry VIII's supremacy over the English church, Prior Houghton and two other Carthusian priors were martyred. A few days later Newdigate and two fellow monks were arrested. They were imprisoned for a fortnight, chained to pillars by their necks and legs, standing in their own excrement to encourage them to capitulate. The king allegedly visited Newdigate, trying to persuade him to recant with alternate entreaties and threats. All three monks stood firm and were condemned for treason. On 19 June they were dragged on hurdles to Tyburn, where they were hanged and quartered, and their remains displayed around the city.<br>
<br>Newdigate is said to have been quite tall, well-proportioned, and attractive. He was lively and pleasant, and behaved with directness and honesty. His courageous death, as one of eighteen Carthusians martyred under Henry VIII, inspired others to adhere to Roman Catholicism, notably members of his own family. He was beatified in 1886 by Pope Leo XIII.<br>
