<span class="headword">Kirkton,  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1699), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and historian</span>, was born most probably in south-east Scotland; his parents are unknown. He graduated MA at Edinburgh in 1647, and became minister of Lanark (second charge) in 1655 and of Mertoun in Berwickshire in 1657. On 31 December 1657 he married Elizabeth Baillie (<i>c</i>.1640&#150;1697); they had five children who reached maturity.<br>
<br>At Mertoun, Kirkton excommunicated a local landowner, Anthony Haig, for being a Quaker, and afterwards had difficulty collecting his stipend. He was expelled in 1662 with about 270 other presbyterian ministers who refused to conform to episcopacy. Kirkton moved to Edinburgh, became a noted illegal preacher there, and was a leading opponent of the second indulgence of 1672, which would have allowed most presbyterian ministers to function officially again though under strict conditions. He also conducted a long debate by letters against Gideon Scott on the tenets of Quakers. In 1674 Kirkton was declared rebel, but seems to have lived openly for two more years until arrested by Captain Carstairs. He was rescued by his brother-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1068/', "Robert Baillie")</script> of Jerviswood (<i>d</i>. 1684), but Baillie and his companions were imprisoned and fined, and Kirkton and the other rebel ministers &#145;intercommuned&#146;, which meant that anyone conversing with them could be held equally guilty of their crimes. He then lived mainly in England and the Netherlands.<br>
<br>With the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> of 1687 Kirkton returned to Scotland and was minister of Edinburgh's Tolbooth parish from 1691. In his last years he was again a famous preacher, and financially prosperous. One source records that Kirkton had a weak voice, and that his dark periwig disguised hair of a different colour. All agree that he had a marked Scots accent, and that his speech was terse, idiomatic, and often sardonic. The most famous anti-presbyterian tract, <span class="italic">The Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence</span> (1692), describes Kirkton as &#145;the Everlasting Comedian of their Party&#146;  (20), and ridicules him more than any other minister. He appears somewhat more favourably in Pitcairn's satirical play, <span class="italic">The Assembly</span> (written 1692), as Mr Covenant Plain-Dealer.<br>
<br>Kirkton wrote a short biography of John Welsh (1703), and <span class="italic">The Secret and True History of the Church of Scotland</span>, from 1660 to 1679, which also covers many secular issues. It was completed in 1693, apparently in reaction to <span class="italic">Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence</span>, and circulated in manuscripts in the eighteenth century. Much of his evidence is included in Robert Wodrow's <span class="italic">The History of the Sufferings of the Church of Scotland</span> (1721&#150;2), but Kirkton's history remains an important historical source: he was well informed (his contacts included the duchess of Lauderdale, whose husband controlled Scotland), usually temperate in judgements, and apparently reliable. Indeed Sir Walter Scott (relative of Gideon Scott, the Quaker) says in his review of the history that Kirkton was &#145;incapable of perverting the truth so far as it was known to him&#146;  (Scott, 506).<br>
<br>Kirkton's wife died in April 1697; he himself died on 17 September 1699. He was buried on 20 September 1699 in Greyfriars churchyard, Edinburgh, where most of his family were interred.<br>
