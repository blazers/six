<span class="headword">Hardy,  John James</span>  (1854&#150;1932), <span class="occ">manufacturer of fishing tackle</span>, was born at Grosvenor Terrace, Alnwick, Northumberland, on 4 April 1854, the second son of John James Hardy (<i>b</i>. 1831), coroner for north Northumberland, and his wife, Jane Newton. After attending Duke's School, Alnwick, in 1862&#150;8 he was intended for a career in marine engineering but instead joined a firm making guns and fishing rods, which was founded in Alnwick in 1872 by his elder brother, <a href="#cosubject_56189">William Hardy [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>The first of its type in the town, the business grew steadily. Traditional handicraft skills were combined with detailed engineering innovation to produce rods made from bamboo segments (some, especially the Palakona range, built round a steel core) and aluminium reels such as the Model Perfect, much sought after by collectors. The gunmaking was soon supplanted by angling goods, shown in increasingly comprehensive catalogues; the 1905 issue had 400 pages, mostly of items made in house. By the time it moved to a substantial new factory, Alnwick's North British Works, in 1890, the firm had acquired a reputation as the manufacturer of some of the world's finest, and most expensive, fishing tackle, with retail branches in Edinburgh, Manchester, and London, as well as extensive overseas outlets.<br>
<br>Although its employees grew rapidly in number, from thirty to, eventually, several hundreds, it remained a paternalistic family business, with annual works' outings paid for out of the profits; when it was made into a private limited liability company in 1907 many of the employees, including women fly tyers, bought shares. The firm's success lured competitors to Alnwick but they never matched its achievements. John James Hardy served as managing director until his seventies. He developed considerable skills as a publicist and Hardys became a major exhibitor at international exhibitions, winning fifty-two gold medals and other awards for the quality of its products. William held royal warrants from George V and from the kings of Italy and Spain.<br>
<br>A dedicated fisherman from childhood, John James used his prowess as a pleasure angler to win international casting competitions, using ordinary Hardy production rods as another form of advertising. After his first victory in Edinburgh in 1892, and a good placing in Scarborough two years later, he established his reputation at the Crystal Palace in 1904 by winning four separate events in the trout and salmon sections, the first person ever to do so, and then triumphed at the Franco-British exhibition in 1908, together with his nephews as back-up. After further victories in France, in competitions sponsored by the Casting Club de France, his last appearance was in London's South Norwood at the age of seventy-eight, when he demonstrated various casting techniques. He was also a prolific and highly regarded angling journalist, which led <span class="italic">Country Life</span> to commission his major standard work, <span class="italic">Salmon Fishing</span>, in 1907. In that book he demonstrated his deep understanding of riparian ecology and his passion for inventing new fishing lures.<br>
<br>A solid Conservative and Anglican, Hardy never married. An inveterate traveller in Britain and Europe in search of business, fishing, and shooting, he remained firmly attached to Northumberland, settling eventually in Alnmouth. He died in his house there, Alnbrae, on 24 June 1932, from the after-effects of a seizure brought on by fishing the River Coquet a month earlier; his funeral in Alnwick parish church on 28 June was packed by Hardys employees. Apart from bequests to servants and local churches, he endowed a university entrance scholarship for boys from his old school, Duke's.<br>
<br>His elder brother, <a name="cosubject_56189"></a><span class="headword">William Hardy</span>  (1852&#150;1928)<span class="occ"></span>, was born at Clayport Street, Alnwick, on 29 October 1852 and attended Duke's School from 1861 to 1867. Apart from founding the gun and fishing tackle business, he also had interests in the Alnwick Brewery and the <span class="italic">Alnwick and County Gazette</span>, being a director of both companies. William married, on 19 October 1882, Barbara Mary, the daughter of Robert Leighton of Felton, Northumberland; they had five sons and a daughter. Two of the sons, Lawrence Robert and Harold John, were also casting champions and all the family held posts in the firm; at incorporation seven of the family were directors. William died at his house, Oaklands, Alnwick, on 7 February 1928. He was survived by his wife.<br>
