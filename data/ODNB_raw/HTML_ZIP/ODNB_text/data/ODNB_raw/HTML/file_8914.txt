<span class="headword">&AElig;thelred</span>  (<em>d.</em> 888), <span class="occ">archbishop of Canterbury</span>, was archbishop from 870 until his death on 30 June 888, during the height of the viking wars. The statement in the F version of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> that he was the bishop of Wiltshire before his translation to Canterbury in 870 was derived from the life of Archbishop &AElig;lfric a century later, and cannot be accepted. Pope John VIII instructed &AElig;thelred to encourage English churchmen to give up their short-cut tunics and to follow continental practice in wearing full ankle-length habits, but the archbishop's main concern was dealing with the viking threat. Evidence from a coin hoard, which suggests that a viking force may have occupied the great archiepiscopal manor of Croydon in Surrey at some time between 869 and 872, or soon after this, helps to indicate the seriousness of this threat. The manor was assessed at 80 hides in 1066, so its loss deprived either the archbishopric or its lessee of valuable revenues. There was also a deterioration in the literacy of the cathedral community at Canterbury, reaching such a stage that its scribes could not translate documents from Latin into English. In addition there was a disagreement between Archbishop &AElig;thelred and King Alfred as to the extent of the royal lordship over ecclesiastics, and it is possible that authority over the Kentish monasteries was in dispute. During &AElig;thelred's period as archbishop there was, however, one important gain for the see. The &#145;golden gospels&#146; were donated to Canterbury by Ealdorman Alfred who had bought them from a heathen army for a sum of pure gold. &AElig;thelred made attempts to overcome the threats posed by the vikings and the West Saxon monarchy and he established important links with a wealthy patron, but during his pontificate, as a result of its scribes' poor literacy, Canterbury was no longer able to fulfil its metropolitan role in providing bishops-elect with professions of faith.<br>
