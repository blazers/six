<span class="headword">Walton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bourchier]</span>,  Philippa</span>  (1674/5&#150;1749), <span class="occ">gunpowder manufacturer</span>, was the fourth of five daughters and the coheir of John Bourchier of Ipswich, MD. She married William Walton, a London merchant, who in 1702 set up as a gunpowder manufacturer at Waltham Abbey in Essex, and at Balham in Surrey where they lived. Her husband became one of the largest suppliers of gunpowder to the government's Ordnance board, and when William died intestate in 1711 Philippa became the sole administrator of his estate. She was then thirty-six and the mother of ten young children, nine of whom were to survive her.<br>
<br>Philippa Walton took over the management of the gunpowder business, initially on her own; then in 1723 she brought in her second eldest son, John, as a partner with a quarter share. In 1730 they formed an equal partnership, a partnership valued in 1732 at &pound;10,000. The evidence suggests that Philippa Walton retained a close interest in the business thereafter, and that she did not immediately become a sleeping partner. It was not until the mid-1740s that she retired to Ongar in Essex to live with her sister, Jane Bourchier. The period when she took control was a difficult one for the gunpowder industry. The end of the War of Spanish Succession in 1714 and the long period of peace until the 1740s meant a drop in demand from the largest customer, the Ordnance board. There was a private market to be exploited, but this could never compensate for the drop in demand. Under such circumstances the industry contracted: some producers reduced their capacity, others withdrew. Philippa Walton chose the former course. She ceased production at Balham and concentrated on the site at Waltham Abbey, purchasing it outright in 1718 for &pound;1100, her own family acting as trustees.<br>
<br>During the first decade of her management Philippa Walton was one of the few producers to obtain the scarcer ordnance contracts, and she entered into partnership with three other producers to build a gunpowder magazine at Barking in Essex and exploit the private markets. The business continued unchanged after her son became involved, and in the 1740s it was sufficiently robust to emerge as the second largest supplier to the Ordnance during the War of Austrian Succession. Other producers who had continued after 1714 were not so successful in maintaining their businesses intact.<br>
<br>Philippa Walton was not the only widow to produce gunpowder in the early eighteenth century, but she was the most successful and the only one to continue so long. Nothing is known about the problems she faced as a woman in business but it can be noted that the <span class="italic">Commons Journals</span> entered her name as Philip not Philippa in 1718  (<span class="italic">Commons Journals</span>, 19, 1718, 85). She died on 7 December 1749, probably at Ongar in Essex, and was buried in the churchyard at Mickleham, Surrey, where her son Philip was vicar. Her memorial at Mickleham records that she died &#145;in calm and Christian serenity&#146; after having improved her property and formed the minds of her children by her instruction and example. In her will she emphasized that her six sons had already received sufficient assistance to satisfy any claim on their father's estate, and so left her share of the partnership to her three surviving daughters, all of whom remained spinsters. Soon afterwards her son John purchased this share.<br>
<br>Philippa Walton's eldest son, William, was to be one of only two sons not involved in the family business, and he was the only child to have children. After John's death in 1757, the business passed to a succession of three of Philippa's other male children until 1782, when Philippa's grandchild, John Walton, inherited. It was he who sold the Waltham Abbey site to the Ordnance board in 1789, after which it remained in government hands as an important explosives production site until the Second World War.<br>
