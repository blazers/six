<span class="headword">Morrison,  Agnes Brysson Inglis <span class="st"> [Nancy; </span></span> <span class="st"> <em>pseud. </em>Christine Strathern]</span>  (1903&#150;1986), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 24 December 1903 at Merchiston, Scotstounhill, Renfrew, near Glasgow, the fifth of six children of Arthur Mackie Morrison, engineer, son of a Glasgow baillie, and his wife, Agnes Brysson Morrison CBE, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Inglis, who invented and organized flag days during the First World War. She was educated at the Park School for Girls, Glasgow, and briefly at Harvington College, London, and came from a family of writers: five out of the six Morrison children went on to have a career in some way connected to literature. Morrison herself began writing as a child and describes herself rising &#145;early in the morning to do it in secret&#146;, claiming &#145;as far back as I can remember I have had the wish, or urge, to write. It goes right back to my nursery days&#146;  (NL Scot., MS 27354, fol. 36).<br>
<br>Morrison's first novel, <span class="italic">Breakers</span>, notable for containing one of the earliest fictional depictions of the highland clearances, was published by John Murray in 1930, and she went on to publish nine more, as well as biographies of Mary queen of Scots, Henry VIII, the Bront&euml;s, and Thomas and Jane Carlyle. Between the years 1942 and 1959 she also published twenty-eight romantic novels under the pseudonym Christine Strathern. A lifelong and committed member of the Church of Scotland, many of Morrison's novels are set in manses or reflect church life, and some of her non-fiction, such as <span class="italic">The Keeper of Time: Stories of the Disciples</span> (1953) and <span class="italic">They Need No Candle: the Men who Built the Scottish Kirk</span> (1957), has a more overt Christian content.<br>
<br>During her own life Morrison's fiction met with much acclaim, being commended for its &#145;painting of Scottish scene and character&#146; and its blending of &#145;literary delicacy and terse, ironic realism&#146;  (NL Scot., MS 27373, fol. 27). <span class="italic">The Gowk Storm</span> was a Book Society choice when it was first published in 1933 and was later adapted for radio, stage, and film, and <span class="italic">The Winnowing Years</span> (1949) won the first Frederick Niven award. Her fiction also gained praise from her contemporaries, including Edwin and Willa Muir. Morrison's work was highly regarded in the United States where her last novel, <span class="italic">Thea</span> (1962), was published and where her biography of Mary queen of Scots received a Literary Guild award in 1961. Literary interest in Morrison's work began to revive in the late twentieth century, particularly in relation to her treatment of women.<br>
<br>Nancy Brysson Morrison never married and was an extremely private person, but it is clear that her family was of lifelong importance to her. For much of her life she lived with her sister Mary, first of all in Glasgow, and then from the sixties in Edinburgh. Later, she moved to Hampstead, London, to be near her brother Tom. This importance is reflected in literary correspondence, much of which, in particular from her eldest sister Peggy (who published romantic novels under the name March Cost), involves detailed commentary on drafts of her work along with suggestions and encouragement. &#145;Another advantage of all being writers&#146;, writes Morrison, &#145;is that we can discuss ideas, themes, and situations amongst ourselves&#146;  (NL Scot., MS 27354, fol. 41).<br>
<br>As a young woman Morrison enjoyed riding and walking, and, throughout her life, travel. She visited Italy and Switzerland in the thirties, and Sweden in 1946. She was also an active member of PEN, believing firmly in its principles of free speech and taking a strong interest in its debates after the Second World War.<br>
<br>After her death, Nancy Brysson Morrison's literary papers were deposited in the National Library of Scotland, and they show that in her working practices Morrison was both disciplined and methodical. Notebooks give evidence of meticulous research, along with ideas for themes, settings, and even words and phrases jotted down over a number of years. &#145;My brothers and sisters can write anywhere, in a room with other people talking,&#146; writes Morrison, &#145;but neither my sister Peggy nor I am like that. We have to have peace and quiet. That is why I have a small office in town, with no telephone, where I work and keep business hours&#146;  (NL Scot., MS 27354, fols. 38&#150;9). Nancy Brysson Morrison died of cancer in St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London, on 27 February 1986. Her ashes were taken north to be buried in her sister Mary's grave in Ballater, Deeside.<br>
