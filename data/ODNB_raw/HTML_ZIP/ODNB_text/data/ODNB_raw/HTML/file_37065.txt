</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Yonge,  Charlotte Mary</span>  (1823&#150;1901), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born at Otterbourne House, near Winchester, Hampshire, on 11 August 1823, the only daughter and eldest child of William Crawley Yonge (1795&#150;1854), magistrate, and Frances Mary Bargus (1795&#150;1868). Both parents were from clerical families. William's marriage was conditional upon his renouncing his career as a soldier and the Devonshire attachments of his upbringing to tend the Otterbourne estate bought by Frances's mother in 1819. Charlotte was educated at home, initially by her mother, &#145;on the Edgeworth system&#146;. Her father taught her classics and mathematics, and she helped to educate her brother, Julian (1830&#150;1892). A visiting tutor instructed her in French and Spanish, but music and art were neglected. Her father's belief in higher education for women accompanied by his conviction that their talents should be employed only under the guidance of a mature Christian male authority shaped his daughter's thinking: she remained emotionally dependent upon his approval. At the age of seven she was encouraged to teach in the village Sunday school her father had started, and taught both morning and afternoon sessions until a fortnight before her death. Less formal contacts with the villagers were not encouraged.<br>
<br>This cloistered upbringing developed Charlotte's deep veneration and imaginative yearning for the more extended family life she glimpsed during annual visits to &#145;cousinland&#146;, the network of Devon relatives. The imaginary life created for her family of sixteen dolls soon took written form in the <span class="italic">Ch&acirc;teau de Melville</span> (1838), begun two years earlier as a French exercise and sold at a bazaar for the benefit of the village school: her favourite form, the family saga, could be seen in embryo here, its characters surviving and developing to reappear in subsequent novels. The successive generations of her fictional heroes and heroines are constantly evaluated by their capacity to practise the Christian values of self-sacrificial love, obedience, humility, and submission within the demanding confines of domestic relationships.<br>
<br>The conservatism and respect for authority learned in Charlotte's earliest years, received a boost from the induction of John Keble to the adjacent living of Hursley in 1836. Although perceived as one of the leaders of the new Tractarian party, Keble had renounced academic life in Oxford for the pastoral concerns of a country living, and represented his part in the campaign for the recognition of the spiritual authority of the Church of England as merely a continuation of his own father's teaching of the high-church tradition. <i>Pro ecclesia Dei</i> became Charlotte's motto. Keble prepared Charlotte for her confirmation in 1838, the formative experience of her spiritual life  (<span class="italic">Musings</span>, 1871, iii), as her novel <span class="italic">The Castle Builders, or, The Deferred Confirmation</span> (1854), amply demonstrates. Keble, who distrusted all manifestations of self-aggrandizing cleverness or personal charisma, found an ideal pupil in the intensely reserved but precociously gifted Charlotte. The Kebles also introduced her to music and drawing. Keble became both her spiritual confessor and a rigorous editor of her manuscripts. His emphasis on reserve in communicating religious knowledge was to help her avoid the crude polemics of much contemporary religious fiction and his encouragement of her writing, as an instrument to be used in God's service, legitimated the creativity of a woman whose instincts and training might otherwise have led to its suppression. The complex tensions between temperament, conscience, and authority fed into the scrupulously moral agonizing that characterizes her fiction and can also be seen in her decision to discourage any biography in her own lifetime, on the grounds that &#145;her mother would not have liked such a thing to be done&#146;, while leaving Christabel Coleridge with the impression that she was being fed the information necessary to enlarge a truncated autobiography into a posthumous memoir  (Coleridge, viii).<br>
<br>Shortly after Keble's arrival, Charlotte Yonge's father embarked upon a programme of church building: St Matthew's, Otterbourne, was consecrated in 1839, a sister church at Ampfield provided in 1841, and Keble's church at Hursley replaced in 1847. The building and consecration of a new village church provided the theme for her first published novel, <span class="italic">Abbeychurch, or, Self Control and Self Conceit</span> (1844).<br>
<br>The family council which had acknowledged the propriety of Charlotte Yonge publishing this work simultaneously decreed that any profit should be donated to charity. She had already become an inveterate writer, recording daily incidents and discussing her work in progress with her correspondents. One friend, Marianne Dyson, twenty years her senior, elicited much of Charlotte's first educational writing for her village girls' school at Dogmersfield, near Winchester. Charlotte's contributions to Ann Mozley's <span class="italic">Magazine for the Young</span>, launched in 1842, were also directed at readers from the lower classes. The <span class="italic">Monthly Packet</span>, with Charlotte as its first editor and controlling influence, was aimed at wealthier private schoolrooms: over the years the younger relatives and friends, such as the young Mary Arnold (Mrs Humphry Ward), whose writing for privately circulated magazines she had encouraged, were invited to become contributors.<br>
<br>An unpublished story by Marianne Dyson provided the germ for Charlotte Yonge's greatest success: <span class="italic">The Heir of Redclyffe</span> (1853). During the tale's gestation it was discussed at length with her mother and friends and had its style honed by her father. J. W. Parker published the novel after its initial rejection by John Murray (who did not publish fiction). The work embodied Tractarian teaching through demonstrating the gradual success of religious discipline in transforming Guy Morville, a Byronic youth, into a saintly, domesticated, self-sacrificing hero. The young Pre-Raphaelites William Morris and Dante Gabriel Rossetti were inspired by this modern interpretation of knightly endeavour and Charlotte's brother Julian, who had joined the rifle brigade in 1852, found &#145;nearly all the young men in his regiment had a copy&#146;. The profits were donated to Bishop Selwyn of New Zealand to finance the <i>Southern Cross</i>, a new missionary schooner, for the Melanesian Islands. Ethel May, of <span class="italic">The Daisy Chain</span> (1856), and its sequel, <span class="italic">The Trial</span> (1864), offered a pattern for middle-class Christian girls: she has to renounce her masculine intellectual aspirations and learn to channel her energies into the more appropriate feminine roles of home-maker, and educator of the poor. Charlotte's thinking on gender was based on theological conviction: &#145;I have no hesitation in declaring my full belief in the inferiority of women, nor that she brought it upon herself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Womankind</span>, 1877, 1&#150;2). &pound;2000 of the profits from <span class="italic">The Daisy Chain</span> went to the building of St Andrews College, Kohimarama.<br>
<br>Julian Yonge, whose army career had been cut short by ill health, brought a wife, some ten years his junior, home to Otterbourne in 1858. By 1862 his family had expanded, so Charlotte and her mother moved to a neighbouring house, Elderfield. This period also witnessed new developments in her writing: <span class="italic">The Dove in the Eagle's Nest</span> (1866), a novel set in medieval Europe, was accompanied by other historical studies such as <span class="italic">The Book of Golden Deeds</span> (1864), <span class="italic">Biographies of Good Women</span> (1865), and her most intensively researched book: <span class="italic">The History of Christian Names</span> (1863).<br>
<br>In the aftermath of her mother's distressing death from &#145;softening of the brain&#146; Charlotte Yonge became an exterior sister of the Anglican educational order at Wantage, Berkshire, founded by the Revd William Butler, a former curate of Dogmersfield. Apart from a brief trip to Dublin in 1857, she had travelled very little, but in 1869 she went to Paris with her brother and his wife, and visited her translator, Mme de Witt, whose family lived with her father, the former prime minister Guizot, in Normandy. With her parents and Keble dead, and upon the retirement of Keble's long-serving curate, Charlotte had suddenly to confront a new authority in the village when a married clergyman, representing more recent Tractarian thinking, was appointed. These factors conspired to render <span class="italic">The Pillars of the House</span> (4 vols., 1873), the most concentrated expression of her own views: following the varied fortunes of the thirteen children of the Revd Edward Underwood, it also discusses such topical religious questions as the importance of fasting and confession.<br>
<br>Charlotte Yonge's interest in Tractarian missionary work made her the appropriate biographer when her cousin, John Coleridge Patteson, bishop of Melanesia, was murdered by South Sea islanders  (<span class="italic">Life of John Coleridge Patteson</span>, 2 vols., 1874). Missions in South Africa also interested her: she devoted the profits of a novel, <span class="italic">New Ground</span> (1868), to the Mackenzie mission set up to commemorate Charles Mackenzie, a Keble prot&eacute;g&eacute;, who died in the course of his proselytizing work as bishop of central Africa. The <span class="italic">Monthly Packet</span> was used to broadcast the needs of the missionary effort abroad and her novels broke an earlier literary mould by presenting missionaries as gentlemanly Christian heroes. The attitude her characters display to the work of the mission field is a further gauge of their virtue. In old age she extended her interests to the Far East and <span class="italic">The Making of a Missionary</span> (1900) employed the Boxer uprising to produce its climax. In September 1873 her brother's youngest sister-in-law, Gertrude Walter, a chronic rheumatic, moved from the big house to Elderfield, to become &#145;Char's wife&#146;, or secretary-companion, until Gertrude's death in 1897  (Coleridge, 270). This tie, combined with Charlotte's heart condition, further restricted her travel and range of visitors.<br>
<br>Charlotte Yonge was planning a substantial endowment for St Matthew's, Otterbourne, separated from the parish of Hursley in 1875, when, in 1876, a coal-mining speculation of her brother's failed and she was required to bail him out. When writing had been her vocation she had abstained from writing fiction during Lent: now it became her profession. Despite the sale of her early copyrights, Julian was forced to sell the family estate in 1885 and move to London, but a niece remained as wife of Henry Bowles, who was to become the new incumbent of Otterbourne in 1890. The year 1885 also saw the death of her close friend Bishop George Moberly, whose family she had known since 1835, when he came to Winchester College as headmaster. By the end of the decade she was persuaded to accept Christabel Coleridge as co-editor of the <span class="italic">Monthly Packet</span>: this did not prevent its publisher, A. D. Innes, from requesting her resignation in 1893, thus lending a bitter-sweet flavour to the seventieth birthday celebration the magazine's readers had planned for her. She devoted their gift of &pound;200 to a lich-gate for Otterbourne church. A further collection in 1899, the year in which the <span class="italic">Monthly Packet</span> folded, enabled her to found a scholarship at Winchester high school to send girls to Oxford or Cambridge.<br>
<br>Always adept at keeping several projects running concurrently, Charlotte Yonge wrote over 200 works of fiction and non-fiction, in addition to articles for her own and other magazines, making her the Tractarian movement's most important lay voice as well as its most comprehensive chronicler. She died of pleurisy, after a short illness, at Elderfield on 24 March 1901, and was buried on the 29th at the foot of John Keble's memorial cross in Otterbourne churchyard.<br>
