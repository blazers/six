<span class="headword">Arnot,  William</span>  (1808&#150;1875), <span class="occ">Free Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born at Scone on 6 November 1808, the seventh and youngest child of Robert Arnot (<i>b</i>. 1763), a tenant farmer, and his wife, Margaret Fisher; his mother died shortly after his birth. As a boy Arnot attended parish schools, while working in summer as a herder for his father; at the age of fourteen he was sent to a private academy in Perth. In November 1824 he was apprenticed to the gardener of James, sixth Baron Ruthven, at Freeland. The love of flowers and natural beauty which this experience provided remained throughout his life. However, influenced by the death of a religiously minded brother, he decided to train for the ministry; while still working as a gardener Arnot taught himself Latin and saved &pound;20 from his wages. After a year's tutoring in Latin and Greek from 1827 to 1828 he became a student at Glasgow University. His contemporaries included James Halley (<i>d</i>. 1842) and James Hamilton (1814&#150;1867), later minister in the National Scotch Church in Regent Square, London: both men became close friends, and later the subjects of memoirs by Arnot.<br>
<br>Arnot was licensed in October 1837 by the Glasgow presbytery, and served briefly as an assistant to the Revd John Bonar of the Larbert and Dunipace parishes. In 1838 he was called to be minister of St Peter's, Glasgow, one of the new churches erected by the Church Building Society under Chalmers's extension scheme. Arnot married Jane Fleming, daughter of John Fleming of Clairmont, on 30 July 1844. This happy marriage produced four daughters (of whom two died young) and two sons. Arnot would have preferred a country parish (at the Disruption he proved his commitment to the non-intrusionist position by refusing a presentation to the country parish of Ratho on the grounds of insufficient congregational support for the call). But he became a successful and committed city minister, continuing as the Free Church minister of St Peter's after the Disruption and declining moves to such varied destinations as Lerwick, Shetland, and the chair of theology at the Presbyterian college in London. During his ministry he oversaw the building of a new church and schools, started a Young Men's Society, supported local temperance associations, held social evenings, and regularly visited his parishioners.<br>
<br>A staunch evangelical (and a keen critic of Roman Catholicism and episcopacy), Arnot became associated with several nationwide evangelical causes. In his autobiography he vividly recalled his first hangover; this unpleasant event no doubt prompted his almost fanatical commitment to temperance, which resulting in him being viewed by other ministers as &#145;a kind of out-of-the-way enthusiast&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 305). A keen writer of tracts, he published <span class="italic">The drunkard's progress: being a panorama of the overland route from the station of Drouth to the general terminus in the Dead Sea</span>, a work which reflected his early fascination with <span class="italic">The Pilgrim's Progress</span>. Arnot was also interested in missions to young men: he was often invited to give lectures by young men's associations (he spoke frequently at Exeter Hall in London at the request of the YMCA), and was concerned about the many temptations to which young men in lodgings&#151;removed from their family environment&#151;were exposed. Many of his tracts&#151;including <span class="italic">The Race for Riches, and some of the Pits into which the Runners Fall</span> (1870)&#151;were intended for this audience. In addition to these interests Arnot was a keen member of the Evangelical Alliance, travelling as far afield as Germany, France, and Switzerland to attend meetings. He visited America three times: in 1845, as a supply minister for the new Free Church of Montreal; in 1870, as a delegate from the Free Church of Scotland; and in 1873, as a member of the Evangelical Alliance, to attend meetings in New York. In 1847 he was sent to Ireland by the general assembly to preach and to report on the condition of the people.<br>
<br>Arnot's appearance was striking: one contemporary picturesquely described him as a &#145;Scotch minister of buirdly make, shaggy, unkempt hair, and rugged but mirthful countenance&#146;  (M'Crie, 97). Unconventional, affectionate, and cheerful, his personality was an appealing one: he once wrote to his father that &#145;I love, in a greater or less degree, every person whom I know, and also all that I do not know; and this is the one great source of my happiness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 101&#150;2). Characteristically he twice refused honorary doctorates (offered by the University of Glasgow in 1860 and the University of New York in 1873), preferring &#145;my own simple designation&#146;  (ibid., 370).<br>
<br>In 1863 Arnot reluctantly accepted a call to the Free High Church in Edinburgh, where he spent the last twelve years of his life; from 1867 he edited a monthly magazine, the <span class="italic">Family Treasury</span>. He died on 3 June 1875 in Edinburgh and was buried in Grange cemetery. He left a lively autobiographical sketch of his early life, which was subsequently published with his letters by his daughter in 1877.<br>
