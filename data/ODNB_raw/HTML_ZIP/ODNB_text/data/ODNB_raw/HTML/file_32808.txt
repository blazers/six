<span class="headword">Dewrance, Sir  John</span>  (1858&#150;1937), <span class="occ">mechanical engineer</span>, was born at Peckham, London, on 13 March 1858, the only son of John Dewrance (<i>d</i>. 1861), railway pioneer, of Greenhills, Tilford, Surrey, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Joseph Curtis, of Tilford. He was educated at Charterhouse School and King's College, London, where he paid special attention to chemistry, and was a pupil of his stepfather, Colonel John Davis. On coming of age he took control of the engineering business of Dewrance &amp; Co., which had been left him by his father. This business was founded in London in 1835 by Joseph Woods, with the elder Dewrance as a partner. When Woods died in 1842 it became Dewrance &amp; Co., manufacturing engine and boiler accessories. In 1882 Dewrance married Isabella Ann (<i>d</i>. 1922), second daughter of Francis Trevithick, of Penzance, and granddaughter of Richard Trevithick, the &#145;father of the locomotive&#146;; they had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Dewrance had a great affection for scientific research, which he said was implanted in him by the electrometallurgist George Gore, and in 1880 he started a research laboratory, taking over Professor Frederick Barff's assistants and apparatus and working up his process for protecting iron from rust by treatment with superheated steam. In this laboratory he produced, in 1882, an ingot of aluminium by electrolysis, at a time when that metal was too expensive for general use, and he carried out extensive investigations, notably on lubrication and the corrosion of marine boilers, for which the Institution of Civil Engineers awarded him a Telford premium in 1896, and a Watt gold medal and a Telford premium in 1900. Some years before the First World War he gave up this laboratory, which by then had developed into a 2 acre factory with a pier on the Thames, and with it what he called individualistic research. His interest in research, however, continued, and hoping by team work to accomplish more for the benefit of industry than could be done by working alone, he became a member of many research committees, particularly those of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers on alloys and cutting tools, of both of which he was chairman. He encouraged co-ordinated research work, the standardization of engineering measurements, and mass production, believing this would best ensure the future prosperity of British industry.<br>
<br>Dewrance was a prolific inventor who took out more than a hundred patents, mainly relating to steam fittings and boiler mountings. He was also an able administrator and man of business. From 1899 until a few months before his death he was chairman of Babcock and Wilcox Ltd, and from 1914 of Kent Coal Concessions Ltd, and allied companies; aspersions cast by a shareholder on his conduct of these coal companies led him to take legal action, and in 1924 the offender was convicted of defamatory libel. In 1923 he was president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and from 1926 to 1928 of the Institute of Metals. He was also president of the Engineering and Allied Employers' National Federation (1920&#150;26), master of the Armourers' and Brasiers' Company (1923), high sheriff of Kent in 1925, and a fellow of King's College, London (1929). He was appointed KBE in 1920 and GBE in 1928. His recreations were riding, shooting, and deerstalking. He died at his home, Wretham Hall, Wayland, Thetford, Norfolk, on 7 October 1937.<br>
