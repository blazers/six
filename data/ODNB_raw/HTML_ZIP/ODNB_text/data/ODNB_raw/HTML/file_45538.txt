<span class="headword">Garnett,  William</span>  (1850&#150;1932), <span class="occ">physicist and educational administrator</span>, was born at 183 Queen Street, Portsea, on 30 December 1850, son of William Garnett, auctioneer, and his wife, Selina (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Webb). He was baptized at King Street Chapel in the following March. Four years later, the family moved to Hoxton, London. After attending a dame-school, and elementary schooling where his enthusiasm was aroused by demonstration lectures given by Lewis M. Stewart, science master at Charterhouse School, he attended City of London School. He became head boy in mathematics, his opposite number in classics being H. H. Asquith. Thereafter Garnett gained scholarships at the Royal School of Mines at South Kensington from 1867, and from 1869 at St John's College, Cambridge, where he supported himself while reading mathematics. He rowed, joined the rifle volunteers, and graduated fifth wrangler in 1873.<br>
<br>The following year Garnett began lecturing at evening classes. He became a fellow of his college and was invited by James Clerk Maxwell to become his demonstrator in the newly opened Cavendish Laboratory. Maxwell, whose biography Garnett later helped to write, became his beau ideal of a physicist and professor. Garnett took the keenest delight in choosing apparatus in conjunction with Maxwell, and in 1876 was appointed lecturer: he was thus Maxwell's right-hand man both in the laboratory and in the lecture theatre, where he made great use of the magic lantern. He published standard textbooks on various branches of physics. As college steward he attempted to reform the kitchens and the purchasing of food: meals at St John's became known as &#145;Garnett's sixpenny blowouts&#146;, but this experiment in scientific domestic administration was not altogether successful.<br>
<br>On 21 August 1879, at the Missionary College, Richmond, Surrey, Garnett married Rebecca Samways (1853&#150;1945) of Portsea, and therefore relinquished his fellowship. That winter Maxwell died: Garnett, who was grief-stricken, had high hopes of becoming the next Cavendish professor but Lord Rayleigh was appointed, and wanted no lecturer. Garnett needed a job and was appointed professor of physics, mathematics, and mechanics at the new University College established by the town council at Nottingham, in 1882. In 1884 he accepted an invitation to be principal of the Durham College of Science being established in Newcastle upon Tyne.<br>
<br>Garnett demanded proper buildings: the longer-established College of Medicine made difficulties about moving to the new site chosen by him; but a foundation stone was laid in 1887, and within six years three of the four planned blocks were completed. They form the nucleus of the campus of the University of Newcastle today. Garnett used the enthusiasm for Queen Victoria's golden jubilee to raise funds; his energy was indomitable, and he even assisted with the building works, as well as giving Christmas lectures to children. He secured one of the first government grants for university colleges in 1888. Newcastle's reputation stood high, and Garnett served on a scientific committee in London where he encountered T. H. Huxley, Lord Kelvin, Norman Lockyer, and Henry Roscoe.<br>
<br>In 1893 Garnett was chosen as secretary to the new technical education board of the London county council, under the chairmanship of Sidney Webb. Garnett became responsible for twelve London polytechnics, and played an important part in reorganizing the University of London. Altogether, 50,000 students, including those at art schools, came within his purview. Secondary education became at this time an area of contention between school boards and county councils, as various education acts (culminating in that of 1902) were debated in parliament. Garnett's influence and experience were very important in the eventual victory of the county councils, but his memorandum of 1903 to MPs was leaked to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, which weakened his position thereafter. After retiring in 1915 he chaired the Educational Reform Council in 1916&#150;17, and organized wartime courses for Britons interned in Switzerland. In 1919&#150;23 he was secretary of the London District University Committee, which placed over 7000 ex-servicemen on courses.<br>
<br>Garnett was affable and charming, alert and vigorous, and retained a firm Christian faith. He enjoyed alpine holidays, notably at Riffelalp above Zermatt. Himself the fruit of competitive scholarship examinations, he became a pioneer in scientific and technical education, at the Cavendish Laboratory, at new redbrick universities, and finally in London. Two of his sons were killed in the First World War; the eldest <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33333/', "(James Clerk) Maxwell Garnett")</script>, his wife, and his two daughters survived him when he died peacefully at his home, Horestone Point, Seagrove Bay, Isle of Wight, on 1 November 1932. He was buried at St Helen's Church on the Isle of Wight.<br>
