<span class="headword">Quaque <span class="st"> [Kweku]</span>,  Philip</span>  (1741&#150;1816), <span class="occ">first African Church of England clergyman and missionary</span>, was born at Cape Coast and named Kweku, the name to indicate born on Wednesdays. A Fante, he was reputedly the son, but more likely a remoter relative, of Cudjoe Caboceer, the intermediary between the local Fante and the African Company, which administered the British trading fort, Cape Coast Castle. In 1751 the London based Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG) sent a missionary to Cape Coast, Thomas Thompson, who in 1754 sent three Fante boys, William Cudjo, Thomas Caboro, and Quaque, to London to be educated. Cudjo died in 1758 but Caboro and Quaque were educated first at Mr Hickman's school, Islington, and Philip was baptized at Islington parish church on 7 January 1759. The two boys spent the next seven years there under the tuition of the Revd John Moore in Charterhouse Square (he is sometimes said, wrongly, to have studied at Oxford University). In 1765 he became the first African to be ordained a priest of the Church of England. The SPG then appointed him a missionary with a &pound;50 salary. Before leaving London he married, on 2 May 1765, an English wife, Catherine Blunt (<i>d</i>. 1766), and returned with her to Cape Coast in 1766.<br>
<br>Quaque was also appointed by the African Company chaplain at Cape Coast Castle with a &pound;60 salary, plus a &pound;13 allowance for his wife, who died soon after in November 1766. On arrival he wrote at once to the SPG committee in London with his news, and from then on regularly sent them detailed and lucid letters recording his views and activities. The society, however, took little interest in them and he received only three letters in return. In his first letter he lamented that all the company's employees, whose spiritual welfare he was responsible for, lived unmarried with African women. Moreover, over the succeeding fifty years of his ministry he was to find that most of them not only ignored the company's regulation that they attend prayers, but lived wholly unchristian lives. Many even refused to send their children to the school he opened for their use. Sometimes the governors were hostile: one openly ridiculed religion. But the company supported Quaque and eventually raised his salary to &pound;150. Though rarely more than half a dozen children, almost all Eurafricans, ever attended his school, he provided them with a basic, useful schooling (some became clerks in the company's service), and has thus been counted a pioneer of European education in Ghana.<br>
<br>Quaque's other role, as a missionary, was even less fruitful. During his years in London he had lost his fluency in Fante and found it difficult to explain the Christian gospel in what he called a &#145;vile jargon&#146;  (Priestley, 123n.). He performed a few baptisms, but made not one convert. None the less Quaque's status as a black African missionary to Africa gave him prominence in the SPG's annual reports, though references to him declined by the 1780s. He lived in the style of his European colleagues. To avoid the accusation that he was copying their morals (so he wrote to the SPG), after his wife died in November 1766 he married her Fante waiting maid in September 1769. When she died a few months later, in April 1770, he married another Fante woman, in March 1772. With his substantial salary he could afford to live in comfort, and so moved out of the dilapidated old fort and built himself a house in the adjoining town, with mahogany furniture and a library. From time to time he would visit the other trading forts along the coast and in 1784 he took his son and daughter to London to be educated. Quaque's teacher John Moore had died in 1768 but he maintained a close relationship with Moore's son, also John, who arranged for the education of his children. Quaque's latter years seem to have been unhappy. His last surviving letter, of 1811, reported severe ill health and included a long diatribe against the mistreatment of his wife and children by his extended African family. During his last five years he refrained from drawing his SPG salary and when he died at Cape Coast Castle on 17 October 1816 there was a balance of &pound;369 which, with another &pound;100, he had bequeathed to his successor as missionary. But as he too had died by the time the SPG received the news, the money was sent to Quaque's heirs. Quaque, who was buried at Cape Coast Castle, seems to have taken no part in local political affairs, nor, unsurprisingly, given that he was the employee of a company principally concerned with the slave trade, any part in the campaign to abolish it. However, Quaque's correspondence also makes clear that he regarded the trade as a bulwark against the progress of his mission, saying in 1771 to Edward Bass, SPG missionary to Newburyport, Massachusetts, that of &#145;the many Obstacles &amp; Difficulties&#146; the principal was &#145;the horrid Slave Trade&#146; (Glasson, 45). It was an opinion Quaque had expressed before to Samuel Johnson, SPG missionary and later president of King's College, New York, and would continue to develop to Bass and others during the 1770s and 1780s.<br>
