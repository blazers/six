<span class="headword">March,  John</span>  (1611/12?&#150;1657), <span class="occ">barrister and legal writer</span>, came from obscure origins and little can be ascertained of his family background. He appears to have been the same John March of St Stephen Walbrook, scrivener, who married Alice Matthews of St Nicholas Olave in spring 1638 at the age of twenty-six. Recent scholarship has challenged the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>'s contention that March was the second son of Sam March of Finchampstead, Berkshire, on grounds that that John March died unmarried and childless. He was possibly the John March admitted to the degree of BCL at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, on 27 November 1632, and probably the &#145;John Marche, St. Andrew Holborn London&#146; who entered Barnard's Inn on 15 April 1635  (Brooks, 86) and continued his studies at Gray's Inn, where he was admitted on 18 March 1636 and called to the bar on 11 June 1641 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>.<br>
<br>In 1642 March rose to prominence when he published a defence of the Long Parliament's militia ordinance entitled <span class="italic">An argument or, debate in law: of the great question concerning the militia; as it is now settled by ordinance of both the houses of parliament</span>. In this tract March argued that, although power to proclaim war and peace and hence control over the militia ordinarily lay with the king, in time of &#145;imminent danger&#146; to the kingdom and &#145;extream necessity&#146; the two houses of parliament could lawfully put the militia in a posture of defence without the king's authority  (J. March, <span class="italic">Argument</span>, 1642, 5&#150;7). This tract has sometimes been attributed to John Milton although Thomason's copy is clearly marked &#145;J. Marsh&#146;. In March 1644 he was in the employ of the committee of both kingdoms at Darby House and in 1647 he published <span class="italic">Actions for slaunder, or, A methodicall collection under certain grounds and heads, of what words are actionable in the law, and what not?</span> A second, augmented, edition of this work appeared the following year along with a set of printed reports entitled <span class="italic">Reports, or new cases; with divers resolutions and judgements given upon solemn arguments, and with great deliberation</span>.<br>
<br>At the end of August 1649 the Commonwealth dispatched March to Guernsey as one of four commissioners for the ordering and settling of its affairs there. March also made an important contribution to the debate on law reform during the Commonwealth and protectorate. He represented, along with fellow barristers William Sheppard and Sir Matthew Hale, a branch of the interregnum law reform movement that advocated reform from within the existing structures of the common law. He is best known for his <span class="italic">Amicus republicae, the Commonwealth's friend, or, An exact and speedie course to justice and right, and for preventing and determining of tedious law-suits</span> (1651; Thomason's copy is dated May). This work, dedicated to the lord president of the council of state, John Bradshaw, was probably an attempt to influence the deliberations of the Hale commission on law reform. March held that although the core of the common law remained pure, over the centuries both procedural and substantive corruptions of it had crept into the administration of justice. He likened the common law to a tree that would grow better &#145;for the pruning, and cutting off of its exuberant and unnecessary branches&#146;  (<span class="italic">Amicus</span>, preface). In practical terms he advocated an end to benefit of clergy, the abolition of the death penalty for petty theft, the right to legal representation in capital cases, the end of imprisonment for debt, the legitimization of bastards by the subsequent marriage of the parents, and an end to <i>peine forte et dure</i>&#151;the practice of &#145;pressing to death&#146; in instances where the accused refused to enter a plea. He argued more generally that punishments should be proportional to the crime committed. More controversially he called for a fusion of common law and equity on grounds that it would provide uniformity of procedure in all courts and minimize jurisdictional rivalries. Around this time he also published a translation (from law French), <span class="italic">Some new cases of the years and time of King Hen. 8 Edw. 6 and Qu: Mary; written out of the great abridgement, composed by Sir Robert Brook, knight</span> (1651).<br>
<br>Following the defeat of Scottish and royalist armies in 1652 March travelled to Scotland on the orders of the council of state. There he served until 1653 as one of a commission of four Englishmen and three Scots charged with the administration of justice. About this time he was also one of a commission of nine charged with regulating the church and universities. He appears to have returned to London by 1656, when he served the trustees for the sale of crown lands at Worcester House. He died early in 1657 after &#145;a long and expensive sickness&#146; in a state so impoverished that his widow, Alice, on 5 February 1657 petitioned Lord Protector Cromwell for assistance in her husband's burial  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1656&#150;7</i>, 264). The council subsequently ordered payment of &pound;20 &#145;For her relief&#146;  (ibid., 592). His surviving family also included two small children, one of whom may have been the Elizabeth March of Richmond, Surrey, who married James Howseman of St Margaret's, Westminster, on 20 January 1668, aged about eighteen. Another John Marsh, whose identity remains uncertain, matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, during Easter term 1631.<br>
