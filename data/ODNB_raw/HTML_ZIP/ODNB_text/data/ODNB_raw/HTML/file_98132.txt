<span class="headword">Tooth,  Mary</span>  (1778&#150;1843), <span class="occ">Methodist preacher</span>, was born on 30 May 1778 in St Mary's Row, Moseley, Worcestershire. She was one of nine children, but only Mary and her two sisters, Rosamund and Elizabeth, survived into adulthood. Her parents, about whom little is known except her mother's maiden name (Whittaker) and date of death (1803), were not religious and the Christian influence in her early life came from her grandparents. Tooth's connection with the parish of Madeley in Shropshire and the influential Methodist preacher Mary Fletcher (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Bosanquet), wife of the Revd John Fletcher, began in December 1795. She was offered a job in Madeley at a school run by Mrs Micklewright, whom she met through friends of her mother. In July 1796 she joined the local Methodist society and &#145;found here a people with whom I wish to live and die&#146;  (journal, B, 95). Recalling some years later the effect of Mary Fletcher's preaching, she noted &#145;my soul felt her words distill as dew upon the mow'd grass&#146;  (ibid., 49). Tooth remained at the school for two years, before moving to Birmingham, where she attended St Mary's Church and Cherry Street Chapel. Mrs Micklewright's son had proposed marriage and Tooth did not feel able to accept, so her sister Rosamund was sent to take her place at the school. Tooth left home once more in March 1798 to work at Miss Luton's school in Shifnal. From here she visited Madeley to worship at the weekends, establishing a close friendship with Mary Fletcher and her spiritual prot&eacute;g&eacute;e Sarah (Sally) Lawrence, before moving to Madeley permanently about October 1799. Tooth noted in her journal, &#145;I was but once parted for a day &amp; night from my beloved Mrs Fletcher for more than 15 years that I resided with her&#146;  (ibid., 11). As Mary Fletcher's health declined, Tooth took on more responsibilities in the parish, acting as a class leader and preacher.<br>
<br>Following Mary Fletcher's death in 1815, Tooth protected and perpetuated the spiritual legacy of John and Mary Fletcher. As Fletcher's executrix, Tooth followed her instructions to pass her spiritual autobiography to John Wesley's biographer Henry Moore. Fletcher's autobiography was spliced together with entries from her spiritual diary and the work was published in 1817, going through twenty editions in the first fifty years  (Brown, 109). Tooth also composed a &#145;Letter to the inhabitants of Madeley on the death of Mary Fletcher&#146;, published by Zachariah Taft in 1825. In this public letter she recalled her response to Fletcher's death: &#145;I clung to the casket of the saint, knelt down by the side of it, and cried to him who had just now called home the spirit of my friend, that the mantle might rest on me&#146;  (Taft, 1.35). Tooth enthusiastically took up the &#145;mantle&#146;, acting as a spiritual mentor to the children and grandchildren of those who first found God through the class leadership of Mary Fletcher. She left the vicarage and moved into a nearby house in May 1816, transferring the communion table from the church at Madeley and the clock from Fletcher's vicarage barn to her own upper room reserved for public meetings  (journal, N, 6 Oct 1841).<br>
<br>Tooth was in an unorthodox position, continuing her work into the 1840s despite the Methodist conference's prohibitions against women preachers from 1803. She also considered herself a member of the Church of England (notwithstanding Methodism's secession from the established church in 1795). She established Madeley as a site of pilgrimage and many Methodists were eager to connect themselves with a parish that had played a central role in the formation and proliferation of their faith. Tooth was the custodian who dispensed and displayed relics, such as Mary Fletcher's handkerchief and John Fletcher's <span class="roman">Bible</span>. She presented this role as an extension of her ministry: &#145;none come to see me who do not profess respect for the name of <i>Fletcher</i> they live yea they live forever &amp; their works do follow them&#146;  (journal, M, 1 April 1839).<br>
<br>Tooth remained highly active into her sixties&#151;attending missionary, temperance, and sewing meetings, visiting the sick, and collecting for the poor. By the end of her life poor health meant that she was no longer able to travel, but she led three weekly classes of nearly eighty members in her home up until her death on 15 November 1843. Tooth's status as an anomaly within nineteenth-century Methodism and her connection to a former era are evident in her obituary in the <span class="italic">Wesleyan-Methodist Magazine</span> (1843):<blockquote>though Miss Tooth's habits and modes of acting were in many respects very peculiar, yet the evident piety she possessed, and the circumstance of her having stood in such a relation to Mrs. Fletcher &hellip; caused her to acquire great influence; and her loss will be extensively felt.</blockquote>Her unpublished journal, which sporadically covers the period 1799 to 1842, provides a rare example of the persistence of eighteenth-century Methodist practices throughout the first half of the nineteenth century.<br>
