<span class="headword">Corbet, Sir  John</span>, first baronet  (<em>bap. </em>1594, <em>d.</em> 1662), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was baptized on 20 May 1594 at Stoke upon Tern, Shropshire, the second son of Richard Corbet (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1602) of Stoke upon Tern and his wife, Anne, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3513/', "Sir Thomas Bromley")</script>, lord chancellor from 1579 to 1587. He may have been the John Corbet recorded as graduating BA at Cambridge in 1612 and he was a student at Lincoln's Inn in 1615. The date of his knighthood is not recorded, but he was made a baronet on 19 September 1627. He was a justice of the peace in Shropshire during the 1620s and 1630s. Corbet's family had been a significant presence in the shire since the mid-sixteenth century when his grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6291/', "Reynold Corbet")</script> acquired the estates at Stoke and Adderley by marriage to Alice Gratewood, coheir to Sir Rowland Hill. John Corbet succeeded his elder brother, Richard, about 1618 and established his principal residence at Adderley. In 1620 he married Ann (<i>d</i>. 1682), daughter of Sir George Mainwaring of Ightfield, Shropshire: they would have ten sons and ten daughters.<br>
<br>Corbet's main claim to fame was his involvement in two celebrated local disputes during the 1630s. The first of these was a quarrel over honour and precedence with his near neighbour, Robert Needham, second Viscount Kilmorey, of Shavington. Disputes had arisen with Kilmorey's father over rentals, rights of way, and whether the Needhams were entitled to set up seats in the chancel of the parish church at Adderley where Corbet owned the rectory. Corbet was able to obstruct the elder Kilmorey's efforts to have a chapel consecrated for his use at Shavington, and when both received titles in 1627 he contested his claim to local precedence by insisting that &#145;an English Baronet was as good as an Irish Viscount&#146;. However, the second viscount used his contacts at court to turn the tables when he succeeded his father in November 1631. Suits in king's bench and the court of arches secured his right of way across Corbet's estate and enabled him to go ahead with consecrating his chapel. Corbet attempted to retaliate in 1633 by having one of his servants, an Irish footboy, buried in the chancel at Adderley, immediately adjacent to the tomb of the first viscount. Kilmorey regarded this as a deliberate attempt to bring &#145;great scandall and disrepute&#146; on &#145;his name and familie&#146;  (Harrod) and immediately appealed to the earl marshal's court where he secured an order to remove the footboy's body. He then pressed home his advantage by obtaining a licence from Archbishop Laud to build his own family chapel adjacent to the chancel at Adderley. Corbet was apparently beaten on all fronts, but the dispute rumbled on and in March 1642 led to an armed affray as Lady Corbet used her servants to deny Kilmorey and his family access to the chapel. The quarrel was finally subsumed in the events of the civil war in which Corbet and Kilmorey took opposite sides.<br>
<br>The second dispute was over the more public issue of the crown's right to raise fees to pay the muster-master, responsible for training the county militia. At a quarter sessions held at Shrewsbury on 7 April 1635 the grand jury presented these as &#145;a great grievance and oppression&#146;. Timothy Tourneur, esquire, one of the justices and steward to the county's lord lieutenant, the earl of Bridgewater, immediately rebuked the jury for meddling in matters which did not concern them, whereupon Corbet called for the statute book, asked the clerk of the court to read out the section referring to the petition of right, and attacked Tourneur for trying to prevent the grand jury from carrying out its duty. Corbet's intervention apparently had the support of most of the justices present but the matter was reported to Bridgewater, a privy councillor. Corbet was summoned to London and required to answer for &#145;making speeches to his Majesties disservice and the animating of others to refuse the payment of the muster master's fee&#146;  (Cope). He apparently refused to back down and on 10 June was imprisoned and bound over to appear for trial in Star Chamber. The trial never took place, but he remained in the Fleet prison for six months and was removed from the commission of the peace. He took his revenge in February 1641 when he petitioned against Bridgewater's proceedings in the Long Parliament. In June the Commons declared that imposing the fee for the muster-master was contrary to the petition of right, that Corbet's arrest had been illegal, and that he should receive reparation. In September the Lords took order to proceed with the impeachment, although they did not go through with it.<br>
<br>Corbet's return as knight of the shire for Shropshire in the Long Parliament was probably a result of the reputation he earned for standing up for the liberties of the subject; but although he sat right through until 1648, when he was one of the members secluded at Pride's Purge, he made little impact on proceedings. In February 1642 he was one of the MPs chosen to conduct negotiations with the king over the militia ordinance and in March he presented a petition from Shropshire before the Commons. At the local level he was nominated as one of the leaders of the parliamentary committee for Shropshire in June 1642 and later on as colonel-general of the forces to be raised there. During July and August he was active in the county attempting to execute the militia ordinance but after this he returned to London, where he appears to have remained for much of the war. He has been identified as working during 1643&#150;5 with &#145;the middle group&#146; in the Commons and in religious terms he was a presbyterian, being listed as one of the elders for Shropshire. After his seclusion from parliament in December 1648 he took little further role in public affairs. He died in June 1662 and was buried in the chancel of the parish church at Market Drayton, Shropshire. His widow died on 29 October 1682.<br>
