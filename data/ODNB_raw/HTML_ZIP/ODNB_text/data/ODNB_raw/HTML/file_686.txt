</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Arnold,  Thomas</span>  (1795&#150;1842), <span class="occ">headmaster and historian</span>, was born on 13 June 1795 at West Cowes, Isle of Wight, the seventh of the seven children of William Arnold (1745&#150;1801), collector of customs and postmaster for the Isle of Wight, and his wife, Martha (1751&#150;1829), daughter of John Delafield. She became postmaster after her husband's death. Thomas had two brothers and four sisters.<h2>
<a name="Childhoodandschool17951811"></a>Childhood and school, 1795&#150;1811</h2>A bright, lively boy, Arnold spent a happy childhood on the island during the exciting times of the Napoleonic wars; the daily sight of ships and their flags, sailors, and soldiers, and all the bustle of a port in wartime fostered in Arnold a keen interest in historical and contemporary events and gave him &#145;an instinctive acquaintance with geography&#146;  (Whitridge, 5). He was very fond of reading, particularly history books, and his early education was entrusted to his aunt, Susan Delafield, until 1803, when he followed his brother Matthew to Warminster School in Wiltshire, a flourishing establishment with high academic standards, where he remained for four years. Arnold thrived at Warminster: he was popular with his fellows and thoroughly enjoyed cricket, fives, and mock battles on the downs. His literary sense continued to develop. He liked books of every type; historical works, in particular, figured largely in his private reading, though he relished novels and light fiction as well. He had an extremely retentive memory and had made steady, but not spectacular, progress in reading the classics by the time of his removal to Winchester College in 1807, a move largely necessitated by the family's difficult financial circumstances and the fact that Warminster possessed no scholarships to the universities.<br>
<br>Sound early training, combined with Arnold's own hard work and determination to succeed academically, produced a swift rise at Winchester, where his knowledge and love of classical literature deepened. Homer, Thucydides, Livy, and Tacitus were his especial favourites. Three of the most intimate friends of his life were with him at the school: J. Tucker, F. C. Blackstone, and T. T. Penrose. Though studious, the young Arnold was certainly not of a shy and retiring disposition; in most respects he was a typical boy whose exuberance and youthful high spirits frequently broke out in all manner of pursuits and escapades. Physically he was a little above average height: lean, healthy, and active, though not robust, with dark hair, prominent eyebrows, and a slightly projecting lower lip. His voice was rather flat and his usual expression somewhat severe&#151;his features visibly clouded when he became angry.<br>
<br>As well as continuing to enjoy history and poetry, Arnold began to develop an interest in politics, though his opinions were in constant flux and his views rapidly fluctuated from toryism to radicalism and back again. He took both his work and his play seriously, and he left the school in possession of characteristics which were to become features of the mature man: resolution, tenacity, vigour, boisterousness, and a streak of impatience.<h2>
<a name="University18111819"></a>University, 1811&#150;1819</h2>In 1811 Arnold won a scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where the system of teaching was thorough and the tone high. There he became acquainted with John Keble and met perhaps his greatest friend, J. T. Coleridge. Though he disliked early rising, Arnold worked hard, particularly on his favourite Greek and Roman historians and Aristotle. He also learned French. Equally, he led a very full social life and was a frequent speaker in the Attic Debating Society, the forerunner of the Oxford Union. He swam and rowed regularly and developed a fondness for &#145;skirmishes&#146;&#151;long, cross-country expeditions. Although the cast of his mind always tended to the concrete rather than the abstract, he became a fervent admirer of the Lake poets and was an unsuccessful competitor for the university Latin and English verse prizes in 1812 and 1813 respectively. There was nothing distinctive about his religious opinions at this time and his political views continued to fluctuate. Fun-loving, good-natured, keen to develop his intellect, and with an abundance of friends, he obtained a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in May 1814, and was elected to a fellowship at Oriel College in 1815, a landmark in his life. For the next five years he read widely and experienced the stimulating company of some of the keenest intellects in the university, the Oriel <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/45620', "Noetics")</script>: Edward Copleston, Richard Whately, Renn Dickson Hampden, Edward Hawkins, and John Keble. In 1815 Arnold won the chancellor's prize for the English essay, and in 1817, when he graduated MA, also won the Latin essay prize. During these years he supplemented his income by extensive private tuition of undergraduates, which he thoroughly enjoyed.<br>
<br>Arnold underwent a severe crisis of religious doubt at this time. He had been ordained deacon in 1818 while privately disbelieving the damnatory clauses of the Athanasian creed, and further study led him into doubts about the nature of the persons of the Trinity. These doubts had been only partially resolved in 1826, by which time he held other objections to points in the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>. For nine years these kept him from a curacy and priest's orders and caused much disquiet to those around him; as he later admitted, &#145;I know &hellip; it was said in Oxford that I did not preach the gospel&#146;  (Stanley, 75). Since his conscience would not allow him to take priest's orders, and since he wished to marry, an income derived from teaching was the natural consequence of his historical interests. In 1819 he therefore went into partnership with his brother-in-law John Buckland in a private school at Laleham, a village beside the Thames in Middlesex.<h2>
<a name="LifeatLaleham18191828"></a>Life at Laleham, 1819&#150;1828</h2>Arnold lived at Laleham with his mother, aunt, invalid sister, and his wife, Mary Penrose (1791&#150;1873) (the sister of his boyhood friend, T. T. Penrose), whom he married on 11 August 1820. In 1824 he and Buckland amicably dissolved their partnership, with Arnold taking charge of the older boys, whom he had been teaching exclusively since 1821. The partners had decided that a distinct division between the older and younger boys was in the school's best interests, and Arnold certainly found the company of the older pupils more congenial. As well as being their teacher, Arnold endeavoured to get to know the boys in his house as individuals, and to make them part of his family. He exercised with them and derived genuine pleasure from the youthful society of boys &#145;all alive in limbs and spirits&#146;  (Stanley, 27). During this period he also continued to read extensively and learned German for the purpose of studying the historian Niebuhr, whose work on Roman history profoundly influenced him. With a growing family and a large establishment to maintain he was financially hard-pressed throughout these years and he embarked on several literary schemes to generate income. The most significant of these was a series of articles on Roman history written during 1823&#150;7 for the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia metropolitana</span>; the articles were reprinted in two volumes with a <span class="italic">Life of Trajan</span> in 1845.<br>
<br>Financial considerations also played a very large part in Arnold's decision to leave Laleham. In 1826 he had reluctantly declined the vice-principalship of St Alban Hall, Oxford, and in 1827 withdrew his strong candidacy for the professorship of modern history at London University only when he learned of his appointment as headmaster of Rugby School. Although not insensible to visions of extended influence, he chose the Rugby position because it provided more money. He was appointed without interview, and it is known that the Rugby trustees placed great emphasis on the testimonial from Edward Hawkins predicting that Arnold had the power to &#145;change the face of education all through the public schools of England&#146;  (Stanley, 42). Arnold had at first hesitated to apply for the headmastership for two reasons: first, he doubted whether the trustees would allow him a completely free hand&#151;for he meant to make frequent use of expulsion; and, second, his refusal to proceed to priest's orders because of his misgivings over the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> meant that he could not administer communion in the school chapel, which he wished to do. However, he received private assurances on the former point and, on the bishop of London's advice, he subscribed the articles as &#145;only articles of peace&#146;  (Whitridge, 50). He was ordained priest and proceeded BD and DD in 1828.<h2>
<a name="ImprovingeducationalstandardsatRugby"></a>Improving educational standards at Rugby</h2>When Arnold took over the headmastership Rugby School was suffering from a general decline which was widespread in public schools at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Low moral standards, harsh discipline, and ossified teaching methods had shaken public confidence in them. Arnold proved himself a natural leader and, by the force of his ideals and personality, reinvigorated the school's systems. He quickly replaced the boarding-houses for pupils run by women in Rugby (known as &#145;dames' houses&#146;) with boarding facilities run by tutors from the school, and thereby emphasized the role of the housemaster. By raising the status of his assistant masters, who he insisted should relinquish any church livings they held so that they could devote themselves entirely to the school, and by taking them into partnership with him&#151;salaries were increased, and regular staff meetings held at which frank speech was encouraged&#151;he won their loyalty. He required his staff to be gentlemen, in holy orders, of first-rate ability, with enquiring minds, and to be constantly increasing their own knowledge. He implemented no major curriculum reforms but ensured that modern languages and mathematics were properly and regularly taught; moreover he instituted termly examinations and regular pupil reports to the parents. Games, other than for the purpose of recreation, held little interest for him; he did not promote organized sport, but simply watched the boys' matches from time to time. The headmaster's independence in the daily running of the school he regarded as supremely important; the governors recognized this and his relations with them were usually harmonious.<br>
<br>The classics remained at the centre of the curriculum, as Arnold regarded the Greek and Latin languages as &#145;given for the very purpose of forming the human mind in youth&#146;  (Stanley, 105). As a purely verbal scholar he was not first class, though his translations into English were clear and vigorous. Rather than asking his pupils for a mere literal &#145;construe&#146;, he insisted that the boys try to reproduce the nuances of meaning and the style of an author in good idiomatic English, for &#145;every lesson in Greek and Latin may and ought to be made a lesson in English&#146;  (Whitridge, 103). His method of teaching was Socratic, designed to stimulate a boy's intellect by asking questions which would lead to a solution rather than simply require an answer. Because he believed in the relevance of the classics and history to contemporary life&#151;&#145;if history has no truths to teach, its facts are little worth&#146;  (Stanley, 577)&#151;he interpreted them widely, constantly drawing parallels between subjects and eras and raising general questions of literary, historical, and moral import. His evident enthusiasm and freshness revitalized traditional subjects and he possessed the ability to inspire boys to take an interest in them. Arnold's inclination was always towards &#145;things rather than words&#146;; content rather than form. His constant aim was to give pupils the power to obtain knowledge and think for themselves, rather than to supply them with mere facts, and he was humble enough to admit his own ignorance on certain points.<h2>
<a name="RaisingRugbysmoraltone"></a>Raising Rugby's moral tone</h2>At the heart of all Arnold did was an unswerving faith in the divinity of Christ and a personal devotion to him as his saviour, which influenced all his conduct. For Arnold every aspect of life was a battleground between good and evil and, since he regarded Christianity as indispensable to all forms of human endeavour, his chief educational aim was to make Rugby a Christian school producing Christian gentlemen. The cultivation of the intellect was not his prime concern, rather the creation of a Christian character. He looked for &#145;1st, religious and moral principles; 2ndly, gentlemanly conduct; 3rdly, intellectual ability&#146;  (Stanley, 95). Theodore Walrond, in his <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> article, captured this aspect of Arnold graphically:<blockquote>the central truth of life to him, not as a dogma accepted from without, but as the satisfaction of a craving within, was the union of the divine and the human in the person of Jesus Christ; to speak of a Christian's body as the temple of the Holy Spirit was hardly a metaphor; the church and the state were one; the natural and the supernatural, things secular and religious, were inextricably blended; every act of a Christian's life was at once secular as done on this earth, and religious as done in the presence of God; and every act was of importance, as affecting the great struggle everywhere and at all times going on between good and evil.</blockquote>Arnold's religious hopes for the school centred on its chapel (he became chaplain in 1831) and found expression in his weekly Sunday sermons. Speaking solemnly and earnestly in plain language on practical matters to which the boys could relate, he made clear his expectations of them and the moral and religious lessons he wished to teach. The general effect was striking, and many were genuinely moved by his deep and sincere faith and the impression he created there.<br>
<br>Central to Arnold's plans for the school was the great confidence he placed in the sixth form, his prefects, whom he regarded as partners in his quest to raise the school's moral tone. The deep trust he placed in them as symbols of moral and academic integrity, and the power he gave them over their fellows in everyday matters of discipline were things new in the public school world. As intermediaries between the staff and pupils he hoped that they would curb the worst excesses of the boys and lead by example. He maintained his confidence and optimism in their ability to carry out this role despite disappointments, and many of them became devoted to him. Equally important was his regular practice of removing boys he felt were not benefiting the school or themselves. By public expulsion for the worst behaviour, or the quiet removal of boys lacking intellectual curiosity, he sought to keep the pupil body &#145;healthy&#146;. Though frank and gentlemanly in his dealings with the pupils and expecting honesty in return, the dominance of his personality, his naturally stern and reserved manner, his quickness to anger, and his desire to speed &#145;the change from childhood to manhood&#146; left most boys in awe of &#145;Black Arnold&#146;. His difficulty in empathizing with adolescent boys who were not thoughtful and dutiful exacerbated his instinct to see sin and evil in their midst, while the strain of the moral responsibility he imposed on his prefects proved too much for some of them, who were forced into premature maturity. Most of his sixth formers, however, greatly respected and praised him, and after leaving school the best Rugby boys were acknowledged to be thoughtful, mature, and conscious of duty and obligation. Although he never eradicated such things as drunkenness and bullying from the school&#151;even from School House itself&#151;and although the daily social life of the average boy probably changed little, nevertheless Arnold's untiring and restless energy, hatred of evil, devotion to duty, and ability to inspire enthusiasm helped substantially to improve the school's tone.<h2>
<a name="Controversyandconflict"></a>Controversy and conflict</h2>The beneficial effects of Arnold's personality on the school were not instantaneous; it took time for boys and masters to embrace his initiatives; moreover, the governors were uneasy about his outspoken political and religious writings on topics of the day. His views polarized opinion, and numbers at the school fell for most of the 1830s until the tide turned in his favour. In Arnold a psychological necessity to write&#151;&#145;I must write or I shall burst&#146;  (Whitridge, 182)&#151;was combined with a keen interest in national affairs and indignation at unjust conditions. His views were grounded in his Christian beliefs, which would allow him neither to tolerate social injustice nor to separate religion from politics. Reform became his watchword, with the union of church and state as his ideal. Because he wrote from a heart filled with moral certainty, his language was forthright and often intemperate. In 1829 he argued for Catholic emancipation in his pamphlet <span class="italic">On the Christian Duty of Conceding the Roman Catholic Claims</span>. He thereby offended the political sensibilities of the liberals and, by asserting that most of the clergy were incompetent judges of history, scandalized both them and the tories. In 1831, alarmed at the growing divide between the educated and working classes and fearing violence, he co-edited with his nephew John Ward a newspaper, the <span class="italic">Englishman's Register</span>, rather to &#145;relieve my conscience&#146; than from any expectation of success. Arguing for the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, he endeavoured to Christianize liberals and tories alike in the hope of engendering mutual respect and sympathy between them in the cause of social justice. After nine issues and a (predetermined) &pound;200 loss, the paper closed, though he continued to analyse the country's social and economic problems during 1831&#150;2 in thirteen letters on &#145;the social condition of the operative classes&#146; written to the <span class="italic">Sheffield Courant</span> newspaper. His pamphlet <span class="italic">Principles of Church Reform</span> in 1833 strongly advocated wider religious inclusion to counter the dangers of disestablishment. For the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> in April 1836 he wrote &#145;The Oxford malignants&#146;, a scathing denunciation of the methods of the Tractarians in opposing the appointment of Hampden as regius professor of divinity.<br>
<br>The tory press nationally and locally vilified Arnold for such writings: he was accused of teaching revolution, neglecting the school, and being unfit to govern boys. His friends disapproved of his engaging publicly in controversy, and the school governors were concerned about the effect his writings might have on the school. Following Arnold's refusal to acknowledge a governor's right to question him on the authorship of the Hampden article, the governors divided equally on a motion of censure moved by Earl Howe. Had it passed, Arnold might well have resigned. Behind all the disquiet was the feeling that a headmaster should not be so engaged. Arnold's position was unequivocal: he insisted that it was his inalienable right as a private citizen to express himself freely on such matters: &#145;I claim a full right to use my own discretion in writing upon any subject I choose&#146;  (Stanley, 196).<h2>
<a name="LifebeyondRugby"></a>Life beyond Rugby</h2>Very often lonely and embattled during these years&#151;in 1838 Arnold had regretfully resigned his fellowship at London University because its senate would not include a compulsory divinity examination for the BA degree&#151;he found solace in his family, holidays, and writings. Of simple tastes and habits, his industry was untiring. He showed little interest in art, science, and music (he was tone deaf), but was an indefatigable writer of numerous neat and lengthy letters to a wide range of correspondents. Though not witty, he had an eye for the absurd. In character essentially boisterous, intense in all he did, and ever conscious of the reality of sin, his moral certitude and earnestness made compromise impossible as he daily strained to do what was right.<br>
<br>Arnold's marriage was ideally happy, and his devoted wife was a constant support and help in all he did. Their daily recreational walk together, she on a pony, was a feature of their routine, as was her careful recording of the family's activities (even conversations) in a series of notebooks. They had eleven children (two daughters died shortly after birth): Jane (who married W. E. Forster), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/679/', "Matthew Arnold")</script> (the poet), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/687/', "Thomas Arnold")</script> (literary scholar), Mary, Edward (school inspector), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/690/', "William Arnold")</script> (director of public education in the Punjab), Susanna, Frances, and Walter. Arnold was never happier than with his children and, though stern and serious when necessary and ever mindful of the true purpose of life, he participated enthusiastically in all their activities both at Rugby and at Fox How, the house he had built in 1833 near Grasmere in the Lake District. There the mountains and beautiful countryside refreshed him physically and spiritually. All aspects of nature delighted him and his diaries contain many pressed flowers collected in the long rambles he regularly undertook with his family. Fox How he regarded as his true home; the Warwickshire countryside was flat and dull in comparison with the Lakes, where another attraction was the firm friendship he developed with the poet William Wordsworth. Regular touring at home and abroad was another feature of his life. Between 1815 and 1842 he travelled to the continent on twelve occasions, minutely detailing a country's topography and its associations in his journals. While visiting Rome in 1827 he made one of his greatest friendships, with Baron von Bunsen, Prussian ambassador to the papal court, with whom he found almost perfect moral and intellectual sympathy. From these tours he returned refreshed and mentally stimulated; as he said, &#145;a man is only fit to teach so long as he is himself learning daily&#146;  (Stanley, 473).<br>
<br>Intellectual stimulus and distraction from his worries were also provided by Arnold's historical studies. In 1838 the first volume of his <span class="italic">History of Rome</span> was published (vol. 2, 1840; vol. 3, 1843, posthumously). The work was incomplete at his death and covers the early history of Rome to the end of the second Punic War. Written in a clear and vigorous style and enlivened by his personal topographical knowledge, his account of the early period, particularly, was influenced by Niebuhr's critical methodology. Arnold's aim was a history that &#145;by its high morals and its general tone [would] be of use to the cause&#146; (that is, Christianity)  (Stanley, 162). Essentially a school text, the book was popular and sold well. His three-volume edition of Thucydides (1830&#150;35) also went through several editions, and was chiefly significant for its emphasis on historical and geographical interpretation and its comparisons between ancient and modern events.<br>
<br>From the end of the 1830s Arnold's situation was improved through a combination of circumstances: the good reception given to his historical works; the fact that he had not written to the newspapers in the years 1832&#150;7; the increase in numbers at the school from 1838 and the scholarships won at the universities; and the events following the publication of Newman's <span class="roman">Tract 90</span> in 1841, which tended to vindicate Arnold's view of the Romanizing tendency of the Tractarian movement. Finally, in 1841 he was appointed regius professor of modern history at Oxford, where both he and his lectures were received with great acclaim; his inaugural lecture was a notable statement of the concept of national biographical history. In the midst of this success, however, Arnold died suddenly at Rugby, from angina pectoris (the cause also of his father's death), on 12 June 1842. He was buried in the school chapel.<h2>
<a name="Arnoldswritings"></a>Arnold's writings</h2>Arnold's main published works, in addition to those mentioned above, are: <span class="italic">Sermons</span> in five volumes (1829&#150;42; revised and reprinted in six volumes, 1878); <span class="italic">Introductory Lectures on Modern History</span> (1842); and <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works</span> (1845), collected by A. P. Stanley, who wrote the highly influential <span class="italic">Life and Correspondence of Thomas Arnold</span> (2 vols., 1844).<br>
<br>The intellectual basis for Arnold's writings was his composite theory of universal history, derived essentially from a synthesis of the views of Aristotle, Thucydides, Giovanni Battista Vico, and Niebuhr, which could be applied practically to society and its problems. This science and philosophy of history, combined with an unshakeable belief in divine revelation, furnished him with principles which influenced his religious, political, and social theories and, indeed, informed his life. For Arnold history was a divine process, and the stages of a nation's life were cyclically determined, following laws of natural historical development. History, therefore, was ruled by law. It could thus be used analogically, and viewed philosophically rather than chronologically; it also taught moral lessons. Impartiality was impossible for a Christian historian.<br>
<br>The consequences of this theory are reflected in Arnold's political, social, and theological writings, and reveal why he found &#145;no party to own him&#146;. Because he regarded the law as sacrosanct, revolution was anathema to him. While he understood unbridled toryism as simply a passing phase in a nation's development, radical socialism, with its emphasis on materialism, was not part of the traditional historical cycle. He believed that the natural destiny of a nation was democratic government, and the hallmark of a citizen the practice of Christianity. Because the <span class="roman">Bible</span> was rooted in history, it had to be examined in the light of history; moral and intellectual enlightenment were therefore necessary in order to learn right behaviour. Moreover, history showed that church and state were linked and should not be separated. It also revealed that the priesthood, apostolical succession, and the growth of religious sects were distinctly unhistorical and non-scriptural phenomena.<br>
<br>Arnold, so often branded by his critics as a &#145;liberal&#146;, actually accepted no one political party. His views&#151;embracing respect for the establishment, anti-sacerdotalism, and a belief in religious comprehensiveness much in advance of his time&#151;not surprisingly provoked a strong reaction. The lasting influence of his writings was not great owing to three aspects of his work. First, his philosophy of history, on which they were based, was intellectually in advance of the ideas of most of his contemporaries. Second, as the nineteenth century advanced, ever-increasing material progress and the spread of utilitarianism appeared to contradict his historical interpretation of the cyclical nature of society. Third, his ideal of church unity was shattered by the growth of sectarianism.<h2>
<a name="TheArnoldlegend"></a>The Arnold legend</h2>Following his death Arnold was seen as the headmaster who had brought Rugby School from brutality and intellectual decline to civilization and academic excellence, and he swiftly acquired the reputation of being not only the great reformer of the public schools but also the founder of the modern public-school system. This legend grew for a number of reasons: the drama of his sudden death and the impact of his personality on an admiring staff, many of whom, along with former pupils, themselves became headmasters motivated by his principles; the testimonies to his character and abilities paid at the universities by his former pupils; the general public interest in him that resulted from A. P. Stanley's biography, which did so much to perpetuate his memory and establish his reputation; and the immense popularity of Thomas Hughes's novel <span class="italic">Tom Brown's Schooldays</span> (1857). Even the emergence of rugby football kept the school's name, and therefore Arnold's, in the public mind. In addition to this general reputation as a school reformer, he became particularly identified with the role of the prefect and the growth of organized games in schools. However, twentieth-century reappraisals of his life, particularly after the 1950s, put this legend into perspective. They pointed out that he did not single-handedly change the face of education in the public schools and that, in his own day, he was best known for his writings on non-educational matters. They also revealed that the poor moral condition of the school he inherited has often been exaggerated and that examples of indiscipline continued throughout his time there, that he was essentially conservative in his approach to change at the school, and that his few curriculum reforms had been anticipated elsewhere. There is no doubt that the later widening of the curriculum and the growth of the games cult were not due to his influence; even the prefect system he developed was derived from Winchester College. Certainly there were teachers elsewhere endeavouring to make Christianity a reality in the everyday life of a school. Finally they pointed out that his ideas on theological and social change were soon forgotten.<br>
<br>Equally, these reappraisals established Arnold's lasting educational achievements. He established the principle of headmagisterial independence, restored confidence in the public school system generally, and confirmed Rugby's position as one of the leading schools. His ideas were spread by his pupils and assistants, and he was undoubtedly a source of inspiration to others in the field of education. The enduring verdict of posterity confirms the magnitude of his personality, vision, intellectual ability, and Christian idealism.<br>
