<span class="headword">Blackstone,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1596?, <em>d.</em> 1675), <span class="occ">settler in America and horticulturist</span>, was born to unknown parents. It has been asserted that he was baptized on 5 March 1595 at Whickham in co. Durham, the son of John Blackstone and his wife, Agnes (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Hawley), but there is no entry to this effect in the parish register. A William Blackstone was baptized on 5 March 1596 at Horncastle, Lincolnshire, son of parents of these names. He was admitted a sizar at the puritan-dominated Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 16 May 1614, and graduated BA early in 1618. Ordained deacon and priest at Peterborough on 23 May 1619, he proceeded MA in 1621.<br>
<br>Soon afterwards dislike of episcopacy, as he later explained, took him to New England. He probably sailed with Robert Gorges in the ship which landed at Wessagusset (later Weymouth) in Massachusetts Bay. The Gorges settlement soon melted away, and Blackstone moved to Shawmut (later Boston), where he had occasional contact with other isolated Englishmen and with Native Americans. For four years from 1630 he co-existed in Boston with the new settlers who arrived with John Winthrop, but his house was on the opposite side of Boston Neck from the main settlement. In 1634 the town of Boston purchased Blackstone's estate, and he moved, probably with servants, to Study Hill, just north of the site where two years later Roger Williams established Providence, and in an area later known as Blackstone River.<br>
<br>For the next forty years Blackstone remained at this spot and had little communion with the outside world, although he occasionally visited Williams, and on 4 July 1659 in Boston he married 34-year-old Sarah (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Fisher), widow of John Stevenson, a cobbler who had left her with five children. He officiated at the first recorded prayer book service in Rhode Island, and sometimes preached there. At one point he received an invitation to become minister at York. However, he declined to take up a pastorate. Cotton Mather, who noted that he was &#145;commonly reckoned&#146; among godly episcopalians, recounted that he was a man &#145;of a particular humor, and he would never join himself to any of our churches, giving this reason for it: &#147;I came from England, because I did not like the <i>lord-bishops</i>; but I can't join you, because I would not be under the <i>lord-brethren</i>&#148;&#146;  (Mather, 243). Instead he farmed and cultivated roses and apple trees, breeding the first new strain of apples in the colony, yellow sweetings.<br>
<br>Sarah Blackstone died in June 1673 and Blackstone himself on 26 May 1675, aged about eighty. The inventory of his moveable estate totalled &pound;56 3<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., with an additional three parcels of land not valued, amounting to more than 260 acres. His library of nearly two hundred books, one of the largest in New England at the time, accounted for close to a third of his moveables. A marginal annotation in the inventory states that &#145;this estate was destroyed and carried away by the Indians&#146;: this probably occurred during King Philip's War, which broke out on 20 June that year in Plymouth County, just a few miles away.<br>
<br>Many myths grew up around this man, the so-called &#145;sage of the wilderness&#146;, who deliberately withdrew from society. Tales were told of him travelling round the locality mounted on a white bull, with his nose in a book. Honoured by the protestant episcopal church as a pioneer episcopal clergyman in America and as the first resident of Boston, he features on the Founders' Memorial on Boston Common and at other sites. His pastureland later became North America's first public park.<br>
