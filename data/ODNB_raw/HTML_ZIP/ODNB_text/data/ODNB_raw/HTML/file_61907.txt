<span class="headword">Wynne,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1692, <em>d.</em> 1765), <span class="occ">lawyer and author</span>, was baptized at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 7 July 1692, the youngest of the five children, and heir, of Owen Wynne (1651&#150;1700) and his wife, Dorothy (1659&#150;1724), daughter of Francis Luttrell and sister of the political chronicler <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17226/', "Narcissus Luttrell")</script>. His father was warden of the Royal Mint during the reign of James II, and under-secretary of state to Charles II and James II. Wynne matriculated at Jesus College, Oxford, on 23 January 1709, graduated BA on 14 October 1712 and MA on 24 May 1723. He was admitted to the Middle Temple on 12 December 1712, called to the bar on 23 May 1718, and created serjeant-at-law in 1736.<br>
<br>Wynne benefited greatly in his legal career from his family's ecclesiastical connections. On his father's death the bishop of Bangor promised to assist his children; and he was also a relative of John Wynne, bishop of St Asaph. In 1723, only five years after being called to the bar, he was already senior enough to be retained, along with Sir Constantine Phipps, in the trial of Francis Atterbury, bishop of Rochester, for high treason. Wynne skilfully exposed the weakness of the evidence produced for the prosecution in that case.<br>
<br>On 30 September 1728 Wynne married Grace (1700&#150;1779), the daughter of William Bridges, a serjeant-at-law. The couple had six sons and two daughters. Wynne's father-in-law was close to successive bishops of Hereford, and in subsequent years Wynne was &#145;the trusted adviser of some of the leaders of the Church while he continued to be employed generally in matters of an ecclesiastical nature&#146;  (Lemmings, 116). He appeared for the Bathurst family in a case about tithes in 1735&#150;6 and in the 1740s he gave advice to Edmund Gibson, bishop of London, concerning the marriage articles of the latter's daughter.<br>
<br>In 1746 Wynne appeared with a Mr Clayton for the defence in the trial for high treason of Francis Towneley, who had commanded the Manchester regiment in the Jacobite rising of 1745. Towneley was convicted and executed, the court having rejected Wynne's argument that since Towneley held a commission from Louis XV he owed no allegiance to George II. Wynne's literary gifts were displayed in his <span class="italic">Observations Touching the Dignity and Antiquity of the Degree of Serjeant at Law</span> (1756). This book was written to defend the privileges of the serjeants when their exclusive rights of audience before the court of common pleas were threatened. He also wrote <span class="italic">The Life of Sir Leoline Jenkins</span> (1724) for which he drew upon family papers.<br>
<br>Wynne died on 16 May 1765 and was buried in the north cloister of Westminster Abbey on 23 May 1765. His wife survived him. Of his sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30157/', "Edward Wynne (bap. 1734, d. 1784)")</script>, was a barrister and author, and Luttrell (1738&#150;1814), was a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford.<br>
