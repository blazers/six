<span class="headword">Danvers,  Frederick Charles</span>  (1833&#150;1906), <span class="occ">civil servant and writer on engineering</span>, was born on 1 July 1833 in Hornsey, London, the second son of Frederick Samuel Danvers, an officer in the East India Company, and his wife, Mary Matilda, daughter of H. Middleton of Wanstead, Essex. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London (1843&#150;6), at King's College, London, and at Addiscombe College, near Croydon; he then studied civil and mechanical engineering for two years. In January 1853 he joined the clerical establishment at East India House. When the India Office was created in 1858 he was made, in September of that year, a junior clerk in its public and ecclesiastical department. The following year he was sent to Liverpool and Manchester to report on the fitness of traction engines for use in India. His technical knowledge led in 1861 to his transfer to the public works department. He became a senior clerk in June 1867 and an assistant secretary in February 1875. On 17 October 1860 he married, at the parish church in Hove, Louisa (1837&#150;1909), daughter of Elias Mocatta. They had three sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>In 1868 Danvers's proposals for a tunnel under the Hooghly River to solve the problem of taking the East India Railway from Howrah into Calcutta were forwarded by Sir Stafford Northcote. Danvers became a busy writer on technical, statistical, and economic matters, chiefly with respect to India, contributing articles on public works to <span class="italic">Engineering</span>, 1866 to 1875, and an article to Spon's <span class="italic">Information for Colonial Engineers</span>, in 1877. He compiled memoranda on India's coal 1867&#150;9, and the parliamentary paper &#145;Statistical papers relating to India&#146; (1869); he wrote <span class="italic">Coal Economy</span> (1872) and <span class="italic">A Century of Famines, 1770&#150;1870</span> (1877).<br>
<br>Danvers was an original associate of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, for which he acted as honorary auditor from its foundation in 1872 until his death. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Statistical Society in 1880, later serving on its council (1893&#150;1905). One of the two papers he read to it was &#145;A review of Indian statistics&#146; in 1901. He was also elected a member of the Society of Arts in 1890, subsequently sitting on its Indian section committee. He read three papers to the society, for two of which he was awarded its silver medal: &#145;Agriculture in India&#146; (1878) and &#145;The India Office papers&#146; (1889). The third paper, in 1886, was &#145;Famines in India&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1877 Danvers transferred, still as an assistant secretary, to the revenue department. In January 1884 he became registrar and superintendent of records to the India Office. His appointment effected greater efficiency in this area which, partly in anticipation of the fourth centenary of Vasco da Gama's first voyage to western India, led to his being sent to Lisbon in 1891&#150;2 to study records of Portuguese rule in the east. His report was published in 1892, followed by <span class="italic">The Portuguese in India &hellip; a History of the Rise and Decline of their Eastern Empire</span> (2 vols., 1894). Although referred to as his <i>magnum opus</i>, S. E. Fryer deemed it to be &#145;marred by want of perspective [with] incomplete reference to authorities&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He was made knight commander of the royal military order of Jesus Christ of Portugal. Danvers similarly studied records in the state archives in The Hague (1893&#150;5). His subsequent report was eventually published in 1945 as &#145;Dutch activities in the east&#146;. He retired from the India Office in July 1898.<br>
<br>In 1877 Danvers wrote <span class="italic">The covenant, or, Jacob's heritage, being an examination into circumstances connected with ancient Israel, with England, and with other leading nations</span>. His last work was <span class="italic">&#145;Israel Redivivus&#146;, being a History of the Tribes of Israel</span> (1905). Other late works included <span class="italic">Map of the World, Commonly Known as &#145;the Second Borgian Map&#146;</span> (1889) and a contribution to <span class="italic">Memorials of Old Haileybury College</span> (1894) entitled &#145;An account of the origin of the East India Company's service and of their college in Hertfordshire&#146;. He also wrote the introduction to several works on records of the East India Company.<br>
<br>Danvers died of pneumonia on 17 May 1906 at Broad Oaks, Addlestone, Surrey; he was buried at All Saints' Church, Benhilton, near Sutton, Surrey. His wife died in Sutton on 29 May 1909 and was buried beside him.<br>
