<span class="headword">Fitzgerald, Sir  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1540&#150;1582), <span class="occ">rebel and landowner</span>, was the second legitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9560/', "James fitz John Fitzgerald, thirteenth earl of Desmond (d. 1558)")</script>, and More or Maud (<i>d</i>. 1548), daughter of Sir Mulroney MacShane O'Carroll, lord of Ely O'Carroll. Fitzgerald spent his formative years learning the intricacies of local politics and warfare with his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9556/', "Gerald Fitzgerald, later fourteenth earl of Desmond")</script>. Their father, recognizing the dangers of absenteeism, ignored suggestions that would have seen his sons raised at court. Gerald Fitzgerald's aggressive and unpredictable personality, however, rekindled hostilities with their traditional rivals for hegemony in Munster, the Butlers. By summer 1560 Fitzgerald had emerged as principal ally in the conflict of his brother, now earl of Desmond, spoiling Butler lands and participating in negotiations at Waterford. Thomas Butler, tenth earl of Ormond, and Desmond were ultimately summoned to court to resolve the matter and Fitzgerald was left in what would become a familiar role, <i>de facto</i> Geraldine leader in Munster.<br>
<br>Fitzgerald mounted frequent attacks on Butler lands during Desmond's absence and established a reputation as a resourceful leader. The conflict worsened following Desmond's release in early 1564; by December 1565 Ormond insisted that any resolution of the dispute must include placing Fitzgerald under direct supervision by the Irish government. Fitzgerald, however, maintained his independence thanks to a powerful pro-Geraldine faction in Dublin and at court, which considered him a more sensible leader than his mercurial brother. Yet while Sir John Cusack pointed to his talents and loyalty, he was in secret correspondence with Shane O'Neill, the crown's formidable adversary in Ulster. In a letter written to Fitzgerald, O'Neill exhorted him, &#145;nowe is the tyme or neyver to set against them [the English] as well as youe can, or God will revenge the same upon youe if youe do the contrary&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/19/7). He was not incited into rebellion, however, and recognized instead the opportunity created by Desmond's contumacious dealings with the new lord deputy, Sir Henry Sidney.<br>
<br>In March 1567 Desmond was arrested and Sidney bestowed a knighthood upon Fitzgerald, whom he appointed governor of Cork, Limerick, and Kerry. Yet Elizabeth I found Sidney's actions unacceptable and rescinded Fitzgerald's appointment. Fitzgerald was lured to Dublin where he was arrested on 12 December; within days Desmond and he were sent to England and committed to the Tower. The brothers were detained until spring 1573 and during their absence <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9562/', "James fitz Maurice Fitzgerald")</script>, their cousin and captain-general, instigated persistent rebellion in Munster. Sidney later noted, &#145;this harde dealing with Sir John of Desmond was the origyne of James fitz Maurice's rebellion, and consequently of all the evill and mischief in Munster&#146;  (&#145;Sir Henry Sidney's Memoir&#146;, 3.95). The queen came under pressure from Irish officials to grant Fitzgerald's release so that he might be employed against fitz Maurice. Though it was recommended by Sir John Perrot, president of Munster, that Desmond remain in England, she refused to enlarge Fitzgerald, her hesitation coloured by the earl's history of recalcitrance. Thus Fitzgerald sought to distance himself from his brother, making separate submission and offering his services against the rebels. Elizabeth relented in early 1573, but ordered the release of both Fitzgerald and Desmond following the former's pledge to fight the rebels and the latter's signing of articles for his future good conduct.<br>
<br>Upon their arrival Desmond was rearrested by Dublin officials unconvinced of his peaceful intentions. Fitzgerald, however, was permitted to return home in May after agreeing to certain concessions rejected by Desmond. His return, though undermining fitz Maurice's authority, did not end the rebellion, as rumours of Desmond's detention fuelled resentment. The earl's escape in November and his defiant posturing lent the rebellion renewed impetus. To end hostilities the government changed tack and sought Desmond's rehabilitation within a Tudor presidential framework in Munster. Fitzgerald remained Desmond's principal ally but was consigned to a subordinate role; his less capable brother overshadowed him. Years of imprisonment and rebellion, moreover, had left his lands in ruin; Tudor composition, in which Desmond acquiesced, would cause their value to plummet still further. Fitzgerald thus sought allies in unlikely quarters: in 1577 he dabbled in Connaught politics, proposing marriage to Mary, daughter of Richard Burke, second earl of Clanricarde, despite being already wed to Ellen, daughter of Sir Tadhg MacCarthy, lord of Muskerry. The foray resulted in his brief imprisonment for complicity to revolt. Finally a dispute with Desmond in early 1579 left him disgruntled and susceptible to fitz Maurice's rebellious overtures.<br>
<br>Fitzgerald made common cause with fitz Maurice in July. Desmond tried to contain the rebellion but his brother outmanoeuvred him, murdering Henry Davells and Arthur Carter, special envoys to Desmond, in their beds on 1 August. The lurid act placed Desmond's leadership under serious strain. It also allowed Fitzgerald to assume the rebel leadership after fitz Maurice's death on 18 August. He made a formidable military opponent, but lost his only son, Thomas Fitzgerald, in a skirmish at Enabeg, co. Limerick. His leadership, however, was typically short-lived. Government pressure forced Desmond into outright rebellion and he was proclaimed a traitor on 2 November.<br>
<br>The rising in July 1580 of James Eustace, third Viscount Baltinglass, in Leinster breathed life into Desmond's faltering rebellion and provided Fitzgerald with an independent theatre of operation. He liaised with Baltinglass and his Gaelic allies in the Wicklow mountains but was unable to surmount personal and geographic differences to form a united front. In early January 1582 Fitzgerald, <i>en route</i> for a conference with his confederate David Barry, was surprised and killed in the woods of Eatharlach, near Castlelyons, co. Cork, by John Zouche, governor of Munster. His corpse was sent to Cork and &#145;hanged in chaynes over the citty gates, where it hanged up for 3 or foure yeares together as a spectacle to all the Beholders to looke on&#146;  (Hayman, 391). An experienced leader, Fitzgerald did not rush impetuously into rebellion. Rather it was a calculated, if desperate, attempt to destroy an emerging political situation of composition and plantation in which he had no future. He left an only daughter, Ellen, married to Donald MacCarthy.<br>
