<span class="headword">Hickmott,  Harold Edward</span>  (1881&#150;1947), <span class="occ">motor bus operator</span>, was born on 8 May 1881 at Marden, Moorgate Grove, Rotherham, Yorkshire, the son of Edward Hickmott, master grocer, and his wife, Rebecca, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dawes. Nothing else is known about his early life; but Hickmott trained as an engineer at the Vickers naval dockyard, Barrow in Furness, before moving to Brighton to join the management of Southdown Motor Services, in the fledgeling motor omnibus industry. During the First World War, Hickmott served in the Royal Flying Corps, becoming a major, a rank he was unwilling to relinquish during his subsequent civilian career.<br>
<br>Hickmott left the forces in 1919, hoping to make a big splash in the passenger transport business. With the assistance of two friends from Yorkshire, Hickmott acquired James Hodson's suburban bus service in Preston, Lancashire, and founded Ribble Motor Services Ltd in June 1919, a company with an initial capital of &pound;20,000. Britain stood on the brink of a bus mania. New bus routes spilled out from the towns into the countryside, where buses competed with the railways, while in urban areas private bus operators sought to challenge the municipal tramways. British Automobile Traction, an offshoot of the country's largest private sector tramways company, British Electric Traction, purchased Ribble in 1920. Hickmott could afford to be satisfied with this new arrangement as he retained managerial control. He was managing director of Ribble from 1920 until 1944, and finally retired from the board in 1946.<br>
<br>As a subsidiary of British Automobile Traction, Ribble could draw upon a large reservoir of capital, providing the company with a significant advantage over most of its neighbours. Commanding forces befitting a general, Major Hickmott surveyed the map of north-west England, and planned his attack. Hickmott's victims among the region's small bus firms were offered fair terms, but those who resisted being taken over faced a ruinous fare-cutting war. These tactics did not work against stronger rivals, such as the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), and the corporation transport departments, such as Liverpool, Wigan, and Preston, whose networks had a degree of legal protection. Hickmott entered into collusive agreements with LMS and the corporations, and in the 1930s he was a staunch advocate of co-ordination between road and rail services, and private and public sector transport undertakings. One of Hickmott's greatest coups was a market sharing agreement, commencing in 1931, between the railways, municipal tramways, and major bus companies on Merseyside. Ribble's territory in the 1930s stretched from Liverpool to Carlisle, and the company became Britain's largest operator of express coach services. In 1939 Ribble owned 1055 vehicles, and its issued capital was &pound;1,400,000.<br>
<br>Hickmott was called Hicky by those not required to call him major. In a photograph taken in 1939 he comes across as square-jawed, tight-lipped, and bespectacled; keeping a firm grip on his drink, he exudes a steely determination. Another photograph shows him sporting a military moustache, and staring piercingly, but not coldly, into the camera (his eyes were blue). The managing director of Crosville Motor Services described Hickmott in his prime as a &#145;large cockerel scratching vigorously in the bran&#146;  (Crosland-Taylor, 282), and later in life as an elderly viking. Hickmott was regarded with respect and affection by his equals. Less is known about the attitude of his inferiors, although Ribble had a reputation as a paternalistic employer. Ribble was a disciplined, but overly bureaucratic, organization in Hickmott's day. The senior staff corridor at head office in Preston was known as the quarterdeck, and loyalty was rewarded more liberally than efficiency, as was the norm in transport undertakings.<br>
<br>Determination and good fortune were the twin secrets of Hickmott's rise to fame in the world of the omnibus. Following its takeover by British Automobile Traction, Ribble's destiny was virtually assured. At the very least, however, Hickmott had the ability to make the most of a winning hand, and his contemporaries believed him to be one of the sharpest thinkers in the passenger transport industry. Hickmott retired to the Sherwood House Hotel, Newton St Cyres, Devon, where, following a stroke, he died on 19 August 1947. He was buried in Newton St Cyres.<br>
