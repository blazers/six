<span class="headword">Youl, Sir  James Arndell</span>  (1811&#150;1904), <span class="occ">pisciculturist</span>, born at Parramatta, New South Wales, on 28 December 1811, was the son of John Youl (1773&#150;1827), a Church of England clergyman, and his wife, Jane Loder (<i>d</i>. 1877). As a child he accompanied his parents to Van Diemen's Land, his father having been appointed in 1819 military chaplain at Port Dalrymple and first incumbent of St John's, Launceston. James was sent to England to be educated at a private school near Romford, Essex. After returning to Van Diemen's Land he took up residence at Symmons Plains, which he inherited on the death of his father in March 1827. There he became a successful agriculturist and in 1837 county magistrate. On 9 July 1839, at Clarendon, he married Eliza, the daughter of William Cox, an army officer and settler in Australia. She died on 4 January 1881, leaving four sons and eight daughters.<br>
<br>In 1854 Youl returned to England to live permanently, at Clapham Park, London. He interested himself in Tasmanian and Australian affairs. From 1861 to 1863 he was honorary agent in London for Tasmania, and for seven years was honorary secretary and treasurer of the Australian Association. In that capacity he was instrumental in improving the mail service to Australia and getting the Australian sovereign made legal tender throughout the British dominions. He was acting agent-general for Tasmania in 1888, and was one of the founders in 1868 of the Colonial Society, later the Royal Colonial Institute, and took an active part in its management until his death.<br>
<br>But it is with the introduction of salmon and trout into the rivers of Tasmania and New Zealand that Youl's name is mainly associated. After many failures he at length discovered an effective method of packing the ova so that they survived a sea voyage of more than 100 days. In 1864 the first successful shipment to Tasmania was made, and for several years afterwards Youl was engaged with others in sending out shipments to Tasmania and Victoria, and, after 1868, to New Zealand. In 1866 he was awarded the gold medal of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'Acclimatation and in 1868 the medal of the Acclimatization Society of Victoria. In 1874 he was made CMG and in 1891 KCMG. On 30 September 1882 he married Charlotte, the widow of William Robinson of Caldecott House, Clapham Park, and the younger daughter of Richard Williams of Philipville, Belgium. Youl died on 5 June 1904 of senile decay and bronchitis at his residence, Waratah House, King's Road, Clapham Park, London, and was buried in Norwood cemetery. He was survived by his wife.<br>
