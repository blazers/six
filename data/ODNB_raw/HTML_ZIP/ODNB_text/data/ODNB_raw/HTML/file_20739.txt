<span class="headword">Ollier,  Charles</span>  (1788&#150;1859), <span class="occ">publisher, writer, and editor</span>, was born on 4 May 1788 in the parish of St James, Bath, the second among the five or six sons of Charles Ollier (1746/7&#150;1827), a haberdasher and registrar at Bath General Hospital, and Sarah Tuttell (1757/8&#150;1829), a milliner and haberdasher. It is thought that he was descended from a French protestant family which migrated to England at the time of the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685. <br>
<br>At fourteen Ollier moved from Bath to London and became a junior clerk in a banking house, and by 1810 he was employed by Coutts's Bank. In 1812 he was indentured to Philip Drake, a notary public and scrivener, and as late as 1816 he worked for the banks of Alexander Davison and of Coutts. During these early years in London he was drawn to literary, theatrical, and musical circles. In 1810 he wrote his first letter to and theatrical criticism for Leigh Hunt's <span class="italic">Examiner</span>. As a good friend of Hunt and, by 1812, of Charles Cowden Clarke, he became acquainted with others in the arts, including the Novellos, Henry Robertson (later treasurer of Covent Garden Theatre), the painter William Havell, and the four or five musical and theatrical brothers Gattie (including Henry and John Thomas Byng). Ollier was an accomplished flautist who played at Novello and Hunt musical evenings and at annual celebrations of Shakespeare's birthday. <br>
<br>On 13 May 1814, while living at Devonshire Place, Marylebone, London, Ollier married Maria Gattie (1786&#150;1878); they had six children. His second son, Charles (1821&#150;1906), co-founded the booking and opera agency of Lacon and Ollier with George Lacon. His fourth and youngest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20740/', "Edmund Ollier (1826&#150;1886)")</script>, attained some fame as a journalist and historian. <br>
<br>Between 1817 and 1823 Charles Ollier engaged in business with his younger brother James (1795/6&#150;1851) as a publisher, retail bookseller, stationer, and owner of a circulating library, first at 3 Welbeck Street, Cavendish Square, and then, after May 1818, at Vere Street, Bond Street. The first two publications with an imprint C. and J. Ollier were John Keats's <span class="italic">Poems</span> and Percy B. Shelley's <span class="italic">Proposal for Putting Reform to the Vote throughout the Kingdom</span>, both appearing early in March 1817, and both apparently published by commission on the author's own account (that is, an author would pay the printing and advertising costs). Keats soon became dissatisfied with the Olliers, to whom his brother George wrote a letter of complaint less than eight weeks after publication. In their defence of the poor sales, the Olliers (who had advertised the volume in London and Bath newspapers) responded on 29 April that many who had purchased the volume &#145;found fault with it&#146; and were offered their money back: one customer actually considered <span class="italic">Poems</span> &#145;no better than a take in&#146;. Most of the remaining copies of <span class="italic">Poems</span> were then transferred to Taylor and Hessey, who continued to sell the volume as late as 1824. On the other hand, Shelley continued to publish almost all his works with the Olliers, notwithstanding poor sales and other problems. In December 1817, for example, Charles Ollier wanted to withdraw from publishing Shelley's epic <span class="italic">Laon and Cythna</span> when customers complained of the incest and anti-Christian expressions therein. After Shelley reluctantly agreed to remove or alter the offending passages, the epic was republished as <span class="italic">The Revolt of Islam</span> in January 1818. Between 1820 and his death in July 1822 Shelley frequently complained that Charles Ollier was ignoring his many requests and commissions  (Robinson, 187&#150;8, 190&#150;92, 199&#150;206). <br>
<br>The fifty titles that the Olliers published in 1817&#150;23 also included Charles Lamb's <span class="italic">Works</span>, William Hazlitt's <span class="italic">Characters of Shakespear's Plays</span>, and several volumes by both Leigh Hunt and Bryan Waller Procter (Barry Cornwall). Julius Charles Hare was associated with two of Ollier's periodicals, supplying lists of authors to the <span class="italic">Literary Pocket-Book</span> (1819&#150;23), and suggesting to Ollier the idea of the short-lived <span class="italic">Olliers Literary Miscellany</span> (1820), in which appeared pieces by Allan Cunningham, Hare, Lamb, Ollier himself, and Thomas Love Peacock (whose &#145;Four ages of poetry&#146; prompted Shelley to write his &#145;Defence of poetry&#146;, intended for the second number of the <span class="italic">Miscellany</span>, which never appeared). During these same years Ollier was very active in the Paddington vestry (at meetings also frequented by the publishers John Hunt and John Joseph Stockdale) and was elected overseer of the poor for the parish of Paddington. <br>
<br>Ollier went bankrupt in the winter of 1822&#150;3 and sold his complete inventory (including bookshelves, fancy stationery, and 288 unsold copies of <span class="italic">Prometheus Unbound</span> in quires) on 5&#150;11 March 1823. For some time he continued business as a stationer at his residence in Maida Hill, Paddington, and by the autumn of 1825 he returned to the publishing trade as the chief literary reader and adviser to Henry Colburn in New Burlington Street, then to Colburn and Richard Bentley during their merger of 1829&#150;32, and then to Bentley, who retained Ollier at the annual salary of &pound;300 until the autumn of 1839. During these years his brother James continued as a bookseller in Welbeck Street and occasionally worked for Bentley as a transcriber, translator, and editor, acted as a publisher of <span class="italic">Le chaperon noir</span> (1835), and also wrote the prose for <span class="italic">The Pictorial Album, or, Cabinet of Paintings, for the Year 1837</span>. James, whose later career is uncertain, died walking across the isthmus of Darien in 1851. <br>
<br>After leaving Bentley there is evidence that Charles Ollier (or his son Charles) began another ill-fated periodical, <span class="italic">Ollier's Concert Journal and Weekly Register of Musical Entertainments</span>. He became a publisher again at Southampton Street, Strand (1846&#150;9), his first published volume being Richard Henry Horne's <span class="italic">Ballad Romances</span>. He also published volumes by Charlton Carew, John James Halls, G. P. R. James, Harriet Kearney, Mary Molesworth Kindersley, the Mackinnons (Daniel Henry, Lauchlan Bellingham, and William Alexander), and John Edmund Reade&#151;certainly less distinguished authors than those from the years 1817&#150;23. To his credit, however, Ollier was one of the first critics in England to celebrate the genius of Walt Whitman; he lectured on the achievements of Henry Fielding; and he delighted in the plays and poetry of Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Robert Herrick, and Abraham Cowley. <br>
<br>During his long and varied career Ollier wrote and had published a number of his own works: <span class="italic">Altham and his Wife: a Domestic Tale</span> (1818), which Shelley thought was &#145;most unaffectedly told &hellip; in a strain of very pure &amp; powerful English&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 117); <span class="italic">Inesilla, or, The Tempter, a Romance: with other Tales</span> (1824), which was delayed owing to the death of his first child, Lucy Frances (1816&#150;1820); <span class="italic">Ferrers: a Romance of the Reign of George the Second</span> (3 vols., 1842; 2nd edn, 1843), for whose copyright he received &pound;150; the historical and descriptive letterpress for Thomas Boy's <span class="italic">Original Views of London</span> (1842) and William Delamotte's <span class="italic">Original Views of Oxford</span> (1843); and <span class="italic">Fallacy of Ghosts, Dreams, and Omens; with Stories of Witchcraft, Life-in-Death, and Monomania</span> (1848). He also published tales and articles and reviews in a number of periodicals, including <span class="italic">Ainsworth's Magazine</span> (1842&#150;5), <span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span> (1837, 1841), <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> (1822), Hunt's <span class="italic">Examiner</span> (1810), <span class="italic">Leigh Hunt's Journal</span> (1850), and <span class="italic">Naval and Military Gazette</span> (1854&#150;5). <br>
<br>Equally significant was Ollier's presence behind the scenes: for example, he was responsible for Colburn publishing Bulwer's <span class="italic">Pelham</span>, finished the last chapters of William Maginn's <span class="italic">John Manesty</span> (1844) after the novelist died, offered himself as a ghost writer to Bulwer, and served as the literary agent for a number of writers, including G. P. R. James. As early as 1829 Ollier was frequently asked by James to make certain that his novels were being properly advertised and reviewed and sent to his friends&#151;and he would seek Ollier's editorial advice on novels in manuscript. By the late 1840s, Ollier was paid by James to correct the proofs of his novels, advise him on his contracts and accounts with other publishers, and negotiate the sale of his copyrights. After James moved his family to America in 1850, Ollier saw some of James's last works through the press and arranged that his novels published by Harper in New York were published on the same day by T. C. Newby in London&#151;and he was also commissioned to seek copyrights for James's novels in Germany and France. <br>
<br>Ollier's second publishing business had failed by January 1849. According to his son Edmund, his father &#145;was not well adapted to making a trade of the sale of books&#146;  (Ollier, &#145;Literary publisher&#146;, 248). Suffering from debts of &pound;300, from his chronic respiratory illnesses (his mother and two of his brothers died of asthma), and from the financial strain of supporting his eldest son, Francis (1820&#150;1872), who was committed to a lunatic asylum for most of his life, Ollier was forced to apply to the Royal Literary Fund for grants of &pound;60 each in 1849, 1854, and 1857. In the second application he wrote that he had &#145;No salary, annuity or pension. I have no other means than working for publishers&#146;  (Royal Literary Fund case files, Charles Ollier, 3 May 1854). According to his obituary in the <span class="italic">Annual Register for 1859</span>, for<blockquote>many of his latter years Mr. Ollier was a kind of &#145;consulting physician&#146; on the merits of works offered to the London publishers, and was much engaged in putting into a readable form works of value by authors whose experience in the journey-work of literature was crude or non-existent.</blockquote>Ollier died after a long respiratory illness on 5 June 1859 at his home&#151;6 Bute Street, Old Brompton, London&#151;and he was buried on 11 June at Brompton cemetery, where the remainder of his family was eventually interred. His widow, who also received a Royal Literary Fund grant of &pound;60 in 1859&#150;60, died on 8 January 1878 at 154 Oakley Street, Chelsea, London, the home of her son Edmund. Leigh Hunt, Ollier's dearest friend for fifty years, memorialized him in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> (18 June 1859, 640) as &#145;a devoted husband and father&#146; and as a modest man whose religious beliefs were &#145;equally removed from atheistical hopelessness &hellip; and every cruelty of superstition&#146;. The <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> (10 June 1859) observed that &#145;Ollier has exercised a considerable influence over the course of literature, although an almost jealous diffidence of himself always kept him in the background&#146;. Ollier was a &#145;great keeper of things&#146;, and many of the autograph letters written to him by the more famous were sold at two Puttick and Simpson sales in 1877 and 1878. No photograph or portrait of Charles Ollier seems to exist.<br>
