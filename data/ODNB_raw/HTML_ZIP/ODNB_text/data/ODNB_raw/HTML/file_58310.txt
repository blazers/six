<span class="headword">Morshead,  Edmund Doidge Anderson</span>  (1849&#150;1912), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and translator</span>, was born on 4 February 1849 at Salcombe Regis, Devon, the third of the four sons of the Revd John Philip Anderson Morshead (1810&#150;1881) of Salcombe Regis and his wife, Alethea, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Yonge. He was the grandson of Colonel John Anderson (<i>d</i>. 1831), who married a Miss Morshead of Plymouth in 1800 and added her surname to his own in 1805. In 1861 Edmund was sent to Winchester College, his father's former school, as were his brothers. He soon gained a reputation for his wit and his remarkable capacity to memorize poetry. Proceeding on a scholarship to New College, Oxford, in 1867, he went on to gain firsts in moderations (1869) and in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1871). In 1874 he was made a fellow of the college, but by that time had been appointed to the staff at Winchester College, where, apart from a period in Oxford in 1874&#150;5, he spent the rest of his career. On 1 August 1878 he married Mary Fearon, whose brother W. A. Fearon was Morshead's colleague and, from 1884 to 1901, headmaster of Winchester.<br>
<br>Morshead's career was in many ways typical of the learned schoolmasters of the later nineteenth century, before the professionalization of academic life drove a wedge between school and university teaching. He produced several translations of Aeschylus and Sophocles, edited selections from Schiller and Byron, and published occasional verse compositions. His main claim to fame, however, rests on what was written about him. In 1880 his pupils Charles Locock and Francis Montagu produced a &#145;pronouncing dictionary&#146; of his speech mannerisms (&#145;Morsheadic&#146;, soon changed to &#145;Mushri&#146;). This was first circulated in manuscript and later &#145;jellygraphed&#146;; printed editions appeared in Oxford (1880, 1888) and London (1901). The <span class="italic">Mushri&#150;English Pronouncing Dictionary</span> was a spoof, yet it included a detailed, and apparently accurate, account of Morshead's strange phraseology and pronunciation. The most sustained jest of its kind, it is also perhaps unique in being an idiolectal dictionary.<br>
<br>Several influences combined to provoke the dictionary's appearance. The idiosyncrasy it celebrated was already manifested by Winchester Notions, the most venerable and complex of all school slangs. Awareness of individual differences was also heightened in Winchester in 1880 by the successful campaign to have a Liberal candidate elected to parliament. Feelings ran high in the school, where most of the staff were Conservative supporters; Morshead belonged to a small group of Liberals. The form and style of the dictionary owe much to the comparative philology then popular; it is probably significant that it appeared soon after James Murray's appeal in April 1879 for lexicographical information for the <span class="italic">New English Dictionary</span>.<br>
<br>Morshead's individuality was reinforced in the classroom by his mobile countenance, which his pupils watched for signs of impending jokes; a feature caught by two surviving photographs. Morshead was, however, not just an eccentric; the sparse evidence for his educational thinking suggests that he was a civilized and liberal man, free from many of the prejudices of his time and class. Speaking at the inauguration of the Birmingham branch of the Classical Association in 1906, he described its extreme attackers and defenders as impatient Philistines in the first case, and bigoted Pharisees in the second. Morshead was a keen walker and fisherman, both in his native Devon and abroad. In 1903 deteriorating eyesight forced him to retire, and he moved to Southwark&#151;a somewhat surprising decision that evidenced a commitment to charitable work; he gave lectures at the working men's college and also served as manager of local elementary schools. He died at his home, 29 Trinity Square, Southwark, on 24 October 1912, survived by his wife.<br>
