<span class="headword">Bix,  Angel</span>  (1645/6&#150;1695), <span class="occ">Franciscan friar</span>, was born in London; the surname may be the same as Biss. In 1655 a Brigit Biss was the mother of a Poor Clare nun named Margaret Figg in Flanders; Bix may have been a relative of hers as he later gave devoted service as chaplain to the Poor Clares in that area. When he died in 1695 it was said that he was forty-nine years old, having spent twenty-nine years as a Franciscan and twenty-three as a priest; he was therefore ordained about 1672.<br>
<br>Nothing is now known of Bix's early years and education, nor of his entry into the Franciscan order; however, a gifted preacher, his subsequent priestly life was divided among England, northern France, and the southern Netherlands. The English Franciscan chapter held at Somerset House in London in 1677 asked him to go to Aire-sur-la-Lys, south of St Omer, to supply for the chaplain to the Poor Clares there, Joachim St Ann. In 1680 the chapter was held in Bruges, and Bix was reappointed to Aire; at the chapter held in York a year later he was transferred as chaplain to the Poor Clares in Bruges. In 1684 he was recalled to the mission in England, and was succeeded at Bruges by Joseph Woodward.<br>
<br>Three years later, with James II on the throne, Bix was stationed as preacher at the new friary beside the arches at Lincoln's Inn Fields in London, and became chaplain to the Spanish ambassador. Still there in 1688 he was elected titular guardian of the vacated Canterbury friary, which post gave him a vote in chapter. In the same year he published <span class="italic">A sermon on the passion &hellip; preach'd before her majesty the queen dowager in her chappel at Sommerset House upon Good Fryday, 13 April 1688</span>. However, on the same day that the prince of Orange landed in Devon, on 4 November, a mob attacked the friary. James was asked to send soldiers to protect the friars but after his own flight the following month he had to tell the friars to vacate their residence beside the arches. Three or four years later, when it had been repaired at the friars' own expense, it became the residence of the Portuguese ambassador; once the friars' ten-year lease expired they had no more to do with it.<br>
<br>Bix left London for the continent in 1688 and in 1690 was again chaplain to the Poor Clares at Aire, and later to the third order sisters in the ancient palace at Princenhoff in Bruges. He returned to England about 1692, and in 1693 was the <i>praeses</i> or local superior at Osmotherley in Yorkshire; two years later he was at York itself. He died at Durham on 15 January 1695.<br>
