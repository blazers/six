<span class="headword">Barclay,  John</span>  (1741&#150;1823), <span class="occ">marine officer</span>, entered the corps in March 1755 as second lieutenant, and became first lieutenant in July 1756. He served throughout the Seven Years' War (1756&#150;63), in the Mediterranean, at Belle &Icirc;le (off the Britanny coast) in 1761, and on the coast of Africa; he was promoted captain in October 1762. He served with distinction through the American War of Independence, particularly in 1777 in Lord Howe's operation on the Delaware River at the Red Bank, and in the mud forts; he was in command of the marines on board the <i>Augusta</i> (sixty-four guns), when she bombarded the forts, and was abandoned after catching fire (on 23 October 1777). For these services he was promoted brevet major in August 1777. He served at the first relief of Gibraltar. He was one of the commanding officers of marines in Rodney's victory at the battle of the Saints (off Dominica, 12 April 1782), and afterwards was promoted lieutenant-colonel by brevet in February 1783.<br>
<br>Barclay had no further active service at sea, but was for the next thirty years chiefly employed on the staff of the marines in England. He became major in the marines in December 1791, and lieutenant-colonel in the marines, and brevet colonel in 1794 (marine officers then held concurrent marine and army ranks). In May 1796 he became major-general, and in February 1798 second colonel commandant in the corps. As such he was much involved with the marines' organization, and made changes in their drill and uniform including, in 1805 when he was commandant of the Chatham division, the introduction of blue working jackets for the Royal Marine Artillery. In 1803 he became lieutenant-general (September) and colonel commandant of the marines (December), and in September 1806 he became resident colonel commandant. He was then practically commander-in-chief of the corps, and its good character indicated the quality of its organization. In the 1797 Spithead and Nore mutinies and in other mutinous manifestations, the marines proved reliable against mutiny among the sailors. In June 1813 Barclay became general (though still colonel in the marines), and in April 1814 he retired on full pay, after fifty-nine years' continuous employment. He was married and had children. He went to live at Taunton, Somerset, where he died on 12 November 1823.<br>
<br>Barclay's son Fletcher Barclay entered the 56th (West Essex) regiment as ensign in 1791, served in the West Indies, the Low Countries, and India, was promoted lieutenant-colonel in 1811, commanded his regiment, was promoted colonel in the army in 1825, and retired in 1831.<br>
