<span class="headword">Cameron, Sir  (Gordon) Roy</span>  (1899&#150;1966), <span class="occ">pathologist</span>, was born at Echuca, Victoria, Australia, on 30 June 1899, the son of George Cameron, a Methodist preacher from South Australia, and his wife, Emily Pascoe, who had emigrated from Cornwall with her parents at the age of eleven. Cameron was their elder child&#151;his younger brother died in infancy&#151;and because his father, like most Methodist preachers, went on circuit, Cameron was brought up mainly by the women of the family.<br>
<br>All Cameron's early schooling was in the state schools of the villages: Mitiamo, Lancefield, Dunkeld, and finally Kyneton, where he lived from 1911 to 1917, and where he was able to read extensively and to listen to music. From 1913 to 1917 he did his compulsory military training, and reached the rank of second lieutenant. The teaching at Kyneton was mediocre, but he managed to obtain a senior scholarship and a major scholarship at Queen's College, Melbourne University, which he joined in February 1916.<br>
<br>Cameron had already decided on medicine, but it was not easy to make up for his ignorance of physics and chemistry, and he did only fairly well until his fourth year; in 1922 he graduated MB BS with second-class honours. After hearing Sir Harry Allen lecture on pathology he had decided on this as his subject, and after a year as resident medical officer at Melbourne Hospital, during which he did some research work in the pathology of pancreatitis, Cameron was appointed Stewart lecturer in pathology in the university department, where he pioneered experimental work by setting up a small animal house and a colony of guinea-pigs.<br>
<br>Early in 1925 Cameron was invited by C. H. Kellaway to succeed F. M. Burnet as his first assistant and deputy director of Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in Melbourne. Two years later he went on leave to work under Ludwig Aschoff in Freiburg im Breisgau and later under A. E. Boycott in University College Hospital medical school, London. It was intended that he should in time return to Melbourne to succeed Allen as professor, but when his time was up, he found, to his great consternation, that he did not wish to return. Encouraged by his father, he went to live with Boycott's chief technician, Fred Crew, who, with his wife, Alice, looked after him until he died.<br>
<br>Cameron became Graham scholar in pathology in 1928 and was Beit fellow from 1930 to 1933. After a rather unhappy year as pathologist at Queen Mary's Hospital, Stratford, London, he returned to University College medical school as reader in morbid anatomy (1934). In 1937, after Boycott's retirement, he was appointed professor, and in 1946 director of the Graham department, both of which posts he held until he retired in 1964. During the Second World War he was seconded to the Chemical Defence Experimental Establishment at Porton, Wiltshire.<br>
<br>Over the years Cameron received many honours and was always in demand for work. From 1935 to 1955 he was an assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Journal of Pathology and Bacteriology</span> under Matthew Stewart. In 1941 he became an honorary FRCP. He was elected FRS in 1946, served on its council in 1948&#150;9, and was one of its royal medallists in 1960. He became honorary LLD of Edinburgh in 1956 and of Melbourne in 1962. He received the gold medal of the Graham Research Fund and the Crawford Mollison research prize of the British Medical Association in Australia, and was honorary member of many pathological societies. From 1947 to 1956 he was a member of the Agricultural Research Council and from 1952 to 1956 a member of the Medical Research Council. He was knighted in 1957. But the honour which gave him the greatest pleasure was undoubtedly his unanimous election in 1962 to be founder president of the College of Pathologists.<br>
<br>Cameron's research work covered a very wide field, but he is most likely to be remembered for his work on the pathology of liver disease and of oedema of the lung, and for his willingness to encourage those who could bring biochemical concepts into pathology. By working out the pathological changes in the liver associated with poisoning by pure substances he was able to provide others with tools that would produce well-defined limited lesions in the liver, and thus to show how biliary obstruction, liver necrosis, vascular changes, and poisons affected it. Though not a biochemist, he had little difficulty in understanding biochemical concepts, and gave every help to those who wished to introduce them. Similar comment applies to his work on pulmonary oedema; he introduced new methods of producing it, and made a number of valuable suggestions to account for its development and for the remarkable species specific response to some lung irritants. He was in the main an experimental pathologist, according to some neither particularly expert nor interested in morbid anatomy. In practice, however, he used anything that came to hand&#151;casual findings at necropsy, the results of surgery, intended or unintended, accidental experimental results, morbid anatomy&#151;to stimulate experimental inquiry.<br>
<br>Cameron was universally regarded as an honest, kindly man, whose judgements were based on wide learning, vast experience, and natural impartiality. He had a sparkling sense of humour and took the greatest delight in human absurdity. He loved music, was a good pianist, and a goodish mathematician; he had a profound knowledge of the history of the Renaissance popes, and of the Renaissance in Italy&#151;a country he greatly loved. From his early years he liked walking, even mountaineering. In politics he was a benevolent Conservative, with considerable attachment to the idea of the British empire. This conservatism he brought into his work, mainly by working with the simplest available techniques, and refusing, sometimes perhaps unreasonably, to buy apparatus by which newer techniques might have been introduced. The vast amount that he did with these simple means is perhaps his best justification.<br>
<br>In his early days Cameron's lectures and papers were rather heavy; later he became a brilliant lecturer, whose papers were models of clarity and conciseness. He was the author of several books, notably <span class="italic">The Pathology of the Cell</span> (1952). Cameron, who never married, died in the Memorial Hospital, Finchley, London, of heart disease on 7 October 1966.<br>
