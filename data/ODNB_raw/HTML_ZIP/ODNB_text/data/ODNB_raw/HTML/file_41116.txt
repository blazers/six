<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gilbert,  Edmund William</span>  (1900&#150;1973), <span class="occ">geographer</span>, was born on 16 October 1900 in Hemsworth, Yorkshire, the only child of the Revd Robert Henry Gilbert (1868&#150;1922), rector of Hemsworth, and his wife, Mabel Billinton. After attending St Peter's School, York, he matriculated from Hertford College, Oxford, as an exhibitioner in 1919, graduating BA in modern history in 1922 with second-class honours.<br>
<br>Gilbert's interest in geography was aroused when he attended the summer school held at the University of Oxford's school of geography, in 1922. He subsequently followed the diploma course, gaining the Oxford diploma in geography with distinction in 1924. His study of the Pontefract and Doncaster area of Yorkshire was judged to be of exceptional merit. His first geographical paper, on Pontefract, was published in 1925. He proceeded BLitt in 1928, having undertaken further work in historical geography. As a diploma student he was the instigator and a founder member in 1924 of the Herbertson Society, the Oxford undergraduate geographical society, named after Andrew Herbertson, professor of geography at Oxford.<br>
<br>Between 1923 and 1926 Gilbert was junior lecturer in geography at Bedford College for Women in London, during which time he toyed with the idea of becoming a barrister. As a member of the Middle Temple he was placed in the first class in criminal law and procedure in the bar examination. But his interest in geography was restored after hearing an inspirational lecture on geography and world peace by Professor Percy Roxby of the University of Liverpool. In 1926 he moved to the University of Reading as lecturer in historical geography and was much happier there, remaining ten years and playing the leading part in setting up an honours school of geography. In 1927 he married a fellow Oxford diploma student, Barbara Maud Flux Dundas (<i>b</i>. 1902), who gave him support over the next forty-six years, caring for him with understanding during his occasional bouts of depression. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Gilbert returned to Oxford in 1936 as research lecturer in human geography, to work on a survey of social services in the Oxford district financed by the Rockefeller Foundation. In the war years he worked for the naval intelligence division of the Admiralty on the production of the <span class="roman">Geographical Handbook</span> series, writing most of the volumes on Spain and Portugal. He was appointed reader in human geography in 1943 and subsequently professor of geography in 1953, a position he held until 1967. The chair carried with it a fellowship at his old college, Hertford, for which he had considerable affection and of which he was emeritus fellow from 1967. Throughout his career Gilbert maintained close links with the Royal Geographical Society, serving three times on its council. He also served on the council of the Hakluyt Society and on committees of the British Association, section E (geography) and the Geographical Association.<br>
<br>Publication of <span class="italic">The Exploration of Western America, 1800&#150;1850</span> (1933) while he was at Reading reflected Gilbert's early interest in historical geography. His social conscience later found expression in his work on Oxford where, influenced by the writing of Vaughan Cornish, he also became involved in the activities of the Oxford Preservation Trust, serving as a trustee. His publications in the 1940s on English regions as a basis for administrative reform were pioneering and attracted attention beyond the geographical profession. In all his writing he stressed the importance of the past as a clue to understanding the present, a philosophy that found particular expression in his publications on university towns and seaside resorts. <span class="italic">Brighton: Old Ocean's Bauble</span> (1954) illustrates well his ability to blend geography and social history. His last book, <span class="italic">British Pioneers in Geography</span> (1972), paid tribute to, among others, his predecessor, Sir Halford Mackinder, with whom he shared a belief in geography as &#145;an humane study&#146;.<br>
<br>All Gilbert's writing, like his lectures, was elegant and carefully crafted, and he drew on novelists and painters to assist in the description and interpretation of regions that he regarded as central to geography. He was a skilled photographer, preferring black and white to colour. He was especially fond of visiting the capital cities and university towns of western Europe, and took many pictures of these places.<br>
<br>Billy Gilbert, as he was called by his friends, was a shy but kindly man, more at home at the school of geography in Oxford or the Royal Geographical Society than at geographical conferences and, for that reason, not as widely known as he deserved to be. He raised the status of geography within Oxford, securing fellowships in the colleges for his younger colleagues, and planning a major extension to the school of geography. He also recognized the need to encourage graduate studies, and a growing number of graduate students benefited from his encouragement and the ready hospitality which he and Barbara accorded them at their cottage in Appleton, near Oxford. He retired there in 1967 and in the same year was awarded the Murchison grant by the Royal Geographical Society in recognition of his contribution to urban studies and the history of geography. In 1968 he was presented with <span class="italic">Urbanization and its Problems</span>, a collection of essays by colleagues and former pupils. He died at his home, Old Cottage, Appleton, on 2 October 1973, having suffered a stroke in the previous year. He was buried at Appleton on 5 October 1973. The geography society at Hertford College is named after him.<br>
