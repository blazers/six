<span class="headword">Pell,  Albert</span>  (1820&#150;1907), <span class="occ">agriculturist and politician</span>, was born on 12 March 1820, in Montagu Place, Bloomsbury, London, the eldest of the three sons of Sir Albert Pell (1768&#150;1832), of Pinner Hill, Middlesex, and his wife, Margaret Letitia Matilda (1786&#150;1868), third daughter and coheir of Henry Beauchamp St John, twelfth Lord St John of Bletso. Sir Albert Pell was serjeant-at-law in 1808. He retired in 1825 but in 1831 became a judge of the court of bankruptcy.<br>
<br>Albert Pell was brought up at his father's houses at Pinner Hill and in Harley Street, and he was educated at Rugby School under Thomas Arnold (1832&#150;8). In 1839 he matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he described himself as &#145;idle and unstudious&#146;, though he helped to introduce Rugby football to Cambridge. He took the degree of MA in 1842, and was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1843, but he decided to abandon plans for reading for the bar, and took a farm in Harrow Vale, 12 miles from London.<br>
<br>In 1846 Pell married his cousin, Elizabeth Barbara, daughter of Sir Henry Halford, second baronet, MP for South Leicestershire, of Wistow Hall, Leicestershire. They had no children. In 1848 they settled at Hazelbeach, Northamptonshire, between Northampton and Market Harborough, in a house which Pell rented from his wife's relative Sir Charles Isham. He found his farm at Hazelbeach to be &#145;dreadfully out of order, foul, wet and exhausted&#146;, but he set to work on its improvement.<br>
<br>The outbreak of cattle plague in 1865 led Pell to campaign for the slaughter of animals to wipe out the disease, and he organized a meeting of agriculturists in London. One result of this was the establishment of the central chamber of agriculture, and Pell became its first chairman in 1866. He was chosen as Conservative candidate for the by-election for South Leicestershire in 1867 because of his work to eliminate the cattle plague, but he was beaten by a small majority. In 1868 he was returned, and he represented the constituency until his retirement in 1885. Although a tory, he always remained a radical at heart.<br>
<br>Pell was an authority on the poor law. He was guardian for his own parish of Hazelbeach as early as 1853. In 1873, at his own board of guardians (Brixworth), he moved for a committee to inquire into the methods of administration of outdoor relief, and following the committee's report outdoor relief was virtually abolished in the Brixworth union. In 1876 Pell carried an amendment on Lord Sandon's <span class="roman">Education Bill</span>, providing for the abolition of school boards in districts where there were only voluntary schools. From 1876 to 1889 Pell had a seat as a nominated guardian for St George-in-the-East, London, where he had property, and there he tried to enforce his views on outdoor relief. He failed to persuade the House of Commons to consider his proposals, but in 1884 he carried by 208 votes to 197 a motion against the government, which criticized the postponement of further measures of relief acknowledged to be due to ratepayers in counties and boroughs in respect of local charges imposed on them for national services. On this occasion he made his longest speech in the house, speaking for an hour and a half  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 286, 1884, 1023).<br>
<br>Pell was a prominent figure at poor-law conferences, and was chairman of the central conference from 1877 to 1898. He was also an active member of the Northamptonshire county council from its establishment in 1889. In June 1879 he and his friend Clare Sewell Read (1826&#150;1905) went to America and Canada as assistant commissioners to the duke of Richmond's royal commission on agriculture to study agricultural questions. Pell was also a member of the royal commissions on the City guilds, the City parochial charities, and the aged poor.<br>
<br>In 1886, shortly after his retirement from parliament, Pell became a member of the council of the Royal Agricultural Society, and worked on its <span class="italic">Journal</span>, and on its chemical and education committees. He contributed to the <span class="italic">Journal</span> two significant articles, &#145;The making of the land in England&#146; (1887 and 1889) and a biography of Arthur Young (1893), as well as other minor articles and notes. He was a member of the Farmers' Club, which he joined in February 1867; he became a member of its committee in 1881 and its chairman in 1888. He was one of the pioneers of the teaching of agriculture at the University of Cambridge, and was made honorary LLD there when the Royal Agricultural Society met at Cambridge in 1894.<br>
<br>At the end of his life poor health led Pell to spend the winters at Torquay, in Devon. He died on 7 April 1907 at Longwood, Torquay, and was buried at Hazelbeach in Northamptonshire.<br>
