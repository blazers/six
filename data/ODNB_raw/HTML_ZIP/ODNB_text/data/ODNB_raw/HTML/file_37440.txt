<span class="headword">Gamble, Sir  David</span>, first baronet  (1823&#150;1907), <span class="occ">chemical manufacturer</span>, was born in Dublin on 3 February 1823, the only son of Hannah, daughter of Henry Gower, a Dublin solicitor, and <a name="cosubject_37440"></a><span class="headword">Josias Christopher Gamble</span>  (1775&#150;1848), <span class="occ">chemical manufacturer</span>, who was born at Enniskillen, co. Fermanagh. The elder Gamble, having been educated at Glasgow University (MA 1797), served from 1799 to 1804 as a Presbyterian minister in his native town. He also valued earthly promotion, however, and, perceiving the recent but growing demand for chloride of lime for bleaching Irish linen, he is said to have become interested in its manufacture in the adjacent co. Monaghan. He certainly was active as a chemical manufacturer in Dublin in 1806; there in due course he came to know James Muspratt, and may have had business relations with him. Muspratt pioneered the Leblanc soda-making process in Liverpool in 1823 in order to supply the expanding soap industry of the area, but was soon driven out of the borough because of the extreme atmospheric pollution caused by his factory. In 1828 he moved a dozen miles or so to the east, to the small but growing town of St Helens, which still lacked any form of restrictive local government. He invited J. C. Gamble, then in his early fifties, to join him as junior partner. When Muspratt moved on again after two years, Gamble found other partners, and eventually John Crosfield, then in business in Warrington.<br>
<br>David Gamble was educated at a private school in St Helens. His father, then unusual in being a university graduate in business, resolved that his son should benefit from the best training in chemistry available. He sent him for a year, aged sixteen, to University College, London, and then (1840&#150;43) to the Andersonian Institution in Glasgow. In 1843 David joined his father (aged sixty-eight) in a small new chemical works which they opened, as J. C. Gamble &amp; Son, close to the original Muspratt premises. He inherited the business at his father's death on 27 January 1848 and built it up so successfully that by 1865 its rateable value had caught up with that of the earlier factory, which itself had grown fourfold in the interim.<br>
<br>Gamble married Elizabeth, daughter of James Haddock, a prominent local coal owner, at St Helens parish church on 26 February 1847. They lived comfortably in Windle township on the north side of St Helens until the 1860s, when he was in a position to build himself an impressive mansion, Windlehurst, in its own grounds not far from Windle Hall, where the senior member of the Pilkington glass-making family lived. He needed the large house for his growing family. Of eleven children, the four older sons (born 1848, 1852, 1856, and 1858) eventually joined him in the business which, besides the manufacture of Leblanc soda and bleaching powder, developed markets for by-products as well as potassium chlorate and magnesium sulphate (Epsom salts). Although the chemical industry was concentrated on Widnes, a few miles to the south on the Mersey, because of canal transport cost advantages, J. C. Gamble &amp; Son remained at St Helens and became the main chemical manufacturers there, developing a flourishing export trade, especially to the United States. When Parr's Bank was formed into a limited company in 1865, Gamble was made a director, with authority &#145;to examine the customers' accounts at St Helens from time to time &hellip; and to report thereon&#146;, though he was specifically forbidden from seeing any of the accounts of other chemical manufacturers. From 1883 he was paid &pound;150 a year &#145;for St Helens duty&#146; and remained on Parr's board for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Although he was a convinced free-trader, Gamble did not hesitate to combine with other manufacturers where this was to their common advantage. In 1867 he joined in the formation of the Tharsis Sulphur and Copper Company to ensure sulphur supplies. In 1883 he was involved in creating the Lancashire Bleaching Powder Manufacturers' Association in an attempt to maintain profitability within the industry against the lower cost ammonia-soda process, worked in Britain by Brunner, Mond &amp; Co. This competition, however, caused the Leblanc manufacturers to merge their businesses into the United Alkali Company Ltd in 1891. J. C. Gamble &amp; Son was then valued at &pound;320,000, considerably more than the next largest chemical concern in St Helens.<br>
<br>All this business activity did not prevent Gamble from playing a leading part in local government from its inception. In 1845 he became one of the original St Helens improvement commissioners and served as their chairman from 1856 to 1862. When the town was incorporated in 1868, he served as the first mayor, and was re-elected for two further terms in 1882/3 and 1886/7. When the volunteers were formed in 1860, he became their lieutenant-colonel&#151;until 1887&#151;and built the local Volunteer Hall. Colonel Gamble, as he then liked to be called, stood for parliament as a Liberal when the town first obtained independent representation in 1885, but was narrowly defeated. When a new grammar school, Cowley School, was opened in 1882, he contributed &pound;1000 towards it and saw that laboratory facilities were provided. In 1883 he contributed towards University College, Liverpool, together with other chemical manufacturers, who all wished to see higher education facilities available in the region for present and future employees. In 1893 he gave &pound;25,000 to enable a technical institute and library to be built in the town centre &#145;for the purpose of assisting our people to make themselves equal or superior to those countries where technical education has been an institution for a great number of years&#146;.<br>
<br>For his many public services Gamble was made a CB in 1887, a baronet in 1897 and a KCB in 1904. He died at Windlehurst on 4 February 1907.<br>
