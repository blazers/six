<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Benson <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Anderson]</span>,  Stella</span>  (1892&#150;1933), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born at Lutwyche Hall, Wenlock Edge, Shropshire, on 6 January 1892, the younger daughter and third child of Ralph Beaumont Benson (1862&#150;1911), landowner, of Lutwyche Hall, and his wife, Caroline Essex (1861&#150;1934), second daughter of Richard Hugh Cholmondeley, rector of Hodnet, later of Condover Hall, Shropshire, and younger sister of the novelist Mary Cholmondeley. Benson spent an isolated, lonely, and sickly childhood in the care of a succession of nannies, and she watched uncomprehendingly as her parents' marriage deteriorated because of her father's alcoholism and womanizing. She found consolation in her dog Pepper, in a secret &#145;imaginary world filled with imaginary people&#146;  (Grant, 19), and in her diary, begun in 1901 and kept throughout her life. Attempts to have her educated foundered, always ending &#145;in illness and great nervous unhappiness&#146;  (Roberts, 14). She was educated at home, then at a private school at Hindhead, Surrey, and in 1906&#150;7 at a boarding-school in Eastbourne. In 1910 she attended a girls' school in Freiburg, Germany. Despite her frailty, she fared better with travel, spending a happy seventeen months in Switzerland and the south of France from 1910 on, before sailing to the West Indies for the winter of 1913&#150;14, the latter experience providing material for her first book, <span class="italic">I Pose</span> (1915).<br>
<br>Benson's experiences leading up to and during the early part of the First World War working for suffragists' organizations and for charities in the East End of London also contributed material for this &#145;post-impressionist&#146; novel. Its originality lies in its radical subversion of the traditional closure of romance in marriage: Benson has the suffragette heroine defiantly hurl a bomb at a church altar. After the financial success of this effort (which netted her &pound;60) Benson wrote another novel set in the East End, <span class="italic">This is the End</span> (1917), that centres on unrequited love and conveys a broad range of attitudes towards the war as well. During the latter years of the war Benson continued to work for the Charity Organization Society, though she satirized members' self-righteous attitudes in her third novel, <span class="italic">Living Alone</span> (1919), and then worked for the war effort as a gardener in Berkshire.<br>
<br>In 1918 for health reasons Benson voyaged to the USA, and travelled from New York to California. After a year there working at various odd jobs she felt so alienated by the vulgarity of America that she decided in December 1919 to travel to Hong Kong, where she taught at an Anglican boys' school, and then to Peking (Beijing), where she worked in a medical institute.<br>
<br>In China, where she would spend much of the rest of her life, Benson met James Carew O'Gorman Anderson (1893&#150;1946), known as Shaemus, who was employed by the imperial Chinese maritime customs service. She married him in London on 27 September 1921, exactly one year after meeting him. There were no children of the marriage. They spent their honeymoon making the daring journey between New York and California in a Model T Ford, affectionately named Stephanie. All the while Stella worked on a fourth novel, <span class="italic">The Poor Man</span> (1922), which included satirical treatment of her first stay in California that provoked outrage among some Californian friends.<br>
<br>Though Benson was often depressed in China, partly because of the narrow-minded colonial mentality and partly because of marital difficulties, she was quite productive as a writer. Along with three more novels, she began to publish whimsical and amusing short stories, and well-regarded travel books (<span class="italic">The Little World</span>, 1925; <span class="italic">Worlds within Worlds</span>, 1928). With her novel <span class="italic">The Far-Away Bride</span> (1930; published in the UK as <span class="italic">Tobit Transplanted</span> in 1931) she achieved both popular success and critical acclaim, winning the A. C. Benson silver medal of the Royal Society of Literature and, more important to her, the French Femina Vie Heureuse prize in 1932. This carefully crafted novel develops the theme that most obsessed her&#151;loss of identity and resulting isolation&#151;in tracing the plight of the White Russians exiled in Manchuria.<br>
<br>On returning alone to England in January 1932 Benson found herself a literary celebrity. She had her portrait drawn by Wyndham Lewis, and renewed her friendship with, among other writers, Virginia Woolf, who described her as:<blockquote>quiet, as controlled, white, drawn as usual, also deaf: with steady honest eyes &hellip; a very weak but persistent voice; she coughs; &amp; then goes on with a mild persistent patience. She is bleached; even her blue eyes are bleached. But at the same time she's practical; realistic. &hellip; All this serious, weary, intent. (<span class="italic">Diary of Virginia Woolf</span>, 117&#150;18)</blockquote>By August she was off to rejoin her husband, Shaemus, now in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong she helped organize a successful campaign against its system of licensed prostitution. With him on a visit to Hongay in Tonkin, French Indo-China, she contracted pneumonia and died in hospital at Baie d'Along, near Haiphon, on 6 December 1933. She was buried on 7 December in the French cemetery on the &Icirc;le de Charbon, near Hongay.<br>
<br>Collections of Benson's poems and short stories and an unfinished novel about colonial life were published posthumously. L. P. Hartley wrote of the novel <span class="italic">Mundos</span> (1935) that &#145;[Stella Benson's] talent never found more brilliant expression than in the haunting, disturbing cadences of her swan song&#146;  (Grant, 293). It seems probable that had she lived she would have surpassed her already notable achievement.<br>
<br>Stella Benson had a unique ability to blend fantasy and reality, especially evident in her earlier novels and in her short stories. Her impish humour and wicked wit, frequently directed towards a satirical end, masked an underlying compassion. Benson's novels (especially her later more realistic ones) and stories often treat serious social issues and reflect her travails as a twentieth-century woman: supporting female suffrage, witnessing the tragedy of the First World War, and living in a hostile, volatile colonial setting. Despite her very modern, ironic treatment of the theme of individuals lost, isolated, and alienated in strange and frightening situations, she has not garnered much contemporary critical attention, and deserves reappraisal.<br>
