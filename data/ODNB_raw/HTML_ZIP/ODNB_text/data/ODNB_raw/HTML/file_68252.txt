<span class="headword">Darby,  Charles</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1635, <em>d.</em> 1709), <span class="occ">poet and clergyman</span>, probably born at Bramford, Suffolk, was baptized there on 1 March 1635, the son of Charles Darby. He was admitted as a pensioner of Jesus College, Cambridge, on 21 April 1652 under the tutorship of Thomas Woodcock, who said that Darby enjoyed &#145;the best naturall parts of any pupill he ever had, yet extream idle&#146;  (&#145;Extracts from the papers of Thomas Woodcock&#146;, 84). He was elected a scholar of the college in the following year and took his BA in 1655&#150;6, his MA in 1659. Darby delivered the prevaricator's speech at the commencement of 1660 to great acclaim, but thought that he had &#145;only shewed that I can play the fool to please Boys&#146;, hoping instead that &#145;God would keep him from such company&#146;  (ibid., 84). He was also the author of a number of neo-Latin university poems. To <span class="italic">Musarum Cantabrigiensium</span> (1658) he contributed two meditations occasioned by the death of Oliver Cromwell (of which the second was in English) which look to the succession of Cromwell's son Richard as lord protector, but a year after the Restoration his verses on the death of Mary, princess of Orange, eldest sister of Charles II, were published in <span class="italic">Threni Cantabrigienses</span> (1661), and in <span class="italic">Epithalamia Cantabrigiensia</span> (1662) he celebrated the king's marriage to Catherine of Braganza. He remained a fellow of Jesus College from 1657 to 1666.<br>
<br>Darby was ordained a deacon at Lincoln on 27 September 1662 and a priest at Ely on 19 September 1663. In 1664 Woodcock prevailed on Sir Thomas Barnardiston to present Darby in the rectorship of Kedington, Suffolk. There he remained for the rest of his life. Darby thanked his former tutor for his help and asked for his further assistance in finding a wife, &#145;with whome he desired not durty mony, but pure vertue, yet in regard vertue was not infallibly certain, he desired 1,000 pounds caution-mony, for vertue should fail&#146;  (&#145;Extracts from the papers of Thomas Woodcock&#146;, 84). On 8 November 1666 he married Mary Haiward at Sproughton, Suffolk. They had over ten children. Although at least three died in infancy, two daughters, Mary and Elizabeth, lived to marry in Kedington and three sons, Charles (their first child, baptized on 12 October 1667), Edward, and Henry (their last, baptized on 5 November 1683), followed their father to Jesus College. Darby continued to write and to publish during his incumbency, including <span class="italic">Bacchanalia, or, A Description of a Drunken Club</span> (1680), a popular Pindaric which had enjoyed four editions by 1698, <span class="italic">An Elegy on the Death of the Queen</span> (1695), in memory of Queen Mary, and <span class="italic">The Book of Psalms in English Metre</span> (1704), a hymnal prefaced by fourteen pages of familiar melodies to which his renderings are set. &#145;The tacker[s]: by a Church of England minister&#146;, composed about April 1705, a verse satire on those who sought to attach the <span class="roman">Bill against Occasional Conformity</span> (1704) to a money bill, has been attributed to Darby (British Library MS Add. 71446, fols. 1<i>v</i>&#150;3<i>v</i>, citing fol. 1<i>v</i>; the manuscript is a copy, not the poet's autograph). <span class="italic">Union: a Poem Humbly Dedicated to the Queen</span> (1707) celebrates the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> in figures which tell of his many years of settled rural ministry; &#145;Thus have I often seen&#146; he comments on the failure to unite the Anglican establishment and the Kirk, &#145;Two Churches friendly stand in one Church-Yard&#146;  (p. 6).<br>
<br>Darby died in Kedington and was buried there, at the church of Sts Peter and Paul, on 19 September 1709.<br>
