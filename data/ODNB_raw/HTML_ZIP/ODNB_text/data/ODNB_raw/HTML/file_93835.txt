<span class="headword">Blow,  David Mervyn</span>  (1931&#150;2004), <span class="occ">crystallographer and biophysicist</span>, was born on 27 June 1931 at 4 Claremont Road, Handsworth, Birmingham, the younger son of Edward Mervyn Blow, Methodist minister, and his wife, Dorothy Laura, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sanders. After a peripatetic early education he and his brother Ralph were educated at Kingswood School, Bath, where he developed his interest in physics. His entry to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, on an open scholarship was delayed by two years' national service (1949&#150;51). These he spent in the RAF training as a glider pilot. He had several brushes with death. At Cambridge he read physics, graduated in 1954, and was encouraged to stay on to do research. He was awarded his PhD in 1957. On 3 August 1955, at the Methodist church in Windsor Road, Ealing, he had married Mavis June Evelyn Sears, a 23-year-old schoolteacher, and daughter of John Charles Sears, a technical assistant for London Transport. They had a son, Julian, and a daughter, Elizabeth.<br>
<br>Blow had arrived at the Medical Research Council unit for the study of molecular biological systems, Cambridge, in 1954 as a slightly uncertain PhD candidate who preferred radio astronomy but who had heard that there were funds in biophysics. When he discovered what Max Perutz and his colleagues were doing his enthusiasm was captured and he began research for his doctorate as Perutz's student and assistant. It was a good time for able physicists to do research in biology as it was the techniques in physics and chemistry that were equipping biochemists and biologists to penetrate the complexity of living systems. The explosive growth of biological sciences from the 1950s onwards in part arose through X-ray crystallography, a discipline pioneered by Perutz and John Kendrew in this laboratory that revealed the positions of the atoms in the large and complex biologically active molecules. It was about the time of Blow's arrival at the unit that Perutz made the critical discovery that it was possible to react a mercury atom with haemoglobin without removing its ability to bind oxygen and without damaging the crystal. Perutz realized that heavy atom binding like this was not only the way into the determination of haemoglobin's atomic structure but was also a general route for the determination of protein structures. The problem that Blow addressed was to formulate mathematical routines that computed the best phases from the changes in the intensities of the X-ray reflections of native and heavy atom-reacted haemoglobin crystals. It was essential that these routines could be transferred to computers, given the tedium of evaluating probabilities for each reflexion and the huge size of the data sets. Blow derived a rigorous procedure that at the time of his death remained the basis for the calculation methods for determining phases. The project attracted the interest of Francis Crick and together he and Blow produced a definitive paper on the treatment of errors in the isomorphous replacement method. <br>
<br>After a relatively unproductive spell as a Fulbright scholar at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1957&#150;9), Blow was offered a research position back at Perutz's unit in Cambridge, which he very happily accepted. This move brought him to a laboratory whose research was still growing in impact. He found himself sharing a room with Michael Rossmann, another young crystallographer just back from the United States. As sometimes happens, they just hit it off and began a remarkably creative collaboration on developing a new way of determining phases and solving protein structures. The Blow and Rossmann partnership became a legend. Though the two men were profoundly different in their mental and emotional make-up they shared strong moral principles and had a similar nonconformist upbringing. In their research Blow's rigour and analytical mind was a perfect foil for Rossmann's imaginative and energetic leaps. Together they effected a new and fundamental approach to protein structural analysis. Proteins, for example haemoglobin, often consist of similar or identical subunits and Blow and Rossmann recognized that this repetition of structure puts constraints on the phases. In principle if one knew how the identical subunits were related in the crystal this information could be used in deriving phase information. Conceptually this insight was a landmark, and the huge expansion of protein crystallography in later years gave it immense practical importance. It turned out that the molecular replacement method pioneered by Blow and Rossmann was very powerful in locating similar structures in different crystals. Since there is a limited repertoire of chain folds in the protein population the Blow and Rossmann approach of molecular replacement became the principal method for solving unknown protein structures.<br>
<br>Blow and Rossmann moved with Perutz's unit when it merged with another led by Fred Sanger to form the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge. By 1964 they were doing encouraging calculations with the molecular replacement method. One protein studied was chymotrypsin whose specificity and mechanism was a major focus in biochemistry and biology. When in 1964 Rossmann moved to the USA Blow continued the research, establishing a small group that contained Paul Sigler, Brian Matthews, and others. This young team worked with blazing enthusiasm, solving the structure of chymotrypsin (only the second enzyme structure to be solved) in just three years, a remarkable achievement.<br>
<br>In 1977 Blow moved to Imperial College, London, to hold a newly created chair of biophysics. Typically he was responding in this move to the intention of the Medical Research Council that its staff should move into the university sector and stimulate research there. He established his biophysics laboratory in the physics department; this suited him since he remained a physicist in many ways. His research continued to concentrate on enzymes, and in particular he worked closely with Brian Hartley and Alan Fersht on chymotrypsin and tyr-tRNA-synthetase. These structural and mechanistic studies were often linked to the innovative mutagenesis experiments being undertaken by Alan Fersht that led to the very powerful technique called &#145;protein engineering&#146;. Other enzymes Blow studied included isomerase, cholesterol oxidase, HIV reverse transcriptase, and carboxy-peptidase G2. These were all biologically and medically important, but two of them proved extremely difficult to crystallize. This experience prompted Blow to establish research into protein crystallization&#151;which led to the development of a useful automated micro-batch system&#151;as well as crystals. Throughout he maintained his penchant for theoretical aspects of X-ray analysis and a continuing commitment to crystallographic methods. Indeed his last two papers in 2002 and 2003 were on crystallographic theory.<br>
<br>Blow's authority in crystallography, the breadth of his interests, and his grasp of physics made him a valuable member of the international community of crystallographers. It was often Blow who ensured that technicalities in the subject were discussed properly and he would on occasion play an influential role in resolving more general issues. There were for example worrying occasions when wrong structures got published. He had the ability and convictions to ask the right questions, a very important attribute in exposing what Perutz called &#145;error&#146;. Fortunately his credentials and his engaging and straightforward manner usually reduced the tensions that can accompany the correcting of mistakes. One of his important initiatives was the founding in 1982 of the British Crystallographic Association, an organization that included all the different fields of the subject. This was a big commitment that required energy and time, and Blow gave them cheerfully and effectively.<br>
<br>As an academic and scientific colleague Blow combined his serious approach with warmth and consideration. His commitment to research set an influential example; he took teaching seriously and had a wonderful enthusiasm for it. He recognized the need for administration, which he did well. At Imperial he inevitably assumed increasing responsibility, being for a considerable period the dean of science and later head of the physics department (then the largest department at Imperial). In all his dealings he was utterly honest and without personal ambition, and characteristically he was always active on behalf of others.<br>
<br>The importance of Blow's crystallographic and biochemical research was recognized by his election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1972 and by many awards, including the CIBA medal in 1967, the Charles Leopold Meyer prize in 1979, and the Wolf Foundation prize for chemistry in 1987, shared with David Phillips. Naturally he became the president of the British Crystallographic Association, a position he filled with great distinction from 1984 to 1988.<br>
<br>Blow took early retirement in 1994 owing to problems with his heart. He moved to Appledore in Devon, where he had family roots and where he and his wife joined enthusiastically in village life. As a physicist he recognized that students or beginners from the biological sciences and even chemistry needed education in the concepts, theory, and practicalities of crystallography. To answer this need he wrote the excellent <span class="italic">Outline of Crystallography for Biologists</span> (2002), which was warmly welcomed by his fellow experts and by students attracted by its thoughtful format and the remarkably clear and beautifully illustrated text. In the final year of his life he wrote a short science fiction novel, &#145;Live-Net&#146;, which connected the immense extent and complexity of the world wide web and evolution, a natural follow up of his research. He died on 8 June 2004 at his home, 26 Riversmeet, Appledore, of lung cancer, and was survived by his wife, Mavis, and their two children. In 2006 a new chair in biophysics at Imperial College was named after him.<br>
