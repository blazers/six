<span class="headword">Segal,  Judah Benzion <span class="st"> [Ben]</span></span>  (1912&#150;2003), <span class="occ">scholar of Semitic languages</span>, was born on 21 June 1912 at 37 Hawthorn Street, Elswick, Newcastle upon Tyne, the eldest son and second of five children (two girls, three boys) of Moses Hirsch Segal (1875&#150;1968), rabbi and Hebrew scholar, and his wife, Hannah Leah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Frumkin (1874&#150;1968). Both parents had been born in Lithuania. He was educated at Magdalen College School, Oxford, and St Catharine's College, Cambridge. He graduated with a first-class degree in oriental languages in 1935, having studied all the major Semitic languages. He subsequently went on to study for a research degree at St John's College, Oxford, and was awarded a DPhil there in 1939. His outstanding academic ability won him a series of prizes and scholarships, the most prestigious of which was the Tyrwhitt scholarship for Hebrew at Cambridge.<br>
<br>On account of his knowledge of Arabic, on the outbreak of the Second World War Segal was posted first as deputy assistant director of public security in the Sudan government, from 1939 to 1941, then to British intelligence in Cairo. In early 1942 he received special training in the identification of enemy tanks and aircraft and was introduced to David Stirling, founder of the Special Air Service. He was then sent by the long range desert group of the British army over a hundred miles behind German lines to Benina in north Africa, with instructions to report on the movements of Rommel's forces and give advance warnings of planned attacks. He spent some three months in secret hideouts together with local Arabs. His regular reports helped save many allied lives. Narrowly avoiding capture on several occasions, he led another operation in November 1942 that resulted in the capture of Derna, the second largest city in Cyrenaica, which proved to be crucial for the advance of General Montgomery's Eighth Army. (The union jack which he hastily assembled for the occasion from rags and handkerchiefs was later given to the Imperial War Museum.) For this distinguished service he was awarded the Military Cross in 1942. In the book <span class="italic">Long Range Desert Group</span> by W. B. Kennedy Shaw, published in 1945, Segal was referred to as Captain Seagrim to protect his identity; Seagrim was changed to Segal in a later edition of the book. He remained in north Africa for the rest of the war, and served as education officer in the British administration of Tripolitania from 1944 to 1946. While on leave in Jerusalem towards the end of the war he met Leah Seidemann, at that time a sergeant in the Palestine Auxiliary Territorial Service. They married in 1946, and had two daughters, Naomi and Miriam.<br>
<br>After the war Segal resumed his academic career, at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London. Starting in 1946 as a lecturer in Hebrew and Aramaic, he was promoted to reader in 1955 and finally to a chair in Semitic languages in 1961, which he held until his retirement in 1979. He served as head of the Near and Middle Eastern department at SOAS from 1961 to 1968, and in the latter year was elected a fellow of the British Academy.<br>
<br>Segal's research was wide-ranging. Several of his publications concerned the Christian Aramaic dialect known as Syriac and the culture and literature of eastern Christianity. His first book, <span class="italic">The Diacritical Point and the Accents in Syriac</span> (1953), was a study of the vowels of Syriac, which was greatly admired by Semitic philologists and often regarded as one of his best works. In 1970 he published <span class="italic">Edessa: the Blessed City</span>, an erudite, but very accessible, historical study of the city of Edessa, modern Urfa in southern Turkey, where the Syriac language had its origins. In recognition of his research achievement in this book, he was awarded the freedom of the city of Urfa in 1973. He also made major contributions in the field of Hebrew and Jewish history. His book <span class="italic">The Hebrew Passover from the Earliest Times to <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 70</span> (1963) quickly became a standard work. After his retirement he continued his scholarly research with considerable energy. In 1981 he was awarded a Leverhulme emeritus fellowship, which allowed him to conduct research in India on the Jews of Cochin, resulting in the publication in 1993 of his definitive work on the subject, <span class="italic">A History of the Jews of Cochin</span>. He also continued to make important contributions to Aramaic studies by his publication of <span class="italic">Aramaic Texts from North Saqqara, with some Fragments in Phoenician</span> (1983), and <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Aramaic and Mandaic Incantation Bowls in the British Museum</span> (2000, in collaboration with Erica Hunter).<br>
<br>Segal's public-spiritedness was demonstrated on numerous occasions, especially when from 1982 until 1985 he agreed to become director of the progressive Jewish seminary, Leo Baeck College, in London, and worked resolutely and successfully to save it from imminent closure. He was an active member of the Council of Christians and Jews. From 1985 to 1991 he served as vice-president of the Reform Synagogues of Great Britain. Modest and self-effacing, but also approachable and generous, he enjoyed a warm family life, and long walks. He lived latterly in Edgware; his last years were clouded by Parkinson's disease and other health complications. He died of spindle cell cancer of the leg on 23 October 2003 at Northwick Park Hospital, Brent, London. He was survived by his wife and their two daughters.<br>
