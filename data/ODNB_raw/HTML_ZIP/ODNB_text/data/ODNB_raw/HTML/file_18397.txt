<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Maxfield,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1784), <span class="occ">Methodist preacher</span>, hailed from Bristol, but nothing is known of his parents or his early life. He was converted by John Wesley's preaching at Bristol on 21 May 1739, and, despite his youth, was soon appointed leader of a Methodist band&#151;a small group for fellowship and mutual confession. In 1740 Charles Wesley took Maxfield to London, where he was given further responsibility as an assistant leader in the Methodist society. In the winter of 1740&#150;41 John Wesley put him in charge of the society at the Foundery Chapel, London, while he himself returned to his Bristol ministry. Maxfield's brief was to pray with the members and give them informal exhortation. Encouraged, however, by Selina, countess of Huntingdon, and others he began to preach, which, as a layman, he was not authorized to do. John Wesley, informed of this new development, rode post-haste from Bristol to London, and at the Foundery was met by his mother, Susanna. To his curt &#145;Thomas Maxfield has turned preacher, I find&#146;, she replied:<blockquote>John, you know what my sentiments have been. You cannot suspect me of favouring readily any thing of this kind. But take care what you do with respect to that young man, for he is as surely called of God to preach, as you are. Examine what have been the fruits of his preaching, and hear him also yourself.</blockquote>Having done so, Wesley acknowledged, &#145;It is the Lord. Let him do what seemeth him good&#146;  (Moore, 1.506).<br>
<br>Maxfield's preaching gifts made such a profound impression on Lady Huntingdon that, in a letter to John Wesley of 31 January 1742, she described Maxfield, bearing in mind his humble origins, as &#145;One of the greatest instances of God's peculiar favour that I know. He has raised from the stones one to set among the princes of his people&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of John Wesley</span>, 26.73). In early 1741 Wesley appointed Maxfield as a full-time lay itinerant preacher, the first of his many &#145;sons in the Gospel&#146;. In 1745 Wesley made him an assistant&#151;a preacher with responsibility for overseeing a circuit, a collection of Methodist societies scattered over a wide area. In June 1745, while Maxfield was preaching in Cornwall, he was press-ganged for the navy, but, having been rejected by the captain of the ship to which he was taken, was put in prison at Penzance. He was about to be freed when, by the intervention of William Borlase of Ludgvan, a clerical magistrate and avowed opponent of the Methodists, he was conscripted for military service instead. John Wesley, on a preaching tour of Cornwall, heard of these events. He rode at once to Marazion with George Thomson, in whose church Wesley had been invited to preach, to confront the justices and contend for Maxfield's release. They were not allowed into the court room until late at night, by which time Maxfield had been sentenced to military service and the justices had dispersed.<br>
<br>Maxfield did eventually obtain his release, however, as he was present at the Bristol annual conference of Methodist preachers in 1746. He became one of Wesley's most trusted lieutenants, and in the minutes of conference for 1758 he is listed immediately beneath the Wesleys themselves. This placing both underlines his seniority and also may well indicate that by this date he had, at Wesley's request, been ordained an Anglican clergyman. Maxfield was ordained priest by William Barnard, bishop of Derry, on John Wesley's recommendation. Barnard, who for reasons of health was then living in Bath, received Maxfield with the words, &#145;I ordain you, to assist that good man, that he may not work himself to death&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of John Wesley</span>, 21.409). Maxfield combined his Methodist itinerancy with the office of chaplain to Lady Huntingdon, and also had a pronounced influence on Thomas Coke, who was to become one of John Wesley's most loyal Anglican colleagues.<br>
<br>The 1760s saw the development of a painful rift between Maxfield and John and Charles Wesley. John felt it particularly strongly, since he admired Maxfield's gifts and had sought to give him the fullest scope for their exercise. Moreover, the dispute touched Wesley at a sensitive point, in that it involved the understanding of Christian perfection, a doctrine on which he placed prime emphasis. In 1760 Wesley appointed Maxfield to meet weekly with a select group of Methodists who professed to have reached a state of &#145;entire sanctification&#146;. They began to claim direct divine inspiration through dreams and visions. Maxfield, according to Wesley, far from exercising a sobering influence, encouraged their &#145;enthusiasm&#146;. In October 1762 Wesley recorded &#145;I found the society in an uproar and several of Mr. M[axfield]'s most intimate friends formed into a detached body. Enthusiasm, pride, and great uncharitableness appeared in many who once had much grace&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of John Wesley</span>, 21.410). The dispute involved claims by Maxfield's followers that Christians should expect absolute sinless perfection in this life, as against Wesley's insistence on continuing weaknesses and infirmities, &#145;sin in believers&#146;. Some of the Maxfield group claimed they would never die, and one, George Bell, prophesied that the world would end on 28 February 1763&#151;a prophecy which Maxfield endorsed. Wesley reacted strongly against these extravagances, and in his journal for 7 January 1763, recorded:<blockquote>At this time I did not want information that Mr. M.[axfield] was at the bottom of all this; that he was the life of the cause; that he was continually spiriting up all with whom he was intimate against me; that he told them I was not capable of teaching them and insinuated that none was but himself; and that the inevitable consequence must be a division in the society. (<span class="italic">Works of John Wesley</span>, 21.403)</blockquote>Eventually, some 200 Methodists left Wesley's London society and Maxfield severed connection with his erstwhile leader on 28 April 1763. Contemporary evidence suggests that Maxfield's growing consciousness of his considerable gifts, his enhanced status as Wesley's lieutenant and an ordained clergyman, together with the large fortune brought him by his wife Elizabeth Branford (<i>d</i>. 1777) may have enhanced his sense of independence of the Wesleys. He had certainly outgrown the status of a &#145;son in the gospel&#146;, and appears to have been reluctant to accept the role of &#145;fellow-labourer&#146;. Wesley, deeply hurt by Maxfield's conduct, recorded in his journal for 23 April 1763: &#145;From this time, he has spoke all manner of evil of <i>me</i>, his father, his friend, his greatest earthly benefactor&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of John Wesley</span>, 21.411). In his <span class="italic">Vindication of the Rev. Mr Maxfield's conduct</span> (1767) Maxfield rebutted Wesley's charges, though the evidence against him does not derive solely from Wesley. Among others John Fletcher, the saintly vicar of Madeley, corroborates the charges of spiritual pride against Maxfield and Bell. Fletcher wrote of Maxfield, in a letter to Wesley dated 9 September 1763: &#145;I believe him [Maxfield] sincere; and, though obstinate and suspicious, I am persuaded he has a true desire to know the will, and live the life of God&#146;  (Tyerman, 2.464).<br>
<br>Maxfield became minister to a society in Snow's Fields, London, and then moved to a meeting-house in Ropemakers' Alley, Moorfields, where he had a large congregation. His final preaching place was at Princes Street, Moorfields, where he ministered until about 1767. In the following decade he published a <span class="italic">Collection of Psalms and Hymns Extracted from Various Authors</span> (1778) and several accounts of pious deaths, including that of his wife, who died on 23 November 1777. In February 1770, at Lady Huntingdon's house in Portland Row, Wesley met Maxfield, who preached against Christian perfection, the doctrine he had previously so earnestly advocated. There were attempts at reconciliation from both sides, but the breach was never healed. There was, however, in time some softening of attitude on both sides. Charles Atmore records of Maxfield that, &#145;For some years before his death, he became very friendly with the Methodists; the preachers frequently supplied his chapel and preached to his congregation&#146;  (Atmore, 269). Wesley recorded a later visit in his journal for 21 December 1782 after Maxfield had been struck with a violent stroke of palsy: &#145;He was senseless and seemed near death. But we besought God for him, and his spirit revived, I cannot but think, in answer to prayer.&#146; On 2 February 1783 he noted, &#145;Mr. Maxfield continuing ill, I preached this afternoon at his chapel. Prejudice seems now dying away. God grant it may never revive&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of John Wesley</span>, 23.261&#150;2). Maxfield died at his home in Moorfields on 18 March 1784.<br>
