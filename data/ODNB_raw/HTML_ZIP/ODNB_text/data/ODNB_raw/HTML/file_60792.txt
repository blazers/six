<span class="headword">Tarleton,  John</span>  (1755&#150;1841), <span class="occ">merchant and politician</span>, was born at Liverpool, the third of the seven children of John Tarleton (1719&#150;1773), a merchant, and Jane Parker (1726&#150;1797), daughter and coheir of Banastre Parker of Cuerden, Lancashire. At his death the elder John Tarleton left an estate worth some &pound;80,000, of which &pound;5000 went to his son. Where the younger John was educated is unknown, but three of his brothers&#151;Thomas, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26970/', "Banastre Tarleton")</script>, and Clayton&#151;went to Oxford University.<br>
<br>Tarleton became a freeman of Liverpool in January 1777 and went on to become a leading West Indian and African trader. By 1785 he had an office in Duke Street and was a partner in the firm of Tarleton and Backhouse; the other partners included his brothers Thomas and Clayton, and Daniel Backhouse. Through Tarleton and Backhouse his standing in Liverpool rose substantially, and in 1788 he was one of the delegation of Liverpool merchants who attended parliament to give evidence on the state of the African slave trade. In the same year he had a meeting with the prime minister, William Pitt the younger, but failed to persuade him to abandon his support for the abolitionist cause. Recounting this meeting to Clayton Tarleton, he expressed his fears for the future of the trade, &#145;except we can prove that it is not carried on with that shocking inhumanity that is imagined by all ranks of mankind out of doors&#146;  (Tarleton MS 920 TAR 4/5).<br>
<br>Despite failing to prevent parliament from regulating the slave trade in 1788, Tarleton and Backhouse remained a prominent investor in slaving voyages. Between 1786 and 1804 the firm backed forty ships, many intended for the African trade. In March 1790, with monetary interests of some &pound;85,000, Tarleton and Backhouse was the third largest investor at Liverpool in slaving voyages. Throughout the 1790s Tarleton seems to have been a regular partner in the firm, though he left it temporarily in 1792 after a &#145;very violent quarrel&#146;  (Tarleton MS 920 TAR 4/26) with Backhouse. The earnings it achieved are difficult to calculate, but one writer, referring to Thomas Tarleton, claimed that &#145;two scions of the Old Stile House&#146;, a former residence of Edward Tarleton (1620&#150;1690), &#145;formed a partnership with a third individual, in July 1776, each advancing &pound;5000&#146;, and in &#145;the course of less than twenty-seven years, their gains amounted to &pound;233,633&#146;  (Herdman, 16). In 1792 alone &pound;68,406 was said to have &#145;appeared to their credit&#146;  (ibid.). However, one cannot be sure that these claims are accurate or that they relate to Tarleton and Backhouse. Surviving accounts for the firm suggest, nevertheless, that it had a healthy balance sheet during its life.<br>
<br>While remaining active in trade, Tarleton's interests shifted towards politics and real estate during the 1790s. Having joined the Whig Club in 1787, he stood for the Cinque Ports parliamentary seat of Seaford in 1790 as a Pelhamite whig. Beaten in the election, he was seated on petition on 19 March 1792. In parliament he remained a staunch opponent of abolition and also opposed the <span class="roman">Liverpool Corporation Loan Bill</span> in 1793, though he did not vote against the government on any major issue in 1792&#150;6. Declaring himself a &#145;decided supporter of the general measures of the present administration&#146;  (Port and Thorne), he stood at Liverpool in the 1796 parliamentary elections, thereby challenging his brother Banastre, who was one of the two sitting members for the constituency. His campaign was tarnished by accusations that he had failed to pay debts of &pound;3000 arising from the Seaford election and charges of &#145;unbrotherly&#146; conduct. Unsupported by any of his close family, he finished bottom of the poll. This crushing defeat ended his political ambitions and may, temporarily at least, have caused a rift with his family; his mother and brother Clayton died in 1797 and, of their close relatives, only John was denied a bequest in their wills.<br>
<br>His political hopes thwarted, Tarleton devoted the rest of his life to his family and his real estate interests. On 26 October 1790 he married Isabella (<i>c</i>.1770&#150;<i>c</i>.1850), daughter and heir of Alexander Collingwood of Unthank and Little Ryle, near Alnham, Northumberland. They had four children, all born in Liverpool between 1792 and 1806. On marrying, he began to seek a country residence outside Liverpool, and by 1796 was described as a gentleman living at Finch House, West Derby, Lancashire. One authority claims that he &#145;failed in business and went to Holland&#146;  (Stewart-Brown, 63), but this has not been verified. In later years, however, he inherited the Collingwood estates in Northumberland and also acquired property in Gloucester Place, London.<br>
<br>John Tarleton died on 20 September 1841 at 14 Grove Terrace, London, and was buried at St Pancras. He was survived by his wife.<br>
