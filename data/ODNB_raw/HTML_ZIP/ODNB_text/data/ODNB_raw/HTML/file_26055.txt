<span class="headword">Southey,  Henry Herbert</span>  (1784&#150;1865), <span class="occ">physician</span>, son of Robert Southey (1745&#150;1792), linen draper, and Margaret Hill (1752&#150;1802), and younger brother of the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26056/', "Robert Southey")</script>, was born at Bristol on 17 January 1784. He was educated at private schools in and around Great Yarmouth, and in particular with George Burnett, a Unitarian minister in Great Yarmouth, and with Mr Maurice of Normanstown, near Lowestoft. His older brother Robert wanted to bring him up to his house in London so that he could study anatomy under Sir Anthony Carlisle at Westminster Hospital and go on to university at Edinburgh or in Germany. This plan fell through and Henry studied at Norwich under Philip Meadows Martineau, uncle of Harriet Martineau and a distinguished surgeon. While there he became friendly with William Taylor, a Unitarian, who supervised his extra-professional studies. In November 1803 he entered Edinburgh University to study medicine. There he made lifelong friends with a group of fellow medical students, William Knighton, Lockyer of Plymouth, Fearon of Sunderland, and Robert Gooch; the five of them acquired an unusual facility in colloquial Latin and used to speak it together. Southey also wrote Latin elegantly, a skill highly prized at the time, and rarely travelled without a copy of Horace or Virgil in his pocket. He graduated MD on 24 June 1806, producing an interesting dissertation on the origins and course of syphilis which suggested an American origin for the disease.<br>
<br>Southey then studied for a year at one of the London hospitals, as was common on graduating from Edinburgh, and in 1807 settled in Durham as a general physician, although the opportunities were limited. In 1812 he moved back to London on the advice of Knighton and became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians on 22 December 1812. In 1814 he published &#145;Observations on pulmonary consumption&#146;, which may have helped in his attempt to obtain a position in one of the London hospitals. Southey was finally elected physician to the Middlesex Hospital on 17 August 1815, and four days later married his first wife, Louisa Gonne (<i>d</i>. 1830), at St Leonard's Church, Streatham. Southey remained at the Middlesex until April 1827. In the meantime, owing to considerable support from Knighton, he was appointed physician-in-ordinary to George IV in 1823, and in 1830 physician-extraordinary to Queen Adelaide. He became FRCP on 25 June 1823 and he took on a variety of roles in the college throughout his life. He was elected FRS on 25 April 1825. In 1828, on the recommendation of Sir Henry Halford, he was appointed a metropolitan lunacy commissioner under the 1828 <span class="roman">Madhouse Act</span>, one of the reasons being that although he had a reputation as a good physician with a knowledge of mental illness he was not &#145;overwhelmed with private practice&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1830 Southey's wife, Louisa, died in childbirth, little Louisa being their tenth child. This left him in a desperate position, both financially and in terms of pursuing a career. His role as a metropolitan lunacy commissioner paid only expenses. However, by mid-1833 he had met and married his second wife, Clara (1798&#150;1858), and although they went on to have a further five children his appointment the same year as a lord chancellor's medical visitor in lunacy, with a salary of &pound;1500, gave him the financial security he needed. Writing in July to thank his friend Lord Brougham for appointing him, he commented, this &#145;will relieve me from pecuniary anxiety for the rest of my life&#146;. Together with John Bright he simultaneously held office in the Lord Chancellor's Department and the metropolitan lunacy commission until 1845. In that year Southey was named as one of the full-time lunacy commissioners under Lord Shaftesbury's <span class="roman">Lunacy Act</span>, but it was clear that he could not perform the duties of both salaried posts. He promptly resigned from the new commission, preferring to remain a lord chancellor's visitor in lunacy, a post he held until his death. From 1834 to 1865 he was also Gresham professor of medicine, and on 16 June 1847 was created honorary DCL at Oxford.<br>
<br>As a young man Southey was noted for his good looks, athletic prowess, and fondness for field sports. He was an accomplished society physician, discreet, polite, and with a kind heart. Despite only a short period of practice in the north of England he attracted the support of a number of great aristocratic families there. He was also the grateful recipient of three significant legacies from non-relatives, a testament to his popularity. He was one of a number of London physicians who built up private practices which they extended to the private care of the mentally ill, but most importantly he helped carve out a strong role for the lord chancellor's medical visitors. This body ensured a high degree of privacy for wealthy families with mentally ill relatives, although it came into conflict with Lord Shaftesbury's lunacy commission. Southey was one of those who opposed amalgamation of the two authorities.<br>
<br>In June 1858 Southey's second wife, Clara, died at their home in Queen Anne Street, Cavendish Square, London. He himself died at 1 Harley Street on 13 June 1865 and was buried in Highgate cemetery.<br>
