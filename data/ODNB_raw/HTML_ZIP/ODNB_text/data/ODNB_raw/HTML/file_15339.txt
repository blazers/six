<span class="headword">Kempt, Sir  James</span>  (1763/4&#150;1854), <span class="occ">army officer and governor-in-chief of British North America</span>, was born between December 1763 and December 1764 in Edinburgh, the son of Gavin Kempt and his wife, the daughter of Alexander Walker of Edinburgh. Although nothing is known about his early life, he was gazetted ensign in the 101st foot in March 1783 and lieutenant the following year. After the regiment's disbandment in 1785, Kempt remained on half pay until 1794, when he was commissioned captain and then major in the 113th foot. When that regiment was broken up, he served briefly as inspecting field officer of recruiting at Glasgow, and in 1796 was again placed on half pay. In 1799 he became aide-de-camp to Sir Ralph Abercromby, commander of troops in north Britain, whom he accompanied with expeditionary forces to Holland and the Mediterranean. On Abercromby's death in 1801, Kempt joined the staff of John Hely-Hutchinson for the rest of the Egyptian campaign. In 1803 he was appointed aide-de-camp to David Dundas, commanding the southern district in England; later that year he obtained the lieutenant-colonelcy of the 81st foot, and served in 1805&#150;6 in Naples and Sicily under Sir James Henry Craig. From 1807 to 1811 Kempt was quartermaster-general in British North America and in 1809 advanced to colonel. Between 1811 and 1814 he served on the staff of Wellington's army in Spain and France, with the rank of major-general. In June 1814 he commanded one of the brigades dispatched from Bordeaux to reinforce British troops in the Canadas during war with the United States. Kempt returned to Europe on Napoleon's escape from Elba and commanded the 8th brigade at the battle of Waterloo. In acknowledgement of his wartime services he received a string of British and foreign decorations, the KCB and GCB in 1815, and the GCH in 1816. He held the lieutenant-governorship of the garrison at Fort William from 1813 and at Portsmouth from 1819. He was colonel successively of the 60th foot (1813), the 3rd West India regiment (1818), the 81st foot (1819), and the 40th foot (1829). He was promoted lieutenant-general in 1825 and general in 1841.<br>
<br>Like other Wellingtonian officers, Kempt was drawn into the post-war colonial service. He was appointed in 1819 lieutenant-governor of Nova Scotia on the promotion of his friend Lord Dalhousie to governor-in-chief of British North America. Although Dalhousie forewarned him of conflict with provincial politicians, particularly over financial matters, Kempt's conciliatory manner enabled him to preserve harmonious relations with the legislature. He managed to postpone serious consideration of the British government's disruptive proposal in 1825 that the assembly should be invited to vote a civil list, covering the salaries of leading officials, in exchange for control over crown revenues. Religious disputes, especially over higher education, proved more troublesome. The Anglican exclusiveness of King's College, Windsor, had been challenged by Dalhousie's inauguration in 1818 of a non-sectarian college in Halifax, modelled on the University of Edinburgh. Although a building was begun in 1820, the debt-ridden institution remained moribund. In vain Kempt urged the colonial secretary, Lord Bathurst, a fervent Anglican, to sanction a special grant from crown revenues. Kempt also failed to secure funds from a legislature facing similar demands from King's College and Presbyterian Pictou Academy. His constructive initiative to amalgamate King's and Dalhousie won local endorsement in 1824 but was vetoed by the archbishop of Canterbury, with Bathurst's acquiescence.<br>
<br>In 1828 Kempt was dispatched by the British authorities on a military mission to inspect the building of the Rideau Canal in Upper Canada, where the expenditures contracted by the chief engineer, Lieutenant-Colonel John By, had spiralled alarmingly out of control. On his return to Halifax that summer, Kempt received word of his appointment as governor-in-chief, following the hasty removal of Dalhousie amid a political storm in Lower Canada and at Westminster, where a Commons select committee was investigating his conduct. Kempt viewed with mixed feelings the promotion he had long expected and the task of dealing with a formidable crisis arising chiefly from a protracted, bitter dispute over the appropriation of revenues. He temporarily eased the deadlock by practising calm forbearance and by making tactical concessions to the legislature in the hope that parliament would soon provide a permanent settlement. The recipient of vague, contradictory instructions and much criticism from the Colonial Office, he was relieved to surrender his responsibilities to Lord Aylmer in October 1830. Kempt's success as governor in cultivating a degree of harmony stemmed in part from qualities of character and personality and from a deliberately non-partisan approach to colonial politics. An affable and highly sociable individual, his tact and common sense won widespread respect and co-operation. Kempt was also favoured by circumstances, administrating both colonies during interludes between political strife.<br>
<br>On arrival in England, Kempt became master-general of the Board of Ordnance, with a seat on the privy council, but determined to stay out of parliament and party politics. In addition to departmental duties, he served on royal commissions in 1833&#150;4 to investigate military punishments and the civil administration of the army, objecting in the latter instance to any change in the powers of the Ordnance. He retired from public life in December 1834, though his name was mentioned in 1835 and again in 1837 for a Canadian appointment. He died, unmarried, in South Audley Street, London, on 20 December 1854, leaving in his will gifts totalling &pound;59,800 and &pound;675 in annuities to various relatives and friends.<br>
