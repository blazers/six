<span class="headword">Phillimore, Sir  Richard Fortescue</span>  (1864&#150;1940), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Boconnoc, Cornwall, on 23 December 1864, the eldest of the six sons and one daughter of Admiral Sir Augustus Phillimore (1822&#150;1897), who was commander-in-chief at Plymouth from 1884 to 1887, and his wife, Harriet Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1924), second daughter of George Matthew Fortescue, and cousin of Hugh, third Earl Fortescue. He was a first cousin of Walter Phillimore, first Baron Phillimore. He was educated at Westminster School, and he then entered the Royal Navy as a cadet on the training ship <i>Britannia</i> in 1878. He became a midshipman in 1880, sub-lieutenant in 1884, and was promoted lieutenant from the royal yacht in 1886. He became a gunnery officer and was gunnery lieutenant of the <i>Invincible</i> and successively of the cruisers <i>Phaeton</i> in the Mediterranean, <i>Aeolus</i> in China, and <i>Furious</i> in the channel squadron, whence he was promoted commander in 1899.<br>
<br>As executive officer of the battleship <i>Goliath</i>, Phillimore took part in the operations against the Boxer uprising in China in 1900, receiving the China medal. From January 1904 he commanded the cruiser <i>Mohawk</i> in the Indian Ocean, and during the operations in Somaliland of that year he landed in command of the machine guns of the naval brigade and took part in the capture of Illig. Promoted captain in June 1904, he later commanded the cruiser <i>Juno</i> in the Home Fleet, <i>Aboukir</i> in the Mediterranean, and the battle cruiser <i>Inflexible</i> in the Home Fleet. On 21 December 1905 he married Violet Gore (<i>d</i>. 1963), youngest daughter of Henry Hobhouse Turton, banker. They had three sons and one daughter. In 1912 Phillimore became chief of staff to Admiral Sir A. Berkeley Milne, commander-in-chief, Mediterranean, with the rank of commodore, second class, from 1913, and he was holding that post at the outbreak of war in 1914.<br>
<br>After the escape of the German battle cruiser <i>Goeben</i>, Milne was recalled from the Mediterranean, and Phillimore took over command of the <i>Inflexible</i>. In November 1914, with her sister ship the <i>Invincible</i>, she was sent to the south Atlantic under Vice-Admiral Sir F. C. D. Sturdee, and after arriving at the Falkland Islands destroyed the German squadron under Admiral Graf von Spee. The <i>Inflexible</i> then returned to the Mediterranean and became the flagship of Vice-Admiral S. H. Carden at the Dardanelles. In the attack on the Turkish forts in March 1915 she came under heavy fire which wrecked her bridge and foretop, and she also struck a mine, so that she was in danger of sinking, and was &#145;only saved by the fine seamanship of her Captain&#146;  (Marder, 2.246). Phillimore managed to get her to an anchorage off Tenedos where she was patched up sufficiently for her to return to Malta for repair, making the passage stern first. While she was out of action he became principal beach master at the Gallipoli landing, earning a mention in dispatches; later, he was principal naval transport officer at Mudros, the advanced base for the Gallipoli operations.<br>
<br>Promoted rear-admiral in August 1915, Phillimore was sent to Russia as head of a British naval mission; in that capacity he was in constant close contact with the tsar, travelled to every part of the Russian front, and was on board the Russian flagship at the bombardment of Varna in October 1916. He remained in Russia until the following December, when he was given command of the first battle cruiser squadron of the Grand Fleet, with his flag in the <i>Repulse</i>. While holding that command he took a leading part in developing the use of aircraft carried in ships of the fleet; and he was also again in action. In November 1917 his flagship supported, under difficult and dangerous conditions, the British light cruisers chasing German light cruisers into the Heligoland bight, and was commended by Admiral Beatty for his &#145;determined support&#146;  (Marder, 4.305).<br>
<br>In 1918 Phillimore took over command of the aircraft-carriers of the Grand Fleet, with the title of admiral commanding aircraft, flying his flag in the cruiser <i>Furious</i>, which had been partially converted by the addition of a flying-off deck in place of her fore turret; he held that command for the remainder of the war. In this position he also developed for the Admiralty what Roskill describes as an innovative and &#145;full and far-sighted report on the Navy's future requirements for ship-borne aircraft and on their functions&#146;  (Roskill, 1.114).<br>
<br>That was Phillimore's last service at sea. He was promoted vice-admiral in 1920 and then commanded the Reserve Fleet until 1922. From 1923 to 1926 he was commander-in-chief at Plymouth, being promoted admiral in 1924. He was first and principal naval aide-de-camp to the king from 1928 until compulsorily retired in 1929. He was appointed MVO in 1905, CB in 1914, KCMG in 1918, KCB in 1919, and GCB in 1929; he also held both Russian and Japanese orders. Most clearly remembered by contemporaries was Phillimore's lack of fear and what Sir Roger Keyes referred to as his &#145;indomitable&#146; spirit. After his retirement he lived at Shedfield House, near Botley, Hampshire, and became involved in local government. He died at Shedfield House on 8 November 1940 and was buried at Shedfield on 12 November.<br>
