<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mason,  John Monck</span>  (1726?&#150;1809), <span class="occ">literary scholar and politician</span>, eldest son of Robert Mason of Mason-Brook, co. Galway, and Sarah, eldest daughter of George Monck of St Stephen's Green, Dublin, was born in Dublin. After attending Mr Young's school in Dublin, he entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 12 August 1741, graduated BA in 1746 and proceeded MA in 1761. He was called to the Irish bar from the Middle Temple in 1752 and in 1761 was elected to the Irish House of Commons. There he represented Blessington, co. Wicklow, from 1761 to 1768 and 1769 to 1776, and St Canice, co. Kilkenny, from 1776 to 1800. On 11 July 1766 he married Catherine, the second daughter of Henry Mitchell of Glasnevin, co. Dublin. They had no children.<br>
<br>In 1765 Mason was appointed a commissioner of barracks for Dublin, and in 1772 a commissioner of revenue, a position he held until 1795, whereupon he became a commissioner of the Treasury. In 1761 he had introduced a bill allowing Catholics to invest money in mortgages on land, which was rejected by the English privy council. The same bill failed when introduced again in 1772 and 1773. A staunch supporter of the administration, Mason became so unpopular that in 1779, during the free trade agitation, he feared for his life and would not attend the house. He was, however, gratified to be made a privy councillor on 23 December 1783. He retired in 1799 on a pension of &pound;1200 p.a. and voted for the Union in the last Irish parliament.<br>
<br>Mason combined his parliamentary activities with a deep interest in Elizabethan drama. He first came to notice with a four-volume edition of the plays of Philip Massinger, an inauspicious beginning, as his edition was fraught with errors and was severely criticized. The reviewer for the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>  (1st ser., 49, February 1779, 887&#150;8) praised Tom Davies's account of Massinger, prefixed to the edition, but wasted no word on the edition itself. Not so the reviewer for the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span>, who was merciless from the first paragraph on. Acknowledging that he had never heard of Mason before but had learned that he was one of the commissioners of revenue in Ireland, he sincerely hoped that<blockquote>he has more knowledge of his <i>Majesty's customs</i> than those of the <i>drama</i>. To be plain, and to use the mildest terms we can think of, we do not remember, since the commencement of our literary labours, to have had any work pass through our hands, in which we have found such absolute insufficiency in an editor, joined with such perfect confidence and self-complacency. (<span class="italic">Critical Review</span>, 47, April 1779, 293&#150;300)</blockquote>Mason next planned a complete edition of Shakespeare's plays but was beaten to it by the publication of Isaac Reed's edition in 1785. Mason confined himself to <span class="italic">Comments on the Last Edition of Shakespeare's Plays</span> (1785), that consisted of remarks, notes, and corrections to Reed's text. In the preface he blamed the errors in his edition of Massinger on &#145;the negligence of the person entrusted with the conduct of it&#146;  (J. M. Mason, <span class="italic">Comments</span>, x).<br>
<br>Mason's scholarly reputation and abilities were viewed ambivalently by his contemporaries. His fellow Shakespearian scholar, George Steevens, in the advertisement prefixed to his own edition of Shakespeare's plays of 1793, noted that he included &#145;a large proportion of Mr. Monck Mason's strictures on a former edition of Shakespeare&#146;, namely Reed's, although &#145;a small number of his proposed emendations are suppressed through honest commiseration&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Plays of William Shakespeare</span>, ed. S. Johnson and G. Steevens, 15 vols., 1793, 1.x). None the less, Steevens incorporated a number of Mason's notes in the edition. In a letter to Bishop Thomas Percy, dated 11 January 1788, Steevens blew hot and cold. Mason, he wrote,<blockquote>is often ingenious and sometimes right; but occasionally outdoes even Dr. Warburton in absurdity of conjecture. There is also somewhat of ferocity in his manner which had better been avoided. Still, with all his extravagances, I must allow that he is a man of thinking and erudition. (Nichols, <span class="italic">Illustrations</span>, 7.1)</blockquote>Percy, in a letter to Edmond Malone, dated 3 July 1785, told him:<blockquote>We have a Volume of Criticism by M<sup>r</sup> Monck Mason, who never saw one ancient Edition. I have promised to lend him the 1 st and 3<sup>d</sup> <i>folios</i>, and some of the <i>Quartos</i>, &amp;&amp;. You will then see what he makes of them. (<span class="italic">Percy Letters</span>, 1.28)</blockquote>If Mason made use of the folios, he did not think it incumbent upon him to acknowledge Percy's kindness when he re-edited his <span class="italic">Comments on &hellip; Shakespeare</span> in 1807. Francis Douce praised Mason's Shakespearian efforts, aligning him with Steevens, Malone, and Thomas Tyrwhitt, the great editors of the eighteenth century, in his <span class="italic">Illustrations of Shakespeare and Ancient Manners</span> (1807). Mason's <span class="italic">Comments</span> of 1785 and 1807 have not been entirely forgotten by the editors of the twentieth-century variorum editions of Shakespeare's plays.<br>
<br>Mason also published <span class="italic">Comments on the Plays of Beaumont and Fletcher</span> (1798), which he dedicated to Steevens, despite their differences over the Shakespeare editions. This work won praise from the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span>, but Mason was criticized as &#145;rather deficient in his acquaintance with old English books&#151;the only source from which our authors of the 17th century can be illustrated&#146;  (<span class="italic">Critical Review</span>, new ser., 32, June 1800, 155). He was a member of the Dublin Society from 1768 and of the Royal Irish Academy from 1792. He died in Dublin on 2 April 1809.<br>
