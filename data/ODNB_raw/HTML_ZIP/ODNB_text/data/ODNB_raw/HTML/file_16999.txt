<span class="headword">Lonsdale,  Henry</span>  (1816&#150;1876), <span class="occ">physician and biographer</span>, was born in St Mary, Carlisle, on 25 February 1816, the son of Henry Lonsdale, a tradesman there, and his wife, Hannah. After attending a local school he was apprenticed in 1831 to Messrs Anderson and Hodgson, at that time the leading medical practitioners in Carlisle. In 1834 he went on to study medicine at Edinburgh, and after a very successful course was in his third year appointed assistant to Robert Knox (1791&#150;1862), the anatomist, whose biographer he later became, and also to John Reid, the physiologist. Lonsdale studied during the summer of 1838 in Paris; he also went to London, and became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons and licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries. On his return to Edinburgh in 1838 he graduated MD; his thesis, &#145;An experimental inquiry into the nature of hydrocyanic acid&#146;, was printed in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal</span> in 1839.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1838 Lonsdale, who was suffering from overwork, took temporary charge of a country practice at Raughton Head, Cumberland, where he helped to found the Inglewood Agricultural Society, a monthly club and the first of its kind in the county. He also gave a course of popular lectures on science, and he became interested in the work of Susanna Blamire, &#145;the muse of Cumberland&#146;, whose poems he subsequently collected. In 1840 he returned to Edinburgh, and from May of that year he was a partner with his former principal, Robert Knox, giving a daily demonstration in anatomy in the classroom and managing the dissecting rooms. In 1841 he was appointed physician to the Royal Public Dispensary, where for the first time in Edinburgh he introduced the use of cod-liver oil. During an epidemic of relapsing fever in Edinburgh in 1843, he took charge of the largest district, and when the health of his three assistants broke down he did the work single-handed.<br>
<br>Lonsdale was admitted fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, in 1851, and at one of their monthly meetings he read the paper &#145;On the terminal loops of the nerves in the brain and spinal cord of man&#146;. These loops, which he had discovered when examining an infant suffering from deformities, he exhibited under a powerful microscope. The history of the case was recorded in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal</span> in 1843 and attracted some attention. Lonsdale was soon afterwards appointed a senior president of the Royal Medical Society, to which he made a notable contribution on diphtheria, based chiefly on observations of the disease at Raughton Head. He was also for two sessions the senior president of the Hunterian Medical Society, and was at the same time senior president of the Anatomical and Physiological Society, which had been resuscitated by Knox and himself.<br>
<br>In 1845 Lonsdale's increasing susceptibility to bronchitis induced him to relinquish his growing practice in Edinburgh and to return to Carlisle, where he settled in the autumn of 1845. In 1846 he was appointed physician to the Cumberland Infirmary, an office which he held for twenty-two years. Lonsdale attributed an epidemic of scurvy occurring in a district north of Carlisle to the lack of vegetables following the potato blight of 1846. His observations enabled him to dismiss the theories of Robert Christison, who had assigned the disease to a defective supply of milk, and to reassert the traditional explanation for scurvy. When in the winter of 1847&#150;8 cholera seemed to be threatening western Europe, Lonsdale established a sanitary association in Carlisle. He contributed many articles promoting the <span class="roman">Health of Towns Act</span> to the <span class="italic">Journal of Public Health</span>, a London periodical supported by the early sanitary reformers. His report on the health of Carlisle was quoted with commendation in the House of Commons by Lord Morpeth. A careful essay which Lonsdale wrote on the health of bakers also attracted notice and was reprinted in <span class="italic">Chambers's London Journal</span>.<br>
<br>In 1851 Lonsdale married Eliza Indiana, only daughter of John Smith Bond, of Rose Hill, near Carlisle, whose residence subsequently became his own. After his marriage Lonsdale occupied himself in reading, travelling in southern and eastern Europe, interesting himself in Italian art and archaeology, and collecting materials for the biographical studies that he undertook. The writing of biographies of a number of local notables and medical practitioners became his main work during the 1860s. After producing several individual works, he published in 1867 the first volume of his <span class="italic">Worthies of Cumberland</span>, a six-volume series of short biographies. In them he attempted to avoid political bias and aimed to pursue the &#145;brevity, conciseness of arrangement, and the use of terse and simple language&#146; which he felt suited to the region's character  (Lonsdale, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, vol. 1, preface). The collection was well received by contemporaries.<br>
<br>Lonsdale died at Rose Hill on 23 July 1876, and was buried on 27 July in Stanwix churchyard. He left three sons and three daughters. A man of genial and kindly temperament, Lonsdale was in politics a philosophical radical, and took a special interest in the cause of Italian unity. He helped to collect subscriptions for Garibaldi's expedition to Sicily in 1860, and was the friend of Mazzini and Kossuth, as well as of Garibaldi.<br>
