<span class="headword">Bancroft,  Thomas</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1613&#150;1658), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born at Swarkston, Derbyshire, and matriculated at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, at Easter 1613. Alluded to in contemporary records as the &#145;small poet&#146;, he was known to be living at Bradley, Derbyshire, in 1658. His published works are <span class="italic">The Glutton's Feaver</span> (1633), <span class="italic">Two Books of Epigrammes and Epitaphs</span> (1639), a romance in eight cantos entitled <span class="italic">The Heroical Lover</span> (1658), and a collection of twenty satires, <span class="italic">Times out of Tune</span> (1658). <span class="italic">The Glutton's Feaver</span>, written in the first person from the perspective of the repentant glutton, places him in a series of trials and punishments for his past error-strewn years; atonement follows, as the glutton is made to see his mistaken ways. The <span class="italic">Two Bookes of Epigrammes and Epitaphs</span> are similar in tone to <span class="italic">The Glutton's Feaver</span>, and in all the book contains 480 short pieces. Some lighter compositions are to members of the Knyveton family, one to Swarkston village, and another to the Trent River, yet most continue the ashen view of life seen in his earlier work. His epigram &#145;Of Human Life&#146; is a model of his early pessimism:<blockquote>
<div>If life be but a thread, then why not<br>
</div>
<div>Sharpe misery be th' needle, death the knot?<br>
</div> (epigram 179, book 2)</blockquote>The satires found in <span class="italic">Times out of Tune, Plaid upon However in XX Satyres</span> are against sectaries; the abuse of poetry; presumption; pride in apparel; lying; vanity; discord; weakness; falsehood in friendship; gluttony; excess in drinking; ambition; whoredom; voluptuousness; timidity; detraction; injustice; cruelty; and discontentedness. Given that they are written against largely abstract concepts, they lack the precision or venom of those by other authors targeted against individuals. If the subjects chosen seem to leave no aspect of unbuttoned human life to enjoy, the author was aware that whatever his disapprobation, human nature would still indulge. His most amiable work is <span class="italic">The Heroical Lover</span>, a romance in which the hero Antheon seeks his queen Fidelta. The poem shows little interest in love <i>per se</i>, and the plot is basically a means of exploring Bancroft's interests in geography and vulcanology. Each canto sees Antheon in another country, though the geographical progress defies common sense. Borrowing from <span class="italic">The Odyssey</span> each country provides Antheon with female temptation, which he stoically refuses, preferring to return to his quest to find Fidelta. Antheon is also equipped with the arts of war, able to lay siege or to attack, yet spends his journey somewhat restlessly. He travels first to Italy and the Roman campagna, and is tempted by a &#145;Lady of the Lake&#146; before moving to France. After a further temptation offered by a woman at court he goes to Spain, passing across the &#145;<i>Pyrenean</i> hills&#146;, before he meets Sordezza, &#145;That Harpy-like, Hell-raking Sorceress&#146;. A further canto is set in Greece, before his journey to Sicily: here &#145;Aetna&#146; is described. The penultimate canto finds Antheon in Belgium, plied with alcohol and tobacco, which again he refuses, before his first meeting with Fidelta in a land called Eutopia (not far from Atlantis).<br>
<br>An encounter with Bancroft's lighter work, with its excitement over geography and volcanoes, represents an interesting supplement to a reading of the lengthy texts devoted to his main areas of interest with their various measures of disapprobation.<br>
