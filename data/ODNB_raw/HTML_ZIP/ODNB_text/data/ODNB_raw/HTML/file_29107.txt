<span class="headword">Westall,  William</span>  (1781&#150;1850), <span class="occ">painter and engraver</span>, was born on 12 October 1781, in Hertford, the son of Benjamin Westall (1736&#150;1794) a brewer, and his second wife, Martha, (1752&#150;1806) daughter of Henry Harbord of Norwich. He was the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29106/', "Richard Westall RA")</script>. William attended schools in Sydenham and Hampstead, exhibiting early an artistic talent. His first known drawing, of Kelso church, was made when he was fourteen. He was taught by his elder brother, Richard, until he became a probationer at the Royal Academy in 1799. In that year he was engaged as landscape draughtsman for a voyage to New Holland (Australia) and the south seas under the command of Matthew Flinders. The painter and traveller William Daniell had signed up for the voyage but decided to stay in England to marry Westall's half-sister, Mary.<br>
<br>Under Flinders's command the <i>Investigator</i> set sail on 18 July 1801, calling at Madeira and the Cape and arrived off the west coast of Australia on 6 December. Moving along the west and south coasts with occasional stops for visits ashore, the ship spent four weeks in St George's Sound. Westall's oil painting of part of the sound showing two Aborigines making a fire was based on this experience. In February a disaster befell eight members of the crew who were lost when returning from shore. Westall's sketches later resulted in an oil painting <span class="italic">The Entrance to Port Lincoln from behind Memory Cove</span> (exh. Royal Academy, 1812) where Flinders had commemorated the lost crew members.<br>
<br>In May 1802 the <i>Investigator</i> arrived in Sydney and Westall sketched Government House from Sydney Cove. Leaving in late July, they sailed up the east coast. A painting by Westall of the view from the summit of a mountain named after him by Flinders was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1810. In August 1802, Flinders discovered Port Bowen, Queensland; Westall's <span class="italic">View of Port Bowen</span> was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1812. After carrying out a survey of the Gulf of Carpentaria, where Westall completed sketches on which his <span class="italic">View of Sir Edward Pellew's Group, Gulf of Carpentaria</span> (exh. Royal Academy, 1812) was based, Flinders called at Timor (of which Westall made at least two drawings) and found that the condition of his vessel made a rapid return to Sydney imperative. They sailed via the west and south coasts, during which journey six deaths occurred due to illness. On reaching Sydney the <i>Investigator</i> was deemed unseaworthy.<br>
<br>Westall sailed for England on the <i>Porpoise</i>, but the vessel was wrecked on a reef in the Coral Sea on 27 August 1802. Westall's sketches on Wreck Reef resulted in an oil painting now at the National Maritime Museum. He was among those saved by the <i>Rolla</i>. Having arranged for his drawings of Australia to be sent without delay to England, Westall travelled to Canton (Guangzhou), arriving on 14 December 1803, and staying until 5 February 1804. During this time he sketched a merchant's garden and later painted the beautiful <span class="italic">Scene in a Mandarin's Garden</span> (exh. Royal Academy, 1814).<br>
<br>Westall journeyed, on board the <i>Carron</i>, to India arriving in Bombay at the end of April for a three and a half month stay. Perhaps the most successful paintings of his career were based on his experiences there. A scene in the Indian mountains appeared in a number of versions, at the Royal Academy in 1817 and 1824 and at the British Institution in 1818 and 1825. A reviewer in the <span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span> found it &#145;striking, grand and picturesque&#146;  (10 July 1824, 442) and another in the <span class="italic">Repository of Arts</span> described it as &#145;peculiarly romantic and well painted&#146;  (June 1823, 3rd ser., 355). The <span class="italic">European Magazine</span>'s reviewer suggested that &#145;Turner's absence is in great measure compensated by Calcott and W. Westall&#146;, the latter's picture exhibiting &#145;a grand assemblage of Indian Forest scenery&#146;  (85, June 1824, 547&#150;8).<br>
<br>William Westall arrived back in England in February 1805. He was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society that December and set out to re-visit Madeira and go on to Jamaica. An exhibition of his foreign views at Brook Street, in 1808, did not succeed. John Landseer maintained that this was due to lack of advertising  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 2 Feb 1850, 136). He exhibited ten foreign views in watercolours at the gallery of the Associated Artists in 1808, and fifteen drawings in 1809. He became an associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours on 11 June 1810, and a full member on 10 June 1811, and contributed thirteen drawings in 1811 and 1812 to that society's exhibitions. His drawing of Rievaulx Abbey, Yorkshire, 1811, is in the British Museum.<br>
<br>The Admiralty commissioned Westall to paint oils of the Australian voyage and on the basis of two paintings exhibited in 1812 he was elected an associate of the Royal Academy. Matthew Flinders had returned to England in 1810, and his account of his voyage was written and published with an atlas in 1814 as <span class="italic">A Voyage to Terra Australis</span> with nine engravings after Westall's drawings and twenty-eight coastal views. Bernard Smith suggested that Westall's coastal profiles are &#145;more elaborate and more skilful than the profiles drawn by Hodges or Webber&#146;  (<span class="italic">European Vision and the South Pacific</span>, 1960, 142).<br>
<br>In 1815 Westall appears to have had a mental breakdown  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 13.4749; 14.4759). Helped by Sir George Beaumont he became a regular visitor to the Lake District and became acquainted with Robert Southey and William Wordsworth. Southey wrote the introduction to Westall's <span class="italic">Views of the Valley and Vale of Keswick</span>, published in 1820 and regarded him as &#145;by far the most faithful delineator of the scenery of the Lakes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Southey's Correspondence</span>, 5, 1850, 52). Wordsworth penned three sonnets in 1818 &#145;suggested by Mr W. Westall's views of the caves etc. in Yorkshire&#146;  (<span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>, January 1819 cited in M. Moorman, <span class="italic">William Wordsworth: a Biography&#151;the Later Years, 1803&#150;1850</span>, 1968, 372). After Westall's death Wordsworth wrote on 6 March 1850 to the artist's third son, Robert: &#145;His delineations of this country (the Lakes) must always be valued by those who visit it and wish to carry away faithful portraitures of its beautiful scenery&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Letters of William and Dorothy Wordsworth</span>, ed. A. G. Hill, 7, 1988, 916). Works by William Westall are in Admiralty House, the National Maritime Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the British Museum, London; the National Library of Australia, Canberra and the Library of New South Wales, Sydney; at Dove Cottage, Grasmere; and the Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester and the Glasgow Museum and Art Gallery. Others are in private collections. His <span class="italic">View of Fort Cornwallis, Prince of Wales Island, Penang</span> (1804), made the year before Stanford Raffles arrived in Penang, was included in the exhibition &#145;The golden sword: Stanford Raffles and the East&#146; at the British Museum in 1999.<br>
<br>Westall married Ann Sedgwick (1789&#150;1862), daughter of the Revd Richard Sedgwick, vicar of Dent, on 22 September 1820. Her brother Adam Sedgwick, became professor of geology at Cambridge University where he taught Charles Darwin. Sara Hutchinson, Wordsworth's sister-in-law, wrote on 12 September 1820 of Mrs Westall that she &#145;will take good care of her husband a thing very necessary as he is a reckless sort of person&#146;  (K. Coburn, ed. <span class="italic">Letters of Sara Hutchinson</span>, 1954, 209&#150;10). William and Ann Westall had four sons, William, Thomas, Robert, and Richard.<br>
<br>As an engraver and lithographer, William Westall was always interested in the mechanics of print work. Michael Twyman noted that &#145;Westall is of special interest because of his range of skills as a printmaker; there can't have been many draughtsmen of the period that mastered so many different processes&#146;  (letter, 14 April 1983, priv. coll.). His lithographs of London and the aquatints for Ackermann of the Thames, the universities, and public schools are highly regarded. The steel-engravings for <span class="italic">Great Britain Illustrated</span>, first published in parts (1828&#150;29) by Charles Tilt, brought topographical prints to a wide audience. A number of Westall's Indian views appeared as aquatints in Robert Grindlay's <span class="italic">Scenery, Costumes and Architecture Chiefly on the Western Side of India</span> (2 vols., 1826; 1830), and his work appeared in the new print format patented by George Baxter (for example, <span class="italic">The Pictorial Album, or, Cabinet of Paintings, for the Year</span>, 1837).<br>
<br>In 1848 Westall exhibited at the Royal Academy <span class="italic">Commencement of the Deluge</span> (1848; Tate collection), an oil painting which contemporaries compared poorly with John Linnell's <span class="italic">Eve of the Deluge</span>, although more recently it has been regarded as a painting of considerable merit. In total, William Westall exhibited seventy works at the Royal Academy, thirty paintings and drawings at the British Institution, and seven in the Suffolk Street Gallery. Seven hundred prints after his work have been located.<br>
<br>William Westall died on 22 January 1850, at Northbank, St John's Wood, where he was living, and is said to have left &#145;a considerable fortune&#146;  (A. Story, <span class="italic">James Holmes and John Varley</span>, 1894, 45). He was buried in the churchyard of St John's, Hampstead, near John Constable. His son, Robert Westall, wrote an obituary for the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> (April 1850, 104&#150;5) with an afterword by Landseer.<br>
