<span class="headword">Corker,  James</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Maurus]</span>  (1636&#150;1715), <span class="occ">abbot of Lambspring</span>, was the son of Francis Corker (<i>d</i>. 1667), vicar of Bradford, a royalist who changed sides and became a spy against the royalists during the interregnum. He was brought up as an Anglican, but was converted to Catholicism, abhorring his father's disloyalty to the monarchy, and, joining the English Benedictines, was professed in the monastery of St Adrian and St Denis at Lambspring in Lower Saxony on 23 April 1656. He was sent on the English mission in the Benedictine south province in 1665, and for twelve years he was chaplain to Mrs Frances Cotton, a relative of Sir Robert Cotton, and later to Queen Catherine of Braganza at the Savoy. In 1677 he was appointed Benedictine censor of books, setting about the task of building up a library for the use of young Benedictine missioners while he continued to be a generous benefactor to the English Benedictine houses on the continent.<br>
<br>Being alarmed at the narrative of Titus Oates and his party, who had included him among those concerned in the pretended Popish Plot and had intimated that a papal bull appointed him bishop of London, Corker concealed himself for several months, but on the eve of the opening of parliament in October 1678 he was arrested in his lodgings by Titus Oates as part of a plan to discredit the queen through her chaplains and was committed prisoner to Newgate. On 18 July 1679 he was tried at the Old Bailey with Sir George Wakeman and the two monks William Marshall and William Rumley, but their innocence was so evident that the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. Corker was detained, however, on account of his being a Catholic priest, and on 17 January 1680 was tried for high treason in having taken holy orders from the see of Rome. Despite a well-rounded speech given in his defence he was found guilty and was sentenced to death, but was reprieved by the king and remained in Newgate until 1685. In prison he was confessor and spiritual guide to many of the Popish Plot prisoners, and published accounts of the trials, dying speeches, and devotions of those who died on the scaffold, including <span class="italic">Stafford's Memoires</span> (1682) and <span class="italic">A Remonstrance of Piety and Innocence</span> (1683). It is stated that during his confinement there he reconciled more than a thousand persons to the Catholic church, and was a great comfort to many in distress. He said that he was comforted when under sentence of death by the hope that his sufferings would expiate the guilt of an ancestor in accepting Nostell Priory. In prison he acted as spiritual director to the unfortunate St Oliver Plunket, Catholic archbishop of Armagh, who allowed him to view his last speech. He was elected president-general of the English Benedictines in 1680, being installed as such on 15 September 1681 in Newgate prison by Dom John Huddleston, and in the following year he was made cathedral prior of Canterbury. This same year was published anonymously his <span class="italic">Roman Catholick Principles in Reference to God and the King</span>, which had been written in prison and which soon became recognized as the clearest formulation of Anglo-Gallican principles by clarifying the duties which Catholics owed to their monarch. In 1683 he was responsible for the exhumation of the quartered remains of St Oliver Plunket and supervised their transfer to Lambspring.<br>
<br>On the accession of James II Corker was restored to liberty, but the king was reluctant to have him become Benedictine president again in 1685 because of his involvement in the Popish Plot, and Corker became briefly Benedictine procurator in Rome. In 1685 too he became the administrator of a bursary at the school in Lambspring provided by his patron Frances Cotton so that a student might be educated in the mystical teachings of Dom Augustine Baker. He returned to London and was appointed resident ambassador of the elector of Cologne to the court of St James on 31 January 1688. This office had been held in the past by abbots of Lambspring. On the occasion of his reception at court he was publicly accompanied by six other monks in the Benedictine habit, on the instructions of the king, which gave offence to some. During the reign of James II he was responsible for receiving the poet John Dryden into the Catholic church, and established a chapel in the Savoy.<br>
<br>Owing to a dispute with the Jesuits Corker was persuaded by the king to remove to St John's, Clerkenwell, and having first obliged the Jesuits to pay him what his chapel had cost him, there built<blockquote>a mighty pritty convent, which the revolution of 1688 pulled down to the ground, to his very great loss, for as he was Dean of the Rosary [confraternity] he melted down the great gold chalice and patten to help towards this building, supplying the want of them with one of silver just of that make. He counted this convent, for the conversion of souls, amongst those things which the Holy Fathers of the Church allow the church treasures to be spent on. (Weldon, 5.312)</blockquote>The chapel had only a brief existence, being the first object of attack by the populace when the news reached London of the safe landing of William, prince of Orange. On Sunday 11 November 1688 a crowd assembled round the building and was about to demolish it when a military force arrived. The monks succeeded in removing most of their furniture before any report of their intentions got abroad, but the last two carts were stopped in Holborn, and all that they contained was publicly burned in the middle of the street.<br>
<br>Forced to seek refuge on the continent, Corker became chaplain to the English Benedictine nuns in Paris between 1688 and 1690, to whom he donated an arm of St Oliver Plunket as a relic. There he was the spiritual director of the nun Dame Justina Gascoigne, a disciple of Dom Augustine Baker. On 21 September 1690 he was installed as fourth abbot of Lambspring, having been appointed titular abbot of Cismar in 1689, and helped to consecrate the new abbey church on 26 May 1691. In this he had a monument erected in 1693 to St Oliver Plunket in the crypt and donated to the church a set of vestments made from James II's royal robes. As abbot he was often at loggerheads with his community, attempting to force a German model of stricter Benedictine observance, such as obtained in the Bursfeld congregation, on the monks, and was absent for long periods in the Netherlands, France, Italy, and England. He found himself briefly under arrest in England in 1694 on account of some money he had earlier borrowed when an ordinary missioner. The impostor William Fuller met him on one of his journeys<blockquote>accoutred more like a Dragoon than a ghostly Father, having on him a Red Coat, with a swinging Belt about a foot broad about his Wast, a terrible large long sword, a Campaigne Wig, and a laced Hat, and he looked most Furiously. (W. Fuller, <span class="italic">The Whole Life of Mr William Fuller</span>, 1703)</blockquote>Finally, on 27 July 1696 he resigned the abbacy and returned for good to England to continue his favourite task of making converts. There, about 1698, he wrote his <span class="italic">Rational Account &hellip; by M. B.</span> which explained his conversion to Catholicism and which elicited William Wake's reply, <span class="italic">The Church of Rome No Guide</span> (1700). It was followed about 1710 by another apologetical tract, <span class="italic">Queries to Dr. Sacheverell from North-Britain</span>. Retaining his title of abbot of Cismar, he lived &#145;in a recluse solitary manner&#146; at &#145;Stafford House, near the park&#146;; his room was lined with books and &#145;ghastly pictures drawn dead with ropes about their necks&#146;, representing the victims of the Popish Plot  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He died at Paddington, Middlesex, on 22 December 1715 and was buried at St Pancras.<br>
