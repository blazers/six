<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Reuter,  (Paul) Julius  de</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Israel Beer Josaphat]</span>, Baron de Reuter in the nobility of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha  (1816&#150;1899), <span class="occ">news agency founder</span>, was born on 21 July 1816 in Kassel, Germany, the third son in the family of four sons and one daughter of Samuel Levi Josaphat, provisional rabbi of Kassel, and his wife, Bette Sanders of Kassel. Soon after the death of his father in 1829, Israel appears to have become a clerk in an uncle's bank in G&ouml;ttingen.<br>
<br>Reuter moved to England on 29 October 1845, under the name Julius Josaphat. Two weeks later, on 16 November 1845, he was baptized as Paul Julius Reuter at St George's German Lutheran Chapel, Whitechapel, London. And one week after that, on 23 November 1845, he married Ida Marie Elisabeth Clementina, the daughter of Sigismund Matthaeus Magnus, a Berlin civil servant. They had three sons and four daughters, of whom two sons and one daughter reached adulthood. In 1847 Reuter became a partner in a Berlin bookshop and publishing business, Reuter and Stargardt, but the firm's radical pamphlets may have incurred official displeasure and Reuter moved to Paris in 1848. There he first worked as a translator in the news agency run by Charles Havas, and this working relationship later developed into a friendship. He soon switched his attention to bridging the 100 mile gap between the Franco-Belgian telegraph wire which ended at Brussels and the German one at Aachen. By renting pigeons at Aachen, he was able to beat the mail train by several hours, but by Christmas 1850 the gap was finally closed and his service became redundant.<br>
<br>Having now accumulated a small amount of capital and a tiny corps of agents in European cities, Reuter moved to London in June 1851 and set up an office in the Royal Exchange Buildings. He made use of the new Dover&#150;Calais cable to transmit economic information, which he sold to clients, between the London and Paris stock exchanges. Although he sold a news service to some European papers, he found it hard to sell a news service within the United Kingdom, and <span class="italic">The Times</span> was particularly recalcitrant. Eventually, in October 1858, he persuaded the <span class="italic">Morning Advertiser</span> and other newspapers to take his service on a fortnight's free trial. This was a success, and at last even <span class="italic">The Times</span>, under pressure from rising costs, succumbed.<br>
<br>Reuter, who was naturalized in 1857, energetically expanded and developed his agency, showing a keen appreciation of the value of exclusive news &#145;beats&#146; and following the cable around the world; 10 January 1859 saw his first major beat, the king of Sardinia's speech which prefaced the war of Italian independence. In 1865 he broke the news of President Abraham Lincoln's assassination several hours ahead of any rivals. In 1865 Reuters opened an office in Alexandria, the first outside Europe, and in 1866 the first Asian office was opened in Bombay. So that his firm could lay its own line to Germany, he floated Reuters as a &pound;250,000 public company on 20 February 1865, taking the post of managing director. The company made a large profit when that line was nationalized. In 1870 Reuter formed a worldwide news agency cartel with Havas in Paris and Wolff in Germany, which survived until the 1930s. He secured his most spectacular coup in 1872 when he won a concession from the shah of Persia covering the exploitation of all industrial and mineral rights. Owing to religious pressure and intervention from Russia, however, this was soon rescinded. Reuter retired in 1878, handing over control of the agency to his son, Herbert de Reuter (1852&#150;1915). The success of Reuter's agency lay in its objectivity, speed, and even-handed treatment of clients. The later profits of the news business were never substantial and much was ploughed back into expansion.<br>
<br>Adorned with lavish side-whiskers, Reuter, succinct of speech but a superb salesman, was short and lively; he gazed sharply at visitors through pince-nez spectacles. A strong supporter of the British empire, he ran his business in patriarchal fashion. In 1871 he was ennobled by Ernst II, duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, as Baron von Reuter, and was from that time known as Baron Julius de Reuter. In 1891 Queen Victoria, to whom Reuter had been careful to send copies of important cables, allowed him to &#145;enjoy the privileges of the foreign nobility in Britain&#146;.<br>
<br>Reuter died on 25 February 1899 at 97 promenade des Anglais, Nice, France, his wife surviving him. His life became the subject of a film in 1941, released in the United States as <span class="italic">A Dispatch from Reuters</span> and elsewhere as <span class="italic">This Man Reuter</span>. It formed a piece of mid-war pro-British propaganda, using Reuter's career as an example of British and American commitment to a free press, showing how, in pursuit of the creation of a news agency that successfully promoted such freedom, Reuter had chosen to leave Germany and set up in London. &#145;The geographical moral was tacit but obvious&#146;  (Read, 276).<br>
<br>Reuter's ultimate impact and influence has been summed up in the following way:<blockquote>Julius Reuter had taken the first step in a progression which was to lead in the late twentieth century to instant news and almost instant public reaction&#151;telegraphs, telephone, radio, satellite; still pictures as well as text; newsfilm; and, finally, television. Arguably, the first stage&#151;the making of news quickly available by overland telegraph and undersea cable&#151;was the most important stage of all, in the sense that whereas the first stage brought about a transformation, everything afterwards, however impressive, has been simply a refinement. (Read, 70&#150;71)</blockquote>Reuters remained under family control until the suicide of Herbert de Reuter in 1915. It then moved into other hands, but continued to develop and operate successfully into the twenty-first century.<br>
