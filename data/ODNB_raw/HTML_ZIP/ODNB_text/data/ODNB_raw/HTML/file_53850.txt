<span class="headword">Streete,  Thomas</span>  (1621&#150;1689), <span class="occ">astronomer and astrologer</span>, was born on 5 March 1621 in Cork. As an ensign in Colonel Kingsmill's regiment under Inchiquin, he fought for the king at Tredagh and Dublin, and was twice captured. After the Restoration, Streete lived in London, initially at the New Buildings on Tower Hill, and later in Popping Court, near Fleet Street. There are no records of his having had any formal schooling. He was employed by Elias Ashmole, first as a clerk and then, in 1667, as deputy comptroller in the Excise Office for London, Middlesex, and Surrey. The post was renewed in 1671. For this Streete earned &pound;150 per annum.<br>
<br>Despite his humble background and somewhat marginal status, Streete's abilities were acknowledged by the most eminent natural philosophers of the day. He was an early and committed heliocentrist, whose principal work was <span class="italic">Astronomia Carolina: a New Theorie of Coelestial Motions</span> (1661); a work of computational astronomy, with extensive tables of planetary positions and motions, this became a standard textbook used well into the eighteenth century. It was consulted, as were Streete's ephemerides, by Newton, Flamsteed, and Halley, while Ashmole&#151;and undoubtedly others&#151;also used it to cast horoscopes. <span class="italic">Astronomia Carolina</span> was the first printed text in English to discuss Kepler's first and third laws of planetary motion (alongside Streete's own version of Kepler's second law). Streete followed this up with <span class="italic">An Appendix to Astronomia Carolina</span> (1664), dedicated to Ashmole, and <span class="italic">The Description and Use of the Planetary Systeme</span> (1674), as well as a running defence of his work in pamphlets countering the attacks of another self-taught astronomer, the astrologer and mathematician Vincent Wing.<br>
<br>Although he was never invited to join the charmed circle of the Royal Society, Streete's abilities were recognized by its leading members. His attempt to solve the notoriously difficult problem of ascertaining longitude at sea won the commendation of Lord Brouncker, John Wilkins, John Pell, and Sir Jonas Moore in a testimonial attesting that Streete &#145;hath attained a greater Exactitude in the Discovery of true Longitude by the motion of the Moon then hath yet been Extant&#146;  (Josten, 3.1080). He viewed a lunar eclipse with Edmond Halley in 1675, and was invited by Robert Hooke to observe Mercury's transit of the sun at Gresham College in October 1677; it is probable that there were other such occasions for which no record survives. After Streete's death Halley edited a second edition of <span class="italic">Astronomia Carolina</span>, with an appendix, in 1710.<br>
<br>Streete was both an autodidact and a respected natural philosopher at a time when the two still commonly went together. As with other such men, including Vincent Wing and Jeremy Shakerley, astronomy and astrology shared his attention. Thus, for example, in the dedication of <span class="italic">Astronomia Carolina</span>, he related the coronation of Charles II to the &#145;rare and most remarkable Appearance of Mercury in the sun&#146; (its transit of the sun). This was no mere rhetorical conceit; the belief in a correspondence between the natural and the social was still widely held even among the readership of a specialized work such as <span class="italic">Astronomia Carolina</span>.<br>
<br>More specifically, the hopes raised by exciting new discoveries and theories in astronomy seemed to Streete to apply equally to astrology, as the application of such new knowledge to human affairs. As early as 1652 Streete produced <span class="italic">A Double Ephemeris for the year &hellip; 1653: Geocentricall and Heliocentricall</span>; this set of tables along with those of his friend and fellow researcher Joshua Childrey were the first of their kind. Both of Streete's tables were explicitly intended for use by astrologers for the improvement of their art, as well as to convince doubting astronomers. He defended both geocentric and heliocentric aspects (that is, angular relationships between the planets), arguing that &#145;long continued and infallible experiments do also confirm the same, both in the Change of Weather, and things of near concernment unto us&#146;. However, as befitted a careful natural philosopher who was also a royalist writing in 1652, he added, &#145;Let honest Astrologers be cautious &hellip; and modest in their Predictions. So will I&#146;  (Streete, <span class="italic">Double Ephemeris</span>, dedication).<br>
<br>Streete wrote other ephemerides, &#145;with Astrological Observations thereon&#146;, for 1663 and finally 1683. He died in Westminster on 17 August 1689 and was buried in Westminster New Chapel.<br>
