<span class="headword">Babington,  Brute</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1611), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Derry</span>, came from Cheshire. He entered Christ's College, Cambridge, on 17 June 1572, graduated BA in 1576 (incorporating at Oxford on 15 July 1578), and MA in 1579 (as a member of St John's College). He was a fellow of Christ's in 1577&#150;84, graduated BTh in 1586, and is later termed DTh. He was rector of Thurcaston, Leicestershire, from 1583 to 1610, prebendary of Bishopshill (Lichfield) from 1592 to 1601, and divinity lecturer at Lichfield. He also held the vicarage of Tettenhall (Staffordshire) in 1602, and the rectory of Cossington (Leicestershire) in 1605. Disappointed in his efforts to secure the deanery of Lichfield in 1603, he also lost his lectureship. In 1610 he turned to Ireland for preferment. On 11 August the king nominated him to the see of Derry, and he was appointed on 8 November 1610, being consecrated in Drogheda by Archbishop Henry Ussher.<br>
<br>Derry was a large see, strategically placed in the plantation of Ulster, which was then beginning to transform the province from a Gaelic stronghold into a major centre of English and Scottish settlement. According to his own account Babington's missionary efforts were successful. The leading Catholic priests were initially hostile, but by &#145;dealing with them lovingly and kindly&#146;, he persuaded well over half to submit and join the established church. By sitting in person in the new ecclesiastical courts and punishing offenders &#145;cum moderamine&#146; (&#145;with moderation&#146;) he confidently claimed &#145;I shall in short time bring this rude and uncivilized people to some good conformity&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1611&#150;14</i>, 3). Whether this optimism would have led to long-term success may be doubted&#151;certainly other English bishops elsewhere in the plantation failed to win over large sections of the native clergy, though it could be argued that their methods were less sensitive and more coercive. The experiment was, in any case, cut short by his sudden demise in Derry on 10 September 1611 &#145;being well at seven o'clock evening and dead at eight&#146;  (ibid., 103). As often happened in the case of unexplained sudden protestant deaths, later Catholic sources attributed his demise to providential judgment&#151;in this case on his vain efforts to burn an image of the Virgin Mary in Coleraine Abbey.<br>
