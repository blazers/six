<span class="headword">Habershon,  Roy</span>  (1925&#150;1992), <span class="occ">police officer</span>, was born at 38 Sylvester Street, Sheffield, on 15 May 1925, the son of William Habershon, table blade cutter, and his wife, Melia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cocker. Educated at Greystones elementary school, Sheffield, he left at fourteen, and worked in Sheffield railway offices until he joined the RAF in the Second World War. He was with Coastal Command, and served as a sergeant in a Wellington bomber, acting also as wireless operator and rear air gunner in Aden and Tobruk. He joined the Metropolitan Police on 14 October 1946 as a constable. On 7 June 1947 he married Edith Maud (<i>b</i>. 1922/3), Post Office telephonist, of Abertillery, and daughter of John Gallier, coalminer; they had one son, David (<i>b</i>. 1949).<br>
<br>Habershon was recruited to the CID in 1948, and gained a reputation for integrity and honesty in his various posts, which included several years with the fraud squad. He became detective sergeant (second class) in June 1958, detective sergeant (first class) in June 1960, detective inspector in November 1963, detective chief inspector in February 1966, detective superintendent in November 1967, and detective chief superintendent in June 1969. When the Angry Brigade, a terrorist group, planted two bombs at the home of the secretary of state for employment, Robert Carr, in Barnet on 12 January 1971, Habershon was detective chief superintendent covering the area, having just been moved there after a two-year secondment as assistant director of command courses at Bramshill Police College, Hampshire. Habershon's qualities of leadership were respected, and he took command of the investigation with a small squad which within six months was moved to Scotland Yard and reinforced with officers from special branch and the flying squad. Its team of about forty was placed under the overall control of Commander Ernest Bond, and it became the bomb squad (later the anti-terrorist squad). Forceful, persistent, methodical, and determined in the face of libertarian protest, Habershon conducted extensive enquiries and produced evidence which soon secured the conviction of five members of the Angry Brigade.<br>
<br>The IRA presented a new challenge in March 1973 with their first large-scale attack on London. Habershon's evidence at Winchester crown court helped to ensure the conviction of nine terrorists. Promoted to commander in January 1974, he was appointed MBE and left the bomb squad for a time, but he returned in March 1975 as commander, on the retirement of Robert Huntley, at the time when the dramatic six-day siege of a four-man IRA unit at Balcombe Street in London's West End led ultimately to the unit's capture without loss of life. Harold Wilson, then prime minister, telegrammed Sir Robert Mark, Metropolitan Police commissioner, after the arrests, noting that &#145;the Metropolitan Police have again demonstrated the very highest levels of skill and patience in bringing an incident of this kind to a successful conclusion. The whole nation is in the force's debt&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 13 Dec 1975). The four men were released under the amnesty associated with the peace process in Northern Ireland in April 1999.<br>
<br>The Balcombe Street siege was only one of more than a hundred terrorist incidents which Habershon investigated. By then bespectacled and balding, &#145;he was variously feared, revered and reviled by those with whom he came into contact&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 28 March 1992). He became head of Scotland Yard's serious crimes branch, but felt much less at home in 1976 when unsuccessfully probing the source of a leak about cabinet discussions on child benefit than when hunting earlier for terrorists. Nor did anything come of his enquiry in the same year into the bankrupt Cheshire businessman Jesse Robert Rennie's allegation that Harold Wilson had inspired a policeman's attempt to bribe Rennie into returning letters received from an unnamed MP. Habershon left the senior ranks at Scotland Yard in 1977 to become head of E division, responsible for both CID and uniformed men in north London, including the busy area of Camden Town. He retired in 1980 after earning twenty-three commendations. He then became a director of the firm Control Risks, advising on security.<br>
<br>Roy Habershon was thorough, and liked to do a job well, but he was not keen on the political side of police work, and &#145;if something needed to be said, then he would say it&#146;  (private information). He was good company, with a dry sense of humour, and a good after-dinner speaker. Very much a man's man, he played football and cricket for the Metropolitan Police in his earlier years, and latterly golf. His son recalled him as an easy-going parent, and enjoyed going on fishing expeditions with him. In retirement Habershon took pleasure in his grandchildren and was fond of gardening. He died at his home, 6 Hoe Lane, Ware, Hertfordshire, from cancer on 18 March 1992. He was survived by his wife and son.<br>
