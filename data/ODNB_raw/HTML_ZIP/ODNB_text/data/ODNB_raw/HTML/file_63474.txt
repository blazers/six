<span class="headword">Hopper,  Christopher</span>  (1722&#150;1802), <span class="occ">Methodist preacher</span>, was born on 25 December 1722 at Low-Coalburn, Ryton, co. Durham, and baptized at Ryton parish church on 9 January 1723, the ninth and youngest child of Moses Hopper, a farmer, and his wife, Ann Barkiss. At about five years old he was sent to a school run by a Mr Alderson, a pious and forbidding teacher. His formal education appears to have ended with Alderson's suicide, whereupon, aged fifteen, Hopper was employed as a driver on the wagon-ways between the coal pits and the River Tyne.<br>
<br>In May 1742 reports began to circulate of John Wesley's preaching to great effect at Sandgate, Newcastle upon Tyne. Hopper was himself converted by the preaching of Jonathan Reeve in the spring of the following year. On 14 July 1743 John Wesley spoke at Low Spen, near Newcastle, and soon after a Methodist society was formed with Hopper as one of its leaders. He received requests to preach at such places as Blanchland, Prudhoe, Durham, and Sunderland, where on occasions he encountered violent opposition. In 1744 Hopper began work as a teacher at a school at Barlow, near Ryton. His involvement in Methodist work did not endear him to the rector and curate, and led to his being charged before the spiritual court at Durham with teaching and preaching without a licence. On 28 May 1745 he married Jane Richardson (<i>d</i>. 1755) at Ryton, and shortly afterwards the couple moved to the preacher's house at Sheephill and then, in 1748, to Allendale, Northumberland.<br>
<br>By this date Hopper was formally recognized as an itinerant preacher in the Newcastle circuit. From then he travelled in the northern circuits. He was a travelling preacher at Birstall, Bolton, Bradford, Liverpool, and Manchester, as well as Newcastle, and established some of the first Methodist societies in the north of England. He travelled to Ireland several times, accompanying John Wesley on a tour between April and July 1750, and was again in attendance during Wesley's pioneering visit to Scotland in April of the following year. He was appointed president of the Methodist conference at Bristol in 1780, the only person to hold this position other than Wesley in his lifetime. Following the death of Jane on 15 August 1755, Hopper had married Ann Twizell in April 1759, although no further details are known. On superannuating in 1792 Hopper moved to Bolton, where he built a house next to the chapel. Although his activities were curtailed he managed to continue preaching in the circuit and generally made annual visits into Yorkshire and adjacent circuits.<br>
<br>After a short illness Hopper died on 5 March 1802 at Bolton and was interred there in a vault in the new churchyard of St George's. The funeral sermon was preached by the Revd Thomas Cooper, circuit superintendent, from <span class="roman">2 Samuel</span> 3: 38&#151;&#145;Know ye not that there is a prince, and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?&#146;&#151;who described Hopper as<blockquote>a good man, full of faith, and mighty in scriptures. God greatly blessed his word both to saints and sinners; graciously banished all his fears, and made him as bold as a lion in the face of all his dangers. (Cooper, 396)</blockquote>
