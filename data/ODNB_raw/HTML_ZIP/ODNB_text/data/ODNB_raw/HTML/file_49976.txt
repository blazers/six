<span class="headword">Fonseca,  Alvaro  da</span> <span class="st"> [Jacob  Jessurun Alvares]</span>  (1657?&#150;1742), <span class="occ">diamond merchant</span>, was born in Lisbon, the second of three children of Manuel Alvares and Brites Gomes. His full name was probably Alvaro da Fonseca Alvares. The family were New Christians from Trancoso in northern Portugal. In 1667 his uncle and namesake was arrested by the Coimbra Inquisition and convicted of Judaizing. Fear of the Inquisition forced the family to leave Portugal. Fonseca converted to open Judaism, probably in Amsterdam, and took the name of Jacob Jessurun. In 1673 he settled in London as a merchant, using the name Jacob Jessurun Alvares; he paid the synagogue &pound;4 10<i>s</i>. in consulage or <i>imposta</i>, which, at 1<i>s</i>. per &pound;100, implies a trading turnover of &pound;9000. On 6 May 1674 he married Sarah, daughter of Isaac Henriques Faro, at the Portuguese Synagogue in Amsterdam. They had one son, Isaac Jessurun Alvares (<i>c</i>.1675&#150;1711). In 1675 Fonseca was endenizened as an English subject. In 1676 he was the fourth highest contributor to the synagogue <i>imposta</i>, paying &pound;32 4<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>., which implies a year's turnover of &pound;64,400. The ledger of Manuel Levy Duarte of Amsterdam shows that Fonseca bought polished diamonds from Amsterdam for resale in London. He is listed in the <span class="italic">Little London Directory</span> of 1677 as Jacob Jesrum Alvarez in St Mary Axe. In 1677 he was elected treasurer of the Portuguese Synagogue in London and acquired the copyhold of their cemetery at Mile End, which he held as a trustee until 1736. From 1675 to 1679 he figures in the port books as one of the seven most active London Jewish merchants. In 1680 he was in partnership with Abraham do Porto.<br>
<br>In that year the East India Company sought to monopolize the diamond trade. This induced Simon Henriques and Alfonso Rodrigues, diamond importers in London, to open a branch house in India outside the company's jurisdiction. In 1682 they sent their brother Bartholomew Rodrigues, their brother-in-law Domingo do Porto, and Fonseca out to India on the interlopers' ships. Fonseca left his wife and son in London and was not to see them again for nineteen years. After an unsuccessful attempt to enter Masulipatam, they settled at Covelong, 20 miles south of Madras. The East India Company's directors reacted quickly to this well-organized competition. They threw open the trade in diamonds, pearls, and other &#145;fine goods&#146;, and instructed the council in Madras to allow the Jewish merchants to settle and trade at Fort St George, which they did. In 1686 the Dutch East India Company responded by allowing Abraham do Porto and two other Portuguese Jewish merchants to settle at Surat. The English company reacted by reducing their &#145;permission&#146; rates for aliens and by setting up the corporation of Madras with an English mayor and 120 burgesses and twelve aldermen: three Englishmen, three Hindus, three Portuguese Catholics, and three Jews. Fonseca was sworn as an alderman of Madras in 1690, in succession to Domingo do Porto, who had died. He traded to Bengal, Burma, and the Philippines, and finally returned to London in 1700.<br>
<br>On first meeting him then, Sir John Chardin wrote to his brother Daniel in Madras that Fonseca seemed to him to be an honest man of good commerce. Thomas Pitt, the governor of Fort St George, was of the same opinion, referring to him as &#145;Mr Alvares&#146;, and addressed him cordially as &#145;Dear Sir and Friend&#146;. When Pitt's famous 426 carat diamond was sent to London, Fonseca refused to accept its consignment, but advised Robert Pitt on how to have it cut and polished and to market its offcuts. In London he traded in partnership with Roger Bradyll and became a leading London importer of Indian diamonds. In 1709 the company fined them for smuggling. He served six times as a warden of the Portuguese Synagogue in Bevis Marks (in 1702, 1707, 1712, 1716, 1720, and 1726). He died in London in 1742 at the age of eighty-five and was buried on 16 November next to his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1723), in its old cemetery at Mile End. Fonseca was a prominent member of the group of Jewish diamond merchants who were forced to flee Portugal and who diverted this profitable trade from Lisbon to London.<br>
