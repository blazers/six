<span class="headword">Potter,  Hannibal</span>  (1592&#150;1664), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born at Mere vicarage, Wiltshire, the eldest son of Richard Potter (<i>c</i>.1557&#150;1637), prebendary of Worcester. In 1607 he was sent to Trinity College, Oxford, where his father had held a fellowship from 1579 to 1585. Two years later he was elected to a scholarship, while his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22609/', "Francis Potter (1594&#150;1678)")</script> entered as a commoner. Potter was elected to a fellowship in 1613; the simple monasticism of the life suited him well. He and Francis shared a room until the latter succeeded to their father's living in 1637. A man of great piety Hannibal Potter took his BD in 1621 and his DD in 1630, and was unfailingly conscientious in his religious duties. He was appointed rector of Over Worton in Oxfordshire in 1624 and of Wootton, Northamptonshire, in the following year; in 1635 he preached at Gray's Inn.<br>
<br>When the president of Trinity, Ralph Kettell, died in 1643, Potter had been senior fellow for twelve years and was thus an obvious candidate to succeed. Contemporary gossip had it that the fellows' vote had been in favour of the more dynamic William Chillingworth, but Potter was the choice of the visitor, Walter Curll, whom he had previously served as chaplain. As a fellow, Potter came before parliamentary questioners several times, and showed skill in picking his path carefully. To be head of house in the civil war was far from easy, and the ever-timorous Potter approached the daily difficulties of the role with a mixture of heroic endurance and nervous cat-and-mouse resistance. It was a surprisingly effective combination. By nature reluctant to get involved in controversy, sometimes his will to resist needed bolstering by men such as Richard Baylie of St John's&#151;for example, when he spoke against the visitors' contempt for learning and was ordered to submit a copy of his speech to Westminster. As pro-vice-chancellor during the imprisonment of Dr Fell he often found himself in the limelight. In October 1647 he urged convocation to show Christian patience and inoffensive behaviour. When ordered into custody in January 1648, he could not be found. A week later he appeared before the commissioners in London and was found guilty of high contempt, a verdict of which he was in turn contemptuous. On 13 April 1648 he reduced a violent ejection from his lodgings to a mere formality by the expedient of fleeing in advance, and the puritan Robert Harris was imposed on the college in his place.<br>
<br>Potter endured twelve painful years as an exile from Oxford. He automatically lost the presidential living of Garsington. One Captain Coleford obtained for him the curacy of Broomfield, Somerset, but he was soon removed, either for using the liturgy or for &#145;insufficiency&#146;  (Neal, 315). At times he despaired. He was in debt, unable to study, and felt futile and worthless. But at the same time his strong faith and devotion to duty never wavered; and he found time and energy to follow with increasing concern his brother's growing reputation as an eccentric scientist, and to rebuke him for neglecting his vocation and the souls of his flock.<br>
<br>On 3 August 1660 Potter was reinstated to the presidency of Trinity College, the appointment again sealed by an old friend&#151;on this occasion Robert Skinner, bishop of Oxford, who had been a contemporary of Potter's as scholar and fellow. It was quietly done, and the last years of his life were tranquil. Trinity's finances were consolidated, the work ably assisted by Ralph Bathurst, fellow and patently the president-in-waiting. Potter died on 1 September 1664 and was buried in the college chapel. A dirge composed by Samuel Dugard gives the impression of a man much loved in the frailty of his old age. His will was simple, leaving everything to his brother-in-law Thomas Taylor of Worcester. Francis was not mentioned.<br>
