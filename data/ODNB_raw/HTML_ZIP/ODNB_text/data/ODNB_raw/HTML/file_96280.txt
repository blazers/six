<span class="headword">Burton,  William Kinninmond</span>  (1856&#150;1899), <span class="occ">civil engineer and photographer</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 11 May 1856, the eldest of four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4135/', "John Hill Burton (1809&#150;1881)")</script>, historiographer royal for Scotland, and his second wife, Katherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Innes (1824&#150;1898). His maternal grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14428/', "Cosmo Nelson Innes (1798&#150;1874)")</script>, professor of constitutional history in the University of Edinburgh, was one of several influential figures in his early life. His mother, who had served as a nurse in the Crimea with Florence Nightingale, was an author and a promoter of women's education. His aunt, Mary Burton (1819&#150;1909), persuaded the Watt Institution and School of Arts in Edinburgh to open its classes to female students in 1869. His half-sister Ella&#151;one of three elder half-siblings&#151;was among the first to enroll. At Mary Burton's home at Liberton Bank, Edinburgh, he met the young Arthur Conan Doyle, who became a lifelong friend. His younger siblings included Mary Rose Hill Burton (1857&#150;1900), who studied under the auspices of the Edinburgh Association for the University Education of Women and became an artist, and Cosmo Innes Burton (1863&#150;1891), who graduated BSc at Edinburgh University in 1885, was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1887, and was professor of chemistry at the English Technical Institute in Shanghai, where he died.<br>
<br>Burton was educated at Edinburgh collegiate school before, in 1873, starting a five-year apprenticeship with Andrew Betts-Brown of the hydraulic and mechanical engineers Brown Brothers &amp; Co. Ltd at the Rosebank Ironworks, Edinburgh. Burton became chief draughtsman before leaving the firm in 1879 to enter partnership in London with his uncle, the civil engineer Cosmo Innes junior (1842&#150;1887).<br>
<br>Cosmo Innes was secretary of the London Sanitary Protection Association, and Burton became the association's resident engineer in 1881, working on sanitary systems for St Thomas's Hospital and Eton College. His wider reputation in this period was as an amateur photographer, an enthusiasm he shared with Conan Doyle. Cosmo Nelson Innes had been a member of the Calotype Club of Edinburgh and of the Edinburgh Photographic Society, which Burton joined in 1880. He found professionals to be generous in sharing their expertise with newcomers to photographic societies, and this ideal inspired his popular manual <span class="italic">The ABC of Modern Photography</span>, first published in 1882. Highlighting the opportunities that the era of dry gelatine emulsions had opened up to amateurs, his book set out clearly and engagingly the technicalities of photography. It was an immediate success, reaching a fourth edition by 1884, and a ninth by 1890, though his plan to establish a business manufacturing the new photographic emulsions came to nothing.<br>
<br>Burton's sanitary engineering consultancy with Innes did not prosper financially, and in May 1887 he accepted the invitation of the Meiji government of Japan to become professor of sanitary engineering and lecturer on rivers, docks, and harbours in the faculty of engineering at the Imperial University of Tokyo. During his tenure of the chair, which lasted until 1896, he produced an important book, <span class="italic">The Water Supply of Towns and the Construction of Waterworks</span> (1894). It reached a posthumous fourth edition in 1928. Essentially a practical book, aimed at practising engineers and students of engineering, it summarized the techniques applied in Europe and North America to secure supplies of pure water, especially in cities, and illustrated his ability to disseminate in an accessible way new technological developments. His own expertise was in the sand filtration of water, pioneered by an earlier generation of water engineers; he took account of the subsequent research of bacteriologists, which had found that this was not simply a physical process of purification. He insisted that pure water was a benefit to the community, which should be provided as a public good rather than for profit, and emphasized the importance of a supply of water for extinguishing fires, which he cited as an important consideration in Japan.<br>
<br>The growth of Japanese cities, with the resulting hazards of cholera, made the provision of pure water a priority for the Meiji government, and in addition to his professorship Burton became in 1888 consulting engineer to the Tokyo waterworks, and also in 1888 engineer to the sanitary bureau of the home department of the government of Japan. His textbook referred to the scheme he designed for the Tokyo waterworks, and also to methods used in other Japanese cities. In addition to Tokyo he is known to have provided technical advice on water supplies between 1887 and 1898 in Hakodate, Aomori, Numata, Nagasaki, Fukuoka, Osaka, Okayama, Yokohama, Shimonoseki, Kobe, Moji, Omuta, Kofu, Nagoya, Niigata, Hiroshima, and Takamatsu  (Checkland, 179), and also to have designed waterworks for many of them. He was elected an associate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in May 1891, his application having been supported by several other British engineers employed by the Meiji government.<br>
<br>Burton was involved in the foundation in 1890 of the Photographic Society of Japan, and he promoted to a British readership the work of two Japanese photographers, Kazumasa Ogawa and Seibei Kashima. Photographs by Burton accompanied the text of the works by the seismologist John Milne on the earthquake of October 1891, <span class="italic">The Great Earthquake in Japan</span> (1891) and <span class="italic">The Volcanoes of Japan</span> (1892). He also published a collection of his photographs, <span class="italic">Wrestlers and Wrestling in Japan</span> (1895).<br>
<br>Burton's participation in Japanese photographic circles is an indication of what has been described as his remarkable assimilation into Japanese society  (Checkland, 185). He learned Japanese, and with his Japanese wife, Matsu Arakawa, whom he married on 19 May 1894, he had a daughter, born in 1892.<br>
<br>Burton was responsible for a popular landmark in the Asakusa district of Tokyo, the Ryounkaku (&#145;cloud-surpassing pavilion&#146;). Designed by him on the model of water towers, this twelve-storey, redbrick, octagonal building was constructed as a tourist attraction, with entertainments throughout and viewing positions from its highest floor. At 225 feet the Ryounkaku was the tallest structure in the city when it opened in 1890. It was demolished after the earthquake of 1923.<br>
<br>In 1896 Burton left Tokyo for Taiwan, under Japanese rule following the war with China, and undertook designs for water-supply systems there for three years. He intended to return to Scotland, but was taken ill and died on 5 August 1899 in Tokyo, where a tombstone was placed in the Aoyama cemetery. Although his death passed largely unnoticed in British newspapers, his achievement as a designer of waterworks for towns in Japan and Taiwan was noted within his profession, where he was known as &#145;an original and independent worker, of great energy and industry&#146;  (<span class="italic">PICE</span>). His career exemplified the observation of a reviewer of his book on water supply that the modernization of Japan opened up new opportunities to &#145;the engineer as an apostle of progress&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 27 Aug 1894). In Japan his contribution to water systems continues to be remembered, and in 2006 a memorial was unveiled outside his childhood home, part of the Craighouse campus of Edinburgh Napier University.<br>
