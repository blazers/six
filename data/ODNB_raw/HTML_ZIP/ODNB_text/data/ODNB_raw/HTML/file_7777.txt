</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dolben, Sir  John</span>, second baronet  (1684&#150;1756), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 12 February 1684 at Bishopthorpe Palace, near York, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7774/', "Sir Gilbert Dolben, first baronet (1658/9&#150;1722)")</script>, a tory MP and a judge of the common pleas in Ireland, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1744), eldest daughter and coheir of Tanfield Mulso of Finedon, Northamptonshire. Dolben came from a clerical family. His great-grandfather (<i>d</i>. 1631) had been bishop designate of Bangor; his grandfather, John Dolben, was archbishop of York (1683&#150;6), and his grandmother was the niece of another primate, Gilbert Sheldon of Canterbury. John Dolben was admitted on the foundation of Westminster School in 1700. He matriculated at Oxford University on 11 May 1702, having come into residence as a gentleman commoner at Christ Church on 28 April. Dolben graduated BA on 22 January 1704, proceeded MA on 8 July 1707, and accumulated the degrees in divinity on 6 July 1717.<br>
<br>Although Dolben entered the Inner Temple in 1707 at the request of his father (a bencher), he eventually opted for the church rather than the law, and was ordained deacon in June 1709 and priest in April 1711. He gained swift preferment, first as chaplain to Thomas Sprat, bishop of Rochester, on 11 April 1711, and then as subdean of the Chapel Royal on 20 April 1713. Although he was in charge of the thanksgiving service for the accession of George I at St Paul's Cathedral in January 1715 and was in routine control of the chapel, he was dismissed from office on 20 March 1718 together with the dean, John Robinson, bishop of London. The precise reasons for Dolben's dismissal remain obscure although, in a changed political climate, moderate tories like him were expendable.<br>
<br>Dolben was compensated for the loss of his Chapel Royal duties by Nathaniel, Lord Crew, bishop of Durham, who lived at Steane, near Brackley, Northamptonshire, and was thus a neighbour, as well as a tory survivor from the generation of Dolben's grandfather Tanfield Mulso. Dolben was admitted by Crewe to the sixth stall at Durham Cathedral on 2 April 1718. He exchanged it for the eleventh (&#145;golden&#146;) stall on 17 July 1719. He kept regular residence at Durham, but lived mainly as a squire and parish clergyman at Finedon. He was presented to the vicarage of Finedon, Northamptonshire, by his father on 9 August 1714, and instituted on 30 September; he was subsequently presented to the nearby rectory of Burton Latimer on 3 February 1719, and instituted on 14 March. Dolben acted as one of the two proctors in the lower house of convocation for the clergy of the Peterborough diocese from 1714 to 1748. On 22 October 1722 he succeeded his father as second baronet. He married at Sherborne, on 28 July 1720, Elizabeth, second daughter of William Digby, fifth Baron Digby of Geashill. Lady Dolben died at Aix-en-Provence on 4 November 1730, and was buried on 12 January 1731 at Finedon. The couple had five sons and three daughters. In Aix Cathedral there is a monumental inscription to three of their sons, who, like Lady Dolben, died of smallpox. Dolben's last appointment was to the visitorship of Balliol College, Oxford, on 22 June 1728. He adjudicated in several disputes, and as the modern historian of Balliol contends, exercised his &#145;authority with patient and impartial wisdom&#146;  (J. Jones, <span class="italic">Balliol College</span>, 163). His resignation on 24 March 1755 on health grounds was widely regretted.<br>
<br>As the direct descendant of two primates Dolben might himself have expected a mitre, but the Hanoverian succession in 1714 dashed his hopes of crown preferment. Nevertheless, as a moderate high-churchman, Dolben did his utmost to protect the interests of the Church of England without involving himself publicly in Jacobite politics. Evidence for his direct participation in the Atterbury plot of 1720&#150;22 is inconclusive, though in the 1740s he accepted a gift of Prince Charles Edward Stuart's portrait and was &#145;reckoned a staunch friend to the Pretender, or, at least, to hereditary right&#146;  (Hodgson, 200). Music was a lifelong compensation for his marginalization in the church. Dolben inherited the taste from his father, and was a minor patron in his own right. He presented Finedon church with a magnificent organ in 1717 (probably originally at Windsor) and commissioned the composer William Croft (organist of the Chapel Royal) to provide anthems for the organ's opening and music for his marriage. He was elected a member of the Academy of Vocal Music in 1726.<br>
<br>Dolben suffered from recurrent ill health for the last thirty years of his life; he died at Finedon on 20 November 1756, and was buried there on 11 December. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7780/', "William Dolben (1727&#150;1814)")</script>. He published his sermon on brotherly love (<span class="roman">Heb. 13: 1</span>) preached at the sons of the clergy service at St Paul's Cathedral on 8 December 1726, and an address of 1750 welcoming the new bishop of Durham, Joseph Butler, into his see. Part of his huge theological library was placed in the monk's cell above the south porch at Finedon church as part of a &#145;clerical library&#146; about 1790 by his grandson John English Dolben, later the fourth baronet. Sir John Dolben's career symbolically linked the generation of his own grandfather (and especially Archbishop W. Sancroft and Bishop T. Sprat) to their later Georgian admirers such as George Horne, who preached his first sermon at Finedon, and William Jones (of Nayland), who was Dolben's last curate in the parish. Jones dedicated his first book to Dolben and paid tribute to &#145;your character and station in the Church, your firm attachment to, and experienced knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, your familiar acquaintance with Antiquities, both sacred and profane, and your unblemished life&#146;  (W. Jones, 4).<br>
