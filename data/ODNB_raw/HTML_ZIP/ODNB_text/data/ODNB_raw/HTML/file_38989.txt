<span class="headword">Crittall,  Francis Henry</span>  (1860&#150;1935), <span class="occ">metal window manufacturer</span>, was born on 27 July 1860 at 27 Bank Street, Braintree, Essex, the eighth of the eleven children of Francis Berrington Crittall (<i>d</i>. 1879), an ironmonger, and Fanny Morris, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Godfrey (<i>d</i>. 1879). His parents, from Kent and Rutland respectively, had settled in Braintree in 1849.<br>
<br>Crittall was brought up in a strict nonconformist household and attended private schools in Braintree and Witham. His scholastic achievements were undistinguished, and in 1876 he joined his father and elder brother, Richard, in the family business in metal working and retailing. In 1881, two years after both his parents died, Francis Henry left for Birmingham where he found employment at a manufacturer of metal bedsteads. He attended evening classes in drawing at Birmingham School of Art while there. After a year he started an ironmonger's shop in Chester but in 1883, when his brother decided to give up the family business, Crittall returned to Braintree. In the same year he married Ellen Laura Carter (<i>d</i>. 1934), daughter of a middle-class Baptist family from Birmingham; they had five children. With financial help from a local grocer, Crittall then began to rebuild the Bank Street firm.<br>
<br>Crittall was mainly interested in the practical side of the business, and he concentrated his efforts on the manufacturing of metal products for engineering and architectural purposes from a workshop on the premises. The company's professionalism and the quality of its work established its reputation, and by the late 1880s substantial commissions were being obtained from as far away as Lancashire. Realizing that the future lay in specialized production he persuaded his partners to form a second company, the Crittall Manufacturing Company Ltd, in 1889, specifically for the manufacture of windows and doors. In 1894 this activity moved to a purpose-built factory, the Manor Works, in Braintree.<br>
<br>Under Crittall's energetic leadership, and with an enhanced production capacity, the company prospered, winning several prestigious contracts for specialist metalwork. By the turn of the century a nationwide sales network had been established and in 1904 Crittalls opened an office and showroom in Finsbury Square, London. Three years later the company ventured abroad and started the Detroit Steel Products Company, which first introduced steel windows to the United States. Crittall's two eldest sons, Valentine George (1884&#150;1961) and Walter Francis (1887&#150;1956), were elected to the board at this time.<br>
<br>The firm steadily expanded, and the formation of a casting company in 1911, which by the following year employed 500 people, consolidated Crittall's manufacturing base. With annual sales of &pound;100,000 the company had secured a leading position in the British metal window industry but, despite considerable technical progress, its products were still confined to the luxury market. Crittall was keen to produce domestic windows for mass consumption, but the development was interrupted by the First World War. In 1915 Crittall helped form the East Anglia Munitions Company, comprising forty-two private manufacturing companies, which successfully challenged the monopoly of the official &#145;armaments ring&#146;, with considerable efficiency gains in armaments production. He remained its joint manager for the duration of the war and had the Crittall factories converted for the mass production of munitions components, employing up to 2000 personnel.<br>
<br>The experience thus gained of large-scale production techniques proved useful to the company during the post-war redevelopment phase, as did the Crittall family's many links with progressive architectural and planning circles. The firm played a key role in the campaign to have standardized metal windows accepted in the general domestic market and government housing schemes: Crittall was co-founder and chairman of the Steel Window Association, a combination of twenty-one manufacturers, which from 1919 to 1921 promoted this cause. Some of the company's individual efforts to find practical application for the new technology were also significant, notably the prefabricated houses erected through its subsidiary, the Unit Construction Company (1919&#150;20), and Silver End, the self-sufficient garden village built 1926&#150;32 for its employees.<br>
<br>The 1920s brought rapid growth. Two new Essex factories were added to the expanding Braintree works and in 1924, when Crittalls was floated as a public company, its workforce totalled nearly 2000. It was double that before the end of the decade. In 1922 Crittall stepped down as managing director, a position he had held since 1898, in order to direct the company's overseas development programme. Accompanied by his wife he undertook several world tours between 1921 and 1933 to promote Crittalls' interests, which are described in their joint publication, <span class="italic">Fifty Years of Work and Play</span> (1934). By the time of his death the firm had a global export trade, subsidiaries in eight countries and an authorized share capital of &pound;1.5 million.<br>
<br>Crittall maintained an active involvement in the management of the firm until 1933 but the last years of his life were devoted increasingly to the development of Silver End (where he moved in 1927) and welfare schemes for the Crittall workers. In the latter, as in other matters, he was a progressive, yet he showed little inclination for active political service during his life. He died of heart failure on board ship returning from the Caribbean on 9 March 1935 and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium. The family connection with the company he founded lasted until 1980.<br>
