<span class="headword">Baker,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1741, <em>d.</em> 1818), <span class="occ">writer on theology</span>, was baptized on 24 February 1741 in Great Yarmouth, son and heir of Richard Baker (1702&#150;1774), mayor of that town in 1754 and 1769, and collector of the customs, and his wife, Sarah Laws (<i>d</i>. 1772). He matriculated on 7 March 1758 at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he was a fellow from 1763 and held various college offices. He took the degrees of BA as seventh senior optime in 1762, MA in 1765, and DD in 1788. He was the friend of Thomas Gray, the poet, at Pembroke, one of three college fellows who witnessed the signing of his will on 2 July 1770. In 1797 he presented the college chapel with a painting formerly belonging to Sir Joshua Reynolds, <span class="italic">The Entombment</span> after Barocci.<br>
<br>After his marriage to Elizabeth Harrison (1747/8&#150;1814) in 1772, Baker, who had been ordained priest in the London diocese on 19 February 1769, moved out of college to become rector of Great Poringland, Norfolk, in 1772, on the presentation of the bishop of Norwich, a post he held until 1779. He was also instituted on 6 April 1772 to the lucrative Pembroke living of Cawston, in the same county, where he remained incumbent until his death. He was a diligent parish priest, took pains &#145;with a neglected &amp; abandoned people&#146;, and had a Sunday school with 100 children by the 1790s  (R. Baker to W. W. Bulwer, 23 June 1790, Norfolk RO, BUL 4/118/9). His seniority in the deanery enabled him on occasion to act on behalf of the archdeacon of Norfolk, as during the visitations of 1784 and 1790. His eldest son, Richard, also took holy orders. In 1799 Parson Woodforde was relieved not to appoint this young man his curate at Weston Longueville, &#145;as of late I heard that Dr. Baker and whole Family are very Violent Democrats indeed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 5.195, 26 May 1799). Baker's second son, John Harrison Baker, major of the 34th regiment, was killed at the battle of Toulouse on 11 April 1814, aged thirty-two.<br>
<br>Baker's main work was <span class="italic">The Harmony, or Agreement, of the Four Evangelists, in their Several Relations of the Life and Death of Jesus the Christ</span> (4 pts, 1783&#150;7), in which he juxtaposed extracts from the gospels with the aim of demonstrating their essential consistency. He aimed at a cheap, plain production, &#145;To make the Scriptures more level to every capacity, and to put such an explanation within reach of the Poor&#146;  (preface). He also published a sermon on <span class="roman">John</span> 7: 17, <span class="italic">How the Knowledge of Salvation is Attainable</span>, dated 1782. In 1811 he completed his output with <span class="italic">The Psalms of David Evangelized</span>, a characteristic attempt on his part to make the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> immediately appealing to the ordinary churchgoer. His &#145;amiable and pious&#146;  (memorial inscription, Cawston church) wife died on 13 August 1814, in her sixty-seventh year, and was buried on 17 August in Cawston church. Baker himself died on 6 April 1818, and was buried in the chancel of the same church on 12 April.<br>
