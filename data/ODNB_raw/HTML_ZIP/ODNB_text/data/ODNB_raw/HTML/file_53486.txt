<span class="headword">Reading,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1346), <span class="occ">theologian and Franciscan friar</span>, is first recorded on 20 September 1292, when, already a friar, he was ordained subdeacon. He became a deacon two years later. He was trained at the Franciscan school at Oxford, becoming its forty-fifth lector about 1319, and holding that office for two years. By August 1321 he was DTh. At about this time he went to Avignon, where he revised his commentary on the first book of Peter Lombard's <span class="italic">Sentences</span>, and where he was one of the theologians whom John XXII consulted before he issued his decretal &#145;Antiquae concertationi&#146; on 1 December 1323. He appears to have remained at Avignon, since he is reported to have died and been buried there in 1346.<br>
<br>John Reading was one of Duns Scotus's most loyal and dedicated defenders, particularly against the criticisms of William Ockham. Surprisingly, however, in <i>quaestio</i> 3 of the prologue to Ockham's <span class="italic">Commentary on Book 1 of the &#145;Sentences&#146;</span> Reading appears as one of the sources for Ockham, who quotes him verbatim, picking pieces here and there from <i>quaestio</i> 2 of Reading's prologue to his <span class="italic">Commentary on Lombard's &#145;Sentences&#146;</span>. In short, it seems necessary to postulate that John made two commentaries on Lombard's <span class="italic">Sentences</span>&#151;an earlier one, which was a source for Ockham's <span class="italic">Sentences</span>, and another and later one, criticizing the same work of Ockham. Yet, despite such a postulate, both commentaries had large portions verbally in common, since the text that survives and serves as Ockham's source is the same as the later, and sole surviving, text that provides a Scotistic response to Ockham.<br>
<br>The fact that he became lector at Oxford about 1319, rather than providing a probable date for a sole <span class="italic">Commentary on the &#145;Sentences&#146;</span> by Reading, indicates that he had already, as a bachelor of the <span class="italic">Sentences</span>, commented earlier on Lombard's work. Unlike earlier, more independent, associates of Duns Scotus&#151;Robert Cowton, William of Nottingham, and William of Alnwick&#151;Reading was, from the evidence of his writings, like Walter Chatton, among the more devoted followers of Scotus, for whom Ockham was in competition with Scotus for the leadership of the Franciscan school.<br>
<br>A look at particular questions shows this fervent devotion to Scotus's positions. The postulate of an intelligible impressed species was attacked by many authors as putting an intermediary between the object known and the knower that interfered with the direct knowledge of things. Scotus defended its existence, particularly against Henri de Gand and Godefroi de Fontaines. His arguments were attacked by Ockham and by another Franciscan master, Richard Drayton. Reading defended Scotus against these Franciscan authors and the tradition which supported them. Yet it would be wrong to think that Reading follows Scotus after the manner of a one-book man. In his discussion of finality, he is influenced by Robert Cowton, and even by Pierre Aureole, with whom he finally disagrees. Nor should his frequent conflicts with Ockham be seen as judgements of absolute opposition. Ockham's <span class="italic">Disputed Question &#145;De fine&#146;</span> shows that he has accepted Reading's position with respect.<br>
<br>Regrettably, the only surviving copy of Reading's <span class="italic">Commentary on the &#145;Sentences&#146;</span>, found in Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale, cod. Conv. soppr. D. IV. 95, ends with distinction 6 of book 1. Nevertheless, the manuscript offers a wealth of information about various authors and opinions of his day, and also represents an important chapter in the development of the Scotistic school. As far as Reading himself is concerned, it is possible to say that on the scientific character of theology he disagreed with Thomas Aquinas, and did so on the basis of his agreement with Duns Scotus, that it is impossible to have faith and science concerning the same object. The theologian who receives his principles on faith from God, cannot then claim to have science or scientific knowledge concerning the conclusions he deduces from premises that have faith as their warrant. Likewise, in opposition to two of Scotus's main opponents, Gand and Conington, Reading attempted to establish that there were proper boundaries for certain sciences, and warned that the jurisdiction of theology should not overextend itself into the autonomous domains of those sciences. Finally, the surviving texts show that Reading's main concerns in regard to causality were to clarify the Scotistic notions involved in proving the existence and unicity of God, and to defend these positions against the attacks of William Alnwick, Pierre Aureole, and Ockham.<br>
