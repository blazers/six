<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Robertson,  Douglas Moray Cooper Lamb  Argyll</span>  (1837&#150;1909), <span class="occ">ophthalmic surgeon</span>, born in Edinburgh, was the son of John Argyll Robertson (1798&#150;1855), surgeon and lecturer in the extra-academical school of medicine and president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1846. His father took a special interest in ophthalmic surgery and was one of the founders of the Edinburgh Eye Dispensary in 1822. Douglas was educated successively at the Edinburgh Institution, at Neuwied in Germany, and at the universities of Edinburgh and St Andrews. He graduated MD at St Andrews in 1857, and in the same year was appointed house surgeon at the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh. He then went to Berlin to study ophthalmic surgery under F. W. A. von Graefe. On his return to Edinburgh he acted for several sessions as assistant to John Hughes Bennett, and conducted the first course of practical physiology held in the University of Edinburgh. He was succeeded by William Rutherford. At the time of his appointment, no substance was known that could stimulate the muscle of accommodation and contract the pupil, although atropine was known to dilate it. By experimenting on himself, he proved that physostigmine, the alkaloid of the Calabar bean, would do this. He published his results in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Medical Journal</span> in 1862 and was admitted FRCS Edinburgh in the same year. The following year his former teacher Graefe used physostigmine in the operation of iridectomy, widening Argyll Robertson's fame.<br>
<br>In 1867 Argyll Robertson was appointed assistant ophthalmic surgeon to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary under William Walker, whose colleague he became in 1870. In 1882 Argyll Robertson married Carey, fourth daughter of William Nathaniel Fraser of Findrack and Tornaveen, Aberdeenshire; they had no children.<br>
<br>Walker retired in the same year, and Argyll Robertson remained the sole ophthalmic surgeon to the Infirmary until 1897, when he was appointed consulting surgeon. He lectured on his subject for many years during each summer session. In 1868, the year after his appointment to the university, he described the phenomenon of the tabetic pupil that became known by his name. In cases of syphilis affecting the nervous system, he could not observe any contraction of either pupil when stimulated by light, but when presented with a near object, both pupils contracted. He was able to show that the Calabar bean alkaloid produced further contraction of the pupil. By having agents both to contract and to dilate, he refuted the theory that the size of the pupil depended on the state of relaxation of the blood vessels supplying it, and elucidated the action of the circular muscles.<br>
<br>Argyll Robertson was elected FRSE in 1872 and was president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh for 1886&#150;7. He was the first president (1893&#150;5) of the Ophthalmological Society of Great Britain to be chosen from the ophthalmic surgeons who practised outside London; he presided over the International Ophthalmological Congress in Edinburgh in 1894, and over the Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical Society in 1896. In 1896 the University of Edinburgh conferred on him the honorary degree of LLD. He was also surgeon oculist in Scotland to Queen Victoria and later to King Edward VII.<br>
<br>Argyll Robertson was a noted golfer. He considered it the finest recreation in the world, attributing to it his good health. He won the gold medal of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, St Andrews, five times, and that of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers three times. He was the first captain of the Royal Colleges Golf Club and presented to it a medal, known by his name and awarded annually for the best scratch score. This medal he won himself on two occasions. He was also fond of shooting and was a member of the Royal Archers of the King's Body-Guard for Scotland; and he was a good curler and fisherman.<br>
<br>Argyll Robertson was one of the earliest British specialists in ophthalmic surgery; previously a surgeon adopted this branch of work after a longer or shorter experience of general surgery. As an operator he was neat, rapid, and resourceful, and he introduced into practice several new procedures, especially that of trepanning the sclerotic for the relief of glaucoma.<br>
<br>On retiring from practice in 1904 he settled at Mon Plaisir, St Aubin, Jersey, where he took charge of the eldest daughter of the <i>thakur</i> of Gondal, a former pupil at Edinburgh, and afterwards his friend. In 1892 and 1900 Argyll Robertson visited India and on a third visit in the winter of 1908&#150;9 he died at Gondal, India, on 3 January 1909. He was cremated on the banks of the River Gondli, the thakur sahib himself kindling the funeral pyre of his guru and friend.<br>
