<span class="headword">Atkins, Sir  Hedley John Barnard</span>  (1905&#150;1983), <span class="occ">surgeon and medical administrator</span>, was born on 30 December 1905 at 59 Addison Gardens, Hammersmith, London, the son of Colonel Sir John Atkins, general practitioner, and his wife, Elizabeth May Smith. He had a privileged upbringing in the family of an outstanding general practitioner and he used well the opportunities which this gave. He was educated at Rugby School and Trinity College, Oxford, and then, like his father, at Guy's Hospital, London, where he remained for the rest of his professional life apart from war service. He was academically outstanding, gaining a first-class degree in physiology, an entrance scholarship to Guy's, and the treasurer's gold medal in surgery when he graduated in 1932. He had become FRCS by 1934 and MCh by 1935 and was appointed surgeon to Guy's Hospital in 1936. He married Gladys Gwendoline (<i>b</i>. 1907/8), the daughter of Frank Harding Jones, civil engineer, on 7 December 1933. They had two sons, David and Christopher. They lived in Chester Terrace, London, before moving in 1953 to Down House at Downe, Kent, where in the late 1950s Atkins was curator of the Darwin Museum.<br>
<br>Guy's Hospital was at the heart of the London blitz during the Second World War, and at one point Atkins had to direct its evacuation. Later he served with the Royal Army Medical Corps in north Africa and Italy and was mentioned in dispatches. When he returned to Guy's he wanted to study breast diseases, and he introduced new surgical procedures&#151;for example, for mammary fistula. He was often visited by surgeons from abroad who were invited to take rounds. Atkins saw a great need for clinical research to provide objective evidence of the relative value of different treatments. He was also interested in the basic biology of disease and studied the importance of hormonal influences on breast disease. He edited three volumes entitled <span class="italic">Tools of Biological Research</span> (1959&#150;61), based on lectures delivered to the Surgical Research Society. Atkins also understood clearly the importance of statistical considerations in the design and analysis of clinical studies. He was appointed to the clinical research board of the Medical Research Council in 1959.<br>
<br>In a pioneering study Atkins set up a clinical trial in patients with cancer of the breast to compare how well they did if the tumour was removed locally (lumpectomy) or radically, including the whole breast and other tissues beside. This required clear and original thinking since it seemed obvious and was generally believed at the time that it would be more effective to remove as much tissue as possible. He also planned for the study to be large enough and meticulous so that the results would be conclusive, and he had the personality to persuade, enthuse, and carry it through. However, Atkins also took great care over the ethical side of the trial, thinking more of the welfare of the patient than the success of the trial. It was successfully concluded and published but in the end the problem was too complex to be solved by a single study, however careful. The results depended on the exact type and stage of tumour treated, and showed that even in favourable cases there could be recurrences if the tumour was removed locally. Thus other treatments were added to improve the outcome: Atkins used irradiation, but chemotherapy and more specific drugs like tamoxifen were later developed. Clinical trials of a range of treatments and combinations are now run by centres around the world, and step by step the treatment of breast cancer continues to improve. However, the <span class="italic">Oxford Textbook of Surgery</span> (1994) in laying out the evidence (p. 822) still starts the exposition with the &#145;Guy's trials&#146;, the first of which was the one organized by Atkins; he was also the editor of <span class="italic">The Treatment of Breast Cancer</span> (1974).<br>
<br>Atkins was known as a kindly and clear teacher and a good colleague at Guy's Hospital, where he overcame innate conservatism to be appointed the first professor of surgery. His teaching was lively, spiced with humour and memorable anecdotes. He would say frankly at times that he did not know something and it often turned out that nobody else knew either! Later a specialist breast unit at New Cross Hospital in London was named after him.<br>
<br>Atkins served the Royal College of Surgeons on the court of examiners and council, and he was vice-president and then president between 1966 and 1969. He enjoyed this role and also his presidency of the Surgical Research Society in 1960. In addition he served on the Medical Research Council and on many committees and working groups. He was knighted in 1967 and became an honorary fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, in 1968. Atkins was a very competent and warm-hearted chairman of the Medical Research Council committee charged with overseeing research on the remarkable little group of inhabitants of Tristan da Cunha driven by the volcano from their island. Work was organized so that they could be given security, privacy, and good medical care while records and specimens were collected by their doctors and a few others. The data provided material for scores of scientists, who made original and important observations by their study.<br>
<br>Atkins lectured at many surgical centres around the world and at one time served as the Arthur Sims Commonwealth travelling professor. He gave many eponymous formal lectures, some of which were published. These all indicate the breadth of his interests and learning. They include <span class="italic">Surgical Research&#151;a New Look</span>, which appeared in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Medical Society of London</span> (vol. 79, 1962&#150;3), and &#145;A small library&#146;, published in the <span class="italic">Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons</span> (vol. 49, 1971). Two books arose from his time in north Africa, and he also wrote a book of memoirs published in 1977. The Royal College of Surgeons acquired Down House, the residence for many years of Charles Darwin and his family. The lower floor was kept as a museum and Atkins lived above as curator for some years and published <span class="italic">Down, the Home of the Darwins</span> (1974). He immersed himself in the life story of Darwin and his remarkably talented family and contemporaries. He lectured and wrote on their history, and on the manifestations of genius in general, in a scholarly but readable way.<br>
<br>Atkins was a big man physically, with a fresh outdoor complexion and a lively demeanour. He was a keen rugby player and followed the hospital team closely. He also enjoyed sailing with his family, and gardening after he retired. His intellect was also well developed. He studied classics at school and acquired an interest and facility in the use of words, and he had a lifelong habit of reading. He was also a clear and fluent speaker who rarely used notes. He insisted that he was neither a bibliophile nor a book collector but that his library was composed of volumes that he read and reread. They ranged from poetry and English literature to his favourites, astronomy and mathematics, and he also had a collection on surgical topics. He described an occasion when he sat with his tutor C. N. Hinshelwood by the fire at Oxford, playing a game in which they each quoted to the other &#145;the most arresting piece of prose and the most enchanting piece of poetry&#146; they could think of. He wrote that he wished he could have been a scientist, especially an astronomer or mathematician. Those who knew him best thought that this would have been a loss, because medicine would then have been deprived of his many contributions to the improvement of surgery through clinical science&#151;which he made while remaining a truly caring individual, aware of the riches of literature and the humanities. He died at Down House of cancer on 26 November 1983, survived by his wife.<br>
