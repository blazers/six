<span class="headword">Pulteney <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Johnstone]</span>, Sir  William</span>, fifth baronet  (1729&#150;1805), <span class="occ">politician and property developer</span>, was born William Johnstone on 19 October 1729 at Westerhall, Dumfriesshire, the third son of Sir James Johnstone MP, third baronet (1697&#150;1772), and the Hon. Barbara Murray (<i>d</i>. 1773), daughter of the fourth Lord Elibank. Little is known of his childhood or early education until he attended prelections on history and Roman antiquities with Dr Charles Mackie at Edinburgh University in 1746&#150;7. He was admitted to the Scottish bar on 16 July 1751. From references in the correspondence of contemporaries such as Adam Smith and Sir John Sinclair it seems that he lived the life of an intelligent, if impoverished, young lawyer in literary and intellectual circles in Edinburgh. As a younger son he was dependent upon the patronage of senior members of the family to obtain appointments but surviving correspondence reveals that at an early stage he was developing a reputation as a sound political and financial adviser. He remained close to his family, particularly to his brothers George and John and his unmarried sister Betty, who cared for their, often difficult, parents.<br>
<br>Johnstone left Edinburgh for London in 1759 when he was appointed to a post worth &pound;400 a year in customs and excise. He was now in possession of a secure income and on 10 November 1760 married Frances (1728?&#150;1782), daughter and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22886/', "Daniel Pulteney MP")</script>, whose means were then similar to his own. Johnstone's employment allowed him to return to Edinburgh and the couple lived comparatively modestly until the unexpected deaths in quick succession of Frances Johnstone's cousin, Viscount Pulteney, in 1763, and his father, William Pulteney, earl of Bath, in 1764. Lord Bath's immense fortune was entailed upon his 79-year-old bachelor brother General Harry Pulteney but on his death in 1767 it passed to Frances Johnstone. The Johnstones, who had returned to live in London, immediately adopted the Pulteney name and moved to General Pulteney's home, Bath House, Piccadilly, from Cleveland Row, St James's. Their only child to survive infancy, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59519/', "(Henrietta) Laura Pulteney")</script>, had been born the previous year, on 26 December 1766.<br>
<br>His developing interest in politics led to Pulteney's return to parliament for Cromarty in 1768, following an unsuccessful attempt at Shrewsbury, in which the Pulteney family had an interest, in the same year. In 1775 he was successful at Shrewsbury and represented the borough until his death. Pulteney remained independent and there is no evidence that he actively sought office. His principal interests were in financial and economic matters, which encompassed American and East Indian affairs, agriculture, fisheries, and transport throughout Great Britain. In all of these he had, or developed, a personal financial interest.<blockquote>He possessed a sound understanding and his opinion was always received in the House with respect for full attention. As a public man, no commoner understood the Constitution of a country better, or more uniformly supported it by his conduct. (<span class="italic">GM</span>)</blockquote>During a period of great parliamentary turbulence in 1797&#150;8 a proposal was mooted for the establishment of a third party to form a government and Pulteney was identified, by others, as a likely chancellor of the exchequer. James Gillray recorded the episode in a caricature entitled <span class="italic">Le tr&eacute;sorier</span> on 21 May 1798.<br>
<br>Pulteney's American interests appear to have stemmed from the appointment of his brother George Johnstone as governor of West Florida in 1763 and existing Johnstone family interests in the West Indies. On the outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1776 he and his brother George, by then also an MP, became involved in attempts at reconciliation. George Johnstone joined the earl of Carlisle's peace mission to America while Pulteney undertook a secret mission, under the alias of Mr Williams, to Paris to attempt negotiations with Benjamin Franklin, the American ambassador to France. Neither initiative bore fruit but subsequently Pulteney made his views known in pamphlets criticizing government policy, pointing out the cost of the American war, and supporting a more generous treatment of the rebellious colonists.<br>
<br>Pulteney applied a similar approach to Indian affairs. His brother John Johnstone held a post with the East India Company, and the brothers corresponded regularly on Indian affairs. In 1783 Pulteney wrote a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The Effects to be Expected from the East India Bill upon the Constitution of Great Britain</span> criticizing Fox's policies and setting out his views on a proper relationship with the subcontinent.<br>
<br>While pursuing his political interests, Pulteney was engaged in schemes for the management and development of his wife's extensive estates in London and Bath. The Bath estate offered the greatest potential for building development and to exploit this he promoted an act of parliament in 1769 allowing the bridging of the Avon between the old city and the parish of Bathwick on the east bank. Robert Adam, an Edinburgh contemporary and friend, was commissioned to design the estate but in the event only the Pulteney Bridge was built according to his plans. The bridge and the Great Pulteney Street development, which took place over the next thirty years, remain the greatest visible monuments to Pulteney's endeavours.<br>
<br>Frances Pulteney died in 1782 and Pulteney was then responsible for managing the estates on behalf of his daughter, Henrietta Laura, as her mother's heir. His role diminished on her marriage in 1794 to Sir James Murray, seventh baronet (1751&#150;1811), his first cousin, who changed his name to Pulteney on marriage. Pulteney had earlier used his influence to have his daughter created Baroness Bath in her own right in 1792. She was advanced to the rank of countess of Bath in 1803.<br>
<br>Pulteney had always been interested in agricultural improvements and originally experimented at Solway Bank, his own small estate near Lockerbie in Dumfriesshire. He subsequently applied the same principles to his wife's estates in Staffordshire, Shropshire, Montgomeryshire, Northamptonshire, and Somerset. At Solway Bank there were also fisheries which he developed and improved and his experience here was later applied nationally in Scotland through his role in the British Fisheries Society, of which he was director from 1790 to 1805. He was particularly concerned with highland fisheries and he is commemorated in the nineteenth century development of Wick, known as Pulteney Town.<br>
<br>The opening up and development of the highlands was made possible by road construction in which Thomas Telford, a native of Westerhall and a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Pulteney's, was much involved, as he was in earlier road and canal construction on the Pulteneys' other estates. Because of his modest nature the true extent of Pulteney's patronage is largely unrecorded, but although careful he was not ungenerous. When Andrew Stuart, a close friend and political associate, became financially embarrassed Pulteney granted him an annuity of &pound;400. He encouraged not only Thomas Telford but the children of friends and prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, including William Pulteney Allison, sometime president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, and Admiral Sir Pulteney Malcolm who served under Lord Nelson and whose father came from Westerhall. His public benefactions included the endowment of the chair of agriculture in the University of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>From 1791, as part of the <i>rapprochement</i> with the USA, Pulteney invested heavily in American stock and then began his greatest speculation of all by buying 1 million acres in upper New York state, of which a new town of Bath became the centre. Largely through the work of his agent Colonel Charles Williamson, the scheme was so successful that by 1802 the whole area was opened up and the initial investment of &pound;250,000 was valued at &pound;2 million.<br>
<br>Always a frugal man, with few personal social aspirations and of unpretentious appearance and demeanour, Pulteney lived quietly between Bath House and Shrewsbury, where with Telford's assistance he adapted the ruinous castle as a house. The only doubts recorded about his conduct relate to his apparent failure to attend appropriately to the early social needs of his daughter, who was noted as the richest heiress of her day, but who appears to have been somewhat eccentric and who eventually married a professional soldier many years her senior.<br>
<br>In 1794, on the death of his older brother James Johnstone, Pulteney became fifth baronet and inherited the Westerhall estate together with plantations and slaves in the West Indies. On 3 January 1804 Pulteney married his second wife, Margaret, daughter of Sir William Stirling, bt, of Ardoch and widow of his old friend Andrew Stuart.<br>
<br>Pulteney died on 30 May 1805 at Bath House, Piccadilly, London, and was buried in the south cloister of Westminster Abbey on 11 June 1805 next to his first wife, Frances, and at the foot of the monument to her father, Daniel Pulteney. No monument to him or his wife or his daughter, who died in 1808, was ever erected. Surprisingly, for such a rich and careful man, he died intestate. His personal estate in England passed to his widow and daughter and was valued at over &pound;600,000. The landed estates in England and the overseas properties passed to the countess of Bath and his Scottish properties passed to his nephew Sir George Johnstone of Westerhall, sixth baronet.<br>
