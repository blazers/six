<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pringle, Sir  John</span>, first baronet  (1707&#150;1782), <span class="occ">military physician</span>, was born on 10 April 1707 at Stichill House, in the Scottish border county of Roxburghshire, the youngest son of Sir John Pringle, baronet, and his wife, Magdalen, sister of Sir Gilbert Elliott, baronet, of Stobs. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22806/', "Robert Pringle")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22809/', "Sir Walter Pringle")</script> were his uncles. After receiving private tuition at home Pringle attended St Andrews, Scotland's oldest university, where his uncle Francis was professor of Greek. Pringle matriculated in 1722 in St Leonard's College, and in 1727 entered Edinburgh University.<br>
<br>It appears that Pringle was intending to pursue a career in commerce and was sent to Amsterdam to gain some knowledge of business. During his stay there he paid a visit to Leiden and heard a lecture by the renowned physician Hermann Boerhaave, which made him decide to follow a career in medicine. He then went to Leiden to take his studies further. From student age Pringle maintained contact with Flanders and Holland, where he would later return to earn his great reputation as a military physician and epidemiologist. Pringle graduated MD at Leiden in 1730, his thesis diploma, &#145;De marcore senili&#146;, being signed by Boerhaave, C. B. Albinus, and W. J. Gravesande. He then completed his medical studies in Paris. Four years after graduating MD and starting practice in Edinburgh, Pringle was appointed joint professor of pneumatics (metaphysics) and moral philosophy in Edinburgh University. The appointment did not stop him from practising medicine. Pringle's move into military medicine was probably because of local connections. The earl of Stair, a nobleman whose lands lay only a short way north of Roxburgh, and who knew the Pringle family, appointed him his physician. Lord Stair was then general officer commanding the British army on the continent. Dr Stevenson, a prominent Edinburgh physician, also advanced Pringle's career. Again through the good offices of the earl of Stair, in 1742 Pringle was appointed physician to the army in Flanders. He achieved further advancement after the retirement of the earl of Stair, when the duke of Cumberland appointed him physician-general in 1744. He now resigned his professorship in Edinburgh. His service ran from the fall of Walpole, through the campaign launched by the French into the Austrian Netherlands, to the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748. Pringle's great innovations encompassed both administration and epidemiology. It was probably owing to his efforts that military hospitals were first recognized as neutral territory and safely set up near a battlefield. At the battle of Dettingen in 1743, the last in which a British king led his army into battle, British and French hospitals under a temporary red cross and with the agreement of the duc de Noailles, the French commander, were set up side by side, each taking wounded from the other army if the occasion arose.<br>
<br>Although Pringle left the physician-general's post in 1748&#151;he had been posted back to Britain during the 1745 Jacobite rising and was present at the battle of Culloden in 1746&#151;he did not publish his <span class="italic">Observations on the Diseases of the Army</span> until 1752. This watershed work has probably not received the credit it deserves. Like his countryman James Lind, Pringle had quickly recognized hospitals as the chief causes of sickness and death in the army. His special contributions were the first scientific account of epidemiology in the field and prevention of cross-infection. In his own words, as expressed in the fourth edition of his <span class="italic">Observations</span>:<blockquote>in the camp, the contagion (of dysentery) passes from one who is ill to his companion in the same tent, and from them perhaps to the next. The foul straw becomes very infectious. But of what nature is this infection? In the former editions of this work, I considered the spreading of the distemper as owing to putrid exhalations of the humours of those who first fell ill of it; and that when this <i>miasma</i> is received into the blood, I conceived it to act upon the whole mass as a ferment, disposing it to putrefaction &hellip; But having since perused the curious dissertation, published by <i>Linnaeus</i>, in favour of <i>Kircher's</i> system of contagion by animalcula, it seems reasonable to suspend all <i>hypotheses</i>, till the matter is further enquired into. (<span class="italic">Observations</span>, 4th edn, 24&#150;5)</blockquote>In his thinking he was influenced by the great men of Leiden: &#145;Leeuwenhoeck had shown &#147;small insects&#148; in the pustules of scabies, under the microscope &hellip; So the frequency of the itch is not to be ascribed to change of air or diet, but to the infection propagated by a few such.&#146; Pringle also began to think in terms of &#145;septic&#146; and &#145;antiseptic&#146;: &#145;The faeces are rendered less, if at all infectious, by means of a strong acid combined with the parts that are really septic&#151;especially, in the dysentery, where the faeces are highly corrupted and contagious&#146;  (ibid., 103&#150;4). He even considered the systemic use of such &#145;antiseptics&#146;: &#145;were putrefaction the only change made in the body by contagion, it would be easy to cure such fevers, at any period, by the use of acids, or other antiseptics&#146;  (ibid., 258).<br>
<br>From 1748 Pringle settled in London and continued in medical practice. He entered into the period of his life when he published a series of papers and received a succession of honours. In 1749 he became physician-in-ordinary to the duke of Cumberland. In 1750 he published <span class="italic">Observations on the Nature and Cure of Hospital and Jayl Fevers</span>, and, in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span>, &#145;Experiments upon septic and antiseptic substances, with remarks relating to their use in the theory of medicine&#146;. For the latter he received the Copley gold medal in 1752 from the society, of which he had been admitted a fellow in 1745. His &#145;Account of persons seized with the gaol fever while working in Newgate&#146; appeared in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> in 1753. Pringle became a council member of the Royal Society in 1753, LRCP in 1758, FRCP in 1763, <i>speciali gratia</i>, physician to the queen in 1761, president of the Royal Society in 1772, and in 1766 was created a baronet. He was gazetted physician-in-ordinary to the king in 1774. On 14 April 1752 Pringle had married Charlotte, the second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20736/', "William Oliver")</script>, an eminent physician of Bath; they had no children. In 1778 Pringle resigned as president of the Royal Society. His resignation has usually been ascribed to his ill health, as it preceded his return to Scotland, where he was soon known to have been failing. However, recent evidence shows that Pringle may have been forced to resign following his difference of opinion with George III on the best shape of lightning conductors. Carl van Doren, in his <span class="italic">Life of Benjamin Franklin</span>, writes that &#145;because Pringle would not sustain the king in this prejudice [that blunt lightning conductors were superior] he was forced to resign as president of the Royal Society and dismissed from his post as royal physician&#146;. He returned briefly to Edinburgh, but Edinburgh did not cheer his spirits. While there he presented a manuscript collection of his &#145;Medical and physical observations&#146; in ten volumes to the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh and to St Andrews. Pringle was also the author of the first biography of General James Wolfe, published in 1760. In 1781 he was back in London, and soon after, on 14 January 1782 had a probable stroke while at his club, Watson's in the Strand. He died on 18 January 1782, aged seventy-four. He was buried in St James's Church, Piccadilly. A monument was erected in his memory at Westminster Abbey; his name was celebrated in eulogies by Vicq d'Azyr and Condorcet at the French Academy. Through his life his religious belief varied&#151;he was a Unitarian for a time&#151;but he became &#145;very diligent in reading sermons and Scripture in his later life&#146;. In politics he was a strong whig. While he loved music, he had no liking for poetry. His portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds shows him to look somewhat severe, with a high cheek colour. His letters and writings, however, show him a pleasantly civil person.<br>
