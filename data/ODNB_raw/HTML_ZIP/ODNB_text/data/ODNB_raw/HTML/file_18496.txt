<span class="headword">Medina, Sir  John Baptiste  de</span>  (1659&#150;1710), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Brussels, the son of a Spanish officer serving in the Southern Netherlands whom George Vertue calls &#145;Captain Medina de L'Asturias&#146;. His mother's identity is unknown. Little is known of his training, beyond an apprenticeship with Fran&ccedil;ois Duchatel. In this workshop Medina would have acquired the technique and the rather formal manner of later Flemish portrait painting, although at some stage his style acquired the more painterly breadth associated with Sir Godfrey Kneller, whose origins were Dutch rather than Flemish.<br>
<br>At some time about 1686 Medina was attracted by the possibilities of the London market, where Kneller was already firmly established. There is no evidence that he ever rivalled Kneller during the period of eight or nine years that he spent in London before eventually settling in Scotland. This is confirmed by a comparison of their prices, Medina's being only one-third of Kneller's&#151;for example, &pound;8 as opposed to &pound;24 for a three-quarter length portrait. Although Medina was primarily a portrait painter, among his earliest recorded works in London was a series of eight illustrations (V&amp;A) for an illustrated edition of Milton's <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>, published in 1688 by Jacob Tonson in association with the barrister John Somers. These wash drawings are slight, and derivative, vaguely Rubensian in manner. Throughout his career Medina also produced a number of subject paintings, usually small in scale, which have a higher quality of draughtsmanship than his portraits. These include <span class="italic">Prometheus</span>, <span class="italic">Cain and Abel</span> (priv. coll.), and, the finest of those known, <span class="italic">Apelles and Campaspe</span> (priv. coll.). By the early 1690s Medina was running a productive portrait workshop in Drury Lane. Among his clients were members of the Scottish nobility, no doubt attracted by his reasonable prices. One of these was George Melville, first earl of Melville, whose cousin Margaret, countess of Rothes, was instrumental in persuading Medina to move to Edinburgh to fill the void in the Scottish portrait market. After a temporary visit with an array of partially completed canvases he finally settled there, along with his wife, Jeanne Marie Vandale, and their children&#151;John (who became a painter), William, Gisberta, Katherine, Elizabeth, and Anne. Two of these are the subjects of an intimate and lively double portrait (priv. coll.).<br>
<br>Medina's earliest commissions in Scotland were from members of Melville's family, including his son David, third earl of Leven, whose three-quarter length portrait of 1691 has a not unconvincing baroque panache (Scot. NPG). The circle of Melville and his son encompassed a wide spectrum of Scottish society and provided Medina with the basis of a highly lucrative practice. There is a slightly mechanical air to many of these portraits, as might be expected in a virtual monopoly, lively heads not always convincingly attached to draped or armoured bodies. However, a less contrived head and shoulders portrait of the learned Sir John Clerk of Penicuik (priv. coll.) shows Medina working in a fresh, observational manner not much inferior to Kneller.<br>
<br>About the turn of the century Sir John Clerk's cousin William Aikman, a minor landowner who wished to become a painter, joined Medina to learn the craft, although he was not formally apprenticed. He may have been involved in a major project that Medina accomplished between about 1697 and 1708&#151;a series of twenty-nine portraits of members of the Royal College of Surgeons. At the request of the surgeons, Medina added his self-portrait to the group, as explained in detail in a <i>cartellino</i> within the painting (Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh). This inclusion was evidence of the status Medina had gained within Scottish society, and it was further confirmed by a grant of naturalization by the soon to be dissolved Scottish parliament. Shortly afterwards he received the rare honour of a knighthood, the last, as it happened, to be granted in an independent Scotland. Despite the relative artificiality of much of his portraiture, and its uneven quality, Sir John Medina created an image of Scotland around the years of the union that remains historically significant.<br>
<br>Medina died in Edinburgh on 5 October 1710 and was buried the following day in Greyfriars churchyard. He left considerable wealth to his widow, and his elder son, John (<i>d</i>. 1764), carried on the business. The latter's son, <a name="cosubject_18496"></a><span class="headword">John Medina</span>  (1721&#150;1796), who was born in Edinburgh was also a <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>. He restored the pictures at Holyrood Palace and made several copies of the &#145;Ailsa&#146; portrait of Mary Queen of Scots. He resided in London for a short time, and exhibited portraits at the Royal Academy in 1772 and 1773. He died at Edinburgh on 27 September 1796, in his seventy-sixth year. Examples of his work are in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.<br>
