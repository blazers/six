<span class="headword">Montibus <span class="st"> [Monte]</span>,  William  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1213), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, was born in Wigford, a suburb of Lincoln. There is evidence of a de Montibus family in Wigford in cartularies of the thirteenth century. The surname under which he was once known&#151;&#145;of Leicester&#146;&#151;seems to have been first applied to William, erroneously, by John Bale, who confused William with one of his students, Richard Wetheringsett of Leicester, who quotes William copiously in his very popular <i>summa</i>, <span class="italic">Qui bene presunt</span>  (Goering, 153). As a youth William was raised in the household of Gilbert of Sempringham (<i>d</i>. 1189). He travelled to Paris, perhaps in the 1160s, where he studied theology under Peter Comestor and other masters, and then opened his own school of theology on Mont-Ste Genevi&egrave;ve, just outside the walls of Paris. Gerald of Wales and Alexander Neckam both knew him there. William was one of a number of famous theologians at Paris during the last part of the twelfth century whose teachings were characterized by their interest in practical, pastoral theology and in the training of clergy for exercising the care of souls. In the 1180s William was invited back to England by Bishop Hugh of Lincoln (<i>d</i>. 1200). He spent the last thirty years of his life at the head of the cathedral school in Lincoln, which was, during William's time, among the most famous in England. He served as chancellor of the cathedral from at least 1194 until his death in 1213.<br>
<br>Gerald of Wales asserts that he was first called William de Monte because of his school on Mont-Ste Genevi&egrave;ve, and that he came to be called William de Montibus when he began teaching on the second &#145;mount&#146;, in the cathedral close at Lincoln. William de Montibus was perhaps the most famous theologian of his day in England. He composed four encyclopaedic <i>summae</i> to aid students in his school. One is an introduction to theology entitled <span class="italic">Numerale</span>  (Goering, 230&#150;35), wherein William discusses basic theological topics arranged according to the numbers from one to twelve (One God, Two testaments &hellip; Twelve articles of faith). Three of his <i>summae</i> make use of the new experiments in alphabetical organization. His <span class="italic">Distinctiones theologice</span>  (ibid., 265&#150;7) collects theological and scriptural terms and distinguishes their usages. His <span class="italic">Proverbia</span>  (ibid., 338) organizes more than 5000 Latin proverbs and quotations under 281 alphabetically ordered subject headings. One of his latest and most ambitious works is the <span class="italic">Versarius</span>  (ibid., 397&#150;8), in which nearly 4400 lines of verse, many of them composed and commented upon by the author himself, are presented under some 900 alphabetically ordered headings. One of William's poems, known by its first words, <span class="italic">Peniteas cito peccator</span>, circulated independently as a guide to hearing and making confessions; it became one of the most popular didactic poems in Europe in the following centuries, and was printed, along with William's gloss, at least fifty-one times between 1485 and 1520. His other writings include several treatises on penance, a guide to theological tropes and scriptural interpretation, a commentary on the <span class="roman">Psalms</span>, theological questions on the seven sacraments, and a verse summation of the sacraments, several collections of sermons, and a number of pastoral letters addressed to the nuns of the Gilbertine order.<br>
<br>William de Montibus died in Scotland in April 1213, while England was under papal interdict, and his body was transferred to Lincoln Cathedral for reburial in 1214 after the interdict was lifted. Matthew of Rievaulx composed four sets of memorial verses in William's honour, comparing him favourably with Augustine and Gregory the Great. Alexander Neckam praised William in his <span class="italic">Laus sapientie divine</span> as a &#145;steadfast mountain and a pillar of the faith, who gave himself wholly to the study of theology&#146;  (<span class="italic">Alexandri Neckam</span>, 460).<br>
