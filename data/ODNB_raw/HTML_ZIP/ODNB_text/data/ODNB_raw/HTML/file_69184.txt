<span class="headword">Cummings,  (Arthur Stuart) Michael</span>  (1919&#150;1997), <span class="occ">cartoonist</span>, was born on 1 June 1919 at 99 Spencer Place, Leeds, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32662/', "Arthur John Cummings (1882&#150;1957)")</script>, political editor of the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>, and his wife, Nora Suddards, an artist. Following education at The Hall, Hampstead, London, and Gresham's School, Holt, Norfolk, he studied at Chelsea School of Art, London, where he was taught by Graham Sutherland and specialized in etching. It was there that in 1939 he drew his first cartoon for the left-wing journal <span class="italic">The Tribune</span>, edited by the future Labour leader Michael Foot. Cummings's studies were then interrupted by the Second World War. He was called up for service in the Royal Air Force and posted to the Air Ministry, where he put his artistic ability to good use as a draughtsman, drawing aeroplane parts for the duration. On discharge he resumed his arts studies at Chelsea and also his contributions to <span class="italic">The Tribune</span>, with Foot giving him regular work as an illustrator for the book-review page.<br>
<br>In 1948 Cummings had just secured a post as art teacher at St Albans Grammar School for Girls, Hertfordshire, when his father suggested he apply for a cartooning position on the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, where he had learned that the regular cartoonist, Giles, was seeking relief from his demanding schedule. The proprietor, Lord Beaverbrook, a lover of cartoons, could see Cummings's potential, and he was taken on for a trial period by the paper's editor, Arthur Christiansen, who appointed him to alternate with Giles and as political cartoonist in place of the popular Strube, whom Christiansen had sacked the previous year after a disagreement. This could have served as an omen for Cummings, who was himself dismissed at the end of his three months' probation after finding it difficult to maintain a consistent level of originality. But Beaverbrook intervened and Cummings was reinstated.<br>
<br>Apart from his responsibility as political cartoonist, the arrangement was that Cummings and Giles should share the regular production of editorial cartoons. They drew three cartoons a week each, with Cummings producing an additional one for the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span> from 1958. He also worked for <span class="italic">Punch</span>, originally signing himself A. S. M. Cummings but later simply Cummings; he took over its &#145;Essence of parliament&#146; illustrations from A. W. Lloyd in 1953. That same year, while working in France, he met his future wife, Anne-Marie Monique Pittier, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lethel (<i>b</i>. 1928/9), the daughter of Michel Henri Lethel, director of the French Red Cross. They were married at Kensington register office, London, on 23 March 1956, and made their home at 8 Falkland House, Marloes Road, west London.<br>
<br>Cummings had at first adopted a delicate style in his work for <span class="italic">The Tribune</span>, but on the <span class="italic">Express</span> progressed to a bolder technique, with an abundance of solid black areas. He roughed out his cartoons in pencil on A3 paper, producing usually six drawings from which the editor chose one, and used a dip pen and brush with Pelikan black ink on Daler board for the finished work. Like Stanley McMurtry (&#145;Mac&#146;), he often concealed an image of his wife in his cartoons.<br>
<br>Cummings spared no one in his choice of political subjects, and though his Conservatism and patriotism led him to treat Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher with respect, others were less fortunate and were portrayed in a style that sometimes descended into crude caricature. Cummings was Churchill's favourite cartoonist, and claimed to be the only political cartoonist to have drawn every British prime minister from Churchill to Tony Blair. A distinctive feature of his drawings were the explanatory labels that he added, with hand-drawn speech and thought bubbles in the manner of Gillray and other eighteenth-century caricaturists. Some of his depictions were controversial. A 1960s cartoon showing a cargo-load of golliwogs arriving in Britain caused complaints, and print unions prevented publication of the Scottish edition of the <span class="italic">Express</span> containing a drawing of President Brezhnev dressed as a Roman Catholic priest with a consignment of tanks marked &#145;IRA&#146;.<br>
<br>A long-standing member of the Garrick Club, Cummings was a founder member of the British Cartoonists' Association in 1966. He was appointed OBE in 1983. He died of cancer at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London, on 9 October 1997. He was survived by his wife Anne-Marie, and a stepson, Jean-Marc.<br>
