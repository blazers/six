<span class="headword">Stephanoff,  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1786&#150;1874), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was born in Brompton Row, London, the son of Fileter N. Stephanoff (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1790), a Russian who settled in England and painted decorative ceilings, stage scenery at the Haymarket and at the circus in St George's Fields, and made portraits and tinted landscape drawings. Of an unstable temperament, F. N. Stephanoff committed suicide about 1790. Stephanoff's mother, Gertrude, of German descent, was an accomplished flower painter, much patronized by Sir Joseph Banks. She taught drawing to young ladies, including, presumably, her daughter M. G. Stephanoff, also a flower painter. Gertrude Stephanoff died at Brompton on 7 January 1808. Stephanoff entered the Royal Academy Schools in February 1801, and from about 1808 exhibited with several institutions and societies, including the Associated Artists in Water Colours (of which he became a member in 1811), the Royal Academy (from 1810), and the Old Watercolour Society (OWCS, of which he was elected an associate in 1819 and with whom he continued to exhibit until 1859). Many of his exhibited works drew on literary and art historical subjects, and some of these were engraved for the annuals. With his wife, Lucy Allen, he had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>James Stephanoff excelled in the representation of public ceremonies and historical incidents that required the skilful grouping of large numbers of figures. These included <span class="italic">The Fair Held in Hyde Park in 1814</span>; <span class="italic">The Interior of the House of Lords during the Important Investigation of 1820</span> (&#145;The trial of Queen Caroline&#146;; engraved by J. G. Murray); <span class="italic">Interior of the House of Commons during the Reform Era</span>; and <span class="italic">Reception of the Queen by the Lord Mayor on 9 Nov. 1837</span>. With Charles Wild and A. C. Pugin he produced drawings for W. H. Pyne's <span class="italic">The History of the Royal Residences of Windsor Castle, St. James's Palace, Carlton House, Kensington Palace, Hampton Court, Buckingham House and Frogmore</span> (1819), a work that has subsequently been drawn on by architectural and design historians for its detailed recording of interior design and furnishing. With his brother <a href="#cosubject_26363">Philip Stephanoff [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and separately, he contributed drawings to Sir George Nayler's sumptuous <span class="italic">The Coronation of His Most Sacred Majesty George IV</span> (1824, 1837), including, with A. C. Pugin, who worked on the architectural parts, a large watercolour of the coronation. In 1830 he was appointed historical painter in watercolours to William IV.<br>
<br>Stephanoff was a member of the Sketching Society after its reformulation by the Chalon brothers in 1808. He was much interested in antiquarian matters and made drawings of St Cuthbert's stole, at Durham, for the Society of Antiquaries. Mallalieu noted, however, that Stephanoff &#145;was among the first to paint historical scenes as pictures rather than as engravers' material&#151;although many prints were in fact made after his work&#146;  (Mallalieu, <span class="italic">Watercolour artists</span>, 246). His most important works of this kind were the series of six watercolour drawings, exhibited at the Old Watercolour Society between 1817 and 1845, of Greek and Roman antiquities at the British Museum. In his article &#145;James Stephanoff and the British Museum&#146; Ian Jenkins noted that &#145;they do not show real views of the museum interior; instead, antiquities are placed in idealized settings, more glamorous than the actual arrangements&#146;, that offer &#145;a colourful insight into contemporary taste&#146;  (Jenkins, 174). The first of the series, entitled <span class="italic">The Connoisseur</span> (exh. OWCS, 1817; ex Sothebys, 13 July 1979, drawings, lot 97), features many of the contents of the Townley Gallery. (Stephanoff's link with the collector Charles Townley is further indicated by drawings in the British Museum of Townley's antiquities signed &#145;Stephanoff del.&#146;) Two other views in the series, <span class="italic">An Apartment Containing the Phygalian Marbles</span> (exh. 1818; BM) and <span class="italic">The Virtuoso</span> (1833; BM), include, in the former, marbles recovered from the ruins of the temple of Apollo at Bassae, which arrived at the museum in 1815, and, in the latter, the Elgin marbles, purchased by Lord Elgin in 1816.<br>
<br>James Stephanoff resigned his membership of the Old Watercolour Society in 1861 and retired to Bristol, where he died at his home, 6 Frederick Place, Clifton, on 4 July 1874. Examples of his work are also to be found in the Cartwright Hall, Bradford; the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh; and the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_26363"></a><span class="headword">Philip Francis Stephanoff</span>  (1787/8&#150;1860), <span class="occ">painter</span>, the younger brother of James Stephanoff, was also born in Brompton Row, London. He entered the Royal Academy Schools in December 1801, when his first name was recorded as Philliter and his age as thirteen. At the age of sixteen his <span class="italic">The Lay of the Last Minstrel</span>, a subject from the poem by Sir Walter Scott, was much admired by the sculptor Thomas Flaxman. Philip Stephanoff became a popular painter of historical and genre subjects and of fruit paintings, working in both oils and watercolours, and exhibited at the Royal Academy and the British Institution from 1807 to 1845, with the Associated Artists in Water colours in 1809 (of which he became a member in 1811), and with the Old Watercolour Society from 1813 to 1820. Joseph Farington recorded in his diary that Stephanoff was a candidate for election to the Royal Academy in 1818.<br>
<br>Stephanoff's historical and subject pictures included <span class="italic">Gil Blas Dismissed with Contempt by the Archbishop of Granada</span> (exh. British Institution, 1816; ex Sothebys, 13 July 1988, lot 196); <span class="italic">The Trial of Algernon Sidney</span>; <span class="italic">Cranmer Revoking his Recantation at Oxford</span> (exh. RA, 1835; ex Sothebys, New York, 1981); <span class="italic">Poor Relations</span>; and <span class="italic">The Reconciliation</span>, all of which were well engraved. He also produced many graceful and domestic designs for <span class="italic">The Keepsake</span> and other annuals. For Nayler's <span class="italic">Coronation of &hellip; George IV</span> he drew in watercolours a series of costume portraits (V&amp;A); these record details of elaborate ceremonial costume and are richly coloured, elegant, and highly finished. He also made a series of historical drawings in watercolours entitled &#145;The Field of the Cloth of Gold: an interview between Henry VIII and Francis I&#146;. Stephanoff having failed to find a publisher, the series was sold and was eventually acquired by the British Museum. At the competition to design frescoes for Westminster Hall, in 1843, Stephanoff won a prize of &pound;100 for a scene from Milton's <span class="italic">Comus</span> (exh. RA, 1844). His royal portraits include <span class="italic">George IV while Regent</span> (ex Phillips, 3 June 1986, lot 58) and <span class="italic">Queen Victoria when Princess, at Archery Practice in the Grounds of Windsor Castle</span> (ex Bonhams, 23 November 1983, lot 169).<br>
<br>Added to the lasting effects of a fall on his head when a child, the sudden death of his wife, Selina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Roland, whom he had married on 2 August 1828 at St Alfege, Greenwich, and that of his young son seriously affected Stephanoff's health. In 1850 he moved to Bristol to live with his brother; he gave up painting many years before his death, which occurred on 15 May 1860 at his home, Hanham Lodge, Hanham, Gloucestershire. He was reputed to have been a man of learning and an excellent musician. Examples of his work are also to be found in Exeter Museum and the Castle Museum, Nottingham.<br>
<br>Both Philip Francis and James Stephanoff executed portraits of their contemporaries. However, it is their interest in historical subjects and their recording of elaborate historicized costumes, architectural interiors, and antiquities that make their work of interest to historians of the period. They gave visual expression to intense contemporary interest in antiquarian and historical subjects brought about by the arrival in Britain of the Elgin marbles, by the novels of Sir Walter Scott and his arrangements for the visit of George IV to Edinburgh in 1822, and by George IV's attempt in his coronation to rival that of Napoleon when he was crowned emperor. Their richly coloured work illustrates a romantic view of history that found its fullest expression during the Regency period.<br>
