<span class="headword">Kaye, Sir  Cecil</span>  (1868&#150;1935), <span class="occ">intelligence officer in India</span>, was born on 27 May 1868, at Rosevale, Madron, near Penzance, Cornwall, the son of William Kaye, an officer of the Bengal civil service, and his wife, Jane Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Beckett. He entered Winchester School in March 1881. In March 1889 he joined the 2nd battalion, the Derbyshire regiment, as an officer. In 1892 he transferred to the Indian army and saw active service in the fierce campaigns of 1897 to 1898 against the tribes of the north-west frontier. He was awarded a medal with clasp for his services. From 1900 to 1901 he was a member of the British contingent of the international expeditionary force sent to suppress the Boxer uprising in northern China. At Tientsin he met Margaret Sarah, the daughter of the Revd T. Bryson, of the London Missionary Society; they married in 1905, and had one son and two daughters. In 1908 Kaye was appointed to the general staff at Indian army headquarters, Simla, where he served as deputy adjutant to the quartermaster-general in the intelligence branch.<br>
<br>Upon the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 Kaye was appointed deputy chief censor, India. In this capacity he worked closely with the government of India's political intelligence office, the department of criminal intelligence (DCI), which was then under the distinguished leadership of Sir Charles Cleveland. Kaye made a reputation in India for his ability to cipher and decipher secret messages. At the end of the war he visited London, where he studied the home government's facilities for signals intelligence; the experience made him conscious, as he admitted to close friends, that he was only a beginner in the field. Kaye was made CSI in 1917 and CBE in 1919.<br>
<br>In 1919 Kaye was seeking retirement from the Indian army when, to his surprise, he was offered the directorship of the department of central intelligence (as the DCI was named after March 1918), following Cleveland's resignation. The government of India had initially offered the post to David Petrie of the Indian police, who was too exhausted to take it. On accepting, Kaye was placed on special duty under the home department on 29 September 1919. His appointment was initially temporary, but on 7 May 1920 he was confirmed in this office. Though he never acquired Cleveland's high reputation, Kaye was an efficient head of intelligence and was popular with his colleagues. He played a significant role in shaping the government of India's restrained response to Russian Bolshevism. As early as February 1923 he wrote that there were few Bolshevik agents in India of whom the DCI did not know. All the available evidence indicates that his conclusion was accurate.<br>
<br>In 1924 Kaye retired as director of central intelligence and was knighted for his work. He was succeeded by David Petrie. At the beginning of 1925 he began work on <span class="italic">Communism in India</span>, which appeared the following year as a secret publication of the government of India. In this volume he summarized the conclusions of his department about its work against the Bolsheviks and their Indian agents for the period 1919 to 1924. He retired from the army in 1925 and, after a short period in England, took service as a minister of the small Indian princely state of Tonk. On retiring from service there, he settled at Srinagar in the foothills of the Himalayas. He wrote weekly letters to the journal <span class="italic">Near East and India</span>. Kaye and his wife continued to be popular figures in the social life of the British government at its twin centres of New Delhi and Simla. On 5 March 1935, a few days after his daughter's wedding, he died of a heart attack at New Delhi. At his request the funeral took place at Sanawar in the Simla hills. An obituarist noted his &#145;peculiar faculty of putting his ear to the ground and ascertaining the trend of opinion and movements, whether open or subterranean&#146;, going on to observe that his &#145;small neat handwriting was an index of his precision&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 6 March 1935). His daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/93136/', "Mary Margaret (Mollie) Kaye (1908&#150;2004)")</script> gained repute as a popular novelist and wrote an autobiography, <span class="italic">The Sun in the Morning</span> (1990), which covers the period of her father's active career.<br>
