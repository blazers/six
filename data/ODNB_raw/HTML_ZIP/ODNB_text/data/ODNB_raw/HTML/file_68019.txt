<span class="headword">Arundell,  Dorothy</span>  (1559/60&#150;1613), <span class="occ">author and Benedictine nun</span>, was the daughter of Sir John Arundell (1527&times;30&#150;1590) [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41331/', "Arundell family")</script>] of Lanherne, Cornwall, and Lady Anna Stourton, daughter of the earl of Derby. The Arundells were the chief mainstay of Catholicism during Elizabeth I's reign, providing shelter and other services for priests and local recusants. Both of Dorothy's parents were active recusants. Her father was imprisoned several times, accused of sympathy with Spain in the 1570s, of receiving priests in 1584 and 1585, and held again during the danger of Spanish invasion in 1587. Dorothy's home environment and education were therefore intensely and actively Catholic, although her father maintained a strict loyalty to the English crown. The family tradition of strong spirituality and adherence to Catholicism may be gauged from the wording of her uncle Edward Arundell's will of 1587. He bequeathed Dorothy, &#145;my rope of pearl that was sometime her grandame's my mother, and a little diamond ring that was also hers &hellip; and I beseech God to make her a right follower of that good grandame's life&#146;, in other words, a staunch Catholic.<br>
<br>The priest John Cornelius, whose early education had been funded by the Arundells, returned to England in 1583 and remained the family priest for eleven years, although he also engaged in duties elsewhere in the country. He formed a close spiritual alliance with Dorothy, inspiring her to become a nun. Sir John Arundell died in 1590, and his widow moved with her daughters and Father Cornelius to Chideock Castle in Dorset, fostering a small Catholic community in the seclusion of her own property. The priest's presence was betrayed, and all family members were examined. Dorothy claimed that she alone had hidden him. Cornelius was executed in 1594. Dorothy later wrote an account of his life, <span class="italic">Life of Father Cornelius the Martyr</span> (once in the archives at the Vatican, but now listed as missing). She describes rays of light &#145;glimmering&#146; and surrounding his head when offering a mass, when accused, and when beheaded  (Foley, 3.445). She gives testimony to their close spiritual relationship. When he saw her the night before he died, he said: &#145;I will pray our Lord Jesus will make you a religious [a nun] full of years and merits and heavenly favours, so that we may again with joy meet in heaven&#146;  (ibid., 3.468), and in a letter he wrote that same night: &#145;we shall see one another in heaven if you keep inviolable the word you have given first to God and then to St Bridget&#146;  (ibid., 3.469&#150;70).<br>
<br>Arundell had intended, under Cornelius's direction, to enter the order of St Bridget, and now left for Europe in 1597. According to family history Cornelius appeared to her, while praying in Brussels, and suggested she join the new Benedictine convent being established in Brussels, the abbey of the Glorious Assumption of Our Lady. However, chronicles of her order record that she received &#145;some extraordinary special favour&#146; from God while praying in St Saviour's at Rome on 9 November 1597, an anniversary she always afterwards celebrated &#145;with special devotion&#146;  (Foley, 3.437&#150;8), which suggests that the family story is apocryphal. The financial and personal support of both Dorothy and her sister Gertrude in setting up the convent were crucial, and it grew quickly in its first decades, attracting many daughters of renowned English Catholic families.<br>
<br>Arundell entered the convent on 11 July 1598, was invested in the holy habit on 21 November 1599, and professed as a nun, along with her sister, on 21 November 1600, aged forty. Both the infanta and the pope's nuncio attended, and the infanta led Dorothy into the church. The nuns engaged in contemplation, prayer, and the day-to-day running of an enclosed community. Dorothy Arundell may have completed, or edited her manuscript of the <span class="italic">Life of Father Cornelius</span> during this time; she died in 1613.<br>
