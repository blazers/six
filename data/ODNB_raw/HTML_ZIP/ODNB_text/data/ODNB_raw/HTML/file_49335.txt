<span class="headword">Lysaght,  John</span>  (1832&#150;1895), <span class="occ">manufacturer of sheet iron</span>, was born in the parish of Mallow, co. Cork, Ireland, in March 1832, one of several children of William Lysaght, farmer, and his wife, Frances Atkins. After receiving his early education in Ireland, in his late teens he was sent to Birmingham and Bristol where he trained in civil engineering and, perhaps more crucially, established a friendship with Robert Clarke, whose father had a number of business interests. One of these, in Bristol, specialized in &#145;zincing&#146; iron buckets and, on his father's death in 1857, Clarke made a present of it to Lysaght. Not long after, in 1858, the latter married Ellen Moss (<i>d</i>. 1882). They had at least two children.<br>
<br>Over the succeeding decades, the business expanded substantially. By 1860 galvanized and corrugated sheet iron were being produced, alongside a widening range of galvanized products destined mainly for the agricultural industry. In 1869 the business was moved across Bristol to St Vincent's where, in contrast to the six men and a boy employed in 1857, 400 men were employed in 1878. John had also started, in 1876, a constructional department for the production of structural ironwork at nearby Netham.<br>
<br>Expansion created openings within the business for several of Lysaght's relatives; these included his eldest surviving son, Frederick Percy, and nephew, Sydney Royse Lysaght, who on his death became respectively chairman and managing director of John Lysaght Ltd. Sydney's brother, <a name="cosubject_49335"></a><span class="headword">William Royse Lysaght</span>  (1858&#150;1945), <span class="occ">steel manufacturer</span>, also played a prominent part in the company's development. Born on 23 July 1858, one of several children of Thomas Royse Lysaght, John's elder brother, and Emily Moss (sister of Ellen), in 1874 William Royse was sent by John to the Gospel Oak Company's works at Tipton, Staffordshire, to learn the business of producing sheet iron. When, in 1878, Lysaght, in order to provide a regular supply of puddled iron, acquired the Swan Garden ironworks at Wolverhampton, William Royse was brought from Gospel Oak to run the plant.<br>
<br>John Lysaght's business interests were incorporated in 1880 under the title John Lysaght Ltd, with a registered nominal capital of &pound;162,000. Despite this, however, Lysaght remained clearly in charge of the company's development, and it is recorded that he had a strong aversion to committees. He also did not approve of the contract labour system which operated in the west midlands, a factor which undoubtedly contributed to several conflicts with the labour force there. At Bristol, however, where labour organization was quite different, Lysaght operated a humanitarian system which, in the 1880s, included the provision of a factory canteen, a large meeting hall and recreation centre, a well-stocked library, and a sick and medical club for the workforce.<br>
<br>Growth during the 1880s, based largely on exports, especially to Australia (in 1885, 90 per cent of the firm's output was exported, with the bulk, around 70 per cent, going to Australia), led to the purchase of other works. When the Osier Bed ironworks was acquired in 1885, William Royse also became responsible for its management. By the early 1890s, however, it was clear that Staffordshire was doomed as a sheet-producing region, so Lysaght, together with William Royse, planned the development of a new sheet-rolling complex on a coastal site at Newport, south Wales. The Orb Works, as the complex was called reflecting the &#145;Orb&#146; brand name which Lysaght had adopted for his products in 1857, commenced production in 1897, but he did not live to see it. He died on 1 October 1895, from a neck tumour, at his home at Springford Stoke Bishop, Gloucestershire. At that time his business employed nearly 3000 workers in Bristol and Wolverhampton. A Conservative in his political sympathies, Lysaght had not been particularly attracted to public life, though he had been a magistrate in Bristol and its high sheriff in 1882.<br>
<br>In 1901, having overseen the movement of sheet production from Wolverhampton to south Wales, William Royse Lysaght took over management of the Orb Works which, by 1913, alone employed 3000 workers. He was subsequently responsible for the decision to build the Normanby Park Steelworks at Scunthorpe, which was designed to supply the Orb Works with steel. The experience gained by William Royse and his brother Sydney from the development of the Orb and Normanby works played an invaluable role in subsequent developments in Australia. Following the interruption of supplies from Britain during the First World War, the company decided to establish a production plant at Newport, New South Wales. This plant, which came into production in April 1921, was to help make Lysaght's Galvanised Iron Proprietary Ltd one of the largest steel producers in Australia. Before completion of this project, the Lysaght business interests were sold to H. Seymour Berry and, in 1920, amalgamated with those of Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds Ltd.<br>
<br>William Royse Lysaght married Effie Elizabeth Stavern Gladstone in 1890; they had three children. A member of the Iron and Steel Institute since 1888, William Royse was elected to its council in 1915 and became a vice-president in 1924 and its president in 1933&#150;5. His role as spelter adviser to the Ministry of Munitions during the First World War led to his appointment as CBE in 1918. He was also a deputy lieutenant and justice of the peace for Monmouthshire, and the county's high sheriff in 1915. He died on 27 April 1945 at his home in Castleford, Tidenham, near Chepstow, Monmouthshire.<br>
