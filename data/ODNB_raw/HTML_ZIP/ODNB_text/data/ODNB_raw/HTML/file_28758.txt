<span class="headword">Warner,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1581, <em>d.</em> 1666), <span class="occ">bishop of Rochester</span>, was baptized on 17 September 1581 at St Clement Danes, London, the son of Harman Warner, a merchant tailor. He matriculated from Magdalen Hall, Oxford, on 13 October 1598, was a demy at Magdalen College from 1599, graduated BA on 13 December 1602, and proceeded MA on 12 June 1605. Already &#145;esteemed a witty man, a good logician and philosopher&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.731), Warner was elected perpetual fellow of Magdalen in 1604 but resigned in 1610, perhaps because of the &pound;16,000 he was bequeathed by his godmother or the wealth inherited from his father. In 1613 he proceeded BD and was licensed to preach, and in 1616 he became DD. His first appointments came from Archbishop George Abbot: the rectory of St Michael's, Crooked Lane, London, in 1614, and the first prebend in the chapter of Canterbury in 1616. He resigned the former when he was instituted rector of Bishopsbourne with Barham, Kent, in 1619, but was allowed to retain the latter when Abbot appointed him rector of St Dionis Backchurch, London, in 1625. He also served as proctor for Canterbury diocese in the early 1620s.<br>
<br>After 1625 Warner may have been detaching himself from Abbot's influence, for he is said to have incurred the wrath of parliament for a sermon, highly critical of its opposition to royal policies, that he preached during Easter week 1626 or 1627 before Charles I at Whitehall on the text <span class="roman">Matthew</span> 11: 38 (&#145;This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and seize on his inheritance&#146;). He escaped punishment, but not before securing a royal pardon for any offence given. He became an active Laudian in London in the 1630s, without ever penetrating the inner circle of Caroline ecclesiastical power. In 1633 he was made dean of Lichfield; as a royal chaplain he accompanied Charles I to Scotland for his coronation in Edinburgh; and in 1635 he became rector of Hollingbourne with Hucking, Kent. He may have been the John Warner who on 4 May 1634 at St Michael at Plea, Norwich, married Bridget Bloye: it is certainly possible that his wife's name was Bridget, and becoming through inheritance and investment a rich man, Warner acquired land in Norfolk (where he bought Walsingham Abbey) as well as in Lincolnshire. Perhaps because of his personal wealth, in 1637, at the relatively advanced age of fifty-six or fifty-seven, he was nominated to the poorly endowed bishopric of Rochester. Having been forced to resign his deanery and other benefices, in 1638 he became rector of Bromley, Kent, which was often appropriated to that bishopric; here, although personally frugal, he is said to have been very hospitable. As bishop, Warner acted to enforce the railing of the communion table at the east end of the church; he was also the donor of the magnificent font erected in Canterbury Cathedral in 1639.<br>
<br>In March 1640 Warner preached in Rochester Cathedral another sermon against Charles's opponents, on <span class="roman">Psalm</span> 74: 23 (&#145;Forget not the voice of thy enemies&#146;), which was later denounced as self-serving in <span class="italic">The Scots Scouts Discoveries</span> (1642). He also gave &pound;1500 to swell the royal coffers in the campaign against the Scots. He kept a brief diary during the Short Parliament of 1640, supported the decision to permit convocation to continue sitting after its dissolution, and played a part in drafting the new set of canons, which he subscribed. In September 1640 he was one of only two bishops who attended the great council of peers at York, and on 14 May 1641 he signed the protestation against threatened changes to the constitution of church and state. He was one of the thirteen bishops impeached on 4 August 1641 for passing the canons of 1640 and granting the king a benevolence, but was chosen by joint consent of the accused to organize their defence. His stubborn defence of the legality of their actions and of the canons themselves, together with pressure of other business in parliament, contributed to the impeachment's being dropped. On 13 February 1642 &#145;dying episcopacy gave its last groan in the House of Lords&#146;  (Fuller, 6.237) when Warner and two other bishops defended the right of bishops to sit in the upper house.<br>
<br>In 1643 all Warner's lands and goods were sequestered, his books seized, and debts owed him were cancelled. Writing to Gilbert Sheldon in 1660, he recalled that he was also regularly harassed by parliamentarian forces, had to escape to Oxford in disguise, and then moved further west, living on the Welsh border for three years; he spent some time with his wife's relatives in Bromfield, Shropshire. By the late 1640s he was back in Kent, and was consulted by Henry Hammond about the legality of the toleration then being forced on the king; Warner clearly had reservations. At the king's command he also published <span class="italic">Church-Lands Not to be Sold</span>&#151;a long pamphlet painstakingly rebutting parliament's case for the right to sell episcopal and capitular lands. Wood knew of an edition in 1646, but the only extant copies have &#145;1648&#146; on the title-page, amended on Thomason's copy to October 1647. Two years later Warner published <span class="italic">The Devilish Conspiracy</span>&#151;a sermon on <span class="roman">Luke</span> 18: 31&#150;3 (foretelling Christ's death) which Warner delivered on 4 February 1649, just days after Charles I's execution. In it he used the Jews' &#145;hellish treason, heathenish condemnation, and damnable murder&#146; of Jesus Christ, their king  (title-page), as the basis for a detailed comparison of the trials and executions of Christ and Charles.<br>
<br>Warner had already decided to pay fines of about &pound;5000 to have the sequestration on his personal property discharged, and was finally forced out of Bromley Palace on Christmas eve 1648. In the 1650s he lived quietly, but read prayer book services twice daily, preached weekly, celebrated communion monthly, and confirmed the children of the supporters of the old church. In addition he kept in contact with other episcopalians, giving (he later claimed) up to &pound;600 a year to sequestered clergy and their widows. Jeremy Taylor dedicated two books to him, but Warner wrote to Taylor criticizing his account of original sin in the second, <span class="italic">Unum necessarium</span>. Taylor printed this and responded to it in <span class="italic">An Answer to a Letter Written by the R. R. the Lord Bishop of Rochester</span> (1656). Although extensive sermon notes and many of Warner's other papers, including his notes on political matters in the 1640s and some of his financial records, survive (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng th.b.4&#150;8 and Norfolk RO, LEEW), the only publications correctly associated with Warner (apart from those cited above) are the three sets of visitation articles for Rochester diocese published in 1638, 1662, and 1666. However, he is said to have been generous in helping others prepare works for the press, such as William Somner's <span class="italic">Dictionarum Saxonico-Latino-Anglicum</span> (1659) and Matthew Poole's <span class="italic">Synopsis criticorum</span> (1669&#150;76).<br>
<br>Warner appears to have played little part in &#145;the business of the Church&#146;&#151;the campaign to ensure the continuity of the episcopal succession&#151;and at the Restoration, although he clearly expected promotion to a more important or richer see, and was at one stage allocated Norwich, he was passed over and soon felt &#145;utterly forgotten&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 49, fol. 23<i>r</i>). He was one of four surviving bishops, dressed in episcopal habits, to greet Charles II publicly on his return to London on 29 May 1660, and one of the five survivors who consecrated five new bishops in Westminster Abbey on 28 October, and was placed on the list of court preachers in February 1661. In November he took his seat again in the House of Lords, but thereafter his public role was increasingly confined to his diocese. He addressed his clergy in Rochester Cathedral on 14 October 1662, telling them that he still had &#145;work enough to set all in order that is left undone or done amiss&#146;  (J. Lee-Warner, 47). Having drawn up his will in September 1666, on 21 or 22 October he died; he was buried in Merton's chapel in Rochester Cathedral, where a fine monument by Joseph Marshall was raised to him.<br>
<br>Warner died childless and his considerable estates descended to his sister's son John Lee, archdeacon of Rochester, who assumed the additional name of Warner as the bishop had stipulated in his will, proved on 7 February 1667. Warner was a great philanthropist, and a member of his family estimated that he gave the equivalent of over &pound;40,000 to good causes during his lifetime and in his will. For example, in addition to the gifts already mentioned, Warner claimed to have given over &pound;1000 to young scholars at Magdalen, a further &pound;1000 to the repair of St Paul's, and over &pound;2500 to redeem Christians held captive in north Africa in the 1660s. The font in Canterbury Cathedral cost him &pound;3000, including repairs undertaken in 1660, and he bought books for the libraries of the college and cathedrals with which he had been associated; &pound;2000 went to buy in impropriations to raise the value of poor vicarages in Rochester diocese, &pound;8500 to build Bromley College, Kent, to house twenty impoverished widows of clergymen, plus &pound;450 a year for its support, and &pound;80 a year in perpetuity to Balliol College, Oxford, for scholarships to support four young Scottish ordinands each year. Warner's learning and wealth had been reflected in his book-collecting over several decades. In 1685 a collection of books said to consist &#145;principally&#146; of Warner's library was auctioned: the accompanying catalogue, <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Warneriana</span>, listed well over 2400 titles, over half of which were &#145;valuable and scarce books in divinity&#146;&#151;editions of the fathers and councils, church histories, and biblical commentaries (many in Greek and Latin), and many treatises and sermons in English&#151;together with works on history, philology, and mathematics. His manuscript sermons and political papers, together with this library, confirm what one near-contemporary affirmed, that he was &#145;a good scholar, an able linguist, a deep divine, and one well read in the Fathers&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 4224, fol. 76<i>r</i>).<br>
