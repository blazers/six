<span class="headword">Bowes,  Mary Eleanor</span>, countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne  (1749&#150;1800), <span class="occ">heiress and victim of kidnapping</span>, was born on 24 February 1749, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47988/', "George Bowes MP (1701&#150;1760)")</script>, of Streatlam Castle and Gibside, co. Durham, and his second wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1781), heir of Edward Gilbert, of St Paul's Walden in Hertfordshire. Her father, a landowner and successful businessman, brought her up at Gibside House, near Rowlands Gill, where she was educated. He had never forgotten his long-dead first wife, Eleanor Verney, whom he had married when she was only fourteen. She had been a prodigy of learning and he was determined that his daughter should emulate her. Fortunately, Mary Eleanor was intelligent. By her own account she could read fluently at the age of four, had a gift for languages, and took a great interest in botany.<br>
<br>Mary Eleanor's father died when she was eleven, leaving her his vast wealth, whereupon her mother promptly took a house in London, first at no. 13 and then at 40 Grosvenor Square. Small and shapely, with dark brown hair, a rather large nose, and a determined chin, Mary Eleanor was soon the centre of attraction for impoverished aristocrats and unscrupulous fortune hunters. Nominally chaperoned by her easy-going aunt, Jane Bowes, she enjoyed a series of flirtations until, at the age of sixteen, she fell in love with &#145;the beautiful Lord Strathmore&#146;, as contemporaries called him  (Arnold, 23). <a name="cosubject_17281"></a><span class="headword">John Lyon</span>, ninth earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne  (1737&#150;1776), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was born on 17 July 1737, the son of Thomas Lyon, eighth earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne (<i>bap</i>. 1704, <i>d</i>. 1753), and Jean Nicholson (1713&#150;1778). Strathmore was an honest, good-natured, and uncomplicated man, who played no role in public life apart from being one of Scotland's representative peers. It took eighteen months to negotiate the marriage contract, during which time Mary Eleanor realized that he and she had nothing in common. He had no interest in literary or intellectual matters, and she certainly did not want to settle down to a quiet life on his Scottish estates. Too proud to admit her mistake, she married him in St George's, Hanover Square, London, on 26 February 1767, two days after her eighteenth birthday.<br>
<br>By the time Mary Eleanor was twenty-four she had three sons and two daughters, and was finding domestic life unbearably dull. Lord Strathmore had contracted tuberculosis and spent an increasing amount of time away from home, in search of a cure. To amuse herself, Mary Eleanor wrote a poetical play in five acts, entitled <span class="italic">The Siege of Jerusalem</span>, full of high drama and unrequited love. After the excitement of its publication in 1769, she embarked on a series of affairs. Unscrupulous adventurers were all too ready to divert a bored, wealthy wife, and in 1774 George Grey insinuated himself into her affections, plying her with poems of his own composition. His origins were obscure, but he claimed to have made a fortune in India. They began to meet secretly, and in February 1776 they became lovers. A few weeks later, on 7 March 1776, Lord Strathmore died at sea, <i>en route</i> to Lisbon, leaving his wife a farewell letter criticizing her &#145;extreme rage for literary fame&#146; and her propensity for making ill-natured remarks &#145;for the sake of sporting a <i>bon mot</i>&#146;  (Arnold, 41).<br>
<br>Somewhat sobered, Mary Eleanor revived her botanical interests. She purchased Stanley House in Chelsea, built hothouses, and commissioned William Paterson the botanist to collect plants for her in southern Africa. When people enquired about her personal life, she spoke vaguely of marrying Grey, and indeed became engaged to him. However, twice that year when she found that she was expecting his child she had the pregnancies terminated, and in the late autumn she fell in love with Andrew Robinson Stoney (1747&#150;1810), a widowed lieutenant on half pay in the 30th regiment. Undeterred by tales of his ill-treatment of his wealthy first wife, and by the fact that she was once more expecting Grey's child, Mary Eleanor married Stoney on 17 January 1777, in St James's, Piccadilly, London. Mary, her daughter with Grey, was born that summer.<br>
<br>Mary Eleanor and Stoney, now known as Bowes, later had a son, William, but by then her married life was miserable. A few days after their marriage, Bowes discovered that she had signed an antenuptial trust preventing him from having any control over her fortune. Furious, he forced her to revoke the deed and began to abuse her. The servants often saw her bruised and bleeding. In February 1785 she managed to escape, finding refuge in a lodging-house in Holborn under the name of Mrs Jefferies. She raised an action for divorce on the grounds of her husband's ill-treatment and adultery, but on 10 November 1786 he had her abducted. She was carried off to the north of England and held in wretched conditions until she was finally rescued by several local men near Darlington.<br>
<br>Bowes and his accomplices were sentenced to three years in prison and fined &pound;300. Mary Eleanor regained control of her estates, was granted a decree of divorce on 2 March 1789, and spent the rest of her life quietly, in Fludyer Street, London, and then at Purbrook Park, near Cosham, Hampshire. She died at Christchurch, Hampshire, on 28 April 1800, and was buried in her magnificent first wedding dress in the south cross of Westminster Abbey, London, on 10 May. Her story reads like a historical novel, and indeed Thackeray is said to have based Barry Lyndon on Bowes, but the problems caused by her frustrated intelligence and her great wealth were all too real.<br>
