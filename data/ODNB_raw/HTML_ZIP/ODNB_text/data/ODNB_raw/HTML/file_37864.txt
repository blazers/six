<span class="headword">Prince,  Henry James</span>  (1811&#150;1899), <span class="occ">founder of the Agapemonites</span>, was the youngest son of Thomas Prince (1745&#150;1816), a West Indian plantation owner, formerly of Liverpool, and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stevens (1775&#150;1847). Henry was born on 13 January 1811 at 5 Widcombe Crescent, Bath, Somerset, and was brought up by his widowed mother and her elderly Roman Catholic lodger, Martha Freeman, the daughter of a business associate of Henry's father. He was educated at a school in Corsham. In September 1827 he was articled to John Nicholls, an apothecary in Wells, moving to London in 1831 to study at Guy's Hospital and the Webb Street medical school. Having qualified on 16 February 1832, he was appointed in May as medical officer to the General Hospital in Bath, but after an abdominal operation in London in April 1835 he resigned. A year earlier he had experienced an evangelical conversion, and he was now encouraged to consider ordination when, as a convalescent, he visited his half-brother John Prince of Shincliffe Hall, co. Durham. With this object he entered St David's College, Lampeter, in March 1836. Further ill health caused him to miss a term in September 1837. Devout and earnest by temperament, he gathered about him a small group of Welsh students, known as the Lampeter Brethren, who fasted, prayed, and studied with him. On 10 July 1838 he married his mother's lodger, Martha Freeman (<i>d</i>. 1842), who was considerably older than him. In 1839 he completed the course at Lampeter and was ordained.<br>
<br>In June 1840 Prince became curate of Charlinch, near Bridgwater, Somerset, where his initially absent rector, Samuel Starky, soon joined in the popular enthusiasm for his ministry, which Prince later described in <span class="italic">The Charlinch Revival</span> (1842). Shocked by his unconventional methods, the bishop of Bath and Wells revoked Prince's licence to preach on 4 May 1842. There was further adverse comment when, only months after his wife's death in April 1842, Prince married Starky's sister Julia on 16 September. Meanwhile he engaged in open-air preaching near Charlinch before taking up a temporary curacy at Stoke by Clare, Suffolk, but in November the parochial discord sown by Prince led the bishop of Ely also to prohibit him from preaching.<br>
<br>Adopting typically messianic language Prince proclaimed the imminent &#145;Day of the Lord&#146;. He referred to himself as Elijah, and to Starky and himself as the &#145;two witnesses&#146; of <span class="roman">Revelation</span> 11, also privately claiming that he was the incarnation of the Holy Ghost. In 1843 he preached in Adullam Chapel in Brighton, but when in 1844 some former colleagues denounced him as heterodox, Prince joined Starky in Weymouth, gathering there an entourage of devoted followers. Meanwhile, near Bridgwater, some of his admirers, known as Princites, were engaged in energetic revivalism, but in early 1846 their leader decided that the days of evangelism were over and the elect should wait in isolation for the imminent return of Christ. In December 1846 the community moved to more spacious accommodation in a purpose-built settlement in Spaxton, barely a mile from Charlinch. The purchase of this Agapemone, or &#145;abode of love&#146;, was made possible when his followers sold their lands, allowing Prince (known in the community as Beloved) to dispose of the proceeds. Particularly controversial was the way in which he had persuaded three wealthy sisters to marry three of his clerical followers.<br>
<br>In 1856 Prince announced that he was the chosen means of reconciling God's spirit with the sinful flesh of humanity. In a ceremony called the Great Manifestation, Prince was &#145;spiritually married&#146; to a young member of the community, Anne Willet (or Zo&euml;) Paterson. He sought to justify his action in one of his characteristically tortuous books, <span class="italic">The Little Book Open</span> (1856), but several of his scandalized followers abandoned him when Paterson gave birth to a daughter, Eve, whose father was almost certainly Prince.<br>
<br>The wealthier members of the community lived in some comfort, but rumours of general profligacy, as opposed to Prince's special privileges, were unfounded. In 1860 Prince was publicly discredited in the case of <i>Nottidge v. Prince</i>, heard in chancery, when the relatives of a deceased member of the community successfully contested her will, revealing how Prince had secured control of his followers' assets. The movement survived quietly in Prince's later years, gaining more publicity when its members held a campaign at Clapton, London, in the 1890s. The preacher, approved by Prince, was a lapsed Anglican curate, John Hugh Smyth-Pigott. When Prince died at the Agapemone in Spaxton on 8 January 1899 and was buried in its grounds, Smyth-Pigott was soon recognized as his successor.<br>
