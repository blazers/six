<span class="headword">Weld,  Thomas</span>  (1750&#150;1810), <span class="occ">landowner and benefactor</span>, was born on 24 August 1750 at Lulworth Castle, Dorset, the fourth son of Edward Weld (1705&#150;1761) and Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Vaughan (1713&#150;1754). The Weld family originally came from Cheshire and bought the Lulworth estate, including the castle (built in 1610) from the third earl of Suffolk in 1641. Thomas was educated at the English colleges on the continent run by the Jesuit fathers, first at St Omer (1759&#150;62) and then for the next three years at Bruges. On 27 February 1772 he married Mary (1753&#150;1830), daughter of John Massey Stanley of Hooton Hall, Cheshire. They had fourteen children of whom the eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28987/', "Thomas Weld (1773&#150;1837)")</script>, became a cardinal in the Roman Catholic church.<br>
<br>In 1775 Thomas succeeded his brother Edward (1741&#150;1775) to the family estates. His inheritance made Thomas a wealthy man with five estates including Stonyhurst and Shireburn (both in Lancashire), the latter bequeathed by Elizabeth, heiress of Sir Nicholas Shireburn and wife of William Weld, Thomas's great-grandfather. At Lulworth, Thomas continued the building work started by Edward. He constructed the first free-standing Roman Catholic chapel built since the Reformation. In this chapel in 1790 were consecrated on separate days John Carroll, founder of the Roman Catholic hierarchy in the United States, and bishops John Douglass and William Gibson. In 1789 George III visited Lulworth while staying at Weymouth. He was handsomely entertained and revisited the Weld family five times before 1792.<br>
<br>Thomas Weld's wealth and position made him an important figure in the Roman Catholic struggle for relief of the penal laws. However, despite his earnest support for the campaign, he was also determined to remain aloof from movements of which he disapproved and which he believed undermined the position of the vicars apostolic. So he refused to become a member either of the Catholic committee which preceded the second <span class="roman">Relief Act</span> of 1791 or of the Cisalpine Club which followed it. During the 1790s Weld offered support for continental Roman Catholics who had been displaced by the French Revolution. Particularly close relations were forged between the Franciscan nuns and the Trappists who he helped to establish a monastery in the grounds of Lulworth. A keen sportsman, fond of shooting and hunting, Weld himself followed a strict lifestyle similar to those who benefited from his philanthropy.<br>
<br>In 1794 Weld offered his house and grounds at Stonyhurst, Lancashire, to a group of twelve exiled Jesuits who had been driven from the English college, then based at Li&egrave;ge. Stonyhurst College quickly developed from this new foundation, and Weld had his younger sons educated at the school. In 1802 he gave a former mill owner's house on the estate to the college, first as a noviciate, and soon after as a preparatory school. Weld died on 1 August 1810 at Stonyhurst, one day after suffering a stroke while attending the school's feast day. He was buried at Lulworth Chapel.<br>
