<span class="headword">Nelson family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1780&#150;1958), <span class="occ">publishers and printers</span>, entered the book trade in the early nineteenth century with the bookselling activities of Thomas Neilson or Nelson, son of a Stirlingshire farmer. He founded the bookselling, printing, and publishing firm in Edinburgh, which became Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons in 1858 and remained in family hands until 1962.<h2>
<a name="ThomasNelsonseniorandthelaunchofadynasty"></a>Thomas Nelson senior and the launch of a dynasty</h2>
<a name="cosubject_39032"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Nelson</span>  (1780&#150;1861)<span class="occ"></span> was born Thomas Neilson in the village of Throsk near Stirling in Scotland, the son of William Neilson, a farmer, and his wife, Lilias Gibson. He was baptized on 1 October 1780 at St Ninian's, Stirling, and was brought up with the strict religious outlook of the Reformed Presbyterian church (covenanters). He became briefly a teacher at sixteen, and also worked in a local distillery, but eventually left the family farm for London to undertake an apprenticeship with a bookseller at 35 Paternoster Row, abandoning an opportunity to go to the West Indies. After two years in London he returned to Edinburgh in 1798, to set up a business as a secondhand bookseller trading from a small half-timbered shop with its booth opening onto the street at the head of the West Bow, near St Giles's Cathedral.<br>
<br>At some point Nelson realized the existence of a market for cheap editions of standard, non-copyright works which he initially attempted to satisfy by publishing in monthly parts well-known religious texts such as <span class="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</span> and <span class="italic">Scots Worthies</span>, then by issuing what became the Nelson hallmark, reprints of classics such as <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span>, <span class="italic">The Vicar of Wakefield</span>, and Goldsmith's <span class="italic">Essays</span>. From these beginnings the emphasis was on price&#151;he produced inexpensive books accessible to a new reading public of the skilled working classes. Nelson employed the still uncommon process of stereotyping to reduce production costs over a large print run. To circumvent hostility towards reduced profit margins from the book trade, he found alternative outlets, such as direct sales at fairs and markets, and vacant shops rented temporarily in the smaller towns and burghs of Scotland. Thus Nelson established the publishing &#145;holy trinity&#146; of wide distribution, mass production, and low costs. The first authenticated year of Nelson's operation as a publisher was 1818 when, after restricted growth due to lack of capital, the firm opened a bank account and the company name, with that of its founder, changed from Neilson to Nelson, to accommodate frequent misspelling. Thomas made a joke of it: &#145;Like the naval hero of the same name, I have had to sacrifice an &#147;i&#148; in a good cause&#146;  (Ramsay, 4).<br>
<br>On 15 March 1814 Thomas Nelson married Margaret Sibbald Black of Kinghorn, Fife. They had a large family. Three of the five sons later entered the business: <a href="#cosubject_19889">William (1816&#150;1887) [<i>see below</i>]</a>, <a href="#cosubject_19886">Thomas (1822&#150;1892) [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and Peter (<i>d</i>. 1871). Their eldest daughter, Anne, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3608/', "George Brown (1818&#150;1880)")</script>, who was the leader of the Liberal Party in Upper Canada until killed by an assassin. A son of this couple later joined the family firm.<br>
<br>The business continued to expand until in 1829 Nelson took the unprecedented step of employing a &#145;bagman&#146;, James Macdonald, the first publisher's representative, to hawk the firm's wares around Scotland and the north of England. It was not initially a successful experiment, orders coming from only one Aberdeen bookseller. The religious nature of many of Nelson's early publications reflected the strict religious outlook of his family. John A. H. Dempster suggests that the early history of Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons conforms to a common early nineteenth-century model. The founder of the publishing house, actuated by zeal to spread the word of God, commences general, secular publishing as an adjunct to this. Succeeding generations inherit the prosperous business but none, or only a diluted form, of the religious motivation. The religious output decreases in proportion to the whole but often remains a steady income generator on the back list. This categorization perhaps ignores the evangelism of the educator: the urge to spread knowledge through good, cheap books across a wide section of the population, a mission which lay, however implicitly, behind the story of Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons until its last years.<h2>
<a name="WilliamandThomasjuniorthesecondgeneration"></a>William and Thomas junior: the second generation</h2>
<a name="cosubject_19889"></a><span class="headword">William Nelson</span>  (1816&#150;1887)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_19886"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Nelson junior</span>  (1822&#150;1892)<span class="occ"></span> controlled the firm of Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons throughout the second half of the nineteenth century. William Nelson was born in Edinburgh on 13 December 1816 and was educated at the high school, where he won the classical gold medal. In 1835 he abandoned his studies at Edinburgh University to help his ailing father run the business. Thomas Nelson was also born in Edinburgh, on 25 December 1822, and followed his eldest brother through Edinburgh high school, leaving at seventeen to assist William. They gave fresh energy to the expansion of the firm, which still dealt only in reprints. William concentrated on marketing, Thomas on editing and production.<br>
<br>In 1844, at Thomas senior's request, Thomas junior opened a London office at 35 Paternoster Row, the place of his father's apprenticeship. Peter Nelson ran this branch for a time but was never made a partner. A new printing house at Hope Park in Edinburgh was built in 1845, where the complete book manufacturing process was carried out under one roof, with a payroll of over 400 employees. In 1850 Thomas perfected a rotary press, demonstrated at the Great Exhibition in the following year, but because he refused to patent his invention, little fame and no fortune resulted from the many clones which competitors built. A continuous web of paper-fed cylinders holding curved stereotype plates passed the printed paper under a serrated knife for cutting into sheets: a principle on which all newspaper presses were based until well into the twentieth century. Thomas also undertook experiments with coated paper for use with half-tone blocks.<br>
<br>On 24 July 1851 William married at St Cuthbert's Church, Edinburgh, Catherine Inglis (<i>d</i>. 1904), daughter of Robert Inglis of Kirkmay, Fife. They had two sons (neither of whom entered the family business) and four daughters.<br>
<br>In 1854 Thomas&#151;normally the stay-at-home brother&#151;established at William's suggestion a branch of Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons in New York at 42 Bleecker Street, the first branch of a British publishing house in the USA. It later proved a sound investment for reasons not altogether to do with publishing, providing opportunities for investment and for profitable imports during the American Civil War.<br>
<br>In his early days with the firm William reduced stock holdings by rebinding reprints in a more attractive cloth finish, taking to the road himself to sell them, travelling as far as Liverpool, via Carlisle, on his first expedition. The repackaging, coupled with an increased discount, was successful: booksellers who may have earlier despised Nelsons' list now subscribed eagerly. Perhaps also publishing a cheap reprint of a work too popular to ignore, MacKnight on the epistles, blackmailed them into recognizing the upstart firm.<br>
<br>Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons continued to expand and now began publishing stories of adventure and travel for young people, &#145;moral books&#146;, and educational titles generally. The former were especially suitable as Sunday school and church, or indeed weekday school, prizes, featuring elevating and wholesome contents, attractive presentation, and reasonable price. The work of R. M. Ballantyne fitted well into this category. <span class="italic">The Young Fur Traders</span> (1856) was written at the suggestion of William Nelson out of Ballantyne's own experiences with the Hudson's Bay Company, the first of seven major titles including <span class="italic">Coral Island</span> (1858) published by Nelsons. Harriet Beecher Stowe was another moral, humane Nelson author, while illustrators included artists like Landseer and David Scott. Lesser-known figures important in their time were Charlotte Maria Tucker, who used the pseudonym A. L. O. E. (A Lady of England), and Evelyn Everett-Green. The former was, like Ballantyne, possessed of a Christian mission in her writing. She was, also like Ballantyne, extremely prolific: Nelsons advertised forty-seven of her titles, new and reprints, in 1875: by 1894 there were sixty. Copyright was bought outright on acceptance of the manuscript, the author receiving no other payment or royalty from Nelsons.<br>
<br>Ballantyne protested against such exploitation, reputedly calling William &#145;a mean old codger&#146;  (Quayle, 95). This is in contrast with William's personal benevolence towards the indigent, especially towards the dependants of former employees. Ballantyne certainly felt that he was the victim of sharp practice when he set the popularity of works issued by Nelsons against the sums paid for their copyright: &pound;50 for <span class="italic">The Young Fur Traders</span>, &pound;60 for his second novel <span class="italic">Ungava</span> (1857) and for <span class="italic">Coral Island</span>, rising to &pound;75 for <span class="italic">Martin Rattler</span> (1858). When in 1860 Nelsons refused, apparently with a sad lack of commercial foresight, to allow him to retain the copyright in a new work, he took the only sanction open to him and removed future titles to another publisher. Nelsons further refused, in 1865, to allow him to buy back the copyright to his early titles, which continued to be best-sellers, and Ballantyne saw not a penny more for them.<br>
<br>Thomas Nelson senior died on 23 March 1861, after a period of failing health. His sons had taken on all responsibility for the firm over the previous ten years, and the secondhand bookshop had by this time grown into a business giving work to hundreds.<br>
<br>On 30 April 1868 Thomas Nelson junior married Jessie (1846&#150;1919), daughter of James Kemp of Manchester and South America. They had five children: a son, Thomas Graeme, who died aged eighteen months; two other sons, <a href="#cosubject_64904">Thomas Arthur (1877&#150;1917) [<i>see below</i>]</a> and <a href="#cosubject_64903">Ian Theodore (1878&#150;1958) [<i>see below</i>]</a>, who later carried on the family business; and two daughters. Thomas Nelson was politically liberal, and a member of the Free Church of Scotland, but had few or no interests outside his work: his obituary in <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> comments that he had no desire for holidays, and found it impossible to delegate.<br>
<br>William continued to travel widely for both business and leisure, visiting the American offshoot on several occasions, and on one transcontinental tour in 1870 narrowly escaped capture by raiding Sioux. Although not a &#145;public man&#146;, he, like his brother, espoused liberal politics, and was particularly known for his support of the restoration of historic buildings in Edinburgh, including parts of Edinburgh Castle and St Bernard's Well on the Water of Leith.<br>
<br>A fire devastated Hope Park in 1878, causing damage estimated between &pound;100,000 and &pound;200,000, only partly covered by insurance. William Nelson witnessed the destruction: the fire had broken out in the back of the building at about three in the morning, and the whole building was soon in flames. By the time that William arrived at the scene just over an hour later, the roof had already fallen in and the flames, fanned by a strong east wind, carried the fire rapidly throughout the works. &#145;Not a book or sheet of paper was saved&#146;  (Wilson, 173&#150;4).<br>
<br>Within two months Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons were back in operation, albeit on a limited scale, and within two years the production works moved to a new site at Parkside near Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh. The calamity brought the fortuitous benefit of investment in new plant from which a flood of inexpensive reprints, schoolbooks, prize books, and religious books poured&#151;with the corollary of low profit margins. From 1878 to 1881 fiction represented, again, according to John Dempster's calculations, 40 per cent of the books printed but only 10 per cent of the firm's total profit. Furthermore, 17 per cent of the fiction titles produced 53 per cent of the profit. The inescapable conclusion is that most of the fiction published by Nelsons, non-copyright reprints notwithstanding, made very little money.<br>
<br>The <span class="roman">Education Acts</span> after 1870 stimulated tremendous demand for good, inexpensive learning materials, and Nelsons responded with the <span class="roman">Royal Readers</span> series, which sold in vast quantities throughout the British empire and was followed by the <span class="roman">Royal School</span> series. The educational market was monitored through correspondence with educationists, contacts with school boards at home and abroad, and inspecting the products of rivals such as Blackie and Arnold. Between 1878 and 1881 educational books represented 25 per cent of total output but, according to calculations by John Dempster, yielded 88 per cent of the firm's total profit. Nelsons introduced the first school atlases and Thomas is credited with the introduction into these of lines of latitude and longitude, and of the scale in English miles. (Not long before his death he bought a controlling interest in John Bartholomew &amp; Co., the cartographical and geographical specialists.) <span class="italic">The Highroads of History</span> (1907), <span class="italic">The Highroads of Literature</span>, and <span class="italic">The Highroads of Geography</span> (both 1911) remained on the company's back list for over forty years. Nelsons also published periodicals, the most successful being the <span class="italic">Children's Paper</span>, issued from 1855 until 1925. From 1895 the <span class="italic">Practical Teacher</span> appeared under its imprint, carrying, like many other Nelsons periodicals, a high proportion of advertising for Nelsons' publications: possibly they were regarded partly as a promotional medium for the firm.<br>
<br>William died on 10 September 1887 and Thomas on 20 October 1892. Both were millionaires. The obituary of Thomas published in <span class="italic">The Bookseller</span> stresses the high production values of the Nelsons' books: &#145;they were better printed, better illustrated and more tastefully bound than any other books of their class&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Bookseller</span>, 7 Nov 1892).<h2>
<a name="ThomasArthurNelsonandIanTheodoreNelsonforwardtothetwentiethcentury"></a>Thomas Arthur Nelson and Ian Theodore Nelson: forward to the twentieth century</h2>Until Thomas Nelson junior's two sons, Tommy and Ian, could take over the business, the firm was directed under trusteeship by their Canadian cousin George Brown, who later continued as partner with them. John Buchan noted that he revolutionized the financial side of the business, introducing an up-to-date American accounting system.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_64904"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Arthur <span class="st"> [Tommy]</span> Nelson</span>  (1877&#150;1917)<span class="occ"></span> was born in Edinburgh in 1877 and was educated at Edinburgh Academy and University College, Oxford, where he gained a rugby blue. He also played rugby for Scotland. While at Oxford his friends included John Buchan and E. R. Balfour, whose sister Margaret he later married. (They apparently had no children.) Tommy's younger brother <a name="cosubject_64903"></a><span class="headword">Ian Theodore Nelson</span>  (1878&#150;1958)<span class="occ"></span> was born in Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Tommy Nelson continued the family tradition of innovation in mass publishing, becoming managing director in practice if not in title, and initiating a number of popular series. The <span class="roman">New Century Library</span> included titles by Dickens, Thackeray, and Scott, &#145;handy for the pocket or knapsack, and especially suitable for railway reading&#146;. The <span class="roman">Sixpenny Classics</span>, later <span class="roman">Nelsons Classics</span> (from 1903), eventually consisted of over 400 volumes and included works by James, Conrad, and Wells. From 1907 the <span class="roman">Nelson Library</span>, selling at 7<i>d</i>., offered reprints of copyright works in still familiar, at least to denizens of secondhand bookshops, red and gold cloth bindings. The <span class="roman">Shilling Library</span> provided copyright titles of general literature, while several foreign series catered for languages other than English. Credit must be paid to Nelsons as one of the forerunners of Allen Lane's sixpenny <span class="roman">Penguins</span> or the British equivalent of Tauchnitz. Among a limited number of new books was the Nelson biography of Edward VII, on sale in an edition of 120,000 copies within three days of his death.<br>
<br>Late in 1906 Tommy Nelson also brought John Buchan, author, politician, and later as Lord Tweedsmuir governor-general of Canada, his friend from Oxford days, into the firm, where for some years he was largely responsible for editorial policy. Buchan was inspired by the principles that were Nelsons' from its earliest days: to place good books within the means of as many people as possible. He took charge of a weekly published by Nelsons, the <span class="italic">Scottish Review</span>, attempting to slough off its dour, worthy image as a house journal of the United Free Church of Scotland. Brown and the Nelsons envisaged it as the centre of a new Edinburgh-based Enlightenment when they bought the rights. There was a consensus that a periodical covering all matters Scottish&#151;political, literary, and social&#151;was needed. However, despite contributing lengthy items each week, Buchan could not sustain the necessary sales at 1<i>d</i>. a copy to keep it afloat, and it closed at the end of 1908.<br>
<br>In these years the American branch continued to flourish. In 1901 it published the <span class="roman">American Standard Version</span> of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> from a dedicated factory in Brooklyn, and in 1903 the American Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons became a New York corporation wholly owned by the parent British company. It was also innovatory in popular publishing, issuing the <span class="italic">Nelson Encyclopaedia</span> on a loose-leaf principle to subscribers.<br>
<br>In 1907 a new factory was constructed which could produce 200,000 books a week. Reprint series of foreign language works increased, and the name Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons appeared over branches in France and Germany. Business in Canada expanded with a Toronto branch opening in 1914. In <span class="italic">Memory Hold-the-Door</span> (1940) John Buchan wrote of that period: &#145;We were a progressive concern, and in our standardised Edinburgh factories we began the publication of cheap books in many tongues&#146;  (p. 146). The languages included French, German, Magyar, and Spanish, and printing in Russian was under consideration. John Buchan became a director of Nelsons in 1915 when it became a limited company, signing a contract which expired in 1929. The book which brought Buchan lasting popular success, <span class="italic">The Thirty-Nine Steps</span> (1915), is dedicated to Tommy Nelson in memory of a long friendship, and a joint affection for &#145;that elementary type of tale which the Americans call the &#147;dime novel&#148; and which we know as the &#147;shocker&#148;&#151;the romance where the incidents defy the probabilities, and march just inside the borders of the possible&#146;. The need to be doing something (that he was writing <span class="italic">The Thirty-Nine Steps</span> at the time did not count) preoccupied Buchan in the early months of the First World War. He was also anxious that the denial of foreign markets, the loss of manpower, and general exigencies of wartime should not lead to the temporary rundown and long-term decline of Nelsons. He proposed an ongoing history of the war, published in monthly parts (it was initially issued fortnightly) and when Hilaire Belloc declined the invitation to write it, Buchan undertook the challenge himself. Each issue, of about 50,000 words, published from 1915 to 1919, was seized upon by a public eager for clear, authoritative accounts of the war and represents a staggering feat of stamina and consistency. Over the same period another Nelson author, Edward Parrott, produced <span class="italic">The Children's Story of War</span>, also in instalments and also giving a regularity to the business. Both Tommy and Ian served on the western front, while retaining their interest in the family firm.<br>
<br>The take-over of the publishing house of T. C. and E. C. Jack in 1915, strong in children's titles, consolidated the company's future direction. After Tommy's death in action at the battle of Arras on 9 April 1917 (he served in the Lothian and Borders horse, and later in the tank corps), Ian became head of the firm. In 1919 Thomas Nelson junior's original rotary press, which was interred in Germany since its exhibition at a Leipzig trade fair in 1914, was returned intact.<br>
<br>Between the wars Nelsons expanded its educational list. Buchan brought in Sir Henry Newbolt as editorial adviser in this field, establishing new series: <span class="roman">The Teaching of English</span> and <span class="roman">The Teaching of History</span>, and a new range of school readers, <span class="roman">Reading for Action</span>, and <span class="roman">Read and Remember</span>. Buchan's collaboration continued long after his departure in 1929: at that point he did not renew his contract, given increased commitments in his political career. In any case, much of the excitement disappeared from the business on the death of Tommy. When 35 Paternoster Row was destroyed in the blitz, Nelsons shared the fate of many other publishers, but in 1948 the firm celebrated its 150th anniversary as well as release from the restrictions of wartime and after.<br>
<br>Ian Nelson remained head of the firm until his death on 14 April 1958 and was succeeded by his son Ronnie. Nelsons nurtured its overseas textbook markets in the newly established Commonwealth in the same way as it had forged links in the old empire. During the 1960s branches were opened in Australia, Nigeria, and Kenya, but in order to sustain its publications in a global market, Nelsons was absorbed into the Thomson Organization in 1962. Soon afterwards the production plant in Edinburgh was separated from the publishing division, which became permanently based in London. In 1968 the printing division was sold to the Edinburgh company Morrison and Gibb and the Parkside works were eventually demolished to make way for new insurance company buildings. In 1969 the American company was sold to Royal Publishers Incorporated of Nashville, Tennessee, which retained the name Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons. The London firm continued to trade until January 2000, when it merged with Stanley Thornes to become Nelson Thornes, a combined subsidiary of the Dutch company Wolters Kluwer.<br>
