<span class="headword">Griffith,  Llewelyn Wyn</span>  (1890&#150;1977), <span class="occ">writer and broadcaster</span>, was born on 30 August 1890 at 10 Penrhyn View, Llandrillo-yn-Rhos, Colwyn Bay, Caernarvonshire, the eldest son of John Griffith (1863&#150;1933), schoolmaster, and his wife, Dora (1861&#150;1940), daughter of Owen Jones of Tal-y-sarn, Caernarvonshire. His childhood was spent in various places in rural north Wales; he received his secondary education at Blaenau Ffestiniog, Merioneth, where his father taught science at the county school, and at Dolgellau in the same county, where his father became headmaster of the grammar school. The family was Welsh-speaking and Welsh was Griffith's mother tongue, but his education was wholly through the medium of English, and it was in that language that most of his creative writing was done.<br>
<br>Griffith left Wales in 1909 to join the civil service, making his career with the Inland Revenue, of which he was assistant secretary from 1945 until his retirement in 1952; he wrote a history of the civil service, published in 1954, its centenary year. It was as an attempt to recapture and record the Welsh nonconformist tradition as he had known it, and from which he drew sustenance during a long and distinguished career in England, that most of his writing, particularly <span class="italic">Spring of Youth</span> (1935), was undertaken; he returned to this subject in his autobiographical essay in the book <span class="italic">Y llwybrau gynt</span> (ed. Alun Oldfield-Davies, 1971).<br>
<br>Griffith's impulse to write about his own life had its origins in his experiences as a captain with the 15th battalion (London Welsh) of the Royal Welch Fusiliers during the First World War, in which he won the Croix de Guerre. His book <span class="italic">Up to Mametz</span> (1931) is a vivid but reliable account of the conflict which, although it lacks the urbane irreverence of <span class="italic">Goodbye to All That</span>, has been compared with Robert Graves's book; it is certainly, with David Jones's <span class="italic">In Parenthesis</span>, among the most authentic. Above all, it relates how the innocence of youth was destroyed during a battle in which thousands of Griffith's comrades, and his younger brother Watcyn, were killed.<br>
<br>After the war, during which he had married Winifred Elizabeth Frimston (1887/8&#150;1977) on 6 March 1915, Griffith lived in the village of Neston in Cheshire, commuting to Chester and Liverpool as an officer of the Inland Revenue, but in 1933 he moved to Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire, where the rest of his life was spent. His next two books were novels: <span class="italic">The Wooden Spoon</span> (1937) and the more substantial <span class="italic">The Way Lies West</span> (1945), in both of which he strove to recapture not only the essence of his own youth but that of his parents; neither is as accomplished as his earlier autobiographical works.<br>
<br>Griffiths also wrote a little poetry, including the verse-play for radio <span class="italic">Branwen</span>, which was collected in the slim volume <span class="italic">The Barren Tree</span> (1945). Most of his poems drew their inspiration from Welsh legend or from his experience of war; one of his sons was killed in action in 1942. He abandoned poetry shortly afterwards, turning instead to the writing of factual books about the land and people of Wales for the enlightenment of English readers, including his own children, who were brought up in England and were unable to speak Welsh. The most authoritative, and for long the only book on its subject in English, was <span class="italic">The Welsh</span> (1950), which was first published as a Pelican paperback. This book presented a fastidiously balanced view of Wales, its history and culture, and also argued in favour of a measure of administrative devolution within the British state, although it had little to say about industrial south Wales and was dubious about whether Cardiff deserved to become the country's capital; for Griffith, Wales was where the Welsh language was spoken. The same desire to introduce English readers to literature written in Welsh animated his work as a translator. He translated <span class="italic">Tea in the Heather</span> (1968) and <span class="italic">The Living Sleep</span> (1976), both by the major prose writer Kate Roberts, and wrote a children's version of a tale from the <span class="roman">Mabinogion</span>, <span class="italic">The Saga of Pryderi</span> (1961).<br>
<br>Griffith also represented Wales as a prominent member of many public bodies. He was chairman of the council of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion, perhaps the most establishmentarian of all the London Welsh societies; vice-chairman of the Arts Council of Great Britain and chairman of its Welsh committee; chairman of the National Book League; vice-president of the London Centre of the PEN Club; and a member of the Welsh committee of the British Council. A frequent broadcaster in both Welsh and English, he was for twenty-one years a member of the Welsh team in the popular radio series <span class="italic">Round Britain Quiz</span> and gave many radio talks about the complexities of PAYE (pay as you earn) income tax in the series <span class="italic">Can I Help you?</span> His contribution to Welsh life brought him honours from several quarters: he was made a CBE in 1961 and received the honorary degree of DLitt from the University of Wales and the gold medal of the Cymmrodorion. He died on 27 September 1977 in Southbank Nursing Home, 1&#150;2 Cavendish Road, Bowdon, Cheshire, and was buried in the graveyard of Nebo Chapel, Rhiw, Caernarvonshire.<br>
