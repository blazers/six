<span class="headword">Stewart,  James, of the Glen</span> <span class="st"> [Seumas a'Ghlinne]</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1700, <em>d.</em> 1752), <span class="occ">convicted accessory to murder</span>, born James Stewart (the son of John Stewart of Ardshiel, a merchant), was the illegitimate elder brother of Charles Stewart (<i>d</i>. 1757), fifth of Ardshiel, who led out the Appin Stewarts from north Argyll in the Jacobite rising of 1745. About 1725 he married Margaret, sister of William Stewart, a merchant from Maryburgh; they had three children, Alan, Charles, and Elizabeth.<br>
<br>Although he fought at the battle of Culloden in April 1746, as a captain in the Appin regiment, Stewart's talents were entrepreneurial rather than military. As well as managing the township of Glen Duror, he was a leading shopkeeper in Appin, associated with smugglers, and was connected through his wife's family to colonial traders in Fort William. Because of his business acumen, James Stewart was entrusted with the management of his half-brother's estate at the outset of the 1745 rising and, subsequent to the enforced exile and forfeiture of Ardshiel, remitted his rents to France.<br>
<br>Stewart's covert dealings were known to, and tacitly supported by, Colin Campbell of Glenure (usually called Glenure), crown factor for the Ardshiel estate. However, amicable relations deteriorated steadily as Glenure came under increasing pressure from the Scottish barons of the exchequer to discriminate against known Jacobite tenants. Lady Ardshiel was prosecuted through the courts in an unsuccessful attempt to recover rents received by her since April 1746. Stewart lost Glen Duror, and though compensated with a lease of the township of Aucharn, was deprived of his shop. Despite indiscretions induced by excess alcohol, relations between Stewart and Glenure had not broken down irretrievably. Indeed, Glenure's relationship with the Camerons of Callart and of Lochiel was more fraught, troops having been called in to collect rents and effect evictions while he factored these forfeited estates.<br>
<br>Early in 1752 Stewart was instructed to evict a number of tenants from the Ardshiel estate. He protested and made an unsuccessful visit to Glenure in Edinburgh on 5 May. Glenure then travelled north to carry out the evictions. Returning home from Fort William on 14 May, he was murdered by a gunman who escaped unrecognized. Alan Breac Stewart, a known Jacobite and former ward of James Stewart, was presumed to have carried out the &#145;Appin murder&#146;, although he was never apprehended. James Stewart was charged with being an accessory to the murder and tried at Inveraray in September 1752. The trial, before which Stewart was denied legal counsel, is widely recognized by historians to have been a travesty of justice. Archibald Campbell, third duke of Argyll, the political manager for the Scottish whigs, presided. Stewart faced a prosecution concerned primarily with political advancement and deferring further clan resistance. In his defence he claimed that the murder had been carried out by John Cameron (alias Sargeant Mor), a vindictive Jacobite soldier of fortune. Oral tradition affirms that the Camerons as well as the Stewarts of Appin had actively countenanced two, if not three, attempts on Glenure's life in May 1752. A series of intimidated witnesses failed to corroborate Stewart's story, and he was found guilty by a jury of eleven Campbells and four others. He was sentenced to hang at Ballachulish ferry on 8 November 1752. His body, bound in chains, was left on the gibbet for over two years before being removed by John Stewart, younger of Ballachulish, the one member of the Appin gentry who actively promoted the legal defence of his kinsman. The Appin murder has always aroused great curiosity because of its insolubility as well as its treatment by Robert Louis Stevenson in <span class="italic">Kidnapped</span> and <span class="italic">Catriona</span>.<br>
