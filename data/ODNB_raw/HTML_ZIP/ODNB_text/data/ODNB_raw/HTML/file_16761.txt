<span class="headword">Lister,  Joseph</span>  (1627&#150;1709), <span class="occ">nonconformist autobiographer</span>, was born on 7 June 1627 at Bradford, Yorkshire, to &#145;godly religious parents&#146;. His father died when Joseph was about six and, after a period at the free grammar school, he was apprenticed by his mother to John Sharp, a godly clothier of the town, about 1641. At this time Joseph attended &#145;many funeral sermons, lectures and monthly exercises and constantly repeated what I had heard&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 7), and his autobiography describes his puritan upbringing, conveying effectively the influence of the preachers on the religious temper of that part of the West Riding on the eve of the civil wars. The panic which passed through the population of the area following the Irish rising in 1641 is described graphically and, after the outbreak of war, Joseph also compiled a full account of the siege and relief of Bradford in 1643. As a result of the siege his master withdrew from the town and Lister moved to another master at Sowerby in Halifax parish, where he completed his apprenticeship and set up in trade for a short time. In the early 1650s, possibly following an ill-judged engagement to his former master's daughter, Lister moved to London, where he joined the presbyterian congregation of Edmund Calamy at St Mary Aldermanbury, and where, as he was later to acknowledge, he was influenced by the preaching of Simeon Ashe. Lister remained in London for about three years, finding employment as a servant in various godly households.<br>
<br>In 1655 Lister returned north, to Greatham, co. Durham, as steward to Captain Askwith, and stayed there for two years, commenting on the poor quality of preaching in that region. Following a period of illness he returned to his mother's house at Bradford and in 1657 he married Sarah Denton, of a local family, in a civil ceremony which was followed later by a church service conducted by his uncle Edward Hill of Crofton, later a nonconformist minister. Soon after his marriage he inherited from his wife's uncle a farm at Bailey Fold, Allerton, in the parish of Bradford, and farmed there. His puritan convictions were out of sympathy with the established church after the Restoration, and he joined the dissenting congregation at Kipping nearby, playing a prominent part in its activities. The early years of the church there were characterized by faction and schism involving radical Fifth Monarchist elements, and these engaged the attention of other leading dissenters, such as Oliver Heywood, who tried to act as peacemakers. In the absence of a settled pastor, Lister sometimes exercised ministerial functions during these disturbances. He intended his two sons for the ministry and sent the elder, David, to Richard Frankland's academy at Kendal, where he died in 1677. The second son, Accepted, became a minister and preached at Kipping, being called by the congregation, but he did not settle there, and in 1695 moved to the congregation at Bingley. Accepted had been partially disabled following a fall from a horse and was joined at Bingley by Lister and his wife, the latter dying there about 1697. Lister remained there, but returned to the farm at Allerton when his son returned to the church at Kipping in 1702 as &#145;a repairer of breaches&#146;.<br>
<br>Joseph Lister remained at Allerton until his death on 11 March 1709, a fortnight after that of his son. He was buried on 13 March in the chapel yard at Horton, Bradford, and his funeral sermon was preached by Thomas Whitaker of Leeds. By his will Lister left his estate at Allerton to his nephew Joshua Dawson of Leeds, with legacies of &pound;100 to each of his four remaining nephews and nieces, along with other small bequests. His autobiography, which is typical of other puritan texts in its emphasis on the workings of God's providence at critical moments of the subject's life, remained unpublished until 1842, though his account of the siege of Bradford was published earlier, in 1810.<br>
