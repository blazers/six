<span class="headword">Loop,  George</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Edmund of St Joseph]</span>  (1648&#150;1716), <span class="occ">Discalced Carmelite friar</span>, was born in Herefordshire, the son of George Loop, of a long-established Catholic family from Garway in Herefordshire, and his wife, Winifred. He was sent to Flanders for his education and found his vocation in the order of Discalced Carmelites who maintained a priory at Louvain. He was professed on 22 October 1667 aged nineteen, taking the name Edmund of St Joseph. He continued his studies at Louvain and at the Missionary College of St Pancras in Rome.<br>
<br>In September 1677, shortly after his ordination as a priest, Loop returned to England to minister in Hereford. He had hardly begun his apostolate when he became a victim of the Popish Plot. His presence in the county became known to John Scudamore of Kentchurch, a justice of the peace, who instigated a search for him. He was forced to take flight, finding refuge in woods and outhouses. He was once hiding in a haystack which the searchers investigated with their swords, but managed to escape detection and injury. He fled disguised as a farmer's wife and reached London where his pursuers soon caught up with him. He had several more remarkable escapes. On one occasion his was the only room in the house where he was lodging which was not searched and another close call came when pursuivants crawled from the roof of an adjoining house and reached his window but were unable to break in.<br>
<br>In 1680 Loop moved to Worcester where there had been no priest for over a year because of the furore resulting from the plot. He ministered to the scattered Catholic community and was renowned for his poverty of life and generosity to the poor, giving away the alms which richer people gave him for his own subsistence. He travelled on foot and dressed in the rags of a beggar. His austere lifestyle not surprisingly led to a breakdown in health. The Worcester Catholics pleaded that he should not be taken from them and he was given an assistant, Francis of the Child Jesus, who was able to share the labours of the mission.<br>
<br>The accession of James II in 1685 permitted the provision of a public Catholic chapel in Worcester which was opened with solemn mass on Christmas eve 1686 in a house in Foregate Street. When James II fled in 1688 the priests also had to leave as the mob prepared to attack and wreck the chapel. They were able to return to Worcester about 1690 and the mission remained in their care until about 1720. The English vicar provincial, Lucian of St Teresa, died in 1691 and Loop succeeded him, holding the office for at least twelve years. He moved to London where he also ministered as chaplain to a Catholic family.<br>
<br>During his early years as provincial Loop wrote <span class="italic">The Queen of Heaven's Livery</span>, subtitled &#145;A short treatise of the institution, excellency, priviledges, and indulgencies of the most famous confraternity of our Blessed Lady of Mount Carmel, commonly called the Scapular: together with a brief relation of the antiquity and never-interrupted succession of the religious order of the Carmelites, to whom the B. Virgin Mary gave this her sacred livery&#146;, printed in Antwerp in 1709, although a first edition appeared in 1706. A proposal to publish a new edition in 1725 was suppressed by Bonaventure Giffard, vicar apostolic of the London district, in the light of virulent attacks on the work by Richard Jameson, an eccentric secular priest in Lancashire. Jameson published his criticisms in 1726 in a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The Queen of Heaven's Livery is Quite Worn Out with Ould Age, and Past Mending</span>. Loop died in London on 6 February 1716.<br>
