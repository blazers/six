<span class="headword">Ward,  John</span>  (1678/9&#150;1758), <span class="occ">antiquary and biographer</span>, was born in London, one of the fourteen children of John Ward (1635&#150;1717), a Baptist minister originally from Tysoe, Warwickshire, and his wife, Constancy Rayner (<i>d</i>. 1697), a lady of acknowledged piety. John and his sister Abigail (<i>d</i>. 1745) were their only surviving children. For some years Ward toiled as a clerk in the Navy Office, feeding his appetite for literature by dint of study in his leisure hours with the assistance of John Ker, a physician who kept an academy in Bethnal Green. Ward left the Navy Office in 1710 and opened his own school for the children of his acquaintances, in Tenter Alley, Moorfields, which he kept for many years. Clearly a sociable man, he was throughout his life a member of various societies, both formal and informal; in 1712 he became one of the earliest members of a society composed principally of divines and lawyers who met periodically to discuss notable texts of civil law or politics in classical times.<br>
<br>Ward's reputation for a knowledge of polite literature, together with some minor publications of his own, led to his appointment in September 1720 as professor of rhetoric in Gresham College. He lived in the college thereafter, possibly with his sister, since she died in his apartments in 1745. Ward was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in November 1723, contributed several articles on aspects of Roman archaeology and numismatics to the society's <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>, served on its council, and in 1752 was elected one of its vice-presidents. He was one of several who engaged in published dispute with Conyers Middleton&#151;in Ward's case on the status of physicians in classical Rome. More profitably he contributed to a range of publications, by checking text, writing introductions, and providing translations. Among these works were J. A. De Thou's <span class="italic">History of his Own Age</span> (1728, from the French of 1604&#150;8); Robert Ainsworth's <span class="italic">Latin Dictionary</span> (1736 and later editions); the works of the dissenting minister George Benson; and the second edition of Martin Folkes's <span class="italic">Tables of English Silver and Gold Coins</span> (1763). He translated into Latin the eighth edition of Richard Mead's <span class="italic">Discourse of the Plague</span> (1723), and for the 1732 edition of William Lily's <span class="italic">A Short Introduction of Latin Grammar</span> (first published in 1652) he restored the defective text and provided a history of that grammar. He contributed an essay on the Peutinger table, so far as it related to Britain, to John Horsley's <span class="italic">Britannia Romana</span> (3 vols., 1732) and his own copy of that work, with manuscript corrections, is in the British Library. Assistance to a member of the University of Edinburgh brought him the degree of LLD in 1751.<br>
<br>In August 1733 Ward set off on a tour of the Low Countries, Flanders, and France, from which he returned home in October. He assiduously visited the tourist sites and of course the better known bookshops, and called on acquaintances, among them Abraham Gronovius, whom he was assisting with an edition of Aelianus's <span class="italic">De natura animalium</span>. In February 1736 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, of which he became director in January 1747 and vice-president in April 1753. Also in 1736 he joined another society, formed by various gentlemen and noblemen for the encouragement of learning (probably the &#145;Societas ad literas promovendi&#146;, which published <span class="italic">De natura animalium</span> in 1744) and he later became a member of the Spalding Gentlemen's Society.<br>
<br>Ward's major work is undoubtedly his <span class="italic">Lives of the professors of Gresham College, to which is prefaced the life of the founder, Sir Thomas Gresham</span> (1740), which dealt with all those who had been appointed since 1597, when the first inaugural lectures were delivered. An interleaved copy with Ward's corrections and additions, now in the British Library, was presumably intended for a second edition. His own lectures were published in two volumes as <span class="italic">A system of oratory, delivered in a course of lectures publickly read at Gresham College, London</span> (1759).<br>
<br>When the British Museum was founded in 1753 Ward was elected one of its trustees. He regularly attended meetings and advised on various aspects of cataloguing until November 1757, when illness kept him at home. He died in his apartments in Gresham College in the early hours of 18 October 1758. He was buried in the dissenters' burial-ground at Bunhill Fields, where his sister had previously been interred, having written his own obituary in 1752, when he gave his age as seventy-three. In his will Ward left his globes, coin collection, and certain early printed books to specific friends, directing his executors to arrange a public sale of his library and other effects.<br>
