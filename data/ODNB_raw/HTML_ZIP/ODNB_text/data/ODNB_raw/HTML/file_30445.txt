<span class="headword">Armes,  Philip</span>  (1836&#150;1908), <span class="occ">organist</span>, born at Norwich on 15 August 1836, was the eldest son of Philip Armes, a schoolmaster and bass singer and his wife, Mary. He was a chorister in Norwich Cathedral from 1846 to 1848, then joined the choir of Rochester Cathedral on the appointment of his father as bass lay clerk there. Possessed of a beautiful voice, he achieved great success as solo boy, and on retiring from the choir in 1850 received a public testimonial. He was determined to be a professional musician, and in 1850 was articled to John Larkin Hopkins, organist of Rochester Cathedral; up to 1856 he acted as Hopkins's assistant, at the same time serving as organist of Milton church, Gravesend. In 1857 he passed to St Andrews, Wells Street, London, then in 1861 moved to Chichester Cathedral, and finally in 1862 settled as organist of Durham Cathedral, where he remained until his death. He had graduated BMus at Oxford in 1858, and was admitted to the same degree <i>ad eundem</i> at Durham in 1863. He proceeded DMus at Oxford in 1864 and at Durham <i>ad eundem</i> in 1874. Also in 1864, on 14 January Armes married Emily Jane, the daughter of Sir Henry Davison, chief justice of the supreme court of Madras, India; they had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>From 1873 to 1883 Armes was the honorary conductor of the Durham Musical Society, and later he played first viola for the Durham Orchestral Society. When Durham University instituted its external degrees in music, Armes drew up the scheme for the first examinations, conducted in 1890. He received ample recognition for his contributions in the field: in 1891 Durham University conferred on him the honorary degree of MA and in 1897, when the chair of music was formally instituted at the university, he was appointed the first professor of music. He was also made an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Organists. Armes died at his home, 17 North Bailey, Durham, on 10 February 1908, and was buried in the cemetery of St Mary-le-Bow, Durham. A memorial to him was placed in the west cloister of Durham Cathedral.<br>
<br>Armes's compositions comprise an oratorio, <span class="italic">Hezekiah</span>, produced at Newcastle upon Tyne (1877), two cantatas, <span class="italic">St John the Evangelist</span>, produced at York Minster (1881), and <span class="italic">St Barnabas</span>, produced at Durham (1891), numerous services, anthems, and hymn tunes, and much organ music. He received the Molineux prize and gold medal offered by the Madrigal Society in 1897 for his madrigal &#145;Victoria&#146;.<br>
