<span class="headword">Ure,  Mary Eileen</span>  (1933&#150;1975), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 18 February 1933 at 17 Kelvinside Terrace South, Glasgow, daughter of Colin McGregor Ure, engineer, and his wife, Edith Hannah Eileen Willis Swinburne. She was educated at the Mount School, York, and trained at the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art, making her first stage appearance in 1954 in Alan Melville's <span class="italic">Simon and Laura</span> at the Opera House, Manchester. She made her name as Amanda in Jean Anouilh's <span class="italic">Time Remembered</span> in her London d&eacute;but at the Lyric, Hammersmith, in December 1954, a production that included Paul Scofield, with whom she went on to play Ophelia to his Hamlet in Peter Brook's production. Before opening at the Phoenix Theatre in December 1955, the company took <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> to the Moscow Art Theatre for two weeks: the nunnery scene was televised for Russian television, with Mary Ure playing opposite a Russian actor, each speaking in their own language. In 1956, at the Royal Court Theatre, she played Abigail Williams in the first London production of Arthur Miller's <span class="italic">The Crucible</span>.<br>
<br>Mary Ure was cast as Alison, opposite Kenneth Haigh playing Jimmy Porter, in the original production of John Osborne's <span class="italic">Look Back in Anger</span>, put on by the English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre in 1956, the play that established Osborne as the original &#145;angry young man&#146;, and started a vogue for &#145;kitchen sink&#146; drama. She also starred in the film of the play, in 1957, opposite Richard Burton. In 1957 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55236/', "John Osborne (1929&#150;1994)")</script>, the second of his five wives: the marriage ended in divorce in 1963 and the relationship was chronicled by Osborne in the second volume of his autobiography, <span class="italic">Almost a Gentleman</span> (1991). For Ure <span class="italic">Look Back in Anger</span> was followed by a part in Arthur Miller's <span class="italic">A View from the Bridge</span> at the Comedy Theatre, a very successful production that ran from October 1956 until April 1957, directed by Peter Brook. After starring in the 1957 Broadway production of <span class="italic">Look Back in Anger</span>, she did a season at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford upon Avon, in 1959, playing Titania to Robert Hardy's Oberon in Peter Hall's production of <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>, and Desdemona to Paul Robeson's Othello. Following this, in 1960 she replaced Claire Bloom in Jean Giradoux's <span class="italic">Duel of Angels</span> in Boston, playing opposite Vivien Leigh, before touring the United States. Back in London in 1960, at the Royal Court, she again took the part of Abigail Williams in <span class="italic">The Crucible</span>, and Beatrice in Thomas Middleton's <span class="italic">The Changeling</span> in 1961. The cast of <span class="italic">The Changeling</span> included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57319/', "Robert Shaw (1927&#150;1978)")</script>, whom she married in 1963: it was his second marriage also. They had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Although Ure left the stage in 1961 for several years, by then she was an established film actress, after roles in <span class="italic">Storm over the Nile</span> (1955), <span class="italic">Windom's Way</span> (1957), and <span class="italic">Sons and Lovers</span> (1960), and her film career continued with <span class="italic">The Mind Benders</span> (1963), <span class="italic">The Luck of Ginger Coffey</span> (1964), <span class="italic">Custer of the West</span> (1966), <span class="italic">Where Eagles Dare</span> (1968), and <span class="italic">A Reflection of Fear</span> (1973). She returned to the stage briefly in 1967 in Tennessee Williams's <span class="italic">Two Character Play</span>, and was in the cast of the Broadway production of Harold Pinter's <span class="italic">Old Times</span> (1971&#150;2).<br>
<br>Blonde and beautiful, Mary Ure was often cast in the role of an innocent victim. She returned to the London stage on 2 April 1975 in <span class="italic">The Exorcism</span> at the Comedy Theatre, but died from a fatal overdose on 3 April after celebrating the successful opening of the play.<br>
