<span class="headword">Seager <span class="st"> [Segar]</span>,  Francis</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1549&#150;1563), <span class="occ">translator and poet</span>, the son of Nicholas Seager, was raised in a yeoman family in Devon. He began his literary career at the time of the explosion of protestant publication during the reign of Edward VI. In 1549 the London printers John Day and William Seres published <span class="italic">A brefe declaration of the great, and innumerable myseries, [and] wretchednesses used in courte</span>. This tract constitutes a new edition and expansion by Seager of William Caxton's translation of Alain Chartier's <span class="italic">Curial</span> from the original French. Seager also published <span class="italic">Certayne psalmes select out of the psalter of David, and drawen into Englyshe metre, with notes to every psalme</span>, which was printed twice by Edward Whitchurch in 1549, by John Harrington in 1549 and 1550, and by William Seres in 1553. Dedicated to Lord Francis Russell, the only son of the first earl of Bedford, this work is a metrical translation of nineteen psalms, together with a poem in the same ballad metre entitled &#145;A Description of the Life of Man, the World and the Vanities Thereof&#146;. The poet may have been the &#145;Fraunces Nycholson <i>Alias</i> Seager&#146; who was made free of the Stationers' Company on 24 September 1557.<br>
<br>During the reign of Mary I, Seager again turned to Seres to publish his <span class="italic">Schoole of Vertue, and booke of good nourture for chyldren, and youth to learne theyer dutie by</span> (1557). This popular work consists of twelve chapters of simple, irregular rhyme, each describing a particular &#145;duty&#146; and the &#145;degrees&#146; necessary for its achievement. An acrostic that spells out the author's name provides a preface. Amid a flurry of moralistic attacks on poetry Crowley issued a new edition of the <span class="italic">School of Vertue</span> in 1582, arguing that poetry plays an important role in the moral education of both children and adults, and is a powerful didactic tool. To Seager's work Crowley added his own metrical &#145;Prayers and Graces&#146;. The popularity of Crowley's edition among a humble readership is suggested by a comment claiming that this book was &#145;commonly sold at the stalls of ballad-singers&#146;. An abridged version of <span class="italic">School of Vertue</span> also appears in Robert Weste's <span class="italic">Booke of Demeanor</span> of 1619, reprinted in 1817, and again in 1868, by the Early English Text Society, as <span class="italic">The Babees Book</span>.<br>
<br>Seager contributed a moralistic poem of forty-four rhyme royal stanzas entitled &#145;How Richard Plantagenet, duke of Gloucester, murdered his brother's children, usurping the crowne&#146; to the 1563 edition of the <span class="italic">Mirror for Magistrates</span>. He found ample evidence of political corruption and tyranny in the story of Richard III and hoped that his history would provide a model of vice that contemporary civil servants might avoid. A prose colloquy appended to the poem acknowledges the irregularity of Seager's rhyme royal but claims that it observes decorum in complementing Richard's unsavoury character. Scholars assume that William Shakespeare incorporated minor details from Seager's poem into <span class="italic">The Tragedy of Richard III</span> (<i>c</i>.1592). He was married to Anne Sherard with whom he had two sons and one daughter: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/109694/', "Francis Segar")</script>, who spent his career at the court of the Landgrave Moritz in Hesse; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25033/', "William Segar")</script>, Norroy king of arms under Elizabeth and Garter king of arms under James and Charles I; and Jane, who authored, in 1589, &#145;The divine prophesies of the ten sibills&#146;, a bound manuscript intended for Queen Elizabeth (BL, Add. MS 10037).<br>
<br>Francis Seager is remembered as a versatile man of letters, important in bringing the humanist impetus of much popular poetry of the day into the service of the Reformation.<br>
