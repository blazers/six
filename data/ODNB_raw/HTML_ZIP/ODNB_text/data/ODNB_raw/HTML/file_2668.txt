</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blomfield,  Charles James</span>  (1786&#150;1857), <span class="occ">bishop of London</span>, was born on 29 May 1786 at Bury St Edmunds, the eldest son among the six children of Charles Blomfield (1763&#150;1831), a schoolmaster (as was Charles James's grandfather, James), JP, and chief alderman of Bury, and his wife, Hester (1765&#150;1844), daughter of Edward Pawsey, a Bury grocer. Charles James began his formal education at the age of eight under Michael Thomas Becher at Bury grammar school, where he acquired the nickname &#145;Tit&#146; Blomfield. He often rose at five o'clock in the morning to commence his studies and displayed a precocious ambition, boldly declaring that &#145;I mean to be a bishop&#146;. In 1799 Blomfield was awarded a King's scholarship at Eton College, but his father refused to send him to the school.<h2>
<a name="Universityclassicalscholarshipandearlyecclesiasticalcareer"></a>University, classical scholarship, and early ecclesiastical career</h2>In 1804 Blomfield was admitted pensioner at Trinity College, Cambridge. He had been a sickly child, and his efforts as an undergraduate left him with an enduring nervous condition. For years after he suffered from disordered digestion and would experience nervous spasms when riding. None the less he showed great promise: in 1805 he gained a scholarship and won Browne's prize for a Latin ode, and the following year won a Craven scholarship and took Browne's prize for a Greek ode. Edward Maltby was sufficiently impressed to take Blomfield as a pupil without payment. Solitary by nature, Blomfield nevertheless counted as friends some promising contemporaries, including his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2669/', "Edward Valentine Blomfield")</script>, James Henry Monk, and Thomas Rennell the younger; Frederick Pollock coached Blomfield when, from 1806, he decided to concentrate on his mathematical studies. Blomfield graduated BA as third wrangler in 1808, also winning the chancellor's medal and the member's prize for a Latin dissertation. In 1809 he was elected a fellow of Trinity. Blomfield was ordained deacon in March 1810 and priest in June by the master of Trinity, William Lort Mansel of Bristol, and, having declined the position of tutor to Lord Chesterfield's sons, accepted a curacy at Chesterford, Essex. In October 1810 he was presented to Quarrington, Lincolnshire, by Lord Bristol (a former pupil of Blomfield's grandfather and friend of his father). There being no parsonage at Quarrington, he continued to reside at Chesterford. In November 1810 Blomfield married Anna Maria (<i>b</i>. 1784/5, <i>d</i>. 1818), daughter of W. Heath of Hemblington, Norfolk. The couple had six children, of whom only one survived infancy.<br>
<br>In December 1811 Blomfield resigned Chesterford (retaining Quarrington until 1820) when the second Earl Spencer, impressed by his edition of <span class="italic">Prometheus vinctus</span> (1810), presented him to the rectory of Dunton, Buckinghamshire, where he resided until 1817. A parish of only seventy-two inhabitants, with only one non-communicant male, this, like his previous livings, afforded Blomfield the opportunity to take in pupils (including George Spencer and Lord Hervey) and pursue his classical studies. He soon established a considerable reputation, being among the most important of a group of scholars, including Maltby, Monk, and Peter Paul Dobree, who were pupils of Richard Porson and adopted his editorial principles. Blomfield's editions of <span class="italic">Septem contra Thebas</span> (1812), the <span class="italic">Pers&aelig;</span> (1814), <span class="italic">Agamemnon</span> (1820), and the <span class="italic">Choephoroe</span> (1824) were accurate and critical, if prosaic, and displayed his extensive learning. His 1815 edition of Callimachus was for some time the standard text; he also produced an edition of Euripides (1821), and contributed editions of fragments of Sappho, Alcaeus, and Stesichorus to Thomas Gaisford's <span class="italic">Poet&aelig; minores Gr&aelig;ci</span> (1823). When Edward Blomfield died in 1816 Charles completed his translation of Matthiae's Greek grammar. In 1813 he founded the important journal <span class="italic">Museum Criticum</span> with Monk, which published fragments and lesser-known authors rather than prize poems; he himself contributed many articles before it closed in 1826. Like the others in what Samuel Parr dubbed the &#145;critical gang&#146; of Porsonians, however, Blomfield also sustained his teacher's academic feuds. His acerbic criticism of scholars associated with both Parr and Abraham Valpy gave notice of the arrogant manner on which many later commented. From 1810 until 1815, when the overall tone of the journal led him to sever his connection, he wrote on classical subjects for the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>. His first review, of Samuel Butler's uncritical Aeschylus, provoked a fierce reply from Butler who thought Blomfield was &#145;showing himself off at my expense&#146; and alienated Parr  (Butler, 1.61). His criticism of Edmund Henry Barker's edition of Henri Estienne's Greek thesaurus in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> of 1820 destroyed Barker's academic reputation, and elicited an equally outspoken response in <span class="italic">Aristarchus Anti-Blomfieldianus</span>. Blomfield came to regret at least some of these spats: he was reconciled with Butler by 1818, and he later secured George Burges, who had accused Blomfield of plagiarism, a pension from the civil list.<br>
<br>If clerical life at Dunton was relaxed, Blomfield was not simply a gentleman scholar. In 1813 he was appointed a JP. He was reading in patristics, and in 1817 and 1819 published on Jewish tradition and the understanding of scripture. More practically, he established a district depot at Aylesbury for the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK). In a visitation sermon for George Pretyman he called the clergy to pastoral responsibility and doctrinal orthodoxy, condemning both Calvinism and Socinianism. While in his preaching he was emerging as a high-churchman, he was widely regarded as a liberal on account of his support for Roman Catholic relief and his taking the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>. The apparent inconsistency was seized on by Barker, who suggested that the public contrast &#145;his Speech in the chapel of Trinity College on the character of William the Third, worthy of a man bearing the Christian names (<i>Charles James</i>) of Mr. Fox, with certain passages of his printed sermons, more worthy of the Tory and the High-Churchman&#146;  (Barker, 112).<h2>
<a name="RectorinLondon"></a>Rector in London</h2>A new phase of Blomfield's life began a few years before 1820. His first wife died in 1818 and in the following year he married Dorothy (1795&#150;1870), widow of the barrister Thomas Kent and daughter of a brewer, Charles William Cox, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Munnings. The eleven offspring of this marriage proved healthier than those of Blomfield's first, only one dying in infancy: among their children were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1690/', "Lucy Elizabeth Bather")</script>, the children's writer, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2667/', "Arthur William Blomfield")</script>, architect. His clerical career now rapidly advanced. In 1817 Lord Bristol presented Blomfield to the rectory and vicarage of Great and Little Chesterford and to the rectory of Tuddenham, Suffolk (resigned 1820); he was also appointed chaplain to Bishop Howley of London. In 1819, shortly after Bristol brought Blomfield to the attention of his brother-in-law Lord Liverpool, Howley presented him to St Botolph without Bishopsgate, London, a preferred candidate having refused it on discovering that the parsonage was frequented by the graveyard rats. With his new parish yielding some &pound;1600 per annum net, Blomfield's financial position was secured. St Botolph's was a fashionable living (it was at the request of parishioners that in 1820 Blomfield added a DD to the BD acquired in 1818). It further contrasted with Blomfield's previous cures in having a population of over 10,000; Chesterford, which he retained and where he spent three months annually, became literally a rest-cure.<br>
<br>St Botolph's presented Blomfield with the pastoral challenge of the city. He reorganized the parish finances, visited his flock, promoted infant schools, and preached regularly in his straightforward style against heterodoxy and expounding basic doctrines. His classical publications were now supplemented by a catechism, sermons, occasional essays in church defence, an abandoned plan for a simplified <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, and, perhaps surprisingly for a high-churchman, a <span class="italic">Manual of Family Prayers</span> in 1824. Pastoral experience softened his attitude to evangelicalism, for he gradually permitted the SPCK to distribute more evangelical tracts, and even proposed Charles Simeon as a member. As importantly, however, as an associate of Howley in London he was at the heart of the network of charitable and auxiliary societies of the orthodox high-church circle of the Hackney Phalanx, and his activity in both the SPCK and the National Society probably confirmed him in his own high-churchmanship.<br>
<br>The year 1822 brought further preferment when Howley appointed Blomfield archdeacon of Colchester (15 January 1822). His relish at his new authority was apparent in his primary charge, as George Biber described it exhibiting &#145;as much of the <i>os</i> as of the <i>oculus episcopi</i>&#146;  (Biber, 40). Only two years later Lord Liverpool offered him the see of Chester; he was consecrated on 20 June 1824. Lady Spencer urged him to accept exile to one of the largest, poorest, and most remote dioceses, astutely indicating the prospect of London should Howley be elevated to Canterbury: &#145;remember it is the step you must tread on to a richer one&#146;  (Blomfield, <span class="italic">Memoir</span>, 1.93). The pill was sugared with permission to retain St Botolph's.<h2>
<a name="BishopofChester18241828"></a>Bishop of Chester, 1824&#150;1828</h2>Although often absent in London, at Chester Blomfield established himself as a reformer. Diocesan committees of the national church societies were reinvigorated or established. In 1827 the post of archdeacon of Richmond was restored to full activity; he himself visited the major manufacturing towns. Among Blomfield's chief concerns, however, was the clergy. If Liverpool was &#145;the most orthodox and <i>canonical</i> place that I have yet seen (Hackney always excepted)&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. lett. c. 789, fol. 128<i>v</i>), the diocese as a whole was &#145;sadly relaxed&#146; in discipline. He stressed rubrical observance, insisting on the gown in the pulpit, and deplored Wednesday evening lectures as undermining the proper services. The doctrine of the atonement was to be preached distinctly. Collections for non-diocesan charities and especially for pan-denominational causes were discouraged. A strict ordination policy was imposed to raise clerical standards, Blomfield rejecting former servicemen and reducing the number of non-graduates and Irishmen admitted. Clergy discipline brought out Blomfield's puritanical streak. He discouraged secular amusements, especially fox-hunting. Sydney Smith versified Blomfield's primary charge:<blockquote>
<div>Hunt not, fish not, shoot not;<br>
</div>
<div>Dance not, fiddle not, flute not;<br>
</div>
<div>But before all things, it's my particular desire;<br>
</div>
<div>That once at least in every week, you take<br>
</div>
<div>Your dinner with the squire.<br>
</div> (Soloway, 320)</blockquote>Blomfield could assume the last activity to be non-corrupting, given his attitude to lay pursuits. He was a lifelong sabbatarian. At Chesterford he successfully demanded that the Newmarket races no longer commence on Monday so that the village was not swamped by racegoers on Sunday, just as later he opposed the Sunday opening of the Great Exhibition. He was also a temperance campaigner, serving as the first president of the London Temperance Association from 1831 and in 1830 promoting a licensing bill which would have regulated not only beer but also skittles.<h2>
<a name="AppointmentasbishopofLondon1828"></a>Appointment as bishop of London, 1828</h2>On 23 August 1828 Howley's promotion to Lambeth indeed saw Blomfield translated to London, and he was also appointed a privy councillor and dean of the chapels royal. He had earned his elevation not only in his diocesan activity, but in the House of Lords, where his first speech answered Lord Holland's attack on the church in the Catholic emancipation debates of 1825. Blomfield now spoke as an opponent of emancipation. He claimed that closer examination of the Roman church had changed his opinions; critics observed the change of patron away from the pro-emancipation Bristol and Spencer. If Blomfield was now clearly aligned with toryism, however, he did not slavishly support the government, voting against Wellington in a critical division on a corn bill on the eve of his elevation. Nor was he willing to defend every aspect of the confessional state, speaking against the profanity of test acts. Blomfield's parliamentary behaviour again attracted criticism during the debates over the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>. Blomfield supported the bill, fearing for the consequences if the church were seen to oppose reform. He absented himself from the crucial vote on the second <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> of October 1831, however, on the grounds of the recent death of his father. His excuse would have carried more weight had he not spoken the following morning at the opening of King's College, London, and he was widely accused of cowardice. Lord Grey subsequently approached Blomfield and secured his vote in April 1832, as well as his assistance in rallying episcopal colleagues to support the bill.<h2>
<a name="Blomfieldandsocialpolicy"></a>Blomfield and social policy</h2>During the 1830s and 1840s Blomfield's participation in parliamentary debates extended beyond ecclesiastical matters. He often spoke on social questions, on which his position was modified in the light of experience (particularly of the metropolis itself). In 1826 he compromised his <i>laissez-faire</i> beliefs sufficiently to organize a committee to relieve distressed weavers in Chester and Spitalfields, urging Peel to intervene. By 1830, however, he seems to have lost his faith in intervention and charity, and instead looked to the moral education of the poor. This attitude underpinned his contribution when appointed by Althorp as chairman of the poor law commission, whose report led to the <span class="roman">Poor Law Amendment Act</span> in 1834. Blomfield was initially an enthusiastic advocate of the act, arguing that it would return the poor to robust independence. He engaged in a bitter exchange with Bishop Henry Phillpotts over the bastardy clauses when the latter complained that they victimized the mothers of illegitimate children, Blomfield arguing that the only relevant consideration was whether the clauses provided an effective check on immorality. Blomfield never publicly defended the act later, however, and this seems to reflect a return to a more interventionist approach. In 1842 he argued that the state should regulate collieries and urban life; in 1847 he backed the ten-hours movement. Blomfield came to acknowledge that improvement of the physical environment of the poor was probably a precondition of their evangelization. It was at his initiative that Edwin Chadwick and the poor law commissioners were instructed in 1839 to compile a <span class="italic">Report on the Sanitary Conditions of the Labouring Population</span>, and throughout the 1840s Blomfield supported associations and legislation to improve sanitation in urban slums. In 1848 he strongly backed Chadwick over the <span class="roman">Public Health Act</span>, and in 1854 fought unsuccessfully to preserve the Board of Health.<h2>
<a name="Ecclesiasticalstatesman"></a>Ecclesiastical statesman</h2>As bishop of London Blomfield was at the heart of the nexus of church and state and was the most important and controversial ecclesiastical statesman of his generation. He was one of Peel's main advisers on church affairs, including appointments, but his energy and administrative ability were of value to all administrations while Howley remained at Canterbury. Blomfield's approach to ecclesiastical issues was, despite his high-churchmanship, essentially pragmatic. He sought the state's co-operation in efforts to equip the church to fulfil its national function (not least as &#145;instructress to the people&#146;) and so answer radical criticism of the church as part of &#145;old corruption&#146;. To this end he was prepared to violate what many regarded as fundamental aspects of an episcopal church polity in the search for efficiency and the resources necessary to fund reform in the absence of direct state financial support. Thus, in the debates on whig Irish church legislation in 1833, Blomfield, while denouncing appropriation, welcomed the redistribution of the church's revenues. In his charge of 1834 Blomfield spoke of discarding &#145;ornamental parts&#146; of the church if they stood &#145;in the way of improvements, calculated to enhance and give lustre to the true beauty of the Church&#151;the beauty of its holy usefulness&#146;  (Blomfield, <span class="italic">Memoir</span>, 1.189). Other high-churchmen were appalled by so apparently utilitarian a conception of the church, and occasionally, as in the debates on the abortive centralizing church discipline bill of 1839, they effectively exposed the ecclesiological shortcomings of Blomfield's arguments.<br>
<br>Blomfield welcomed Lord Grey's royal commission on ecclesiastical revenues of 1832, on which he served. Its report, issued in 1835, provided the statistical basis for the work of the ecclesiastical commission, with which Blomfield was associated from the start. When Peel took office as prime minister in 1834 he consulted Blomfield, Howley, and Henry Goulburn concerning church reform, and it was from these discussions that the ecclesiastical duties and revenues commission emerged in 1835, being metamorphosed into the permanent ecclesiastical commission in 1836. Blomfield became the commission's driving force: as Edward Vernon Harcourt, archbishop of York, later ruefully observed, &#145;Till Blomfield comes, we all sit and mind our pens, and talk about the weather&#146;  (Blomfield, <span class="italic">Memoir</span>, 1.223). The commission produced radical proposals for diocesan reorganization, legislative action on pluralities and non-residence, reduction of the cathedral chapters, and centralized management and redistribution of church property. It was primarily Blomfield who championed the proposals in the House of Lords. The cathedral reforms in particular upset both dignitaries who thought them unwarranted violations of the principles of locality and the sanctity of property and high-churchmen who thought reform should reinvigorate the cathedrals' historic functions rather than redistribute their revenues to the parishes. The failure to include representatives of the lower clergy on the commission, and its reliance on bishops as instruments of reform, prompted accusations of an unmerited arrogation of power to the episcopate, particularly the commissioner bishops, and above all Blomfield, who was one of the most regular attenders and who also served on the church estates committee after 1850. Again Sydney Smith did not spare him, writing in his first &#145;Letter to Archdeacon Singleton&#146; (1837): &#145;He will become the Commission, and when the Church of England is mentioned, it will only mean <i>Charles James</i><i>, of</i> <i>London</i>, who will enjoy a greater power than has ever been possessed by any Churchman since the days of Laud, and will become the <i>Church of England</i> <i>here upon earth</i>&#146;. A spirited riposte came in the embittered Blomfield's finest parliamentary speech, putting the case for the <span class="roman">Dean and Chapters Act</span> on 30 July 1840. To justify his approach to church reform Blomfield contrasted the splendours of St Paul's Cathedral with the spiritual and moral destitution which surrounded it, and argued that if fear had been a motivation of the commissioners, it was not fear of public opinion but of being found &#145;unfaithful to our trust&#146;. The proposals could be justified on the unanswerable ground of &#145;necessity&#146;.<br>
<br>In other aspects of national ecclesiastical policy Blomfield's position was more typical of a pre-Tractarian high-churchman. Blomfield opposed the <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Bill</span> of 1844 and the Maynooth grant of 1845. He attached great importance to preserving the church's role in education. Blomfield was a leading figure in the foundation of King's College, London, in 1831 as a pointed riposte to the &#145;godless&#146; University College. He contributed considerable sums to the project and sat on council, in 1853 proposing the motion which led to the dismissal of Frederick Denison Maurice on the grounds of his rejection of the doctrine of everlasting punishment. Blomfield was also a keen supporter of the National Society, not least in his own diocese, and a zealous opponent of the Central Society of Education. In 1839 he opposed the government scheme for state supervision of schooling through a committee of the privy council and a non-denominational normal school, and was one of the architects of the &#145;concordat&#146; of 1840 in which a compromise on inspection enabled most churchmen to accept the new arrangements.<br>
<br>To the horror of the Tractarians, but along with other orthodox high-churchmen who welcomed the prospect of introducing the apostolical succession into the Prussian Lutheran church, Blomfield strongly supported the establishment of the Jerusalem bishopric in 1841. His involvement in this last project reflected his responsibility as bishop of London for Anglican clergy overseas without their own bishops. He was a convinced advocate of the need for an increase in the colonial episcopate, and a letter he published on the issue led to the foundation of the Colonial Bishoprics Fund in 1841, no fewer than fifteen dioceses being established during the following twelve years. Blomfield also took a prominent role in the national ecclesiastical controversies at the end of the 1840s. He led the thirteen bishops who publicly remonstrated with Lord John Russell over the elevation of Renn Dickson Hampden to the see of Hereford in 1847. In 1850 he dissented from the majority of the judicial committee of the privy council in the Gorham case, finding for Phillpotts; he had previously sponsored an unsuccessful bill to alter the composition of the final court of appeal in ecclesiastical causes, and did so again after the judgment.<h2>
<a name="ThedioceseofLondonchurchextensionandchurchparty"></a>The diocese of London: church extension and church party</h2>In his own diocese Blomfield set out to relieve the spiritual destitution of the metropolis through an ambitious programme of church extension and diocesan reform (including the revival of the diocese's rural deans in 1833 and ruridecanal chapters in 1844). In 1836 he founded the Metropolitan Church Building Society, which aimed to finance the building of fifty new churches through voluntary contributions (Blomfield's original suggestion of a levy on coal having been rejected). By the time of its incorporation into the Diocesan Church Building Society in 1854 &pound;266,000 had been raised (&pound;106,000 in the first year alone), although the target of fifty churches was not attained. A separate initiative to provide ten new churches for Bethnal Green, commenced in 1839, was complete by 1850, and Blomfield encouraged other localized and private initiatives, not least through his own munificent giving. In all some 200 churches were consecrated in the diocese during his episcopate. The difficulties of financing church extension led him to accept the necessity of pew-rents at a time when others were beginning to question them. Blomfield himself came to realize, however, that church extension in itself was not enough, even when accompanied by no less essential schools. If he never lost faith in the parochial ideal, by the mid-1840s he was reconciled to lay visiting and the use of unconsecrated buildings, and in the 1850s sought to close redundant city churches to facilitate provision elsewhere.<br>
<br>Blomfield's London episcopate coincided with the rise of Tractarianism, and he sympathized with some of its objectives. By 1839, however, he believed extreme high-churchmen to be &#145;corrupting the simplicity of the Gospel&#146;, and in 1842 resigned from the Camden Society and condemned <span class="roman">Tract 90</span> in his charge. The same charge sought to chart a middle way, once again calling for rubrical observance. When Archdeacon Hale repeated the call in the following year evangelical clergy from Islington protested to the bishop, and Blomfield unwisely exempted them from his injunctions. This generated great controversy as others demanded similar concessions while those who had obeyed the bishop felt abandoned, not least as the bishop privately communicated to some his desire that they should disregard his own instructions. Blomfield's vacillations severely damaged his public reputation. Throughout his episcopate Blomfield's dealings with individual clergy were frequently difficult, his overbearing manner provoking much comment; he wrote to one correspondent citing ancient precedent that &#145;St Augustine was Bishop of Hippo, but you will be good enough to remember that I am bishop of London&#146;. In the context of the papal aggression he took a firm line on what he regarded as the romanizing tendency of ritualism, and became involved in controversy over the ministry of William James Early Bennett at St Barnabas, Pimlico, which culminated in Blomfield's insistence on Bennett's resignation in November 1850. His previous tolerance of Bennett's activities again laid him open to the charge of irresolution.<h2>
<a name="Declineanddeath"></a>Decline and death</h2>In 1847 an accident at Osborne left Blomfield with partial facial paralysis and slurred speech; in 1848 he was passed over for Canterbury. Together these two events marked a turning point. While Blomfield remained active, for example taking a prominent part in early proceedings of the revived convocation of Canterbury, he now ceded to Samuel Wilberforce something of his former pre-eminence among the episcopate. In 1855 his eyesight began to fail, and after a seizure he was paralysed on his left side. Early in 1856 he sought to resign his see, and his episcopate closed in controversy over the necessary legislation and its allocation of his continued use of Fulham Palace (on which he had lavished considerable expenditure) and a pension of &pound;6000 in order to keep up his insurances on his resignation on 30 September 1856. Blomfield's health deteriorated further, and after two epileptic seizures he died at Fulham Palace on 5 August 1857. He was buried in the churchyard of All Saints, Fulham, on 11 August.<h2>
<a name="Acontroversialreputation"></a>A controversial reputation</h2>Some 5 feet 8 inches tall, with small hands, a pale complexion, and an &#145;urgent walk&#146;, Blomfield's impetuosity, relentless administrative energy, self-confidence, and pomposity attracted caricature: not only from Sydney Smith but also Disraeli in <span class="italic">Tancred</span> (1847) and Anthony Trollope, who cast him as the eldest son of Archdeacon Grantly in <span class="italic">The Warden</span> (1855). His talents were more suited to his role as administrative reformer than to his efforts to uphold an orthodox high-church vision of the Anglican church as the rise of Tractarianism heightened party tensions. Fellow orthodox high-churchmen were worried by his cavalier way with ecclesiology in his reform initiatives and what they viewed as the unnecessary radicalism of his approach. Evangelicals resented the high-church tendency of his diocesan policy. Tractarians smarted under his criticism and were appalled by his easy relations with secular authority. His fiercest critics exploited the importance of classical scholarship and patronage to his career along with his haughty manner&#151;his son suggested that he had &#145;inherited notions of authority &hellip; disappearing before the democratic progress of the age&#146;  (Blomfield, <span class="italic">Memoir</span>, 2.211)&#151;to portray him as a relic of an outmoded, greedy, Erastian prelacy, an impression reinforced by the fuss over his retirement. In fact Blomfield approached his duties conscientiously and with integrity, and was extremely generous in his private philanthropy. Nevertheless, immediately posthumous assessments were generally at best lukewarm and often hostile, as in Harriet Martineau's <span class="italic">Biographical Sketches</span> (1869), dwelling on what were seen as the shortcomings of his diocesan management and the failings of his church reforms, a judgement long perpetuated in the predominantly Anglo-Catholic tradition of ecclesiastical historiography. Later historians have offered a more positive assessment, recognizing the centrality of Blomfield's contribution to the refashioning of the Victorian church and the importance of his role in the poor law commission, and paying less attention to party disputes in which he became embroiled. He has been presented as a modernizer rather than an archaism: a character symbolized in his being the first bishop to abandon his wig. His role in energizing the ecclesiastical commission, and the explicitly utilitarian approach to church reform this embodied, has come to be regarded as his outstanding achievement. Indeed the gradual rehabilitation of Blomfield's historical reputation has effectively fulfilled his own prediction to Archdeacon John Sinclair: &#145;They may blame me now for these measures, but they will hereafter confess that those very measures have been the saving of the Church&#146;  (Blomfield, <span class="italic">Memoir</span>, 1.227).<br>
