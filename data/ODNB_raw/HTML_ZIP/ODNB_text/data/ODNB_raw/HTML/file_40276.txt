<span class="headword">Allen,  John Willoughby Tarleton</span>  (1904&#150;1979), <span class="occ">colonial administrator and Swahili scholar</span>, was born at Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire, on 14 November 1904, the second child and only son of the vicar, the Revd <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40275/', "Roland Allen (1868&#150;1947)")</script>, writer and theologian, and his wife, Mary Beatrice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tarleton (1863&#150;1960). Allen was educated at Marlborough College (1918&#150;20), where he was a foundation scholar, at Westminster School (1920&#150;22), and at St John's College, Oxford (1923&#150;7), where he gained second-class honours in <i>literae humaniores</i>.<br>
<br>After Oxford he spent two seminal years working for the Gezira cotton scheme in the Sudan (1927&#150;9), learning Arabic, and developing a profound knowledge of Islam and an admiration for Muslim scholarship. He then joined the colonial service as a superintendent of education in Tanganyika (1929&#150;37). On 29 September 1930, in Tanga, he married a fellow teacher, Winifred Ethel Emma (1902&#150;1991), daughter of Hubert Brooke of Mexico City. They had four children, a son and three daughters, one of whom died in childhood. Also in Tanga, Allen made friends with members of the distinguished al-Buhry family, in particular Muhammad Hemedi al-Buhry, who taught Allen Swahili, introduced him to Swahili poetry, and furnished him with many texts. After Tanga School (1930&#150;32) Allen moved to Dar-es-Salaam (1933&#150;6), where he edited the government Swahili newspaper <span class="italic">Mambo Leo</span>. He also became a founder member of the Tanganyika Society, and for its first three years was the editor of its journal, <span class="italic">Tanganyika <span class="roman">(subsequently Tanzania)</span> Notes and Records</span> (modelled on <span class="italic">Sudan Notes and Records</span>).<br>
<br>From 1937 to 1947 and again from 1952 to 1958 Allen served as an administrative officer in Tanganyika. A publication during this time, never superseded, was his <span class="italic">Arabic Script for Students of Swahili</span> (1945 and 1968), a companion to <span class="italic">Maandiko ya Kizungu</span> (1938), which explained roman characters to those who read Swahili in Arabic or Swahili&#150;Arabic script only. The years 1947 to 1952 were spent in the Western Aden Protectorate&#151;a delicate period (when much of the Jewish diaspora in Aden migrated to Israel, and when Russians and Americans courted the regime in the Yemen while clandestinely searching the area for oil fields). This was the most important part of Allen's colonial career.<br>
<br>Retiring early from the Colonial Office, Allen moved to Makerere University College, Kampala, as warden of University Hall (1958&#150;65). From 1959 he was also secretary of the East African Swahili Committee&#151;then located at Makerere but which moved to the new Dar-es-Salaam University College, where the committee was finally transformed into the Institute of Swahili Research. The glory of &#145;Swahili&#146; Swahili consists in its dozen or so dialects, as is evinced in Charles Sacleux's monumental <span class="italic">Dictionnaire</span> (1939). With others Allen realized that if Swahili was to be truly effective within east Africa and beyond, then the language had to be standardized, and so standardization (based on the speech of Zanzibar town) became a part of his duties. During these years, alongside his editorial and research work for the Swahili Committee, he prepared for publication the <span class="italic">Diwani</span> (collected works; 14 volumes, 1967&#150;72) of the Tanga poet Shaaban Robert, with whom he had become friends. Also, from 1960, he edited <span class="italic">Johari za kiSwahili</span> (<span class="roman">Swahili Classics</span>), the purpose of the series being primarily to put the Swahili classics into the hands of Swahili readers.<br>
<br>Thanks to the generosity of the Rockefeller Foundation from 1965 to 1968 Allen became an honorary research fellow of Dar-es-Salaam University College. This involved the collection of manuscripts of literary, linguistic, and historical interest of the Swahili-speaking world. Of all the many Bantu languages only Swahili has its own pre-European literature. In the 1850s Ludwig Krapf had discovered the existence of Swahili literature, but he was not interested in collecting it. A few collections already existed before Allen, for example that of Sheikh Sir Mbarak Ali Hinawy in Mombasa. Allen's work was facilitated by the efforts of his wife, &#145;Winkie&#146;, who persuaded learned and cultured women along the Swahili coast to entrust to her care for copying their most highly valued manuscripts, many of which were hitherto unknown to scholarship. Also crucial to Allen's work was his friendship with scholarly Swahili families, such as Ahmad Sheikh Nabhany, his wife, Mwana Khadija, and his grandmother Mwana Amina. The material collected was mainly in Swahili, in Arabic script (until the mid-nineteenth century all Swahili was written in Arabic script). The resulting catalogue, <span class="italic">The Swahili and Arabic Manuscripts and Tapes in the Library of the University College Dar-es-Salaam</span> (1970) is, not unlike W. E. Taylor's <span class="italic">African Aphorisms</span> (1891) and H. E. Lambert's <span class="italic">Studies in Swahili Dialects</span> (1956&#150;8), an outstanding contribution to Swahili scholarship.<br>
<br>A genre which Allen pioneered was the translation of legal texts from and into Swahili, for example <span class="italic">Nikahi</span> (&#145;A handbook of the law of marriage in Islam&#146;, 1959) by Ali Hemedi al-Buhry. However, much of this work was done at the behest of official bodies in Dar-es-Salaam, and so appeared anonymously. <span class="italic">Tendi</span> (1971) was Allen's greatest work, consisting of six examples of a Swahili classical verse form known as <i>tendi</i> or <i>tenzi</i>. Allen argued that the Swahili verse tradition is as rigid and sophisticated as any in Europe. Because of the high price of this volume Allen arranged for five separate volumes to be published inexpensively, without the English translations (1972).<br>
<br>From 1970 the Allens taught Swahili at the Danish Volunteer Training Centre, Tengeru, near Arusha. In 1973 he returned to England where he died on 6 April 1979 of emphysema at his home at Halford, Old Marston, Oxford, and was buried at Marston.<br>
