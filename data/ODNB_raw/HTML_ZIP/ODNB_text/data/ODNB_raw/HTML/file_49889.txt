<span class="headword">Margulies,  Alexander</span>  (1902&#150;1991), <span class="occ">businessman and patron of the arts</span>, was born in Skalat, Galicia, on 1 July 1902, the son of Marcus Mordecai Margulies (1862&#150;1921) and his wife, Fanny, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Feige (1865&#150;1943). The Margulies were descendants of Rabbi Ephraim Zalman Margulies (1760&#150;1828), who was celebrated for his scholarship and wealth. When the First World War broke out the family took up residence in Germany, and it was from there that Alexander moved to Britain in 1931. In his new country Margulies displayed great business acumen, creating with his brother Benzion Margulies (1890&#150;1955) the firm Time Products, which incorporated clock movements, made overseas, into cases made in Britain. In 1939 the firm was the largest importer of horology, having factories in both China and Hong Kong. It became a public company in 1962, though Margulies continued as president after his retirement. With the coming of the Second World War he set up a factory to make aircraft components; its employees included refugee workers from twenty-five families whom he had helped to escape from Nazi Europe.<br>
<br>Like his wife, Stella, Margulies took a keen interest in art, of which he was an avid collector. He favoured, in particular, contemporary French sculptures and paintings and numbered among his friends the artists Derain, Modigliani, and Soutine. For much of his life, however, he was appalled by what he considered the lack of interest and poor financial support given to the arts by the Anglo-Jewish community. Following his appointment in 1965 as chairman of the Ben Uri Art Gallery in London, founded to support and publicize the work of Jewish artists (in which his brother was also involved), he did much to expand the specializations of the gallery to include not only painting and sculpture, but also orchestral and choral music, drama, and literature. When the gallery was obliged to sell one of its most outstanding paintings, <span class="italic">The Merry-Go-Round</span> by Mark Gertler, to ensure its survival, Margulies was widely criticized. He defended his action, however&#151;accusing the Jewish community for failing to provide the necessary financial support, and noting that he himself had donated thousands of pounds towards the gallery's maintenance and the purchase of contemporary works of art. He also gave a number of his paintings to the Tate Gallery in London and to the New Art Museum in Tel Aviv.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Margulies was a dedicated supporter of Zionism. At the twenty-third Zionist Congress in 1931 he was elected a member of the actions committee of the World Zionist Organization. He was president of the friends of the Anti-Tuberculosis League of Israel. He served at various times as honorary treasurer, vice-chairman, and president of the Mizrachi Federation and the Bachad Fellowship, and his tireless work on behalf of these organizations was recognized when, in 1983, the Alexander Margulies Youth Centre was opened in Temple Fortune, London. In addition he played a prominent part as one of the vice-presidents in the Joint Israel Appeal and was a powerful driving force in helping establish such centres of Jewish education as Carmel College (the only Jewish public school) and, in 1965, Hillel House, the purpose of which was to provide support for Jewish university students.<br>
<br>Firmly committed to Jewish Orthodoxy all his life, Margulies was a tireless supporter of Jewish culture. During the Second World War&#151;together with his brother Benzion, and with assistance from the distinguished Hebrew scholar Simon Rawidowicz&#151;he established the Ararat Publications Society, with himself as chairman; its purpose was to foster Hebrew literature and to encourage Jewish learning. An outstanding publication to be issued under the auspices of the society was the Hebrew quarterly <span class="italic">Metzudah</span>, the only European Hebrew magazine, its aim being to provide an outlet for Jewish scholarship on an international basis. Margulies also took a keen interest in the Institute for Jewish Studies, being its treasurer, and gave generous assistance to the <span class="italic">Jewish Quarterly</span>. A bust of him was made by Jacob Epstein.<br>
<br>Margulies died at his home, 4 Sidmouth Road, London, on 2 May 1991, survived by two sons and a daughter.<br>
