<span class="headword">Doubleday,  Edward</span>  (1810&#150;1849), <span class="occ">entomologist</span>, was born on 9 October 1810 at 62 High Street, Epping, Essex, the second son of Benjamin Doubleday (1771&#150;1848), grocer and provision merchant, and his wife, Mary (1779&#150;1846). He and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7847/', "Henry Doubleday (1808&#150;1875)")</script>, also a celebrated entomologist, were birthright Quakers who attended the local Friends' school, Isaac Payne's, and shared an enthusiasm for natural history. Doubleday received a good classical education, and possessing a romantic temperament dreamed of studying nature in the New World.<br>
<br>Doubleday contributed many articles and notes to scientific journals, notably the <span class="italic">Entomological Magazine</span>, some under the pseudonym &#916; (Delta). His plans to travel widely in North America were fulfilled in 1837 when, in the company of fellow Quaker and entomologist Robert Foster, he arrived in New York. During his trip he amassed a large collection of insects, mainly Lepidoptera and Coleoptera, but also some birds and animals, which he shipped back at intervals for the Entomological Club cabinet, the British Museum, and other institutions. He met many American naturalists and his letters to Edward Newman, nearly twenty of which were printed in the <span class="italic">Entomological Magazine</span>, gave fascinating accounts of his extensive travels. On his return the following year he was dissuaded from joining the ill-fated Niger expedition.<br>
<br>A genial companion and a brilliant scientific lepidopterist with a worldwide correspondence, Doubleday was appointed in 1841 assistant in the zoological department of the British Museum, where he built up a magnificent lepidopteran collection. He published about thirty scientific papers of entomological importance after his return from America (among the most notable being &#145;Remarks on Lepidoptera of North America&#146;, <span class="italic">Magazine of Natural History</span>, 1840, and &#145;Description of new or imperfectly described diurnal Lepidoptera&#146;, <span class="italic">Annals of Natural History</span>, 1845&#150;8). He enjoyed membership of many British and foreign scientific societies, including the Linnean (1843&#150;9), and the Entomological, of which he was a founder member (1833) and secretary for the last two years of his life. He was a vice-president of the Botanical Society. Appointed curator of the collections of the Entomological Club in 1843, he was noted for his extreme liberality to fellow entomologists, to the detriment, Newman commented ruefully, of the cabinets.<br>
<br>Doubleday's early death at the age of thirty-nine terminated the publication of his <span class="italic">List of Lepidopterous Insects in the British Museum</span> of which three parts only, covering the butterflies, were issued (1844, 1847, and appendix 1848). Also left uncompleted was his most ambitious work, the superb two-volume serial publication <span class="italic">The Genera of Diurnal Lepidoptera</span>, illustrated with coloured plates by W. C. Hewitson. Started in 1846 but interrupted by his ill health in 1848 and later by Hewitson's illness, the <span class="italic">Genera</span> was only half completed at the time of his death. Doubleday, who never married, died of spinal disease at his home in Harrington Square, Westminster, London, on 14 December 1849, a great loss to entomological science. He was buried in the Quaker burial-ground at Epping on 19 December. The <span class="italic">Genera</span> was finally completed by J. O. Westwood in 1852, and reissued in parts in 1857&#150;61.<br>
