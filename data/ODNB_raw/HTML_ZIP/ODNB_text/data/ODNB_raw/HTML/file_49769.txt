<span class="headword">Drummond,  George Henry Charles Francis Malcolm</span>, Viscount Forth  (1834&#150;1861), <span class="occ">dipsomaniac</span>, was born on 13 May 1834, in Naples, the only surviving child of George Drummond (1807&#150;1902), soldier, and his first wife, the Countess Rapp, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Baroness Albertine von Rothberg Rheinweiler Coligni, (<i>d</i>. 1842). In 1853 his father was restored as fifth earl of Perth and second earl of Melfort, but failed to recover the Drummond Castle estates from the Willoughby de Eresby family. From this date George Henry Drummond took the title Viscount Forth. He joined the 42nd highlanders in December 1853, and reached the Crimea on 14 September 1854. At the battle of the Alma (20 September) he carried the regimental colours. He served on trench and picket duty before requesting leave to sell out as soon as Sevastopol was taken. He then clashed with his commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel D. A. Cameron. By Forth's account, having not eaten for twenty-four hours, he refused to accompany a covering party until he had dined. Cameron, however, charged him with cowardice or insubordination. Forth resigned his commission on 17 October 1854. Detrimental versions of this incident circulated widely.<br>
<br>Forth married on 24 October 1855, at St Peter's Church, Pimlico, Harriet Mary (1836&#150;1868), daughter of the Hon. Adolphus Capel. They lived with her parents at Wroughton in Wiltshire, where Forth soon manifested delirium tremens. He was violent and abusive to his wife, and threatened to contract syphilis so as to infect her and their only child, a son (<i>b</i>. 1856). She separated from him in 1858, and in 1860 petitioned for divorce on the grounds of his cruelty and adultery. After the queen's proctor intervened (1861) to prevent her suit on the grounds of her adultery with Edward Cholmeley Dering, Sir Cresswell Cresswell ruled that a wife &#145;guilty of adultery&#146; could not petition for relief on account of cruelty  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 19 April 1861, 11d). Shortly afterwards Forth (who wished to avoid his creditors in London) settled at the Spa Hotel in Gloucester under the name of Captain Drummond, together with a woman who passed as his wife. She fell ill after delivering a daughter on 19 September 1861, and was devotedly nursed by Forth in a hotel room. Following her death on 8 October of that year he raved with grief, drank three-quarters of a pint of brandy, and swallowed a half bottle of laudanum, dying at the hotel from its effects after a few hours. A verdict of suicide was recorded. Forth was buried at Gloucester. The lives of his widow and son also ended miserably young.<br>
