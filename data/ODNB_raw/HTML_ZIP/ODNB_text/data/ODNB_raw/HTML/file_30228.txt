<span class="headword">Yonge,  John</span>  (1462/3&#150;1526), <span class="occ">bishop and college head</span>, was born at Newton Longville, Buckinghamshire. His father was a tenant of New College, Oxford, and it was there that John went, having attended the college's associated foundation at Winchester College, where he was admitted a scholar on 26 August 1474, aged eleven. In 1480 he went as a scholar to New College, where he graduated BA in 1484&#150;5, MA in 1489, and DTh in 1504. He was a full fellow from 1482 to 1502, and at various times held the offices of first and second bursar and of subwarden. Ordained acolyte on 24 September 1485 and subdeacon on 14 March 1489, he is not recorded as having become a priest, but still held a number of benefices, starting as vicar of Beckley, Oxfordshire, on 2 February 1499. Admitted rector of Birkby, Yorkshire, on 26 January 1503, he became rector of All Hallows, Honey Lane, London, but resigned the latter living on 30 October 1510. On 15 September 1509 he was nominated master of the London hospital of St Thomas of Acon, and by skilful management saved it from closure. He found the hospital over &pound;700 in debt, but during the eight years of his mastership he paid off the debt and spent more than &pound;1430 on repairs.<br>
<br>Yonge became a close associate of Bishop Richard Fitzjames of London. The two men were among those whom Edmund Dudley before his execution for treason in 1510 named as guardians of his son Jerome, and in 1513 Yonge became Fitzjames's suffragan, with the title of bishop of Gallipoli, under papal authorization issued on 15 April 1513 (at his consecration on 13 June he made his profession of obedience to the archbishop of Heraclea as his titular superior). He was licensed to remain master of St Thomas's, and subsequently secured a papal bull granting the right to appoint future masters to the Mercers' Company. He also obtained a bull (28 February 1515) empowering him to grant indulgences. On 28 March 1514 Yonge was also collated to the archdeaconry of London, and his responsibilities in London diocese grew thereafter as Fitzjames's health failed. In 1519 he was elected prior of the Augustinian house of Shulbred, Sussex, but resigned on 21 March 1521, having obtained a grant of land to the priory. About this time he became prebendary of Wightring in Chichester Cathedral.<br>
<br>Yonge had retained links with Oxford. In 1517 he and Fitzjames were invited by the university to assume responsibility for the codification of its statutes, and on 13 April 1521 he was elected warden of New College. This position he retained (along with his archdeaconry and Chichester prebend) for the rest of his life. In November 1524 he was admitted to the college's living of Colerne, Wiltshire. He died in Oxford on 28 March 1526 and was buried in New College chapel, where his brass survives (without its head), representing him in episcopal vestments with mitre and crozier. He gave the college a copy of St Augustine's works, published at Basel in 1506. Three Yonges from Newton Longville who were scholars and fellows of New College in the first thirty years of the sixteenth century were presumably his kinsmen.<br>
