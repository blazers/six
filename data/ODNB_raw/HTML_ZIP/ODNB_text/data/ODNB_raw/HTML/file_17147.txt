</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lucy,  Charles</span>  (1814&#150;1873), <span class="occ">history painter</span>, was born at Hereford. His parentage is unknown; and the information concerning his first thirty years is, at times, puzzling. He reputedly was apprenticed to his uncle, a chemist in Hereford; he preferred to embark on a career in art, left Hereford for Paris, and studied at the &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts under Paul Delaroche. After returning to England, he entered the Royal Academy Schools in London. Subsequently, according to the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> (July 1873), he executed commissions as a copyist in Paris and The Hague, returned briefly to London, and then took up residence in France at Barbizon, near Fontainebleau, for &#145;nearly sixteen years&#146;; dates are not given. Samuel Redgrave's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Artists of the English School</span> (1874) mentions no protracted sojourn in France. In 1838, &#145;then living at Hereford&#146;, according to Redgrave, Lucy exhibited a portrait at the Royal Academy. In 1840 he exhibited <span class="italic">The Interview between Milton and Galileo</span>; in 1844, <span class="italic">The Good Samaritan</span> and <span class="italic">Burns and his Mary</span>.<br>
<br>By 1844 or 1845 Lucy was probably married (he had at least one child, a son, Charles Hampden Lucy) and certainly in London, where he shared a studio with Ford Madox Brown. For the Fine Arts Commission's second competition (1844) he painted <span class="italic">The Roman empress Agrippina interceding with the emperor Claudius on behalf of the family of Caractacus</span>; he won a premium of &pound;100, but not appointment to prepare a design for one of six arched compartments in the House of Lords. When the commission reopened the competition in 1845, he submitted an unsuccessful cartoon of <span class="italic">Religion Supported by Faith, Hope, and Charity</span>. For the final competition (1847) he made a sketch, <span class="italic">The Burial of Charles I</span>, which was rejected, and a painting, <span class="italic">The departure of the &#145;primitive puritans&#146;, or &#145;Pilgrim Fathers&#146;, to the coast of America, <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 1620</span>, for which he received a premium of &pound;200. These subjects, two of the eight planned for the Peers' Corridor, were entrusted in 1853 to the history painter Charles West Cope; but seventeenth-century history continued to hold Lucy's interest.<br>
<br>Many of Lucy's paintings were engraved; few gained lasting notice. <span class="italic">Nelson Meditating in the Cabin of the &#145;Victory&#146; Previously to the Battle of Trafalgar</span> (exhibited in the Royal Academy in 1854), bought at auction in 1855 by Sir Robert Peel, reappeared in the sale of Peel heirlooms in 1900. <span class="italic">Cromwell and his Family Listening to Milton Playing the Organ at Hampton Court</span>, signed 1863, was presented in 1870 by William Graham, the Liberal MP, to the Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum. Eight portraits commissioned by the Liberal politician Sir Joshua Walmsley, completed in 1869, are now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. The subjects are Oliver Cromwell, Horatio Nelson, Joseph Hume, Richard Cobden, John Bright, Gladstone, Disraeli, and Giuseppe Garibaldi.<br>
<br>For some years, with health failing, Lucy taught at a drawing-school in Camden Town, London. He died on 19 May 1873 at 13 Ladbroke Crescent, Notting Hill, where he lived with his son. William Michael Rossetti (<span class="italic">Some Reminiscences</span>, 1906) remembered him as a friend of Madox Brown: &#145;He was a short man, of very ordinary appearance and address, more like a country estate-agent than an artist. He was married, friendly and accommodating in disposition&#146;.<br>
