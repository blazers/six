<span class="headword">Douglas, Lord  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1617&#150;1645), <span class="occ">army officer in the French service</span>, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7934/', "William Douglas, first marquess of Douglas and eleventh earl of Angus (1589&#150;1660)")</script>, and his first wife, Margaret Hamilton (1584/5&#150;1623), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12057/', "Claud Hamilton, first Lord Paisley")</script>. He was born during a three-year period when his father was travelling in Europe after his Catholicism had exposed him to criticism by presbyterian clergy in Scotland. One of his two older brothers, William, died in childhood and there is some suggestion that James may have assumed the Christian name William in consequence. His eldest brother, Archibald, predeceased his father in 1655 and the Angus earldom and Douglas marquessate were inherited by Archibald's son in 1660.<br>
<br>Lord James Douglas took the opportunity offered by the recruitment of Sir John Hepburn's regiment for service in France in 1633 to begin a military career, and by the time of Hepburn's death in 1636 had become first captain of the regiment. He was narrowly passed over for command in favour of Sir James Hepburn, who was himself killed in Lorraine in October 1637. Douglas had previously been favoured by Cardinal Richelieu for the regimental command on grounds of his Catholicism, and since James Hepburn died without a relative or designated successor in the regiment, Douglas's candidacy could be revived with success, the regiment subsequently being retitled Douglas. The appointment seems to have excited some tension among the established officers, however. In April 1638 a list of absentee captains from the regiment was publicized by the secretary of state for war, and concern was expressed that significant numbers of soldiers had deserted to other Scottish units. The shortfalls in officers and men led to disputes over appropriate levels of pay during the winter of 1638&#150;9, and the unit limped through the campaign of 1639 with little distinction. The regiment would probably have been formally disbanded had it not, by a royal <i>ordonnance</i> of 28 November 1636, acquired <i>entretenu</i> (maintained) status, a royal undertaking to keep the unit on a permanent footing.<br>
<br>In January 1640 Douglas was sent back to Scotland with 30,000 livres to levy 2000 men&#151;effectively a commission to raise the regiment again from scratch. This mission proved a failure and in July 1640 he was ordered to return the money that he had received for recruitment. The deepening crisis in Anglo-Scottish relations and Douglas's own Catholicism may well have contributed to this failure. The regiment remained in service in 1641 as a handful of <i>compagnies r&eacute;form&eacute;es</i> with the army of Marshal Ch&acirc;tillon, and once again Douglas was ordered to return to Scotland with some of his officers to carry out levies. Strongly supported by the French ambassador, Douglas had more success and in January 1642 disembarked at Dieppe with 2000 recruits. Confusion with his brother, George Douglas, has led to the erroneous assumption that James was appointed to the highest rank of <i>lieutenant-g&eacute;n&eacute;ral</i> in the French armies. In fact he served ably as colonel of his regiment in the campaigns from 1642 to 1645, but was not promoted above this rank, which George Douglas himself did not receive until 1677. On 21 October 1645 James Douglas was leading his regiment on the Flanders frontier and was killed in a small-scale combat between Douai and Arras. His corpse was taken to Paris and buried in the abbey of St Germain des Pr&eacute;s near the remains of his grandfather, William, tenth earl of Angus. His brother George ultimately succeeded him in command of the regiment, which was to suffer extremely heavy casualties at the battle of Lens in 1648.<br>
