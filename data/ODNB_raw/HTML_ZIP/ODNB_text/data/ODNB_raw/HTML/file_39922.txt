</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ashton, Sir  Frederick William Mallandaine</span>  (1904&#150;1988), <span class="occ">choreographer and director</span>, was born on 17 September 1904 in Guayaquil, Ecuador, the fourth of the five children of George Ashton (1864&#150;1924) and his second wife, Georgiana (1869&#150;1939), daughter of Henry Fulcher and his wife, Edith. His father was manager of the Central and South American Cable Company and vice-consul at the British embassy in Guayaquil. In 1907 the family moved to Lima, Peru, where Ashton went to the Dominican school of La Recoleta; from 1914, when his parents returned to Guayaquil, he attended the school established for children of the English colony. With a surrogate family, he grew up in a socially exciting life dominated by the seaside pleasures of the Pacific Ocean; and in 1917, seeing a performance by Anna Pavlova, he realized that he wanted to be a dancer.<br>
<br>Sent home to Dover College in England in 1919, Ashton was inevitably miserable in a British public-school environment&#151;as again when called up into the RAF during the Second World War. There were compensations, however, in school drama performances and London holidays with a full diet of plays and art exhibitions. In 1921 he was impressed by Isadora Duncan, to whom he paid later choreographic tribute (1976) with <span class="italic">Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan</span>. Influences from every early cultural experience, from Peruvian dance rhythms to theatre trends of the 1920s, can be traced in his professional career. While still at school he came to terms both with his own homosexuality and with a yearning for an ideal partner: &#145;I was very romantic &hellip; and had the Greek point of view about the Ideal One&#146;  (Kavanagh, 43).<br>
<br>Ashton's general academic backwardness meant that in 1921 his father, visiting Britain, decided he should go to work in London with an import-export firm where the fact that he was trilingual (speaking English, Spanish, and French) was an asset. In January 1924, however, he was faced with a family tragedy and a complete change of life. His father killed himself, leaving his widow financially dependent on her older sons, who ran a successful business, Casa Carlos Ashton, in Guayaquil. Mrs Ashton moved to London to be with Fred and his younger sister, Edith.<br>
<br>Ashton's never-forgotten determination to be a dancer now surfaced. He applied to L&eacute;onide Massine for a pupil's audition and, rather surprisingly given his age (twenty), he was taken on: in Britain, male dancers were sufficiently rare to be worth trying out. Ashton applied himself strenuously to ballet lessons, and when Massine left London, he was transferred to Marie Rambert, whose small ballet school was to become a fruitful nursery for British dancers and choreographers. Ashton began to make important contacts, and saw performances by the Diaghilev Ballet and other outstanding visiting artists. He made his own performing d&eacute;but on 10 April 1925, in a variety show at the Palace Pier, Brighton.<h2>
<a name="RambertandtheBalletClub"></a>Rambert and the Ballet Club</h2>Family problems again intervened. Casa Carlos Ashton failed dramatically, and Ashton and his mother became really impoverished. His lessons with Rambert, however, were free, and in 1926 he created his first little ballet, <span class="italic">The Tragedy of Fashion</span>, for her. He began to get work composing dances for operas, musicals, and plays. These included Purcell's <span class="italic">The Fairy Queen</span>, performed by the Purcell Opera Society (1927); a ballet, <span class="italic">Mars and Venus</span>, in the play <span class="italic">Jew S&uuml;ss</span>, which reached the Duke of York's Theatre in London (1929); dance arrangements in <span class="italic">A Masque of Poetry and Music</span> produced by George Rylands at the Arts Theatre Club (1930); and dances in a British film, <span class="italic">Dance Pretty Lady</span>, directed by Anthony Asquith (1932).<br>
<br>In 1928, with other aspiring male dancers of his generation, Ashton was a member of Ida Rubinstein's company in Paris, for which Bronislava Nijinska was choreographer. He had admired Nijinska's Diaghilev Ballet productions, and working with her was a never forgotten privilege. Perhaps the most notable act of his later artistic directorship of the Royal Ballet (1963&#150;70) was when he persuaded her to stage revivals of <span class="italic">Les biches</span> and <span class="italic">Les noces</span> at Covent Garden.<br>
<br>In 1930 Rambert occasionally presented her posse of promising dance talents at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, and there Ashton staged an innovative ballet, <span class="italic">Capriol Suite</span>, that stood up well to later revivals. The music was an unusual suite by the composer Peter Warlock based on sixteenth-century music quoted in Thoinot Arbeau's book <span class="italic">Orch&eacute;sographie</span>. Ashton's choreography drew on illustrations of dances of the period&#151;<i>basse danse</i>, pavane, <i>tordion</i>, and <i>bransle</i>&#151;smoothly mixing robust masculine leaps with courtly duets. During these Lyric Theatre seasons he met another of his idolized prima ballerinas, Tamara Karsavina. Ashton was much influenced by her: &#145;When she danced with us we watched her every movement, admired her discipline, her exquisite manners, her humanity and her approach to the public&#146;  (Vaughan, 41).<br>
<br>On 16 February 1931 Rambert, with the collaboration of her husband Ashley Dukes and the ballet critic Arnold Haskell, launched the Ballet Club at the tiny Mercury Theatre in Notting Hill Gate, with Alicia Markova as ballerina. Engaged by Diaghilev at fourteen, Markova had experienced a decline in her career after his death in 1929. Now, dancing for both the Ballet Club and Ninette de Valois's young Vic-Wells Ballet, she originated exquisite Rambert miniatures composed by Ashton and, at the Vic-Wells, had the chance to dance the great traditional ballerina roles.<br>
<br>Ashton was now Rambert's key choreographer, as well as a leading performer, and he partnered Markova in Michel Fokine's <span class="italic">Les sylphides</span> on the opening night. During the next few years his ballets for the Ballet Club included <span class="italic">La p&eacute;ri</span> (1931), <span class="italic">The Lady of Shalott</span> (1931), <span class="italic">Foyer de danse</span> (1932), and <span class="italic">Les masques</span> (1933). The first three were designed by a fellow dancer, William Chappell, the last by Sophie Fedorovich. These two designers remained closely associated with Ashton over the years, Fedorovich establishing herself as his finest design collaborator with such ballets as <span class="italic">Dante Sonata</span> (1940) and <span class="italic">Symphonic Variations</span> (1946). After her sudden death in 1953, Ashton inherited some &pound;35,000 from Fedorovich's estate (with which he bought Chandos Lodge in Eye, Suffolk).<h2>
<a name="Theearly1930s"></a>The early 1930s</h2>From 1930, along with most of the British ballet world, Ashton was connected with an influential organization called the Camargo Society. Comparable in aims with the well-established play-performing Stage Society, the Camargo presented occasional programmes in London over many months, launching new ballets, some of which were added to the repertory of the Ballet Club or the Vic-Wells Ballet. One of these, Ashton's <span class="italic">Fa&ccedil;ade</span>, to music by William Walton (1931), was adopted by both groups, and continues to amuse twenty-first-century audiences.<br>
<br>Other Ashton ballets for the Camargo drew on his enthusiasms for Latin American and jazz dance. <span class="italic">A Day in a Southern Port</span> (1931, later called <span class="italic">Rio Grande</span>), in a cast led by Lydia Lopokova and Markova, was danced to a score by Constant Lambert. As musical director and conductor to Sadler's Wells Ballet, Lambert became a close colleague of Ashton. <span class="italic">High Yellow</span> (1932) was a collaboration with Buddy Bradley, set to music by Spike Hughes. Ashton and Bradley had earlier worked on the musicals staged by Charles B. Cochran, and throughout the 1930s Ashton continued to make major contributions to revues and musicals. In this period it was only through West End theatre engagements that British dancers could survive financially, as both Rambert and de Valois were operating on the slenderest of shoestrings.<br>
<br>The Camargo was an important meeting place for choreographers, dancers, composers, designers, and writers; in the 1930s and 1940s the London artistic community was a close network of practitioners in all the arts and their keenly interested and informed patrons. Camargo programmes included not only music by Lambert, Walton, Vaughan Williams, and Arthur Bliss but designs by Vanessa Bell, Edward Burra, Duncan Grant, Gwen Raverat, and John Armstrong. Leading roles were taken by Lopokova, Markova, Ninette de Valois, Phyllis Bedells, Maude Lloyd, Anton Dolin, and Stanley Judson.<br>
<br>De Valois had already, in 1931, asked Ashton to set a comedy piece, <span class="italic">Regatta</span>, for the Vic-Wells Ballet (she danced the leading role), and in 1933 he composed another work for her company, the ballet-divertissement <span class="italic">Les rendezvous</span>. With Markova and the former Diaghilev dancer Stanislas Idzikowski as principals, and a Lambert-arranged score from music by D.-F.-E. Auber, Ashton created an enjoyably effervescent production that remains in the Royal Ballet repertory. De Valois, Judson, and the Vic-Wells's newly acquired young man from Australia, Robert Helpmann, sparkled in the pas de trois. As a result of the ballet's success, in 1935 Ashton became resident choreographer and dancer with the Vic-Wells Ballet, beginning his lifelong association with the company (which eventually became the Royal Ballet). Despite his homosexuality, Ashton in 1936&#150;7 had an affair with a rich American socialite, Alice von Hofmannsthal (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Astor). Alice had two subsequent marriages, but continued to love Ashton, and left him $2500 on her death in 1956.<br>
<br>Ashton was invited by the composer Virgil Thomson to work on a distinctive project in the USA. This was the opera <span class="italic">Four Saints in Three Acts</span> (with music by Thomson, libretto by Gertrude Stein), which reached New York on 20 February 1934. For the dance scenes in this he worked with black dancers, and drew substantially on Peruvian memories. He later described the choreography as &#145;not operatic but ritualistic and ordered, not balletic but ceremonial&#146;  (Vaughan, 100). He commented that it succeeded &#145;because I am devout and the Negroes are devout, and I am plastic and they are plastic&#146;  (ibid., 101). Although the mainstream of Ashton's career was in Britain, there were to be other transatlantic collaborations in the future. He created <span class="italic">Devil's Holiday</span> for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in 1939. For New York City Ballet there were <span class="italic">Illuminations</span> (a haunting realization in dance of Rimbaud's poems and Britten's music) in 1950 and <span class="italic">Picnic at Tintagel</span> in 1952.<h2>
<a name="TheVicWellsBallet"></a>The Vic-Wells Ballet</h2>When Ashton joined the Vic-Wells Ballet in September 1935 he joined a group of artists who remained lifelong friends and associates. William Chappell and Leslie Edwards had been Rambert dancers, as had Harold Turner. Helpmann had worked with him over <span class="italic">Les rendezvous</span>. De Valois and Lambert he had known with the Camargo. Without any great technical ability, as a leading dancer Ashton always made a mark in specific roles such as Pierrot in <span class="italic">Carnaval</span>, the Dago in <span class="italic">Fa&ccedil;ade</span>, or, much later, the meek Ugly Sister in <span class="italic">Cinderella</span>. As a choreographer he was everything de Valois (and British ballet) needed, and he was given ample opportunities to develop and strengthen his skills. In this he was fortunate, as also with the outstanding musical help and guidance he received from Constant Lambert. The policy adopted by de Valois resembled that of Rambert, and both derived from Diaghilev&#151;the creation of short ballets, each one based on a stylistic unity of dance, music, and design&#151;and this suited Ashton very well. His opening work at Sadler's Wells (1935) was a version of Stravinsky's <span class="italic">Le baiser de la f&eacute;e</span> (he had danced in Nijinska's ballet to that score), designed by Fedorovich, in which the beautiful Pearl Argyle (earlier with Rambert) was the Fairy, and a new little girl with a very special destiny, Margot Fonteyn, was the jilted Fianc&eacute;e.<br>
<br>De Valois had specifically asked Ashton to accept this casting. Markova, whose status at Sadler's Wells as prima ballerina had made possible the historic full productions of <span class="italic">Giselle</span>, <span class="italic">The Nutcracker</span>, and <span class="italic">Swan Lake</span>, was leaving. Foreseeing this, de Valois decided to develop the potential of the inexperienced Fonteyn, so her role in <span class="italic">Baiser</span> was followed in 1936 by the Woman in Balldress in Ashton's <span class="italic">Apparitions</span>. Helpmann had the central role of the Poet, thus inaugurating a highly compatible and greatly admired partnership that was of inestimable value to the company.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Apparitions</span>, exquisitely designed by Cecil Beaton and with an evocative Liszt score arranged by Lambert, reflected in its romantic beauty an important aspect of Ashton's taste. This same quality was seen at various times over the years in other works, particularly in the now much better known <span class="italic">Marguerite and Armand</span>, set for Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev in 1963. But in 1937, after Ashton had composed a stunning and durable ballet-divertissement in <span class="italic">Les patineurs</span>, another feature of his talent was represented by <span class="italic">A Wedding Bouquet</span>. Sophisticated wit was allied to a refreshing streak of fun. The original cast was perfection: the coy Bride of Mary Honer, the distraught Julia of Fonteyn, the splendidly tipsy Josephine of June Brae, and Helpmann's brilliantly delineated philandering Bridegroom, were all absolutely in tune with Gertrude Stein's idiosyncratic text and Lord Berners's flexible score.<br>
<br>The two years leading up to the Second World War were marked by one more notable work for the Vic-Wells: <span class="italic">Horoscope</span>. A fine Lambert score, coolly exquisite designs by Fedorovich, and limpid performances by Pamela May (as the Moon) and Fonteyn and Michael Somes (as the Young Man and the Young Woman) ensured its success.<h2>
<a name="Thewaryears"></a>The war years</h2>When war broke out in September 1939, Ashton had recently returned from the USA, where he had choreographed <span class="italic">Devil's Holiday</span> for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. He had not taken up a suggestion made by Richard Pleasant about working in New York for the newly launched Ballet Theatre, but now the offer was repeated in a letter that he never received. However, his deep sense of patriotism made it unlikely that he would have left Britain at that time. Remaining with Sadler's Wells Ballet (as it became known), he captured in <span class="italic">Dante Sonata</span> (1940) the deep feeling for a struggle between good and evil that characterized the national mood of the time. Lambert found the ideal music in Liszt's <span class="italic">Apr&egrave;s une lecture du Dante</span>, while Fedorovich's swirling scenic lines and her black and white costumes, inspired by John Flaxman's engravings illustrating Dante's <span class="italic">Inferno</span>, reflected the choreographic contrasts between the turbulence of the Children of Darkness (Helpmann and June Brae) and the poignant serenity of the Children of Light (Fonteyn, Somes, and May). In the final tableau Helpmann and Somes were separately lifted to create an image of two crucifixions, implying an eternal confrontation. In May that year Ashton and the company gained first-hand experience of war's perils&#151;they were appearing in the Netherlands at the time of the German invasion, and were able only with difficulty to return to Britain. The score, scenery, and costumes for <span class="italic">Horoscope</span> were lost; the ballet was never revived.<br>
<br>Ashton's next ballet, <span class="italic">The Wanderer</span> (1941), was a departure in style, more akin than any other of his works to Massine's symphonic ballets. Set to Schubert's fantasia in C major, it had stark and startling designs by Graham Sutherland in browns, blacks, and reds. Although portrayed through predominantly athletic and gymnastic dance, it also had a &#145;programme&#146; of the emotional development of a central male character (magnetically portrayed by Helpmann). Carefree youth, deep and tender physical love, a fascination with &#145;worldly glitter&#146; (Fonteyn in an almost circus-like characterization), doubts and depressions, were finalized into a resolution of all the elements. Ashton preferred happy endings; possibly Marguerite Gautier's demise was the only occasion on which he dealt with a balletic death.<br>
<br>Sadler's Wells Ballet (under de Valois's able direction) determinedly coped with the manifold changes caused to everyone in Britain by the war. The regular calling-up of men to the forces was something de Valois accepted without question, and Ashton's time came in June 1941. He did not have a hard war, however: as an RAF officer he worked on analysing aerial photographs and as an intelligence officer. He was also given special leave to choreograph a ballet. Based on a laborious scenario by Doris Langley-Moore from Spenser's <span class="italic">The Faerie Queene</span>, with a score by William Walton and designs by John Piper, <span class="italic">The Quest</span> never came properly to life, in spite of some episodes of quality choreography. More leave, in 1944, allowed Ashton to revive the nostalgic <span class="italic">Nocturne</span> (created in 1936). He was released from the RAF at the end of the war in Europe in 1945.<h2>
<a name="CoventGarden19461963"></a>Covent Garden, 1946&#150;1963</h2>Glory years were to follow. From 1946 to the end of his life, Ashton found his position (in spite of a number of poorish creations) securely established as Britain's finest choreographer. His innate sense of insecurity, however, meant that he needed constant reassurance and praise from fellow artists, from critics, from the public, and from his friends and lovers. This trait, and the extreme jealousy and bitterness resulting from it, were disastrous flaws in his personal character; but they in no way lessen his supremacy as a choreographer.<br>
<br>Sadler's Wells Ballet moved to the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in February 1946, and in April Ashton's new work was a masterpiece. <span class="italic">Symphonic Variations</span>, to music by Franck and with lucent designs by Fedorovich, was a superb balletic reflection of the score, danced with breathtaking perfection by six dancers led by Fonteyn and Somes. An elaborate early working plan, involving a scenario about a symbolic marriage between woman as winter and man as summer, was fortunately abandoned. After <span class="italic">Symphonic Variations</span>, and another connoisseur's joy, <span class="italic">Sc&egrave;nes de ballet</span> (1948), however, Ashton's output was for years distinctly uneven. In the 1950s he spent a good deal of time outside Sadler's Wells Ballet, choreographing for the Ballets de Paris, the New York City Ballet, and the Royal Danish Ballet and working on dances for the film <span class="italic">The Tales of Hoffmann</span> (1951). He also directed operas at Covent Garden (Massenet's <span class="italic">Manon</span>, Britten's <span class="italic">Albert Herring</span>, and Gluck's <span class="italic">Orpheus</span> with Kathleen Ferrier).<br>
<br>Urged by de Valois, Ashton tackled his first full evening ballet, <span class="italic">Cinderella</span>, to the Prokofiev score, in 1948. The production was (and remains) full of weaknesses, apart from some fine passages of dance (the masque of the seasons, Cinderella's solos, and the act <span class="smallcap">II</span> pas de deux). It was also embellished by the largely improvised (and later established) comedy of the bullying and meek sisters as devised for Helpmann and Ashton himself. <span class="italic">Sylvia</span> (1952), the next three-act ballet, worked even less well, but with <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, staged for the Royal Danish Ballet in 1955, Ashton was more in command of the length. Revived, and slightly revised, in 1985 for English National Ballet, it is one of the most rewarding of the many versions of the Prokofiev score. <span class="italic">Ondine</span> (1958), to music by Hans Werner Henze, succeeded because it was a superb vehicle for the mature Fonteyn. Of his one-act ballets of the 1950s the most lasting (created for Fonteyn and Somes) were <span class="italic">Daphnis and Chloe</span> (1951) and <span class="italic">Birthday Offering</span> (1956). <span class="italic">Tiresias</span> (1951) failed because its composer, Lambert, near the end of his life, was unable to edit and orchestrate a score from which Ashton drew little inspiration.<br>
<br>However, in 1960 came another masterpiece, of a very different kind from <span class="italic">Symphonic Variations</span>. <span class="italic">La fille mal gard&eacute;e</span> goes far back in ballet history: it was first created by Jean Dauberval in Bordeaux in 1789. In 1960 Ashton used a score arranged by John Lanchbery from music by Ferdinand H&eacute;rold and others. He adhered closely to the original scenario, but created deliciously inventive new choreography that was the happiest amalgam of classical ballet and English folk-dance, while Osbert Lancaster's delightful designs were firmly related to French country life. Joyous and technically secure performances came from Nadia Nerina and David Blair, and there were fine character studies by Stanley Holden (Widow Simone) and Alexander Grant (Alain). The pleasures of <span class="italic">Fille</span> are many. Each act has dance highlights couched in terms of pure classical technique which at the same time cleverly express character and situation; folk-dance is naturally introduced for stick or maypole ensembles, while pleasurable mime keeps the narrative line flowing without interruption.<br>
<br>In Ashton's personal life, the two decades after the war were full of intense emotional experiences&#151;and the ups and downs of love affairs and bitter hatreds undoubtedly influenced his creativity and choreographic output. In these years he had a series of discreet attachments to younger men, including the dancers Brian Shaw and Alexander Grant and an American admirer, Tony Lizzut. A friend later described how &#145;his emotional life ate him up but it all went into the work&#146;  (Kavanagh, 317).<br>
<br>From 1965, however, Ashton had a more established partner. This was Martyn Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1985), a 23-year-old interior decorator. Despite having &#145;something of the cad about him&#146;, for Ashton, Thomas was &#145;a lifeforce whose influence in the final phase of his career proved as intoxicating and rejuvenating as Nureyev's had been for Fonteyn&#146;  (Kavanagh, 489).<h2>
<a name="Laterworks"></a>Later works</h2>If Ashton were to be remembered by only two ballets, they would undoubtedly be <span class="italic">Symphonic Variations</span> and <span class="italic">La fille mal gard&eacute;e</span>. However, during the 1960s other charming works followed. There were <span class="italic">The Two Pigeons</span> (1961), for Lynn Seymour and Christopher Gable, and <span class="italic">The Dream</span> (1964) (another delight in its choreographic diversity and mastery of comedy), for Anthony Dowell and Antoinette Sibley. In 1965 there was the elegant pas de trois <span class="italic">Monotones II</span>. In 1968 he produced a popular success in <span class="italic">Jazz Calendar</span>; and later the same year came one of his greatest ballets, <span class="italic">Enigma Variations (My Friends Pictured Within)</span>, which was quintessential Ashton in its realization.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Enigma Variations</span>, an interpretation in dance of Sir Edward Elgar's life, set to his work of this name, grew out of a project conceived many years before by a student of the Royal College of Art, Julia Trevelyan Oman, and taken up by Ashton in 1966. For a composite scene, and with detailed designs that would have swamped any lesser choreographer, he set out to compose dances of such subtlety and beauty that every element fell into place. Individualities became clear&#151;Dorabella's slight stammer was translated into exquisite hesitancies of pointe work by Antoinette Sibley, and Troyte's tempestuous pace was magnificently caught in the brilliant high-speed solo, first performed by Anthony Dowell. Ashton was also an expert at &#145;conversational&#146; dance&#151;choreographed movement that catches the mood of a conversation&#151;and the roles of Elgar, his wife, and his friend and publisher, A. J. Jaeger, are built up in this way. This ballet, in its artistic daring and its deep appreciation of the English character, could have been created by no one but Ashton.<br>
<br>In 1963 Ashton's career was enlarged by his appointment to follow de Valois as artistic director of what was now the Royal Ballet. He was the obvious choice, although it was perhaps not what he had wanted. De Valois carefully ensured that he had good back-up from John Hart and Somes on the administrative side and John Field as artistic director of the touring company, and these arrangements worked well during the seven years of Ashton's directorship. The Covent Garden company maintained its international reputation for fine &#145;home-grown&#146; dancers and a memorable repertory. The touring company built up a strong and attractive identity of its own. At Covent Garden, as well as his own new productions, Ashton brought in not only the Nijinska ballets but Nureyev's staging of the &#145;shades&#146; scene from <span class="italic">La bayad&egrave;re</span>.<h2>
<a name="Choreographicstyle"></a>Choreographic style</h2>The basis of Ashton's choreographic style was supplied by his varied background. Strongly classical in foundation, leaning towards the lyrical mood of Fokine's <span class="italic">Dying Swan</span> (for Pavlova) and <span class="italic">Le spectre de la rose</span> (for Karsavina and Nijinsky), it was augmented by many new ideas from the Diaghilev choreographers Massine, Nijinsky, and Nijinska; it adopted fluent non-classical elements from Isadora Duncan and other contemporary free-dance artists; it incorporated Latin-American dance ideas from his South American upbringing; and it included a clever sense of comedy that was very much his own. The final amalgam contrived to be essentially English&#151;as always, a state of the art difficult to analyse or pinpoint but nevertheless unmistakable.<br>
<br>Ashton's <i>&#339;uvre</i> can be divided up into categories: highly romantic (<span class="italic">Apparitions</span> and <span class="italic">Marguerite and Armand</span>); plotless classical (<span class="italic">Symphonic Variations</span> and <span class="italic">Sc&egrave;nes de ballet</span>); contrasted comedies (<span class="italic">La fille mal gard&eacute;e</span> and <span class="italic">A Wedding Bouquet</span>); <i>pi&egrave;ces d'occasion</i> (<span class="italic">Birthday Offering</span> and <span class="italic">Rhapsody</span>); and ballet-divertissements (<span class="italic">Les patineurs</span> and <span class="italic">Les rendezvous</span>). Inevitably there were failures and semi-successes over the years, but all his works related to, and drew sustenance from, their musical scores. Sensitivity to music, indeed, was the mainspring of his choreography, and his translations of a wide range of composers (from Satie and Stravinsky to Elgar and Britten) were rich in fresh and varied ideas.<br>
<br>Equally outstanding was Ashton's flair for creating roles that reflected the abilities of dancers. He was never at a loss in perceiving and exploiting natural strengths, whether of physique and technical endowment or of emotional and histrionic interpretation. Even small solos, such as the four &#145;season&#146; variations in <span class="italic">Cinderella</span>, perfectly matched the originating cast. Time and again, he revealed the essence of dancers, to themselves and to their audiences, with extraordinary perception.<br>
<br>Fonteyn certainly was an inspiration to Ashton, as she developed from the teenage soloist to the universally acclaimed prima ballerina, and without the ballets he created for her much of her genius would have remained unexplored. But he was generous to many others. For Markova he created Rambert ballets such as <span class="italic">Les masques</span> and Vic-Wells ballets such as <span class="italic">Les rendezvous</span>. For Nadia Nerina he set <span class="italic">La fille mal gard&eacute;e</span>. For Antoinette Sibley and Anthony Dowell there was <span class="italic">The Dream</span>. For Lynn Seymour there was <span class="italic">A Month in the Country</span>. For Harold Turner there was <span class="italic">Les patineurs</span>. For Helpmann, the most versatile of his interpreters, the creations ranged from the witty Bridegroom of <span class="italic">A Wedding Bouquet</span> through the passionate turmoil of <span class="italic">Dante Sonata</span> to the unforgettable comedy of the dominant Ugly Sister in <span class="italic">Cinderella</span>.<h2>
<a name="Retirementandafter"></a>Retirement and after</h2>In 1970, against his will, it was arranged for Ashton to retire, the post of artistic director of the Royal Ballet having already been offered to Kenneth MacMillan. Old friends and colleagues arranged a farewell gala that has never been equalled for its high professional standard and style. A selection adeptly made by Michael Somes, John Hart, and Leslie Edwards from Ashton's choreographic career, smoothly produced and admirably danced, was accompanied by a narration eloquently written by William Chappell and brilliantly spoken on stage by Robert Helpmann.<br>
<br>Ashton worked in 1970 on the film <span class="italic">Tales of Beatrix Potter</span> (released in 1971), a lovingly crafted tribute to that author's best-known books. Here again, English countryside and English values (English, as distinct from British) were handled with affection. He himself was glimpsed, briefly, as Mrs Tiggy-Winkle, and among the smooth course of the scenes the most memorable episodes were those of Jemima Puddleduck, Jeremy Fisher, and the Two Bad Mice. A posthumous transfer of the ballet to the stage has proved popular, but has little of the film's special charm.<br>
<br>Creatively speaking, lean years set in after Ashton's undesired retirement. His only major ballet, in 1976, was <span class="italic">A Month in the Country</span>, designed by Trevelyan Oman and set to a Chopin score arranged by John Lanchbery, conductor of the Royal Ballet. Created by Lynn Seymour as Natalia Petrovna and Anthony Dowell as Beliaev, it was as striking for the minor roles as the major ones. Ashton's diversity and ingenuity were apparent, for instance, in an allegro pas de quatre for Seymour, Dowell, Wayne Sleep as Kolia, and Denise Nunn as Vera, in which each character was acutely revealed. After 1976 only slight (but clearly Ashton-stamped) <i>pi&egrave;ces d'occasion</i> appeared apart from <span class="italic">Rhapsody</span>, created for the eightieth birthday of Queen Elizabeth, the queen mother, in 1980. A pure dance work to Rachmaninov's <span class="italic">Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini</span>, this was a vehicle for the virtuoso Mikhail Baryshnikov, although there was a delicate and difficult female leading role for Lesley Collier. An outrageously over-the-top comedy, <span class="italic">Varii capricci</span>, was choreographed in haste for the Royal Ballet's New York season in 1983, but Ashton's final short work, created for the Royal Ballet School to dance, was a true expression of the man. Personally devoted to the queen mother and her daughters Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret, Ashton linked Elgar's <span class="italic">Nursery Suite</span> (dedicated to the two young princesses in 1930) with a memory of his own. He had seen, from the top of a London bus, these two little girls at play in their Piccadilly garden; now, to celebrate Queen Elizabeth's sixtieth birthday in April 1986, he depicted with a lifetime's choreographic mastery the mood of the 1930s as well as the royal sisters' different characters and potential, in subtly chosen movements.<br>
<br>In November 1985 Ashton's partner, Martyn Thomas, was killed in a car crash. It was a tragedy from which Ashton found it hard to recover. Thereafter he looked &#145;permanently tired, very small and dishevelled&#146;  (Kavanagh, 590). He died in his sleep on 19 August 1988, in his much loved country home, Chandos Lodge, and was buried on 24 August at St Mary's Church, Yaxley, Suffolk. An impressive service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey followed three months later. A moving tribute came by letter from Fonteyn in Panama, describing &#145;his extraordinary understanding of the human heart and mind and his ability to illuminate them through his own art form&#146;  (ibid., 598). In his will Ashton left legacies and the royalties from particular ballets to the dancers with whom he had worked closely.<br>
<br>In his lifetime, Ashton was far from being a prophet without honour in his own country. He was knighted in 1962, became a Companion of Honour in 1970, and was appointed to the Order of Merit in 1977. France appointed him to the L&eacute;gion d'honneur (1960) and Denmark to the order of Dannebrog (1964). He received honorary doctorates of music from both Oxford and London universities. Back in 1959, when the Royal Academy of Dancing gave him their Queen Elizabeth II coronation award, he told them it was &#145;the first award I have ever received in my life&#146;, and ended his speech with thanks to &#145;the legions of dancers who have been through my hands and who, to use a medical term, have had to submit to my manipulative choreography&#146;  (Vaughan, 18). &#145;Manipulative choreography&#146; was a neat phrase. Ashton indeed manipulated dancers of every level to the greater glory of British ballet.<br>
