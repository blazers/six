<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Shebbeare,  John</span>  (1709&#150;1788), <span class="occ">physician and political writer</span>, was the eldest son of an attorney and corn-factor of Bideford, Devon. Unfortunately very little is known of his family history, parents, and early career, although the Shebbeares had once been modest landowners in the south of the county.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlywriting"></a>Education and early writing</h2>Shebbeare was educated at the free school at Exeter under the tuition of Zachariah Mudge, and at fifteen or sixteen he was apprenticed to an Exeter surgeon. Shebbeare's father died soon after, leaving the family in very poor circumstances. Friends assisted his mother in maintaining the corn-factoring business for some time, but it failed, and she was removed to the king's bench prison, where she died. During his apprenticeship, Shebbeare specialized in obstetrics and developed a keen interest in chemistry, but perhaps because of financial necessity he did not wait to take a medical degree before attempting to establish a practice of his own, probably in Exeter. Shebbeare was married young, possibly in 1733, to a woman of a genteel background but with little fortune. They had three children, a boy and two girls. His wife, whose name is unknown, died on 25 November 1779. Shebbeare inherited little from his father, and his medical practice did not prosper. It was reported that Shebbeare's declining fortune was caused by the alienation of his former master and of many of the citizens, corporation, and magistrates of Exeter, who were the victims of his vindictive temper and predilection for literary satire, and by futile alchemical experiments.<br>
<br>In 1736 Shebbeare moved to Bristol and went into partnership with a chemist. Virtually nothing is known of his life in Bristol, although he probably attempted to continue with his medical career or worked as an apothecary. In 1740 he printed a treatise upon the medicinal properties of the Bristol waters. It was during this period that Shebbeare's close involvement in politics began, and the forging of connections with the tory-patriots of the city is suggested by the publication of an epitaph on the Bristol MP Thomas Coster, who died in 1739. It appears that Shebbeare moved to London about 1750, and briefly visited Paris during 1752, where he claimed to have earned a medical degree and to have been elected to the French Academy of Sciences.<br>
<br>Shebbeare's career as a writer commenced with a work inspired by the passage of the <span class="roman">Marriage Act</span> in 1753. The legislation, promoted by the whig lord chancellor, the earl of Hardwicke, had been drafted to prevent clandestine marriages by requiring that persons below the legal age of consent obtain the permission of their parents or legal guardians before marrying. In 1754 Shebbeare published <span class="italic">The Marriage Act</span>, a novel which inveighed against Hardwicke's reforms by dramatizing their pernicious impact upon the lives of aspiring young lovers whose passions had been sanctioned by God but were frustrated by tyrannical, acquisitive parents, guardians, and their legal minions, who coerced them into marrying for the social and financial aggrandizement of their families. In condemning the moral and social consequences of the act, Shebbeare also accused the whig ministry of blatantly espousing the class interests of the &eacute;lite in attempting to prohibit marriages between members of unequal social stations. The ministry was angered by Shebbeare's criticism, and several days after the novel's appearance he was arrested for the aspersions he had cast upon parliament. Shebbeare was released soon after, upon condition that he appear before the courts at certain intervals as a guarantee of future good behaviour.<br>
<br>In 1755 Shebbeare published a second novel, <span class="italic">Lydia</span>, a sentimental tale of the sufferings of a virtuous young woman who endures poverty and persecution before marrying her lover and retiring to a life of piety and philanthropy. The novel is perhaps most memorable for its depiction of an Iroquois chief, who travels from New York to London to discover whether the inhabitants of England are as degenerate as the British American colonists who oppress his people. Shebbeare's Cannassatego, the courageous, honourable warrior-chief, reflects the era's fascination with romantic primitivism and represents one of the most positive portrayals of the native North American in eighteenth-century fiction. Although it is not a political novel, hostility towards the whig administration emerges throughout the narrative, most clearly in the figure of Cannassatego, an ostensibly objective observer, whose bitter disillusionment with the selfish materialism and political venality of Hanoverian England echoes the views of his creator. The composition of <span class="italic">Lydia</span> coincided with the escalation of territorial conflict between Britain and France in North America during 1754&#150;5, and Shebbeare employed the novel to denounce the prime minister, the duke of Newcastle, for failing to defend British imperial interests from French aggression.<h2>
<a name="Civicsatirist"></a>Civic satirist</h2>Shebbeare's growing engagement with politics during the 1750s was emphasized by a work of social and political satire also published in 1755. <span class="italic">Letters on the English Nation</span> was an epistolary fiction allegedly written by an Anglicized Italian Jesuit, whose long residence in England and analytical nature had endowed him with the insight and neutrality to develop a sweeping analysis of the decline of the English constitution, morals, manners, and culture under the corrupt rule of the whigs. The selection of a Jesuit as a narrative persona encouraged allegations that Shebbeare was a Jacobite at heart, prompting the whig antiquary Thomas Birch to revile the <span class="italic">Letters</span> as &#145;a Book, which an Englishman and a Protestant must detest&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 35398, fol. 255).<br>
<br>As the international crisis of 1755&#150;6 developed into war between Britain and France, Shebbeare's political commitment increased, inspiring the composition of a series of pamphlets condemning the Newcastle ministry's management of the conflict, beginning with <span class="italic">A Letter to the People of England</span>, published in the autumn of 1755. Shebbeare accused the ministry of sacrificing British maritime and colonial interests in North America by slavishly pandering to the Hanoverian partialities of George II. He developed this theme in his later <span class="italic">Letters</span>, reinforcing his charges with a historical survey stretching back to the reign of William III to illustrate the damage inflicted upon Britain by the predilection of alien monarchs for their homelands. Moreover, Shebbeare charged that the whigs had connived in the bloody, expensive continental wars of William III and George II as a means of establishing their grasp upon political power.<br>
<br>Admiral John Byng's failure to save the Mediterranean island of Minorca from capture by the French in July 1756 precipitated an intense political controversy over the responsibility for the defeat. Shebbeare's <span class="italic">Fourth Letter</span>, published in August, formulated a scathing review of the Newcastle administration's European diplomacy and conduct of the war in North America, and blamed the loss of Minorca upon the neglect and incompetence of the ministers. Shebbeare may also have written several pamphlets in defence of Byng, denouncing the ministry for attempting to conceal its blunders by scapegoating the admiral.<br>
<br>Shebbeare's political journalism received stinging criticism from the era's leading literary reviewers, who disapproved of the violence of his anti-ministerial attacks. Shebbeare's feud with Ralph Griffiths, the editor of the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, had begun in 1755, when Griffiths printed a critical account of a treatise Shebbeare had written describing the discoveries of his years of medical research. The article dismissed Shebbeare's study for its arrogance, plagiarism, and ignorance, and openly questioned his claim to a medical degree. Of a combative temper and sensitive to any criticism, Shebbeare had retaliated by satirizing Griffiths in <span class="italic">Lydia</span>, and the quarrel continued with the <span class="italic">Monthly</span>'s censure of the <span class="italic">Letters</span>. In commenting upon Shebbeare's pamphlets, Tobias Smollett, the editor of the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span>, was especially incensed by what he saw as their author's irresponsible fomenting of mob violence and civil dissension for pecuniary motives at a time when all Britons should unite against the common enemy. He denounced Shebbeare as a desperate incendiary without principles, talent, or common discretion. Shebbeare replied to his new adversary in May 1757 with <span class="italic">The Occasional Critic</span>, containing virulent abuse of Smollett's character and writings. The clash between the two authors degenerated into one of the eighteenth century's most bitter and brutally fought literary quarrels. Shebbeare was caricatured by Smollett in the novel <span class="italic">Sir Lancelot Greaves</span> (1760) as the misanthropic Ferret, an unscrupulous, self-serving political agitator and quack doctor who represents one of the most memorable minor characters in Smollett's fiction.<h2>
<a name="Thepilloryandimprisonment"></a>The pillory and imprisonment</h2>Shebbeare published a <span class="italic">Sixth Letter</span> in late 1757. It comprised one of his most blatant and extreme expressions of the malignant effects of the Hanoverian succession. Its notorious motto, alluding to the white horse of the Hanoverian coat of arms, was taken from <span class="roman">Revelation</span> 6:8, &#145;And I looked, and beheld a pale Horse: and his name that sat upon him was Death, and Hell followed him&#146;. In 1756&#150;7 the vulnerability of Hanover to French attacks had compelled the government to establish an alliance with Prussia and to finance the formation of an army for its defence. Now the ministry feared that Shebbeare's anti-Hanoverianism would increase the unpopularity of such controversial measures. Eager to stifle Shebbeare's persistent criticism, the ministry issued a general warrant for his arrest in January 1758. Shebbeare was taken into custody, and a seventh letter, which was being prepared for publication, was suppressed. Shebbeare was tried before the court of king's bench, and on 17 June 1758 he was convicted of seditious libel. The chief justice, Lord Mansfield, presided over the trial and, in interpreting the laws governing the press, ruled that satires upon dead kings were libellous. Mansfield's severe judgment offended many advocates of the liberty of the press, and prompted Horace Walpole's condemnation that it amounted to the censorship of history. On 28 November, Shebbeare was sentenced to pay a &pound;5 fine, to serve a term of three years' imprisonment, to provide securities of good behaviour for seven years amounting to &pound;1000, and to stand in the pillory at Charing Cross. The defiance Shebbeare exhibited during the execution of the last part of his punishment, aided and abetted by a tory political ally, the under-sheriff of Middlesex, Arthur Beardmore, provoked a political scandal. Shebbeare's allies had distributed a handbill around London &#145;inviting the friends of the liberty of the press, and of Old England &hellip; to see the British champion&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 3.40). Shebbeare drove into Charing Cross on 5 December 1758 not in a prisoner's cart but in an elegant coach, and was greeted with three cheers by a large crowd of spectators. Rather than submit to the indignity of having his head, arms, and legs confined within the pillory, Shebbeare stood at his ease, while an Irish chairman held an umbrella over his head to shield him from the sun. Occasionally, when tired, he put his hands upon the holes of the pillory in order to rest.<br>
<br>William Hogarth recorded the disapproval of many contemporaries towards the extravagant virulence of Shebbeare's political polemic, his twisting of the facts, and the inflammatory nature of his rhetoric. In <span class="italic">The Polling</span> (1758), the third plate of Hogarth's <span class="roman">Election</span> series, Shebbeare, in leg irons, is depicted whispering seditious nonsense into the ear of an idiot, who is being sworn in as a voter. Shebbeare's enemies poured scorn upon his pretensions to political popularity and his attempt to transform the disgrace of his pillorying into a triumph. In <span class="italic">The Author</span> (1763) the whig poet Charles Churchill wrote:<blockquote>
<div>Where is SHEBBEARE? O, let not foul reproach,<br>
</div>
<div>Travelling thither in a City-Coach,<br>
</div>
<div>The Pill'ry dare to name; the whole intent<br>
</div>
<div>Of that Parade was Fame, not Punishment,<br>
</div>
<div>And that old, staunch Whig BEARDMORE standing by,<br>
</div>
<div>Can in full Court give the report the lye.<br>
</div> (p. 15)</blockquote>Shebbeare served the full term of his sentence, and the financial strain it caused inflicted considerable hardship upon his family. He fell into debt and felt deserted by his political allies. At one time he became seriously ill. Shebbeare felt particularly resentful towards William Pitt, whom he had eulogized in <span class="italic">The Third Letter</span> for his patriotic opposition to Newcastle's diplomatic efforts to secure the safety of Hanover during 1755&#150;6. Pitt was in coalition with Newcastle when Shebbeare was prosecuted, and the doctor blamed Pitt for failing to shield him from punishment despite having, as he claimed, &#145;contributed not a little towards creating the popularity, and thereby to the elevation of Lord Chatham to the seat of prime minister&#146;  (Shebbeare, 36). Shebbeare's difficult term in the king's bench cannot have been improved by the arrival of his adversary Smollett in 1760, who was himself imprisoned for libel.<h2>
<a name="LaterwritingandsupportforGeorgeIII"></a>Later writing and support for George III</h2>While in prison Shebbeare continued to support himself by his writings. He accepted subscriptions for an ambitious but unpublished history of England. He appears to have been the author of several pamphlets in defence of Lord George Sackville, who was accused of cowardice for his behaviour during the battle of Minden in 1759. Shebbeare continued to follow politics and the progress of the war closely, and after his disillusionment with Pitt he became a supporter of the prince of Wales, later George III, and Lord Bute, who shared his opposition to British participation in the German war and advocacy of peace. During this time Shebbeare worked upon the composition of his most elaborate work, an allegorical history of Britain since the revolution of 1688, documenting the subversion of the constitution and the decadence of English society and culture under the tyranny of William III, the Hanoverians, and the whigs. <span class="italic">The History of the Sumatrans</span>, first published in 1760, concluded with a glowing panegyric upon George III and Bute, who were celebrated for restoring their people's political rights and liberties. True religion, moral virtue, artistic excellence, and economic prosperity are nourished by the beneficent reign of the young king and his adviser. Shebbeare's support was appreciated by the court, and he was rewarded with a pension of &pound;200 in 1764 when the tory Sir John Philips applied to George III upon his behalf. When granting the request, it was reported that the king &#145;was pleased to speak of him in very favourable terms&#146;  (<span class="italic">European Magazine</span>, 13.87). From that time, Shebbeare distinguished himself as a loyal and energetic supporter of George III and his ministers in pamphlets and newspaper articles, replying to John Wilkes and defending Lord North's American policy from the criticisms of Edmund Burke. One of Shebbeare's most significant later social and political works, <span class="italic">An Essay on the Origin, Progress, and Establishment of National Society</span> (1776), was a reply to the writings of the nonconformist minister Richard Price, who supported the cause of the American revolutionaries.<br>
<br>Shebbeare's political and literary opponents sneered at his support for the court and his acceptance of a pension, denouncing him as an opportunistic hypocrite. The poet William Mason ridiculed him in <span class="italic">An Epistle to Dr. Shebbeare</span> (1777) as:<blockquote>
<div>The same abusive, base, abandon'd thing,<br>
</div>
<div>When pilloried, or pension'd by a king<br>
</div> (p. 9)</blockquote>Samuel Johnson was also offered a pension by George III, and the two tory writers' names were joined together by the ministry's whig opponents in parliament. It was claimed that the administration had pensioned a He-bear and a She-bear. The boast, perhaps apocryphal, that he had embarked upon his career as a political journalist vowing &#145;to write himself into a place or the pillory&#146; was frequently attributed to Shebbeare  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 3.39). His support for George III, however, the patriot-king who proudly proclaimed himself to be a Briton and the son of a Briton, was consistent with the tory-patriot political ideology he had expounded throughout his life. Although Shebbeare took advantage of the new reign to press his case for preferment, in accepting it he did not compromise his political principles.<h2>
<a name="Characterandreputation"></a>Character and reputation</h2>Unfortunately for Shebbeare, assessments of his character, writings, and political opinions were transmitted to posterity primarily by his literary and political enemies. The fact that he appears to have made few friends emerges as a telling commentary. It has been suggested that Smollett later relented in his hostility towards Shebbeare, but this seems unlikely. The evidence appears to lie in a seemingly sympathetic account of Shebbeare's prosecution and imprisonment for the <span class="italic">Sixth Letter</span> in an edition of Smollett's <span class="italic">History of England</span>. The inconsistency most probably was caused by the corruption of the text, and should not be taken as an indication of a change of heart on the part of its author. The passage should also not be taken out of context, in which Shebbeare's punishment is employed by the tory Smollett as an example of the severity and arbitrary nature of whig justice.<br>
<br>One biographer who knew Shebbeare personally warned against the danger of judging his character from the tone of his political writings, praising him as a son, brother, husband, and father; but even he confesses that Shebbeare was quick-tempered, stubborn, immoderate, and intolerant of others' opinions. Shebbeare's marriage was apparently an unhappy one. The novelist Fanny Burney, who met Shebbeare in 1774, recorded him as declaring &#145;I think I have been yoked for one and forty years, and I have wished my wife under the ground any time since&#146;  (<span class="italic">Early Diary</span>, 1.275). She also accused him of misogyny. Shebbeare's troubled domestic situation may be reflected in the often ambiguous attitude towards women revealed in his fiction, where the idealization of virtuous young heroines appears beside strong condemnation of female vice and folly. In addition to his political intolerance, Shebbeare was also an uncompromising high-church tory and English nationalist, his works being riddled with abuse of Quakers, Presbyterians, other dissenters, Jews, and the Scots. An egoist, Shebbeare appeared to be perpetually at war with a world which he felt did not recognize his worth as a medical man, novelist, and political commentator. The poverty and obscurity of his early life may have contributed to his sensitivity and aggressive self-assertiveness.<br>
<br>Shebbeare's written works suffered from a lack of originality and the haste with which they were composed. His novels, modelled upon those of Henry Fielding, reveal these flaws in their diffuse style, rambling narratives, conventional plots, and poor construction. As a political writer, Shebbeare was also deeply indebted to others, most notably to Lord Bolingbroke, for the content of his political ideology and the form of its expression. His social satire and political commentary, however, could be energetic, cogent, and effective, as James Boswell recognized when claiming that &#145;whatever objections were made to him&#146;, he &#145;had knowledge and abilities much above the class of ordinary writers, and deserves to be remembered as a respectable name in literature, were it only for his admirable <span class="italic">Letters on the English Nation</span>&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1151). During the Seven Years' War, Shebbeare's <span class="italic">Letters to the People of England</span> were widely read and politically influential. His emotionally charged, powerfully written patriot rhetoric contributed to the development of political discontent with the Newcastle ministry after the fall of Minorca, and encouraged the extra-parliamentary protests which helped to bring about its collapse in November 1756. There was also some foundation to Shebbeare's claim, however typically exaggerated, that he had assisted Pitt in his attempts to mobilize popular patriot support, especially among the tories. Shebbeare died in Eaton Street, Pimlico, on 1 August 1788.<br>
