<span class="headword">Beer <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Sassoon]</span>,  Rachel</span>  (1858&#150;1927), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor and editor</span>, was born in Bombay, India, the middle child and only daughter of Sassoon David Sassoon (1832&#150;1867), a Jewish merchant, and his wife, Farha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Reuben (<i>b</i>. 1828). Rachel's father arrived in England towards the end of 1858 to manage the London branch of the family business, followed a few months later by his wife and their two children. They chose Ashley Park estate in Surrey to be their family home.<br>
<br>The merchant dynasty of the Sassoons originated in Iraq. The family was often described as &#145;the Rothschilds of the East&#146;  (Jackson, 1); their wealth was derived from trading in cotton, opium, and other goods in China and the Far East. Rachel's mother became absorbed in &#145;romantic pretensions to culture and gentility&#146; after her husband's death  (ibid., 73). A determined matriarch, she had a temper and wit to match, though she was not unknown for her generous, somewhat indulgent gestures. Farha ostracized her younger son Alfred for marrying a non-Jew, the first member of the family to do so. His name was never again mentioned in her presence.<br>
<br>Rachel Sassoon was small in build, with &#145;an ivory skin envied by her sallower kinswomen&#146;  (Jackson, 74). Gentle and compassionate, she had no time for the hearty young men who sought her company at social gatherings. Instead, she took up unpaid hospital nursing. Despite her mother's threats she continued to visit Alfred and his wife, Theresa Thornycroft, and their growing family. Their younger son, and Rachel's favourite nephew, was the future poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35953/', "Siegfried Sassoon (1886&#150;1967)")</script>.<br>
<br>Approaching thirty, with perhaps a fear of spinsterhood, in 1887 Rachel announced her engagement to the gentile Frederick Arthur Beer (<i>d</i>. 1903). Frederick was &#145;small and dapper&#146;, with a gentle smile and &#145;a brownish beard curling silkily over his cravat&#146;  (Jackson, 79). He was the son of Julius Beer who, like the Rothschilds, had come from Frankfurt. Through dealings on the stock exchange in London, Julius had become very wealthy: his son inherited an income of &pound;20,000 a year, as well as ownership of <span class="italic">The Observer</span> (which his father had acquired as an outlet for his views on international relations, rather than as a profitable business). The couple married on 4 August 1887 at Chelsea parish church. W. E. Gladstone and his wife were present, and signed the marriage register as witnesses. The Beers settled at 7 Chesterfield Gardens, Mayfair, a house with a fine Adam staircase. Unfortunately, it soon became clear that Frederick Beer was ill: he suffered from &#145;strange &#147;headaches&#148; which suddenly made this mild man &hellip; irritable or, at times, feverishly gay&#146;  (Jackson, 80). Although not then diagnosed, his illness was probably caused by syphilis, his symptoms being those common to the early stages of general paralysis of the insane. Despite Frederick's illness, the splendours of visits to Chesterfield Gardens were much enjoyed by Rachel's nephews, and memorably described by Siegfried Sassoon in <span class="italic">The Old Century and Seven More Years</span> (1938).<br>
<br>Despite her husband's illness, Rachel Beer began to write articles for <span class="italic">The Observer</span> and eventually took over as editor. In October 1893 she ambitiously purchased the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, then an eight-page penny newspaper, for &pound;11,000 and also edited this. Though not considered a brilliant editor, Rachel Beer came to be known in Fleet Street for her &#145;occasional flair and business-like decisions&#146;  (Jackson, 95). She insisted on the need for an objective political approach by the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> and orchestrated one of the major journalistic scoops of 1898: Major Esterhazy's confession of forgery against Dreyfus. A known Jewish newspaper owner, Rachel Beer bravely endured vilification for her pro-Dreyfus stance.<br>
<br>Frederick Beer's mental and physical state was still bad, if not deteriorating: he insisted, for example, on having the Beer family crest clipped out on his black poodle's back. Rachel herself was writing book reviews, occasional features, and leaders. The latter she would write in an indecipherable hand and have delivered at the eleventh hour by a footman, to the annoyance of her sub-editors.<br>
<br>Frederick Beer's death in 1903 left Rachel distraught for months, and eventually led to her own breakdown. Strange leading articles began to appear in <span class="italic">The Observer</span> and the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> on subjects such as the advantages of cannibalism, and her ability to cope apparently collapsed halfway through an editorial for <span class="italic">The Observer</span> with a &#145;continued in the next&#146;  (Jackson, 115). In 1904 Rachel Beer was certified and committed to the care of the commissioners of lunacy. Both newspapers were sold by her trustees in the course of 1904.<br>
<br>Although Rachel Beer gradually recovered her mental health, she continued to need nursing care until the end of her days. She was allowed to buy Chancellor House, an imposing residence in Tunbridge Wells, and lived there with a butler and servants, in addition to her nurses. Although often too ill to receive visitors, she allowed local charities to make use of the house and grounds when needed. She acquired a fine organ and occasionally gave performances for a few friends in her drawing-room.<br>
<br>Rachel Beer died at Chancellor House, Tunbridge Wells, on 29 April 1927. Her favourite nephew, Siegfried Sassoon, received a legacy of &pound;30,000 from her estate, and in his library at Heytesbury House in Wiltshire later kept a splendid oil painting of her over the fireplace.<br>
