<span class="headword">Carver,  Alfred James</span>  (1826&#150;1909), <span class="occ">headmaster</span>, was born at King's Lynn on 22 March 1826, the only son of James Carver (1790&#150;1866) and his wife, Anne Spurling. His father was an evangelical clergyman of an old Norfolk family, who, after graduating at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, devoted himself in London to the spiritual welfare of prisoners for crime or debt in Newgate and other prisons. Carver was admitted to St Paul's School, London, on 20 February 1836, proceeding from there to Trinity College, Cambridge, as a scholar in 1845. At Cambridge he was elected Bell university scholar in 1846, and he won the Burney university prize essay in 1849. He graduated BA with a first class in classics and as a senior optime in 1849. Next year he became classical lecturer and fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge. His fellowship lapsed on his marriage in 1853 to Eliza (<i>d</i>. 1907), youngest daughter of William Peek, of Peek, Winch &amp; Co., tea merchants. His active connection with his university ceased after he served as examiner in the classical tripos in 1857&#150;8.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in 1852, Carver became surmaster of St Paul's, his old school, and was ordained in the following year. In 1858 he was appointed master of Alleyn's College of God's Gift at Dulwich. A new scheme for the development of Alleyn's educational foundation had just been sanctioned by a private act of parliament. Although Alleyn had intended, by statutes drawn up in 1626, to found a public school of the high grade, his educational endowment was until 1858 applied solely to the instruction of &#145;twelve poor scholars&#146;. The new act, which Carver was first to administer, created two schools of different types. The upper school, providing a public-school education for boys up to the age of eighteen, was soon known as Dulwich College, and the lower school, offering what was described as middle-class secondary education, mainly for boys intended for commerce, was named Alleyn's School. Both schools were under Carver's control and prospered greatly. The upper school or Dulwich College moved in 1870 to a building designed by Charles Barry (1823&#150;1900).<br>
<br>Carver's energy created Dulwich College, and made it one of the leading public schools, though not without a long period of controversy involving the chairman of the board of governors, William Rogers, who believed that Alleyn's legacy should be used to educate a larger number and wider social range of London children. Carver finally carried his point in 1882 when, under a new act, Dulwich College and Alleyn's School, which also moved into new buildings under his guidance, became two distinct schools under separate masters. He felt able to retire in the following year with a pension after twenty-five years' service.<br>
<br>During his headmastership Carver carried into practice broad-minded views on education. He saw that every subject could be of educational value, pioneered the teaching of science and modern languages, and promoted the study of art. His object was to develop a boy's faculties on lines most congenial to his natural aptitude, at the same time opposing rigid specialization. He was the first headmaster to pass boys direct from school into the Indian Civil Service; an old boys' club, the Alleyn Club, founded at his instigation in 1873, was one of the first of its kind.<br>
<br>In 1861 Carver was made DD of Lambeth by the archbishop of Canterbury, and in 1882 he was appointed an honorary canon of Rochester. In later life he was chairman of the governors of James Allen's Girls' Schools at Dulwich, and vice-president and member of the council of the Royal Naval School, Eltham (closed in 1909). Carver, who had three sons and five daughters, died at his home, Lynnhurst, Streatham Common, on 25 July 1909, and was buried in Norwood cemetery, the first part of the funeral service being held in the college chapel.<br>
