<span class="headword">Ostrer,  Isidore</span>  (1889&#150;1975), <span class="occ">financier and film producer</span>, was born in the East End of London on 17 June 1889, the third surviving son of Nathan Ostrer (<i>d</i>. 1932), a jeweller's salesman, and his wife, Francesca 
    (Fanny; <i>d</i>. 1932)
  . His father had left Ukraine to escape antisemitic persecution in the 1870s, and came to England via Paris, where he met his future wife. Isidore was the most outstandingly intelligent of the six Ostrer children; the film actor James Mason later said that the five brothers had one opinion and one brain between them  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 9 July 1996).<br>
<br>Ostrer began work as a stockbroker's clerk in the City of London. On 31 March 1914 he married Helen Dorothy, daughter of Lloyd Spear-Morgan, a solicitor, and granddaughter of the high sheriff of Carmarthenshire. The couple had six children. Ostrer was turned down for service in the army because of health reasons, but prospered sufficiently to set up the Lothbury Investment Corporation in 1919 and Ostrer Brothers Merchant Bank (with two of his brothers, Maurice and Mark) in 1921.<br>
<br>In the 1920s Ostrer and his brothers were responsible for a number of company flotations, the most important of which were Amalgamated Textiles in 1920 and the Gaumont-British Picture Corporation in 1927. The prospects opened up by the first <span class="roman">Cinematograph Films Act</span> and the coming of the &#145;talkies&#146; encouraged Isidore to assume direct control of Gaumont-British. In August 1929 he became chairman, with Mark as vice-chairman and Maurice joint managing director.<br>
<br>Having created a circuit of over 350 cinemas, Ostrer turned his hand to film production. The old Gaumont studio at Lime Grove, Shepherd's Bush, was rebuilt and Ostrer encouraged his production chief, Michael Balcon, to make big budget films which would appeal to an international audience. Most ambitious of these was an adaptation of Leon Feuchtwangler's <span class="italic">Jew Suss</span> (1934) starring Conrad Veidt, Benita Hume, and one of Ostrer's three daughters, Pamela. However, the American market proved resistant to British films, substantial losses were made, and in 1937 Gaumont-British's production activities were severely curtailed.<br>
<br>Ostrer had encouraged American investment in Gaumont-British as early as 1929 when William Fox bought a substantial (though not, as he had thought, a controlling) interest in the company. In 1936 another deal was planned with the brothers Joseph and Nicholas Schenk&#151;the heads respectively of Twentieth Century Fox and MGM&#151;but it was disrupted by a hostile counterbid by John Maxwell of the rival Associated-British cinema circuit. In October 1941 Ostrer sold his shares to J. Arthur Rank, though it was not until 1944 that the conflicting interests in the corporation were sufficiently reconciled for Rank to assume complete control.<br>
<br>His first marriage having ended in divorce, on 27 April 1933 Ostrer married Marjorie, daughter of John William Ernest Roach. Because of his second wife's tuberculosis, Ostrer moved to South Africa; but his Jewish background and radical views made it difficult for him to condone a white supremacist society. He returned to England, but remained in touch with his wife, an actress and model, and their adopted daughter. Isidore Ostrer published two books on economics, <span class="italic">A New International Currency</span> (1921) and <span class="italic">The Conquest of Gold</span> (1932), displaying an idiosyncratic but strikingly progressive approach similar in spirit to that of J. M. Keynes. He also published two books of poetry, and was fond of telling people that money was only important to him in so far as it permitted him to write and paint.<br>
<br>Although Ostrer had divested himself of his film interests, he was not ready to retire, and he reinvolved himself with the textile industry. Since the launch of Amalgamated Textiles in 1920 he and his brothers had retained a twenty-three per cent stake in the company (which long since had been renamed Illingworth-Morris). Ostrer quickly built this up to over fifty per cent and took control of the company, attempting over the next twenty-four years to make it the dominant force in the woollen textiles industry. Guided by Ostrer's economic theories, Illingworth-Morris used its profits to expand by buying up its rivals. This policy was misguided, and by the time of Ostrer's death the company had become an unwieldy giant, supplying vestments to the papacy and tennis-ball cloth to Dunlop, but ill-equipped to withstand the harsh economic climate of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Ostrer's daughter Pamela Mason, the film actress, inherited his dominant shareholding in the company.<br>
<br>Isidore Ostrer's progressive views extended from economics to health and lifestyle. He believed that the secret of longevity lay in fasting&#151;sometimes for as long as thirty days&#151;and drinking only water. He was disappointed in his expectation that he would live until he was 130, but he managed to lead a healthy and active life until shortly before his death from cancer at the age of eighty-five on 3 September 1975 at his home, Hills End, Titlarks Hill, Sunningdale.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_61597"></a><span class="headword">Mark Ostrer</span>  (1892&#150;1958), <span class="occ">financier and film producer</span>, was born three years after Isidore, on 4 November 1892. He served very effectively as the public face of the Ostrers. It was Mark who attended film premi&egrave;res and hobnobbed with film stars and his amiability well qualified him as the envoy of the Gaumont-British Picture Corporation in its negotiations with Hollywood. When the corporation was taken over by J. Arthur Rank, Mark retained his place on the board because of his good relations with the heads of Twentieth Century Fox and MGM; he remained a popular and influential figure in the British film industry until his death. Mark Ostrer was married twice, first to Karen Peterson (<i>d</i>. 1940); and then in 1943 to Olivia May Venning, with whom he had two sons. Mark Ostrer died at 186 Charles Street, London, on 5 November 1958. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_61598"></a><span class="headword">Maurice Ostrer</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1975), <span class="occ">financier and film producer</span>, was the youngest of the brothers. He was described by James Mason (who married Isidore's daughter Pamela) as Isidore's shadow. Certainly the brothers collaborated very closely throughout a long and adventurous business career and Maurice died within months of his older brother, in December 1975. Maurice's main achievement, other than helping to manage Isidore's affairs, was in running Gainsborough Studios. He was in charge of production from 1937 onwards, but the day-to-day running of the studio was left in the capable hands of Edward Black until November 1943, when the two men fell out and Black resigned. It was in the period between the end of 1943 and the beginning of 1946, when Maurice took direct charge of the studio, that Gainsborough's most successful films, such as <span class="italic">The Wicked Lady</span> (1945), were produced. After resigning from Gainsborough in May 1946, Maurice worked briefly as an independent producer, and then joined Isidore in Cannes. Until the early 1970s he spent most of his time there, returning to England only for Illingworth-Morris board meetings. But his last years were spent with Isidore in a large house in Sunningdale, where the brothers became increasingly reclusive, even from each other. Maurice Ostrer died on 3 December 1975 at Sunningdale.<br>
