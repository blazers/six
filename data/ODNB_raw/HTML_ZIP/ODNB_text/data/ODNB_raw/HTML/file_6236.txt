<span class="headword">Cooper,  William Durrant</span>  (1812&#150;1875), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born on 10 January 1812 in High Street, Lewes, Sussex, the son of Thomas Cooper (1789&#150;1841), solicitor, and his wife, Lucy Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Durrant (<i>d</i>. 1867). He was educated at Lewes grammar school until at the age of fifteen he was articled to his father; he was admitted attorney and solicitor at the Michaelmas term of 1832.<br>
<br>Cooper's evidence in 1833 to a House of Commons committee on the negligent way in which he had found incumbents keeping parish registers reveals an early interest in archives, albeit to prove title to property. In the following year he published a substantial history of parliamentary elections in all the Sussex constituencies; this reappeared as an appendix to <span class="italic">The History &hellip; of &hellip; Sussex</span> (1835) by T. W. Horsfield (1792&#150;1837). It was followed by a short <span class="italic">Glossary of the Provincialisms in Use in Sussex</span> (1836; 2nd edn, 1853).<br>
<br>The electoral history signalled also active engagement in politics, in the whig cause. After helping John Easthope (1784&#150;1865) in his unsuccessful attempt to win the Lewes seat in 1837, Cooper moved permanently to London and joined the parliamentary staff of the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, of which Easthope was a proprietor. He subsequently worked for <span class="italic">The Times</span>, but in time abandoned journalism to concentrate on his legal practice, chiefly conveyancing and parliamentary agency. Some of the offices he held may have been in recognition of political support: the duke of Norfolk made him auditor of Skelton Castle, Yorkshire (in 1843), and his steward for the borough of Lewes (in the mid-1860s). He had joined the Reform Club in 1837 and was appointed its solicitor about 1870. His most lucrative office was probably that of solicitor to the vestry of St Pancras, London (1858).<br>
<br>Cooper's greater love, however, was history and associated literary pursuits, particularly editing documents of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Removal to London permitted active involvement in the national antiquarian societies. In 1841 Cooper was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and not only published four papers in <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> but also gave sterling service on the finance committee. The council of the Camden Society he joined in 1846, and between 1853 and 1862 he edited two volumes and contributed to two of the society's <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span>. He edited a volume of plays, <span class="italic">Ralph Roister Doister &hellip; and the Tragedie of Gorbaduc</span>, for the Shakespeare Society (1847) and published privately (1844) seven letters by or associated with Laurence Sterne, which he found in the muniment room at Skelton Castle.<br>
<br>Cooper contributed six papers to the journals of the London and Middlesex, Kent, and Surrey archaeological societies. Having joined the Sussex Archaeological Society within its first year (1846&#150;7), his contributions were more prolific: one, two, or three articles to all but one of the first twenty-five volumes (1848&#150;73) of the society's <span class="italic">Collections</span>. As editor in 1859&#150;65 he was known for the copious notes he added to other authors' contributions. His most sustained piece of work was the <span class="italic">History of Winchelsea</span> (1850): his father's family had come from the neighbouring parish of Icklesham.<br>
<br>In 1872 Cooper was stricken by an attack of paralysis, but he lingered for three years longer, before dying on 28 December 1875 at 81 Guilford Street, Russell Square, London, his home since at latest 1848. He was never married, and latterly lived with his spinster sister.<br>
