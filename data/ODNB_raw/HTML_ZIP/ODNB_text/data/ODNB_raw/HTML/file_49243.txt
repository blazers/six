<span class="headword">McLean,  Lex</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Alexander McLean Cameron]</span>  (1907&#150;1975), <span class="occ">comedian</span>, was born on 30 April 1907 at 6 Rosebery Place, Clydebank, Dunbartonshire. He was the son of Donald (Daniel) Cameron (<i>c</i>.1871&#150;1951), ironmoulder, and his second wife, Mary Howe McLean (1876&#150;1948), greengrocer. After secondary education at Clydebank high school he began an apprenticeship at John Brown's shipyard when he was fourteen. He left in 1924 for his first professional appearance as a pianist in a theatre orchestra in Clydebank. Also an accomplished accordionist, saxophonist, and clarinettist, his versatility earned him bookings in local theatres and with seaside concert parties. In the late 1920s and early 1930s he toured Scotland with a group, the Meltonians, and became a foil for comics such as Jack Radcliffe and George West. He married Grace Isabella Dryburgh (1910&#150;1980), a dancer, on 2 June 1939. There were no children from the marriage.<br>
<br>In 1948 Lex McLean put together his own roadshow and went out as a solo comic. His reception justified the opinion he had always held of his ability. By 1950 he could command &pound;80 for a week at the Glasgow Metropole and in 1955 exceeded all records with a nineteen-week summer season at the Aberdeen Tivoli. Similar success followed in Edinburgh and Dundee and he did not hesitate when asked to take over the prestigious summer shows at the Glasgow Pavilion. This was McLean's breakthrough. From the outset he was a smash hit and went on to fill the theatre twice nightly, six nights a week, between May and September for the next fifteen years.<br>
<br>McLean was also the top box-office draw in Edinburgh, Dundee, and Aberdeen. He had a self-confidence, which to some bordered on arrogance, concerning his ability and knowledge of what audiences wanted on a night out. He thought it wrong and a betrayal to try to educate them as he said they came because &#145;they want to laugh and they go away feeling happy&#146;  (Somerville). His comedy was brash, boisterous, and bawdy and the targets were familiar: nagging wives, mothers-in-law, and work-shy husbands. From the first moment he burst on stage in one of his outrageous baggy suits, loosing volleys of one-liners and castigating unfortunate latecomers, the audiences were with him for the rest of the show. Undoubtedly McLean's material was nearer the bone than that of his predecessors but he stoutly denied accusations that he was &#145;blue&#146; or suggestive. He was too clever to use bad language or be offensive but he knew how to deliver a <i>double entendre</i> and challenge the audience to see something untoward in anything said or done on stage.<br>
<br>A strong, well-balanced supporting cast was always a feature of a Lex McLean show. He chose the acts himself, insisted on high standards, and was not slow to dismiss those whom he considered unprofessional or not making sufficient impact. His famous exhortation was &#145;Keep it bright!&#146; The tempo was never allowed to flag, with McLean working harder than anyone to keep the show moving along. Although his four television series between 1968 and 1972 were popular, his active, noisy style did not really suit the medium, with which he never seemed truly happy.<br>
<br>Off-stage McLean was the opposite of his loud, extrovert stage character. Always soberly suited, his only concession to showmanship was a polka-dotted bow tie. He was a quiet, very private individual who lived with his wife in their large seafront house in Helensburgh, where his favourite relaxation was sailing his cabin cruiser on the Firth of Clyde. As well as control over the cast, McLean's contracts gave him a generous percentage of box-office takings and this undoubtedly made him the highest-earning performer in Scotland in the 1960s. Despite this he always gave the impression of being worried and unsure about the future, and from 1971 he was dogged by illness. Lex McLean died at his home, 2 Cumberland Avenue, Helensburgh, from pneumonia on 23 March 1975, and was cremated at Clydebank crematorium on 26 March. He was the outstanding Scottish comedian of his generation, and was content to remain in Scotland, seeing no advantage in giving up his pre-eminent position with absolute control over his career to work for someone else.<br>
