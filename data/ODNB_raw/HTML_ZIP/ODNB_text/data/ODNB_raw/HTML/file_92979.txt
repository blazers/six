<span class="headword">Baynard,  Richard</span>  (1371&#150;1434), <span class="occ">lawyer and speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was born on 2 February 1371, the fourth son of Thomas Baynard (<i>d</i>. 1375) of Messing, Essex, the family home since the twelfth century. He inherited Messing, Birch Hall, and Le Castle at the age of four, his wardship and marriage being sold for 125 marks (&pound;83 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.) to Sir Robert Tey, who may well have married him to his own daughter. Full possession of his patrimony was not to come for many years, for the bulk of the estate was held for life by his mother, Katherine, who married John Hende, the wealthy London draper. Baynard paid the Hendes &pound;44 p.a. to lease two family manors from them, but augmented his income through his marriages. The second and third of these, to Joyce Vyne and Joan Sandherst, both heiresses of Londoners, brought him several properties in the City, while the fourth, to Grace Peyton, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Burgoyne (<i>d</i>. 1439), added the manor of Easthorpe and the hundred of Lexden to his holdings in Essex, these constituting Grace's dower from her former husband, John Peyton. Baynard's income was said to be &pound;46 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. in 1412, and &pound;80 in 1436, but neither assessment took account of his London property.<br>
<br>As an able lawyer, with expertise in the spheres of finance and land, Baynard's services were in demand among the gentry of Essex and the citizens of London. Initially, his most important client was Walter, fourth Baron Fitzwalter (<i>d</i>. 1406), who supported the usurpation of Henry Bolingbroke, and perhaps this connection led to Baynard's appointment as the first escheator of Henry IV's reign in Essex and Hertfordshire. However, in a will made in 1400 he left &pound;5 for prayers for the souls of John Holland, earl of Huntingdon, and Sir Thomas Shelley, both executed for treason in January that year. Shortly afterwards he succeeded his brother-in-law John Doreward as steward of the local estates of the king's uncle, Edward, duke of York, who had married Fitzwalter's stepmother. Elected to parliament in 1406 for the first of six times as a knight of the shire for Essex, he made an impression in the Commons, being one of the dozen members assigned to represent the house at the engrossment of the parliament roll. His involvement in the business dealings of his stepfather, Hende, one of the foremost of Henry IV's financial backers, secured for him the controllership of the customs at Ipswich in 1407, while his knowledge of the law led to regular inclusion on the quorum of peace commissions. From 1412 to 1415 he belonged to a syndicate possessed of estates of Richard de Vere, eleventh earl of Oxford, and he later acted in transactions on behalf of Thomas, Baron Morley, a member of Henry V's council. Despite such connections, his election as speaker in the parliament of December 1421 (held by the duke of Bedford in the king's absence) is surprising, since he then held no crown office. Nor did his speakership lead to royal preferment. During his fourth parliament, in 1423, he acted as the spokesman of a deputation to the Lords regarding negotiations for the liberation of James I of Scotland, and in his fifth, in 1427, he led a similar deputation to announce the election as speaker of his friend John Tyrell. His legal services continued to be sought, notably by Walter, fifth Baron Fitzwalter, and the young John de Vere, twelfth earl of Oxford.<br>
<br>Baynard drafted several wills, of which those dated 1400, 1420, 1426, 1427, and 1433 survive. In the last, made on 7 March 1433, he requested burial in the chancel of St John's Abbey, Colchester, and asked Tyrell, then treasurer of the king's household, to be an overseer. He sat with Tyrell in the parliament that assembled in July, but died on 7 January 1434, less than three weeks after its dissolution. Baynard had been caught up in the bitter quarrel over the inheritance of the Brokholes family, in which he sided with the daughters of John Sumpter of Colchester against the Armburghs, so earning the latters' enmity. They asserted that God punished him for his partiality so that he suddenly &#145;felle downe and dyed with owte howsill and shrifte&#146; while out hunting with Lady Abergavenny, and that his troubled ghost wandered the countryside causing &#145;moche harme&#146;  (Carpenter, 62).<br>
