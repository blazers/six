<span class="headword">Blanchard,  (Samuel) Laman</span>  (1803&#150;1845), <span class="occ">author and journalist</span>, was born at Great Yarmouth on 15 May 1803, the only son of Samuel Blanchard and his wife, the widowed Mary Cowell, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Laman. There were five other children of the marriage, all of them daughters. In 1804 his father moved to Southwark, establishing himself as a painter and glazier. In 1809 Blanchard entered St Olave's School in Southwark, where he became the chief Latin scholar, but despite the wishes of the master and the school's trustees to send him to a university and maintain him there for two years, his father's strained finances did not allow him to contemplate supporting his son for a third year. On leaving school in 1816 Blanchard became a clerk to Charles Pearson, a proctor in Doctors' Commons, an occupation he found uncongenial. His preference for a literary career was evident in the precocious dramatic sketches (&#145;Flores histrionici&#146;) he published in <span class="italic">The Drama</span> in 1823, sketches marked by the influence of the work of B. W. Procter (Barry Cornwall) and Byron. About 1822 he formed a close and enduring friendship with Douglas Jerrold, and through Jerrold made the acquaintance of the actor John Buckstone. After abandoning a whimsical notion of going with Jerrold to fight with Byron in Greece, Blanchard resolved to dedicate himself to the stage and was briefly engaged by the manager of the Margate Theatre. According to Buckstone, quoted by Bulwer-Lytton, &#145;a week was sufficient to disgust him with the beggary and drudgery of the country player's life&#146;  (Bulwer-Lytton, xii) and he was obliged to return to London penniless and on foot. He subsequently worked as a reader for the printer Bayliss in Fleet Street, the publisher of the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span>, to which he had already begun to contribute verse and prose.<br>
<br>In 1823 Blanchard married Ann Elizabeth Gates. There were four children of the marriage, three sons and a daughter. Through the influence of his brother-in-law, Nicholas Vigors, he was appointed to an assistant secretaryship at the Zoological Society of London in 1826, holding the post for three years. In this period his literary activity burgeoned, and in 1828 his friend William Harrison Ainsworth published his volume of verse <span class="italic">Lyric Offerings</span>, a volume dedicated to Charles Lamb. In 1831 he was appointed sub-editor of the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span>, then under the direction of George Croly, and editor of the <span class="italic">Belle Assembl&eacute;e</span>. He contributed verse to both journals. In the following year he also became associated with the Liberal daily the <span class="italic">True Sun</span>, and when the paper failed in 1836 he assumed the editorship of the short-lived daily <span class="italic">The Constitutional</span>. From 1836 to 1837 he also directed the <span class="italic">Court Journal</span> and from 1837 to 1839 the whig evening paper <span class="italic">The Courier</span>. Following a shift in <span class="italic">The Courier's</span> ownership and political bias in 1839, a failed attempt was made by, among others, Bulwer-Lytton, to obtain for him either a clerkship or the editorship of the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> from the whig government. From 1841 to 1845 he was closely associated with the <span class="italic">Examiner</span> and for a year from February 1842 he served as sub-editor of <span class="italic">Ainsworth's Magazine</span>. In 1842 he also directed and contributed to the monthly journal <span class="italic">George Cruikshank's Omnibus</span>.<br>
<br>In February 1844 Ann Blanchard was struck with what was described at the time as &#145;paralysis&#146;, and after a protracted period of suffering died on 16 December. Distracted by his wife's illness and death, by the pressures of periodical journalism, and by concern for his four children, Blanchard entered an acute depressive state during which symptoms of his wife's paralysis were repeated in him. On 14 February 1845 he committed suicide by cutting his throat with a razor at his home at 11 Union Place, Lambeth Road, London. A coroner's inquest decreed that he was of unsound mind at the time. He was interred the following month at Norwood cemetery.<br>
<br>Blanchard's death occasioned a good deal of supportive activity from his wide circle of literary friends, many of whom raised funds to benefit his orphaned children. Those friends included Douglas Jerrold, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, William Harrison Ainsworth, Thomas Noon Talfourd, Charles Dickens, Leigh Hunt, John Forster, B. W. Procter, Robert Browning, George Cruikshank, W. M. Thackeray, and W. C. Macready. In 1831, at the distraught father's request, Blanchard had arranged the funeral of William Godwin's only son, who had died of cholera in the epidemic of that year. He had also been a steady friend and supporter of Laetitia Landon (L.E.L.) and published a sympathetic appreciation of her career in his <span class="italic">The Life and Literary Remains of L.E.L.</span> of 1841. He was godfather, and subsequently father-in-law, to Douglas Jerrold's son, William Blanchard, who in 1876 collected his <span class="italic">Poetical Works</span>. His essay on Harrison Ainsworth, published in <span class="italic">The Mirror</span> in 1842, was regularly reprinted as a preface to later nineteenth-century editions of Ainsworth's collected works.<br>
<br>Blanchard was described by Bulwer-Lytton as being &#145;small and slight, though sufficiently well-knit&#146; and his dark features as &#145;of rather an oriental cast&#146;  (Bulwer-Lytton, xxxvi). Ainsworth, referring to the Maclise sketch reproduced in <span class="italic">Sketches from Life</span>, noted that &#145;it has his gravest looks, and wants that cordial and bewitching smile which ordinarily lighted up the features&#146;  (Ainsworth, 134). Thackeray too remembered &#145;his keen, kind, beaming Jew face,&#151;a mixture of Mendelsohn and Voltaire&#146;  (Thackeray, 347). Defending Blanchard's decision to concentrate on a career in periodical journalism, Thackeray also insisted that &#145;his education and habits, his quick easy manner, his sparkling hidden fun, constant tenderness, and brilliant good-humour were best employed as they were&#146;  (ibid., 346).<br>
<br>Blanchard's prose essays were collected in three volumes by Bulwer-Lytton in 1846 as <span class="italic">Sketches from Life</span>. In his obituary of Blanchard in <span class="italic">Ainsworth's Magazine</span> (7 March 1845, 220) Ainsworth remarked that the essays placed Blanchard &#145;on a level with one whom he admired and knew well&#151;the celebrated Elia&#146;. The first volume contains a substantial memorial essay by Bulwer-Lytton and a lithographic portrait after a drawing by Daniel Maclise. The collected <span class="italic">Poetical Works</span> of 1876 has on its title page a photographic reproduction of a miniature by Louisa Stuart Costello. Blanchard's <span class="italic">Corporation Characters: Forming a Select Portrait Gathering of Civic Celebrities</span>, illustrated by Kenny Meadows, appeared posthumously in 1855.<br>
