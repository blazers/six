<span class="headword">Southwood, Sir  (Thomas) Richard Edmund</span>  (1931&#150;2005), <span class="occ">ecologist and university administrator</span>, was born at Marlborough Cottage, Old Perry Street, Northfleet, Kent, on 20 June 1931, the only child of Edmund William Southwood (<i>d</i>. 1984), dairy farmer, and his wife, Ada Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Regg (<i>d</i>. 1949), jewellery designer and daughter of T. R. Regg, archdeacon of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia. When he was four years old, the family moved from the farm where he was born and where the family business continued, more as a wholesale and retail dairy business than a farm, to Kingston House, Old Perry Street. Northfleet, near Gravesend, was still &#145;country&#146; at that time, although changing with urban creep.<h2>
<a name="Entomologistandnaturalhistorian"></a>Entomologist and natural historian</h2>Southwood's interest in natural history, expressed in observing, identifying, and collecting specimens (mainly insects), began early, and by six he was resolved on a career as an entomologist. From the ages of five to eleven he attended the small and local Bronte School, where all ages were together in one class. He was thus ill prepared for Gravesend grammar school, but its headmaster's judgement in giving more importance to his eleven-plus result than to his formal learning at that point was validated by his performance there. He went on to study entomology at Imperial College, London (1949&#150;52), and to complete his PhD there in 1955. His research was carried out at the Rothamsted experimental station, where he met his wife, Alison Langley Harden, secretary, and daughter of Arthur Langley Harden, hat manufacturer. They married on 10 September 1955, at the parish church in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, and had two sons, Mark (<i>b</i>. 1959) and Charles (<i>b</i>. 1960).<br>
<br>Southwood published five scientific papers&#151;four entomological notes and an observation on sunbathing by pigeons in <span class="italic">British Birds</span>&#151;while still at school. As an undergraduate at university he moved on to more serious publications in academic entomological journals. One of these was referred to in the leading ecology text of the day, giving him the unusual distinction of a textbook citation before he had completed his PhD. He was active in the Royal Entomological Society as a schoolboy, and as an undergraduate taught summer courses at the Field Studies Centre at Flatford Mill, in East Bergholt, Suffolk, showing early the flair and enthusiasm that generations of subsequent students at Imperial College's field station at Silwood Park, near Ascot, Berkshire, and elsewhere would appreciate.<br>
<br>After completing his PhD Southwood was appointed to a lectureship at Silwood Park in 1955. His story to this point had been one of a keen and precocious naturalist&#151;a watcher, collector, and codifier, mainly but not exclusively of insects&#151;moving on to become a professional entomologist. The broader discipline of ecology at this time was still primarily an observational and descriptive science. Although prefigured by some early mathematical models and by some penetrating questions about &#145;why is it so?&#146;, it was not until the 1960s that the subject began to acquire a substantial conceptual base, at the hands of such seminal figures as Evelyn Hutchinson (at Yale), David Lack and Charles Elton (at Oxford), Robert MacArthur (at Princeton), and others. This quest for deeper understanding was reinforced by growing needs to control insect pests and the effects of introduced alien species, and other environmental problems associated with an unprecedented growth in the human population. From his base as a consummate entomologist, Southwood became one of the influential pioneers in forming a vision of how ecology should develop across a broad front, fusing scientific natural history, applied biology, and the more theoretical, quantitative approaches to population biology.<h2>
<a name="Entomologicalecologist"></a>Entomological ecologist</h2>Southwood's journey from classical entomologist to the newly emerging category of entomological ecologist was gradual; there was no Damascene epiphany. His first paper asking primarily ecological questions was &#145;The number of species of insect associated with various trees&#146;, published in the <span class="italic">Journal of Animal Ecology</span> in 1961. In this he used his encyclopaedic knowledge of insects to examine why different tree species harbour markedly different numbers of herbivorous insect species feeding on them. This paper anticipated important aspects of Robert MacArthur and E. O. Wilson's highly influential <span class="italic">Theory of Island Biogeography</span> (1967). His encyclopaedic knowledge of Heteropteran bugs led him to ask why they vary considerably in their dispersal abilities, with some being completely wingless and others strong fliers. The answer, he suggested, lay in the ways in which the spatial structure and scale of the environment influence the evolutionary strategies of species, affecting reproduction and dispersal in various ways. Beginning with his article &#145;The relationship of flight and habitat in some Carabidae&#146;, published in <span class="italic">The Entomologist</span> in 1962, this body of work was drawn together in his presidential address to the British Ecological Society in 1977, &#145;Habitat, the templet for ecological strategies&#146;, which, after publication in the <span class="italic">Journal of Animal Ecology</span>, became one of the most cited papers in the entire field of ecology. This paper was particularly notable for the way it linked traditional informal and descriptive approaches to studying life histories with the growing body of mathematical theory based on optimality arguments and trade-offs among different demands on an organism's limiting resources.<br>
<br>Ecology textbooks of the 1950s were almost wholly descriptive. The corresponding texts of the 1990s, by contrast, contained a blend of observation, field and laboratory experiment, and theory expressed often in mathematical terms. Southwood was one of the principal architects of this maturation of the subject. His strengths were an extraordinary knowledge of, and acute appreciation for, the natural world of plants and animals, coupled with an intuitive feeling for the major questions that population biologists and ecologists should be asking. His own mathematical talents were minimal, but when more explicitly mathematical elements were necessary in the assault on a question or problem he engaged fruitfully and happily with appropriate colleagues&#151;many of whose own careers flourished under his aegis.<br>
<br>In addition to his primary research, on topics ranging from entomological systematics and taxonomy, through population and community ecology, to the practical control of particular agricultural pests or disease vectors, Southwood was also highly adept at consolidating and synthesizing in authoritative reviews. One such was his influential book with Don Strong and John Lawton, <span class="italic">Insects on Plants</span> (1989). One compendium surpassed all else in its comprehensiveness and influence on generations of ecologists: Southwood's <span class="italic">Ecological Methods</span> first appeared in 1966 and went through three editions by 2000, each extensively and conscientiously updated and otherwise revised. It was often referred to as the ecologist's bible.<br>
<br>Southwood had remarkable skills as an academic manager and leader. Imperial College recognized this early, appointing him head of the department of zoology and applied entomology, and at the same time, director of the field station at Silwood Park, in 1967. In the early 1970s he took on additional major roles, becoming the first chairman of Imperial College's newly formed division of life sciences in 1974. In 1979 he moved to Oxford University to become Linacre professor of zoology, head of the zoology department, and a professorial fellow at Merton College. At Imperial College he had built arguably the world's leading group of researchers in ecology and evolutionary biology. His arrival at Oxford closely followed the retirement or death of three of the twentieth century's major figures in these fields: David Lack, Charles Elton, and the Nobel laureate Niko Tinbergen. But under his skilful leadership the zoology department retained its status (as objectively evidenced by one quarter of all the prestigious Royal Society research professorships in the UK, four out of sixteen, being held in this one department). He did this helped by an extraordinary&#151;almost uncanny&#151;instinct for &#145;good people&#146;, matched by a clear vision of the needs, directions, and values of the department as a whole. Such good deeds do not go unpunished, and in 1989 he was appointed vice-chancellor of Oxford University (1989&#150;93), the first since 1632 who was not head of a college. In this post he initiated several important developments, including the beginning of significant reforms of governance, and a major fund-raising campaign (which exceeded its initial target by more than 50 per cent).<br>
<br>Southwood was never one of those academics to whom teaching was a chore. As head of department at Imperial College and later at Oxford (including the period of his vice-chancellorship) he gave the introductory lectures for first-year students, illustrating his belief that the introductory courses were the most important in any academic department. These lectures were the basis for his trade book, <span class="italic">The Story of Life</span> (2003), which was a masterly overview of the origin and evolution of living things.<h2>
<a name="Widerfields"></a>Wider fields</h2>Southwood's administrative skills were increasingly recognized in the wider world. Especially pleasing to him was his appointment in 1974 as a trustee of the British Museum (Natural History). During his four-year term as chairman of the trustees (1980&#150;83) he initiated a series of changes, responding to challenges in funding and the need for closer public engagement: an appropriately more diverse array of distinguished trustees, more visitors attracted to the museum (including more school parties), and an extraordinary increase in funds gathered from marketing and outside sponsors.<br>
<br>Arguably Southwood's most important achievement and legacy was ensuring the removal of lead from petrol in the UK. The royal commission on environmental pollution was set up early in 1970; he joined it in 1974, and served as chairman from 1981 to 1986. His first act as chairman was to evaluate the effectiveness of the commission's work, and its possible future direction. The resulting decision was to concentrate on a study of lead in the environment, about which there was growing concern at that time, particularly in regard to lead additives in petrol. There was, however, fierce resistance to total elimination of lead from petrol by a combination of interests (motor manufacturers, oil refiners, and driving organizations). Southwood deployed his skills to good effect, producing an appropriately trenchant and urgent report, and steering through the political shoals, recommending the total removal of all lead additives from petrol. Within days of the publication of <span class="italic">Lead in the Environment</span> in 1983, the secretary of state for the environment announced that all the commission's recommendations had been accepted. Appropriate legislation soon followed. In contrast with earlier unsuccessful efforts, Southwood's success owed much to the way his careful management of relations with officials and ministers had smoothed the way for this dramatic and satisfactory outcome (catching the opposition on the hop).<br>
<br>In 1988 Southwood was asked to bring his committee skills and biological knowledge to chairing, for the Department of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the working party on Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), in the wake of the outbreak of BSE or &#145;mad cow disease&#146; in Britain. This committee was established two years after BSE had been identified in British cattle and thus after a large number of infected animals had already entered the food chain. The issue was obviously highly sensitive, with a risk to human health if the disease could jump the species barrier, but also with serious economic consequences for the British farming industry if such risks were overstated. From the start Southwood's group were strongly critical of the aggressive changes in &#145;rendering practice&#146; that had resulted in the remains of cattle and sheep being fed to cattle. They regarded this as foolish on basic epidemiological and ecological grounds, and strongly recommended that such practices should stop forthwith. They further recommended that certain parts of the cow&#151;brains and offal&#151;should not enter the human food chain. Most of these recommendations were implemented in 1989, although not with the sense of urgency that Southwood wished. Southwood's study was, however, responsible for the changes in regulation of cattle feed that ended the epidemic in cattle, and for the changes in abattoir practices that kept infectious material out of the human food chain from then on.<br>
<br>At the time it was not known whether the BSE prion, if ingested by humans, could cause disease. By analogy with scrapie in sheep&#151;a disease whose aetiology in sheep is similar to BSE in cattle, which has been around in sheep for centuries, and which has no known effect on humans&#151;the best guess was that there would be no problem. This opinion was shared by essentially all informed scientists at the time. But this best guess was not a certainty, and Southwood's report was properly cautious, emphasizing the uncertainty and the need to address it. Unfortunately, the proper equivocation in Southwood's report was glossed over by ministers and civil servants anxious to reassure the public. When it became clear that indeed there was a connection between BSE in cattle and a new variant of the allied Creutzfeldt&#150;Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans, some sought to suggest that Southwood had not sufficiently emphasized the uncertainty. A retrospective reading of the report does not support this attempt to shift the blame.<br>
<br>Another major contribution to public life was Southwood's chairmanship (from 1994 to 1997) of the government's Round Table on Sustainable Development, in the aftermath of the 1992 world summit on sustainable development. Building on the good start he gave it, this body later transmogrified into the Sustainable Development Commission. Looking beyond the UK, Southwood played a major role in helping establish the environment programme at the nascent Central European University, established in 1991 with funding from George Soros to help bring students from the former Soviet Union and central and eastern European countries into the mainstream. There was a crying need for such a programme in eastern Europe at this time. Southwood was subsequently invited to become rector of the Central European University, when he stepped down as Oxford's vice-chancellor. He declined, but did continue to play a strong role in this institution's successful growth.<h2>
<a name="Honoursandfinalyears"></a>Honours and final years</h2>Southwood had an extraordinary influence on ecological and environmental science in Britain and more generally, partly through his own work but even more through the successive generations of younger colleagues whose careers he fostered. Some contemporaries saw the academic world as an increasingly competitive one; his emphasis was always on co-operation, and he took genuine pleasure in the achievements of others. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1977 (serving as vice-president in 1982&#150;4), and gave its prestigious Croonian lecture in 1995. He was also elected a foreign associate of the American National Academy of Sciences (1988), a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences (1992), an honorary foreign member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters (1987), a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (1995), and a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (1998). He was knighted in 1984, and appointed a deputy lieutenant of Oxfordshire in 1993. Besides other honours, four major overseas universities and nine British ones awarded him honorary degrees. Major academic awards included Imperial College's Huxley medal (1962), the Zoological Society's scientific medal (1969), the Linnean Society's gold medal (1988), and the Maria Theresa medal of Pavia University (1997). He was a fellow (trustee) of Eton College (1993&#150;2001), a member of the Rhodes Trust (1986&#150;2002; chairman, 1999&#150;2002), and an honorary member, member, or chairman of many other bodies, in the UK and elsewhere.<br>
<br>Southwood had earlier encounters with cancer, but had been in healthy remission for some time. The final recurrence came quickly, and he died peacefully at his home, April Cottage, 32 Upland Park Road, Oxford, on 26 October 2005. He was survived by his wife and their two sons.<br>
