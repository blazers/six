<span class="headword">Corry,  Isaac</span>  (1753&#150;1813), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born probably in Newry on 15 May 1753, the eldest son of Edward Corry (<i>d</i>. 1792), merchant and MP, and Catherine Bristow (1731&#150;1818), daughter of Captain Charles Bristow of Crebilly, co. Antrim. He was educated at the Royal School, Armagh, under its celebrated headmaster, Dr Grueder, and he entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 8 July 1768, graduating BA in 1773. He was admitted to the Middle Temple on 18 October 1771 and called to the Irish bar in 1779. He was unmarried but had a long-term relationship with Jane Symms; they had six children.<br>
<br>Corry succeeded his father as MP for Newry in 1776 and represented the constituency almost continuously for thirty years, first in the Irish parliament and from 1802 to 1806 in the imperial parliament. Commercial interests were a prime concern for Newry, because of its flourishing linen trade and its hopes of becoming a major port for the coal trade, both for its citizens and, given the potwalloping nature of the constituency, for its representatives. As might be expected Corry was appointed to the linen board in 1783. The principal political interests in the town were those of the Needham family, who backed Corry, and Lord Hillsborough, who described the town in 1784 as &#145;very little short of the factious violence of Belfast&#146;  (Malcomson, 5). During the 1776&#150;83 parliament Newry was divided by the issues of the movement for &#145;free trade&#146; and the volunteers. In August 1780, when the Newry Volunteers were reviewed, Corry was a captain and adjutant-general.<br>
<br>In the early 1780s Corry supported the fifth earl of Carlisle's administration but otherwise was generally in opposition. He also supported parliamentary reform and was then a friend of Grattan. In 1783 he opposed the government for not safeguarding the country's interest over Ireland's exclusion from the Methuen treaty on Portuguese trade, the East India Company, and parts of the 1660 <span class="roman">Navigation Act</span>. On the issue of trade the government feared the capacity of Corry and Henry Flood to stir up national agitation. In March 1785 the <span class="italic">Dublin Morning Post</span> described Corry as a &#145;zealous watchman&#146; of Irish interests and in 1787, at the time of the French commercial treaty, Corry emphasized the point that the Irish parliament should exercise their undoubted right and discuss it &#145;lest in the eyes of the British Minister they should appear altogether ignorant or neglectful&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parliamentary Register</span>, 7, 1787, 286). At the same time he admitted that the ultimate decision had to be made in the British parliament. He also pointed out that although France could provide Ireland with a market for her goods&#151;especially, it was hoped, linen&#151;nevertheless there was &#145;an opposition of natural interests, an opposition of political constitutions, an opposition of national views and therefore of national councils and conduct&#146;  (ibid., 287). Like almost all of the Irish opposition he was anxious to retain the British connection, writing that &#145;next to the preservation of our constitution and keeping the country out of debt&#146; the great object of his heart was &#145;to support the honour and interests of the British empire&#146;  (291&#150;2).<br>
<br>In 1783 it was thought that after the election Corry would &#145;apply for office, as he lives expensively and does not pursue his profession, which is the law&#146;. Although Henry Flood and Corry were not always in agreement, Flood's absence at Westminster gave Corry the leadership of the opposition. But although his oratorical skills were more than adequate he lacked Flood's pre-eminence. At this time it was thought that he placed his stakes too high, but in 1788 it was remarked that he &#145;speaks frequently, has Parliamentary talents, and [is] perhaps among the first in opposition&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dublin Morning Post</span>, 26 Jan 1788). These were gifts which no administration could afford to ignore, and he became surveyor-general of the ordnance in 1788, which carried with it a salary of &pound;1000 p.a. for doing &#145;virtually nothing&#146;; Corry, however, appears to have been fairly active in putting its affairs in order, much to the chagrin of the inmates. He probably got his instructions from the marquess of Buckingham, who, in both his viceroyalties, was determined to root out any waste or misdemeanours associated with inefficiency. The following year Corry was appointed a commissioner of the revenue. According to Richard Annesley, in April 1795 he &#145;attacked the FitzWilliam administration as vigorously as he had strongly supported it before&#146;  (Downshire MSS, D607/C/84).<br>
<br>Corry was made an Irish privy councillor on 18 August 1795. In 1798 he was elected chairman of the committee on ways and means, and finally in 1799 he was appointed chancellor of the exchequer and a lord of the Treasury in place of Sir John Parnell, who quarrelled violently with Pitt over the projected union, which he categorically refused to support. Although this decision was taken in London, Corry was blamed for Sir John's dismissal and for succeeding him. This was certainly irrational and probably very unjust as he was in fact the logical person to succeed Parnell both from abilities and experience. Furthermore, such a succession had precedents in the cases of Anthony Malone and John Foster. Under the 1793 <span class="roman">Place Act</span> Corry had to seek re-election on his appointment as chancellor and on 7 February 1799 the Catholic priest at Newry, Father Lennon, wrote to Archbishop Troy that &#145;Mr Corry was this day re-elected for the town of Newry&#146;  (Bolton, 136).<br>
<br>The national finances were in chaos and to help balance the budget Corry introduced a window tax, similar to that in England. This added to his unpopularity. Then, during a debate on the union on 17 February 1800, he accused Henry Grattan of &#145;living in familiarity with rebels and being a conniver at this plan to overthrow the country&#146;&#151;an opinion which was not unique to Corry  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of &hellip; Cornwallis</span>, 3.196). At the end of the debate Grattan challenged him to a duel which took place on the following morning. Although Corry was slightly wounded, the opposition accused him of trying to assassinate Grattan. Further unfortunate coincidences followed: the marquess of Downshire, a fervent anti-unionist, committed suicide on 7 September 1801, and the marchioness appears to have blamed Corry together with Castlereagh, and vowed vengeance on them. Next, Sir John Parnell died of apoplexy on 5 December. Meanwhile, the representation for Newry had been reduced to one seat by the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> and Corry was unlucky in the ballot that decided the continuing MP. At the time of the union he had agreed with Pitt and Castlereagh over the question of Catholic emancipation and this made it difficult to find him a seat, especially in view of the expressed hostility of the king, which brought him unwelcome notoriety. But as chancellor of the Irish exchequer he had to present the budget in parliament and he was returned, at Addington's instigation, for Lord Roden's borough of Dundalk.<br>
<br>In 1802 Corry was returned unopposed for Newry but he still aroused enmity, fuelled by a mixture of envy at his abilities and hostility to his origins. He presented the Irish budget to the Commons on 1 April 1801 and spoke only on Irish questions&#151;principally on financial matters. He overcame the opposition of John Foster to the plan for Irish finance legislation by arguing that Ireland should adopt the English system. He carried the <span class="roman">Irish Revenue Acts</span> in the 1802&#150;3 session but Foster refused to enlist with government while Corry remained. If he was to hold on to Newry he needed ever increasing patronage and his continual demands made him unpopular with the Irish administration. Finally, in May 1804, Corry was dismissed by Pitt in favour of Foster, but he was awarded &pound;2000 p.a. in compensation. He was not a steady Pitt supporter, and, perhaps not surprisingly, he was critical of Foster's budget. He voted for Catholic relief on 14 May 1805. Unlike many Irish members he appreciated and enjoyed the Westminster scene.<br>
<br>Meanwhile the political scene in Newry altered. The Needham estate passed to the senior branch of the Needham family, the viscounts Kilmorey, and Lord Kilmorey, assisted by Lady Downshire, decided to return his brother General Francis Needham at the general election of 1806. Corry was powerless against such &#145;real&#146; interest and he did not have the funds needed, in excess of &pound;5000, to purchase a seat elsewhere. However, Lady Downshire was inclined to support the Grenville ministry and came to a formal agreement with Corry to give him &pound;1000 towards his expenses should he be successful in Newry, and, if not, to bring him in for another borough. Corry failed against the Needham interest in Newry, but a seat at Newport, Isle of Wight, was purchased for him, with &pound;4000 from Lady Downshire, and Corry was appointed to the Board of Trade. Six months later Grenville's ministry had fallen and there was another general election. Corry stood, again unsuccessfully, for Newry.<br>
<br>Corry did not come into parliament again. His health was declining and, although he had been given a generous, if erratically paid, pension, he felt bitter at his loss of office and a seat in parliament, for which he blamed Foster. He died at his house in Merrion Square, Dublin, on 15 May 1813 and was buried in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. He was not without personal attractions. It was said in 1789 that:<blockquote>possessing from nature, a very pleasing exterior, Mr Corry loses not that advantage, by a slovenly neglect of it &hellip; His voice is remarkably good, clear, distinct, and melodious and equally adapted to thunder in the storm of impetuous eloquence, or to insinuate in the soothing accents of captivating persuasion. (Malcomson, 6)</blockquote>The story of the Corrys in the last quarter of the eighteenth century illustrates the exclusivity of the ascendancy, for whom wealth and birth counted more than talent.<br>
