<span class="headword">Hunter,  John Alexander</span>  (1882&#150;1963), <span class="occ">hunter</span>, was born on 3 June 1882 at Shearington, on the coast of the Solway Firth near Dumfries, one of the five children of David Hunter, a farmer, and his wife, Elizabeth. He was educated at local schools, after which he joined his father working the family farm, but his heart was not in agriculture. By his teens he was a keen hunter and a good shot, especially of geese and duck, and spent more time shooting and poaching than ploughing. At the age of twenty-six he was discovered to be having an affair with a married woman, and his parents persuaded him to emigrate to avoid a scandal. Having a distant relative dairy farming in British East Africa, he sailed for Mombasa, and arrived in 1908 with little more than his clothes and a Purdey shotgun. After working on the farm for a short time, he obtained employment on the railway. With the co-operation of locomotive drivers he shot big game from the trains and then sold the ivory and hides.<br>
<br>In the First World War, Hunter fought with distinction in German East Africa (now Tanzania) and then, upon demobilization, co-founded a transportation company delivering goods by wagon to outlying regions and began working for Safariland, one of the earliest safari operators. He married on 3 June 1918 Hilda Banbury (<i>d</i>. 1985), whose parents founded east Africa's first music shop in Nairobi in 1912; they had six children. In 1920, in collaboration with the famous gunmaker Morrison Shaw, he established the well-known Nairobi gunsmiths Shaw and Hunter. Two years later he set himself up as a professional hunter and joined the colonial government's game department.<br>
<br>Hunter's primary responsibility was to shoot marauding game, especially crop-destroying elephant or rhino and stock-killing lions. An expert shot with extraordinarily acute eyesight, he rarely failed to kill with a single bullet. He aided the cattle-herding Maasai, shooting 360 lion in one year and becoming a tribal legend. For a small fee tribal chiefs offered him ownership of the world-famous Ngorongoro crater by way of gratitude but Hunter could not afford the minimal payment. As a professional hunter he accompanied the famous explorers Martin and Osa Johnson to the Congo.<br>
<br>Widely known and liked in the hunting fraternity, Hunter was a member of the Professional Hunters' Association and a close friend of many prominent colonials. He was an intimate confidant of Denys Finch-Hatton, with whom he opened up Masai, and was the last person to see Finch-Hatton alive before his aircraft crashed at Voi in 1931. His acute sense of humour made him very popular and he was a great practical joker. On one occasion he came upon a fellow hunter's lion bait, a dead zebra. Creeping up, he placed a tobacco pipe in the zebra's mouth and withdrew to nearby cover to observe the consequences. The hunter arrived, approaching the bait with extreme caution&#151;then he saw the pipe. Hunter burst into uncontrollable laughter, his victim lost his temper and opened fire on him: Hunter fled, tears of mirth streaming down his face.<br>
<br>In addition to hunting, Hunter owned a small coffee farm near Kiambu and Clairmont, a guest house (which was also the family home) in Nairobi, much frequented by hunters. He also founded Hunter's Lodge, a celebrated wayside inn on the Nairobi&#150;Mombasa Road near Makindu. In later life he wrote four books about his hunting exploits, most famously his autobiographical <span class="italic">Hunter</span> (1952) and <span class="italic">Hunter's Tracks</span> (1957). He decried the destruction of wildlife and habitat by increased farming and population pressures, and was a dedicated naturalist and conservationist, frequently collecting specimens for the Natural History Museum in London. He died at Hunter's Lodge on 27 June 1963 and is buried at Langata cemetery, near Nairobi.<br>
