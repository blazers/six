<span class="headword">Wordsworth,  John</span>  (1843&#150;1911), <span class="occ">bishop of Salisbury</span>, eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29971/', "Christopher Wordsworth (1807&#150;1885)")</script>, and his wife, Susanna Hatley, daughter of George Frere, was born on 21 September 1843 at Harrow School, where his father was then headmaster; Christopher Wordsworth was later bishop of Lincoln, and was the nephew of the poet William Wordsworth. John's brother, the younger Christopher Wordsworth, was sometime fellow of Peterhouse, Cambridge. His sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37024/', "Elizabeth Wordsworth")</script> was the first principal of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford; another sister, Susan (<i>d</i>. 1912), was the first head of the Southwark Diocesan Society of Grey Ladies. John Wordsworth was taught first by a Mrs Wallace at Brighton, and then at Ipswich; he went to Winchester College as a pensioner, and in October 1861 became a scholar of New College, Oxford. He gained a first-class mark in classical moderations, though not in his finals, and took a second in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1865, when he was awarded his BA. He won the Latin essay prize in 1866 and the Craven scholarship in 1867, and he proceeded to an MA in 1868.<br>
<br>After a year as assistant master at Wellington College under Edward White Benson, afterwards archbishop of Canterbury, Wordsworth was elected in 1867 to a fellowship at Brasenose College, Oxford. He was ordained deacon (1867) and priest (1869) by Bishop Wilberforce of Oxford, and became chaplain of Brasenose College. In 1870 he was appointed as examining chaplain and was collated to a prebend in Lincoln Cathedral by his father, who had just been made bishop of Lincoln. In the same year he married Susan Esther (<i>d</i>. 1894), daughter of the librarian Henry Octavius Coxe. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Although Wordsworth was initially interested in divinity, his work at Brasenose was mainly classical. In 1874 he published <span class="italic">Fragments and Specimens of Early Latin</span>, a standard text for many years, though its philology dated quickly. The publication gave him the reputation of being one of the best Latin scholars in Oxford, however, and he soon applied himself to biblical study. In 1878 Oxford University Press accepted a proposal from him for the publication of a critical edition of the <span class="roman">Vulgate New Testament</span> which would attempt to recapture the exact words of St Jerome. He began to collect his material, engaging assistants to collate western-European manuscripts, and examining earlier collations (such as those of Richard Bentley and John Walker). They purchased unused material of Constantin Tischendorf and searched the works of the patristic writers for quotations. Wordsworth fulfilled all the requirements of palaeographical, grammatical, historical, and exegetical knowledge, and his notes and indices were known for their erudition.<br>
<br>As a preliminary to the substantive publication, certain important manuscripts were from 1883 onwards printed in full in <span class="italic">Old Latin Biblical Texts</span>. In this task Wordsworth was helped by William Sanday and some other scholars, later including the Revd Henry Julian White, professor of <span class="roman">New Testament</span> studies in King's College, London. The four gospels were printed in 1889 (<span class="roman">St Matthew</span>), 1891 (<span class="roman">St Mark</span>), 1892 (<span class="roman">St Luke</span>), and 1895 (<span class="roman">St John</span>). An <span class="italic">Epilogus</span> of discussions and results followed in 1898, the whole forming a quarto volume of over 800 pages. The <span class="roman">Acts</span> appeared in 1905. White continued the work after Wordsworth's death, with the assistance of the Revd George Mallows Youngman. Before his death Wordsworth published a minor edition of the whole <span class="roman">Vulgate New Testament</span>, which appeared in 1912. Although he grew less involved in the work in his latter years, he retained full knowledge of every detail and gave the final decision on doubtful questions.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Wordsworth had gained high office at Oxford and in the Church of England. In 1877 J. B. Mozley, regius professor of divinity, chose him as his deputy, and he served as deputy professor for two years. The lectures he wrote during that time formed the basis for the Bampton lectures of 1881. Entitled &#145;The one religion&#146;, they provided a comparison of Christianity with other great religions. Wordsworth was neither an orientalist nor a philosopher; but the Bampton lectures show his strong interest in missionary work. He was among the founders of the Oxford Missionary Association of Graduates, and of St Stephen's House, which was designed to prepare members of the university for mission life. In 1883 he was elected as the first incumbent of a newly founded Oriel professorship of the interpretation of scripture. The post carried with it the sinecure of the canonry of Rochester, where Wordsworth threw himself into the work both of the church and of the cathedral. Two years later he was nominated to the see of Salisbury in succession to George Moberly. He was consecrated bishop on 28 October 1885, and was made DD at Oxford in the same year. Thereafter, his duties as bishop had to take precedence over his literary work (apart from the <span class="roman">Vulgate</span>).<br>
<br>Succeeding to a well-administered diocese, without the problem of an increasing population, Wordsworth was able to devote much of his time to the general policy of the church. He developed his knowledge of ecclesiastical law. He was fearless in risking litigation and became the first to exercise the power under the <span class="roman">Pluralities Act Amendment Act</span> (1898), under which a bishop could, at the expense of an incompetent priest, appoint a new curate to his neglected parish. He also revived the canonical right of examining and rejecting, on the score of insufficient learning, the presentee to a benefice. His diocesan work in the field of education involved efforts to maintain elementary church schools. He also founded and endowed the Bishop's School at Salisbury for the secondary co-education of boys and girls, a progressive step at the time. Wordsworth's influence inside the Church of England was especially powerful. He was close to Archbishop Benson, and his assistance proved indispensable to Benson's successors. He was one of the assessors in the bishop of Lincoln's case in 1889&#150;90, and he studied the relevant law and history in order to give a reasoned judgment.<br>
<br>Wordsworth believed in the ideal of a unified church. However, although in practice a tolerant man, he had inherited much of his father's antipathy towards Rome, and he was firmly of the view that the differences between Catholicism and the Church of England were wide. He acknowledged the intellectual and scholarly strength of the Roman Catholic scholars, but lost no opportunity to assert his church's claims to antiquity or superiority. He watched the growth of the Old Catholics in Austria and was always alert to signs of internal revolt in the Roman Catholic church. Wordsworth saw the churches' only hope of unity as lying in a general recognition of episcopacy. It was through this commonly held understanding that he felt drawn to the Orthodox Swedish and Moravian churches; and he was energetic in the negotiation of terms of possible association. His last work, the Hale lectures, delivered at Chicago in 1910, and published in England in 1911, on the national church of Sweden, was inspired by this motive. Although composed in ill health, it was a substantial and original contribution to religious history and was translated into Swedish.<br>
<br>In his <span class="italic">De successione episcoporum in ecclesia Anglicana</span> (1890) and <span class="italic">De validitate ordinum Anglicanorum</span> (1894), he attempted to refute what he saw as the scruples of the Jansenist Church of Holland. He continued the correspondence throughout his life, though his hopes were never fully realized.<br>
<br>Wordsworth also made some efforts to continue the attempts of his uncle, Charles Wordsworth, to draw together the episcopal and presbyterian churches of Scotland. His elaborate history of his uncle's episcopate, published in 1899, and his later researches, such as his <span class="italic">Ordination Problems</span> (1909) and <span class="italic">Unity and Fellowship</span> (1910), were concerned with examining precedents for the absorption of apparently imperfect fringe religious societies into approved and recognized religious groups. In addition he wrote much on practical ministry, drawing inspiration from history; he published <span class="italic">Holy Communion</span> (1910) and <span class="italic">Ministry of Grace</span> (1901, 1902). The latter is a history of the Christian ministry. Wordsworth remained conservative in his attitudes towards criticism of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, where history showed institutions and scripture to be authoritative.<br>
<br>In his preaching Wordsworth showed himself equally sure of his ground, both scripturally and historically. He spoke impressively and often with originality. He read widely on the local and national history of his diocese and kept abreast of current affairs. Though he was an accomplished critic and writer of Latin, he was not greatly interested in style in English literature, but he admired the moral tones of his great-uncle's poetry. He was made honorary LLD of Dublin in 1890, of Cambridge in 1908, and honorary DD of Bern in 1892. In 1905 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy. Wordsworth's first wife died in 1894, and on 2 January 1896 he married Mary Anne Frances (1870&#150;1938), eldest daughter of Sir Robert Williams, first baronet, MP for West Dorset; they had four sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Wordsworth died suddenly at the bishop's palace, Salisbury, on 16 August 1911. He was buried on 19 August at Britford, near Salisbury. His wife survived him. Bishop Wordsworth is memorable for his contributions to theological studies and for his efforts in trying to unite different churches on the basis of episcopacy. A memorial and choir stalls were also erected in his honour in Salisbury Cathedral.<br>
