<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Randolph,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1605, <em>d.</em> 1635), <span class="occ">poet and playwright</span>, eldest son of William Randolph (1572&#150;1660) and his first wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Smith of Newnham, near Daventry, in Northamptonshire, was born in his maternal grandfather's house and baptized in Newnham church on 15 June 1605.<h2>
<a name="Familybackgroundandearlylife"></a>Family background and early life</h2>Randolph's father originated from Hamsey, near Lewes, in Sussex. According to Aubrey, who had most of his information from a brother of the poet, William Randolph had been &#145;very wild in his youth&#146;, was disinherited, and became steward to a local landowner, Sir George Goring  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 2.195&#150;8). Later he settled at Little Houghton, near Northampton, and served in the same capacity Edward, eleventh Baron Zouche (<i>d</i>. 1625), who had a house at Harringworth in the north of the county. His younger children William (<i>b</i>. 1607), Robert (1611&#150;1671), and Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1613) were baptized at Little Houghton, as were the seven children of his subsequent marriage, on 30 March 1619, to Dorothy West, sister of Sir Richard Lane, lord keeper under Charles I.<br>
<br>At the age of nine Thomas Randolph wrote a &#145;History of the incarnation of our Saviour&#146; in English verse, the manuscript of which, says Aubrey, was &#145;kept as a rarity&#146; by his half-brother John (1620&#150;1680). At an unknown date he was elected a king's scholar at Westminster School, where contemporaries included William Cartwright, the younger Donne, William Hemminges, son of the editor of the first folio, the Grecian James Duport, and Richard Busby, the future headmaster. He proved a brilliant student. Archdeacon Thomas Plume records a story told him by John Hacket that John Williams, when dean of Westminster, had singled out the ten-year-old Randolph to make extempore verses on subjects set by the dukes of Richmond and Buckingham and Sir Fulke Greville  (<span class="italic">Essex Review</span>, 14, 1905, 19). The occasion is likely to have been one of the annual Rogation week election dinners held after Williams became dean in July 1620. Latin verse-composition formed an important element of the curriculum, and Duport long after placed Randolph, with Cartwright and Abraham Cowley, among its leading practitioners  (Duport, <span class="italic">Musae subsecivae</span>, 1676, 75&#150;7). The school maintained a strong dramatic tradition, and the headmaster, Lambert Osbaldeston, had himself recently acted in Robert Burton's <span class="italic">Philosophaster</span>. Some verses prefaced to the posthumous <span class="italic">Poems</span> of 1638 by Randolph's stepbrother Richard West assert that he:<blockquote>
<div>had not long of Playes Spectatour beene<br>
</div>
<div>But his small Feete wore <i>Socks</i> fit for the Scene.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Here also he seems to have begun writing occasional verse, supplying two monumental epitaphs for the abbey cloisters on the surveyor William Laurence and the organist John Parsons. In May 1623 he was elected as head of the school to a scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge, which, following the current practice, he took up a year later, entering on 9 April 1624 and matriculating as pensioner on 8 July  (CUL, UA, Matr. 2).<h2>
<a name="Universityandliterarycareer"></a>University and literary career</h2>In 1625 Randolph framed the first of several contributions in Latin verse to university congratulatory volumes on royal events and in the following year the longest of the elegies published in <span class="italic">Manes Verulamianae</span>, the Trinity-inspired memorial volume for Bacon. Thomas Fuller attributes to him some lost verses on the discovery of a book in the belly of a cod-fish at Cambridge market on midsummer eve 1626  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 1662, 359). Above all, Randolph found ample scope to develop his talent for drama. His first attempt may have been the free rendering of Aristophanes' <span class="italic">Plutus</span> which, as <span class="italic">Hey for honesty, down with knavery</span>, was to form the basis for the version published by Francis Jacques in 1651. <span class="italic">Aristippus</span>, described as &#145;A Private shewe presented on a Fast night to the Seniours and fellowes of Trinitie&#146;  (Washington, DC, Folger Shakespeare Library, MS V.b.320), recommends to young students not the cyrenaic sage but the canary wine colloquially known by his name. Contemporary printed editions, where it is subtitled <span class="italic">The Joviall Philosopher</span>, follow it with <span class="italic">The Conceited Pedlar</span>, a witty monologue dated in one manuscript to All Saints' day 1627  (BL, Add. MS 27406).<br>
<br>In the same term of this, his third, year Randolph presided as &#145;father&#146; at the informal initiation ceremony or &#145;salting&#146; of freshmen in the college hall, delivering in verse a series of comic sketches of each of his &#145;sons&#146;. By the time that his name appeared eighth in the <i>ordo senioritatis</i> of BAs in the following Lent all available college fellowships had been filled. On 11 August 1629 he was sent by the retiring master, Leonard Mawe, to the chancellor of the university, Lord Holland, with a letter of recommendation citing the support of Williams, then lord keeper, for a fellowship by royal mandate. This describes him as a person &#145;of those extraordinary parts of wit and learning &hellip; that scarce an age doth bring forth a better or the like&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, ed. Thorn-Drury, xi&#150;xii); he was admitted minor fellow on 22 September. In the same year he contributed prefatory Latin lines to Huntingdon Plumptre's <span class="italic">Epigrammat&#333;n opusculum</span> and an epithalamium on the marriage of Lord Goring with Lettice Boyle on 25 July.<br>
<br>It is uncertain when Randolph first made the acquaintance of Ben Jonson, an old Westminster of an earlier generation, though a possible connection was through his father's employer and Jonson's friend, Lord Zouche  (Bridges, 2.320). &#145;A gratulatory to M<sup>r</sup> Ben Johnson for his adopting of him to be his Son&#146; was probably written after the older man's disabling stroke in the winter of 1628&#150;9. However, the circumstances of his adoption as described by William Winstanley (<span class="italic">Poor Robin's Jests</span>, 1667) in the famous anecdote of Randolph's paying his reckoning at the Devil tavern not in coin but with the extempore epigram &#145;I John Bo-peep&#146; are elsewhere applied to Drummond of Hawthornden  (<span class="italic">The Works of William Drummond</span>, 1711, ix). Randolph's mollifying answer to the &#145;Ode to Himself&#146; that Jonson wrote in response to the hostile reception of <span class="italic">The New Inn</span> probably belongs to early spring 1629. In the following year his prospects suddenly broadened. No sooner had rival editions of <span class="italic">Aristippus</span> and <span class="italic">The Conceited Pedlar</span> been entered in the Stationers' register in March and April than plague forced the closure of both the Cambridge colleges and the London theatres until the autumn. According to notes taken by Malone from a lost office-book of Sir Henry Herbert, the King's Revels company produced Randolph's <span class="italic">The Entertainment</span> that summer in the provinces; its more familiar title is given in some verses on the &#145;<i>Play called the</i> Entertainment, <i>printed by the name of the</i> Muses' looking-glass&#146; (1638) in Sir Aston Cokayne's <span class="italic">Chayne of Golden Poems</span> (1658). This series of portraits of the virtues and vices, paraded before two puritan critics to persuade them of the moral seriousness of drama, was licensed on 25 November to the Children of the Revels, probably for performance at the reopening of the Salisbury Court theatre. A similar licence was granted on 26 November to the pastoral drama <span class="italic">Amyntas</span>, a blend of high-flown Italian pastoral with English humour and farce which, subtitled &#145;the impossible dowry&#146;, was later acted before the king and queen at Whitehall, probably in 1631. A third piece, &#145;Praeludium&#146;, a brief dialogue between an actor and a theatregoer ascribed by the future Chancellor Hyde to &#145;T. Randall after the last Plague&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 37425, fols. 54&#150;5), was probably written for the same occasion.<br>
<br>On 5 July 1631 Randolph figured sixth in the <i>ordo</i> of MAs and incorporated at Oxford in the same year. On 10 February 1632 the college conclusion book recorded the grant of &#145;allowances &hellip; agaynst the Kyngs coming, for comedyes&#146;, and Randolph's <span class="italic">The Jealous Lovers</span>, later dedicated to the master, Thomas Comber, as &#145;a thing born at your command&#146;, was ready by 7 March  (Nelson, 1.636&#150;43). This Jonsonian comedy in blank verse draws on his earlier play, &#145;The drinking academy&#146;, which survives anonymously in manuscript. In the event the royal visit was postponed to 19 February, when Trinity's offering was obliged to take second place to the Queens' College comedy, Peter Hausted's <span class="italic">The Rival Friends</span>, which was poorly received. Though the edition of Hausted's play published in London in June ascribes its failure to inter-collegiate rivalry&#151;&#145;Cryed downe by Boyes, Factions, Envie, and confident Ignorance&#146;&#151;rumour put down to royal displeasure the suicide of the vice-chancellor, Dr Henry Butts, who had granted it precedence. Randolph, whose <span class="italic">Jealous Lovers</span> staged on the following day was pronounced &#145;not onely more compendious, but more facetious&#146;  (ibid., 1.636), could not resist a gloating allusion in the satirical Latin speech that he delivered at Great St Mary's in July as prevaricator during the commencement ceremonies. The text of his play, printed soon after by the university press, includes commendatory verses by Francis Meres and Duport alongside dedicatory poems to Thomas Riley, the principal actor, Sir Christopher, later Lord, Hatton, Anthony Stafford, Lane, and Osbaldeston. Oldys records a highly improbable story that the royal visit was the occasion of an exchange with Henrietta Maria in Latin verse  (BL, MS C.45.d.14, p. 413).<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsdeathandreputation"></a>Final years, death, and reputation</h2>Five days after the performance the college elected Randolph to a major fellowship, but from this point his career enters an uncertain phase. In the &#145;Eglogue to M<sup>r</sup> Johnson&#146;, written at some time after the success of <span class="italic">The Jealous Lovers</span>, he laments leaving the university and his Aristotelian studies for the unruliness of theatrical life: the intriguing phrase &#145;Call'd hence to keep the flock of Corydon&#146; has been taken to indicate a role in the management of the Salisbury Court, though hard evidence is wanting. It is commonly assumed that he &#145;indulged with increasing ardour in the dissipations of London literary life&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), though the loss of his finger in a tavern brawl had already been mentioned in his Latin speech of July. If an undated anecdote is to be believed he was forced to adopt a clever subterfuge by which he:<blockquote>being thrust out of his fellowship desired a <i>bene discessit</i> [honourable discharge], which being obtained, he presented to the King, saying he could prove under the hands of the head &amp; all the fellowes that he was expelled undeservingly, whereupon he was reestablished in his place againe. (Bodl. Oxf., MS Wood F.31, fol. 104<i>v</i>)</blockquote>In July 1633 he contributed a Latin hexastich to the Cambridge congratulatory volume on the king's return from Scotland, and sixty hexameters to the fourteen Latin pieces collected there in September for the <span class="italic">Mausoleum Mauritianum</span> in memory of Landgraf Moritz of Hesse-Cassel.<br>
<br>Randolph met his end in his native county, to which he had retained a deep attachment. Following a period allegedly spent in his &#145;delightful studies&#146; at his father's house at Little Houghton  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.566) he was offered the generous sum of &pound;100 per year to take a post some 25 miles to the north-west as tutor to Edward (<i>d</i>. 1638), eldest son of the William Stafford (<i>d</i>. 1637) of Blatherwycke whose second marriage he celebrated in 1634 with a pastoral eclogue. Some undated verses to his &#145;Aunt&#146; Lane mention an attack by smallpox, and his constitution may already have been undermined. Without doubt he was popular and gregarious: both Duport and Wood attribute his death in the following year to a readiness to match the conviviality of admiring friends. Thomas Bancroft wrote that:<blockquote>
<div>he dranke too greedily<br>
</div>
<div>O' th'Muses Spring<br>
</div> (Bancroft, <span class="italic">Two Bookes of Epigrammes</span>, 1639, bk 1, no. 8)</blockquote>and the charge was repeated by the sneering poet in the first act of his contemporary Robert Wild's comedy <span class="italic">The Benefice</span>, who likened Randolph to Tom a Bedlam, concluding:<blockquote>
<div>Pitty! So rare a Fancy should have found<br>
</div>
<div>An <i>Helicon</i> so deep as to be drown'd.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Randolph was buried on 17 March 1635 in Blatherwyck church, on the south side, at the lower end of the north chancel, the register describing him as &#145;one of the fellowes of Trinity Colledge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, ed. Thorn-Drury, xix, n. 3). In the summer of 1640 Hatton, Stafford's neighbour at Kirby Hall, paid &pound;10 to Nicholas Stone the younger for the mural tablet of white marble that incorporated the English verses by Hausted which Aubrey dismisses as &#145;puerile&#146;. The posthumous collection of <span class="italic">Poems with the Muses Looking Glasse and Amyntas</span> (1638), brought out at Oxford by Randolph's brother Robert&#151;himself promoted by Wood as &#145;a most ingenious poet&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>: <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, 1.430)&#151;was said by West to comprise &#145;but's Ashes, which were throwne about&#146;. Owen Felltham was among the ten writers who contributed commendatory verses, and a copy of &#145;the late <i>R</i>'s Poems&#146; had apparently reached Sir Henry Wotton bound up with Milton's <span class="italic">Comus</span> by April 1638. The enlarged edition that followed in 1640 incorporates an engraved portrait, the unsigned work of William Marshall, that was validated by Aubrey from the testimony of contemporaries:<blockquote>From Mr. Needler:&#151;his haire was of a very light flaxen, almost white &hellip; It was flaggy, as by his picture before his booke appeares. He was of a pale ill complexion and pock-pitten&#151;from Mr. Thomas Fludd, his scholefellow at Westminster, who sayes he was of about my stature or scarce so tall.</blockquote>The collection proved popular, and was reissued no fewer than five times between 1643 and 1668. Among its strengths are its epithalamia, love poems, songs, and above all pastoral pieces, from amatory dialogues like &#145;A pastorall courtship&#146; to the rustic eclogue on Robert Dover's Cotswold games  (<span class="italic">Annalia Dubrensia</span>, 1636). The style is throughout fluent and fertile and the tone good-humoured. In the field of drama some contemporaries, rather too eagerly, hailed him as Jonson's natural successor; the major plays were frequently reprinted at the time and continued to attract praise from Langbaine (1691) to the <span class="italic">Biographia dramatica</span> (1812). The first substantial collection of Randolph's works was brought out by W. C. Hazlitt in 1875, and modern scholarly interest began with editions of the poems by Parry (1917) and Thorn-Drury (1929) and the researches of G. C. Moore-Smith in the intervening years. The canon, nevertheless, remains fluid  (Beal, 189&#150;92): the Latin comedy <span class="italic">Cornelianum dolium</span>, published in 1638 as by &#145;T. R.&#146;, has been proposed as a refashioning of Randolph's work by Richard Braithwait, while forty-two poems not printed in the 1640 edition are attributed to him in manuscript verse anthologies of the time.<br>
