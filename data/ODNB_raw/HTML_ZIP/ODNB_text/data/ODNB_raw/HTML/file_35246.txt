<span class="headword">Nodal,  John Howard</span>  (1831&#150;1909), <span class="occ">journalist and dialectologist</span>, was born on 19 September 1831 in Downing Street, Ardwick, Manchester, the son of Aaron Nodal (1798&#150;1855), a Quaker grocer and town councillor. He was a member of the Society of Friends and was educated at Ackworth School, Yorkshire (1841&#150;5), a Quaker school. His first employment, aged seventeen, was as a clerk at the Electric Telegraph Company in Manchester, where he later became manager of the news department. From 1850 to 1853 he also acted as secretary of the Manchester Working Men's College. On 14 June 1859 he married Helen, daughter of Lawrence Wilkinson; the couple had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Nodal began early to contribute to the local press and he edited the <span class="italic">Volunteer Journal</span> during the volunteer movement of 1860&#150;62. His career as a full-time journalist began in January 1864, when he was appointed sub-editor of the daily <span class="italic">Manchester Courier</span>. From 1867 to 1870 he occupied a similar position on the <span class="italic">Manchester Examiner and Times</span> while also editing (1866&#150;8) the <span class="italic">Free Lance</span>, a humorous and satirical Manchester weekly, and founding and editing (1868&#150;71) <span class="italic">The Sphinx</span>, a weekly periodical of art and literature. In 1871 he became editor of the ailing <span class="italic">Manchester City News</span>, remaining there until 1904 and transforming it into a popular and financially successful journal. He was instrumental in moulding its policy and ideals, and it quickly came to reflect his wide-ranging interests not only in the public life of Manchester but also in local work on science, literature, and language. On the model of <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>, to which he was a regular contributor, Nodal established &#145;City News notes and queries&#146; within the main newspaper. This developed into an independent periodical (8 vols., 1878&#150;89) which he edited. <span class="italic">Country Notes: a Journal of Natural History and Out-Door Observation</span> (2 vols., 1882&#150;3), which he also edited, similarly originated in articles in the <span class="italic">Manchester City News</span>. From 1875 to 1885 he was on the staff of the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>.<br>
<br>Nodal played a prominent role in the Manchester Literary Club, editing volumes 1 to 6 of its <span class="italic">Papers</span> (1874&#150;80) and serving as president (1873&#150;9) and vice-president (1879&#150;86). A founder member of the club's glossary committee (1872), which aimed to compile a Lancashire glossary, he published his <span class="italic">Dialect and Archaisms of Lancashire</span> (1873) as part of its first report. Upon the relocation of the English Dialect Society from Cambridge to Manchester, he took over as honorary secretary (1876&#150;94) from its founder, W. Skeat, with whom he worked on the <span class="italic">Bibliographical List of &hellip; the Various Dialects of English</span> (vols. 1&#150;3, 1873&#150;7), editing the third volume (1877). He published (with George Milner) <span class="italic">The New Glossary of the Lancashire Dialect</span> (pt 1, &#145;A&#150;E&#146;, 1875), which was widely and favourably reviewed; part 2 appeared in 1882. Nodal was actively involved in the collection of local material for the <span class="italic">English Dialect Dictionary</span> (6 vols., 1896&#150;1905), edited by Joseph Wright. In 1878 he established the English Dialect Library in the Central Free Library in Manchester. He also played a major part in founding the Manchester Arts Club (1879). He published a variety of other works on local artistic, literary, and bibliographical matters, including <span class="italic">Special Collections of Books in Lancashire and Cheshire</span> (1880) and <span class="italic">The Bibliography, Biographical and Topographical, of Ackworth School</span> (1889).<br>
<br>After his first wife's death Nodal married Edith, daughter of Edmund and Anne Robinson of Warrington, Lancashire. He died, aged seventy-eight, on 13 November 1909 at his home, The Grange, 6 Clifton Road, Heaton Moor, near Stockport, and was interred at the Society of Friends' burial-ground at Ashton upon Mersey, near Salford.<br>
