<span class="headword">Oldcastle,  Hugh</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1543), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and author of a text on double entry accounting</span>, was the third and youngest son of Richard Oldcastle (<i>d</i>. 1520), a shearman carrying on his trade in the city of London, and his wife, Joan (Johane). The date of Hugh's birth is unknown but he was alive in 1510 when he is mentioned in his father's will written that year. Richard Oldcastle bequeathed to Hugh property at Almeley in Herefordshire which formerly belonged to Sir John Oldcastle, an ancestor of the family. Hugh Oldcastle was involved in legal actions relating to the property, suggesting, as does his own failure to make a will, that he was unable to take possession of it. He died intestate early in 1543 in Hart Street (off Mark Lane) in the parish of St Olave, Hart Street, next to the Tower of London, where he had been a teacher of arithmetic and bookkeeping. Administration of his estate was granted to his widow, Anice, on 28 February 1543.<br>
<br>Oldcastle's widow arranged the publication in book form by John Gough on 14 August 1543 of the manuscript from which Oldcastle may have taught bookkeeping; the title was <span class="italic">Here ensueth a profitable treatyce called the instrument or boke to learne to knowe the good order of the kepying of the famouse reconying, called in Latyn dare et habere, and in Englyshe debitor and creditor</span>. No copy of the book is extant (the last certain reference is in a sale catalogue of 1799) but a revised edition was published in 1588 by John Mellis, a schoolmaster and teacher of arithmetic of St Olave Southwark. Mellis retitled the book <span class="italic">A briefe instruction and maner how to keepe bookes of accompts after the order of debitor and creditor</span>. He did not state the title of his original but, unusually for that period, wrote in his preface that he was &#145;but the renuer and reviver of an auncient old copie &hellip; collected, published, made and set forth by one Hugh Oldcastle Scholemaster&#146;, adding that he had &#145;bewtified and enlarged&#146; Oldcastle's text. Although Mellis does not acknowledge it, he also borrowed from the works on bookkeeping of James Peele, father of George Peele the poet, and of John Weddington. Yamey argues that Mellis's work is &#145;not to be treated as an even approximately faithful reproduction of the Oldcastle text&#146;  (Yamey, 216). Mellis added an illustrative set of account books.<br>
<br>Oldcastle's book owed much to the first printed exposition on double entry by Luca Pacioli, <span class="italic">Particularis de computis et scripturis</span>, which formed part of his <span class="italic">Summa di arithmetica geometria proportioni et proportionalit&agrave;</span> published in Venice in 1494. The extent to which Oldcastle's work is a translation of Pacioli is a matter on which historians of accounting have disagreed. It has been argued that both are based on a source which existed only in manuscript form and perhaps in Latin rather than Italian but no such manuscript has been discovered. Oldcastle occasionally mistranslates from the Italian (confusing, for example, <i>cassa</i> and <i>casa</i>) and shows a preference for Latin terms (<i>dare &amp; habere, capsa, lucrum et damnum</i>) rather than their Italian equivalents.<br>
<br>Oldcastle may be responsible for the adoption of the word &#145;ledger&#146; to describe the principal double entry book of account rather than &#145;great book&#146; as in other European languages. His importance in the history of accounting is as the first expositor in English of double entry, the main technique of modern accounting. Neither he nor his &#145;reviver&#146; Mellis was an innovator. Both were plagiarized in part by John Carpenter in his <span class="italic">A most excellent instruction</span> (1632).<br>
