<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stafford,  Ralph</span>, first earl of Stafford  (1301&#150;1372), <span class="occ">soldier and magnate</span>, was the elder son and heir of Edmund de Stafford, first Lord Stafford (1273&#150;1308), and Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1337), daughter of Ralph, first Lord Basset (<i>d</i>. 1299), of Drayton, Staffordshire.<h2>
<a name="Backgroundandearlycareer"></a>Background and early career</h2>At the time of Ralph's birth, on 24 September 1301, the Staffords exercised considerable influence in the west midlands, but had yet to assume the prominent role in national affairs that fell to them as a result of his own success as a soldier, administrator, and courtier. The bulk of their estates lay in Staffordshire and Warwickshire, with a few additional holdings in Oxfordshire and Lincolnshire, and generated an annual income of about &pound;200 net. This was not enough to support a senior member of the English baronage, although Edmund de Stafford had sufficiently distinguished himself in the Scottish wars of Edward I to merit a personal summons to parliament. The path of advancement through military service was followed with distinction by his son, whose lasting achievement was to elevate his family to the ranks of the higher nobility.<br>
<br>Having lost his father as a child, Ralph Stafford had come of age and entered his estates by December 1323. He spent his youth in the society of his mother's Staffordshire relatives and of her second husband, a local landowner named Thomas Pipe. Stafford's first known experience of royal service occurred in 1325, when he, his younger brothers, and their stepfather joined the retinue of his maternal uncle, Ralph, second Lord Basset of Drayton. Soon, however, he grew more independent. He was made a knight-banneret in January 1327, being recruited to fight against the Scots shortly afterwards. His support for the plot to free the young Edward III from the control of his mother's lover, Roger Mortimer, earned him the king's lasting gratitude, and marked the beginning of what was to become a close personal relationship. Mortimer's arrest at Nottingham Castle during the parliament of October 1330 enabled Edward to seize the reins of power himself.<br>
<br>By the summer of 1332 Stafford had become a commissioner of the peace in Staffordshire, and had been sent abroad on royal business with Hugh, Lord Audley. In August of that year he embarked on an expedition in support of Edward Balliol, claimant to the Scottish throne. With considerable expertise, the English captains contrived a difficult landing at Kinghorn, and, in the face of heavy odds, defeated the Scots on 11 August at Dupplin Moor near Perth. Stafford himself enabled the English archers to withstand a lethal onslaught from the Scottish spearmen by ordering them to adopt different tactics. Between 1334 and 1337 he took part in three more Scottish campaigns, being accompanied across the border in October 1336 by his second wife, Margaret Audley.<h2>
<a name="Socialadvancement"></a>Social advancement</h2>The death of Stafford's first wife, Katherine, a daughter of Sir John Hastang of Chebsey, Staffordshire, left him free to make a more ambitious match, in keeping with his social and political aspirations. This he did with characteristic <i>&eacute;lan</i>, by reputedly abducting and marrying Margaret, the sole heir of his fellow envoy, Lord Audley, and his wife, also Margaret, the latter being one of the three sisters and coheirs of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5439/', "Gilbert de Clare, earl of Gloucester and Hertford (d. 1314)")</script>. At a conservative estimate, the girl's inheritance was worth at least &pound;2314 a year, more than ten times the value of Stafford's own modest patrimony. It also promised to establish the Staffords as a powerful presence in the south of England and the Welsh marches. Audley's third of the Clare estates stretched from Norfolk to Wiltshire, and also included the lordships of Kilkenny in Ireland and Newport in Wales. Yet, although Audley began legal proceedings against his new son-in-law in July 1336, a degree of collusion, on King Edward's part at least, seems apparent. Just a few months later, on 29 November, Stafford was summoned to parliament as Lord Stafford, as his father had been before him. He continued to enjoy repeated marks of royal favour, and was soon serving alongside Audley in Scotland, his misdemeanours forgiven, if not forgotten.<br>
<br>Plans for a war against the French took King Edward abroad in 1338, and Stafford joined his entourage as a trusted adviser. He accompanied the king on journeys to and from England, and was present on 24 June 1340 at the celebrated naval battle of Sluys. Lack of money forced Edward to return home again, in November 1340, for a dramatic confrontation with his ministers. Prominent among them was Archbishop John Stratford, who retreated to Canterbury. Stafford was twice sent to harangue him into submission, but the archbishop insisted on defending himself before parliament. Stafford was, meanwhile, made steward of the royal household on 6 January 1341, in a purge of the existing administration which placed soldiers with little experience of government in positions of authority.<br>
<br>Many noblemen resented these developments: when Stafford and two other newly appointed officials attempted to prevent the archbishop from attending parliament on 23 April, the Earl Warenne protested that the social order had been reversed. Such <i>gentz de mester</i>  (<span class="italic">Chroniques de London</span>, 90), who were little more than servants, had no place in the House of Lords, he claimed. Stafford and his companions allegedly left the chamber in shame, but however humiliated he may have felt he still refused to take the oath demanded of him and the other royal favourites by their opponents. Edward rewarded his loyalty soon afterwards with a grant of mercantile privileges in Warwickshire and Staffordshire.<h2>
<a name="ServiceinFrance"></a>Service in France</h2>The theatre of war now moved to Brittany, where Stafford began campaigning in August 1342 with a personal retinue of about 150 men. Under the command of the earl of Northampton, he helped to relieve the port of Brest, devastated the surrounding countryside, and on 30 September inflicted a crushing defeat on the French force that had been sent to raise the siege of Morlaix. But after Edward III's arrival Stafford's luck ran out. He was captured outside the walls of Vannes, and many of his men were killed. An exchange of prisoners left him free to negotiate a truce at Malestroit in January 1343; and, having displayed a flair for diplomacy, he was dispatched to Avignon in May as an envoy to defend Edward's claim to the throne of France before the pope. During the summer he served on a commercial embassy to Flanders and a mission to strengthen England's ties with Germany. He then returned to Scotland on an expedition for the relief of Lochmaben Castle, but the siege was raised before his arrival.<br>
<br>In April 1344 Stafford crossed to Gascony with a retinue of over 200 men, returning later in the year to spend some time on his estates and discharge various royal commissions in the west midlands. Even at home he engaged in feats of arms, participating in at least two major tournaments, one of which was held in November to mark the marriage of his elder son, Ralph, to Maud, the young daughter and coheir of his fellow commander, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12960/', "Henry of Grosmont, earl of Lancaster")</script>. He was, however, soon back on active service overseas. On 29 March 1345 he resigned as steward of the household, having already assumed office as seneschal of Gascony. He occupied this post for just over a year, although Edward wanted him to stay on.<br>
<br>In Gascony Stafford was one of Lancaster's marshals, between August and October leading the water-borne assault at the fall of Bergerac, commanding the garrison at Liborne, and heading a contingent at the relief of Auberoche. As captain of Aiguillon, he was besieged in the early summer of 1346 by the future King Jean of France at the head of a large army. He mounted a spirited defence, filling breaches in the fortifications with wine casks full of stones. He evidently escaped long before the siege was raised, on 20 August, as in July 1346 he crossed from England to Normandy with the royal army and helped to lead a successful raid on the port of Barfleur just after disembarkation. Together with his younger brother, Richard, who later became steward to the prince of Wales, he took part in the ensuing campaign and fought at the battle of Cr&eacute;cy on 26 August.<br>
<br>Although he was reappointed seneschal of Gascony in October 1346, Stafford soon joined Edward III, whose army was digging in outside Calais, ready for a protracted siege. In 1347 he crossed to England on &#145;secret matters touching the King&#146;  (<span class="italic">CClR, 1346&#150;1349</span>, 238), probably in connection with a great council held at Westminster to raise money for the war effort. He had returned to Edward's side by the spring. Stafford was one of the naval commanders who plundered a French supply fleet bringing food to Calais and captured many ships, his triumphs at sea being almost as numerous as those on land. As a royal marshal he received the keys of the town on its surrender in August 1347, and was rewarded with property there. He then took part in negotiations for a truce with France.<h2>
<a name="Therewardsofservice"></a>The rewards of service</h2>Stafford now basked in the favour of a grateful monarch. In November 1347 he and his wife were allowed to take possession of the estates of her late father without first paying homage to the king. Since he had recently inherited a third share of the lordship of Caus in Shropshire, worth about &pound;265 a year, Stafford suddenly found himself an extremely wealthy man, his coffers swollen even further with booty and ransoms from France. The death of his elder son at this time came as a bitter blow to his growing dynastic ambitions, for it deprived the family of a prospective title to half of one of the greatest inheritances in England.<br>
<br>Yet Stafford already enjoyed enormous prestige as a landowner, and wished to advertise his power. In February 1348 Edward III permitted him to crenellate his residences in Stafford and Madeley, Staffordshire. His forebears had hitherto been prevented by the crown from building a castle in Stafford, and he had anticipated this singular mark of confidence by entering a contract with a local mason a few weeks earlier. As one of the chief English commanders in France and a veteran of the Cr&eacute;cy campaign Stafford was, moreover, named among the twenty-six founder knights of the Order of the Garter, constituted by Edward III in April 1348 [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92770', "Founding knights of the Order of the Garter")</script>]. This was a close-knit group of men, notable for their military prowess and personal attachment to the king. Among them was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53085/', "Thomas Beauchamp, earl of Warwick (d. 1369)")</script>, whose daughter was betrothed to Stafford's surviving son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26206/', "Hugh Stafford")</script>, shortly afterwards.<h2>
<a name="Furthercampaigns"></a>Further campaigns</h2>Although Stafford was nearly fifty, with a life of hard campaigning behind him, retirement remained a distant prospect. Having received over &pound;570 in overseas expenses, he contracted in September 1348 to serve King Edward for life with a retinue of sixty men-at-arms in return for an annuity of &pound;600, secured on the customs of London and Boston. One month later he crossed to Calais with the king for further negotiations with the French; and, although the truce continued, he spent part of 1349 on active service in Gascony. As an experienced naval commander Stafford was called upon to defend English shipping against the predatory Castilian fleet, which was defeated on 29 August 1350 off the coast near Winchelsea. He ended the year in York, where he was sent to discuss peace with the Scots.<br>
<br>To mark the jubilee year of 1350&#150;51 and honour his leading captains, Edward III created a number of new peerage titles. Stafford was elevated to the rank of earl on 5 March 1351, with an annuity of 1000 marks, in lieu of estates to that value. Having replaced Lancaster (who then became a duke) as the king's lieutenant in Gascony, he indented in March 1352 to serve with 200 men, on the understanding that in March 1353 his personal retinue would be doubled at King Edward's charge and that further reinforcements would then be sent out to him. This proved a lucrative campaign, for he took several captives from the garrison at Agen, including the famous captain, Jean le Meingre, lord of Boucicault, for whom he was paid &pound;1000 at the exchequer. Even so, despite his reputation as a commander, Stafford was no match for the count of Armagnac, whose aggressive tactics forced the English to revise their strategy, and in 1355 led to the appointment of the prince of Wales as lieutenant to rally the English defence.<br>
<br>Stafford, meanwhile, offered armed protection nearer home, when, in the summer of 1353, the prince accompanied justices in eyre to his own notoriously unruly estates in Cheshire, and went in fear of an open insurrection. After a brief spell back in Gascony Stafford prepared to join an expedition in support of King Charles of Navarre (another claimant to the throne of France) which was mounted in 1354 by his old friend, the duke of Lancaster. When these plans were abandoned he took part in Edward III's new offensive in northern France in the autumn of 1355, and then commanded a contingent in the royal army that shortly afterwards invaded Scotland.<h2>
<a name="Decliningyearsdeathandlegacies"></a>Declining years, death, and legacies</h2>Stafford was clearly a man of remarkable strength and physical bravery. In 1359, when he was again in France with the king, his headquarters near the Somme were attacked by a contingent of Frenchmen. Although by medieval standards he was now well advanced in years, the earl is said to have killed one assailant, disabled another, and captured their commander. The campaign ended in talks at Br&eacute;tigny in May 1360, which were attended by Stafford as one of the English envoys, and led to the ratification of a formal peace treaty at Calais in October. Even then his days as a soldier were not over: in the following year he travelled to Ireland with the chief governor, the king's younger son, Lionel of Antwerp, earl of Ulster, in order to attempt the restoration of English lordship.<br>
<br>Stafford already had personal connections with Ireland, for in 1350 he had married his daughter Beatrice to Maurice fitz Maurice Fitzgerald, second earl of Desmond, leasing the young couple his lordship of Kilkenny by way of a settlement. On Desmond's death without children, in June 1358, Edward III granted Stafford custody of all the comital estates not already held as dower by the widowed Beatrice. But he occupied them for only a year, until the next heir took possession. Beatrice had by then become the wife of Thomas, Lord Ros of Helmsley, one of her father's fellow captains in France. Stafford had four daughters in all. Of these, Joan's first husband was John, third Baron Charlton of Powys, after whose death she married Gilbert, third Lord Talbot; while Elizabeth was the second wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65270/', "Reynold Cobham, second Baron Cobham (1348&#150;1403)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52781/', "Cobham family")</script>].<br>
<br>Although the chronicler Jean Froissart reports that Stafford visited France again in 1369 (the year in which his former comrade-in-arms, the earl of Warwick, named him as an executor), the earl may already have been too frail to travel far. Years in the field had taken their toll, and by his death, on 31 August 1372, his once powerful frame was wretchedly emaciated and bowed down with age. He died at Tonbridge Castle, Kent, and was buried in the church of the nearby Augustinian priory, next to his second wife and her parents. He had, however, proved generous to Stone Priory, Staffordshire, the burial place of his own ancestors and centre of the cult of St Wulfhad, of which he was a devotee. A man of more than strictly conventional piety, about 1344 he founded a house of Augustinian friars at Stafford, where prayers were to be said for his first wife and her relatives, and for the king. Shortly before his death the earl also endowed a perpetual chantry at Cold Norton Priory, Oxfordshire, for the salvation of his soul and that of Margaret Audley, whose great wealth had made possible such largess. His younger son, Hugh, succeeded him.<h2>
<a name="Thefortunesofayoungerbrother"></a>The fortunes of a younger brother</h2>Earl Ralph's younger brother, <a name="cosubject_26212"></a><span class="headword">Richard Stafford</span>, Lord Stafford of Clifton  (<em>c.</em>1305&#150;1380), was a distinguished figure in his own right, achieving fame as a <span class="occ">soldier, diplomat, and administrator</span>. His early career was spent, like that of his brother, in the retinue of Ralph, Lord Basset. Both Staffords were pardoned a sentence of outlawry in 1326, because Basset needed them in his retinue at Dover. This, the first of many brushes with authority, arose from the Staffords' entrenched opposition to Edward II. Sir Richard later became involved in a series of brutal feuds among the local gentry and members of his own prolific family, in which political partisanship served to exacerbate disputes over property and patronage. He was imprisoned in 1334 as an accessory to murder, but Lord Basset again came to the rescue by recruiting him for service on the Scottish border. Back in England by 1336 he was then a party to his brother's abduction of Margaret Audley, the last known occasion on which he openly defied the law.<br>
<br>Sir Richard's influence in Staffordshire derived not only from family connections, but also reflected his increasingly powerful position as a landowner. Clearly a man who brooked no opposition, he was able to secure from his mother part of the inheritance of his younger half-brother, who abandoned as futile attempts to recover his ancestral manor of Pipe after a protracted battle in the courts. His first marriage, in 1337, to Isabel, a granddaughter of Sir William Camville of Clifton Camville and (on the paternal side) of Sir Richard Vernon of Haddon, Derbyshire, also brought him property, even though her brother, William, possessed a superior title. Clifton became Sir Richard's seat, and henceforward he deployed his energies more constructively as a justice of the peace and royal commissioner in the west midlands. But the attractions of local government began to pale when the prospect of military activity came into view. Stafford's first diplomatic mission took place in 1337, when he served as a royal envoy to the counts of Hainault and Gueldres, and to the emperor, Ludwig of Bavaria, in an attempt to isolate the French. He campaigned with Edward III in France in 1339, and almost certainly used his voice as a shire knight in the parliament of 1341 to defend the king's choice of ministers (including his own brother) and their management of the war effort. After a brief period of service against the Scots Stafford returned to France in 1345, where he played a notable part in engagements at Bergerac, Liborne, Auberoche, and La R&eacute;ole. In 1346 he fought in the vanguard at the battle of Cr&eacute;cy, being perhaps for the first time associated with the young Prince Edward, with whom he was to forge a long and profitable relationship.<h2>
<a name="ServantoftheprinceofWales"></a>Servant of the prince of Wales</h2>On returning to England, in or before February 1347, Stafford was made steward and surveyor of all Edward's English and Welsh estates, at an annual fee of &pound;66 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. He also became a leading member of the prince's council, a justice of his courts in Cheshire, and keeper of his lordships of Cheylesmore and Coventry. For the next eight years he remained one of his senior retainers, constantly preoccupied with a wide range of business, including the recruitment of soldiers for service abroad. There were also opportunities to consolidate his own authority. During the late 1350s he took a second wife, Maud (<i>c</i>.1330&#150;1400), the daughter of his kinsman, Sir John Stafford of Bramshall, Staffordshire. Maud possessed a title to part of the manor of Pipe, which Sir Richard promptly claimed. Such was his authority that, while an assize concerning the property was being held at Stafford, in 1359, no less a figure than the sheriff appeared in court wearing Sir Richard's livery.<br>
<br>Stafford returned to France in 1355 as a knight bachelor in Prince Edward's service. They were bound for Gascony, which Stafford knew well after campaigning there with the earl of Derby in the 1350s. He was promoted to the rank of knight-banneret at Bassoues, and took part in the prince's celebrated march across country from Bordeaux to Narbonne. He returned home to raise reinforcements, but subsequently distinguished himself at the battle of Poitiers in 1356. He was later rewarded by the prince with a gift of &pound;333 for his part in the engagement, as well (in 1358) as a pension of &pound;133 a year for life. Having served with the royal army during the months leading up to the treaty of Br&eacute;tigny in May 1359, he was then chosen with his brother to negotiate the terms of peace. In July 1361 he was back in the field as seneschal of Gascony, an appointment intended to support the prince during his term as governor of Aquitaine. He was joined there by his illegitimate son Nicholas, and by his eldest legitimate son and namesake, with whom he has often been confused. The latter accompanied him on an embassy to the papal court at Avignon, in 1366, and married the only daughter and heir of Sir John Blount. The younger Richard Stafford's death without heirs, soon after Stafford (designated &#145;the father&#146;) was first summoned to parliament as a baron in 1370, ended any prospect that the title would become hereditary.<h2>
<a name="Peerofparliament"></a>Peer of parliament</h2>Elevation to the ranks of the parliamentary baronage was an appropriate reward for one who had served the crown so loyally. It was because of his close relationship with Prince Edward and his own impressive war record that Stafford was nominated by the Commons in the Good Parliament of 1376 as one of the twelve lords with whom they wished to confer on matters of state. This was an attempt to place curbs on the unpopular and corrupt court party, with which the prince (then terminally sick) was believed to have little sympathy. But Stafford proved a disappointment. He served as an elected member of the royal council (along with his nephew, Hugh, earl of Stafford) for less than the prearranged year, after apparently losing the support of the Commons because of doubts about his commitment to reform. He was also growing old, and must have been well over seventy by the time of his death on 13 August 1380. His estates in Gloucestershire, Staffordshire, Shropshire, Northamptonshire, Derbyshire, and Leicestershire (some of which had been settled upon him by Lord Basset in the 1340s) descended to the elder of his two surviving legitimate sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26201/', "Edmund Stafford")</script>, the future bishop of Exeter and chancellor of England. He also left a second legitimate son, Thomas, and two daughters, who were successively betrothed to Sir Thomas Ardern of Elford in Staffordshire.<br>
