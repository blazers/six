<span class="headword">Vane <span class="st"> [Fane]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>b. </em>1599/1600), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and Roman Catholic convert</span>, was born in Kent, matriculated from Jesus College, Oxford, on 26 April 1616 aged sixteen, and transferred in 1618 to Christ's College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1620 and MA in 1623. He was ordained deacon and priest at Peterborough in April 1621 and was appointed chaplain-extraordinary to Charles I and rector of the rich west Kent living of Crayford, possibly by means of family patronage, in 1626. Edward Hasted, in his history of Kent, omits him from his list of rectors of Crayford, perhaps influenced by the rector's subsequent abandonment of the Church of England, leaving a gap from the year of Vane's appointment to the point at which his successor was eventually appointed, in 1648.<br>
<br>It seems likely that at least as early as the 1630s Vane was exhibiting Arminian sacramental preferences which presaged his conversion to Catholicism and which seem to have divided his parish: in July 1633 the last significant step taken by the archbishop of Canterbury, George Abbot, was in the form of an arbitration to impose on Crayford church a distinctly high-church manner of reverently receiving &#145;the body and blood of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ&#146;  (<span class="italic">VCH Kent</span>, 2.91). The rector took his Cambridge DD in 1640 but was soon to leave the Church of England and, becoming a Catholic, gave up his benefice and, apparently with his wife, travelled to France and Italy. He was awarded a medical degree in a continental university and changed his career to the practice of medicine.<br>
<br>Educated in theology to an advanced degree Vane also took up authorship on behalf of the Catholic faith. His <span class="italic">A Lost Sheep Returned Home</span>, published in Paris in 1643, around the time of his departure for the continent, was dedicated to Charles I's Catholic queen, Henrietta Maria, and explained the motives for his change of faith. It drew a defence of the historical authenticity of the Church of England from the historian Edward Chisenhall and went through five editions between 1643 and 1666. His historical work, <span class="italic">An Answer to a Libell</span> (Paris, 1646), was a defence of the Catholic Church's Fourth Lateran Council, which in 1215 established the doctrine of transubstantiation in the Eucharist. Dedicated to Sir Kenelm Digby, it had earlier been issued attached to Miles Pinckney's <span class="italic">Occasional Discourses</span> (1646). A third book, <span class="italic">Wisdom and innocence, or, Prudence and simplicity in the examples of the shepherd and the dove, propounded by Our Lord</span>, was published in 1652 with a dedication to the earl of Westmorland.<br>
<br>Vane was a remarkable but shadowy character, difficult to trace. He may or may not have been the Thomas Fane who died in Kent in 1692 at the age of ninety.<br>
