<span class="headword">Dickinson,  Henry Douglas</span>  (1899&#150;1969), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born at 31 Parma Crescent, Battersea, London, on 25 March 1899, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32816/', "Henry Winram Dickinson (1870&#150;1952)")</script>, historian of engineering and technology, who was at that time assistant keeper at the Department of Science and Art, South Kensington, and his wife, Edith Emerson (<i>d</i>. 1937). From King's College School, Wimbledon, he went to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he took the part two tripos in economics (1921) and history (1922). In 1924, after two years' research at the London School of Economics, he was appointed to an assistant lectureship in economics at Leeds University. On 27 March 1925 he married Sylvia Sworn (1899/1900&#150;1965), a medical student, the daughter of Henry George Sworn, a doctor of medicine; they had two daughters.<br>
<br>Dickinson taught economics and economic history at Leeds until 1947. He was an enthusiastic teacher for the Workers' Educational Association, and the book for which he was best known, <span class="italic">The Economics of Socialism</span> (1939), was based on his extension lectures to a WEA class in north Yorkshire. As an intellectual of the left he argued, in the 1930s, that rational socialism could be implemented using actual market mechanisms. He and his writings were well known to other left-wing intellectuals, including G. D. H. Cole, Hugh Dalton, Evan Durbin, and Harold Laski. He played an important part in the discussions of &#145;market socialism&#146; that arose from Ludwig von Mises's view that rational allocation under socialism was impossible; socialist planners could not, von Mises had argued, make the huge number of ever-changing computations required to calculate prices scientifically. In two key articles, &#145;The economic basis of socialism&#146; (<span class="italic">Political Quarterly</span>, 1, 1930) and &#145;Price formation in a socialist community&#146; (<span class="italic">Economic Journal</span>, 43, 1933), Dickinson asserted, paradoxically, that planners would not need to make such calculations since socialism could best be effected via the market mechanism itself. &#145;The beautiful systems of economic equilibrium described by B&ouml;hm-Bawerk, Wieser, Marshall and Cassel are not descriptions of society as it is but prophetic visions of a socialist economy of the future&#146;  (<span class="italic">Economic Journal</span>, 1933, 247). It was not necessary for the planner to compute prices; this could be left to the market once the distribution of income had been settled. Most importantly for Dickinson, in this system consumers and workers would retain their freedom of choice. But would not market wage and interest rates reintroduce capitalist inequalities? To minimize inequality essential services would be provided free under a system of progressive taxation.<br>
<br>It can now be seen that Dickinson had prepared his ground well in his book <span class="italic">Institutional Revenue</span> (1932), which had been developed while he was researching at the London School of Economics under Cannan. That book, whose preface acknowledged help from Dalton and Dobb, showed how a theory of surplus value could be restated in modern marginalist terms. Dickinson had also argued that, since incomes under capitalism were largely a matter of capturing &#145;rents&#146;, the distribution of income was an institutional matter, that is, factor prices played a less decisive role in resource allocation than had been thought. Dickinson had thereby tried to block an obvious line of attack on his version of market socialism.<br>
<br>In 1947 Dickinson was appointed senior lecturer in economics at the University of Bristol, where he was promoted to professor in 1951, holding the chair until his retirement in 1964. His article in the <span class="italic">Review of Economic Studies</span> (22, 1954&#150;5), &#145;A note on economic dynamics&#146;, pioneered the constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function and anticipated some of the neo-classical growth results of Robert Solow and Trevor Swan. The elasticity of substitution measures the degree to which capital is substituted for labour as the real wage rises relative to the price of capital. The assumption of a constant elasticity simplified complex technical problems in growth theory while avoiding over-simplification, and is still widely used. Dickinson also worked out at the time, but never published, &#145;a simple way of fitting the [CES] equation &hellip; statistically, to the time series, by using evidence on factor shares&#146;  (Whitaker, 166&#150;7). In this paper he accepted that technical progress was a more powerful tool than redistribution for raising living standards: &#145;Technical progress is a necessary condition for a permanent and continuous increase in real wages. Even if we assume that the State has an unlimited power to redistribute real income, we cannot escape the conclusions reached here&#146;  (ibid., 179).<br>
<br>Dick, as Dickinson was almost universally known, was an impressively versatile economist, being an accomplished theorist and historian of economic ideas as well as an expert numismatist. His colleagues regarded this unworldly, eccentric figure with great affection. He died at Southmead Hospital, Bristol, on 11 July 1969 and was cremated at Canford crematorium, Bristol.<br>
