<span class="headword">William the Englishman</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1179&#150;1185), <span class="occ">master mason</span>, is known only from references to his appointment as master mason in the treatise <span class="italic">De combustione</span> by Gervase of Canterbury. In this unique eyewitness account of the rebuilding of a major medieval church, Gervase details the process of reconstruction of the east end of Canterbury Cathedral following the disastrous fire of 1174. He recounts how masons were summoned from France and England to advise the bereaved community, and how from among these the monks chose a certain <a name="cosubject_52809"></a><span class="headword">William de Sens</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1175&#150;1179)<span class="occ"></span>&#151;a native, perhaps not coincidentally, of a city with strong associations with the recently martyred Thomas Becket. Gervase describes William as &#145;a man active and ready, and as a workman skilful both in wood and stone&#146; and states that he was retained &#145;on account of his lively genius and good reputation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Gervase of Canterbury</span>, 1.6). In the autumn of 1178, however, William de Sens was seriously injured in a fall from the scaffolding. At first he directed the work from his bed giving charge &#145;to a certain ingenious and industrious monk, who was the overseer of the masons&#146;&#151;&#145;much envy and malice&#146; was caused by this appointment, according to Gervase  (<span class="italic">Works of Gervase of Canterbury</span>, 1.20).<br>
<br>However, in the following year the Frenchman despaired of recovery and returned to France, to be succeeded by another architect, &#145;William by name, English by nation, small in body, but in workmanship of many kinds acute and honest&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Gervase of Canterbury</span>, 1.21). William the Englishman's toponym was thus acquired to differentiate him from William de Sens and the fact that he did not succeed the latter directly suggests strongly that he had not worked previously at Canterbury under the French architect. Nothing is known of William's life before his appointment at Canterbury in 1179, nor after the completion of the building campaign in 1185. Attempts to identify him with other Williams with the same toponym who appear in documents of the period, such as William the Englishman who was the carpenter in the king's service in 1214, or William the Englishman who left 40<i>s</i>. to Canterbury Cathedral priory in the same year, are speculative and provide no secure basis for his subsequent career. Nor have any other buildings been convincingly attributed to him on stylistic grounds, following his work at Canterbury.<br>
<br>There is no reason to doubt Gervase's account in respect of the allocation of the parts of the church constructed by each of the two Williams. This firmly establishes the responsibility of William de Sens for the monks' choir and the presbytery, and of William the Englishman for the Trinity Chapel and corona. There is, however, continuing controversy over their respective contributions to the design of the building. According to one view, William the Englishman is seen as having sole responsibility for the design and the exceptional splendour of the Trinity Chapel, and he, therefore, should be credited with the principal stylistic innovations in this seminal building. It is argued that his work in the Trinity Chapel indicates familiarity with the latest developments in north-eastern France, the area in which both architects had worked, or even trained, and from where both architects brought sculptors and glaziers. The degree of accomplishment in the handling of the emerging Gothic style is seen in the open, skeletal structure of the outer walls; in the paired, classically proportioned, columns of the main arcade; in the treatment of the middle storey of the elevation as if it were a triforium passage, rather than openings into the dark roof space above the aisles as in the choir and presbytery; and in the use, albeit tentative, of flying buttresses, which are among the earliest securely datable examples. It is claimed that all these show William the Englishman's work to be more French than that of his predecessor. The unusual horseshoe plan provided a conveniently spacious ambulatory for pilgrims to circulate around the shrine of Thomas Becket; and the raising of the level of the floor of the Trinity Chapel allowed the shrine to be visible over the high altar, thereby forming a spectacular climax to the cathedral: a focus which was greatly enhanced by the lavish use of Purbeck marble, even for the arcade piers and the paving slabs on the floor.<br>
<br>Against that interpretation, however, strong arguments have been put forward more recently that most of the architectural features in the part constructed by William the Englishman have their origins in the choir and presbytery built by William de Sens, and that the layout of the Trinity Chapel, at least, must have been designed by the Frenchman before his fall. The horseshoe form of the Trinity Chapel seems to be based on a nine-sided polygon&#151;the same geometrical configuration as the apse of Sens Cathedral&#151;and some of the crucial changes of intention concerning the projected form for the rebuilding of the old Trinity Chapel, as revealed by the archaeological evidence, can be shown to belong to the time of William de Sens. Moreover, the decision to raise the floor of the Trinity Chapel had such important implications for the prominence to be given to the shrine of the newly canonized Thomas Becket, that it could only have been made by the clergy, and is very unlikely to have been made by either architect. William the Englishman may thus have done little more than update some of the details in the execution of the existing designs of his predecessor.<br>
