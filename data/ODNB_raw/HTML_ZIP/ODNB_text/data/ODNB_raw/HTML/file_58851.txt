<span class="headword">Shaw,  Martin Edward Fallas</span>  (1875&#150;1958), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 9 March 1875 at 3 High Street, Kennington, London, the eldest of the nine children of James Shaw (1842&#150;1907), church organist, and his wife, Charlotte Elizabeth James, who had trained as a pianist. A startling birthmark on the left of his face did not make him shy. Brought up in Belsize Park, where he attended a local private school, Martin became organist at Emmanuel Church, Hampstead, in 1895 and entered the Royal College of Music. He liked his tutor, C. V. Stanford, but lacked application and dropped out after two years.<br>
<br>Shaw made friends with the theatre reformer Edward Gordon Craig in 1897. Together they mounted an innovative production of <span class="italic">Dido and Aeneas</span> for the Purcell Operatic Society in 1900, yet the professional theatre was slow to engage them. Writing incidental music for occasional plays generated very little income for Shaw, who lost his church job in 1903. Though gruff with strangers, he was exuberant among fellow bohemians in Chelsea, where he sported a sombrero, sandals, and cloak. Ralph Vaughan Williams gave him casual work researching old tunes for the <span class="italic">English Hymnal</span> (1906). Then he conducted for Isadora Duncan, the American dance pioneer (and lover of Craig), on two European tours.<br>
<br>In 1908 Shaw took to the organ loft of St Mary the Virgin, Primrose Hill. Plainsong and chanting suited Percy Dearmer, the unconventional high-church vicar there, who decried sentimental nineteenth-century music. Shaw agreed, sometimes likening the popular hymns of Sir John Stainer, Joseph Barnby, and J. B. Dykes to overripe bananas. The two men sought to revive the purity of earlier sacred song, compiling <span class="italic">The English Carol Book</span> in 1913; in the same year Shaw co-founded the Summer School of Church Music. He also collaborated with Mabel Dearmer on musical plays for children, including <span class="italic">Brer Rabbit</span>.<br>
<br>Shaw joined the army in 1914 but was soon discharged owing to bouts of near blindness indirectly caused by diabetes. Fervently patriotic, he campaigned against performances of German music and secured his commercial breakthrough with <span class="italic">Six Songs of War</span> (1914). His marriage on 24 July 1916 further revitalized him. His wife, Joan Lindley Cobbold (<i>b</i>. 1890), was a music teacher from a Suffolk county family. He happily let her manage their lives and turn him into a countryman: a spare, clean-shaven figure in tweed suit and gaiters whose non-musical passions were woodcutting, riding, and farm work (an activity then still possible in Hampstead). Their three children, John, Diccon, and (Mary) Elizabeth, were born between 1917 and 1923.<br>
<br>Shaw emerged as an artistic crusader: England had to free herself from the musical despotism of Germany. German composers after Bach had taken the path that ended in hysterical emotionalism, and all Europe had followed in the nineteenth-century. But good English music could grow only from wholesome English roots: folk-song and the Elizabethan masters. Vaughan Williams and Holst led the way. Shaw aimed to take English &#145;national&#146; music to ordinary English people in theatres, schools, and churches, so that they could learn to prefer it. He started by launching the League of Arts in 1918 to provide music for victory celebrations.<br>
<br>Inspired by <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>, Shaw composed stage works in ballad opera style with lyrics by Clifford Bax. <span class="italic">Mr Pepys</span> ran for five weeks at the Royalty Theatre, Soho, in 1926. <span class="italic">The Thorn of Avalon</span> (1931) mixed Glastonbury legends with May day revels. His final offering, the wistful <span class="italic">Philomel</span>, flopped in 1932.<br>
<br>More rewarding was Shaw's career as a prolific arranger of choral music for schools. It helped that his brother Geoffrey Shaw (1879&#150;1943), himself a composer, worked for the Board of Education as an inspector of music classes. <span class="italic">The Motherland Song Book</span>, <span class="italic">Songs of Britain</span>, and <span class="italic">Girl Guide Hymns and Tunes</span> contained traditional airs such as &#145;A frog he would a-wooing go&#146; and &#145;My bonny cuckoo&#146;. If the settings sounded bland, it had to be conceded that Shaw was catering for amateurs. His artistry is clearer in recital ballads like &#145;Song of the Palanquin Bearers&#146;.<br>
<br>Shaw made his greatest impact on church music. From 1920 to 1924 he was organist at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, and he directed the music for Maude Royden's fellowship services until 1936. Two classic publications disseminated his repertory. <span class="italic">Songs of Praise</span> (1925), edited by Shaw, Vaughan Williams, and Dearmer, replaced Victorian hymns with Tudor and folk-based ones. <span class="italic">The Oxford Book of Carols</span> (1928) consisted of the trio's choice of traditional religious songs plus new carols by English composers.<br>
<br>With missionary zeal Shaw toured the country, explaining the superiority of <span class="italic">Songs of Praise</span> to <span class="italic">Hymns Ancient and Modern</span>. He also composed a stream of anthems and services. Whereas the Victorians favoured triple time and lush chromatic harmonies, Shaw employed quadruple time or irregular groupings and stark quasi-modal harmonies. His works were easy enough for average congregations to sing yet &#145;progressive&#146; enough to satisfy the fastidious. The growth of Anglo-Catholicism increased demand for liturgical music, and his <span class="italic">Anglican Folk Mass</span> (1918) spread far and wide.<br>
<br>The archbishop of Canterbury awarded Shaw (and his brother) the Lambeth doctorate of music in 1932. The diocese of Chelmsford employed him as its director of music from 1935 to 1944. A pillar of the church music establishment, he remained too dogmatic about &#145;Englishness&#146; to get on well with his counterparts Walford Davies and Sydney Nicholson. To &#145;cultured&#146; Anglicans between the wars, he was a saviour of hymnody and arbiter of taste.<br>
<br>Shaw's activities grew more localized after he left London for Essex in 1936. Half a dozen new choral pieces still appeared each year, notably <span class="italic">The Redeemer</span> (1944) and <span class="italic">God's Grandeur</span> (1948). He retired to Suffolk in 1946, became an OBE in 1955, and was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Music shortly before he died at his home, Long Island House, Southwold, on 24 October 1958. After cremation his ashes were interred at Southwold. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>By the end of the twentieth century, the music of Martin Shaw was not much prized. His foes in the cosmopolitan camp had always disparaged it, while even enthusiasts for &#145;English pastoralism&#146; tended to assume that anything Shaw did, Vaughan Williams could have done better. They preferred to honour him for making the church a haven for other composers of broadly the same school until the 1970s. Certain parishes continued to sing his services, and many more the hymn tunes &#145;Little Cornard&#146; and &#145;Marching&#146;. His secular solo songs&#151;the least didactic of his works&#151;retained most critical esteem.<br>
