<span class="headword">Spencer,  John Charles</span>, Viscount Althorp and third Earl Spencer  (1782&#150;1845), <span class="occ">politician, agriculturist, and sportsman</span>, was born on 30 May 1782 at Spencer House, St James's Place, London, the eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26125/', "George John Spencer, second Earl Spencer (1758&#150;1834)")</script>, and Lavinia Bingham, daughter of the first earl of Lucan.

<a name="Abrutalupbringing"></a>A brutal upbringing</h2>Spurred to excel by their formidable but controlling mother the Spencer siblings sought to escape her repressive regime quickly. Robert and Frederick fled to sea. Althorp, as he was known, was sent away to school at eight, but not before experiencing a kind of Gothic childhood which included drunken servants, extended periods of parental desertion, and ferocious verbal abuse. Lord Spencer, though an affectionate father, did nothing to protect his son from the singularly unmaternal brutality of his wife. Althorp was permanently maimed: a profound sense of personal inadequacy undermined an otherwise physically robust and intellectually gifted personality. He did not marry until the age of thirty-four, and he did not begin to unleash his exceptional powers as a politician until he was nearly fifty.<br>
<br>Althorp's years at Harrow School (1790&#150;98) offered him some respite from the terrors of home, but were otherwise undistinguished. His contemporaries there included the future prime ministers Goderich, Peel, Aberdeen, and Palmerston. He was close to his cousin, Viscount Duncannon, a friend and political ally in adulthood. Lord Spencer became dissatisfied with the school's instruction and withdrew Althorp for two years of private tutoring to prepare him for Cambridge.<br>
<br>Althorp spent several years at Trinity College, Cambridge, under the supervision of Joseph Allen, later bishop of Ely. The torpid intellectual atmosphere of the university left little mark on the young nobleman. His encounter with Allen was of the first importance. The don was sensitive to the fragile nature of Althorp's emotional development. He could do nothing about Althorp's rejection of his mother's cosmopolitan values, but Allen's influence prevented a retreat into country bumpkinism. He succeeded in nurturing Althorp's intellectual curiosity and deepening religious faith, tempering both with a gentle worldliness.<br>
<br>The peace of Amiens in 1802 allowed Lord Spencer to send his son on a grand tour. The journey became a parody of traditional practice. Althorp hurried from one Italian city to another searching for a bolt-hole to England. But the shock of encountering raw despotism on its home ground was vital to the gestation of his political ideology. &#145;They have no more idea of a limited monarchy on the Continent&#146;, he told his father, &#145;than a horse has of the Scriptures&#146;  (Wasson, 14).<br>
<br>This fillip to his whiggism helped Althorp emerge from a Pittite chrysalis. Lord Spencer had deserted Fox in 1794 in reaction to the excesses of the French Revolution and only gradually returned to his native party. Althorp had no clear political beliefs until his tour sparked a revulsion towards conservative ideology. However, his entry into parliament for the pocket borough of Okehampton in April 1804 did not presage a dynamic Commons career. Most of Althorp's life for the next fourteen years was devoted to hunting and shooting. By this means he sought to escape his mother and adult responsibility, and to everyone's surprise he found a wife and the will to lead.<h2>
<a name="Foxhuntingandmarriage"></a>Fox-hunting and marriage</h2>After a few years of preparation Althorp ascended to the mastership of the Pytchley hunt, already something of a national institution. He took office because of his rank. He achieved fame by intelligent, courageous, and innovative leadership. Through unremitting and arduous effort he built the organization into the premier hunt in England just at the moment when the political and social &eacute;lite were embracing fox-hunting as a core element of English culture. For ten years Althorp provided superb sport not only to local yeomen and gentry, but also to a membership that increasingly encompassed a significant portion of the high aristocracy. Senior statesmen obeyed the commands of this ungainly youth. Nearly a century later an authority judged that although twenty masters had reigned since &#145;not one more completely realized the idea of what a master of hounds should be&#146;  (H. O. Nethercote, <span class="italic">The Pytchley Hunt: Past and Present</span>, 1888, 40). He brought the Pytchley, another sporting writer declared, to &#145;the zenith of its glory&#146;  (H. H. Dixon, <span class="italic">Silk and Scarlet</span>, 1895, 73&#150;4). The mastership gave Althorp confidence and experience that neither his nominal service as junior lord of the Treasury in the &#145;ministry of all the talents&#146; (1806&#150;7) nor his aimless years in the political wilderness of opposition could confer.<br>
<br>Lord Spencer obliged Althorp to stand as Pitt's successor for the parliamentary seat of Cambridge University in 1806. This absurd project ended in defeat. The Spencers met with more appropriate success later in the year by gaining one of the Northamptonshire seats, where Althorp Park and the Pytchley were located. The brief but vigorous election campaign antagonized many tory squires, but strong support from the whig grandees and potent nonconformist plumpers left Althorp secure until the famous battle of 1831 in the midst of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> crisis, which became the last great electoral contest of the <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i>. He held a county seat (southern division after 1832) until his elevation to the Lords in 1834.<br>
<br>Althorp's maiden speech came in 1809 during a debate over the extent to which the duke of York's mistress influenced military appointments made by the prince in his capacity as commander-in-chief of the army. The &#145;York affair&#146; was decisive in binding Althorp to a group of young whig magnates (including lords Milton, Folkestone, Tavistock, Ebrington, Duncannon, and Lyttelton) increasingly attached to the radical &#145;Mountain&#146;, whom the conservative Grenvillites called &#145;enrag&eacute;s&#146;. The failure of the senior whigs, notably lords Grey and Grenville, to condemn royal malfeasance and, perhaps even more importantly, immorality, radicalized Althorp's political thought. He broke decisively with the established leadership and isolated himself under the tutelage of the radical Samuel Whitbread to the consternation and incomprehension of the older generation.<br>
<br>In 1814 Althorp fell passionately in love with Esther Acklom, a plump and unsophisticated heiress, daughter of a minor country gentleman, Richard Acklom of Wiseton Hall, Nottinghamshire, and his wife, Elizabeth; he married her on 13 April that year. She returned unstinting devotion. Her death at the age of twenty-nine, after giving birth to a stillborn child in June 1818 was a catastrophe Althorp almost did not survive. His devout religious faith wavered. Possibly suicidal, he withdrew into a period of black depression and social isolation. He wore mourning clothes for the rest of his life. As a penance he gave up fox-hunting, by which means he fashioned a psychological hair shirt producing potent and prolonged misery. He found the sound of a hunting horn almost unbearable even in old age.<br>
<br>Althorp reconciled himself to Esther's death through a belief in their eventual reunion in heaven, which he could earn only by personal atonement. &#145;I have abstracted myself from all worldly considerations perhaps more than you will think right&#146;, he confessed to Lord Milton, &#145;but my prospects are so completely annihilated in this world that I only wish to make use of it as a stepping stone to the next&#146;  (Wasson, 98). His passion for service became the controlling force of his life. Coupled with his courage and skill as a leader, it overcame his diffidence and stimulated his submerged ambition. This explains the paradox of his bumbling, unprepossessing demeanour and his steely drive to excel.<h2>
<a name="Agricultureandeducation"></a>Agriculture and education</h2>Oxen replaced foxes as Althorp's chief objects of pursuit in 1818. Agriculture allowed him to devote his wealth and energy to public service and to enjoy animals. By shrewd purchase and careful breeding he quickly built up one of the most important herds of cattle in Britain. He assisted the development of a lighter boned, quicker fattening strain, which launched shorthorns on the road to bovine supremacy in Britain and America. His skill as a breeder was honed with canines, and bloodlines from both his foxhounds and cattle were still being sought a century after his death. Much of his energy, however, was devoted to promoting research and the dissemination of applied science to farming. He founded his first agricultural association the year after Esther's death. In 1825 he took over the moribund Smithfield Club and transformed it into a national association for animal breeders. By the 1840s its shows were attracting 60,000 visitors a year. He became the founder or president of several county societies and spoke regularly at agricultural meetings throughout the country. In 1838 he chaired the organizational meeting and became the first president of the Royal Agricultural Society, and with his close friend, the duke of Richmond, managed its affairs for most of the next decade. He helped to found and edit the society's journal, planned the giant annual shows, established the library, and authored five articles on breeding and feeding. An indication of his stature in the agricultural world came with the request of Thomas Coke of Holkham that he supervise the great Norfolk estate during the minority of the second earl of Leicester.<br>
<br>Althorp's philanthropic activities in other realms were equally vigorous though less well known. He attended the preliminary discussions in 1825 to establish London University and later took an active part in the meetings of its council. The next year he participated in the foundation of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. Coupled with the mechanics' institutes, the society was strongly Benthamite in cast. It issued publications Althorp called &#145;works of great Utility&#146;, most notably the <span class="italic">Penny Magazine</span>, under the motto &#145;Knowledge is Power&#146;. For twenty years he edited publications, sought contributions, suggested series, and censored antisemitism, and in 1840 became managing director. In that year he tried unsuccessfully to replicate his achievement at Smithfield by restoring a declining institution to health, but he failed and it collapsed on his demise.<br>
<br>After Esther's death Althorp designed a programme for self-improvement the better to prepare himself for life after fox-hunting. He read theology and economic theory in alternate doses. Later he extended his investigations to new works on biology and geology and made himself an expert on current developments in these fields. His focus on God, science, and Mammon served as yet another reason for the Augustans of the whig leadership to find his interests suspicious. Althorp moved on from reading to meeting the classical economists. In 1823 he joined the Political Economy Club, presided over by Malthus, Ricardo, McCulloch, and the Mills, and participated in its debates.<br>
<br>Althorp's activities in agriculture and education also led to encounters and friendships with an extraordinary array of scientists, engineers, abolitionists, utilitarians, and radicals, with whom few aristocrats consorted. Leigh Hunt, Francis Place, Elizabeth Fry, Joseph Hume, Lyon Playfair, Josiah Parkes, I. K. Brunel, George Grote, Henry Warburton, Daniel O'Connell, Harriet Martineau, Nassau Senior, and both Macaulays numbered among his associates in various projects. They came to understand and trust him, perhaps alone among the great whigs of his day. He in turn honestly and openly listened and learned.<h2>
<a name="Oppositionyears18181830"></a>Opposition years, 1818&#150;1830</h2>Althorp devoted much of his political activity in the decade after Esther's death to legal and economic reform. He chaired a number of committees and succeeded in modestly emulating the work that Romilly, Huskisson, and Peel were also accomplishing. &#145;Committee is my forte&#146;, he once bragged, and his dazzling performance during the second readings of the <span class="roman">Great Reform Bill</span> confirmed this assessment. However, it was the harsh measures taken by Liverpool's administration to restrain dissent in the difficult years after Waterloo that made Althorp a politician. He believed the ministers were driving a wedge between the people and the ruling class that would provoke further unrest.<br>
<br>Althorp responded to the crisis in two ways. First, in the Commons he mounted a sustained and vociferous opposition to government measures of repression. Sometimes virtually alone&#151;for many whigs, even liberal ones, lacked his confidence in the ability of the aristocracy to ride out the storm unaided by suspension of habeas corpus and stronger laws against sedition&#151;Althorp fought the measures clause by clause trying to limit the application and duration of the legislation. Second, he took the extraordinary step of appearing alongside Burdett and Major Cartwright at an anti-government rally in Covent Garden in December 1819, standing under a banner proclaiming: &#145;Let us die like men and not be sold like slaves&#146;  (Wasson, 89). He spoke against withdrawing from parliament as a means of protest, but he also associated the grand whiggery directly with the radical movement against the six acts. He won respect, even from opponents, for consistency and courage. Walter Bagehot, who was not a sympathetic judge of Althorp's career, noted later that in these years he &#145;said things that the best of that majority [in favour of repression] understood in a rugged English way, which changed feelings, even if it did not alter votes&#146;. &#145;He was always there, always saying what was clear, strong, and manly&#146;  (N. St J. Staves, ed., <span class="italic">Bagehot's Historical Essays</span>, 1965, 159).<br>
<br>Sidmouth's suppression of dissent made Althorp a parliamentary reformer, as it did many of his closest associates. Unlike some colleagues, however, he did not abandon calls for electoral changes after the emergency was over. Among the great whigs only Russell and Althorp sustained this policy throughout the 1820s. The latter came to see a constitutional revolution as the means by which all his other goals could be achieved. For Althorp parliamentary reform became &#145;the great aim and object of his political life&#146;  (Le Marchant, 290). He also came to see that only a strong whig party could achieve office. This realization brought a gradual end to his isolation and the mentality of permanent opposition. Even though he still refused to countenance his own assumption of the leadership of the party in the Commons, a step which others increasingly pressed upon him, his conduct during the next decade, especially from 1827 onwards, led inevitably in that direction.<br>
<br>In part Althorp's elevation was due to the elimination of all other suitable candidates. Character flaws, ill health, and suicide removed Brougham, Tavistock, Lambton, Milton, Ponsonby, Tierney, Horner, Russell, Romilly, and Whitbread from contention. Althorp's refusal in 1827 to take office in the Canning administration, though initially seen as divisive, ultimately confirmed his claim to the leadership. It also led to his reconciliation with Lord Grey and to the disgrace of Lord Lansdowne, which unified the whig party, as much as its aristocratic nature allowed, and placed its leadership in the hands of the two strongest patrician reformers of their respective generations. This decisively shifted the centre of whiggery leftwards and forged a party capable of seizing power.<h2>
<a name="Office18301834"></a>Office, 1830&#150;1834</h2>On 3 March 1830 a meeting held in Althorp's rooms in the Albany formally proposed that he should lead the whig party in the Commons. George IV's death and the ensuing election, followed by Wellington's implacable declaration against reform, altered the political landscape. In November William IV summoned Lord Grey to form a government, which Grey could not promise to do until he had secured Althorp as leader of the House of Commons, chancellor of the exchequer, and chief lieutenant. Although in some respects a coalition ministry, on every important occasion Lord Grey's will was decisive during the next four years but only in close consultation and rarely in conflict with the man he called his &#145;right hand&#146;, Lord Althorp. Indeed, Grey tried on several occasions to make Althorp his co-leader through the eccentric device of appointing him first lord of the Treasury while the premier took the Foreign Office. Althorp consistently refused to accept this proposal. The older man groomed the younger one as his successor, not because he agreed with Althorp's radical views, but in the hope of holding a whig&#150;liberal&#150;radical coalition together in the aftermath of reform.<br>
<br>Althorp's power in the cabinet was demonstrated by his refusal to serve unless the reckless and undisciplined Henry Brougham was removed from the Commons, which was done. And, although both the king and Grey had the final say on what went into the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, it was Althorp's draft proposal which formed the basis for the legislation. He did not insist on triennial parliaments and universal suffrage, which he advocated but knew the Commons would never swallow, but in other respects the boldness of the plan, with its sweeping disfranchisement of smaller boroughs and uniform &pound;10 householder qualification, were for him a <i>sine qua non</i> and only reluctantly accepted by some members of the cabinet.<br>
<br>In early 1831 Althorp was well into middle age. A journalist described his expression as &#145;soft and stupid-like&#146;. He was stout, broad-whiskered, and round-faced. His farmer-like figure dressed in homely, black, rumpled clothes created an impression of placidity and pedestrian dullness. Creevey nicknamed him Clunch. His speaking style was awkward, full of hesitations, and oddly off-key. Moreover, his orations were sometimes bewildering. &#145;I forget my topics&#146;, he confessed  (Aspinall, 123). Yet it was this seeming ordinariness and lack of elegance which won the trust of the country gentlemen, and along with his mastership of the Pytchley convinced many of them that the whig government would not commit any irretrievable enormities.<br>
<br>There was nothing feigned about Althorp's unprepossessing manner. But many contemporaries and subsequent observers failed to look beyond the superficial appearance of squirearchical bonhomie. Althorp observed the world from the pinnacle of wealth and power and as the hereditary custodian of a potent ideology. His sense of personal unworthiness drove him to prodigies of exertion uncharacteristic of most grandees. His able mind gave him mastery in parliamentary debate. Peel understood this, noting: &#145;he never failed on every question to say a few words entirely to the point, and no argument open to reply escaped him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 86). His style of management was loose and unassertive, but this proved useful both in forcing the unreformed Commons to accept its own demise and in bringing as much unity as was likely to be achieved in the house after 1832. His mastery of the job won universal praise during the reform debates, when his knowledge, persuasive candour, and coolness in emergencies secured the passage of the bill virtually intact. Some kind of reform bill would have been passed whoever was in the lead. That a sweeping measure came through almost unscathed was Althorp's personal achievement. He earned the sobriquet &#145;Honest Jack&#146; because of his disarming truthfulness and the essential Englishness of his character.<br>
<br>Althorp carried into effect economic reforms to the extent that the whig legislative agenda and Lord Grey would allow. The latter was adamantly opposed to abolition of the corn laws, which meant that free-trade principles could only be introduced in moderate amounts. His first budget in 1831 was a disaster owing to constraints of time and Althorp's inexperience. Subsequent years saw more effective legislation that gradually reduced tariffs. His bills dealing with the East India Company and the Bank of England charter reflected <i>laissez faire</i> tempered by political realism. He was successful in slashing sinecures and streamlined the operation of the Treasury. In the 1840s Peel continued his work and complemented his achievements.<br>
<br>Under Althorp's leadership in 1833 the reformed House of Commons enacted abolition of slavery in the British empire. His factory reform, called <span class="roman">Althorp's Act</span>, was too limited for Lord Ashley's taste, but it included two crucial precedents that the chancellor of the exchequer insisted upon and defended vigorously: mandatory provisions for the education of children and the founding of a factory inspectorate. The latter opened the door for even more dramatic state intervention with the new poor law of 1834. Althorp worked with Senior and Chadwick to draft this legislation and carried it through the Commons. Workhouses came to be known as &#145;Althorp's bastilles&#146;. He was blamed for accepting the harsh principle of &#145;less eligibility&#146;. On the other hand, he blocked the doctrinaire Edwin Chadwick's appointment as a commissioner of the centralized London bureaucracy set up to manage the system. Althorp advocated an overhaul of the poor law based on Benthamite and classical economic principles, but he also insisted on a balance between efficiency and humanity. He kept Chadwick out of power in order to check dogmatic enforcement.<br>
<br>The reform ministry came unstuck over the issue of Ireland. In 1833 Althorp enthusiastically introduced legislation to reform the Church of Ireland, and won Daniel O'Connell's praise. He execrated &#145;ascendancy&#146; arrogance and English misrule, which he once called &#145;a disgrace to a civilized country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 81, 4 June 1845). Grey's insistence on strong coercive measures to accompany concessions led to internal convulsions from which the ministry did not recover. Stanley and other conservatives resigned, and Grey soon followed them. Althorp was obliged to resign after his father's death on 10 November 1834 translated him to the House of Lords. William IV used the excuse of Russell's inability to compensate for the loss of Althorp from the Commons as an excuse to exercise for the last time the royal prerogative of dismissing a ministry.<h2>
<a name="Retirement"></a>Retirement</h2>Spencer escaped the premiership after Grey's resignation in 1834 and Peel's failure to gain the confidence of the Commons in 1835 because of the king's repugnance and his own refusal to become the head of a radical&#150;liberal &#145;movement&#146; party organized by O'Connell, Hume, Warburton, and others. Though ambitious, he knew himself well enough to understand that he lacked the temperament and strategic vision to hold the first place. Many remained ardent for his leadership, but Spencer lay low in order to give no encouragement to his followers. He made &#145;rare appearances for serious purposes&#146;  (J. Morley, <span class="italic">The Life of William Ewart Gladstone</span>, 1903, 1.292) in the Lords, and a few times he organized a cabal of grandees to moderate Palmerston's aggressive foreign policy. His support for abolition of the corn laws sometimes made it awkward for him to speak before large assemblages of farmers.<br>
<br>Spencer devoted his retirement to agricultural propaganda, educational philanthropy, and salvaging the Spencer estate, which he was shaken to learn was half a million pounds in debt. Interest payments alone consumed three-quarters of his income. He lived frugally at his deceased wife's modest dwelling at Wiseton Hall, Nottinghamshire, shut up Althorp and Spencer houses, and sold off property not connected with the core of the estate. He sacrificed his comfort and dignity to ensure that his successors would enjoy splendour for at least another couple of centuries. The philistine of the grand tour preserved the glories of the Spencer collections, sacrificing the ease of his old age rather than sending Caxtons and Holbeins to the salerooms. Indeed, in later years Spencer carried on the family tradition of patronage. He sponsored a trip to Rome made by the sculptor William Butlin, funded the poet John Clare, and continued to make additions to his father's great library, which was made available to scholars.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1845 Spencer fell ill and died of kidney failure on 1 October at Wiseton. His body was taken by rail to Northamptonshire where he was interred among the glory of the Tudor and Jacobean Spencer tombs at Great Brington near Althorp Park. Queen Victoria noted: &#145;He will be a great loss, not only to his family, but to the country&#146;  (Wasson, 349) His friend Lord Fitzwilliam proposed a subscription for a public monument, but Frederick Spencer demurred at his older brother's instruction. &#145;On long consideration,&#146; the new earl told his correspondent, &#145;it was [Althorp's] opinion that for a public man the history of his country would be the best memorial of his character and acts&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>The Victorians grasped the importance of the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> they called &#145;great&#146;. Later whig historians continued to tout its importance but saw Durham, Brougham, Holland, or Russell as the progenitors of change. Then for a time the reformers' reputations were in eclipse as revisionists struggled to combine sociology with historical analysis. Lively debate continues to surround the origins and implications of parliamentary reform and the great wave of accompanying legislation of the early 1830s. Historians now better understand the complex mixture of Anglicanism, <i>laissez faire</i> economics, confident paternalism, incipient collectivism, radical utilitarianism, Irish nationalism, and developing party consciousness in the making of reform. The <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> itself has been successfully rehabilitated as the great political watershed of the first half of the nineteenth century. Among the whig magnates Althorp was the most committed and potent reformer. Bagehot and some later commentators portrayed Althorp as a simpleton or a blundering rustic. On the other hand, most of his contemporaries accorded him respect and affection. His unique mastery of the Commons was greatly admired by both Gladstone and Salisbury. He conveyed to the Victorians a notion of public virtue and moral government that melded whiggery and Liberalism. His life work laid the foundations of the Liberal Party and the modern state.<br>
