<span class="headword">Stewardson,  Thomas</span>  (1781&#150;1859), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born at Kendal, Westmorland, in August 1781, the son of John and Anne Stewardson of Kendal, who belonged to a Quaker family at Ullsmoor, near Shap in Westmorland. After a short apprenticeship with John Fothergill, a painter at Kendal, Stewardson studied there for some years under George Romney, and was one of his last pupils, along with Isaac Pocock and James Lonsdale. After this he went to London, and exhibited for the first time at the Royal Academy in 1803. He is also said to have received some instruction from John Opie. The list of Stewardson's exhibited works indicates that from his earliest days in London he was well employed. His paintings fall into three categories: portraits, exotic subjects such as <span class="italic">The Indian Serpent Charmer</span> (exh. RA, 1818), and fancy works, often featuring children, whose titles indicate the influence of the cult of sensibility. For instance, he exhibited a picture entitled <span class="italic">The Mother</span> (exh. RA, 1811) accompanied by a quotation from Tobias Smollett:<blockquote>
<div>The pious mother doom'd to death,<br>
</div>
<div>Forsaken wanders o'er the heath<br>
</div>
<div>Her wretched orphan cries for bread<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Portraits, however, predominated, one of the earliest being <span class="italic">Mrs Catherine Byron</span> (priv. coll.), mother of the poet George Gordon Byron, sixth Lord Byron. In his edition of Byron's letters and journals, R. E. Prothero noted that &#145;she exhausted the patience of Stewardson the artist, who in 1806, after forty sittings, painted her portrait, by her anxiety to have a particular turn in her elbow exhibited in the most pleasing light&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.2; portrait of Mrs Byron repro. facing p. 194).<br>
<br>In 1807 Stewardson exhibited at the Royal Academy portraits of Lord Sunderland and Lord Charles Spencer, indicating his rapid acceptance by aristocratic sitters. In the Royal Academy catalogue for 1811 he was described as &#145;Portrait Painter to HRH the Princess of Wales&#146;. Redgrave noted also that Stewardson &#145;painted George III and his Queen&#146;  (Redgrave, <span class="italic">Artists</span>, 413). His portrait of George Canning (1770&#150;1827) (exh. RA, 1813; formerly collection of George Drinkwater, Isle of Man) was engraved more often than any other portrait of that sitter. Many other portraits by Stewardson were also engraved. His portrait of the historian George Grote is in the National Portrait Gallery, London. Stewardson exhibited a total of eighty-three works at the Royal Academy between 1803 and 1825, with gaps in 1814, 1823, and 1824. This faltering in the early 1820s suggests that the illness which prevented him practising his art during the remaining decades of his life struck at about that time.<br>
<br>The influence on Stewardson's style of Romney and portraits by Sir Thomas Lawrence resulted in a blending in his work of neo-classical and Romantic styles. At Romney's studio sale Stewardson purchased the unfinished <span class="italic">Lady Hamilton as the Character of the Maid of Orleans</span>, which had been intended by Romney as a companion to his <span class="italic">Cassandra</span>. Stewardson is said to have been unmarried but Rogers lists a portrait by Opie of a Mrs Stewardson which had been in Stewardson's own collection  (Rogers, 165). He died at his lodgings at 69 Pall Mall on 28 August 1859 and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. Examples of Stewardson's work are in the collections of the National Trust, Tatton Park; the Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight, Cheshire; and the Abbot Hall Art Gallery, Cumbria.<br>
