<span class="headword">Ingold, Sir  Christopher Kelk</span>  (1893&#150;1970), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 28 October 1893 at 142 Windsor Road, Forest Gate, Essex, the first of the two children of William Kelk Ingold (1861&#150;1898), commercial traveller, and his wife, Harriet Walker (1865&#150;1943), daughter of Christopher Newcomb and his wife, Emma. Ingold's father suffered from tuberculosis, and although the family moved to the Isle of Wight he died in Shanklin in 1898. Despite her husband's death, Ingold's mother chose to remain on the Isle of Wight to ensure that her two young children were raised in a healthy, outdoor environment. Thus, from an early age, Ingold developed a love of birdwatching that continued throughout his life.<h2>
<a name="Education"></a>Education</h2>In 1905 Ingold entered Sandown county secondary school as a scholarship-supported day pupil, where he benefited from a group of young, gifted, and dedicated teachers, and learned not only science, but music and sports as well. He particularly liked cricket, which he played for a number of years; he played his B&ouml;sendorfer grand piano all his life.<br>
<br>After completion of the intermediate BSc at school, Ingold moved on to Hartley College, Southampton, in 1911, where he studied chemistry under Professor David Boyd, graduating with an external BSc of the University of London in 1913. This gained him acceptance to work with Professor Jocelyn Thorpe at the Royal College of Science, London, where Ingold received both a Royal College scholarship and a University of London exhibition, giving him &pound;100 for the year 1913&#150;14.<br>
<br>Ingold obtained his associateship of the Royal College of Science with first-class honours in 1914, and started immediately on a research programme. However, this was interrupted by the First World War when, in 1915, Thorpe sent him to Glasgow to run an industrial plant to manufacture SK lachrymator (a mixture of ethyl iodoacetate and alcohol), the tear gas extensively used by the British in shells throughout the war. For this work he was subsequently awarded the British Empire Medal. At the end of the war, his employer, the Cassel Cyanide Company, was anxious to retain his services, but Ingold had already decided that he wanted to follow an academic career. He had continued to collaborate with Thorpe throughout his sojourn in Glasgow, and submitted a thesis based on part of this work for the MSc degree of the University of London in 1919. (He had already received the diploma of membership of Imperial College for his postgraduate research.) Early in 1920 Ingold took a considerable cut in pay to accept an offer from Thorpe to return to Imperial College as a demonstrator in industrial organic chemistry.<h2>
<a name="Earlyresearchandmarriage"></a>Early research and marriage</h2>In the five years from 1920 to 1924 Ingold published fifty-two research papers, was co-author of a 500-page book with Thorpe, obtained the DSc degree from the University of London and, for two years running, won the Meldola medal for the most outstanding research during the year by a chemist under thirty years of age. He was also elected to the Royal Society (at the age of thirty), and was appointed to the chair of organic chemistry at Leeds University, taking up his post on 1 October 1924. During this same period Ingold found the time to woo a brilliant young postgraduate student at Imperial College, (Edith) Hilda Usherwood [<a name="cosubject_56153"></a><span class="headword">(Edith) Hilda Ingold</span>  (1898&#150;1988)<span class="occ"></span>]. They were married on 11 July 1923.<br>
<br>Hilda Ingold was born on 21 May 1898 in Catford, London, the first of three children of Thomas Scriven Usherwood, and his wife, Edith. As all four of Hilda's grandparents were headteachers of London schools, and her father taught engineering at Christ's Hospital school in Horsham, Sussex, Hilda grew up in a learned and literary environment. She won many prizes in school and a scholarship to the renowned North London Collegiate School for Girls, which caused her father to move the family home to Finchley, Middlesex, in 1912, so that Hilda would have easy access to her new school.<br>
<br>After an outstanding academic career at school, Hilda won the largest scholarship available, &pound;50 per year for three years, to study chemistry and botany at Royal Holloway College. There she continued to win awards, including the Gilchrist scholarship, the Neil Arnott scholarship, and the Driver prize and scholarship (twice). In her graduating year, 1920, she won the Martin Holloway prize for the &#145;best and most efficient student, having regard to academic and intellectual distinction&#146;. She graduated with first-class honours in chemistry.<br>
<br>In January 1921 Hilda entered Imperial College and started chemical research under Dr Martha Whiteley towards the PhD degree. Exactly twenty-four months later she submitted her thesis, and she was awarded the degree the following month. She published a number of research papers as sole author and with Martha Whiteley, but she was collaborating with Ingold as early as 1921. They immediately established a rapport, and their chemical collaboration matured rapidly to a personal one. They were both rather shy, but she nevertheless had an engaging vivacity which, coupled with her intelligence, made her the ideal companion for the tall, handsome young lecturer. After their marriage, Hilda became essential to all areas of Ingold's life, and her grace, kindness, good humour, and stalwart common sense enriched the forty-seven years that they were to live and work together.<br>
<br>After their marriage in 1923 Hilda Ingold continued her independent research, obtaining her DSc degree in 1926. However, after the birth of their first daughter, Sylvia, in 1927, research became a less important part of her life. Two more children completed their family, a son, Keith (<i>b</i>. 1929), and a second daughter, Dilys (<i>b</i>. 1932). Although Hilda continued to publish until 1947, she gradually shifted her support of Ingold to the administrative side, and it was in this field that she excelled at University College, London, from about 1939 until her retirement in 1968. She died on 8 August 1988 at Chelmsford.<h2>
<a name="Structureandmechanismsinorganicchemistry"></a>Structure and mechanisms in organic chemistry</h2>In the mid-1920s an extraordinary debate took place in the chemical literature concerning the arrangements of electrons in organic molecules, and how the electrons move between molecules as chemical reactions take place. Many people took part in the debate, but the principal protagonists were Robert Robinson (1886&#150;1975) and Christopher Ingold. During this period, which overlapped Ingold's stay at Imperial College and his time at Leeds, he gradually clarified in his own mind the mechanisms of electron movement in molecules and finally synthesized his ideas into a systematic scheme for reaction mechanisms for the whole of organic chemistry. This scheme gave rise to a new way of thinking about organic reactions and of teaching organic chemistry, which has been in use ever since. While at Leeds, Ingold developed a large, active research group. He also began mountain climbing, which became a major recreational activity almost until the end of his life.<br>
<br>In 1930 the chair of organic chemistry became vacant at University College, London, and Ingold was chosen to fill it. Almost immediately, however, he suffered medical problems with his eyes that required a rest from intensive reading and thus a break from his very heavy load. He took this rest in the form of a six-month leave in California, during which he wrote a review article (&#145;Principles of an electronic theory in organic reactions&#146;, <span class="italic">Chemical Reviews</span>, 15, 1934, 225) summarizing his ideas. When this was published in the USA, it quickly became the seminal statement in the field of organic chemistry and led to the acceptance on both sides of the Atlantic of Ingold's interpretation of the theory of organic reactions.<br>
<br>At the same time that Ingold arrived at University College, Edward Hughes (1906&#150;1963) joined his research group as a postdoctoral fellow, and the two men began a collaboration that ended only with Hughes's death. Together they developed the system of reaction mechanisms for nucleophilic substitution reactions and elimination reactions at saturated carbon (S<sub>N</sub>1, S<sub>N</sub>2, E1, and E2) and elucidated the mechanism by which the Walden inversion occurred.<br>
<br>In the early 1930s deuterium, the isotope of hydrogen with twice its normal mass, was first prepared in quantity. Ingold realized how this could solve the problem, first defined by Kekul&eacute; in 1865, of the structure of the benzene molecule, on which Ingold had been working since 1922. In 1933 Hughes and co-workers started to separate pure heavy water in quantity from ordinary water, and Ingold and co-workers synthesized fully deuterated and half-deuterated benzene, C<sub>6</sub>D<sub>6</sub> and C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>D<sub>3</sub>. Measurement of the infra-red and Raman spectra of these molecules in 1935 allowed the proof to be made that the benzene molecule did indeed have a plane regular hexagonal structure. The complete analysis of the structure required the synthesis of benzene molecules containing one, two, four, and five atoms of deuterium per molecule. This difficult task was interrupted by the Second World War, during which the research laboratories of University College were evacuated to Aberystwyth. The final experiments were completed in the autumn of 1943 and the results published in 1945. By an analysis of the infra-red and Raman spectra of ordinary benzene, fully deuterated benzene, and five partially deuterated benzenes, twenty-nine of the thirty normal vibrations that occur in the molecule were identified with particular observed absorption bands. This allowed Ingold to calculate the complete internal force system of the benzene molecule.<br>
<br>This was probably the greatest scientific contribution of Ingold's many research efforts. It won him the Bakerian lecture award in 1938, the Davy medal of the Royal Society in 1946, and, in 1953, an honorary degree from the University of Bologna, an ancient seat of learning that had rarely given such an award to a foreigner; in this last honour Ingold trod in the footsteps of Copernicus and Erasmus.<br>
<br>Ingold followed this work with further ground-breaking studies on the excited state of benzene and on the excited state of acetylene, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>. The latter study demonstrated the first example of an excited state that was radically different in its geometry from the ground state. The excited state of acetylene was found to have a bent geometry, whereas the ground state is linear. In the field of reaction mechanisms, major advances were the identification of the nitronium ion, NO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, as the active reagent in the nitric acid nitration reaction of aromatic molecules, and the general elucidation of the mechanisms of these reactions. In 1949 Ingold wrote twenty-two papers on this subject which were published in 1950 in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Chemical Society</span>, running consecutively and occupying 285 pages.<br>
<br>In 1950 Ingold spent four months at Cornell University during which time he wrote his <i>magnum opus</i>, <span class="italic">Structure and Mechanism in Organic Chemistry</span>, published in 1953. It immediately assumed the status of &#145;bible&#146; of organic chemistry in the Western world and eventually in the communist world, where Ingold's ideas had long been resisted. Ingold was finally received in Moscow in 1959, the year after he received a knighthood, and his book sold out on the first day of its publication in the USSR.<h2>
<a name="Laterresearchandretirement"></a>Later research and retirement</h2>During the 1950s and 1960s Ingold worked, in conjunction with R. Cahn and V. Prelog, on the sequence rule for the specification of the positions of four different groups tetrahedrally bonded to a chiral carbon atom. Since the mid-1950s their CIP sequence rule has been used throughout the world to specify the R (<i>rectus</i>) or S (<i>sinister</i>) handedness of a chiral (optically active) molecule.<br>
<br>Ingold officially retired in 1961 but University College continued to appoint him annually as a special lecturer. He continued to lecture there and to accept invitations to speak around the world. He gave his last major talk in Venice in June 1970, and then commenced a gentle decline leading to his death at his home of forty years at 12 Handel Close, Edgware, on 8 December 1970. The cause of death was recorded as cerebrovascular degeneration and arteriosclerosis.<br>
<br>Ingold received a great many honours, awards, honorary degrees, and visiting lectureships during his lifetime. His contribution to chemistry was succinctly encapsulated in the citation for the royal medal awarded to him by the Royal Society in 1952: &#145;it would be fair to say that no man has contributed with such detailed exactness and with such breadth of theoretical vision to our knowledge of the mechanism of organic reactions as has Ingold.&#146;<br>
