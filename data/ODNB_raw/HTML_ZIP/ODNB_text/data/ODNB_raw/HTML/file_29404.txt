<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilderspin,  Samuel</span>  (1791&#150;1866), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born on 23 March 1791 in Hornsey, London, the son of Alexander and Ann Wilderspin. His father, a follower of Swedenborg, was a member of the Church of the New Jerusalem, founded in London in 1787. Wilderspin was separated from his parents at the age of seven, sent to a school in central London, and later apprenticed as a calenderer in the textile trade. About 1819, while serving as a clerk to the minister of a New Jerusalem church in south London, he met James Buchanan, a fellow Swedenborgian, recently arrived from Robert Owen's famous school in New Lanark to open the first London infant school at Brewer's Green, Westminster. When Joseph Wilson, a London silk merchant, decided in 1820 to open a similar infant school in Spitalfields, Buchanan recommended Wilderspin and his wife, Sarah Anne (whom he married in 1811), as master and mistress. With some help from Buchanan and occasional visits from Owen, Wilderspin evolved innovative methods of teaching large groups of children from two to six years of age. These were described in his first book, <span class="italic">On the Importance of Educating the Infant Children of the Poor</span>, published in 1823, which also emphasized the need for education as a means of combating juvenile crime and raising the social level of the poor.<br>
<br>Wilderspin's school in Spitalfields attracted many visitors and led to the formation of the Infant School Society, a middle-class philanthropic organization, in 1824. Wilderspin became the society's agent, travelling on horseback or by gig throughout Britain to found and popularize infant schools on his model. On the demise of the society in 1828, he settled in Cheltenham and began a career as a freelance educator. From early 1828 to late 1830 he spent most of his time in Scotland, perfecting his system and devising novel means of publicity, involving public lectures, examinations, and parades of children through the streets. Following the death of his first wife, he married in 1826 Jane Mary Peacock, who probably died in 1828.<br>
<br>Wilderspin relinquished his active role in the New Jerusalem church in 1825, and later became a nominal Anglican, but he remained a Swedenborgian at heart. Swedenborg's educational theory rested on his conviction that infancy was a state of innocence, that the child was endowed with curiosity and a love of knowledge, and that education was a developmental process from a blank mind to wisdom. Although Wilderspin was inspired by the practice of Owen and Buchanan, and was familiar with the concepts of Pestalozzi and the phrenologists, he derived most of his principles from the Swedenborgian canon, combining them with his own practice to produce a new, if not entirely consistent, system of infant teaching. This was based on short classroom lessons in an inclined gallery, the stimulation of the senses of the child by the use of apparatus, pictures, and objects, and an emphasis on play, using the playground both as an arena for activity and a site for the formation of character. His ultimate aim was to inculcate moral principles based on Christian love and charity but without religious dogma or ceremony. Although sometimes burdened by an excess of inert knowledge and repetitive memory work, his system at its best was far in advance of the methods of his time and anticipated much of twentieth-century early childhood education.<br>
<br>After twelve years of travel throughout England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales (during which time some 270 infant schools were established, mostly on his model), Wilderspin accepted a series of important educational engagements. In 1836&#150;7 he organized the non-denominational school system of Liverpool town council, introducing progressive changes which aroused the fierce opposition of Anglican and conservative forces. Early in 1838, at the invitation of the commissioners of national education in Ireland, he took charge of the Dublin model infant school, and subsequently of all three of the model schools; but after an altercation with one of the Catholic commissioners his contract was not renewed and he left Dublin in August 1839. Between these two engagements, in the latter part of 1837, he had taken part in the Central Society of Education's campaign for a state-supported national system of education, incurring the wrath of influential evangelicals in his home town of Cheltenham.<br>
<br>On his return to England from Dublin in August 1839, Wilderspin found that his difficulties in Ireland, and his three-year absence from his work as a travelling infant school missionary, had diminished his reputation. Both church and state refused to employ him, but many of his ideas and practices were adopted, without acknowledgement, by both the largely evangelical Home and Colonial School Society and the committee of council on education. His fame in Britain rested not only on his practical work as an educational innovator but also on his numerous books. In addition to <span class="italic">On the Importance of Educating the Infant Children of the Poor</span>, which went through seven further editions (with varying titles and added content) between 1823 and 1852, Wilderspin published <span class="italic">Early Discipline</span>, an account of his travels, in 1832 (second edition 1834); <span class="italic">A System of Education for the Young</span> (1840); and, with his son-in-law T. J. Terrington, <span class="italic">A Manual for the Religious and Moral Instruction of Young Children in the Nursery and Infant School</span> (1845). His reputation spread abroad, and infant schools on his model were opened in France, Austria, Hungary, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, and the USA.<br>
<br>In the early 1840s lack of employment forced Wilderspin to the edge of destitution. He was saved by the patronage of Daniel and Mary Gaskell of Lupset Hall, Wakefield, in Yorkshire, who supported him both morally and materially. After a short time as master of the infant school at Barton upon Humber, Lincolnshire, with his third wife, Mary Dowding (they had married in 1838), he retired to Wakefield in 1848. There he spent an active retirement as a prominent member of the local mechanics' institute. In 1846 he had been granted a civil-list pension of &pound;100 per annum, and also received an annuity of &pound;40 from the interest on &pound;1818 collected as a &#145;national tribute&#146; by the efforts of the Gaskells. Wilderspin died in Wakefield on 10 March 1866, and was buried in Thornes churchyard.<br>
