<span class="headword">Spiller,  Joel</span>  (1804&#150;1853), <span class="occ">corn factor and miller</span>, was born in Bridgwater, Somerset, the son of an ironmonger there. The family was, allegedly, of Flemish origin. In April 1829 Spiller married Sarah Taylor Durston, and in the same year he set up in business as a corn factor and dealer from a shop in St Mary Street, Bridgwater.<br>
<br>Spiller was a free-trade activist in Bridgwater, supporting the Liberal cause as did his friend, the shipowner James Sully, whose main business was transporting bricks to south Wales and returning with coal. The potential for carrying corn and flour to the expanding coal and iron communities of south Wales was obvious and was exploited by Joel Spiller during the 1830s; his mercantile business prospered and in 1840 he went into partnership with Samuel Woolcott Browne, son of Captain Charles Browne RN, a Bridgwater banker. A substantial four-storey warehouse was built on West Quay and the office was in Castle Street. The opening of a new dock in Bridgwater in 1841 enabled vessels of 500 tons to reach the town, but the town bridge and the vagaries of the tides were to be a limiting factor to the local ambitions of Spiller and Browne and to the industrial development of the city.<br>
<br>In the early 1840s Spiller and Browne diversified into milling, building a steam mill in Chilton Street. On the repeal of the corn laws in 1846 they expanded the business, renting three local water mills. However, as Britain increased her imports of North American wheat, ports on the west coast and in south Wales became prime locations for steam-driven flour mills. Cardiff was clearly a more promising location for business expansion and in 1852 Spiller and Browne leased a site on which to build a 1200-sack steam mill, at the head of the new west dock, from the marquess of Bute.<br>
<br>Joel Spiller died, aged forty-nine, during the construction of the Cardiff mill. On one of his visits to the site, in June 1853, he grazed his shin. The injury did not seem to demand attention but within a day or so the wound had turned septic. Spiller returned home to Bridgwater where he died on 7 June leaving a widow and three children. Highly esteemed locally, he was widely acknowledged to have been the architect of his own fortune. He was buried in Wembdon Road cemetery, Bridgwater.<br>
<br>After Spiller's death, Browne took two of their brothers-in-law into partnership: Charles Thompson, husband of Browne's sister Marian, and William Allen, who had married Spiller's sister. Both men were to make important contributions to the management of the concern, which became a limited liability company in 1887 with a paid-up capital of &pound;440,000.<br>
