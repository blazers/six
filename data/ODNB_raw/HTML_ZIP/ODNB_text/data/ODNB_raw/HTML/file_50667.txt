<span class="headword">Ward, Sir  (Alfred) Dudley</span>  (1905&#150;1991), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 27 January 1905 in Avenue Road, Wimborne, Dorset, the son of Lionel Howell Ward, accountant in poor law, and his wife, Lillie Maud (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Morgan). He was educated at Wimborne grammar school, was a chorister in Wimborne Minster, and began his career as an apprentice of the Eastern Telegraph Company in Gibraltar. In 1924 he enlisted in the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire regiment and, after being selected from the ranks as a potential officer, was sent to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, from which he was commissioned into the Dorset regiment in 1929. On 29 April 1933 he married Beatrice Constance Griffith (<i>d</i>. 1962), daughter of the Revd Thomas Francis Griffith, of The Bourne, Farnham, Surrey. There was one daughter of the marriage, Jill Beatrice (<i>b</i>. 1935). Meanwhile Ward served in India and on the north-west frontier before attending the Staff College, Quetta, where he was taught by the future Field Marshal Montgomery. After graduation he transferred to the King's (Liverpool) regiment in 1937, served on the staff in military intelligence, returned to the Staff College as an instructor, served on the staff again, and then was appointed to command 43rd reconnaissance regiment.<br>
<br>In 1943 Ward was promoted to command the 17th infantry brigade, which advanced from Sicily through Italy during 1943&#150;4. The skill he demonstrated in various river crossings and pitched battles on rugged terrain led to command of the 4th (British) division. In the May 1944 offensive at Cassino he displayed outstanding leadership, for the division had the task of crossing the strongly fortified Rapido River, close to the bombed ruins of the monastery. Although at times it seemed that the task might be too difficult Ward's determination and initiative ensured that it was a success. Similar skills and determination were displayed in subsequent battles for Lake Trasimene, Florence, and the penetration of the Gothic and Rimini lines (as the German fortifications across the peninsula were called). At the end of a gruelling campaign, when his division was expecting a lengthy rest and rehabilitation in Egypt, it was switched to Greece, where the communists were rebelling against Papandreou's pro-allied government with a view to installing their own regime. Although initially it seemed that his resources were insufficient for the task, and his own headquarters was attacked by ELAS (the communist National People's Liberation Army), he eventually outfought his opponents and cleared Athens.<br>
<br>After the end of the Second World War Ward was director of military operations at the War Office from 1947 to 1948, and commandant of the Staff College, Camberley, from 1948 to 1951, before becoming commander of 1st corps in Germany&#151;a position he held from 1951 to 1952. In 1953 he returned to England to become deputy chief of the Imperial General Staff, but he was back in Germany as commander, northern army group, and commander-in-chief of the British army of the Rhine from 1957 to 1959. His next appointment was that of commander-in-chief, British forces, Near East, where he set up the sovereign base in Cyprus. From 1962 to 1965 he was governor of Gibraltar, a vital point in NATO strategy, where he had to keep a wary eye on General Franco, who was conducting a campaign to have the Rock returned to Spain, and might have tried a military coup. Ward's combination of tact and firmness were very reassuring to the Gibraltarians. On a personal level, Ward's time in Gibraltar was marked both by tragedy and happiness. On 17 October 1962, shortly after arriving in Gibraltar, his first wife, Beatrice, died. On 28 September 1963 Ward married Joan Elspeth de Pechell Scott (<i>b</i>. 1920/21), head of the Red Cross in Gibraltar, and daughter of Colonel Donald Charles Scott, of the Royal Army Medical Corps. There were no children of this second marriage.<br>
<br>One of Ward's particular skills was assessing risks. During his time as director of military operations, the Soviet Union had been testing allied resolve by interfering with road and rail access to Berlin, activities which culminated in the 1948 blockade. When subsequently commanding NATO forces in Germany, Ward had to decide what, if any, response should be made to provocative gestures by the Russians: he was only too well aware that overreaction might trigger a third world war. Ward was a soldier who thought and planned ahead realistically, and trained his men accordingly. However, he knew when to delegate. He also believed that life should be enjoyed. As a young man he had been an excellent athlete (army champion at 100 and 220 yards); later he took up sailing and golf. He was appointed DSO in 1944, and made CBE and CB in 1945, KBE in 1953, KCB in 1957, and GCB in 1959.<br>
<br>Ward died of bronchopneumonia and cancer of the colon at his home, Wynneys Farmhouse, Dennington, Woodbridge, Suffolk, on 28 December 1991. He was survived by his second wife, and by the daughter of his first marriage. A memorial service was held at the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, on 25 March 1992.<br>
