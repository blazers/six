<span class="headword">Southerey,  Simon</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1342, <em>d.</em> in or after 1420), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk</span>, was born possibly on the Norfolk estates of St Albans Abbey. He probably entered Hertford Priory, a dependency of St Albans, shortly after 1360, because he was ordained priest as a monk of the priory on 28 February 1366. He studied at Gloucester College, Oxford, during the 1370s, and was a doctor of theology by 1388 when, together with other graduates, he was cited to appear in chancery following serious disturbances between northerners and southerners at the university. Bale suggests he was present at the second session of the Blackfriars Council, convened in 1382 to condemn the work of John Wyclif, but may have confused him with his St Albans contemporary Nicholas Radcliffe. In 1389, as <i>prior studentium</i> of Gloucester College, Southerey defended the community against the attempts of William Courtenay, archbishop of Canterbury (<i>d</i>. 1396), to subject it to visitation. The St Albans chronicler, Thomas Walsingham, suggests that it was the force of Southerey's arguments that deterred the archbishop. In 1390 he was appointed prior of Belvoir, another dependency of St Albans, and remained there until the death of the abbot, Thomas de la Mare, in 1396. In addition to these responsibilities he was in constant demand as a representative of his order. In 1392 he was the only Benedictine to be present at the trial at Stamford of the suspected Wycliffite Henry Crump, and throughout the 1390s he was involved in the work of the Benedictine general chapters, serving as elector of the presidents in 1393 and as preacher at a chapter meeting <i>c</i>.1396. Soon after the election of Abbot John Moot in 1396, Southerey became prior of St Albans, and remained in office at least until 1401, when he supervised the election of William Heyworth as abbot. From 1396 to 1399 he was in receipt of a royal pension and in 1419 he became a papal chaplain; these were both unusual distinctions for a monk who was not an abbot, and are therefore an indication of Southerey's prestige.<br>
<br>Southerey was distinguished as a theologian, an opponent of the works of John Wyclif, an astronomer, and a poet whose work perhaps prefigured the humanists of the later fifteenth century. Walsingham wrote that not only were &#145;many turned away from the errors of John Wyclif as a result of his preaching&#146;, but also that Southerey was &#145;very able in the art of versification, and in astronomy and astrology, and in the study of poetry is considered the most learned in the whole kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annales &hellip; Amundesham</span>, 2.305). Southerey may have been the author of several theological works; Bale attributes three texts to him without incipits, <span class="italic">Super ecclesie auctoritate</span>, <span class="italic">De sacramento altaris</span>, and <span class="italic">Contra Wyclevistas</span>, but none of these survives. A fragment of an astrological almanac attributed to Southerey survives in a single manuscript  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Digby 98, fol. 32), and it was perhaps for his astrological writing that he attracted the attention of Richard II and received a royal pension. Although none of his literary works is known to survive, he was praised by other writers for his knowledge of grammar, poetry, and classical literature. Walsingham dedicated his <span class="italic">Archana deorum</span>, a commentary on Ovid's <span class="italic">Metamorphoses</span>, to Southerey, and praised him for his great knowledge of classical fables. In the same way, the London grammar-master John Seward (<i>d</i>. 1435), who wrote a lengthy treatise, the <span class="italic">Somnium</span>, in Southerey's honour, presents him as a distinguished teacher of the rules of grammar and the art of metre. Through his association with Seward, Southerey may have been linked to other scholars who were also friends of the grammar-master, including Richard Courtenay, bishop of Norwich (<i>d</i>. 1415), and John Leyland, another celebrated grammarian.<br>
<br>Southerey was still alive in September 1420 at the election of Abbot John Whethamstede, although he was then among the sick confined to the infirmary. He probably died soon after; the year is unknown, but the day, 3 November, is recorded in the martyrology of Belvoir Priory.<br>
