<span class="headword">Lloyd,  David</span>  (1642/3&#150;1723), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Ffosybleiddiaid, Cardiganshire, the second of three sons of Oliver Lloyd (1610&#150;1668) and Jane, daughter of John Lloyd of Llanll&#375;r. He was entered as a volunteer on the <i>Phoenix</i> on 2 November 1671 and, later, as an able seaman. In June 1672 he was promoted to lieutenant and appointed to the <i>Henry</i>. Discharged at the end of the Third Anglo-Dutch War, in 1674, he was appointed a cornet in the earl of Oxford's regiment, from which he was given leave to take up the captaincy of the <i>Mermaid</i> in September 1677. He served in the North Sea with Sir John Holmes, who later accused him of having insolently claimed that &#145;the only difference between us was the flag&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. A191, fol. 99). Lloyd escorted William and Mary back to the Netherlands, following their marriage. When he returned to England he found himself in trouble with Pepys for leaving the <i>Mermaid</i>, without permission, in the Downs but, despite their earlier dispute, Holmes took Lloyd's side. Lloyd was appointed captain of the <i>Reserve</i> in June 1678 and, shortly before he sailed for Tangier, he provided Samuel Atkins, Pepys's clerk, with an alibi (that they had been in an alehouse) when Atkins was accused of being involved in the murder of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey.<br>
<br>It was probably because of this alibi that Pepys had Lloyd appointed captain of the <i>Dover</i> in June 1679 and sent as convoy to Newfoundland. Lloyd returned to England in March 1680, when he was dismissed, but in November 1680 he was appointed captain of the <i>Crown</i> and served in the Mediterranean under Arthur Herbert (1680&#150;83). When Atkins arrived in Tangier in 1681 he asked to serve under Lloyd, whom he regarded as &#145;the best governed, soberest, reasonable man my conversation ever fell with&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. A183). In December 1681 Lloyd helped to capture a large Algerian ship, the <i>Golden Rose</i>, after a long fight. When Herbert returned to England in June 1683 Lloyd remained with Cloudesley Shovell. The <i>Crown</i>'s leaks &#145;being so low not to be stopt otherwise&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 106/376, fol. 492), Shovell ordered Lloyd back to England. When George Legge, Baron Dartmouth, arrived in 1683 to demolish Tangier he learned that Lloyd was on his way back to England and promptly recalled him. While in Tangier Pepys discovered that Lloyd was &#145;a very good artist and curious in it above any gentleman captain&#146;  (<span class="italic">Tangier Papers</span>, 134).<br>
<br>Lloyd was appointed a groom of the bedchamber to James II in May 1685. In May 1687 he was appointed captain of the <i>Sedgemoor</i> and took James Fitzjames, the king's illegitimate son, with him as a volunteer. The <i>Sedgemoor</i> was part of the fleet commanded by Henry, duke of Grafton, that escorted the new queen of Portugal to Lisbon and then sailed into the Mediterranean to make sure the peace treaty negotiated with Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli remained intact. When Grafton returned to England in 1687 Lloyd remained in the Mediterranean with Shovell; he did not return to England until mid-December 1688, by which time the invasion of William of Orange was accomplished. Lloyd followed James into exile in 1689 and was appointed a groom of the bedchamber, whereupon the House of Commons proclaimed him a traitor. After William and Mary had been crowned James, &#145;inveighing, with tears, against his daughters&#146;, told Lloyd that the behaviour of his younger daughter, Anne, was worse than Mary's. Lloyd, &#145;who had turned impatiently away, put his head round the door to remark &#147;Both bitches, by God!&#148;&#146;  (H. W. Chapman, <span class="italic">Mary II Queen of England</span>, 172).<br>
<br>Lloyd became an active secret agent for James, travelling back and forth between England and St Germain. He was in England in 1691, sounding out Edward Russell and John Churchill about helping James to return, and carried back Lord Dartmouth's &#145;proffer of service&#146;  (Clarke, 2.446&#150;7, 450). While in England Lloyd drew up a &#145;Memorandum of persons well inclined to his Mjies interest&#146;  (Lloyd, vol. 3, pt 3, no. 232). He was also named as the possible commander-in-chief of any invasion fleet. He returned to England in 1692 &#145;with instructions to the King's friends&#146;  (Clarke, 2.477). He met Edward Russell several times in connection with bringing the English fleet over to James, but in vain. Lloyd was again declared a traitor but he managed to avoid capture and he returned to St Germain with a letter from Princess Anne to her father.<br>
<br>Lloyd was in England again in March 1694, when he met John Churchill again and held further meetings with Russell. He continued to act as a go-between for James and his supporters in England and gave naval advice to Louis XIV, for which he was paid &#145;some 3000 livres a year&#146;  (Hilton Jones, <span class="italic">Mainstream of Jacobitism</span>, 41) until 1701, when, following James's death, he seems to have retired and lived in France. In 1703 he was among the &#145;friends indefinite&#146; left a mourning ring by Samuel Pepys  (<span class="italic">Private Correspondence</span>, 2.318). He appears to have returned to England some time before 1708; there he was &#145;living very cautiously&#146; when Charles, earl of Middleton, wrote to assure him that his son would be looked after. Lloyd died, aged eighty, on 4 January 1723, while drinking a dish of chocolate at the Cocoa Tree in Pall Mall. His son having died before him, administration of his estate was granted, on 19 February 1723, to his only daughter, Briany.<br>
