<span class="headword">Innes <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Robertson]</span>,  Emily Anne</span>  (1843&#150;1927), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born on 5 March 1843 in Boxley, Kent, the third of the six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23801/', "James Craigie Robertson (1813&#150;1882)")</script>, curate of Boxley, and his wife, Julia Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stevenson (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1884). In 1859 her father, a distinguished theologian and church historian, became a canon and the librarian of Canterbury Cathedral. Emily, of whose education nothing is known, was then sixteen. Her siblings left home for marriage or a career but for fifteen years she lived among the cathedral clergy wives as her mother's companion. However, on 28 January 1875, in the cathedral she married a colonial official, James Innes (1834&#150;1901), son of an eminent Scottish antiquary, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14428/', "Cosmo Innes")</script>.<br>
<br>Soon after their marriage James Innes took his new wife out to Sarawak, where he was government treasurer. He was a slack, incompetent administrator who drank too much. But until his death in 1901 Emily was a dutiful and loyal wife and a ferocious champion of her husband. Her slightly wistful references to Malay children hint at disappointment that she had none. But it was a marriage of companionship that both needed. In 1876 Innes lost his job in Sarawak but secured a district officer's post at Kuala Langat, the royal capital of Selangor, which had recently come under British control. For six years the couple lived in Selangor with a brief interval in neighbouring Perak. For Emily it was a period of uncomfortable living in remote places, a time of loneliness and tedium, interrupted occasionally by a crisis. She studied the Malay language in books and practised it with her visitors. She dispensed what medicines she had, noting that few of her patients died, and she helped to tackle a local outbreak of cholera. To recover her health she visited the district officer and his family on Pangkor island. Chinese robbers broke into the house, killed the husband, and left his wife and Emily Innes unconscious. The arrival of the two women at Penang, bearing the marks of the attack, caused &#145;a considerable sensation&#146;  (Innes, <span class="italic">Chersonese</span>, 2.115).<br>
<br>As the years went by James and Emily Innes fell out with residents and other officials and their wives, and became more isolated than ever. In Perak James Innes objected to Hugh Low's policy of tolerating Malay debt-bondage, an institution that Europeans regarded as a form of slavery. Low recognized the superior intelligence and marital influence of the wife and lent her official papers setting out his policy of gradualism. But loyalty to her husband made her obdurate. Although hostile to Low, the most talented resident of his time, Emily Innes nevertheless had a grudging respect for him. After returning to Selangor, James Innes quarrelled ever more bitterly with Bloomfield Douglas, the resident, and resigned at the end of 1881, to return to England.<br>
<br>In the course of her brief visit to the Malay states in 1879 Isabella Bird, the celebrated traveller, did not come to the station at which James and Emily Innes then lived. When Bird's book <span class="italic">The Golden Chersonese</span> appeared in 1883 Emily, back in London, conceded that everything in it was &#145;perfectly and literally true&#146;  (Innes, <span class="italic">Chersonese</span>, 2.242). But her <span class="italic">The Chersonese with the Gilding Off</span> (1885) recorded what Bird had hardly seen and so not mentioned. The book is the basis of her fame. Much of it is a detailed account of her experiences and hardships, written with a bitterness that, according to an American historian, bore &#145;the marks of paranoia&#146;  (Heussler, 67). When published it attracted little attention. Bird, preoccupied with personal problems, did not respond. However, modern historians, in search of contemporary evidence of early colonial rule, have recognized its value as a vivid and perceptive picture of the Selangor Malay &eacute;lite then coming to terms with colonialism, and the book was republished in 1974 with an introduction by a leading Malayan historian. Although she writes unsympathetically Emily Innes gives a good description of the Malay lifestyle and of the individuals she knew. There are lighter touches, as when she tells of her unlikely friendship with an elderly Malay aristocrat, formerly a pirate. Invited to tea and tennis, he scampered about hitting the ball high in the air with much satisfaction. He declined tea but was refreshed with Bass's pale ale in homeopathic doses.<br>
<br>Refused a pension by the Colonial Office, James Innes scratched a living in the 1880s as a London tea broker until money inherited from parents came to sustain him and his wife. Emily spent her last years at Nairn in Scotland in reflected glory, near where the Innes family had been lairds. Her neighbour was Lord Finlay, a former lord chancellor and husband of her sister-in-law. She died at Drummuir, Albert Street, Nairn, on 7 November 1927, of pneumonia. She was an intolerant and quarrelsome snob, but her gifts of observation and description made a valuable contribution to Malayan historiography. Her courage and determination in face of adversity also deserve respect.<br>
