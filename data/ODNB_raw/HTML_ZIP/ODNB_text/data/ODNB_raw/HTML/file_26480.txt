<span class="headword">Stewart,  James</span>, second earl of Moray  (1565/6&#150;1592), <span class="occ">magnate and murder victim</span>, was the eldest son of James Stewart, first Lord Doune (<i>c</i>.1529&#150;1590), and his wife, Margaret Campbell (<i>b</i>. after 1541, <i>d</i>. 1592), daughter of the fourth earl of Argyll. In 1580 the young James married his distant cousin Elizabeth Stewart, <i>suo jure</i> countess of Moray (1565&#150;1591), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26479/', "James Stewart, first earl of Moray")</script> and regent of Scotland, who had been assassinated in 1570. Along with Elizabeth's wealth, lands, and title, Moray acquired her family's long-running feud with the sixth earl of Huntly, and also its reputation as a bastion of protestantism. Huntly, the pre-eminent magnate of north-east Scotland (where the Moray earldom was also located), was Scotland's Catholic champion. In 1590 Moray, together with John Stewart, fifth earl of Atholl, tried to challenge Huntly's local power by supporting clans&#151;especially the Grants and the Macintoshes&#151;which had revolted against Huntly. A conflict ensued (a mixture of open warfare and court politics), and by the end of 1591 Huntly had emerged victorious. In the meantime Francis Stewart, earl of Bothwell, Moray's kinsman and ally, had begun a series of attempts to seize the person of King James that would transform Scottish politics. Afraid for his life, James became obsessed with Bothwell and all who supported him. Huntly, as possibly the most powerful man in Scotland, was commissioned to hunt down Bothwell and his supporters.<br>
<br>Early in February 1592 the king used Andrew, Lord Ochiltree, yet another Stewart nobleman, to persuade Moray to go south to discuss issues concerning both Bothwell and his feud with Huntly. However, on 7 February, Huntly went with an armed company to Donibristle in Fife, near the northern shore of the Firth of Forth, where Moray was staying with his mother. Accounts of what happened next vary, but there is agreement that later the same day the castle was set on fire, the sheriff of Moray, who had accompanied the earl, was slain when he tried to flee, and Moray himself was hunted down and killed among the rocks by the sea. The story told by both Spottiswood and Calderwood is that Moray would have escaped had he not been spotted because the top of his hat had caught fire.<br>
<br>Was this a prearranged plot to kill Moray and, if so, was the king party to it? Definite knowledge is impossible, but the facts do seem to point to some sort of plot, not least because James's reaction &#145;was one of official outrage and actual indifference&#146;  (Brown, 157). Calderwood's explanation is that Huntly &#145;hated the Erle of Murrey, partlie becaus he hated that hous for the Good Regent's sake; partlie becaus the erle was suspected to be a favourer of Bothwell&#146;  (Calderwood, 5.144). Huntly, on the other hand, was a great favourite with the king. Other contemporaries blamed the chancellor, John Maitland, Lord Thirlestane. The ballad known as &#145;The Bonny Earl of Moray&#146; gives voice to the traditional grounds for suspecting James's connivance in Moray's death when it exclaims:<blockquote>
<div>And the bonny earl of Moray<br>
</div>
<div>Oh he was the Queen's love!<br>
</div> (Sargent and Kittredge, 444)</blockquote>However, none of the major contemporary sources mention this, though they do comment on the earl's handsomeness. This is just one reason for doubting that the ballad is contemporary. Moray's family did commission ballads and other propaganda&#151;including a gruesome &#145;death portrait&#146;, now at Darnaway Castle&#151;but this was part of a campaign to seek royal justice, and would not have included material gratuitously offensive to the king. The present ballad can only be traced back to the second edition of William Thomson's <span class="italic">Orpheus Caledonius</span> (1733). A completely different ballad with the same title appeared in John Finlay's <span class="italic">Scottish Historical and Romantic Ballads, Chiefly Ancient</span>, in 1808.<br>
<br>Moray's murder caused a sensation in Scotland and tremendous popular outrage, so much so that the king felt obliged to leave Edinburgh for a time. This was partly because the ministers saw the dead man as a protestant champion killed by a Catholic. The earl's mother took his body back to Edinburgh, where it lay unburied for at least six years, a visible call for vengeance; she herself died within a few months, cursing the king's name. A raid to apprehend Huntly had been announced on 10 February, but it was cancelled when Huntly promised to enter in ward in Blackness Castle and to abide a trial for the crime. His defence was that Moray had been killed while resisting the execution of the king's commission to apprehend Bothwell's followers. Huntly was released within a few days and never stood trial. Four men were eventually executed for the murder: Captain John Gordon, a brother of Gordon of Gight, and another man were tried and executed within a few days of the deed at the insistence of Lord Ochiltree. Robert Innes of Innermarky was captured by Moray's brother Henry Stewart, later Lord St Colm, in 1595: he was subsequently tried and executed along with one of his servants. In 1603 a peace agreement was finally worked out between Huntly and the third earl of Moray&#151;it entailed the latter's marriage to Huntly's daughter, but other clauses were kept secret.<br>
<br>The murder of Moray had a powerful long-term effect on Scottish politics. The desire for revenge, especially by the Stewart lords, merged with faction fights, Spanish plots, and Bothwellian raids to unsettle Scotland until 1595; and the murder remained a live issue long afterwards, becoming a permanent part of Scottish historical consciousness. Moray himself had arguably been a relatively unimportant, even incompetent, figure, but in his death he achieved fame and glory. His wife, who bore him two sons, the younger of whom was the courtier <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70624/', "Sir Francis Stewart")</script>, and three daughters and who was more competent and energetic than her husband, predeceased him on 18 November 1591. Moray was eventually buried some time after 16 February 1598 in Regent Moray's aisle, St Giles's, Edinburgh.<br>
