<span class="headword">Sims,  John</span>  (1749&#150;1831), <span class="occ">physician and botanist</span>, was the son of Robert Courthope Sims, a member of the Society of Friends, who for sixty years practised as a physician at Dunmow, Essex, and was the author of <span class="italic">An Essay on the Nature and Constitution of Man</span> (1793), and of <span class="italic">The Constitution and Economy of Man's Nature</span> (1807). John Sims was born in Canterbury on 13 October 1749, and was educated partly at the Quaker academy in Burford, Oxfordshire, and partly by his father, who was a good classical scholar. In 1770 he proceeded to the University of Edinburgh, and, after passing the session of 1773&#150;4 at Leiden, graduated MD at Edinburgh in 1774, his inaugural dissertation being &#145;De usu aquae frigidae interno&#146;.<br>
<br>Sims settled in London and bought the practice of Thomas Cogan in Paternoster Row; in 1779 he was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians. He had a large practice, with many of his patients coming from the Quaker community. In 1790 he married Ann (<i>d</i>. 1835) and with her had six children. Sims was obliged to resign from the Society of Friends in 1790 as his wife was not a Quaker. He became physician to the Surrey Dispensary and to the Charity for Delivering Poor Married Women in their own houses. A renowned accoucheur, in 1814 he examined Joanna Southcott, the religious mystic, who had announced that she was pregnant with the Shiloh. Sims wrote an article in the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> claiming that Southcott was not pregnant but was suffering from mental delusion and diseased internal organs. After her death in 1818 Sims was present at the examination of her body, but no cause of death was ascertained. Sims also acted as physician to Princess Charlotte and attended her labour in 1817, when complications arose.<br>
<br>Sims edited William Curtis's <span class="italic">Botanical Magazine</span> from 1801 to 1826, and the <span class="italic">Annals of Botany</span> from 1805 to 1806, in conjunction with Charles Konig. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1814 and was a member of the society's midwifery committee. He was also one of the original fellows of the Linnean Society. In January 1826 Sims gave to the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, a set of objects which he had been given by Thomas Guest, a former army surgeon in the employ of the Sierra Leone Company. Sims's donation to the Ashmolean (now in the Pitt-Rivers Museum, Oxford) comprised a bow, quiver of arrows, a pair of sandals, knife, and a pocket or pouch. They have been traced to the Fula traders who brought goods to Freeport on the Rio Pongo, north of Freetown, and were described by Guest (15 June 1797) as &#145;the complete Accoutrements of an Inhabitant of the Mandingo Country&#146;  (Coote, 154). In this period Sims was resident at 37 Wimpole Street, London.<br>
<br>Some time after 1826 Sims left the capital and retired to Dorking, Surrey, where he died on 26 February 1831. He was buried on 5 March 1831 in Fittleworth, Sussex, where his son Courthope was a curate.<br>
<br>Sims was commemorated by Robert Brown in the Mexican genus of Compositae, <i>Simsia</i>. His herbarium was purchased by George Bentham, and was located at Kew. Sims contributed an account of the expansion of Mesembryanthemum under the influence of moisture to the <span class="italic">Medical and Physical Journal</span> (vol. 2, 1799), and a &#145;Description of <i>Amomum exscapum</i>&#146; to the <span class="italic">Annals of Botany</span> (vol. 1).<br>
