<span class="headword">Neubauer,  Adolf</span>  (1832&#150;1907), <span class="occ">Hebrew scholar</span>, was born at Bitsche, Kottes&oacute;, Trentsen, in northern Hungary, on 7 March 1832, the son of Jacob Neubauer, a Jewish merchant and Talmudic scholar, and his wife, Amalie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Langfelder. Intended by his father to become a rabbi, Neubauer was taught Hebrew by his cousin, Moses Neubauer, also a Talmudic scholar. About 1850 he taught at the Jewish school at Kottes&oacute;; soon afterwards he left for Prague, where he attended the lectures of the critical rabbinical scholar S. J. L. Rapoport, learned French, Italian, and Arabic, studied mathematics, and finally, on 15 December 1853, matriculated at Prague University. Between 1854 and 1856 he studied oriental languages at the University of Munich.<br>
<br>In 1857 Neubauer moved to Paris, where he resided until 1868, except for visits to various libraries to examine manuscripts, and a period in Jerusalem, where he held a post at the Austrian consulate. In Paris he discovered the manuscript room at the Imperial Library and met orientalists and Judaeo-Arabic scholars, such as Salomon Munk, Joseph Derenbourg, and Ernest Renan. It was at Paris that Neubauer found as his life's vocation the study, description, and publication of medieval Jewish manuscripts. In 1861&#150;2 he began his scholarly career by publishing in the <span class="italic">Journal Asiatique</span> (vols. 18&#150;20) extracts and translations from a tenth-century lexical work of David ben Abraham, of Fez, whose manuscripts he had found in a Karaite synagogue in Jerusalem. In 1866, after a visit to St Petersburg, he published <span class="italic">Aus der Petersburger Bibliothek</span>, which consisted of excerpts from related manuscripts held in the library there.<br>
<br>Neubauer pursued his interests in Palestine, and in 1863 he won the prize offered by the Acad&eacute;mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres for a critical exposition of the geography of Palestine, as set forth in the two <span class="roman">Talmuds</span> and other post-biblical Jewish writings. His first important work, <span class="italic">La g&eacute;ographie du Talmud: m&eacute;moire couronn&eacute; par l'acad&eacute;mie</span>, appeared in 1868, and placed its author in the first rank of rabbinical scholars, despite its occasional errors.<br>
<br>Neubauer had visited Oxford in 1866 in order to examine the collection of Hebrew manuscripts held in the Bodleian Library. Although the printed Hebrew books held in the library had been catalogued shortly beforehand (between 1852 and 1860) by Moritz Steinschneider, the manuscript collection was still untouched. In 1868 the curators invited Neubauer to catalogue the Hebrew manuscripts, and Oxford became his home until 1901. The catalogue which eventually appeared in 1886 contained descriptions of 2602 manuscripts (many consisting of between twenty and fifty distinct works). It was accompanied by an atlas of forty facsimile plates, illustrating the Hebrew palaeography of different countries and periods.<br>
<br>Despite his involvement with Hebrew manuscripts, Neubauer still found time for other literary work. He was appointed sub-librarian of the Bodleian Library in 1873, and he greatly expanded foreign collections and added especially to the oriental department of the library's holdings. Neubauer was in 1890 the first to recognize the value for Jewish literature of the genizah or depository attached to a synagogue, in which manuscripts no longer in use were put away. He eventually obtained for the Bodleian as many as 2675 items from the genizah at Old Cairo. These consisted frequently of several leaves, and many were of considerable interest and historical value. Neubauer began to catalogue these fragments, with very detailed descriptions, publishing a preliminary volume in 1886, but the work was completed and published by his successor, A. E. Cowley, in 1906.<br>
<br>During 1875 Neubauer also edited from a Bodleian and a Rouen manuscript the Arabic text of the eleventh-century Hebrew dictionary (the &#145;Book of Hebrew roots&#146;) of Abu-'l-Walid; this was a work of extreme importance in the history of Hebrew lexicography (which had been known before only through excerpts and quotations). Edward Pusey encouraged Neubauer to publish in 1876 a catena of more than fifty Jewish expositions of <span class="roman">Isaiah</span> 53, which was followed in 1877 by a volume of translations. In the same year there appeared, in the twenty-seventh volume of <span class="italic">L'histoire litt&eacute;raire de la France</span>, a long section entitled &#145;Les rabbins fran&ccedil;ais du commencement du XIVe si&egrave;cle&#146;, which (though its literary form was due to Renan) was based throughout upon materials collected by Neubauer. A continuation of this work, &#145;Les &eacute;crivains Juifs fran&ccedil;ais du XIVe si&egrave;cle&#146; (in volume 31 of <span class="italic">L'histoire litt&eacute;raire</span>, 351&#150;802), based similarly on materials supplied by Neubauer, appeared in 1893. These two volumes on the French rabbis remained the most important result of Neubauer's industry and learning. They include information drawn not only from Hebrew and German journals, but also from unpublished manuscripts in the libraries of Oxford, Paris, the south of France, Spain, Italy, and other countries.<br>
<br>In 1884 Neubauer was appointed reader in rabbinic Hebrew at the University of Oxford. In 1887 he published a Hebrew volume of medieval Jewish chronicles and chronological notes (a second volume appeared in 1895). He also issued, in 1878, a previously unknown Aramaic text of the book of <span class="roman">Tobit</span>, from a manuscript acquired in Constantinople for the Bodleian Library; and in 1897 he edited the original Hebrew of ten chapters of <span class="roman">Ecclesiasticus</span> from some manuscript leaves which had been discovered in a box of fragments from the Cairo genizah. A frequent contributor to learned periodicals, Neubauer wrote four articles entitled &#145;Where are the ten tribes?&#146; for the <span class="italic">Jewish Quarterly Review</span> (1888&#150;9), and contributed essays to the Oxford <span class="italic">Studia Biblica</span> in 1885, 1890, and 1891.<br>
<br>In 1890 Neubauer's eyesight began to fail him. He resigned from the library in 1899 and from the university in 1900. He continued to live in Oxford until 1901, when he moved to live with his nephew, Dr Adolf B&uuml;chler in Vienna. B&uuml;chler, who was also a rabbinical scholar, returned to England in 1906, when he was appointed vice-president of Jews' College, London. Neubauer died (unmarried) in the following year, on 6 April 1907, while living in London with B&uuml;chler at 18 Tavistock Square.<br>
<br>Neubauer's careful scholarship and integration into Oxford University life, helped perhaps by his failure to observe Jewish practices, ensured that he was accepted in English society. He was created MA of Oxford by diploma in 1873, and he was elected an honorary fellow of Exeter College in 1890. He received an honorary PhD from the University of Heidelberg, was made an honorary member of the Real Academia de la Historia at Madrid, and became a corresponding member of the Acad&eacute;mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in Paris.<br>
