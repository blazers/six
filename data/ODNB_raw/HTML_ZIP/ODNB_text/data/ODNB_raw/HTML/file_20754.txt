<span class="headword">O'Malley,  Thaddeus</span>  (1796&#150;1877), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and political writer</span>, was born at Garryowen, near Limerick. At the age of twenty-three he completed his training for the Roman Catholic priesthood and obtained a post in America. In 1827 he was suspended by his ecclesiastical superior, the Rt Revd John England, bishop of Charleston, for difficulties caused by his independence of spirit. On his return to Ireland, he was attached to the cathedral in Marlborough Street, Dublin, where he officiated as an assistant priest under Archbishop Daniel Murray.<br>
<br>After the death of the bishop of Kildare and Leighlin, James Warren Doyle (1786&#150;1834), who had been a powerful advocate for the Irish poor, O'Malley took up the demand for a poor law for Ireland in a series of public letters. He also supported a system of national education, but was suspended by Archbishop Murray for sending an intemperate and caustic letter to Archbishop MacHale in defence of Murray's own views on national schools; he was restored to his position as priest after a short time. He then published a further tract in favour of state education entitled <span class="italic">A Sketch of the State of Popular Education in Holland, Prussia, Belgium, and France</span> (1840).<br>
<br>O'Malley was appointed rector of the Catholic University of Malta by the British government, but was rebuked for introducing reforms to student discipline there. When he asserted that protestant laymen did not have the right to interfere in a Catholic ecclesiastical institution, he was dismissed from his post. He returned to Dublin, where in 1845 he started a newspaper called the <span class="italic">Social Economist</span>, which soon fell into disfavour with the Catholic church because of some articles which challenged the enforced celibacy of clerics and advocated marriage for the priesthood. It was a lively and irreverent periodical, one column being headed &#145;Sips of Punch&#146;. Differing with Daniel O'Connell on the question of the complete repeal of the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span>, he urged the establishment of a federal parliament for Ireland. The differences of opinion between the two men were publicly debated, and many came over to O'Malley's point of view, which was further publicized in the new newspaper which he set up, <span class="italic">The Federalist</span>. He then turned his attention to an attempt to unite Old and Young Ireland. Old Ireland as represented by O'Connell advocated public pressure, whereas Young Ireland supported armed conflict as the means to liberate Ireland. From about 1850 to 1870, O'Malley retired from controversy, and lived privately in a back lane of Dublin.<br>
<br>O'Malley returned to public debate in 1870 with the inauguration by Isaac Butt of the home-rule movement, which he supported with enthusiasm, speaking and writing in its defence. He also published the anonymous <span class="italic">Harmony in Religion</span>, which urged changes in ecclesiastical discipline within the Catholic church and alleged that there was a breach between the head of the Catholic church in England, Cardinal H. E. Manning, and its head in Ireland, Cardinal Paul Cullen. For this O'Malley was strongly rebuked by Cullen. His last publication, <span class="italic">Home Rule on the Basis of Federalism</span> (1873), went into a second edition, and was inscribed &#145;To the Irish Conservative Party&#146;.<br>
<br>O'Malley was a controversial figure whose taste for polemic made him an exasperating priest to his ecclesiastical superiors, and whose consistent urging for change within the discipline of the priesthood was out of step with prevailing Catholic emphases. But he was also capable of rousing popular opinion to his side, and was entirely orthodox in matters of Catholic doctrine. He died at his lodgings at 1 Henrietta Street, Dublin, on 2 January 1877, leaving possessions worth less than &pound;50, and was buried in Glasnevin cemetery.<br>
