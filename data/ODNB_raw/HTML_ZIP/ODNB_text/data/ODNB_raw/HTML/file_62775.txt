<span class="headword">Addinsell,  Richard Stewart</span>  (1904&#150;1977), <span class="occ">composer and pianist</span>, was born at 31 Woburn Square, London, on 13 January 1904, the younger of the two sons of William Arthur Addinsell, chartered accountant, and his wife, Annie Beatrice Richards. His adoring mother arranged for him to be educated at home, and this seemingly made him allergic to institutions thereafter. He went to Hertford College, Oxford, in 1922 to study law, but was there for only eighteen months and failed to take a degree. His thoughts were by now on music, and he enrolled at the Royal College of Music in 1925, but lasted there only two terms. In 1926 he made his West End d&eacute;but as a composer with his songs for <span class="italic">Charlot's Revue</span>, which were followed by contributions to a further Charlot revue, <span class="italic">Jumbles</span>, in 1927. The following year saw the start of a collaboration with Clemence Dane on <span class="italic">Adam's Opera</span> for the Old Vic, and in 1929 he began a journey around Europe, visiting Berlin, Vienna, and other major theatrical and musical centres.<br>
<br>The 1930s brought songs for further West End plays. These included dramatizations of J. B. Priestley's <span class="italic">The Good Companions</span> (1931) and Lewis Carroll's <span class="italic">Alice in Wonderland</span> (1932), as well as various works by Clemence Dane&#151;<span class="italic">Come of Age</span> (1933), <span class="italic">Moonlight is Silver</span> (1934), <span class="italic">L'Aiglon</span> (also 1934), and <span class="italic">The Happy Hypocrite</span> (1936)&#151;and Shakespeare's <span class="italic">The Taming of the Shrew</span> (1937). He later collaborated with Dane on her religious play cycle for radio, <span class="italic">The Saviours</span>, and in 1943 on a new version of <span class="italic">Alice in Wonderland</span>, incorporating <span class="italic">Through the Looking Glass</span>. Addinsell wrote music for many other BBC productions, as well as for Emlyn Williams's plays <span class="italic">The Light of Heart</span> (1940) and <span class="italic">Trespass</span> (1947) and also for Christopher Fry's theatre adaptation of <span class="italic">Ring Around the Moon</span> (1950).<br>
<br>By then, however, Addinsell was associated more particularly with films. In 1933 he had visited Hollywood for an aborted project involving the Czech-born actor Francis Lederer, but in 1936 his association with Dane and Douglas Fairbanks junior (co-star of <span class="italic">Moonlight is Silver</span>) led to him composing music for the film <span class="italic">The Amateur Gentleman</span>. There followed a long succession of film scores, notably for <span class="italic">Fire over England</span> (1937), <span class="italic">The Lion has Wings</span> and <span class="italic">Goodbye Mr Chips</span> (both 1939), and <span class="italic">Dangerous Moonlight</span> and <span class="italic">Gaslight</span> (both 1940). The pseudo-Rakhmaninov &#145;Warsaw&#146; concerto in <span class="italic">Dangerous Moonlight</span>, played on screen by Anton Wallbrook and on the soundtrack by Louis Kentner, enjoyed a sensational international success. This had been produced in conjunction with Addinsell's arranger and orchestrator from 1937 to 1942, Roy Douglas, Addinsell's method of working being to compose at the piano and hand the result to his assistant. Besides Douglas, other collaborators included Leonard Isaacs (between 1936 and 1948) and Douglas Gamley (from 1957 to 1965).<br>
<br>Addinsell proved one of the most inventive of all British composers of the period. His further film scores included <span class="italic">Love on the Dole</span> (1941), <span class="italic">The Day will Dawn</span> (1942), <span class="italic">Blithe Spirit</span> (1945), <span class="italic">Diary for Timothy</span> (1946), <span class="italic">The Passionate Friends</span> (1948), <span class="italic">Scrooge</span> (1951), <span class="italic">Tom Brown's Schooldays</span> (1951), <span class="italic">Sea Devils</span> (1953), <span class="italic">Beau Brummel</span> (1954), <span class="italic">The Prince and the Showgirl</span> (1957), <span class="italic">The Admirable Crichton</span> (1957), <span class="italic">A Tale of Two Cities</span> (1958), <span class="italic">The Roman Spring of Mrs Stone</span> (1961), <span class="italic">The Greengage Summer</span> (1961; released in America as <span class="italic">Loss of Innocence</span>), <span class="italic">Waltz of the Toreadors</span> (1962), and finally <span class="italic">Life at the Top</span> (1965).<br>
<br>Addinsell also composed concert works, which included a miniature piano concerto, <span class="italic">The Smokey Mountains</span> (1950). In addition he worked for many years as accompanist and composer for the actress Joyce Grenfell, whom he met in 1942. His post-war theatre work included music for revues such as <span class="italic">The Lyric Revue</span> (1951), <span class="italic">Penny Plain</span> (1951), <span class="italic">Airs on a Shoestring</span> (1953), and various one-woman shows given by Joyce Grenfell until 1965, when failing health prevented him from playing the piano and led to his retirement from film composition. Addinsell was a quiet and introverted man, but one who could be generous to his close circle and who came alive at the piano. In retirement at his home at 1 Carlyle Mansions, Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, he helped his partner, Victor Stiebel (<i>b</i>. 1907), the couturier, through the ravages of muscular sclerosis. Stiebel died in 1976, and Addinsell himself died from bronchopneumonia and osteoporosis at 1 Carlyle Mansions on 14 November 1977.<br>
