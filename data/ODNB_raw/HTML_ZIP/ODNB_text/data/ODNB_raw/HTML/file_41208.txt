<span class="headword">Lowther, Sir  Gerard Augustus</span>, baronet  (1858&#150;1916), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born at Ampthill Park, Bedfordshire, on 16 February 1858, the second son of William Lowther (1821&#150;1912), diplomatist and politician, and his wife, Charlotte Alice (<i>d</i>. 1908), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21283/', "Sir James Parke")</script> (later Lord Wensleydale), judge. The Lowther family had long been powerful landowners in the north-west. His father, who was brother of the third earl of Lonsdale, had served at Berlin, among other diplomatic postings; Conservative MP for Westmorland and for Appleby from 1868 to 1892, he had built an impressive house in Kensington (Lowther Lodge). His elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34615/', "James William Lowther, first Viscount Ullswater")</script>, speaker of the House of Commons from 1905 until 1921. A younger brother, (Henry) Cecil, was a general in the Scots Guards and had been a military attach&eacute; earlier in his career.<br>
<br>Lowther was educated at Harrow School and entered the diplomatic service in 1879. He first went to Madrid, where he was promoted from attach&eacute; to third secretary in 1881 and transferred to Paris. Three years after this he was sent as second secretary to Constantinople, for the greater part of his time there serving under Sir William White. It fell to Lowther's lot to be superintendent of the Levant service student interpreters installed at the small school at Ortak&ouml;y on the lower Bosphorus. It was here that he first encountered&#151;and was impressed by&#151;Gerald Fitzmaurice. This made the young Irishman an exception, for Lowther, who was powerfully built and had the habits of a country gentleman as well as the self-confidence of his class, was in general dismayed by the &#145;extreme nervousness&#146; and poor physique of the middle-class boys who had gained entry to the Levant service through the new system of open competition  (Berridge, <span class="italic">Fitzmaurice</span>, 10).<br>
<br>At the beginning of 1891 Lowther was transferred to Vienna from where in quick succession he was temporarily sent to take charge for short periods at Bucharest and Sofia. In October 1894, however, he was promoted to be secretary of legation at Tokyo, arriving at an eventful period, for the Sino-Japanese War had just broken out; moreover, in the following May he found himself in charge of the mission, for his minister, Le Poer Trench, had fallen ill. With no previous experience of the Far East and British relations with Japan cool (the legation was under police surveillance), Lowther was out of his depth: &#145;he never understood or appreciated the people&#146;, wrote Valentine Chirol privately some years later  (Chirol to Lloyd, <i>c</i>.Aug. 1908, CAC Cam., GLLD 7/3). Fortunately, Ernest Satow arrived as the new minister at the end of July 1895. Lowther remained in Japan for four years, in 1897 once more serving as charg&eacute; d'affaires.<br>
<br>In October 1898 Lowther was appointed consul-general at Budapest but in less than a year commenced an interlude in the Americas. First he was sent as secretary of embassy to Washington, serving there for five months as charg&eacute; d'affaires in 1901, and being something of a success on the social scene, especially at Newport, Rhode Island, where the embassy withdrew during the summer; then in August he was appointed minister to Chile, where he remained until the end of 1904. He was made CB in that year. On 28 February 1905 his American period was fittingly capped when he married, at All Saints', Knightsbridge, Alice (<i>d</i>. 1939), daughter of the Philadelphia lawyer Atherton Blight, who had a residence at Newport and a taste for life at Cannes. In 1906 a strong rumour surfaced in the United States that Lowther was to be the new ambassador in Washington, where, according to a newspaper report, he had earlier made many friends. The speculation proved unfounded.<br>
<br>Following his marriage Lowther departed for Morocco, where he was appointed consul-general as well as minister. After arriving in Tangier in the middle of April 1905 he found himself&#151;as in Tokyo a decade earlier&#151;in a crisis that had just broken out. In fact he arrived just two weeks after the surprise visit by the kaiser designed to challenge the British-supported ambitions of France in Morocco. Lowther's good work at Tangier, including his contribution to following up the Algeciras conference in early 1906, was rewarded by his creation as KCMG in June 1907.<br>
<br>It seems to have occurred to no one in the British embassy in Constantinople that the successor to their chief, Sir Nicholas O'Conor, who died in March 1908, might be Sir Gerard Lowther, and Gerald Fitzmaurice, by now the influential chief dragoman, lobbied hard for Maurice de Bunsen. Nevertheless, Lowther had plenty of &#145;Oriental&#146; experience, and was believed to have shown the ability and high standards of conduct of his family; he was a safe pair of hands. When, therefore, at the instigation of the powerful permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office, Sir Charles Hardinge, Lowther's name was announced, Fitzmaurice was content. It is true that he recalled him as stout, placid, and rather indolent, and wondered in a letter to George Lloyd whether the Foreign Office would &#145;put enough pitch under his tail to keep him going for a decade in this capital&#146;  (3 June 1908, CAC Cam., GLLD 7/3). Nevertheless, he thought that he was a straightforward, level-headed, no-nonsense sort of person, and thus a vast improvement on O'Conor. He felt he would get on well with him, and he did.<br>
<br>As the new representative of the leading &#145;liberal&#146; nation in Europe, Lowther, now also sworn of the privy council, received a rapturous popular welcome when he arrived in Constantinople at the end of July 1908. This was because he arrived shortly after the Young Turks' revolution&#151;in the name of constitutionalism and equal rights for all groups within the Ottoman empire&#151;had effectively overthrown the autocratic regime of the sultan and caliph, Abdul Hamid II. Inevitably, however, it was not long before this honeymoon came to an end. Encouraged by Fitzmaurice, and exhibiting the usual prejudices of his class, Lowther became suspicious of the influential Jewish presence among the Young Turks, and of their predilection for manipulating the new constitutional regime from behind the scenes by secret methods learned in the long years of opposition to Abdul Hamid, including meetings in Masonic lodges. Indeed Lowther soon concluded that one autocracy had simply been replaced by another, and without the saving graces of the former, notably respect for native traditions. In short, the brash Young Turks had not only thrown out the Old Turks' baby with the Hamidian bathwater, but replaced the latter with their own. Accordingly, Lowther believed, it was prudent to avoid over-committing to them.<br>
<br>In April 1909 Lowther gave discreet support to a counter-revolution against the Young Turk-supported regime. His support for the counter-revolution was not obvious to the outside world, but was within Turkey. When the counter-revolution failed, the Germans were able slowly to rebuild at the expense of the British the position they had lost in 1908, and in London his judgement was called into question. In consequence he had to endure some barbed and patronizing advice from Hardinge, who, like the foreign secretary, Sir Edward Grey, was under pressure from parliament to be more sympathetic to the Young Turks, and was now regretting the support he had given Lowther's appointment. Hardinge's advice included the suggestion that the ambassador might need additional secret service money to find out what was actually going on.<br>
<br>In the merry-go-round of Turkish politics over the following years, Lowther was never able to shake off the view that he was too much identified with the opposition to the Young Turks. As far as the Foreign Office was concerned, therefore, his fate was effectively sealed when the ruthless and charismatic Young Turk leader Enver Bey overthrew the government of the Anglophile Kiamil Pasha in the coup of January 1913, and thereafter consolidated the regime that took Turkey into the First World War in November 1914 on the side of Germany. He also suffered increasingly from ill health. In April 1913, therefore, Grey decided that he would have to be recalled. In early July he left Constantinople, and on 1 September he retired from the diplomatic service.<br>
<br>In the Foreign Office Lowther was seen as a failure in his last post but this judgement was a shade too harsh: he was to some extent another ambassadorial scapegoat. The political situation in Turkey was almost always fluid and extremely difficult to predict, while British policy on Ottoman questions and the new entente with Russia, Turkey's traditional enemy, did not give him an easy hand to play; neither did the military magnet exerted on the Young Turks by Germany. In the circumstances Lowther was an adequate helmsman in Constantinople, colliding with the odd rock in white water but never fatally; and generally steering a safe course in spite of the vacillating directions he sometimes received from home. He was also loyal to his staff, not least his <i>alter ego</i>, Fitzmaurice.<br>
<br>Lowther had been promoted GCMG in 1911, and was made a baronet in January 1914. He died of cerebral thrombosis and cerebral degeneration on 5 April 1916 at Whitehall, Sandwich Bay, Worth, Kent, and was buried at Campsea Ashe, Suffolk. His wife and their two daughters survived him.<br>
