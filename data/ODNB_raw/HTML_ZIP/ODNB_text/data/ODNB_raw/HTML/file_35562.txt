<span class="headword">Pollock,  Ernest Murray</span>, first Viscount Hanworth  (1861&#150;1936), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 25 November 1861 at Wimbledon, Surrey, the fifth, but fourth surviving, son of George Frederick Pollock (1821&#150;1915), queen's remembrancer, and his wife, Frances Diana (<i>d</i>. 1891), daughter of Henry Herbert, rector of Rathdowney, Queen's county. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35561/', "Bertram Pollock")</script>, later bishop of Norwich, was his youngest brother. Pollock was grandson of Sir Jonathan Frederick Pollock, lord chief baron of the exchequer, great-nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22477/', "Sir David Pollock")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22478/', "Sir George Pollock")</script>, nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22480/', "Sir William Frederick Pollock")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22476/', "Sir Charles Edward Pollock")</script>, and first cousin of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35563/', "Sir Frederick Pollock")</script>. He was a scholar of Charterhouse School and in 1880 passed from there to Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1883 having been placed in the third class of part one of the classical tripos. In 1885 he was called to the bar by the Inner Temple, of which he became a bencher in 1914 and treasurer in 1936.<br>
<br>On 12 April 1887 Pollock married Laura Helen (<i>d</i>. 1954), eldest daughter of Sir Thomas Salt, first baronet, a Staffordshire banker; they had a son and a daughter. He met his future wife at Stafford in 1884, when he was marshal to Mr Justice Manisty. The other judge, Baron Huddleston, insisted on the lodgings being kept at a very high temperature, and the result was a fire. Salt entertained both judges and marshals at Weeping Cross, his home nearby.<br>
<br>Pollock had a fairly good practice as a junior, and took silk in 1905. At the general election of January 1910, after two unsuccessful efforts (1900 and 1906) at Spalding, he was elected Conservative member of parliament for Warwick and Leamington and held the seat until 1923. He was appointed KBE in 1917. On 15 January 1919 he was appointed solicitor-general, and on 8 March 1922 attorney-general, resigning that office when the coalition government broke up in October. He had been sworn of the privy council in February, an unusual honour for a law officer.<br>
<br>As an advocate Pollock never attained the front rank. Indeed, he was deemed fortunate in being nominated law officer, there being a dearth of eminent advocates among politicians of the Conservative Party when he was appointed. Nor can it be said that as law officer he rose to the occasion so far as practice in the courts was concerned. Yet both his circumstances and his qualities were calculated to produce an advocate of the first class. He was born to one of the best-known legal names of the period, and inherited the Pollock face, which his great-grandmother Sarah Homeria Parsons, the wife of the saddler from Berwick, transmitted to so many of her descendants. Moreover, he had a fine presence, infinite zest, an excellent memory, and a quick, although not a deep, intelligence. He always sought to help others. He was never at a loss for a word, had plenty of confidence, and a resounding if somewhat strident voice. Finally, he was scrupulously honest, a quality which was more valuable to the advocate than was generally understood, at any rate outside the profession. Yet in the conduct of difficult and complicated cases such as fall to the lot of law officers he was often obviously outclassed by the counsel who opposed him. Particularly in the <i>Armstrong case</i> (1922), an action in which the accused was charged with poisoning his wife, his handling of the prosecution was much criticized. He appeared to prefer intuition to close reasoning in his arguments, a course which did not assist the court.<br>
<br>When the revolt of the Conservative Party occurred in 1922, and the coalition was wrecked at the famous meeting of that party at the Carlton Club (19 October), Pollock stood by the coalition and went into exile. He was a man of complete integrity and loyalty, of simple but honourable conduct. Even the offer of the woolsack did not tempt him. When he formed his government the new Conservative prime minister, Bonar Law, through Lord Cave offered Pollock the option of continuing as attorney-general. Having formed and expressed a definite opinion against the break-up of the coalition, Pollock preferred to stand aside on the ground that it was contrary to the public interest, and that it was inconsistent with constitutional propriety for him to accept office in the new government, though it was a pang to depart. Accordingly, Pollock returned to the bar, and to many it seemed that his career was at an end. He was neither essential to the government, nor a danger to it if left out. For he was too serious and loyal a Conservative to be a nuisance to his party. He reluctantly accepted a baronetcy in November 1922.<br>
<br>A year later (1923) Pollock was offered by Baldwin the post of master of the rolls, the third highest post in the legal hierarchy. The appointment was unexpected and was much criticized both in the press and at the bar. Indeed, he was not legally or intellectually of the same calibre as the eminent holders of that office during the previous twenty years. Nevertheless, in the ordinary run of appellate work in the Court of Appeal over which he presided, he was effective and justified his appointment. He was a good president and courteous to the bar. His wide knowledge of the world enabled him to pick up the facts of a case quickly. If his judgments were sometimes rather long, they were clear and decisive, though Lord Buckmaster had a poor opinion of him as a judge (<i>Jonesco v. Beard</i>, [1930] AC 298).<br>
<br>Perhaps Pollock's greatest service to his generation and to posterity lay in the industry and enthusiasm which he brought to the execution of his duty as custodian of records, especially manorial records. The <span class="roman">Law of Property Amendment Act</span> (1924) by its second schedule added to section 144 of the <span class="roman">Law of Property Act</span> (1922) a new section (144 A) conferring on him powers which in other hands might have been left unused. Here was a field in which Pollock's conservative outlook and veneration for the past found a welcome and useful outlet. He used these powers to the full, and inspired others to join in a movement to save, before it was too late, the contemporary records of manors which lay rotting in the offices of country solicitors, in manor houses, or on the rubbish heap. He was always willing to spend his leisure in addressing meetings far and wide as to the mine of contemporary medieval documents which this country was so fortunate as to possess. Scholars and historians owe much to his unflagging efforts in this direction. Nor was the awakening of interest and pride confined to purely manorial records, and this country can no longer be reproached for being the repository of medieval documentary evidence unique in quality and quantity, but cared for by none and explored mainly by the scholars of foreign countries.<br>
<br>In January 1926 Pollock was raised to the peerage as Baron Hanworth, taking his title from the village in Middlesex where his grandfather, the lord chief baron, had bought an estate in 1834. In 1935 he resigned as master of the rolls owing to increasing ill health, and in January 1936, at the request of Lord Chancellor Sankey, was advanced to a viscountcy as a reward for services, notably on law reform committees, and as gratitude for favours to come. He died at his home, 2 Marine Parade, Hythe, Kent, on 22 October 1936 and was buried at Saltwood, Kent, two days later.<br>
<br>In 1929 Hanworth published a life of his grandfather, <span class="italic">Lord Chief Baron Pollock</span>, which supplies a key to his character. A tenacious memory, coupled with an exceptional gift of mimicry, made him an ideal raconteur and endeared him to his fellow benchers of the Inner Temple. He was a keen sportsman, fond of shooting and fishing, and of the country generally. He was a good and religious man, whose simple piety was not obscured by a slight tendency to pomposity. Indeed, Lord Hewart, an acute critic of his fellow men, described him as the model of a Christian gentleman. Hanworth's son was killed in action in France in March 1918, and he was succeeded as second viscount by his grandson David Bertram Pollock (1916&#150;1996).<br>
