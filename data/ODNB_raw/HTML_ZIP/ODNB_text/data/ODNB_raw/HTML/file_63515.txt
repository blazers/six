<span class="headword">Johnstone,  John</span>  (1734&#150;1795), <span class="occ">East India Company servant</span>, was born at Haddock's Hole, Edinburgh, on 28 April 1734, the fifth son of Sir James Johnstone, third baronet (1697&#150;1772), of Westerhall, Dumfriesshire, and his wife, Barbara (<i>d</i>. 1773), daughter of Alexander Murray, fourth Lord Elibank. Johnstone received tuition in Edinburgh before being appointed a writer in the service of the East India Company in December 1750. He arrived in Bengal on 9 July 1751, and in 1754 was stationed as an assistant at the company's factory at Dacca, where he was taken prisoner in 1756 subsequent to the outbreak of hostilities between the nawab of Bengal, Siraj ud-Daula, and the company. Following his release Johnstone, whose brother Patrick died in the Black Hole, volunteered to assist in the recovery of Calcutta and served with the artillery at the battle of Plassey in June 1757. He was a member of the detachment sent by Robert Clive in pursuit of Jean Law, and following a brief return to civil employment participated in the expedition against the French in the Northern Circars which culminated in the capture of Masulipatam in April 1759.<br>
<br>On his return to Bengal, Johnstone was again stationed at Dacca but shortly afterwards was appointed to take charge, apparently on account of his linguistic abilities, of the company's affairs at Midnapore, a district newly ceded to the company. He was also now a member of the Bengal council. Johnstone was faced with collecting revenues in a hostile environment, but was successful, and in 1762 was transferred to Burdwan, another recently ceded district. These appointments gave Johnstone opportunities for participating in private trading ventures, particularly in salt, and he formed a partnership with two other company servants, William Hay and William Bolts. The partnership also became involved in revenue farming. These activities attracted accusations of malpractice and fraud, and Johnstone came into conflict with the governor of Bengal, Henry Vansittart, a trading rival who attempted to reach an agreement concerning private trade with the nawab Mir Kasim. It is likely that Johnstone received other financial gains in the form of presents from the raja of Burdwan. When news of his disagreement with Vansittart reached England in early 1764, Johnstone was dismissed from the company's service. In May he was, however, reinstated, a measure that was not supported by the followers of Clive, despite the encouragement that they had received from the Johnstone party in the company election a few weeks previously. The resulting breach between the Clive and Johnstone groups was the start of a feud that lasted for the rest of the decade and beyond.<br>
<br>Upon the arrival in Bengal of the orders which reinstated him Johnstone returned to Burdwan. In February 1765 Mir Jafar, who had replaced Mir Kasim as nawab in 1763, died, and was succeeded by his adolescent son Najm ud-Daula, whom the council, now headed by John Spencer, supported. Johnstone was recalled from Burdwan and led a delegation of the council to Murshidabad for the installation of the new nawab. Following this presents were distributed; Johnstone received approximately &pound;36,000, the largest amount given to any of the individuals involved. His brother Gideon was in receipt of a smaller sum. Clive's arrival in Calcutta in May 1765 to take up the governorship of Bengal heralded the beginning of a programme of reform. Johnstone soon clashed with Clive, who began an inquiry into the presents which had been received by him and his colleagues despite their having received orders from the directors of the company to abstain from such activities. On 17 June 1765 a minute from Johnstone was considered by the council; this criticized Clive's style of government and stated his intention to resign from the service.<br>
<br>Johnstone left India with a fortune that has been put at &pound;300,000. This was employed in the purchase of estates in Scotland, at Alva in Stirlingshire, and later in Selkirkshire and Dumfriesshire. Faced with prosecution by the East India Company, he published in 1766 <span class="italic">A Letter to the Proprietors of East India Stock</span>, which defended his activities in Bengal. The Johnstone group, who were allied to Clive's enemy Laurence Sulivan, were able to obtain the withdrawal of the prosecution in May 1767. In the years that followed, Johnstone's interests were taken up by his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14960/', "George Johnstone")</script>, who was elected an MP in 1768. As the clamour for an investigation into the company's affairs in India grew, George Johnstone attempted to discredit Clive and was a member, along with his brother William Pulteney, of the parliamentary select committee of inquiry into the company which was appointed in 1772.<br>
<br>John Johnstone was elected MP for Dysart burghs in 1774 and supported the opposition to the North administration. In 1780 he lost his seat, and an attempt to be elected for Dumfriesshire in 1790 was unsuccessful. His wife, Elizabeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Keene), whom he had married on 1 September 1765 and with whom he had a son and a daughter, predeceased him. Johnstone died at Alva House, Alva, on 10 December 1795.<br>
