</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kennedy, Sir  James  Shaw</span>  (1788&#150;1865), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 13 October 1788 at The Largs, Straiton, Ayrshire, second of the six children of John Shaw (<i>d</i>. 1831), a former captain in the 76th highlanders who had served in the American War of Independence, from Dalton, Kirkcudbrightshire, and his wife, Wilhelmina Hannah Macadam, sister of John Loudon Macadam, the road engineer. James's paternal grandfather, John Shaw, sold the family estate, Dalton in Kirkcudbrightshire, before his son could inherit, and the younger John's family moved from Straiton into an old castle near Maybole, Ayrshire. James Shaw was educated at Maybole parish school and Ayr Academy.<br>
<br>On 18 April 1805 Shaw became an ensign in the 43rd foot (light infantry), which he joined at Hythe, Kent, and which was training under Sir John Moore. William Napier was then a captain in the regiment. Shaw became lieutenant on 23 January 1806 and served with the regiment during the 1807 expedition to Denmark in the battle of Kioge and siege of Copenhagen. In 1808 the 43rd sailed for northern Spain under Sir David Baird, advancing to support British troops at Sahagun, shortly before Sir John Moore began his long retreat to Corunna, pursued hotly by the French. Shaw fought with the rearguard, which covered the evacuation. Back in England he suffered from a severe fever whose effects never thereafter fully left him. None the less, he returned to the Peninsula in 1809, marching with the light division from Lisbon to Talavera, where he assumed responsibility as adjutant in the 43rd. During 1809 and 1810 Shaw was aide-de-camp to Brigadier-General Robert Craufurd and took part in several actions between the Coa and Agueda rivers, being severely wounded in the elbow at Almeida on 24 July 1810. Shaw's account of this phase of the Peninsular War, preserved in a journal, has been judged &#145;most ample and reliable&#146;  (Craufurd, 89). During the storming of Ciudad Rodrigo (19 January 1812) he was standing beside Craufurd on the crest of the glacis, when the general fell mortally wounded. He carried Craufurd from the field, and, subsequently, conveyed Wellington's summons to surrender to the French governor. On his return to regimental duty he served with the 43rd at the siege and storming of Badajoz (5&#150;6 April 1812) where he distinguished himself in assaulting a lesser breach, at the battle of Salamanca, and in the advance to Madrid. During Wellington's withdrawal from Madrid to winter quarters at Ciudad Rodrigo, Shaw acted as aide-de-camp to Major-General Charles von Alten, and was involved in various minor actions <i>en route</i>. In July 1812 he was promoted captain. At the close of 1812 Shaw was declared medically unfit, returned home, and suffered another bout of debilitating fever.<br>
<br>On 2 April 1813 Shaw joined the senior department of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, but in August ill health compelled him to leave. During the 1815 crisis he returned to active service as assistant quartermaster-general with the 3rd division of Lieutenant-General Sir Charles von Alten, at Quatre-Bras and Waterloo. As the only quartermaster-general's staff officer still in action with the division, on 17 June he reconnoitred its detached line of march, separate from the main force, during northwards withdrawal from Quatre-Bras across the Dyle River at Weys, &#145;a movement of great delicacy &hellip; in open day in presence of Napoleon's advance&#146;  (Levinge, 320). The following day (when retrospectively he would acquire a brevet majority) at Waterloo, where Alten's division had its left flank resting on the Charleroi&#150;Brussels road above La Haye-Sainte, Shaw &#145;was allowed, in the presence of the duke of Wellington, to form the division in an order of battle new and unusual, that of oblongs in exchequer, to meet the formidable masses of cavalry seen forming in its front&#146;  (Levinge, 320). The oblongs, mostly formed on the two centre companies of battalions, had their faces and flanks four ranks deep; but to preserve the closest affinity to line formation each flank had only the width of a subdivision. Thus drawn up, the division withstood furious enemy cavalry assaults in late afternoon. Struck in the side and disabled for some time, Shaw had one horse killed and another wounded under him during the battle.<br>
<br>For three years (1815&#150;18), Shaw was commandant and military agent as assistant quartermaster-general at Calais with the army of occupation. He had many difficulties with the French garrison, and received the thanks of the tsar, with a diamond ring, for his services in embarking 8000 Russians during October 1818. Having been placed on half pay in the regiment on 25 March 1817, he obtained a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy (21 January 1819) following Wellington's recommendation. In 1820, at Ayr, Shaw married Sir John Whiteford's granddaughter, Mary Primrose Kennedy (<i>d</i>. 1877) of Kirkmichael, an estate close to Maybole. When he succeeded to the estate through his wife, in 1834, Shaw added Kennedy to his surname.<br>
<br>In 1826, after nine years on half pay, Shaw had become assistant adjutant-general in Belfast; later that year he transferred to Manchester, where he remained for nine years during outbreaks of civil disorder, mainly caused by dissatisfaction with working conditions. On leaving the city he was presented with a valuable service of plate by some of the inhabitants, and Sir Charles Napier dubbed his report on general principles for preserving order during periods of labour unrest &#145;a masterly affair&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Having declined Sir Robert Peel's offer of the position of first commissioner of the new Metropolitan Police in 1829, Shaw Kennedy accepted the post of inspector-general of the Irish constabulary in 1836. During his two-year tenure he raised and organized a force of 8000 men, devising his own successful system of drill and field exercise. He became a major on the unattached list on 16 July 1830, colonel (10 January 1837), major-general (9 November 1846), and lieutenant-general (20 June 1854). He was appointed colonel, 47th foot, on 27 August 1854, and promoted general on 19 August 1862. Shaw Kennedy became CB on 19 July 1838, and KCB in 1863. He also held the military general service medal (often called the Peninsular silver medal) with three clasps, and the Waterloo medal.<br>
<br>Summoned from St Leonards, on 10 April 1848 Shaw Kennedy was ordered to take charge of troops, under the control of the civil authorities, in Liverpool, where Chartist demonstrations were feared. Later that year he was appointed extra general officer on the Irish staff under Sir Edward Blakeney. Indifferent health caused him to decline that post and the governorship of Mauritius proposed the following year. In 1852 Shaw Kennedy did accept command of the forces of north Britain, but persistent poor health led him quickly to resign and move to Bath. That year Sir William Napier&#151;his close friend whom he considered the greatest genius he had ever personally known&#151;referred to Shaw Kennedy's &#145;great intelligence, great zeal, and undaunted courage on very many occasions &hellip; He is, perhaps, with the exception of Lord Seaton, the very ablest officer in the service&#146;  (Craufurd, 8). But his weak constitution prevented any serious suggestion that he succeed Wellington as commander-in-chief or lead the Crimean expeditionary force.<br>
<br>Despite his medical problems Shaw Kennedy remained tall, spare, and erect throughout his life, abstemious in habit, at once reserved and distant in manner but also gentle, kind, and modest. Unlike Napier he eschewed politics and reputedly never voted in an election. With another aide-de-camp to Craufurd, William Campbell, he edited <span class="italic">Standing Orders for the Light Division</span>, while his Peninsular journal appeared in Lord Frederick Fitzclarence's <span class="italic">Manual of Outpost Duties</span> (1851); in 1859 he wrote <span class="italic">Notes on the Defence of Great Britain and Ireland</span>, in 1863 <span class="italic">Notes on Waterloo</span>, in 1860 a brief autobiography, and in 1862 <span class="italic">Plan for the Defence of Canada</span>; all were published in 1865.<br>
<br>Shaw Kennedy died of a long-standing liver complaint at 8 Royal Circus, Bath, on 30 May 1865, and was interred in a vault at Kirkmichael parish church, where his widow was also buried in 1877. Two daughters, Henrietta Shaw Kennedy and Wilhelmina Shaw, predeceased their father, but John Shaw Kennedy survived him to succeed as laird of Kirkmichael.<br>
