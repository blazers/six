<span class="headword">Everard,  Edmund</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1673&#150;1691), <span class="occ">informer</span>, is of obscure origins, but may have been of Irish descent. He was apparently employed as an agent to the French court, and was also employed for a time as an assistant secretary to the duke of Monmouth. A Catholic during his time in France, it was claimed that by 1678 he had become a protestant. He appears to have associated with a number of Irish exiles while in Paris, and in his printed version of events there he claimed that in 1673 he met the future Catholic plotter Edward Fitzharris. Everard was also to claim that he had uncovered a popish plot to remove Charles II from the throne in a manner that was very similar to the alleged plot of autumn 1678. When it was discovered that Everard had knowledge of this plot he maintained that he had been threatened with punishment unless he kept quiet. However, another version of the Paris sojourn was that Everard had himself actually threatened some persons there, especially Monmouth, for the non-payment of his arrears. In the event, on visiting London in December 1673 Everard was arrested for treasonable designs. He was incarcerated in the Tower and interrogated for a design to poison &#145;some great person&#146;, whom some thought to be the duke of Monmouth  (<span class="italic">Fourth Report</span>, HMC, 234). Everard was later to state that he had been threatened with the rack while in the Tower.<br>
<br>Everard was finally discharged from the Tower in January 1678. With the outbreak of the Popish Plot scare he naturally became a minor informer on the scene, claiming to be a precursor of Titus Oates and attacking Slingsby Bethell and later Sir Robert Walsh in print. Being an opportunist, Everard was frequently to change his stories, as well as sides, in the years that followed. He gave evidence before the Lords committee and was involved with Edmund Warcup JP, the notorious hunter of papists, as well as the many Irish witnesses who flooded into London. At length in February 1681 Everard once more became involved with Edward Fitzharris. The latter wrote a libellous pamphlet, <span class="italic">The True Englishman Speaking Plain English in a Letter from a Friend to a Friend</span>, advocating the deposition of Charles II and the exclusion of the duke of York. It seems that Fitzharris hoped to plant this pamphlet in the home of a prominent whig and then make a &#145;discovery&#146;. Fitzharris contacted Everard to forward this scheme and this was to lead to Fitzharris's death. Everard, whose loyalties were, at least temporarily, whiggish, drew Fitzharris into a trap, duping him into betraying the entire scheme before Sir William Waller, who promptly arrested him and sent him to Newgate on a charge of high treason. Everard gave evidence against Fitzharris at his trial and made an assortment of other unsubstantiated claims that netted him various sums from the secret service fund.<br>
<br>By 1682 Everard had joined the court faction, but still gave evidence against Warcup, who faced counter-accusations of conspiracy to suborn witnesses. He was also to claim that various nonconformist ministers had offered him a pension if he would retire to the Netherlands. In due course he did so, but for reasons of his own. In the Netherlands in the 1680s he worked as a merchant and spy for Sir Bevil Skelton and was used to spy on his former whig friends. Once they discovered this Everard's life was threatened, his goods were seized, and his debts called in. With the collapse of James II's government Everard seems to have changed sides once more, as by 1691 he was giving evidence against Jacobites and made various accusations in that year. Visiting their haunts in the Netherlands and Flanders he also took to uncovering military intelligence against the French army. He was placed in the Tower in 1691, but disappeared from view shortly afterwards. The date of his death is unknown.<br>
