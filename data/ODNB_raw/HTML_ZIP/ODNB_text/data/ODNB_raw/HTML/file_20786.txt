<span class="headword">O'Neill, Sir  Turlough  Luineach</span>  (<em>c.</em>1530&#150;1595), <span class="occ">chieftain</span>, was the son of Niall Connallach O'Neill (<i>d</i>. 1544), whose sobriquet reflects the fact that he was fostered among the ruling O'Donnells of Tyrconnell. His mother was, almost certainly, Rose O'Donnell, sister to Manus O'Donnell, lord of Tyrconnell between 1537 and 1555, and wife of Niall Connallach, though a late pedigree from Lord Justice Drury, a hostile source, claimed that Turlough Luineach was a &#145;bastard&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Origins"></a>Origins</h2>Turlough's grandfather, Art &Oacute;g O'Neill, held the title &Oacute; N&eacute;ill or lord of Tyrone, the greatest lordship in late medieval Ulster, between 1513 and 1519; Turlough Luineach would also rise to be &Oacute; N&eacute;ill between 1567 and 1595. Art &Oacute;g's power base had been on the fertile Lough Neagh basin around Dungannon in east Tyrone. However, to enhance his authority across the Sperrin Mountains, where the Sliocht Airt U&iacute; N&eacute;ill were dominant, he established his sons in Slewisse in north-western Tyrone. On his death Art &Oacute;g was succeeded by his half-brother, Conn Bacach O'Neill (1519&#150;1559), as &Oacute; N&eacute;ill. Yet one of Art &Oacute;g's sons, Niall Connallach O'Neill, father of Turlough Luineach, became Conn Bacach's <i>t&aacute;naiste</i> (nominated successor). Niall Connallach died in 1544 in unexplained circumstances.<br>
<br>Turlough Luineach O'Neill's cognomen has been taken as an indication that he was fostered by the Muintir Luinigh, though it seems more likely that it simply reflected his control of that district. Joseph Costello has proposed that Turlough Luineach was actually fostered by the Flemings, a gentry family of English descent on the northern borders of the pale.<h2>
<a name="Risetoprominence"></a>Rise to prominence</h2>Turlough Luineach's rise to provincial prominence is not well documented. After his father's death he secured possession of his demesne lands in Slewisse. He extended his authority to Strabane, where he built an important castle across the river from Lifford Castle, a major stronghold of O'Donnell, lord of the powerful lordship of Tyrconnell in north-west Ulster. He fostered the development of a small but important town at Strabane. This resource base was too slender, and too marginal geographically, for Turlough Luineach O'Neill to have any realistic prospect of emulating his grandfather Art &Oacute;g and becoming &Oacute; N&eacute;ill. Yet that is precisely the goal that he set himself from an early date.<br>
<br>Turlough Luineach built up a formidable power base in western Tyrone by developing the economy of his lordship and by forming alliances with the heads of collateral branches of the O'Neills in western Tyrone, most notably with Hugh mac Niall O'Neill, lord of Omagh and head of Sliocht Airt. He also formed an alliance with his uncle, Manus O'Donnell, lord of Tyrconnell, and in the late 1540s joined O'Donnell in attacking Conn Bacach O'Neill, who had become earl of Tyrone through a compact with Henry VIII in 1542. Turlough Luineach's pretensions might have been crushed quickly were it not for the ageing earl's faltering grasp on his lordship and the consequent contest for power that broke out between the earl and his own sons. Turlough Luineach took advantage of the internecine warfare among the ruling O'Neills to assert a claim to the office of <i>t&aacute;naiste</i>, but he did not have the strength to realize his ambition. In the event, Conn Bacach's youngest legitimate son, Shane (alias Se&aacute;n) O'Neill, succeeded in taking control of Tyrone from his father, despite the claims of the baron of Dungannon, the earl's nominated successor. Shane appointed Turlough Luineach as his <i>t&aacute;naiste</i> in recognition of his influence in western Tyrone.<br>
<br>While Shane O'Neill dominated Tyrone and most of Ulster from the mid-1550s, there was little scope for Turlough Luineach O'Neill to pursue his ambitions. On 12 April 1562, while Shane was engaged in delicate negotiations with Queen Elizabeth at the English court, Turlough Luineach killed Brian O'Neill, the young baron of Dungannon, whom the crown acknowledged as the heir to the earldom of Tyrone. Shane O'Neill claimed that Turlough Luineach acted rebelliously in killing the baron, though it was suspected that Shane had sanctioned the murder to clear the way for the crown to recognize his own claims to succeed his father as &Oacute; N&eacute;ill and as earl of Tyrone. Certainty on this matter is impossible, though Shane's claim may well have been correct: some weeks later, in May 1562, during Shane's continued absence in England, Turlough Luineach had himself proclaimed as &Oacute; N&eacute;ill at the traditional inauguration site at Tullyhogue. However, Turlough Luineach O'Neill failed to establish his authority among the leading families of eastern Tyrone, most particularly among the O'Donnellys, who held the hereditary office of marshal of &Oacute; N&eacute;ill's army and were completely loyal to Shane O'Neill, whom they had fostered in his childhood. Turlough Luineach briefly supported the English viceroy in Ireland, the earl of Sussex, against Shane but soon came to terms with &Oacute; N&eacute;ill.<br>
<br>Shane O'Neill's decision not to crush Turlough Luineach for his audacity may be seen as an indication that he did not perceive his cousin from north-west Tyrone as a serious rival for power. Over the subsequent years Shane O'Neill's fortunes were in the ascendant in Tyrone and across Ulster generally. Not until Shane's army suffered a catastrophic defeat at the hands of O'Donnell in the battle of Farsetmore on 8 May 1567 did Turlough Luineach dare to rebel again. The killing of Shane O'Neill by the Scots with whom he was negotiating at Cushendun in north Antrim on 2 June 1567 cleared the way for Turlough Luineach O'Neill to become &Oacute; N&eacute;ill.<h2>
<a name="MasterofTyrone"></a>Master of Tyrone</h2>Turlough Luineach's accession to the lordship was as much a result of the power vacuum left by the death of Shane O'Neill as of his own political strength and skills. Shane had eliminated his own brothers as contestants for the lordship, while his sons were still too young to take their father's place. None the less, Turlough Luineach needed time to consolidate his authority as &Oacute; N&eacute;ill. To that end he neutralized the alliance that had brought about the downfall of his predecessor. He contracted a new alliance with O'Donnell, lord of Tyrconnell. He made overtures to the Scots in north Antrim. He gave one of his daughters in marriage to Rory Oge MacQuillan to pacify that Irish lord in north Antrim. The English viceroy, Lord Deputy Sidney, underestimated the new &Oacute; N&eacute;ill and was readily reassured by Turlough Luineach's submission on 18 June 1567. Sidney departed from Dublin on 9 October 1567 and remained at the court of Elizabeth for almost a year to devise a new programme of reform for Ireland. Turlough Luineach O'Neill used that time very effectively to establish himself in the demesne lands pertaining to his new office around Dungannon, and to win the confidence of &Oacute; N&eacute;ill's household families (<i>lucht tighe</i>) in eastern Tyrone.<br>
<br>The new &Oacute; N&eacute;ill hoped to secure the English crown's recognition of his authority in Tyrone. However, Elizabeth's ministers envisaged the breakup of &Oacute; N&eacute;ill's overlordship. Inevitably, the negotiations between Lord Deputy Sidney and &Oacute; N&eacute;ill in September and October 1568 achieved very little. &Oacute; N&eacute;ill was obliged to acquiesce in Sidney's establishment of the teenaged Hugh O'Neill, baron of Dungannon and brother of the previous baron whom Turlough Luineach had murdered, in Oneilland, a lordship south of Lough Neagh. In effect, &Oacute; N&eacute;ill was forced to accept the Blackwater River as the southern boundary of his lordship. Yet &Oacute; N&eacute;ill was determined not to cede any more ground.<br>
<br>Turlough Luineach entered into negotiations with Scotland's clan Donald South, a junior branch of which had settled in north Antrim, to marry as his second wife <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69172/', "Lady Agnes Campbell (d. in or after 1590)")</script>, widow of James MacDonald, and by February 1569 had contracted to marry her in return for a dowry of more than 1000 Scottish mercenaries. The nuptials were celebrated in August 1569, and it was reported shortly afterwards that &Oacute; N&eacute;ill had 3000 Scottish mercenaries in his employ, in addition to thousands of local kerne and galloglass. This military establishment proved to be too large for &Oacute; N&eacute;ill to sustain indefinitely, but it succeeded in discouraging English military or colonial adventures west of the River Bann. On 20 January 1571 &Oacute; N&eacute;ill and Sidney agreed to a truce whereby the Irish lord was to dismiss his Scottish mercenaries in return for the opportunity to submit his proposals for a political settlement to Queen Elizabeth. However, &Oacute; N&eacute;ill's willingness to reach an accommodation with the English crown was not reciprocated.<br>
<br>The younger Sir Thomas Smith's pilot scheme for private colonization in east Ulster, which got under way on 30 August 1572, was stoutly resisted by Sir Brian mac Phelim &Oacute; N&eacute;ill, lord of Clandeboye, with support from &Oacute; N&eacute;ill. Smith's death in August 1573 effectively aborted that colonization scheme, but it was succeeded by another of grander scale and ambition devised by Walter Devereux, earl of Essex. &Oacute; N&eacute;ill again supported Sir Brian &Oacute;N&eacute;ill, and also worked with the MacDonalds in north Antrim to thwart the English colonists. Despite Essex's considerable investment in the project he ultimately failed ignominiously.<br>
<br>Following Essex's death Sidney was restored as lord deputy on 5 August 1575. He travelled to Ulster to restore some semblance of English order after the turmoil generated by the plantation projects. He met &Oacute; N&eacute;ill at Armagh, and the two men concluded a formal treaty in which the crown accepted Turlough Luineach's claims to overlordship to a limited degree, while the Irish lord agreed to dismiss his Scottish mercenaries, with the exception of a bodyguard composed of Campbells, his wife's clan. Sidney committed himself to securing &Oacute; N&eacute;ill a peerage from the crown. Subsequently, in May 1578, a patent was passed to make Turlough Luineach O'Neill earl of Clanoneill and baron of Clogher, albeit only for life, which Sidney reckoned would not be for long given &Oacute; N&eacute;ill's age, his bullet wound, his poor diet, and his constant over-indulgence in alcohol. However, with Sidney's retirement from office in September 1578 that initiative fell through. &Oacute; N&eacute;ill, for his part, was unable to observe his side of the agreement made with Sidney, for he was heavily dependent upon his Scottish mercenaries to maintain his authority across Tyrone and among his <i>uirrithe</i> (&#145;vassal-chiefs&#146;), the subordinate lords outside Tyrone. &Oacute; N&eacute;ill also employed his mercenaries to deter English incursions into Ulster, and to exert leverage on the crown to concede formal recognition of his overlordship.<br>
<br>Sir James Fitzmaurice returned to Ireland in July 1579 proclaiming a papally sponsored crusade for Catholicism. He appealed to &Oacute; N&eacute;ill for support, and informed him of Pope Gregory XIII's offer to make him king. However, while in less sober moments &Oacute; N&eacute;ill expressed romantic desires for an Ireland free of English interference, he did not commit himself to Fitzmaurice's &#145;faith and fatherland&#146; ideology. He was conservative in religion, but not imbued with Counter-Reformation zeal despite the promptings of local churchmen such as Raymond O'Gallagher, bishop of Derry (1569&#150;1601). None the less, &Oacute; N&eacute;ill maintained contacts with the Catholic rebels, and particularly with Viscount Baltinglass after Fitzmaurice's death in August 1579. He made some promises to assist Baltinglass, and he offered himself as a foster father to James VI, the young king of Scotland, to draw the Scots into the conspiracy. Yet Turlough Luineach, pragmatic as he was, did not employ his considerable military resources to promote the Catholic cause. He waited for the military support that was supposed to arrive from Spain and Scotland, and meanwhile took advantage of the English crown's difficulties with the rebels to extend his own authority in Ulster. In August 1581 he abandoned Baltinglass and made peace with the crown in return for official recognition of his authority over his <i>uirrithe</i>.<h2>
<a name="ThechallengefromHughONeill"></a>The challenge from Hugh O'Neill</h2>Crown ministers rested their hopes for a settlement in Ulster congruent with English interests on Hugh O'Neill, baron of Dungannon. Hugh O'Neill had assisted Essex's plantation project in Clandeboye, and was well paid for his efforts. Essex's fort and bridge at the Blackwater River remained as a bulwark against &Oacute; N&eacute;ill behind which the baron was free to establish a dominant position in the region north of the pale. Hugh O'Neill emerged from Essex's d&eacute;b&acirc;cle with his personal standing greatly enhanced in both Irish and English eyes. One reflection of his status in Ulster is the fact that he was able to marry Siobh&aacute;n, a daughter of O'Donnell of Tyrconnell. That alliance gave the baron a provincial profile and had the effect of putting Turlough Luineach under pressure from the west as well as from the south-east. &Oacute; N&eacute;ill, however, responded with a master stroke: in 1579 he named Hugh O'Neill as his <i>t&aacute;naiste</i> or nominated successor, gave the baron the hand of his daughter in marriage, and had Siobh&aacute;n sent back to her father. Without his alliance with O'Donnell, though, Hugh O'Neill lost much of his leverage over &Oacute; N&eacute;ill, and he soon found himself deposed from the office of <i>t&aacute;naiste</i>. Turlough Luineach had taught his young rival a humiliating lesson in <i>realpolitik</i>.<br>
<br>Lord Deputy Grey promoted Hugh O'Neill with a joint commission alongside Sir Nicholas Bagenal to defend the pale against incursions from Ulster. He subsequently made him a royal lieutenant for south-east Ulster, alongside &Oacute; N&eacute;ill for the lordship of Tyrone and Bagenal for Antrim and Down. These commissions enhanced the baron's increasing power in southern Ulster <i>vis &agrave; vis</i> &Oacute; N&eacute;ill. When, in 1583, Turlough Luineach fell into a coma and was widely presumed to be dead, Hugh O'Neill crossed the Blackwater River with a large force and took possession of &Oacute; N&eacute;ill's inauguration site at Tullyhogue. However, after a severe hangover, Turlough Luineach made a full recovery and the baron was obliged to retire back across the Blackwater. Hugh O'Neill may have been Turlough Luineach's most likely successor, but the old lord was still predominant within Tyrone.<br>
<br>On 1 August 1584 an estimated 2000&#150;3000 Scottish fighters landed in Tyrconnell with the intention of establishing one of the sons of Shane O'Neill, whose mother was a MacLean from Scotland, in control of Tyrone. The O'Donnellys, who had fostered Shane, and O'Cahan, one of &Oacute; N&eacute;ill's leading <i>uirrithe</i>, defected to the MacShanes (literally the &#145;sons of Shane&#146;). Turlough Luineach O'Neill was left virtually powerless. His own son, Art O'Neill, forsook him and joined with Hugh O'Neill, his father-in-law, to salvage something of his inheritance. Hugh O'Neill came to an agreement with Turlough Luineach whereby the latter retained the title of &Oacute; N&eacute;ill but had his authority restricted to western Tyrone, his original power base. The baron, on the other hand, took control of eastern Tyrone and promised to pay &Oacute; N&eacute;ill 1000 marks per annum. Though this arrangement took the form of a seven-year lease which was revocable by &Oacute; N&eacute;ill at the end of three years, it left Hugh O'Neill as the predominant figure in Ulster, and &Oacute; N&eacute;ill was powerless to compel the baron to abide by the terms agreed. Unfortunately for &Oacute; N&eacute;ill, the baron was very antipathetic towards him, perhaps because he had murdered the baron's elder brother in 1562.<br>
<br>Lord Deputy Perrot sent English soldiers into Ulster to expel the MacLeans. With Perrot's approval, the Irish parliament of 1585, whose opening Turlough Luineach attended, recognized Hugh O'Neill as earl of Tyrone. This was seen as necessary by the crown to prevent the MacShanes taking advantage of any power vacuum which might otherwise have formed in the wake of &Oacute; N&eacute;ill's loss of authority. None the less, Perrot was concerned lest the earl of Tyrone should become an over-mighty subject. Consequently he endorsed the division of Tyrone agreed between Turlough Luineach and Hugh O'Neill, and sent 300 English soldiers to prop up &Oacute; N&eacute;ill's position in western Tyrone. Turlough Luineach petitioned the crown for the title of earl of Omagh, to hold western Tyrone as a perpetual inheritance, and for his son, Art, to be legitimated and made baron of Strabane. His petition was not granted. The earl of Tyrone persuaded Queen Elizabeth in 1587 that he was entitled to hold all of Tyrone on &Oacute; N&eacute;ill's death. None the less, &Oacute; N&eacute;ill proved to be more resilient than anyone had anticipated. Strengthened by a renewed alliance with the Scots in north Antrim&#151;in October 1588 &Oacute; N&eacute;ill had one of his daughters marry Sorley Boy MacDonnell at Strabane&#151;and the employment of English and Scottish mercenaries, Turlough Luineach was able to put the earl of Tyrone under real pressure, even to the extent of defeating him in a significant battle at Carricklea on 1 May 1588. &Oacute; N&eacute;ill also nurtured the ambitions of the MacShanes against the earl, despite an agreement to the contrary in October 1589.<h2>
<a name="Twilight"></a>Twilight</h2>In April 1592 Red Hugh O'Donnell succeeded his father as lord of Tyrconnell. He was a son-in-law of the earl of Tyrone, and was indebted to the earl for his escape from English custody in Dublin Castle earlier in the year. Together the young O'Donnell and the earl of Tyrone waged war on &Oacute; N&eacute;ill from east and west. Early in May 1593 Turlough Luineach O'Neill surrendered his rights of lordship in Tyrone in return for an annual pension of &pound;2000. He retained his demesne lands, together with the town of Strabane and the land surrounding it. This agreement was formally ratified by the English administration in Dublin on 28 June 1593. Turlough Luineach retained his title as &Oacute; N&eacute;ill. It seems unlikely, though, that the earl of Tyrone abided by this agreement any better than with the last made with Turlough Luineach, for in May 1594 &Oacute; N&eacute;ill offered to assure Ulster to the crown against the increasingly rebellious earl. In June 1595 the English ship <i>Poppinjay</i> was sent to Strabane to convey &Oacute; N&eacute;ill to Dublin, but the earl of Tyrone received prior warning and razed &Oacute; N&eacute;ill's castle at Strabane. Turlough Luineach O'Neill took shelter in a neighbouring ruin until his death in early September 1595. He was buried at Ardstraw in west Tyrone.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Turlough Luineach O'Neill has been eclipsed in Irish historiography by his more flamboyant predecessor and successor, Shane and Hugh O'Neill. Yet he was a man of very considerable political skill. He became &Oacute; N&eacute;ill despite the handicap of the peripheral location of his power base within Tyrone, and held on to the office for twenty-eight turbulent years. Like Shane and Hugh, he harboured thoughts of an Ireland free of English rule, but he was pragmatic enough to accept the reality that he had to reach some form of accommodation with the English crown or risk annihilation. The failure to achieve a durable settlement for Ulster cannot be ascribed to Turlough Luineach; it owed more to his rivals within Ulster, and to the crown.<br>
