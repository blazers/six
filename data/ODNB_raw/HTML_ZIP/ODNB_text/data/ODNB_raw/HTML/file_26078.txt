<span class="headword">Spalding,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>1624?, <em>d.</em> in or after 1669), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was the son of Alexander Spalding, an Aberdeen lawyer, and possibly of his first wife, Christian Hervie, but in January 1624 Alexander Spalding was disciplined for being the father of a child being carried by Euphame (Effie) Lillie, and for having tried to procure the unborn child's abortion. If John Spalding was this child and was thus born illegitimate, he was subsequently legitimized by his parents' marriage, for Alexander and Euphame were married by 1649.<br>
<br>Spalding was from the outbreak of the revolt against Charles I in Scotland in 1637 a committed royalist and episcopalian, and signed the king's covenant in October 1638. He entered King's College, Aberdeen, in 1640, just after it had been purged of its royalist staff by the covenanters, and graduated MA there in 1644. He then made his living as a clerk. On the defeat of the engagers' army in England in 1648 Spalding acted as clerk for the remnants of their forces in Scotland in September when they were negotiating terms under which they would disband.<br>
<br>Spalding is best-known through his <span class="italic">Memorialls of the Trubles</span>, but the title, inflicted by later editors, misrepresents the nature of the work and its author's intentions. He appears to have begun writing after the outbreak of the &#145;troubles&#146; in Scotland in 1637, but begins for no obvious reason with entries for 1624. A likely explanation was that this was the year of his birth, and that he thus intended his manuscript to cover events in his own lifetime. The early sections of his work are derivative accounts of occurrences during his childhood, mainly relating to rivalries and feuds in the north-east of Scotland, but after the beginning of rebellion against the king Spalding concentrates on detailing its progress, with a strong emphasis on Aberdeen and the north in general. He was an eyewitness to much of what happened in Aberdeen, but he rarely mentioned this, preferring to remain silent about himself. Thus while he furiously denounces the conduct of William Guild, the covenanting principal imposed on King's College (who even interfered with students' &#145;naturall eisment&#146; by roofing over the toilets, provoking a dirty protest of indiscriminate easement), he never mentions that he was a student at the university at the time  (Spalding, 2.188). This personal reticence may have been based both on his father's notoriety as a repeated adulterer and on the fact that his sisters (or half-sisters) showed an unfortunate taste for enemy soldiers. One was disciplined for fornication with a covenanter, and after the English conquest of Scotland two of them married members of the Cromwellian garrison. The distinctive name of Spalding was perhaps not one to boast of in Aberdeen.<br>
<br>Spalding provides a detailed account of the impact of civil war in the north-east, unrivalled by surviving sources for any other part of Scotland, and his rough, unpolished chronicle of events compensates for lack of sophistication by giving a sense of immediacy. In general the closer events were to Aberdeen, the more reliable Spalding's accounts of them are, though occasionally he widens his focus by inserting the texts of documents relating to national affairs. The manuscripts that survive end in 1644, but the text originally continued until at least 1647.<br>
<br>After the Restoration in 1660 Spalding was made a burgess of Edinburgh at the request of the new bishop of Aberdeen, whose servant he was (August 1661), and the following month he became a burgess of Aberdeen. Soon afterwards he was appointed clerk of the commissary court, but he resigned in 1663, having sold the right to the office to his successor. He settled in Edinburgh, and is last heard of there in 1669. His name was subsequently commemorated by three Aberdeen clubs devoted to publishing historical sources, the Spalding, New Spalding, and Third Spalding clubs (active 1839&#150;1960).<br>
