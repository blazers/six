<span class="headword">Muir,  (Isabella) Helen Mary</span>  (1920&#150;2005), <span class="occ">biochemist</span>, was born on 20 August 1920 at Naini Tal, India, the daughter of G. B. F. (Basil) Muir, a member of the Indian Civil Service, and his wife, Gladys Helen Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stack. Always known as Helen, she was educated by her mother in India up to the age of ten and then at boarding schools in Montreux, Switzerland, and in England, including Downe House in Berkshire. She gained entry to Somerville College, Oxford, to read medicine in 1940. Influenced by her tutor, Dorothy Hodgkin, she switched to study chemistry, and graduated with a second-class degree in 1943 then DPhil in 1947 for a thesis supervised by Sir Robert Robinson on the chemical synthesis of penicillin. After a year at the Dunn School of Pathology in Oxford (1947&#150;8) she moved to the National Institute of Medical Research in Mill Hill, where she worked in the biochemistry department with Albert Neuberger from 1948 to 1954, on the metabolic origin of carbon and nitrogen atoms in haem and later in collagen. Her work on collagen led her to develop an interest in connective tissues and arthritis, and she moved to the department of medicine headed by Stanley Peart at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, from 1954 to 1966, where her work on cartilage identified the link between chondroitin sulphate and protein and established the basic structure of proteoglycan, which is a major component of joint cartilage. This area of research formed the focus of her scientific career.<br>
<br>Muir was of striking appearance and matched the description of a fiery redhead. She had many male admirers, but was never married. In addition to scientific research the other strong interest of her life was horse riding. She was a member of the Bedale hunt in Yorkshire, where her parents had an estate and had built a house, Langlands, near Bedale. She suffered a bad riding accident in the 1950s, but this never detracted from her enthusiasm for riding and she continued until ill health forced her to stop when she was seventy-five. In London, where she worked for most of her career, she lived for many years in East Sheen and rode in nearby Richmond Park.<br>
<br>Much of Muir's career was spent at the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology in Hammersmith, which was the world's first specialist rheumatology institute, funded by the Arthritis Research Campaign. She was recruited as head of the biochemistry division in 1966 and went on to become director from 1977 until her retirement in 1990. Her group at the Kennedy carried out fundamental work on cartilage function, with novel work on the supramolecular organization of proteoglycans and studies on cartilage degeneration in experimental osteoarthritis. This work was fundamental in establishing that degenerative joint diseases were not just the product of &#145;wear and tear&#146; associated with old age, but involved an active disease process. Muir's major achievement was thus in moving research in joint diseases from an era of observational descriptive pathology to the molecular and cellular analysis of the processes underlying these diseases.<br>
<br>Muir's work at the Kennedy Institute on cartilage degeneration and osteoarthritis was internationally recognized. She was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1977 and a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1989. She was appointed CBE in 1981 for her contribution to medical research. She also received many other prestigious awards, including the Heberden medal of the British Society for Rheumatology (1976), the Feldberg Foundation award (1977), the Bunim medal of the American Rheumatism Association (1978), the Neil Hamilton Fairley medal of the Royal College of Physicians (1981), the Ciba medal of the Biochemical Society (1981), and the Steindler award of the American Orthopaedic Research Society (1982). She was also made a DSc of Oxford in 1973 and received honorary degrees from Brunel and Strathclyde universities and the University of Edinburgh, where her great-grandfather Sir William Muir had been principal.<br>
<br>Muir was well known for speaking her mind in a clear and objective way and she became the first woman member of the council of the Medical Research Council (1973&#150;7). She was also later appointed a trustee of the Wellcome Trust (1982&#150;90) and played a major part developing the trust's role in the support of UK biomedical research. She was able to promote the development of research on the role of extracellular matrix in health and disease, including the formation of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell-Matrix Research at the University of Manchester, which she opened in 1995.<br>
<br>Muir continued her interest in science and medicine into her retirement in Yorkshire, where ecological and environmental concerns led her to fit solar panelling to her house and to work to conserve the habitats of local wildlife. She suffered from spinal stenosis later in life, which restricted her mobility, and she survived breast cancer over several years before succumbing to it on 28 November 2005, at her home, Langlands House, Hornby, near Bedale, Yorkshire. She was buried in the local church at Hornby.<br>
