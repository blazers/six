<span class="headword">Reeves, Sir  William Conrad</span>  (1821&#150;1902), <span class="occ">politician and judge in Barbados</span>, was born in Bridgetown, Barbados. His father, Thomas Phillipps Reeves, who was white, was a skilled apothecary and his mother was a free black woman, Phyllis Clarke. As a &#145;free person of colour&#146;, Reeves was born into a slave society whose main divisions were those of colour and legal status. Free people of colour faced a variety of restrictions, including limits on occupations and on participation in political life. During Reeves's childhood, free coloureds in Barbados became the legal equals of white people and slavery itself was abolished in 1834; but the pattern of discrimination against the free people of colour continued after the abolition of slavery.<br>
<br>For Reeves, this meant an education in schools specifically established for free children of colour. As a young man he worked under the leading free coloured journalist of the period, Samuel Jackman Prescod. Prescod edited a radical paper, <span class="italic">The Liberal</span>, and had a distinguished career in the press and as a member of the Barbadian house of assembly. He was a strong believer in representative institutions as well as in the reform of the house of assembly and, in both areas, had a significant influence on Reeves's subsequent development.<br>
<br>In addition to working on <span class="italic">The Liberal</span>, Reeves was also a member of the debating club in Bridgetown. His success in debating and in public oratory encouraged some of the leading men of colour as well as the wider coloured community to support his legal education in England. He became a student at the Middle Temple in May 1860 and was called to the bar in January 1863. While in London he also wrote for the Barbados press. He returned to Barbados in 1864, where he practised law. From May 1867 he acted for a short period as attorney-general of St Vincent. In 1868 he married Margaret, eldest daughter of T. P. R. Budder of Bushey Park, St Thomas, Barbados. They had a daughter, who subsequently married and lived in Europe.<br>
<br>In 1874, when he was well over fifty years old, Reeves was elected to the house of assembly for the parish of St Joseph. He was appointed solicitor-general in 1875, but less than a year later resigned from his post in the middle of the federation crisis. This arose because of a Colonial Office plan to federate Barbados with the Windward Islands. Federation would result in Barbados losing its representative system of government and becoming a crown colony, a development which had occurred throughout the West Indies in the wake of the Morant Bay rebellion in Jamaica a decade previously. For the Colonial Office, and for the governor appointed to carry out this task, John Pope-Hennessy, this was desirable not only on administrative grounds but also because of their view (largely justifiable) that the assembly had failed to represent the interests of black people in the post-emancipation period. Advocates of crown colony government maintained that the Colonial Office would act impartially on behalf of the people, something it believed was impossible for a largely white oligarchy in control of the house of assembly.<br>
<br>For Reeves the survival of the house of assembly and of representative institutions in Barbados was a matter of grave importance. He therefore resigned his official post in the government and successfully led the opposition against Pope-Hennessy's proposal of confederating Barbados and the Windward Islands. Similarly, two years later, he opposed a Colonial Office proposal to appoint two crown nominees to represent the government in the house of assembly. Again, he believed that this plan was contrary to the principle of representative government, a system which had been in place in Barbados for well over two centuries.<br>
<br>However, in 1881 Reeves was prepared to modify his views on the relationship between the executive and the assembly. He suggested that a small committee of the legislature prepare bills for the house. After considerable debate the assembly passed an act along these lines: four members of the house and one member of the legislative council would work with the executive to prepare governmental measures. This development was in keeping with Reeves's views about representative government, as the members of the executive committee were representatives of the people rather than responsible to the crown.<br>
<br>For his support of the government, Reeves was appointed attorney-general in 1882 and was created KC in 1883. In 1884 he was instrumental in the widening of the franchise. As part of this process, the freehold qualification was reduced from a &pound;12 freehold to one worth &pound;5. Yet in spite of the reduced franchise requirements, the electorate was not significantly increased. In 1886 Reeves became chief justice of Barbados and was knighted in 1889. His legal judgments were regarded as clear and well worded and were subsequently collected in a volume co-edited by Sir William Herbert Greaves, a future chief justice of Barbados.<br>
<br>Reeves died on 9 January 1902 at his home, the Eyrie, in St Michael, Barbados. He was accorded a public funeral, the first part of which was held in a packed cathedral. The route to the cemetery was lined by thousands of people paying their respects to one of the most illustrious figures of nineteenth-century Barbados.<br>
<br>His role in the confederation crisis and in the subsequent constitutional developments marked him out but, unlike Samuel Jackman Prescod, he was not a radical; instead he espoused a conservative ideology. He believed that property was the only possible basis for the exercise of political power, and he could be complacent about the plight of black people who faced problems of unemployment and emigration. None the less, he was a clever and far-sighted politician. His resignation from the government during the confederation crisis might well have led to political obscurity; instead it brought him financial reward and subsequent political preferment.<br>
