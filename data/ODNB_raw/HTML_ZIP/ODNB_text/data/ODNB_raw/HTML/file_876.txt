<span class="headword">Attersoll,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1640), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was born in Tonbridge, Kent, and received his early education there. He matriculated from Peterhouse, Cambridge, in Michaelmas term 1579, graduated BA from Clare College early in 1583, and proceeded MA from Peterhouse in 1586. Ordained deacon and priest at Chichester on 6 October 1588, he became curate of Buxted, Sussex, the following year. About this time he married his first wife; initials on spoons willed to their sons indicated that her name began with A. From 1600 Attersoll was rector of Isfield, near Lewes, Sussex, where he had, or came to have, kin, and where his father was buried.<br>
<br>Over a period of thirty years Attersoll published a number of lengthy and systematic works of biblical commentary and of exposition of fundamental doctrines dedicated to leading godly gentry in the county. <span class="italic">The Badges of Christianity, or, A Treatise of the Sacraments</span> (1606) was dedicated to Sir Robert Shurley of Isfield, a signatory to the Sussex petition of 1604 for an educated, godly, and resident ministry. In a context where &#145;the adversaries of the grace of God as a pestilent brood of vipers mightily &hellip; increase and multiply&#146; (dedication), Attersoll offered ten sermons on <span class="roman">Corinthians</span>, emphasizing the role of sacraments as seals and instruments of grace, but as appurtenances to the Word. As a &#145;corollary&#146;, evidently intended as a direct attack on Roman Catholic doctrine, he appended &#145;The principles of the Christian religion &hellip; to be learned before &hellip; [admittance] to the Lords Supper&#146;. Both works subsequently appeared separately in amended and amplified versions. A series of commentaries on the book of <span class="roman">Numbers</span> was inaugurated with <span class="italic">The Pathway to Canaan</span> (1609), dedicated to Shurley and his wife, &#145;Dorothea&#146;; as was characteristic of his work, it was prefaced by a table of the doctrines discussed in it. <span class="italic">A continuation of the exposition of &hellip; Numbers, or, The historie of Balak the K. and Balaam the prophet</span> appeared the following year, dedicated to Sir Henry Fanshawe, a contemporary at Peterhouse. <span class="italic">A Commentarie upon the Epistle of Paule to Philemon</span> (1612), dedicated to Sir Thomas Pelham of Halland, encompassed a discussion of &#145;oeconomicall, politicall and ecclesiasticall&#146; duties running to 500 pages. In similar style, although over twice as long, was <span class="italic">A commentarie upon the fourth booke of Moses &hellip; containing the foundation of the church and commonwealth of the Israelites</span> (1618), dedicated to Pelham's friend Sir Walter Covert of Slaugham and his wife, Jane. Covering the whole book of <span class="roman">Numbers</span>, it claimed that &#145;more than five hundred Theological Questions [were] decided and determined&#146;, treating &#145;dogmaticall&#146;, &#145;ceremoniall&#146;, and &#145;polemicall&#146; matters such as the place of the sabbath, tithes, the relationship between magistrates and ministry, and controversy between the Church of England and the Church of Rome. Attersoll's line was conservative and orthodox: he chided discontent with governors set over the church by God, emphasized the high calling of the ministry, the importance of partaking of the sacraments, and the observance of comely order and reverence, and called for the excommunication of obstinate sinners.<br>
<br>It was fourteen years before the appearance of Attersoll's next, and final, work, <span class="italic">Three Treatises</span> (1632). In the first, &#145;The conversion of Nineveh&#146;, he described himself in the dedication to Sir John Rivers of Kent as &#145;being now in yeares, and &hellip; preparing for a nunc dimittis&#146;, but his message in this and in &#145;Gods Trumpet Sounding the Alarum&#146; was a familiar one of faith and repentance, and of preaching as a means to effect these. &#145;Physicke against famine&#146;, dedicated to &#145;Dorothy&#146;, Lady Shurley, was an exhortation to godliness in a world that had little time for it. A second edition of this, and of the commentary on <span class="roman">Philemon</span>, was published the following year; <span class="italic">The Principles of the Christian Religion</span> was reissued in 1635.<br>
<br>Attersoll implied that he had spent the intervening years at least partly in the important work of teaching; he may also have had family preoccupations. By 17 July 1636, when he drew up his will, he had one surviving daughter, Mary&#151;wife successively of Nicholas Culpeper (<i>d</i>. 1616) and of one Delve&#151;four sons, William, John, Thomas, and Samuel, and several grandchildren. His children's mother having died, he had married his second wife, also Mary, who herself had children and a granddaughter Mary Smith, &#145;the little child who hath oftimes refreshed me&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/183, fols. 187<i>r</i>&#150;188<i>r</i>). At some point Attersoll seems to have assumed some responsibility, with his daughter, for the upbringing of her son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6882/', "Nicholas Culpeper (1616&#150;1654)")</script>, the future physician and astrologer. According to Culpeper's biographer, Attersoll, disappointed in his hopes that his grandson would enter the ministry, and dismayed by his taste for astrology and occult philosophy, instead of settling his estate on the youth, as had been expected, left him a mere 40<i>s</i>. While that was indeed the sum specified in Attersoll's will, and other grandchildren received &pound;5, Attersoll, who was clearly not a rich man, had many potential heirs, and, on the biographer's own account, some time in the later 1630s spent &pound;50 securing an apprenticeship for Culpeper with a London apothecary. Attersoll died in 1640, and was buried at Isfield on 30 May.<br>
<br>Attersoll's will was proved on 25 June by his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_876"></a><span class="headword">William Attersoll</span>  (1590/91&#150;1664), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, who was born at Mayfield, Sussex. He attended Tonbridge School before matriculating from Peterhouse, Cambridge, in the Easter term of 1608. He graduated BA early in 1612, proceeded MA in 1615, and was ordained deacon in London, aged twenty-four, on 24 December that year, and priest in Chichester on 26 May 1616. Instituted in 1633 vicar of Laughton, Sussex, a living only a few miles from his father's, he was by 1653 rector of nearby East Hoathly. By this time he had married. In 1662 he was ejected from East Hoathly, his successor being instituted on 12 October. He was living in Burwash, in the same county, when, on 27 January 1664, he made a will which named his wife, Elizabeth, and son, William. He died soon afterwards, his will being proved on 5 May. His son, who graduated from Cambridge in 1673, was vicar of Bishopstone, also in Sussex, in 1679.<br>
