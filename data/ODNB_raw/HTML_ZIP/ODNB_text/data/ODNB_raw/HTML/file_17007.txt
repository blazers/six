<span class="headword">Loosemore,  John</span>  (1613/14&#150;1681), <span class="occ">organ builder</span>, was born probably at Bishop's Nympton, Devon, the son of Samuel Loosemore (<i>bap</i>. 1577, <i>d</i>. 1642), organ builder, and his wife, Gillian Maney (<i>bap</i>. 1584). He was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17005/', "George Loosemore")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17006/', "Loosemore, Henry")</script>] and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17006/', "Henry Loosemore")</script>, who were both organists and composers. He was baptized at Barnstaple on 25 August 1616. Nothing is known of his life until the period 1635&#150;8, when he looked after the organ at Hartland church, Devon. At the Restoration he was at Exeter Cathedral, where for the rest of his life he was clerk of works and lived in the cathedral close. In November 1660 he was paid &pound;5 by the chapter towards &#145;the making of a sett of pipes to&#146; a temporary organ used in the cathedral until a new one was built. Another instrument, a small chamber organ for the choir school, survived until the twentieth century.<br>
<br>In January 1663 Loosemore was sent at the expense of the chapter to Cornwall, where he selected tin for a new organ that he was to build in the cathedral. Later that year he went to examine Thomas Harris's organ in Salisbury Cathedral, &#145;the better to inform himself to make the new organ&#146; at Exeter, and in 1664 he visited London &#145;about the church's business&#146;. His new cathedral organ, completed about 1665, was one of the largest built in the years after the Restoration, and was Loosemore's most important work. Its specification was unadventurous and representative of several new cathedral instruments of the time in its continuation of the English organ building style before the civil war. In these organs there were few if any signs of the continental devices&#151;such as reed, mixture, and mutation ranks&#151;adopted by the Dallams, who had recently returned to Britain from Brittany. Despite the essential conservatism of the Exeter organ, its great double diapason with large pipes was a notable feature, though perhaps more for its ostentatiousness than for its musical value. Indeed, a contemporary visitor thought the organ's visual qualities outweighed its aural ones. Loosemore's organ case survives. His autograph note of &#145;what the organ cost&#146; gives &pound;847 7<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>. as the total sum, owing to &#145;not bying tinne in seson&#146;.<br>
<br>Among other organs built by Loosemore was one for Sir George Trevelyan of Nettlecombe Court, Somerset (<i>c</i>.1665); its reed stop suggests that Loosemore was not entirely immune to French influence, though he remained at heart a member of the old English school. He was also a maker of virginals, and, like other makers of his time, used boxwood for naturals in the keyboards. One of his virginals (1655) is in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Loosemore was married, and in 1674 his daughter, Joane, married John Shearme, who was also an organ builder and probably Loosemore's assistant. Loosemore died in Exeter on 18 April 1681, in his sixty-eighth year, and was buried in Exeter Cathedral on 20 April. His epitaph on a gravestone in the transept records that he was &#145;easily the chief among craftsmen of his kind&#146;  (translation from the Latin; Edmonds, 31).<br>
