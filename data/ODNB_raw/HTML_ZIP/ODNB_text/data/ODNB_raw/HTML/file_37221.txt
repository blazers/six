<span class="headword">Brearley,  Harry</span>  (1871&#150;1948), <span class="occ">metallurgist</span>, was born on 18 February 1871 at 23 Spital Street, Sheffield, the youngest of five sons and the eighth of nine children of John Brearley, steelworker, and his wife, Jane Senior. Brearley's father was &#145;an expert steel melter and also an expert ale-supper&#146;  (Brearley, <span class="italic">Knotted String</span>, 20); his mother, a blacksmith's daughter, took in washing to help raise her large family. He grew into a delicate child, whose slum upbringing&#151;and especially his mother's hard life&#151;sowed the seeds of his later socialism. Educated at Woodside board school, at the age of twelve Brearley worked briefly in the crucible steel furnaces alongside his father at Thos Firth &amp; Sons (an experience he immortalized in <span class="italic">Steel-Makers</span>, 1933). By 1883 he had gravitated to Firth's laboratories, where he washed bottles. The firm's chemist, James Taylor&#151;a crucial influence on Brearley&#151;encouraged him to study metallurgy. By the age of twenty Brearley had become a laboratory assistant and was apprenticed for a premium of &pound;50. Shortly afterwards, now earning about &pound;2 a week and describing himself as a metallurgical chemist, he married, on 23 October 1895, Helen Theresa Crank (1874&#150;1955), the daughter of James Crank, a coal dealer.<br>
<br>Brearley progressed rapidly in his chosen profession and in 1901 he left Firths to start a new laboratory at another Sheffield steelworks, Kayser Ellison. While there, he wrote the first of his technical texts (with Fred Ibbotson), <span class="italic">The Analysis of Steel-works Materials</span> (1902). Brearley returned to Firths in 1903, after its merger with John Brown &amp; Co. After a spell as chief chemist at Firth's Salamander works at Riga, in 1907 Brearley became the first director of a newly created research division&#151;the Brown-Firth Research Laboratories.<br>
<br>In May 1912, while researching steel for small arms, Brearley made trials with low carbon steels containing about 12 per cent chromium. These steels had the happy ability (due to the formation of a chromium oxide film on the steel's surface) to resist corrosion, a fact recognized by Brearley almost immediately. He also saw the commercial possibilities of the product and alerted Firths. According to Brearley, Firths showed little interest, and he was left to find a use for it. He suggested that it might be useful for cutlery, a view vindicated when the Sheffield cutlery firm of George Ibberson succeeded in 1914 in making knife blades from the alloy. Stainless (or as it was then known, &#145;rustless&#146;) steel had arrived, and by the First World War commercial production in Sheffield was well under way.<br>
<br>Brearley's claims as stainless steel's discoverer did not go unchallenged. In America the metallurgist Elwood Haynes had pre-empted his chromium formula; while in Germany, Eduard Maurer and Benno Strauss at Krupps had patented, in 1912&#150;13, a chromium nickel stainless alloy that was to have even more potential than Brearley's composition. Nevertheless, Brearley's claim as the pioneer of the commercial development of martensitic stainless steel (the type used in cutlery) can be accepted. An individualist of socialist leanings, he intended sharing in the credit and rewards of his discovery, an attitude which led to many disputes with his employers. In 1915 he left Firths and became a works manager of Brown Bayley's steelworks in Sheffield, a company he was to be associated with until his death. Remarkably, stainless steel was never patented in Britain (the discovery appears to have spread so quickly in Sheffield that patenting was not thought worth while). However, Firths and Brearley (after they had settled their differences) soon tied up the rights on stainless steel in the USA, Canada, Italy, France, and Japan, so that any Sheffield firm intending to export to these countries needed a licence from the Firth-Brearley Stainless Steel Syndicate&#151;an organization founded in 1917, which made good profits for Firths and Brearley in the 1920s.<br>
<br>In 1920 Brearley was awarded the Bessemer gold medal by the Iron and Steel Institute. Five years later he became a director of Brown Bayleys, and shortly afterwards, at about the age of fifty-five, he began enjoying a period of semi-retirement on the rewards of stainless steel. He wrote several books, notably an evocative autobiography, <span class="italic">Knotted String</span> (1941). In 1942 he established the Freshgate Trust Foundation, a charity which he hoped would &#145;help lame dogs over stiles&#146;. Brearley lived at Walton, near Chesterfield, and later in life moved to Livermead, Torquay, where he died at his home, Walton Cottage, 21 Mead Road, on 14 July 1948. He was cremated at Efford crematorium, Plymouth, on 16 July. He left &pound;80,881 gross, of which he bequeathed &pound;1000 a year to his widow for life (his only child, Leo, born in 1896, had died in Australia in 1946) and the remainder to the Freshgate Foundation.<br>
