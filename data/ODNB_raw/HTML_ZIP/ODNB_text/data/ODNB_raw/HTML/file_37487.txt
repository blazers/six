<span class="headword">Greenway,  Francis Howard</span>  (1777&#150;1837), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 20 November 1777 in Mangotsfield, Gloucestershire, the youngest of the three sons of Francis Greenway or Grinway, mason of Mangotsfield, and his wife, Ann Webb. He became a pupil in London of John Nash, and it was presumably through Nash's connection with south Wales that in 1801 he was employed to design a small public building in Carmarthen. The story of his subsequent career is an unusually dramatic one. About 1805 he and his brothers Olive and John Tripp Greenway established themselves in Bristol at 7 Limekiln Lane, as &#145;stonemasons, architects, builders etc.&#146;, with Francis the architect member of the partnership  (Colvin, <span class="italic">Archs</span>., 430). In 1806 he designed the hotel and assembly rooms in the suburb of Clifton, which the firm contracted to build; but at the same time the brothers were speculating by buying unfinished houses in Clifton which they completed and sold, and in 1809 they were overtaken by bankruptcy. Then, some time later, Francis Greenway was accused of forgery in connection with a building contract made shortly before the business failure. He was tried at Bristol assizes on 23 March 1812, pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to transportation for life.<br>
<br>After arriving in Australia in February 1814, however, Greenway quickly resumed his profession and became the virtual father of Australian architecture. Within months of his arrival he established a practice at 84 George Street, Sydney, and found a patron in Governor Lachlan Macquarie of New South Wales, who had ambitious plans for public works in the colony; and in 1816 he was appointed civil architect. He received his emancipation in the following year, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1832), whom he had married in 1804, rejoined him in Australia with their three children. In 1822, following Macquarie's departure, Greenway was dismissed from the post, but during his short period of office he had carried out or initiated a remarkable number of substantial building projects in Sydney and its neighbourhood, the most important of which were the Macquarie lighthouse (<i>c</i>.1816&#150;18; dem.), the churches of St Matthew, Windsor (<i>c</i>.1817), St Luke, Liverpool (1818&#150;24), and St James's Sydney (<i>c</i>.1820), the stables at Government House (1817), Fort Macquarie at Benelong Point (<i>c</i>.1817; dem.), and the Hyde Park convict barracks (1817; now the district courts), which last project earned Greenway absolute pardon in 1819. The stables and the fort were in a conventional castellated style, but most of his work is in a bold and simple classical idiom of considerable originality and merit.<br>
<br>Greenway is said to have been self-confident, &#145;temperamental and quick to take offence&#146;  (Herman, 43). After his dismissal in 1822 he continued in private practice in a small way for some years, evidently living in somewhat reduced circumstances. In 1837 he retired from Sydney to his government land-grant property on the Hunter River, where he died in September of that year. He was buried on 26 September 1837 in East Maitland cemetery, New South Wales. His views on Australian architecture were published in an essay in the <span class="italic">Australian Almanac</span> (1835). His wife had opened a small school for girls in Sydney, and of their five sons and three daughters, one son, Charles, became an archdeacon and canon at Grafton Cathedral.<br>
