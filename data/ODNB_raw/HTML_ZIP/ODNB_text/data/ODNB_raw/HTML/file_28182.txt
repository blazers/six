<span class="headword">Vendramini,  Giovanni</span>  (1769&#150;1839), <span class="occ">engraver and architect</span>, was born at Roncade, near Bassano, then under Venetian rule. In Bassano he studied architecture with Antonio Gaidon, but preferred engraving, particularly stipple, which he practised in the studio of Antonio Suntach. Vendramini was invited to London by Luigi Schiavonetti (1765&#150;1810), who was also from Bassano and for whom Vendramini worked for three years. They were among the many &#145;distinguished young men&#146; who paid &#145;high premiums&#146; to follow Francesco Bartolozzi (1725&#150;1815) to Britain to learn the secret of stipple-engraving  (Baily, 28). As one of Bartolozzi's ablest pupils, Vendramini succeeded to his master's workshop and house at North End in Fulham when Bartolozzi left for Lisbon in 1802. Among Vendramini's earliest and most renowned works are the five plates he engraved for the set of thirteen <span class="italic">Cries of London</span>, after Francis Wheatley (1747&#150;1801), between 1793 and 1797. Published by Colnaghi &amp; Co., this series was supervised by Schiavonetti. Vendramini subsequently took over Schiavonetti's engraving business at 12 Michaels Street, Brompton. Other early stipple works include <span class="italic">St John the Baptist</span>, after Raphael, and <span class="italic">The Power of Love</span>, after Pellegrini.<br>
<br>In February 1802, by a marriage licence dated 5 February, Vendramini married a British woman of Portuguese origin, Lucy de Faria, with whom he had two daughters. Between 1802 and 1805 he produced a number of large-scale engravings after the panoramic paintings by Sir Robert Kerr Porter, among them <span class="italic">The Storming of Seringapatam</span>, <span class="italic">The Passage of the Alps by the Russians under Suvarrow</span>, and <span class="italic">The Death of Sir Ralph Abercromby</span>, which were published by John P. Thompson. During this same period he engraved Porter's <span class="italic">Twenty-Six Illustrations to Anacreon</span>, published on 4 June 1805. On the back of this success, in 1805 Vendramini went to St Petersburg and later to Moscow, where he worked for Tsar Alexander I for two years. Among his profitable commissions produced there was the engraved portrait <span class="italic">Catherine, Empress of Russia</span> and his only known colour aquatint, <span class="italic">The Conflagration of Moscow, Sept 14 1812</span>. So successful was his work in Russia that Vendramini was unable to leave the country without the help of the ambassador for Naples and Duke Sarcopkiolo, who enabled him to cross the border as a diplomatic courier. After his return to Britain he concentrated on producing faithful large stipple plates of Italian old masters, notably <span class="italic">Leda</span>, after Leonardo da Vinci, <span class="italic">The Vision of St Catherine</span>, after Paul Veronese, <span class="italic">St Sebastian</span>, after Spagnoletto, <span class="italic">The Raising of Lazarus</span>, after Sebastiano del Piombo (now in the National Gallery), and a <span class="italic">Deposition</span>, after Donatello. He also produced several prints after Cipriani (<span class="italic">Amorini</span>) and H. Singleton (Pomfret's <span class="italic">Love Triumphant over Reason</span>). Of contemporary interest was his set of sixteen portraits of European leaders who visited London between 1814 and 1815, which were published by him at 14 Brompton Row. Among the more notable portraits he is known to have engraved are <span class="italic">Miss Maria Theresa Decamp as Urania</span>, after P. Jean (1802), <span class="italic">William Wilberforce</span>, after H. Edridge (1809), <span class="italic">Sir Peter Francis Bourgeois</span>, after Sir W. Beechey (1811), and <span class="italic">Joseph Nollekens</span>, after F. Abbot (1816); these and others of his works are in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. Vendramini died, a widower, of &#145;disease of the brain&#146; at his house at 91 Quadrant, Regent Street, London, on 8 February 1839.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_28182"></a><span class="headword">Francesco Vendramini</span>  (1780&#150;1856), <span class="occ">engraver and architect</span>, and the brother of Giovanni, was born in Bassano and appears to have followed Giovanni to London. It is not known if he married, but his daughter, Julia Frances Vendramini, was baptized at St Paul's, Covent Garden, in 1803. He accompanied his brother to St Petersburg, where in 1808 he became a member of the Academy of Fine Arts. In 1824 he returned to Bassano, intending to settle there. After only fifteen days, however, he moved to Florence, where he lived for eleven years and engraved many plates. He was offered a post in Rome as engraver to the pontificate, but returned to Russia to live and worked as an architect until his death, on 2 February 1856. Francesco too worked in stipple, in the style of Bartolozzi, and in line-engraving. His works include a number of portraits of contemporary Russian personalities, in particular <span class="italic">Alexander I</span>, after St Aubin (1819). In Bassano he produced portraits of living illustrious Italians and reproduced prints after Reni, Maratti, Ribera, and Titian, whose <span class="italic">Death of Peter Martyr</span> is described as his finest and best-known print. At the time of his death he held the status of professor in St Petersburg. Among joint printing collaborations with his brother is the portrait of <span class="italic">Kurakin</span> (Prince Aleksandr Borisovich), after Barowikowski.<br>
