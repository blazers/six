<span class="headword">Townshend,  Thomas</span>, first Viscount Sydney  (1733&#150;1800), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in London on 24 February 1733, the eldest son of three sons and two daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27635/', "Thomas Townshend (1701&#150;1780)")</script>, politician [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27617/', "Townshend, Charles, second Viscount Townshend")</script>], and Albinia (1713/14&#150;1739), daughter of Colonel John Selwyn. He was educated at Eton College (1748) and at Clare College, Cambridge (1750&#150;53), from where he graduated MA in 1753.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareerandmarriage"></a>Early career and marriage</h2>A member of the well-connected Townshend family, with familial links to the Selwyns, Walpoles, and Pelhams, Tommy Townshend was marked out for a political career. His grandfather had been secretary of state under Walpole, the duke of Newcastle was his great-uncle, and his cousin was the brilliant Charles Townshend. He became MP for Whitchurch, in Hampshire, on his father's interest in 1754. With both father and son initially attached to their influential kinsman Newcastle, Tommy was made a clerk to the household of the prince of Wales in 1756. Upon George III's accession in 1760 he was raised to the sinecure of clerk of the board of green cloth. He married, on 19 May 1760, Elizabeth (1736&#150;1826), eldest daughter and coheir of Richard Powys of Hintlesham, Suffolk, and his wife, Mary Brudenell. They had six sons and six daughters. Elizabeth Townshend later served as lady of the bedchamber to Queen Charlotte.<br>
<br>Newcastle resigned in opposition to the king's favourite, Bute, in May 1762, and in November the king dismissed Newcastle's ally the duke of Devonshire. Unlike most Pelhamite officeholders Townshend decided to stay in place. But as a &#145;young friend&#146; of Newcastle, eager for systematic opposition, he was notable in speaking and voting against the ministry's peace preliminaries after the Seven Years' War. He was ousted in the &#145;Massacre of the Pelhamite Innocents&#146; in December 1762. George III thought he could not &#145;be too soon dismissed, that will frighten others&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters &hellip; to Lord Bute</span>, 174).<br>
<br>Townshend remained close to the Newcastle&#150;Rockingham faction, though he was gravitating towards William Pitt. In December 1762 he acted as intermediary in discussions between the two parties. Rockingham brought him back into office as a lord of the Treasury on 12 July 1765. However, Townshend kept a foot in Pitt's camp and again, during the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> crisis in January 1766, was commissioned to sound out the great man. When Pitt (now earl of Chatham) formed a ministry in July, with Rockingham replaced by the duke of Grafton at the Treasury, Townshend remained in place; indeed he informed Newcastle that he would not resign. On 23 December 1767 he was rewarded with a share of the potentially lucrative position of paymaster-general of the forces and was sworn of the privy council. By the general election of 1768 it seemed that he had completely drifted away from the Rockinghams; neither Newcastle nor Rockingham now counted him as a supporter.<br>
<br>In 1768 this second phase of Townshend's courtly career came to a premature end. Grafton wanted him to make way for Richard Rigby at the pay office in order to gain support for his ministry from the duke of Bedford's group. But Townshend was not prepared to settle for the second-best of Rigby's vice-treasurership of Ireland (though it was of similar status and value), and, as Rigby reported, was &#145;obstinately bent to carry his folly so far as to go out of employment&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of John, Fourth Duke of Bedford</span>, 3.401). On 10 June 1768 he left office and was to remain in opposition for the next fourteen years.<h2>
<a name="Inopposition"></a>In opposition</h2>Rockingham eagerly excused Townshend's earlier behaviour once he had come back into the opposition fold. He told Newcastle &#145;I have always had a partiality towards Tommy Townshend&#146; and justified his flouncing out of government as a result of &#145;his never having been quite so satisfied in his own mind since he separated from us&#146;. Townshend himself claimed his actions &#145;had not arose from any bickering about this or that office&#146; but from a political decision to oppose the Bedfordites  (BL, Add. MS 32990, fols. 206&#150;7, 216&#150;18).<br>
<br>Townshend's attachments, however, were never clear-cut in this period and his loyalties were apparently flexible. He never fully re-entered the Rockingham orbit. His father controlled the two parliamentary seats at Whitchurch and his uncle George Selwyn nominated those at Ludgershall; upon their deaths, in 1780 and 1791 respectively, Townshend had control of all four seats. With his family and &#145;parliamentary interest&#146;, as well as his &#145;very independent fortune&#146;, he had the ability to act freely  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Wraxall</span>, 2.45). There are reports of him being variously &#145;a great admirer&#146; of George Grenville, influenced by Lord George Germain (for whom he acted as second in his duel of December 1770; <span class="italic">Correspondence of Edmund Burke</span>, 3.407), and connected to the king's estranged brother, the duke of Gloucester (Horace Walpole regarded him as Gloucester's only &#145;sensible&#146; friend; <span class="italic">Last Journals</span>, 1.165). His most consistent flirtation, though, was with Pitt; never an out-and-out Chathamite he rather hovered between him and the Rockinghams&#151;and always he hoped for conciliation between the two.<br>
<br>In 1769 Townshend was talking optimistically to Edmund Burke about a &#145;union of the parties&#146;, specifically referring to a conversation with Chatham. Burke, now at the heart of Rockinghamite thinking, considered Townshend a &#145;very honest and safe man&#146;; Rockingham countered that &#145;our friend&#146; Townshend was &#145;na&iuml;ve&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Edmund Burke</span>, 3.88&#150;90). Four years later, in January 1773, Burke wondered where Townshend's loyalties lay when he was missing on an important vote against the ministry's East Indian measures. He implied that Townshend might have been led astray by Chatham on this occasion, as he &#145;is disposed to a great deference to the opinions of those, who are at most but allies&#146;. Burke reassured Rockingham, however, that it was their own party that &#145;he loves by far the best&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Edmund Burke</span>, 3.406&#150;7).<br>
<br>Once in opposition Townshend aimed to show what a nuisance he could be. He was notable in opposing the expulsion of Wilkes in 1769 and became one of the most prominent MPs in opposition to North's ministry; he was the opposition candidate for speaker in 1770. It has been calculated that he spoke 380 times during the 1768&#150;74 parliament; only the Rockinghamite spokesmen Burke and Dowdeswell and the prime minister himself spoke more frequently.<h2>
<a name="TheAmericancrisis"></a>The American crisis</h2>The growing crisis in America eclipsed all other issues in this period. Townshend's position was equivocal at first. With the Rockinghams and the Pittites he had opposed the passing of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> in 1765 and was in favour of its repeal the following year. However, he had not opposed Charles Townshend's duties on America in 1767, when he was a junior member of the Treasury; he later claimed that if there had been a division he would have done so. In February 1769 he sought to justify his cousin's duties: &#145;it was not the opinion of one man &hellip; It had pervaded the nation that it was absolutely necessary to do something &hellip; He desired taxes agreeable to the Americans themselves&#146;  (BL, Egerton MS 217, fols. 267&#150;8).<br>
<br>Townshend was later wrong-footed by events in America in 1774. Like many contemporaries he was horrified by the Boston Tea Party. He supported the ministry's <span class="roman">Boston Port Bill</span>, the <span class="roman">Massachusetts Government Bill</span>, and the <span class="roman">Massachusetts Justice Bill</span>, as he believed the Americans should be punished; he only started to question government measures for quelling the problems when no conciliatory measure was announced. He believed that the tea duty on America should be reviewed. With the introduction of the <span class="roman">Quebec Bill</span>, Townshend's hostility to the government was on firmer ground, for he found it easy to attack this as a threat to English liberty. After this point he was in line with opposition thinking on America, though he wavered between the Rockinghamite and Chathamite strains. With the Rockinghams he bemoaned the worsening news from America up to the outbreak of war in 1775, while the Chathamites rejoiced, seeing it as a positive opportunity. By 1778 he was with the Chathamites in opposing the acceptance of outright independence, whereas the Rockinghams now reluctantly admitted the reality of the situation.<br>
<br>Townshend was one of the most vociferous opponents of North, who in the debate of 3 June 1774 on the <span class="roman">Quebec Bill</span> reportedly &#145;rose in a terrible passion&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 17, 1774, 1390) and declared that he did not care what Townshend thought of him, for he was a &#145;passionate and prejudiced man&#146;  (BL, Egerton MS 261, fol. 406).<br>
<br>Townshend was at the centre of opposition thinking and was consulted on matters of parliamentary tactics. What he hoped for most of all was reconciliation between Rockingham and Chatham. In November 1777, when the ministry was reeling from ill success in America, he &#145;never saw so fair &hellip; [a] prospect of union among those in opposition&#146;. He expressed satisfaction that Chatham would not only be consulted but &#145;referred to for his absolute decision&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 2.11). Walpole thought Townshend had always been &#145;chiefly connected&#146; with Chatham  (<span class="italic">Last Journals</span>, 2.491). Townshend did weep openly in the Commons on the announcement of Chatham's death in 1778 and, with outright Chathamites and Rockinghams, was a pallbearer at Chatham's funeral. He appears, however, to have remained independent of the Chatham&#150;Shelburne connection down to the end of North's ministry.<br>
<br>Townshend tied his fortunes to the Rockinghams and their allies as long as North was in power. The aim was to bring down the government, and he, like them, waited on events in America. Failure in the war meant that by 1780 cracks had started to appear in the ministry. In the economical reform debates in March the opposition hoped for success, and there are reports of Townshend and Charles James Fox vying for who should take the pay office upon a ministerial change. Townshend's debating skills had put him in the running for significant office. By July 1780, with negotiations between the ministry and opposition, even the king accepted that men like Townshend would be a positive acquisition to his government.<h2>
<a name="Incabinet"></a>In cabinet</h2>North's ministry was finally overturned in March 1782 and Rockingham returned to power. Townshend's uncle George Selwyn reported that his nephew had &#145;a situation fixed in his own mind, as adequate to his consequence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Carlisle MSS</span>, 595). On 27 March he was made secretary at war, and Selwyn believed that &#145;this was what he hoped for&#146;  (ibid., 608). Yet Townshend's cherished whig unity was soon tested with the death of Rockingham just three months later. Shelburne succeeded him and consequently Fox and most of the Rockinghams left office. While others went out with Fox in 1782 Townshend never entertained the idea; echoing Chatham's perennial maxim of &#145;measures not men&#146; he condemned Fox's &#145;quitting if measures are right because they cannot fill offices to their wish&#146;  (<span class="italic">Later Correspondence of George III</span>, 6). Walpole considered that Townshend had &#145;addicted himself&#146; to Shelburne  (<span class="italic">Last Journals</span>, 2.491). More likely, first with the smashing of North's solid ministry and then with Rockingham's death, Townshend felt that the situation was fluid again and that he himself was a free agent. Most of the cabinet having deserted, on 10 July 1782 he replaced Shelburne at the Home Office. Shelburne's ministry soldiered on despite constant opposition from the Rockingham whigs. Townshend played his part, strenuously defending in the Commons the peace with America. But in April 1783 he was ousted, with the Shelburne ministry, as the Fox&#150;North coalition forced themselves into government. Shelburne's parting request to the king was to reward Townshend with a peerage for his parliamentary services to the ministry. He was created Baron Sydney on 6 March.<br>
<br>Sydney's latest exclusion from office was of very short duration. By December 1783 the king had expelled the coalition and placed the young William Pitt at the head of his ministry. With a lack of senior politicians willing to serve with him Sydney was brought back as home secretary on 23 December. Apparently he had &#145;volunteered&#146;, though he &#145;very much disliked the employment&#146; and hoped for a less taxing position in future  (Fitzmaurice, 2.280&#150;81).<h2>
<a name="Pittsministry"></a>Pitt's ministry</h2>As early as 1784 Pitt considered replacing Sydney at the Home department. On agreeing to dissolve parliament in March 1784 he wanted to add something to the king's speech about parliamentary reform; Sydney and most of the cabinet notably overruled this. Sydney thought of parliamentary reform for Ireland as &#145;ruinous&#146; and a &#145;crude and undigested &hellip; proposal&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 3.78). It appears that he had the same view on reform in England, for when the opposition accused Pitt of being lukewarm on the proposal Sydney confessed &#145;I could, from my heart, forgive him that crime&#146;  (ibid., 81). In May, after success in the general election, Pitt asked Richmond to replace Sydney, who would have taken the privy seal, but Richmond declined.<br>
<br>Now in late middle age, Sydney was fairly conservative. The king confided in this like-minded cabinet ally that he disapproved of Pitt's espousal of parliamentary reform in January 1785. George III had &#145;unalterable sentiments&#146; about changing the constitution but wanted to deal diplomatically with Pitt's proposals  (<span class="italic">Later Correspondence of George III</span>, 3.119). In March he again sought the advice of Sydney, who confessed to &#145;lamenting extremely that the subject of a Parliamentary Reform should come into discussion&#146;  (ibid., 142) at this difficult time. Though the king had promised Pitt that he would not discuss his views on reform with anyone else Sydney was certainly party to his hostility. He gave only half-hearted support to penal reform and, with Lord Chancellor Thurlow, spoke in opposition to the abolition of the slave trade in June 1788. On this occasion Pitt threatened that if they would not support him on this then he could no longer work with them in cabinet. Anti-abolitionism was obviously strongly felt by Sydney, for he opposed measures to abolish the slave trade in the Lords until as late as July 1799.<br>
<br>By 1789 Pitt felt that the time was right to rid himself of Sydney, who was more expendable for the king than was Thurlow and in June &#145;received from Mr Pitt your Majesty's gracious determinations regarding me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Later Correspondence of George III</span>, 3.421). Sydney handed over the seals of office on 5 June and was created Viscount Sydney six days later. It was during his period as home secretary, however, that he created for himself his lasting memorial. He had concerned himself with the affairs of the new colony of New South Wales. In particular he had supported the establishment of a penal colony at Botany Bay; in 1788 the settlement was named Sydney in honour of him.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>Sydney's removal from office was sweetened with the sinecure of the chief justiceship in eyre, south of the Trent, which was worth &pound;2500 a year; he was also made deputy lieutenant of Kent in 1793. The income from his various offices added to the considerable wealth that he had inherited on the death of his father in 1780, together with the family estate of Frognal, near Chislehurst, in Kent; he was further enriched when he succeeded to the landed estates of his uncle Selwyn on his death in 1791. He appears to have benefited also from the death of the tenth earl of Exeter, in December 1793, for Exeter's late wife had left &pound;70,000 to her husband for his life, with a subsequent reversion to Townshend.<br>
<br>Sydney died at his estate at Frognal on 30 June 1800, of a cerebral haemorrhage, and was buried on 3 July in Chislehurst church. His estate and title passed to his eldest son, John Thomas. For a man who held high office for six years Sydney is an overlooked figure. Even his obituaries were more concerned with the manner of his death than with his achievements in life. Most contemporary commentators seemed to consider him not hugely talented. Storer damned him with the faint praise that he had &#145;surpassed everybody's expectation in his political career&#146;  (<span class="italic">Carlisle MSS</span>, 376). Wraxall too was convinced that &#145;his abilities, though respectable, scarcely rose above mediocrity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Wraxall</span>, 2.45). This view of his worth is echoed by modern historians, in particular Pitt's biographers. Rose was certainly over-generalizing, in relation to Sydney, when he stated that only Pitt and Thurlow in the 1784 ministry &#145;could make a tolerable speech&#146;  (Barnes, 74). Ehrman, while admitting that he was &#145;assiduous&#146; and &#145;a fair debater&#146;, concluded that he was &#145;an average politician of the second rank&#146; who was &#145;seldom impressive&#146; (Ehrman, 2.184&#150;5; 3.125). These judgements are a little harsh. The initial enthusiasm of the principled &#145;young friend&#146; of Newcastle does seem to have waned first into vocal independence and then settled merely into a desire for office and honours. In this last respect Sydney was successful, and he certainly avoided the permanent, barren opposition of many of his contemporaries.<br>
<br>What can be said is that Sydney was perhaps mistaken in accepting a peerage and thus losing much of the influence that came from being a Commons' man. He had been appointed by Rockingham&#151;and retained by Shelburne and Pitt&#151;for his debating skills, which were notable. His administrative skills, once in high office, were not so readily apparent. Wraxall pronounced:<blockquote>the reputation that he had acquired while seated on the opposition bench &hellip; he did not preserve or sustain after his elevation to the peerage &hellip; Tommy Townshend displayed very considerable talents. Lord Sydney, when removed to the Upper House of Parliament, seemed to have sunk into an ordinary man. (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Wraxall</span>, 4.5)</blockquote>
