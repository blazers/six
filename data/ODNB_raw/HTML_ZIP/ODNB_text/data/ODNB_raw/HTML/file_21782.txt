<span class="headword">Peirce,  James</span>  (1674&#150;1726), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and religious controversialist</span>, was the younger son of John Peirce (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1676) and his wife, Deborah (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1681). His parents, &#145;who lived in good fashion&#146;, were both members of the Bull Lane Independent Church, Stepney, under Matthew Mead; Peirce was baptized at Bull Lane on 26 July 1674. His parents both died when he was young  (Peirce, <span class="italic">Second Letter</span>, 29).<h2>
<a name="Earlylife"></a>Early life</h2>After the death of his mother, when he was about seven, Peirce was placed with his older brother and sister under the guardianship of Mead, who took him into his own house and educated him with his sons. He received his grammar education from John Nesbitt and others. Peirce then studied at Utrecht from 1689 until 1692. His thesis, <span class="italic">Exercitatio philosophica de homoeomeria anaxagorea</span> (1692), was dedicated to Mead. At Utrecht he studied under Hermann Witsius, Melchior Leydekker, Joannes Georgius Graevius, Johannes Leusden, Gerard de Vries, and Jan Luyts. The celebrated orientalist Adrian Reland, a fellow student, was a friend until his death in 1718. He then studied at Leiden, where he attended the lectures of Jacobus Perizonius and Gerard Noodt, but he also heard Jacobus Gronovius, Johannes Marck, and Friedrich Spanheim. He was later to correspond with a number of these professors.<br>
<br>On returning to England in 1695, Peirce lived with his relations in London for a while, before studying privately at the Bodleian Library, Oxford. On returning to London he was admitted a member of Mead's church (11 February 1697). For two years he preached the evening lecture at Miles Lane Congregational Church, where Matthew Clarke (1664&#150;1726) was minister. Avoiding denominational disputes, he became well regarded by the leading Presbyterian ministers in London. They persuaded him to become minister of the Green Street Meeting in Cambridge, a mixed congregation of Presbyterians and Independents, in succession to Thomas Taylor, who had died in November 1700. They themselves contributed &#145;liberally for my encouragement there&#146;  (Peirce, <span class="italic">Second Letter</span>, 31). He was ordained by four Presbyterian ministers, Matthew Sylvester, John Woodhouse, John Shower, and Christopher Taylor. He must still have ranked as an Independent, for he was made a trustee of the Hog Hill Meeting on 23 January 1702. At Cambridge his scholarship appears to have made him acceptable to members of the university, and he formed a close friendship with William Whiston, who thought him &#145;the most learned of all the dissenting teachers that I have known&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life and Writings</span>, 121). During this period he read and studied much, often sitting in his study from nine at night until four or five the following morning.<h2>
<a name="Advocacyofdissent"></a>Advocacy of dissent</h2>Peirce's removal to the major Presbyterian congregation at Toomer's Court, Newbury, Berkshire, probably coincided with the publication at the end of 1706 of his first major controversial work: his defence of the principles of dissent from the attack made by Edward Wells, rector of Cotesbach, Leicestershire, upon separation from the Church of England. Peirce's work <span class="italic">Remarks on Dr Wells his Letter to Mr Peter Dowley</span>, originally published anonymously, was well received by dissenters. Wells arranged for a copy of his reply to be sent to Peirce, &#145;for your Name and Abode, tho' Not Published by you in Print, yet is Sufficiently Published by your Friends and Acquaintance in Discourse&#146;  (Wells, 10). Peirce's <span class="italic">Remarks on Dr Wells his Letter</span>, in answer to the doctor's <span class="italic">Letter from a Minister of the Church of England to Mr Peter Dowley</span> (1706) and <span class="italic">Theses Against the Validity of Presbyterian Ordination</span> (1707), appeared in eight parts between 1706 and 1707 (3rd edn., 1711). Peirce's growing reputation among dissenters was enhanced by his <span class="italic">Some Considerations on the Sixth Chapter</span> (1708) in answer to Thomas Bennet's <span class="italic">An Abridgment of the London Cases</span> (1700) on the lawfulness of imposed ceremonies, in particular the use of the sign of the cross in baptism. Wells was provoked to publish an <span class="italic">Answer to Mr Peirce's Post-Script at the End of his Considerations of the Sixth Chapter</span> (1708). It was the publication of the <span class="italic">Vindicae fratrum dissentientium</span> (1710) in reply to William Nicholls's <span class="italic">Defensio ecclesiae Anglicanae</span> (1707) that brought Peirce into national prominence as a writer in defence of the principles of dissent. Both works were published in Latin with the intention of influencing foreign protestants. After Nicholls published an English translation, <span class="italic">A Defence of the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of England</span> (1715), Peirce translated his own work, with some major alterations, as <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Dissenters</span> (1718).<br>
<br>In 1713, &#145;without the least seeking on my part&#146;, Peirce was unanimously chosen as one of the ministers of James's Meeting, Exeter, in the place of George Trosse, who had died in January 1713  (Peirce, <span class="italic">Western Inquisition</span>, 10). Peirce had great difficulties with the invitation. His congregation at Newbury was very unwilling to release him, not least because they feared his removal would heighten the divisions among the dissenters in the town. Anxious to avoid any personal blame, Peirce resolved to accept the decision of others. Personally, he considered the state of his health to be the main factor, though he admitted that he had kept too many late hours studying. He also acknowledged that there were greater opportunities at Exeter. Although the Newbury congregation promised to subscribe for an assistant, he feared they would soon grow weary once the danger had passed. Nevertheless, in early March the Exeter dissenters believed that he had resolved to stay. They therefore appealed to the Exeter assembly of dissenting ministers in Devon and Cornwall for its support. Despite strong pleading by the Newbury congregation, the assembly, wishing to oblige the Exeter dissenters, eventually agreed to write to Peirce urging him to accept the invitation, for the sake of his health and because &#145;this post is of the utmost consequence to religion in these two counties&#146;  (Brockett, <span class="italic">Exeter Assembly</span>, 97). Dr Edmund Calamy, the nonconformist biographer and historian, witnessed the efforts of the Exeter dissenters to secure Peirce. &#145;Never before did I see such earnestness in any people for a minister's coming among them. They talked as if they were quite undone, if he did not accept their call. &hellip; They ran to such a height&#146; he could not help thinking that their &#145;peculiar eagerness and impetuosity &hellip; boded very ill&#146;  (Calamy, 2.263&#150;4).<br>
<br>At first Peirce found great acceptance and &#145;an extraordinary respect was paid him, &hellip; he was looked upon as the first man of the party&#146;  (&#145;Memoirs of himself&#146;, 329). He soon displayed his ability as a controversialist. After Benjamin Read, a ministerial candidate, conformed and was persuaded that his original baptism was invalid, Peirce derided his rebaptism in <span class="italic">A Caveat Against the New Sect of Anabaptists</span> (1714). At a time when dissent was under serious attack from high-churchmen, he published other works in defence of Presbyterian ordination. The controversy over the doctrine of the Trinity proved far more damaging to dissent. Peirce himself had held the orthodox position when he read William Whiston's <span class="italic">Essay on the Revelation of St John</span> (1706) in manuscript in 1706. On hearing of Whiston's change of views, he wrote to him from Newbury (10 July 1708) expressing amazement that he should &#145;fall in with the unitarians&#146;, and referring to the &#145;very melancholy instance&#146; of Thomas Emlyn, who had been imprisoned for his Unitarian views. Peirce was, however, persuaded to study the writings of the early fathers of the church, after which he found himself unable to resolve the conflicting arguments over the Trinity. The difficulties of the question impressed him greatly. As a result of his studies, Peirce came to &#145;despair of getting clear notions of the Trinity&#146; which &#145;render'd me more averse to the study of the controversy&#146;  (Peirce, <span class="italic">Western Inquisition</span>, 8). He therefore did not read Whiston's <span class="italic">Primitive Christianity Reviv'd</span> (1711&#150;12) and more importantly Samuel Clarke's <span class="italic">Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity</span> (1712) until 1713, moved by Whiston's importuning. He came to realize that the theology in which he had been bred was really Sabellian. Nevertheless, he became convinced that error on this question was not fundamental, and that &#145;the safest way&#146; was to keep closely to scripture. He had therefore already dropped the common form of the doxology before going to Exeter. Whiston claimed him as a Unitarian, but while he held (with Clarke) that the Son was subordinate, he denied holding Arian beliefs. His interpretation of scripture was critical to a fault rather than positively heterodox.<h2>
<a name="Controversyoverdoctrine"></a>Controversy over doctrine</h2>The controversy which blasted Peirce's reputation and destroyed the doctrinal accord of Old Dissent began in November 1716, when the Arian opinions of a small group of younger ministers became public as a result of the indiscretion of Hubert Stogdon, who expressed his opinions freely in private conversation with the orthodox John Lavington. Lavington, Peirce's young colleague at Exeter, chose to publish the conversation, &#145;and the town presently rang of it&#146;. On 17 May 1717 Henry Atkins of Puddington, when giving the lecture at James's Meeting for Peirce, who was in London, chose to preach on the Trinity, and thus brought the controversy into the open. According to Peirce, Atkins accused some of his hearers of &#145;damnable heresies&#146;. Greatly offended, Peirce tried to persuade his colleagues to have Atkins excluded from their pulpit, but they refused. By request Peirce preached on 2 June on the atonement, but his attempts by scholarly means to reconcile the new teaching with orthodoxy failed to prevent the growing divisions. About a week later John Ball, the minister at Honiton, met Peirce and told him forcefully that &#145;people charg'd all the business upon me&#146; and that he had the power to prevent Stogdon from spreading his opinions. Peirce denied that anyone had been &#145;influenc'd by me to alter his opinion about the Trinity&#146;  (Peirce, <span class="italic">Western Inquisition</span>, 13, 30&#150;31).<br>
<br>Fearful of divisions at the next Exeter assembly, Peirce joined with Joseph Hallett (1656&#150;1722) and John Withers on 15 July in giving Stogdon a testimonial as to his conversation and behaviour (but nothing about his opinions), and at the assembly in September he piloted John Fox, another of the younger heterodox ministers, through his examination for a licence to preach, refusing to require any &#145;explications&#146; of doctrinal terms. The period of comparative calm which followed Stogdon's removal to Somerset ended as a result of Peirce's Christmas-week lecture which renewed doubts about his doctrinal soundness. In January 1718 the Committee of Thirteen, a body of thirteen lay trustees who managed the affairs of the Exeter dissenters, asked each of the four ministers to preach &#145;in defence of the eternal deity of Jesus Christ&#146;. Peirce complied, and &#145;matters so much cooled&#146; that the controversy was not mentioned at the May assembly. Lavington assured Peirce &#145;that we were now quiet&#146;  (Peirce, <span class="italic">Western Inquisition</span>, 65, 67&#150;8). From early July Peirce was absent for six Sundays in London as was his custom, but on his return he found the controversy had been renewed.<br>
<br>Alarmed at news of Stogdon's ordination and the apparent falling away of the younger ministers from orthodoxy, John Walrond wrote to William Tong, one of the leading London ministers, who called an informal meeting of Presbyterian and Independent ministers on 25 August. Their advice was not to suspect anyone without good reason, but to warn the people against any minister who should be in error. Walrond announced his determination to call for a declaration of faith concerning the Trinity at the assembly to clear the ministers of the suspicion of Arianism. Attempts were made to avoid open disputes, and Peirce and Withers accepted Walrond's invitation to meet at his house with John Ball, but many country ministers were far less charitable. On the second day of the assembly, Ball proposed that the ministers present made a declaration on the Trinity. After a debate, where feelings ran high and which the moderator had difficulty controlling, a vote decided in favour of the declaration. There was further debate over the form of words. Hallett declared his beliefs in scriptural terms, Withers was scrupulously orthodox but refused the suggested form of words, but Peirce for the first time openly declared his belief in the subordination of Christ. Both sides issued a series of pamphlets. In November the Committee of Thirteen, though they had no authority to demand it, sought assurances from the four Exeter ministers on the disputed doctrine, but received satisfaction only from Lavington; Peirce expressly declared for the subordination of Christ. The committee wrote to the London ministers on 22 November seeking advice, but the latter were reluctant to become involved in so difficult an issue and delayed their answer until 6 January 1719, when they declined to &#145;interpose&#146;, advising the committee to consult with local ministers. Seven ministers in the neighbourhood, including Ball and Walrond, were invited to give advice, and they met in Exeter on 19 January, and the following day visited Peirce, Hallett, and Withers. The seven ministers agreed a resolution that there were errors of doctrine and congregations should withdraw from ministers who held them, but desired a fortnight in which to consult ministers in London, Devon, and Somerset. Peirce had in the meantime written to his friends in London, including John Shute Barrington, a fellow student at Leiden, who was managing the parliamentary campaign for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity and Schism acts</span>. Because the dispute at Exeter was being used by opponents of repeal, Barrington sought to compose the differences and advised the Committee of Three Denominations (of Presbyterians, Independents, and Baptists) that any doctrinal test should be scriptural only. The three denominations decided to consult the London ministers, which by opening the dispute to public debate destroyed the doctrinal accord of Old Dissent. The London ministers met at Salters' Hall on 19 and 20 February and 3 March, and divided almost equally, one advising subscription to the Trinity, the other against subscription on principle.<h2>
<a name="Ejection"></a>Ejection</h2>In both cases the advice arrived too late to influence the outcome in Exeter. After waiting four weeks, the seven ministers met again on 4 March and sent their original resolution to the Committee of Thirteen. On 5 March the committee asked the Exeter ministers to subscribe to the Trinity. Peirce and Hallett refused. Withers's initial declaration was not accepted, but he subsequently subscribed and escaped ejection. Without giving notice, the trustees of James's Meeting locked the doors against Peirce on 6 March. A few days later the trustees of the three meeting-houses met and decided to close them to Peirce and Hallett. On the Sunday following his ejection, Peirce preached in a private house to an estimated 300 people on &#145;the evil and cure of divisions&#146;, which was later published. The following year his supporters built the Mint Meeting, appointing Hallett joint minister with him. In May 1719 the Exeter assembly called for a subscription from its members. Peirce with eighteen others declined and seceded, issuing a paper on 6 May denying the charge of Arianism and making a confession in scriptural terms.<br>
<br>According to Fox, Peirce never rose above the mortification inflicted upon him by his summary ejection, and he wrote numerous pamphlets in self-justification. Influential friends, such as Peter King, stood by him, but he felt deeply the loss of leadership. He moved to a country house at St Leonard's parish, in the suburbs of Exeter. The last four years of his life were the time of &#145;his greatest Usefulness&#146; employed in the study of scriptures  (Hallett, <span class="italic">Sermon</span>, 18). His paraphrases and notes on the epistles to the <span class="roman">Colossians</span> and <span class="roman">Philippians</span> after the manner of John Locke were published in 1725, and on that to the <span class="roman">Hebrews</span>&#151;after Joseph (III) Hallett (1691&#150;1744) had completed the final three chapters&#151;in 1727 following his death. The latter was published in Latin in 1747 by J. D. Michaelis, the German biblical critic, who regarded Peirce's scholarship highly.<h2>
<a name="Death"></a>Death</h2>After a period of illness Peirce broke a blood-vessel in his lungs, lingered a few days in great composure, and died in St Leonard's parish, Exeter, on 10 March 1726. In his will he attested to his belief in &#145;one God, the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ&#146; and declared that &#145;my Conscience reproaches me not for the part I have acted in the Controversy concerning the Trinity&#146;  (Hallett, <span class="italic">Sermon</span>, 17). He was buried in the churchyard of St Leonard's. Benjamin Avery published a long Latin inscription which was intended for Peirce's tombstone. The cutting of it was nearly finished when the rector, Richard Gay, intervened with a prohibition. Gay also objected to an alternative, &#145;Here lies the reverend, learned and pious Mr James Peirce&#146;: Peirce could not be reverend since he was not lawfully ordained, nor pious because he taught errors. The eventual inscription was &#145;Mr James Peirce's Tomb, 1726&#146;. His funeral sermon was preached by Joseph (III) Hallett, who had followed his father as Peirce's colleague. Thomas Emlyn was invited to succeed him, but refused. Peirce seems to have been a reserved man with the manners of a gentleman, yet humorous and even jocose with friends. His preaching was scholarly rather than inspired. Yet &#145;he was, without doubt, a man of great parts and learning, and as such, made a much greater figure among the Dissenters than any among them for many years before him&#146;  (&#145;Memoirs of himself&#146;, 329).<br>
