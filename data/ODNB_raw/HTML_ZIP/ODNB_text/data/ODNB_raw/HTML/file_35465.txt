<span class="headword">Penley,  William Sydney</span>  (1852&#150;1912), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, born at St Peter's, Ramsgate, on 19 November 1852, was the only son of William George Robinson Penley, a schoolmaster, and his first wife, Emily Ann Wooton, the widow of Walter Pilcher. His great-uncle was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21846/', "Aaron Edwin Penley")</script>, watercolour painter to William IV. The family had old theatrical associations: his great-grandfather William (1773&#150;1838) had been a comedian at Drury Lane; the elder William's nephews included Sampson (1792&#150;1838) and Thomas Turpin Belville (1805&#150;1893), respectively actor&#150;manager at the Theatre Royal, Windsor, and theatre manager in Bath. Penley attended his father's school, Grove House Academy, initially at St Peter's, and later at Charles Street, Westminster, when his father moved there. In his youth he sang as a chorister at the Chapel Royal, St James's, Westminster Abbey, Bedford Chapel, Bloomsbury, and finally the Russian embassy chapel. After an apprenticeship with a City firm of milliners and fancy-goods manufacturers, he joined the staff of Copestake, Moore, Crampton &amp; Co.<br>
<br>Through the introduction of William Terriss, Penley obtained an engagement at the old Court Theatre under the management of Marie Litton, and made his d&eacute;but on 26 December 1871 as Tim in the farce <span class="italic">My Wife's Second Floor</span> by John Maddison Morton. The following October he played in T. F. Plowman's <span class="italic">Zampa</span>, and later performed at the Holborn Theatre in <span class="italic">Doctor Faust</span>. In 1875 he appeared at the Royalty Theatre in his first successful role, as the Foreman in <span class="italic">Trial by Jury</span> by W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan. After touring in comic opera, he returned to London to appear at the Strand Theatre (October 1876) in the comic opera <span class="italic">Princess Toto</span> by W. S. Gilbert and Alfred Cellier. He remained at the Strand Theatre for three years under the management of Ada Swanborough, and appeared principally in burlesque. On 22 March 1879 Penley married Mary Ann, the daughter of James Ricketts, a cattle salesman; they had three sons and three daughters. In April 1879 he transferred to the Royalty, and later that year he toured the provinces as Sir Joseph Porter in Gilbert and Sullivan's <span class="italic">HMS Pinafore</span>. In March 1880 he appeared at the Gaiety as Popperton in <span class="italic">La voyage en Suisse</span> with the Hanlon-Lees, a well-known troupe of pantomimists, and accompanied them to the United States. He reappeared in London at the Globe Theatre (July 1882) in <span class="italic">The Vicar of Bray</span>, and at the Comedy Theatre (September 1882) in Robert Planquette's <span class="italic">Rip Van Winkle</span>.<br>
<br>Penley made the first notable advance in his profession when he appeared as Lay Brother Pelican in Chassaigne's <span class="italic">Falka</span> at the Comedy (October 1883), an exceedingly droll performance. A greater opportunity followed when he was chosen by Charles Hawtrey to succeed Herbert Beerbohm Tree in the title role of the Revd Robert Spalding in <span class="italic">The Private Secretary</span> when that play was transferred to the Globe Theatre in May 1884: he played this part for two years and firmly established his reputation. Penley remained with Hawtrey for some years at the Globe, at the Comedy, and at the Strand, appearing in many plays of varied merit. After this long engagement with Hawtrey had terminated he was seen at Terry's Theatre (1890) in Jerome K. Jerome's <span class="italic">New Lamps for Old</span> and Arthur Law's <span class="italic">The Judge</span>; the following January at Toole's Theatre in Henry Hamilton's <span class="italic">Our Regiment</span>, and later at the Savoy Theatre in the comic opera <span class="italic">The Nautch Girl</span>. In 1891 he returned to the Comedy Theatre for a short time.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Charley's Aunt</span> by Brandon Thomas&#151;the famous farce first produced at the Royalty Theatre on 21 December 1892&#151;Penley's remarkable impersonation of the part of Lord Fancourt Babberley became the talk of the town. The play, transferred to the Globe Theatre early in 1893, settled down to a record-breaking run for a farce, and was played continuously over a period of four years in 1466 consecutive performances. In 1898 Penley produced <span class="italic">A Little Ray of Sunshine</span>, by Mark Ambient and Wilton Heriot, first in the provinces and later at the Royalty Theatre (December 1898). He then acquired the lease of the Novelty Theatre, which he renamed the Great Queen Street Theatre, and opened on 24 May 1900 with the same play. At this house he also revived <span class="italic">The Private Secretary</span> and <span class="italic">Charley's Aunt</span>, but without much success, and his acting career ended with the run of the last-mentioned play in 1901. He retired to Woking, then to Farnham and St Leonards where he lived a quiet country life until his death, at 7 Grand Parade, St Leonards, on 11 November 1912. His funeral took place on the 13th, at the Hastings borough cemetery. Most of the large fortune which he had made from the success of <span class="italic">Charley's Aunt</span> was believed to have been lost in his later years, but he left more than &pound;15,000 on his death.<br>
<br>Penley's face was his fortune. He had a great sense of humour; but it was the expression of his countenance and the dry, metallic quality of his voice which had such irresistible effect on his audience. He was keenly interested in charitable institutions, was an active churchman, one of the proprietors of the <span class="italic">Church Family Newspaper</span>, and also a prominent freemason. He was the author of <span class="italic">Penley on himself</span>, published in 1884.<br>
