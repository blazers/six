<span class="headword">Vaus,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1484&#150;<em>c.</em>1539), <span class="occ">grammarian</span>, came of a well-established family in the city and diocese of Aberdeen, where a number of its members served as aldermen, councillors, and priests throughout the fifteenth century. It is not known, however, whether John Vaus was born in Aberdeen; records in the Vatican archives merely state that he was the son of a priest and an unmarried woman, that Pope Alexander VI had dispensed him from his illegitimacy on 23 June 1503 in order to allow him to proceed to the priesthood and be beneficed, and that on 14 June 1504 Julius II had confirmed him as vicar of Alness in the diocese of Ross while he was still a student at the University of Aberdeen. From these facts and the later statements of Hector Boece, it is possible to argue that he was born about 1484, attended the cathedral grammar school in Old Aberdeen under his kinsman Alexander Vaus, and was a student in the arts faculty at the university under Hector Boece between 1500 and 1504 before the foundation of King's College in 1505. It would also appear that when Boece was appointed principal of that college in 1505, he sent Vaus for further studies in Paris, where the latter graduated MA in 1505.<br>
<br>The date at which Vaus returned to take up his appointment as the grammarian employed to teach Latin at Aberdeen University (one of the earliest recorded) is not known, but during his first stay in Paris he is known to have made the acquaintance of such publishers as Josse Bade of the Ascensius Press and to have purchased a number of works on Latin grammar. He is known to have visited Paris again in 1523 to oversee the publication of his commentary on the first part of the <span class="italic">Doctrinale</span> of Alexander de Villa Dei, along with the printing of his translation into Scots of the <span class="italic">Ars minor</span> of Aelius Donatus, and with that of his own <span class="italic">Rudimenta puerorum in artem grammaticam</span>, a textbook which was still being reprinted, with changes and additions, at the Ascensius Press in 1553. Indeed, a study of the twenty-eight incunables in Aberdeen University Library which Vaus once possessed shows him to have been familiar with a wide range of textbooks on Latin grammar and on the principles governing the language and its literature; taken together with the warm tributes paid to his teaching ability by Hector Boece and his own students, they reveal him to have been both an industrious and elegant master of his subject, and to have given a flying start to the university's early development in humanist studies. In 1520, during his period of office as grammarian, Vaus is also noted as being chaplain of the Holy Name of Jesus altar at St Nicholas parish church in Aberdeen, and he is likewise recorded as having gifted an image of the crucified Christ to hang above the organ loft on the rood screen in King's College chapel. The date of his death is unknown, but his successor, Theophilus Stewart, is named as the university grammarian in a document dated 12 April 1539, while another university record confirms Vaus as being deceased in 1542.<br>
