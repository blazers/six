<span class="headword">Atterbury,  Francis</span>  (1663&#150;1732), <span class="occ">bishop of Rochester, politician, and Jacobite conspirator</span>, was born on 6 March 1663 at Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/872/', "Lewis Atterbury (1630/31&#150;1693)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/873/', "Atterbury, Lewis (1656&#150;1731)")</script>], then rector of Milton Keynes, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Giffard (<i>d</i>. 1668).<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>After early education at home Atterbury was chosen in 1674 as a king's scholar at Westminster School, then at the height of its reputation under the headmastership of Richard Busby. Atterbury's intelligence and ready wit made him a favourite of Busby, and in 1680 he passed to Christ Church, Oxford, at the head of that year's intake of Westminsters, matriculating on 17 December that year. At Christ Church, which was in size and influence the greatest college in the university, Atterbury and his fellow Westminsters formed an intellectual &eacute;lite. His mentor now was the high tory subdean, Henry Aldrich, who encouraged his literary talent. In 1682 Atterbury published a Latin translation of John Dryden's <span class="italic">Absalom and Achitophel</span>, and two years later a small anthology of Latin verse. In 1684 he graduated BA, and began to take pupils of his own. Presumably under Aldrich's guidance, he contributed to the counter-offensive undertaken by Anglican polemicists at Oxford against the Catholic party in the university. His <span class="italic">Answer to some Considerations on the Spirit of Martin Luther</span> (1687) was an effective rebuttal of anti-Lutheran tracts issued by the press controlled by the Catholic master of University College, Obadiah Walker. Although Atterbury was careful not to endorse everything in Lutheran doctrine, he vigorously defended Luther's own character, and won admiration far beyond the university. In Oxford itself his reputation was such that he was entrusted in the summer of 1688 with composing verses in honour of the visiting Princess Anne. Aldrich's promotion to the deanery of Christ Church at the revolution of 1688 secured his prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s position within the college: more pupils now came Atterbury's way, among them Charles Boyle, later fourth earl of Orrery, whose education became his particular care. But he found the limitations of college life frustrating, and became fractious, confiding to his father in October 1690 that<blockquote>I'm perfectly weary with this nauseous circle of small affairs, that can neither divert nor instruct me. I was made, I am sure, for another scene and another sort of conversation, though it has been my hard luck to be pinned down to this. I have thought and thought again, Sir, and for some years: now I have never been able to think otherwise, than that I am losing time every minute I stay here. (<span class="italic">Epistolary Correspondence</span>, <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works</span>, 1.15&#150;16)</blockquote>Atterbury had been ordained in 1687, the year that he graduated MA, and in October 1691 he took the first step on the ladder of ecclesiastical preferment when Henry Compton, bishop of London, recommended him to the vestry of St Bride's, Fleet Street, as a lecturer. His performances in the pulpit soon brought him notice, and on Restoration Day (29 May) 1692 he preached before Queen Mary II in the Chapel Royal, his sermon being subsequently printed. In October 1693 he was elected minister of the Bridewell and Bethlem hospitals, and appointed chaplain-in-ordinary to the king and queen. Financially secure, he resigned his studentship at Christ Church and moved to London, marrying in 1695 Catherine Osborne (<i>d</i>. 1722), herself the daughter of a country parson, who brought him domestic security and great personal happiness. They rented a house in Chelsea, where Atterbury's three children (two daughters and a son, the latter, Osborne, destined to be a huge disappointment to his father) were born between 1698 and 1701.<h2>
<a name="Ecclesiasticalpolitics"></a>Ecclesiastical politics</h2>Atterbury was a clear and forceful preacher, whose straightforward and doctrinally conservative sermons were popular with his congregations, as they emphasized the reality of sin and salvation through grace, in contrast to what he termed the &#145;very easy and comfortable divinity&#146;  (Bennett, <span class="italic">Tory Crisis</span>, 37) of low-church ecclesiastics. But it was to be through his writing that he attained national celebrity. His style and wit, of which glimpses could be seen in his earlier productions, were displayed in full view in the pamphlet he &#145;ghosted&#146; for his former pupil Boyle, <span class="italic">Dr Bentley's Dissertation on the Epistles of Phalaris Examined</span> (1698), and its successor, <span class="italic">A Short View of the Controversy &hellip;</span> (1701), both of which were written to extricate Boyle from a scholarly dispute with the formidable and destructive Richard Bentley over a spurious classical text, the &#145;epistles&#146; of &#145;Phalaris&#146;, that Boyle had edited and Bentley had denounced. Although Bentley was clearly in the right, Atterbury's meretricious arguments muddied the waters sufficiently to deceive many contemporaries. More significant, however, was the <span class="italic">Letter to a Convocation Man</span> of 1696, which, by setting out the case for the right of the convocation of the Church of England to meet alongside parliament, set in train the so-called &#145;convocation controversy&#146;, and launched not only the high-church agitation for ecclesiastical reform, but Atterbury's own career in ecclesiastical politics. The pamphlet was published anonymously, and although some suspected Atterbury as the author, none could be sure. Its effect was sensational, and Thomas Tenison, archbishop of Canterbury, alarmed at the political implications of any popular pressure for the recall of convocation, encouraged William Wake, himself a future archbishop, to publish a response. Wake's scholarship exposed a fundamental flaw in Atterbury's case&#151;the historical discontinuity between the medieval convocations summoned alongside parliament and the modern provincial convocations, which were of a different, non-parliamentary, order&#151;but this crucial point was lost in the furore aroused by the near-Erastianism of some of Wake's other arguments, that since Roman times Christian rulers had possessed absolute control over church synods. To many readers Wake seemed to be advocating the total subordination of church to state. Provoked by the rough treatment his own efforts had received at the hands of his antagonist, Atterbury determined to hit back. He prepared the ground carefully, reading up on the materials of English parliamentary history in the library of Lincoln's Inn, access to which was granted through the good offices of his friend Francis Gastrell, reader in the chapel. After two years' endeavour he was able to publish, again anonymously, <span class="italic">The Rights, Powers, and Privileges of an English Convocation</span> (1700), which purported to answer Wake point by point. In reality, there was much legerdemain in Atterbury's exposition, but weaknesses were hidden by the brilliance of his style. His own observation, excusing his &#145;barbarous&#146; treatment of Wake on the grounds that such personal vituperation was necessary &#145;to inspirit a dull and dry subject&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Diaries of William Nicolson</span>, 458), hints at his impatience with the demands of scholarship. He also benefited from the fact that his trenchant demands for constitutional rights struck a chord with his audience, both clerical and lay. The work was a great popular success, and helped to persuade leading tories like Laurence Hyde, first earl of Rochester, to insist on the recall of convocation as part of their price for joining the ministry at the end of 1700. This time Atterbury's authorship was an open secret, and he soon abandoned any pretence of anonymity. When a second, enlarged edition appeared the following year, his name was attached. With typical effrontery he added (without permission) a dedication to Archbishop Tenison. As with the Phalaris controversy, Atterbury's journalistic flair had secured him an undeserved short-term victory. Wake, like Bentley, eventually produced a comprehensive rebuttal, but by the time he brought this work to the press, in 1703, it had been overtaken by events.<br>
<br>Atterbury was now the acknowledged champion of the high-church cause, not least because his own brand of high-churchmanship was practical (and it must be said, political), rather than theological. His concerns were to recover the influence of the established church in English society, the status of the clerical order, and also the incomes of the lower clergy, not to advance high-flying doctrines. Although he extolled &#145;the re-establishment of the beauty and praise in our sanctuary&#146; brought about at the Restoration  (Atterbury, <span class="italic">Sermons</span>, 33), he also spoke in the pulpit of the salvation of the &#145;elect&#146; and reiterated standard denunciations of &#145;popish&#146; superstitions, which presumably indicates an orthodox Calvinist theology of salvation. As the meeting of convocation approached, he busied himself in mobilizing clerical opinion, but he did not have to stand for election himself, since his friend Sir Jonathan Trelawny, bt, bishop of Exeter, was able to advance him to the vacant archdeaconry of Exeter and thus an <i>ex officio</i> seat. To his chagrin, Atterbury found that he was considered too brash and unreliable to be entirely trusted by the new ministry. He was not consulted by Rochester before the meeting of convocation and was bypassed in the election for prolocutor of the lower house in favour of George Hooper, dean of Canterbury. But he was not easily cowed, and set out to undermine Hooper by urging the lower house to extreme measures in defiance of the prolocutor's caution. His particular target was Gilbert Burnet, bishop of Salisbury, whose commentary on the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> was denounced as heresy. The central issue, however, was the wording of the loyal address, which embroiled the lower house in a conflict with the bishops. Hooper was made to appear hopelessly weak in comparison to Atterbury, the <i>de facto</i> leader of the lower clergy. In a pointed gesture the lower house proposed a vote of thanks to Atterbury for his pains in asserting the rights of convocation, and sent a letter to Oxford proposing that he be awarded the degree of DD by diploma, which sympathetic high-churchmen in the university were more than willing to grant.<br>
<br>Atterbury's resentment against Rochester propelled him into the company of a group of younger tory politicians, including Oxford figures like the lawyer and future lord chancellor Simon Harcourt. The most important member of this circle was the speaker of the House of Commons, Robert Harley, a politician of legendary deviousness, whose career became intertwined with Atterbury's. Atterbury became Harley's chief ally among the clergy, a clerical equivalent of the bright young tory MPs whom Harley was gathering around him in order to supplant the older tory chieftains like Rochester and Daniel Finch, second earl of Nottingham. But while Harley's parliamentary faction was cultivating moderation in its politics, Atterbury's party in the church took a consistently radical line. Atterbury shouldered much of the weight of the high-church cause himself, publishing at least nine pamphlets in 1701&#150;2 against such powerful low-church antagonists as Edmund Gibson and White Kennett. He also organized, directed, and led the high-churchmen in the lower house of convocation. The elections of November and December had returned a clear high-church majority, but the short session which accompanied the last parliament of William III in the early months of 1702 proved deeply disappointing. Hooper and his allies had been so alienated by Atterbury's behaviour that they absented themselves from proceedings, and Atterbury had barely enough supporters to overcome the determined efforts of Kennett and other low-churchmen. Then, by refusing to sanction the election of a new prolocutor to replace the deceased Robert Woodward, Archbishop Tenison effectively suspended the sitting. Atterbury gave vent to his frustrations in a series of published attacks on Tenison, culminating in the anonymous <span class="italic">The Parliamentary Original and Rights of the Lower House of Convocation</span> (1702), which portrayed the archbishop as the clerical instrument of a political faction, the whig junto, bent on the destruction of the church.<br>
<br>By this time Queen Anne had succeeded to the throne and the political scene had been transformed with the appointment of a tory ministry. Tenison was sufficiently alarmed at the vehemence of Atterbury's attacks to approach Lord Treasurer Godolphin, who in turn passed the matter over to Harley, his trusted lieutenant in the Commons. This was Harley's chance. He concluded a secret agreement with Atterbury for the settlement of the crisis in the church: the queen was to declare her sympathy for the high-church cause; Tenison was to be persuaded into concessions; the constitutional disputes would be resolved, and convocation would proceed with its work of reforming and reviving the church. The immediate fruit of this agreement was a <i>rapprochement</i> between Atterbury and Hooper, engineered by Harley, and high-church unity behind the election of Henry Aldrich as prolocutor. But the promised concessions from the archbishop were not forthcoming, and Atterbury found himself outmanoeuvred by his old college tutor in convocation. Hooper, of all people, usurped his place as the ministry's chief adviser among the lower clergy; and to make matters worse, the Harleyites showed their moderate side and opposed the <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity Bill</span> in parliament.<br>
<br>Furious that he had been duped by his friends, Atterbury broke with Harley in the summer of 1703 and threw his weight behind the high-church campaign in the following parliamentary session in support of the reintroduced <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity Bill</span>. When it, too, was rejected, he took the battle into convocation, and in January 1704 persuaded the lower house to agree on two controversial documents: a &#145;representation&#146; of the grievances of the clergy, laying the blame for the ills of the church squarely on the bishops; and a &#145;protestation of right&#146;, embodying Atterbury's own doctrines on the rights and powers of convocation. The formal delivery of these offensive documents to the upper house was followed by a message of thanks to all MPs who had voted for the <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity Bill</span>. A triumphant session for Atterbury was crowned when he preached by invitation before the Commons.<h2>
<a name="DeanofCarlisle"></a>Dean of Carlisle</h2>Atterbury's star was very much in the ascendant, and a by-product of the ministerial reconstruction that followed the parliamentary session was his promotion. Harley, now secretary of state, saw the necessity of a reliable clerical lieutenant and fixed on Atterbury, who in June 1704 was advanced to the deanery of Carlisle. However, this was to prove in many respects an unwise step for Atterbury. It was a poorly endowed preferment, even if presented as a token of greater rewards to come; and his acceptance placed him in a difficult position, where he was distrusted by both political parties: by the whigs as a firebrand, by many tories as a turncoat, and altogether too dependent on Harley personally. Moreover, he did not get on with his bishop, the redoubtable whig William Nicolson, with whom he clashed repeatedly. Their quarrels culminated in 1707 in an unprecedented decision by Nicolson to include the cathedral in his episcopal visitation. In response Atterbury petitioned the queen, and the dispute, which as usual with Atterbury was pursued in the press as well as through official channels, was only resolved in 1708 when whigs in parliament pushed through a bill to validate Nicolson's actions. In convocation Atterbury, bridled by his preferment, could only stand by as Tenison carried all before him, although in the autumn of 1705 even he rebelled at an attempt by Tenison to force the lower house to concur in the bishops' draft of a loyal address, and was unusually vociferous in his protests. In doing so, however, he led the high-churchmen straight into a whig trap, and shared the mortification of the entire lower house when they were publicly rebuked by royal letter. In the following session he was able to exercise more restraint, and did what he could to moderate the protestation of the lower house at being prorogued during the passage through parliament of the Anglo-Scottish Union. Even so, the clergy's carefully worded &#145;application&#146; incurred another formal rebuke by royal letter in April 1707. This was all too much for Atterbury, and he relieved his frustrations with a short anonymous pamphlet putting the clergy's case, <span class="italic">An Account and Defence of the Protestation</span> (1707).<br>
<br>The possibility of relief from Atterbury's embarrassments and frustrations came with the political crisis in the winter of 1707&#150;8, as Harley sought to persuade the queen to reconstruct her administration in such a way as to exclude the increasingly influential whig junto, and instead rely upon a coalition of moderates of both parties. Atterbury saw a role for himself as the new ministry's ecclesiastical lieutenant, and it has been suggested that the edition of his collected sermons, which he published at this time, was contrived to read as a manifesto of a new ministerial order. The preface declared the queen ready to embrace a high-church programme of ecclesiastical reform. As Atterbury told Harley, this would be &#145;likely to arouse the clergy, with whom it is necessary to establish a confidence, in order to the promoting any public service&#146;  (Bennett, <span class="italic">Tory Crisis</span>, 93). After such hopes, the failure of Harley's schemes must have been a bitter disappointment, but his patron's dismissal from office in February 1708, and the consequent reuniting of tories in church and state, did at least clarify Atterbury's position with his own party. He abandoned his previous restraint, and went into print with a vigorous denunciation of the primate's behaviour towards the lower house of convocation, <span class="italic">Some Proceedings in Convocation, <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 1705</span> (1708), and the general expectation that he would be chosen prolocutor when the new convocation assembled was only dashed when the whig ministry decided at the last minute to prorogue convocation rather than risk his election. A renewed self-confidence was also apparent in Atterbury's willingness to refute publicly the uncompromisingly whig constitutional doctrines espoused by his fellow clergyman Benjamin Hoadly. Atterbury had been stung by gratuitous criticism by Hoadly of some slapdash theology in one of his own hastily published funeral sermons, and determined to have his revenge. He used the occasion of a public sermon in September 1708, on the installation of a new lord mayor of London, to reiterate the providentialist version of &#145;Revolution principles&#146; he had first enunciated in a sermon before the House of Commons in 1701. The City of London corporation was outraged, and refused either to thank him or to request the printing of the sermon. Undaunted, he preached it again before a clerical audience, and put it into print afterwards. Hoadly's eventual response, in 1710, received the public gratitude of the whig-dominated House of Commons, much to Atterbury's disgust, but by this time the impeachment of Dr Henry Sacheverell was under way, and Atterbury's earlier sermon had been embroiled in the surrounding controversy. Though not by any means as extreme or intemperate as Sacheverell in his attitude to the Revolution, Atterbury naturally came to the aid of a fellow high-churchman in distress, and is said to have played a part in helping to prepare the doctor's speech in his own defence to the House of Lords.<br>
<br>The ministerial revolution of 1710, which brought Robert Harley to power, seemed at first to open a vista of opportunities. Atterbury belonged in the charmed circle of Harley's friends and associates, and helped the new ministry's propaganda efforts by contributing one or two numbers to the fledgeling <span class="italic">Examiner</span>. But Harley's slowness in ordering major changes exasperated the hotter tories and in September 1710 Atterbury was sent as an emissary to represent their concerns to him. He received an unexpectedly brusque answer and, allegedly, a coolness entered permanently into the relations between the two men. The consequences were not immediately apparent, however. Harley recommended Atterbury in December 1710 to succeed Aldrich as dean of Christ Church, though for the time being nothing was done. Then, when Atterbury was elected prolocutor of the lower house of convocation and sought at last to inaugurate the comprehensive scheme for church reform that had been envisaged when convocation had been recalled in 1700, Harley supplied the necessary preliminaries. Unfortunately for Atterbury, the determined opposition of low-churchmen in both houses, and the extremism of his own supporters, frustrated his grand designs, and very little of the anticipated programme was carried through. The <span class="roman">Fifty New Churches Act</span>, passed by parliament on convocation's initiative, was in the long run the most impressive achievement. But the session of 1711 was best-known for the production of the &#145;Representation of the present state of religion&#146;, a work largely of Atterbury's draftsmanship which embodied the full range of high-church grievances, ecclesiastical and political, but which was never formally presented to Queen Anne. The house of bishops offered their own anodyne version instead, and, no compromise being possible, the matter was dropped when convocation was prorogued. Although the lower house's &#145;Representation&#146; was published, it had no official status.<br>
<br>Atterbury thus had reason to share the dissatisfaction of tory back-benchers in parliament in the summer of 1711. His own frustrations were made worse by the slow progress of the Christ Church appointment. At this point he seems to have aligned himself with the secretary of state, Henry St John, fast emerging as Harley's rival within the ministry. In September 1711, at long last, Atterbury was declared dean of Christ Church. His stint at the head of his old college, like so much else in his career, proved disappointing. Within the governing body his determination to reform, enshrined in a permanently overbearing manner, naturally made him enemies. Within the university at large he also entertained grand ambitions, namely to break the stranglehold of a ruling clique of minor college heads, and create a new ascendancy based on Christ Church and Magdalen (where Sacheverell was his ally), naturally enough under his own leadership. Behind this scheme was the figure of Lord Keeper Harcourt, whose own ambitions to establish a controlling political interest in the university constituency Atterbury was keen to serve. None of these ambitions was satisfied. Atterbury failed to reform his college, relations with the fellows breaking down spectacularly, and he failed to take over university politics and reconstruct the tory interest under Harcourt's protection. Meanwhile, the factionalism in convocation was going from bad to worse, and much of Atterbury's time as prolocutor was taken up with trying to restrain the extravagances of the extremists on his own side, whose high-flying theology could be interpreted as tending towards Jacobitism.<h2>
<a name="BishopofRochester"></a>Bishop of Rochester</h2>The political crisis that engulfed the ministry in the summer of 1713 gave Atterbury, as he saw it, an opportunity to break free from the shackles of an unsupportive government. Along with Harcourt, he &#145;fell into a strict alliance&#146; with St John (now Viscount Bolingbroke), &#145;and endeavoured to raise a great prejudice in the Church party against the treasurer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 5.660), otherwise Harley, now earl of Oxford. Atterbury's part in this intrigue was to devise a project which could unite high-churchmen, and he found it in a parliamentary bill to reinvigorate the ecclesiastical courts. Atterbury drafted the bill and sought, without success, to interest Lord Nottingham in its passage. This scheme was soon overtaken by the more serious crisis over the French commerce treaty, but Atterbury was sufficiently at the heart of things to be offered the bishopric of Rochester, which became vacant in June 1713. While the income from the bishopric was nugatory, its incumbent also held the more lucrative and prestigious deanery of Westminster. Atterbury leapt at the opportunity, his own pleasure being matched, it must be said, by that of the Christ Church chapter, and on 7 July he took his seat in the House of Lords.<br>
<br>For Bolingbroke and Harcourt this was a Pyrrhic victory, as in the autumn of 1713 Oxford launched into a broader political reconstruction that temporarily restored his political supremacy. But his grip was failing, as was the queen's health. In the final months of Anne's reign, with the ministry bitterly divided and the tory party pulling itself apart into Jacobite and Hanoverian factions, Atterbury remained close to Bolingbroke. It was he who devised the <span class="roman">Schism Bill</span>, designed to suppress nonconformist academies, as another expedient to unite the tories. In July 1714 it was said once again that he had formed, with Bolingbroke and Harcourt, a &#145;scheme, to out the Treasurer&#146;  (Bennett, <span class="italic">Tory Crisis</span>, 179). This does not seem to have extended to bringing in the queen's half-brother, James Francis Edward Stuart, the Pretender&#151;indeed, after the queen's death, Atterbury was a member of the Lords committee that drew up an address of congratulation to King George I&#151;but contemporary gossip, and worse still, opinion at the Hanoverian court, thought otherwise.<br>
<br>Atterbury's reaction to the collapse of the tory interest was characteristically spirited. He published his <span class="italic">Considerations upon the Secret History of the White Staff</span>, which rehearsed all the high tories' grievances over the past four years, and blamed Oxford as the author of the party's misfortunes. He was also obliged to defend himself from accusations of Jacobitism levelled by Daniel Defoe, and did what he could to rally the party faithful, both privately and in print. As the general election approached, early in 1715, he published <span class="italic">English Advice to the Freeholders of England</span>, which painted a dismal picture of a country governed by the whigs, and rashly included a vehement personal attack on George I, which so enraged the government that a proclamation was issued against it and a reward offered for information. Fortunately for Atterbury, his tracks were well covered and his friends discreet. Despite debilitating attacks of gout, he proved an effective leader of the tories in the House of Lords. He was not involved in Jacobite conspiracy leading up to the Fifteen, but the government's treatment of the rebels may have proved a turning point for him. His pamphlet (again anonymous) <span class="italic">An argument to prove the affections of the people of England to be the best security of government</span> was an appeal for mercy for the six peers taken at Preston, and also a comprehensive indictment of unfettered whig rule.<h2>
<a name="FrombishoptoJacobiteconspirator"></a>From bishop to Jacobite conspirator</h2>Atterbury's spell as bishop of Rochester seems to have been among the most personally rewarding phases of his ecclesiastical career, at least in relation to diocesan business. A conscientious administrator, he was careful to ensure the episcopal act book was properly maintained, and though he found it necessary to conduct only one primary visitation, the diocese was small enough for him to get to know his clergy personally. Moreover, for once in his career he encountered little opposition: his sole visitation was uncontroversial, and his scrupulous examination of ordinands ensured that the new clerical recruits were unexceptionable. He did not find the Westminster deanery so congenial, and indeed it was the scene of the last great quarrel of his career, over the siting of a new dormitory at Westminster School. A dispute with Dr Robert Freind, the headmaster, was taken by Atterbury all the way to the Lords, on appeal, before he won his case. Politically, he was becoming more and more bitter. In the spring of 1716, seemingly convinced that the Hanoverian r&eacute;gime was irrevocably whig and inimical to the true interest of church and people, he finally responded to approaches from the Jacobites, though his decided opinion was that nothing could be done without an armed invasion from abroad. Later that year, when the Swedish plot was taking shape, led by the Swedish ambassador Count Gyllenborg, he became more actively involved, seeking to recruit Lord Oxford's co-operation and participating in various clandestine efforts to raise funds. However, he soon decided that the plan was likely to come to nothing. When intercepted letters came to the notice of the government, he ceased all correspondence with the Jacobites. Instead, he pinned his faith on the domestic revival of the tory interest, encouraged by the whig schism of 1717 and by ministerial attacks on the church. Despite recurrent attacks of gout, Atterbury organized resistance to the repeal of the <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity and Schism Acts</span> in the winter of 1718&#150;19, though his hopes of making political capital for the tories out of whig divisions were not realized. With Harcourt, he was reckoned the leader of the main body of his party, distinguished by the diarist Lady Cowper from &#145;the moderate Tories&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Mary, Countess Cowper</span>, 144).<br>
<br>After the South Sea Bubble had burst, the Jacobites launched another initiative. Atterbury took part in early discussions with the Jacobite agent George Kelly, but as always counselled caution, and insisted that the essential prerequisite was a military invasion from abroad. During the winter of 1720&#150;21 he was also drawn into negotiations with the beleaguered chief minister, Charles Spencer, third earl of Sunderland, who at this point was anxious to secure tory support to save his own political career. The attraction for Atterbury was some ministerial favour for his own case in the Lords about the Westminster School dormitory, but although this was forthcoming, there was no sign of any more substantial benefits for the tories as a party, especially the so-called &#145;free parliament&#146; (the government abstaining from the use of improper influence in elections), which was the cornerstone of their demands. By the time parliament reassembled in the autumn of 1721 even Atterbury realized that he and his friends had been used by Sunderland for the minister's own purposes. The bishop joined heartily in the new opposition in the Lords headed by the dissident whig William Cowper, first Earl Cowper, which harried the ministry throughout the session, entering protests at every defeat and subsequently publishing them, in order to appeal to public opinion in advance of the forthcoming election. At the same time Atterbury was gambling on a different kind of political initiative. With unexpected rashness he had agreed in November 1721 to proposals presented by the Pretender's agents for an armed landing in England, even though the details of the scheme were not worked out and did not seem to fulfil the requirements he himself had frequently specified. His involvement brought in other prominent Jacobites: William, Lord North and Grey, Thomas Wentworth, earl of Strafford, and Sir Henry Goring. But these were incompetent, even timorous, conspirators, whose collective caution amounted to inertia. When months had passed and the necessary funds from the English side showed no sign of being realized, Atterbury lost patience, quarrelled violently with his fellow plotters, and entirely broke off from them. The fact that his wife was seriously ill at this time may have affected his behaviour; certainly her death in April 1722 completed his emotional prostration.<br>
<br>Removing himself from the intrigues of the Jacobites did not save Atterbury, for the British ministers, and in particular Sir Robert Walpole, had the scent of the conspiracy in their nostrils. From all quarters information was falling into their hands. John Erskine, earl of Mar, the meddlesome Jacobite secretary of state, betrayed Atterbury to an English agent. Enciphered letters from George Kelly, Mar's go-between, were intercepted, and Kelly was himself arrested in London. Other minor Jacobite agents, some self-appointed, were also arrested, including a young Norfolk lawyer, Christopher Layer, who had been peddling fantastic schemes of his own. Mar's evidence had to be kept confidential, but the enciphered letters could be used, especially after Kelly's landlady identified Atterbury as one of the principals mentioned. Atterbury was arrested in his deanery on 24 August, and confined in the Tower of London, while Walpole and the ministers worked to prise incriminating evidence out of their various prisoners. The process was long-drawn-out, but in January 1723 Walpole was confident enough to secure the appointment of a select committee of the House of Commons to investigate the affair, which essentially traced the steps he and his colleagues had already taken. The select committee reported on 1 March, and the Commons, at Walpole's insistence, resolved to proceed against Atterbury not by trial and execution, as with the lesser fry, but by a bill of pains and penalties, which would deprive the bishop of all his preferments and impose a perpetual exile. Despite a valiant effort in the House of Lords, when Atterbury was heard by counsel before the third reading of the bill and turned the proceedings into a kind of state trial, at one point cross-examining Walpole, his chief accuser, in a memorable exchange, the result was a foregone conclusion. The bill was passed, and Atterbury departed for the continent, accompanied by his daughter Mary and her husband William Morice, and endowed with a capital sum of around &pound;10,000 partly made up of collections from tory friends.<h2>
<a name="Exiledeathandassessment"></a>Exile, death, and assessment</h2>Atterbury acted for many years as the Old Pretender's secretary of state, but it was an unhappy situation for him: he found the Catholicism of the court-in-exile not at all to his taste, distrusted (with good reason) many of his colleagues, and was exasperated at their lack of realism and sheer incompetence. At one point, after the failure of plans for a landing in Scotland in 1725, followed by news of a quarrel between James III and his queen, he was reported to have said that<blockquote>he has met with nothing but vexation since he undertook to concern himself with the <i>chevalier</i>'s affairs, but as he has begun with them he meant to go through with them, though he believed himself upon his decline, and that he should soon leave this troublesome world for an everlasting enjoyment of heaven. (Bennett, <span class="italic">Tory Crisis</span>, 289)</blockquote>In 1728, exhausted by the apparent hopelessness of the Jacobite cause, and enraged at the way in which James himself had been deceiving him, he resigned. He was, in any case, an old and sick man. He even addressed himself to Walpole, indirectly, hoping for royal permission to return home to see his family, but the appeal fell on deaf ears. Having travelled to Montpellier, in order to put some distance between himself and the Jacobites, he arranged to meet Mary and William Morice there but, tragically, Mary arrived after a gruelling journey mortally ill. Atterbury returned to Paris a broken man. He died there, of a seizure, on 22 February 1732. His remains were conveyed back to England, to be buried beside those of his wife and two daughters in Westminster Abbey, though by royal command the funeral, on 22 May 1732, was a very private affair. Nor was Atterbury permitted the inscription he had himself composed for his tomb, a long account of the injustices he had undergone at Walpole's hands. His scapegrace son Osborne had at first followed in his father's footsteps at Westminster School and Christ Church, but had left university without a degree and, falling into debt, had become a merchant seaman. He eventually redeemed himself, was ordained a clergyman, and in 1746 became rector of a Warwickshire parish.<br>
<br>Atterbury was neither a great theologian and scholar, nor an exemplar of Christian piety, though he was genuinely devout. As a writer and preacher he showed surface brilliance but no real depth; and his hot temper, quarrelsomeness, and vanity made him a very difficult man. Instead, he was the model of a political prelate, in an age when religion, and in particular relations between church and dissent, constituted the stuff of political debate. Indeed it is hard to distinguish his devotion to the Church of England from his party-political allegiance. That he should chiefly be remembered as an unsuccessful Jacobite conspirator and unhappy exile does less than justice to his achievements before 1714, when for fifteen years he was at the centre of ecclesiastical politics in England. More than anyone else he gave life and purpose to the high-church movement. His most poignant failure, therefore, was not the collapse of his schemes to restore the Stuarts, which in any case were the product of political desperation, but the previous failures of the high-church party: the inability of the convocation he had spent so much time, energy, and ink in trying to revive, to carry out the programme of reform for which he had hoped; and the inability of the tory politicians in 1714 to forestall the inception of the long whig ascendancy.<br>
