<span class="headword">Sewell,  Henry</span>  (1807&#150;1879), <span class="occ">lawyer and premier of New Zealand</span>, was born at Newport, Isle of Wight, on 7 September 1807, the fourth son of Thomas Sewell (1775&#150;1842), a leading solicitor of Newport, and his wife, Jane (1773/4&#150;1848), the youngest daughter of John Edwards, a curate of Newport. His brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25145/', "Richard Clarke Sewell")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36028/', "James Edwards Sewell")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25148/', "William Sewell")</script>, and his sister was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36027/', "Elizabeth Missing Sewell")</script>. Henry was educated at Hyde Abbey School, near Winchester. He qualified as a solicitor and joined the family firm in 1826. His father died in 1842, leaving an estate encumbered with large debts. Rather than declare insolvency, the family undertook to repay the creditors, a task which took thirty years and overshadowed Sewell's career.<br>
<br>This crisis was followed by the death on 28 July 1844 of Sewell's first wife, Lucinda Marianne, the eldest daughter of General William Nedham of Mount Olive, Jamaica, and Widcombe, Bath, whom he had married on 15 May 1834. Their six children were brought up by Sewell's sister, and Sewell himself moved to London, where he joined the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93787', "Canterbury Association")</script>, which was planning a Church of England colony in New Zealand. He became salaried deputy chairman in 1851 and two years later was sent out to New Zealand to wind up the association's affairs, having on 23 January 1850 married Elizabeth (1819&#150;1880), the second daughter of Captain Edward Kittoe RN of Deal. Sewell arrived in February 1853 with Edward Gibbon Wakefield, and settled at Lyttelton. His successful disposal of the association's liabilities and assets included the creation of a substantial land endowment for the diocese of Christchurch.<br>
<br>Sewell lived in New Zealand for seventeen years, in three periods&#151;1853&#150;6, 1859&#150;66, and 1870&#150;76. He was a prominent figure in the first generation of colonial politicians, among whom he had the reputation of a lettered wit and an independent man of business. He represented Lyttelton on the Canterbury provincial council in 1855&#150;6. He was a member of the house of representatives (1854&#150;6, 1860, 1865&#150;6) and sat in the nominated legislative council (1861&#150;5 and 1870&#150;73).<br>
<br>Sewell served in eight different ministries, starting with the &#145;mixed ministry&#146; of officials and politicians under James Edward FitzGerald (14 June &#150; 2 August 1854). When responsible government began he became the first premier (18 April &#150; 20 May 1856), but could not retain a majority in the house. As treasurer, he was virtually deputy premier in the first stable ministry, led by Edward Stafford (2 June &#150; 4 November 1856). Later he was negotiator on behalf of the colony in Australia and England (1857&#150;9).<br>
<br>After returning to New Zealand in February 1859 Sewell soon left the ministry. Having written a pamphlet in 1846 advocating a system of land transfer by simple registration of title, he was a suitable appointee as first registrar-general of lands in 1861. In 1863 he inaugurated the first land registry under the Torrens system of land transfer. He served as attorney-general in three ministries between 1861 and 1865. After another four-year break in England, he was briefly minister of justice in 1870&#150;71 and colonial secretary for a month in 1872.<br>
<br>Sewell finally left New Zealand in 1876 because of his wife's health and went to Romford, Essex, where his eldest son was curate. He later moved to 4 Salisbury Villas, Station Road, Cambridge, where he died on 14 May 1879. He was buried at Waresley, Huntingdonshire, where his wife's brother-in-law was vicar; Elizabeth was later buried beside her husband. Sewell recouped his finances in New Zealand by some modest suburban land dealings, but he was not really a colonist. Nor was he a successful politician. Contemporaries remarked on his &#145;dodgy lawyer-like way&#146; and his ability to argue a case rather than enunciate a policy. He was a drafter of memoranda and back-up man rather than leader. He wrote ten pamphlets on legal, ecclesiastical, political and race-relations topics; his <span class="italic">Journal</span>, written first as a newsletter to family and associates (and copied out by Elizabeth), provides the fullest private account of persons and places in early Canterbury and the beginnings of self-government in New Zealand.<br>
