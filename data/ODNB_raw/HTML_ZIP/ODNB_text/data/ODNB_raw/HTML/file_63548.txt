<span class="headword">Krishna Kanta Nandy <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Kantababu; Cantoo Baboo]</span></span>  (<em>c.</em>1720&#150;1794), <span class="occ">banian</span>, came to prominence in the service of Warren Hastings, the first British governor-general of Bengal. On 18 February 1788 Edmund Burke said: &#145;Whoever has heard of Mr Hastings's name with any knowledge of Indian connection, has heard of his Banyan, Cantoo Baboo&#146;  (<span class="italic">Writings and Speeches</span>, 6.384). Kantababu, the eldest of five brothers, was born in Cossimbazar, in the district of Murshidabad in Bengal, in one of three huts built by his father, Radhakrisna Nandy (<i>d</i>. 1754), that were being transformed into a house. Radhakrisna's grandfather migrated from the village of Sijna in the <i>taluk</i> of Manteswar in the Bengal district of Burdwan with his eldest son, Sitaram. The family traded in silk, betel-nut, areca-nut, and cotton fibres and were able to buy a small piece of land near the factory of the British East India Company, to which Radhakrisna supplied silk and cotton piece goods until his death in 1754. Kantababu, as he is known to posterity, as the head of the family, took charge of the business and trade, finding patronage and friendship with the young Warren Hastings posted there, and becoming his banian, or steward and business agent, from 1754 to 1763. On Hastings's departure from India, Francis Sykes, newly appointed as the company's resident at the court of the nawabs of Bengal at Murshidabad and chief of the Cossimbazar factory, chose Kantababu to serve as his banian until 1769. Hastings returned as governor of Bengal in 1772 and became governor-general in 1774. Kantababu again served him as his trusted banian from 1772 to 1785. On the death of his first wife in 1760, Kantababu had married a second time, to Anangamanjari from the village of Kurumba in Burdwan. Their only son, Lokenath, was born in 1764.<br>
<br>Francis Sykes became directly involved in the salt business from October 1768. Kantababu took a lease of the coastal salt-producing areas and ran the salt business in the name of his son, Lokenath, who became salt merchant for some of them, while Kantababu used his own name in others. He organized his trade well. At the behest of Hastings, however, he ceased to be a manufacturer or contractor of salt under the East India Company's monopoly. Instead, he conducted a wholesale business in salt from 1774 to 1776, sending salt in boatloads to different parts of Bengal. Kantababu's family business in silk was much larger. His silk account with the East India Company was successfully closed in 1780. From 1787 to 1789 he manufactured silk by the new filature factory methods. The family had depended on the silk trade for 100 years. Their fortunes rose with the importance of silk. When the business was no longer profitable, it was wound up.<br>
<br>Kantababu started buying property&#151;land, houses, orchards, and rights to collect revenue&#151;when the Maratha invasions overran western Bengal in 1742&#150;51 and the value of property dropped. Between 1752 and 1756 he bought eight properties, and after the battle of Plassey (1757) established the supremacy of the British he bought more, purchasing as many as twenty-three properties between 1758 and 1763. After the British victory at the battle of Buxar (1764) he bought property without reservation all over Bengal. He was in the list of revenue &#145;farmers&#146; recorded on 4 November 1766, when the company leased out large blocks of land to contractors for the taxation collected from it. He appears under the name of his nephew Baisnabcharan (or Busunchurn). The names of Kantababu and his son appear in April 1777 as the holders of revenue farms that yielded nearly Rs 600,000 (&pound;60,000). At Hastings's request Kantababu eventually relinquished farms worth Rs 80,000.<br>
<br>In 1781 Kantababu travelled to northern India with Hastings and was caught up with him in the revolt of the raja of Benares against Hastings's attempt to exact a heavy fine from him. He was present at the siege and capture of Bijaigarh, the last of the raja's forts, where he escorted to safety the raja's mother and the women of her household. An English version of his narrative of these events, &#145;Narrative of Bijaygarh&#146;, survives in the British Library (Add. MS 29205, fols. 118&#150;21). During Hastings's impeachment in 1791 Kantababu sent his old master a draft for &pound;1000.<br>
<br>Kantababu died between the noons of 9 and 10 January 1794 at Cossimbazar and was cremated there. The Cossimbazar raj family he founded has been an important influence on the social, religious, cultural, and industrial development of Bengal into modern times.<br>
