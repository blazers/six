<span class="headword">Cormac mac Airt</span> <span class="st"> [Cormac ua Cuinn, <em>called </em>Cormac Ulfhota]</span>  (<em>supp. </em>196/7&#150;267), <span class="occ">legendary king and sage</span>, features prominently in early Irish tradition. According to the annals of the four masters, he became king of Tara in the year 227 and reigned until 266. However, Irish annalistic records at such an early period are not to be taken as historically authentic, and it is likely that Cormac was a purely legendary figure.<br>
<br>Cormac was reputed to be the grandson of another prominent mythological king, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6080/', "Conn C&#233;tchathach")</script> (Conn the Hundred-Battler). His father was Art, often called Art Oenfher (Art of the One Man), evidently because he had only one son. Cormac was conceived as a result of a single encounter between Art and Acht&aacute;n, the beautiful daughter of the druid Olc Aiche; Art was then killed at the battle of Mag Mucrime. When Cormac was born, in 196 or 197, his grandfather Olc Aiche put magical protection on him against wounding, drowning, fire, witchcraft, and wolves.<br>
<br>Soon afterwards, Cormac was abducted by a female wolf and suckled by her. He was rescued by a hunter named Luigne Fer Tr&iacute;, who kept him for a year. His mother Acht&aacute;n then discovered where he was and brought him to F&iacute;achnae Cass&aacute;n, the foster father of Art. While he and his mother were on their journey northwards at night, the wolves of Ireland attempted to recapture the boy. However, he was saved by the intervention of a herd of wild horses. Cormac was fostered by F&iacute;achnae Cass&aacute;n for thirty years. The purpose of the association of Cormac with Luigne Fer Tr&iacute; was to assert an alliance between the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill (who claimed Cormac as their ancestor) and the Luigni and Corco Firthri of northern Connacht and also of the neighbourhood of Kells.<br>
<br>On a suitably auspicious day, Cormac set out for Tara with his father's sword and ring and assembly garment. As he approached Tara he saw a woman who was weeping. On enquiring the cause, it was explained to him that the woman was the owner of some sheep which had broken into the queen's woad garden and eaten the leaves off the plants. The king, Mac Con, had ordered that the sheep be forfeit for their offence. Cormac immediately pointed out that the judgment should have been &#145;one shearing for another&#146;, that is, that the woman should merely have had to forfeit the shearing of her sheep in recompense for the shearing of the woad plants. When Mac Con was informed of Cormac's judgment, he realized that he had been guilty of an injustice and that Cormac was the rightful king. According to another version of this episode, the side of the house in which Mac Con made his false judgment collapsed. Cormac subsequently assumed the kingship.<br>
<br>Because of his justice, Cormac's reign was characterized by peace and plenty. The rivers teemed with fish, the woods with mast, and the plains with honey. Tara was restored by Cormac so that it was grander than ever before and he added the most magnificent palace ever built there. The tale <span class="italic">Esnada Tige Buchet</span> (&#145;The melodies of the house of Buchet&#146;) describes his meeting with Eithne of the Long Side, who became his wife. She was a daughter of Cath&aacute;er M&oacute;r, king of Ireland, and was fostered by Buchet, a rich hospitaller in Leinster. However, the frequent visits of her twelve brothers reduced Buchet to penury and he and his wife were forced to flee to Kells (Cenannas), where they lived in a hut in the woods. Eithne loyally stayed with her foster father and looked after his bull and seven cows&#151;all that remained of his wealth. She continued to honour him by reserving for him the best milk, rushes, and water. Cormac sent a message to Buchet asking for Eithne as his bride, but he replied that only her father, Cath&aacute;er, could give her in marriage. Cormac ordered that Eithne be brought to him by force and had intercourse with her that night. She escaped the following morning, but was pregnant with a son, Cairpre Lifechair. Subsequently she became Cormac's queen, but only after a large bride-price had been paid to her foster father, Buchet. Cormac gave him all that he could see from the ramparts of Kells, including cows, oxen, horses, and tenantry.<br>
<br>The sources constantly stress the wisdom of Cormac: it is said that only Solomon son of David was wiser. He is also reputed to have embraced Christianity and to have refused to worship stones or trees. According to one Middle Irish text, only three Irishmen became Christians before the coming of St Patrick. The first was Conchobar mac Nessa, the second was Morann mac Cairpri Cinn Chaitt, and the third was Cormac mac Airt. A ninth-century collection of wise observations is attributed to Cormac. It is entitled <span class="italic">Tecosca Cormaic</span>, &#145;The teachings of Cormac&#146;, and consists of a series of replies to questions posed by his son Cairpre. Cormac advises in some detail on the proper qualities and behaviour of a king and stresses the importance of fostering poetry, learning, and art. He extols the virtues of receiving instruction from one's elders, but also describes how he acquired wisdom by solitary meditation: &#145;I was a listener in woods, I was a gazer at stars&#146;. He replies to his son's queries on such topics as proper behaviour at a feast, types of weather, care of the body, and how to plead a law case. Much of the text is devoted to a discussion of different psychological types and gives some general observations on human behaviour. In reply to his son's query &#145;How do you distinguish women?&#146;, Cormac launches into a bitter diatribe, accusing them of jealousy, silliness, haughtiness, greed, sulkiness, and many other vices. This is one of the most savagely anti-female passages in medieval literature.<br>
<br>Cormac is associated with technical innovation as well as learning. According to one tradition, he impregnated a slave named C&iacute;arnait. As her pregnancy advanced, she became unable to carry out her duty of grinding the corn for the king's household in a hand-quern. Cormac therefore sent for a millwright from overseas, who constructed the first mill built in Ireland. There are some references in the sources to Cormac's prowess as a warrior, but in general he does not feature as a military hero and there are accounts of his being forced into exile on at least two occasions. In one text he is also said to have been blinded in one eye, a blemish which made him ineligible for the office of king. A further reference to his physical characteristics is found in the epithet Ulfhota, which may be translated as &#145;of the Long Beard&#146;.<br>
<br>Because of the five magical protections placed on him by his maternal grandfather, Cormac was not vulnerable to most forms of death. However, his death occurred none the less, due to an accident while feasting in the house of Spel&aacute;n the hospitaller at Clettech, on the Boyne in Meath. A salmon bone had fallen into a bowl and had been inadvertently kneaded into bread which was given to Cormac. As he ate, the crowd outside watched a fight between two warriors. A sudden roar was raised, which startled Cormac. He swallowed a piece of bread with the bone in it and it stuck in his throat and killed him. Because of his Christian beliefs, Cormac had ordered that he was not to be buried in the pagan site of Brug na Bo&iacute;nne, but at Ros na R&iacute;g, near Slane, in Meath, with his face towards the east. His people disregarded his instructions. However, the River Boyne (B&oacute;inn) rose up and carried his body three times to Ros na R&iacute;g. On the third occasion his people followed his wishes and raised a gravemound for him at Ros na R&iacute;g.<br>
