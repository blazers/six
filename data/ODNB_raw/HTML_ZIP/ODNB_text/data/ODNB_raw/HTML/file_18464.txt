<span class="headword">Mazzinghi,  Joseph</span>, Count Mazzinghi in the papal nobility  (1765&#150;1844), <span class="occ">composer</span>, descended from an ancient Florentine family, was born, probably in London, on 25 December 1765, the eldest son of Tommaso Mazzinghi, a wine merchant who played the violin at Marylebone Gardens and, in 1763, had published six solos for that instrument. Tommaso went bankrupt in 1771 and died in 1775. Joseph was trained as a musician by his mother's sister, Cassandra Frederich (or Friedrich; afterwards Mrs Wynne), and later by Johann Christian Bach. At the age of ten he became organist to the Portuguese Chapel.<br>
<br>In 1779 Mazzinghi was apprenticed to Leopoldo De Michele, chief copyist to the Italian Opera at the King's Theatre, and acted as orchestra librarian. This led to his appointment, from the 1784&#150;5 season, as composer, arranger, and concertmaster (directing rehearsals and playing continuo from the harpsichord) under the management of John Gallini. The London system of presenting most operas as pasticcios meant that he &#145;became nearly as important a member of the company as the foreign [visiting] house composers&#146;  (Price and others, <span class="italic">Italian Opera</span>, 1.336). Even though recognition of recent continental opera as an integral whole was beginning to creep in, he adapted works by Sarti, Cimarosa, and Paisiello, sometimes adding arias of his own. He was not above publishing as his two of the most popular pieces in Mart&iacute;n y Soler's <span class="italic">Una cosa rara</span>; on the other hand a substitute aria for Cimarosa's <span class="italic">L'Olimpiade</span> improved on the original. He also composed original music for at least nine ballets, some of them by the innovative choreographer Jean-Georges Noverre. This, however, was regarded as a task for a second-rate composer, and some of the music has been judged &#145;frankly dull&#146;.<br>
<br>Mazzinghi remained at his post until the King's Theatre was burnt down on 17 June 1789. He was then taken on at a salary of &pound;300 as director of the 1790&#150;91 season at the Pantheon, the aristocratic managers of which had secured the one licence granted for Italian opera. His appointment may have been influenced by his closeness to the prince of Wales, who entrusted him with running the Carlton House concerts; he later taught the princess the piano. The Pantheon was, in its turn, destroyed by arson on 14 January 1792. Mazzinghi's duties were wide and included the composition of an opera; he apparently set out to write yet another pasticcio, but it was never performed. He and the company finished the 1792 season at the Little Theatre in the Haymarket, but when the rebuilt King's Theatre opened for Italian opera under new direction in 1793 Mazzinghi was no longer employed.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Mazzinghi had taken advantage of the wide terms of his contract to compose English operas for Covent Garden, and went on doing so until 1810. Among them was <span class="italic">Ramah Droog</span> (1798), written in collaboration with William Reeve, with a &#145;spirited and inventive&#146; overture  (Fiske). Mazzinghi's miscellaneous piano compositions were popular; he was a fashionable teacher and arranged the &#145;nobility concerts&#146;, established in 1791 and held on Sunday evenings at private houses.<br>
<br>Mazzinghi had married, at an unknown date, a woman with whom he had a son. After her death he married a daughter of the distiller Benjamin Hodges, who also predeceased him; they had a daughter. During a trip to Italy in 1834 he was made a count by Pope Gregory XVI, and recognized as a patrician of Florence by the grand duke of Tuscany. In his last years he retired to Bath while keeping on a house in Cadogan Place, Chelsea. He died on 15 January 1844 of a cerebral haemorrhage while on a visit to his son at Downside College, and was buried in the vault of the Chelsea Catholic church on the 25th.<br>
<br>Besides his stage pieces, Mazzinghi published between seventy and eighty piano sonatas, upwards of 200 other works for piano and as many for harp and other instruments, as well as about thirty-five vocal trios and a number of songs. Much of this mass of work, produced with apparent ease, was musicianly, but the flowing melodies were seldom strikingly original.<br>
