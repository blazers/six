</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blacklock,  Thomas</span>  (1721&#150;1791), <span class="occ">poet and writer</span>, was born on 10 November 1721 in Annan, Dumfriesshire, the son of John Blacklock (<i>d</i>. 1740), a bricklayer from Cumberland, and his wife, Ann, the daughter of Richard Rae, a cattle dealer. In early infancy Blacklock lost his sight owing to smallpox. Despite this misfortune the attentions of his father and friends engendered in him an interest in languages and literature, particularly poetry. In 1740 his father was killed while trying to repair a malt kiln. Richard Hewitt, a young boy from Rockcliff in Cumberland, then came to be educated and to attend Thomas as his guide and reader. <br>
<br>John Stevenson, an Edinburgh physician, became Blacklock's benefactor and enabled him to attend a grammar school in Edinburgh. Because of the Jacobite rising of 1745 Blacklock returned to Dumfries to live with his sister and her husband. Blacklock's first book, <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span>, was published in Glasgow in 1746: the poems ranged from one written before he was twelve to two odes about the disturbances. This book was reprinted with a life by Gilbert Gordon after Blacklock resumed his studies at the University of Edinburgh. He studied philosophy and then divinity, and continued his interest in languages including French, Greek, Latin, and Italian. <br>
<br>David Hume exhorted his friends and acquaintances to support Blacklock by purchasing his <span class="italic">Poems</span>. In 1754, in order to retain his position as keeper of the Faculty of Advocates library, Hume used the tactic of a token transfer of his salary to Blacklock. <br>
<br>Joseph Spence, prebendary at Durham, wrote a short life of Blacklock which was attached to a reprint of the 1754 edition of the <span class="italic">Poems</span>. Spence attempted an analysis of Blacklock's treatment of visible objects, and after Spence met Blacklock the account was amended for publication with an expanded edition of the <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1756). Spence made great efforts to ensure that the publication was supported by a long and prestigious list of subscribers. <br>
<br>In 1759, after Blacklock abandoned his hopes of lecturing in the University of Edinburgh, he was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Dumfries. In 1760 the earl of Selkirk proposed to place him as minister of the church at Kirkcudbright but the parishioners were resistant to church patronage and judged that Blacklock's blindness made him unfit to be their spiritual leader. Legal opinion was sought and the case aroused interest throughout the country. There were many delays before he was ordained on 22 April 1762. On 4 April Blacklock had married Sarah Johnston (1732&#150;1808), daughter of a Dumfries surgeon. At his ordination Blacklock had to make his way through jeering crowds. The stress of the occasion was such that later in the day he appeared to be in a state of altered consciousness. The disputations continued and the kirk session refused to work with him. A local man even threatened to kill him. Eventually an agreement was reached whereby, in return for an annuity, Blacklock demitted the charge in 1765. <br>
<br>Blacklock and his wife then moved to Edinburgh and established a boarding-house for young gentlemen studying at the university or associated with the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. Young men from Europe and America as well as from the British Isles boarded and studied with Blacklock and also on occasion acted as his amanuensis. Several students later achieved eminence and kept in touch with the man who had influenced their careers. When Samuel Johnson met Blacklock the two men compared the difficulties and enjoyment of compiling a dictionary with those experienced when writing poetry. The discussion was noted by James Boswell, but led to a request by Blacklock that the account be corrected. Although Blacklock's comment was acknowledged in a later publication, Boswell maintained that a written record was superior to one of memory  (Boswell). Blacklock was also acquainted with the young Walter Scott, who appreciated his guidance and made use of his library. <br>
<br>Blacklock produced <span class="italic">An Essay on Universal Etymology</span> (1756), where the general principles of grammar and the definitions of the parts of speech were given in verse followed by illustrative notes in prose. In 1760 and 1762 Blacklock's work was published in the two-volume <span class="italic">A Collection of Original Poems. By the Rev. Mr Blacklock and other Scotch Gentlemen</span>. Blacklock was highly respected and his literary opinion was sought by his contemporaries. Throughout his life he produced poems, reviews, articles, sermons, translations, and other prose works. His writings were to be found in journals such as the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Magazine and Review</span>. Blacklock was encouraged to express his support of James Beattie's criticism of Hume's writings  (<span class="italic">Edinburgh Courant</span>, 1770). In 1781 a small collection of pieces of scripture in verse-form &#145;to be sung in churches&#146; was approved by the general assembly of the Church of Scotland. An amended version of Blacklock's paraphrase of part of <span class="roman">Ecclesiastes</span> 12 was included. His work also included an extensive and detailed article on blindness for the second edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> (1783). Blacklock occasionally wrote satirical verses but usually consigned them to the flames soon after their composition. &#145;Pistapolis&#146;, an astonishing poetic diatribe lampooning those in Kirkcudbright who had rejected him, survived but remained unpublished until 1907. <br>
<br>In 1767, on the recommendation of James Beattie, Blacklock was awarded an honorary DD by Marischal College, Aberdeen. By 1768 he had communicated to Beattie his intention of compiling a collection of Scottish music and poetry with a view to publication. In October 1779 his (more general) &#145;Discourse on national musick&#146; appeared in the <span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span>. Although Blacklock rarely wrote in the Scots vernacular he did not follow the fashion that it should be disregarded, and when he became aware of the poems of Robert Burns he indicated his wish to subscribe for their first publication. After receiving a copy of the &#145;Kilmarnock Edition&#146; of Burns's poems he advised Burns that he should come to Edinburgh and produce a second enlarged edition. This advice from someone of Blacklock's literary standing resulted (according to Burns himself) in Burns's abandoning his planned journey to Jamaica. Blacklock introduced Burns to many influential people and was active in winning support for an Edinburgh edition of Burns's poems. Burns soon began to collaborate with Blacklock, Beattie, and William Tytler of Woodehouselee in their project to collect the songs and music of Scotland (published by James Johnson as <span class="italic">The Scots Musical Museum</span>, 6 vols., 1787&#150;1803). <br>
<br>Blacklock was an accomplished musician and composer, and advocated that blind children should learn music precisely rather than play by ear. He made recommendations about the manner of treatment and the means of education of blind children and adults, and applied his mind to the invention of techniques and devices for the education of the blind. When Blacklock became aware of the new methods of educating blind children being developed in Paris by M. Ha&uuml;y at the Institut des Jeunes Aveugles he requested a sample of the raised type used to help the children to print and learn to read. Although communication between the countries was disrupted by the onset of the French Revolution, Blacklock received a copy of the book containing the raised text and began translating it into English as <span class="italic">An Essay on the Education of the Blind</span>. Blacklock determined that an institution similar to that in Paris should be set up in Edinburgh so that blind children and adults could be educated and earn their living with dignity. Blacklock died at his home in Chapel Street, Edinburgh, on 7 July 1791, after contracting a fever. He was buried in the churchyard of St Cuthbert's Chapel of Ease, Edinburgh, on 11 July. His ambition to establish an institution to educate blind people was realized through the efforts of his friend David Miller (also blind) and the Revd David Johnston. The Society for the Relief of the Indigent Blind was established in 1793, two years after the first such institution in Britain had been formed in Liverpool. <br>
<br>Editions of Blacklock's work continued to be published after his death and in 1793 a new edition of his <span class="italic">Poems</span> was published together with <span class="italic">An Essay on the Education of the Blind</span> and a life by Henry Mackenzie. Many of Blacklock's sermons remain in manuscript form.<br>
