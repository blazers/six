<span class="headword">Hughes,  Elizabeth Phillips</span>  (1851&#150;1925), <span class="occ">college head and promoter of education in Wales</span>, was born in Carmarthen on 22 June 1851, the eldest of three daughters and second of five children of John Hughes (1817&#150;1897), a surgeon, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1900), the daughter of Philip Phillips. Elizabeth's great-grandfather Samuel Levi Phillips was one of the founders of the banks in Haverfordwest and Milford Haven, and converted from Judaism to Christianity, changing his surname from Levi to Phillips. Her father was prominent in the civic life of Carmarthen as medical officer of health, chairman of the school board and board of guardians, and president of the literary and scientific institute. Her elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34043/', "Hugh Price Hughes")</script>, became an eminent Methodist preacher.<br>
<br>Little that is definite is known of Elizabeth's early years, except that she was said to have found learning difficult as a child and that she was sent to a private school, Hope House, in Taunton. Like her sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48527/', "Frances Emily Hughes")</script>, she broke away from the family tradition of Methodism and became an Anglican. She came to the attention of Dorothea Beale, and taught at Cheltenham Ladies' College from 1877 until 1881. There she acquired the qualifications that took her in 1881 to Newnham College, Cambridge, where she got a first in the moral science tripos in 1884, and a second in history in 1885; she also helped to form the Association of Assistant Mistresses.<br>
<br>On going down from Newnham, Elizabeth Hughes was appointed as the first principal of Cambridge Training College, formed by a committee including Frances Buss, Sophie Bryant, and Anne Jemima Clough with the purpose of training university women to teach in girls' secondary schools. In 1949, when the college became a recognized institution of the University of Cambridge, it was renamed Hughes Hall in her honour. The college opened with fourteen students, in cramped premises, in October 1885. Elizabeth Hughes was responsible at first for most of the teaching, and had no assistant except a resident housekeeper. By 1898 the college had been incorporated as a limited liability company; it had acquired new premises, a large lecture hall, a library of 3000 books, a museum, and a gymnasium. There was an academic staff of three besides the principal, and the nucleus of a picture collection acquired by her during her extensive travels. In her forceful evidence to the royal commission on secondary education (Bryce commission) in June 1894, she asserted the value of a theoretical knowledge of teaching and her ideal of a trained profession. She wanted men and women teachers trained together, as well as those seeking to teach in elementary and secondary schools. Her undated pamphlet <span class="italic">The Education of the Majority</span> included a plea for middle schools for boys and girls between the ages of twelve and sixteen.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Hughes was also a leading figure in education in Wales, and was an advocate of a national educational system. At the Liverpool national eisteddfod in 1884 she won a prize for her essay &#145;The higher education of girls in Wales&#146;, and during a conference of the Cymmrodion Society on education, in 1888, she urged that in any system of Welsh secondary education equal provision should be made for girls and boys. In 1887 she addressed the first meeting of the Association for Promoting the Education of Girls in Wales, of which she became secretary in 1898. She was the only woman member of the committee which drafted the charter for the University of Wales (1893) which, unlike Oxford and Cambridge, placed men and women on an equal footing as regards admission to degrees. In 1894, as a crown nominee, she became one of only six women on the university's court of governors. In her pamphlet <span class="italic">The Educational Future of Wales</span> (1894) she argued for the democratic principle of education for all, and the Christian principle of excluding none on the grounds of gender or creed.<br>
<br>In 1899 Elizabeth Hughes resigned as principal of the Cambridge college, pleading ill health, and went to live with her younger brother, Colonel John Arthur Hughes (1860&#150;1938), in Barry. She had a private income. She travelled round the world, paid two visits to the United States, and for a time in 1902 taught English in Japan. She was much in demand as a speaker at educational conferences. In 1903, at the conference of the National Union of Women Workers, she criticized the exclusion of women from membership of county councils. She was subsequently co-opted to the Glamorgan county education committee. In 1914 she helped to establish the training college for women teachers in Barry; she also formed the Twentieth Century Club for women in the town. She organized the first Red Cross women's camp, and during the First World War was commandant of a Voluntary Aid Detachment hospital in Glamorgan, for which she was appointed MBE. She received an honorary LLD from the University of Wales in 1920 for her services to Welsh education. She developed an interest in Welsh literature, and took the bardic name of Merch Myrddin as a reminder of her birthplace. In spite of her fears for her health, she was remarkably energetic (she climbed the Matterhorn at the age of forty-eight). Elizabeth Hughes died at Penrheol, 2 Park Road, Barry, Glamorgan, on 19 December 1925. In appearance, she was described as &#145;rather short, rotund, and plain&#146;  (E. V. Hughes, 68). A medallion in Hughes Hall portrays her with short hair, an aquiline nose, and a determined chin. She was unmarried.<br>
