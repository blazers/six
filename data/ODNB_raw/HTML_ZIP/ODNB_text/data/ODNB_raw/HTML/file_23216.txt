<span class="headword">Read,  David Charles</span>  (1790&#150;1851), <span class="occ">etcher and painter</span>, was born at Boldre, near Lymington, Hampshire, on 1 March 1790. He went to London at an early age and was apprenticed to the engraver John Scott; but, his health suffering, he returned to the country, and there produced woodcuts for several works, including an edition of <span class="italic">The Pilgrim's Progress</span> published by William Sharp at Romsey (1816&#150;17). In January 1820 he settled at Salisbury, where he continued to reside in the close until 1845, building a successful, though unremunerative, practice as a drawing-master. Read showed only one work at the Royal Academy, a landscape in oil, in 1823; this was followed by seven works at the British Institution and six more at the Suffolk Street gallery of the Society of British Artists before he ceased exhibiting in 1840. During this period he spent his spare time sketching in pencil, watercolours, and oils, working chiefly in the open air, and he prided himself on the fidelity with which he rendered weather and atmospheric effects.<br>
<br>Read made his first experiments in etching in 1826, and the works for which he is now best remembered were first published in 1828. He was a rapid draughtsman, and between that date and 1844 he produced 237 plates, mainly after his own works. Sixteen of them were portraits, including two of Goethe, and one of Handel, after Hogarth; the remainder were landscapes, many of views around Salisbury. Their merit is very unequal, however. At their best they recall the work of Rembrandt, especially in their extensive use of drypoint&#151;unusual with English artists of this date. But in others the drawing is often faulty, and a black and harsh effect is produced by the mechanical cross-hatching of the shadows and an excess of roulette work. Read was scrupulous in his attention to the technical production of his work. Thus, although he sent his earliest plates to be printed in London, he soon obtained a press and pulled all the impressions himself. Moreover, he was careful not to print impressions from plates which showed signs of wear; he destroyed sixty-three of his plates in 1845, and the rest were cancelled by his family after his death.<br>
<br>Read published six series of etchings between 1829 and 1845. These include thirty-one views of <span class="italic">Wiltshire Scenery</span> (1837), a set of twenty-three <span class="italic">Etchings from Nature Designed to Illustrate a Few of the Leading Features of English Scenery</span> (1845), and a series of thirteen views of <span class="italic">Lake Scenery</span> (1840). Although he complained about the lack of attention his etchings attracted, Read was flattered to note the appreciation of Goethe and Mendelssohn, and he gained the support of a number of patrons. These included Chambers Hall, whose collection of his prints is now at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and the first earl of Ellesmere. Read himself presented the British Museum with two volumes containing 168 of his etchings.<br>
<br>On leaving Salisbury in 1845 Read spent more than a year in Italy, and on his return he devoted himself to painting in oils, producing some of his best works for Dr Coope between 1846 and 1849. His health became seriously impaired towards the end of 1849, and he died, unmarried, at his home, 24 Bedford Place, Kensington, London, on 28 May 1851.<br>
