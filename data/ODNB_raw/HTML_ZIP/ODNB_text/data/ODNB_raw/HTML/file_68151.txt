<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bowery,  Leigh</span>  (1961&#150;1994), <span class="occ">designer and performance artist</span>, was born in Sunshine, a suburb of Melbourne, Australia, on 26 March 1961, the son of Tom Bowery, accountant, and his wife, Evelyn (<i>d</i>. 1994). Born into a middle-class family, he was an intelligent and confident boy who excelled at school and achieved grade 8 at piano. Highly creative, he learned to knit and crochet at a young age and went on to study fashion at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. However, he soon tired of the commercialism of his course and the parochialism of his environment and resolved to travel to London, an ambition that he achieved in October 1980. On arriving he focused his energies on joining the capital's alternative nightclub set, who were then wearing the &#145;new romantic&#146; look, incorporating frills and makeup for women and men. Soon he was designing and selling clothes in Kensington market. In 1984 he moved to what became his main home&#151;a council flat in Farrell House, Ronald Street, in the East End of London. This was initially shared with his close friend Trojan (born Gary Barnes), an artist who collaborated in its bright and elaborate decoration.<br>
<br>Bowery was one of the first fashion designers to promote the 1970s revival, and incorporated into his designs glam-rock elements such as platform shoes, bright colours, fine fabrics, and glitter, which allowed feminine and androgynous looks for men. His costumes were always beautifully made, employing his many crafts and involving long hours of close work. In one of his earliest and best documented designs (which he called &#145;Pakis from outer space&#146;) he began to experiment with full-face makeup in red, green, or blue, which was decorated with jewels and a chain from nose to ear, evocative of Hindu images. The effort that went into both creating and wearing his &#145;looks&#146; was such that they were not viable commercially, and Bowery was in any case ambivalent towards spreading them widely. His initial model was Trojan, but seeing the attention that his designs created Bowery began to wear them himself. He was a large man, and his clothes achieved additional shock value on his tall, 16 stone frame.<br>
<br>Bowery had by now emerged as a well-known character in London's nightclubs, and in 1985 he consolidated his influence by becoming a partner in a new nightclub, Taboo. He was its public face and centre of attention. Each week he focused on preparing a new outfit for his next appearance. Many were exquisitely tailored, and while emphasizing his bulk they also incorporated traditionally feminine elements. Examples included large polka dots that extended across his yellow-painted face, bustle skirts worn with a First World War German tin helmet, and Lycra costumes with exposed buttocks, worn with high-heeled shoes. All incorporated heavy makeup, generally exaggerating the eyes and lips, and in one memorable look extending over Bowery's entire shaved head, on which coloured paint was dripped from the crown, akin to a broken fluorescent egg. But at Taboo, Bowery was more than just an exhibit; he was also its social centre. His wide networks, wit, charm, and easy sociability attracted a core clientele of designers, artists, and performers, as well as others drawn by the spectacle or who simply wanted to dress up. The club's culture was one of sexual permissiveness, and (like Bowery's looks) of transgressing accepted boundaries of gender and sexuality. As he remarked, &#145;the name Taboo is a joke really, because there's nothing you can't do there&#146;  (Tilley, 61). The culture of permissiveness also extended to drugs, which claimed the lives of Trojan and the club's flamboyant doorman Mark Vautier, both aged twenty, in 1986.<br>
<br>Bowery himself was tremendously strong both physically and mentally&#151;something that he demonstrated by dancing all night in his increasingly constricting outfits, often hoisting others off the floor. After Taboo's closure, in 1986, his looks developed to concentrate increasingly on physical distortion&#151;using corsets and gaffer tape to compress and move his flesh, and sculpted foam to extend it. This was achieved only at the cost of huge physical discomfort. He continued to explore issues of gender and sexuality but his designs became more threatening and disturbing, often incorporating masks or other headwear. Through this work he explored his favourite emotion&#151;embarrassment&#151;and overcame his earlier feelings of physical inadequacy. &#145;The idea of transforming oneself&#146;, he commented, &#145;gives courage and vigour &hellip; Things that used to embarrass me like nudity and gender confusion don't any more&#146;  (Tilley, 112).<br>
<br>Bowery had long been an exhibitionist, but in 1988 he was accepted into the art world as a formal exhibit. At the Anthony d'Offay gallery in London he appeared daily, for a week, in a different outfit behind a one-way mirror. Later he began a collaboration with the artist Lucian Freud, for whom he modelled regularly from 1990 until his death. The relationship started in confusion, as Freud assumed that Bowery would pose dressed, and Bowery that Freud wanted him nude. As Bowery stripped fast at his first appointment it was his expectation that prevailed. He found this showing of his private self profoundly liberating, but Freud's paintings depicted a man whom most people who met Bowery would not recognize. Another artistic collaboration, with the photographer Fergus Greer, showed the more familiar Bowery, while cataloguing a large number of his looks and demonstrating their variety, complexity, and artistry.<br>
<br>Bowery's anonymous daytime appearance (generally including a short wig to cover his baldness) enabled him to carry on a sexual life that since his schooldays had centred on casual encounters with men in public toilets and parks. Although entirely open about his sexuality, he found this an efficient way of feeding his considerable sexual appetite, and he entertained friends with many tales of his conquests (although he was also known for his lies and exaggeration). Once diagnosed as HIV-positive, in 1988, he may have been truthful in citing &#145;unsafe sex with over 1,000 men&#146; as his greatest regret. He had few, if any, conventional relationships, although he married his assistant Nicola Joy Ann Bateman on 13 May 1994. His friend and biographer Sue Tilley later suggested that Trojan was &#145;the true love of Leigh's life&#146;  (Tilley, 77).<br>
<br>Bowery once remarked that &#145;every time I go out it turns into a performance&#146;  (Tilley, 195). Alongside modelling, in his later years he concentrated on formalizing this activity. His first stage appearances were with the dancer and choreographer Michael Clark, for whom he had been designing costumes since 1983. Although large and clumsy, Bowery began dancing with Clark's group in 1987, and sometimes played piano. His independent performances began as repeats of his nightclub appearances but were increasingly designed to shock. He enjoyed incorporating bodily functions, and on one occasion a water enema, which he had administered to himself, went spectacularly wrong on stage. In another celebrated show he &#145;gave birth&#146; to a naked Nicola Bateman, covered in slime, who had been strapped under his dress throughout a vigorous hour-long performance. Bowery also sang&#151;in his groups the Quality Street Wrappers, Raw Sewage, and Minty&#151;and aspired to release a record of his song &#145;Useless Man&#146;.<br>
<br>Leigh Bowery's last performance was on 24 November 1994. The authorities shut the show down, somewhat to his relief, as he had been feeling unwell. Four days later he was hospitalized with meningitis&#151;a product of his HIV-positive status, which he had divulged only to Sue Tilley. Still remarkably strong, he fought his illness, but died at the Middlesex Hospital, Westminster, on 31 December 1994. His body was flown to Australia to be buried at Macedon, Victoria, next to that of his mother. As if in final proof of his nonconformism his coffin proved too large for the hole that initially had been dug for it. Certainly not to everybody's taste, Bowery's contribution to design, performance, and art, as well as to the culture of gender and sexuality, was remarkable for his thirty-three years, and after his death has reached a wider audience through a series of exhibitions, publications, and documentaries.<br>
