<span class="headword">Rae,  James</span>  (1716&#150;1791), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, only son of John Rae (1677&#150;1754), a writer and descendant of Stirlingshire landowners, was born in Edinburgh. His grandfather, also named James Rae, was appointed barber to Charles II in 1662 and in 1686 was given permission to build public baths in Edinburgh. On 27 August 1747 Rae became a member of the Incorporation of Surgeons of Edinburgh, where in 1764&#150;5 he filled the office of deacon or president. He also served as auditor of accounts (1754), librarian (1756), and treasurer (1760&#150;64). Rae was the first surgeon appointed to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, on 7 July 1766, and he immediately began to give a series of lectures. These lectures were so highly appreciated by his colleagues that in October 1776 they made a determined attempt to found a professorship of surgery in the university and to appoint Rae the first professor. This project was defeated by Alexander Monro secundus, who afterwards managed to convert his own chair of anatomy into one of anatomy and surgery.<br>
<br>Rae married, in 1744, Isobel, daughter of Ludovic Cant of Thurstan; they had two sons and several daughters. The elder son, William, joined the Incorporation of Surgeons on 18 July 1777, settled in London, where he married Isabella, sister of Sir Robert Dallas, and died young. John, the younger brother, was the first fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, admitted on 14 March 1781; he became president in 1804&#150;5 and was well known in Edinburgh as a dentist. Among Rae's daughters was Elizabeth, wife of James Fleming of Kirkcaldy, whose daughter Margaret Fleming (1803&#150;1811) was immortalized by John Brown in <span class="italic">Pet Marjorie</span>.<br>
<br>Rae did in Edinburgh what Percivall Pott did in London: he established the teaching of clinical surgery on a firm and broad platform. He died in 1791 and was buried, as was his wife, in the family tomb in Greyfriars Church, Edinburgh.<br>
