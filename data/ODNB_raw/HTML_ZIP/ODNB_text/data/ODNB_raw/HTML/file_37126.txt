<span class="headword">Armstrong,  Edward Allworthy</span>  (1900&#150;1978), <span class="occ">ornithologist and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Corlea, Lowwood, Belfast, on 8 October 1900, the younger child and only son of Hamilton Armstrong, manufacturer's agent, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Susan, daughter of Dr Samuel W. Allworthy. He was educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution and then at Queen's University, Belfast, studying science in his first year then switching to philosophy. He graduated BA (honours) in 1921.<br>
<br>Called to a religious vocation, Armstrong attended Ridley Hall Theological College, Cambridge, in 1921&#150;3, being ordained deacon in 1923 and priest in 1924. Spells as a curate in Doncaster and Ipswich were followed by three years as chaplain at St Andrew's in Kowloon, 1929&#150;31, during which he studied Chinese at Hong Kong University. He then spent eleven years in Leeds, first as curate at St Peter's (1932&#150;8), during which he obtained an MA in the history and philosophy of religion and in Chinese studies at Leeds University, then as vicar of St Matthew's, Holbeck. In 1940 he married Eunice Joan, the daughter of Frank Uttley, a Methodist minister. They had two sons. In 1943 he returned to Cambridge as vicar of St Mark's, Newnham, in which post he remained until his retirement in 1966.<br>
<br>Armstrong's career in the Anglican church was unexceptional and it was in other fields that this remarkable man achieved international distinction, most notably as a writer and an original student (as observer and interpreter) of bird behaviour&#151;in which field he produced a huge output of highly influential articles, books, and scientific papers. He had an extraordinary, polymathic mind, the breadth of his interests embracing folklore, anthropology, theology, philosophy, psychology, foreign languages, and Shakespearian criticism, as well as ornithology. His Christian delight in nature gave him &#145;a sense of wonder in creation&#146;, an important theme in his theology, his religious faith and a great love of the beauty of nature being basic to his character. Proud of being a member of a long line of parson naturalists stretching back to John Ray and Gilbert White, he saw his contributions to science as an extension of his work as a priest.<br>
<br>Armstrong's interest in and love of birds began during his childhood in Northern Ireland and found their first mature expression in his prizewinning book <span class="italic">Birds of the Grey Wind</span> (1940), as much a contribution to literature as to natural history. What has been called his &#145;exact and scientific attitude to bird-life&#146; then gave rise to a series of important books on birds&#151;<span class="italic">Bird Display</span> (1942) and its sequel <span class="italic">Bird Display and Behaviour</span> (1947), <span class="italic">The Wren</span> (1955), <span class="italic">The Folklore of Birds</span> (1958), <span class="italic">A Study of Bird Song</span> (1963), and <span class="italic">The Life and Lore of Birds</span> (1975)&#151;as well as a number of shorter or more popular works. Two other books&#151;<span class="italic">Shakespeare's Imagination</span> (1946) and <span class="italic">St. Francis: Nature Mystic</span> (1973)&#151;also drew upon his ornithological knowledge, making each the definitive contribution in its field. In recognition of his work he was made an honorary MA of Cambridge in 1952 and received a special union gold medal of the British Ornithologists' Union in 1959 and the Stamford Raffles award of the Zoological Society of London in 1966.<br>
<br>Armstrong's last years were marred by debilitating illness but, a compulsive worker, he went on writing until the end, dying at his home, 23 Leys Road, Cambridge, on 19 December 1978.<br>
