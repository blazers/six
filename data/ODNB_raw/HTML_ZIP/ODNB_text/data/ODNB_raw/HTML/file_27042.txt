<span class="headword">Taylor,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1534), <span class="occ">Catholic priest and diplomat</span>, was born into a poor family at Barton under Needwood in the parish of Tatenhill, Staffordshire, the eldest of male triplets. According to tradition, the boys were presented to Henry VII, who undertook to pay for their education. In 1500 Taylor was a student in the law faculty at Ferrara, where he received the degree of DCnL. By the time he was ordained a priest in April 1503 Taylor had already begun to accumulate benefices in England, beginning with the rectory of Shottesbrooke, Berkshire, followed by that of Bishop's Hatfield, Hertfordshire, in December 1500, and a prebend at Wells in April 1505. His advancement was aided by papal dispensations for plurality granted in 1501 and 1504. In August 1504 he was sent on his first diplomatic mission, in the company of John Yonge, master of the rolls and a fellow student at Ferrara, to negotiate a commercial treaty with the duke of Burgundy. His efforts were rewarded with the rectory of Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire, in January 1505, and he was soon appointed a royal chaplain to Henry VII.<br>
<br>With the accession of Henry VIII, Taylor's career prospered, and he soon added the rectory of All Hallows-the-Great in London and Coldingham in Northamptonshire to his portfolio of livings, together with the prebend of Eccleshall at Lichfield. Despite his lack of chancery experience, Taylor was appointed clerk of parliaments on 20 October 1509, and by 1515 his reforms of record keeping had produced the first proper Lords' journal. He accompanied the English army invading France in the summer of 1513, composing a detailed account of the campaign for his patron John Yonge  (BL, MS Cotton Cleopatra C.v 64). His diplomatic work continued: he regularly replied to foreign ambassadors' orations at court, and in early 1515 he was included in an aborted embassy to Rome. Taylor also served as prolocutor of the 1515 Canterbury convocation, in which capacity he addressed the bishops on behalf of the lower clergy, rejecting royal tax demands. Closely associated with Cardinal Wolsey, by late 1516 he was employed in chancery as deputy to the master of the rolls, Cuthbert Tunstall. These services to crown and cardinal continued to bring rich rewards, with appointments as archdeacon of Derby (March 1516) and archdeacon of Buckingham (December 1516) followed by a canonry of St Stephen's, Westminster (March 1518). As a royal chaplain Taylor was present both at the Field of Cloth of Gold in the summer of 1520, and shortly afterwards when Henry VIII met the emperor Charles V at Gravelines.<br>
<br>Taylor's first major diplomatic assignment came in the autumn of 1525, when he was dispatched as an ambassador to France following the battle of Pavia. He was present at the release of Fran&ccedil;ois I at Bayonne in March 1526, and spent several months travelling with the itinerant French court; the Venetian ambassador credited Taylor with persuading Fran&ccedil;ois I not to ratify the treaty to which he had agreed while a prisoner of the Habsburgs. As in 1513, Taylor kept a diary of his travels, recording his impressions of French churches and the many fraudulent relics they contained  (BL, Cotton MS Caligula D.ix 107). Throughout the summer of 1526 he worked under Wolsey's direction to arrange a league between England, France, and the papacy, but in mid-August he was replaced by John Clerk, like himself a clerical diplomat. Returning via Paris (where he attended some Greek lectures), Taylor reached Dover in late November.<br>
<br>On 27 June 1527 Taylor was named master of the rolls, but four months later returned to France to invest Fran&ccedil;ois I with the Garter, and then remained in Paris as ambassador. By the summer of 1528 he was occupied in making arrangements for the journey of the papal legate Campeggi to England, and dealing with one of his servants under investigation for Lutheranism. Taylor's second French embassy lasted until Easter 1529, when the imminent legatine court in England necessitated his recall. He was present at the opening session on 18 June 1529 and was soon occupied in taking depositions from witnesses. The failure of the legates to resolve the king's Great Matter led to the fall of Wolsey; as master of the rolls Taylor took custody of the great seal, surrendered by his former patron on 7 October 1529, and delivered it to the king three days later.<br>
<br>In September 1531 the veteran diplomat led a third embassy to France, designed to strengthen the Anglo-French alliance in order to pressure Pope Clement VII to grant Henry VIII an annulment. Having successfully concluded a treaty and arranged a meeting between Henry and Fran&ccedil;ois at Calais, by November 1532 Taylor had returned to his duties as master of the rolls at Westminster. He resigned the archdeaconry of Derby in early 1533, but rumours that he might be elevated to the episcopate (perhaps to the vacant see of Coventry and Lichfield) proved unfounded. However, another <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27043/', "John Taylor (d. 1554)")</script>, bishop of Lincoln from 1552, is thought to have been his nephew or illegitimate son. In May 1534 it was believed that Taylor would soon resign as master of the rolls (probably due to illness); on 21 September Stow reported that he had been discharged from office. Five days earlier Taylor had made his will, which was revised on 1 October and proved on 24 November 1534. He died during October and was buried in the chapel of the former hospital of St Anthony, in Threadneedle Street, London, but his enduring monument is the church which he erected during the 1520s, on the site of the humble Staffordshire cottage where he was born.<br>
