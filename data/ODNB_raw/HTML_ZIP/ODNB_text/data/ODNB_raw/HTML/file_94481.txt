<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Coker,  Peter Godfrey</span>  (1926&#150;2004), <span class="occ">painter and etcher</span>, was born at the Royal Free Hospital, St Pancras, London, on 27 July 1926, the only child of Edwin Henry Coker, gold polisher and later manager of a wholesale confectionery company, and his wife, Elsie Violet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Goode. His parents were then living in Old Ford on the edge of the East End, but soon after his birth they moved to 1 Moyers Road, Leytonstone, Essex, an area that was close to open countryside. This house was let to friends when they moved again, in 1936, to a new house in a still more rural setting, at Havering-atte-Bower. There Coker, at the age of twelve, resolved to become a painter, having been encouraged at Pettits Lane School by the art teacher. Even when he was a teenager his working method was thorough and ordered. One of his grandfathers, on the paternal side, was a book-edge marbler, while the other had an engraving workshop, where the array of tools and purposeful atmosphere awoke in the young boy awareness of the dignity and pleasure in craftsmanship. Another significant factor in his early life was his mother's artistry and flair, made evident in her appearance through her own dressmaking skills, and in her talent as a pianist and singer. She held musical evenings in the home and also took her son to concerts and the opera, thereby ensuring, as he once said, that music became for him &#145;a second string&#146;  (Gore).<br>
<br>Coker's wish to enter art school was resisted by his father, and on leaving school in 1940 he became an assistant in his father's firm, Kerland and Haskin. Miserable in the confectionery trade, he was rescued by a regular customer who obtained him a job at Odham's Press in Long Acre, Covent Garden. When a new employee arrived Coker was moved up a grade. He offered to trade his pay rise for a full day at the nearby St Martin's School of Art, where he was already attending evening and weekend classes. Before long he was also taking classes in lithography and etching under W. P. Roberts at the Central School of Arts and Crafts. In 1943, aged seventeen, he volunteered for the Royal Navy but owing to an auditory problem was eventually placed in the Fleet Air Arm. By the end of 1946 he was back at St Martin's as a full-time student with a war-service grant. A ready student, he gained from Vivian Pitchforth and James Stroudley, by advice and example, a solid grounding as a painter.<br>
<br>Coker's education, up to this point, had been within a very English mould. His frame of reference was expanded by two visits to Italy and France, in 1949 and 1950, and in particular by his first-hand experience of French painting. Previously he had been excited by one of Courbet's Etretat paintings which he found, by chance, in a central fold in the <span class="italic">Saturday Evening Post</span>. But it had not fully prepared him for the audacity, breadth, and scale of Courbet's <span class="italic">Funeral at Ornans</span>. It set a benchmark for his work at the Royal College of Art, which he entered in September 1950, staying four years. Wholly engaged as a student, Coker yet belonged to no group. One reason for this is that he returned home every evening to 1 Moyers Road (which still belonged to his parents), to his wife&#151;Vera Joyce Crook (<i>b</i>. 1926), a mathematician involved in scientific research, and daughter of Charles Robert Crook, civil servant&#151;whom he had married on 31 March 1951; the couple had a son, Nicholas, who was born in 1952.<br>
<br>Though his manner of painting and choice of subject matter linked him in the public mind with the &#145;kitchen sink&#146; painters, Coker had only minimal connection at the Royal College with John Bratby, Derrick Greaves, Edward Middleditch, and Jack Smith. A realist approach was prevalent at that time, in French art as much as in English, and Coker's firmly and thickly painted canvases of butcher's shops, or still lives with a flayed hare, a chicken's carcass or a sheep's, had a visual splendour as well as a brutal toughness. Coker always denied that his work had political intent. Nevertheless, these paintings betray a strain and melancholy that can be related to the tensions of the period. They associated him with the &#145;kitchen sink&#146; painters, though he never exhibited with them at the Beaux Arts Gallery, but took his work to Zwemmer's, which gave him in all five one-man shows, in 1956, 1957, 1959, 1964, and 1967. After Zwemmer's closed he was associated first with the Thackeray Gallery, then with Gallery 10, both in London, exhibiting also at many galleries and institutions in the provinces.<br>
<br>Though Coker occupied a persistent presence in the art world over four decades he did so for much of the time in an adverse climate. The arrival in Britain in the late 1950s of American abstract expressionism almost overnight terminated interest in realist art and for the next two decades the British art scene was very much in thrall to the influence of American art and art theory. Subjectless abstraction was unattractive to Coker, who once said &#145;The whole question of a subject is finding something to identify with&#146;. He remained resolute in his commitment to the thing seen, and he continued, triumphantly, to uncover sensations, moods, and emotions that were anchored to specific places. His affiliation with European realism and, more particularly, the French pursuit of <i>belle peinture</i>, may have limited the recognition he received, but it meant that he was pitting himself not so much against his contemporaries as against a greater, more far-reaching tradition. He worked with fierce passion, stubborn ambition, and great tenacity, and his pictures remained powerfully conceived, strong and straightforward in execution. From 1955 onwards landscape became the chief focus of his art, and in between teaching commitments at St Martin's and elsewhere he travelled in England and France, often to places associated with painters he admired. From 1962, to the end of his life, his home was the Red House at Mistley, on the edge of Manningtree, Essex, where his friendship deepened with other painters in East Anglia, in particular John Nash and Edward Bawden. There too he enjoyed a quietly civilized existence, a sense of quality and appreciation pervading every aspect of his domestic life.<br>
<br>In 1965 Coker was elected an associate of the Royal Academy, becoming an academician seven years later. His loyalty to this professional body was pronounced, even though he sometimes profoundly disagreed with its policies. Not only did its summer exhibitions offer a useful outlet for his work, but the academy twice made him a steward of the David Murray travel awards. In this role he travelled England, visiting students in different parts of the country. A fellow academician, Frederic Gore, was the first to observe that as he moved up the Pennine Way, through Yorkshire and into the South Tyne Valley, his attitude to landscape began to change. Formerly it had provided him with subjects on which he could exercise the practice of good painting: now he became more aware of how the surrounding landscape was constantly changing owing to effects of light, weather, and the seasons. His increased alertness to its mobility, combined with the large sweep of certain northern scenes, inclined him towards the use of thinner paint. He made studies in watercolour on the spot and a few small oils, but the larger paintings he continued to reconstruct from sketches and memory in his studio. Throughout his career his work attracted a strong following among private collectors, and prime examples entered most of the national collections and many public art galleries.<br>
<br>There was a noticeable change in the tenor of Coker's work after the death of his highly talented son in 1985, as became visible in a series of paintings made at Badenscallie in north-west Scotland, of salmon nets strung out to dry. Then in 1990 he suffered two serious heart attacks and a debilitating stroke. Earlier, in 1959, he had been diagnosed with Cushing's syndrome, which had been followed by a major operation to remove his adrenal glands. Now, once again, he was beset with a series of medical problems. With Vera's help he continued to work, but gave up in 1992, owing to physical difficulties. However, his artistic sensibility remained active and was fed by his voracious interest in exhibitions and books and by travel, even in circumstances that were sometimes far from easy. Then after ten years, though now confined to a wheelchair, his pent-up creativity burst out in a fresh bout of endeavour, stimulated by the rediscovery of a set of drawings he had made in Paris some twenty years before. An astonishing body of work developed over a short space of time and it formed an exhibition that opened at the Graves Art Gallery, Sheffield, in 2004 and subsequently toured to other places. He died on 16 December 2004 at the Oaks Hospital, Colchester, Essex, to the end intensely aware that he was a proud inheritor and exponent of a great artistic tradition. He was survived by his wife.<br>
