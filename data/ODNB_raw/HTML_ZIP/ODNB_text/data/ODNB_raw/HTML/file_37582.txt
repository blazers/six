<span class="headword">Humphrys, Sir  Francis Henry</span>  (1879&#150;1971), <span class="occ">colonial administrator and diplomatist</span>, was born in Beatrice Street, Oswestry, Shropshire, on 24 April 1879, the eldest son of the Revd Walter Humphrys, assistant master at Oswestry grammar school, and his wife, Helen Agnes, daughter of the Revd Alfred Francis Boucher. He was educated at Shrewsbury School (1893&#150;8), where he was captain of cricket and head of the school, and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated with a third class in classical honour moderations in 1900. In the same year he joined the 2nd Worcestershire regiment as a second lieutenant and served in the South African War.<br>
<br>In 1902 Humphrys began his career in the Indian political service, much of which was spent among the tribes of the North-West Frontier Province. At Peshawar on 2 April 1907 he married Gertrude Mary (<i>b</i>. 1882), daughter of Sir Harold Arthur Deane, the first chief commissioner of the North-West Frontier Province. During the First World War he was political agent with the Waziristan frontier force, and also held a temporary commission in the RAF as a pilot (1918), an experience which instilled in him a lifelong enthusiasm for flying, culminating in his being made an honorary air commodore. After the war Humphrys became political agent of the Khyber (1919), and deputy foreign secretary of the government of India (1921), a post which he held until 1922, when he was appointed British minister to Afghanistan.<br>
<br>Three years before Humphrys's arrival in Kabul, King Amanullah had launched the Third Anglo-Afghan War, which ended in Afghanistan's gaining the right to control its own foreign relations. Amanullah's pursuit of his two most cherished objectives&#151;the modernization of his country in the shortest possible time and independence from Britain&#151;soon brought him into headlong conflict with Humphrys, whose previous eighteen years in India, mostly among the tribes across the frontier from Afghanistan, had not prepared him to deal with a ruler of such independence of mind. In addition Humphrys seems to have had some difficulty in adjusting to the fact that Afghanistan was no longer a dependency of British India.<br>
<br>Matters came to a head in summer 1928 after Amanullah's return from an eight-month visit to Europe. He immediately announced a wide-ranging programme of social and political reforms, which appears to have aroused the wrath of the tribes. In late autumn Kabul was besieged by rebel forces, and Amanullah was eventually forced to abdicate. Early in 1929 Humphrys supervised the safe aerial evacuation of several hundred Europeans from the city (a pioneering feat of aviation in sub-zero temperatures over high mountain ranges); both he and his wife were commended for their &#145;courage and fortitude&#146; in the House of Commons on 4 February, and Gertie, as she was known, was made a DBE. The extent of British involvement in the revolt remains a matter of conjecture, but Humphrys and his colleagues warmly supported the candidature of Nadir Khan, Amanullah's successor, and vigorously opposed Amanullah's attempt to stage a comeback from his retreat in Kandahar. At the time his conduct was given the mark of government approval: having already been appointed KBE in 1924 and GCVO in 1928, he was now promoted to KCMG.<br>
<br>In autumn 1929 Humphrys was appointed high commissioner to the British-mandated state of Iraq. He stayed for six years, becoming the first British ambassador to the newly independent state in 1932. The decision to support Iraq's candidature for the League of Nations had been taken just before Humphrys's arrival, but some misgivings were expressed about the lack of guarantees for the Assyrian and Kurdish minorities after the transition to independence. For his part Humphrys maintained with some justice that any binding provision would not be compatible with the country's independent status. Unfortunately subsequent events, particularly the tragic fate of the Assyrians in the summer of 1933, showed the minorities' fears to have been well founded.<br>
<br>In 1932 Humphrys was further promoted to GCMG, and in 1935 he left public service for a career in the City. He presided over the creation of the British Sugar Corporation, served as its chairman between 1935 and 1949, and was also chairman of a number of other companies, including the Iraq Petroleum Company (1941&#150;50). He took a keen interest in sport throughout his life; he is said to have bowled out W. G. Grace three times while at Oxford. Photographs show a distinguished proconsular figure with a commanding presence. He died after a brief illness on 28 August 1971 at Edgecombe Nursing Home, Hamstead Marshall, near Newbury, Berkshire. He was survived by his wife, a son, and two daughters.<br>
