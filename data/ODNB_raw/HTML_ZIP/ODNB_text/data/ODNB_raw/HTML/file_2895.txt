<span class="headword">Booth,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1755&#150;1835), <span class="occ">stock breeder</span>, was the owner and farmer of the estate of Killerby, near Catterick, Yorkshire, but little is known about his origins. In 1790 he turned his attention to the breeding of shorthorn cattle, selecting his cows from Mr Broader of Fairholme, and the bulls from the stock of Robert and Charles Colling. His aim was to raise animals that would be suitable for both beef and milk production. In breeding them he tried to reduce the bone of the animal, especially the length and coarseness of the legs, the prominence of the hips, the heavy bones of the shoulders, and the shoulder points, which previously were great defects in the unimproved shorthorns. Booth was very successful, and for many years his cows and bulls carried away the top prizes at the chief exhibitions of stock. By 1814 he was considered to be the best cattle breeder in the area.<br>
<br>Booth moved to Warlaby, Yorkshire, in 1819, and gave up the Killerby estate and part of the shorthorn herd to his eldest son, John Booth; he took the remainder with him to Warlaby, where he died in 1835. He and his wife, formerly Miss Bower, had two sons, also well known as cattle breeders.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_2886"></a><span class="headword">John Booth</span>  (1779&#150;1857), the eldest son of Thomas Booth, had his own ideas about breeding stock, and in the pastures near Richmond, Yorkshire, he found fresh crosses for his cattle. He also ran horses at Catterick, and his dog, Nips, won the Wensleydale cup in a coursing contest at Leyburn. For three seasons he was master of the Bedale hunt, and a constant attendant at the meets. Much of his time was occupied in acting as a judge at exhibitions of livestock. All his own stock were sold off on 21 September 1852, when forty-four lots averaged &pound;48 12<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. Booth married Miss Wright in 1819 and they had several sons. He died at Killerby on 7 July 1857, and was buried nearby, at Ainderby. Shortly afterwards a window to his memory was erected in Catterick church.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_2890"></a><span class="headword">Richard Booth</span>  (1788&#150;1864), the second son of Thomas Booth, in 1814 moved a few miles south of his father to Studley Farm, which he soon stocked with shorthorns. He was a great believer in inbreeding, and by 1834 his best cows were fine animals in direct descent from his own bull, Twin Brother, to Ben, a bull bred by his father in 1790. He gave up Studley Farm in 1834, and sold off the whole of his herd except Isabella by Pilot, and retired to Sharrow, near Ripon. On the death of his father in the following year he succeeded to the estate and the shorthorn herd at Warlaby, and again turned his attention to breeding. The judges of those days had not yet learned to distinguish between flesh and fat, and although the Booth cattle did not always carry away the prizes, they made the best carcass meat. When the royal cattle shows began in 1844, though not approving of such exhibitions, Richard Booth felt obliged to exhibit; and although at first the quality of his cattle was not understood, it was not very long before his name was often found in the lists of those receiving medals and other rewards. He died at Warlaby on 31 October 1864.<br>
