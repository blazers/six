<span class="headword">Herewald</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1104/1107), <span class="occ">bishop in south-east Wales and the border</span>, had jurisdiction over an area that by the early twelfth century had been assimilated to Llandaff. No certain details are known about his consecration. In the twelfth-century <span class="roman">Book of Llandaff</span>, he is treated as the successor to Bishop Joseph (<i>d</i>. 1045) and called bishop of Llandaff, but the title is anachronistic and the statements as to the personnel present at his consecration, and its date and place, are contradictory and formulaic. There survives, moreover, a claim originating from St David's that he was consecrated neither by Archbishop Cynesige of York, nor by Archbishop Lanfranc of Canterbury (as the <span class="roman">Book of Llandaff</span> variously states), but by Joseph of St David's. All three versions may belong to the context of the dispute between St David's and Llandaff over episcopal jurisdiction in the twelfth century. It is possible that Herewald did not, in fact, succeed Joseph. The <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> records the death of a Welsh bishop Tremerig in 1052, who also seems to have been active in south-east Wales. He may have been Herewald's predecessor. Circumstances on the Herefordshire&#150;Wales border at this time, particularly the death in battle of Bishop Leofgar of Hereford in 1056, make the involvement of Cynesige in Herewald's consecration more plausible, as the bishop of Worcester, who administered Hereford for four years after Leofgar's death, was traditionally subordinate to York rather than Canterbury.<br>
<br>Very little is known of Herewald's career, outside his temporary suspension by Archbishop Anselm between 1093 and 1100, for reasons now obscure. His name suggests that he may not have been Welsh by birth, or at least that he had partly English ancestry. Accounts of his actions described in the narrations of charters in the <span class="roman">Book of Llandaff</span> cannot be taken as completely reliable. It may be that the attempt in these charters to associate him with all the overlords of Morgannwg in the later eleventh century, from Gruffudd ap Llywelyn (<i>d</i>. 1063/4) to Roger de Breteuil, is particularly suspicious, as it has the effect of associating him not only with the whole range of territory claimed by Llandaff in the twelfth century, but also with almost all the secular sources of power. A list of churches consecrated by him, found in the same volume, appears, interestingly, to locate him mainly in the border area of Ergyng. Again, however, the reliability of this material cannot be assumed: it might represent an attempt to promote Llandaff's claims against the see of Hereford. The <span class="roman">Book of Llandaff</span> credits Herewald with two sons, Mai and Lifris. The latter is associated with the church of Llancarfan, and is probably the author of the life of Cadog. The former may perhaps be identifiable with the Maius who testified to Pope Honorius II regarding the extent of the diocese of Llandaff <i>c</i>.1129. It may be, therefore, that one or both of Herewald's sons were involved in promoting Llandaff's claims (and contributed, therefore, to the problems surrounding the evidence for their father's career).<br>
<br>Herewald died on 6 March 1104, according to the <span class="roman">Book of Llandaff</span>; an interpolated entry in <span class="italic">Brenhinedd y Saesson</span> places his death in 1107. The former is more likely.<br>
