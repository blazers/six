<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sedley, Sir  Charles</span>, fifth baronet  (<em>bap. </em>1639, <em>d.</em> 1701), <span class="occ">writer and politician</span>, was baptized on 5 March 1639 at St Clement Danes in the Strand, London. His place of birth was probably his wealthy family's town house in Shire Lane near by. He was the youngest of nine children of Sir John Sedley, second baronet (<i>c</i>.1594&#150;1638), of Southfleet, Kent, who had died on 13 August 1638, and Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1595, <i>d</i>. after 1651), daughter and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24737/', "Sir Henry Savile")</script>, provost of Eton College. On 22 March 1656, after a private education, he entered Wadham College, Oxford, where his tutor was the poet and epicurean wit Walter Pope. Sedley succeeded to the family title in April 1656 on the death from measles of his brother William, having survived the same malady himself.<br>
<br>On 9 February 1657 Sedley married Catherine Savage (<i>c</i>.1640&#150;1705), daughter of John Savage, second Earl Rivers, and sister to the widow of Sedley's brother Henry, third baronet (<i>d</i>. 1641). The couple set up house in Great Queen Street. On 7 March 1660 Sedley was appointed one of the (royalist) commissioners to reconstitute the militia in Kent and in October became a captain of the Kent volunteer horse. Aged twenty-one at the Restoration, Sedley took enthusiastically to the pleasures of the court and town, often in the company of Charles Sackville, Lord Buckhurst, later sixth earl of Dorset. His witty conversation and the fact that he &#145;never asked the king for any thing&#146; made him a favourite drinking companion of Charles II. On 16 June 1663 Sedley, Buckhurst, and Sir Thomas Ogle provoked a riot through their drunken antics on the balcony of The Cock tavern in Bow Street. Sedley confessed to &#145;showing himself naked on a balcony, and throwing down bottles (pissed in) <i>vi et armis</i> among the people&#146;: second-hand accounts add further enormities (Keble, 1.168; Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1099). For this he was briefly imprisoned and heavily fined. Gossip recorded by Pepys and references to Sedley in the fugitive satire of the time consistently represent him as a debauchee; however, he was also respected as a wit and man of fashion. On at least two occasions Pepys found his chatter in the theatre audience more entertaining than what was taking place on the stage  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 4 Oct 1664, 18 Feb 1667). Dryden in dedicating <span class="italic">The Assignation</span> (1672) to Sedley is at pains to present him as a civilized advocate of &#145;<i>erudita voluptas</i>&#146; with no resemblance to the wild wit of legend. Sedley's rhymed oath for the &#145;ballers&#146;, reports of whose libertine behaviour so horrified Pepys, is a relatively temperate document, enjoining fidelity in love &#145;when one proves truly kind&#146; and avoidance of those &#145;that know not to say no&#146;. He appears to have liked dancing but not music and was a keen player of royal tennis.<br>
<br>In 1663 Sedley, Buckhurst, Waller, Sidney Godolphin, and Sir Edward Filmer contributed an act each to a translation in rhyme of Corneille's <span class="italic">La mort de Pomp&eacute;e</span>, which after a showing at court was given by the Duke's company at Lincoln's Inn Fields during the winter of 1663&#150;4. He may also have contributed to a lost translation of the same dramatist's <span class="italic">Heraclius</span>. Three subsequent plays written for the professional stage, <span class="italic">The Mulberry Garden</span> (1668), <span class="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</span> (1677), and <span class="italic">Bellamira</span> (1687), show him to have been a gifted dramatist, though not of the first rank. Sedley's verse of the early Restoration years, written for manuscript circulation, has not survived in any quantity. The satire &#145;Timon&#146;, usually ascribed to Rochester, is given to him in several manuscript sources. The indecent lyric &#145;In the fields of Lincoln's Inn&#146; is more likely to be by him than by Rochester. Some song lyrics and love poems appear in the printed miscellanies of the 1670s. Sedley's high standing as a critic was acknowledged when Dryden introduced him anagramatically as &#145;Lisideius&#146;, the champion of contemporary French drama, in the dialogue <span class="italic">Of Dramatic Poesy</span> (1668). He is named with Buckhurst in Rochester's &#145;An Allusion to Horace&#146; (1675) as one of an inner circle of trusted literary judges. He was a friend and patron of Shadwell who acknowledged his revising hand in <span class="italic">A True Widow</span> (1678).<br>
<br>In the late 1660s Catherine Sedley, after showing symptoms of insanity, was consigned to a convent at Ghent where she remained until her death in 1705. The daughter of the marriage, the witty <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25020/', "Catharine Sedley (1657&#150;1717)")</script>, became the mistress of the duke of York, who, in 1686, created her countess of Dorchester. In April 1672 Sedley went through a form of bigamous marriage with Ann Ayscough (<i>d</i>. 1708), and moved house to Bloomsbury Square. The character Medley in his friend Etherege's comedy <span class="italic">The Man of Mode</span> (1676) represents him in his prime as a man of wit and pleasure. A satiric view from two or three years later is more patronizing:<blockquote>
<div>Expecting supper is his great delight,<br>
</div>
<div>He toils all day but to be drunk at night;<br>
</div>
<div>Then o'er his cups this chirping nightbird sits<br>
</div>
<div>Till he takes Hewitt and Jack Howe for wits.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Poems on Affairs of State</span>, 1.411)</blockquote>The first line quoted is clarified by Carlos (probably another portrait) in <span class="italic">A True Widow</span>: &#145;I hate a dinner, 'tis a good meal for a dull plodding fellow of business &hellip; but the supper is the meal of pleasure and enjoyment&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Works of Thomas Shadwell</span>, 3.293).<br>
<br>Sedley was turned to more serious courses by being injured in the collapse of a tennis court in January 1681 and a major illness in 1686. He seems to have been reconciled with the church at this time, and to have written a now lost poem on the Trinity. A later panegyric of marriage, &#145;The Happy Pair&#146;, may be regarded as penance for his errors of the flesh. It is from this period too that he becomes actively engaged in politics.<br>
<br>The circle of court wits which included Sedley, Buckhurst, and Rochester were all under the spell of George Villiers, second duke of Buckingham. Sedley and Buckhurst accompanied him on his splendid embassy to Louis XIV in 1670. They followed Buckingham into opposition in 1673 after the fall of the Cabal ministry and were anti-Yorkists at the time of the <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span> crisis. In February 1677 Sedley was listed by Shaftesbury as &#145;doubly worthy&#146;. In 1678 he assisted in the translation of Coleman's letters, then regarded as the principal documentary evidence for the alleged Popish Plot  (Pinto, 310&#150;11). In 1681 he was the dedicatee of John Crowne's anti-Catholic <span class="italic">Henry the Sixth: the First Part</span>. Shadwell's dedication to him of <span class="italic">The Tenth Satire of Juvenal</span> (1687) was also a whig political gesture. Sedley had entered the House of Commons in May 1668 as one of two members for New Romney, Kent, and sat in every subsequent parliament during his lifetime with the exception of that of James II (when he declined to stand) and the first of William and Mary. A supporter of the revolution but a whig of the &#145;anti-court&#146; variety, he spoke with good sense and moderation in the parliaments after 1688. A speech against placemen and heavy war taxation delivered on 31 March 1690 was widely circulated in printed form. Having asked Charles II for nothing he maintained his principled independence under William except in the matter of procuring a knighthood for his son, Charles, with Ann Ayscough. This young man, to whom Sedley was deeply attached, was active in 1695 in opposing press-ganging for William's armies in Flanders.<br>
<br>Sedley's best writing is found in his lyrical and satirical verse, much of which is of great distinction. His translation of Horace's <span class="italic">Carmina</span>, 2.8 has been much admired. The love lyrics, which include the much anthologized &#145;Love still has something of the sea&#146;, are consistently inventive and well turned. He shared Dorset's admiration for the power and simplicity of the popular ballad, and could write well in the ballad manner himself. The sombre &#145;Ballad to the Tune of Bateman&#146;, narrating the murder of the whig lawyer John Hoyle, demonstrates how political satire can become more effective through restraint. It is likely that verse written against James II and his court remains unidentified in the manuscript miscellanies of the time. Although Dryden compared him with Tibullus, the strongest classical influence on his writing was that of Martial, whom Sedley imitated and translated with great flair. His sure touch as an epigrammist is apparent from the following distich: &#145;Thou swearst thou'lt drink no more: kind heaven send / Me such a cook or coachman, but no friend.&#146; His later verse and a few speeches are preserved in the 1702 <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works</span> and its enlarged reprint of 1707.<br>
<br>Sedley died at Hampstead on 20 August 1701 &#145;like a philosopher without fear or superstition&#146;  (<span class="italic">Buccleugh MSS</span>, 2.793), and was buried at Southfleet church, Kent, on 26 August. By the time of his death, high living and generosity had left his estate encumbered with mortgages. He never acquired his daughter's art of pillaging the public purse, though a late letter to Dorset quoted by Pinto  (pp. 207&#150;8) shows him making an attempt. However, his heirs were able to repair much of the damage. He had descendants through his illegitimate son, Charles (<i>d</i>. 1701), who narrowly predeceased him, and the children of the countess of Dorchester. William Oldys claimed to have seen a settlement relating to two illegitimate daughters with the surname Charlot. The eldest of Dorchester's children, Lady Katherine Darnley, later duchess of Buckingham (1679&#150;1743), was acknowledged by James II but may have been the child of Colonel James Grahme. Her other surviving child, Charles, was the issue of her marriage to David Colyear, earl of Portmore. The family tree printed by Pinto  (pp. x&#150;xi) shows a remarkable array of distinguished and talented descendants, among them the eugenicist Sir Francis Galton, who would no doubt have seen more than chance in the matter.<br>
