<span class="headword">Warton,  Thomas</span>  (1688&#150;1745), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and poet</span>, was born in 1688 in Godalming, Surrey, where he was baptized on 3 February 1688, the son of the Revd Anthony Warton (1650&#150;1715), and his wife, Mary. He matriculated from Hart Hall, Oxford, on 9 April 1706, but shortly after migrated to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was a demy from 1706 to 1717, and a fellow from 1717 to 1724. He proceeded BA (1710), MA (1712), BD (1725), and was elected professor of poetry in succession to Joseph Trapp on 17 July 1718, a post he held until 1728, having been re-elected in July 1723 for a second five-year term. He is chiefly remembered at Oxford for his Jacobite sympathies, engendered initially when he circulated a number of his poems&#151;most notably <span class="italic">The Turnip Hoer</span>, a satire on George I's suggestion of turning St James's Park into a turnip patch. His boldest act, however, was delivering a Jacobite sermon on 29 May 1719 at the university church. In it he spoke of the evil in dethroning a rightful king and setting up a usurper. Even though the sermon used Charles I and Cromwell as reference points, George I and the Stuart Pretender were clearly intended and taken as such by the audience who waved their caps as Warton left the church and &#145;his health was the toast of the night&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 7.15).<br>
<br>On 2 February 1721 Warton married Elizabeth (1691&#150;1762), second daughter of the Revd Joseph Richardson, rector of Dunsfold, Surrey, and Elizabeth Peebles. In 1723 when Magdalen College presented Warton with the living of Basingstoke in Hampshire, he left Oxford for Basingstoke where he also became master of the grammar school. Among his pupils was the naturalist Gilbert White. He remained at Basingstoke until his death and held successively with the living the vicarages of Framfield, Sussex (1726), Woking, Surrey (1727&#150;30), and Chobham, Surrey (1730&#150;45). Two of Warton's children were born in Basingstoke: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40740/', "Jane Warton")</script> in 1724 and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28799/', "Thomas Warton")</script> in 1728, while <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28796/', "Joseph Warton")</script> was baptized at Dunsfold, Surrey, in 1722. In 1738 Warton was elected to a lectureship in Basingstoke that had been established for the &#145;maintenance of a good and learned preacher&#146;, who was to &#145;instruct the people in the principles of religion&#146;  (Baigent and Millard, 403). The honorarium was &pound;50. Warton was a friend of Elijah Fenton, Edward Young, and was introduced to Alexander Pope, to whom he gave his copy of <span class="italic">Gorboduc</span>, by Pope's friend the Hon. Robert Digby.<br>
<br>Warton died at Basingstoke on 10 September 1745 and was buried in Basingstoke church. A memorial erected in the church by his family was displaced during renovations and a new memorial was subsequently erected by Victorian descendants of Joseph Warton. As a way of paying off the debts owed by his father at his death, Joseph Warton proposed publishing a volume of his father's poems by subscription. This volume, <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span>, appeared in March 1748 and increased Warton's reputation as a poet. It was subsequently praised as a transitional volume containing poems typical of the early part of the century and some which appeared to anticipate later poets. However, modern scholarship has determined that many of the poems previously thought to be somewhat forward reaching were, in fact, written by Warton's sons, Joseph and Thomas, or heavily edited by them.<br>
