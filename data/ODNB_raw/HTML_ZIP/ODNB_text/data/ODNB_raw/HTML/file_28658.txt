<span class="headword">Walton,  Valentine</span>  (1593/4&#150;1661), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer and regicide</span>, was the son of Nicholas Walton. His father, a member of a younger branch of an old gentry family in Huntingdonshire, died when he was young, certainly by 1606 when Valentine at the age of twelve inherited the manor of Great Staughton in that county from his grandfather's cousin. His inheritance, estimated in 1640 as about &pound;400 per annum, did not go uncontested: a kinsman unsuccessfully challenged it in 1624 before both the privy council and the House of Commons and by illegally occupying the manor house of Great Staughton. Walton was for a time a ward of Sir Oliver Cromwell of Hinchinbrook, the leading figure in the county until the 1620s. On 20 June 1617 Walton married Sir Oliver's niece, Margaret Cromwell (<i>bap</i>. 1601), daughter of Robert Cromwell of Huntingdon and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6765/', "Oliver Cromwell")</script>, the future lord protector. They had at least four sons and at least one daughter. Margaret had evidently died by July 1644, when her brother wrote a letter to Walton which did not mention her among the kin he asked to be remembered to. Walton's second wife, the daughter of one Pym of Brill, Buckinghamshire, and widow of one Austen of the same place, died on 14 November 1662 and was buried in St Mary's Church, Oxford.<br>
<br>During the 1630s Walton consistently opposed attempts to levy non-parliamentary taxation, though he appears to have met demands for knighthood and ship money at least half-way. He was imprisoned for defaulting 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. on payment of the latter, for example. However, his stance evidently won him a sufficient number of admirers for him to be returned MP for Huntingdonshire in the election to the Long Parliament in October 1640. Despite his own relatively modest place within the ranks of county society (an observer described him as &#145;a private obscure gentleman&#146;) he was able to overcome the nominee of the powerful Henry Cromwell, the son of his former guardian  (Keeler, <span class="italic">Long Parliament</span>, 379). In parliament he sat on a number of important committees. His puritan commitment is indicated by his inclusion on a subcommittee of the grand committee on religion and on another committee to consider &#145;An Act for the Abolishing of Superstition and Idolatry and for the Better Advancing of the True Worship and Service of God&#146;&#151;on both committees alongside his brother-in-law. In 1642 he helped Cromwell prevent Cambridge University sending its plate to the king at Nottingham, raised a troop of horse to serve under the earl of Essex, and was taken prisoner by the royalists at the battle of Edgehill. During his confinement he was treated kindly by Thomas Laurence, the master of Balliol College and the Lady Margaret professor of divinity. Walton later reciprocated this generosity in obtaining for Laurence the chapelry of Colne in the parish of Somersham, Huntingdonshire, endowing the living with its tithes before installing Laurence after his ejection from Oxford.<br>
<br>In July 1643 Walton was exchanged for Sir Thomas Lunsford and became colonel of a regiment of foot in the army of the eastern association and governor of King's Lynn. Under his government Lynn, which had recently been seized and briefly held by the royalists, was strongly fortified and, according to the gossip of the royalists, reserved as a city of refuge for the Independents should the need arise. By May 1644 he was commanding a regiment of dragoons. In July his second but eldest surviving son, Valentine, was killed at Marston Moor. Cromwell's letter to Walton combined condolence&#151;&#145;a precious young man, fit for God&#146;&#151;with exultation in the victory; young Valentine had died in a state of spiritual comfort, regretting only &#145;that God had not suffered him to be no more the executioner of His enemies&#146;  (<span class="italic">Writings and Speeches</span>, 1.288). Although he had a hand in his brother-in-law's quarrel with the earl of Manchester Walton was ruled out from military command with the passage subsequently of the self-denying ordinance. He held no commission in the New Model Army.<br>
<br>In 1649 Walton was appointed one of the king's judges, in which capacity he attended most of the sittings of the court, and signed the warrant for the execution of Charles I [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. Under the Commonwealth he was a member of all the five councils of state appointed by parliament and acted as an admiralty commissioner, but he did not sit either in the parliaments or councils of the protectorate. When Richard Cromwell became protector and called a parliament, Walton, who thought of being a candidate, was obliged to vindicate himself from the charge of being opposed to the government. Nevertheless he was not elected; but when Richard Cromwell was overthrown he returned to his seat in the Long Parliament, and was elected by it a member of the council of state and one of the commissioners of the navy. On 12 October 1659, when the parliament annulled Charles Fleetwood's commission as commander-in-chief, Walton was one of the seven persons in whom the control of the army was vested. Acting in that capacity, Walton, aided by Sir Arthur Hesilrige, occupied Portsmouth, declared against the army leaders, and entered into communication with George Monck. When the troops in London restored the Long Parliament for the second time, Walton was given command of the regiment lately Colonel Disbrowe's, and he was continued as one of the commissioners for the government of the army until 21 February 1660, when Monck was appointed commander-in-chief. His temporary importance then ended, and he was deprived of his regiment by Monck, who gave it to Colonel Charles Howard.<br>
<br>At the Restoration Walton was excepted from the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span>, and lost Somersham, Huntingdonshire, and other estates forming part of the dowry of Queen Henrietta Maria, which he had purchased during the period of republic. He escaped to Germany, and became a burgess of Hanau in order to obtain the protection of that town. His later history is uncertain. According to Anthony Wood he lived for some time in Flanders or the Low Countries, under a borrowed name, maintaining himself as a gardener, and died there soon after the Restoration. Mark Noble, the eighteenth-century historian of the Cromwell family, states that he died in 1661. Lavinia Walton (<i>bur</i>. 22 Jan 1667) and Elizabeth Walton (<i>bur</i>. 12 Oct 1669), who lived in the household of John Wilkins, warden of Wadham College, Oxford, may have been daughters of Walton, as Wilkins was married to Robina Cromwell, sister of Walton's first wife. Walton is said to have written a history of the civil wars, containing many original letters of Cromwell, the manuscript of which was still extant in 1733.<br>
