<span class="headword">Champion de Crespigny, Sir  Claude</span>, fourth baronet  (1847&#150;1935), <span class="occ">military adventurer and sportsman</span>, was born in Chelsea on 20 April 1847, the eldest son of Sir Claude Champion de Crespigny, third baronet (1818&#150;1868), of Wivenhoe Hall, Essex, and his wife, Mary, second daughter of Sir J. Tyssen Tyrell, bt, MP. He attended Temple Grove School, East Sheen, until the age of thirteen, when he entered the navy, serving as a midshipman in the <i>Warrior</i> in 1862. In 1866 he transferred to the army as an ensign, and was with the King's Royal Rifle Corps (60th) in Ireland and India. In 1867 he won the first of the many steeplechases in a racing career spanning nearly fifty years. He succeeded to the baronetcy the following year. Sir Claude considered fighting, whether with fists or pistols, to be a manly occupation, and he engaged in fisticuffs until his seventies. He devoted his life to the maxim: &#145;Where there is a daring deed to be done in any part of the world, an Englishman should leap to the front to accomplish it&#146;  (Champion de Crespigny, <span class="italic">Sportsman's Life</span>, 221).<br>
<br>In 1870, irked by the restrictions of army life, Sir Claude resigned his commission to embark on the strenuous and dangerous pursuits he was to follow for the rest of his life. These included joining the Garde Cuirassiers, a German cavalry regiment, as a volunteer during the Franco-Prussian War, and being arrested as a spy three times by the French on his way home. He spent the next decade in the west country and Ireland, where his daring in the hunting field earned him the title of the &#145;Mad Rider&#146;. While training with the Limerick artillery militia he saved a man from drowning, a feat he had first performed at the age of fifteen. A fearless swimmer, canoeist, and single-handed sailor, he attributed his confidence in rough seas to his grandfather, a naval officer who had saved so many lives that he was known as the &#145;Newfoundland Dog&#146;.<br>
<br>On 19 September 1872 Sir Claude married Georgiana Louisa Margaret (<i>d</i>. 16 Feb 1935), second daughter of Robert McKerrel of Hillhouse, and they had five sons and four daughters. In 1880 he returned to Essex, and combined serving as a captain in the Suffolk yeomanry with his steeplechasing career (he found flat racing too dull), often riding three or four races in a day. A fall in one race left him unconscious from a kick in the head. After two days in bed he rolled his cricket ground, took a Turkish bath the next day, and rode in two more races the day after. His distaste for heavy betting set him apart from other gentleman riders of the time, as did the strenuous physical regimen he followed all his life.<br>
<br>In 1882 Sir Claude took up ballooning, and in July 1883 became the first man to cross the North Sea, winning the Balloon Society's gold medal for this feat. In 1886 he caused considerable comment when he assisted at the execution of three murderers at Carlisle. Having been advised that he might shortly become high sheriff for Essex, and therefore responsible for executions within the county, he considered it his duty to ensure he knew what was involved.<br>
<br>Sir Claude became the first European to swim the Nile rapids in 1889 and, ten years later, he and his wife went out to join their three sons in the South African War. He saw action as a scout with Porter's cavalry, while his wife nursed the wounded. Another visit to Africa in 1905 enabled him to combine &#145;a certain amount of fighting&#146; in the Sotik punitive expedition on the Uganda/Kenya border with big-game hunting, including shooting a charging rhinoceros at three paces.<br>
<br>In 1914, at the age of sixty-seven, Sir Claude rode in his last steeplechase, and thereafter devoted himself to the more leisurely pursuits, as he saw them, of sailing, swimming, high diving, and long-distance walking. Lean of face and of spare build, he was proud that his weight was still only 10&frac12; stone.<br>
<br>Sir Claude published his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> in 1896 and <span class="italic">Forty Years of a Sportsman's Life</span> in 1910 (new edn, 1925). He died at his home, Champion Lodge, Maldon, Essex, on 26 June 1935, and was buried in a mausoleum he had built in the grounds for his eldest son, who died in 1910. In the 1950s he was reburied in Hatfield Peverel churchyard.<br>
