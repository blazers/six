<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Doherty,  (Hugh) Lawrence <span class="st"> [Laurie]</span></span>  (1875&#150;1919), <span class="occ">tennis player</span>, was born on 8 October 1875 at Beulah Villa, Hartfield Road, Wimbledon, Surrey, the son of William Doherty, a printer, later of Clapham Park, London, and his wife, Catherine Ann Davis. His elder brother <a name="cosubject_66807"></a><span class="headword">Reginald Frank <span class="st"> [Reggie]</span> Doherty</span>  (1872&#150;1910), also a <span class="occ">tennis player</span>, was born at the same address on 14 October 1872. Both brothers were educated at Westminster School (Reggie 1883&#150;90; Laurie 1890&#150;94) and then at Trinity Hall, Cambridge (Reggie 1894&#150;6; Laurie 1896&#150;8). There they made their names as tennis players, following the example of their eldest brother William Vernon Doherty (1871&#150;1936) of Westminster and Christ Church, Oxford, who represented Oxford University at lawn tennis in 1892 and 1893. Reggie gained lawn tennis blues for Cambridge University in 1895 and 1896, and Laurie, who at the age of fifteen won the most important junior tennis event of that time, the Renshaw cup at Scarborough, gained blues in 1896, 1897, and 1898.<br>
<br>Reggie Doherty won four consecutive All England singles championships at Wimbledon, his &#145;local&#146; club, in 1897&#150;1900, and with Charlotte Cooper he won the gold medal for mixed doubles at the Paris Olympics of 1900. With a perfect smash and volley game, Laurie Doherty won the Olympic men's singles in 1900. He was All England singles champion from 1902 to 1906, during which years he never lost a match in the Davis cup, despite meeting the best American players; indeed in 1903 he actually won the American championship, the only overseas player to do so between 1881 and 1925.<br>
<br>The Doherty brothers became a formidable doubles partnership, with Reggie's polished groundstrokes, particularly the backhand, complementing Laurie's more aggressive style. Nicknamed Big Do and Little Do, they were also a contrast in size, Reggie tall and very thin and Laurie not even medium height. Reggie relied much on anticipation, covering the court with apparent ease, whereas Laurie thought out the game more thoroughly. They were as expert on covered courts&#151;as at Queen's Club, Kensington, where some of their best games were played&#151;as on grass. Their doubles record was impressive: they were All England champions eight times between 1897 and 1905; Olympic gold-medal winners in 1900; American title holders twice, in 1902 and 1903; and unbeaten in the five Davis cup matches in which they played together.<br>
<br>After an arduous losing doubles final in 1906 neither brother played again at Wimbledon, reputedly as a promise to their mother, who feared for their health if they again overtaxed their strength. Reggie continued to play tennis, but only in selected major events, including the 1908 London Olympic games, where he again won the men's doubles, this time with George Hillyard. In 1909 he won two titles in South Africa but his health was failing. A few hours after returning from a Swiss nursing home, he died on 29 December 1910 of heart failure and neurasthenia at his home in the Albert Hall Mansions, Knightsbridge, which he shared with his brother.<br>
<br>Laurie Doherty abandoned competitive tennis and took up golf, where he achieved a handicap of plus two and in 1908 reached the last sixteen of the British amateur championship at his home course of Royal St George's. In 1914 he joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve but the rigours of wartime service in an anti-aircraft unit took its toll on his frail constitution. After two years suffering from tubercular nephritis and cystitis he died on 21 August 1919 of toxaemia at Leon Cottage, North Foreland, Kent. His father, with whom he lived at the Albert Hall Mansions, was with him when he died; neither of the brothers was married. The tennis feats of the brothers are commemorated by the Doherty gates at the south-western entrance to the All England club, Wimbledon.<br>
