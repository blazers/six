<span class="headword">Pitt,  James</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseuds. </em>Francis Osborne esq., Socrates, Publicola]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1714&#150;1755), <span class="occ">writer on politics</span>, was born in Norfolk; no details are known of his parentage or his upbringing. In early adulthood he was a freeholder in Heigham, Norfolk, and served as a schoolmaster, first in Norwich and later in Lincoln's Inn Fields, London. In the late 1720s Pitt emerged as a leading political writer, defending Sir Robert Walpole and his government from attacks published in <span class="italic">The Craftsman</span>, a weekly journal supported, and sometimes written, by Lord Bolingbroke and William Pulteney. Pitt wrote for two papers, the <span class="italic">London Journal</span> and, from 1735, the <span class="italic">Daily Gazetteer</span>, under the pseudonyms Francis Osborne esq., Socrates, and Publicola. His earliest attributable essay appeared on 18 February 1728, and he quickly gained a reputation, alongside William Arnall and Ralph Courteville, as one of Walpole's favoured writers. As Francis Osborne esq. his <span class="italic">London Journal</span> essays reached a wide audience in a paper which sold up to 5000 copies a week and which may have been read (or heard) by as many as 100,000. Throughout the late 1720s and the 1730s Pitt's contributions made him an influential figure among London's chattering classes, serving, according to one contemporary account, as &#145;the oracle of a political circle in George's Coffee House, temple-bar&#146;  (Nichols, 3.649). Alexander Pope conferred upon him the ultimate accolade for any pro-government writer: a reference in the <span class="italic">Dunciad</span> (1729), where he appeared as Mother Osborne, because of the &#145;Heaviness of his style&#146;, and was compared to Ovid's petrified and pathetic Niobe.<br>
<br>Pitt's essays covered a wide range of political, religious, and even philosophical subjects. However, his principal aim was to dismantle <span class="italic">The Craftsman</span>'s case against what its authors identified as the Walpolean &#145;robinocracy&#146;. It was largely as a result of Pitt's influence that the <span class="italic">London Journal</span> moved away from its earlier focus on literary as well as political issues to become a key platform for attacks on opposition journalism. Pitt held <span class="italic">The Craftsman</span> directly responsible for much of the anti-government feeling in the country. Selling sometimes as many as 13,000 copies a week, it &#145;scatter'd more dissatisfaction thro' the kingdom, than all other causes put together&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Journal</span>, 551, 21 Feb 1730). Pitt saw the motive for these attacks less in terms of policy difference than of the political jealousy of its principal sponsor, Bolingbroke: &#145;the <span class="italic">Craftsman</span> would never have seen the light, had not some gentlemen, whom he's acquainted with, been thrown out of power&#146;  (ibid., 581, 19 Sept 1730).<br>
<br>Yet Pitt's contribution was always more substantive than these personal attacks suggest. His weekly essays in both the <span class="italic">London Journal</span> and the <span class="italic">Daily Gazetteer</span> reveal a clear set of political ideas and an attachment to Walpolean whig principles which have been seen as a precursor to the political writings of David Hume. Pitt's thought was rooted in the experiences of the real world and he mocked opponents who based their criticism of Walpole in discussions of classical and contemporary political philosophy. By contrast, Pitt remained aware of humankind's imperfections, though he eschewed a Hobbesian view, believing people &#145;more happy living in society than by living singly&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Journal</span>, 653, 1 Jan 1732). Politicians had therefore to work within the limits of human ability though his optimistic view of human sociability made government a convenience rather than a necessity. A supporter of the post-1688 constitutional settlement, Pitt challenged Bolingbroke's view that Britons' liberty dated to the <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>, which he claimed had brought &#145;only some concessions to the churchmen and barons&#146;  (ibid., 769, 23 March 1734). Pitt's opponents accused him of apostasy, having departed from an earlier whig tradition of John Locke and Algernon Sidney in order to defend a corrupt government. Pitt, who boasted that he was &#145;as thorough a whig as any man now living, or that ever liv'd&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Gazetteer</span>, 132, 29 Nov 1735), maintained that members of the modern court whig party &#145;fully enjoy what the old whigs so gloriously contended for&#146;; as a result of these changing fortunes Pitt claimed that modern whigs were fully justified in moving away from late seventeenth-century theories of resistance since &#145;we have the end to which their opposition was the means&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Journal</span>, 733, 14 July 1733). Additional literary attacks against Pitt appeared in Henry Fielding's play <span class="italic">Pasquin</span> (1736); this followed on from reports of his having been beaten up by critics of Walpole's policy during the 1733 excise crisis  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 141). Pitt was nevertheless amply rewarded for his pains by Walpole. In March 1729 he was appointed to his first sinecure: tide surveyor at Portsmouth, which carried a salary of &pound;200 per annum. In June 1731 he earned promotion, becoming surveyor of tobacco in London, a post he was later rumoured to have sold for &pound;1100.<br>
<br>Pitt's final essay appeared in the <span class="italic">Daily Gazetteer</span> for 25 November 1738. A well-read journalist, he retired to his house in Essex Street, London, and to his books; a glimpse of his life in the 1740s and 1750s emerges from a handful of extant letters to Thomas Cook, the classical translator. A keen advocate for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span>, Pitt also published a pro-dissenting essay, &#145;On superstition&#146;, in the <span class="italic">London Journal</span> (1733), later mistakenly reprinted as a work by William Pitt, earl of Chatham. Pitt's death date remains unknown.<br>
