<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Despard,  Edward Marcus</span>  (1751&#150;1803), <span class="occ">army officer and revolutionary</span>, was born into a military family in Queen's county, Ireland, on 6 March 1751; the youngest of six sons of William Despard and his wife, Jane. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7549/', "John Despard (1743/4&#150;1829)")</script> was his brother. He joined the army as an ensign in 1766 and was promoted lieutenant in 1772, while stationed in Jamaica. He was a skilled military engineer and, working closely with Horatio Nelson, particularly distinguished himself in an expedition to capture Fort San Juan from Spain in 1779. Promoted captain in 1780 he continued to work as an engineer until his appointment in 1781 as commandant, first of the island of Roatan, off the Honduran coast, and then of British possessions in the Gulf of Honduras. In 1782, having overseen the defence of Jamaica against France and Spain, Despard headed an expedition of Jamaican settlers, assisted by British artillery, to recapture Spanish-occupied Black River territory in south-western Jamaica. For this he received royal commendation and was made a colonel of provincials.<br>
<br>In June 1786 Despard took up an appointment as superintendent of Honduras. Though he handled relations with the Spanish authorities well he was notably less adept as a civilian governor. His unswerving support for settlers displaced from territories recently ceded to Spain (many of whom he knew from San Juan and the Black River) led him into repeated conflict with the established British settler community, who complained repeatedly to London of his &#145;visible Spirit of Self-importance and uncontrollable Domination&#146;  (TNA: PRO, CO 123/6, 21 Feb 1788). Events culminated in his annulment (June 1789) of the colony's police and magistracy; Despard ruled by direct decree until, suspended on half pay, he was ordered to return to Britain, where he arrived in May 1790, accompanied by his African&#150;Caribbean wife, Catherine, and their son James.<br>
<br>Despard had to wait until October 1791 to learn that, while complaints against him were dismissed, he was not to be reinstated as superintendent of Honduras. In pursuit of compensation he grew increasingly irascible, while the combination of enforced idleness and grievance against authority led him to both the London Corresponding Society and the overtly revolutionary United Irishmen (UI). He quickly became an intimate of the leading United Irishman and French secret agent William Duckett and in 1797 was reported to be co-ordinator of a proposed rising in London planned to coincide with one in Ireland and a French landing there. In 1798 Despard was pivotal in negotiations between the United Irishmen and a broader conspiratorial group, the United Britons, to foment simultaneous English and Irish risings to assist a French invasion. When O'Connor and O'Coighley, the principal leaders of the conspiracy, were apprehended in February, while hiring a boat to take them to France, habeas corpus was suspended and further arrests followed. Despard's was predictably among them.<br>
<br>Despard seems to have been aware that the revolutionary threat had been contained by the government when, in June 1799, he petitioned for his release in return for voluntary transportation. Among political prisoners at this time he seems to have received the harshest treatment&#151;&#145;more like a common vagabond than a gentleman or State Prisoner&#146;, complained his wife, Catherine  (TNA: PRO, HO 42/43)&#151;and Sir Francis Burdett made Despard's case the centre of a campaign against the &#145;English Bastille&#146;.<br>
<br>When Despard was finally released, in March 1801, he returned to his family's Irish estate, apparently intending to take no further part in politics. However, in February 1802 he returned to London at the behest of the UI leader William Dowdall. After the collapse of the Irish rising of 1798 the United Irishmen had reconstituted itself as a small, centralized military body. Though Britain was now at peace with France food shortages and industrial unrest created a climate in which talk of revolution flourished. Despard now concentrated on enlisting the support of militant Irish labourers and guardsmen stationed in Windsor and London but intelligence sources also show him to have been in contact with Irish and French emissaries during the summer. Disaffected guardsmen tried to force the issue with a rising on 6 September but Despard restrained them, arguing that such action could be effective only if it coincided with an Irish rising and a French invasion; but then, on 16 November, Despard was arrested at the Oakly Arms, Lambeth, apparently planning a <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> to coincide with the opening of parliament later that month.<br>
<br>The circumstances behind Despard's arrest have been variously interpreted. The popular contemporary view that he was himself victim of a government conspiracy can be safely dismissed. At his trial in February 1803, before a special commission of the lord chief justice and other judges, the prosecution simply claimed that he was a psychotic maverick who had enticed a small band of unfortunates into supporting a futile plot. The prosecution, however, was restricted in the evidence that it could use; aside from issues of legal admissibility, public confidence might have suffered if the full extent of any conspiracy was revealed. Nor was it in the state's interest to reveal more than was absolutely necessary of its intelligence sources; records from the latter implicate a significant number of London Jacobins in the conspiracy, of whom the motley dozen soldiers and workmen tried with Despard were far from typical. Leeds magistrates had been told as early as June that &#145;Major General Despot&#146; would become &#145;commander in Chief of the Union&#146;  (Wells, 238&#150;9). The United Irish and Britons maintained separate structures and it appears to have been Despard's task to co-ordinate them. The only incriminating evidence found at his arrest was a printed card calling for &#145;the independence of Great Britain and Ireland. An equalization of Civil, Political, and Religious Rights; [and] an ample Provision for the families of the Heroes who shall fall in the contest&#146;. An oath of allegiance to the United Britons was appended  (<span class="italic">Trial of Edward Marcus Despard</span>, 64). Identical cards circulated in Lancashire and Yorkshire. Such points led Edward Thompson to argue, in <span class="italic">The Making of the English Working Class</span> (1963), that Despard was the leader of a nationwide revolutionary conspiracy. However it has also been suggested that &#145;there was no general <i>coup</i> planned for the opening of Parliament on 23rd November&#146;  (Elliott, &#145;Despard conspiracy&#146;, 57) and that Despard was a marginal figure in a rising actually intended for 1803. His arrest was simply an opportunist move by a government acting on fragmentary evidence.<br>
<br>Despard's defence was circumspect, wishing perhaps not to incriminate others but also aware that the prosecution case was uneven. He enjoyed wide popularity and Nelson himself gave evidence as to his good character: &#145;no man could have shewn more zealous attachment to his Sovereign and his Country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Trial of Edward Marcus Despard</span>, 174). Though finding him guilty the jury recommended mercy &#145;on account of his former services&#146;  (<span class="italic">BDMBR</span>, 119). The government, however, was not inclined to clemency. Whatever the truth of the conspiracy an exemplary verdict had been secured and punishment was enacted accordingly. On 21 February 1803, having taken leave of his wife and refusing all religious consolation, Despard was drawn on a hurdle to the Surrey county gaol, Newington, where, before a crowd reportedly of 20,000, he delivered from the scaffold a speech that was loudly cheered. Along with six co-conspirators he was hanged and his corpse decapitated, whereupon the executioner held up the head, declaring: &#145;This is the head of a traitor&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>). His widow received the remains, which on 1 March were buried in the churchyard by St Paul's Cathedral. Troops drafted into the area in anticipation of rioting were not needed. In his address from the scaffold Despard denied all charges of treason and claimed to be &#145;a friend to truth, to liberty, and to justice &hellip; to the poor and the oppressed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Full and Accurate Report</span>, 74). How far his politics stemmed from intellectual conviction and how far from personal resentment remains a moot point but in a letter to James Mill in 1817 Francis Place described Despard as an &#145;extraordinary&#146; man &#145;to whom I was indebted for some portion of the knowledge I possess and for whom I shall always maintain strong feelings of regard&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 35152, fol. 1).<br>
