<span class="headword">Ridge,  William  Pett</span>  (1859&#150;1930), <span class="occ">novelist and short-story writer</span>, was born at Chilham, near Canterbury, Kent, on 22 April 1859, the second son in the family of at least two sons and four daughters of James Ridge, a railway porter, later stationmaster, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pett. Very little is known of his early years, except that he was educated at Marden, Kent, where his father was stationmaster. When he went up to London in 1880, living at Deptford with his widowed mother, he attended evening classes at Birkbeck Literary and Scientific Institute (now Birkbeck College). During a long day from nine to seven o'clock he toiled as a clerk in the railway clearing house for 1 guinea per six-day week. Somehow he managed to find the energy to write, and in 1890 he published his first sketches of London life for the <span class="italic">St James Gazette</span> under the pseudonym Warwick Simpson.<br>
<br>Pett Ridge's first novel, <span class="italic">A Clever Wife</span> (1895), &#145;made more stir than most first novels do&#146;  (Adcock, 274), according to contemporary Arthur St John Adcock, but it was not until Pett Ridge's fifth, <span class="italic">Mord Em'ly</span> (1898), that he achieved popular success. Its appeal lay mainly in the feisty south London protagonist, Em'ly, and her defiance of authority, particularly philanthropists bent on improving her lot. For Em'ly there is no better place than her territory just south of Waterloo, where she possesses an identity as a member of a female gang, in striking anticipation of contemporary urban life. Pett Ridge does not depict London life in a grim or brutal way, however, as had Arthur Morrison in <span class="italic">A Child of the Jago</span> (1896). Instead, his characters enjoy their amusements much more fully than their drab, boring middle-class counterparts. This attitude became the signature motif of the so-called cockney school, and was initially received enthusiastically, with Pett Ridge &#145;boldly breaking away from the tragic convention of the slums&#146;  (Keating, 210). Cockney school novelists, including Henry Nevinson, Edwin Pugh, Arthur St John Adcock, and Pett Ridge did, however, owe a great deal to Dickens, particularly his portrayal of the virtuous poor; unlike Dickens, Pett Ridge's work as a whole explored the East End proper, that is, east of Aldgate pump. Later critics of Pett Ridge and the others saw their work as sentimental and facetious, an instrument for assuaging middle-class guilt.<br>
<br>On 28 February 1910 William Pett Ridge married Olga Hentschel (<i>b</i>. 1873/4), daughter of his friend Carl Hentschel, a newspaperman and editor of the London <span class="italic">Playgoer</span>. They had one son and a daughter. The other fictional terrain that Pett Ridge explored was suburbia, notably in <span class="italic">From Nine to Six-Thirty</span> (1910), and he became known for his portrayal of modern young women asserting their independence as clerks or typists.<br>
<br>Above all Pett Ridge was a humorist. This is captured in his description of meeting Mark Twain when he was introduced as &#145;the Mark Twain of England&#146;: &#145;&#147;What he meant to say&#148;, [Ridge] interrupted, &#147;was that you are the Pett Ridge of America&#148;. &#147;Ah&#148;, said the old man [Twain], taking my arm pleasantly, &#147;now I know we shall get along together&#148;&#146;  (Pett Ridge, 44). Pett Ridge's wit and geniality made him a popular after-dinner speaker and an eminently clubbable man; among others he joined the Yorrick and Boz clubs, was elected to the Garrick on nomination by J. M. Barrie, and latterly was president of the Omar Khayyam Club.<br>
<br>Pett Ridge had always taken an interest in children, especially those from the London slums, and he continued his charitable work there even after he moved his family to Ampthill, Willow Grove, Chislehurst, Kent, where he died on 29 September 1930. <span class="italic">The Times</span> obituary noted that he was an enthusiastic committee member of King Edward's Hospital Fund for London and observed that the capital would miss his &#145;kindly presence and never-failing humour&#146;  (quoted in Jasper, 303).<br>
<br>In photographs Pett Ridge, with his dark eyes and slightly hooded lids, seems solemn, and this deceptive appearance apparently served well his dry wit. Although he was prolific, producing over sixty novels and short-story collections as well as two charming memoirs, by the end of his career his literary following had drastically diminished. He is likely to remain a minor writer because he was innovative neither in style nor subject matter; his main flaw was that he ignored the devastating impact of severe deprivation on his east London characters and instead perpetuated the sentimental Victorian myth that cockneys with enough character could triumph over all obstacles.<br>
