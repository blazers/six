<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bingham, Sir  Richard</span>  (1527/8&#150;1599), <span class="occ">soldier and president of Connacht</span>, was the third son of Robert Bingham of Melcombe-Bingham, Dorset, and his wife, Alice, daughter of Thomas Coker of Mappowder in the same county. His elder brothers were Robert and Christopher; he also had two sisters and five younger brothers, Sir George, Roger, Sir John, Thomas, and Charles, two of whom, like him, served in Ireland. Richard Bingham pursued a military and naval career that took him to many parts of Europe. His earliest military adventure was apparently with Protector Somerset's expedition to Scotland in 1547. He served with the Spaniards against the French at the battle of St Quentin in 1557 and in October 1558 participated in a naval expedition against the &#145;out-isles&#146; of Scotland in which William Fitzwilliam was also involved. In the early years of Elizabeth's reign he fought against the Turks with the Spaniards and Venetians under Don John of Austria. He may have taken part in the conquest of Cyprus and the battle of Lepanto (7 October 1572). In 1573 and 1574 he was in the Low Countries reporting to Sir William Cecil from Delft and Dortrecht on the conflict with Spain. Late in 1576 he accompanied Sir Edward Horsey on an abortive mission to Don John to negotiate a peace between Spain and the states general of the United Provinces. In March 1578 Queen Elizabeth granted Bingham an annuity of 50 marks in recognition of his military and diplomatic services. Later in 1578 he fought as a volunteer under the Dutch flag against Spain. He was described by Sir Nicholas Le Strange as &#145;a man eminent both for spiritt and martiall knowledge, but of very small stature&#146;  (Thoms, 18).<br>
<br>In 1579 Bingham was sent to Ireland to assist in the suppression of the Desmond rebellion. He was captain of the <i>Swiftsure</i> in autumn 1580 which helped in the Munster offensive under Admiral Winter against the Spaniards and Italians who had landed at Smerwick harbour to support James Fitzmaurice. Bingham took part in the massacre of the garrison at D&uacute;n an &Oacute;ir on 10 November 1580 when a large number of Italians who had been offered protection were killed. After spending the winter off the Kerry coast, the <i>Swiftsure</i> reached Bristol on 9 January 1581. In August Bingham was among those put from the Portuguese voyage by Sir Francis Drake. Bingham was still serving with the <i>Swiftsure</i> late in 1583, being then an admiral. In September 1583 he was instructed by the queen to seize Dutch ships for debts due to her, while ostensibly working to apprehend pirates on the narrow seas.<br>
<br>Following the death of Sir Nicholas Malby in March 1584 Bingham was appointed as president of Connacht to succeed him. He was knighted by Sir John Perrot in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, on 21 June 1584. A commission for martial law was issued to him on 8 July, and a commission for military government of the province was issued at the same time, Bingham being appointed commander of the forces in the field in the absence of the lord deputy. During his first year he regularly complained of his inadequate fee, which did not meet the expenses of his household. He initially regarded the Connacht presidency as the &#145;most painful and troublesome government in the country and the least commodious&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/111, no. 54), and thought of returning to life as captain of a small band. He sought unsuccessfully to establish himself at Roscommon Castle at the expense of Malby's heirs. But by the beginning of 1585, though still in dispute with Henry Malby, he had come to terms with his new surroundings. Having made plans to reduce the expenditure on his household, Bingham evidently realized that the provincial government could be made profitable. Still maintaining an interest in overseas military ventures, he contacted Leicester in July 1585 concerning an expedition to Flanders, but noted in the same month that he wished to continue in his office in Connacht. His initial encounters with the earl of Clanricarde were positive, and Bingham believed that the Irish of Connacht were willing to conform peacefully to English ways. Following the successful negotiation of the composition of Connacht in the summer of 1585, whereby the finances of the provincial administration were put on a sure footing and the prospects for a peaceful and increasingly Anglicized province were greatly enhanced, Bingham asserted that he planned never to leave Connacht without assurance of something better. He had leases of Boyle and Ballymote, but resented the loss of Roscommon to Henry Malby and challenged the claim of the treasurer, Wallop, to have a lease of Athlone, previously reserved for the use of the president of Connacht. In his later years in Connacht, Bingham had yearly leases of Athlone and Ballymote at rents of &pound;54 and &pound;16, but still complained that his predecessor had fared better.<br>
<br>Bingham's reputation as one whose harsh administration goaded the Irish of Connacht into rebellion owed much to the influence enjoyed by his enemies in the Dublin government. That reputation continues despite a spirited effort by H. T. Knox to demonstrate the extent to which Bingham was the victim of personal animosities. In particular, the hostility of the lord deputy, Sir John Perrot, and within Connacht the activities of Theobald Dillon and Francis Barkeley created serious difficulties for Bingham. Although the executions which followed the Galway assizes early in 1586, and Bingham's actions against the Mayo Burkes who went into rebellion in the summer of that year, were both within the remit of his commissions, his work was censured. The massacre at Ardnaree on the River Moy on 22 August 1586 of a large number of Scots, who were on their way to assist the Burkes, earned him a reputation as a merciless governor. However, it appears to have been his military success rather than his harshness that aroused the hostility of Lord Deputy Perrot. Bingham complained to the privy council that he never thought his service against the Scots in Mayo would have earned him such hatred and disgrace with the lord deputy that he was forced to leave his charge. He claimed that Perrot's undermining of his authority had undone the good of the military successes he had achieved.<br>
<br>By February 1587 the privy council had cleared Bingham of charges brought against him, finding they were maliciously brought by Theobald Dillon. In May of that year Bingham was withdrawn from Connacht temporarily for service in Flanders. He left in July, being replaced initially by Sir Thomas Le Strange and in September by his own brother George Bingham. On 11 January 1588 he married Sarah (1564/5&#150;1634), daughter of John Heigham of Gifford's Hall, Wickhambrook, Suffolk. Bingham was restored to the government of Connacht in spring 1588, reaching Athlone in May. He involved himself in a controversy over the legitimate succession to Sir Donnell O'Connor Sligo, and in September he actively implemented the government proclamation to execute any survivors of the Spanish Armada found in Connacht.<br>
<br>A new outbreak of rebellion among the Mayo Burkes in spring 1589 created renewed tension between the lord deputy and Bingham. New accusations of misgovernment were brought against him and controversy ensued when Sir Francis Walsingham, a lifelong supporter of Bingham, pointed out to the lord deputy that the men appointed as commissioners to examine Bingham's actions were his arch-enemies within the Dublin administration. By December 1589 Bingham had again been cleared of any charges of misgovernment, and for the following four and a half years governed the province in relative peace. He could not comprehend why &#145;I am tearmed crewell for doing her Majestie trewe service&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/170 no. 45).<br>
<br>The outbreak of the Nine Years' War in Ulster created a renewed atmosphere of unrest in Connacht by the mid-1590s. When O'Donnell came to mid-Roscommon in March 1595 Bingham did not have sufficient military strength to repel him. He was eventually assigned two untrained companies and given instructions to defend Connacht. The supporters of O'Donnell considered him &#145;the greatest monster of all the English that were then in Ireland&#146;  (&Oacute; Cl&eacute;righ, 1.101). Tension with the Dublin government continued, and Bingham was summoned before the lord deputy and council in July 1596 to answer further complaints. On 23 September he departed for England, believing there was a plot by Sir John Norris to murder him. On arrival in London he was suspended from his office and imprisoned for leaving Ireland without permission, but was released in November because of ill health. On his return journey to Ireland he was accompanied by Sir Conyers Clifford, who had been appointed to replace him in Connacht, and who left him behind at Chester owing to illness. The government, realizing the depth of animosity shown by Sir John Norris and Sir Geoffrey Fenton towards Bingham, decided the trial should be before the whole council in Dublin, but in the event it seems never to have taken place. Bingham continued to enjoy favour in London, and when plans were being drawn up for the earl of Essex's expedition to Ireland, Sir Francis Bacon advised Essex to be wary of Sir William Fitzwilliam and Sir John Norris but to have special regard for Bingham's advice. His considerable expertise as a military commander was clearly valued by his supporters despite his persistent lack of subtlety in his dealings with his political opponents. Together with the elderly Richard Burke, third earl of Clanricarde, Bingham was admitted to Gray's Inn, London, on 17 March 1598, probably as a result of the ongoing patronage of Sir Francis Walsingham.<br>
<br>In September 1598 Bingham left England with five thousand men to assume the office of marshall of Ireland, but he died in Dublin on 19 January 1599. His body was returned to London for burial in Westminster Abbey. A memorial to him was erected there by his former servant Sir John Bingley and a portrait painted in 1564 is in the National Portrait Gallery, London. Lady Bingham survived her husband and subsequently married Edward Waldegrave, of Lawford, Essex. She died at Lawford on 9 September 1634, aged sixty-nine, and was buried in the church there. Sir Richard evidently had no title to property in Ireland and the family's Dorset estates were inherited by Henry, eldest son of his younger brother George.<br>
