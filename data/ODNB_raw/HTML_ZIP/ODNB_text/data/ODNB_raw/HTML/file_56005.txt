<span class="headword">Minnitt,  Robert James</span>  (1889&#150;1974), <span class="occ">anaesthetist and general practitioner</span>, was born in Preston on 25 October 1889, the son of Robert Minnitt (1852&#150;1918), Church of England clergyman, and his wife, Isabella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cookson (1853&#150;1922). He was educated privately, and went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1908 intending to read for the church; his father and grandfather were both in holy orders. He left after a year to study medicine at Liverpool, qualifying in 1915. On 1 September 1916 he married Eileen Dooley (1897&#150;1975).<br>
<br>Minnitt is chiefly remembered for the development of a machine for self-administration of nitrous oxide (&#145;gas&#146;) and air to relieve pain in childbirth. Helped by Charles King, an engineer with a special interest in anaesthetic equipment, he modified an existing machine which started trials at the Liverpool Maternity Hospital in October 1933. By 1936, with his research assistant Dr Hilda Garry, he was able to demonstrate to the Royal Society of Medicine that the technique provided satisfactory pain relief in over 90 per cent of cases with no ill effects. Concurrently a report co-ordinated by the British College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists confirmed these findings. Both these studies received funding from the National Birthday Trust Fund, one of whose members, Lucy Baldwin, the prime minister's wife, had a particular interest in analgesia in childbirth.<br>
<br>In 1936 the Central Midwives' Board accepted the machine for use by unsupervised midwives, who then managed 60 per cent of deliveries, subject to strict conditions. Minnitt devised a portable model which could fit in the carrier of a bicycle, thus extending the technique to the domiciliary setting where 80 per cent of deliveries took place. Gas and air remained the only form of pain relief available to millions of women until the early 1960s. Then defects were found in some Minnitt machines; nitrous oxide and oxygen (Entonox) from a single cylinder was developed and was recognized by the Royal College of Midwives.<br>
<br>Minnitt received many honours, including fellowships from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (1950) and the Faculty of Anaesthetists (1953). The Royal Society of Medicine awarded him the Hickman medal (1950) for original work of outstanding merit. A commemorative plaque was mounted outside the labour ward at the Liverpool Maternity Hospital.<br>
<br>Minnitt's many other pioneering achievements should not be overshadowed. He obtained an MD degree in 1925, and in 1930 was a founder member of the Liverpool Society of Anaesthetists, the first provincial society of its kind in England. He acted as secretary for twenty years before becoming president. The university appointed him the first lecturer in anaesthesia (1933), and he was the first anaesthetist to sit on the board of the faculty of medicine. He thus strongly influenced the establishment of a full-time department of anaesthesia (1947). This was highlighted in the citation for his honorary MSc (1967). His publications included <span class="italic">Gas and Air Analgesia</span> and (with John Gillies) a re-editing of Ross and Fairlie's <span class="italic">Handbook of Anaesthesia</span>.<br>
<br>In 1948 Minnitt found himself unable to accept a contract in the National Health Service and spent the rest of his life in private general practice, probably at some financial cost. Nevertheless his reputation remained and he was still in demand as a lecturer. He was president of the section of general practice at the Royal Society of Medicine (1954&#150;5) and was an honorary fellow on the foundation of the Royal College of General Practitioners. Locally he was president of the Liverpool Medical Institution (1957) and continued to attend meetings of the Liverpool Society of Anaesthetists. Minnitt is recalled as an inspiring teacher and a man of infinite courtesy whose devotion to his patients was legendary. It was said that he never took a holiday. He died on 21 February 1974 at Broadgreen Hospital, Broadgreen, Liverpool, and was buried that month at Christchurch, Healey, Rochdale. He was survived by his wife, son, and three daughters.<br>
