<span class="headword">Ratsey,  Gamaliel</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1605), <span class="occ">highwayman</span>, was said to have been the son of Richard Ratsey, gentleman, of Market Deeping, Lincolnshire. Because relevant quarter session and assize records of the period have not survived his career is obscure. According to a contemporary biographer, writing in the <span class="italic">Life and Death of Gamaliel Ratsey</span> of 1605, Ratsey's first theft was of a bag containing &pound;40 from an inn in Spalding. Arrested at Market Deeping, he was committed to gaol but escaped &#145;in his shirt&#146;. This incident seems to have occurred in 1599 for the Market Deeping constables' accounts of that year mention the sum of 32<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. &#145;laid out for caryinge Gamaliell Ratsey to Lincoln goale&#146;  (Market Deeping parish officers' accounts, 1570&#150;1647, section D, fol. 13<i>v</i>). A period of military service followed. Ratsey may have received a pardon on condition of military service or have joined the army as a fugitive. However this may be, he is said to have gone to Ireland with the army of Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, in 1599. He distinguished himself there, attaining the rank of sergeant in Captain Roger Langford's company of foot, stationed at Carrickfergus, and then, in 1603, returned to England with Charles Blount, eighth Lord Mountjoy. Thereafter, unable to settle to peaceful pursuits, he turned to highway robbery.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Ratsey's exploits beyond what is alleged in contemporary pamphlet literature. However, he seems to have operated mainly in the east midlands, sometimes alone and sometimes in confederacy with two thieves named Henry Shorthose and George Snell. &#145;Shorthose&#146; is often supposed to have been a nickname but, like Ratsey, this man is said to have hailed from Market Deeping, and bishops' transcripts and other records of the period do document the existence of a family of that name in the parish. The pamphlets depict Ratsey as bold, artful, generous to the poor, and possessed of a rough sense of humour. In one tale he bestows 40<i>s</i>. upon an old couple on the road to St Ives, declaring that he would &#145;favour and pitie them that are poore &hellip; for the rich can helpe themselves&#146;  (Atkins, sig. C3<i>v</i>); in another he robs two clothiers near Stamford and then knights them as Sir Walter Woolsack and Sir Samuel Sheepskin. A few of these stories, like that recounting his robbery of nine men on Helpston Heath, Northamptonshire, may be embroidered versions of genuine incidents, but most appear to be fictitious. The tale of Ratsey and the poor farmer appears in different guises in the literature of many famous outlaws, including Robin Hood and Dick Turpin.<br>
<br>Ratsey was convicted of highway robbery and sentenced to death at the Lent assizes for Bedfordshire in 1605 and executed in Bedford on 26 or 27 March 1605. He achieved a measure of contemporary fame. Two pamphlets appeared in the months following his execution. <span class="italic">The Life and Death of Gamaliel Ratsey, a Famous Thief of England</span>, was entered on the Stationers' register to John Trundell on 2 May 1605, and <span class="italic">Ratseis Ghost, or, The Second Part of his Madde Prankes and Robberies</span>, was printed by Valentine Syms and entered to John Hodges of St Paul's Churchyard on 31 May. Two ballads, of which no copies survive, were also entered at Stationers' Hall to Thomas Pavyer on 2 May 1605. Ratsey was the subject of two epigrams in Jacob Johnson's <span class="italic">Epigrammatum libellus</span> (1615). A number of other curious allusions to him occur in seventeenth-century literature. Ben Jonson, in <span class="italic">The Alchemist</span> (1610), speaks of &#145;a face, cut for thee, worse than Gamaliel Ratsey's&#146;  (Herford and Simpson, 5.298) and Thomas Randolph's <span class="italic">Hey for Honesty</span> (1651) carries this reference to an old painted lady: &#145;Take but the white-loam from this old mud-wall, And she will look worse than Gamaliel Ratsey&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poetical and Dramatic Works</span>, 2.470). It is speculated that these allusions may have been inspired by a grotesque mask worn by Ratsey during robberies to terrify his victims into submission. Gabriel Harvey's reference to Gamaliell Hobgoblin in <span class="italic">Pierces Supererogation</span> (1593), commonly explained in the same way, is, however, too early to be an allusion to Ratsey.<br>
