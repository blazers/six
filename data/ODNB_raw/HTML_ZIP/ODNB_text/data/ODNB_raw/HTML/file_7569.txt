<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Devey,  George</span>  (1820&#150;1886), <span class="occ">architect and painter</span>, was born on 23 February 1820 at 34 Ely Place, London, the second of four children of Frederick Nicholls Devey (1786&#150;1862), a solicitor, and his wife, Ann (<i>b</i>. 1785), daughter of Durs Egg, a Swiss gunmaker who had emigrated to England. It was probably the artistic interests of his mother's family&#151;her younger brother was the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8595/', "Augustus Egg")</script>&#151;which encouraged Devey's early enthusiasm for painting and sketching. He was educated first at a private school in Stanmore, Middlesex, and then, from 1832 to 1835, at King's College School, London, where he was taught drawing by John Sell Cotman. In 1837 he was articled to the architect Thomas Little in Northumberland Street, London. Little appreciated his skill at draughtsmanship, and employed him in his office after his pupillage had ended.<br>
<br>Although Devey exhibited designs for buildings under his own name at the Royal Academy on four occasions between 1841 and 1848, he does not appear to have set up in practice by himself until about 1846, after his return from a tour of Germany and Italy. His first office was at 16 Great Marlborough Street, London, where he remained until 1880, when he moved to 123 Bond Street. In 1856 he became a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects. His career was established slowly. In 1848 he was introduced to Lord De L'Isle, for whom he restored and extended a group of cottages known as Leicester Square at the entrance to Penshurst Place in Kent. Devey's sensitive handling of these modest tile-hung buildings reveals his close examination of the vernacular architecture of the Kentish Weald, a study unexceptional for an artist at that date but unprecedented for an architect.<br>
<br>This was the beginning of a busy country house practice, although it was not until 1866 that Devey received his first commission for an entirely new house, the half-timbered Akeley Wood, Buckinghamshire. His main work was remodelling old houses and designing estate buildings. Many were for Liberal politicians, as a result of Devey's friendship with Sir Walter James (later first Baron Northbourne), like Devey an accomplished watercolour painter and skilled horseman. Devey remodelled Betteshanger, James's seat near Deal in Kent, for which he also provided garden designs. The Liberal connection proved most profitable for Devey in an introduction to the Rothschilds, on whose Buckinghamshire estates he worked for many years, beginning with new estate buildings for Sir Anthony de Rothschild at Aston Clinton in 1863. His major documented works for the Rothschilds were the pavilion at Eythrope (1876&#150;9) for Alice de Rothschild and the enlargement for Leopold de Rothschild of Ascott from 1874 onwards, to create what Mary Gladstone called &#145;a palace-like cottage&#146;  (L. Masterson, ed., <span class="italic">Mary Gladstone: her Diaries and Letters</span>, 1930, 196).<br>
<br>Although Devey's genius was for modest picturesque buildings, he received many commissions for large houses. Among them are Hall Place, Leigh, Kent (1871&#150;4), for the hosiery manufacturer and Liberal MP Samuel Morley, which at &pound;70,913 was Devey's most expensive building; and Goldings, near Hertford, for the banker Robert Smith, which was the biggest (1871&#150;4). Devey's sensitivity to materials is perhaps shown to better effect in his many extensions and alterations to old houses, most notably his additions to Walmer Castle, Kent, for the second Earl Granville (1872&#150;5) and to Melbury House, Dorset, for the fifth earl of Ilchester (1884&#150;6). His concern for the external harmony of his buildings was not matched by any interest in interior design.<br>
<br>Devey was a solitary man, who did not encourage publication of his designs; since they were almost exclusively for domestic buildings, and so out of the public eye, few were noticed by his contemporaries. Not until his rediscovery by H. S. Goodhart-Rendel in 1957&#151;&#145;one of three most influential domestic architects in England of the 19th century&#146;&#151;did Devey's reputation begin to rise  (P. Ferriday, ed., <span class="italic">Victorian Architecture</span>, 1963, 67). And it was not until the publication of Jill Allibone's biography in 1991 that it became clear that Devey was not only a prolific country house architect but also a pioneer of the revived interest in English vernacular models. His cottages at Penshurst were seen and sketched by W. E. Nesfield and Richard Norman Shaw in 1860 and so probably influenced their creation of the &#145;Old English&#146; style in the late 1860s and 1870s, which had a decisive impact on English domestic architecture.<br>
<br>Devey never married. Although he fell in love with a clergyman's daughter, Flora Hoskins, and proposed to her twice&#151;before she married in 1857 and after she was widowed in 1866&#151;he was rejected both times, probably because of his heterodox religious beliefs. He was a member of the Theistic church founded by the Revd Charles Voysey, thanks to which Voysey's architect son Charles Francis Annesley Voysey worked in Devey's office for two years. Voysey later recalled that &#145;When asked by his client to join a house-party, Devey would make the most fascinating catch-penny sketches while dressing for dinner and present them during dessert, charming everyone&#146;  (J. Brandon-Jones, &#145;C. F. A. Voysey: a memoir&#146;, <span class="italic">Architectural Association Journal</span>, 72, 1957, 241&#150;62).<br>
<br>Devey's practice was wound up after his death. There is a large collection of his drawings in the drawings collection of the Royal Institute of British Architects, together with a substantial number of photographs commissioned by him; he was a pioneer in the use of photography to record buildings, including his own under construction as well as completed. Devey lived with his parents first at Ely Place and subsequently at Ealing. After they died he moved to Elm Park House in Chelsea and then, at some point between 1881 and 1884, to Ashley House in Lavender Hill, Clapham, where he was living at the time of his death. He died of bronchitis on 4 November 1886 at his brother's house, Devonshire House, Pelham Crescent, Hastings (where he had bought a house intended for his retirement), and was buried in the borough council's cemetery at Ore, in Kent. His estate was valued at &pound;32,531, &#145;a pretty large sum, as times go, for a man to have accumulated by his own exertions in a profession the emoluments of which are not over-liberal&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 25 June 1887, 931).<br>
