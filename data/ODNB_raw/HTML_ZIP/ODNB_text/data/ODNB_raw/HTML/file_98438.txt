<span class="headword">Latcham,  Richard Edward</span>  (1869&#150;1943), <span class="occ">civil engineer and anthropologist</span>, was born at Cross Hands, Almondsbury, Gloucestershire, on 5 March 1869, the second child and eldest son of Tucker Latcham (<i>b</i>. 1840/41), wheelwright, and his wife, Victoria Adelaide, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cartwright (<i>b</i>. 1843/4). He was a boarder at Queen Elizabeth's Hospital School for boys in Bristol, and went on to the Polytechnic Institute, London, where he qualified in civil engineering in 1888. A meeting in London with a Chilean who was involved in the colonization of the Araucan&iacute;a region by Chile led to his appointment there as a surveyor and road builder, though he was as yet unable to speak Spanish. He remained in Araucan&iacute;a for five years engaged in land surveying and civil engineering projects, and also did some English teaching. Later he settled in La Serena, where he worked as a mining engineer, and married a Chilean woman. Although he spent his adult life in Chile, and was known as Ricardo Eduardo Latcham, he retained his British nationality.<br>
<br>While working on the roads and railways in the southern regions Latcham met many Mapuche people; he learned their native language, Mapuzungun, and had ample opportunity to talk to them and observe their way of life. Following in the steps of Jos&eacute; Toribio Medina (1852&#150;1930) and Max Uhle (1856&#150;1944), he decided to dedicate himself to the study of the Mapuche and other indigenous societies in Chile, and became a self-trained anthropologist, though it was not until 1928 that he could pursue these interests as a full-time activity.<br>
<br>Latcham was one of the pioneers of Chilean anthropology, and indeed ethnography and the archaeology, undertaking excavations of burial mounds and cemeteries. He produced numerous books on indigenous histories, including books (in Spanish) on the Chango people of the Chilean coast (1910), the social organization and religious beliefs of the ancient Araucanians (1924), Chilean pre-history (1928), and the archaeology of the Atacama region (1938). He also published over 200 papers, including some in such major journals as the <span class="italic">Revista Chilena de Historia y Geograf&iacute;a</span> and the <span class="italic">Revista Chilena de Antropolog&iacute;a</span>. His research was admired for its critical and scientific method, and it continued to be cited long after his death, though some of his preoccupations&#151;notably his study of the size and thickness of the skulls of indigenous peoples, and definition of them as &#145;subraces&#146;&#151;were anachronistically Victorian.<br>
<br>In 1928 Latcham became director of the National Museum of Natural History in Santiago, a position he held until his death. During his directorship the museum secured the necessary funds to renovate its main building and it successfully re-launched the <span class="italic">Bolet&iacute;n del Museo</span>, a scholarly journal that included numerous pieces on the contemporary exhibits of the museum, the research of its staff, and broader debates about anthropology, archaeology, and museum theory. He secured the services of Grete Mostny, a renowned expert in pre-Columbian cultures and future director of the museum. From 1929 Latcham combined the museum directorship with the position of dean of the faculty of arts at the University of Chile, where he taught American prehistory. He was awarded honorary doctorates by the University of San Marcos, Lima, having carried out excavations on Inca sites in Peru, and the University of La Plata, Argentina; in 1939 the government of Chile conferred on him the order of merit. He died in Santiago on 16 October 1943. In 1969 the Chilean National Museum published <span class="italic">In Homage to Ricardo Latcham</span>.<br>
