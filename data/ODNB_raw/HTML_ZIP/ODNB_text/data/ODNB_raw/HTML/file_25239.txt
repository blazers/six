<span class="headword">Sharpham,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1576, <em>d.</em> 1608), <span class="occ">playwright and pamphleteer</span>, was baptized on 22 July 1576 at Colehanger, East Allington, Devon, the third of five children of Richard Sharpham (<i>d</i>. 1581) and Mary Pomeroy (<i>b</i>. 1548). His father died when he was five; his mother later married Alexander Hext (<i>d</i>. 1588), with whom she had three more children, and Charles Barnaby (<i>d</i>. 1596) of Clement's Inn. In 1592 she sued Thomas Fortescue for allegedly using witchcraft to kill her first husband and make her fall in love with Fortescue. In February 1596 Sharpham sued Fortescue and William Bastard of the Middle Temple for allegedly tampering with evidence related to the case  (Eccles, 120).<br>
<br>Sharpham undoubtedly attended grammar school in Devon, possibly at Plymouth under the pedagogue William Kemp. On 9 October 1594 he was admitted to the Middle Temple. Although he never had chambers there and was never called to the bar, he was associated with the Middle Temple to the end of his life, and his plays show the influence of inns of court revels. In 1597 he published a cony-catching pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The Discoverie of the Knights of the Poste</span>, a picaresque first-person account of rogues and criminals on the road between London and Exeter. This work was attributed only to &#145;E. S.&#146;, but Petter summarizes the strong evidence for Sharpham's authorship  (Petter, 72&#150;9).<br>
<br>For the next decade Sharpham must have associated with inns of court literary circles, but documentary evidence of his activities is lacking. Ben Jonson called Sharpham a &#145;rogue&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ben Jonson</span>, 1.133), but he may still be the &#145;E. S.&#146; who wrote a commendatory poem for Jonson's <span class="italic">Volpone</span> (1607). His authorship of two plays printed in 1607, <span class="italic">The Fleire</span> and <span class="italic">Cupid's Whirligig</span>, is more certain. <span class="italic">The Fleire</span> was written for the Blackfriars Boys between late 1605 and its entry in the Stationers' register on 13 May 1606. The play is a cynical, thinly veiled satire of King James's court, modelled on John Marston's <span class="italic">The Malcontent</span> and <span class="italic">The Fawne</span> with elements of the Gunpowder Plot thrown in. It was apparently quite popular, being printed in editions of 1607, 1610, 1615, and 1631.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Cupid's Whirligig</span> was written in early 1607 for the Children of the King's Revels at the Whitefriars, and probably produced that spring. On 30 August Sharpham was in debt to Richard Edwards for four felt hats he had borrowed earlier, possibly for this production. The play is another satire, parodying Lyly and again influenced by Marston, but it shows signs of hasty construction. The character of Nucome may have been a jab at King James's favourite Robert Carr, and Leech shows that the text was altered to remove satiric references to the Scots. The play was printed later in 1607 with a dedication to fellow Devonian Robert Hayman, and was reprinted in 1611, 1616, and 1630. On 22 April 1608, ill with the plague, Sharpham made a will which divided up his colourful wardrobe among friends and relatives. The next day he was buried in St Margaret's, Westminster.<br>
