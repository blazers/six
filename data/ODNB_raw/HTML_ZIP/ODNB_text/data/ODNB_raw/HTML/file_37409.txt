<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Faithfull,  Emily</span>  (1835&#150;1895), <span class="occ">publisher and women's activist</span>, was born on 27 May 1835 at Headley rectory, Surrey, the youngest of five daughters and the last of eight children of Ferdinand Faithfull, rector of Headley, and his wife, Elizabeth Mary Harrison, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Timberlake. Little is known of her early life, but she was educated at home and attended a school in Kensington. She was presented at court in 1857.<br>
<br>During the 1850s a movement was growing in support of women's legal, economic, and educational rights. A group of women who had come together under the aegis of Barbara Leigh Smith (later Bodichon), formed the Langham Place circle (named after their meeting place) and produced in 1858 the first number of the <span class="italic">English Woman's Journal</span> (later the <span class="italic">Englishwoman's Review</span>) which was to be the organ for the circle's ideas. The young Emily Faithfull joined this well-connected group, which included Bessie Rayner Parkes, Jessie Boucherett, Emily Davies, and Helen Blackburn. The group pressed for legal reform in women's status (including suffrage), explored new areas for women's employment, and campaigned for improved educational opportunities for girls and women. Emily Faithfull was at the heart of this multi-faceted campaign and identified with all three dimensions, although she is best known for her work in women's employment. Her public support of the enfranchisement of women developed later from her investigations and practical campaigns surrounding employment, but from the beginning she was actively involved in the successful movement led by Emily Davies to have the university local examinations opened to women, which began in 1858.<br>
<br>Early on members of the group began to explore new openings for respectable employment for all classes of women, and in 1859 they formed the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women. One possibility considered was that of compositor, a skilled trade almost wholly confined to men, already effectively unionized and jealously guarded against both unskilled machine operators and any incursions by women. Bessie Parkes bought a small printing press, and she and Emily Faithfull employed a compositor, Austin Holyoake (brother of George Jacob Holyoake), to give instruction in composing. On the basis of this experience they concluded that composing could be a suitable occupation for women. To this end, on 25 March 1860, Emily Faithfull opened the Victoria Press at Great Coram Street, London. She invested her own capital in the press and had the financial backing of another committee member of the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women, G. W. Hastings.<br>
<br>The press employed at the outset some semi-experienced female compositors, who existed despite the trade restrictions practised by men, but the venture was to remain an irritant to many compositors and others in the printing trade. It was nevertheless a commercial success, although the women compositors only composed and proof-read, unlike later women printers working for the Women's Printing Society (founded in 1876 by Emma Paterson's Women's Protective and Provident League, with which Emily Faithfull was also associated), who also carried out both imposition and &#145;making up&#146; (making up the type into pages and placing them in the iron frame or chase for printing). Initially Emily Faithfull both printed and published, one of her earliest works being <span class="italic">The Victoria Regia</span> (1861), edited by Adelaide Ann Procter. The work and the press attracted the approval of Queen Victoria, and in that same year Emily Faithfull was appointed by royal warrant &#145;Printer and Publisher in Ordinary to Her Majesty&#146;. In 1863 she was the founder editor of the <span class="italic">Victoria Magazine</span>, a monthly periodical, to which she contributed until it ceased publication in 1880. The press published the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science from 1860 to 1864. Emily Faithfull was connected with the association, and remained for the rest of her life actively engaged in promoting women's employment and their right to enjoy educational opportunity and legal status equivalent to that of men. In 1862 the press moved to Farringdon Street, London, where the printing was carried out with steam presses, and in 1867 she handed the management of the press to William Wilfred Head, who bought her out in 1869 and continued to run the press as a vehicle for the employment of women until 1882.<br>
<br>In 1864 Emily Faithfull became caught up in a divorce case when Admiral Henry Codrington sought a divorce from his wife on grounds of adultery. Helen Codrington counter-claimed, as she was able to do under the 1857 <span class="roman">Marriage and Divorce Act</span>, on grounds which included the accusation that in October 1856 he had attempted to rape Emily Faithfull while she was a guest in their house. At first Emily Faithfull agreed to give evidence on behalf of Mrs Codrington but later changed her mind. The reasons for this are not clear, but her own reputation, at risk by virtue of an association with a divorce case, would have been even more vulnerable had she agreed to take the stand. There is also a suggestion that she was threatened with further counter-claims by Admiral Codrington. She exercised discretion and withdrew.<br>
<br>During her continuing association with the Victoria Press and the <span class="italic">Victoria Magazine</span> Emily Faithfull became a writer as well as an editor. In 1868 she published her only novel, <span class="italic">Change upon Change</span>, a tragic romance with an underlying theme about the need for women to have access to education, training, and work if they were not to be at risk of being destroyed by their often frivolous and trivial schooling and their dependence upon men. The book was published in America as <span class="italic">A Reed Shaken with the Wind</span> in 1873, at the time of her first visit to the United States. She became a prolific journalist and author, contributing articles to the <span class="italic">Lady's Pictorial</span> and the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, as well as the <span class="italic">Victoria Magazine</span>. One of her obituarists described her as a very popular lecturer on both sides of the Atlantic, and her visits to America (the second and third taking place in 1882&#150;3 and 1883&#150;4) were to lecture as well as to investigate women's employment in the USA. She was also associated with educational developments in America and was invited to open a kindergarten in San Francisco which was named after her. Her second book, <span class="italic">Three Visits to America</span> (1884), was a collection of her writings, lectures, and impressions, and in it she made known her views on employment, education, and women's legal status, including suffrage. Like other members of the Langham Place circle [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93708', "Langham Place group")</script>] Faithfull did not feel it necessary to refrain from commenting upon votes for women because she was already engaged in promoting women's employment. The fear that suffrage supporters might taint other campaigns, because the issue was the least acceptable or popular, did cause activists to exercise caution but did not prevent them from expressing firm opinions. As early as 1870 Faithfull wrote to <span class="italic">The Times</span> supporting the enfranchisement of women and in <span class="italic">Three Visits</span> she called for &#145;political status&#146; for women, arguing that there was &#145;an inseparable connection between political power and the redress of social grievances&#146;. Women's suffrage was an &#145;urgent necessity&#146; not an issue of &#145;abstract justice&#146;.<br>
<br>Faithfull benefited in her career as a lecturer from the gift of a &#145;singularly musical voice&#146; (according to her obituarist in the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>), &#145;which she used to great effect on the platform, though it was heard to better advantage in private readings&#146;. Emily Faithfull used her musical voice in a two-year period from 1872 in a series of dramatic readings. She had theatrical connections, and in 1881 she founded the International Musical, Dramatic and Literary Association, an organization to protect the rights of composers and artists.<br>
<br>Emily Faithfull was a prolific author, and a dedicated propagandist and pioneer for women's rights in employment and other spheres. Her contributions were both practical and exhortatory, and she succeeded in carrying out her self-appointed tasks at the same time as appealing to popular audiences and retaining the patronage of Queen Victoria, who was no general supporter of women's rights. In 1886 she received &pound;100 from the royal bounty, in 1888 she was presented with an inscribed engraved portrait of the queen in recognition of her dedicated work over thirty years in the interests of women, and in 1889 she was awarded a civil-list pension of &pound;50.<br>
<br>Faithfull's photograph in late middle age shows an ample woman with a benign expression, dressed in all the accoutrements of Victorian middle-class womanhood. This respectable daughter of an Anglican clergyman had an eclectic and varied career, which included challenging one of the most tightly regulated and jealously guarded of the older trades, and speaking publicly about acutely sensitive issues. She died, aged sixty, on 31 May 1895, at 10 Plymouth Grove, Manchester, lamented by her sister, Mrs John George Fleet of Chiswick. She herself was unmarried, but left a legacy of writings and activity in one of the most controversial issues of her age.<br>
