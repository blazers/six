<span class="headword">Lydford,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1337&#150;1407), <span class="occ">canon lawyer</span>, was born in the diocese of Exeter, probably at Lydford in Devon, about 1337&#151;he was known to be almost seventy in 1406. He was probably educated at Stapledon Hall (later Exeter College) in Oxford; after his death his executors gave some of his books to the college. His brother Robert was also a student there. Lydford's will mentioned Robert Hereward, archdeacon of Taunton, as one of his early benefactors, and he asked to be buried in Exeter Cathedral at the feet of a canon of the same name. Most of our knowledge of his career is taken from his memorandum book or formulary, which has survived among the Exeter diocesan records. Gaps in the diocesan registers make the date and place of his ordination uncertain, but by 1361 he had been presented by the crown, during the vacancy of the abbey of Abingdon, to the benefice of Lockinge in Berkshire, and entries in the memorandum book suggest that at this time he was gaining experience as a proctor in the Salisbury ecclesiastical courts. Perhaps the most important step in his career was his exchange of Lockinge for a prebend in the free chapel of Bosham in Sussex. Here, with the approval of Bishop Grandisson of Exeter (<i>d</i>. 1369), the patron, he joined a distinguished group of west-country canonists, John Shillingford, Ralph Tregrisiou, and Robert and Nicholas Braybrooke, who were closely attached to the rising west-country churchman, William Courtenay (<i>d</i>. 1396), the future archbishop of Canterbury. He also encountered the Arundel family, who were later to employ his services in Avignon. In 1368 Courtenay went to Oxford as chancellor of the university and was accompanied by Lydford as his clerk. When in 1369 Courtenay became bishop of Hereford, Lydford went too, and was soon dispatched by his master to act as his proctor at the papal court at Avignon. He was resident there for long periods between 1370 and 1376, and acquired much expertise and professional knowledge which made many clients and friends for him to the end of his life.<br>
<br>By 1370 Lydford seems to have proceeded <i>doctor utrius legis</i> and had become an advocate in the court of arches. More importantly for his career, however, he was taken up by William Wykeham, first as a proctor in Avignon and then, from 1377 to 1394, as his diocesan official. He had already played an important part, in 1376, in persuading the pope to intercede with Edward III to restore Wykeham to royal favour, and it seems likely that he also advised Wykeham on the acquisition of the bull which authorized the foundation of New College, Oxford. During his tenure of the officiality Lydford was certainly occupied with the endowment of the college, but his memorandum book shows him as also busy in the details of diocesan visitation and with a number of difficult law cases affecting episcopal authority. The household records of the bishop's establishment show him also to have been a regular and frequent guest of the bishop on occasions unconnected with diocesan business. At the same time he maintained his links with Courtenay and his fellow canonists. This was the peak period of Wyclif's activity and of Lollard agitation, and Courtenay was deeply involved. When in 1382 Courtenay convened the so-called Earthquake Council at Blackfriars in London, Lydford appeared as one of the canonist assessors and helped to draw up the condemnation of Wyclif's doctrines. Even after the end of his official employment by Wykeham and Courtenay, Lydford maintained his concern with heretical doctrines, and the memorandum book includes copies of such important documents as the appeal of the Lollard Nicholas Hereford to Rome, and the articles drawn up by Baldwin Shillingford in 1395 against William Thorpe's heretical preaching in the diocese of London. It seems certain that Lydford had become a Lollard expert. By 1385 the centre of Lydford's interests had shifted back to Exeter. He had been a cathedral canon from at least 1376 and in 1385 became archdeacon of Totnes; from this time until his death in December 1407 his principal residence was in Exeter. There are regular signs in the Exeter chapter books of his activities there, and the episcopal registers of Bishop Brantingham and Bishop Stafford, as well as his own memoranda, show that he was regularly employed as adviser and administrator by the bishops and the chapter officials.<br>
<br>Lydford's true importance was as an experienced canonist, whose opinion was sought by ecclesiastics and laymen at all levels. He was not particularly learned, but his memoranda reveal him as an intelligent and adaptable administrator whose activities touched the church and also the state at a good many points. It is known that he borrowed, and presumably read, the chapter manuscript of &#145;Speculum historiale&#146;. He took pride in the &#145;good letters&#146; he wrote, and he carefully enumerated in his will his beautiful, large, noted breviary, a fair <i>legenda sanctorum</i>, a long crimson robe furred, and the black maple cup from which he had drunk much good wine.<br>
