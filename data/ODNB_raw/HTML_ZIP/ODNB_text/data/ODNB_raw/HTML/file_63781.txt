<span class="headword">Dunbar <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Folley]</span>,  Evelyn Mary</span>  (1906&#150;1960), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born at 179 Oxford Road, Reading, Berkshire, on 18 December 1906, the daughter of William Dunbar of Moray, a master tailor, and Florence Murgatroyd of Yorkshire. She was educated at Rochester Girls' Grammar School, and first studied art at Rochester School of Art. At the age of twenty-three she won a Kent exhibition (a county scholarship) to study at the Royal College of Art, which she did from 1929 to 1933. One of her studies of that period, <span class="italic">Flight</span> (oil and watercolour on paper, 1930) intended for a mural decoration, is now in the Tate collection. Dunbar first came to public notice as one of the outstanding young graduates of the college working on decorations for Brockley county school, south-east London, depicting scenes drawn from Aesop's <span class="italic">Fables</span> and other sources, under the direction of Cyril Mahoney, 1933&#150;6. Her composition <span class="italic">The Country Girl and the Pail of Milk</span> was especially praised. Following this she embarked on a career as a freelance painter and illustrator. She enjoyed gardening subjects&#151;the Tate collection includes her <span class="italic">Winter Garden</span> (oil on canvas, <i>c</i>.1929&#150;36), a painting in the long horizontal format which she favoured in some other works. A characteristic painting of the late 1930s is <span class="italic">Rochester from Strood</span> (oil on canvas, 1938), in which the tower of the castle and the spire of the cathedral are seen from a distance, the foreground being a garden dominated by a humble potting-shed. In 1937 she turned to book illustration, working with Cyril Mahoney on <span class="italic">Gardener's Choice</span> and later with Michael Greenhill on <span class="italic">A Book of Farmcraft</span> (<i>c</i>.1942).<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Dunbar became an official war artist (1940&#150;45); her <span class="italic">Convalescent Nurses Making Camouflage Nets</span> was reproduced in colour in Eric Newton's <span class="italic">War through Artists' Eyes</span> (1945). She concentrated mainly, however, on subjects taken from the activities of the Women's Land Army. Typical of her unusual vision is the painting in Manchester City Galleries, <span class="italic">A 1944 Pastoral: Land Girls Pruning at East Malling</span> (oil on canvas, 1944). The scene, of the girls climbing trees and moving their triangular ladders about, has a painted surround of compartments depicting disembodied hands using saws, knives, and pruning shears, as well as decorative compositions of fruit. In the same collection is <span class="italic">Potato Sorting, Berwick</span> (oil on canvas), an austere frieze-like composition of seven farm workers in a bleak landscape, gathered near the large wheeled piece of equipment used for their task, while in <span class="italic">Sprout Picking, Monmouthshire</span> (oil on canvas, also in Manchester City Galleries) the bent figures in it are in a field receding sharply in perspective to a row of greenhouses, above which the trees and hills are surmounted by a glowing cloudy sky. A major work now in the Tate collection is <span class="italic">A Land Girl with the Bail Bull</span> (oil on canvas, 1945), another long horizontal picture. On 17 August 1942 Dunbar married, at St Nicholas, Strood, Kent, Roger Roland Westwell Folley (<i>b</i>. 1912/13), a flying officer in the RAF and later an agricultural economist at Oxford. She was for many years friendly with the painter Percy Horton, and he invited Dunbar to teach at the Ruskin School of Drawing, which she did for a number of years from 1950. She painted lunette murals at Bletchley Park Training College, Bedfordshire (1958&#150;60), as well as <span class="italic">The Seasons</span> at Wye College. She was a member of the Society of Mural Painters and, from 1945, the New English Art Club. She died on 12 May 1960 near her home, Staple Farm, Hastingleigh, East Ashford, Kent. She was survived by her husband.<br>
