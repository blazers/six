<span class="headword">Doughty <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Shackell]</span>, Dame  Adelaide Baillieu</span>  (1908&#150;1986), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Vailima, Glenferrie Road, Malvern, Victoria, Australia, on 2 December 1908, the middle of the three daughters of Edward Herbert Shackell (1869&#150;1932), public accountant, and his wife, Amy Baillieu (1870&#150;1966). Initially she and her sisters were educated at home by governesses. Later Adelaide went to study at St Catherine's School in Melbourne from 1920 to 1925. After completing her study there she was accepted into Melbourne University. These plans soon changed during a family visit from her cousin Clive Latham Baillieu, first Baron Baillieu, the financier, and his wife, Ruby. They suggested that Adelaide return to Britain under their care. This she did, and in 1928 entered St Hilda's College, Oxford, where she gained a second in philosophy, politics, and economics in 1931.<br>
<br>Adelaide soon met Charles John Joseph Addison Doughty (1902&#150;1973), the eldest son of Sir Charles Doughty, recorder of Brighton. Both were waiting in Victoria Station to catch a boat-train to Switzerland for a skiing holiday. He was then a solicitor, who had been called to the bar in 1926. They were engaged within the year and, once Adelaide finished her degree at St Hilda's, were married on 29 July 1931. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Adelaide Doughty's public work began in 1947, when she joined the English-Speaking Union (ESU) in what was formerly known as the Common Interests' Committee; her cousin Lord Baillieu was heavily involved in the union and later became its chairman. She worked hard for the ESU, following through with this particular side of work until the Hospitality Council was set up in 1971. She was elected as ESU club director in 1950 and devoted much of her time and interests to the affairs of the club; she was elected chairman of the board of club directors in 1969. She also served as a governor of the ESU from 1958 to 1972. Her activities with the ESU included a service on the US exchange teachers' committee and a further period as a member of the speakers' committee. She was elected to the ESU policy committee in 1970 and became joint deputy chairman of the ESU in June 1971. She resigned in September 1972 in protest against the board's &#145;discourtesy&#146; in signing a lease of part of its Mayfair premises to the Grand Metropolitan Hotel Group before informing its membership.<br>
<br>Adelaide Doughty undertook notable work for the Conservative Party; from 1951 to 1956 she was a member of the party's south-eastern area women's advisory committee. Her husband, meanwhile, who took silk in 1954 and succeeded his father as recorder of Brighton, was elected Conservative MP for Surrey (East) in 1951 and held the seat until 1970. From 1963 to 1966 she was an outstandingly successful chairman of the Conservative Party's women's national advisory committee, doing much to shift the tory women's role towards political issues rather than administrative details. During her term in office the Conservatives elected a new leader for the first time, and she spoke in favour of Edward Heath's nomination. In 1964 she became vice-chairman of the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations and succeeded to the chairmanship in March 1967 following the death of Sir Robert Davies. She served as president of the party in 1978. She was appointed CBE in 1964 and DBE in 1971.<br>
<br>During this time, Adelaide Doughty was also a governor of the Skinners' Company's School for Girls in 1951, the director of the National Institute for Housecraft from 1966, and a member of the grand council of the cancer research campaign from 1974. She died at home at Flat 4, 89 Onslow Square, Kensington, London, on 12 August 1986.<br>
