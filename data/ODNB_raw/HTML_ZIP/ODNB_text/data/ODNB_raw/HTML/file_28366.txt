<span class="headword">Wadd,  William</span>  (1776&#150;1829), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, the eldest son of Charlotte and Solomon Wadd (<i>d</i>. 1821), a surgeon who had lived and practised for more than half a century in Basinghall Street, London, was born on 21 June 1776. He entered Merchant Taylors' School late in 1784 and then served as apprentice to James Earle in 1797, becoming one of the privileged class of surgeon's pupils at St Bartholomew's Hospital. He was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons on 18 December 1801, and set up practice in the West End of London. On 5 July 1806 he married Caroline Mackenzie. They had two children.<br>
<br>Wadd was a member of the council of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1824, and he was appointed a member of the court of examiners in succession to John Abernethy on 3 August 1829. He was appointed one of the surgeons-extraordinary to the prince regent on 19 August 1817, and surgeon-extraordinary to George IV on 30 March 1821.<br>
<br>Wadd was killed on 29 August 1829 when he jumped from a runaway carriage on the road from Killarney to Mitchelstown, while he was on holiday in Ireland. At the time of his death he was a fellow of the Linnean Society and an associate of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de M&eacute;decine of Paris. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>A man of high talents, Wadd had a rich fund of anecdotes. He was an excellent draughtsman, and his etchings were so skilled that he illustrated all his works himself. Wadd was the author of several medical texts, including <span class="italic">Comments on Corpulency, Lineaments of Leanness, Mems on Diet and Dietetics</span> (1829), which is illustrated by his own caricature etchings. He is, however, best known for <span class="italic">Nugae chirurgicae, or, A biographical miscellany illustrative of a collection of professional portraits</span> (1824). The nucleus of the collection of portraits was presented to him about 1814 by Henry Fauntleroy, the banker, who was hanged for forgery. The catalogue is arranged under two alphabets&#151;one of anecdotal biographies, the other of memorabilia. It is interesting reading but contains many errors. Both <span class="italic">Nugae canorae, or, Epitaphian mementoes (in stone-cutters' verse) of the Medici family, by Unus Quorum</span> (1827) and <span class="italic">Mems, Maxims, and Memoirs</span> (1827) contain a miscellany of things medical, and of the history of medicine and surgery in England.<br>
