<span class="headword">Kirkall,  Elisha</span>  (1681/2&#150;1742), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born at Sheffield in Yorkshire in 1681 or 1682 (Vertue gave his age as forty in 1722) and became one of the most enterprising and engaging engraver&#150;publishers of his generation. According to George Vertue his father was a locksmith and in Sheffield he &#145;had some small beginnings to Engrave&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 3.6). He arrived in London about 1702 and an early trade card advertises him as a jobbing engraver, undertaking &#145;All sorts of engraving as Steel &amp; Silver Seals with Flat Stitch upon Copper Plates large or small, &amp; coats of arms according to true Heraldry&#146;  (trade card, British Museum). But Kirkall soon made or exploited one very marketable discovery: &#145;an Invention of engraving on the same sort of Metal which Types are cast with&#146;  (Jackson, 26). He was the first to produce a design cut in relief in metal so that it could be set with ordinary type. This innovation proved extremely popular with the book trade, and Kirkall produced a very large number of headpieces, tailpieces, and capitals. It would appear that he married soon after he arrived in London: another trade card, cut in relief on metal and advertising the names of Elisha and Elizabeth Kirkall, is dated 31 August 1707. The card possibly implies that Elizabeth Kirkall shared her husband's work. His output was certainly prodigious. Vertue, who was not habitually generous to his rivals, referred to Kirkall as &#145;an Industrious man&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 6.188) and over the following decades he produced a very large number of book illustrations in etching or in metalcut sometimes, as with Samuel Croxall's <span class="italic">Fables</span> (1722), cut in white line. They include a set of tiny prayer-book illustrations after Le Fage for Lintott (1714) and plates to illustrate Terence (1713), Ovid (1717), Dryden (1717), Lucan (1718), and Pope's <span class="italic">Iliad</span> (1715&#150;20) as well as a wide variety of other works including Richard Bradley's <span class="italic">The Gentleman and Gardener's Kalendar</span> (1718).<br>
<br>Kirkall was a member of the Great Queen Street Academy and benefited both from Louis Ch&eacute;ron's lessons in life drawing and from the network of professional contacts that radiated from the academy and its convivial counterpart, the Rose and Crown Club. Kirkall's career suddenly blossomed as a result of a scheme to imitate sixteenth-century drawings in the collections of leading virtuosi in a &#145;chiaroscuro&#146; technique superficially resembling that of the Renaissance artist Ugo da Carpi. To judge from the subscription ticket the scheme was launched in 1722, and prints were delivered in late 1724. Kirkall printed in relief from metal plates using rocker-work for tone and, although Jackson stated that &#145;the Curious complained, that the ancient manner of Hugo di Carpi was not found in this Performance&#146;  (Jackson, 31), Kirkall's achievement was widely admired. The project promoted Kirkall as a serious artist and prompted similar schemes to publish paintings in noble collections. In 1727 he issued sixteen seascapes by the van de Velde printed in sea-green ink from which Vertue gathered that Kirkall made almost &pound;1000. Kirkall went on to scrape numerous other decorative &#145;chiaroscuro&#146; mezzotints including copies of William Hogarth's <span class="italic">Harlot's Progress</span> (1732) and maritime subjects including a set after Peter Monamy, twelve prints of the whale fishery, and six of the East India Company's settlements.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Kirkall continued his prolific and versatile output of commissioned work, engraving eight plates for Thomas Baston's <span class="italic">Twenty-Two Ships of his Majesty's Navy</span> (1726), seventy-three plates for James Gibbs's <span class="italic">A Book of Architecture</span> (1728), and a large number of antiquarian subjects, chiefly for William Stukeley. He engraved innovative colour-printed plates for John Martyn's <span class="italic">Historia plantarum rariorum</span> (1728) and for the <span class="italic">Catalogus plantarum</span> (1730) published by London's leading gardeners. From at least 1724 he lived around Fleet Street, first in Wine-Office Court and then in Dogwell Court. In 1731 his son Charles was apprenticed to the portrait painter Gawen Hamilton. By the time of Kirkall's death his wife, Elizabeth, had died and he had married a second woman, named Deborah. According to Vertue he died in December 1742 at Whitefriars, Fleet Street, having lived in London &#145;near 40 years&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 3.113). His son Charles proved his will on 26 January 1743. Most of his copperplates were bought by the Bowles family. An album in the British Museum contains fine examples of many of his prints. Other examples can be found in the Bodleian Library and Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and the National Maritime Museum, London.<br>
