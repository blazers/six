<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mansel,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1265), <span class="occ">administrator and royal councillor</span>, is said by Matthew Paris to have been the son of a country priest. A papal letter of 1259, confirming a dispensation granted to Mansel by Pope Innocent IV, reports that Mansel's father, a man of noble family, married Mansel's mother and lived with her as his wife without revealing the fact that he had previously been ordained a deacon. Repenting of his conduct, Mansel's father later returned to his orders and a divorce was declared between the couple by the local diocesan. The resulting imputation of illegitimacy clung to Mansel and his siblings throughout their lives, and may go some way toward explaining Mansel's own restless pursuit of property and preferment.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsinroyalservice"></a>Early years in royal service</h2>Mansel entered royal service as a young man, but it is not known how or when he did so. He is first recorded as a clerk at the exchequer of receipt, where from July 1234 until October 1236 he kept one set of the receipt rolls. From October 1236 to April 1238 he was chamberlain of the king's wines at Southampton. He continued his associations with the receipt, however, where the bulk of the revenue from the thirtieth of 1237 passed through his hands. In 1238 Mansel went with a detachment of troops supplied by King Henry to support Emperor Frederick II's military campaigns in Lombardy. Mansel may have been sent on this expedition as paymaster, but he also took an active part in the fighting, earning a reputation as a soldier he would further enhance in Gascony.<br>
<br>Mansel's movements from 1239 until 1242 are poorly documented. He was abroad on royal service in October 1239 and in August 1240. Already, however, he had begun to accumulate the vast combination of custodies, lands, and ecclesiastical offices that would make him, by the 1250s, the wealthiest of all King Henry's clerical administrators. In 1235 he was presented to the church at Bawburgh, Norfolk. In 1238 he acquired custody of the lands and heirs of Adam Fitzwilliam. In 1240 and 1241 the king granted him several manors formerly held by the disgraced keeper of the royal seal, Master Simon d'&Eacute;telan. In 1241 he received a papal provision to the prebend of Thame, but when Bishop Robert Grosseteste of Lincoln resisted the provision Mansel resigned his claim. King Henry made good the loss, appointing Mansel to the church of Maidstone, Kent, and to two prebends at St Paul's Cathedral. Mansel already held the church at Haughley, Suffolk, and the prebend of Malling South in Kent. In May 1243 the king appointed him chancellor of St Paul's also.<br>
<br>Mansel accompanied the king's expedition of 1242&#150;3 to Gascony, where once again he distinguished himself as a soldier. In July 1242, at the battle of Saintes, Mansel unhorsed and captured Pierre Orige, the count of Boulogne's seneschal. In November 1242 Henry appointed Mansel custodian of Gascony until a seneschal could be found, and in February 1243 made him seneschal. Shortly thereafter, however, his military career came to an end. While participating in the siege of the monastery of V&eacute;rines in Bordeaux, he was seriously wounded by a stone hurled by the defenders that crushed his leg. Nursed back to health by Master Pierre de Montibus, physician to Peter of Savoy, Mansel remained in Gascony until the end of September 1243, when he returned with the king to England. Mansel's injury cemented the king's attachment to him. The court poet, Master Henry d'Avranches, addressed a poem to &#145;John Mansel's Leg&#146;, and stories of Mansel's bravery circulated widely.<h2>
<a name="Royalcouncillor"></a>Royal councillor</h2>Mansel's influence with the king continued to grow. In 1244 he became a member of the king's council, a position he would retain until 1263. In 1245 he was much involved in the diplomatic and administrative aspects of the king's campaign in Wales. From 8 November 1246 until 28 August 1247, and again from 17 August 1248 to 8 September 1249, he was keeper of the king's seal, an office he had briefly held in Gascony. Between 1247 and 1248 he carried out an unsuccessful mission to negotiate a marriage between Henry III's eldest son, the Lord Edward, and the daughter of the duke of Brabant. In November 1249 he fell violently ill at Maidstone, probably of food poisoning, but he was sufficiently recovered by March 1250 to take the cross with the king and other members of the royal household. In June 1250 he hosted a famous banquet for the Dominican general chapter meeting at Holborn. In October he went, with Peter Chaceporc, as the king's emissary to instruct the monks of Winchester to elect Henry's half-brother Aymer de Lusignan to the vacant bishopric.<br>
<br>Mansel's influence at court during these years extended well beyond the formal offices or the specific diplomatic duties entrusted to him. Between 1244 and 1258 Matthew Paris described him variously as the king's chief or special councillor and as his <i>secretarius</i>  (Paris, <span class="italic">Chron</span>.). The special intimacy such terms imply made Mansel a particularly valuable intercessor for those in need of the king's favour. In 1251 Mansel protected Henry of Bath, a royal justice accused of corruption, from the king's wrath, and then secured a pardon for him. He did the same for Philip Lovel, an exchequer official accused of accepting bribes from Jews in return for favourable tax assessments. Mansel himself had brought Lovel into the king's service. He now paid Lovel's fine, and arranged the petition by Alexander III, king of Scots, that restored Lovel to the king's favour. The following year Mansel engineered Lovel's appointment as royal treasurer. Mansel knew, however, not to press his influence too far. When in 1251 he was an arbiter (with William Button the elder, bishop of Bath and Wells) in a dispute between the abbot and convent of Westminster over the division of goods, although he was a friend of the abbot Mansel settled the affair by a compromise, one approved by Henry III.<h2>
<a name="Therewardsofoffice"></a>The rewards of office</h2>Such discretion brought Mansel a continuing series of rewards. In 1244 he acquired properties from the Arundel honour, including Wepeham and Bilsington, Kent, where he established an Augustinian priory. He also received a prebend in Chichester, along with another in a series of dispensations for pluralism. In 1246 Mansel was appointed dean of Wimborne in succession to Ranulf the Breton, and in 1247 became provost of Beverley, Yorkshire. He acquired many other livings also, among them Axminster in Devon; Howden and Hooton in Yorkshire; Wigan in Lancashire; and Ferring in Sussex. In 1251 he became a papal chaplain, and in 1256 the king appointed him treasurer of York, one of the richest benefices in the kingdom. Even before his promotion to York, however, Matthew Paris had declared Mansel the wealthiest cleric in England, estimating his annual income in the early 1250s at 4000 marks. The Melrose chronicler gave an even higher figure, and reported Mansel as having remarked, upon receiving a new benefice worth &pound;20 per year, &#145;This will provide for my dogs&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronicle of Melrose</span>, 214).<br>
<br>Mansel also took care to promote the interests of his family. In 1245 his nephew and namesake, Master John Mansel, became parson of the royal church at Lugwardine, Herefordshire, for which he received a series of royal protections. In 1251 he went abroad to study. When he returned, he entered royal service, where he worked closely with his uncle. Master John Mansel was most likely the son of Mansel's brother Reyner, who appears occasionally around the royal court during the 1250s as Brother Reyner, the brother of John Mansel. Sarah of Farlington, described as John Mansel's niece, may have been Master John Mansel's sister; if so, then Amabillia of London, niece and eventual heir of Master John Mansel, would perhaps have been the daughter of Sarah of Farlington.<br>
<br>Mansel seems to have been particularly attached to his two sisters. He arranged their marriages and directed a stream of royal gifts towards them. It was probably for Emma that Mansel was promised a marriage worth &pound;30 or more by the king in 1238. She eventually married Alard the Fleming, a royal tenant-in-chief who served John Mansel as a squire until he was knighted by the king in 1251. Their daughter Joan married Henry Huse, son and heir of Matthew Huse, in a match arranged by Mansel in 1252&#150;3. Like Alard the Fleming, Henry Huse also became a member of Mansel's <i>familia</i>, serving Mansel during the early 1260s. Mansel's other sister, Claricia, married Geoffrey of Childwick, a royal marshal and one of the most troublesome of the knightly tenants of St Albans Abbey. Matthew Paris claimed that Mansel sustained Childwick in his quarrels with the abbey, and that Mansel used his influence at court to frustrate the abbey's attempts to get justice against Childwick. Professional pleaders refused to take the abbey's case, and the royal justices declared that John Mansel so dominated the kingdom that they were afraid to give sentence against him. Mansel eventually offered the abbey his good favour, however, and the abbey, realizing they were beaten, settled with Childwick.<h2>
<a name="Diplomaticactivities"></a>Diplomatic activities</h2>Mansel had already gained considerable knowledge of Gascony in 1242&#150;3. After the collapse of Simon de Montfort's lieutenancy in Gascony, however, Mansel emerged as the man principally in charge of Henry III's Gascon and Spanish diplomacy. As such, Mansel led the diplomatic mission of 1253&#150;4 to Castile that culminated in the marriage of the Lord Edward to Eleanor of Castile, and that produced, in consequence, King Alfonso's formal cession of Castilian claims to Gascony. Mansel was accompanied on this mission first by the bishop of Bath and later by the bishop of Hereford, but it was upon Mansel and his confidential clerk, Master John Clarel, that the burden of the negotiations rested, and to whom the credit for their success is due. Mansel continued to advise the king on Gascon and Castilian affairs thereafter. He went on several further diplomatic missions himself, and wrote lengthy letters of instruction when other royal officials were sent in his stead.<br>
<br>Less clear is Mansel's role in negotiating the disastrous grant by the papacy of the Sicilian throne to Henry's second son, Edmund. Mansel was absent from court during the last half of 1253 and early 1254. It seems unlikely, therefore, that he could have been one of the principal architects of the Sicilian scheme that came to fruition during these months. He was, however, present with the king in Gascony during March 1254 when Henry accepted the papal offer, and at the king's command he set his own seal on the formal documents accepting the papal terms. There are hints he may have done so reluctantly, but if so, his objections were more likely to the terms of the offer than to the offer itself. He gave steady support to the Sicilian project thereafter, even when other royal councillors, such as Bishop Walter de Cantilupe of Worcester, outspokenly opposed it.<br>
<br>Mansel's direct diplomatic involvements were not limited to Gascony and Castile. He was a key figure in the king's campaign to put Richard, earl of Cornwall, on the throne of Germany. He planned the mission of 1256 by Robert Walerand and the earl of Gloucester to sound out support for Richard among the German princes, and he accompanied Gloucester on a similar mission in 1257. Mansel was also a frequent visitor to the Scottish court during the 1250s, where he was sent several times by King Henry to restore peace between Henry's daughter and her husband, the young king of Scots, and the guardians of the Scottish kingdom.<h2>
<a name="Relationswiththebaronialreformers"></a>Relations with the baronial reformers</h2>When the baronial reform movement began in 1258, Mansel was one of three royalist representatives appointed to the new royal council of fifteen. He was clearly trusted by the reformist party, despite his long association with the king. His clerk, John Clarel, was sent to Rome to negotiate new terms for &#145;the Sicilian business&#146;, and Mansel himself was put in charge of Aymer de Lusignan's confiscated property at Tickhill. In August Mansel went once again to Scotland, and in September his nephew, Master John Mansel, received the prebend of Fenton, Yorkshire, a gift that quickly embroiled him with the pope, who had provided another claimant. Mansel was a frequent target of complaint in Hugh Bigod's judicial eyre of 1258&#150;9, but he continued as one of the key members of the council throughout the summer and autumn of 1259. He played an active role in negotiating that year's treaty of Paris, including the settlement of Eleanor de Montfort's dower claims, but was reluctant to agree to the alienation of any royal demesne lands to her. Hostility between Mansel and the Montforts grew steadily thereafter.<br>
<br>In November 1259 Mansel went to Paris with the king, and in February 1260 witnessed the letters by which Henry delayed a scheduled meeting of parliament. With Peter of Savoy, Richard of Cornwall, and Robert Walerand, Mansel began now to plan the gradual restoration of the king's authority. The council of fifteen finally collapsed in December 1260; in January 1261 Master John Mansel was sent to Rome to ask Pope Alexander IV to absolve King Henry from his oaths to observe the provisions of Oxford. In February Mansel and the king withdrew into the Tower of London to await events. In May Mansel was appointed constable of the Tower. In June he travelled personally to Winchester to warn Henry of the danger he was in, and to accompany him back to London. Henry and Mansel remained in the Tower continuously from 22 June until 30 July. By the time they emerged, the resistance was over. On 21 November Mansel negotiated the treaty of Kingston, by which the reformers effectively abandoned the provisions of Oxford. The king's coup was completed in May 1262, when Pope Urban IV reissued his predecessor's decree annulling the provisions. The bull was addressed to Archbishop Boniface of Canterbury, Bishop Simon of Norwich, and to John Mansel, treasurer of York.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsanddeath"></a>Last years and death</h2>By July 1262 King Henry felt sufficiently secure to return to France. Mansel did not join him until the end of August. By October, however, Mansel was so alarmed by the news from England that he begged the king to abandon his pilgrimage and return to England. Henry would not agree, however, and he and Mansel remained abroad until 20 December 1262. In the spring of 1263 Mansel's lands were a particular target of attack by Montfort's partisans, who blamed him for the papal quashing of the provisions. Once again Henry and Mansel retreated to the Tower, but this time the munitions were inadequate to sustain a siege. Mansel fled down the Thames and across the channel. His properties were immediately confiscated and given to Simon de Montfort the younger.<br>
<br>In September 1263 Mansel appeared at the Boulogne conference between Montfort, King Henry, and King Louis of France, to plead for the return of his lands. In November it seemed briefly that Mansel's pleas would be answered. Henry recovered his authority, revoked the grant to young Simon, and placed Mansel's lands in the hands of royal custodians. Mansel himself, however, remained in exile, his return to England blocked by Henry's failure, in December 1263, to secure control over Dover Castle. In January 1264 Mansel was again at King Louis's court, this time for the mise of Amiens. Louis's arbitration failed, however, and the resulting civil war left King Henry a prisoner in Montfort's hands. During the summer and autumn of 1264 Mansel co-operated with the queen, Archbishop Boniface, Peter of Savoy, William de Valence, and others of the royalist exiles to mount an invasion of England from Flanders. No invasion was ever launched, however, and in early 1265 Mansel died in exile. News of his death had reached England by 7 February 1265, when Montfort appointed his youngest son Amaury to succeed Mansel as treasurer of York.<br>
<br>Mansel's executors were unable to act until after Montfort's defeat and death at the battle of Evesham on 3 August 1265. But in November they were granted free administration of all his property. None of his property, however, seems to have descended to his heirs. His sister Emma outlived him, and was able to have the manors her brother had given her during his lifetime confirmed to her by the crown. Master John Mansel died within the year, leaving his own London houses to his niece Amabillia of Ripon. Nothing of his uncle's property, however, seems to have passed to him. Mansel left Bilsington Priory to King Henry, who in 1272 proposed to give it to the church of St Mary at Boulogne. But the remainder of Mansel's vast estate appears to have been treated as a crown escheat. Perhaps this was appropriate for a man whose labours on behalf of the crown, in so many different spheres, had brought him such rewards. Contemporaries were in no doubt as to Mansel's importance in matters of state. The value which the king placed on his services was noted by Matthew Paris, but most eloquently expressed by Henry III himself, in a message sent to the pope in 1262: &#145;He was trained under my wing. I have tested his ability, his character and merits since his boyhood. He has always been serviceable and loyal in my affairs and in those of the kingdom&#146;  (Powicke, 294).<br>
