<span class="headword">Cotton,  Agnes</span>  (1828&#150;1899), <span class="occ">social reformer and philanthropist</span>, was born on 27 February 1828 at Walwood House, Leytonstone, Essex, the sixth of the seven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6432/', "William Cotton (1786&#150;1866)")</script>, merchant and director of the Bank of England, and Sarah (1790&#150;1872), only daughter of Thomas Lane of Leyton Grange, Leyton, Essex, and his wife, Barbara. Her siblings included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6433/', "William Charles Cotton (1813&#150;1879)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6414/', "Cotton, Sir Henry")</script>], a clergyman and writer on bees; Sarah Acland (1815&#150;1878), wife of Sir Henry Wentworth Acland; Phoebe (1817&#150;1857), an illustrator; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6414/', "Sir Henry Cotton (1821&#150;1892)")</script>, a lord justice of appeal. Both parents were evangelical Anglicans, heavily involved in philanthropic activities. Sarah and Phoebe Cotton received a rigorous academic education from their mother, although in 1842 Agnes was at boarding-school.<br>
<br>According to one account, after miraculously recovering from an illness at the age of fourteen, Agnes Cotton &#145;dedicated herself and her subsequent possessions to the service of God&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pastures Youth Centre</span>, 3). Surviving letters from the 1840s show that she was very devout and was influenced by the Oxford Movement. By the age of eighteen she was actively involved in philanthropy, both assisting the projects of family members and taking her own initiatives in connection with the care of local children.<br>
<br>Agnes Cotton was short and wore spectacles from about the age of seventeen. Surviving portraits in middle age show her in nun's dress, though not that of the Community of St John Baptist, Clewer, of which she may have become an associate. Gulielma Lister (<i>b</i>. 1860) recalled that, when she was a child living in Leytonstone, Cotton &#145;wore a black habit and veil&#146; and &#145;we regarded her with horror as a &#147;nun&#148;&#146;. However, Gulielma's father, Arthur Lister, very much admired Cotton and &#145;enjoyed her racy humour&#146;  (Lister and Lister, 2&#150;3). By 1889 she was known in the locality as Sister Agnes  (<span class="italic">Forest School Magazine</span>, 11&#150;12).<br>
<br>In Lent 1865 Cotton began a &#145;small industrial home for destitute children&#146; in Forest Place, Leytonstone, later described as &#145;the first Church of England home for fallen children&#146;. In 1876 she purchased a property in Davies Lane, Leytonstone, which she renamed The Pastures and inhabited from 1877 to 1899. Between 1879 and 1881 Cotton had built beside it the Home of the Good Shepherd, with a chapel, schoolhouse, infirmary, and laundry, at a total cost of &pound;9500. The initial aim of the home was to provide a special kind of care for girls who had been &#145;led into habits of impurity&#146;  (Cotton, 1), but not to be a reformatory for juvenile delinquents. Industrial training was provided in laundry work. Numbers rose from six to twenty in 1865, and to thirty by 1871. In 1882 the home was registered under the <span class="roman">Criminal Law Amendment Act</span> to receive forty girls, and certified to receive fifty in 1892.<br>
<br>In 1865 there were two male trustees, while by 1885 the home had acquired a more formal structure, with a male warden and an all-male council (which included five of Cotton's relatives). However, between 1865 and 1885, Cotton, known variously as &#145;mother&#146;, &#145;foundress&#146;, and &#145;superintendent&#146;, remained the chief organizer. To start with the home was financed through Cotton's own fortune and through the fund-raising and publicizing efforts of family and friends, both male and female. These included four people connected with houses of mercy in Soho, Hammersmith, Horbury, and Birmingham. A pamphlet written by Cotton and distributed in 1865 resulted in many gifts in kind from local tradespeople. However, by 1885 about half the school's income came from the Treasury and school boards.<br>
<br>Despite the rhetoric of &#145;love&#146; and &#145;care&#146; in the reports, and the approval expressed in guidebooks to Leyton, in 1894 widely publicized allegations of ill treatment were made. The Revd A. Drew, chairman of the industrial schools committee of the London school board, demanded a Home Office inquiry. Cotton was exonerated by Inspector William Inglis, who concluded that &#145;a better and kinder old lady does not live&#146;  (TNA: PRO, HO 45/9887/B17047/9). Nevertheless, her agreement with the London school board was terminated in 1895, and she formally resigned her industrial school certificate in 1897. This conflict may have been caused by insufficient supervision, by Cotton's differing approach to discipline from that of Revd Drew, or because Cotton had become too old and infirm to manage the home effectively.<br>
<br>Agnes Cotton died, unmarried, on 20 May 1899 at The Pastures, Leytonstone. She was buried in the Cotton family vault in St John's churchyard, Leytonstone, on 24 May. The bulk of her personal effects and property were bequeathed in trust to her ward, Mary Agnes Hope; Elizabeth Amelia Bragg, spinster of Clapton, who had for many years helped Cotton with her work, received an annuity of &pound;50. By previous arrangement, the home was taken over by the sisters of the Community of St John Baptist, Clewer, one of the new Anglican orders involved in &#145;rescue work&#146;. The home survived until 1940, when it was evacuated to Northamptonshire and then dissolved.<br>
<br>Agnes Cotton's life's work shows a transition from informal charity undertaken with family members to the creation of a new kind of philanthropic institution which survived for eighty-five years. Initially supported by networks of family, friends, and clergy, by the 1880s her home was receiving much-needed state funding. However, in the long term a religious order proved to be a more secure form of support than the state.<br>
