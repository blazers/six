</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fanshawe, Sir  Richard</span>, first baronet  (1608&#150;1666), <span class="occ">diplomat and translator</span>, was born in June 1608 at Ware Park, Hertfordshire, and baptized on 12 June, the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9148/', "Sir Henry Fanshawe (1569&#150;1616)")</script>, exchequer official, and his wife, Elizabeth Smythe (1577?&#150;1631). The household into which he was born was on a scale appropriate to a senior royal servant who could trace gentry status back to the medieval Fanshawe family of Derbyshire, but was unusual for the degree to which its master, Fanshawe's father, cultivated the arts. His friend Sir Henry Wotton remarked on his advanced taste in gardening and his horticultural experiments, and the composer John Ward was retained as part of an exceptionally lavish musical establishment.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlytravels"></a>Education and early travels</h2>Sir Henry Fanshawe died in 1616 leaving his widow in charge of the upbringing of their youngest son, who entered Thomas Farnaby's school in Cripplegate, London, about 1620. Three years later, on 12 November 1623, he was admitted to Jesus College, Cambridge, where his tutor, Dr Beale, encouraged his first efforts in poetry. His first datable poem, a Latin ode to the University of Cambridge, gives early evidence of the mastery of Latin for which he was to be famous in later life. Fanshawe did not take a degree and on 22 January 1626 entered the Inner Temple, but &#145;it seemed so crabbed a study and disagreeable to his inclinations that he rather studyed to obey his mother than to make any progress in the law&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, ed. Loftis, 112). On the death of his mother in 1631 Fanshawe went to Paris, where he lost much of his stock of money gambling with two English exiled priests (despite which he declined to betray one of them whom he recognized, though incognito, in England many years later). He spent about a year in Paris, studying the language, although he never made any translations from the French. After a year he travelled to Madrid and laid the foundations of the mastery of Spanish which was to be central both to his diplomatic career and to his career as a translator of Spanish literature.<br>
<br>On his return to London two years later Fanshawe's linguistic accomplishments were such that he was appointed secretary to the new ambassador to Madrid, Walter Aston, Lord Aston; he returned to Madrid with his embassy in 1635. The Astons of Tixall, who were to form a significant element in Fanshawe's cultural circle in the 1630s, were a focus over three generations for the collection and dissemination of poetry and translations. From their houses in Staffordshire they circulated manuscripts of verse and songs to their wide network of relations, most of whom were, like themselves, Catholic recusants. It seems likely from the frequent plays on the words &#145;Constance&#146; and &#145;Constancie&#146; in Fanshawe's poems and translations of the 1630s, as well as from two poems of compliment dated at Tixall in Staffordshire in the autumn of 1636, that Fanshawe was to some degree attached to Constance Aston, the ambassador's daughter. Certainly, a number of his poems appear in her manuscript commonplace book (Hunt., HM 904). It seems likely that this close acquaintance with a recusant family developed Fanshawe's highly tolerant religious position: although his wife's memoirs, the chief source for his biography, insist on his loyalty to the Church of England, he seems to have been unusually integrated into the court society of Spain and Portugal, and to have numbered many Catholics, in Ireland as well as on the continent, among his close friends.<br>
<br>It was about this time that the first surviving manuscript collection of Fanshawe's poems (BL, Add. MS 15228) was assembled. Clearly compiled for Fanshawe himself, as his autograph corrections suggest, it ranges from his early Latin ode on leaving Cambridge to the apprentice pieces of his years at the Inner Temple, several of which focus on his dislike of legal study and his preference for literary composition. There are a set of translations of the metrical portions of Boethius's <span class="italic">De consolatione philosophiae</span>, which he never published, as well as the first attempts at the verse translation of the odes of Horace, which were eventually to be published in 1652. This manuscript also preserves a number of less successful translations from the epigrams of Martial, some of them possibly undertaken in collaboration with Robert Heath (<i>bap</i>. 1620, <i>d</i>. in or after 1685), the son of the lord chief justice. From this period also there survive a few amatory poems, which were never printed, much in the style of Ben Jonson or of his immediate followers.<br>
<br>In 1638, once more in Spain, Fanshawe was left as charg&eacute; d'affaires in Madrid between the departure of Lord Aston and the arrival of the new ambassador, Sir Arthur Hopton, after which he returned to London. No government post was forthcoming, a state of affairs which Lady Fanshawe's memoirs, surely inaccurately, attributes to the hostility of the Catholic secretary of state, Francis Windebank, to the protestant Fanshawe. In any case, Fanshawe was appointed as secretary to the council of war in Ireland, where he appears to have spent the years 1639&#150;41. In the latter year his eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9151/', "Sir Thomas Fanshawe (1596&#150;1665)")</script>, put him into the family post of king's remembrancer, with the proviso that he should either share the income of the post or buy it for himself outright within seven years.<h2>
<a name="Royalistactivityandpublicationsinthe1640s"></a>Royalist activity and publications in the 1640s</h2>On the outbreak of hostilities Fanshawe, &#145;for being the King's sworn servant&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, ed. Loftis, 113), joined the court at Oxford. He seems to have done so out of conviction, as well as out of family loyalty. Before his departure to join the king, John Aubrey records, Fanshawe debated their differences with the convinced parliamentarian poet Thomas May, with whom he had been closely associated in the later 1630s, and on whom he had written a commendatory Latin poem, &#145;Maius Lucanizans&#146; (which, characteristically, he chose to publish in his patently royalist volume of 1648). On 18 May 1644 Fanshawe married his second cousin and Hertfordshire neighbour Ann Harrison (1625&#150;1680) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9146/', "Fanshawe, Ann, Lady Fanshawe")</script>] at Wolvercote church near Oxford. The best portrait of Fanshawe, by William Dobson, was probably painted to mark the occasion: it shows the poet holding papers, accompanied by a dog, emblematic of fidelity, with a curious Arcadian background in which a scene from Battista Guarini's immensely popular pastoral tragi-comedy <span class="italic">Il pastor fido</span> (of which Fanshawe's eloquent translation was composed presumably in the earlier 1640s) is being enacted. This exceptionally happy marriage, which lasted until Fanshawe's death, is documented in detail in his wife's memoirs.<br>
<br>About this time a substantial and handsome scribal manuscript of Fanshawe's poems and translations was compiled, perhaps for Edward Conway, Viscount Conway, whose arms are on the binding. This manuscript (Bodl. Oxf., MS Firth c. 1) contains a collection of translations from Horace, in a much more polished form than they are found in the earlier manuscript now in the British Library. There are also a number of translations from the Spanish of Gongora and Argensola. These are stylistically remarkable: the baroque of the Spanish golden age elicits an answering baroque diction from Fanshawe, not wholly dissimilar from the stylistic achievements of Richard Crashaw.<br>
<br>Late in 1644 Fanshawe was appointed secretary for war to the prince of Wales. The following year he moved with the prince's court from Oxford to Bristol, then to Barnstaple, Devon (by July), Tavistock (by January 1646), Cornwall, the Isles of Scilly (by March), and Jersey (April), at which time a remarkable collection of intellectual and literary supporters of the Stuarts were gathered in the Channel Islands. By the end of the summer Fanshawe was in Caen and his wife in London. He seems for the rest of the year to have acted as a royalist messenger on the continent. In August 1647 he travelled incognito to London, perhaps in connection with the publication that year of his translation of <span class="italic">Il pastor fido</span>. His translation emphasized the work's applicability to the contemporary condition of England, placing much hope for the future on the figure of the prince of Wales. In the early autumn Fanshawe visited Charles I at Hampton Court and received instructions (dated 9 October) to go to Spain as Charles's ambassador-extraordinary. He and his wife seem to have got no further than Paris, where they visited Henrietta Maria in September.<br>
<br>In the last few days of the year Fanshawe returned to England and, his estates having been sequestered, compounded for &pound;300, living privately in London thereafter. The translation of <span class="italic">Il pastor fido</span> was reissued in 1648 with a carefully arranged supplement of original poems and translations, all of which might be read in one way or another as texts encouraging, or offering counsel to, the prince of Wales. Among the more significant is a translation of Gongora's sonnet on the fall of a royal favourite, imitated so as to apply to the earl of Strafford, and a translation of book 4 of the <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> in Spenserian stanzas which emphasizes parallels between the exiled Aeneas and the exiled Charles Stuart. In September Fanshawe was summoned to attend the prince of Wales and went to Paris in October and thence to Ireland, arriving in Cork by the end of November. Part of Fanshawe's mission to Ireland was to compose and deliver an appeal for support to Lord Inchiquin. It may also be conjectured that his accomplishments as a Latinist commended him for diplomatic duty in a country where Latin would seem to have been the chief medium of communication between the English and the native aristocracy.<h2>
<a name="Literaryoutputduringtheinterregnum"></a>Literary output during the interregnum</h2>The Fanshawes seem to have spent most of 1649 in Ireland, until the arrival of instructions from the exiled prince of Wales, now the uncrowned Charles II, in a letter dated 20/30 August, ordering Fanshawe again to Spain, to meet Sir Edward Hyde and Lord Cottington at San Sebastian. In February 1650 the Fanshawes sailed from Galway to Malaga, where they arrived by the end of March; they then went on to Madrid, where they remained until July. In the autumn they travelled via San Sebastian and Paris to Calais, where they parted on 9/19 November, Lady Fanshawe travelling to London while Fanshawe travelled via the Netherlands to join Charles II's forlorn campaign in Scotland. On his arrival he was created baronet.<br>
<br>Fanshawe followed the king through the campaign until its ignominious end at the battle of Worcester in September 1651. Taken prisoner, he was sent to London and kept in custody until his wife obtained his release on grounds of ill health in November. He appears to have agreed at this point not to publish any political writings. He continued in ill health for the first half of 1652, during which time the first issue of his substantial translation of the odes, epodes, and satires of Horace was printed as <span class="italic">Selected Parts of Horace, Prince of Lyricks</span>. After his recovery and a convalescent journey to Bath in August a second, much corrected, issue of <span class="italic">Selected Parts of Horace</span> appeared. In March 1653 the Fanshawes took up residence, for the one brief period of stability which their lives afforded, at Tankersley Park near Sheffield. In a remarkable burst of literary energy it was here that Fanshawe translated most extensively from modern peninsular literature. He made fluent English versions of a long, baroque court entertainment from the Spain of the earlier years of Philip IV, <span class="italic">Querer por solo querer</span> and <span class="italic">Fiestas de Aranjuez</span>, and of the national poem of Portugal by Luis de Cam&otilde;es, the latter published as <span class="italic">The Lusiad</span> in 1655 and a portion translated into Virgilian hexameters. It may be conjectured that he also completed here the greater part of his superb translation into Latin of John Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Faithful Shepherdess</span>, first published in 1658 as <span class="italic">La fida pastora</span> together with a collection of Fanshawe's previously published Latin poems. However, in the late summer of 1654, a daughter, Ann, died, lamented greatly by both parents, and they removed to Huntingdonshire. For the next few years they lived in rented houses and lodgings, never in very good health.<br>
<br>After the death of Oliver Cromwell in September 1658 Fanshawe seems to have decided to rejoin Charles II in exile: he travelled to Paris in November and was appointed as Charles's secretary of the Latin tongue in June the following year, by which time his wife had joined him. By April 1660 Fanshawe was with Charles's court in Breda, and was knighted there, having already been appointed master of the requests, although later in the same year he failed to secure the position of one of the secretaries of state.<h2>
<a name="TheRestorationandtheembassiestoPortugalandSpain"></a>The Restoration and the embassies to Portugal and Spain</h2>At the king's return to England in May the Fanshawes returned in his train and took lodgings in Portugal Row in London. In the Restoration parliament, Fanshawe was elected MP for Cambridge University. On 23 August he received (presumably secret) instructions from Charles to gather information on Portugal's international position, and at the end of the same month he received a letter which appointed him temporary ordinary ambassador with the duties also of an envoy-extraordinary to conclude the negotiations for the marriage between Charles and Catherine of Braganza. He departed for Lisbon in September, returning to London in December. In this year, the greater part of Fanshawe's Horatian volume was reissued by Alexander Brome as part of his <span class="italic">Poems of Horace</span>.<br>
<br>In 1662, after having attended the royal wedding, Fanshawe was once again sent as ambassador to Portugal. Letters confirming his appointment were dispatched in August and Fanshawe and his family departed for Lisbon the same month. The fair-copy manuscript of the Latin versions from Cam&otilde;es (Funda&ccedil;ao da Casa de Braganza, Villa Vicosa, Portugal) was probably completed in Lisbon during 1663. In August Fanshawe was again recalled to England, arriving in London in early September. He was appointed a privy councillor on 21 September and sworn in on 2 October.<br>
<br>Early in 1664 Fanshawe was appointed ambassador to Spain, a post which was to prove his last. With letters of credence from Charles II to Philip IV dated 13 January he left for Madrid on 21 January, with his family and a household which included the future dramatist William Wycherley and the lyric poet and emblematist Philip Ayres. After landing at Cadiz on 7 March, they travelled overland with full ambassadorial ceremony and were settled at Madrid by 16 August in the Casa de las Siete Chimeneas. During 1665 Fanshawe negotiated a peace treaty between England and Spain, and the &#145;articles for the adjustment between Spaine and Portugal&#146;. The treaty was signed by him and by the duke of Medina de las Torres on 17 December but was not ratified. Although Fanshawe's household protested that a draft had been sent to London allowing ample time for a reply, it was held in England that Fanshawe had exceeded his instructions. As a result of this, Fanshawe had barely returned to Madrid from his last journey to Portugal in March 1666 when he received his letters of recall and learned that the earl of Sandwich had been appointed in his place. Sandwich delivered his letters of revocation on arrival in Madrid in May. On the 5/15 of June Fanshawe was taken ill with an &#145;ague&#146; which turned to &#145;a malignant fever&#146;. He died eleven days later, at las Siete Chimeneas; his funeral was held according to Anglican custom in the embassy and his body was embalmed, then transported back to England to a place of temporary burial in All Hallows Church, Hertford, before permanent interment in St Mary's Church, Ware.<br>
<br>Fanshawe's translation of <span class="italic">Querer por solo querer</span> was issued posthumously, for private circulation in 1670 and commercially in 1671. His one surviving son, Richard, who had been born in Madrid in 1665, died in 1694. A number of Fanshawe's diplomatic letters were issued in 1702 as <span class="italic">Original Letters of his Excellency Sir Richard Fanshawe</span>, while his wife's detailed memoirs were first published in 1829. Much original evidence of his life survives: a significant volume of correspondence; despite many depredations, a substantial quantity of his loose papers at Valence House, Dagenham; several copies of his printed works with his autograph corrections; two fair-copy manuscripts of his earlier poems; and the presentation copy of his Latin version of Cam&otilde;es. Thus it is possible to trace in detail both his uncommon linguistic abilities and their deployment and the narrative of the colossal fortunes which his and his wife's families sank in various forms of support for the Stuarts, of which only a fragment ever returned to them, either as money or as any other form of reward.<br>
