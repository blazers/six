<span class="headword">Deas, Sir  George</span>  (1804&#150;1887), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 7 January 1804 at Falkland in Fife, the eldest son of Francis Deas (<i>d</i>. 1857), provost of Falkland, Fife, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of David Moyes. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7396/', "Sir David Deas")</script>, naval medical officer, was his brother. His initial schooling took place in Falkland and was then carried on in Perth, probably for some time at the Academy. His father was for some time deputy governor of Perth prison and the family then lived within its walls. Deas may also have attended school at Milnathort, Kinross-shire, during an unsuccessful attempt of his father's at farming there. After an early apprenticeship under Charles Gulland, writer, Deas worked initially for a practice in Cupar, and then moved to Edinburgh. In addition to legal work there he attended classes in logic, moral philosophy, and law at Edinburgh University. His work, marked by talent and great effort, was described by Professor Wilson as &#145;the perfection of clear, vulgar common sense&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 8 Feb 1887) and was rewarded by class prizes and an honorary MA for one essay. Deas was also a member, and in 1831&#150;2 president, of the Speculative Society. In later years he continued as an extraordinary member, taking an active part in the resolution of disputes between the university and the society over its accommodation in the mid-1860s, for example.<br>
<br>Deas was called to the Scottish bar on 10 June 1828 and quickly built up a large practice. He was helped by his thorough practical training and his extensive contacts with agents. He overcame prejudice about his lack of gentility by earning a reputation for delivering results through effort. He was not graceful or eloquent, but persistent and direct, and his shrewdness and plain talk went down well with juries.<br>
<br>On 14 August 1838 Deas married Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1818), daughter of Silvester Reid, writer to the signet. She died in August 1850. On 29 December 1857 Deas married Sarah (1816&#150;1899), daughter of Joseph Outram, merchant of Glasgow, and widow of Sir Benjamin Fonseca Outram CB MD of London, well known in Indian and medical circles. Among his children, Deas's eldest son, Francis, also became an advocate and wrote a work on railway law.<br>
<br>Deas had friends of influence, notably Admiral Erskine Wemyss, MP for Fife, and Edward Ellice the younger, MP for St Andrews burghs. He was appointed an advocate-depute in 1840, a position he held until the Melbourne ministry fell the following year and to which he was reappointed by the Russell administration in 1846. In 1850 he became sheriff of Ross and Cromarty and in 1851 he was made solicitor-general for Scotland under Lord Advocate James Moncreiff, holding this position until the whigs resigned in 1852. As Lord Aberdeen's whig-Peelite coalition tried to achieve a balance in its Scottish appointments, he was passed over for the same position in early 1853, but was appointed to the court of session as a lord ordinary in May of the same year, taking the courtesy title of Lord Deas. In 1854 he was also given responsibility for criminal cases as a lord of justiciary. On 10 February 1858 he was knighted.<br>
<br>It was as a judge that Deas made his mark. He was reputed to be the last on the bench to use the Scots vernacular. The struggles of his early life were one source of an outwardly hard character, spiced with a good sense of comedy. He avoided an abstract, philosophical approach to the law and approached questions from the practical side. Deas was a self-made man, driven by ambition, and this was reflected in his acerbity and impatience, especially with junior counsel. His opinions could be blunt and crushing, as for example in the Cardross case of the late 1850s and early 1860s when he held that the Free Church had no jurisdiction whatsoever, even ecclesiastical. Through his work as a circuit judge and as a result of press coverage he gained a contemporary reputation for being a voluminous authority on Scottish law and an awe-inspiring, hanging judge, especially when working with Glasgow juries. The trial and sentencing to death of Jessie (or Mary) McLachlan for murder in Glasgow in 1862 provided a controversial example of this. Deas was felt to have summed up the evidence very strongly against the accused and otherwise to have managed the trial unfairly. The resulting widespread calls and petitions in favour of a reprieve were successful in so far as Sir George Grey, the home secretary, decided in favour of an inquiry. This was carried out by George Young (later lord advocate) and resulted in the commutation of the sentence to penal servitude for life. Generally the case raised serious questions regarding the lack of a review procedure for cases heard in the high court of justiciary. Deas's reputation was also coloured by his apparent over-dependence on expert witnesses in medical matters. Such negative opinions were, however, balanced by examples of what he perhaps meant when he said he would be found to have left more poetry than law behind him. In the 1859 Maciver divorce case, for example, he acquitted a woman of all but indiscretion for visiting an old and dying lover.<br>
<br>Deas also earned a reputation for leniency with those who, because of a sudden temptation or violent emotion, made a single lapse into crime. An otherwise respectable background and good looks were said to help also. This attitude extended to those who could prove that they suffered from a mind temporarily weakened, for instance by a history of ill health. A well-known example of this is Deas's handling of the 1867 trial of Dingwall, an alcoholic, possibly epileptic Aberdeenshire laird who had killed his wife on the previous new year's eve. In his directions to the jury, Deas referred to Dingwall's repeated attacks of delirium tremens and advised them that state of mind could be an extenuating circumstance. Such a case did not, in his opinion, warrant acquittal on the grounds of insanity, but the jury could bring in a verdict of culpable homicide, which they then did. A similar case was that of Andrew Granger in 1878, who was also tried for murder, but found guilty, following Deas's directions, of culpable homicide. Deas was careful to point out before sentencing that simple intoxication would not have been sufficient grounds for such a verdict, but that a weak or diseased state of mind at the time of the act had been. Deas's role in these trials eventually took on a significance beyond Scotland when his attitude was referred to much later, and especially in the 1950s, in support of the introduction of a defence of diminished responsibility in murder trials in England. <br>
<br>An isolated figure in later years, Deas was said to have had more enemies than friends, but was noted for the care he invested in relationships with family and relatives. He was awarded the degree of LLD by Edinburgh University in 1884, the tercentenary of the founding of the university. Increasingly hard of hearing and ill, he resigned in February 1885. Deas died at his Edinburgh home, 32 Heriot Row, on 7 February 1887 and was buried on 11 February in the Warriston cemetery, Edinburgh. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
