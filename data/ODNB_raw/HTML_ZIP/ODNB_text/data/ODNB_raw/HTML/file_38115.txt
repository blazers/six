<span class="headword">Webster,  George</span>  (1797&#150;1864), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in Kendal, Westmorland, on 3 May 1797, the second of the three sons and third of the seven children of Francis Webster (1767&#150;1827), mason, builder, and architect of Kendal, and his first wife, Janet (1771&#150;1805), daughter of George Slater, yeoman of Kirkby Lonsdale, Westmorland. Where he received his training is not known&#151;an apprenticeship in a professional architect's office away from Kendal seems likely&#151;but as he did not attend the Royal Academy Schools it was probably elsewhere in the north rather than in London. On returning to become a partner in his father's business, he designed his first recorded work, Read Hall, near Whalley, Lancashire, in 1818 at the age of twenty-one and quickly appears to have become the principal architect member of the firm. He evidently then left his father to concentrate on the production of marble chimney-pieces and funerary monuments, which were his speciality. Thereafter during the 1820s and 1830s he greatly expanded the firm's architectural side&#151;following his father's death in 1827 he devoted his time entirely to architecture, leaving the management of the marble works to his younger brother, Francis&#151;and established a substantial practice in the north-west and the adjacent parts of Yorkshire. In 1827 he married Eleanor (1804&#150;1867), daughter of George Lowrey of Ulverston, Lancashire: they had one son and four daughters, of whom one died young.<br>
<br>Many of Webster's earliest works, including Read Hall and Rigmaden (1825), near Kirkby Lonsdale, are in an orthodox neo-classical manner which was also used by his father, but his principal contribution was as a pioneer in the scholarly revival of the Jacobean style. Two of his country houses, Eshton Hall, Yorkshire (1825&#150;7), and Underley Hall, near Kirkby Lonsdale (1825&#150;8), are among the very earliest examples of this idiom, as well as being notably accomplished productions which were singled out for praise in the preface to Henry Shaw's <span class="italic">Specimens of the Details of Elizabethan Architecture</span> (1839). Subsequent examples included Moreton Hall, Whalley (1829; dem.), while a further dimension of his work was the occasional introduction of details of a localized vernacular derivation&#151;as in his unexecuted designs for a house in Rydal, Westmorland, for William Wordsworth (1826), which incorporated the cylindrical chimneys characteristic of traditional building in the Lake District. From the early 1820s onwards he also designed a number of churches in a conventional Gothic style, but in some of his later works, such as his alterations to Broughton Hall, Yorkshire (1838&#150;41), and Flasby Hall, Yorkshire (1840), he experimented with the picturesque Italianate manner.<br>
<br>In 1845 Webster took into partnership his assistant Miles Thompson, who had been with the firm since the 1820s, and shortly after that he virtually retired from active business. From 1836 he visited Italy on more than one occasion, but these travels appear to have been prompted more by recreational than professional pursuits&#151;he made a collection of Roman coins, medals, and other antiquities&#151;and perhaps also by the state of his health. In 1829&#150;30, like his father before him, he served as mayor of Kendal, and in addition to the house he had built for himself in the town (<i>c</i>.1823) he had a country property at Lindale, Lancashire, which he inherited from his father, and he later built an occasional residence in nearby Grange-over-Sands. Webster died at his home, Ellerhow, Lindale, on 16 April 1864, leaving an estate of under &pound;25,000, and a collection of his architectural drawings. He was buried in Lindale churchyard.<br>
