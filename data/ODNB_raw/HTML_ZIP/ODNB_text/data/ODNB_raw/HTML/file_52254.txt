<span class="headword">Paycocke <span class="st"> [Peycocke]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1518), <span class="occ">clothier</span>, was a younger son of John Paycocke of Coggeshall (<i>d</i>. 1505) and his wife, Emma. His father was described as a butcher, though this must understate the range and interest of his activities. There were many families of Paycocke or Peycocke in Suffolk and Essex from at least the thirteenth century. It is likely that Thomas was born and died in the small Essex market town of Coggeshall, where his brothers John (<i>d</i>. 1533) and Robert (<i>d</i>. 1520) also lived. Thomas and Robert may have been first-generation clothiers. On his memorial brass (which recorded the day of his death as 4 September) Thomas was described as &#145;clothworker&#146;, and by his will (dated the same day) he made specified bequests to named textile workers&#151;two shearmen and their families, a weaver, a fuller, and a former apprentice. The broader scale of his cloth-making operations is better suggested by some further provisions:<blockquote>Item, I bequeth to all my wevers, Fullers and shermen that be not afore rehersed by name xij d. apece, and will they that haue wrought me verey moch wark haue iij s. iiijd. apece. Item I bequethe to be distributed amonge my kembers, carders and spynners summa iiij li. (Beaumont, 324)</blockquote>Nothing is known more precisely about the number of people he employed. He instructed his executors to give a broadcloth to the abbot and convent of Coggeshall, which perhaps indicates something about the sort of cloth he produced. The principal axis of Paycocke's trade, to judge from his will, was between Clare to the north and London to the south.<br>
<br>Paycocke married first Margaret, daughter of Thomas Horrold of Clare, and second Anne, daughter of George Cotton. In 1505, under the terms of his father's will, he inherited a newly built house in West Street, Coggeshall, which survives in the custody of the National Trust and has been described as &#145;one of the most attractive half-timbered houses of England&#146;  (Pevsner, 200). The elaborate wood carving that decorates the house includes, as a repeated motif, the family's merchant mark, an ermine tail. The house must have been intended specifically for Thomas Paycocke and his second wife, since their initials (T. P. and A. P.) recur in the oak rafters of the hall; it was perhaps built for them when they married. Thus Paycocke's chief claim to fame is perhaps his father's generosity, though a similar benevolence towards family, friends, and dependants is evident in his own will. After the death of his second wife it would seem that for want of a direct heir, the house passed to his nephew, John Paycocke. Paycocke is not known to have owned land.<br>
<br>Thomas Paycocke was a brother of the Crutched Friars of Colchester, whom he remembered in his will. He made numerous other bequests to local churches, as well as 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. to St Paul's in London&#151;&#145;to the old warke in Pawlis and to Powlis pardone&#146;  (Beaumont, 323). He also left the substantial sum of &pound;80 for repairing roads in Coggeshall and northwards towards Clare. He willed to be buried near his father, grandfather, and great-uncle in Coggeshall parish church. His monumental brass is lost, though that of his elder brother John survives. But he had the good fortune to be one of the six men and women commemorated in Eileen Power's <span class="italic">Medieval People</span>, first published in 1924 and many times reprinted, which has brought him a fame that his unremarkable career would never otherwise have earned for him.<br>
