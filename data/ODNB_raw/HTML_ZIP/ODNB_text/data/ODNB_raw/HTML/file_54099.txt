<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tegetmeier,  William Bernhardt</span>  (1816&#150;1912), <span class="occ">naturalist and journalist</span>, was born on 4 November 1816 at High Street, Colnbrook, Buckinghamshire, the eldest of three sons of Godfrey Conrad Tegetmeier (<i>d</i>. 1841), a surgeon who had emigrated from the American colonies, and Sarah, widow of Carl Luer and daughter of a Dr Norman of Langport in Somerset. The family moved to London when Tegetmeier was twelve, and he was apprenticed in 1831 to his father for five years. From 1833 to 1837 he attended lectures at University College, London, taking honours five times. His training then continued at University College Hospital, where he acted as clinical clerk to John Elliotson. For about two years Tegetmeier assisted Frederick Gee in Brackley, Northamptonshire, but he revolted from the drudgery of provincial medical practice.<br>
<br>In 1841 Tegetmeier returned to London, where he attended John Hoppus's lectures on mental philosophy at University College and practised as a mesmeric healer. He also briefly taught at a boys' school. In 1845 he became lecturer on domestic economy at the Home and Colonial Society's training college, and married Anne Edwards Stone (1826&#150;1909), mistress of the infant department of the practising school attached to the college. Both were instantly dismissed as a result, but Tegetmeier was subsequently reinstated and held his position until 1866. He began to write schoolbooks, notably a <span class="italic">Manual of Domestic Economy</span> (1858; 14th edn, 1894) which was widely used in industrial schools for girls. The Tegetmeiers lived in north London and had four daughters (two predeceasing their parents) and one son.<br>
<br>From an early age Tegetmeier was an enthusiastic breeder of poultry and pigeons, both fancy and racing, and he became the leading authority on these birds and many other aspects of natural history. In 1853 some of his earliest writing on these subjects appeared in the <span class="italic">Cottage Gardener</span> and as a short book, <span class="italic">Profitable Poultry</span>. Tegetmeier's best-known works, the <span class="italic">Poultry Book</span> (1867; enlarged, 1873) and <span class="italic">Pigeons</span> (1868; enlarged, 1873), included coloured plates by his friend Harrison Weir. He also published standard works on pheasants and game birds. In 1855 Tegetmeier came to the attention of Charles Darwin, who was studying pigeons and other domestic birds as part of the research which led to the <span class="italic">Origin of Species</span> (1859) and <span class="italic">Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication</span> (1868). Tegetmeier introduced Darwin to the institutions of the fancy, took him to shows, and answered numerous queries in correspondence.<br>
<br>Tegetmeier was also a keen apiarist. After he moved from Wood Green to Muswell Hill in 1856, he built observation hives in the garden and experimented on interbreeding and hive formation. His most significant finding, announced at the 1858 meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, involved the much debated question of how bees built their cells in the form of perfect hexagons. Tegetmeier showed that bees actually constructed cylindrical cells; only when raised up in contact with one another did these cells gain their characteristic mathematical regularity. Darwin extended these experiments and cited them in the <span class="italic">Origin</span>, recognizing that Tegetmeier had given a physical, material explanation to a phenomenon which many naturalists had seen as evidencing divine design. For his part, Tegetmeier became a convinced evolutionist, and always prided himself on his connection with the celebrated naturalist.<br>
<br>With the success of his books, Tegetmeier increasingly turned to journalism as his chief source of income. In 1859 he began to write on natural history for the weekly <span class="italic">Field</span>, and within a few years became its chief correspondent on poultry and pigeons. Over a period of nearly fifty years Tegetmeier wrote thousands of articles, notes, and reviews on a wide variety of subjects. From 1882 he became principal leader writer and a frequent reviewer for <span class="italic">The Queen</span>, the leading women's weekly newspaper. Here Tegetmeier received extensive assistance from his wife and drew on his own knowledge of domestic economy. He was a firm tory, profoundly opposed to the campaign for women's rights and all extensions of the suffrage from 1832 onwards. He believed in a deity, but was not a Christian.<br>
<br>&#145;Old Teg&#146;, with his bushy beard, broad-brimmed hat, and immoderate enthusiasm for pigeons, poultry, cock-fighting, book-collecting, bee-keeping, and scientific zoology, became celebrated as one of the notable eccentrics of metropolitan journalism. In 1857 he was a founder of the Savage Club, whose members included George Augustus Sala, G. A. Henty, and Gustave Dor&eacute;. Through burlesque and satire, the Savages celebrated the bohemian literary culture which flourished during the mid-Victorian expansion of periodical publishing.<br>
<br>Tegetmeier died in Hampstead on 19 November 1912, and was buried in Marylebone cemetery, Finchley, on 23 November. &#145;If he was not a great man&#146;, an obituarist wrote, &#145;he was, at any rate, a great character&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 21 Nov 1912).<br>
