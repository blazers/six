<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Killigrew,  Anne</span>  (1660&#150;1685), <span class="occ">poet and painter</span>, was born in St Martin's Lane, London, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15534/', "Dr Henry Killigrew (1613&#150;1700)")</script>, chaplain and almoner to the duke of York, master of the Savoy, and prebendary of Westminster, and his wife, Judith (<i>d</i>. 1683). Her uncles Thomas Killigrew (1612&#150;1683) and Sir William Killigrew (1606&#150;1695) were prominent figures in the Restoration theatre. Her brothers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15535/', "Admiral Henry Killigrew (d. 1712)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15536/', "Captain James Killigrew (c.1664&#150;1695)")</script> were both naval officers. Her sister Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1701) was married to Dr John Lambe, a clergyman. Anne was born shortly before the Restoration &#145;and christened in a private chamber, when the offices in the common-prayer were not publicly allowed&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.623). She was &#145;tenderly educated&#146; and soon &#145;became most admirable in the arts of poetry and painting&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>In 1683 Anne is listed as one of the six maids of honour to Mary of Modena. She never married. Her beauty, piety, and exemplary virtue are stressed in all the early records. In 1685 she succumbed to smallpox &#145;to the unspeakable reluctancy of her relations, and all others who were acquainted with her great virtues&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.623). The date of her death (which occurred in her father's lodgings in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey) is given as 16 June in Henry Killigrew's epitaph, but according to the Savoy chapel register she was buried there on 15 June. Her monument was destroyed by fire in 1864.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Poems by Mrs Anne Killigrew</span>, a collection of twenty-nine items, with three further poems &#145;found among Mrs Killigrews Papers &hellip; though none of hers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 84), was licensed on 30 September 1685 (title-page dated 1686). The volume encompasses a variety of genres and metres: pastoral, epigram, an unfinished epic, occasional verse, and poetry of general (and often austerely moral) reflection on the joys and pains of human life. The collection is prefaced by three commendatory poems, most notably John Dryden's celebrated pindaric ode &#145;To the Pious Memory of the Accomplisht Young Lady, Mrs Anne Killigrew, Excellent in the Two Sister-arts of Poesie and Painting&#146;, which affirms Anne Killigrew's saintly character and displays substantial first-hand knowledge of her achievements in both poetry and painting.<br>
<br>Only a handful of Anne Killigrew's paintings (which included portraits, biblical and historical paintings, mythological scenes, and landscapes) appears to have survived. A full-length self-portrait, in an allegorical setting, is housed at Berkeley Castle, Gloucestershire. A smaller self-portrait survives in several engraved copies, one forming the frontispiece to her <span class="italic">Poems</span>. A portrait of James II (formerly attributed to Lely) is in the Royal Collection at Windsor. In 1915&#150;16 a <span class="italic">Venus Attired by the Graces</span> was reproduced in the <span class="italic">Burlington Magazine</span> from an original then in private hands. Titles of further paintings are known from Anne Killigrew's poems and from the notebooks of George Vertue. The archives of the National Portrait Gallery contain a photograph of what is possibly the painting of Mary of Modena referred to in lines 134&#150;41 of Dryden's &#145;To the Pious Memory of &hellip; Anne Killigrew&#146;.<br>
