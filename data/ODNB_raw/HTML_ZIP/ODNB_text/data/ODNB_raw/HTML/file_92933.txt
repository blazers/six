<span class="headword">Henrion,  Daphne Hardy</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Daphne Hardy]</span>  (1917&#150;2003), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 20 October 1917 at Lavender Cottage, Amersham, Buckinghamshire, the second of three daughters of Clive Hardy, a former commercial clerk then serving as a major in the 12th London regiment, and his wife, Julia Dorothea (Judy), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bury. In 1923 the family moved to The Hague when her father became a translator at the International Court of Justice, a cause to which Daphne remained dedicated.<br>
<br>Daphne Hardy's training followed academic tradition. From 1934 to 1937 she attended the Royal Academy Schools in London, where sculptors still learned to model in terracotta and cast in plaster and bronze. These Renaissance techniques she had been using since 1931 when she had studied privately in The Hague with the sculptors Albert Termote and Marian Gobius. Her friends at the Royal Academy included William Scott, the painter, and Ivor Roberts-Jones, the sculptor. In 1937 she won the gold medal and travelling scholarship, and went to France and Italy for two years to study sculpture. Through mutual friends in Paris she met the Hungarian writer Arthur Koestler, with whom, at the outbreak of the Second World War, she was sharing a house in Provence. Their life together was portrayed in his autobiographical novel <span class="italic">Scum of the Earth</span> (1941). While they were together Koestler was working on <span class="italic">Darkness at Noon</span>, his masterpiece, which she translated from German for publication in London in 1940. In 1984 she exhibited a bust of Koestler at the Royal Academy (cast, NPG, 5741), which Lawrence Gowing praised at the time as &#145;one of the most acute and moving portrait sculptures in years, remembering a great man lately dead, of whom we could hardly have hoped for such a splendid memorial&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1946 Daphne Hardy showed at the Beaux Arts Gallery, run by Helen Lessore, the most important London dealer to champion figurative art in the 1950s and 1960s. On 3 April 1947 she married the industrial designer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66039/', "(Frederick) Henri Kay Henrion (1914&#150;1990)")</script>, the son of Max Kohn, lawyer. She retained her maiden name as a middle name. After the birth of her children, Max (<i>b</i>. 1950), Paul (<i>b</i>. 1951), and Emma (<i>b</i>. 1956), solo exhibitions followed at the Artists' International Association Gallery (1956), then at the Old Fire Engine House, Ely (1976), Clare Hall, Cambridge (1987), and Churchill College, Cambridge (1993). Her contributions to group shows indicate her aims and character: she was included in the Unknown Political Prisoner exhibition (New Burlington Galleries), and the Arts Council's touring show Sculpture in the Home, both in 1953. In works for public exhibition, she tackled universal themes with power. During the Second World War she had worked for the Ministry of Information as archivist of war photographs, an experience on which she drew, for example in her dramatic bronze memorial to suffering victims of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp of 1946, and the striking bronze in memory of an Italian Jew, Enzo Sereni, killed at Dachau after parachuting back into his home village in 1944.<br>
<br>In the 1970s Daphne Hardy Henrion and her husband separated (they divorced in 1980), and she went to live at Pope Mill Farm, Haverhill, Suffolk. In 1981 she moved to Cambridge where she became an important figure in the Cambridge Society of Painters and Sculptors. Starting in the 1950s at the Arts Council Gallery, and later at Kettle's Yard and the Fitzwilliam Museum, the society had mounted impressive annual shows of work by a distinguished group including, besides Daphne Hardy Henrion, Cecil Collins, Elisabeth Vellacott, and Nan Youngman. Daphne Hardy Henrion occasionally showed her quiet drawings&#151;always portraits, and often of friends. These had a wonderful simplicity, the heads gently and accurately placed in black chalk on white paper.<br>
<br>Daphne Hardy Henrion was one of a generation of artists whose careers were constrained by the demand for abstraction prevalent in the mid-twentieth century. Her natural vision, based on portraiture, linked her with ancient Roman sculpture as well as the Italian quattrocento terracotta busts which she copied as a girl. Her compositions, with two or three figures in human situations, grew from this sculptural tradition. There are none the less influences from twentieth-century art, especially the elongated figures of Lehmbruck or Giacometti. A recurring image in the 1980s was that of a walking couple, hand in hand, and with the suggestion of a pair walking away from paradise.<br>
<br>Daphne Hardy Henrion worked on a monumental scale, but it was in her sensitive portraits that she achieved most, especially her terracotta busts of children. Among the famous people she portrayed were Arthur Koestler, her husband F. H. K. Henrion, and the poet Laurie Lee. In these commissioned works, sometimes cast in bronze but often modelled in terracotta, the artist showed a sympathy and understanding usually hidden beneath a stern mask. She could be flinty and laconic in conversation, and yet her work showed the immediate gift of finding the mind's construction in the face. She had an undemonstrative physical presence but was in both senses a sharp individual: an appreciator of people but unable to stomach even a hint of pretension and inclined to Anglo-Saxon outbursts as a means of returning the conversation to a direct level of human communication. She died at her home, 13 Owlstone Road, Cambridge, on 31 October 2003, of heart failure. She was survived by her three children.<br>
