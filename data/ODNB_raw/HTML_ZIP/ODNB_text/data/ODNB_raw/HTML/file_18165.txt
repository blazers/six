<span class="headword">Marston,  John Westland</span>  (1819&#150;1890), <span class="occ">poet and playwright</span>, was born on 30 January 1819 at Boston, Lincolnshire, the son of Stephen Marston, an Anglican priest who converted to the Baptist church, and ministered to congregations in Boston, and later at Grimsby. After schooling at Grimsby, Marston proceeded to London in 1834, and was articled to his uncle, a solicitor with offices near Gray's Inn. While Stephen Marston had a &#145;horror of playhouses&#146; and saw actors as &#145;legitimate children of Satan&#146;  (Moulton, &#145;Five friends&#146;, 96), his son was fascinated as early as the age of twelve by plays and the theatre, and once in London soon found his way to Sadler's Wells. With nights spent at the theatre and days spent in the company of mystic writers such as James Pierrepont Greaves and John A. Heraud, to whose periodical <span class="italic">The Sunbeam</span> he contributed, Marston's law studies suffered, although he may have persevered and been called to the bar around 1838  (Wood, 8). In that year he was appointed secretary of Greaves's Pestalozzian Association, and published a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Poetry as an Universal Nature</span>; in 1839 another lecture, <span class="italic">Poetic Culture</span>, appeared, and he helped edit a new periodical, <span class="italic">The Psyche</span>.<br>
<br>Inevitably, it was among the followers of the mystic Greaves, centred in Cheltenham, that Marston met his future wife, Eleanor Jane Potts (1807/8&#150;1870), eldest daughter of James David Potts, the proprietor of <span class="italic">Saunders's News-Letter</span>; they were married on 18 May 1840, though Marston's feeble prospects were panned by the Potts family, who opposed the match. She was a woman &#145;of much cultivation,&#151;a good critic, a fine linguist, a loving reader&#146;  (Moulton, &#145;P. B. Marston&#146;, 11) and the marriage was a happy one. Marston transformed his own courtship into <span class="italic">The Patrician's Daughter</span>, a play published in pamphlet form in 1841, and sent in October to William Charles Macready. By the spring the Marstons, settled in London, were acquainted with the Macready circle, and had met Thomas Carlyle, John Forster, Charles Dickens, and Robert Browning at the actor's dinners. On 29 March 1841 Marston was baptized in the Church of England at St Clement Danes, Westminster. His next volume, <span class="italic">Gerald, a Dramatic Poem, and Other Poems</span> (1842) betrays the influence of another new friend, Philip James Bailey, the author of <span class="italic">Festus</span> (1839). Thus when <span class="italic">The Patrician's Daughter</span> appeared at Drury Lane in December of 1842, with Helen Faucit in the title role and with a prologue by Dickens spoken by Macready, the twenty-three-year-old Marston's rise to literary eminence would seem to have been certain. Marston's blank verse play with a contemporary and domestic setting quite naturally put him in the company of his friend Browning, also enamoured of the poetic drama; R. H. Horne's and Elizabeth Barrett's <span class="italic">A New Spirit of the Age</span> (1844) grouped the two young writers together, and Barrett's <span class="italic">Lady Geraldine's Courtship</span> betrays the influence of Marston's play. Controversy erupted over the behaviour of the central character of Mordaunt, but <span class="italic">The Patrician's Daughter</span> was an undoubted success, and might have been a larger one had Marston taken Macready's advice and made the ending a happy one.<br>
<br>In 1846 Marston became a contributor to <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>; he continued for about twenty-five years, and reviewed many important figures, including Tennyson, Thackeray, Browning, and Dickens. His first child, Cicely, was born in 1846, and a second daughter, Eleanor, in 1848. Marston's second play, the prose comedy <span class="italic">Borough Politics</span>, opened at the Haymarket on 27 June 1846 (claims that it was first published as a pamphlet in 1838 remain unsubstantiated); the manager, Benjamin Harrison, would go on to present two other plays by Marston, <span class="italic">The Heart and the World</span> (1847) and <span class="italic">Strathmore</span> (1849). The first, a comedic flop, was withdrawn after a week; however, <span class="italic">Strathmore</span>, a historical drama about the covenanters with Charles and Ellen Kean in the leading roles, enjoyed a great success. The plot is a more even-handed reworking of Scott's <span class="italic">Old Mortality</span>, with the complication of misallied love versus duty. Marston thought it his best play, and in the quality of its blank verse as well as its fairly well constructed plot, it is certainly above the average for its time.<br>
<br>In the 1850s Marston was a central fixture of literary London, and in one of the theatre's least memorable epochs the chief author of serious dramatic literature that actually reached the stage. He was an early and enduring friend of Dante Gabriel Rossetti (he was visiting Rossetti when the painter had his final stroke in 1882) and acted in his friend Dickens's amateur theatricals. When his only son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18166/', "Philip Bourke Marston (1850&#150;1887)")</script>, was born, his godparents were the poets Philip Bailey and Dinah Mulock (later Craik, better known as a novelist). A steady stream of plays appeared on the London stage: <span class="italic">Philip of France</span> and <span class="italic">Marie de M&eacute;ranie</span> in 1850, then another domestic drama <span class="italic">Anne Blake</span> (1852, again starring the Keans), and <span class="italic">A Life's Ransom</span> (1857), which puts domestic blank verse into the era of the revolution of 1688. The prose <span class="italic">A Hard Struggle</span> was praised by Dickens and proved to be a success at the box office. But Marston, still only in his thirties, was spreading his efforts and energies in many directions; in addition to book reviewing, he helped found and was the initial co-editor (with John Saunders) of the <span class="italic">National Magazine</span> in 1856, which published spasmodic and pre-Raphaelite writers and artists, and he also began writing fiction, although he possessed no gift in that genre. He even found the time to pen the second-best newspaper poem on the charge of the light brigade.<br>
<br>In the 1860s Marston moved with his family to a fine house in Northumberland Terrace, Regent's Park, and he and his wife began to hold Sunday evening open houses for literary London, as well as for those with interest in spiritualism. Marston had corresponded with Elizabeth Barrett Browning about spiritualism as early as 1853, and his entire family shared his strong interest in it. Visitors report him as a fluent conversationalist, tending towards the epigrammatic, and as an exceptionally good listener. In 1863 he was made an honorary doctor of laws by Glasgow University, and was henceforth usually addressed as Doctor Marston. One of his most durable plays, <span class="italic">Donna Diana</span>, was staged at the Princess's Theatre in 1864; a comedy, it was adapted from Moreto's <span class="italic">El Desden con el Desden</span>, and it was frequently performed in Britain and in the United States for the next thirty years, which was not the case for <span class="italic">Life for Life</span>, another neo-Elizabethan drama produced in 1869.<br>
<br>In 1870 Marston's wife died, and her death affected him deeply. He gave up the house in Regent's Park, and turned to a collaboration with the melodramatist W. G. Wills, <span class="italic">Broken Spells</span> (1872). The play is aptly titled, for the spell that allowed audiences to enjoy neo-Elizabethan verse dramas was also gone. Marston's two-volume <span class="italic">Dramatic and Poetical Works</span> (1876) is a self-conscious capstone to his career, and he seems to have taken delight chiefly in the successes of his son, who had overcome his blindness and become a poet. His daughter Cicely died, however, in 1878, followed in 1879 by Eleanor, who had married the poet Arthur O'Shaughnessy in 1873.<br>
<br>Marston's last play was acted at the Vaudeville Theatre on April fool's day 1885. It was titled <span class="italic">Under Fire</span>, and <span class="italic">The Graphic</span> laconically reported that &#145;tokens of disapprobation were unpleasantly numerous&#146;  (Wood, 50). A harder blow, however, came with the death of his son on 14 February 1887. Despite a modest civil-list pension, Marston's last years were spent in straitened circumstances; his lodgings were modest, his meals taken in cheaper foreign restaurants. His friends, led by Sir Henry Irving, attempted a rescue with a benefit performance of Byron's <span class="italic">Werner</span> at the Lyceum (1 June 1887), realizing &pound;928. Marston repaid the acting profession in the next year with the publication of the two-volume <span class="italic">Our Recent Actors</span>, which is now an indispensable primary source for Victorian theatre history. In his last year he suffered from ill health, and lost much of what had been a portly figure. He died in his lodgings at 191 Euston Road, London, on 5 January 1890, and was buried four days later in Highgate cemetery, Middlesex, alongside his wife and children. A few years later, Bernard Shaw, in a review of 7 November 1896 of what for him was an alarmingly powerful revival of <span class="italic">Donna Diana</span>, spoke of it as a &#145;pure-bred drama engendered solely by the passion of the stage-struck, uncrossed by nature, character, poetry, philosophy, social criticism, or any other alien stock&#146;; in the age of Ibsen, Marston's was indeed an &#145;obsolete play&#146;  (<span class="italic">Shaw's Dramatic Criticism</span>, 188). The artificial theatricality of Marston's best work, as well as its deployment of blank verse, has doomed him to a murky corner of theatre history, though any new accounts of serious mid-Victorian drama should begin with a rediscovery of his work.<br>
