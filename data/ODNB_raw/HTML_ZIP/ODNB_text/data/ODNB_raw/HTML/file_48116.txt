<span class="headword">Bamburgh,  Odard  of</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1115&#150;<em>c.</em>1133), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, has been identified as a son of Liulf of Bamburgh, sheriff of Northumberland between <i>c</i>.1103 and 1116  (Round, <span class="italic">Genealogist</span>, 5.25&#150;8), though the identification cannot be regarded as certain. An important royal servant in the north, Odard was sheriff of Northumberland by 2 February 1116, when he was one of the addressees in a writ of Henry I that ordered the restoration of lands belonging to Bishop Ranulf of Durham. Between 1115 and 1119 Henry's son, William, notified Odard that the king had granted him land for the service of three knights, and on 13 April 1121 Odard, described as sheriff of the Northumbrians, attended an assembly of northern magnates at Durham, at which they discussed Durham Priory's claim to Tynemouth. He was also one of the addressees in royal writs commanding that the monks of Tynemouth should have quiet possession of their lands (1120&#150;33), and that they and the abbot of St Albans should have right of warren in their Northumberland lands (<i>c</i>.1116&#150;<i>c</i>.1126). Between 1119 and 1124 he attested Earl David of Huntingdon's foundation charter for Selkirk Abbey. Between 1115 and 1127 Odard was notified by Henry I of his gift of property to Eustace fitz John, and between 1118 and 1128 himself attested a charter of Henry I in favour of William, son of Aluric of Corbridge. He was still sheriff of Northumberland in 1130, when he was pardoned 15<i>s</i>. for danegeld.<br>
<br>Odard was probably the father of William fitz Odard of Bamburgh, and of William's brothers, Adam, John, and Ernald; he may also have had a daughter named Gumilda. About 1133 Henry I granted to William fitz Odard of Bamburgh all the lands that his father had held in chief (lands named in a charter of King Stephen as situated in Bamburgh and Corbridge, &#145;Burnulfestona&#146; and &#145;Chinewallia&#146;), which suggests that Odard was dead by then. The shrievalty of Northumberland passed to Adam, and John acquired the lordship of Embleton in Northumberland and was the ancestor of the Viscount family.<br>
<br>Odard the sheriff of Northumberland may have been the same man as Odard the sheriff of Carlisle; under the Carlisle heading, the 1129/30 pipe roll records the debts of this Odard &#145;for the old farm of the pleas of Carlisle which belong to the shrievalty&#146;, for the same farm in the previous year (1128/9), and for the pleas of Walter Espec and Eustace fitz John. If the two Odards were one and the same, it would appear that Odard of Bamburgh held some authority over Carlisle or Cumberland generally. Another sheriff Odard, lord of Wigton in Cumberland, may or may not have been the same man as Odard the sheriff of Carlisle, and therefore may possibly be identifiable with Odard of Bamburgh. A much less likely identification is with yet another Odard, son of Hildred of Carlisle, the man who accounted for the farm of Carlisle in the 1129/30 pipe roll.<br>
