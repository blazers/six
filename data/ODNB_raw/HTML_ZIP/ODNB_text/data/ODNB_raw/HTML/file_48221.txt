<span class="headword">Hall,  George Henry</span>, Viscount Hall  (1881&#150;1965), <span class="occ">trade unionist and politician</span>, was born at Penrhiw-ceibr, Glamorgan, on 31 December 1881, the son of George and Ann Hall. At the age of twelve, after a basic education at Penrhiw-ceibr elementary school, Hall began work at Penrikyber colliery; he remained a collier until 1911, when he was elected to the position of checkweighman. This was a key post, entailing the recording of the daily output by the workmen, which determined their weekly wages. As with other leaders to emerge from the south Wales coalfield, Hall's position as checkweighman served as a springboard to a full-time trade union career within the South Wales Miners' Federation, in which he became miners' agent for his local area.<br>
<br>Hall's political career had already been launched in 1909 when he was elected as member for the Penrhiw-ceibr ward in local council elections. He remained a member of Mountain Ash town council and its education committee for eighteen years. He had a lasting interest in education, and in later life served as a governor of University College, Cardiff. In 1910 he married Margaret Jones, the marriage lasting until her death in 1941. They had two sons, Leonard and Bruce, the latter killed on active service in the Second World War.<br>
<br>In 1922 Hall defeated C. B. Stanton to win the Aberd&acirc;r division of the Merthyr Tudful constituency as a Labour candidate, with a majority of 5217. Hall retained this seat for twenty-four years, and had the distinction of being returned unopposed in 1931 and 1935 when his popularity was at its height as the result of his uncompromising stand against the means test. His work as a constituency MP was always as important to him as the more prominent government duties he later assumed. In particular, he was always keen to encourage new employment opportunities in the area to replace the declining coal industry. He was, for example, able to attract a new cable works to Aberd&acirc;r, of which he became a director.<br>
<br>In 1929 Hall began a long association with the Admiralty when Ramsay MacDonald appointed him to the post of civil lord of the Admiralty, which he held until the creation of the National Government in 1931. His next appointment, as a member of the wartime coalition government, was as parliamentary under-secretary of state for the Colonial Office from 1941 to 1942. He only agreed to take this post in return for a promise by Churchill to establish a Royal Ordnance factory at Hirwaun, near Aberd&acirc;r, to alleviate continuing unemployment. In 1943 Hall returned to the Admiralty as financial secretary, his major duty being to oversee production during the battle of the Atlantic. Later the same year he moved to the post of parliamentary under-secretary of state for foreign affairs, remaining in this office until the end of the war.<br>
<br>With the return of a Labour government in 1945, and Hall's successful retention of his seat with a majority of 27,969, he was given a position in Attlee's cabinet as secretary of state for the colonies. He had refused the first of two offers of a peerage to mark his wartime achievements, but Attlee prevailed on him in 1946 to accept the title of Viscount Hall, of Cynon Valley, and with it the post of first lord of the Admiralty. This was designed to boost Labour representation in the upper house, but the move caused bitterness among die-hard Labour Party activists in Aberd&acirc;r. Hall agonized long over the decision before resolving that, for someone who had always considered himself in the mainstream of the Labour Party, loyalty to that party must come above any recriminations over supposed compromise of socialist principles.<br>
<br>In 1947 Hall became deputy leader of the House of Lords, holding both this and his position at the Admiralty until he retired, in poor health, at the general election of 1951. During this period he supervised the transition of the navy to a peacetime footing, ensuring that the service began adapting itself to the new demands of the atomic age. In February 1964 Hall married Alice Martha Walker. He died at Leicester on 8 November 1965, survived by his second wife.<br>
