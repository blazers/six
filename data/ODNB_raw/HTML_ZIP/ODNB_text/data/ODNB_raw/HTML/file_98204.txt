<span class="headword">Cox,  Edgar William</span>  (1882&#150;1918), <span class="occ">army and intelligence officer</span>, was born at 191 Tufnell Park Road, Islington, London, on 9 May 1882, the son of George William Cox, banker's clerk, and his wife, Louisa Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bull. Educated at Christ's Hospital, where he was captain of the school, and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, where he passed out top of his class, he was commissioned into the Royal Engineers in December 1900.<br>
<br>For the first seven years of his service Cox was engaged in survey work in Africa, serving on the Anglo-Liberian (1902&#150;3) and Anglo-Portuguese (1904&#150;6) boundary commissions before undertaking further survey duties in east Africa (1906&#150;9). Promoted captain in 1910, he returned to England and regimental duties in Aldershot. On 6 March 1912 he married, at St Saviour's Cathedral, Maritzburg, South Africa, Nora Davis. A fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, he became a junior staff officer in the topographical section at the War Office in 1912 and was one of the British representatives at the International Map Conference in Paris in 1913. In that year he produced a revised edition of Charles Frederick Arden-Close's standard <span class="italic">Textbook of Topographical and Geographical Surveying</span>. Already qualified as a military interpreter in French and German, he was mobilized in August 1914 into the intelligence section of the general headquarters of the British expeditionary force.<br>
<br>By September 1914 Cox had transferred from the geographical sub-section (Ic) across to the operational intelligence sub-section (Ia). It was here that he established his reputation for painstaking hard work. His most significant contribution was the compilation, in the spring of 1915, of an updated and comprehensive order of battle of the German army. Known initially as the yellow book from the colour of its cover, it became subsequently the brown book and in its many editions served as the cornerstone handbook for all British intelligence officers on the western front. This work also provided the foundation of his subsequent reputation as the British army's leading expert on its enemy.<br>
<br>Cox's work led, in June 1915, to his appointment as DSO. It also brought him to the attention of Brigadier-General George Macdonogh, the brigadier-general (intelligence) at general headquarters. Cox had first come into contact with Macdonogh in 1901 during his training at the School of Military Engineering, Chatham. In June 1915 Macdonogh was noticeably depressed following the death of his young son. At this time Macdonogh and Cox worked closely, dined late together, and took long walks. This social interaction seems to have cemented their professional relationship, and when, in January 1916, the reshuffle of the high command led to Macdonogh's promotion and posting to London as director of military intelligence he took Cox with him.<br>
<br>At the War Office, Cox became head of MI2c, the sub-section then responsible for analysing Germany. By June 1916 he had been promoted major. His work continued to impress Macdonogh and this resulted, in January 1917, in his promotion to lieutenant-colonel and command of MI3, a reorganized section with responsibility for intelligence analysis of all the central powers. During 1917 relations between the intelligence staff in London and their counterparts in France became strained as Macdonogh and Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig's intelligence chief, Brigadier-General John Charteris, disputed the impact that the attritional strategy was having on the German army. When Charteris was forced out after the battle of Cambrai it was Cox who, after a short interlude, replaced him as brigadier-general, intelligence. This promotion apparently made Cox, at thirty-five, the youngest brigadier in the British army. Although he seems to have been popular and effective, Cox was hindered by the fact that he had never served in a front-line role. Because of this he appointed Colonel Stephen Butler (1880&#150;1964), an experienced intelligence staff officer, as his deputy.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1918 Cox faced a considerable intelligence challenge. With the British expeditionary force standing on the defensive for the first time in three years he had to predict the location, strength, and direction of the forthcoming German offensives. Although his assessments were not always perfect he did manage to provide Haig with a generally accurate picture of the German operational reserves that allowed his commander to resist French calls for redeployment of his forces. Yet he does not appear to have had a very good relationship with Haig. At critical moments, during the Lys offensive of April 1918 for example, Cox adopted a pessimistic attitude at odds with his commander's inherent optimism. When the German offensives petered out in July this dichotomy became more noticeable and Cox believed, incorrectly, that Haig was turning to his predecessor Charteris for advice. Although Charteris had been meeting Haig, there is no evidence that they had been discussing intelligence matters.<br>
<br>By the summer of 1918, despite his near-legendary constitution and capacity for long hours, Cox seems to have been burnt out and was perhaps depressed. He was struck down by influenza for most of June and then again in early August. On the afternoon of 26 August 1918 he told his deputy that he was going for swim to reinvigorate himself. He was driven to the channel coast at Berck Plage near general headquarters at &Eacute;taples and allowed his driver to take a walk. When the driver returned Cox was missing. His body was found the next day. Although suicide brought on by the pressure of work and the apparent sidelining by his commander cannot be ruled out, the contemporary evidence of his poor health makes accidental death by drowning more likely. He was buried in France at &Eacute;taples military cemetery. His widow and two sons survived him. &#145;Strong, straight, clean, keen, selfless, humble-minded, loyal, true&#146;, his former headmaster wrote, &#145;he leaves a bright example of a character always prized as a moral asset in English life&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 14 Sept 1918). In 1934 a scholarship fund at Christ's Hospital was established in his memory, and a plaque unveiled at the school.<br>
