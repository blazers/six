<span class="headword">Sherwen,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1748, <em>d.</em> 1826), <span class="occ">surgeon and apothecary</span>, son of John Sherwen, was baptized at St Michael's, Workington, Cumberland, on 23 April 1748. He was apprenticed to Anthony Harrison, surgeon and apothecary of Penrith, for five years, and then admitted a pupil at St Thomas's Hospital, London, on 4 February 1769. The court of examiners of the London Company of Surgeons passed him as a surgeon to an Indiaman on 1 June, four months later, and by the end of the year Sherwen was at Acheen, Sumatra, the voyage from Falmouth having taken five months; he was afterwards at Calcutta and in the Bay of Bengal.<br>
<br>By 1774 Sherwen had returned to England and was practising with Thomas Prichard, at Enfield, Middlesex; ten years later he took over Prichard's practice. He was also friendly there with Richard Gough, and Isaac D'Israeli, the three forming a literary trio. Sherwen founded the short-lived <span class="italic">Medical Spectator</span> and contributed to medical journals, and a silver medal for his contributions was given him by the Medical Society of London in March 1788.<br>
<br>Sherwen was admitted MD of King's College, Aberdeen, on 14 February 1798, on the recommendation of William Saunders; and on 4 May 1802 he became an extra-licentiate of the College of Physicians in London. In 1802 he paid a visit to Paris. His first wife was Douglass, posthumous daughter of Duncan Campbell of Salt Spring, Jamaica. She visited Bath for her health, and died there on 16 June 1804. A monument to her memory was erected in Bath Abbey. In 1805 Sherwen settled into practice at Bath, living at 18 Great Stanhope Street. He married again at Birkenhead, his second wife being Lydia Ann (1773&#150;1851), the daughter of the late Revd Dannett of Liverpool, on 12 November 1807. There were no children by either of Sherwen's marriages.<br>
<br>Sherwen made a patient study of early English writers, and he owned some rare volumes of Elizabethan literature and early herbals. From 1808 to 1813 he was a frequent contributor to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, mainly on the authenticity of the &#145;Rowley&#146; poems, which he believed to be genuine. He assisted John Britton in his work on Bath Abbey, and Britton dedicated to him the view of the abbey church from the south side. In 1809 Sherwen published his <span class="italic">Introduction to an examination of some part of the internal evidence respecting the antiquity and authenticity of certain publications</span> by Rowley or Chatterton. Sherwen was also a versifier of some merit, writing satirically of pompous squires, members of the local vestry, and Calvinist ministers  (Gough MSS). He trained a number of apprentices, including William Gaitskel, who later became important in medical politics.<br>
<br>Sherwen made frequent trips to Enfield and died there in his house in Baker Street on 3 October 1826. He was buried on 12 October at St Andrew's Church, Enfield. After taking care of his wife's needs, his estate, including an annuity and the house at Bath, passed in succession to his dead sister's children, and then to establish a dispensary in Workington or Lamplugh.<br>
