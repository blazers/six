<span class="headword">Evans,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1718), <span class="occ">Independent minister and tutor</span>, is of unknown parentage, and the year and place of his birth are likewise unknown. He was educated at Rhys Prydderch's school at Ystradwallter, and was later taught by Stephen Hughes. He was ordained at Pencader, Carmarthenshire, in 1688, where he then ministered and taught a school. With very slender means of subsistence, he had to rely largely on his wife's small private income. In 1703 he moved to Carmarthen to take charge of the Independent causes in the area, and to keep a school (assisted by the SPCK) for poor children. From 1704 he received in his house students for the dissenting ministry, thus establishing an academy which succeeded those at Brynllywarch and Abergavenny. He was patronized by the Presbyterian and Congregational funds in London and by wealthy dissenters.<br>
<br>Evans educated a number of prominent ministers at his academy, including some who became noted authors, such as Matthias Maurice and Christmas Samuel. A man of immense energy, he maintained a close connection with his former charge at Pencader, and he achieved a coup by securing for dissenting worship the erstwhile Anglican chapel at Llan-y-bri, near Carmarthen. In 1707 he published in Welsh <span class="italic">The Principles of the Christian Religion</span>, a translation of the shorter catechism of the Westminster assembly, and in 1714 published <span class="italic">Gemau doethineb</span> (&#145;Gems of Wisdom&#146;), by his old mentor Rhys Prydderch. Evans's wife was named Katherine, but no other details of the marriage are known; two sons and a daughter are mentioned in his will of 1716. Following Stephen Hughes's death, Evans came to be regarded as the new leader of dissent in Carmarthenshire. A man of superior attainments as scholar, preacher, and educator, he devoted himself with great diligence to his work. Jeremy Owen called him &#145;God's gift to his people &hellip; a public blessing&#146;  (Jenkins, 207). He died in January 1718 in Carmarthen Town, survived by his wife.<br>
