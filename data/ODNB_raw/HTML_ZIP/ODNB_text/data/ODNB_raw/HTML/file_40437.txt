<span class="headword">Bromley,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1630, <em>d.</em> 1691), <span class="occ">mystical writer</span>, was baptized on 1 February 1630 in the parish of St Michael Bedwardine, Worcester, a younger son of Henry Bromley (<i>d</i>. 1647) of Upton upon Severn, Worcestershire, a descendant of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3513/', "Sir Thomas Bromley")</script>, Elizabethan lord chancellor, and Mary (<i>d</i>. 1658), daughter of Sir William Ligon of Madresfield. According to his biographer, &#145;in his younger years&#146; he was &#145;religiously educated&#146;  (Bromley, 3). Admitted as a commoner of Oriel College, Oxford, in June 1650, he matriculated on 22 November. How long he remained there is unknown, though battels receipts indicate that about April 1652 he migrated to All Souls College. According to Richard Roach's account, while at Oxford Bromley and a companion heard a sermon at the university church &#145;preached in great Power&#146; by John Pordage (1607&#150;1681), rector of Bradfield, Berkshire  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. D. 833, fol. 63<i>v</i>). Together with his companion, Edmund Brice, fellow of All Souls, Bromley spoke with Pordage and was deeply satisfied with what he heard. About April 1654 he left Oxford &#145;when he was to have beene elected fellow of All Soules &hellip; according to the statutes of the house as kinsman to the founder&#146;. At the election day he went to join Pordage's community at Bradfield, &#145;and never returned to Oxford againe&#146;  (Nicolson, 279).<br>
<br>About three weeks before his departure Bromley preached a sermon on <span class="roman">Acts</span> 14: 22, &#145;That we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God&#146;; some years later his elder brother Henry Bromley (1626&#150;1667) believed that Thomas had expected &#145;to draw wisdome out of a clearer fountaine, and to be call'd by God to preach the Gospell&#146;  (Nicolson, 279). Bromley's mother, Mary, &#145;a sober, pious Woman&#146;, did not prove so understanding, and prevailed upon her son to pass on his writings to Richard Baxter, who deemed &#145;that their Guide differed much from the Scripture&#146;. Baxter found Bromley to be of &#145;a very good Disposition, aspiring after the highest Spiritual State, and thinking that visible Communion with Angels was it, he much expected it, and profest in some measure to have attained it&#146;. None the less, Baxter perceived that Bromley was &#145;a young, raw Scholar of some Fryar whom he understood not&#146;, and in a letter intended for Bromley dated 30 May 1654 he attempted to confute some of Bromley's opinions, attacking &#145;Diabolicall Delusory Apparitions&#146; and a dependence on spirits and voices. Some years later Baxter was again to write against Pordage &#145;and his Family, who live together in Community, and pretend to hold visible and sensible Communion with Angels, whom they sometime see, and sometime smell&#146; (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.78; Baxter, <span class="italic">Worlds of Spirits</span>, 176; DWL, MS Baxter Treatises, III 67, fol. 302<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>On 5 October 1654 John Pordage was brought before the commissioners for ejecting of scandalous ministers for the county of Berkshire, nominally to be tried on charges of blasphemy, although others, it seems, cast covetous glances at the lucrative living of Bradfield. During these proceedings it appears that Bromley conceded to having seen a vision of a woman's guardian angel &#145;in her morning coat&#146;. Pordage was found guilty &#145;of denying the Deity of Christ&#146; and ejected from his living on 8 December 1654, though he continued to live at Bradfield (Fowler, 102, 116; J. Pordage, <span class="italic">Innocencie Appearing through the Dark Mists of Pretended Guilt</span>, 1655, 1, 3). It seems that Bromley, &#145;his chief Proselyte&#146; and companion, remained with him  (Baxter, <span class="italic">Worlds of Spirits</span>, 176). In 1655 Thomas Bromley published <span class="italic">The Way to the Sabbath of Rest</span>, a mystical treatise heavily influenced by the writings of Jakob Boehme, which Richard Baxter judged to be a &#145;most clean and moderate piece&#146; of doctrine  (Baxter, <span class="italic">Key for Catholicks</span>, 331). This work was to be translated into Dutch, German, and Swedish.<br>
<br>Bromley appears to have spent many years at Bradfield in the company of Pordage and his &#145;family&#146;. In the fire of London he lost &#145;about [&pound;30] worth of books, most Greeke and Hebrew&#146;, and an edition of the polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span>  (Nicolson, 279). In the episcopal returns of 1669 he was suspected, along with Pordage, of holding a conventicle at Bradfield. Bromley was also a correspondent of Viscount Conway, and for several years, despite illness and infirmity, he solicited money from Conway which he distributed charitably among the poor of London and the surrounding countryside. By November 1670 Bromley had returned to Upton upon Severn. From Upton he corresponded with Anne, Viscountess Conway, visiting her on occasion at her country seat at Ragley, Warwickshire. It was at Ragley that Bromley made the acquaintance of the Cambridge Platonist, Henry More, and of Franciscus Mercurius van Helmont. Bromley was also written to in 1680 by Richard Baxter, who outlined for him his judgement on the nature of free will. All the while, it seems that Thomas Bromley maintained contact with John Pordage and his community; he was bequeathed money for a mourning ring by Pordage in his will, and commended a Behmenistic work called <span class="italic">A Fountain of Gardens</span> by Jane Lead, who was to found the Philadelphian Society.<br>
<br>Bromley's last years appear to have been spent at Upton. He died on Easter Monday, 13 April 1691, and was buried at Upton on 15 April. His estate was administered by his niece, Elizabeth. Some months after his death his library, containing works on the apocalypse, Socinianism, atheism, heresy, and Jakob Boehme, was auctioned. Bromley also left several works in manuscript, some of which were published in the eighteenth century.<br>
