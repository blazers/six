<span class="headword">Purse,  Benjamin Ormond</span>  (1874&#150;1950), <span class="occ">social worker and expert on blind welfare</span>, was born on 29 August 1874 at Salford, Lancashire, the son of Edward Purse, general labourer, and his wife, Matilda, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clavering. His sight became defective in early life, but it was not until he was thirteen, when it had become extremely poor, that he was sent to school at Henshaw's Institution for the Blind, Manchester.<br>
<br>Purse was trained as a piano-tuner, took the certificate, and struggled for more than two years to build up a tuning practice. However, his inclinations were towards a career of professional or public service, and to prepare himself he devoured every book he could lay hands on. His first step in this direction was taken when he became the first paid secretary (at 8<i>s</i>. a week) of the National League of the Blind, a small body which voiced the unsatisfactory conditions prevalent among blind people. He used a legacy of &pound;60 left to him in 1898 to launch a journal, the <span class="italic">Blind Advocate</span>, as the organ of the league, and in 1901 he devoted himself full-time to the organization at a weekly salary of &pound;1 3<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>. In 1902 the league was affiliated to the Trades Union Congress.<br>
<br>The next few years were crowded with activity for Purse&#151;writing, lecturing, expending all his efforts for blind people. In 1905 he was a delegate at an international conference of blind welfare workers; between 1904 and 1910 he visited forty-eight municipal authorities and secured travel concessions from thirty-seven of them; in 1907 he was the only witness to give evidence concerning the blind before the royal commission on the poor laws, and he took an active part in the movement which led in 1914 to the compulsory notification of ophthalmia neonatorum, a foremost measure in sight-saving. He was responsible for preparing the preliminary matter, and subsequently helped to frame the recommendations which resulted in the setting up in 1917 of the government's advisory committee for the welfare of the blind, of which he was a member until 1942.<br>
<br>In 1916 Purse was persuaded by Sir Arthur Pearson to join the staff of the National Institute for the Blind, as director of the aftercare department, which helped to train, and to find employment for, blind persons. Although by so doing he signified his approval of voluntary organizations, he by no means relinquished his efforts to secure a degree of state aid for blind people, and no blind person contributed more than he to the movement which led to the passing of the <span class="roman">Blind Persons' Act</span> in 1920.<br>
<br>From 1920 until 1943 Purse superintended the administration of relief, training, and general employment at the National Institute for the Blind. In 1921 he played a prominent part in forming what later became the National Association of Blind Workers, and he edited its official journal, the <span class="italic">Tribune</span>, until 1942. In that year he was elected a vice-president of his old school, Henshaw's Institution, an honour no blind person had ever received before; and in 1944 his work for blind people was recognized by his appointment as OBE.<br>
<br>Ben Purse's massive intelligence, amazing statistical memory, power of debate, and grim courage left their mark for all time on the British blind community. He published a number of works, which mainly concerned his campaign to improve the position of blind people in work. His publications include <span class="italic">The Blind in Industry</span> (1925), <span class="italic">The British Blind</span> (1928), and a book of verse, <span class="italic">Moods and Melodies</span> (1931).<br>
<br>Purse had married in 1899 Mary Elizabeth, daughter of John Alcock, a collier, of Oldham. She and their two children had predeceased him. Purse himself died at Wembdon, Bridgwater, on 31 March 1950.<br>
