<span class="headword">Dwelly,  Edward</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Ewen MacDonald]</span>  (1864&#150;1939), <span class="occ">lexicographer</span>, was born on 2 February 1864 at 4 Crown Crescent, Twickenham, Middlesex, the son of Thomas Edward Dwelly and his wife, Clara Isabella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hill. His father worked in Cox's Bank, Charing Cross, London, and Edward began his working career there. But his ambitions did not allow him to stay for long in banking. He was strongly attracted to playing the bagpipes and to learning Scottish Gaelic, and he served in the London Scottish Volunteers, and later in similar units connected with the Argyll and Sutherland and the Seaforth regiments, playing in their pipe bands; by the 1890s he was using the name Ewen MacDonald as one more appropriate for a highland piper.<br>
<br>Dwelly left London in 1891 and took up work with the Ordnance Survey in Scotland. In 1896 he married Mary MacDougall at Doune, Perthshire. She was a native Gaelic speaker. It was about this time that he began to collect Gaelic vocabulary in a systematic way, corresponding with Gaels in many highland areas and recording local usages in a detailed way, as well as information about implements and practices that were already near the end of their lifespan, including a multiplicity of names for an early-morning dram of whisky. He also made extensive use of previously published Gaelic dictionaries.<br>
<br>Later in the 1890s Dwelly returned to England, and settled in the village of Skeete, near Lyminge, in Kent. Here he set up his own hand printing press, did his own compositing, and began to publish small Gaelic almanacs, which appeared from 1901 to 1908. In 1902 he acquired a larger printing press and began to publish his Gaelic dictionary in parts, issued at four-monthly intervals and paid for by subscriptions of 6&frac12;<i>d</i>. per issue. This appeared in thirty-three parts between 1902 and 1911, under his pseudonym, Ewen MacDonald. In 1904 the family, now with three children, moved to Herne Bay. Bound volumes of the whole dictionary were also published there, using a Gaelic name, Camus-a'-Chorra, for Herne Bay, and emphasizing that the volumes were made with paper produced in Scotland. The dictionary is copiously illustrated, many of the illustrations made by Dwelly, with advice and help from his highland correspondents. No work of this sort can be perfect, and various inaccuracies and faults of emphasis have been identified over the years, but overall it was a remarkable achievement. A revised edition appeared in 1920, with a valuable listing of place names and personal names supplied by Professor W. J. Watson, and the dictionary remained in print throughout the century, published later by Alexander MacLaren &amp; Son in Glasgow, and after 1971 by Gairm Publications, Glasgow.<br>
<br>Dwelly continued to collect Gaelic words and usages after the publication of the dictionary, and these notes were deposited in the National Library of Scotland after his death. In 1991 they were edited and published under the title <span class="italic">Appendix to Dwelly's Gaelic&#150;English Dictionary</span>, edited by Douglas Clyne. The additions are much more numerous for initial letters A, B, and C, presumably because additions under later letters were being made before 1911.<br>
<br>Having published the dictionary Dwelly turned to investigating and publishing parish records, and about a dozen books appeared in the series <span class="roman">Dwelly's Parish Records</span>. Unpublished papers of this kind were deposited at Bristol University, and later passed to the Society of Genealogists. Dwelly seems to have led a life driven by obsession, but he was loyally supported by his wife and family. He was given a civil-list pension, which helped to keep them above the poverty line. He died at Greenside, Kenilworth Road, Fleet, Hampshire, on 25 January 1939, and was survived by his wife.<br>
