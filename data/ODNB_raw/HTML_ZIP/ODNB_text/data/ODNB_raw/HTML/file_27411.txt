<span class="headword">Thurstan</span>  (<em>c.</em>1070&#150;1140), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, was the son of a married priest from the Bessin named Anskar (Anger), and his wife, Popelina, and was born in the Bessin area of Normandy.<h2>
<a name="Youthandcareerto1114"></a>Youth and career to 1114</h2>Thurstan may have received his education at Caen, or in the Bayeux of Bishop Odo, from where a number of aspiring clerics crossed the channel. His own family moved to England during the time of Bishop Maurice of London (1086&#150;1107) from whom Anskar obtained the prebend of Kentish Town in the cathedral church of St Paul, while his sons came to hold prebends in the same church: Audoin (later bishop of &Eacute;vreux) succeeded to his father's prebend of Kentish Town when he died some time after 1104, and Thurstan acquired that of Consumpta-per-Mare. The brothers also held positions as chaplains of Henry I, Thurstan being first mentioned in this capacity in 1103. For his service to the king he held the churches and chapels of Tickhill Castle, Stoneleigh, Shorne, and Cobham. Apart from his occasional attestation of royal charters, and the possibility (suggested by John of Hexham) that he was associated with Archbishop Thomas (II) in the foundation of the Augustinian priory of Hexham in 1113, the only recorded event of Thurstan's life before 1114 was his visit (date unknown) to Cluny, where he made a vow that he would at some time in his life take the habit of a Cluniac monk. It was a pledge that he was to fulfil in his final days.<h2>
<a name="ArchbishopofYorkrelationswithCanterbury11141118"></a>Archbishop of York: relations with Canterbury, 1114&#150;1118</h2>Thurstan was still in subdeacon's orders when, at Winchester on 15 August 1114, six months after the death of Thomas (II) in February 1114, Henry I appointed him archbishop of York. This was done without reference to the chapter of the cathedral, but no opposition was forthcoming. Thurstan was ordained deacon by William Giffard, bishop of Winchester (<i>d</i>. 1129), some time between September and December 1114 and in December was enthroned archbishop at York by the bishop of Coventry. In the weeks that followed he began to learn something of his new diocese. According to Hugh the Chanter he visited Durham, where he met Turgot, bishop of St Andrews, during his final illness, although as Turgot died in August 1115 Hugh may have conflated the events of two summers. He also visited Hexham, and on his return to York conferred with the chapter about the matter of the profession of obedience to Canterbury. He declined an invitation from Ralph d'Escures, archbishop of Canterbury (<i>d</i>. 1122), to journey to Canterbury to be ordained priest and consecrated archbishop, and instead crossed to Normandy on Christmas day, intending to ask permission of the king to go to Rome to put his case before the pope. Thurstan had no intention of accepting ordination from the archbishop of Canterbury or any of his suffragans lest this should prejudice his case when the question of the primacy of Canterbury was raised, as he anticipated it would be. Therefore, with the king's permission, he accepted ordination as priest from his own suffragan, Ranulf Flambard, bishop of Durham (<i>d</i>. 1128), at Bayeux on 6 June 1115, although his request to go to Rome was denied. In September that year Thurstan was present at the king's council in Westminster, and complained to the king of the delay in receiving consecration. Henry ordered Archbishop Ralph to consecrate Thurstan, and in the presence of witnesses who included the archbishop of Rouen and the bishops of Lisieux and Durham, Thurstan made his request. Ralph agreed to consecrate him, provided that he make profession of obedience. This Thurstan refused to do.<br>
<br>The opposition of Thurstan to the claims of Canterbury to primacy over York dominates Hugh the Chanter's highly favourable account of Thurstan, as indeed it dominated the first five years of Thurstan's pontificate. Thurstan had made his opinion quite clear to the king: it was unheard of elsewhere for one metropolitan to profess obedience to another, and this he was not prepared to do. Thurstan asked the king's leave to appeal to Rome, but Henry refused. Moreover, Henry was incensed when the chapter of York sought and obtained a papal letter confirming their election of Thurstan, forbidding him to make profession, and permitting him to accept consecration from his own suffragans. The king now lent his backing to the archbishop of Canterbury, and, seeing that he lacked royal support, Thurstan resigned during a council held at Salisbury in March 1116. However, despite Henry's support for Canterbury's case the king did not wish to see Thurstan resign, and for the next eighteen months Thurstan accompanied the royal court and continued to be addressed as archbishop. The king continued to refuse to allow Thurstan to go to Rome, fearing that he would be consecrated by the pope. Both the archbishop of Canterbury and the chapter of York appealed to papal authority, and in response to a letter from Paschal II, Henry took the decision to restore Thurstan to the see of York.<h2>
<a name="ConsecrationandreturntoYork11181126"></a>Consecration and return to York, 1118&#150;1126</h2>In January 1118 on the death of Paschal II, who had supported the York cause, Thurstan returned to Normandy to ask the king's permission to seek the advice of the new pope, Gelasius II, but Henry again refused. The letters dispatched by Gelasius show him too to have been sympathetic to York's cause, but he died on 28 or 29 January 1119, and it was his successor, Calixtus II (<i>r</i>. 1119&#150;24), who took steps to end the uncertainty. He summoned Thurstan to his council at Tours on 22 September 1119, which Thurstan attended with the king's permission, and on 19 October he consecrated him archbishop at Rheims, two days before the opening of his council there. The English and Norman bishops who arrived the following day too late to object to the consecration refused to communicate with Thurstan. Pope Calixtus bestowed the pallium on Thurstan on 1 November. Henry's anger at Thurstan's disobedience&#151;according to Eadmer he had forbidden him to accept consecration should the pope offer it&#151;led him to forbid Thurstan to return to York. Henry and the pope met at Gisors in November 1119 but Henry refused to pardon Thurstan, and on his return to England confiscated his estates.<br>
<br>Thurstan remained in the entourage of the pope from his consecration until March 1120, during which time he assisted Calixtus, and secured papal bulls of confirmation for religious houses in his diocese. He also attempted to placate Henry I by arranging a treaty of peace between him and the king of France. Thurstan parted from the pope at Gap on 6 March, and spent the remainder of the year in France. He was present when Adela, countess of Blois, the mother of the future King Stephen, made her profession as a nun at Marcigny in April. Henry I, now finding Thurstan useful in negotiating with the king of France, was softening towards him, and in May he agreed to allow Thurstan to enter Normandy provided he did not return to England before the king made his final judgment. Thurstan's presence is recorded at the Council of Beauvais held by the papal legate in October 1120. Early in 1121, in response to a papal threat to place England under an interdict should Thurstan's exile be prolonged further, Henry took the decision to recall Thurstan, and in February 1121, seven years after his appointment as archbishop, he was able to enter York as a consecrated archbishop. He marked his return by celebrating the feast of St Peter's Chair (22 February) and by remitting chrism payments from the diocese, and in the following month with Bishop Ranulf Flambard of Durham he heard the claims of the monks of Durham to Tynemouth church.<br>
<br>This was not, however, the end of the primacy question. A new archbishop of Canterbury, William de Corbeil (<i>d</i>. 1136), was elected, on the advice of Thurstan, in February 1123. But Thurstan refused to consecrate him when he insisted on being recognized as primate of all Britain, and William was consecrated on 18 February 1123 by his suffragans. Both William and Thurstan journeyed to Rome to put their case before the pope. It was on this occasion, according to Hugh the Chanter, that the Canterbury party resorted to producing forged charters in an attempt to prove their case. Thurstan made a second journey to Rome, in October 1125, and eventually Canterbury's claim to primacy was overruled, and its archbishop compensated with a papal legation. This marked the end of the most bitter phase of the Canterbury&#150;York dispute, although at the Christmas court of 1126 in London the archbishops quarrelled again over Thurstan's right to have his cross borne aloft before him in the southern province.<h2>
<a name="Relationswiththenorthernbishoprics"></a>Relations with the northern bishoprics</h2>It was not just in relation to Canterbury but also in Scotland that Thurstan had to define his authority. In 1119 and again in 1121 he obtained papal bulls addressed to all the Scottish bishops enjoining them to profess obedience to him, orders the pope repeated in 1122. John, bishop of Glasgow (<i>d</i>. 1147), consecrated by the pope at Thurstan's request, refused to profess obedience to York, something about which Thurstan complained during his visit to the papal curia in October 1125. Robert (<i>d</i>. 1159), prior of the Augustinian house of Scone, was named by Alexander I (<i>r</i>. 1107&#150;24) as bishop of St Andrews in late 1123 or 1124, but his consecration was delayed by the dispute over the demand for York's profession to Canterbury. At the instance of Pope Honorius II (<i>r</i>. 1124&#150;30) the question of Robert's consecration was discussed at a meeting between Alexander's successor, David I (<i>r</i>. 1124&#150;53), and the papal legate Giovanni da Crema at Roxburgh in late 1125, and John of Glasgow was sent as David's envoy to the papal curia to seek metropolitan status for St Andrews. The matter seems to have been settled by compromise, and Thurstan consecrated Bishop Robert at York in the spring or early summer of 1127 without obtaining a profession of obedience, but without prejudice to the church of York. In July of that year Thurstan was at Roxburgh with King David when Bishop Robert, in their presence, released the priory of Coldingham from the payment of certain dues. Thurstan revived the ancient Scottish see of Galloway (Whithorn), whose bishop, Gilla-Aldan, he consecrated in York in 1125.<br>
<br>It was perhaps the difficulties he encountered in Scotland that encouraged Thurstan to develop a further diocese in the north of England. In 1133 he received papal permission for the creation of a see at Carlisle. Plans had evidently been long in the making. An Augustinian priory was planted in the city in 1122, and it may have been that the idea for a new bishopric in an area where Scottish bishops had from time to time exercised authority was discussed in 1126, when Henry I and King David of Scotland met to ask Thurstan to request the pope to adjourn the hearing of the case of the Scottish bishops. It is from 1126 that Thurstan appears to have dropped his claims to metropolitan authority over Scotland. As first bishop of Carlisle, Thurstan appointed Athelwold 
    (Athelwulf; <i>d</i>. 1156/7)
  , prior of the prestigious Yorkshire Augustinian house of Nostell. It was a shrewd choice: Athelwold was a former royal chaplain, and it was the patronage of Henry I that had raised Nostell to its position of pre-eminence in the diocese. Athelwold continued to hold the priorate of Nostell in plurality with the bishopric, thus enabling the revenues of his priory to shore up the financial position of the new see. The creation of the bishopric of Carlisle was a real success for Thurstan, even though it was not until the early thirteenth century that the see became firmly established.<h2>
<a name="ThepatronoftheCistercians"></a>The patron of the Cistercians</h2>As archbishop of York, Thurstan was an energetic churchman. He continued the consolidation of the chapter of York by creating two prebends: that of Bramham comprised three churches granted by Robert Fossard, and was assigned to the priory of Nostell; that of Salton was held by the canons of Hexham. Thurstan issued decrees confirming the status of the lands of deceased canons of York, and granted the cathedral school 100<i>s</i>. a year, 40<i>s</i>. to be drawn from the archdeaconry of the East Riding and 30<i>s</i>. from the Romescot, or Rome penny, of the archdeaconry of Nottingham. He did not neglect the collegiate churches of the diocese, and restored lands to the church of Ripon, assigning them for a prebend there, and created a further prebend at Southwell.<br>
<br>However, it is for his encouragement of the monastic orders within his diocese that Thurstan is perhaps best known. He was himself the founder of two religious houses, and of a small hospital, that of St Mary Magdalen, Ripon. At a date between <i>c</i>.1125 and 1133 he established the first post-conquest nunnery in the north, that of St Clement's, situated just outside the walls of York. He attempted, unsuccessfully, to persuade Christina of Markyate to become its first prioress. The foundation of St Clement's appears to have acted as a catalyst, for the establishment of further houses for religious women followed in quick succession. Thurstan's second monastic foundation was less carefully planned, and came about as a result of Thurstan's intervention, in his capacity as ordinary of the diocese, in affairs at St Mary's Abbey, York. The arrival of the Cistercian monks in the city of York, on their way from the king's court to the site of their first northern plantation at Rievaulx, in March 1132, exercised a profound effect on some of the black monks of St Mary's. They began to demand reform in their own house, on the lines of Cistercian austerity. The abbot refused to listen, and the reforming party within the abbey turned to Archbishop Thurstan for advice. Thurstan was familiar with Cistercian reform, having been associated with Henry I and Walter Espec (<i>d</i>. 1158) in the foundation of Rievaulx. In October 1132 Thurstan conducted a visitation of the abbey, evidently intending to act as mediator. However, Abbot Geoffrey had summoned to his side the abbots and priors of other Benedictine houses, and far from bringing reconciliation the archbishop's visit ended with the ejection from the abbey of a party of thirteen monks, including the prior.<br>
<br>Thurstan took the monks into his household, and after spending Christmas on the archiepiscopal manor of Ripon, he provided them with land on which to settle. This was the site in the valley of the River Skell of what was to become the Cistercian abbey of Fountains. Thurstan was clearly sympathetic to the aspirations of the new orders. Not only did he encourage the foundation of Rievaulx, and some years earlier that of the Savigniac house of Furness, but he wrote personally to Roger de Mowbray asking him to afford protection to the monks of Furness who were to found Byland Abbey on Roger's estates. Historians have debated the likelihood that Thurstan was the author of the fierce, anti-Cluniac, invective enshrined in the so-called &#145;Letter of Thurstan&#146;. This exists in several copies, including two dating from the late twelfth century and deriving from Cistercian houses&#151;Fountains itself and its daughter house of Sawley&#151;and was incorporated into the fifteenth-century manuscript of the <span class="italic">Narratio de fundatione</span> of Fountains Abbey. The letter is a polemic, designed to explain and justify the actions of the St Mary's monks in demanding reform. Many features, including its address to the archbishop of Canterbury and the criticism of the Cluniac monks whom Thurstan would choose to join in his final days, have led some historians to judge the letter a fabrication. The matter is not easily resolved, but the critical role played by Thurstan in the foundation of Fountains and the dispersal of the Cistercians in the north cannot be doubted.<h2>
<a name="ThesupporteroftheAugustinianstheleaderofthenorth"></a>The supporter of the Augustinians; the leader of the north</h2>Thurstan's major contribution to the monastic settlement of the diocese was less spectacular than the events of late 1132. From his early years in the north he encouraged the barons of the region to found and endow monastic houses, and priories of Augustinian canons found special favour with him. Charters of foundation bear witness to Thurstan's endeavours in this respect. He and Henry I were closely involved in the transformation of the hermitage of Nostell into an Augustinian house, and under his guidance barons established Augustinian canons at Guisborough, Kirkham, Bolton, Drax, and Worksop. The regular canons were then in fashion, and particularly favoured by bishops, since as monk&#150;priests they might serve in parish churches. Thurstan's hand may have also been behind the type of endowment that the Yorkshire Augustinians received, for their founders and patrons conveyed to them the patronage of a large number of parish churches. Thurstan doubtless looked on the foundation of religious houses by the laity as something to be encouraged for its own sake; but in promoting the cause of the canons he was also securing for himself a way of bringing order and discipline, as well as pastoral care, to a large and unwieldy diocese. It was this that led him to associate the Augustinian priories of Nostell and Hexham with prebends in York Minster, and to appoint the Augustinian prior of Nostell as first bishop of Carlisle. He clearly took a personal interest in Hexham, making gifts of relics, books, vestments, candlesticks, and ornaments. His <i>acta</i> bear witness to his concern to strengthen the possessions and privileges of the northern religious houses by issuing charters of confirmation, and in addition he took the opportunity, when he was in Rome, to secure papal confirmation and privileges for them.<br>
<br>Thurstan's activities were not confined to his own diocese, for he was a figure of European standing. He acted as a papal judge-delegate, hearing the case between the bishops of St David's and Llandaff (1132). In 1138 he wrote to the pope to advise against the election of Abbot Anselm of Bury St Edmunds (<i>d</i>. 1148) as bishop of London, and indeed urged his deposition as abbot; and in 1139 after the death of his brother, Audoin, bishop of &Eacute;vreux, he wrote to the canons of &Eacute;vreux requesting them to allow Gilbert the Chamberlain to continue to reside in the house that Thurstan had purchased for the canons.<br>
<br>Thurstan came to be regarded as the leader of the north. His negotiations with David I in 1137 helped to prevent a Scottish invasion of Northumbria, and when in 1138 the truce disintegrated and the men of Scotland turned south to invade, it was Thurstan who assembled the northern barons at York to plan their defence of the shire. Although too weak to appear on the field of battle&#151;by this time illness compelled him to be carried in a litter&#151;he handed over the banner of St Peter to the English army, and placed by their side against the Scots his suffragan Ralph Nowell, bishop of Orkney. The army inspired by Thurstan defeated the Scots at the battle of the Standard, on Cowton Moor near Northallerton, in August 1138.<h2>
<a name="Resignationanddeath"></a>Resignation and death</h2>By 1138 Thurstan was approaching seventy years of age, and ill health prevented his attending the peace conference in Carlisle in November and the legatine council in December. Just over a year later, on 25 January 1140, before the altar of St Andrew in his cathedral church, he resigned his office. If Richard of Hexham is to be believed, he had been trying to secure the succession to York of his brother Audoin, using as an intermediary at Rome Richard, abbot of Fountains. However, Audoin died first, having become an Augustinian canon at Merton in July 1139. Thurstan retired to the Cluniac priory of Pontefract, and in accordance with his youthful vow he took the habit of a Cluniac monk. He died on 6 February and was buried in the priory church of St John the Evangelist, Pontefract, before the high altar.<h2>
<a name="Historicalsignificance"></a>Historical significance</h2>Thurstan was in one sense a member of the &#145;old order&#146;, the son of a married priest, and member of an ecclesiastical dynasty. He secured the appointment of his nephew, Osbert de Bayeux, to the archdeaconry of Richmond, and may have sought to pass on the diocese of York to his brother. He was appointed archbishop by the king with no reference to the chapter of York. And, in the tradition of Thomas (I) of York (<i>d</i>. 1100), he was a vigorous champion of the cause of York against Canterbury. But Thurstan also stepped over into the new world of the twelfth century. He was not afraid to appeal to papal authority over that of the king. His long period of office saw the consolidation of the chapter of York, and those of the collegiate churches of his diocese, and the remarkable spread and growth of the monastic orders in which Thurstan himself was a prime force. John of Hexham praised his steadfastness, his sense of principle, his devotion to the cause of religious women, his frugal life, his generosity in alms-giving, and pastoral care. Thurstan achieved and retained the affection and respect of the king whom he opposed, the barons of the north whom he inspired in battle, and the church of York which he served.<br>
