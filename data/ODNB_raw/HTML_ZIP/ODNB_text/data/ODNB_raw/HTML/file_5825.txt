<span class="headword">Coke,  Daniel Parker</span>  (1745&#150;1825), <span class="occ">barrister and politician</span>, was born on 17 July 1745, the only son of Thomas Coke (1700&#150;1776), barrister, and his wife, Matilda (1706&#150;1777), daughter and heir of Thomas Goodwin of Derby. He belonged to an old Derbyshire family, the Cokes of Trusley, of which he became in time the chief representative, though without an inheritance, the patrimonial estate descending in the female line. After being educated by the Revd Thomas Marlove at Derby School, he matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, in 1762, and migrated to All Souls, graduating BA in 1769 and MA in 1772. He was called to the bar in 1768, at Lincoln's Inn, and practised for many years on the midland circuit. In 1776 he was elected to parliament as member for Derby, which he represented until 1780. At the general election in that year he visited neighbouring Nottingham, to assist the corporation candidate Sir Edward Every, but was himself persuaded to stand. He was elected with the whig Robert Smith, and represented the town until 1812, when he retired from parliament.<br>
<br>Coke built a solid base of personal support in Nottingham by assiduously promoting the interests of his constituents. On their behalf he urged the abolition of the receipt tax in parliament in December 1783. He suggested instead a tax on the stalls of deans and prebendaries, &#145;the most useless order of ecclesiastics in existence &hellip; he should be happy when the day arrived, on which they were to be abolished&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 101). This was a bold statement, given his strong Anglican ties, but one that was likely to be well received among Nottingham's politically powerful nonconformist community. In May 1784 he defended Nottingham trade by opposing the government's Irish commercial proposals on protectionist grounds. And in May 1788 he promoted the interests of Nottingham hosiers, with a bill to make frame-breaking punishable by death. It was rejected by the Commons as an unnecessary addition to the long list of existing capital crimes.<br>
<br>In 1791 Coke held a brief for the crown in the prosecution of the ringleaders of the Church and King mob which sacked the Birmingham house of the prominent dissenter Dr Joseph Priestley. He opened the second day of the trial with a personal declaration:<blockquote>[He] did not profess to agree with Dr Priestley either in his religious or his political opinions; but if he had been at Birmingham when the riots took place, he should have risked his life in the protection of Dr Priestley's house; and the more so, because he had differed in opinion from him. (<span class="italic">A Full and Accurate Report</span>, 39)</blockquote>The following year, in 1792, he opposed a motion for an inquiry into the culpability of the magistrates at Birmingham. By then the effects of the French Revolution were beginning to be widely felt in Britain, and even liberal-minded independent politicians such as Coke turned instinctively to the defence of the established order.<br>
<br>Coke gave consistent support to the government during the war with France, which began in 1793, and in Nottingham this left him politically exposed. At the 1796 election in the town both he and Robert Smith faced opposition from Dr Peter Crompton, &#145;an opposer of the war, and all its train of ruinous consequences&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nottingham Journal</span>, 4 June 1796). Though they were both comfortably re-elected a new dimension had been added to the debate: &#145;Loyalists&#146; had clashed with &#145;Democrats&#146;, and the French Revolution had become &#145;an object of admiration to one part of the people, and of terror to the other&#146;  (Blackner, 300).<br>
<br>By the time of the 1802 general election Coke was deeply unpopular in Nottingham because of his support for the war, &#145;to which was attributed the excessive high price of provisions&#146;  (Blackner, 301). Political radicalism and popular discontent now converged to produce a specially turbulent poll. Coke and his supporters were subjected to constant intimidation and abuse, and on one occasion Coke himself was stoned and bloodied by a crowd as he crossed the market place. He eventually withdrew from the contest &#145;from the just apprehension of hazard to his life&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 36, 1801&#150;3, 1230). Victory went to his radical opponent, Dr Joseph Birch of Preston, described by one source as &#145;a whig, and something more&#146;  (Bailey, 222). Birch hailed his success, which came aptly on 14 July, as a triumph for civil liberty, and he alluded to the fall of the Bastille. Coke however saw at work &#145;Jacobinical&#146; principles, which aimed ultimately at placing &#145;the Tenant above his Landlord, the Servant above his Master, and the Subject above his Prince&#146;  (<span class="italic">Coke and Birch</span>, 298&#150;300).<br>
<br>Coke successfully petitioned parliament against Birch's election and in May 1803 they contested the seat again. To ensure freedom of election parliament had controversially extended to the town the jurisdiction of the county magistrates, who were predominantly conservative and in opposition to the corporation. In this changed setting Coke made a triumphant return to Nottingham, on 26 May, at the head of 1600 horsemen wearing his colours. It was a powerful display of strength and he won a resounding victory. At the nomination he and Birch had respectfully disputed the right of property to exercise influence at elections. Coke took a traditional view on this, and there is no doubt that such influence played its part in his success. He fought off another challenge from Birch in 1806, and from Crompton in 1807, before retiring in 1812. That year, significantly, both Nottingham seats were won by radicals. Coke continued as chairman of the Derbyshire quarter sessions until 1818. A lifelong bachelor, he died at his house, The College, in Derby, on 6 December 1825, aged eighty, and was buried in the local church of All Saints. A memorial stone there pays tribute to his record of public service, lauding him as &#145;high-minded, and in its true and just sense liberal&#146;.<br>
