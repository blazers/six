<span class="headword">Bicknell,  James David</span>  (1906&#150;1988), <span class="occ">record producer</span>, was born on 1 September 1906 at 42 St John's Wood Road, London, the son of Gilbert Elhannan Bicknell, stockbroker, and his wife, Florence Ferrier Ross. He was educated in the high Anglican tradition of Marlborough College between 1919 and 1924, and gained a musical training in London and Paris. Bicknell intended to follow his father into the City, but at the age of twenty-one met Trevor Williams, chairman of the Gramophone Company (popularly known as HMV) and a friend of the Bicknell family, who offered him a job in the company's international artistes department. Bicknell later recalled that joining the business, for which his mother had worked before her marriage, made him feel as if he were coming home.<br>
<br>In 1927, the year Bicknell joined the international artistes department, the record industry was still undergoing a period of technological transition from mechanical to electrical recording. The new process made records sound more realistic and permitted large-scale recordings of orchestral and other works. As the existing catalogue of records had been rendered obsolete by these changes, the company was engaged in a major re-recording programme. At the time Fred Gaisberg, the British record industry's founding father, was the artistic director of the international artistes department. He took the young Bicknell under his wing and taught him the basics of artist and repertoire management. As Gaisberg's assistant Bicknell was involved in recording important performers such as Alfred Cortot, Jacques Thibaud, Pablo Casals, and Fritz Kreisler. In 1931, in the midst of the great depression, the Gramophone Company merged with its competitor, the Columbia Graphophone Company, to form Electric and Musical Industries Ltd (EMI). Despite the difficulties caused by the depression, the 1930s were a highly creative time for Bicknell. Among the many important recordings he made during the 1930s was a series of Mozart operas by the newly formed Glyndebourne Company, including first ever complete recordings of <span class="italic">La nozze di Figaro</span>, <span class="italic">Don Giovanni</span>, and <span class="italic">Cos&igrave; fan tutte</span>, which remained touchstones of performance on record into the late twentieth century.<br>
<br>Bicknell's career was interrupted by war service, when he was commissioned into the Oxford and Buckinghamshire light infantry, serving in Britain, France, and Germany. He was appointed MBE for bravery under fire. In 1946 he returned to EMI where he immediately began to rebuild the classical catalogue. He visited Italy and made contracts with rising young artists, such as the conductors Victor de Sabata and Guido Cantelli. They included the Italian violinist Giaconda de Vito (1907&#150;<i>c</i>.1994), daughter of Giacomo de Vito, a doctor of agriculture, whom Bicknell married on 16 November 1949. They had no children. The decade following his return was one of great upheaval for EMI. The company lost much of its classical repertoire when its two American licensees, RCA Victor and American Columbia, terminated their agreements. In addition, EMI's late entry into the LP market meant that in order to compete it had to create a fresh catalogue in a short time. It was during this period that Bicknell and his colleague Walter Legge made the transition from artist and repertoire managers to record producers, responsible for creating a unique artistic form of performance on records. Bicknell was responsible for many of Cantelli's great recordings and those of another major post-war signing, the Spanish soprano Victoria de los Angeles.<br>
<br>In 1957 Bicknell became manager of EMI's international artistes department and gave up record making altogether. However, he supervised the modernization and expansion of the company's classical recording programmes, introducing stereo recording in 1957&#151;a move which required the complete remaking of the existing classical catalogue. His period as manager was clouded by the difficulties he encountered trying to manage Walter Legge, whose costs were seen as increasingly extravagant by EMI's dynamic new chairman Sir Joseph Lockwood. However, by the time he retired in 1971, ending a supremely successful career spanning forty-four years and encompassing some of the most dramatic changes in the history of the record industry, he had created a major catalogue of classical music, expanded the range of music available to consumers, and dramatically increased sales of such records.<br>
<br>On his retirement Bicknell became EMI's honorary archivist, and continued to sit on several important committees such as the advisory panel to the Arts Council, and the governing committee of the British Institute of Recorded Sound. A tall distinguished man and a refined gentleman of the old school, Bicknell lived out his retirement with his wife in their Hertfordshire home, with occasional visits to their apartment in Rome and other travels. Curiously, he never wrote his memoirs, but, courteous to the end, he remained a major source of knowledge for broadcasters and historians of the recording industry.<br>
<br>Bicknell died, aged eighty-two, of bronchopneumonia and cancer of the pharynx at his home, Flint Cottage, Troutstream Way, Loudwater, Hertfordshire, on 5 September 1988. Throughout his career, Bicknell combined extraordinary ability in the field of recording with a diplomatic, easy-going personality&#151;an essential feature in the often difficult atmosphere of the recording studio&#151;which earned him the respect of colleagues and artists alike. At his retirement lunch in 1971, the veteran pianist Gerald Moore described Bicknell as &#145;a loveable character &hellip; who did his work with such enormous dignity and extraordinary modesty&#146;.<br>
