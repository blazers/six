<span class="headword">Whitford,  Walter</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1647), <span class="occ">bishop of Brechin and Church of England clergyman</span>, was the son of Adam Whitford of Milntown (latterly Milton Lockhart), and his wife, Mary, daughter of Sir James Somerville of Cambusnethan, Lanarkshire. His father had been accused of involvement in January 1576 in a conspiracy against the regent, James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton. Walter was educated at Glasgow University, where he graduated MA in 1601, and afterwards acted as regent. On 10 May 1604 he was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Paisley, and on 3 December 1608 he was presented by James VI to the parish of Kilmarnock, Ayrshire. In 1610 he was translated to Moffat, Dumfriesshire, where he was admitted before 8 June. In 1613 he was nominated to the commission of the peace for Annandale, and was involved in several of the family feuds with which the county abounded. Some time in the earlier 1610s he married Anne (<i>d</i>. in or after 1660), fourth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4704/', "Sir John Carmichael of that ilk (c.1542&#150;1600)")</script>, and great-niece of Morton. They had five sons, <a href="#cosubject_29307">John [<i>see below</i>]</a>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29310/', "Walter Whitford (b. c.1617, d. in or after 1691)")</script>, <a href="#cosubject_29305">Adam [<i>see below</i>]</a>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29306/', "David Whitford (1626&#150;1674)")</script>, and James, and two daughters.<br>
<br>On 27 June 1617 Whitford signed the protestation to parliament in support of the liberties of the kirk. However, on 15 June 1619 he was nominated a member of the court of high commission, and on 30 August following became a pluralist when he was constituted minister of Failford in Ayrshire by the king. In March 1620 he received the degree of DD from Glasgow University, and on 4 August 1621 he was confirmed in his ministry by act of parliament. In 1623 his commission as justice of the peace was renewed, and he was appointed convener of the stewartry of Annandale. In the same year James proposed to translate him to Liberton in Edinburghshire, but failed to carry out his intention. On 25 October 1627 Whitford was appointed one of the commissioners nominated by the king for taking measures against papists, which on 21 October 1634 was expanded into a high commission to cite and punish all persons dwelling in Scotland concerning whom there were unfavourable reports. On 9 December 1628 he was presented by Charles I to the subdeanery of Glasgow; a dispute as to the crown's right of patronage prevented his taking possession until 1630. On 21 October 1634 he was nominated to the commission for the maintenance of church discipline.<br>
<br>On 15 September 1635 Whitford was consecrated as bishop of Brechin as successor to Thomas Sydserff, apparently on the recommendation of the earl of Stirling. The see was not rich, and it was proposed at one time that it be joined with the abbacy of Arbroath&#151;a matter with which Archbishop William Laud was charged at his trial as an instance of his meddling in the property rights of the laity. Whitford continued to hold the Glasgow subdeanery <i>in commendam</i> until 1639, when he conveyed his titles to James Hamilton, third marquess (afterwards first duke) of Hamilton. On 16 April 1635 he was created a burgess of Arbroath. Whitford used his episcopal authority to support the liturgical changes which Charles I had introduced. The new service book was very unpopular, and in 1637, when Whitford announced his intention of reading it, he was threatened with violence. Undeterred he ascended the pulpit, holding a brace of pistols, his family and servants attending him in arms, and read the service behind closed doors. On his return he was attacked by an enraged mob, and escaped with difficulty.<br>
<br>In February 1638 Whitford was one of the Scottish privy councillors who upheld the royal proclamation declaring opposition to the new prayer book treasonable. His obstinate imposition of the novel liturgy within his diocese and the kingdom at large roused intense feeling against him, and towards the close of the year, after his palace had been plundered, he was compelled to fly to England, and was harried all the way. In October 1638 Sir Archibald Johnston of Warriston had been advised to see to it that, when Whitford was at Edinburgh, &#145;in some private way, some course may be taken for his terror and disgrace if he offer to shew himself publicly&#146;  (Stevenson, 114). On 13 December 1638 he was deposed and excommunicated by the Glasgow assembly, whose authority, in common with the other Scottish bishops, he had refused to recognize. He was accused before the assembly of moral turpitude and closet papistry. On 23 August 1639 he and his fellow prelates drew up a protest against their exclusion from parliament.<br>
<br>On 28 December 1640 Whitford was living in London in great poverty, but on 20 February 1642, as a recompense for his sufferings, Charles presented him to the rectory of Walgrave, Northamptonshire, where he was instituted. In 1645 he was brought before the committee for plundered ministers and sequestered for having demonstrated &#145;great disaffection to the parliament and the proceedings thereof&#146;, both in private and in public, as well as discouraging his parishioners from giving their assistance to the Westminster regime &#145;in this defensive war&#146;  (<span class="italic">Walker rev.</span>, 286). The compounding committee was subsequently instructed to see to his ejection from the town and parish. In spite of his sufferings at the hands of the Long Parliament, it is notable that, when he died in 1647, he was buried with honour on 16 June in the middle aisle of the chancel of St Margaret's, Westminster.<br>
<br>In 1660 Bishop Whitford's widow petitioned for a yearly allowance out of the rents of the bishopric of Brechin in consideration of the sufferings of her family in the royal cause. Their eldest son, <a name="cosubject_29307"></a><span class="headword">John Whitford</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1667), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was a graduate of Glasgow University. Having been ordained deacon in London on 30 January 1641, through the influence of Archbishop Laud he was instituted on 10 February to the rectory of Northamptonshire. On 31 May 1642 at Blisworth he married Judith (<i>c</i>.1626&#150;1707), daughter of John and May Marriott of Ashton. In 1645 he was ejected, and took refuge with his father. He was reinstated at the Restoration, and on 5 July 1661 received a grant of &pound;100 in compensation for the loss of his books and other property. He died at Ashton on 9 October 1667 and was buried there; his widow died on 5 March 1707. His brother <a name="cosubject_29305"></a><span class="headword">Adam Whitford</span>  (1623/4&#150;1647), <span class="occ">student and soldier</span>, matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 10 December 1641, aged seventeen. Caught up in the civil war, and apparently serving as a soldier, he did not graduate BA until 4 August 1646, after the surrender of the Oxford royalist garrison. He died in the city on 10 February 1647 and was buried the same day in Christ Church Cathedral. His brother James survived to be commissioned ensign in the earl of Chesterfield's regiment of foot in 1667. Rachel Whitford married James Johnstone, laird of Corehead, and Christian Whitford married William Bennett of Bains.<br>
