<span class="headword">Nuttall,  George Henry Falkiner</span>  (1862&#150;1937), <span class="occ">bacteriologist</span>, was born in San Francisco, California, on 5 July 1862, the second son of Robert Kennedy Nuttall MD, from Tittour, co. Wicklow, and his wife, Magdalena, daughter of John Parrott of San Francisco. In 1865 the family returned to Europe, and the children were educated in England, France, Germany, and Switzerland. With his cosmopolitan upbringing Nuttall could speak several languages, which helped him greatly in his work and travels. He returned to America in 1878 and entered the University of California, where he proceeded MD in 1884. He went to Germany in 1886 and stayed for four years, studying mainly botany and zoology, subjects that led to an interest in parasitology, which became the main scientific interest of his life. In 1891 he returned to America as assistant to W. H. Welch, professor of pathology at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, but went back to Germany in 1892 to work on hygiene at G&ouml;ttingen and Berlin. In 1895 he married Paula (<i>d</i>. 1922), daughter of Kammerherr Hans von Oertzen-Kittendorf of Mecklenburg; they had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>In 1899 Nuttall gave a course of lectures on bacteriology at Cambridge, and a year later he was appointed university lecturer in bacteriology and preventive medicine. In 1901 he founded the <span class="italic">Journal of Hygiene</span> which he edited up to the time of his death, and in 1908 <span class="italic">Parasitology</span>, which he edited until 1933. In his editorial work he displayed the same thoroughness as in his research. He considered part of an editor's duties to be educational and was prepared to spend time in correcting and improving papers and advising young and inexperienced colleagues. As an editor he exerted great influence on associates all over the world, and his journals became models upon which the publications of several scientific societies were based.<br>
<br>In 1906 Nuttall was elected the first Quick professor of biology at Cambridge and a fellow of Magdalene College, with the duty of studying &#145;protozoa, especially such as cause disease&#146;. In 1919 he appealed for funds to build an institute for parasitological research. This led to the erection of the Molteno Institute for Research in Parasitology (later known as the Molteno Institute of Biology and Parasitology), which was formally opened in 1921. In 1920 the words &#145;study of parasitology&#146; were substituted for &#145;study of protozoa&#146; in the regulations concerning the duties of the Quick professor.<br>
<br>By this time, Nuttall's scientific work had covered a very wide field; in addition to several books, he had published papers on bacteriology, serology, hygiene, tropical medicine, and parasitology. Among his contributions to science was his discovery in 1888 that defibrinated blood possesses a strong bactericidal property against anthrax bacilli, and that this property disappears on heating the blood to 55 &deg;C. This work was the foundation for the study of humoral immunity and was the forerunner of great discoveries such as that of anti-toxic immunity. In 1892 he studied with Welch the anaerobic gas-forming micro-organism, later known as <i>Clostridium welchii</i>, the importance of which as a pathogenic agent was not fully appreciated until the war of 1914&#150;18. With H. Thierfelder (1895&#150;7) he also carried out the first successful experiments on life under aseptic conditions.<br>
<br>In 1897 Nuttall turned his attention to the part played by arthropods in the spread of disease, a subject to which he devoted the later period of his life. In 1901 he showed that the disappearance of malaria from England was not due to the extinction of the mosquito genus <i>Anopheles</i>, which still prevailed in all formerly malarious districts. In the same year he became interested in the precipitin reaction, and in 1904 he published his monograph <span class="italic">Blood Immunity and Blood Relationship</span>, which demonstrated a distinct similarity in chemical structure of the blood in animals which are related phylogenetically. Nuttall then began his investigations into diseases transmitted to animals by ticks. Using infected ticks (<i>Haemophysalis leachi</i>) from South Africa, he succeeded in infecting dogs with piroplasmosis, a disease unknown in England. One result of this investigation, which had great economic importance, was the discovery of the curative property of trypan blue for piroplasmosis in dogs, cattle, and sheep. This study was followed by an extensive investigation with Cecil Warburton and Louis Edward Robinson of the anatomy, biology, life history, and systematics of ticks, which occupied Nuttall during the remaining years of his life.<br>
<br>Nuttall resigned the Quick professorship in 1931 and became emeritus professor of biology. He died suddenly at the Craven Hotel in London on 16 December 1937 on the eve of a dinner in his honour to be given by sixty colleagues on his retirement from his editorship of the <span class="italic">Journal of Hygiene</span>. He was cremated on 21 December 1937 at Golders Green.<br>
<br>Nuttall was of distinguished appearance, had great charm, was an excellent raconteur, and was at ease in whatever company he found himself. He was elected FRS in 1904, received honorary degrees from several universities, and was elected corresponding member of many scientific societies.<br>
