<span class="headword">Sadler,  John</span>  (1720&#150;1789), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was born in Aintree on 9 January 1720, the eldest son of Adam Sadler, printer and engraver, and his wife, Elizabeth Beeby. John entered the family printing business and learned the art of printing from his father, who owned a prosperous printing firm in the New Market in Liverpool. By 1740 he had established his own printing business in Harrington Street. Like his father, he was a great music lover and among the many works he published was a collection of over 300 songs set to music, entitled <span class="italic">The Muses' Delight</span> (1754). In 1757 he founded the <span class="italic">Liverpool Chronicle and Marine Gazetteer</span>, which he printed for two years.<br>
<br>More importantly John Sadler is credited with inventing a method of transfer-printing onto earthenware tiles, although it now seems unlikely that he was indeed the first to use this process. The idea apparently occurred to him from observing children sticking waste prints onto pieces of broken earthenware. It is not clear when his experiments began, but an affidavit made out by Sadler and his assistant Guy Green states that on 27 July 1756 they printed 1200 earthenware tiles of different patterns in six hours, and that the process had taken upwards of seven years to perfect.<br>
<br>Sadler, an astute businessman, did not proceed with the costly patent application, realizing that his process was safer if kept a closely guarded trade secret. In addition to his tile business, he also transfer-printed onto enamelled copper and porcelain, which he sold to other retailers and from his own shop in Harrington Street. From the middle of 1761 Guy Green became his business partner and in September of the same year Sadler entered into an agreement with Josiah Wedgwood to transfer-print the Wedgwood creamware.<br>
<br>In 1766 Sadler sold his presses and equipment to John Gore and William Everard, who had just begun to publish the <span class="italic">Liverpool General Advertiser</span>. Four years later, in September 1770, he retired, possibly because he was not in the best of health. However, his abiding passion for collecting recipes and formulas kept him experimenting for a further twenty years, perfecting the transfer-printing process.<br>
<br>In 1777 Sadler married Elizabeth Parker (<i>d</i>. 1842), the daughter of a business associate, a watchmaker who owned a toy shop in Seel Street, and the niece of Mr Fazackerley, silversmith of Pool Lane. They had three children, a daughter, Elizabeth Mary (<i>b</i>. 1782), and two sons: John Adam (<i>b</i>. 1778) and James (<i>b</i>. 1786). John Sadler died in Liverpool on 10 December 1789 and was buried in Sefton.<br>
