<span class="headword">Wild,  George</span>  (1610&#150;1665), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Derry</span>, was born on 9 January 1610 in Middlesex, the son of Henry Wild, a citizen of London. He entered the Merchant Taylors' School, London, in 1619, and was elected scholar of St John's College, Oxford, in 1629. He matriculated on 13 November 1629, was elected fellow of his college in 1631, graduated BCL on 7 February 1635, and was incorporated at Cambridge in the same year. While at Oxford he wrote plays, unpublished in his lifetime, including <span class="italic">Euphormus</span>, a Latin comedy, <span class="italic">The Converted Robber</span>, and <span class="italic">Love's Comedy</span>, the latter acted before Charles I at St John's on 30 August 1636 to celebrate the opening of Archbishop Laud's new quadrangle there, the expensive production being paid for by the archbishop. Wild became chaplain to Laud, and was presented by him to the vicarage of St Giles, Reading, and in 1640 to the rectory of Biddenden, Kent. With the outbreak of civil war he became chaplain and preacher to the king at Oxford, the degree of DCL being conferred upon him on 23 November 1647. In March 1643 he preached in St Mary's before those MPs who had joined Charles I at Oxford, subsequently publishing the sermon.<br>
<br>Wild was turned out of his fellowship by the parliamentary visitors in 1648, having been sequestered from his living at Biddenden before 20 May 1645. During the interregnum he continued to officiate as a clergyman where he could, John Evelyn being present for his Easter sermon at St Gregory's, London, on 15 April 1655. Evelyn was present again on 30 December following, when Wild &#145;preached the funeral Sermon of preaching&#146; in advance of the planned implementation of Cromwell's proclamation against the ministrations of Anglican clergy or the use of the prayer book; &#145;so pathetic was his discourse, as drew many tears from his auditory&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of John Evelyn</span>, 2.107). Thereafter he conducted prayer book services and administered communion in a house in Fleet Street, London, and at some point appears to have suffered imprisonment.<br>
<br>After the Restoration, Wild was appointed bishop of Derry, and was one of twelve bishops consecrated by Primate Bramhall in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, on 27 January 1661. He and Jeremy Taylor, who preached at the consecration, were the only appointees without previous ecclesiastical careers in Ireland. Both men appear to have been considered unsuitable for English bishoprics, where the composition of the bench was determined, in large measure, by the need to placate &#145;moderate&#146; presbyterian opinion and to win as broad support as possible for the restored hierarchy. Wild and Taylor were, however, appointed to Irish dioceses with large numbers of protestant nonconformists, and Wild proved himself energetic in moving to enforce laws on conformity. In 1665 he boasted that he had &#145;brought very many [dissenters] of late to a peaceable conformity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hastings MSS</span>, 4.125). Considered to have been &#145;of great piety, and charity and to have stinted himself and spent most of the revenues of his see on acts of benevolence and hospitality&#146;  (Leslie, 9), he was somewhat of an ascetic in his later years. Visiting Dublin to attend parliament, he died of heart disease on 29 December 1665, and was buried in the choir of Christ Church, Dublin. He was unmarried, and left modest bequests to the Merchant Taylors' School, St John's College, and to the poor of Derry, London, and Kent. His funeral sermon was preached by Robert Mossom, who succeeded him at Derry.<br>
